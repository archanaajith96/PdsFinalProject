Great cocktails, great bartenders, and a great atmosphere! A friend of mine recommended we show up at 4:45pm (they open at 5). By 4:50 there was a line of probably 15 people. They opened the doors at 5pm, checked IDs and were were ushered into a very cool, dim bar with bookshelves of bottles, and bartenders who were knowledgeable about their craft. Drinks were all top notch. HIGHLY recommend if you are in Nashville."}, {"review_id": "KLv7B0Rtb9KVWBjNTlS_rQ", "user_id": "O-jWQlybVD2P9aS1RdPDKg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Why we came: Visiting Nashville for the weekend and we wanted something a little more low-key rather than having a wild night out where all the bachelorette parties were happening. What we ordered: Old Fashioned and another whiskey cocktail (forgot the name) What we paid: Each cocktail was $11.75 but they also write in tiny font that 15% gratuity gets tacked on to the bill What we thought: If you're looking for something classy and low-key this is a great speakeasy-like place. We came in around 11pm on a Saturday night and only waited about 5-10 minutes. Got seated by the bar. Loved watching the bartender make our drinks! My fiancé loves ordering an old fashioned but it wasn't the best he's had. I guess the expectations are high when you're in Tennessee! I thought my cocktail was okay. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either."}, {"review_id": "s-WzIFNQUdF7oeH1sClj3w", "user_id": "F90aAQkzTmeJKzwxZ6p0iA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I should probably not write a review so that more people don't find out about this hidden gem. When you first pull up you'll see a sign for a restaurant and you'll likely miss the writing on the door that says \"The Patterson House.\" It's definitely the speakeasy it's described as on Yelp! You can't even see the actual lounge area when you walk in because they've done such a great job of hiding it away behind heavy velvet curtains. We had about a 20min wait, but it was so worth it. We each had 2 drinks-- an old fashioned, Robby Martinez, Woven Doves Tattoo and then whatever the first one on rum list is. Anyway, my first drink tasted a lot like a gummy bear with a bit of a medicine like taste. It wasn't my favorite, but it was fine. My second was the Woven Doves, a vodka drink. I should've gotten it from the start. It was fantastic!!! Perfect balance of vodka without an overwhelming taste of sugar/artificial flavors with the coconut it has in it. My boyfriend said his Old Fashioned was \"a good Old Fashioned.\" Not the best he's had, but there wasn't anything wrong with it-- a good balance of all of the flavors that are in an Old Fashioned. The Robby Martinez is definitely not for the amateur drinker. It has a mix of whisky and scotch in it. He said it was really good, though. We also had an order of the tater tots and the deviled eggs. The eggs were...let's just say they don't hold a candle to my mother's recipe. They were lacking flavor and were just so-so. The tater tots were yummy. The horseradish sauce with dill is a good compliment to the seasoning on them. Overall, the atmosphere is what you're going for with quality drinks. If you're there with just one other person you might be lucky enough to get a corner booth like we did-- feels very intimate and secluded. Excellent service from our very knowledgeable waiter who answered all of my questions about the menu and didn't act like I was bothering him. We'll definitely go back on our next visit to Nashville!"}, {"review_id": "rMHo9bfmbVIm8LOQDWIyzA", "user_id": "cJxjh8bElW85LumQOQXkuA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "On a Saturday night, there were eight people waiting ahead of us, so we left. We went back the next night. We got to Patterson House at 7:30 and there was no crowd on Sunday. I asked the bartender for a recommendation for a light and refreshing cocktail, and he said he had an idea. He poured me a cocktail, and when I asked what it was, he said it was a Southside -- lame. I've had Southsides before. I wanted a rec from their menu. So for the next round, I asked about one of the vodka drinks, and it sounded good, so I got that. Michael had the vanilla Paloma and some kind of a whiskey drink, similar to an old fashioned but with cinnamon. He liked both. The bar was a decent size with dim lighting and dark wood. We liked it."}, {"review_id": "oH4sIh5jQt7QuYUEkjcdOQ", "user_id": "HEtvS80TR3PjOUJP5JSRkQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Absolutely love everything about this place.

Classy setting, check. Unique and flavorful cocktails, check. Delicious food, check. Great service, check. Great overall experience, check. I brought 2 friends from out of town here and they were impressed by everything. My first time here I only had a cocktail but this time I tried the food in addition to ordering a craft cocktail. We ordered the following appetizers: -Deviled eggs (with bacon and smoked paprika): 6 eggs-Green olives-Tater tots (with horseradish aioli)-Sliders: set of 3 sliders-Fried chicken sliders: set of 3 slidersOur favorites were the sliders. My friend commented that sometimes the patty in a slider can be on the drier side since the surface area is so small but these were juicy and delicious. My favorite cocktail was actually one that my friend ordered (twice) called Penny for your Thoughts. I believe it had vodka, juice and champagne and I detected some sort of spice like cinnamon. The whole thing was sweet and delicious. As there is limited seating in Patterson House I would recommend arriving right when they open. The first time I sat at the bar area which is fine if you just have two people but the second time we got a small table in the corner which was nice for our group size."}, {"review_id": "bTVEBLmgSbPRQyAc6KredQ", "user_id": "bsmhU-UWPWx2WS2a-tRyvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Don't leave Nashville without a night in The Patterson House. - Classy ambiance- Very experienced/knowledged bartenders- Seasonal drinks/rotating menu- Great food/desserts (small bites)- Max party size 6-8The Patterson House is one of those bars that you must visit (unless you've come to Nashville solely for the Honky Tonks). I absolutely love the classy atmosphere and the bartenders come to your table to take your drink orders. The restaurant is very dimly lit, and it's like going into a different world walking from Nashville Midtown into the restaurant. Almost all of the cocktails are $13, and the menu separates them by type of liquor. Each time I go, there are new things on the menu but the bartenders are happy to make an old classic/favorite. I recommend a drink called \"The Best Stuff on Earth.\" It's a peach flavored drink that looks great and tastes great too.As far as food goes, I've ordered the fried brie and it was excellent. The mini burgers are good too if you want something heavier. Both desserts - the S'mores and Cinnamon Sugar Donuts - are absolutely amazing.To top it all off, the checks are given to you in books. I don't know why, but I just got so excited about that and it's a little quirky thing/detail that just adds to why I love this place so much."}, {"review_id": "JRwWPdRwsk0NgzU8i_hQDg", "user_id": "cNxIvS-F2ABzFyWAFNaEGg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "If you want to feel fancy and bougy now and then, Patterson house is your place.

But the drinks were delicioso! I had the Enemy of my enemy and tried some of my friend's Whiskey sour and some other whiskey drink I am failing to remember.

Even if you're not too knowledgable on your preferred cocktail, it's still worth a visit here out in Music Row to potentially find out what you might actually like. One of the first things you notice about The Patterson House is that it's a got a classy vibe to it, but it's definitely not overly pretentious. It's dimly lit, fairly quiet, and usually full of people just looking to have some good conversation over good drinks. While you may wait for a while at peak hours (e.g. 7-10 pm), this place is worth the wait. If waiting is not your thing, come here after midnight - I did, and I was able to get a table right away.Speaking of tables, it's not all bar areas here. Even if you're not at the bar and at a booth instead, the staff will come right to your table and take your drink order. The cocktail menu is organized by spirit (e.g. gin, rum, whiskey, brandy, vodka, etc.). There are four different cocktails for each spirit and as you go down each list, the cocktails get more boozy. Cocktails go for $13 each, which I think is priced very well considering the quality of the drink and the service you get. The staff are very knowledgable on all things imaginable about cocktails and they'll find something for you that you'll enjoy. There is food available as well, and I unfortunately was not in the mood to eat. However, judging by other reviews, it seems like the food is worth a shot.It seems like the menu of cocktails does rotate, so you may not have the cocktails that I had but I would recommend:- Enemy of My Enemy (brandy cocktail)- Almost Definitely (whisky)- Good & Plenty (gin)- Holographic Universe (vodka)Service here is top notch and very friendly here. I like how they give your check in a book - it's a small detail, but I found it fun to write a message in a book that many others have written in as well.Overall, while there are plenty of things to do and places to visit in Nashville, but do make sure to get a cocktail from The Patterson House."}, {"review_id": "VOsnjMQJm642vBrcaQZUmA", "user_id": "jhQ7e86l4iVnIeftIReIhA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Great drinks!!

Classy vibe, you can actually sit down and the bartender comes to you! They not only know a great deal about the drinks and mixology, but they will make sure you find a drink you like. I never realized how much other bartenders didn't care until I experienced how much the Patterson house does care! This is a high quality experience, not your typical bar experience. Every drink is totally unique and he menu is organized by which liquor base you want for your drink. Just turn to tequila or whisky or whatever your preferred poison is and you'll find mixes like you've never experienced before. Unlike many bars with fancy sounding drinks that come out tasting mediocre or use some fancy sounding liqueur that just tastes like more whiskey, here you'll be able to taste the multitude of flavors in your drink. It's truly an unforgettable experience and 100% worth the cost. Oh and PS their appetizers stand out above the crowd as well. You HAVE to try the doughnuts.

Though the drinks are actually pretty expensive ($13 each), you're paying for the experience as well as the drink itself. I'd recommend the firm and honest cocktail, but I'm sure most any cocktail will be delicious and full of alcohol.
