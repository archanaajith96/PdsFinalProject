After a day of sledding, hiking, and running in the dunes, this was a great place to get some local food. We turned to Yelp to get a recommendation and this place looked good to me. The building is nothing fancy, located on a corner, with a bit of parking around the back and side. This \"parking lot\" was overflowing, despite the late hour. I don't know if people in NM eat lunch late, or if it was the holiday, but 2pm is later than I usually go looking for lunch. We were seated immediately and given menus. On to the food! Although they took a bit to come out, the chips were warm and fresh. I'm totally OK waiting for fresh chips like that! The accompanying salsa was nice and had a good kick, so things really started out right. In my experience, if the salsa is bland or the chips are underdone, that does not bode well for your visit. Fortunately, totally not the case here. I had hoped to get the chicharrones burrito, but, sadly, they were out of the key ingredient. Instead, I ordered the fajita beef burrito, smothered in chile con queso. This is a sauce made of a blend of cheeses with hot green chiles. Holy cow! It was rich, spicy, cheesy awesomeness covering a fresh tortilla filled with tender strips of beef, peppers, and onions. I don't remember if there was anything else on the plate. There may have been beans and/or rice, but this burrito was the star of the show! There was enough spice, but not too much that it overpowered the flavors of the food. It looks like I'll have to go back for the chicharrones..."}, {"review_id": "PsLzSsqHNeYHGr4RzjiyTA", "user_id": "pZ3EtXuJu6SjKVKP_I2Byw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "The husband wanted some spicy New Mexican food, so we headed here. Even though it was past a typical lunch hour, the restaurant was full- always a good sign. I had a shredded beef burrito which was delicious. It had just the right amount of beef, and refried beans on the side. I ordered green sauce in a separate bowl, because I know I'm a spice weenie. It was delicious, but still felt really spicy to me, so I was glad I didn't cover the burrito with it. I would daintily dip my loaded fork into the sauce, and that worked for me! Kirstie was a hard-working and efficient server. She kept our glasses full and made sure we had everything we needed. All in all this was a great place."}, {"review_id": "U6gycHBdY-MNVpfgRXNbnw", "user_id": "lDJ5oH3CGi6pItsDW2KSjw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "This is the best Mexican food I have ever had by far.  Besides that, the staff is always super amazing, the wait times aren't bad, and the restaurant is very kid-friendly.  Definitely my favorite restaurant.  Would certainly recommend."}, {"review_id": "5PNCNvQ4SGLU26HoeXA74g", "user_id": "PttfC3pZveKAF4YIOFsGWg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/1/2017", "text": "I came here on work travel and got right in for dinner on a Thursday night. The staff was friendly to me and attentive. Food came very, very quickly. My margarita was okay. It tasted like it had a splash of pineapple in it and the salt on the rim was like tiny table salt. Meh. The food was wonderful though. I got a combo plate which was plenty of leftovers for the next day. The chips and salsa they give out to each table were wayyyy too spicy. My mouth was on fire long after eating a handful of dipped chips.

It was long gone, but we found El Sombrero on Yelp. The waiter was so friendly and helpful. He brought a sample of the green enchilada sauce for me to taste to ensure it wasn't too hot for me. I ordered the green chicken enchilada and it was wonderful. Lots of chicken white meat, delicious sauce and fresh tortillas. My husband got the chicken tampico and he said the chicken was delicious. But best of all was dessert- sopapilla stuffed with ice cream. Omg- so delicious, the cinnamon was perfect. Oh and my husband ordered a draft beer that was from a local brewery that was excellent. Can't remember the name, but it was so good he had to. The waiter was friendly and kind and solicitors, JC, I think. I highly recommend El Sombrero, deserves being voted best Mexican restaurant in Las Cruces."}, {"review_id": "C1_PhDOhqzjfBhKKqLMSzA", "user_id": "rSQnus5E_R19KGlFZRegbw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/25/2017", "text": "I was a regular patron (combo #3 with relleno on the side) when I was an undergrad/graduate student at NMSU almost 30 years ago.Since then, whenever I come to Las Cruces, El Sombrero is where I got for as long as I'm in town.

While on a road trip through New Mexico, hubby and I stopped in El Sombrero Patio Cafe and had a great lunch. The queso was excellent, but we are gringos and found it a bit calliente.

We were seated quickly and our order taken , but things went downhill from there. Our waitress was inattentive, took forever to bring our drinks and when the meal came they only brought my husbands meal. As we sat there for the next 15 minutes waiting for my meal, no one came to tell us what was going on. Our waitress finally appeared and said they forgot my meal and it would be out shortly. She then promised to bring more chips - 20 minutes later - after we had shared and finished my husband's meal, she finally brought our chips and my meal -At that point I had her box it up as we were ready to leave . To top it off my husbands meal was barely warm. The waitress never apologized or offered any thing to make it right .

The salsa was AMAZING, and if you know me...I rarely say that.  Normally the salsa is served mild-medium and I just live with it because anything else has pineapple and I can't have pineapple.  I knew I was in southern New Mexico as soon as I tasted that salsa (as if the goat heads hadn't all ready given it away).  The only thing keeping me from giving a 5 star review is that my cousins beans came out cold, and their red chile sauce was too pasty for my liking, and their sopapillas were to doughy for my liking.  Other than those few tweaks, the food was excellent. I hope to return and call earlier in the day to see what all, exactly, I could eat.  I avoided the meats just incase there was something in the seasoning that I would react to, but still cheese enchiladas with red chile sauce and onions, rice and beans is my favorite food. The wines they offer were good, I had a nice white pino and hubby had their sangria (my cousin was driving).  We ate our weight in chips and salsa and our food, and called in a successful night."}, {"review_id": "JC2KBbzbhhfDgKhd40Yz3w", "user_id": "pRl5_MK1_ZKWh-XPwVOCQw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/21/2016", "text": "Staying at Hotel Encanto (what a gorgeous hotel, incredible views) and the the front desk person recommended this restaurant to me. I actually thought about dining at Gardunos in the hotel since I heard the restaurant completely revamped itself from the Chef down, but that 2.5 stars...ouch.I had the gordito, rolled taco (tacquito) and green enchilada combo. My plate came out lukewarm/cold which meant that my enchilada and beans and rice were also the same - it wasn't good. The gordito was okay and the rolled taco seemed like it was pre-cooked and then warmed, the same with the enchilada.In all, I didn't think it was terrible but definitely not a good experience. Waitstaff was friendly, however. From what I understand, Enrique's or Mesilla Valley are highly reputable, so perhaps I should've gone there instead.
