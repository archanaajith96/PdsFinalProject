If you're for a fantastic small spot with the sophisticated charm of New England, birch is the place to go.Sitting between Washington Street and Aborn Street, birch appears very intimate. The dining room occupies one single room with a U-shaped table that sits about 18 people. You sit on the outside of the U while you are served from the space in the middle. Their dinner menu is one page, so need to worry about taking too much time to order.Dinners are served in a tasting menu style and it truly makes you feel like you are the star for the night. The menu is seasonal, but every season I come has a scrumptious surprise waiting for me.To start off, we were delighted to start off with a complimentary herbed vegetable shooter to awaken our palate. After a fresh taste, we were graced with first courses, Raw Vermont Wagyu Beef and Raw Scallops with Turnip. Topped with a delicate preserved beach rose, the beef melted in my mouth like you'd expect from a nice Wagyu. The scallops tasted like they were plucked straight from the shell and absorbed the turnip-cherry blossom broth it was sitting in. Probably my favorite dish was the lamb. A generous piece of lamb sat on the plate with additions of crunchy beans and a vibrant tomato sauce that added a complexity of flavors.After finish the meal, it's always such a treat to have them bring you their classic whoopie pies. An enchanting dining experience that will have me coming back for more."}, {"review_id": "sVZHRXVLppFQWqC5mZW0cQ", "user_id": "_KHiD6Vqlq6iekTYcX0gSQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "The food is delicious although I think because they are so small, they are unable to make substitutions for allergies like nuts.  They will just tell you which dishes you can't have.  The beet dish and the blueberry dessert were my favorites from my meal.   The beets were interesting because it was fresh beets with thinly sliced frozen beets on top...I also felt like it was a bit slow paced.  My boyfriend was annoyed because it was 4 courses and it took 2 hours.  My friends enjoyed the drinks."}, {"review_id": "xRX9f1zi9XOM-PyI7he6cg", "user_id": "-CA2Pqp0WtLZ7zXZscgOEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "If you're looking for a big steakhouse meal, this isn't your spot.

This was one of my most favorite meals that I have had. I love the concept of the restaurant, with seating around a U-shaped bar, minimal yet comfortable. There wasn't a dish we didn't like, from the complimentary appetizer to the dessert and the surprise whoopie pies. I'm not a dessert person but I think the blueberry dessert was my favorite dish, with the squid dish a close second.

You must eat here!! You can tell they put thought into everything. The awesome music, cozy ambience, unique and intimate seating, beautiful plating, and attentive service. I love how low key great this restaurant is. Everything is simple yet amazing. They do seafood, broth/sauce and vegetables really well. The raw shrimp was super fresh and tender. The sauce is really flavorful and brings out the freshness of the ingredients. The squash was surprisingly good- lots of umami flavor ! I loved the broth they pour on top. The rock crab is cooked well. We loved the crunch of the almonds on the bottom- adds texture to the dish. The fluke's broth was amazing!! One of my favorites. The fish skin, sake, and leek broth was the star. The duck was delicious as well. When you bite into the duck it just juices with flavor. The way they cooked it made for a very interesting but good texture. Loved the crunch of the caramel on the bottom of the blueberry dessert. Interesting play with textures between the plump fresh blueberries, freeze dry ones and the sorbet. The raspberry dessert was amazing as well."}, {"review_id": "jCVJfR73cU02viJtc54Cpw", "user_id": "8SWzZu538UphJneld3L1Qg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "The best restaurant I have visited in a very long time.

Think of Birch as an uber upscale hole in the wall restaurant - it only seats 18 around a U shaped bar but the food is out of this world! So here's the breakdown of my experienceFood: We all know the taste of the food is only half the battle as presentation is the other half. Well let me tell you, the taste of the food may be amazing to begin with but the chefs here go above and beyond with presentation too. Every dish is a delicate piece of art with so much attention to detail that you'd think Picasso's back there himself. Seriously though, check out the pictures. Tasteful is an understatement. Dish recommendations? For the first course, I had the lobster dish but I had some of my girlfriends cucumber dish and man oh man, the cucumber wins - gotta have it. As for main course I had the Duck and my girlfriend the cabbage which were both superb. For dessert I got the sweeter dish, the Strawberry, while my girlfriend for the more savory one, the Rhubard. (Yes, we took advantage of being able to share to enjoy the best of both world duhh)Service: Super attentive staff that's always there for when you need them. Then again they can't really get away from you when no matter where they stand at the bar they're within 5 feet of you haha. But nonetheless, they present every dish and tell you exactly what it is. Do I understand half of it? Nope. Do I care? Nope because it was all phenomenal! Ambiance: Contemporary. Modern. And a touch of old school with the exposed brick. Overall a very tasteful warm cozy environment. I'd actually recommend a later dinner in the summers so you can enjoy the ambiance when it's dark outside and the lights can do their magic inside. Long story short, you won't and can't be disappointed here. Go in and go on a journey that'll take your tastebuds to places they've never been and then bring you back with a classic whoopie pie at the end - you know, just to \"cleanse your palate\""}, {"review_id": "SaxswIm9MnX0ELy5NZa91A", "user_id": "OuhCjRJVkP6dQijSYq5wmA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "I went there around the beginning time. a 4 course menu i think. tons of savors. made me think of Aster here in San Francisco and a high-end Columbian restaurant in Miami I fell into serendipitously, both at their beginning time. don't expect to see the animal or the vegetal in the dish but the flavors of them. satisfactory taste buds but hungry stomach. still Kudo to it! service was intimate with an U-shape bar. wine was good too. would come back to see how it's evolved."}, {"review_id": "MVo3xw_G4B6XWL7qH6D_xQ", "user_id": "QtMzzKkj6et2khsVEb7Sqg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner and of course it was AMAZING.

With its beautiful sea and charming New England vibe, Rhode Island is certainly a place worth visiting for a weekend getaway if you live in New York City. I was also excited to try a couple of restaurants on my radar in Providence, which is where we all ended up staying for the night. Among them is birch, a restaurant from chef Ben Sukle that features seasonal tasting menus at bargain prices (originally at $49 for four course menu, now up at $55 when I visited). The moment we stepped into the intimate tasting counter with dim lights on the ceiling, I knew there would be something special going on at the kitchen. And yes, birch delivered in terms of offering sophisticated but not over-the-top dishes that were overall very well-balanced. Jun and I shared our dishes so we got to sample eight dishes (there was also an amuse bouche and a complementary dessert at the end). I liked the way the kitchen was delivering elevated dishes in a seemingly effortless way; I didn't see the kitchen over-doing things by mixing in some fancy ingredients or employing over-the-top techniques. Rather, the freshness of ingredients and the careful attention to the way they interact with one another define birch's direction. I liked the raw lobster with nasturtium and unripe blueberry that was quite fitting for a dish to kick off the meal, and the cucumber with pistachio and fennel that Jun ordered also had a complexity of flavor that gave a lot of pleasant sensation to my palate. For the second dishes, I was a huge fan of lightly warmed tomato with shellfish broth underneath; it was quite astounding in its texture and temperature that I think I could've enjoyed another slice. On the other hand, Jun's rock crab with almond and green peppercorn was probably the weakest dish of the night; not that it was bad, but it was difficult to remember anything special about it. Jun and I have had plenty of delicious duck dishes, but the smoky feel of the grilled Rhode Island duck with chicories, bread, cherry and black garlic was something else. The texture of the meat was more or less perfect, and worked quite harmoniously with lightly grilled cabbage with sweet potato, caramelized sauerkraut, toasted seeds and a broth of dried apples, offering a variety of flavors and textures that would stand on its own compared to the other fine-dining establishments in New York City. For desserts, I slightly preferred the fresh blueberry, which Jun had ordered, over the strawberry one that I had decided to get. Strawberry dessert with beach rose and locust flower fermented honey was certainly delicious but somewhat predictable, while I didn't expect the fresh blueberry to work so well with the caramelized cream that added another layer of flavor to the fruit.     The counter at the restaurant seats only around 18 people, so booking in advance is always recommended, although the turnover was fairly quick for a tasting-menu only establishment. There is full bar with wine selections more oriented toward the organic / natural side (one thing I wasn't happy about, as anyone who reads my reviews knows by now about my aversion to these varieties). The intimate experience at birch means it will be a perfect venue for a casual date night or impressing an out-of-town friend or family member. Birch is definitely a restaurant not to be missed while you are in Rhode Island. Its understated sophistication and dedication to seasonality reflected through the daily changing dishes will make it worthwhile stopping by in Providence even though Newport and other seaside towns in the state may offer more fun."}, {"review_id": "2p2FLOxxMIH2-OLOpY5Pcw", "user_id": "VYuuNzTWju8D0rr8SvaZjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/22/2017", "text": "Everyone knows that travelling is mostly about eating in a new city. When I saw the reviews of birch in my planning for Providence I knew I had to get a reservation. I have done more than a few prix fixe menus in my day. Based on the value and the quality of the experience, this place really shines. I had a Scarborough as my cocktail to start. It was DEVINE! One of the best craft cocktails I've had. The amuse bouche of an asparagus something or other was a great palate cleanser. The bread course was also worth the extra couple dollars. The salted butter was so fresh, sweet and salty and the bread was artisan - almost nutty flavor and perfectly crusty. I started with the beets while my boyfriend did the raw lobster. I've never encountered a beet I didn't like and this was no different. My boyfriend liked his lobster. Second course of celeriac for me was really good. I don't think I have ever had this before and I will have to figure out how to make it in some form at home because, yum! The boyfriend enjoyed his crab but didn't rave about it. I thought it tasted pretty good myself. I opted for the Black Bass as my 3rd course. O.M.G - Black Bass... where have you been all my life. I cannot more highly recommend this. I am not a big fish eater but this was just mouth watering-ly good. I hear the duck was good - I can't get down with duck so I have to take the BF word for it. The only drawback was my 4th course, cheese. It was what I was expecting but unfortunately the flavor and the smell were a little off putting to me. That being said, the server offered something in it's place and took the price off the check when I said I was \"ok\". There wasn't anything wrong with it. I just didn't like it and I appreciate him going the extra mile to make it right. That being said, the Strawberry dessert that my boyfriend had was delicious and I was happy to share it with him. I highly recommend this to foodies in the area. You will not be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "llAmgFwdNW-VmCkVSAlH_g", "user_id": "oEc_SC6UIXr1SvYtL4C6SQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/10/2017", "text": "A fine dining experience as I have never experienced before. I took my boyfriend out to eat as a special treat and was not disappointed. The intimate U shaped bar could seat about 15-18 guests in a small, dimly lit room with the bar in the middle. The menu consists of four small courses with selections of which you pick one each. We did the tasting along with the meal which was a neat way to try new wines and spirits that matched perfectly with the meal. There is an optional bread course which I would also recommend as the bead is home baked and delicious!

If you have, you must tell others and if you haven't, you must go. It is a true dining experience that is to be had.Went there on a Thursday night without any reservations (please do make reservations). I was lucky enough to get a seat in the next half hour. There's limited seating (about 15 to 20 maybe), all around the bar.It is a 4 course meal for 49$, and they bring out extra dishes from the chef along with that. It is a tasting menu, so portions are on the smaller size yet filling. They change one food item every week, so every month or two, their menu changes completely and it is based on what's being produced for that time of the year.I had the raw scallops, clams on a broccoli purée and the lamb along with a blueberry dessert. They obviously provide a more detailed explanation of the different ingredients but that's all that I can remember because the food looked really good.All of the dishes I got were amazing. I liked the lamb the most because it surprised me. Initially I felt it might be a little too rare but it was perfectly cooked and the sauce and salad pairing was delicious!They do have vegetarian options and can do a vegan version, just has to be said in advance. Overall it was a 5 star dining experience and would definitely go back there again. Just try to make reservations!
