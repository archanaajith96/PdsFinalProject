The broth was clear and somewhat tasty, but not as flavorful as truly authentic Japanese ramen. I ordered Shoyu Original with $7.50 per bowl and was surprised when it came out. First time I've seen green beans in my ramen, maybe this is a style from a different region of Japan that I was not used to.

I swear my bf and I thought we smoked before dinner or something This place is totally overrated. Maybe it's because I ordered vegetarian but man idk. Who the heck would pay 1.75 for ONE slice of pork belly? Am I too LA here or is this some kind of joke? Anyway I can't imagine the broth being that good after what I've tried- vegetarian miso extra spicy. There was no spice. I kept taking huge slurps of noodles hoping my next bite would be better but each bite was a disappointment. Their veggie stir fry was pretty good though. But I'm pretty sure it's also due to the MSG. If you're vegetarian- EASY PASS, but honestly even if I wasn't one I probably wouldn't ever bother coming back"}, {"review_id": "WtzFPBr3QSnx4eBMi1u6qA", "user_id": "BwMFjg6ObulLocmfN-mqxA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/9/2017", "text": "Service: 5/5Food & Drink: 4.5/5Appearance & Atmosphere: 3.5/5 I admit that my love of this place may be enhanced by the fact that I don't have much experience with even somewhat decent ramen restaurants, but this was a truly wonderful visit leading to delectable food which was promptly served. There are quite a few negative reviews regarding the time it took for food to come out, but perhaps this has been improved, as it was quite busy when I came yet I ordered quickly and only waited ten minutes maximum for my food to arrive. The inside of the restaurant is hip and well-lighted, with some posters very suited to the environment, although there was a little less seating and decor than preferable. The table I sat at was still quite dirty when I arrived there, however, and there were no employees who appeared to be cleaning tables off, which was a negative for me.The outside was nice and clean, and the store hours were very clear and in large words on a creative sign in the front, which was an extra little plus in my book. The service here was my favorite part nonetheless (and that's saying something!) Each employee was quirky, engaging, had a good sense of urgency and a genuine knack for customer service. The man who took my order was particularly fun, helpful and didn't once lose his smile and positivity. Every other employee was also unshakably kind and good at what they did, which truly added to my enjoyment of this establishment. I ordered a fairly basic ramen bowl and it was absolutely mouthwatering. The noodles were perfectly cooked and each individual flavor shined through deliciously while they all combined with each other in wonderful, foodie harmony. My only objection is that the pork which came in my ramen was a tad dry and gristly, but that could have simply been a one time thing. Overall a lovely place for lunch, dinner or any other time you feel like eating something amazing and interacting with some wonderful employees. 10/10 would recommend far above any ramen you can buy at your local grocery store ;)"}, {"review_id": "29IxnZZtZyuXzdGSLC5NYQ", "user_id": "DqWLwSYQk903Y0Rn1WWSZQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "Toshi's is an excellent example of an establishment that garners unjustified support from locals who likely have not had better (or even other) executions of similar food elsewhere. I would know, because I used to be one of them. Ramen has quickly become one of my favorite foods to go out of my way to get when I'm in a city that has several ramen shops to choose from. I am in no way an expert or authority when it comes to ramen; I just really like ramen. Compared to ramen shops in larger cities (Portland, Seattle, New York, etc.), Toshi's offers a very \"safe\" take on ramen that seems especially tailored to the Eugene palate. For one, unlike practically every other ramen shop I've been to, they don't offer soft boiled eggs with their ramen. The pork is without question the worst pork I've had while eating ramen; rather than tender, fatty rounds of pork belly, Toshi's offers a single, flavorless, lean cut of pork (chop? loin?) with their ramen. Then there's the canned corn, no fermented bamboo shoots, etc. The soups themselves are quite light (especially for me, since I prefer rich tonkotsu ramen most of the time). Whether you get shoyu, miso, or shio, they're all tame, safe interpretations of what they could be. I will give them credit for their house-made noodles though. It's a shame that they often serve them to you when they're already beginning to overcook in the soup. Also, pro-tip: don't get ramen to go. Ever. Back to my initial point, I think that Toshi's is the kind of place people think serves good ramen when they haven't actually had good ramen. I can't blame them though; you don't know about what you haven't experienced, so you can't really compare. However, once you have good (insert literally anything here), it's almost impossible not to use that new experience as a basis for comparison. Toshi's is bad, plain and simple. Here in Eugene, I think Toshi's has gotten the acclaim it has because it has gone uncontested for so long. It was the de facto best ramen in Eugene because it was the only ramen in Eugene. Hopefully that will start to change.Edit: Also, please consider not hiring the most obnoxiously spaced out hippies to manage the register. The guy today with a bandana and mini-braids chugging water out of a giant glass jug balanced on his shoulder while helping a customer looked like he got lost between a gluten free yoga class and band practice for his reggae themed Korn cover band."}, {"review_id": "pAm9US53xfyR5VSCCoLwvw", "user_id": "I2zcNlcm2YO5FuCiZbqMCQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "11/13/2017", "text": "I cam here on a Saturday morning to see if their ramen could curb some of my hunger. Parking was easy and the location was simply found off the main drag. Many college students were around the area, but few were visiting Toshi's. I came up to find a moderately busy restaurant, with a very slow crawl into the ordering line. There was one cashier who was kind, but very slow. It was not a welcome sight as people grew frustrated in line, and gazes at tables nearby seemed to show a similar sign. The menu, as expansive as it could be, was fairly confusing to the average viewer and didn't offer many options in terms of broth. This was incredibly disappointing, as ramen places I go to typically offer a pork, chicken, and vegetarian broth. I also could not believe that the ramen recipes had corn in them. That was odd.I ended up ordering teriyaki chicken, as all the broth was pork based. It took about 10-15 minutes to receive the order, and I oddly found my rice to be a bit cold and chicken cutlets to be rather fatty than meaty. I was truly disappointed. I don't think I'll be back here anytime soon, and hope that they look to change their menu."}, {"review_id": "-iS4wNQHiXjOEvQwLdVPnA", "user_id": "4e1mxiHV-yf_JajdyIIL0Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I am always skeptical about new places to try ramen.

Being from San Francisco and having the luxury of trying many different ramen spots from SF and the rest of the Bay Area, the bar is set pretty high. I'm sorry to say that Toshi's did not even come close to the bar. I ordered the corn nin-niku with a spicy miso broth at the suggestion from the man behind the counter. The corn nin-niku ramen comes with all of the toppings that the original ramen has (green onion, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, green beans, and one slice of marinated pork) but has extra corn and fresh puréed garlic. Where's the nori? Where's the wakame seaweed? Where's the kikurage mushroom? And most importantly, where's the soft boiled egg?? All of these staple ramen toppings were nowhere to be found! When the bowl arrived, I could already tell it wasn't going to be very good. Unfortunately, I was right. Broth was bland even with the spiciness added. The ramen noodles were very mushy. The cha shu (which is the marinated pork previously mentioned) was most certainly not marinated. Again, it was very bland, dry, looked like it had been boiled. Definitely not the tender, fatty, and rich like how it's supposed to be. One star for the friendly service and another star for having a very clean bathroom. I'm sorry to say that I will not be returning to this establishment. It's simply not worth the money even though it's quite affordable.

Just the broth is so good I could literally just drink this stuff. I'm a big fan of the Miso Wakame ramen and am such a sucker for their potstickers--pan seared just right. Only reason I'm giving this 4/5 stars is because they have a fairly slow reputation so you can be waiting for quite a while before you get served.
