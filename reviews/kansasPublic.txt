We had a few IPAs and sours on draft, and all were fantastic. We also shared the pork belly, which was the star of the meal by far. I highly recommend it!For entrees, we had two steaks and a burger. I am removing one star for the steak. It was bland. The presentation was beautiful, but the seasoning was disappointing and it was dry. The burger, on the other hand, was delicious and juicy.The kids meals were also a bit hard to eat. We were with two kids, 5 and 7, and they could not eat the brisket tacos. Too chewy. Otherwise, highly recommended!"}, {"review_id": "wWxK7CvGviXox1VSwish3Q", "user_id": "ZuU3rtnAEuurllxmF2uvnQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Great place to go if youre looking for somewhere to drink, socialize, or have a first date. Its a partly underground, dim lighted, hipster type pub in Old Town. From the outside you would think its really small but once you go inside its actually quite large. They have a bar in the middle and plenty of tables and chairs (kid friendly, probably not late at night though). Definitely not a place to go if you are looking for a big meal. The menu is small (and pricey) and the portions are snack sized. Very good food however! Their house fries have garlic and fresh rosemary served with three sauces (cumin ketchup, regular ketchup, and a grainy mustard). We also got a Mediterranean plate and bone in wings which were also really good. If youre looking for a nice hang out spot in downtown Wichita this is definitely a place worth trying out."}, {"review_id": "-AvZ6Lj4kIpuWvawpuuO_Q", "user_id": "bygcf8KCjLoYPxWm2G3tNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "One of the best hidden gems in Wichita.   Very interesting atmosphere, as it is a basement.

But, I must say, if you don't like chewy dough you probably should steer clear. As for me, I love it, so it was perfect. I don't usually like sausage, but the lamb sausage was mild and appetizing. I ordered this to split with a side of sweet potato fries (just because yum!) They came out kind of \"soft,\" not really crispy, but the waitress had asked our preference prior so if you prefer them crispy be sure to ask for them that way. I didn't care really, so I thought they were great as is. They had a hint of rosemary flavor which gave them just that little \"extra\" but of yum Our waitress was really pleasant. She was friendly and helpful, so I appreciated the service as well.

This place is smashing! Amazing food (what I have tried, which admittedly is limited), great signature drinks, terrifically friendly staff and fellow patrons, and world class all-day-long-patio potential. In fact, I spent about 5 hours on it my first leisurely Saturday afternoon here.We came with the hound, after brunch at a supremely mediocre chain restaurant, and it was marvelously relaxed and unbusy on their cool, shady patio. I nibbled enthusiastically on my friends green beans (they're apparently legendary around these parts, and rightly so) and the table's fries. Wow. Didn't try the entrees myself, but these sides are fiiiiiiiiine. We drank and we gabbed and everyone was so friendly and the prices so easy to absorb. It was a great afternoon in a really enjoyable, unique environment that was designed by some extremely creative restaurateurs. I'm not even going to tell you the kooky details because it was so cool to experience it without expectations. Just go. 5 stars all day long. Thanks for cultivating gastropubbery in Wichita!"}, {"review_id": "9UlJ763eqynu7tuBmb8XkQ", "user_id": "xjGlDn8juvva9IMrEeRn6Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/13/2017", "text": "I have visited Public a dozen times over the past year going back and forth between Wichita and San Francisco. I will give it a 3 star, although each visit alternates between 2 and 3 stars, with the occasional 4.Location and decor: 4.5 stars.

The bar is well stocked and bartenders know how to mix good cocktails.Service: 4.5 stars. The folks are friendly and attentive.Food: 2-3. The menu is tired. Especially when you don't have specials, the menu needs to rotate more often. Since I have been coming here in March of 2016 the menu has not changed. At all. Same choices. Every. Single. Time.  How often am I going to have the filet stacked on a bed of greens. Or the pizzas. Or the cauliflower appetizer. Or, or, or.  The quality is OK, it's decent food, but a bit on the pricey side for a Wichita, KS.  Yet I still come here maybe once a quarter - mostly because it is on OpenTable (note to the vast majority of restaurants in Wichita that are not on OpenTable: if you signed up for it, we would come).Wine list: 1 star: it is non-existent.  Need to address."}, {"review_id": "H38B9TVn2OC-AP58sLtbow", "user_id": "rozGL4hLXo4TWAW_sWu8Nw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/23/2017", "text": "Rabit sausage and pork belly appetizers along with the corn bread were phenomenal!!  Unfortunately, our entrees took a long time to come out and were heat lamp stale by the time we got them, so disappointing.   Saturday night, very busy, food execution lacked consistency and final execution.  Bar service was better than table service, serious lack of service consistency.  The caesar salads were bland and seemed as if they'd sat too long as well (soft lettuce).  Overall, the crowd and environment is fun and inviting but the food consistency just not up to it's potential.  Finally, they added an 18% gratuity to our party of 6.  What?!  Maybe at an upscale restaurant,  not worthy and definitely a grab-it attitude.  No thanks."}, {"review_id": "z39sxrUGIHtPCP_ay6Uh4Q", "user_id": "ddeQSPVUQLsr93Hwhd3DDQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/27/2017", "text": "I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 3 because the location was just too cool!

As others have stated, there's a lot to love about Public. The ambiance -- a cozy, cool basement area with fun decorations. The location -- right in the heart of Old Town. The food -- inventive farm-fresh menu with something to please everyone, from vegetarians to picky meat eaters. The drinks -- unique cocktails that are worth visiting for all on their own.I had some beef sliders and a meat/cheese/pickle tray. Everything was delicious. Those pickles though. Damn. I still think about them to this day. They reminded me of the ones my great aunts would make from their farm gardens.

Our party of four was impressed with the friendliness and Midwest American sensibilities of the staff, all of whom were informative and helpful. The beer selection was quite impressive and varied, a nice surprise for our jaunt into Old Town. We partook in a sumptuous pork belly with squash purée and peanuts to start. The steak burgers at the table were good particularly accompanied by the non-crispy sweet potato fries or creamy potato salad. Another entree enjoyed was the sliders of buffalo and beef along with green beans that not a string was left behind. The meatloaf special was thought to be a bit disappointing however - a bit too salty and dry. However this was made up for a check in related discount on a dessert - a fantastic orange-apricot creme brûlée.
