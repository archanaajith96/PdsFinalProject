Their lunch menu is just a great, with a wider variety of options!For brunch, Kelsay and I like to fulfill our sweet-tooths so we always opt for something with syrup. This trip I got the classic french toast, which you just can't beat! You get a choice of sausage (turkey or pork) or bacon, but i decided to substitute that for the potato cheese casserole. The french toast was delicious and the casserole, although a little small, hit the spot. Kelsay went for the banana pecan pancakes which are HUGE. The pancakes aren't just topped with banana and pecan but the actual pancakes are filled with both! Talk about a meal! Although we didn't get pictures of it, we also got the famous pimento cheese and pita chips to go. Listen... that combo alone is enough to take a trip to Di'Pratos. It should almost be illegal to go there and NOT get them. Just give them a try, and check Di'Pratos out on our instagram @redplatespecial !"}, {"review_id": "I9Cdp1rKfYPlvg3E2kLQPw", "user_id": "0VyDSM1uIrTU8LfaFh8JdA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/22/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The location ofthe finest pimiento cheesein the multiverse."}, {"review_id": "E1F9HAoHTWMXKBmtm-b6kg", "user_id": "ojK9H_K7ljlssxtDNcVg_g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/13/2017", "text": "This was a great stop in Columbia! I had their triple decker, corned beef Reuben and it was super, duper, über, mega awesome! That rye bread, Swiss cheese and that delish beef made for a combo well worth having. Finger licking good! One of my friends had that same Reuben and he was loving it as much as I was and the other friend destroyed the BLT with the speed and determination of a man who'd been living off MRE's for the last year. He actually said \"Thank you pig, for your delicious sacrifice!\" I told him \"the pig, probably didn't have a choice\"Topped off the lunch with a delicious cannoli and called it a day. I would definitely go back."}, {"review_id": "CvrGM20SFA-hwujiefTLwQ", "user_id": "9ZH1_g2MKBizw6aM3BWhQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/14/2017", "text": "Brunch best of Columbia for sure! When I'm in town I make this my breakfast spot. They open at 10 am which makes my early bird heart content. Service is quick and the servers are always friendly. It is a very cozy restaurant with floral arrangements and a deli counter. At the counter you can order sides and salads and most importantly pimiento cheese. Don't leave here without the pimiento cheese and the hot pita chips. Now for bunch our table shared the sweet potato pancakes and I ordered the western omelet. The sweet potato pancakes were fluffy and covered in candied pecans. They came with turkey sausage which is definitely homemade. The western omelet is a family favorite. My dad and I always get this one. It is stuffed with ham, green peppers, red peppers, onions. I get mine with grits or you can get the hams brown casserole. It also comes with toast or biscuits but I ask for fruit instead and there has never been an up charge. Brunch best of Columbia and don't you forget it."}, {"review_id": "XRXMT1RRSqYVVlPK-rUb3Q", "user_id": "11JA9uUiti8kiDQ-_6U4yg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I have never liked pimento cheese until I had it at brunch here!

Anyone would be able to find something they like here. I came here with my brother and boyfriend and it was in a convenient location for USC students living in Bates and Cliff. It was in walking distance--can't be beat. Service was efficient and food came out fast. I ordered the Prosciutto Ham on a Multigrain Ciabatta. The sandwich had a balanced portion of prosciutto, mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil. For a side, I ordered pasta salad. Nothing special or out of the ordinary, but it was a nice choice. I had a couple bites of the Philly Beef and Cheese Sandwich and it was tasty and notably not greasy. If you're looking for a solid place to eat lunch around the area, this is your best bet."}, {"review_id": "vgm1AAuzps6Fwp7Mz90n6g", "user_id": "X8D0H673TMJTfZK6LOr_dQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "Bets lunch spot in town.

Only open for lunch and brunch. They also have a deli counter and seem to do loads of take out food. They have a parking lot but it can fill up on the weekend and during the lunch rush. I've had panini's, pimento cheese and eggs here. All are fresh made and consistently wonderful. They have deserts that are great as well. Their specialty is pimento cheese and pita chips, get them as an appetizer or as your main course. Prices are average about 10 to 13 per person, well worth it. Come early they fill up fast. I go every time I visit Columbia."}, {"review_id": "m0oIkWNTDqs-CJcm6AQ-8A", "user_id": "yFkdWYXBvceIVoghnNSgFg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "In the many many years I have been going here, never once have I been disappointed in the service or food.   I love this place so much I drive from irmo just to get take out.   I always start off with the warm deliciously greasy pita chips to use with the more than amazing original pimento cheese.  Now, don't get me wrong the others are great too, the white cheddar, etc.  But I just know a good thing and stick with it.  Also,  the pasta is a must.  I have been trying to copycat it for years  ....I feel like I am 70% there.  But mine will never be as good.  I always get the same thing every single stinking time.  The 3 pepper panini.  Oh dear gosh, The warm melty gooey cheese and the basil and the pesto mayo....it all just melts in your mouth.  Be careful...your whole guts of your sandwich tend to slide out.  There are so many delicious things.  I usually try a couple of small takeaways to try at home.  But I always always take home extra pimento cheese and pasta.  Oh get there early ....this place gets jammed packed!!!"}, {"review_id": "1x5-tnwmEkx0EF-HfHGPig", "user_id": "9pPs-H-YPqmmyfWx0QU4tQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Seriously - my mouth is watering while I am starting to write this review.

Can you say Reuben? Absolute best in town, probably in the state. Buttery, crisp grilled marble rye with loads of tender corned beef, a generous amount of crisp kraut, a dollop of thousand island and great service to boot. Average chips, good tea with clean urns. Overall cost is high, but the atmosphere on most days is upper echelon yuppie with expensive casual dress. Buy some deli items on the way out and you'll be glad you did. Some eclecticity, basic upscale deli."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/di-pratos-columbia?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
