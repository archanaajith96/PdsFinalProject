We stopped in to the market for a snack after exploring the Red Rocks Open Space and we were thoroughly impressed. Such a beautiful building inside. The market options were plentiful and the dessert case was like a work of art. The incredibly friendly ladies helping us let little Mr. baby blue eyes talk them into a free mini cupcake. They couldn't have been sweeter to him.  They put it in a little clear container so he could see it and hold it. He didn't let go of it through our entire lunch on the patio. He devoured it, as we devoured our Boston Cream Cake. We saved our Tiger peanut butter cookie sandwich for later and loved loved loved it.  Next trip we'll certainly make this little gem of a place a top priority on our list!"}, {"review_id": "XupgxJXkhOcilfO47NMnmA", "user_id": "Md_8xUc4MF8VA56zm5FK_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "I've heard about this place for a long time but never got to try it until recently. It's very popular on the weekends so there will be a wait (unless you go before 9:00 or after 1:00, I heard the host say) but that's ok because you can walk back to the market and browse there and probably have yummy samples too!I loved how bright the restaurant is, and it wasn't as loud as I thought it would be. The menu is interesting with good ingredients and my friends and I all enjoyed our food. My friend adored her croissant breakfast sandwich! I ordered the mini donut holes for us and they were warm and really yummy and came with a super tasty raspberry jam dipping sauce. My turkey cranberry sandwich was good. I was bummed that the tomato soup was cheesy- I was not expecting that and I'm not a fan of cheese but my other friend was thrilled that his was cheesy so I'm sure it's a popular choice. Our server was a little distant and maybe even dismissive, but the people at the host station and in the market in the back made up for that- they were lovely.I was so happy to find that I could get a free dessert with lunch with a Yelp check in- and it wasn't a little small taste of dessert either- I got a huge piece of delicious cake! It was caramel apple cake and it was incredible- I went back the following week to get another piece but they rotate their cake options and they didn't have it any more so I got the lemon strawberry cake and that was also very good. The cakes are refrigerated so if you wait a little while to eat it the buttercream frosting will be perfectly creamy. I bought my husband a tiger sandwich cookie and the woman was kind enough to wrap it up for him with a ribbon which I thought was a really thoughtful and sweet touch. He loved the cookie! (Tiger butter is peanut butter mixed with white chocolate ganache, I discovered.) I tried the chocolate mousse too which was good. Their dessert selection is excellent and they all look beautiful too. I was really impressed with their refrigerator and freezer cases full of food to take home- I got some chicken salad which was really good but they also have things like lasagna and other meals to take home. I was captivated by their selection of frozen pies and will definitely be back to try their peach almond pie which looks amazing (but you have to buy a whole pie- no slices). They had a bunch of items on their shelves that are almost all local from Colorado- I sampled and then bought some really good peanut butter and jelly. I like that the market is open until 5:00 on the weekends (though the cafe closes earlier). Two weeks in a row I went hiking at Red Rock Canyon Open Space and on the way back stopped at the market to bring some treats home. :) This is a great place and I highly recommend both the cafe and market!"}, {"review_id": "PRLAnc45sFEH8F1dMnas1A", "user_id": "9ZRIhnFYUklkYY5NPT_BVg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "This restaurant is a gem on one of the main roads in town, near Old Colorado City, the Broadmoor and within short driving distance of Garden of the Gods park. The service is always top notch, friendly and fast. The food is hard to beat in regards to taste, presentation and ability to fill you up, especially for the price! They do get busy at times, especially on the weekend, but it is worth the wait or you can come during the week and enjoy the restaurant at a less busy time. If you enjoy organic foods...and desserts...there is a small are to pick up some of your favorite items as well.

Very clean, nicely decorated with a great bakery and good selection of to-go meals in the market section. I had the pear quinoa salad with chicken that was pretty good, it didn't blow my mind but was fresh and tasty. I loved the short daily menu, breakfast all day is something I'll go back for :). I didn't have dessert but I did get a cookie sample that was crazy good.

The menu had multiple items that I would have loved to try, but we were only visiting from out of town.   I ordered the caramel seasonal coffee drink and my husband ordered the black widow.  Both tasted amazing! The caramel wasn't over done, and the black widow alcohol wasn't too strong (or too weak!).I only would deduct 0.5 star because the bacon in the Southern Eggs Benedict was a bit too tough to cut and bite through, and as strange as it sounds, did ruin the meal for me a bit because I couldn't get a taste of everything in one bite. Other than that one thing, it was a really great place to eat and I would go back again if I returned to the area."}, {"review_id": "19yPa8ky6hAtRdKfhr5YsA", "user_id": "zGHogojxcWihoetc3eogCg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "We stopped in here for lunch to take a break from day soaking in the tubs at Sunwater Spa. It was pretty busy which was expected since it was a Sunday afternoon but the wait for 6 people only took about 15 minutes. In the meantime, we went back and looked at their bakery and market area in the back which was filled with lots of stuff to buy and take home. The fridges are stocked with ready-to-eat food prepared in the back which I didn't get to try but I heard was also amazing. The dessert case was full of VERY reasonably priced desserts and pastries (if you check in on Yelp, you get $3 off!). I picked up a ganache brownie and a lemon coconut tart for later. We were then called for our table and sat down. We were greeted by the server who was very friendly and attentive during our entire visit. She recommended a couple of things but most of us had already been starving and knew what we wanted. The entire table shared the spinach artichoke dip, hummus, and an order of the donut holes. The donut holes were AH-MAZING. They tasted fresh out of the fryer and came with a raspbery jam that complimented it really well. For the main entree, I shared a BLT sandwich with my sister. I'm glad I shared because the bacon pieces here are THICK! Half of the sandwich was very filling on its own and if you add bacon to a burger, you're getting a thick cut as well. The fries are absolutely addicting and it also came with this peppered aoili that I am now convinced is made with crack from how good it is. I recommend coming early on the weekends even if you have to wait a few minutes. The staff is great, food is amazing, and the entire place is just too cute to pass up."}, {"review_id": "qypxlCLYuq68pUf1O_WoJw", "user_id": "0aztzgAknbgjUQDr-AEESA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "If you've eaten at Till, you'll recognize the same vibes here. Never let all the cars in the parking lot fool you - lots of seating available. Ambiance is bright and perfect for breakfast. We're locals and rarely have to wait - even on weekends. They have amazing homemade jams and delicious gluten free toast! Our favorites: Mountain Man Hash and the Farmers Breakfast. The leek hash browns are mighty tasty - different and delicious. Service is friendly and spot on.

I had just completed the Incline and figured I'd swing by to quench my thirst with a fresh squeezed juice. I came in during a busy brunch rush but figured a juice to go wouldn't take too long. 15 minutes after placing my order I was still waiting so I asked an employee if she could let me know how much longer it'd be. I was hot, sweaty and felt like my sugar was dropping. Pretty sure I had a resting bitch face as well. She came back and said their juicer went down. Again, I'd just finished this crazy workout and couldn't keep waiting so I asked for a refund. I had to wait a few minutes for a manager to come. Now, you may be wondering why I'd still give this place 5 stars. The manager acknowledged that she saw me waiting a while. She kindly apologized and gave me my money back. I was happy with that but she proceeded to give me a gift card. THAT, ladies and gentlemen is what amazing customer service is all about.**Update** It was my first time back since my last review. We don't live in the area so I wanted to check the market out. It was mid afternoon and for a few minutes I was the only customer. As I browsed the baked goods, more people came in. I stood there waiting to pick out my items. A guy figured he'd cut me in line. Ok. Whatever. Not GoG's fault. But it took OVER 20 minutes for someone to come pick the desserts I wanted. No apologies from staff this time. I had picked out some other items and the lady only noticed that I'd put them back when she was checking me out. It's disappointing to see that other employees don't step in to assist customers when the only person working in the market is at the register. The restaurant was empty and people were just standing around. Poor customer service irks me but I maintain the 4 star rating because their products somewhat make up for it."}, {"review_id": "zFehHxbXHclNqHkWuyjsUw", "user_id": "D86PQC8O4rIZ5Cuc1BkMPg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "Delightful and perhaps surprising BRUNCH find in Colorado Springs!Don't be fooled by the unassuming exterior of what actually waits inside.... a market, bakery and florist of local makers --not to mention the fresh tastes offered on the cafe menu... all paints a very Colorado experience:)While waiting we ordered delicious mimosas and perused the market.... very nice!We were then seated near the front doors by the very kind and fresh staff (which I don't recommend that location as it was chilly and not as aesthetically pleasing as the other side of the restaurant).We started with fresh donut holes and raspberry jam... very nice little appetizer.I throughly enjoyed my brunch entree of , \"Avocado Toast\" with mashed avocado, spicy aioli, hard boiled egg, bacon and arugula... fresn'n fabulous!!! ...paired with the best grits I've had in a long time --and I'm a southern food aficionado-- grits with some amazing cheese(es), spices and Pueblo Green Chili...

My favorite breakfast item is the Huevos Rancheros, which I normally have never been a fan of, but here it's great. Comes with veggie green chili by default, but I get it with the pork green chili. My only compliant is the cost. Pretty expensive for West you get portionwise, but I get the food cost are probably higher than most places due to the quality abd freshness of it. However, $14 + $2 for Huevos Rancheros send a bit excessive. Add guacamole and you're looking at another $4 for a small serving. That said, the food is great, and I still recommend them, but probably for occasional visits unless you have money to burn."}, {"review_id": "BcrRB2QCLa9pzf0RmEoHUg", "user_id": "LNu_iHiaUAQtCL-tQESUTw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "Came here for Sunday brunch and was very pleased!

The menu has lots of tasty options, I plan to return to try them all. We perused the great market after lunch and ended up buying lots of good things, key lime tart that was amazing, and chocolate tart that was also good.
