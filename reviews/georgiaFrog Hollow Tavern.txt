Well that is me and Frog Hollow. Now let me be upfront about dress and price. This is not a place for even the most stylish of jeans to be worn or designer t-shirt. This is where you get fancy (at least nice khaki's fancy) and clean up for the evening. And when it comes to a budget, throw caution to the wind. You don't want to be asking the price of a recommended bottle of wine or glass of bourbon do you? But also know this, you get what you pay for.     This is farm-to-table so not only is the quality of preparation in the kitchen high, but the ingredients are top notch and seasonal. So no, you will not find a menu favorite still around 6 months later. But that's a good thing. Now there are a few staples that stick around, but for the most part it is a new offering for your taste buds every time.      Yes, there is outdoor seating. Do I recommend it? No. Currently there is a hotel being built next door (literally next door) and it is a busy section of Broad Street. Plus you want the climate control and lack of bugs anyway for such a meal. Your table will be waiting with cloth napkins, multiple forks and spoon, a water and wine glass already in place, and a team who are friendly and knowledge about everything being served.      Find an excuse to go here and then go. And don't have plans immediately afterwards. Let this meal take as long as you want it to take (about 2 hours) because you want to finish that wine and have room for dessert. Just trust me.*Insider's Tip-Make a reservation. I don't care if it's the middle of the week on the slowest month of the year. Make a reservation, or you will be waiting.-No matter what else you get, get the Gouda mac n cheese. You don't even have to be a fan of Gouda or mac n cheese to love this dish. It is delicious.-Bottles of wine can be bought to take home; whether you are dining there or not. So if you find something you like, take it with you!"}, {"review_id": "Xu5jLMVszHYFwK4R88N7rQ", "user_id": "06yIdOIAMTfV2wdrxmcSQA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Obviously its Masters week and everything is really busy.  We took a chance as a walk in. We gave our name and sat out front, ordered a drink and as luck would have it, we got a table half way through my drink.  They sat us in the front sort of bay window. Great table if you can get it. Their specialty is pork and the menu is as locally sourced as possible. We had the andoule sausage to start. Excellent. Then the pork shoulder and the grouper. Both excellent.  Their mac'n'cheese is as good as everyone says. Collard greens were also very good. No room for dessert.Great food, atmosphere, and our waiter Allan was so good it really just made everything better."}, {"review_id": "wHx2cXkmPxMjnz8J1guepw", "user_id": "LVzDzD3htr25ucp5Fq3taQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "Frog Hollow is my favorite restaurant in town. You have to have reservations if you want a table, but you may get bar seating if that works for you. I love everything I order, even when I'm not sure about it when ordering. You can literally close your eyes and point to a random spot on the menu and order whatever. It WILL be the best thing you ever ate. The drinks are fantastic. The Tavern Manhattan is one of the local favorites. The waiters are great at helping you match a wine to the meal. I usually order the fresh fish of the day or the pork chop, which are both amazing. I also love the broccoli bisque and the cauliflower bisque. All of the desserts are consistently great as well. I really don't have any criticisms."}, {"review_id": "hzFr8tIrJqojqiCFSBaj0g", "user_id": "HTKLFAN-nGMlKWIlAmUuzQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/7/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I have one thing to say.....

We decided on Frog Hollow Tavern and made reservations earlier that day. The only available reservation times on OpenTable were for later in the evening; we decided on 8:45.Upon arriving, we checked in with the hostess and she offered us a drink menu and to sit outside. At 9:00 we were seated. At the time I was a little upset that we had to wait 15 minutes past our reservation time but the food more than made up for it!Thinking that this was a fine dining type of restaurant, we were expecting the portions to be very small so we ordered three courses. This was way too much food and the portions were huge. To start, we ordered the muscles. They were delicious, then we moved onto the wedge salad which was phenomenal; the combination of blue cheese and bacon was to die for! For my entrée, the server talked me into trying the pork chop, I was happy I did. The meat was soaked in butter and so tender. The restaurant has a really fun vibe, it is very cozy and has an upscale feeling for being called a tavern. The service was wonderful; our server was so knowledgeable of the menu and spouted off all of the specials without reading any type of notes. She was adorable and genuinely sweet.Hailing from Portland, Maine, the farm to table concept really isn't new but I am glad that some restaurants in the CSRA are adopting this method. Frog Hollow used very fresh ingredients and the food really reflected that.Service: 5Food: 5Atmosphere: 5Cleanliness: 5Value: 5I will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "OrOKux4cNWvXqUPDtYygLw", "user_id": "bPQDYIFr1oJQhj6S4ZoEww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Took my wife to dinner last night for her birthday.  I'd totally give it 5 stars for the service, food (cowgirl rib eye, striped bass, Maine mussels and wedge lettuce), but the only downside is we got there about 20mind early and had a few drinks outside and during thst time we were hit up for money FOUR times.  I don't blame Frog Hollow per se, but if Augusta ever wants to make downtown cool, they have to fix this problem."}, {"review_id": "jFKUjB9DnPbFnLtyAc5FlQ", "user_id": "5HAFGFAnAqRc8sqCk1A8jA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "I looooooooove the macaroni and cheese.

Never have I been disappointed in anything off the menu but on a recent visit I ordered the \"deconstructed strawberry shortcake\"! It sounded delicious when the waitress described it but it was totally lacking in taste! Sliced strawberries on a smear of some grainy cream sauce with broken pieces the size of croutons of tasteless shortcake thrown on top! No whipped cream! Should have gone with the flourless cake or goat cheese cheesecake.  It was a messy presentation which would have not mattered if had tasted good but unfortunately, it did not!

Best food in Augusta. Their Mac&Cheese is personally my favorite I've ever had, and i think it would likely make most people's top three if they enjoy that dish generally. Oyster app special was awesome. Pork shoulder dish is highly recommended. Farm to table restaurant-- and the food is truly outstanding and cocktails are also phenomenal.

So we decided to try a few restaurants. On the last night we were tired but randomly decided to try Frog Hollow Tavern and boy did we make the right choice!They had a wide variety of drinks specials and fine bourbons. We relaxed outside until our table was ready. My fiancé and both got the pork chops, mac & cheese and coller greens. The pork chops are best in the country. I'm being serious when I say that. They also have the tastiest Mac'N'Cheese I can remember. It's made like a lasagna (hard to imagine) but trust me it's life changing. People rave about this place when they are in the restaurant. I over heard other people say the same thing we were thinking, \"this is the best meal I have had in last five years\". When people say those things in a restaurant and you here it from a couple people around you at different tables, you know you are at a special place.I hope everyone is lucky enough to try this place out!"}, {"review_id": "P2tcRrOvmxxB_CjJohASoQ", "user_id": "VV3DJa2FllO_k4IOknyN-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "I went last year and still wish to go back again!

We are really happy to finally knock this off the bucket list - but it was so good, I think this might be the first official bucket-list redo. We arrived at our specified reservation time and our table was ready right away. They say us at our table and our waiter was on us from the start. He did everything he should have done (explained the restaurant, their philosophy, and some brief history from rote memory). He took our drink order and away we went!Within 5 minutes he had explained, in detail the entire menu and we ordered. I will say the way they explain the menu may make you change your mind even after you think you've chosen from the menu. Be prepared for that!I ordered the scallops and pork chop. My wife ordered the pork shoulder. Both of them are heavily reviewed as awesome here on Yelp. Don't be surprised if you order the scallops and you only get two. They are excellent - but not a large portion at all. They are what appetizers should be - just enough to get you thinking about more food!Within 15 minutes our dinner was served - and another 15 minutes later - we had their chocolate cake!  Price was reasonable for fine(r) dining.
