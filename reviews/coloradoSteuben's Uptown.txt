The first time we ate at Steuben's I ordered the cured Ruben, DONT SKIP THIS IF YOURE THINKING ABOUT GETTING IT!!!! The sandwich was phenomenal. We just did takeout so I just got the sandwich.  Our second time at Steuben's we ate in, the hostess was super nice and we didn't have a long wait at all, they text you when you're table is ready so you don't have to be inside and wait. We got the Steubie snacks and traffic jam. The traffic jam was fitting and I could have had that and been happy with the meal. I ordered the fried chicken this time and it was cooked just right, would definitely order it again. Our service was good and did not have to wait a long time in between appetizers and our main meal."}, {"review_id": "DpFy_gNLoIphlWvxPxF9Hw", "user_id": "Py_ACZWXE_kRpkanGj-tZQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Nashville spicy chicken- 3.1 Traffic jam- 4.0 ( eggs were the best part) Coca Cola- 4.7Service- 5.0"}, {"review_id": "FMRh2UcV9WuJcydm3zaHcg", "user_id": "7uffbRVflQr8SwPuJC6vEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "5 stars for the food, patio, and the music!! Came here for a slightly hungover brunch, perked right up after some Stuebie snacks, a little heavy on the powdered sugar but I love the sauce that comes with it. There was no wait for a table for 2 on a Sunday around 10:30am and the patio weather was just perfect! I love the lox and bagel while my boyfriend ordered the sausage and biscuits. Everything comes in a pretty good helping, just looking around I wish I could have ordered more. The lox was amazing and the potatoes that come with the biscuits have a great crispy touch. I can't believed I've lived so close to here and just tried it for the first time. I will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "KME5x3xPb5ov3NBMVigP8A", "user_id": "7Mqmlvut75fP9-VgR9XIaw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "It's was bit breezy but heated patio sounded good and opted for it.  Good thing I wore sweater because it was still chilly when breeze passed thru.  Well, that's got nothing to do with my review of this location.Service was delightful, everyone worked as team but you had one key person taking care of you.Lots of breakfast and lunch items to fancy your desire.  Big plus!!  I was disappointed that they only had one draft and that was Coors.   :(But they did offer full bar menu and also other beers, just not in draft.I got the spicy bloody mary  but it was plain Jane.

There is nothing that a stiff drink won't fix and Steuben's offers just that and then some.Service here has always been Denver casual and that's the way I like it. Attentive, kinda like your best friend is waiting on you, and easy. Definitely go in for brunch and share ALL the things, sit at the bar and be wildly entertained.

Only one beer on tap, and you can probably guess which one that is. The menu has everything you need in my opinion. Last time I was here I went for the meatloaf. It was perfect. Today, was all about the happy hour!Let's make this simple for you Yelp fans out there. Burger + Beer(PBR)+ fries=7 dollars. 7 dollars. The burger was awesome. Sometimes I just want simple.

It has a diner type atmosphere when indoor and outdoor seating. The food is not like your usual diner with subpar food. They have a full menu with soup salads apps sandwiches/burgers entrees desserts and a lengthy drink menu with a full bar.I was in a hurry since I needed to catch a movie. I ordered when I was greeted by my server. She was very polite. She made sure to keep my water cup and drink cup full. I ordered the trout amandine. It was fabulous! 2 trout fillets with a grape and almond topping with green beans and roasted potatoes. Highly recommend. My drink and entree and tax came to 19.44, not including tip. The price was reasonable for the quality of food. It was busy when I got there a little before 5 pm. There was an NRA march downtown so there were many people coming in from that. The food and service was impeccable. My food came out so quick! The server boxed up my food and gave me a to go cup of my beverage. The containers were nice with the foil like container bottom with a plastic topper. No food spillage and yummy leftovers that I ate at the movie theater. I recommend this place highly.

Stueben's is delicious. With a very modern take paired with an old fashioned atmosphere, this place is here to impress anyone visiting Denver as well as the locals wandering around uptown. My favorite thing that I have tried thus far is the chilaquiles which are served during lunch as well and come with 2 eggs, shredded beef, ancho chile, corn chips, Cotija, avocado, and crema.They also have great fries and if you are feeling sweet, they have milkshakes served up with whatever is left over in the shake maker. A little Gunther Tootie's vibe, but much more welcomed. :) You can catch Stueben's in Arvada as well as in their fun food truck that roams around Denver. Everything here is delivious and I look forward to exploring more of the menu."}, {"review_id": "Jn96PaNtDZhSkKbJNVjydQ", "user_id": "VxXtYDyUNNpwRakVh_6XJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "Best cheesesteak ever.

Good happy hour specials late at night. However, I couldn't get over how salty the food was. The fried chicken was good without the skin, but the skin is supposed to be the best part!

Very mid-century modern vibe with ample patio space (the side patio is even heated!) I've been to Steuben's a few times and have never had an amazing meal here, but everything I (and whoever I was with) have ordered has been enjoyable. Prices are probably a bit high, but still a great neighborhood joint for when you want to take a guest somewhere fun and respectable without having to venture too far downtown. Things worth noting:- In a city with terrible chicken wings, Steuben's are among the best I've had. Their buffalo sauce is straight Red Hot, so that could use some work, but the wings themselves are relatively crisp. - They make a mean cocktail, and their bar feels like being at your grandma's place back in the 70's when all of the things in her liquor cabinet were in style. - They have limited hours, but there's an ice cream counter in the corner that has SOFT SERVE. I know, Colorado is all about small batch artisan hard ice cream, but I am wildly thankful for a place to indulge my love of soft serve that isn't the McDonald's drive through. - Their $8 bloody marys come in small glasses. Tasty, but overpriced. I'd pass."}, {"review_id": "CPZalGVRpFVk03i3zS08sQ", "user_id": "O1u24yZEaOgn8ZPB0_xPBw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/10/2017", "text": "From the moment I walked into Steuben's, it felt welcoming and cozy. We chose to sit indoors but there is a heated patio. The decor is nostalgic, mid- century modern but I think all of the natural light is what makes it feel like a diner from the movies. Our server was very friendly and helpful in answering questions about the menu. It did take a little bit to place our drink order, but since we were seated right away it all balanced out. I had the iced coffee, which came with free refills. We tried the gravy cheese fries, fried chicken, and Reuben sandwich. Based on pictures I've seen, I guess I was expecting more out of the cheese fries. While it is a generous portion and the texture is great, it was lacking in flavor. Salt maybe? The gravy is bland with a bit of a nutmeg taste, and the mozzarella on top is also bland.  Overall 3/5. The Reuben sandwich is made with house cured pastrami, house made sauerkraut, and fresh baked rye. My eyes were bugging out on this. So FREAKING GOOD! The flavors were all very fresh and balanced each other out. The bread has a nice crust but is very soft.  5/5 The fried chicken plate comes with bone-in chicken. The crust tastes like oregano? The portion of mashed potatoes was a little sad, but given how much chicken you get, I understand. I think the plate could easily feed 2 people. 4/5 It was definitely a fun, worthwhile place!"}, {"review_id": "c65TOiPmecHkpQoLksVMAw", "user_id": "oWccKrMSB-wKYMecBrbmUQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/28/2017", "text": "I really wanted to love this place as I've heard great things and normally like divey dinners but I think I may have just ordered the wrong thing.I got the Chilaquiles which was basically sauce and meat with an egg on top.

However, it looks like there may be a bit of street parking in the area.SERVICE - When we arrived, the place was full but we only waited about 15 minutes or so before being seated. Our waitress was incredibly friendly, coming back to make small talk and not simply asking how our food was. She was helpful in providing suggestions for what to order and responsive. She kept us updated when we had to wait for food and things. All around great service.FOOD - I'm not exaggerating when I say Stueben's is one of the best meals I've had in Denver. I took my parents here and we tried the pot roast, fried chicken with mac and cheese and biscuit, and cheesesteak sandwich. They were all absolutely delicious. The fried chicken was perfectly seasoned and moist; the pot roast was so tender; and the cheesesteak was spicy and flavorful (one of the best I've ever had). We practically licked our plates clean (and then ordered more to bring home). For dessert, we also tried a few options and the butterscotch pudding was by far my favorite. We had a chocolate dessert which was a bit too rich for me, but if you love chocolate, I'd recommend. Overall, if you're visiting Denver, stop at Steuben's. I recommend everything we tried (especially the sandwich), but I'm sure everything on their menu is stellar."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/steubens-uptown-denver?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
