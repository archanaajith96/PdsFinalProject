His attendance is perfection itself: attentive, knowledgable and subtle.While the restaurant is known for its steaks, I was amazed to see the volume of seafood offerings. Whatever your preference, surf or turf, you will find something to love. The food is consistently excellent.We love the 1920s/1930s decor, rich and elegant. The comfortable bar is tended by friendly, attentive staff such as Karen, Kirsten and Dan. Matt has \"departed\" to help the newly opened Crown where his expertise and good humor will be most valuable.If you see one or two men in dress suits clearing tables on a busy night, they are most likely the owner and the general manager who find no task in this well-run restaurant beneath them."}, {"review_id": "qUVgWdHvg2acoATLTzBASA", "user_id": "Y29Ot7yFTwATNu25pHsF_g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because our server, Rachel, was wonderful in every way.We had 10 people, which is an understandably large dinner party. We all pretty much ordered appetizers (which are supposed to be shared) and found the portion sizes to be dismal. The bacon sizzler is literally one small potato cake with one strip of bacon draped over it. Hardly suitable for more than one person to enjoy. The soups and salads were fine but nothing fancy for the price. My fiance, father and brother in law all ordered the special, which was a 26 day dried rib eye steak. Two of them ordered it medium-rare, the other medium. All of them came out blue rare, which is basically not cooked at all. I ordered the Korubuta Pork Chop and it was over cooked, dry and tough. I took two bites of it and  I couldn't eat any more of it. For $33 I expected more. Not only that but you don't get a choice of sides and they were clearly bulk prepared and not anything to write home about.All and all it was like at least a $900 bill after all was said and done and definitely NOT worth it. Rachel was the saving grace.If you want a great steak I would suggest Tuckaway Tavern before ever suggesting here. Hanover Street Chophouse is not worth the money and having to pay for parking when you're already spending a fortune on food is absurd."}, {"review_id": "dhi_llvM09clRDLZfm50pQ", "user_id": "q9peP73MIEPeqhnGWEafYw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Good food and great service.

The look of this place is classy with a dimly lit, very private vibe, and all around great atmosphere. First thing I ordered was a manhattan with Crown royal but before I decided I took a look at all the whiskeys they have available and it was a pretty impressive collection. To start my friends and I got the beef tartare, bacon sizzler, beef carpaccio, and the 4 selection cheese board. The beef tartare had the perfect texture and the onion, capers, and crustini that accompanied it were excellent additions to every bite. I want to make note that while we were not sitting at the bar we were able to order the tartare off the \"bar\" menu which was very much appreciated, the staff here is amazing and flexible. Next was the bacon sizzler which is essentially one huge thickly cut piece of bacon w/ a maple bourbon glaze, served with a potato cake. The sweetness of the glaze matched perfectly with the saltiness of the bacon and potato cake. Really tasty!Third was the cheese board. Let me start by saying it does not mention meat on the menu. I typically get a bit of meat with cheese boards but this one came with none. It was surprising but technically I can't complain. What it did have was great! Unlike other places I have been the waiter brought us out a list to make our selections which was a refreshing change. We got a Brie, two types of cheddar and a Camembert which were served with crackers, apricot jam, pecans, and fresh blue berries/strawberries. All of it was delightful. The last starter was the beef carpaccio w/shredded parm and a sort of Cesar dressing. The beef itself was incredible but I was not a fan of the dressing, I would have gone with less Parmesan as well. That beef with a nice olive oil drizzle would have been enough honestly ha. Despite that note I did enjoy it very much. Then came my filet mignon au poivre (peppercorn sauce) w/mixed vegetables & mashed potatoes. I have had many steaks, many filets, and that filet was absolutely perfect. I said medium rare and that is what I received. The meat was seasoned perfectly and the au poivre sauce was absolutely fantastic. The vegetables (onion, summer squash, green beans, corn) were all phenomenal as was my mashed potatoes. One of the best plates I've ever had.All in all a great meal at a great resturant with a great staff. I will be back."}, {"review_id": "U0NryyE_oMCaP1Oo7c_jpw", "user_id": "Cj1k8zkMFrBs2SbnPGDTHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/6/2017", "text": "I didn't have to think twice about how many stars to give this steak restaurant. My mind was just about made up as soon as we sat down. From start to finish, this entire experience was top notch. For a 5-star experience, this is your place in Manchester. Our server, Catherine, was the most patient and efficient server and always extremely attentive. I ordered Karen's Cosmo, which was a very generous portion and refreshing. We then started off with the Caesar salad ,which was beautiful and topped with large slices of Parmesan. Impressive. The bread basket was filled with warm chunks of fresh bread and butter.  Next came our steaks, which were served perfectly medium rare just as we requested and expertly seasoned. So tender, omg they were delicious. All steaks come served with vegetables and potatoes. Our potatoes were mashed with bacon. So yummy! We finished our meal with the \"The Howie\". This was a chocolate layer cake served with caramel ice cream & caramel sauce. So rich and decadent! All in all an amazing dining experience from start to finish and I would absolutely return on my next visit to Manchester!"}, {"review_id": "D-latmzhOOAZNtViuEnJWA", "user_id": "cmIZrLRm-_IXI-dc9F_xmw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Simply the best steak around and certainly the best steak I've ever had but be prepared to pay $50-$80 per steak I get it when you're the best you can charge whatever you want but for my money it is about $20 overpriced get a gift card before going."}, {"review_id": "QN5eagJ7NpX68L7CT6KxhQ", "user_id": "WjmklX3E7K2QIGxn2BoJgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/21/2017", "text": "Hands down the best steak my husband and I have ever eaten, anywhere....ever!!!

It only gets better from there... This is a high end steak house with a rich interior of dark woods, white linen service, tuxedo clad servers and fine art mounted purposely on their walls...I requested to be seated in Richard's section... He's the 2013 recipient of the NHLRA Restaurant Employee of the Year award and has always been my favorite in Manchester...This is a restaurant I've been to several times and the quality of food and service have always been over the top.For starters... The parsnip and apple soup... Rich creamy base with just a dash of green oil... I always enjoy a dish not often offered at other restaurants...Next up... The special salad... a mix of mixed greens, strawberries, orange and crumbled feta cheese... All this wonderfully dressed in a balsamic vinaigrette...The main... Surf and turf...  Butter poached lobster tail, eight oz  filet Mignon cooked medium, creamy mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus with hollandaise sauce... Amazing!And while the dessert selection looked extremely tempting with its offerings I was good and finished the meal with my signature cappuccino... Not wanting me to leave without a smidgen of dessert... Richard brought out a biscotti along with two wonderful pieces of peanut chocolate squares... And if that wasn't enough..., Tony the General Manager came over to make sure my dining experience was an amazing one! I'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "CQQ2miUCXRX-hsz4S8XPGg", "user_id": "lIQpXWdaNuKFdYxpIxt3DQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/10/2017", "text": "One of the better ribeyes and lobster mac and cheese I have had.

Both were great drinks. The bread and butter served at the table were excellent. For an appetizer we shared the bacon which had good flavors. The entrees pictured, are the bone in ribeye ( I added truffle butter ), and the hangar steak. We added an order of lobster Mac and cheese as a side. All of the food was amazing.

It was a very intimate venue. I ordered the mushroom topped filet mignon, with a lobster bisque to start. It was mostly bisque, not much lobster, but the portion was generous and it tasted great. The presentation of the filet was great, the cut was better. They pushed the mashed potatoes against the steak, so it gave the appearance of more potato than there really was, but they along with asparagus I ordered was unbelievable- a touch of salt with garlic and butter seasoning. My girlfriend ordered chicken alfredo. Alfredo and pasta was great, but the chicken was not on the same level as anything else we had ordered that night. Do not recommend chicken, it is a chophouse after all.
