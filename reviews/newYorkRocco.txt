The pricing is on the higher end but I feel completely fair because of how great the food is. I have no problem paying for good food! One of the waiters sang an Italian song to the far back table. Clearly he was a professional, he filled the whole place with his beautiful voice.

So I've wanted to try this place for a long time and finally did, or at least attempted to. I really had a hankering for white clam pasta. Went in, ordered a martini which took a little too long seeing how there was only myself and one other gent at the bar..Oh well.. I atempted to order the white clam but I like thin pasta, not linguine. So the waitress tells me she has to check and see if they can do that....waiting waiting and she comes back and says we can only do linguine. I asked, \"don't you have any thin pasta in the house?\" 'No we don't' she says. I'm like serious? Do you make your own pasta? She said no. So you can't keep a couple of boxes of spaghetti or angle hair around????Ended up having a meatball app that were underwhelming at best with some burnt over buttered bread. When will restaurants learn the customer is KING!!!!!????"}, {"review_id": "v3vsiefjaTdLwn9j3uIV5Q", "user_id": "LKVcHgtsM5rwzJLPtmfTkg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Still my favorite. The consistency of preparation, quality and service is unmatched. You have an owner who's a great chef and works very hard to earn a living and keep people like my wife and I happy.

The atmosphere is super cozy (code for tiny, yes, but still cozy). There are only 11-12 closely placed tables in the dining room, and one in the small bar area. And when I say small, I mean you could probably sit 6-8 people at the bar with barely room to stand. That is still no deterrent for me because the food is delicious. I cannot go there without getting the fried mozzarella app. It's covered in really delicious red sauce. Last night the mozz was a round shape which I think was previously square. It may have tasted even better. Their salads are delicious (had the insalata Rocco last night), and the homemade ricotta app is excellent. Pizzas variety is strong and there are nightly specials too. One of the most delicious things I've eaten there ( maybe anywhere!) is their  porchetta sandwich. Prob is they only make it during lunch, and only serve lunch on Fridays. I need to quit my job so I can be at Rocco on a Friday afternoons! You be wise to make a rez before you go. You're welcome! Oh, and service was excellent (thank Chris)."}, {"review_id": "Ml7-VCbCg1KlTWxYvud1vQ", "user_id": "pmyjzIhqgEPBQTM_vNsQoA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Tough to get in.

I'll tell you why.Terrible parking, I had to park in Fairport, OK I'm kidding but it was like two blocks away. Pricey given what you receive. With appetizer's an entrée and one dessert for two people plus wine you could easily end up paying $150 after tip.  Given the fact that it is somewhat pricey it would've been nice if somebody could've parked my car for me with a charge. Slightly small tables AND the tables are pretty close to each other. Finally I did not at first realize it but it was very LOUD. I actually did not realize how LOUD it was until I left the restaurant. Those were the only reasons why I would not have easily given it 4 Stars. We totally enjoyed the service. We also loved the food. We had a table of four and we ordered a lot of appetizers including a pizza . There was a slight problem with the small table given the fact that we had so many appetizers. In essence we totally enjoyed dinner but given the small tables and the price I felt like I was in Manhattan with Manhattan prices. I would easily go back to Rocco but I'm not in a rush."}, {"review_id": "9uFhVDy97f_3AZScvocJkg", "user_id": "-6P3jJwxyzxyYWLUxx4jyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2017", "text": "We absolutely love Rocco's. The food is always on point and the service is absolutely stellar. It's a very small place, and they have plenty of servers so you always feel very well attended to. The ricotta is out of this world amazing. It comes with charred, olive oil soaked bread that is delicious. The arancini appetizer is fantastic as well. Both are must-gets (be prepared for a full stomach here). This time, I got the prosciutto wrapped chicken with comes with sage risotto. It's amazing - the chicken comes in little columns so there's a good prosciutto to chicken ratio. Super tender and juicy. The risotto is great as well - very creamy and delicious. (Disclaimer: I had the risotto special on a previous visit and wish they made it an entree item). The boyfriend got the gnocchi, which he had on a previous visit as well. It's semolina gnocchi, so it has more the texture of super tender cornbread than potato pillow. The gnocchi are heavenly, super soft and super flavorful. They come in a tomato butter sauce that sizzles all the way to the table. The last highlight of any evenings at Rocco's should be the butterscotch budino. It's their signature dessert for a reason - I'm not even a huge fan of butterscotch and I still dream about it sometimes, it's that good. It's a butterscotch pudding topped with caramel and whole almonds. There's a texture disposition and a heat one as well (custard is cold, caramel is hot) and it's just amazing."}, {"review_id": "Y90_nHZ3xi5ELESjzoEZKA", "user_id": "eaTd8Ere79IkKzVsZsgtfw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Came here with high hopes after a friend who grew up in Rochester had been raving for months about how amazing Rocco is.Homemade ricotta with charred bread was almost amazing except that the bread was dripping in oil. Sad face. We also had grilled octopus with green sauce, a pasta dish and a meat dish (both specials)... all were incredibly salty, to the point that neither of us could finish any of the appetizer or entrees. Huge disappointment for first-timer (me) and friend (life-long Rocco lover-no-more). Tried this despite a colleague giving below average reviews of the place because my friend claimed to be a die-hard fan. Neither he nor I will be back.

Call in advance for reservations, as the place is tiny and they book up quickly! It says that dress code is casual on yelp, but I recommend dressing it up a notch or two.We started with the the ricotta arancini. The crust on these was incredible. I got one of the daily specials: it was sliced lamb on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes with escarole on the side. The mashed potatoes were floating in the most flavorful rosemary sauce/jus. I was really impressed at how much the rosemary came through... everything blended together beautifully. The steak my boyfriend ordered was impeccably cooked. The fried cauliflower that came with it was so tender and really exceeded our expectations. Do save room for dessert! They have so many options! The butterscotch budino is a must have... it's just the right about of sweet, the carmelized almonds are crazy good, and the whole thing just kind of melts in your mouth. I'm literally dreaming about this dessert. The goat cheesecake with applesauce was also very good, and is actually pretty goaty! However, if you're between getting X or the budino, get the budino -- you won't regret it!I've also visited them for lunch on Friday. I was a little disappointed that their menu was super pared down -- basically consisted only of pizzas, salads, and sandwiches. I tried their cheese pizza (basically a pizza bianca), pepperoni pizze (the tomato sauce is definitely on the more acidic/sour side), and their porchetta sandwich. Of these, my favorite was the porchetta sandwich, which came with a side of a salad. The pizza had a very thick bready crust, with a super thin, floppy center. Not the best combination imo. Good news is that their lunch menu still contains the budino!"}, {"review_id": "gFfongwh-azVmU6yJ0eUvQ", "user_id": "jPdz0KDLg4Xm80tBAXGAiQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "Best Italian in Rochester.
