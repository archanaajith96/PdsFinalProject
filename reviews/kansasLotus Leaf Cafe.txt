I visit Wichita a couple of times a year and always make a point of coming here. My mom and I have never had anything here we didn't like. I'm vegan and she's omni and we both leave happy every time. The tacos are particularly declicious and I have a soft spot for their sweet potato chips.Can't recommend this place highly enough!"}, {"review_id": "5iLPll2LEvyxLujcFl3KSw", "user_id": "2M2pJEeKUthD-LXS7fyTvQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/11/2017", "text": "I have been here a few times now and I just love that it caters to my veggie tastes. I am not vegetarian but I do love my veggies. This place manages to incorporate very nicely a lot of veggies into everything.I always have the hummus appetizer and I think it's a garlic hummus that comes with veggies and pita for dipping. Very yummy and feels good to be eating healthy while out.Then I go to their fish tacos which are so big you only need one and that is still too much food for one as it comes with a salad on the side as well. Now the dressing they make for the salad is too die for. I think the last one was a lime vinaigrette and OMG was it amazing!All in all I feel like it's a healthier alternative to choose from when eating out but still packs a great punch for the tastebuds. I will be putting this on the rotation for sure."}, {"review_id": "VvbgatkKJuQ3XKQV2HJFtg", "user_id": "I5d7emUXQYHrNVTXnL2nOg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/27/2017", "text": "I love Lotus Leaf. They do an amazing job of creating healthy dishes that also taste fantastic. If you're looking for a wonderful vegetarian/vegan spot, this is your place!I have a hard time choosing a favorite off of their menu, it's all really so good! I usually get the Tuscan Garden Sub (roasted eggplant, sun-dried tomato pesto, spinach, feta, and more). It's delicious. I also really enjoy the Triple B black bean burger and the Belvedere, a turkey burger stuffed with goat cheese. Also, I almost always get a smoothie and fried Buffalo cauliflower. They serve sweet potato chips with most of their meals as well, so good. I think I'm just rambling on but everything they serve really is amazing. The restaurant itself is fairly small but very clean and modern looking. The staff is super knowledgeable and friendly and always willing to alter their menu items to fit any dietary needs."}, {"review_id": "94nalx-S7x7FRzcC_GMb3w", "user_id": "IWEt20kVdih7CQBGrxnb7Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "Amazing dinner, cauliflower appetizer was delicious.

Stopped here to fill up on a road trip. If you like cauliflower try the cauli-power: lightly fried cauliflower with buffalo sauce on the side!

Organic, healthy, delicious. I love this place. I tried the Average Tom and it exceeded my expectations- A toasted turkey panini with caramelized onion, Swiss, tomato, spinach. MmmmAnd I just learned they serve organic beer and a variety of wines. If you're in the Wichita area be sure not to miss this local gem!"}, {"review_id": "3c2MEmruEE1IEl411Ze1ug", "user_id": "5V4S-ZWIXNtG6lk67DnfUQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2017", "text": "The only reason we decided to give this place a try was because our nephew was in town visiting with his girlfriend and she's vegan and prefers to eat gluten free also..,not being our normal way of eating we were grateful to find a place open later than 2 in the afternoon that could accommodate her and hopefully our 12 year old could find something to satisfy her as well. We pulled up their online menu and I got a bit nervous, not many items listed and even fewer that I actually knew what they even were!! Now I'm not only worried about my daughter I'm worried about myself. Ha!   You guys it was amazing. Super bright and cheerful inside the staff was wonderful.  The menu was much more extensive than listed online with many vegan and non vegan options (hallelujah!!) Our waitress made some suggestions and answered all our questions. We got a vegan \"cheese dip\" that was cashew based. We literally licked the bowl clean it was to die for. Only bummer as with most chip/dip appetizers the dip to chip ratio is never right.  We definitely could have used more chips! Everyone loved their food selection. We hardly stopped to breathe in between bites but when we did it was to say \"omg, this is so good!\"  They serve sweet potato chips with their meals and they were YUMMY! They also had a homemade vanilla soda that 3 people in our party got that also got rave reviews! We will definitely be back, and we won't even wait for the vegan to be visiting! ;)"}, {"review_id": "YbtUKmAaIDW5DYrvoVUQSg", "user_id": "YJObE3ZjH5rfsS5Ja72ORg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "This place is fabulous!

We have become regulars and try to make it by weekly. The price, quantity and quality of food is wonderful. The service is always great! We love Casey, she is very attentive. The place is clean, the music is at a perfect volume and the kitchen isn't overly noisy. Being vegetarian, we have tried almost everything on the menu. Hubby does get the fish tacos from time to time but prefers the quinoa tacos.
