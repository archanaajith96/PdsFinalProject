They now serve biscuits and gravy...a little bit spicy sausage gooey ness over delicious cat head biscuits.  Who doesn't love that?!?2. They have salads for those non-pastry lovers...kale apple salad was a winner.3.  They also do a pretty substantial turkey sandwich (which I tried and enjoyed) as well as a vegetarian option and a ham melt.  So, I give them props for continuing to expand their menu and selection and encourage you to stop in and try some of their newer offerings."}, {"review_id": "ntxxfFkfZIH2rezOUQvfcw", "user_id": "HLHAxR5B0XFck9GHapq0ng", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "The food here is okay, they've got some decent sweets and some savory things. However the real problem I have is one of the owners(?) Or bakers(?). He's an older gentleman (I use that term loosely). I've been there a couple of times with my elderly mother, and on TWO SEPERATE OCCASIONS this man has been blatantly yelling at the ladies running the front of the house. Both times they had a line of customers they we're trying to assist. He's cursing and shouting RIGHT IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS. My mom was horrified at the language that's being used. And it's being used LOUDLY. This guy just sends my blood pressure skyrocketing. I've worked in food service and customer service before and know how hard it is, I can't even imagine having an ape like him breathing down your neck.I had to download this useless app just so I could leave a useless review. Regardless, I hope it helps."}, {"review_id": "MapV8uJF8HXpyll-_8v8Hg", "user_id": "sTl1wxYVJqUmaBn-OvUXPQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "The bread is underdone, the sweets are dry and taste freezer burnt, and the baker loves to yell loudly in the back.

It's not just the baked goods (although I would never be able to sing them enough praises) but the breads, especially the rosemary and olive oil focaccia bread. My absolute favorite is the pink champagne cupcake (especially since they make larger cakes, which I got for my moms bday this year) and then whatever macaroons they have that say. While I love all the macaroons (except the pistachio, of which I am deathly allergic) my fave is the earl grey. Every time I go I hope that it's earl grey day, it has such a lovely flavor. The salted caramel and lemon are favorites too. I've never met a version of this French cookie that I didn't love at Black Cat.  The last time I went they only had \"autumn boxes\" which had 15 of autumnal flavored macaroons. They were each delicious. My mom is completely obsessed with their parfaits and whenever we go she always gets about 5 made so she can eat them over the next week. If you're in the market for some sweet treats, this is the place to go"}, {"review_id": "TSldpbBHtvWkoXAGEjRSkA", "user_id": "C5IE3eTjmEK4Jm5QfDYsJg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "Great coffee and breakfast bakery shop!"}, {"review_id": "Mg7HpDLIrwuDUS0DCvaY7g", "user_id": "LEPULBfMm4zKr_3vITYXzA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "7/11/2017", "text": "Normally I like their pastries here but today I got the (Lemon Chiffon) cupcake with Raspberry filling.

First, the negative: there is not too much seating if you plan to sit and eat breakfast. Other than that, everything else is great. My wife and I tried their breakfast croissant and they were delicious! The filling was top notch and the pastry was just about perfect. My kids ordered a cinnamon role and a danish; both were excellent. Lastly, I tried their lemon poppyseed danish. I've never had a danish like it and I loved it. Typically, when I visit a pastry place, there is always one item I get that isn't very good. However, Black Cat provided 5 different items and each was incredible. I have to admin, I'm a bit jealous of the residents of this town, because they can come here whenever they want. Oh, and their coffee was very good too... of course it was."}, {"review_id": "rDNZIwXeW0bt8Cuq054ZlQ", "user_id": "esXZ5ERPnn-2t0gBUQpAZw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/7/2015", "text": "If you live in or are passing through MSO this is really a must stop kind of place.  The staff were all friendly.  The customers were also friendly to a couple of motorcyclists just passing through.

I like that the location is so easy to access from either side of Broadway. There's a decent amount of parking, too. The inside is small, with seating for a handful of people. They have coffee, tea, and milk to go with the pastries.The pastries look so beautiful. We tried the raspberry chocolate cupcake. The cake itself was dry, but the frosting was delicious with amazing fresh raspberries in it. I ended up tossing most of the cake. The chocolate dipped macaroon was also pretty dry. The loki cookie is fantastic. Not only does it look super cute, it tastes amazing and is super decadent with rich chocolate and a delicious berry flavored filling. Berry croissant was excellent, too.Ham and cheese croissant for breakfast is a great option. Had the raspberry pave and it was out of this world. Seriously, amazing! So decadent and lovely. I tried a few over cupcakes and I think my general feeling is that the cake tends to be dry and the frosting tends to be too sweet. That being said, all the other cookies I've tried have been quit egood.So, kind of a mixed bag. I would avoid the cupcakes but try pretty much anything else."}, {"review_id": "WEBLG2Yh6wgBjz2UermYfQ", "user_id": "7DA-z7NyYFIJkXC9gSPrbQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "Quick trip to Missoula for the night and I wanted to see what the town had to offer.  So I searched by reviews and gave this place a shot and so glad we did!!! Wonderful fresh bread samples on the counter, they were all wonderful.  We arrived about 10:30 and the place was bustling and they had already sold out of a couple of the croissants, so go early.  I've never had a savory croissant like theirs, mushrooms, cheese along with something else (no meat because my husbands a vegetarian), we fought over who was going to finish.....outstanding.  The quiche was devoured by hubby before we left the parking lot, he saved me one small bite! Ordered several different danishes, were all wonderful. I would say that the staff recommendations are spot on.  I believe we bought about 7 or 8 different items.  My only disappointment was the champagne cupcake, lacking flavor or maybe just not my style, tried it because other reviewers recommended. Meh..so I can't diss that since the staff didn't recommend. Definitely worth the time to stop."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/black-cat-bake-shop-missoula?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
