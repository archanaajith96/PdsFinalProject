We came in late on a Sunday night, and the restaurant was quiet and dimly lit with about three tables occupied. The waiter welcomed us to the restaurant and promptly seated us at the window. He informed us of their butcher shop offerings and their local bakery. When I saw Sante served Foie Gras, I knew I came to the right place! It tasted of hazelnut in it, it was topped with a vinaigrette served with some greens and crostini. The foie gras was buttery smooth and the hazelnut and vinaigrette made it extra special. My wife and I also shared a ricotta gnocchi hot plate. It came with sausage, prawns and greens. The gnocchi was a lovely golden brown color, it tasted amazing, they were like a pillow melting into your mouth. The sausage was delicious with a hint of lemongrass and a crispy outside. The prawn was peeled with the head left on, it was succulent and fresh. The waiter stopped by with a little treat, their house bacon crumbled on a spoon, salty smokey goodness! Before our entrees came, we were given a glass of ginger water to clear our pallets. I ordered the carbonara, it was fantastic! The herb creme, the runny egg, and bacon blended very well. The pasta was al dente with the perfect amount of chew. It is a very heavy dish with savory flavors that dance on your tongue.  The waiter checked on us throughout our meal, gave us recommended instructions on how we should eat the dish, and never let our cups run dry. This was the perfect anniversary dinner. Food was top notch, worth every penny"}, {"review_id": "XOyt2qWxS7cLuCEWXL8s6g", "user_id": "vAedjtONz7m5Uyq1ziIlXA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "I was so excited to come here based on the reviews, and the only reason I haven't given a lower rating is simply because the waitress was very nice and really tried to make up for the terrible meal I was served, but the fact is the food was near inedible. My first clue should have been that the restaurant looked closed given the lack of customers, but I decided to give it a try anyways given the glowing recommendation I had been given. I ordered the duck, which is my favorite protein and I order often at restaurants. I acknowledge that duck is best done medium rare (and I appreciate) but when you serve me a completely rare duck breast that is cold in the middle and has rubbery skin, you've failed. I sent it back and the chef agreed it was not done right and cooked it more. It came back chewy with burnt skin. Still barely over raw with an acrid burnt skin. I barely ate my meal because it was so awful. My understanding is that they've had some kitchen changes. Hopefully they can get it together because with food like this I see why they're dead and closing early. : /"}, {"review_id": "wPXNmc-oT0iCHbnrEkPJoQ", "user_id": "pxlui9P6BQMg3E83vrN_Zw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "What great complement to the Spokane food scene!  Coming from Seattle, where variety is significant, I was very pleased to find a place that offers such a creative array of menu options.  French influence is wonderful, but not too overt so that anyone should be able to find a favorite option, whether vegetarian, health conscience foodie, or carnivore.  Bartender is tops by the way - wish I could recall her name.  She must be the best mixologist in the city!"}, {"review_id": "jttNjjKwhuMLOARka0losw", "user_id": "WT2dNEodFZtISzRPBBtqZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "Sante is super chill.

Went here for restaurant week and had a delicious meal!  Got the chickpea fritter, roasted root vegetables, and the brie plate. Although it was delicious, portion sizes were quite small and I was hungry again soon after. I got a drink that was quite good and very unique--the Fireside Chat with a smoked tea liqueur and whiskey. Service was great and atmosphere was subdued and pleasant.

We ordered the pate, warm root vegetable salad, pork tenderloin, and the roasted rutabaga. The pate was wonderful; even the apples it came with were delicious. The salad had pistachio crema, zataar, and pepitas. The bf had the roasted rutabaga, which is an entree. Pretty ballsy to serve a rutabaga as a meal, but they pulled it off. My pork loin was tender and juicy with bacon on top. Of course I love pork on pork! The service was excellent without being annoying.

There is ALL the potential here to be amazing. Top notch even. There are two very glaring issues which cause me to give this 2 stars.Those issues, in precise order:1) Service2) Heavy salting handEverything started out perfect enough. This is a well designed, well laid out restaurant. It is nice to look at and the ambiance is nice. The service from \"Alan\" started out friendly enough, but rapidly degraded into what I would consider poor service at best, almost verging on argumentative.We ordered cocktails and the charcuterie plate as well as duck liver pate. ***NOTE*** The charcuterie and Pate are VERY VERY well done!! Really worth a trip just for these if nothing else......So at this point our server asks if we though about our thoughts on other dishes at all. I explained we would be taking our time and bouncing back and forth through the menu. This is how we always eat. We like to graze all over the menu and get a real feel for what a place has to offer. I thought at that point it was understood that we would be taking our time and not in a rush to get out. (Note 2, slow night, restaurant 20 percent capacity).8 minutes later our server appears again, \"So...what are your thoughts on the next course\". I again politely explained that we hadn't really thought about it, we would get to it in a bit. Waiter, as he is walking away...\"Ok, but we actually cook our food here\". Well no shit guy...really? I had no idea that this establishment actually cooks their food. Thank you so much for the incredibly enlightenment. I guess my past ten years in and around the industry, Mich star rests, studying service, befriending staff and owners has all brought me to this one moment of enlightenment. The staff at Sante actually cooks the food there. Thank God you were there to point this out to me because, without that shitty comment, I would have never known! SO....I bite my cheek, hard, because I don't like scenes and with how quiet it was, had I lit this guy up, it would have been a huge scene and I was just trying to have a nice time with my family.Next trip back, we are ready to order, starting off with a bottle of wine. Now, for the record, I am in the wine industry. I know about wine...I drink wine every single day. I taste 20-30 wines a week, I am familiar in the most basic sense with wine. I order very specifically a bottle I love, a Rose from Tavel, and AOC known only for its Rose. Guy comes back...sorry we are out of that...can I offer you this instead? Now normally I would give mad props for that. Here is where it went incredibly wrong. No thanks, I was kind of set on that so can I take a look at the wine list again to see what else I might be interested in. Dude straight out stands there and wants to argue with me about what his choice is. I am starting to get a little pissed at this point and he begrudgingly brings the menu over. It was painful AF. Alan....if your business reads these...you need to understand a couple of things. 1) The customer is ALWAYS right, even when they are wrong. 2) It's my fucking bottle of wine with dinner, not yours. 3) Learn to get a feel for the customer. I have had every single wine on that list. I live wine all day every day, it is not only my passion, it is my life. I tried to humbly make it clear that I would rather look for something else I was interested in. You stood there and argued with me about it. Perhaps since this is a small town and you are more accustomed to less experienced diners you are used to pushing your thoughts onto people? I have no idea. It was pathetic and it took an incredible amount of restraint on my part to not call you out in front of the patrons and staff there. You have honestly been the most offensive server I have had in a very very long time and you may want to take a moment to re-evaluate your approach. Each member of my family was put off by you. I am sure you are a nice guy, but somewhere you have been misguided in your approach to the customer and you may want to consider adjusting if you intend on staying in the industry. Our brief encounters with the rest of the staff were pleasant and went off without a hitch. The fact that you were tipped at all is only out of respect to the service profession and in hopes that the back of the house got paid. It was much more than you deserved and about 1/3rd what we would have normally tipped.On to the food.As mentioned, the charcuterie and pate were excellent.Items orderedChicken BalontineChitarra CarbonaraPork Loin RouladeRicotta GnocchiAll items were incredibly full of potential. They all suffered from one deadly flaw, they were over salted. Trust me when I say I am not afraid of salt. I throw down with the best of them. All these dishes were just overly salted, and it seemed like a very fine grain salt which is the easiest type to over use. I want to love this place. I really want to. Please fix those two flaws!"}, {"review_id": "TG0I4p52wyCeMhiaJfJqsg", "user_id": "My25wfi8RBaj3vrDC5lVtQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "I went for restaurant week and really enjoyed their 3 course menu.  I had the pate, the braised beef, and vanilla dessert, which reminded me of a creme brulee.  It was also delicious and the recommended wine (Helix Shiraz) was an excellent pairing.  All in all the service was good particularly for a party as large as ours (10), but it took about 20 minutes to get the check. The inside of the restaurant is rustic and lovely and makes for a romantic evening.  If you want high end food without breaking the bank, give Sante a try."}, {"review_id": "gdszQTlYejUSm2Tar17XKw", "user_id": "DJy6jw54U32Ws_NUD3d5iQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Best meal we had in Spokane. Very much enjoyed our dinner at Sante.  Ordered gnocchi, fois gras and beef tartar for appetizers.  They were all spot on. For main, we ordered New York steak, schnitzel and saffron seafood risotto. The schnitzel wasn't as special as all their other dishes.  Steak, cooked sous vide was pretty amazing. The risotto along with seafood was cooked to perfection.  Tasted like fresh ocean. The beef tartar was one of the best I have ever had. Incredibly tender and lightly seasoned so that you can taste the amazing quality of their beef. Gnocchi as other yelpers raved about, is a must try. We finished our meal with chocolate torte and creme brûlée.   Torte was good but creme brûlée was amazing. So light with a hint of mint that we all agreed it was the best we ever had. We didn't not expect to have such amazing food in Spokane.  Thank you, Sante!"}, {"review_id": "aRvV8ts45QldP7QV_SrH8g", "user_id": "0p3oAc7KIirIgCrNVvho-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/12/2017", "text": "What an experience!

The pear tart was also not good and has a strange ricotta cheese like cream on it that tasted a bit off.
