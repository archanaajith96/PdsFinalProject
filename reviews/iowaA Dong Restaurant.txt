The restaurant can sometimes be slow because it is family ran and is short on staff. It will more than likely take a bit to get your order in but don't worry it is well worth the wait. The menu is very extensive and can be over whelming for first timers, second timers and third timers. It is good to come here with a seasoned regular or ask the staff what there favorite dish is or the most popular. If you like mild or spicy this place is for you. If you want the spicy route (which I always do) ask them for the back of house spicy chili oil. If you get lucky they also have fresh peppers that they will sometimes bring out. It is mostly in the summer but they are tasty and they grow them right outside the building. Another A Dong favorite for most is the condensed milk coffee but my favorite is the loose leaf Jasmine Tea.My guy and I visit A Dong about once a week. Give it a go and you'll be in love."}, {"review_id": "ckhUfCykAuVPoDhivtCbqw", "user_id": "JMjLz7VkqrxqfmhMxUj-7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/15/2017", "text": "66;89;109;129; these area few of the numbers you should put into rotation at your next visit.

It's great Asian comfort food on a cold day but really nice sunny day. They have a tremendous amount of choices for food. They also have a nice pho and it's a good choice any day but especially nice late evening or not cool or cold day I recommend to visit parking it be a problem so be aware that. Service is great. It is one of the Moines oldest Asian Vietnamese restaurants."}, {"review_id": "YqE8BJYcNQwvnr1Qp6YWVA", "user_id": "YzjroiYF6kjLhWlFt3gwQA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "Man, I really wanted to rate this place higher than this. Like really bad. All of my friends rave about this place and I live so close and the pricing is cheap enough that I could make this place my go to for a quick dinner! That being said, before I took the plunge and visited here for the first time I asked a bunch of my friends whats the best thing to get here and an overwhelming amount responded with Fried Spring Rolls and Pho. I was excited to try Pho for the first time, especially since soup has always been one of my favorite meals. The presentation is really impressive. I love that they give you all of the add ons to the Pho on the side (Jalapenos, Cilantro, Lime, Sprouts, Etc) that way you can add them to your liking. First sip I realized that the taste was rather bland. I added a bit of Sriracha and soy sauce for flavor and it made it a little better but I was unhappy that the original flavor was as bland as it was. After discussing this with my friends they all assured me that Pho is usually bland so that you can add your own flair to it. This....I dont necessarily get. Why cant they just make the soup taste flavorful to begin with? Why should I have to use my own ingredients? On a side note, dont take your leftover Pho home...Just dont. I went to eat my leftovers later that night and it already smelled like it had gone sour. The saving grace? The spring rolls were AMAZING! As well as their Iced coffee. Im going to give this place another shot, only because their menu is so big and I do want to try one of their rice dishes. Ill update when this happens. Who knows maybe Im a A dong lover, but just dont care for Pho? We shall see."}, {"review_id": "_HNKFTpAMD22c_cAT2QqpQ", "user_id": "5zbbkMl_9IRLNPTCZ1eR5g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/10/2017", "text": "Pros: huge selection of food, plenty seating, east parking, reasonable pricingCons: my vegetarian vermicelli was somewhat lacking of flavor...it was still decent enough to eat, but I couldn't say that I truly enjoyed it.

I'm Vietnamese, and I live in a west coast area with a predominantly Vietnamese population.

The service was very good- they came to check up on us and the food came out so quickly. The bo luc lac, for example, had a lot of beef that was NOT overcooked and tough but was a done medium and juicy.The menu is extensive and well-marked with their specialties.

It's tough work, guys. We came on raving recommendations from friends, so I had high expectations (plus it's actually owned by Vietnamese people! Low bar I know). I got the #1 (which is always the house special pho in most restaurants) and bf got the BBQ pork and shrimp rice plate. The pho broth was a little disappointing to be honest. It was bland and I had to commit the cardinal sin of adding soy sauce to it for taste. It also didn't come with tripe (which okay, I get that it's Iowa, but even the Iowa City restaurants include tripe). The beef was tender and a good portion, but the broth was really what made me push aside my bowl. The bf's rice plate was actually really good. The BBQ pork came in the Chinese char siu style (red edges, grayish white inside--appealing sounding, right?) which was a little unexpected but tasty nonetheless. I am convinced that fish sauce makes everything taste awesome, but I'm probably part of the minority.I really wanted to love this place given the reviews and history of fire and reopening, but it just wasn't my favorite. 3.5 stars rounded up."}, {"review_id": "Q8TtN1x5nfnaVI9wTaH5nA", "user_id": "lPNxg0oIDnQ4fRMQScgT2g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/17/2016", "text": "Love this place!

I'll wait. It's so hilarious and run by someone who works at the restaurant. If that didn't pull you in, the giant menu with tons of options should. I usually go with my old stand bys of pho, cream cheese chicken rolls and Vietnamese style coffee (omnomnom) but I was vegetarian for Lent and I had so many options to choose from here! They also have a dessert drink that is made of beans, paste and grass or something, at least that's what it looks like, and even that's surprisingly good! So... What am I saying?

The food is always delicious and the service is great. The Pho is a must try. Today we had the #113 Hot Pot. It was amazing. Served with a hot coal in the center of the metal pot (hence the name), it comes sizzling and smoking right out of the kitchen. The broth was spicy and delicious, although I added a little more kick with some sriracha. The soup has generous amounts of meat and vegetables. It is sublimely tasty.
