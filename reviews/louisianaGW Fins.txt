Everything about this place is top notch. The decor is sophisticated and warm. My server was attentive, knowledgeable and gave some great tips on what to order. The broiled oysters were served perfectly and full of flavor. For my entree I had the signature scallobuit. It was one of the best things Ive eaten in  a long time. The accompanying lobster risotto was perfectly cooked. It complimented the fish perfectly. The Samoan ice cream tasted just like everyone's favorite Girl Scout cookie and was the perfect ending to an outstanding meal."}, {"review_id": "0ImeST_avf_2gavzRUlPKQ", "user_id": "FzPH8NozXhkvkyOZ2JiLUA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "So I was really looking forward to this place. I'd had recommendations from friends and strangers. It was a little disappointing. We started off with a martini- very good. It was the one with tequila. The biscuits they serve are warm and sweet and excellent.We ordered the tuna tartare app. It was good but not so unique that I couldn't get it at Cheesecake Factory. We then shared the strawberry salad. The pecans were excellent and the salad overall was good. Then came the entree. I ordered the John Dory and my wife had the scalibut. They were both lacking in flavor, texture, sauce-Just lacking. They needed something.The service was very good. Brandon, our waiter, was very attentive.  When we come back- I'd probably skip this place because there's better restaurants in NoLA."}, {"review_id": "DEF6pYCgsZdJzBEm-0PQVQ", "user_id": "P5pau3q9JLXmWbzlUad0zQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Amazing place right off Bourbon Street. The staff is trained to make you feel incredibly welcome. We had delicious red fish, scalibut, lobster dumplings, salty malty pie and a strawberry rhubarb semifreddo. All of it was amazing. We also had 4 drinks which were prepared in a nice stout manner.The chocolate martini is very easy to drink and great with dessert. They also will make you whatever cocktail you want even if it's not listed.There was a good mix of people eating and working here. My fav was the biscuit guy who walks around giving out delicious biscuits hot from the oven all night.

Once we were seated our waiter, Oliver, promptly stopped by offering water and wishing my husband a happy birthday. We chose a bottle of Stag's Leap red wine from the extensive wine list. Oliver explained the menu and made recommendations. We started with the seared oysters and lobster dumplings (both pictured). The oysters were placed on the shells, which were heated to 500 degrees and seared the oysters. What a unique way to prepare the dish! The oysters were huge and we felt that the dish was priced appropriately for the size of the oysters. The lobster dumplings were also excellent. I'm always hesitant with dumplings that they will be too dough heavy. We found these dumplings to be rather light. And it's served with a spoon to scoop up the excellent butter cream on the bottom of the dish!Oliver also noted that the menu is printed daily, based on the fish that is delivered. My husband ordered the rare blue fin tuna on the recommendation of Oliver (who referred to it as the \"filet mignon of the sea\"). I'm not a fan of rare tuna, but I tried a piece and it was delightful! I was sad to see that the well-known scalibut dish was missing from the menu. However, I chose the scallops and it did not disappoint! The mushroom risotto was a standout. We declined dessert because we were so full from our meals, but they did present a truffle with happy birthday written on a plate in chocolate for my husband's birthday. We thought that was a nice touch.Overall, we would definitely consider returning to this restaurant and we found the cost of the meal rather reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food."}, {"review_id": "2E_5Adnx_QdRSHwWhNWWEA", "user_id": "Vf5vygVylJ_6_OVh2Vh22Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Not sure how we have missed this for some time.

I made a reservation online a few weeks before we came.I was so excited to try the Scalibut (halibut topped with scallops and roasted), but sadly it wasn't in season when we went. Instead, I got the John Dory with Jumbo Lump Crab which was absolutely incredible! I love seafood and this was perfect. The John Dory fish was so tender and lightly buttery. There was a decent amount of lump crab, served with asparagus and some other veggies. The plate was beautifully presented!We also shared the Lobster Dumplings which were bite-sized pockets of deliciousness. The lobster basically melted in my mouth!The complimentary biscuits here were so buttery and soft! I had at least 3 but definitely wanted more!Service here was incredible! Everyone here was so sweet and really made sure we had a great experience. After our meal, the waited brought out a birthday present for me - a plate with the words \"happy birthday\" wrote in chocolate syrup and a candle. Sure it wasn't a free dessert, but it was still a nice touch!"}, {"review_id": "rLqnZYr8hNKGVond1ufI9A", "user_id": "akv8uZ1X6POqCWXYcnbXfA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Our server, Stacy Y, was excellent and wonderful with my Down's Syndrome brother.As always, the lobster dumplings and scalibut were excellent.

The smell. The taste. The texture. BUT I ordered the Scalibut and cleaned my plate, almost licked it in fact. Microphone drop. Service was fantastic, Kevin was our waiter which was kinda funny cause he looked like Kevin Hart. Ordered pork belly appetizer and it literally melted in my mouth. Together with the garnish of pineapple and slaw bed it was on= Happy mouth.The Scalibut was beautiful and plated perfection. I would have liked more torch browning on the scallop cap but not complaining. The halibut was cooked to perfection and tasted like chicken (honest). The lobster risotto was fantastic and creamy."}, {"review_id": "OKuwS5UcZz3IbD8CsYcPow", "user_id": "1gnkCn5x9P60xc2X9gDlyw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "When visiting New Orleans for the first time everyone said Hugos was the place to go for oyster.

Somehow, we managed to skip GW Fins until this year. I am so glad we finally discovered this gem because it turned out to be one of our favorite meals we have experienced in the city. First, the atmosphere is more contemporary than most Quarter restaurants, and the service from the host to our server was second to none among restaurants in the Quarter. Our server was perfectly attentive, and other staff also served us biscuits, water and drinks as needed. We started our meal with the small but delicious lobster dumplings and beautifully served bottle of cabernet sauvignon. My friends had the famous Scalibut (perhaps one of the best dishes in New Orleans fine dining) and I had the drum fish. Both were incredible. The scalibut is a filet of halibut topped with scallops. My drum was served with vegetables in a delicious butter sauce. While the menu contains some Creole inspired favorites like red fish, the menu was refreshingly driven by seafood excellence and not the same ole Quarter Creole and Cajun standards.Our meal averaged about $80 per person ($30 entree and shared wine and appetizers). There were no regrets. Just elation, and a promise that we would be back."}, {"review_id": "WnZAwGaVmbzbLhGNlcjsiQ", "user_id": "CjEIOODtdG2yloVWGmraOg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Had the best meal of the trip hands down and are out at a lot of other good establishments but this may have been one of the top meals of all time. Definitely top 10. Im not a seafood eater yet I'm going to a seafood restaurant. However my pesto gnocchi was so delicious. I don't know how they did it but every flavor stands out. Not too saucy, just right. For my appetizer I had the pork belly with compressed watermelon. Who ever heard of compressed watermelon?  The waiter told me to take each bite of pork with the watermelon. It seems the chef found a way to mix ingredients that compliment each other. Obviously this chef is an expert in food and is not just dishing out food to fill your belly. No this was something much higher. I usually eat to get full but I found myself savoring each bite. Finally even if you don't have room for dessert, share the bread pudding. Holy smokes was that good. The waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable. He recommended dishes. And while being from NY and not trusting salesmen, he was able to not only sell each dish, he was spot on!Definitely a return location, wear a collared shirt or they will give you one to wear. Come hungry. If I were to take anything off their perfect score, I'd say it was that my beer was not ice cold. But how did they know I like it that way?"}, {"review_id": "CT9KEfreXWI_7VUhdEHK-g", "user_id": "kxt3aDZeRuKPyIkN78BLKA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Really good food. Upscale.

We had late reservations 10 pm and I felt rushed. They stop serving at that time even though the place was packed ! Apps came out fast lobster dumplings delicious , BBQ shrimp was just ok. Was sort of fishy to me. Main entrees red fish very good topped w plantains and sweet potato hash. also had  the scalobit there most popular item. It's halibut with seared scallops on top , lobster risotto , pea pods  was definitely worth every bite. We came for our birthdays but wasn't feeling well and they brought us out candles n a piece of chocolate since we did t want desert. Service was very prompt and friendly. Will return. I recommend coming earlier if I had to give it one less star.
