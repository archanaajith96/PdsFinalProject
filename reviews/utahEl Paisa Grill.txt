They came out hot and with lots of beans, rice, guacamole, pico to go with it. Chips and salsa were delicious. Other people in our group got the taco bar and said they were superb. Service was incredible. Waiter (Roger) was super attentive, sweet to my 2 and 5 year old. My little guy's birthday was this week and they sang, brought him a piece of Cheesecake with a sparkler in it, asked him what he wanted for his birthday."}, {"review_id": "1Vy0NzSrEf70GBXiirGxYA", "user_id": "nZRyQVsUx43FQxA8cYwx5w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "Molcajete supreme is the dish to get!!!!!!!!!!Service is always slow.Live music in the evening which is fun and loud."}, {"review_id": "fBcsGpa-qB3hAwjVkpU0RQ", "user_id": "ufS8pUH0CjannSmyUapQAw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "number 1 favorite Mexican restaurant in salt lake city. good wide range of authentic Mexican food.live performances on the weekends. it gets pretty busy some days so plan accordingly.the food is super good. two thumbs up."}, {"review_id": "KxjYPCMWbgMJftbJ9askGA", "user_id": "JtRHOHqpuomtRsvJ1tSpSw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/1/2017", "text": "Came here today for a work lunch. I've never been out here before and am excited to try out a new spot. It's in  a plaza on a corner right off 3200w exit of 201 and the parking lot was packed. We only had to wait a few minutes for them to put together a table for our large group of 10 and 3 orders of chips and salsa were brought to the table right away. The chips are nice and crisp but not really salty and the salsa was mild but you can ask for more spicy versions and it's kind of in between a pico de Gallo and picante mix in consistency and flavor.  The highlight of the location appears to be the taco bar which apparently only costs $11 for the food and a drink. That's crazy good and there  was a line at the bar the whole time we were there. This lunch food adventure brought us here specifically for the molcajete.  The table ordered 3 supreme molcajete that served 2 so everyone could sample some. One person ordered a cheeseburger, one ordered the cheese enchiladas, and I ordered the bean and cheese burrito.The molcajete comes out bubbling hot and packed with ingredients. It comes with a side of rice and beans and tortillas so you can build your own concoction. If I ate all the meat it contains it looks unbelievably mouth watering but I leave the tasting to everyone else. And the dishes were all devoured and raved about how the meats and shrimp are cooked and the flavor of the sauce. You have to make sure you dig all the way to the bottom to get all the good stuff.  The burrito comes with a small amount of salad on the plate not enough to be called a side salad but glad to have some greens on the plate but the dressing seemed a bit spicy to me. I'm too sensitive to spice so maybe I'm just crazy but I couldn't eat it after the first bite. The tortilla on the burrito was really good but the cheese wasn't really melted enough on the inside. The flavor was great overall though and not spicy at all. The person that had the enchiladas said they were flavorful and delicious but the sauce could have been spicier. The service was a bit slow but as I mentioned it was packed during the lunch hour so I won't fault them much. It was just a bit frustrating when it took 2 requests to get the tortillas that are supposed to come with the molcajete and a few people didn't get drinks or salsa right away when asked. And then it took forever to get the check and we had to go up to ask fpr it. But otherwise, overall it was a great experience and I will definitely have to come back with the hubby so he can try some of the items. I waver between a 3 and 4 and would knock them down to a 3 for the service but the food was decent enough to keep them at the 4."}, {"review_id": "9GoWVJeaXVKrCMNddK_u5A", "user_id": "augrZBGTxjZV6NWt7FvUEQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "Friday night live music, great service, great authentic Mexican food.

Nothing like experiencing the sound and waft of the montage of grilled amazingness piled up and overflowing from a large, hot volcanic rock molcajete. Simmering in a super flavorful salsa verde, surf and turf (grilled steak, shrimp, chicken) with nopales, queso fresco topped with jalapeños all make for a total crowdpleaser! You get to craft your perfect taco bite--this is a do-it-yourself, build your own tacos situation (we wish they were hand-made tortillas). Together with the vibra of live #music is some serious Mexican happiness that will transport you to a classic Guadalajara-style mariachi restaurant. ¡Viva El Paisa en West Valley!"}, {"review_id": "QNpinpD6fLdlSZ6Yuuj-hg", "user_id": "Zq_NBMddZb8yjGRL73BWpw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "Great food!

It's actually a really authentic place for Mexican food. I do recommend this place. The portions and the food in general is reasonably priced and it's pretty good. I got the California burrito I think the portions were good. Pretty good flavors, just a little dry. I honestly wished there was more flavor but overall the size and food was decent. My friend got the taco plate. I think hers was very good. The meat was proportional, she's super picky, so if she liked it, it's pretty good. Their service was good ! They didn't leave us hanging and water was always filled. I would come here again.
