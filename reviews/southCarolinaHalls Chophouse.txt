Many are dressed in professional attire and going out of their way to make you feel at home and see all your needs are met. I chose the bone in Ribeye ordered Medium Rare. It was good don't get me wrong but I wasn't wowed. The flavor in parts were good but Ribeye is my absolute favorite cut of meat and I must say my expectations weren't met especially for the price. It may have been cooked a bit over my taste but not nearly enough to justify sending it back. The main thing was just the meat was tough for a Ribeye and lacked flavor overall. Also the asparagus was very fresh but a bit undercooked and lacked flavor as well. I still couldn't help but rate 4 stars because the service was so exceptional and creamed corn side was also exceptional."}, {"review_id": "oMTVbRZSHoLFIjrbKUoD7w", "user_id": "_gcNAoz_uErYpZ0GNMZTSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "Let me preface this review and say that this is now my #1 restaurant in Charleston! What an incredible experience my wife and I had on her birthday last night! This was our first time eating at Hall's. We've been dying to go so I finally made a reservation on our staycation downtown this weekend and all I can say is INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE! We were treated like VIP's from the very beginning! Seated immediately by the very attentive hostess who asked us who's birthday it was. She wished my beautiful wife a happy birthday and proceeded to seat us in the adjacent dining area from the main entrance. As we walked into the restaurant, Tommy Hall gave me a warm welcome too which of course was pretty neat! We had a perfect seat next to the window and were very happy right off the bat. Our server was really great and his name was Aty? Great server. Very attentive and gave us an excellent recommendation on the steak options and sides. He brought out a display of the steak options and even made a great recommendation on going with 1/2 portion sides which was more than enough! That's what a great server is supposed to do!Between ordering entrees, Tommy Hall stopped by our table and greeted us warmly. Our neighbors are friends of his and he asked us if we knew them which made it even more personal. He then mentioned that our neighbor had a favorite cocktail which he brought out complimentary for my wife's birthday. What a  good man! We think our friends called it in! Incredible service!The food was downright heavenly tasting. I'd say the fried green tomatoes appetizer was delicious but maybe not the best I've had? That was probably the least favorite even though it was still good! The dinner was mind blowing. My wife ordered a 12oz wet aged filet and I ordered the dry aged 16oz rib eye. Y'all when I say that was the BEST steak of my lifetime I'm not exaggerating. THE BEST STEAK I'VE EVER HAD. We ordered the cream corn side and the Mac n cheese. Both absolutely mouth watering. I'm writing this review this morning still thinking about it.We were brought two glasses of champagne and a delicious bread pudding dessert with ice cream. Delicious! This was a first class experience. There is a good reason this is a Top 100 restaurant in he country! As far as I'm concerned it's the BEST restaurant in the country! We'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "ZN45tTZmihY5BHNofF3ZqQ", "user_id": "hbch3mzE1wPaZhWGf6Oa4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Exceptional!!  Food, ambiance and the owner are incredible!!!!  Our server Janis is phenomenal!"}, {"review_id": "xvKHYmXf3n73dJZYsjaj9w", "user_id": "7UF1ucIbb0-RgufTyAb1EQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I've eaten steak in restaurants around the world and I can honestly say this was one of the best experiences. Since it was our first time, they brought out all the cuts to explain wet/dry aged, sizes and cuts. We went with the $99 tomahawk dry-aged steak - so incredibly juicy, meaty, buttery. If it's just two people, ask for half sides. The pimento creamed corn is the bomb - DO NOT miss it and the mustardy brussel sprouts are also really good. We were celebrating so the manager brought us champagne and dessert on the house. They really know how to look after you here - great example of Southern hospitality. Highly recommend and we'll be back"}, {"review_id": "ArdVBNaa_BW5BHEEwFX86Q", "user_id": "Cj1k8zkMFrBs2SbnPGDTHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Hall's deserves 5 stars all the way for helping me have an amazing birthday meal! This is a family owned and operated place. We chose it because of this. In many cities that we visit, we like to go to the Steakhouse that's only in that city. We try to avoid chains.  So upon entering, it's exactly what I wanted. All dark, old, wooden, with loud piano music near the bar with people drinking martinis. My kind of place!  We were seated on time(we had an 8pm reservation) and received a perfect little table for two in an intimate room with another bar. Our server, Valerie, was super friendly and attentive and took excellent care of us all night.  I ordered The Hefner for my cocktail. I can't remember everything that was in it, but I know it had Hendricks Gin, St.Germain,cucumber and bubbles. It was refreshing and strong and delicious.  Valerie brought over all of the cuts of meat for us to view before we ordered and explained the menu.  We chose to share a Caesar salad, a steak and the shrimp and grits.  I personally thought the entire meal was delicious,but my favorite was the shrimp and grits. So creamy and rich!   We were too full for dessert, so Valerie had a slice of chocolate birthday cake boxed up for me(with a candle too!). Such a nice touch! We ended up eating the cake the next morning and it was pretty damn great.  Thank you Hall's for an amazing meal!"}, {"review_id": "LE1BIWq8uKmdqw1eDJZv7A", "user_id": "SCqcBUFTGCINw_533tWoBg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/21/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Halls never disappoints; food, service, and atmosphere always five stars.  My recent visit was no different.   We went on a Wednesday night and like usual it was quite busy... I've never seen it slow so reservations are strongly recommended.   The steaks are the best available... I suppose one day I'll try something other than the steak but for now I'm quite content.   For this visit, there were three of us.   We started with some East Coast Oysters on the half shell.  They were fresh and tasty and came with some nice cocktail sauce, horseradish, and mignonette sauce.  Oysters?  4 stars.   For entrees, we had the wet aged ribeye, the dry aged ribeye, and a special not on the menu, a bison filet.   Of course we all had to compare so we tried all three.   Personally, I liked the dry aged ribeye best although I can't say I disliked the other two.   All three steaks were prepared exactly to the requested temp.   Steak?   5 stars.We chose two sides to go along with our steaks; the pepper jack creamed corn and the pancetta roasted brussell sprouts.  The creamed corn is outstanding, a must try!   Creamed corn?  5 stars.  Brussell Sprouts?  4 Stars.    We accompanied our dinner with a nice Cabernet.   Wine?   5 stars.   FYI, they have a very nice wine selection!Last but not least, service... our server Alex was knowledgeable, attentive, and had good suggestions.   His assistants were equally helpful; our water glasses were never empty nor were our wine glasses.   Overall, service tonight?   4 stars.    While still very good, it was not exactly the five stars we've received on other visits.   All in all, (food quality, food preparation, food taste, service, and atmosphere) I'd still say it was a five star experience!"}, {"review_id": "WajN7p7nFPNzVWo5ssKopA", "user_id": "6H4Zj-c7FqM9mCsXvwaEQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "With such glowing recommendations and amazing reviews we decided what better place to celebrate our daughters Birthday.  We arrived a few minutes before our reservation which I had noted that was were celebrating a Birthday.  While we waited for a tale to be ready Billy Hall overheard the Hostess say Happy Birthday to my daughter and me.  Billy then after introducing himself also said Happy Birthday to us.    Our table was ready on time and we had a nice table toward the back downstairs.  We had barely gotten settled when Billy came back and gave us a glass of champagne and again said Happy Birthday.   I knew this was going to be a night to remember.  We ordered a couple of appetizers to start - Calamari and Tuna Tartare.     The Calamari was cooked perfectly and was so tender and delicious.  It came topped with the very tasty picked hot pepper rings.  The whole dish was on top of the very tasty tomato sauce.  The Tuna Tartare was a big surprise.  I was apprehensive to order it but my daughter insisted we get it.  It was much larger than expected and was delicious.  We were definitely off to an impressive start to the evening.     I was hoping to try the Bison Fillet which everyone I talked to had recommended.  I was so happy when our server Carlie told me it was the available.  The wife got the dry aged rib eye and the daughter got the wet aged fillet.  The Bison fillet sat on top of some amazing mushroom risotto and came topped with truffle butter.  It was everything I had hoped it would be.  I got to sample the rib eye and fillet and they too were very tasty but we all agreed the Bison Fillet was truly the stand out.     We got two sides - the cream corn and Brussel sprouts.  Both of these were on recommendations of friends.  The cream corn  was unlike any I had ever had.  With the addition of the creamy cheese sauce it was incredible.  The Brussel sprouts were also unique and delicious.  Everything we ordered was amazing.     The ambiance is very classy.  Well decorated with a hint of southern charm.  The live music playing adds to the special feel you get when you spend an evening at Hall's.  With Billy welcoming everyone who entered and checking on every table to make sure all is well gives the fell of being at someones home.  The service was outstanding and our server Carlie was amazing.  Billy and Carlie made our Birthday celebration so special.  We all agreed we can't wait for our next trip to Hall's!"}, {"review_id": "XEoJUqlVklXAGnupakUycw", "user_id": "NzjMpLFtSpM4Ewh98nyycQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "I don't believe there is a single negative thing I can say about Halls Chop House. First off, I went during restaurant week, which is unbelievable busy; however, even though I had a 9 p.m. reservation the hostess was able to squeeze my table in an hour earlier than expected. If not, I would've had to cancel. When I called earlier that day she said to show up when I could, and they would try and get me in asap. It ended up being immediately. Let's talk about service and professionalism! No matter where I went in the building every member from the staff from manager to bus boy greeted me with a smile and that nice southern hospitality. Our server was indeed a professional, was super professional and knowledgeable about the menu and ensure we had an amazing time. Now the food! For restaurant week, the restaurant offers a three-course dinner for $45, which is way under what they usually charge. The salad was of course, a tasty treat to start the evening, but the Filet Mignon was the star of the dinner. My knife slide right through the meat as the added truffle butter melted down the sides. The food was paradise, and might be the best steak I've ever had. Too full from dinner, I regretfully had to take the dessert home. To top off the amazing service about a week later, I received a personalize hand-written note from the staff hoping that myself and my roommate had an enjoyable dinner in the mail."}, {"review_id": "6O3tzpgb3P96ZKsv7LFURw", "user_id": "R3ywtHgNr7BQgDiaOMWEQQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "My favorite stake house!I recommend for everyone in Charleston to go there :) Good service good drinks and great food!"}, {"review_id": "_l3yBdr5I-pTHe_ezoQisw", "user_id": "n4yOLIxQ-RJMdpUNBq_lKQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Where do i start?

We were lucky and grabbed the only two open spots at the bar. It sounds like reservations are made months in advance so we weren't able to book something ahead of time. Literally one of the best restaurant experiences we've ever had. We were greeted at the hostess stand by one of the perceived owners/managers upon arrival who ushered us to the open bar seats. We each ordered a mimosa and decided to split the crab-cake eggs Benedict. Without asking specifically, they delivered this to us on two plates, evenly portioned out (not to mention it was Mr. Hall himself who brought it out and made sure we were all set). The food was delicious. And just the right amount. Looking over the menu, there were a number of other things that stood out (bison nachos to name one) so coming during non-brunch hours wouldn't be any different. When we were leaving, we were thanked by our bartender, the women at the hostess stand and were on our way to explore down town. But then, I kid you not, the same gentleman who welcomed us originally came rushing outside when we were at the corner about to cross the street and yelled \"thanks again for coming\" and gave us a wave goodbye. I've never had a customer service experience like this one. Maybe it's just because we are from the DC area and we aren't used to that, but it was incredible and I would recommend this place to anyone for the delightful ambiance, diverse menu options, and the warm, welcoming feeling left by the employees."}, {"review_id": "34VkkbnIXZ96RXQ1q4Dtxg", "user_id": "NvO3OvFdhkIftdH4xI_94A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/13/2017", "text": "Halls will probably forever win Charlestons' Best Restaurant when Someone Else is Paying and it deserves that moniker, but they also back it up with delicious food and great service.If anyone ever asks me where to go and get a good steak in Charleston, Halls is always my first choice.  Always one of the best steaks I have had throughout the world.  They have a fantastic wedge salad which I can't get enough of.  They never skimp on pours at the bar but the drinks also tend to be a bit more so it kind of balances out.  The sides are generous and come out family style for the table to share. I hear from people quite often that they find the service too overbearing.  I have never felt that way about Halls.  I feel they do a great job of team waiting so that everyone on the staff is aware of what goes where and when without coming to the table and asking.  Your dedicated server is attentive and available without being obnoxious and always very knowledgeable.  I guess they may get this wrap from the owners and their sons who do tend to go out of their way to meet & greet, check-in with and say goodbye to anyone and everyone.Make sure to ask to see the \"meat platter\".  They have every cut of meat they offer on a platter to help speak to various cuts of meat and help you make your selection.I have never been able to pick a single restaurant in Charleston that is favorite but if you put a gun to my head this would be one of a few to go through my head."}, {"review_id": "TfG7ZkrOifbvURZYSc3UrA", "user_id": "7-aC6wdNnGDKqGsFz6DFmg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "Wonderful service, and the best steak of my life.

I have been trying to get my hands on this sucker for SO long.  Every time I went to the bar to try to get it, it was packed and there was just no hope of grabbing a seat.  Of course, I ordered this when I went in for brunch and it did not disappoint.  It's extremely heavy though (or maybe I'm not used to meat?) - I only ate 1/2 of it and it slowed me down until the next day.
