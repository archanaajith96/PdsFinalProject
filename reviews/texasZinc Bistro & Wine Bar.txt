It wasn't busy at all and we were seated right away and I ordered their Frozen Prickly Pear Margarita since yelpers raved about it. It's no lie, it's a delicious cocktail and I wanted more but unfortunately we didn't have enough time to hangout and have more drinks.On to the food: we ordered crab cake appetizer to share, hubby had their fried shrimp po'boy, and I had their spicy spinach artichoke au gratin.  My husband said his po'boy was only ok nothing special about it but good thing it didn't cost much. The spinach artichoke was a bit too salty for my liking. The crab cakes were delicious, I should of got that for my meal instead and it should have came out before our entrees.Service wasn't that great, our waitress came to our table only once after delivering our food. Our entrees came before our appetizer which we thought was weird. I would come here again to taste the other foods on their menu and more frozen prickly pear margaritas! And hopefully get better service!"}, {"review_id": "ZcwlLyijDcwmOzf5HVVIMg", "user_id": "fm2npkf_1BNUPRZQbvJA0Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Years ago I came for happy hour. *This place has an amazing happy hour*My 2nd time to Zinc was at the request of my husband to find someplace \"good\" to eat downtown. I knew that meant off the riverwalk, had food he'd enjoy eating and at least 4stars on yelp. Zinc fit all those criteria! Drinks were delicious. Prickly pear margarita is my favorite there. Might have been a bit too sweet for my husband but I was more than happy to finish his drinkTo start, we ordered the escargot appetizer ($12 for 6 with bread). Can't go wrong with escargot unless you cook it too much and anywhere that serves this in SA is most likely going to make it right... it was perfect! Basically it tastes like butter and garlic. Their bread was perfect for sopping up the remaining butter. Yum! For dinner I got the crab cakes ($14) and my husband got the burger ($10ish). Both entrees were delicious but I was biased to my crab cakes. They had a great flavor with lots of fresh lump crab and the side salad with avocado and greens made the entire meal nice and fresh. Next time maybe i'd ask for no butter sauce at all, it really didn't need it."}, {"review_id": "G5NDoJ2jOHMlPAtzbpUKlg", "user_id": "E16BaL6tk2QQO_FkpExdqA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Friendly staff, relaxed atmosphere, and delicious food!

Very disorganized.  We had to wait around and provided three different people our name before they sat us.  (We had reservations). Food was delicious.  Mac and Cheese is an absolute must have appetizer. Not a huge fan of the pasta primo (sorry cannot think of the exact name) - I felt it had a lot of pesto and overall just average in taste.   We were big fans of the lamb burger.  Definitely A+ on the burger.  Our wait person was amazing.  She did a fantastic job, very personable and attentive."}, {"review_id": "rH4r80jNb8Or8DD3dkt1pQ", "user_id": "nS-g0s-kfunkrk7tFep7Ew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "WOW.

Decent size restaurant, patio seating out back is available.. Good size menu as well.. I ordered the grilled shrimp with veggies.. Really good, big portions, fresh and hot and the dessert was hot chocolate cake cooked to order. Service was ok, i wish the waiters paid more attention to the table so i won't keep looking for him.

We really enjoyed ourselves here. Sadly, we only had time for a quick Lunch, due to a break in our conference. Our sever understood and worked hard on getting us out within forty-five minutes. Nice. The menu is a well thought out invitation to your palate to stay and enjoy. There's Escargot, Faux Gras, Truffled Parmesan Fries, Duck Wing Confit, Calamari - so many choices, and only a limited amount of time. Poor us.  We shared the Sausage Pizza ($12.00) and the Brioche Apple Bread Soufflé ($7.00). Both were light and flavorful.  Just what we wanted. Our bill came to only $22.19 before gratuities.

We were staying at hotel contessa for a conference and this was one of the closest restaurants to the hotel. Took less than 3 minutes to walk here. We ordered the artichoke dip and a pizza to share. We were both filled and thought the food was worth the cost. My only complaint was the waiter. He was clearly grumpy about something and conveyed that grumpiness to us. He also left us at our table when we were ready to pay for at least 20 minutes. Not cool. As long as this waiter isn't here, I'd recommend this place if you're in the area.  It will provide great food, in a nice restaurant, at an affordable price."}, {"review_id": "Gpr1aWQrvYl8jN6ClVrR0A", "user_id": "9RlNNm5-5rMbSeFTQlnPQw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Atmosphere and wait staff were great.

Hoping this would be an enjoyable dinner. However soon after we felt otherwise. One of my friends had ordered the lamb burger medium well and upon arrival it was rare! She didn't even take a bite out of it and she was very disappointed. For Valentines Day, my boyfriend took me here and we hoped it would be enjoyable. We ordered the four course meal which was either a lobster bisque or warm spinach salad, lobster ravioli, black angus center cut fillet or almond crushed red fish, and a chocolate box for dessert. We were informed that they had ran out of ravioli but in substitute had scallops for the second course which was pretty bland. We both ordered the steak and for the cook to be medium. My boyfriend cut into it and it was not cooked to his specifications. My steak was cooked medium, but I tried his to compare and it was definitely undercooked. The next day I had severe stomach pains even after taking antacids. I felt like vomiting throughout the night and the pain would not subside. We will never return or suggest this place to anyone."}, {"review_id": "jQl3K8RWKZuYRGj1R_68sA", "user_id": "W4ASye1w-mpfW3c-MB4XYQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "This is a cute little wine bar located downtown.

I am a huge fan of lamb chops and pretty much anything lamb! Their lamb burger is by far one of the best items I've ever had anywhere. The mixture of the seasonings along with the cheese that they use is just a treat for your tastebuds. My wife isn't a big lamb person but I persuaded her to give mine a try and she didn't want to give it back. Now we order it every time we go and share it with whatever else we order.We tend to order a few dishes and share them then take the rest for lunch the following day. This gives us a chance to really enjoy the various options they offer.They have some really great week day specials. Last time my wife had their salmon and it was great as well.We always start off with the crab cakes for the appetizer....they have this great little pear salad that is a great flavor enhancer and we are never disappointed.The creme brulee is a great treat as well. They do have a small dining area outside on their patio as well. We tend to enjoy sitting at the bar and chatting with the staff to get their insights on the area and daily offerings on the menu as well.

The crab cake was room temperature and swimming in over salted sauce.  The lamb pasta dish was also room temperature but the pasta was overcooked and could have used a little more sauce.  And the side veggies never made it to the table.  Our server said she was checking with the kitchen twice but they never made it.  When it came time to get our check the bill included the MIA veggies.  There was a bit of a wait again, shocker, to have that adjusted as well as close out the bill.  It was clearly an off night at Zinc but one that will not inspire my return in any near future."}, {"review_id": "gAi9NGeD9CgNzTO4wAcbkw", "user_id": "UHBPbOxccPxZA8zYjFU97g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/19/2018", "text": "Best unusual salad yet bursting with flavor and textures is the Texas Chopped Salad at Zinc downtown (tomatoes, sweet dried corn, pepitas / pumpkin seeds, cojita cheese, arugula, pearl couscous, and cured salmon with pesto basil dressing).  It's so good!!!Best truffle fries in SA!!!
