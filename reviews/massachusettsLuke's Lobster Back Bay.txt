The only lobster roll I had this trip to Boston was at Luke's. In fact, this was my first lobster roll ever? Anyway, I came in the late afternoon on Saturday and there was no wait and open tables. It's an order and pay first / then sit down - kinda place. We ordered the lobster roll, lobster mac n cheese, and I came back again afterwards to try the clam chowder. The lobster roll was average - the bun tasted great, the lobster itself wasn't particularly fresh tasting, plump, or had any specific seasoning that stood out. The bun that it was in was very good though, toasted to perfection and super buttery. The bun shouldn't have been the star though, imo. The mac n cheese was too heavy, too buttery, and didn't taste as good as kraft mac n cheese to me. It had the same pieces of lobster chunks as the lobster roll just scattered throughout. Other than that, it's just a bland-ish mac n cheese dish. The clam chowder was my favorite. It was thick, creamy, and hit the spot in every way clam chowder should, especially in the cold Boston weather. There was tons of clams - a few of them were sandy (bleh!) but other than that, the chowder was amazing. It can get a little bit expensive here, a lobster roll will set you back $18, mac n cheese $12, clam chowder $10."}, {"review_id": "HJACuTb-PNJFbxqbNVG5ig", "user_id": "GvP0Elobue-6OU7V33uOoQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "I came here for dinner and had the shrimp roll. My boyfriend ordered the Luke's trio with 1/2 shrimp, crab, and lobster rolls. In addition, we each had a 1/2 lobster tail. Everything was fresh and delicious. My favorite was not the lobster, but the shrimp roll! The seafood was lightly seasoned, not covered in mayo and not greasy. It was a big meal, and I finished feeling full, but not heavy. I do wish they served beer and wine. I had the blueberry lemonade, which was a lot better shaken. I made the mistake of drinking straight from the bottle and was taken aback by it's tartness, but once shaken, it was refreshing and complimented the meal."}, {"review_id": "82JCoRMmHXOVRZT-Q97ISw", "user_id": "bj0VDBtGUPnzm79WxZ-bXA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Coming from LA, I heard that the lobster here in Boston was to die for. Consequently, I was also told to visit Luke's Lobster as it had some of the best lobster roles in town. The rumors are trumors and I absolutely loved it!Ambiance - Located in Back Bay, the surrounding area is very nice! The atmosphere in the restaurant was very nice. There was a decent amount of seating and the restaurant was relatively open. Mostly accommodates parties of 2 or 4. Service -You mostly pay at the counter and they call your number. Nothing too special. I didn't order the food, but my friend said that the employees were pretty nice. Food - I ordered the lobster role, which I was surprised by the portion size. It's like a mini hot dog I guess? It was pretty pricey for the portion size to be honest. However, the roll itself was very good. The lobster was seasoned extremely well and the bun itself was very crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The bun as also very nice and buttery which I was obsessed with. Definitely better than any lobster I've had in LA!Overall, I was very into this place. Just wish the prices were a bit lower or the portion was a bit more."}, {"review_id": "vOxUYwYW6zhkjw3M4yh73Q", "user_id": "O54qpaPFcfpR9rf7f6Ltag", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Overall: Quick, easy, and delicious! Luke's is a must if you're in the mood for lobster but don't need a waited-on experience.The good: The lobster roll was incredible. Not too buttery, well portioned, and stuffed into fresh bread. Other rolls that I've had used poor bread and it really does make a difference. The mac n cheese that we ordered was equally as delicious with hefty chunks of lobster spread throughout. The cole slaw wasn't mayo based, which was refreshing and paired well with the roll. Lastly, the cookies (extra $$), while expensive, were a perfect note to end on. The atmosphere is easy and straightforward, just walk in, order, and sit down.The not-so-good: The prices are a bit too much if you're coming for lunch or a casual dinner, and we spent $65 for two people. They didn't have any fries which I was craving to go along with my roll, just chips (probably better for my health anyway). The mac n cheese took a bit to come out too, roughly 10 mins.Atmosphere: 8/10Service: 9/10Food: 9/10"}, {"review_id": "Mnh4EBvOAsugtbA4Loty2w", "user_id": "J9mHpteG5XVio6NqcwHPCg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Neat spot with simple, yummy wares.

However, if you want something simple and quick, Luke's does a great job! I had the Luke's trio to get sampling of their crab, lobster and shrimp roll. All 3 were great, it was seasoned nicely and had large chunks of lobster and crab with great texture. The roll was nicely buttered and toasted.

I know right?!? What the hell kid! I decided to end this travesty and got my as* to Luke's for a lobster roll. The line moves fast and the staff is quick. They were making those lobster rolls and calling names... mine took a while to make...  mine never came actually! They lost my ticket but the moment I let them know they had my lobster roll out in seconds and offered a free drink and chips. Hey you know what? Shit happens. And they made sure to fix their mistake immediately. Thanks guys! Oh yeah... this is a review I'm suppose to write about the food... write about the food! The lobster roll was delicious... nice big pieces of lobster lots of lobster. The bread, the bread... the bread was nice and buttery and the perfect addition to the lobster. All in all great experience ... the rolls seems a little pricey at about $21 with tax.

It's fast casual here so you can order then sit and wait for your food to be done. It doesn't take that long either but we ate at an off time. Clam chowder here isn't the best, or really warm enough, but it was still good. The small trio of mini sandwiches is cute and a great way to try all their sandwiches, but portions are not enough (I could probably eat 6 of them if I was really hungry). The regular sized roll is where it's at. They don't have a warm lobster roll option though."}, {"review_id": "c1ZSra0LyLSvC_yrhv6fKA", "user_id": "X2utujyHSNpj6wXVmC_xpQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "It's hard for me to wrap my mind around what Luke's Lobster actually is. You order at the counter and seat yourself much like you would at a fast food restaurant. The Mac n cheese is packaged and is made by sticking the packet in hot water, much like you would expect at a fast food restaurant. But these aren't fast food prices! Now I understand, lobster is super expensive and the lobster roll we got was delicious, although they definitely skimped on the lobster (see picture), but if you're gonna charge $15 for lobster Mac n cheese, at least give me some fresh pasta and a large enough serving that could fill my 4 year old nephews belly.Again, the lobster roll was delicious and the lobster Mac n cheese was delicious. I just had those minor issues (skimpy with the lobster, packaged pasta, small serving). Not to mention they need to step up their game when it comes to sides! The space itself was very clean and has a super casual ambiance. Go for a cheaper lobster roll than most places in the city, but unlike most of their pictures lead you to believe, you might have bites that are mostly bread. Side note: When reviewing pictures posted by others (don't be confused by the pictures posted by the owners, of course those look good) the lobster rolls look like they have ample amounts of lobster and the Mac n cheese has chunks of lobster on top when it is first served. So it's fairly possible that my experience was an outlier or that this was an off night as my lobster roll was seriously lacking meat and the Mac n cheese did have some lobster mixed in but there was none on top when it was first brought to the table."}, {"review_id": "MCSsX-pHd6-4wDXMB4W2Ag", "user_id": "s-kmSDkixx6Vw_n7hmMPsw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Definitely a must when you go to Boston!

It's walking distance from a bunch of hotels near Copley Square. The decor has a nice nautical vibe to it. They have a variety of local beverages too. You order at the counter and they bring the food to you. The place is pretty small so it can get packed quickly. We got the lobster roll, lobster mac and cheese, and lobster grilled cheese. Lobster roll: made with a secret seasoning, but I didn't really taste it. Has a traditional taste. Nothing exciting about it. Lobster Mac and Cheese: decent amount of lobster with a lot of creaminess. It's a lot to eat on your own so I recommend getting it as a side to share. Lobster grilled cheese: yummy! If we didn't get the Mac and cheese, one of the soups would have paired perfectly with it.
