A lot to love about this place. Great decor and space inside. Warm and inviting on a cool fall day. The food was really good overall. I particularly enjoyed the linguini and clams. Lots of clams in the sauce and a generous portion. Clams casino though weren't as good. Small clams for that dish are a weakness. The anti pasta plate though made up for it. Service was a bit of a let down. Our server was good but very pushy interrupting business conversations and encouraging us to order quickly. At a place like this, I would've appreciated someone a little more understated and understanding. That said, enjoyed the lunch. A very good call downtown."}, {"review_id": "zR6F-HYBm-y1zTIMhGMFNg", "user_id": "eRl2j4ugc3cRdt4QLnEN8A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "This restaurant has been a go to for me and my friends for a while now.  Our apps were as good as ever. The Spiedina Romano was absolutely delicious. This is always a must have here. The Spicy Beef Filet was good as well. I personally liked that it was well done but my dining friends didn't. Now onto dinner. My chicken dish was good. Can't really mess up chicken.  Two of my friends had veal which was tough and not up to the standards of this restaurant.  The eggplant on one dish was tough and undercooked. The waitress was amazing and we were treated well.  The owner recovered our experience nicely by comping dessert."}, {"review_id": "bAbl3EJ35_wgZ6fAqvuKuA", "user_id": "ycwfESteR_lqIeCZxz35rw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "I do have to commend this place, sitting at the bar the entire evening.Our bar tenders were excellent, attentive and on point!   Never once did we wait for few seconds to have someone attend to our group and bring drinks.

The staff is friendly and welcoming. However, the decor (in my opinion) is outdated but it was still nice inside. Very clean and comfortable atmosphere. Our server wasn't very attentive and didn't check in on us often.The food was very traditional old school Italian. In my opinion, the menu needs a bit of a face lift. I had spaghetti with meat sauce and sadly it was lacking in flavor. However, I had the \"skyscraper\" for dessert and it was very delicious."}, {"review_id": "bmCnuFupXjLMo8voyNSYHQ", "user_id": "XlCP15THtQxIBGB9H55v8A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "Everything was fantastic at this place...

When we got there we found out they typically don't serve their full menu between 3 and 5 p.m., but were able to accommodate us about 4:15 p.m. My husband and I both started off with salads, I got a Caesar and he got a regular Garden.  Mine was  really overdressed, and his was fresh but the salad dressing was bland. My husband had the prime rib, mixed mashed potatoes and veggies. Although he said the meat was good it  didn't have any seasoning nor did the potatoes or vegetables. Everything  tasted bland and needed some salt and pepper. I had the lasagna. It had clearly been reheated and the bottom layer was burnt with fresh cheese on top. It too lacked seasoning.And the bread was cold. I wouldn't return."}, {"review_id": "AumeKuJaZSBSStGsGnvwGg", "user_id": "mW9mfw4kCOoI5BeeW9sPUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/28/2017", "text": "I love Ralph n Rich's.

After this previous experience, however, I don't know that I would come back unless it was for a drink and some shrimp cocktail at the bar (you can never go wrong with the bar here between the great bartenders and the shrimp are absolutely massive and worth the price). We came for my mother's birthday and were seated promptly. Our waitress approached and gave us a very robotic speech during which she stared at the ceiling the whole time. It seems like she's had her spiel memorized for about 30 years. Weirdness aside, she returned to take our orders. I asked for the half chicken at which time she immediately told the ceiling \"half a chicken, half an hour\". I requested to have my meal on a separate ticket so my family didn't have to wait for me and she said that was not possible. Having worked in the restaurant business, I am still confused as to how it is not possible to get my meal on a separate ticket. Whatever, forget the chicken, I got my usual delicious cavatelli and broccoli with some grilled shrimp which were extremely flavorful! While I was satisfied with my food, we were all about halfway through our meals before the bottle of wine arrived that we had ordered right after the food, so again, that was disappointing. Lastly, it appears this place has a thing with massive seafood...my brother's girlfriend ordered the Zuppa Di Pesce which was perfectly good except for the incredibly large mussels. Unfortunately they were so large, they were extremely tough, fishy, and pretty much inedible. Overall this experience was just kinda meh but primarily for service reasons (and this isn't the first service mishap, we have just overlooked that issue for years). The food has never been terrible aside from this mussel experience. Bottom Line: Eat dinner at the bar and you will be satisfied"}, {"review_id": "X7f9zlvftu2JpNo5hEwmMQ", "user_id": "L38ZsoFvy6LNDuKK7odUXA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/20/2017", "text": "We arrived on time for our 7:45 reservation and were seated in the front area across the bar.  The smells were amazing.  The food was all very good, the pacing was a bit off.  We ordered the grilled octopus to start which took too long to arrive, even the bread was slow to arrive.  The entrees were even slower to arrive.  The quality and taste of the food were well worth waiting for.  Service was prompt and attentive.  We almost licked the plate of the spaghetti.Overall, a good experience I just would have preferred the food pacing to have been better."}, {"review_id": "96t5yCivdZZL10bqs5jFjw", "user_id": "KZLJuslw6hx0rbzXKMlYUg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "Always dependable to be gracious, generous and delicious, this long-time Bridgeport staple is a 'Sunday sauce' kind of Italian restaurant.
