We were lucky to come at an odd time at 1:30 on a Monday, to there was a line down the street.The staff was all friendly and helpful throughout our lunch. I ordered the Tacos Don Ramon and loved them. The meat had the perfect amount of spice and the tortillas were fantastic. The tortillas did fall apart easily but it worked out fine.My captain had the Enchiladas Amarillo's with a side of rice and beans and loved them as well. He said the sauce tied the dish all together.Overall, it's definitely a higher price point for a small Mexican joint but definitely higher quality than other places."}, {"review_id": "jay3p1YjSsyet7Tx0br_Rw", "user_id": "Smgw7w_rSiHGp_M-0bSExw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "First, let me justify my review by saying, I live in LA. Authentic Mexican food is everywhere. I was referred to Red Iguana from the attendant at the hotel. She said it was really popular. The place seemed to be packed, there was a 35 minute wait. I wondered around, checking the place out and noticed were quite a few empty tables. There is no bar area. I was by myself. I would've liked to sit at a bar. The service was fast and the food came out quickly.  Except for the interaction between employees, I didn't see any server smile at a guest. The food, was nothing special, but was priced like it was. I ordered a combo of beef taco, chicken enchilada and a relleno it came with a side of dried rice and refried beans. The beans were good. I did not like the relleno. The pepper was pickled. I'm not sure what kind of pepper they used. Next time I'm in Salt Lake City, I will skip this place.  I do have to mention, they have many specialty margaritas at $7. I wanted a plain no frills margarita, which is what I ordered. I was surprised to see my no frills margarita was $9 (vida margarita). Don't know what that is, but wasn't worth it. Marjorie was my server. Hmmm?"}, {"review_id": "mtU4ZKnkCI8QxsOCoyzcEQ", "user_id": "RHe7LLQrjc1p-6kR1kLhmw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "I don't get the hype. I've been passing the Red Iguana on North Temple for a few months and have seen groups of people waiting outside to be seated, so I decided to see what the hype was all about. I went around 1:30 p.m with my husband and we waited only 10 minutes and the place was pretty packed and the inside is larger than expected and a lot of seating as the building obviously has been extended over the years. Anyways, I ordered the Mango enchilada and then I was asked did I want rice an beans? Yes, of course, she said that'll be a extra charge. Wow, I thought but I was here for the whole experience so I said that's fine. My husband ordered the chicken chimichanga and he too had the rice &beans as well. Our food came fast right after ourdrinks and the Mango enchilada was pretty tasty but the beans and rice, I could have passed on. My husbands chimichanga was more like a wet burrito and was little disappointed especially with the beans & rice as well. So after all this, I don't get the hype. No Lunch Specials, No Rice & Beans without an additional charge and $45 for lunch for two. Overrated and mediocre at best."}, {"review_id": "shDfmjimHtjsru2ulrc9Gw", "user_id": "GO1_SF6z1a3otwSg2fbJrA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I was in SLC for a conference and we had a pretty disappointing 4 days. All the other highly rated places were a huge letdown and just overall blah. Multiple uber drivers and locals had recommended this place but we still weren't expecting much. Our flight out got delayed and we had a couple hours to kill. We were pretty full from our late lunch but figured we had nothing to lose. We decided to order the puntas de filete a la nortena and a the killer nachos. We perked up a little when we started munching away on the chips and salsa and realized the salsa was super flavorful. The puntas de filete came first and it was AMAZING. The almond mole that came with it was rich and creamy. It had hints of pumpkin or butternut squash or something. When combined with the well seasoned meat and thrown on a flour tortilla, it was perfect. The nachos were also packed full of flavor. Instead of the usual ground meat, we had big chunks of pork. One of the better orders of nachos i've eaten, I just wished I had ordered an entree to take advantage of how well they melded their flavors though. I wish I had gone to Red Iguana earlier in the trip because I would have definitely come back!"}, {"review_id": "VjkcrFPYSWGynN7cLA4-3w", "user_id": "SJDysCSblVV6R-Ll2BECFA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "It was our second time eating here. I have to say our server was very nice but they were so busy it was hard to get his attention. My man had the fish tacos and I had the gringas. The fish tacos were very good! The sauce that comes with them was so good! The coleslaw that came with the tacos tasted like straight vinegar. It was inedible. The gringas were pretty good but i was expecting a bit more flavor. We both had a Michelada to drink. Now, I like mine spicy but they were a bit over the top spicy. My boyfriend couldn't drink his. Over all I would probably eat here again."}, {"review_id": "-hBUw5P0FKAjIH5u6TLOeA", "user_id": "fz9Iw7hltRd0zUBVXBl6Qg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Came for lunch on a Saturday around 1pm and we did have to wait outside for about 35 min but that was expected. Outside they have menus so you can get an idea of what you want to eat and it was kind of warm so there was a water station which was nice. We were seated at table for 2 off in a little corner and the service was good but not great. The server was very friendly and knowledgable of the menu and specials but forgot to bring our guacamole to go with the complimentary chips and salsa and kind of gave us less attention after our order was placed. Someone else delivered the food and refilled the drinks. Nonetheless, we both ordered the chicken enchiladas suizas and the food was brought out very quickly, served hot and tasted excellent. I've never had mole before so it was a different taste to me but I liked it. You can definitely taste the chocolate and it's a rich texture. Beans and rice basic but good. You have to order them separately as they're not included with enchiladas. I like this place, I really do. Reasonably priced, yummy food, pretty big menu. If I'm in the area again (and not in a hurry) I want to come back and check out some of the other menu options and desserts."}, {"review_id": "8M7A4DTLyHNLByKit-zufw", "user_id": "z_9oeZ5aN8g8AzPNENht8w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "On a day after my mini-accident on the Park City slopes, I decided to go for some exploring in the city.  It's about a 45 minute drive.  This place does not have a bar so you are forced to wait outside if there are no tables available.It was on top of my list as a foodie location.. I don't know if it really warrants the 4.5 star rating.  Let me note that I am not Mexican and I live in California.  I am not a Mexican food connoisseur.With that said, they have a ton of tables which is awesome.. the spicy margarita was a bit disappointing.  Chips and salsa was very middle of the road (no more special to me than a chain like Chevy's).  I also got the famous steak tacos.  It's good but it's not like amazing great... well, at least to me.

It was just 3 sad little tacos with a side of cabbage and sour cream. The cabbage and sour cream didn't really make the taco come together as well. I tried one of the carne asada tacos and it was better then the fish taco. So for this one time, I would not recommend the fish tacos. But the complimentary chips and salsa were out of sight, we devoured like 3 bowls.

The food is fantastic. The service is awesome. I've had the same waiter both times and he was great. He was very attentive, relied out drinks and chips immediately and did a great job explaining all of the molé to us.  The mojitos are the best I have had in the entire state of Utah and I have yet to have a bad meal at either Red 1 or 2. Only down side to Red 1 is standing outside in a not so great area of SLC. The bum with the mansion of a cart and bum supplies is always there and makes standing there a little uncomfortable. The cider is great though and does good to warm you.

So we waited outside for an hour (it was a Friday night) and too late to make a reservation. I figured it must be good as there was a large line waiting with us in the rain in a crappy area. Once we finally got in the service was quick and the chips and salsa were complimentary and tasty. We each also got a specialty margarita that was good not amazing. For my entree I got a chimichanga and he got enchiladas. My chimichanga was soaked in what tasted like Chef Boyardee sauce and his was on the sweet side rather than savory and swimming in the sauce. The guacamole was not very good either, no flavor or heat.

Red Iguana was at the top of my list. Luckily on my last night in town my friend and I were able to stop by. We got there on a Thursday around 7:30 and were told it would be an hour wait. We went for a little walk while we waited but nothing is really nearby except some motels and laundromats. Luckily we came back within a half hour and our table was ready! Much faster turn over time than expected. When you do have to wait a long time they have heaters to wait under. From the outside this place is deceiving, it has a dive bar feel to it but it very large inside. There are multiple rooms (we were sat in the back room) with little piñatas hanging from the ceiling. For drinks, I got the La Damiana - which is one of their signature margaritas - on the rocks and my friend got a piña colada.  They have an overwhelmingly large menu and you will want to order everything. For an appetizer we split mole negro with chicken - this was a huge portion and was so delicious. Every bite was so flavorful. For dinner we were originally going to order two of the red iguana plates (which has an enchilada, taco, flauta with guac and sour cream, a chile relleno and a beef tostada). Thankfully our waitress was looking out and let us know it was A LOT of food so she came back after the mole and let us decide if we wanted 1 or 2. We were pretty full from the mole so we went with one order and this is was SO MUCH FOOD. Everything was so fresh and tasty. I am so happy we had the chance to stop by the Red Iguana! If you find yourself in SLC - this is a must."}, {"review_id": "6knbv86597JaMWnjhwWNPQ", "user_id": "NtqYrwGtG_ARngmeR915qw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "HECK YES! It's about freaking time I crawled out of my house and made the trek over here! As you know, there are always 5 billion people, a couple of chickens, three news reporters, and an alien that gets their name on the reservation list before I do. Making my wait over an hour. Luckily they have a couple of heaters outside that you can stand under, and it wasn't incredibly cold the night I ventured over, but that would definitely not be an ideal situation if it had been chilly. I wish they would give you a beeper, or take your phone number, so you could sit in your car and wait for your name to emerge at the top of the list. When my group (7 of us) finally got seated, there were chips and salsa awaiting our arrival. We dove right in and BOY OH BOY some of the best I've ever had! Salty, crispy, thick and durable chips with some of the yummiest salsa--not too spicy but not bland either. I wish I could've taken some home. We only saw our waitress twice the entire night. A risky move, but it totally worked in their favor. She came, gave a few suggestions, took our order and then delivered it perfectly to all of us. Luckily no one needed to change their order or send a plate back, but if they had, we probably would've had to do it ourselves, as the waitress was busy serving 15 other tables. The water boy/chip replenish-er gets a solid 5 stars. He was always on top of things and made sure we never ran out of our beverage. The food was so good. I ordered the chicken tacos, honestly SO YUMMY. The lettuce, salsa, guacamole, and sour cream was an added bonus and made it that much better. My sister got the chimichanga and it had some sort of cinnamon flavor to it. Not really my favorite, and if I had to tell you what to get, I'd say the tacos all. the. way. Pleasant and delicious, what more could you ask for? TIPS & TRICKS: * Live music is played, and the performers sound great! They sing Happy Birthday to your friend, George, if you ask politely. * There are a couple of places to sit and hunker down while you wait for your reservation."}, {"review_id": "MWdVIVlCD2kAA8S2i3L1sg", "user_id": "_MdjKC6DaPk11p6IjSfIkg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Live in Texas.

I do notice that once your food comes they tend to leave you alone a little too long because I've had to chase down a waiter for more refills and other items we need. Also the past few times they've been bringing food out as it's cooked, so dishes would come out separately. The cool thing this time was them bringing out samples of the mole to try before deciding to order.. gives you a chance to sample and change your mind on what you order.I can't say enough about their food as with all other reviews, their food quality and flavor exceed your expectations!
