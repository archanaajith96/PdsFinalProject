We had to stand in a line that went out the door to order our food at the counter, but it moved fast! We had a party of 12 and were able to get a huge table to fit us all right away. They also have a great back patio with a lot of seating space. All of the food was AMAZING. Everyone in our party could not stop talking about what they ordered. I had the egg, cheese, and ham breakfast sandwich. It was delicious and very filling. It came with a pretty large simply salad. A couple people got the club sandwich which they raved about as well (it was a large portion and could be shared!). The American breakfast and French toast were huge hits too!  We also had to try the cinnamon roll and chocolate chip cookies. YUM. Highly recommend!"}, {"review_id": "B-3OdVIj1wEWJiCBNQ6hYg", "user_id": "WpCNsz24sa8WKPNjOcz6ew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Delicious and fun and not too unhealthy.We ordered so much and shared so I got to try 5 different breakfasts!!

The food is tasty, ambiance is cool (though it can get fairly loud), and they have good options for food as well as coffee/tea. It has been really busy every time I've been there, usually with a wait of 20 minutes or more. When you walk in, you head straight to the counter (or get in the line) to order your food. After that, you wait for a table to open up (or if you know what you want, get someone else in your party to order for you while you scope out seats). I'm not a coffee drinker, so I can't comment on that, but the food is filling and delicious.

Amazing coffee, stellar vegan friendly breakfast, great staff, and a great environment! The Vegan Mud Slinger is super tasty, as is the Spicy Tofu Scramble. I had the rosemary and honey latte with oat milk and was so happy with it! My second visit I got a Colombian pour over which was also spectacular. The patio offers wonderful sunlight as well as shady spaces. Just watch where you sit! The kitchen needs access to the garage in the back and they will barrel through. Honestly that's the only reason I knocked of a star. Sitting in a chair in a spot they placed I was worried about getting run over! But the food, coffee, and atmosphere made up for it.

The place has a really cool eclectic feel to it, everywhere you look there's some different and interesting. Fits in really well for the area they are in.There are some things that you might want to know before you dine at Mudhouse.- This place gets BUSY during the normal lunch hours. So if you are coming, plan on getting here before the lunch rush or after the lunch rush.- Seating is difficult if you are looking for a table for more than 2. Most tables fit 2.- Order at the counter, and they will bring your food to you. Don't forget to bus your own table!- Grab a glass on the shelf and use the water spiget for water.Everything I've had here has been fresh and tasted amazing. The prices are great for the quality and portions you get. I really don't think you could go wrong, but I recommend trying the roasted potatoes with onion dip as Sarah S had recommended. They are incredible!Check this place out for a great breakfast/brunch/lunch place! You won't be disappointed!"}, {"review_id": "1G_KpPsFApiczSXQLHmcWQ", "user_id": "GS6g_BVu38AXLEVu8Vc55Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "I'm writing the most basic 1-star review for The Mud House, because it literally was that - basic.The backstory: What drew me to stop here were previous Yelp reviews and mentions of house-made marshmallows. I had a game plan and was ready to go in, order my hot cocoa with the marshmallow!After waiting maybe 15-20 minutes in line, I was finally up and about to order. I asked about the marshmallow, but the cashier said, \"Oh we stopped making those,\" then looked at me to order. No explanation or \"sorry about that.\" Luckily, I had a second order in mind. I ordered a flavored latte, and my bf ordered a cold-brew plus we had two Topo Chicos. No big deal. The bill came out to about $14. Okay. So we take our little sign, so my latte could be delivered to my table and walk away.I was upset, but this is not why I'm giving this place 1-star.The place was nice and Jam-Packed, but I still tried looking for a seat. No seats were available. At this point I was frustrated and opted to sit outside. Whatever. We sat outside for maybe 5 minutes and then checked inside again for seats where it was warmer. Luckily we found a couple of of those high-chair seats against a tall wall table. By that point I think 10 minutes had passed and still no latte. Another 10 minutes. STILL. NO. LATTE. I finally went to the counter 5 feet away from us and asked the barista what was going on. She looked at me, shrugged, and said, \"I didn't get that ticket,\" then continued to make someone else's coffee. I, at the least, expect her to ask me for my receipt, and let me know she'd have it out. Instead, the lady who took our order asked me what was up and I explained to her that I had not received my coffee. It took way to long to get a coffee out. I ended up taking it to go.Lack of good customer service is the greatest pet peeve of mine when taking my business to anyone.It's not hard. Never going back here."}, {"review_id": "ncXEkxPtYjEqwz9RkIrWLg", "user_id": "0IlYueSiTdL7qC8pSZ7Pvg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/28/2017", "text": "The Mud House -- or-- my partner and I's new favorite breakfast place.I've heard the name thrown around a few times and on a whim we decided to give it a try!We both ordered the American Breakfast. My first choice was the French Toast but I was in the mood for something savory. The food was perfectly seasoned. The bacon stood out to me. just perfect. If you like your bacon burnt then this isn't for you (why people think burnt bacon is standard astounds me). My partner wasn't impressed by the coffee and said the blueberry muffin was lacking. However, for the latter I think it's because blueberries aren't in season. The atmosphere is fun and hip. The staff are helpful and friendly. Our cashier gave me a crow sign placard just because it matched my outfit.My friend will be coming to visit me from Portland in a few weeks. Guess where I'll be taking them."}, {"review_id": "M7uUuHtxnTGu2zZej6TfQQ", "user_id": "h7p-GuaHFGsiKCF4g6Bjqg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Charming coffee shop and cafe in the heart of Cherokee Street! My friend and I stopped in for breakfast last weekend when we were visiting St. Louis, and we both really enjoyed our experiences! I got a cappuccino and the English breakfast (2 eggs over easy, baked beans, bacon, greens, mushrooms, toast and jam). Great coffee, and the English breakfast, while not completely traditional, was very tasty! My friend got the curried French lentils with poached eggs, which she enjoyed! The cafe is very charming - one wall is lined with books, the others with eclectic items, and the bathroom lined with board game boards! It seemed very popular and was quite busy (almost no open tables) around 9 on a Saturday morning!"}, {"review_id": "CjzeGhp1SO4csUut9zjTIg", "user_id": "sV33d2ZTPtIayMKWuZ9-Rg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "It was ok.

My friends and I saw the number of reviews and saw 4 stars and thought- \"wow this must be a place we need to try when in St. Louis.\" Trust me- if you don't make it here, you're not missing out. We waited in line for about 15 minutes to order food on a Saturday morning. I got the The Club sandwich and asked to substitute the wheat bread to brioche (because if I'm getting a club sandwich with bacon, I'm not trying to be healthy). There was an up charge for that, which I wasn't notified about. The sandwich was just fine with some hot sauce- the bread was nice and thick and it also came with a side salad. All indoor seating was full so we ate on the back patio. A few friends got some of their unique coffee and said it was pretty good. It seemed like their pickles and simple syrup (coffee) were made in house. I love when a restaurant makes things in house. Hipster vibe at Mud House but nothing special- I probably won't be back."}, {"review_id": "nkop2CA8EslAQgZ-9VwJ9A", "user_id": "gDeBfeC4aopuzSh6YO37Vw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/21/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Waited in line for 25 minutes.

I wanted a refund and even then I had to wait in line and wait some more for them to process my refund. What did I say last time...? Clusterfuck. Sucks because I really wanted to eat here today.

The couple of times I've visited I have yet to see anyone not order food here. I'm sure it happens, but I haven't seen it yet. With Breakfast and lunch served all day I ordered one of their popular breakfast items, the Banana Walnut French Toast. Huge soft and fluffy piece of toast topped with bananas, walnuts, and powdered sugar...delish and a reccomended choice if you love breakfast food.Lunch time here is super busy, but things quiet down after about 1pm with everyone on their laptops, so if your trying to study come after the lunch rush.Seating is...enoug inside and outside.As one of the more popular coffeehouses in Saint Louis, The Mud House is definitely worth the visit."}, {"review_id": "BCwdrjjt-scOAp9xhD50pw", "user_id": "LEzSNB-7eCpET3ZMLcAMGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "I love this place! We went on the spur of the moment, choosing among all the possibilities on Cherokee St. We sat outside on the back porch and pretended we're having a real spring this year. I got the Mud Slinger - veggie chili with roasted potatoes and sunny side up eggs. Delish! The chili tasted really fresh and spiced just right, the potatoes were crisp on at least one side which I love, and the eggs were done so the yellow was runny but the white wasn't. They had the best iced mocha I've ever tasted. I'm not a coffee drinker so I only had a sip, but it made me wish I could tolerate coffee.
