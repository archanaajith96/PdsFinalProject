They have a very nice selection of new and used books as well as a gallery with local art and a coffee shop with good cold brew coffee and baked goods. The store is in a neat historic building downtown on a tree-lined street with restaurants and shops. We will definitely stop here again if we're in the area."}, {"review_id": "wCIPTLAYsrewVI5NNkRakg", "user_id": "Iroh99odqkEAPXKqWgyYAQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "A fun neighborhood bookstore in Charleston.

They have a wonderful cafe where you can always get a delicious cup of coffee. And then there's the fresh goodies. If you like blueberries, you have to try their blueberry scones.

An old school, community book store, evoking an environment wrapped in exploration of unknown tails, fascinating adventures, and caffeinated dreams and alcohol fueled bravado. Reminds me of small independent bookstores on the west coast, or those you happened to stumble upon which demonstrate that print is not dead and that words still matter.Enjoyed my time looking through the stacks (although not extensive) the wood floors and high bookshelves wrap you with a feeling of warmth and contentment. What they don't have in the store they will order.Granted - they can't compete with Amazon, but continuing to support such a store goes beyond price. Anytime I travel, I seek such locations and patronize them with my hard earned dollars. Sometimes it is not about how much money you save, but the price you pay to keep a keystone of a community thriving.Enjoy the bookstore!

Bookstore-wise it's a nice place with a decent selection of new and backlist books. New stuff sometimes has some kind of minor discount but not always, i.e. Yes, you can get it cheaper from Amazon. That said, you buy here you're supporting a local store that employs local people and that itself serves and supports the community. Even though I'm an Amazon Prime customer I get much of my reading material here. They host author meet and greets and carry local authors, too. So, good on them for that. Good selection of periodicals and artisinal greeting cards as well.The coffee shop is okay. The drip coffees aren't all that great but the espresso drinks are solid. The baked goods are always tasty too. And, on weekends, there's usually some live music. Score. Also, I once stood in line behind Ben Affleck there, giving me a decent Brush With Greatness story. Ask me about it sometime.Parking kinda sucks but hey, it's downtown Charleston, what can you do?
