Unlike baseball two strikes and I'm out. The first time I came here I had a taco salad with cold, tasteless ground beef. Awful. I asked for the manager and she came over and was rude and unaccommodating.  My wife and I paid our bill and left.Tried a Burger this time. Fries were awful, Burger was undercooked and I didn't bother sending it back or asking for the manager this time.  Sometimes we learn it is easier to walk away then engage in a discussion over poor food"}, {"review_id": "lolCnA0GpyJbP-qkGYMgSw", "user_id": "0d2CBHBMsGSSaQ_XVzxWaw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "One of the best bars in Aurora, lots of great beer choices and amazing bar food."}, {"review_id": "0cfuM4Ho7_RQ1pcIrSwtWg", "user_id": "kVlHGxy1YkapLt3mVnONAw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Great restaurant and service!

The beer menu is always awesome. The free nacho chips and cheese is a positive gesture but the cheese is out of a can and you can tell. I passed on it. We eventually needed to eat something. We chose the Irish nachos. These nachos were devoured but not for the reasons you may think. The nachos basically had waffle fries, caned cheese and sour cream. When you are drinking, even white castle seems heavenly. Beyond that, its nice décor and ambience. If they can get the food quality under control, it would be 4 star for sure."}, {"review_id": "HuMgDH9zTOqW58v_6MWclA", "user_id": "VfPIjN-nziRJ6vGLfD1T0Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "Consistent food, great drinks!!!

During warm weather hours they also have an outdoor patio. Everything to like here, really glad to have found this location.  Cheers!"}, {"review_id": "6H2EmDAwagSCbkAwMAgvEQ", "user_id": "43k6tixyp_3TFymMaN7CLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Yummy food and friendly servers.

What wonderful service we had at your restaurant tonight. My husband and I were looking for an all you can eat Friday Fish Fry. Our dilemma is that my husband is disabled and we only have a limited time to enjoy dinner. He is unable to wait. We called another restaurant (Bulldog Ale in Bolingbrook ) and they were completely unwilling to work with us. I called your restaurant next and your hostess was so friendly and compassionate on the phone. She said it would be no problem to hold a table for us. Even more, she reserved a table close to the hostess stand so he didn't have to walk far. We instantly felt welcomed into this restaurant that we had never been to before. The wait staff, the runners, the hostess ~ everyone we spoke to was very friendly. And to top it off ~ the food was wonderful! We will definitely be back to your restaurant and we will highly recommend it to others."}, {"review_id": "spowyORK_u-FkFR1skDsCg", "user_id": "uaI94l9Meh9_ru--GxsZ2w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Mcbride's is one of my favorite places.

Atmosphere is gopd ip bu the bar, but the food is average at best. I feel while owned by the same people, the food/kitchen is much better at their original location in S. Plainfield. Food came out quickly, but is bland and nothing special. Chips and queso complimentary,  but no attempts at refilling by the staff, service was good overall.ADDITIONALLY, I think they need a thorough cleaning of their kitchen, BOTH my wife and I had significant stomach issues within 1-hr of eating there (running to the bathroom), not saying anything beyond that. We only both ate the queso.BEER MENU - slightly above average if you like craft beer, but there is almost nothing on this menu you can't find easily right down the road at the local liquor store. If you're going to have a craft beer selection you should always have a couple things I can't find easily or already have in my fridge at home. Unless you're going for only drinks, I'd pass. Plenty of other places worth your $30."}, {"review_id": "-8weaQebR28mJ6kXg6e--w", "user_id": "BfBgM61cIXgrFUv0OwReoA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/26/2017", "text": "Great food.
