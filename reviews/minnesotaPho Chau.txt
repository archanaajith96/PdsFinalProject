This might be the best soup in town. It is as far as I can tell.You'll get a huge bowl of beef broth soup when you order the Pho. I recommend the Beef and Brisket, with 1/2 noodles and 2x meat ... if you're a meat lover like I am.All the menu items are excellent. I have a hard time from ordering anything but the Pho. The Pho is that good.Tip: you will have a hard time parking. There are some spots in the rear of the restaurant Jackfruit smoothie is pretty amazing, and a flavor not easily found outside of Asia. It's like a custard smoothie, but much better than custard."}, {"review_id": "9UgiKMtUv2FhKoS3l5uvBQ", "user_id": "qZeX1ZZkN7DXk10keuGOhg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "It may not look like much from the outside, but Pho Chau was bustling with customers on a Friday night. Despite this, we were able to get a table right away. The shrimp spring rolls were quite good. Generously sized, and packed with fresh vegetables made for a crisp appetizer. The chicken lemongrass vermicelli bowl was excellent. Portions for the entrees were huge. The vegetables were crisp, the noodles cooked to perfection, the chicken packed with flavor. The sliced beef with curry, onion, and coconut milk was also extremely delicious. It has a hint of spice, yet was smooth and creamy. We had a great meal, good service, and all for $18. That kind of experience is hard to beat! Try Pho Chau today!"}, {"review_id": "hi4wq9_mFHrKwMPS3fz9Xg", "user_id": "Ro1cwVOxxvumL_hksSLQqg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "I should be honest and start by writing that I'm not the biggest pho fan in the world. Soups in general aren't my thing, but it's nice to have some on a cold winter day, and the alternative options on the menu were excellent.My wife and I tried the beef pho, egg rolls, spring rolls, and shrimp Pad Thai. The pho was pretty standard. Good flavor, fast service, but not enough beef (maybe five or six pieces of meat). Plenty of noodles, broth, sprouts, etc. The egg rolls (essentially fried spring rolls) were very good, great dipping sauce. Spring rolls also delicious, with a good sauce. The Pad Thai was definitely my favorite part of the meal; smoky flavor, wide egg noodles (unusual), plenty of shrimp and sauce. Would definitely get that dish again, but would experiment with other dishes on the menu, rather than pho.Good location, easy to get in and out, limited parking, but not too limited, friendly staff, and definitely a popular lunch spot. We arrived right as the place opened, but by the time we left, there were barely any seats left. Would return, no questions asked."}, {"review_id": "JzPvSQg2fLve-Ti5XCy2_Q", "user_id": "BIWnH3yjzrcdgw5ADX9nvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Updated review.. by far my fave Asian restaurant.

It's a great place to get your Vietnamese food. Craving some pho? This is the place to go!\"Pho Chau\": Comes with everything you could ask for sliced beef, brisket, flank, soft tendon, tripe, and meatballs. The pho noodles are cooked to the right consistency not too soft and not too hard. Staff cooked the bean sprouts and gave me mint leaves, jalapeño peppers, and limes. The portion size is huge! Don't be deceived by what seems like a HUGE bowl with lots of soup but no content. The bowl is literally \"xe lua\" in Vietnamese or \"train size\" in English. I came in quite hungry and this was more than enough- in hindsight, I probably should have just eaten half... Durian Smoothie with boba: I'm pleasantly surprised they had BOBA! The durian smoothie was really good! It wasn't too sweet and definitely had the durian taste that I was craving. They say its real durian too- can't complain about that! Boba wasn't the best though- it wasn't sweet like at other locations, but its also probably one of the only locations to get boba in Rochester so I can't complain."}, {"review_id": "l4qAkOHxuyESyc6jZCFKTg", "user_id": "F869keAIp2wSp75mtjv5kA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "Let's get this out of the way: I am a full blooded Vietnamese. I don't usually becomes surprise with anything when it comes to Vietnamese dishes... Until today.I took my mother to this restaurant while we were watching one of my kids at a swim meet in Rochester, MN.  My mom asked me if I ever had 'Bo La Lop' under the appetizer section... I told my mother that I never had it (actually, I wasn't sure because I had Bo La Lot which was VERY long time ago ~ almost 20 years ago in Montreal, ON)... My mom told me that it is very rare dish in Vietnamese restaurants because it requires special leaves to make it. Traditionally, it should be betel or grape leaves.  For this restaurant, they say it is Hawaiian leaves... Whatever it is, it is amazing! Personally, I think it is the best spring roll from the Vietnamese culture period. I know what you are thinking... This 'fat' Asian who writes buffet reviews and practically eats everything thinks this is the best spring roll ever?! Yes, yes, I do ~ mainly because I rarely see it.Hence, if you are ever in the area, stop here and try it! Yes, Majority of their food is very good... This La Lop dish is must try because you rarely see it on most Vietnamese menus! Note: beside the appetizer, they also have this in a noodle salad as well: Bun Bo Nuong La Lop... I believe it is under number 42 on the menu. Highest recommendation on this dish as well! Love, love from this fat Asian!"}, {"review_id": "nwD3OuPD9AYHnYLdZfZIHA", "user_id": "qaIibhk3e5pvEz7AwYdNuQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "I have been here few times, food is good, the owner is very nice, she makes her face like she knows me well, i know see dont remember me, but nice try, bottom line i had a good food.

The soup doesn't really taste like it was a bone marrow soup. It was more of a packaged herbal mix. It's a but sweeter than I would have liked. I also ordered the pork stick appetizer, and it's pretty good! You can tell by the charing on the stick that it was actually barbecued rather than fried. The food here is also amazingly cheap! However, I saw that people kept saying that there were giant portion sizes, but I disagree. The bowl is made to be a lot shorter and wider to have the appearance of there being more food. And since I ordered the combination Pho, I wad expecting more meat, but they literally only give you 2 pieces of each, and it's mostly the soup. On the bright side, the noodles were about the average amount, but they were more tender than the average (which I liked). I can't say much about service. I was sitting alone, so it did take double the time for them to get to my order, but the food came out fast. Overall not the best, but it's a solid Pho place. I'd give it a 3.3."}, {"review_id": "qudl7ebuiEKwb4fAZM2QIg", "user_id": "lAdqlKTsDq9JRSMLNlvEMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "This is one of my favorite places at which to eat in Rochester.

I ordered Goi Cuon for starters which was tasteless- it is basically some cold noodles and shrimp wrapped around a lettuce served with a sweet sauce. You can get this from any asian store. Then I ordered Lo mein with Shrimp, Squid and chicken - which was also unsavory  - as it was just a bunch of stuff fried together without any particular flavor to it. The staff was nice and the place was very crowded. Take home message - the prices are very cheap but the food is bland.

Last time we were in Rochester (a couple weeks ago) this place was closed for summer vacation, so we ended up eating somewhere else. Happy to see they were open when we stopped today.We ordered tofu spring rolls, which were very good, but I wasn't quite sure what was in the accompanying peanut sauce - it tasted like there was something picked in there, maybe daikon? Carrots? Not sure, but I like my peanut sauce without too much extra stuff.The SO and I had stir fry dishes; his was tofu, mine shrimp. The portions were quite large and I couldn't finish all of mine. The reason I'm not giving this place four stars is because there was way too much \"filler\" vegetable in my dish - i.e. mostly broccoli. I like broccoli but I like other veggies too, and I automatically associate too much broccoli with cheaping out on a stir fry. I kind of wished I would've stuck with my original order place, a rice noodle stir fry.The service here was absolutely great. We got here as soon as they opened and were served promptly - the restaurant started filling up very quickly and there were lots of to-go orders going out too. I wish we could do half-star reviews on Yelp. I would've given this 3.5 stars easily, and I'll probably stop back here next time I'm down this way to check out some of the other dishes on the menu."}, {"review_id": "E_2lnqNomPxiYnlku_7JTA", "user_id": "Ca0c3rYntB3Ew9RFGTBKEA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "This spot did not hit the spot.
