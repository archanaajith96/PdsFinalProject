It's a neat little spot with a few high top tables, some comfy low tops and no green siren women.I had a simple latte with hazelnut. It was hot, the foam was seriously solid (I needed a spoon!) and the coffee was excellent. A really terrific wake-me-up!Great spot. A few folks were there with their dogs, too!"}, {"review_id": "eZxcAaGuBA4MQ7QCohHWew", "user_id": "EraSY3GE2GgoymRBcbIvqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Definitely a great place to get your caffeine fix. My wife and I found it easy to find parking and was a short walk from everything in town. Really good coffee drinks and espresso. We also liked how calm it was.

I went to Phoenix books across the street but it was closed. Walked across and saw here - decided to try it. Walked in and was amazed. This place is adorable. Lots of seating! It's in a historical building so I had great wood paneling and hardwoood floors. Staff are very friendly. As someone passing through from the Midwest, folks tend to talk about how WY does t have anything. Well, they are wrong! This place would fit in with any big city!"}, {"review_id": "i0UScGotlAOEZTRv7npaGA", "user_id": "fiKXfocs2fZu2LeEBL_Z8A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/16/2017", "text": "My favorite coffee shop in Cheyenne.  Why? Well for starters they play kick-ass music every morning. Two: They make great coffee drinks and good lattes. That's sort of crucial. Three: the staff is pretty awesome. They have a habit of remembering your name and drink and put alot of effort into making good beverages. Four: Paramount has an uber-simple yet effective rewards program that  doesn't require me to have a card, download an app or any of that nonsense. Finally they have bubble tea, which while I'm usually not a huge fan of, it is actually quite good especially in hot days.  I recommend the honeydew. They do an open mic night on Fridays but I still haven't had the chance to attend this yet. I most assuredly will soon, however as I'm sure it's good."}, {"review_id": "uXWbZ2Lh23_S5GHS9Ws0NQ", "user_id": "LII44iWLl-NdvMWi8ISUAw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "This place will always be my favorite to buy Bubble Tea, I love how they give me lots of tapioca balls those are my ultimate favorite. Don't get me wrong they have flavored balls too I tried one of them and it was really good. Go here if you are craving bubble tea I always find them where ever I am! Sadly, they don't have a Paramount Cafe here where I live but at least they have a place called Happy Teriyaki and it's amazing they had Raspberry bubble tea sooo delicious!!!"}, {"review_id": "gDSoP6wu4vy3mb9N7-CcPA", "user_id": "EB5wgi1uacplsNb7h9YZhg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "This is my go to for coffee in Cheyenne.

Somewhat disordered, yet friendly service. This is a cool space. In an old Paramount theater, this coffee shop totally has that desirable vibe. We came in on a road trip west. You need coffee on road trips you know and this place caught my glance as I looked ahead at Cheyenne. When we arrived the place seemed quite busy. Most of the tables on the main level were full and there was a line almost to the door. We felt more comfortable when we saw the counter was only back about 20 feet in a small alcove. There were only 6 to 8 people ahead of us. We happily chatted while looking over the menu and perusing the case of pre made food items. They had all from breads to burritos to yogurts. Several minutes had passed by this point and I had anticipated we would be almost up ordering. Sadly, it took us close to 20 minutes to even get up to the counter to order. No real evidence why this process was so slow. When we got up to order we quickly asked for all we wanted. There were two baristas working and a woman at the register. The baristas barely had any room and kept having to swap with each other to get to the espresso machine. During our ordering process, I noticed that the whole flow was not super coherent. The woman at the register had to ask several questions with us while putting in our order and the baristas started drinks while this was happening but in strange order. The food was all left to the end. The drip coffee was taken care of by the register woman. All fairly normal steps, but here they seemed haphazard. The cost of which was a very long time to finish it all. No wonder the line was slow. The drinks were very tasty. I had the Casa Bonita (a honey and cinnamon latte) with almond milk. Very good. I also had the vegetarian breakfast burrito which was a blast of yummy flavor! The burrito was also quite large and had potatoes, eggs, green chile. I would definitely go back for this. All in all our experience was good and the drinks and food were worth it. The wait was very odd though and a little unfortunate as we wanted to be on our way. Perhaps it was still the morning rush on Friday."}, {"review_id": "IyLXPtNxTgPqS79f0ref8g", "user_id": "aU0CevC2cazlL0FiBiSxQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2017", "text": "They keep changing their coffee menu for the better.
