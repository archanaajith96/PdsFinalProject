My mouth is watering already!!!!One thing I was a bit surprised to find was a living wage fee that smuggled aboard my bill. These kinds of quietly tacked on fees to me are done in poor taste. I'm not a restaurant owner so I can only speak for myself here but I would hope servers are being properly compensated and taken care of for their work. That fee makes it sound like they're not being compensated appropriately.  Regardless I do hope its genuinely going towards benefits for servers and staff.Rant done!Also, as luck would have it, I have yet to pay this place a visit during peak hours so no horror stories there.

The food was delicious and the service was great.I came by at 3 pm on a Saturday. It feels really nice that have people from all sorts of different backgrounds enjoy wonderful food.The crowd is very diverse. There was an Asian family dining next to us, a gay couple enjoying their fancy wine in front of us, a Mexican family celebrating a birthday and then there was us, my Jamaican husband and his Chicana wife and our mixed daughter. I enjoyed the ambiance. People enjoying the presence of each other with great food and drinks.The restaurant is so LA. To give you an example.. they have a doggy menu but they don't have a kids menu. People with dogs can dine in the patio with their dogs.  Don't worry they are still very friendly towards children. The server gave my daughter a balloon within the first 5 minutes of sitting down.  The main menu list a few kids options.I had the slides on a bed of greens and it was good but my favorite was the FLOURless chocolate cake. I have been trying to eat gluten-free since February and desserts are usually not an option for me. The dessert was A-M-A-zing. They served it with Ice cream on top. It was delicious. I was worried the coffee would be watered down like at an IHOP but I was pleasantly surprised. The drip coffee was dark, strong and absolutely rich. I loved my cake and coffee.My husband had the bread pudding. He is still talking about it today. He really loved it.  The service staff was very friendly and attentive. My husband enjoys beer so I picked this place out for him. He said the beer is great. I really loved this restaurant. I hope to be back soon."}, {"review_id": "YE6qx8YZvkMyDqd1Ie_stw", "user_id": "b73qtAJ8kWdB7HIsTN0P5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "If you drive by this place, they are very boastful. So boastful in a way that it makes you doubt their claims that they are in the top 100 restaurants and that their bread pudding is probably frozen Trader Joes. Well...Um..I'm sorry for doubting you. *bows down* The Morrison is truly worthy of all the praise they receive. First of all, I am a french fry fiend. I love fries. These fries are wickedly crisp while being soft on the inside. I might come here just to get a box of fries next time.Their late breakfast burger was pretty delicious as well, although I was missing some sort of a sauce to go on it. The monster mac burger is truly a MONSTER but the flavors all go really well together.The cherry on top of this calorie dense meal is the bread pudding. MY GOD nothing is more satisfying.

It was so early at the restaurant and everyone was sitting at the bar when I walked in.  My husband was on a call outside but I needed to use the ladies room.  I thought I might get told no because I was basically walking in and not necessarily a \"customer\" yet.  She didn't make a fuss.  When I came out my husband was there and she sat us at a booth without having to ask.  That made me happy.  He and I had traveled all day.  We drove down from Irvine and came straight to the restaurant.  I truly had no desire to sit at a bar stool.  The comfy and roomy booth helped us to hang out for much longer than we would have.  Robbie was our server.  He's equally as friendly and accommodating.  We all hit it off.  He a personable and professional server.  He's only worked at The Morrison for two weeks.  He knew all about the menu and seemed like he'd been there for years.  I'd come back just because I like Robbie (the receipt said Robert btw).  We ate wings (requested well done and they were perfect), onion rings (Robbie joked that they were not Krispy Creme Donuts, but they looked like them), a chili dog, beef sliders, pretzels (I really liked the pretzels), bread pudding with vanilla bean ice cream, Moscow Mules, Mojito and I believe a Sweet Caroline or something like that.  Everything tasted delicious.  We were crazy hungry having not eaten since breakfast at the hotel.  The crazy thing about this is that we used to live in Glendale and my husband always wanted to try the restaurant.  For some reason I only saw pics or reviews on Scottish Eggs and burgers with runny eggs.  These just aren't my thing nor his.  I couldn't figure out why he wanted to eat here. As you can see from the list of foods that we ordered, they do not specialize in Scottish or runny eggs exclusively.  I'm so bummed that we hadn't enjoyed the restaurant before.  Insert sad face here.  If we get the chance before we return to Nevada we'd like to come in and try more food and hang out for a few hours.  The entire staff were efficient and friendly.  I didn't notice any attitudes.  I asked the  cute girl with ponytail buns to bring me some real sugar.  She didn't mind.  She was the coolness starter of the bunch.  Haha.  Inside joke.  I love this place. Thanks Robbie and hostess with the mostest.  See you next time."}, {"review_id": "YNby1DWZsH7VlobLvwPLeA", "user_id": "F5_bK3m2YiA7NLCLEsSeXg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "I've been here several times: on a weekend, on a weekday, at night and for happy hour.

They make good drinks that pack a punch and are worth the money. Try the Bee's Butt!Ambiance is welcoming and the decor definitely stands out! You'll feel festive as soon as you walk in.Con:The ONLY thing I could think of is parking. The lot is small and the place is popular so you may have some issues finding a spot during peak hours.

I need a drink. I need good food. I need a good time. This place is apparently the place to be! First, shout out to my server, Maria, who was awesome! Gave great recommendations and didn't make me feel awkward because I sat alone waiting for my friend. LOL. Started off with an Old Fashioned (takes the edge off, you know). It was prepared nicely, perfect amount of ice and tasted as it should. After my friend arrived, we ordered our food. I ordered the bacon burger and my friend ordered the breakfast burger. The menu has recommended beers listed with each burger, perfect for you indecisive folk. And no, it's not included in the price of the burger! Neither are side dishes. The Bacon Bourbonator Burger was topped with thick cut bacon - yasssss, onion jam, and blue cheese. Bacon was delicious, crispy and flavorful. The medium rare patty I got was cooked to perfection. If you don't get a little beef juice running down your arm, they didn't do it right! This place nailed it! I'd definitely give this a go again when I come back. My friend ordered the breakfast burger. This gem had bacon, onion jam, and a cheddar pancake. Yes. You read that right. A cheddar pancake, or pancake with cheddar cheese infused in it! This burger is also worth trying! Flavors aren't as sharp as the burger I ordered, but it was still good. We shared some onion rings that were okay. A little soggy and kind of too greasy for my taste. I prefer crunchier. The menu also advertises their bourbon bread pudding as the best in LA! Maria told us it's super delicious and we had to try it. I'm glad we did! But, is it the best in LA? I would say it's close to my personal favorite from Masa in Echo Park (drooling as I type this out). This one came out piping hot with a side of a nice caramel sauce. Don't get me wrong, it's delicious. But to me it was a little too wet and runny at the bottom! However, the crispy top was a nice touch. We added ice cream too, vanilla of course. Overall, great restaurant! Loved our server, loved the pub ambiance, and food / drinks are yummy. Quick Tips: 1. Parking lot in the back and side. Kinda awkward to get out of.2. Bathroom was super slippery, so be careful! I almost slipped twice.

By the time the show started, the pub was packed, alive and jumping.  It was a tad loud for conversation but it was expected.The pub itself is located in the trendy area of Atwater on Los Felis Boulevard.  There is a small parking lot, metered street parking, and parking on the residential streets (if you are willing to take a short walk).  The interior is rich dark wood and dimly lit with booth, bar, table and bar table seating. On this date, the dining room was decorated for the Oscar showing and St. Patty's Day.  The small, enclosed, sidewalk patio is pet friendly.  The vibe is relaxed, fun, and loud (had to mention that again).The menu contained a long list of alcoholic beverages and great selection of food, mainly burgers.  There was even two types vegetarian burgers!Our table ordered a Chicken Cobb salad, 2 LA Veggie burgers, and 3 Classic Burgers to our specifications.  Everything came out in a timely manner and was tasty, plated well, and of good portion.  Special kudos on the  LA Veggie burgers which were very unique and super tasty. Best of all was the outstanding service which did not at all seem affected by the crowd.  Our male waiter even got our detailed order right without writing it down or taking notes... Impressive! Consistently great all around ... a solid 5 stars for a pub w great burgers!"}, {"review_id": "QoS5rEd88oQugDY_hW6vaQ", "user_id": "yBW8YsfCCj6SlIbGke0gPg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Fish and Chips.Though  i would not usually review a restaurant so soon after my last review, i found it necessary to do so after i realized that the Mo had revived its interpretation of Fish and Chips: a Serious food item, at least to me, if there ever was one.  Outside of England where Fish and Chips is a National dish, i have been hard pressed to find a good F&C in LA.Though this item sounds simple there are a lot of ways in which the preparation can go wrong.Fortunately, the Mo has got this item right, The Cod is tasty and well cooked, the breading crispy and well fried though some pieces had too much breading (batter).  Once i pointed this out, the Kitchen sent out a revised version with less of a percentage of breading to Cod which made it just right. Most diners would not send food back. But i have no qualms about this and the Morrison responded correctly.Choosing the right fish for this item is the first step and Cod or Haddock is pretty much right on as a fish for this product. Also how the fish is seasoned, fried and breaded is paramount in getting this product right.The side sauces here were tasty with both the Tartar and Malt Vinegar right on point. I also liked that there was the Mo's famous pickled onions and cucumber on the plate to give this plate  an added acidity.As usual the Mo's fries (chips) were crispy, tasty and perfectly fried though i would have liked to see the more English style of Steak fries as an accompaniment.As a non-food or service accompaniment sidelight Miss Lynette Romero and Chris Burrous were in house to shoot a segment for our local channel 5. I had a chance to chat with both of them plus their camera dude and all three were charming, nice, cool, down-to-earth people."}, {"review_id": "HCWNBQiHtR5b5YzuTwPuyw", "user_id": "d8KR5c1ievS0C53h4fhEeQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "Morrison is awesome pub grub spot. Small parking lot, can fit around 15 cars. Meters are active until 8 pm.Small restaurant, hard to fit big parties. Huge bar area with a good amount of bar stool self seating. Very busy on weekends during happy hour. Service is great and good comes out quick even when busy.Happy hour is awesome, 3-7pm EVERYDAY!!! They do not take reservations during these hours. Mix drinks are a very good deal. The food is cheap and tastes amazing.Beer is only a dollar off the menu price for HH. All the beer on tap is pints only. Old Fashion - $6 HH - Well made, tasty, and smooth. I got less sugar so it would not be overly sweet and it was perfect.Morrison Mule - $6 HH - Great version of the moscow. A bit sweet for my taste. I love the copper cups.Mac & Cheese - $6 HH - Huge portion, we shared 1 with 8 people. Well made and noodles were not over cooked. Very cheesy.Hot Wings - $6 HH - No heat. Chicken was juicy. Portion was only 5 wings so it was pretty expensive for even hh prices.Pretzel - $6 HH - You get 2 huge pretzels. I loved the chewiness. Comes with 3 dips, but I prefer the mustard. Sliders - $6 HH - You get 2 Hawaiian bun sliders. Meat was cooked to your liking. Comes with lettuce, tomato, and cheese. Very simple basic slider. Nachos w/ Chicken - $6 + $3 HH - The best of all the dishes I had. Well made nachos, ton of toppings and cheese. Not overly packed with beans. Comes with guac. Adding chicken is a must because the normal nachos portion is a lot smaller. Fried Brussels - $7 - Sweet and salty glaze. Fried tender and not overly oily. Very addicting to eat. Bread Pudding w/ Jameson Ice Cream - $11 + $2 - Brioche bread was perfectly soft and pillowy. It was sweet but not to over the top. Jameson Ice Cream was creamy but I could not taste the whiskey. One of the best bread puddings I have had. Pretty expensive for the portion size you get though. The caramel sauce is super duper hurt your teeth sweet.I really enjoyed all the food I had. Gave them only a 4 because I thought it was annoying they charge a living wage charge.

I am all for paying a living wage but you, the restaurant owner, obviously are not!

I came here to have one of Morrison's famous burgers and enjoy the Patriot's game. Pay your workers a living wage but don't force me to be involved in your personnel issues. After all $15 (before tax and Living Wage SC), is not cheap for a burger nor is $6-9 for fries. If you are going to include such a surcharge you need to make sure your customer's know before they sit down.The service was great and the burger was even better!
