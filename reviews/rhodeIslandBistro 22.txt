Quiet in the afternoon, and that is just how I like it. I like the peace of the middle of the afternoon. And it gives a place the chance to show you just how good they really are; everyone can perform when it's busy and demanding. It takes the slow times to perfect what you do in this  business. The grilled atlantic salmon with chilled farro salad, asparagus and pomengrante reduction was a filling yet light enough afternoon entree. Will definitely be in for dinner soon."}, {"review_id": "pzbKTLDHEMNScTjN92nf9A", "user_id": "i9n5Gic1Ub1-IBxAaWkvkQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "I had high hopes based on the reviews. We arrived at 2:00pm on a Saturday afternoon.  It was very crowded but that was expected because it was a sunny day and everyone was out to enjoy it. We were seated for about 10 minutes and another waitress brought us water. Another 10 minutes and our waiter came over asking about drinks.  Another 10 minutes before we submitted our order.  It took well over 20 minutes for the food to come out.  So almost an hour wait to eat.  Not good.  It was then that I realized that for some idotic reason, all 3 of the waitstaff worked tables inside AND outside.  There was also no one to bus the tables but the waiters so that is why it took so long to get to ordering. It makes no sense to have your waiters running all around, inside and out, to take care of tables. Not exactly the best use of your staff and it must exahust them by the end of the day!I am not sure what I was expecting but the food was just kind of there.  Nothing outstanding or special.  My meal didn't have much taste so I added malt vinegar that was on the table to give it a boost.  The orzo salad wasn't that great either.  Portion size is on the smaller size.  As a matter of fact, once we arrived home we were still hungry so I went out and got pizza for everyone.  I also noticed that one of the waitresses working outside had stopped to pet a dog.  The dog was the kind that has a lot of drool.  She then stood up from petting the dog to grab glasses and silverware off the stand and bring it to a table without washing her hands.  That is not acceptable. Some people are allergic to dogs.  You have no idea who you are serving so while I am sure she loves dogs, you don't pet them while working!!!  Second thing I saw the waitress do (same one who pet the dog and still no idea if she washed her hands) was bring out a long stack of glasses.  Instead of holding the glasses by the bottom end, she had the lip (open end) resting on the palm of her hand.  She proceeded to put the stack on the stand and bring two out to a table.  Again, letting the end you drink out of rest on the palm of her hand.  I am not a germaphobe by any stretch but that really grossed me out.  The waitstaff was working hard.  Clearly there needs to be something done to streamline the process and make run smoothly. The distribution of work wasn't efficient or effective.  They also probably didn't make as much as they should in tips because the entire process of getting food to the table took way to long.  If you are going to make your customers wait that long for food, at least make sure it is worth the wait.  All in all, I wish I had decided to take my out-of-town family to another restaurant.  Hopefully, the manager/owner will work out a better solution but as for me and the family, we won't be coming back."}, {"review_id": "IaapBnAoNOmkMR__M9ioPQ", "user_id": "5Ih7YcRrIk1T-Od7P5S9Fw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon around 4:30 with two other people. We were seated promptly and our waiter, Thomas, was right there to get us started. Upon inquiring about whether the salmon burger was made in house, Thomas informed us that most everything is made fresh in house (exceptions being the ice cream and something else); those exceptions were sourced locally though!For drinks, one person got a glass of white wine, the other a cocktail, and I a beer. Some bread was brought out, it was fresh and warm and the butter was very tasty.  Thomas noted that my friends swapped drinks and inquired if someone wasn't pleased with their drink. My friend hesitantly admitted she wasn't a fan of her cocktail. Thomas apologized and offered a replacement drink. My friend opted for wine and when she described what she wanted, Thomas was able to describe a few wines and narrowed it down to one wine for her. She was pleased. For dinner, I got the smoked salmon grilled cheese. It was not what I expected, but it was still god. I was expecting slices of smoked salmon, but when it came out, it had the consistency of a fine tuna fish almost. The bread it was served on was quite tasty, as were the fries. My friends got a pizza and grilled chicken sandwich, both were pleased.For dessert, we split a bread pudding which was very good. They have a limoncello flight that I really wanted to try. The food and the service made this random stop a great find. We definitely plan on returning, especially for their half priced wine bottles on Monday!"}, {"review_id": "GoqDpLCivOryLxsTAvwyuQ", "user_id": "MUwqO0xhkN6mdGVLwQJ-3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I have to add another review after today's lunch.

I'd say that this is more of a business-casual lunch spot or a nice place for a date night. Nonetheless I tucked in and was happy to eat!The facts:-Their tomato bisque soup is absolutely out of this world. I can't even handle it. I wish I'd gotten a whole bowl.-The spinach and strawberry salad is also very good. The spinach was a tad soggy, but spinach is tricky that way.-Service was prompt.-I'd say that their prices are a smidge too high for a lunch outing. The Tomato Bisque is definitely worth it, but again I'd recommend coming for dinner.Too bad I won't be in the area much longer... I'm already thinking of the next time I'll be sippin' that soup."}, {"review_id": "2qiWzma1VtFR97QWGx-yWQ", "user_id": "pyNJdf0pWGBL-UZbrJMWmg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "Excellent service and even better food.

But, find yourself in Jerry's section and prepare for your dining experience to elevate to a new and magnificent level with his pristine sense of humor and charm. Find yourself in Jerry's section and depart having enjoyed delectable food whilst in the presence of a national treasure [who should have his own afternoon talk show].

It's conveniently located within the Garden City shopping center and is easily accessible. The atmosphere was so cute- the decor was charming and it's smallness made it cozy! We enjoyed some drinks, a meat, fruit and cheese board and entrees. The bolognese as well as the chicken were delicious. Be advised that due to the small size, there may be a wait during peak hours, but there is a bar as well as an outdoor seating area for warmer months which add to the accommodations."}, {"review_id": "4K_V7OvinM8VukHkamTs6g", "user_id": "ggO6C5zJl4x_929oYy0dfA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/29/2017", "text": "Can't help but love this place!

Bistro 22 is a cute little restaurant  located in Garden City (RI) with both indoor and outdoor seating. The staff was very friendly, the food was excellent and prices are fair. I had a hamburger with bacon, cheddar cheese and caramelized onions. My mom had chicken with buffalo mozzarella and some other good stuff. My hamburger was cooked as requested and the salad that they let me sub for the fries was a tasty with a mixture of greens. Mom loved the flavor of her chicken and the presentation of it.The only minor negatives were that when I asked for my burger to be cooked au poivre our server brought some some (flavorful) au poivre sauce but later there was a $2 surcharge on the check. Also while friendly, service was a bit inattentive. We had to ask for a bread basket and when my mom began choking on a small piece of chicken (she's fine thanks), no one seemed to notice and the restaurant at that time was only 1/2 filled.  But overall it is a nice restaurant and our meal was delicious."}, {"review_id": "-cckUiKsJlM5MvmDpJQg8g", "user_id": "rpXsYQGYyz5bFpTkUpH5YQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "This was our first time here.

The meat is a little iffy, sometimes tastes like it was microwaved, however for a quick & quaint lunch spot it's great. Great service, actually sat at the bar a few seats down from the owner. Bartender let us taste a few wines before deciding. Had the chicken tacos which were quite good. Girlfriend had a salad with blackened shrimp, which were steep at $3/per and just slightly above average shrimp. All in all good little spot in Garden City."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/bistro-22-cranston?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
