I knew we had to go, it was a must try situation My husband got the rice bowl with pork and devoured it and I HAD to try the famous kimchi fries in honor of our love of the Korean culture. Last year when we were in Seoul walking through a locals food street market we had to purchase kimchi and it was the very best we've ever had, this kimchi was a close second. It was sour, spicy and made my tongue tingle in a way that only amazing kimchi can do. I'm salivating just thinking about those kimchi fries. I added the candied bacon to mine so I'd have a tiny bit of sweet to offset the spicy. Kyle, the manager took me on a short tour of the restaurant and told me they handmade the kimchi on location and don't pull it until it has fermented for at least 3 weeks. They also sell it by the pound for about $10 in case you want to take some"}, {"review_id": "ZOJrvfR-hWjbgA3i4TaFUA", "user_id": "87LDG00TzYDmyndnRY-IJQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "In a land of horrible restaurants by the TU campus, this place shines like a beacon to hungry sailors after months at sea trapping water-squirrels. Everything is good. I generally go Thursdays to get the banh-mi burger. Tip: Adding an easy-egg to the burger makes all the difference. Forget the cheese, get the egg! Things to watch out for:1. This isn't fast-food. If there's a big lunch crowd, then you may have to wait awhile on your food. Get there early or after lunch to avoid the wait.2. Inside seating is limited.3. For some reason, they keep a wall-mounted fan blasted to 11. If the weather is cold, you will be cold inside. It's so strong it blows your napkins around inside the small dining room.  There's an emphatic sign that says \"don't unplug\" but I've seen more than one person unplug it just to get through their meal."}, {"review_id": "DYUjLO1sVP3Xgd6zlwR_JQ", "user_id": "wGQ04PPsSCWb_Tlap5PT8w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "I was in Tulsa for work and stayed with my friend who lives so close to this place. We ordered our food to go because we wanted to hurry up and get into our comfy pants after both having a long day and an early morning ahead of us. You walk in and order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. The dining area is a bit small but there are tables along the front counter as well. We ordered the kimchi fries, pork rice bowl, and fried chicken Banh mi. The kimchi fries had the perfect amount of bite and spice to them and were enough to share with 4 friends. The fried chicken Banh mi was delicious. The chicken was hot (temperature) and crispy and the sauce on the Banh mi was creamy and a bit spicy. The star of the show, however, was the pulled pork rice bowl. It had a spicy sauce and the pork was tender and not too salty. The fried rice was crunchy and perfectly paired with the cilantro and pickled veggies. I will definitely return the next time I'm in the area visiting my friend or for work."}, {"review_id": "D8aGyPBqqxLcEuR51-IX8A", "user_id": "9KNOZd1z5hUlDiBI5Xv3Gg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Soo sooooo good.

That's how perfect it was.  My husband let me sample the ginger fritter on his banh mi (he rated the sandwich five stars with ease), and it was great too.  Best of all, we split the kimchi fries and found them absolutely delicious!  I opted for an \"easy egg\" on top and that was a great decision...it was sort of like a simple bibimbap with french fries instead of rice.  I would love to try just about everything on the menu here, honestly.  The atmosphere is authentic & upbeat, non-chain Chipotle, rather than \"too hip for you/Portlandia episode\" which was my initial expectation.  I have a feeling it's going to be a must-stop when in Tulsa."}, {"review_id": "hYgJ4taa5M09psxU87Xu3A", "user_id": "mzLM08IyZKOhJMFiUBg2Bg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/28/2017", "text": "Lone Wolf brings exquisite cuisine.

I'm taking this opportunity to plead that you consider expanding your fantasmagorical restaurant to Oklahoma City. If you do so, I will sing your praises to anyone who will listen. I'll retweet everything you share.I'll Instagram your food.I'll Snapchat about it to friends.I'll start a subreddit on your behalf.I'll Yelp you. I'll Yelp you real good. I mean... I dunno if any business plan hinging on the whims of one person is particularly smart, but...  It is me we're talking about. You like me, right? I mean, I love you guys, so I'm assuming the feelings are mutual. Granted, I've only interacted with you for all of like, five minutes. But in those five minutes, I figured out that you care about your customers, and there's a passion in your food. Passion, I say! And I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't be the only one thrilled to have you closer. Don't say no! Just... consider it, is all I'm sayin'. Bring this magic to OKC. If you do, I shall name my second child after you[1], and his (or her) name shall be Lone Wolf Danger M.Oh right, the food. So good, you guys/gals. So very good. I'll be honest and admit that I was kinda like, \"White people making Asian fusion food? Mmmm... I guess...\" Firstly, sincerest apologies for my presumptuous attitude. Secondly, yes to white people making such fantastic Asian fusion food. You can do anything you set your minds to, white people! Except slavery. That one's off-limits now.The Pao + Roasted Jalapeño Aioli = Stuff of Dreams. It's the best $8.50 you will spend. Actually, I think it was less than that because I used my KeepItLocalOK card. Every aspect of the dish was deliberate and flavorful. The rice, the slaw, the bean sprouts, the pork. And that aioli. My goodness... That amazing aioli...The Kimchi Fries are also fantastic. And unlimited Stubborn Sodas? Really? You're too good to me, Lone Wolf. I kinda went overboard and tried each of the flavors, so that was borderline diabetes-inducing, but the Pineapple Cream is noice. Mmmmm, carbonated sugar.[1]Disclaimer: Pursuant to approval from the wife[2].[2]Note: The wife said no. I'm sorry, Lone Wolf. You should still come to OKC though."}, {"review_id": "NLMn0ka_UJPQnr1UIo7jwg", "user_id": "ARtIt8mfeCL-TJwhIXQbEA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "We discovered Lone Wolf three days ago...and now have gone three days consecutive while visiting from out of town.

What's more, their portobello mushrooms & fritters (housemade falafel) are great for vegetarians. Last, they're open until 11p on Fri/Sat, and were very accommodating at 10:30p when we first visited.

The pesto meatballs have a bit of a kick to them- that would be the jalapeno- and the lemongrass buttermilk fried chicken pieces are boneless bites of yum!I recently tried the Ginger Fritters - how about giant fried balls of ginger infused dough! these were super yummy - i added an order on top of my pesto meatballs for my rice bowl.Oh, go on Thursdays for their burger nights!!or try their Chicken on Brioche sandwich - reminds me of a fancy Chick Fil A sandwich.

I'd say that it's Asian fusion street food done right. Being Vietnamese, at first I had a hard time enjoying Lone Wolf's quirky banh mi adaptations, but once I accepted that this ain't your grandma's banh mi, I was able to truly savor their food. I like the kung pao pork banh mi and of course, their kimchi fries. I'm typically all about sauces, but their sweet chili calamari banh mi was so incredibly saucy that it turned mushy although I did appreciate the heat factor. Their fried rice bowls are also a solid choice.

We were in Tulsa for the day and decided to venture out to Lone Wolf because of my love of all things Asian fusion. The succulent flavor of the lemongrass buttermilk fried chicken, the punch of that jalapeno aioli and the perfectly marinated pork? I couldn't ask for more. We went in deciding to share the kimchi fries because we were pretty full from our earlier meal. However, shortly after we dug into the fries, we turned to each other and sheepishly asked 'hey soo umm, did you want to try the fried rice?'We ended up getting The Pao with the roasted jalapeno aioli and the Kimchi fries with lemongrass buttermilk fried chicken, along with a couple of Stubborn Sodas. Both of the dishes were filling, spicy, flavorful, and despite a cranky 3 month old, our experience was delightful. I took off a star because the fries were a bit overdone; fried to the point that they scraped the roof of my mouth.. repeatedly.

The kimchi fries are absolutely amazing! I could seriously probably eat these daily. Their fried rice bowls are fantastic as well (ask my picky 15 year old son). I personally go classic and love their Kung Pao Pork Banh Mi. It is a perfect blend of sweet and spicy with a touch of citrus. I must add that the staff is legit. When my son was sick one day, we stopped by because they were teaming up with Strange Donuts (supposedly will open in Tulsa soon), and everyone was so talkative and inviting.

First off let me say, I heard this spot began as a food truck but ive only been to their brick and mortar, that being said I believe you can still catch these guys around town mobile, yet stationary ;)Me and my friend came here to check it out and we were definitely impressed. We tried to sample some patron favorites and branched out a little as well. We got The Pao Fried rice Pork Bowl, Kung Pao Pork Banh Mi baguette and an order of Kimchi Fries! Highly recommend all three. Ok let's get into it. The fried rice bowl was very good, the ingredients were fresh although I will say the \"fried rice\" tasted more from a rice cooker or steamed, regardless still very tasty and probably my favorite! The Kung Pao Pork baguette was awesome, nice flavor and the bun was fresh! Kimchi fries were very good although kinda rich in flavor. I recommend sharing them as it would be a lot for one person. Price point was reasonable and definitely appreciate the variety of meals they have.

I'll never doubt again lolNot just a food truck at this locale any longer! Yep, they finally opened their new location and it's actually pretty sweet. As the photos show it's a cozy little spot with a fair number of seats, and in a prime location. I found the kimchi fries to be amazing. Plenty of effort on display here with this dish. Some heat and sour coming from the kimchi, creamy aioli, and crisp fries. All with a great cilantro back. Love it! Nothing like it that I've seen yet. However, the rice and chicken sandwich are just good. Not great. I've never been a fan of over-hyped food, and to a degree, this is that. Would I return? Absolutely.
