He had one of the crabragoon pizzas with him. He was going to make sure I had this special pizza. We ate it while in the car.It was good and not so different that I wanted to chase it down with water.It became clear to me that this place has won the hearts of the college kids. Their cult-like following wad not at all lost on me. (Perhaps they put crack in this pizza). If I understand the story correctly,  a Chinese restaurant burnt down.  Someone else opened a pizza joint there and called it Fong's Pizza. Apparently, they wanted to keep the tradition of the Chinese restaurant alive. Today, I am back in \"DES\" Moines (for the Young Entrepreneur Convention) and I had to treat my entire family to their crack. It is still good. Might be addicted now."}, {"review_id": "yOlXHn_HRabG-FTIaIM-7g", "user_id": "tG9yJTtaKBlNx7lgysfmwQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "First time here wait time was told 25 min which it was only about 20 min so that was a plus. Ordered drinks they have coke products. Ordered meat egg rolls they came about 10 min later. They were different than regular egg rolls they had a fine powdery substance on them but they tasted great. Not sure that they were a wow but  better than a frozen boxed egg roll. Then we waited and waited and waited after 45 min we asked where our 3 small 10in pizzas were at. Our waiter came back to tell us that they have been getting a lot of call in pick up pizzas and they have to do them first because they won't wait. I informed him that we had a 3hr drive yet to make. Another 15 min go by and we see the 3 people seated at the bar after us and they had only been there about 20min get 2 small 10 in pizzas. We also saw our waiter eating in the kitchen right where they box up the to go pizzas. Finally my son asked the waiter if he could see if they have started our pizzas or not cause we were going to just leave and go somewhere else.  The waiter came back and said that our pizzas were in the oven. 10min later the manager came out with them. Said sorry for the wait and that she was taking care of the pizzas for us. Which was nice.Now as for the pizzas we got a sesame chicken it was a wet pizza a bit soggy in the middle,  loose toppings,  thin crust good flavor and it was a unique pizza.Crab Rangoon Pizza this one we were most excited to try but was very disappointed it had not much flavor except for the sweet and spicy sauce and as for the crab Rangoon part it was almost nonexistent. Except the crunchy bits there were a lot of those.Our last Pizza was the  egg rolls Pizza this had more flavor than the meat egg rolls it had a sausage on it which was interesting and a bit spicy. Definitely lots of toppings on it. The hostess was nice and friendly  in fact we even tipped her. She helped move things along for us. Not sure it is worth $5 parking and long wait times. Probably will not be back. We do come to Des Moines a lot and had heard good things about Fongs maybe tonight was just an off night."}, {"review_id": "BfyZkerMQzsPjaZfkOehyQ", "user_id": "OGYP10OzoedXEVCKr8CMrA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Went to Fong's on a Friday night with a party of 2. Had their supposed best seller, crab rangoon, and a few drinks. Upon arrival, no one acknowledged us for 5 minutes. Luckily one of the waitresses noticed us and said someone will be right over. The hostess wasn't accommodating and with a monotonous voice just said, \"here\". Placed the menu in the open table near the entrance. That was the sign that the table she placed the menu on is our seat. She looked really unhappy and she made me feel like it was so much trouble on her part to seat us. She was the same way with the next party after us so I guess she is just not having fun that night. I remember going here a couple of years ago and had good food. But alas, I was disappointed.Customer service - I have had better. Our waitress wasn't the best but she was mediocre. You can tell they were somewhat busy and I think she did the most she can with getting our orders completed for the most part. We each got a couple of drinks and shared a pizza. We were an easy table. We got what we ordered basically. Hostess was very disappointing. She could at least be cordial but hey, maybe she wasn't having a great night. I would rate customer service about 2/5. I have had better experience in a busier, less expensive restaurant.Food - we only got 1 pizza. A 16\" crab rangoon pizza. I would rate the pizza itself 1/5. I would have left the ratings 1/5 if I would only consider the food. The pizza crust came in thin, and tasted like cardboard. I was very disappointed. I could not see any imitation crab and I would have expected more cream cheese on the pizza for flavor. The pizza was topped with sweet chili sauce - which was the only redeeming factor for flavor. Otherwise, the whole dish is no different from chomping your cardboard boxes. I thought  it was horrible. Tip: YOU CANNOT SPLIT PIZZAS. I.e. you cannot order a 16\" pizza and have half crab rangoon and half thai peanut pizza.Drinks - had the kamikaze and a drink special not on their menu - amo de la muerto. Kamikaze was just okay. It tasted more like lemon drop and there was barely any alcohol I could taste. But it only costed $3/shot so if you want to get tipsy with one shot, this is not the drink for you. It was sour and sweet, which tasted pretty good. I'd say 3/5. The specialty drink was pretty good and you get used to it. At first I thought it tasted like cough syrup. After a while, it grows on you and tastes okay. It comes in a cute skull cup. For $8, the drink is big. You cannot taste the alcohol but you will get tipsy. I would get it again. That drink would probably be 4/5 in my opinion.Overall, I was disappointed with my visit at Fong's. Hence, my rating. Customer service and the food was very disappointing. I don't know if I will come back here again anytime soon."}, {"review_id": "aor5vaFF5EyVmNKeyU5TCQ", "user_id": "FYFhZ8i4T0saO0G9FV4wzw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "I was recommended this place by almost all the locals I met while visiting. We sat at the bar and were taken care of by a very friendly and nice bartender. She let us try all the beers on tap while we were deciding what to order and gave us great recommendations as well. We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza, General Tso pizza, and the fongololian beef pizza. All of them were great, our favorite was the General Tso pizza. My only regret was not ordering the Crab Rangoon pizza, because everyone kept raving about it. Next time we're in town we will definitely return and try some more of their unique and tasty pizzas. Also! They offer gluten free options. Didn't try any, but I'm sure they're great since everything else is!!"}, {"review_id": "-nmRDbwV5p5nC2vkPxxm3A", "user_id": "4X-rlsZnCmnGj9YMEI79fA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "5 stars for atmosphere3.5 for food; get the crab rangoons!"}, {"review_id": "ADrlo-jDoHL8No4TgX8GoQ", "user_id": "7CRg3UJqrGLPGvN9-n81RQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Ah, Fong's.

Fong's is one of the places all my friends from Des Moines said I have to try when I visit. It's gimmicky, vintage, tacky, and a little bit hipster -- everything a tiki bar should be. I finally got around to going to Fong's and I'm glad I did. Crab rangoon pizza is great. I don't even know how to describe it, but you just have to try it. The perfect combination of salty, savory, sweet, creamy, and crunchy. We also got a round of mimosas with it because why not, it's a bar too, right?You can also order by the slice which really hit the spot after we had hit up a few bars. It was definitely busier when we came back around bar close, but understandably so. Next time I'm in Des Moines I'll definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "SfFmPvuKUbm7XLan7uMRQA", "user_id": "ma190_o_ekQAbVaUjZuzLw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/17/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Really, really interesting pizzas, like I've never seen before!  Egg roll pizza?

Fong's pizza is a fun idea with it Chinese food twist to pizza. Also Monday- Friday 3-6pm half price apps along with a slice of pizza with every beer you order is a great deal. This place would be great, except the marina sauce tastes like it comes straight from a jar or can. This place would be phenomenal if they would make their own sauce. If they do make there own sauce I apologize and encourage you to change it... this is an opportunity lost situation. With 500 reviews with and average of 4 stars this review may get buried.

Simply put, Chinese food on pizza. Waitstaff was attentive even when slammed on a Friday night. We were a party of 7. We had shots and appetizers and pizzas and a fishbowl. A fishbowl for those not in the know is a large bowl filled with booze and meant as a group drink. Lots of straws, lots of laughter. We had the Thai Stick app. peanut sauce pizza. It was really good. I could have eaten the whole thing. Coconut shrimp and egg rolls, both were good. We also got the daily special which was a deep fried 5 cheese spinach thing. not a winner. Mac and cheese pizza, Crab Rangoon pizza, the Iowian, a meat lovers and a veggie. There was so much food we ended taking some home. A lovely 2 hours spent! OH! We also bought one of the special drinks where you get to keep the tiki glass.

The creativity of blending to different cuisines into one is what made Fong's Pizza a must-try for me. Fong's Pizza blends asian food with well.... pizza. There were a lot of creative pizzas.Things tried:Crab rangoon pizza -- Crab rangoon base, green onion, asiago and mozzarella topped with crispy wontons and a sweet chili lattice. My personal favorite!Fongolian beef pizza -- I love me some mongolian beef, so I had to try this one too. The pizza had Mongolian sauce, sliced beef, roasted red pepper, green pepper and sautéed green onions tossed stir-fry style with mozzarella. The concept sounded good, but I have to say, the crab rangoon pizza was betterAnd for the dessert, which Fong's Pizza menu, cleverly labelled as \"Happy Endings\":Raspberry cheesecake egg roll -- Delicious raspberry cheesecake filled egg roll wrappers that are lightly fried, drizzled with chocolate syrup and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Really tasty! I don't know how they left the cheesecake consistency, while dunking this sucker in 425-degree oil, but they achieved it. A must-try!Overall, I'll be coming back here, as they have so many, many, many combinations. Other pizzas I will try will be the sweet & sour chicken pizza or mac and cheese. The staff was super nice and explained everything, and overall the restaurant had a great ambiance with vintage asian ads and art work throughout.BATHROOM REVIEW: Located in the second dining area, the bathroom was surprisingly clean, as I expected a run-down, I'm so drunk at 2AM pizza-joint, so pee would be everywhere. Not the case here. These bathrooms are  single-stallers with a toilet and sink. Everything was in working condition. Sit or squat?
