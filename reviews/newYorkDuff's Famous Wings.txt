Right off the bat, from the outside this location seems bigger than the ones we had seen around the area. There's plenty of parking, but don't let that fool you on the interior. Walking into this place, it has the cozy and welcoming place. There is a small bar as you walk in, which has couple of beers on tap. There are several which are local to the Buffalo area and other that are well known brands. The staff is really friendly and didn't have to wait around too long for a table. Being with my 2 yr old daughter, I didn't have to worry about what she will eat since they had a kids' menu. We decided to start off with the jalapeno poppers and got the grill cheese for my daughter. The poppers were okay, nothing to have about. The grill cheese was okay, seemed like it was put together real quick and served. My wife wanted to get boneless wings and I wanted to do bone in ones. So we settled on the order of boneless wings (medium hot) and 10 piece wings (hot). The order didn't take long and we were soon feasting on some yummy grub. My wings were great, right amount of flavor and the spiciness was right on point. The boneless ones tend to dry up on the sauce and were hard to chew.  Overall, the experience was great and I did enjoy myself with the food. I do recommend coming to this location if you want great quick services and some wings."}, {"review_id": "T4clPqbrF4bTeVGGq_xz2Q", "user_id": "jtPBLS-OuAxyRi39x10fTQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "What do you do when in Buffalo, you eat Buffalo Wings. However, I don't eat Buffalo Wings, with bone anyway...I eat boneless, or glorified chicken nuggets as my brother tells me.Been to Duff's a few times over the years. Before this most recent visit it had been at least 6 years.Place is super casual. Right on the corner of a busy street. Private parking lot. We strolled in around 5-5:30 on a Friday night and they weren't that busy yet. Got seated right away, no wait.Typical bar food, and drinks. Nothing spectacular. But everything we had was good. My brother devoured his wing platter. My mom & I shared the Fried Pickles app and a 1lb boneless wing plate. The 3 of us shared a large fry, it was plenty to share between us. Fries were good, nice & crispy. Fried pickles too. Liked the spicy ranch dip they came with. I can't speak for the Wings, I didn't try them, but our boneless wings were good. Nice & crispy, not soggy at all. We asked for them dry with the sauces on the side. We're wimps because even their 2 medium sauces were a bit too spicy for us, haha. Our waitress, can't remember her name, was super attentive and quick when we needed something.All in all, your typical, casual bar, with greasy bar food. Greasy, fattening food is a staple in Buffalo, which was obvious to us after our recent gluttonous weekend there, lol."}, {"review_id": "mjogZs9Y-__rasIrLV77Rw", "user_id": "AyJI-cy8aD__RXfUzNQuBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "my only problem is how much single-use plastic is served with foodaddictive wings.... and they serve pepsi!"}, {"review_id": "4Im9KsnNsGz_fn17OtMReA", "user_id": "FKPUeSBvXP5vde2FSJOGow", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "I visited Duff's on a Monday at noon and when I entered there were only two tables that were occupied. By the time I was leaving, it was basically packed. Service was okay. They checked up on us once which is reasonable since the place filled up quickly.Duff's is known for having the \"best buffalo wings.\" However, I was a bit disappointed. I got hot buffalo wings and spicy barbecue wings. The size of the wings were pretty average and similar compared to their competitors such as Buffalo Wild Wings. There isn't much options for the flavor of wings, but there are a lot of options for the spice level. However, the wings were just not for me. The sauce was overwhelming, not the taste of it, but the amount used. It was drenched in sauce. The bottom of the bowl of wings had like a puddle of sauce. It was too much for me and made me not want to eat the wings.They give a lot of celery's and carrots. Everyone also gets a container of blue cheese. The French fries were delicious. They also offer refills on sodas and drinks that are not in pitchers. Pitcher drinks are not refillable. Tl;dr - wings are basically soaked in sauce.

There are a lot of options to choose from in terms of how you can order this glorious bird.  Sauces were pretty funny to read. Their sauce include;- Mild- Mild Medium- Medium Light- Medium- Medium Hot- HotSeems pretty simple until you read their descriptions which made me giggle: medium is HOT, medium hot is VERY HOT, hot is VERY VERY HOT.  So the 5 of us decided to go with 30 wings with Medium Light.  If you're a glutton for punishment, and have an undying with to contract a severe stomach ulcer, they have some additional sauce choices - the Suicidal Sauce and the Death sauce - these don't exactly seem altogether pleasant, but to each their own!  Additional offerings include BBQ and Spicy BBQ, which sound great for the savory/sweet lovers out there.For the record, the Medium Light was the PERFECT balance of spice, flavor, and heat.  Not too spicy, but not wimpy either (well, for us at least...).  Our table decided they wanted to order an order of onion rings and the largest bowl of french fries I've ever seen in my life.  Personally, I had a couple fries and 2 onion rings - both were really crunchy and decent, but I wanted to focus on the star of the show - the celery of course.  Only half kidding here, one of my favorite parts of a wing meal is dipping the celery in the hot sauce/blue cheese combo at the end.Evidently they had salads and wraps too, we didn't venture anywhere outside the wings section - it was a late lunch and we had a big dinner event that evening, and didn't want to 'overdo it'.  You know, we wanted to keep our lunch of fried food and poultry as light as possible.  Please excuse the mediocre photos - I was more concerned about eating than using my phone.  AND since it's wings, it's kinda like that old saying once you pick up a chicken wing, your hands are greasy until the end of time.Take home message: wings are inarguably delicious.  Classic, simple, and no frills.  Your table is simple, adorned with giant water glasses and a pitcher of water (they know you'll be needing it), and industrial napkin dispenser.  The place hasn't change since 1954 (there were photos on the walls of older Duffs!) - in reality they could do with updating, making it MUCH larger and establishing a true restaurant.  As it stands, it feels like the dining room was an afterthought thrown together to accommodate people who refuse to bring their wings home to eat.  The wings are delicious, and definitely take place in the all-time-favorite category, but not for nothing, they're standing firm as my SECOND favorite (Chicken or the Egg in LBI is still #1)!"}, {"review_id": "8m23YjO59SCz_tY45rp2UA", "user_id": "RurM9i1faLCkts4MFkUKnA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Duff's will forever be my favorite spot for chicken wings until the day I die. I recently trekked 100+ miles through the remote Gobi Desert in Mongolia. On day 7 of trekking, with a daily diet consisting of mutton and almost no carbs or real food with substance, I tried to pull myself out of starvation mode by imagining I was eating a plate of bbq wings from duffs with extra blue cheese and a huge basket of fries. Sadly, those thoughts only made me more hungry and miserable, but it did make me realize that Duffs is the absolute best place for wings. The very first chicken wing I ever ate was at the age of 3 at Duffs on Sheridan. I would say I've been to duffs well over 100 times and never once had a poor experience. Wings are always delicious, service is adequate and their blue cheese is next level greatness.Never change, Duffs!!"}, {"review_id": "5e-JpWaRDcAyN97yxpUcAg", "user_id": "JW6lPfnDrxZzUzkh2b-3Cw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "So, while in Rome (buffalo), you have to have wings, it would be a literal crime not to.  Looking through some reviews, Duff's seemed like it was fairly accepted as a pretty good place, and this one was open for like 40 years.If you are looking for a nice building or fancy emmenities, look elsewhere.  Kind of reminds me of a dive that I used to go to in college.  White brick building on the corner of a otherwise lonely street, Duffs on the side.  We sat at a little 4 top, right next to their signature \"Our Medium is Hot...\" sign.The wings were what a wing should taste like. Buffalo, with a nice taste of cider vinegar. Fries were great, but we made the mistake of getting 2 sides... it is literally a salad bowl of deliciousness. Too huge, however. One fry will feed 4.

And the buffalo wings live up to the hype. Good and tasty and finger lickin' good. I think they splash up mayo and bleu cheese together and call it their secret sauce. (my guess).

Same with the inside, like an old school greasy burger joint.  Mom-n-pop diner feel as well. ~ Service was normal, no issues to me.  The appetizers were served fast, though the wings did take way longer to come out.  No biggie as I heard the wings are made to order.  :: Apps & Beer ::~ Pizza Logs ($8.99), fun lil pepperoni and cheese filled rolls.  Not like a bread stick, but more like a chinese egg roll.  It also comes with a marinara dip. ~ Fried Pickles ($5.99), same thing.  Appetizing, and I liked the crunchy breading, but that's about it.  This one came with spicy ranch.  OK but nothing new.  I'm PICKLE RICK!  Whoops, sorry!~ Duff's Micro Brew ($5), awww man refreshing!  I liked it!  Totally went well with the wings.  Worth a try too imo.::: WINGS : WINGS : WINGS :::~ 20 wings ($21.99), five mild, ten medium,  and five with SUICIDAL sauce ($1.29 extra). * The mild were actually their naked wings.  I wanted to start slow, and to test the crispness.  Eh, not the best but still passed! * The mediums were considered HOT tasting.  But to me, they were just full-flavored!  Juicy with each bite, and while they did have a good heat, I was anticipating biting into what's next...* The Suicidal Sauce!  Oh baby, scrumptious!  A nice little tingle on the lips at first, then the vinegar tasting flavor hits.  To me, the sauce in general was just GOOD!  The heat took a while to hit me, but it eventually did.  I've never had that much sweat under my eyes until now.  I definitely felt my temperature rise!  Loved it!  How buffalo wings should be served!  :::: To Note ::::~ I did not try the DEATH sauce only because I didn't want to ruin my Niagara Falls experience.  Wasn't gonna risk it.  Next time.~ The men's restroom is too close for comfort.  No, really it is.  It's tiny and gas station dirty.  ~ They sell wings online, but I plan to just buy their hot sauce.  ~ Someday I've got to give Anchor Bar a try.~ 3.5 stars rounded up."}, {"review_id": "vF26AjShIc3IFtTlzu38uA", "user_id": "VAvohuleEl5n-ntkw9UA4w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "The original location and unrivaled best wings in Buffalo!

In terms of wing quality, Duff's wings were definitely better than Anchor Bar's wings - much more tender, bigger, and meatier. Since I am a big guy on balanced flavors, I didn't like my wings completely soaked in sauce and Buffalo sauce tasted slightly too vinegary for me.

The chicken wings and drumsticks were MASSIVE. They have different levels of spiciness (from mild to ARMAGEDDON) The two hottest sauces are the Suicide and Armageddon-- both of which cost extra. I decided to try their hot sauce that they claim is \"VERY, VERY HOT\". After my first bite into the hot sauce, I was very disappointed :( the wing tasted like its been drenched in regular Tabasco sauce. Next time, I'll probably have a go at their Armageddon sauce :)However, the wings came out pretty quickly and were cooked to perfection! They were super tender and crispyyyyy.
