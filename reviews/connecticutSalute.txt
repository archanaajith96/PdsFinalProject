Always enjoy the Shrimp Agra Diablo and it is great that they have gluten free option for the pasta. During my most recent visit, I got to try the garlic cheese bread which was fantastic.

I called in the afternoon to get a reservations for two and was told they couldn't take us until 7:15. That was when we wanted to go anyway...so...perfect! The service was outstanding from the moment we arrived. Check in at the host stand at 7:10, and by 7:15 we were being escorted to our table by the very upbeat host guy (horrible description but he seemed to do a little of everything - owner? manager? host-guy?).Sat in the back near the doorway to the kitchen. There's a banquette, so one person sits there and the other person sits in a chair facing their dinner partner. Here's a suggestion that would make those of us in the chair, facing the wall, a bit happier. You've mounted a large mirror above the banquette already - why not mount one that actually goes across the entire wall, and is angled so that the person in the chair can see the rest of the room (but the angle prevents them from having to stare at themself).Our waitress came pretty quickly and took our order. We each ordered a caesar salad. They were super old school style (well - not super old school - it wasn't made tableside. Does anyone do that anymore?) and very flavorful. Teen girl had the sweet potato ravioli appetizer for dinner and she loved it. I had the scallops with shrimp fried rice and it was also delicious. They couldn't stand that we didn't have any bread and insisted on bringing some for the girl to sop up her creamy sauce that was on her ravioli. Loved that.For dessert we ordered the classic tiramisu and the (special flavor of the evening) espresso creme brulee. Teen girl is obsessed with tiramisu and only traditional, classic versions will do. Their version passed with flying colors. Absolutely perfect. And the creme brulee was also perfect.Absolutely lovely experience with terrific food. And to top off the evening, as we paid, we were brought two little bags each containing three biscotti. I can't tell you how much I appreciated that the next day when I had no time for breakfast!Thanks, Salute, for a terrific evening in the only restaurant I've ever been to in Hartford!"}, {"review_id": "Vv5VpJibYZh7kK25vXM4jw", "user_id": "p9OxtB3eBOYa-BydHDr9TQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Great and consistent quality, I got shrimp linguine which was their weekly special, delicious with a touch of sun-dried tomatoes, wish they had lasagna, that would be something nice to add to their menu being an Italian restaurant and all that!I always see this one guy helping out I wonder if he's the owner of the place.

In 2016, the restaurant won CTNow Best of Hartford Readers' Poll. The restaurant has street parking as well as discounted garage parking. The restaurant offers a notable wine list, variety of starters, salad, entrees with and without pastas, and desserts. The restaurant is always packed so it's encouraged to make a reservation. Like other Yelpers said, I'd have to agree that the food was worth the drive. They were accommodative with our party's food allergies and made special sauces for our dishes. For dinner, we shared Steamed Mussels, Crisp Flatbread, Butternut Squash Salad, Chicken Ala Bella, and Fettuccine and Clams.The Steamed Mussels consisted of lean mussels steamed with fennel, tomatoes, basil, white wine, and a touch of cream. The starter did not come with a garlic crostini as described. The creamy white wine sauce was flavorful. The Crisp Flatbread consisted of a thin airy flatbread brushed with olive oil, topped with garlic chicken, vine ripe tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and basil, and drizzled with balsamic reduction. I love how the flatbread was so crispy, not just around the edges.The Butternut Squash Salad consisted of mixed greens, diced roasted butternut squash, tart apples, pistachios, and dried cranberries lightly tossed in apple cider vinaigrette. I felt that the salad could have had more salad dressing but it was nice to have it light for a change.For any of the pasta dishes, you could substitute the pasta for gluten free pasta or spaghetti squash for an additional fee of $2. The Chicken Ala Bella consisted of spaghetti squash (instead of cavatappi pasta) topped with tender cuts of chicken breast sautéed with crisp pancetta and baby spinach served in a creamy roasted tomato and wild mushroom sauce.The Fettuccine and Clams consisted of fettuccine topped with an abundant amount of little neck clams steamed with garlic, onion, basil, and cherry tomatoes, garnished with zucchini noodles and served in butter.By the time we finished our meal, we were too full and regret not saving room for the cheesecake with raspberry sauce. Our server brought bags of biscotti cookies for the ladies in our party."}, {"review_id": "FLXpE6ijmVXEJQIMC61UYg", "user_id": "8pHm4vSfcQ8k1HoRN7mFbQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "My family and friends have talked up Salute for years so we finally decided to go for dinner.  Salute is 5 star service and dining at its finest that lives up to its wide range appeal.  If you want to stop reading this review here all you need to know is that you must go...I would definitely recommend making a reservation in advance.  We made ours at 7 PM on a Friday and still waited approximately 15 minutes before we were seated.  The host was impeccably dressed and very attentive to us as we waited.  The restaurant itself is tastefully decorated very much in the high end Italian dining atmosphere.  They have a mid-size bar, which was packed with patrons.  Staff apologized to us multiple times for the wait, but once we were seated we were waited on hand and foot!  The transition from each plate was seamless.  As soon as we finished one dish our waitress immediately whisked our plates away and had our next plate ready.We started off with the \"Soon to be famous\" garlic cheese bread.  I hadn't had much to eat for most of the day and man did those cheesy garlicy carbs make my stomach smile.   The bread was cheesy without being overtly greasy and filling so as to spoil one's appetite.  We then had the steamed mussels.  The mussels were super fresh and the portion was appropriately sized leaning on the generous side.  The cream sauce was light and a little runny, but very tasty to the extent that we savored and consumed every last drop.  I had the sidecar martini and my husband had  the chai on fire martini, which features the Hartford Flavor Company's chair liquor...both were equally delicious.  Salute also has an expansive wine menu selection in addition to their mixed drink offerings.For entrees I had the pasta a la vodka and my husband had the chicken a la bella.  Both pastas were cooked perfectly (slightly al dente) .  The vodka sauce was mildly rich and creamy without being overbearing.  The broccoli was a delicious addition and made the dish a delicious medley of textures.  The chicken a la bella was bathed in a delicate mushroom cream sauce and the chicken was amazingly tender and flavorful.  The portions were generous to the extent that we took leftovers home, but quite honestly our meal was so good I was also tempted to finish everything!As we were leaving and putting our coats on the owner, Jimmy, approached us and asked us to stay for a complimentary dessert cocktail.  He stated that he felt badly that we had to wait for our table (which really again wasn't that long) and really appreciated our business.  I have never had this happen to me before, but wow we were so taken aback at his kind offer and obliged.  This certainly speaks to the incredibly high standards that Salute adheres to and their quest to deliver the perfect dining experience each and every time. Salute is located near the corner of Bushnell Park and is easily accessible from I-84.  There is a parking garage right behind the restaurant and if you bring your parking ticket the host will discount your fare by 50%.  WE WILL MOST CERTAINLY BE BACK!"}, {"review_id": "rWa_dd67UBZAAUQVhLlL4A", "user_id": "TSEfd3MvG8_LaRwiJ01ZfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Stopped here with the family after a graduation.

Here is why.House Mozzarella and Tomato salad - House made mozzarella, tomato, basil vinaigrette, garlic crostini - The sauce on the salad was creamy and had a little lemony-ness to it. I liked it. I didn't really pick up on the basil too much through. The cheese itself was delicious. The tomatos were very wintery, under-ripe and not sweet. Though, this may just be a product of it being winter in Connecticut. Butternut Squash Salad- Greens, roasted butternut squash, tart apples, pistachios, goat cheese, dried cranberries, with apple cider vinaigrette. This salad did not have many apples on it and completely lacked any acidity. I could not tell at all that there was apple cider vinegar in the vinaigrette. It just tasted oily. Jumbo Lump Crab Cake- Crab cake with Asian cabbage slaw and lemongrass aioli. The crab cake was average. It had very finely shredded crab in it. The Asian cabbage slaw lacked flavor. It just tasted like shredded cabbage. I love lemongrass, but this aioli was weirdly bitter. Chicken Gnocchi- I'm a sucker for homemade gnocchi. The portion is HUGE. The gnocchi were soft pillows. The sauce was pesto cream. I thought it was reminiscent of a sauce from a frozen meal. It wasn't bad but I could have used more basil-y flavor. I think this may have been solved if there were more sun dried tomatoes and they were cut smaller so that you could have some with each bite. They gave us bread with a smokey butter and they gave us biscotti upon leaving."}, {"review_id": "pyPXrLhTLdXK9ANT7D3LLw", "user_id": "DuNi6Rgk8eZjFahCyFxp6Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Great happy hour spot in Hartford's downtown.

We started with the famous Cheesy bread which we def understand why it is famous now. Then for the main course, I had the filet mignon with a side of the Potato Lasagna (yes I said potatoes and lasagna in the same word) I describe it as au gratin potatoes on crack.

My partner has been talking about Salute for the last year and a half plus and we just hadn't gone together yet. He used them to cater for work and had left over cheese bread. I couldn't ask for anything better. We finally made reservations during restaurant week. We ordered the sweet potato ravioli and cheese garlic bread for an appetizer. Obviously cheese garlic bread is delicious. Soft, warm, not overpoweringly strong or salty. The sweet potato ravioli was also delicious - almost like pumpkin pie in a ravioli. But the absolute standout was the sauce. It was a white cream sauce and it was mouth watering. I couldn't believe how good it was. We kept asking for more bread because we couldn't stop. I ordered the pasta ala vodka. While it sounds simple holy moly it was anything but. The vodka sauce was pure perfection and the feta, broccoli, and sun-dried tomatoes were just delicious. I added chicken and that was also plentiful and tender. It was literally one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. My partner ordered the lobster pinchiori and he said it was delicious too. I was so wrapped up in mine I didn't actually try his. One of the things we appreciate is that everything is made in house and made to order. So he was able to add more mushrooms and customize as he wanted. The owner stopped over to say hello and the wait staff we so friendly and helpful. We also got the white chocolate mouse and it was delicious as well. I can't wait to go back and I keep telling everyone to go there because it was delicious and a great experience. We were going to a show at Hartford Stage and he owner offered to let us park for free in his garage and chatted with us. Great service. Super friendly. Delicious.

Then I ordered their garlic cheese bread and diver scallops.*Garlic cheese bread*This was good bread. It was just the right amount of garlic and cheese. I can see why almost every review recommended this item.*Diver Scallops*A word of caution when ordering the diver scallops... either it wasn't diver scallops or they didn't bother cleaning it as it was pretty sandy. It was also served on fried rice that was very similar to the Kirkland frozen microwave fried rice that you can get at Costco. I would skip it and order something else. Definitely not worth it.If it weren't for the garlic cheese bread, I thought that this place was pretty much a bust. I had high hopes based on the seeing the majority of the food pictures from other reviewers. Fortunately, the service was great. Great service usually saves the day.

The bar had a few friendly patrons and was very welcoming. Our waiter came right over to our table, introduced himself and handed us the menu and politely asked if we'd like something to drink. He came back with drinks and went over the menu and explained what ingredients were in some of the sauces in the different \"specials\". We immediately felt special, the way a restaurant should make you feel dining with them.All four of us enjoyed our meals. Highly recommend the grilled salmon with a potato lasagna and sautéed spinach. Nice size piece of fish; had to take half of it home! The meals do not come with salad so we ordered a tomato and mozzarella appetizer to share between two of us. Tomato had such a nice flavor even though it is winter here.

Our table was ready and we received a perfect spot in the dining area - I was super excited that the dining area was not too loud as to allow us to enjoy our conversation and some quality time with the family.  Our waiter was so friendly and welcoming while seating us and then discussing the daily specials - I love \"service with a smile\" and immediately knew that we would be treated like rockstars all night.. and boy were we!  We ordered another round of drinks and some starters while looking over the rest of the menu for our entree options.  Complimentary garlic bread is brought out prior to the starters arriving.  For starters, we went with the Veggie Spring Rolls and the Sweet Potato Ravioli - The Spring Rolls came with a spicy, tangy asian BBQ sauce that was perfect for dipping & the Sweet Potato Ravioli were amazing - sweet and creamy filling with a fantastic sage sauce.  Perfect was to start a wonderful meal!  As soon as I saw the Meatball Salad, I knew exactly what I was ordering {the meatball obsession is real}!  And it was perfect - Exactly what I wanted - Arugula, Cucumbers, Tomato, Fresh Mozzerella & two homemade meatballs with a fantastic marinara.  The meatballs were the perfect blend of beef and Italian spices cooked just right so they melt in your mouth.  Highly recommended!  My Mother In Law went with the Lobster Ravioli {one of the daily specials - which I wasn't able to try due to a seafood allergy} but she said that it was the best lobster ravioli she's had - and filling enough that she was only able to finish half of the dish.  My fiancé also went with one of the daily specials - Homemade thick cut pasta, spicy Italian sausage and roasted tomatoes in a creamy cheese sauce - Wow!  This was mouth watering - pasta cooked perfectly and the combo of spicy sausage and cheese sauce made this dish an absolute knock out!  We were all beyond stuffed but the dessert menu looked too good to pass up - Tiramisu for myself and my fiancé & Cheesecake for the birthday girl and her husband.  The waiter had noticed the birthday gift on the table and when her cheesecake arrived, there was a happy birthday message decorating the plate - My Mother In Law's face lit up and she was so delighted with the sweet gesture.  Both desserts were fantastic but the tiramisu was out of this world - spongy cake with the perfect amount of espresso - Delicious!  As were were paying, the manager came over to check in to be sure we had enjoyed our time and to bring us a loaf of their amazing Garlic Bread to take home {complete with instructions on re-heating - 350 degrees for 12 to 14 minutes}.  This was the cherry on top of an amazing meal, outstanding customer service and an overall fantastic experience at Salute.  Highly recommended for a wonderful night out or special occasion - You will thank me later!"}, {"review_id": "O0OP7z6Zo5br_KtczNwoSw", "user_id": "LSKGmr-uR1rfnP4KElZXmA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "Where to start.....A group of 8 of us went in tonight, manager was so nice, staff was soooo nice.We started with the sweet potato ravioli.

He said the manager was very apologetic about our rather unpleasant evening. We had come 3 hours early before our concert, leaving ample time in the hope that we would have enjoyed a leisurely, pleasant meal at such a popular restaurant. So our spirits were high and we were looking forward to the food! The wait staff too were kind enough to accommodate us. One of them went so far as to declare, \"Sit wherever you like, I don't care.\" And of course the person whoever he was, forbids it, and from there on, it was like dominoes, as people rushed past us constantly, as I told you, we were seated at the entrance of a then empty section of the restaurant! So of course we would have had a constant stream of people... and so as expected, we have people bumping into our chairs, unnecessarily I might add, which could have been avoided if the person had the foresight to seat the ones who arrived early at a better location to enjoy their meal and the ambience of the restaurant! So we left to walk around in the park soon after our dinner. We would so have loved to drink and enjoy the desserts and space of the restaurant that otherwise had a good ole' Italianesque feel to it, like you would have seen in the older section of little Italy in New York. Or on the sets of a Soprano movie. Very dramatic, lush and heartwarmingly busy. My friend passed on the message we were asked to give the restaurant another chance. I appreciate the gesture. We hope to see you soon again, so that I can further update my review and create warmer memories. Otherwise, i was most disinclined to ever set foot into the establishment.
