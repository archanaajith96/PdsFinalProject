Other Fact: this is the brisket that I did not get to trySo, we rolled out for Wednesday lunch and parked across the street from the boxy looking joint called \"The Bearded Pig.\" We walked right into a crowd of hungry lunchers waiting in line. This is a good sign. It's one of those walk up and order then they bring you your food places. Sure, I miss slowly reading through a menu, but this does speed up a work lunch which helps from missing too much time away from the office. I order the ribs with corn caprese as a side. I chose the dish because they didn't have salads and the only other vegetable was collard greens, which I have never had. I didn't want to risk a new veggie AND a new bbq flavor all in one meal.OVERALL VERDICT: Best Meat Piles in Town.Get the whole scoop at reviewjax.com/the-bearde…"}, {"review_id": "1Qu3xM52oe-Y_VA1c3H6SQ", "user_id": "GSvlKH4aFn-HUD9wTUzl8Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "We arrived at 2pm to a very crowded family restaurant...nonetheless it smelled delicious so we placed our order.Appetizer is pimento cheese and crackers....almost 30 minutes has passed and still waiting for cheese and crackers....I hope the bbq is worth it.  More to come when we get our food....An hour passed and we got our food."}, {"review_id": "9m-1TnVOHItdUM-5tfmvvQ", "user_id": "AMrhEi4bLvaAcC2XggeBsg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Great place for quality southern bbq.

I tried the smoked wings and added a rib (I like how you can only order one!)The wings were meh, definitely needed the sauce to make them good, which usually doesn't happen with smoked wings, just fried.

There is more room outside than inside. The bar will serve you from either side.  I thought it was a very creative design.  Since I was by myself, I sat at the bar.  Only after being there for about 5 minutes, did I realize there was a sign by a counter that said \"Order Here.\" I didn't want to go stand in line so I asked the bartender if I could order from her and much to my liking she said she could put in my order.  On a side note, The Bearded Pig asked for my email and sent me an email to thank me for coming. That was a first for me from any restaurant. Most BBQ joints in the southeast, you order a plate with sides.  The only platters The Bearded Pig offers are the San Marcos that has 4 meats and 2 sides on it for $25 and the Feast for 4 at $49. The Bearded Pig takes the A La Carte approach that I have seen a few times in Texas.  There is a price for either a 1/4lb. or 1/2 lb. meat but what I love is that you can order just one rib instead of a rack.  The sides are $2.50 a piece.  But the one thing I did not like was being charged $.50 for a roll, a King's Hawaiian roll at that.  Every other BBQ joint in America tosses a roll in with whatever you order.  Come on Bearded Pig! I ordered a 1/2 lb. of brisket (mixed - fat and lean), 1/4 lb. of pork, just one rib, potato salad, mac and cheese, and my $.50 roll that I had to request.  The fat brisket was truly phenomenal. Excellent rub, tender, juicy, mixed well with the sauces...it had it all! The lean brisket on the other hand, was dry and just not as good.  The just one rib was a humongous spare rib with a peppery dry rub and an easy to chew texture. The pork was pulled and good, but not as good as the fat brisket and just one rib, but light years ahead of the lean brisket.  Besides the fat brisket, the mac and cheese was the best thing I ordered.  It was really cheesy but had an unique taste to it.  I had not tasted a mac and cheese like it and I asked the bartender how it was made. She would not tell me which cheeses were mixed together or even the type of cheese that set it apart from other mac and cheeses.  The potato salad was also unique.  It was made from red potatoes, had green beans mixed in, and had a creamy horseradish that sort of held it together.There are 5 sauces at the Bearded Pig and I could not get enough of them.  There was Sweet Spot made with brown sugar and molasses with a vinegar base.  The Drizz...a Carolina mustard-vinegar base.  XXX is made with habernero and ghost pepper.  It wasn't the hottest BBQ sauce I have had but stay away from it if you cannot stand spicy.  On my heat scale, it is a 7 or 8.  Any hotter, I wouldn't been able to take it and I love spicy.  The OG is made with ketchup and vinegar for a tangy tomato taste.  But my favorite was the pepper vinegar.  It is made after the Carolina style sauce except this was the best one I've had.  It was full of flavor and not just runny.  It went extremely well with the pork.My sweet tea was refreshingly sweet...for a hefty price of $2.49.  Seriously?! Anything over $2 for sweet tea is ridiculous. Remember the song lyric I quoted at the beginning? Despite having to pay for a roll and expensive sweet tea, all I have thought about is making a return trip to the Bearded Pig.  I have grown fonder of it since my visit and can't wait until I can make a return trip."}, {"review_id": "3r_C9HNtAvQEb1foNNvIvA", "user_id": "GyAdsLfGgIwiAxA2YmtHOw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "I'm typically not the biggest BBQ fan, but I love this place! I think the atmosphere for sure has a lot to do with it, and the fact that I don't feel like a pig after eating here. The first time we had gone here was a bit more enjoyable since it was still in that hidden gem stage where many people were still waiting to find out about it. Being that we're bar people, my boyfriend and I grabbed a great spot at the outside bar, chowed down on some poutine (you must try!!) and brisket, then had a couple of beers on their outside patio. We loved the homey touch it had with the chalk paint and writing all over the fence and not to mention kicking back and lounging on their lawn chairs in the sun!The second time we had made it back, it was PACKED. It probably didn't help that we had gone at primetime for lunch on a Saturday either. We didn't have much luck with the outside bar, but we were able to snag 2 seats at their inside bar instead. I honestly think I may have liked those seats more for the purpose of people watching and being able to look out and take in the whole outside view. On this visit, I tried their pulled pork sandwich and mac n cheese! SO GOOD. Like I said, BBQ isn't normally my thing, so as the sandwich was prepared plain, I just dipped it in their mustard sauce and got a side of their jalapeno mayo that was their version of a side of ranch. Their mac of course was as cheesy and creamy as ever. I almost wished that I had thought of packing the mac and cheese on top of my pork sandwich...but HEY! there's always next time!!"}, {"review_id": "0qgx4Uj0AieVvn8BiEK0sA", "user_id": "KEDLI2GtiNQ77V4f5JjtOQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "If you want great barbecue close to downtown, this place is a must visit! We went to the Bearded Pig mid-afternoon (non-busy time) and the food was still fresh and delicious! Prices were very reasonable, two of us ate for $20 plus tip, including two drinks.My daughter ordered the turkey ala carte with the mac and cheese, and I had the white meat quarter chicken ala carte, with Mac and cheese. My chicken  had a great smoked flavor and was hot and juicy. Daughter thought it was the best bbq turkey she has ever had. Others in our party ordered the pimento cheese appetizer, which was some of the best I've had in any restaurant, it had a slight hint of spice and a smooth creamy texture. They also ordered the fries, which were amazing...as they were cooked to perfection, piping hot, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. The banana pudding was also very good, served in a mason jar with fresh fruit and vanilla wafers.I would love to come again to try some other menu items! The iced tea was also very fresh...an added bonus! Walk-up ordering, with table service.

No big deal, just didn't know what to do when I first walked in. This place has a chill atmosphere and has some seating outside on picnic tables sitting on grass, which really gives a picnic BBQ experience. The food I would say is equal to a few other BBQ places around town so nothing too special, but still good.

Maybe I just caught them on a bad day.  But I definitely didn't think it deserved the great rating that everyone else seemed to."}, {"review_id": "toZpniHZK4TN-U_8VgAltw", "user_id": "o7ekGPywm_IL60Jy1_vjTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Bar accessible from the Indy interior and the giant covered patio.

While on my TV Foodie Road Trip I decided to veer off Tv food locations since I've been to all of them in Jacksonville. No wonder I found this under local favorites. When reading the menu em route to here I knew those -Bacon Wrapped Jalapeño poppers had to be tried. They were awesome, gave some great heat. Very very greasy but I shared them. So worth $5The next great bargain was the -1 giant rib $3. This was huge, tender and flavorful. Thought we'd take a gamble on a random side dish and it was a good one-the Baked Beans. Almost like a sweet and sour soupy bean stew. Yum. I've had some great food on my road trip through Jacksonville. It's gonna get harder and harder to choose which to visit in the future.
