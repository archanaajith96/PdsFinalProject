Two stars might seem kind of drastic, but after a history of bad experiences here and after giving them another chance SO MANY TIMES...I just can't do it anymore. They are lucky I'm giving them 2.Let's start with the food. It was good, but nothing was great. I was so excited to see a sauce cart on the table! 5 different BBQ sauces and a \"spicy\" mustard. (Nothing was spicy.) The sauces were SO disappointing. There were only 2 that I found tasty and even they weren't anything special. 2 of the flavors were straight up gross. But the weirdest thing of all was that the sauces were SO watery! I've never had a mustard or BBQ sauce be as watery and loose as this stuff was. So strange.The egg appetizer was pretty disappointing. It comes with 3 deviled eggs (maybe it is just a pet peeve of mine, but why not give us 4? 2 whole eggs for one $5 appetizer seems reasonable. 1 whole and a half is kinda stupid.) the pickles almost saved it, but the texture was weird and I just didn't enjoy them.For my entree, I ordered \"almost all the meats\" which came with 2 sides and brisket, pulled pork, a rib and spicy sausage for $20. Good deal! Big platter. The BBQ was good. There was no smokiness to the meat although I was impressed with the juiciness of it all! The sides were okay. The mac'n'cheese was good but surprisingly bland. We had to ask for some pepper to liven it up (more on that later) and that helped, but the mac'n'cheese that they used to serve at the \"old\" Blackbird was miles better than this stuff.The baked beans were....not good. I'll leave it at that.For dessert we ordered butterscotch haystacks that were super bad. We couldn't eat more than a couple of bites which is always sad. The dish was not at all as described. I would personally describe them as crappy muddy buddies.Now to the service. There have ALWAYS been issues with service at their restaurant. I don't know why or if I am just that unlucky, but I have had bad service here way more than I've had good service. You'd think that with the new system it would be better, but no. My first visit to try the revamp, I wasn't even allowed to sit and wait for my friend at a table unless I ordered something. So I ordered an appetizer and was confused when the kiosk was trying to check me out even though I planned on ordering more food. The \"attendant\" at the front desk (do we even call them servers if they do nothing besides tell us to use the tablet?) told me that they kiosk would start a tab for me and then I'd get my total bill at the end of my meal. WRONG. I got charged at the kiosk for the appetizer and then again for my entree later. Which would only be mildly annoying if not for the fact that she specifically told me a tab would be opened for me. The service was slow and very inattentive during the meal. No salt and pepper at the table which is weird and when we asked for some pepper the server just dropped off a pepper grinder at our table and left again. I've been told at other restaurants that is something totally against health code (which is why most places crack the pepper for you until you tell them \"when\") but maybe that has changed? Not sure. Anyway...my second visit I was turned away 35 minutes before closing because \"it is their policy to stop seating the restaurant at 8:30\" even though they close at 9 and the restaurant was still full? Makes zero sense. Change your hours then.All in all...the Blackbird has always served some pretty decent food. The location is great and the concept sounds good on paper. But there are lots of places where I can get GREAT food and GREAT service on a CONSISTENT basis. And this concludes my short novel on why I won't be returning to the Blackbird."}, {"review_id": "yTGnNw8_YjsHEahIVH1p4Q", "user_id": "HreYkfRKShpFT2ezUJUSDg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Super sad about this review, blackbird was my favorite place to eat in Spokane pre-remodel :( I was skeptical but optimistic when they announced they would be doing a new menu since I had never had one issue with any of their food the many times I had been there. However, I figured it would still be great since it was the same owner and it was previously great. I finally checked it out and upon walking in the atmosphere was already different and way less welcoming. The host stand was empty and after reading the signs I finally figured I needed to ordered from the kiosk first to be seated. After ordering I finally found someone to ask if I seated myself they said yes. After getting a table I had a \"tag\" with a number that I wasn't sure of what to do with, I was able to flag someone else down and they said to hang it up on the hook. So first impression wasn't the best but was still remaining optimistic. The service was completely different then any other experience I had there previously. it wasn't very busy at all yet all the servers seemed overwhelmed and unhappy to be there. Our server finally came and rushed our drink order then by the time she brought our drinks there our food also came! So that was a plus that the food came out fairly fast :) the food however was Luke warm. The quality of the food was OK but not very much flavor for a bbq place and nothing compared to the food I had previously had there :( the bbq sauces on the table were runny and had to be mixed to find one I liked. As a \"new\" restaurant that has unique styles of service (kiosk, tag, etc) I feel that the servers and hosts should be explaining everything much more then they did to us nothing was explained. I would say the food needs a definite upgrade in flavor and a downgrade in the price. The prices were reasonable pre remodel but the quality of food is just not as good but the prices remained the same.  Our server only came by to bring our food and then the silverware we had flagged her down after waiting to get boxes for our meals. we saw our server walk by many times even looking at our table yet waited 15-20 mins before having to ask a guy who wasn't a server for our boxes and he brought them right away along with our check. Even if our server had forgot about our boxes I was surprised she didn't even bother to check on us that whole time, and again it wasn't very busy.  Overall it wasn't a pleasant experience. Food & service was 2 star and I'm very sad to say I won't be back which really sucks because I LOVED that place"}, {"review_id": "Z_bblWfB4eEkb9cJ4eGp9w", "user_id": "d5mW5pBRvnl8uCDgpKC8Sw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "The Blackbird was a great a little spot just outside Downtown Spokane. It looks like it was an old warehouse building that has been repurposed giving it some character. The food choices were excellent, and delicious. You can see the portions were also generous. I must say the turkey and dumplings were excellent and the food is clearly fresh and very high quality. The service was ok. Perhaps because it was early in the week and it wasn't busy but perhaps because one of our group rubbed her up the wrong way when we arrived. Either way it didn't really matter to the experience overall. The only thing I wasn't sure with was the atmosphere. When you walk in it was like a dinner hall sort of area that is bright and open. Then the bar area is more like what you expect, darker and that cozier feel. The dining room area just felt like it was sterile, cold and industrial. Perhaps that is what they are going for but it gave me mixed signals like it was struggling with its identity. This is the only reason for the 4 star but atmosphere is just as important as the food. Finally, the price was exactly what I would expect to pay for food of this quality. Probably a little higher than some of the places nearby but deservedly so. Overall this is a great spot. I'd love to check it out again at some point and I'd encourage you to do the same."}, {"review_id": "ABTYW8H8oDAfq5erbF9ZyQ", "user_id": "ketkOcAihzxs2zAp-qUjNQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Went here to check out the food after the remodel. I want to preface I liked the previous Blackbird. Service used to be a bit slow, but the food was good although kind of on the expensive side. They remodeled some interior, the layout, some design and their menu to transition to a BBQ establishment. Cons:1. You had to order something in order to get a table. 2. Service was slow even though they were busy, but not packed.3. There were six different sauces on each table. I sampled each one; none were spicy and they were runny/thin. In fact, I put one sauce back and the force of putting it back made the sauce jump out of the bottle and got onto my friend. :-/ 4. The mac and cheese was a bit bland and we had to ask for pepper.5. Got their \"butterscotch haystack\" dessert and it was awful. We were confused when they brought it out - it had microgreens on it. The description did not say anything about microgreens. The description also listed chocolate savings, but we both believe it was cocoa powder with the dessert. If you've never had cocoa powder, it's not sweet. We ate a few bites, but we didn't finish it. Pros1. I ordered four tacos with four different meats to sample a variety. The jackfruit was ok, the chicken was ok, the pulled pork was decent and the brisket had the best flavor. All of the meats were not dry and seasoned. 2. They changed their entrance to the doors closest to the parking lot!Overall: I felt very letdown. They said they would let me know when open (they didn't). The food was not as flavorful as it used to be. I don't think I've ever left a dessert behind...until now. Nothing I ate was outstanding."}, {"review_id": "unfUqQ1PGCpqrmZeW_Ysww", "user_id": "-VcpxUvLzFen2tkw2qzhGg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Well come in from the city of Atlanta this place was going to have to make a steep curve serving up barbecue in Spokane WA so let's see if they get the bird we let them fly.. for me the MAC n Cheese Failed it was very bland and almost seemed like it was straight out of the Kraft MAC n Cheese Box. The ribs on the other hand win!! Great full body smoked flavor and nice peppered crust with tender inside to the bone full of flavor and quite tender. Add the \"Hello Im Bruce Lee\" Sweet and spice sauce was just delish !  Now you know in ATL we have diabetic sweet teas although it wasn't sweet enough for me it was infused with a great peach flavor and they brought a side of simple syrup that made it just right! Diabetic sweet and peachy  to meet GA standards. The brisket chill was pretty tasty very hearty and was more like Brunswick stew and a decent kick and the meat was super tender but a bit too spicy for me. The roll it came with on the 3 rib platter was hard and stale but ahh ok we'll give them a pass .. now I was going to give them a 3 but decided a 4 was worth for a few other reasons .. barbecue is the main stay here and I have absolutely no complaints when it comes to the barbecue. They have a salmon salad that looks pretty good too. One unique thing  they have on the menu is vegan friendly BBQ Jackfruit!! They are one of the few restaurants I've visited  that serve smoked barbecue jackfruit which is really awesome if you're Vegan and still love BBQ. I'mAlso giving them extra credit for having \"Hello I'm HotLanta \" spicy mustard sauce gotta love them repping ATL in Spokane. On to desert! Nice selection of unique eats. Buttermilk pie, Curry Chocolate donuts (okey), Butterscotch Haystacks ( potato chips marshmallows, peanut butter and shaved chocolate) ahh yeah I wasn't feeling bold enough to try that one . Drumroll they have PEACH COBBLER with SMOKED VANILA ice cream. Can they pass this test coming from the city of the best peach cobbler ever ? The crowed goes WILD wow I could do just a review on the cobbler !! You can actually taste the smoke flavor in the vanilla ice cream Amber crust is like a yellow butter poundcake with fresh peaches oh my God I should've just come for this. Atlanta this one might have you beat. The drink menu and bar selections are great and the casual atmosphere is good to go with a great patio on warmer days.Wait it gets better !

We dropped in on the first day of the new menu.Now when you walk in you have an awesome self service  kiosk or you can order from the front desk area. The menu choices are the typical bbq joint selections but with some flare. We ordered (I forgot the name of the appetizer) but BlackBirds amazing French fry's covered in cheese sauce and topped with pulled pork with roasted garlic cloves nestled in and around the fries. We added the Mustard BBQ sauce and the chuck Norris to jazz it up. Can feed easily a table of 4. Almost all meat plate - Pulled Pork, Hot Link, a rib, and a slab of brisket. The two sides I choose where Mac and Cheese and Potato salad. Plates also comes with house-made pickles and a bun. When ordering the plate you get to choose your sides, and they have quite a few things to choose from. The best thing while ordering the plate they ask you \"fatty brisket or lean\", I choose the fatty side and was not disappointed. I mentioned above that it was a SLAB of brisket. Juicy and tender. Pulled pork and the rib where good, salt and pepper coating, typical Texas style. The hot link- on point!

Apparently they no longer use the entrance from the street side but rather from the parking lot which is a plus. Walking in, there is a bit of confusion. You must place your order with the hostess standing under the big overhead menu. You then find your seat and place your drink order at the table. Here is where it got confusing. My son finally decided what to order and went back up to the hostess only to be told, \"you may order at the table\". My son also witnessed another gentleman who finally made up his mind along with his partner on what to order and the hostess said the same thing about ordering at the table to which the gentleman replied, \"I guess you don't want to take my order\". The ordering process is very confusing AND they do not allow substations. Since I ordered smoked wings, I wanted ranch rather than blue cheese however was told we make no substitutions. I found that very odd. Moving along to the food- the 6 BBQ sauces on the table are not good. Blackbird states the sauce has a twist on the sauce which the 3 of us at my table did not care for. We then requested butter for our buns and the waiter returned stating he could not find any and will continue to look. The manager then presented my soon with his food and we once again requested butter. He brought back 2 pats of hard butter mentioning they don't carry that for those dining however grabbed it from the kitchen where they use it for cooking. He did say he will make a mental note though for the butter. I had the St Louis ribs and both my husband and I thought this does not taste good. The dinner roll was hard and crumbly. Mac n cheese was oily and did not taste as such. Smoked chicken wings had a peculiar taste like star anise or 5 spice. That was returned after a bite. If one wants fries, you must order the frenzy fries with a cost of $13 and the pimento cheese sauce did not compliment the fries. I used to love and rave about blackbird but can't find myself returning nor anyone in my party. To top it off, we asked for a bag to carry out the leftovers and the server said it was her first day and not certain if the restaurant carries any, she returned and said no they do not. The food is expensive and the quality is bad. Nothing has a nice Smokey pecan wood taste as they claim Perchance we caught them in a bad day."}, {"review_id": "5_wF_vWJTBwhR-0n7EfR-w", "user_id": "bFDkBx53MqCYNYkHJplFOQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/7/2017", "text": "We had some out of town co-workers and decided to give The Blackbird a try for dinner, even though I had heard some mixed reviews from people.

It was apparent that she knew the menu as well as the beer list.The beer list is very extensive with plenty of NW beers. Lots to choose from. Everyone in our group easily found something they liked.

The bread pudding was very different but good. It had peanut butter, banana, and topped with brownie batter ice cream. The key lime donuts were tasty!I should mention that that parking can seem a little odd if you have never been there. The lot next door seems like a pay lot, but it is not if you are eating at the Blackbird. At least there is off street parking.
