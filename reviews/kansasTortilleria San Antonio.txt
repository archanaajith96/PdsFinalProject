The tacos asada are great try it with some onions and cilantro and limes and you have yourself a decent little taco..,get three under $5 and you got a meal. They have a variety of self serve sauces to flavor whatever you get. Try them all...cause your have plenty of drinks to choose from.

They have authentic tacos in all selections of meat. They have a huge menu of authentic Mexican food. Their tacos are cheap and delicious. They also have a grocery store.At noon it gets packs, on a Saturday. In the backof the store  is a full butcher shop. I had a shredded beef taco. It was really good, in a  soft shell, exactly like the street tacos in Albuquerque. Their taco bar, was really good.I can't explain the sauces, but I got the most mild.What I liked about the grocery store was it's pastries and bread available near the eating area. I'm now a fan of Tortelleria San Antonio. And I think it could be one of the better places in the area."}, {"review_id": "8hPRq72nL0pcewSmrT76TQ", "user_id": "V9sI4XnVxhX7HbRqMzdAAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Best tacos I've tried in Kansas City so far.

The tacos are delicious. Sauces are great. Well priced all the way around, things like 5 limes for a dollar. I think the tacos are 1.50 each. The best part imo are the tamales.

I've been really feeling the spicy side of food-life lately and really let my cockiness get in the way here. I loaded up on electric colored hot sauces as I sat down to enjoy my 4 taco lunch (3 el pastor, 1 asada). You know when you accidentally swallow wrong and subsequently cough for the next 10 minutes? That's never fun. Welp, try doing that and basically inhaling a load of habanero hot sauce on your first taco bite. I sprung out of my seat and ran in circles while literally everyone looked at me about to burst out laughing. I'm sure they thought, \"man this guy absolutely can't handle the spice.\" They wouldn't be wrong. I start choking on liquid lava and just grabbed a huge bottle of water and chugged it to try to clear my throat. My sinuses were plenty clear at that point and I'd worked up a pretty good sweat.After that fateful first bite, I sat in a meditative, slightly embarrassed silence trying to salvage this experience while my nostrils, throat and brain burned from what just took place. Then I got on to the meal which was amazing. Fresh corn tortillas, piping hot meat inside, and of course onion and cilantro on top. I skipped the hot sauce on taco number two, naturally. Everything was so enjoyable that I saw they did a dozen tamales that you can order to go, so I snagged a bag of those (and paid for my hastily stolen bottle of water) and was on my way, happy to know I have another great taco joint to hit up again.I will say at first glance it seems a bit far -- far from downtown, or far from the 'burbs. However, if you ever find yourself near 39th street and the KU Med area, it's really only 5-10 minutes from there, so I recommend checking it out!"}, {"review_id": "zGCGVCeTpUQpm2sVmIi5vw", "user_id": "r5b2VV4jJRw-tI6ulglxOw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/30/2017", "text": "The restaurant is not in the most glamorous part of town, but definitely worth it. It's right next to pollo del rey, Which was also sending off enticing smells of smoked chicken but we decided to give this place a try. Like many similar locations, San Antonio is a hybrid between grocery store, butcher shop, and mini restaurant. Their menu is fairly straightforward. I ordered 4 tacos for 5 dollars : carnitas (steak), pastor  (marinated pork), and carnitas (deep fried pork). My favorite meat was the pastor. The marination gives it a nice refreshing taste that compliments the tortilla. The tacos are also really good because of the type of tortilla they use (Which I'm not familiar with but seems like a corn tortilla). They have various sauces to add on the tacos, as well as lime, onion, and cilantro on the side you can add on yourself. Overall a very good experience and the food was cheap and tasty. We were the only non Spanish speaking people which I liked. Means the shop has a good reputation!"}, {"review_id": "3wLvkJCuhfogntzh8-1IRA", "user_id": "kQsFf6nYJH0ItiBGgt9KlQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2017", "text": "Went in for the first time today and I'll be back for sure!  You have to love this kind of atmosphere to appreciate the experience.  I'm not upset by un-bussed tables.  I don't think anyone expects a tip really, so enjoy the cheap eats.

I really liked the barbacoa tacos.  A friend had the menudo and said it was very good, too. On the next visit I will go on a weekday so I can study the menu better, it's all in Spanish.  I advise looking at the menu here on yelp so you don't feel like a fool when you walk in."}, {"review_id": "Jqbx40WLVk9hyHDchmG3Ow", "user_id": "ldCCHvTBbwtPcj8KMfSGcQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/6/2017", "text": "Dude just do yourself a favor and order some pastor tacos.
