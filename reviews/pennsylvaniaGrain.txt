This is actually the first restaurant I tried. My girlfriend came visit me in Allentown and I thought we can go to a nice restaurant near the town center. She was forty minutes late, so I got a drink or two at the bar and  talked to the ladies sitting at the bar. Everyone was very friendly, including the bartenders. So first, customer service is on point! When my friend finally got here, we both ordered the chicken and waffle. We ordered real late before they closed but they did not rush us or anything. :) and let me tell you their chicken and waffle is freaking delicious. I was nervous to order at first because I had the best chicken and waffle in this restaurant in Pittsburgh. It is hard to beat that. However, I was pleasantly surprised how good it is. The chicken is crispy the way I like it. The 'powder sugar' is actually powder butter, where they dehydrate the butter and turn it into powder form. (Chef at the restaurant told me that lol) it's so cool. Me and my girlfriend are both chemists so we were pretty intrigued. Anyway, if you're hesitant to try Grains, don't be! Give it a shot you won't regret it. I am definitely coming back in the near future."}, {"review_id": "Z2rwTVt0nmgdV3eh1Llthg", "user_id": "CV5BB7OUPuxW6rdrAX-ahw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "This is an incredible gem nestled in the downtown Allentown restaurant \"district.\"  Honestly, I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. The bar is on the first floor. (Plenty of outlets for cell phone chargers, too). And the drinks are expertly crafted. Trevor was working at the bar on Sunday. We were definitely well-attended to.  And his food recommendations were really on-point. Might I add that there's a definite benefit by checking in on Yelp while at Grain?  Good idea if you plan to order food. I highly recommend the chicken and waffles. They were finished with a bit of pear and powdered butter.  So divine. My friends enjoyed the lamb meatballs; while I happily indulged in the large warm pretzel. Since we were there anyway, dessert sounded like a good idea.  The vegan creme brûlée was highly recommended. It was sold out. The banana pudding sounded good. Ooh it was. And it really tasted great with the perfectly chilled Dirty Grey Goose Martini!Thanks, Simon for talking with us too. We will be back soon!"}, {"review_id": "PsHEwIG8HYDXFsLpur2Sfg", "user_id": "0p3HVLXMnmcJygO6qZxptA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "I was so happy this restaurant was open on Sunday. It had pretty decent variety of regular/vegan/vegetarian food choices on menu and wonderful fun drink menu!! Our waitress \"Snow\" was wonderful. She didn't rush us, and let us know about the food ingredients which was helpful.  The two of us shared small plates of the cheesesteak egg rolls - which were so delicious, Mac and cheese and a beet salad that had roasted veggies cooked perfectly.    Dessert!!! Mmmmmm Banana pudding!!!! And lemon crumb. We both had to try them both. Couldn't get enough!! I'd travel back from NJ just to try some more on this menu ..... but definitely to have more of that banana pudding."}, {"review_id": "33JOYDC82yMorY2IIGuEIg", "user_id": "2OiyOHo7CQY05bFwY55HjA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "This is the second time I've been here and the food was delicious.  I had the chicken and waffles and it did not disappoint!  It was huge and my friends also had a taste and really liked it as well.There are two levels in this establishment and the hosts were very welcoming and polite.  It's a nice and cozy place to take a date for sure.  Parking in street or parking garage only.  It's just blocks from the square and in a safe area.The drinks were just okay and nothing spectacular.  The bar downstairs seemed busy.  If you're taking a date, I would recommend asking for an upstairs table.  It's much more quiet and private upstairs.  I would highly  recommend getting a reservation if you're going for dinner.  I would imagine the tables fill up pretty quickly.  In the Summer, they do have outdoor tables.  Not sure if you can eat outdoors or not but my friend and I did have a drink outside.I would recommend checking this restaurant out for sure and don't forget to try the chicken and waffles!  They absolutely rock.  I'll be getting it again the next time I go there.  You may also want to look at the menu before you go.  It's a bit unique."}, {"review_id": "Qm2KP1tqxr3jcZdin072xQ", "user_id": "3q3TcyDoS-T8d5Tr-tYbgw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Fried chicken sandwich is the bomb..followed by duck quesadilla...tasty and crispy...vegan meatballs...all superb!Enjoy your Grain experience!"}, {"review_id": "nEQ-TLBq2PmgrCWu0n3a4g", "user_id": "J-mAoXQRiAeImwLa7M7CEg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I really really like this place so I feel bad giving it a bad review, but I have been here three times and have had two bad experiences.The first time I came here I had no issues and everything was great.

We did the Behind the Scenes tour at Martin Guitar today and then had lunch at Grain. Glad we did. We shared the General Tso's cauliflower and the quinoa black bean fritters for an appetizer. They were both soooooo good!! I had the eggplant sandwich, which was fabulous. So much flavor. My boyfriend had the brisket grilled cheese, which he really enjoyed. I had a blueberry jalapeño margarita, which was good.. a little too salty tasting They have a good beer selection. Lots of local beer. Also, they have a bottleshop next door. We stopped there and grabbed a few different kinds of beer to bring home. Definitely try Grain!

It was made with a tasty sauce (general tso) and was fried perfectly.  My boyfriend liked his steak and I grabbed a sandwich that was satisfying!Presentation was cute too on a neat board!  There are tons of vegetarian and vegan options if your into that and they were very accommodating to allergies.  Great place, I ve been there a couple times and have never been disappointed if anything I wonder why I don't go there more.  Get out and try it :) great for a date or girls day!"}, {"review_id": "6F7kaATQsr3gmNeEPT5epA", "user_id": "uJS2StuC1c60-GvysgRIJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/8/2017", "text": "I love grain. A group of eight of us booked this a month ago on OpenTable.The feeling of the first floor is industrial which was great. The exposed brick and large metal ducts...I was concerned when everyone in the group were asking a lot of questions about the ingredients. They weren't as taken at the start. That changed when we got our food...First off, the lamb meatballs tasted like lamb and were the best meatballs I've ever had! Period.I ordered a special pork board ($21) that included pulled pork, pig ears, house made pork rinds, some of the best pork belly that I have ever eaten (and I have eaten a lot of good Filipino lechon kawali), bread, pickled vegetables, and pickled mustard seeds. This was a feast of pork and fat all for $21. The only thing missing was salo or lardons (hint hint, wink wink)The eggplant hummus was great as was the flat bread that came with it (sorry I don't recall what it was from the menu).For dessert, we had the flourless chocolate brownie with Nutella and panna cotta. Great rich dessert. Not very filling. Although I was torn since others at my table had banana pudding and that also looked fabulous.Our server was also a bartender. What I really liked about her service was her excitement for the food overall. I love when servers have tried the food and love it themselves. That makes the meal an event.I will be back."}, {"review_id": "8FSzcVVknTyfTdL1anGqpA", "user_id": "lnwgT875LzFrfLI5nG_nQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "I stopped in here after dinner near by for a few drinks.

Way too much bread for the amount of prime rib they give you, which was poor quality and mostly just chunks of fat, and there was almost no crab. I barely tasted any crab at all, it was basically undetectable. I asked for a side salad instead of fries, and the salad was undressed greens topped with soggy sweet pickle slices and nothing else. I literally never leave yelp reviews and am generally pretty easy to please food-wise, but this is a $15 sandwich and was extremely disappointing.

I keep heading to downtown to make it feel like I've actually travelled somewhere and spotted Grain. in one of far-too-many walks up and down the epicenter of Hamilton St. The street sign alone tells you this is a place worth walking into...so we were excited to finally be able to give it a try!I started with a Honey Nut Old Fashioned - It was a good drink, well mixed, with peanuts in it and the unique flavor of Peanut Honey Bourbon. (Ahh peanuts...what can't you do.My wife and I shared the Brussels Sprouts  Four Ways. 3 of the ways look similar to each other and one looks different, so we actually had to \"count the ways\" to make sure we had all four...there was smoked, pickled, fried and what we'd call \"overdressed\". We liked all of them except for the overdressed (the more slaw-like tower in the middle of the others...It was definitely fresh, just too much dressing for our taste.) The cherries was a nice addition.We also had the Stout Gingerbread Carrots...all three of these words are divine on their own, together, they created a new carrot mecca - The dish was not overly sweet and looked yummy, though we would have preferred slightly more al-dente carrots...overall it came together nicely.I loved the Castle Valley MillsFarrow...it served as a hearty main for just me (it's on the small plates menu) It included mushroom, asparagus, cherry tomato, roasted fennel, poached egg, pine nuts. Very satisfying.My wife had the Charred Asparagus Salad for her main. She said it was a delicious salad with a beautifully poached egg on the top. Also on top, the pickled mustard seeds on were a unique visual and flavor addition. Everything went together very well.Not on the main, but reason enough to come to this restaurant are the French Fries. Come to this restaurant just to get the french fries. Do this. They're hand cut in the back, perfectly thick and delightful with the malt vinegar they brought. Again these don't appear on the menu but, dammit, ask them for them.There's a full bar downstairs which looked suitably hipster and nicely habitable, with a full dining room upstairs and private room available in the back for your unique private party needs.Allentown is now officially on the modern foodie map!"}, {"review_id": "D6DxbS0tBx2mx0zJszFquA", "user_id": "1ZgdSVmSLqGGGBpRfSKx6Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/12/2017", "text": "I found myself in Allentown on a rainy day, with a free afternoon and a hungry appetite. I met an old friend for lunch at a place called Grain located in the center of Allentown's business district. The place came highly recommended from both word of mouth as well as Yelp and Trip Advisor - my go to food finding apps when travelling.The space is a typical of old row homes of Allentown's yesteryear. A narrow bar occupied the first floor with a few tables for dining, but most of the eating area is upstairs on the second floor. We settled into a table and began to look over the menu and two things immediately caught my eye.First was the Roasted Butternut Squash Soup. The presentation was everything. I was first presented with a bowl holding a small gathering of hearty ingredients- chopped apples, whipped goat cheese, pumpkin seeds, orange zest and diced butternut squash. My server then poured the creamy soup into the bowl over the apple mix.I think this was one of the better soups I have ever had. Not only was it thick and hearty, it was perfectly spiced and rich.I then chose the Charred Asparagus Over Arugula Salad- a decent sized portion of asparagus with spicy arugula, roasted onion, poached egg and pickled mustard seeds. The greens were tossed in a lemon vinaigrette, the entire salad was very light but filling. I particularly enjoyed the mustard seeds as they added an extra unexpected flavor to the salad. Either the salad or the butternut squash soup would make a satisfying meal on their own, but together they were perfect.We were also invited to try some of the specialty cocktails that are unique to the Grain menu. The bartenders have experimented and created their own signature drinks. The first we tried was the Smoked Blueberry Margarita. The key was the house made smoked jalapeno blueberry syrup and while it was wonderful in the alcoholic beverage, it was very tasty when just mixed with club soda.The Honey Nut Old Fashioned was interesting. Listen to these ingredients- peanut infused bourbon, macadamia nut liqueur, orange bitters and a peanut honey simple syrup. Garnished with peanuts, this drink is both unique and full of flavor.The Grapefruit Thyme is a concoction of gin, Captain Morgan Grapefruit, fresh lime, tonic and grapefruit juice. Although tasty, it was the less interesting of the three. However, there are a lot of cocktails on the menu for every taste.While I ate off the small plates menu, there is also a selection of larger meals such as Seared Duck Breast, Chicken and Waffles, and Cobia fish. Grain is open for lunch and dinner 7 days a week and while reservations are not required, they are highly recommended."}, {"review_id": "GZl_XEKCGtHK8oCxcYHNyw", "user_id": "nK6I8wUFU_cyk_3x_IQ29w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "Easily my favorite restaurant in the lehigh valley.
