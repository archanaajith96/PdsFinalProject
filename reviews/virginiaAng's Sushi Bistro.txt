We got a coupon that's $10 worth off of $20 or moreWhen we got there the waitress sat us down and before she left us she told us to look at the board of their specials instead of telling us. The freakin board was across the room written in faded marker on a white board . I could barely see a letter . Anyway, we ordered the bento box which was their special going on from 4:30-6:00. Its $10 a box. Came with salad, 2 shumai, an orange, and your 2 choice of rolls or kitchen items. My favorite roll was the OMG roll!! No wonder it's called that because after tasting it I literally said oh my gosh so good lol. The salad was refreshing and tasty. It had this citrus zesty dressing. The bento box did leave me satisfied and full.However, we weren't allowed to use the coupon on specials so we weren't able to use it. But we'll be back to use it again for whatever is on the menu."}, {"review_id": "e-RuFOXudpPI7LMTatqZrA", "user_id": "tofM7Z-nY35QmyyyQJ7IFA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/6/2017", "text": "We decided to check this place out because I have a gift certificate for $10 off from restaurant.com so why not. We all know how expensive sushi can get. However, this certificate does not apply to special offers such as the bento box early bird special.We came here for the bento box early bird dinner special. $10 for your choice of two items (sushi/kitchen) plus salad, two pieces of shumai, and miso soup. The early bird special runs from 4:30-6 pm. The inside of the place today seemed warm maybe because they turned off their AC? Not sure what happened here. The miso soup came out hot and flavorful. And the bento box seemed way bigger then the pictures show. The salad it comes with was exceptionally good with some orange zest. I ordered the volcano roll and 1/2 OMG roll and OMG was it good. I wish I had a full roll but it was still good. Overall a good deal for the meal. There's good sushi over here !"}, {"review_id": "eG7tCtrl24lhY0Hj4-s1wA", "user_id": "GIFWSgbMaH_D3WBTye7gyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Nothing but perfection.

Came here on a stormy Tuesday evening around 5pm.  There was only one person at a booth and it was very quiet.  We met another couple there and started out with several appetizers.  Calamari, miso soup, salad with ginger dressing, and a couple orders of the special of the night, fried tuna appetizer.  The calamari was a smaller portion than what you're used to at other restaurants, however, the sauce that came with it (bbq/tangy) was yummy and it was cooked perfectly.  Soups were basic, seaweed and cucumber salad was also pretty basic, but very tasty.  Their fried tuna appetizer was very good, the only thing that threw me off was that the tuna was cooked, but rolled up fried, and with that awesome eel and spicy mayo sauce was wonderful.I was impressed with our rolls. They were very delicious and it just leaves me wanting more.  My husband and I ordered a Tiger roll and a Crazy Ang Roll. Delectable! Not only were they beautifully plated, but they melted in your mouth.For dessert, we tried the mochi ice cream. 3 different flavors, strawberry, green tea, and mango. WONDERFUL!! I absolutely cannot wait to come back and try the other rolls. I noticed they had Bento Box specials for $10, and I noticed they had an extensive menu of wines and sake. I'll try next time!"}, {"review_id": "rVy4sB3Sa9zgxBLlIX0CfQ", "user_id": "tu-8_OG4JpbW2jAgjHL_AQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Great atmosphere,great food, great service! First off they get 5 starts for being efficient in vegan cuisine, my sister called in and placed an order (she's vegan) they didn't do like most places and just make a vegan meal they really took into account the sauces and everything that are used on their rolls.......the were considerate enough to not douse her food in nonvegan sauces which is rare! Definitely worth a visit!"}, {"review_id": "YMBWPus6TWjZuAmxrjdyFA", "user_id": "P2VwTR-pwCZK-IAtNZzU-A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/22/2017", "text": "I quite enjoyed Ang's Sushi Bustro. They offer good quality rolls for a pretty good price. The service here was also friendly and helpful without being overbearing as I have expirenced with other sushi places around Hampton Roads. The ginger dressing on the salad is the best I ever had. It has so much flavor.  It was the first time I've ever been impressed with a side salad with ginger dressing. As for the rolls, they were beautifully put together. Nobody likes a sloppy sushi roll that falls apart when you pick it up with your chopsticks. They also had a nice ratio of filling to rice, and each of my spicy rolls had a kick without overwhelming heat.The dessert was a real treat. Fried Tempura Cheesecake. It was warm on the outside while being cool on the inside and maintaining the consistency of cheesecake on the inside.  While I appreciated this, if you like your fried cheesecake to be warm on the inside as well let your server know so they can heat it up a bit longer.All in all, Ang's provides good quality food and service."}, {"review_id": "sUB7-79hCO3i900HQxdZpQ", "user_id": "UzORoQ_fU_IOneGWx_wpVw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/19/2017", "text": "The waitress was very friendly. She helped my boyfriend's son open his Japanese soda. He got a real kick out it and really enjoyed it. He even saved the bottle. The seafood was very fresh and tasty. Beautiful presentation as well. I had the Hurricane Roll and the Seafood Naruto. Both were delicious no rice options. Ang makes all of the sushi himself so if you go with a big party be prepared to wait. You won't be disappointed though. The food is worth the wait.

I've tried a few appetizers with my sushi and not too bad, love me some edamame and calamari hehe! Also noticed they have another server, and she seems to be very friendly. Heard she's actually the daughter of the other waitress.Every time I come here, it's usually with the cousin. She loves her sushi! I'll be coming back, I definitely feel a lot better with their attitudes. Seem a lot more friendly and kind. (Maybe caught them at a bad time before) They basically know what we like and drink.I definitely recommend their Sushi, Ang is a Master Sushi Chef from design to taste."}, {"review_id": "auPo0QBHu7s_lM7S6JH9Fg", "user_id": "6o054xotI7rU8G6zaIFYbg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "We recently had dinner at Ang's Sushi Bistro and it was wonderful.

Various rolls see pictures- fresh, great flavor, beautifully presented.  Loved every one we have tried. Edamame - cooked and seasoned perfectly.  No need to pick through here.

The place was completely dead when we came in for dinner around 6 o'clock good for us because that means a shorter wait time. The two of us begin our meal with the seaweed salad, and the seaweed salad here is pretty solid. Then out came a sushi rolls: we had the Spider roll, the Volcano roll, and the My Best Friend roll. To be honest, I couldn't choose a favorite out of the three, as they were all delicious and very fresh. Each role consisted of 8 to 9 pieces, and I honestly could've gone for another one or two rolls-they were that delicious!For 3 rolls and the seaweed salad, our meal rang in around $40. So the prices were pretty standard and not over-the-top here, and I definitely didn't mind spending it because all of the freshness and quality of the sushi. Definitely be sure to check this place out... I hope to be back and order more next time!"}, {"review_id": "7A8GwXrPHQigEyB_Q0Wg1Q", "user_id": "Gl-iBCFds0S6geKP3e8yTQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2017", "text": "Is there an option for 10 STARS?

I was talking to some friends tonight and I was very adamant about them adding Ang's to their list of places to visit. The quality is unmatched.We split a number of things and it was impressive all the way through. We had the soft shell crab, Ang's special, salmon carpaccio (my favorite), the spam sushi (for all you spam lovers), and while I enjoyed this, I ordered chirashi and wished I ordered one of his specialty rolls. With that being said, I would recommend that you don't order sashimi or chirashi. If you did what you'll get is fresh and you'll love what you eat but Ang's creativity stands out among the many chefs in the area and you'd be missing out on his special creations by not ordering his rolls. From design, taste, and presentation, it's something you don't want to miss. I won't wait so long until my next visit."}, {"review_id": "hGC-SWuamSjJbsIEO1vqLg", "user_id": "Wu0Ze5MiylGLKVVqs16eow", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "Not from this area so I looked up a place to get sushi with good ratings.
