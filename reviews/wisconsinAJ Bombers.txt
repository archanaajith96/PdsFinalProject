Good, not amazing. We all had Milwaukee burgers. The meat was thin and the cheap bun overpowered it. The Neuskes bacon was of coarse delicious. It was Neuskes. It was fun to be bombed by peanuts.

They have it all. Atmosphere 5. I mean peanuts delivered to your table via bomb carts - hell yeah. Food 4 - love the peanut butter burger. So original and addictive. I crave it frequently. And if you want to be healthy you can get any burger as a salad. Staff is great. Waits can be long but I get there early to get my spot.  Space is fun.

We visited AJ Bombers while visiting from Chicago. Drove all the way here. The greatest thing is Yelp has a waiting list feature now. When we arrived, we asked if they received the waitlist notification. They said excitedly, yeah! We have been waiting for you and have a table for you! We felt so happy :DWe also tried the Gumption hard cider, Spotted Cow beer, and funky monkey milkshake. The hard cider is pretty good. Almost like the Angry Orchard crisp apple. The Spotted Cow beer is so so. The milkshake doesn't have a lot of peanut butter and banana taste because the vanilla ice cream and rum taste take over. The peanuts are so good! Definitely recommend this place for cheese curds!"}, {"review_id": "CIjOy7TdybwwvSjvtNI0tA", "user_id": "OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/4/2017", "text": "I recently came here for a double date with my best friend while in town. Once you walk in it's pretty small inside and also there's tons of graffiti everywhere which I couldn't quite decide if I hated or loved. I did enjoy the flying peanut bombs though, super unique concept.As for food my boo and I shared the cheese curds along with a cheeseburger with fried onions and pickles added. The food was great! The cheese curds were cooked deliciously and I liked the chipotle dipped sauce. The burger was also very good too, great flavor in the beef.Obviously I saved the best for last (review wise at least), the Bloody Mary. It came out with some standard toppings of green olives and pickle, but my personal favorite was the bacon cheeseburger strip. I've never seen anything like it before & it was awesome! They also give you a cute little beer chaser too.

If you're looking for good burgers in a fun environment then this place is for you. However, if you're looking for the best burger in town or an amazing burger that will blow you away, there are better choices. I would still recommend giving this place a try since they do have a quality burger menu, good service, and a fun atmosphere.Tips:-Street parking is horrible but there's a paid lot across the street to the East.-Get here early or call ahead for a reservation since it fills up fast.-DO NOT come here if you have a peanut allergy since they give them out free and they're everywhere on the restaurant."}, {"review_id": "CkQ2WM6Pi3y-Eonwe7FI3w", "user_id": "QGg38S3_4DN4O0-vFXGybA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Had the Mac and cheese burger, the Mac and cheese was surprisingly deep fried very well, and the beef patty and pretzel bun were good as well.

We tried the barn burger and the medusa burger. Both were delicious. The bbq sauce on the medusa burger was a tasty yet unexpected touch. The prices are so reasonable. I tried a Crispin Blackberry Pear which I'd never seen before and was really happy with my choice. The only thing was all the peanuts on the floor, although I hear that's part of the novelty of this place. Not the best burger I've ever tasted, but we left VERY happy.

The atmosphere is fun here too, what with the airplane bombers sending you peanuts and all. The place is a little smaller that expected inside, so you may anticipate a wait. We were willing to sit outside, but this is seating along a busy road, and in the afternoon, the side is pretty shady too, so for us it got a little cool after a while.Burgers are solid, good balance of ingredients, but not overly complicated. They do not come with sides, so we ordered the curds app as our side to share. It was a gloriously unhealthy meal. You will 95% most likely be able to finish your burger in one sitting, so don't expect leftovers. We left feeling satisfied, not overly stuffed.

We came in on a Saturday night, and, expecting a wait, agreed to the 45-60 minute window we were quoted. We came back after about 45 minutes at a bar next door, and then waited another 20 or so minutes to be seated. To be fair, we were quote about an hour, and it took about that long.  However, we would have been seated sooner except a lady with another party kept complaining to the hostess about the wait.  It seemed the hostess finally caved and let them combine our table to be with another while we waited for another table to finish, be cleared, and then set up.When we were finally seated, everything went pretty well; we ordered our burgers and poutine to share as an app.  The poutine took about 20 minutes or so, and was really vary good. After finishing the app, we then waited about 40 minutes for our food to be brought out to us. 40 minutes for a hamburger is a long time, especially in a relatively small restaurant with an even smaller menu. I'm not sure what they were doing in the kitchen, but making burgers seemed to be low on the list of priorities. The burgers themselves were ok, but more what I would describe as a fast food type, kinda like what you would get a 5 guys. The \"bomber sauce\" they use is very good and goes really well with the burgers.  The fries and the tots were great, well seasoned and very crispy.Lastly, the service wasn't great.  I already mentioned the hostess quietly reassigning our table to accommodate a jerky customer, and then there was our waitress.  It isn't that she was rude, in fact she was very polite. Its more that she kept forgetting/messing things up.  I asked for my burger to be on a pretzel bun, but it was brought out with a regular. She only refilled our drinks during our 60 minute wait for food twice, and we had to remind her to bring out the custard that came with 2 of the meals we ordered. Overall the food was ok with less than great service. I just wasn't impressed, and I'm sure Milwaukee has better burgers."}, {"review_id": "ZcwAHO6JH5orp_iOeiEUFw", "user_id": "S8wBuwcx4fBkeku81JlZJg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/20/2017", "text": "Brought a friend visiting Milwaukee to AJ's for a good burger and she loved it.
