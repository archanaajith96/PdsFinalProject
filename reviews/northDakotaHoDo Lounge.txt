I had the filet with sweat potato grits and oh my! Let me tell you, one of the best dishes I've had. I typically am not a fan of grits but these were exceptional! *disclaimer- they did over cook my filet the first time. I'm never one to send food back but those who are fans of rare/med rare can understand when I say you just cannot eat med-well steak. They took care of me right away and the second steak was like butter and cooked to perfection! I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town!"}, {"review_id": "tSSBIM4rgP8Z2XqGaBv3mQ", "user_id": "BqDWnVTBpr5dg6J5A4pnYg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Not a bad place to watch people on a sat afternoon especially when the prom kids are walking around getting their pics taken when it's below freezing outside .. bartenders ok but not overly friendly .. shame really"}, {"review_id": "COQY-qepOqIzUPT3-HpZ1g", "user_id": "Zpl3GNP_9MAXZQhWCvtasQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Rudest waitress ever.

Sara is lovely. We had the grilled Caesar salad with salmon, the wings with hot sauce and the pretzels. Delish! Also a nice bottle of 2014 Bordeaux. Fargo is proving to be really great. The people are so nice, always a hello in passing. Wonderful Saturday farmers market on Broadway. I can't say enough good things.

Came here with colleagues for lunch on a freezing day and the waitress immediately offered us hot tea! The menu of teas was lovely and was served nicely and tasted delicious. We ordered the lavosh off the special list and it was magnificent with super fresh veggies . And a large portion. The beer cheese soup was amazing and the croutons on top were phenomenal, they added a nice crunch. I ordered the appetizer with shrimp and sweet potato grits and it was AMAZING!! The grits were sweet yet savory and the shrimp was plump and yummy. The service was overall great and the atmosphere was hipster, chill.

Jason has got to be the 'happiest' bar tender. He always has a smile on his face. Based on his recommendation, I got the red quinoa salad and it was amazing with quinoa, beets and a sherry vinaigrette (See my picture). I ordered the bison burger again and it was just as good as the last time, if not better.Their scotch collection is also impressive and I tried a Scapa 16 today. The big question on my mind is 'how do I convince them to open shop in Chicago?'."}, {"review_id": "xY3MjtbrYRGSEXt_xehWgw", "user_id": "pxRszHLAnbJcU9oG00KdQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/16/2017", "text": "For an app the shrimp scamp was perfect, and this happened to be one of the best restaurants try duck.

We appreciated the emphasis on displaying interesting art. And the curvy bar is simply very cool. Lot's of loving attention to detail. Huge windows provide a view of the street life. I just really liked this place and, with all due respect to Fargo, was surprised to discover that Fargo has numerous nice restaurant. We really expected to end up eating at a chain.We were very pleased to find a bottle of Argentine Norton Reserva 2012. Two thumbs up for that! We ordered a couple of appetizers and a main course to share. Everything was perfectly prepared, but the Rhubarb Berry salad needs improvement. Unfortunately, the rhubarb was stringy/chewy, instead of melt in your mouth, but the Wallyeye sandwich was quite good. Service was polite, attentive and professional.

She was the best server I've ever had there! Great recommendations, kept my water filled as well as my cocktails. She is a huge part of why the HoDo received as many stars as it did. Now onto the food and drinks. I probably sampled eight different drinks as my friends and I all tasted each other's selection. The Moscow Mule is by far my favorite! The copper mugs are awesome and they taste so delicious! There was a cucumber one in a big glass that was extremely refreshing. I also liked the yamhatten. It would be helpful when ordering the drinks if you knew how they came-rocks, straight up, etc.Food-overall everything was pretty tasty! The goat cheese ravioli were good but a little too rich for my taste buds. The hanger steak was delicious but too much red wine reduction in it so that the flavor of the steak was over powered with sauce. HoDo is a fun place to go and grab a drink and spend time with friends. I'm looking forward to the deck opening!"}, {"review_id": "1IGKOk17Jk_5ftT9Al1wHA", "user_id": "bR5rUDlUIHqmzfazbZEiHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2017", "text": "One of my favorite places to go.  Great location, people watching,  menu changes often.   Aarons makes the best Lemon Drop Martinis"}, {"review_id": "ohPo7r_NYJl8pCaVt3pJ7Q", "user_id": "EJ6_42rw8W73rxm_R4aQ2w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/23/2015", "text": "Visited this place on the recommendation of a local friend. Dinner and a cocktail on a Thursday afternoon at 4. The place was busy and WAY understaffed. Even so, my server made no attempt to hustle and often just ignored me. It's incredibly frustrating to come go to a restaurant, watch others be seated after you and served before you. This place charges premium prices, so there is just no excuse for poor service. My bison burger was good but not prepared as I requested so it was delivered overcooked. No need to do that with Bison. The food was great, but honestly it left me wishing I had gone to Culvers instead and saved both time and money. I know this place is a local favorite, but I can't recommend it."}, {"review_id": "JG8OUKoZltUGh53kF8UrHQ", "user_id": "_y3lP_tgm6XmSRDYkW8Irw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "10/17/2016", "text": "The HoDo is usually a great place for food and drink. Unfortunately, it took 20 minutes to get my first cocktail, it's a Monday night, the place was not busy, and my friend's drink came about 10 minutes before my own. We figured perhaps they ran out of an ingredient, so brushed it off. Ordered a drink when the food arrived, and lo and behold it took 15 minutes. Unacceptable. Our waitress was wonderful, but new. The bartender was more concerned with her 4 bar patrons than anyone else in the room it seemed.
