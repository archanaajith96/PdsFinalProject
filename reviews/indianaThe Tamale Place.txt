The Tamale Place offers the merger of those two worlds. The tamale and taco was flavorful and could be a dim sum like item. The tamale was wrapped in the corn left that offer a slight aroma to the tamale itself.  The meat was tender and juice inside the dough that makes up the tamale. The taco was one of the best I've had for sometime. I hav always felt tacos have two key factors, the shell and the toppings.  I'm picky with my soft shell corn taco and this was perfect.  The meat was busting with flavor but also cut into perfect sized cubes; plenty of it to boot. If you want a fast but filling meal for the taste buds, this is the place for you."}, {"review_id": "dW_GwN_6eJjCwWG2eGvaAQ", "user_id": "wcv6ypJ7oNdfBA6QiB0pgw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "Um. Yaaas! I first off love Tamales!!! My sister-in-law makes them authentic so my standards are pretty high! This place definitely meets my expectations of a good tamale! They are SO yummy!!! The menu is super diverse, also, there is an availability menu that shows you how many tamales are left for each flavor.This place is a little pricey- most Mexican spots are pretty economical, but this is a little on the higher side of the scale. The bathrooms stay pretty clean and the staff is nice. I have gone during the rush hour a few times and man it's so much pressure to order because it goes so fast. All in all this place is a must visit in Indy!"}, {"review_id": "0efe1JkhQFihZrO437VcIA", "user_id": "79ac1iJiHRT0jqn16lNMGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "So I was headed to the gym around the corner and 10 Miles later we ended up at the Tamale Place. Have you ever heard of it? Well, google and go...this place is golden. I seriously feel we hit tamale jackpot! This is the truth. So Lyn, with two snaps, is amazing!! She make us feel totally at home and explained everything we asked. Well, we asked for food and she gave us the run down of how amazing it was. It is. It really is amazing. Lyn with two snaps is a truth teller. The tamale place is for tamale beginners to tamale aficionados. It's for families. It's for everyone. The spicy chicken has the perfect blend of flavor...bonus, they were not dry.The chicken in the banana leaf was my fave. This was reminiscent of all that was missing from my life. It sealed the deal. It was the million dollar answer on who wants to be a tamale-naire. I can't tell you to go here, but as Phil Collins plays on the radio, I can feel these tamales in the air of the night. Oh lord!! I've been waiting for this moment for all my life!! You're welcome in advance..."}, {"review_id": "HAuVR1zVq0-mKVsnVx0lqQ", "user_id": "QYKexxaOJQlseGWmc6soRg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "While on a trip west, I decided to stop in the big cities along the way and eat a meal at places shown on DDD. I chose Tamale Place for that reason, and because we love tamales. The person taking our order was very helpful, nice and welcoming.  The tamales are large, and tasty. The tortilla chips were also very good. The surprise to me was how much guacamole you get! Huge container! I think nearly a cup, maybe a complete avocado. We're still full.

Or a tamale. I'd be one happy taco. Or tamale. :-)No seriously. In pursuit of the best tacos in Indy, we landed here at The Tamale Palace. No...I meant palace. A palace is the official residence of sovereign and exalted people/things. This is the residence of the supreme ruler of Tamales. All Hail Tamales!!  And we were greeted by Lyn, who was full of personality and service!  She was awesome! She gave us the lay of the land and helped us order.  She even checked on us because we'd told her it was our first time here. She let us know that this place was on Diners, Drive In's and Dives. That's cool...even cooler, Phil Collins is playing. It's a very simple place. They have a simple menu and if you came for tamales they even have a board to tell you how many of each one they have remaining for the day. I hear there is staff that just makes tamales...all day.  Let me tell you about these tamales...magnificent!  They were full of flavor and not dry.  They have the right amount of spice and didn't need salsa or anything. Just delicious tamales.  We had the spicy chipotle chicken, spicy chipotle beef and the spicy chicken in a banana leaf.  I'm not sure what the banana leaf does to the tamale to make it taste so different but it is also bursting with flavor and not dry. Of course, I had a taco. A pork taco. It was delish!  The pork was cooked perfectly with great spice and flavor. I wanted to just eat it with a fork and some black beans. Great flavors abound. When you come here (oh, we know you're coming here) get the queso and chips. The chips are delicately fried tortillas. Great crunch and you'll want to drink the queso with a straw. It's that good!! You have to try this place."}, {"review_id": "Y_FrTEEb67xjSRHJaEVu5A", "user_id": "OIDpKC2p61qVO_spPqw1qA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/8/2017", "text": "Giant tamales. Huge. YUGE. I ordered two tamales and a side of chips and guacamole because I was expecting the tamales to be the normal size -- you know, like the size of a woman's hand. These are more like the diameter of a dinner plate. I could just barely finish them. (And then, like a true Mexican-food meal, I was hungry again as soon as I got home. Ah, well.) I've kind of given up on Mexican food in Indiana, so I was pleasantly surprised by The Tamale Place. I guess I should have known it was good, because it has been recommended by several people on Yelp whose judgement I consider sound, as well as one person I follow on Twitter who is from Southern California and knows something about Mexican food. Everyone was saying to go to The Tamale Place, so I obliged, and I'm glad I did. The tamales range in price from $2 to $8. The tamales available also vary, so what's listed on their menu online might not be the same as what they're actually serving that day. They post their actual menu in the store. If you're looking for a specific kind of tamale, you should probably call them first before you stop in.I got the pork with red sauce in a banana leaf for $6, and a poblano chile with cheese for $2. They were both the same size. They were both good, but I preferred the pork because it's a little more like what a traditional tamale tastes like, and I'm all about tradition when it comes to Mexican food. The chips and guacamole were really good too. The chips tasted homemade and were thick and greasy, in a good way. The guacamole was house-made and fresh. There are other things on the menu besides tamales, such as nachos (we got some steak nachos), tortas and tacos. But how are you gonna visit a place called THE TAMALE PLACE and not get a tamale. I mean, really. Just get a tamale.FYI: They only serve black beans here, which is kind of whack for a Mexican place. I need my pintos."}, {"review_id": "YQsohTg_87sWKWmSb20ykg", "user_id": "hj6Km_xKbAkJdOaiha3ffg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Super dooper place for tamales.

Who doesn't?It's not really in a convenient location if you don't live near the west side but it's with the trip from time to time. (PS they have a location in City Market downtown)Tacos were made evenly- and by that I mean each bite had the same ingredients (& this is really important for me with tacos!). They also used tons of cilantro in the Chicken Verde Tacos- and I don't think you can ever have too much cilantro. You get one lime wedge per taco- but can purchase more if you'd like for a nominal fee total we paid $19 for 6 tacos.

It was a very health portion in both items.  Cooked thoroughly and seasoned well.Which one was better? Well, for me, the beef was pretty good, but the pork, OMG.  I don't know if it was the meat, the sauce flavor or the combination of both, but I tore though that like a true carnivore!  My biggest regret was only buying one in pork.  If I had it all over to do again, I would have purchased about a dozen...If you go to Indianapolis or anywhere else where this restaurant exists, as a tamale lover, it's a must!"}, {"review_id": "QGy_wiGEyQ7Sq6xdcQc-3g", "user_id": "Z4o3yIkrLutOxLFr_1Xynw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/20/2017", "text": "We have been to Indianapolis several times over the last couple of years and had The Tamale Place on our list, but we always seemed to run short on time.  Tamales are one of my most favorite dishes and I try to find restaurants that have them on their menu.  This trip we specifically put The Tamale Place on our calendar so there was no excuse to miss out.It was easy to find and we arrived around 12:30pm.  It was a busy place, especially given that it was a Sunday.  But there was a short line and a couple of empty tables were available.  We had identified essentially what we wanted to order from studying the menu and photos on Yelp.I ordered the Spicy Pork Tamale and a Poblano and Cheese Tamale while my wife ordered the Mild Green Chicken Tamale and wanted a Pumpkin Tamale-but they were not available, so we tried the Apple Pecan Tamale instead (almost too sweet but great tasting; hard to believe that there are tasty dessert Tamales).The staff was friendly and patient with a couple of first timers as we figured out the menu.  It was slightly confusing because there was a large menu board that I was trying to select from but then they pointed out a smaller digital menu that shows what was available.  Once we placed our order we sat down and our food was brought to us almost immediately.We learned from reviews that these were not dainty mini Tamales so we limited to these four.  Everything was delicious and met our expectations (aside from no Pumpkin  Tamale) based on a couple years of anticipation.  We didn't try any sides or other dishes because, after all, it IS The Tamale Place!  I definitely want to return when I am back in the area."}, {"review_id": "S_Jmbf2M76TYotXVm70BFg", "user_id": "3lYoXkEHl9vAPsjQuH6rcg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "This is my second trip to Indianapolis in a year and a half and each time I made sure I came to the Tamale Place.

Right away you'll know if they have the flavor you want and how many they have. Service is always decent. One thing I didn't like were the nachos. They were SATURATED in cheese sauce.

So I walk in, and I see these Mexican ladies working in the back making the tamales and I told myself, this place is legit! I spent about $20 bucks for 5 tamales. On the streets you can find them for $10 for a dozen, so I felt they were over priced at first. So my wife ordered with the mild meats(Pork in red sauce, chicken in green sauce)and I went with the spicier meats.(Chipotle beef) and Hot & Spicy Pork which was my favorite and also very spicy. I ordered a side of salsa and sour cream to pour on top of my tamales. These tamales were humongous and well packed with meat. I've even eaten some homemade tamales that lacked meat.
