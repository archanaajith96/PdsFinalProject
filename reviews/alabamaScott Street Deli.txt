It's a nice little mom & pops deli with very friendly people working there. From the fresh baked bread they use to huge stacks of meat they pile on your sandwich every thing is absolutely perfect. I ordered the club and it blew my mind. It was specially made to my liking. They also had a huge variety of beverages in their cold case. Lastly my favorite was they gave a free cookie to the military in uniform. I will definitely revisit before I depart Montgomery."}, {"review_id": "TyrBwvcnAQUvcKUSC631_Q", "user_id": "tere929rRn8ZyGwY-1TuDg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/13/2017", "text": "Sandwiches are one of my top 3 favorite foods.  I am always looking for somewhere that does it right and Scott's Street Deli nails it.  I had the Frencheletta sandwich on wheat bread and it was to die for. It was served on fresh homemade bread and had an olive relish which was very good.  Also, the sandwich was loaded with meat.  The service was excellent and friendly and they give you a free cookie if you are military.  The restaurant is a small hole in the wall, but it is very clean and well kept.  Overall this place was amazing and I will definitely be back. I just wish they had better hours. They close at 3pm and are closed on the weekends; however, this seems to be the norm for restaurants in downtown Montgomery."}, {"review_id": "h64RpgJr3Wl3Eun7-EY8HQ", "user_id": "lxuqpIiRM48U61cLuUQ7Zw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/13/2017", "text": "I stopped for in for a mid week lunch with some coworkers. We'd been trying come here for weeks.  Finally we got the chance to try this place out, and it definitely did not disappoint. Scott Street Deli is conveniently located in downtown Montgomery on Scott Street! It is a small family owned deli that serves an assortment of sandwiches and salads.  Upon entering I asked my sandwich artist what the post popular sandwiches were she happily replied the Italian, the club, and the frenchelleta. All three of us ordered the most popular sandwiches. I can really only attest for the Italian but my rating for the sandwich itself is 5 stars! You are given the option between white or wheat homemade bread OR you can have regular store bought.  I ordered the white homemade and HIGHLY recommend it!  The bread was very light and soft. There is a generous helping of meat and your choice of condiments and toppings. Pro tip: if it is your first visit OR you a military you get a complimentary fresh baked cookie of your choice!The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because of their hours 10-3 Monday through Friday!  However, since it is family owned I completely understand.If you are looking for a good lunch spot to fill your belly I highly recommend stopping by!"}, {"review_id": "6uauM14T6QxbDT53xE-dXw", "user_id": "VRwqfU3ghv8GRHKTBAA_dQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/11/2017", "text": "Huge sandwiches, reasonable prices, friendly people, great service, decent sized dining room, and great tastes... what more could you want in a local and historic sandwich shop?"}, {"review_id": "fJP_tMmwiuPf7UL4TjXvqA", "user_id": "_uz6qpln0w3_iDOa6Yoiag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/13/2017", "text": "This place is a gem that the Gump is lucky to have.  Consistency and quality each and every time without fail.  It doesn't matter if I order one sandwich or ten they are always on point.  They should offer classes.  Keep up the good work!"}, {"review_id": "PuxsAf8-BKbomJfkNrsWFw", "user_id": "sV4gBBw0ozw-nwRXtdUMNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/6/2017", "text": "We like to eat local when we travel and we went out of our way to come here and boy was it worth it! First off, founded more than 100 years ago in a horse stable that is two days older than dirt and reeks of all things eclectic. There were paintings of the restaurant covering many of the walls. The chairs did not match the tables and might have come from a night of dumpster diving (I hope they did, what a cool vibe this place was given by the total utilitarian feel of everything there including the shelves, cashiers counter, everything felt second hand, and that's totally okay and cool with me, it was clean and usable!) But I'm rambling on, the atmosphere was great but let's talk food. There were three lines to order from, each one manned by a true connoisseur of sandwich creativity. I was lucky enough to have Jonathan as my taste bud wizard. When asked what was the best sandwich there, without hesitation he said \"the Italian\". \"Serve it up.\" I responded as quickly. Piled high with fresh hand selected meats, lettuce, tomatoes, paper thin sliced red onions, provolone cheese, all stacked to heavens on home made white bread to die for. Jonathan was moving himself to demigod status as he deftly whipped through containers building what was soon to be one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. After giving my Earthly bound sandwich genius a quick tip in the jar hanging in front of his station, I paid for said treat and sat down to eat.... holy cow! This was arguably the best Italian sandwich ever. Bar none! Take a look at the pics and tell me you have better! The bread melted in my mouth and the texture of meats, veggies and dairy blended to bind my soul to a future 500 mile return trip to the Scott Street Deli.After sating myself on this hidden deli open only for lunch and founded in a horse stable more than 100 years ago, I was treated to a home made oatmeal cookie as it was my first time there, but it won't be my last!

It doesn't qualify as a deli? Why? They failed to pass mustard...the mustard test that is.At every deli I visit for the first time, I order a Ruben just to see if they know what they are doing. A Reuben is corned beef with sauerkraut and swiss cheese on rye bread with thousand island dressing, or in a pinch Russian dressing. If they put mustard on the sandwich, they fail to pass mustard. If there is mustard on the sandwich, it is corned beef and swiss on rye, not a Reuben.I ordered a Reuben, and they squirted mustard on it before I could say anything. A real deli would make it correctly. Thus, this is just a sandwich shop.
