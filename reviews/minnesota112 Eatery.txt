Do make reservations as it can be crowded without one. We were able to reserve a table for two at 630 PM on Friday. The interior is dim, classy, and intimate. This is good for small groups or a date spot We were situated in probably the best booth with views of the bar and others. Our waitress was friendly, accommodating, and ready to meet our needs (though I do have some comments on service that I will cover below). Took the recommendations from others and ordered the following Ordered - Frog Legs (5/5). Excellent. This is well seasoned, not gamy, and falls right of the bone goodness. Some would not try this but it tastes like chicken essentially. I really enjoyed this and it may be the best version of frog legs I've had to date - Duck Pate Banh Mi (5/5). Delicious take on a Vietnamese classic. The bread is so soft and spread of the pate unifies it all together. Well done- Scallops with Seasonal Mushrooms (4/5). A bit of a normal dish since scallops tastes almost the same at any restaurant. The mushroom garnishes were toasty and delicious though - Tres Leches Cake (2.5/5). It is a-ok but way too saucy and heavy. There is so much condensed milk below the cake that it gets absorbed pretty quick to make the cake almost impossible to eatOne suggestion though is to not make it totally obvious that you want your patrons out. 112 Eatery is not the biggest restaurant so spaces are limited. I get it that there are reservations and the challenge of meeting space needs. However, if I am not done with my food, do not push me out. The waitresses and cleaners would ask if our plates were ready to be taken off the table despite it being like 3/4th eaten. I will sit in the booth as long as I want and don't appreciate the hintsOverall, 112 Eatery and I will be definitely be back to try the extensive menu and some other known dishes (e.g. meatballs)"}, {"review_id": "HRkaTzixXMIzgyeLEHY7NQ", "user_id": "ErWPjeuK5uKHLmtz4BM9ng", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Great experience overall! Came here with a friend on a Friday evening. Good thing we had a reservation, since there always seemed to be a crowd waiting by the door throughout the whole night. The interior is dim and classy looking, could be a good romantic spot for date night (probably not ideal for big groups). The food menu is pretty extensive and SO interesting. They've got unconventional dishes that you might not normally crave, but will be tempted to try here. We decided to share three dishes: frog legs, scallops with mushrooms, and duck pate banh mi. Frog legs were EXCELLENT - juicy, bursting with flavor, best I've ever had (and yes I've had this dish numerous times elsewhere). Scallops/mushrooms were good but this dish was not particularly distinctive, and the banh mi was fantastic! Not the typical Vietnamese banh mi you're used to, and the bread was a lot softer and fluffier than you'd expect. For dessert, we went with the tres leches - a bit too sweet. Kind of wishing we'd tried something else. Skip the cocktails and push yourself to try one of the more adventurous dishes! I'll be back to try the foie gras meatballs sometime soon!"}, {"review_id": "T4fKpCAXV9y37hy688623A", "user_id": "opdbggrufvUGH8gP9wHL8w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/15/2017", "text": "112 Eatery is widely considered to be one of the best restaurants in the Twin Cities, so we just had to give it a try. There were a lot of things we really enjoyed about our evening, including the drinks, atmosphere, and service, but the actual food was a fairly mixed bag of both really good and really bad. While we walked out of 112 feeling good about our night, there are certainly things that the kitchen can improve upon. Here's some detail:The Atmosphere: Amazing. A very cozy restaurant with two stories and a European ambience. Definitely a romantic setting, with lights turned low, soft music playing, and candles at every table. Overall, a very nice place to enjoy a night out with that special someone. The bar area is also pleasant. Bathrooms are clean. The restaurant is also only about a block from the closest skyway entrance.The Starters: Like I said above, we had a few dishes that we thought were absolutely amazing, and a few that we did not like at all. After our \"extras\" (see below), we started out with the scallops and the fois gras (please don't judge me!). After falling in love with fois gras in France, I was happy to see it on a menu in the States. And, while not quite as good as the best foie I've had in Paris, it was really pretty tasty and well cooked. The accompanying (absolutely perfect) soft-boiled egg and salad made the dish even better. The only thing I would consider adding would be toasted bread, which I think it almost essential with fois. The scallops, on the other hand, were not good at all. They were super overcooked, and the mushrooms were pretty dry. I would not order this dish again. The Main Dishes: For our main dishes, we got the duck paté bahn mi, the lamb sugo with stringozzi pasta, and the fois gras (again, don't judge me!) meatballs with tangliatelle pasta. The bahn mi was probably the best I've ever had: from the amazing french bread to the perfect duck paté, this dish was the star of the night. It was even better than all the bahn mi I had in Southeast Asia. I would highly, highly recommend it. The pastas were a different story. While both pastas themselves (homemade!) had a nice texture, their sauces were disappointing. We both thought that the fois gras meatballs were tasty, but the pasta they were served with was way, way too salty. The Lamb Sugo was probably the worst dish we had that night: the sauce was way overcooked (oversimmered?), tasting like it had sat at the bottom of a pan with the burner on for too long. Stay away from this dish.The \"Extras\": Unlike a lot of really nice restaurants I have been to, 112 includes a lot \"extras\" with dinner (maybe this is a Minnesota thing?). You will be greeted by a bowl of spicy/sweet almonds, green olives, and bread. All were very good. To finish out your night, you'll receive some caramel almond popcorn, which is a nice way to end the evening. These are all really nice touches and probably amount to $20+ worth of food per table at most restaurants. Extra points for all this.The Drinks: We actually had quite a few drinks, and we liked all of them. I started with an Old Fashioned, and while not the absolute best I've had (too many small pieces of ice, which melted quickly and started to water the drink down), it was pretty darn good. The house wine was also good and very reasonably priced. We decided to have drinks for desert too (we live downtown and didn't drive, so why not?) The moscato that I selected was a perfect way to end the evening, and the toasted hazelnut cocktail (I can't remember the name of it...sorry!) that my fiancé had was one of the best sweet cocktails either of us had ever sampled. If you like creamy hazelnut beverages, you have to get this drink!The Service: On point! Our server was absolutely perfect. She was super attentive (but not overly so), very knowledgeable about the menu, had great recommendations, and offered us a couple samples of drinks before we chose. She even split up the bahn mi for us on two separate plates, which was a very nice touch. Food and drinks came out very quickly. All in all, an amazing restaurant for service.Bottom line is, 112 Eatery is a great place for a nice night out, but while drinks, atmosphere, and service are all amazing, and they offer some great food, there are dishes on their menu that need to be improved."}, {"review_id": "6-_sVyKsNiyOUHsdIlsfZw", "user_id": "1xy9ox5M6FWkLkeV4ppnBg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Everything we had was awesome!

Loved the food but disappointed in the service. I felt like the waitress treated us like we weren't good enough to be there. It started out with the drink order taking forever and then they forgot our gnocchi and we had to ask for it. They eventually brought it after we finished our their entrees, thankfully we were all sharing so nobody was sitting there without their meal. I also heard we were supposed to get complimentary popcorn with our check but that didn't happen.Despite all that I love the food. We split all the dishes and started out with the Bibb salad and prawns which were served with a tasty remoulade.  Would order the prawns again.For the entrees we split stringozzi, tagliatelle, gnocchi, and burger.  Stringozzi was by far my favorite. The noodles were the right amount of chewy and the lamb meat was flavorful and delicious. I liked the burger 2nd best, it was a little rich with the cheese but still loved eating a burger on an English muffin. Nice and juicy!My mom's favorite was the tagliatelle with foie gras meatballs but I wasn't a big fan. They forgot the gnocchi and it was sooo steaming hot when it finally came out. It was pretty good but would have liked it a little creamier. Maybe that happens as it sits for a minute and isn't so hot.We couldn't leave without getting dessert so we tried the famous tres leeches.

I think we must have just had a fluke experience or ordered the wrong items off the menu. Maybe the chef was sick? Who knows.. Atmosphere: Weird. Two floors, and they need better signs telling you where to go. The front entrance leads you into a hallway. To the left there is a door that is blocked by people waiting to be seated. We almost didn't go into the room because we weren't sure if the door was usable since so many people were standing in front of it. You are either seated on first floor, or you go to the second floor in this old elevator. There is a bar on each floor, with \"interesting\" artwork around the room. Service: Our waitress had zero personality, we tried several times to get a smile or initiate a conversation other than \"what do you want to drink\", \"do you need a refill\", or \"what would you like to order\". Did not happen. She almost seemed nervous, we weren't in a rush to get out of there, but when our appetizer had not arrived within 20 minutes of ordering, she checked our table at least 3 times, which gave us a weird panicky vibe.Drinks: Good selection. I think anyone could find something on the menu that would interest them. Drinks were the highlight. (1 star)Food: The complimentary bread course accompanied by the seasoned almonds was delicious. (1 star) Everything went downhill from there. We ordered the fresh ricotta appetizer. Be prepared for a ton of orange zest. It is all we tasted, it completely overpowered the fresh ricotta. The bread that came with it had good texture and held up against the smear of the ricotta. For the entree, I ordered the stringozzi lamb dish. The waitress told me it was an absurd amount of food and to get the half order. It was not massive, maybe in MN they have a different idea of massive but the dish was maybe 7 forkfuls of pasta and that was it. Maybe she was trying to subtly tell me I'm fat? Who knows. There were tidbits? of lamb throughout the pasta, but you did not get any actual pieces that you could distinguish you were in fact eating lamb, or any type of meat period. Nonexistent is a good word to describe it.The pasta was congealed and flavorless. I've had better pasta from the place down the street from our house, and it doesn't have a James Beard award winning chef at it. My fiance ordered the osso bucco. It was nothing special, I've made better at home in the pressure cooker so not sure what that was about. We both were so disappointed with our food that we both left a good portion on our plates. As a last straw to save the night we ordered dessert due to the raving reviews on yelp. We opted for the yuzu-pear strudel. Ice cream was good in flavor and texture but that dough was EXTREMELY under cooked and dense. Another thing to leave on the plate. Finally they came with the bill and they also brought a little glass filled with popcorn. YUCK. I don't know what kind of spices they had going on in there, but we HATED it, I don't usually use that word in my reviews but it was so bad I almost spit it out. So acrid in flavor, I literally had to brush my teeth when I got back to the hotel to get rid of it. I noticed the tables around us also left 90% of the complimentary \"elevated\" popcorn. Price: $140+ after tip, which fine, I don't care, we eat at places that cost that much on a pretty regular basis.When spending that kind of money, we expect the food to be exceptional, along with the service, which is why we go back. Nothing about this evening was good enough to remember 5 years from now, other than that it was a severe letdown."}, {"review_id": "qOV_5__x03FMn-3jjgCk0Q", "user_id": "7pM2nfvDmo7NTDTgxKdpHQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/5/2017", "text": "Located in downtown, parking is a little tricky.  Opted to come here for my last night in Minneapolis out a potential 3 restaurants with good reviews.

This was ok, though I don't particularly care for either. Bread with butter -- wish the bread had been served warm instead of cold...Scallops and oyster mushrooms were good. Scallop was seared and had a nice texture. The mushrooms, I felt were a little heavy with the oil, and I would've preferred something to balance it out with, like a slice of lemon or lemon juice for acidity. The bundino for dessert - this was good, but it was rich, very salty and sweet at the same time. I could take no more than 3 spoons before I had to take the rest to eat later the next morning and wash it down with some coffee.

I went recently to celebrate my wedding anniversary with my husband. I have not been here for a few years as I have been making my way around town tasting what Minneapolis & St. Paul chefs have to offer. But, my fond memories of this place brought me back here and they did not disappoint tonight! Service here is above and beyond professional and courteous. Our waiter was well versed in the different areas where our food was coming from. He explained flavors and dishes with enthusiasm and knowledge. Everything he recommended, I wanted to try! We like to dine slow and truly enjoy restaurants such as this and started out with the duck pate banh mi. The bread was fresh, the cilantro added a summer flavor to the sandwich and the duck was rich and creamy. It was served with fresh pickled cucumber that was tart but subtle in dill flavor. When speaking with the waiter, he let us know a Vietnamese chef in town often comes here for this sandwich and I have to say, it did not disappoint. Next was the sweetbreads. I am adventurous in the food I try and I had not tried sweet breads before. The texture is similar to fresh Uni. This dish was served with a micro salad, greens on top that had a hint of lemon. The sweetbreads were lightly battered and also took on a steamed pot sticker type exterior. They were covered in a mild tangy and peppery sauce. The combination of the cilantro and sweetbread sauce was perfect; packed with a summer excitement in my mouth. Overall, this was a great way to try sweetbreads for the first time and I enjoyed it. Now let's talk about my entrée. I went with the special this evening, the Pink Grouper from Hawaii. It was served over a plantain puree and a cream sauce. The fish was moist and tender, super flaky and had a wonderful crunch sear on the exterior. When you combined the fish with the plantain and sauce, it was heaven. My taste buds were firing on all cylinders! It was a mild white fish but prepared in this way, it turned into a delicate and exquisite main dish. When I was done, I wanted more. Overall, the experience you have here is what you would expect and the food is phenomenal. I can't wait to be back to try some more! Tips for this spot: If you want to eat at 7pm, make a reservation. It is a small and intricate restaurant and having a reservation will help to have a great experience. The menu also is seasonal and I was told by the waiter to come back between December - February to try their fish for the winter season because it is exquisite."}, {"review_id": "e7IkHpmN9WQTBohl87eGJw", "user_id": "bF33-76I5BbvPUgTt3BIGg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/26/2017", "text": "Had dinner with my bestfriend here.

Their noodles are also hand made and you can definitely taste the freshness and the chewiness.The butterscotch cream dessert we ordered was out of this world.
