Ah how good it is to be back near home again. The Shed is the studied essence of good breakfast in Las Cruces. Good to the core, straight to the point. We visited The Shed many years ago. Our wandering vacation this time took us through Saguaros and Joshua Trees for a week, then back to lovely NM for the second week. The Shed was just as we remembered it, and gave an apt reminder that NM is the *only* place to savor green chile. The Shed had me clicking my slippers like Dorothy, \"There's no place like home.\""}, {"review_id": "R0JG-Uh3PSDkQ1XmfdQBKA", "user_id": "QMv3G0xwD4u4me0_nWXTng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and Old Mesilla definitely delivered. I had never had green chili before but quickly loved it! I ordered the huevos rancheros breakfast with the green chili on top and it was excellent. I also had an apple mimosa which was very different than a typical organs juice mimosa but I liked it better! It was busy for a Friday morning but we quickly got a table outside and enjoyed our meal!"}, {"review_id": "oQWsghvqV9LOJmaPPtwG6w", "user_id": "vgoWdZj0vgkE_6-IujFIdA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "My favorite breakfast spot in Las Cruces is definitely Old Mesilla Pastry Cafe!

The service was really good and the food was fantastic. We each had twists on favorites; me opting for a green chile Benedict, and my wife choosing French toast made with cranberry-pecan bread. First, my Benedict was perfect in every way; eggs poached impeccably, delicious house-made toasted English muffin, plus the perfect amount of ham and Hollandaise. I absolutely loved it. But my wife loved her French toast even more. Made with house-made cranberry-pecan bread, it was sliced a bit thinner than you see with traditional brioche, but there were three full slices instead of two, so no problem there. The toast was so good that we actually wanted to buy a loaf, but being on the road, we had no way of saving it. The French toast was served with a nice assortment of very fresh fruit, which my wife enjoyed nearly as much as the toast. If you are ever in Las Cruces, or even anywhere near Las Cruces, you should stop in here for breakfast; I guarantee we will whenever we're back in the area."}, {"review_id": "5XBNQ8l0GhKVwVVshciBVg", "user_id": "Dk7-WQTdmPuP_mbKNXoOXg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Great place for brunch.

The first time, the service was great and so was the food. Second visit, the food was still great but the service was not so pleasant. It is very hit or miss with the servers when it comes to getting allergen information, so if you have food allergies or things you strictly avoid, this is a tough sell.

I always like trying unique and local places while traveling.I was surprised to see how many people were there at 1PM since they close at 2PM. They asked us if we wanted to eat inside or outside and we let them know whichever is fastest. Regretted that decision! Since I'm not used to the weather and it was HOT. I ordered breakfast and my colleagues ordered a pizza and ham and cheese sandwich. Overall the meals were good and the service was great but don't eat outside unless you plan to melt your face off."}, {"review_id": "yYb_Bfij1gfCDJSalBk9cA", "user_id": "38zdoad8swo76fKGUu7IYw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/24/2017", "text": "Great food, service and atmosphere!

We showed up around 9:30am to find a completely full parking lot (several of us had to park down the small side street) and already a bunch of people waiting outside to be seated. Sadly the restaurant doesn't take reservations and there were 16 of us all together so we were at the mercy of the friendly hostess. After about a 40 minute wait, which wasn't too bad all things considered, the staff was able to put four smaller tables side by side and we all were seated together!Sixteen different people, sixteen different food and drink orders, sixteen separate checks, and one waiter. He obviously was overworked but our coffees were always filled, along with our water, and none of our orders came out wrong!Some of my friends that were from the area said their pancakes are the special thing on the menu, with the oatmeal being the best. Sold! I ordered two oatmeal pancakes with strawberries and a side of fruit too. The pancakes were huge with lots of strawberry chunks mixed right into the batter! If I'd known how big they were going to be, I would have went with just one. Although, the leftover pancake was still great the next day after sitting in my hotel fridge overnight.The Shed holds down the breakfast/brunch scene in Las Cruces, and everyone told me it's super busy every weekend! Even though our party was huge and they were already so busy, the staff was all great and happy to accommodate our group!"}, {"review_id": "RnsqSXQpN3QfsXdvUtnVDQ", "user_id": "6nPHoaDyoDdDlQ_8xsrTJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "We just had a wonderful breakfast experience!

Who knew you could make a croissant even more delicious lol! The cinnamon pecan coffee is great with soft notes. The kiddos love the gigantic pancakes although this time they were a little raw in the middle, but usually they are perfect!
