First things first, go for the a la carte options. Pick your sushi/ sashimi plates and you will leave more than satisfied. Started off with a hot bowl of mushroom miso soup which wasn't anything to rave about but then dived into the best part of the meal. I had the salon belly, salmon sushi, salmon sashimi, large scallop, spicy tuna cut roll, and the sweet shrimp. The first bite of the salmon sashimi was so buttery and light! It was perfectly thinly sliced but not too thin. The large scallop was so soft and tender. I disliked the wasabi underneath but that was my bad for not telling them about my strong dislike for wasabi! Lastly the spicy tuna cut roll was so fresh and t was probably one of the best spicy tuna rolls ever. Thank you Sushi Gen for a life changing experience and you bet I will be back."}, {"review_id": "KKWYK4_8JObwOtlrGUQHng", "user_id": "KxEfEPhePqxjmE-IhqqVNg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I am a big fan of authentic Japanese sushi, but this place is a little bit disappointed me. Me and my friend drove all the way from Ventura to here just to have the sashimi. We got the sashimi deluxe plate, some of the sashimi looked (and tasted) like the mixed unwanted portion of the fish, and most of the row fish don't feel quite fresh, and a lot of fish fat wasn't removed from the sashimi, which were tasted greasy. I guess this place is located in the heart of DTLA that's why it's so popular, but I would recommend other sashimi places in Torrance or Malibu if you want a really good sashimi. Make sure to be on time if you make a reservation, they won't hold table for you for any reasons such as traffic issue or in advanced running late call."}, {"review_id": "qsSKqw-FOLIjG81hrXVrMA", "user_id": "hEuN03y0jBQY4epKq1xwAQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "The sashimi deluxe is my favorite!

Starting off with the uni, it was wonderfully delicious as it had a very creamy, buttery taste with a smooth texture. Next, I finally had the toro for the first time ever and it was a winner. Although it was not visually appealing, it made up for the appearance in taste. Literally melt in your mouth good with that tuna fat. Spanish mackerel along with flounder was also great. Needless to say, every item here that I've ordered was nothing short of excellent(insert Oprah meme where she hands out everything).With every star restaurant comes a hype and with that hype comes long lines. Yes, the hype is real, but if you're single and willing to sit at the bar, then there is little to no wait time(sometimes)!Whether you want to treat yourself out to a nice sushi meal here, impress a date, or have a business meeting, Sushi Gen would be at the top of my list for sushi in the heart of Little Tokyo.

Its a super authentic Japanese restaurant that specializes in sashimi and none of that Americanized sushi deep fried and stuffed with cream cheese. I came by recently for lunch on a Friday and waited about an hour. Though the wait was agonizing, I knew that my taste buds would soon be rewarded by delicious, thick cuts of fish. I would honestly wait 2 hours for this and not even complain, which is super rare for me as I get very hangry! Once we were seated, we all ordered the Sashimi Lunch Special ($19.50), which comes with a large platter of mixed sashimi and a bowl of rice, along with Miso soup, Agedashi tofu and pickled veggies. The sashimi selection includes, tuna, squid, albacore, cooked salmon, cooked eel, tuna poke, spicy salmon poke, and yellowtail. I've been eating here for 4 years, and Sushi Gen is so generous with the fish amounts! The fish is always super good quality and never tastes fishy. Today, my favorite was the tuna. It was so THICCCCC and buttery. My only gripe with the Sashimi Lunch Special is that it doesn't have salmon sashimi, which is my all-time fave :( But luckily, the quality and taste of everything else makes it up!Service here is always fast and courteous. Validated lot parking in front of the restaurants. I probably wouldn't come here for dinner, as prices are higher. But the lunch special is such a good deal! ~$20 for a satisfying, healthy meal of fresh sashimi. What more can you ask for?? Sushi Gen will always be my favorite sushi restaurant in all of LA."}, {"review_id": "cOGkcWpZRyujLMNI8xD0yw", "user_id": "k3jyM4rC2soqO62jalZdTQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Ordered sashimi deluxe, spicy tuna handroll, and unagi.

I had been here once before a couple years ago, but that was before I really started getting into authentic sushi. I remembered the sashimi being among the freshest I had ever had at that time, and I was curious to see how I would like it now, after my recent trip to Japan and binges at high-end sushi bars around Los Angeles. Unlike last time, this trip would be for the sushi bar only, ordering nigiri a la carte.We arrived sometime around 7:15-7:30ish to put our name down on the wait list. We were told the wait would be over an hour, but we were OK with that, since there is plenty to do and explore in the area. The wait took almost exactly an hour, which wasn't too bad. Sushi Gen is definitely one of the most popular sushi restaurants in Little Tokyo, and for good reason.We were seated at the bar, where our culinary experience quickly got started. I went all out on this meal, ordering amaebi (sweet shrimp), fatty tuna, sardine, kohada (gizzard shad), engawa, sea bream, scallop, half beak, hirame (flounder), baby squid, a tuna roll, and more. The selection here is top notch, including almost all of the usual favorites and more harder-to-find options. Shima aji and golden eye snapper would have been nice, but I cannot complain. Gizzard shad and sardine are great finds.All of the pieces I had here were great. The fish was all fresh, and the rice was cooked very well. The temperature and texture were on point, providing an excellent balance with the fish. The cuts of fish here are very generous in size, which is likely another reason why this place is so popular. If I had to choose a favorite piece, it'd have to go to the fatty tuna, which was extremely flavorful. The scallop, sea bream, and half beak were also stand outs.How does Sushi Gen stack up to its competition? Hama is still my favorite in Little Tokyo, but Gen is close. The selection at Sushi Gen is a little better, and the fish slices are bigger, but I like the nigiri sushi more at Hama. I like the rice at Hama more, and the fish tastes a little better over there (in my opinion). If you're looking for sashimi, however, Sushi Gen is probably your best option in the area. For now, Sushi Gen remains at second place in my top sushi bars in Little Tokyo. I'd highly recommend this restaurant to all."}, {"review_id": "jRM_FnBYWU7Jok8raui58A", "user_id": "rvrEdMtT6Pkjlzc-OR0G2g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Its located in a shopping center with bunch of other Japanese restaurants.

I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and we couldn't have been more satisfied. Everyone raves about the lunch special, but we couldn't make it out till dinner time. The line gets extremely long so be prepared to wait. I made a reservation a couple of weeks in advance to ensure we could get in without waiting. They have a small lot in front of the shop, but it fills up quickly. Luckily we got in right after the guard closed it saying that the lot was full. They charge $3 for 3 hours with validation, and other rates apply after that. So for Little Tokyo that is a great deal! We decided on the karaage, Sashimi Deluxe, and a side of rice for my boyfriend. The waitress told us that the deluxe was big enough for two people, but we decided to go all out and get one for each of us...For $40, you get an amazing amount of high quality sushi. There were at least five pieces of chu-toro, along with other fish like hamachi, toro, tai, squid, negitoro, spicy tuna, etc. If you are going here you have to get the sashimi. We were both stuffed, and I had enough for another meal at the end. The chu-toro was so buttery and delicious. One of the best I've eaten. The karaage was okay, but you get four pieces for $7 or $8. I would stick to sushi and sashimi while you're there. Overall it was an amazing experience. If you're smart, make a reservation for dinner in advance. You don't have to wait in the hour long line (although it's worth the wait if you cant)."}, {"review_id": "zdlxnTzuo22ZDHQAvII6Xg", "user_id": "nANcgXh1EnOUfeFFhZDn1Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "Wow!Went here for lunch and had their sashimi special. 19$ for a lot of fish.

No starters or apps, we just go straight for the sushi...and ALL was super fresh that nothing was needed in terms of sauce or spice. Friend washed it all down with saké. I will have vodka martini later.This restaurant is in a strip mall and is basic, simple not fancy very similar interior to the ones in Tokyo.The host stands behind a podium which posted house rules, 'no use of cell phones during dinner,'a good rule, as it's annoying as heck.I am a sushi novice, compared to some experienced sushi eaters who I witnessed eat fish parts: liver, kidney, without missing a beat. I'm not that adventurous or hungry for those anyways.

The lunch special here is pure robbery. So here's the deal...If you have a nice lunch break or happen to be free during the weekday, make an effort to get here early 30 minutes before the shop opens and wait patiently in line. When the doors open, walk-ins are allowed to fill up the restaurant. Proceed to order the sashimi lunch special, don't even bothered looking at the menu. You'll be treated to a nice spread of sashimi that includes chutoro, braised fish cheeks, yellowtail, bluefin tuna, spicy tuna, toro and scallion, grilled salmon, miso soup and a bowl of rice, all for under 20 dollars. It's a bargain in this area and the fish is of superb quality. Rumor is that they source their fish from the famous Tsukiji Market in Japan.Park in the lot and make sure to get your ticket validated.

But it's all worth it. Sushi Gen is the best sushi you can get in LA without paying Nobu prices. The quality of their fish sets the standard and at a very fair price. You can get a Sushi Deluxe for lunch for under $20! So the price has gone up over the years. It started around $15 then jumped to $17 and now it sits at $19.50. Still a great deal for 9pcs of assorted sushi and a cucumber and tuna roll (6pcs). And another $6 and you can get the combo along with a salmon skin salad and mozuku. You also get the sashimi lunch special for the same price, which comes with miso soup, tofu, and pickles. They also give you a bowl of rice.

Seeing the Yelp's pricing guide ($$$) made me a little nervous, but I still wanted to try out this highly hyped restaurant. Turned out, their lunch menu was such a bang in a buck! I got so much food for what I paid. I had the sashimi lunch set, which came with tofu, miso soup and side salad. The sashimi dish was huge. I got to sample different types of sashimi, tartar as well as cooked ones. There were some pieces that I didn't know, but everything was so delicious and fresh that I didnt bother asking what they were. The cut was generously thick. But my favorite was the braised, shredded fish (top left corner). It was perfectly seasoned and paired so well with japanese rice. (I know, there's rice bowl with this set too- this was the first time of me eating sashimi with rice). My friend got the salmon teriyaki+sashimi set, which he said was very delicious and generously portioned.  Considering the quality and quantity of the food Sushi Gen has to offer, I'd say that the wait was totally worth it! I was so stuffed after eating at Sushi Gen, and I only paid $19.50 for a decent Japanese lunch! Unbelievable!! Do yourself a favor and order the sashimi lunch set if you love eating raw fish like me!
