Even vegans! Plus meats include fresh local fish, duck and lamb. Such low prices your can afford to TIP BIG, and you'll want to cause the service is superb! Inside seating is romantic, cozy casual but can feel elegant as well. It has a hipster blend. FUZE, the name fits! Come after 4pm M-F and BRUNCH AT 11am Sat/Sun. Best HAPPY HOUR is Wine Wednesday from 4-6, but something special every after 3-6.... Don't forget FUZE... it is worth a visit, but be sure to communicate your tastes so you can get the most from the talented chef!!Fresh, always."}, {"review_id": "BATOmi5LDXLIcA8I8aJ2wA", "user_id": "OF0uPnAHsNNs9FBVX4gM2Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "I came here for brunch on a saturday. Restaurant was mostly empty except for us and another couple. I got the lamb sausage hash which was really good. I think the benedict options are a better way to go for next time. My boyfriend got the shrimp Benedict and it looked amazing! The lamb sausage was $15 and eggs Benedict was $18. Pretty pricey for the meal, I don't think it's worth the price. There are other restaurants that are more nice with better food for a cheaper price like craft and vine, whiskey bar, etc"}, {"review_id": "h9SSHkyAt5xJc1ZWMhck2g", "user_id": "crtKfRLezQLfmWpSYN8XuQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "Atmosphere is nice....

The service was great! I forget the woman's name but she was helpful and excited to talk about the specials and answering questions for us. I ordered their most popular dish, the lamb burger. It came medium and oh my goodness, this thing was so juicy! The caramelized beer onions played a big part in the flavor aspect. I substituted the pita chips for the pesto vegetable medley and I was hoping for more flavor in that but it just tasted like steamed veggies. The others I was with loved the chicken makhana and their steak. This place definitely isn't the cheapest, but the quality seems to be fantastic. I will definitely be coming here again to try the shrimp and grits!"}, {"review_id": "Y8qU4dpRXPeg7wAkcliXeg", "user_id": "Q54SJMm9-bzYChUU5j22kg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "We stopped in here prior to a concert at the Miller Theater.

They also have a pretty solid happy hour if you're able to get here early enough. Anyway, although they don't have as nearly as many taps as the Hive, but it's a decent amount and selection. I can't speak too much on the food, but it's seems a bit pricey. I've had a couple of their appetizers and it was worth it I think.

My best friend and I decided to give this gem a try and we made a great decision. Heather was our waitress and she was terrific. The chef deserves the highest rating possible. My friend changed her diet to vegan and this was the first restaurant to try. The chef did everything possible to make sure she was satisfied and Heather went above and beyond as well. The lamb burger was the best ever. I've had my eye on this burger and place for awhile and I'm so glad we gave this place a try....nothing disappointed us. We will definitely be back.

We're from Atlanta and were looking for a quick brunch spot before we headed home. We were welcomed by the bartender immediately and sat at a table by the front window. Our server was slammed, so service was a little slow, but he was super apologetic and communicative about their delays, so we really appreciated that. I ordered a mimosa, which was a very generous size (and pour) and only $5. In Atlanta it would have been $9 or $10 easily. My husband ordered a local beer, which he thought was slightly overpriced, but supporting local is important so we can't knock them for that. We ordered their vegan skillet to split, as my husband claimed he wasn't that hungry. It was delicious, absolutely. Very fresh, which was nice for a winter skillet, and super flavorful. The mushrooms? I die. Overall, we had a great experience and would probably return to try their dinner menu on our next trip to Augusta."}, {"review_id": "oIwybaMyK_K14n_X74H_0w", "user_id": "TM_RkaikcEtov6XqUo3LVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Ate here Sunday evening for the first time.

I tried the chef special Korean dish, which I will never be able to pronounce, out of my comfort zone for sure but I was not disappointed. My wife got the chicken mash. Both were delicious.

The detail of everything, from tables to walls to the food and drinks you decide to order, is seamless. When you see your flight arrive or that mushroom medley placed in front of you, the phone will come out for a picture (if it hasn't already). I have been here for a meal, for brunch, and just for a snack. Every time the team was spot on. Though it's not on the menu, they do have desserts. Homemade ice cream is usually a mainstay.*Insider's Tip-Brunch is served on Saturday AND Sunday (11 am-3 pm). The Pulled Pork Benedict is one of the best I have ever had. When it's offered, be sure to get the grits with duck fat.
