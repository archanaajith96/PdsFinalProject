LMBO! This was my first time visiting Maple Street Biscuit Company on a whim to meet up with a former client. Neither of us had a clue on what to expect during our visit here which turned out to be extraordinarily weird. They dislike the flow of service but, I enjoyed everything except the unstructured seating. We ended up sitting in the community dining area in which people looked at ya strange for doing so with our small party. Based on my experience alone, I enjoyed the sticky chicken biscuit and a cup of Maple Coffee. #Yum Also, I couldn't contain myself on the catch phrases they used to call out the orders. The staff was welcoming and amazing! I will definitely be returning for another adventure of the Maple Street Biscuit Company."}, {"review_id": "ttp1VolZWvshVA8uofp44g", "user_id": "AMrhEi4bLvaAcC2XggeBsg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "If you love biscuits, this is the place to be. Maple Street is a Jacksonville staple that everyone loves and recommends. I myself am not a biscuit fan being from Canada and never eating them growing up but I can't deny that this place serves tasty biscuits. My favorite is the sticky maple: fried chicken breast, bacon and maple syrup sandwiches between to flakey biscuits. The flavors compliment each other so well and blend perfectly with the textures and everything. I usually get the maple syrup on the side though to avoid the biscuit getting completely saturated and losing texture."}, {"review_id": "QcVolFrTUPhyTR_t-tS3Bw", "user_id": "1cy1Z2r1Umxq9zIqyghU3g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "The coffee was SO good!! This place was great. We got a good table outside and our order came out quick. They did run out of sweet tea but their sweet tea was amazing and worth the wait to get more. We started with the fried green tomatoes. They were diced very thick and the breading was just right. I had the chicken BLT biscuit and my guy had something a little different. We both enjoyed the breakfast."}, {"review_id": "HQYlxlZfRHMP7m0m0P__xA", "user_id": "I8jqJZOksHk1RwQ83c5YzQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Update: after posting my previous 4-Star review I was contacted by a rep for Maple Street who wanted to turn my experience around, even though I wasn't that upset by it. I still really appreciate that they wanted to make up for it and offered me a free meal. Today I came and reorders my favorite, the loaded goat, and it was perfect. All of the staff was  really friendly and accommodating. Love this place and will continue to come back. Usually Maple Street is on point, however today I ordered a Loaded Goat (chicken biscuit, goat cheese medallion, NO pepper jelly) and they gave me the one with the pepper jelly so I had to ask for a new one. They were really quick with the new biscuit so that was great. They were out of their Maple Tap coffee and half and half so I had to tell them to refill. The biscuit was pretty good (a little chewier than usual) and the mac n cheese was tasty although it needed some pepper. Not my favorite experience at MS but won't stop me from coming back. No pictures because I was too excited to eat and forgot."}, {"review_id": "6pHBLAN9WBKt2-lAzRoC8A", "user_id": "Rzv7Ajw1aFfpORd40Pr56Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I come here at least twice a week and always have a great experience.

They care, like they really care about you. I feel valued when I step into Maple Street. The sense of community at any location is intoxicating. I'll be honest, I don't frequent them as much as I used to. Although I celebrate the best of Jacksonville's dining scene, Maple Street doesn't align with my diet, since I only eat between certain hours of the day. But...When I splurge, it's here. It's tender fried chicken, it's coated in decadent sauces, and it's in between two succulent biscuits that'll make your head spin. Add their solid coffee selection to the mix, and you've earned your seat in heaven.Most importantly, the service is stellar. The team members are well trained, attentive and possess the ability to solve any customer's ridiculous requests (come here on a Saturday morning and bask in their professionalism). They do it right here.Jacksonville wouldn't be the same without them!"}, {"review_id": "SmQIWclY4SJhz1G2N4ZFIQ", "user_id": "N_mlUKdFuFN6Z6LiDWfTdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/15/2017", "text": "I don't like biscuits and gravy. I don't ever order fried chicken.The service was everything a consumer spending their money to be 'served' could hope for in counter service culture. I'll elaborate more a bit below. I was in town for my girlfriend's 40th birthday and this is where she wanted to go for breakfast on our last day in town before heading back to St. Louis. I was sure I would be able to find... something... anything. A few nights before my husband was helping me find some local places that I could eat at while I was out wandering around on my own while  the others were sleeping since I am a super early riser. He read up and recommended this place - I didn't share that with my friends - they just coincidentally wanted to go here as well.I ordered the squawking goat: goat cheese, pepper jelly, fried chicken, on a biscuit. I love goat cheese so its hard to get me to pass that up.The chicken was delightfully juicy and lightly breaded. The perfect size for a biscuit; the biscuit was perfectly baked and not at all crumbly (I hate it when biscuits I have had in the past just completely fall apart and all of its contents fall over)... the goat cheese squished down with the fried chicken and the pepper jelly was just...absolutely delicious and delightful. You can tell that someone put a serious amount of thought into how the various flavors would marry together and complement one another.Everyone at the table was extremely pleased with their meals... however, one person ordered something and was not sure that what he received was actually what he ordered... a little bit of confusion and disappointment, but the manager came out several times and asked us what we liked/loved and how our experience could be even better. Our friend said he was really confused by what he was served after reading the description (seems like they may have changed how they serve one of the items) and he said \"Anything you would like to make this experience better? I will go make you something fresh right now.\" We all kind of exchanged glances - THAT is service. THAT is how you do it right. He requested the potato scramble instead and he immediately brought out a hot fresh plate for him. I wish we lived closer, or had one of these in St. Louis, if  the food and the service philosophy is adopted across the board in this manner. Grabbed a shirt for my husband. Coffee was pretty darned tasty, too, and I am extremely picky about coffee. Would love to return the next time I am in Jacksonville."}, {"review_id": "5TjQhmc8DiH2gxDT5qtn_Q", "user_id": "qorf8_Y8t2ucwSycbcaKQA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Love this place.

Our friends from Atlanta love Maple Street. And even though we don't visit often ourselves, we always have a great experience when we do.Maple Street really knows how to elevate the traditional chicken biscuit with toppings like goat cheese, pepper jelly, thick cut dill pickles, and coleslaw. I have tried many options from the menu and have enjoyed all of them - Squawking Goat, The Reinhold, The Ralphie, and more.

Staff is super friendly. They usually have a question out on their chalk board that they ask you at the register to identify/call out your order. It makes the experience more fun/personable. The last times I've went the questions have been \"what was your first car?\" And \"what fictional character would be your best friend?\"The biscuits here are amazing. My favorite is the The Five and Dime. It's even better when you come with a big appetite. The place can get a bit crowded especially weekends for brunch. It's a shared seating set up like in a cafeteria, so a great chance to meet new people!

To start Sam Marco Island is gorgeous and this is located right off I-95 on an adorable street. We ordered -The Squawking Goat: Biscuit, Fried Chicken, Fried Goat Cheese pad, sweet/spicy pepper jelly. I've never before had 4 unique flavor come together in harmony like this. I heard Angels singing and harps-a-harpen.-The Bam: Waffles w/Asiago and Bacon in the batter, honey a Butter, real maple syrup (I added a little Serrano hot sauce to syrup, a must do)-Smokey Mt. Mac n Cheese w/cheez-it crust. Needed a little kick but still goodI grabbed to go a -Browned Butter, Salted, chocolate Cookie to go. My dining friend could not resist picking up a jar of the B2 Jelly, blackberry/blueberry jelly for $8. For some reason it took about 15 minutes to find a jar of it but we didn't mind. We chatted with the very friendly owner while we waited.

So I will admit I haven't really gotten a change to try alot on the menu because I'M STUCK on the chicken biscuits.I order and I recommend that u order  The Squaking Goat minus the sauce, with a side of Mac n cheese. The Squaking goat is a chicken biscuit with a fried goat cheese medallion on it. Sooooooo good, and definitely not your average chick n fil a And the Mac is soooooooo cheesy and topped with some cheddar crackers. OH WAIT ! I almost forgot, You gotta get a side of apple butter which is really some delicious apple......sauce.......stuff. if you eat this with the sandwich it brings it together.
