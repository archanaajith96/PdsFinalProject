Food overall is kind of bland. Coming from Texas, my family and I love tex-mex dearly. However, this place didn't match up in style or taste.ORDER- Chicken & steak fajitas: needs some real limes, NOT lemons for the fajitas. Tortillas look store-bought and not freshly made.- Refried beans + rice: Refried beans were tasty, but rice needs some oomph with spices or something.- Chimichanga: mini chimichangas were cute, but not enough filling to fried flour tortilla ratio. Prolly needs extra salsa to flavor it up.- Cheese enchiladas: winning dish for me was the cheese enchiladas. There was so much gooey cheese, and it was delish. - Guacamole + sauce condiments: guac needs some pizazz too, with lime and salt.I'll definitely need to visit and eat-in the restaurant next time though. From the reviews, it's an experience worth waiting for- live bands, fun crowd."}, {"review_id": "Eo5gPHQrHYsNRvJjRLntPw", "user_id": "gz39eyxQ6c-kwU3jwjqxXw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Group visit for lunch. this is a good place for group lunches or group dinners. we all good different dishes. everyone was satisfied with their food. the waiter was very nice and knowledgeable of the menu items. some had to ask a couple of times for missing items. so the waiter was not perfect but he was very good. the food was all hot. surprisingly their hamburger is amazing simply amazing. their beef patty is grilled like on a pit. the favor is awesome."}, {"review_id": "xLTnO-TliVQtMdBX0Z8i-g", "user_id": "Q1ZbMYWMdXlWPHpg24f9pw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/15/2017", "text": "Came here last Saturday night, man it was crowded and there was a long wait.  We waited by the bar until our table was ready.Parking is a nightmare and there's an overflow parking lot with a massive dip in the driveway that scrapes all the cars and must damage all the sedans that drive through it.  Luckily I had an SUV but still, that's ghetto.  This is the biggest gap I've ever seen so please beware cause I'm sure many a car has been damaged.Now onto the food.  Their complementary chips and salsa is excellent, with lots of kick.  I had one of their steak fajitas and it was very good.  My beef and chicken were cooked very well.  Veggies were also very good.  Service was pretty good.  There is a great atmosphere and the restaurant is very vibrant."}, {"review_id": "LqZYcr4UK8C8z9BFY77RGg", "user_id": "rMK1IsaZP9fUKckXyFt2fA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "We used to go to the Grill every now and then.  Excellent and fresh Margaritas on the rocks.  I have sugar on the rim instead of salt and they are delicious like that.Love their flank steak, the burritos and the tilapia, which is what they call the fish of the day, but it is always tilapia. It is very good though, for a tank raised fish.The main problem we had in the past was the parking lot, very uneven, slopes this way and that and you usually have to walk a long way to get to the restaurant.  Once inside you will find a noise level that is overwhelming, not sure why, the acoustics are not good.  We found it easier to talk when seated on the patio.We were thinking about going again recently, but have decided to leave it be from here on, because of the large brawl they had the other night.  I am sure too much drinking contributed to it, but when you have people leaping over tables to pummel people, well that can be dangerous.  They obviously do not monitor the amount people drink, apparently have no security and well, I surely do not want to get in the way of 15 and 20 people punching anyone around them.  That is scarey.  You see that in dives, not in nice dining places.  Guess that now ranks the Superior Bar and Grill as a dive.And worst of all, only one drunken 50 year old woman was arrested.  They should have hauled them all off.  Hope no innocent diners were injured or knocked to the ground.  Amazing that no one was stabbed with a steak knive or a fork.  Anything could have happened.Well guess the place has seen better days, but we will go elsewhere from here on out.  I would think most diner will do the same.  No one want to chance getting hurt by an unruly mob of drunks."}, {"review_id": "U9lwcHVBP0DzlpSHKO1LRg", "user_id": "E4BsVQnG5zetbwv2x8QIWg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "6/9/2017", "text": "COMPLACENTYes. This is the original Superior Grill which is just as packed on a random weekday as the superior Superior on St Charles Avenue but with a crucial difference: execution. In New Orleans the food may be expensive but prep is thoughtful and flawless. In Shreveport it's just plain sloppy.WHO SITS CRISPY TACOS ON SOGGY BEANS?I grew up eating at \"La Fonda on Main\" in San Antonio. Arguably the first high-end Tex Mex restaurant in the country. Every detail was observed: queso was pre-slathered on chips for absorption, rice and beans served on separate plates, corn tortillas in covered bins...the first one always relegated as topper. To me it's anathema that Superior serves crispy food atop seepy soggy sides, then muddles the presentation and charges exorbitantly.LOOK FOR THE ORIGINAL \"FISH HOUSE\" SIGNOld school. It's just to the right of the main entrance hidden by palms, in neon with jumping blue marlin!"}, {"review_id": "Q-RG6jhYLyhzBnFo564Aqg", "user_id": "3vUXodBAqGPZHysVI6MVkA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Amazing food!

I wasn't expecting Texas caliber food, but I was expecting much better than we got. We had to wait a while for a table, which isn't surprising. This place seems like it is always packed! It even took a while to find parking as the lot was completely filled! My dining companion was underwhelmed by the beer selection, especially that they did not have beer on tap. Once seated, you are given a massive bowl of restaurant style tortilla chips and a bottle of salsa. That salsa was the best part of the entire meal... We wound up ordered guacamole to accompany the chips, which was a letdown. Chunky, but flavorless. For our main dishes we opted for a large bowl of the tortilla soup, which left much to be desired in terms of taste. Aside from the general plainness of the soup, it also came out warm, which our server stated when he put the bowls down. My question... If you know it is going to on the cold side when serving, why both bringing it out? We obviously had to send back for re-heating, and it still came out at a less than desirable temperature. Although our waiter was pleasant and attentive, I just don't see coming back here unless I'm in the mood to stuff myself with basic bulk bag tortilla chips.
