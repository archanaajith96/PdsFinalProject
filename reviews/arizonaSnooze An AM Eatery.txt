The corned beef hash is my favorite thing it's what really keeps me coming back!

(Although they take your number and since it's in an outdoor shopping center you can pass time by shopping). I'm on a no caffeine and low salt diet. Unfortunately they do not have an online nutrition menu - really wish they did! However the waitress told me they could cook my hash browns without any salt which was great! Loved how crunchy it was! A little on the greasy side, but it didn't taste like it was drenched in it. I ordered a decaf iced vanilla latte, she said they only had decaf in hot but offered to put that over ice for me and it worked great! I would definitely come back again!"}, {"review_id": "euyGkdYfpDoYVSTOoxyQoA", "user_id": "iMZ5b31T7KMkWgiEZYLf6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "First impression : I'm about to die from starvation, why would I wait 50 minutes for breakfast!

I'll happily wake up earlier to beat the rush at Snooze for brunch, especially for their sweet potato pancakes and corned beef hash. What I love most about Snooze is their no hassle half-order policy; customers can pretty much request half orders on anything without worrying about ridiculously higher price points or messed up orders. I love salty and sweet combinations, but I can rarely have the best of both worlds unless I dine out with a friend (and they're willing to share). Not so at Snooze! My favorite combination thus far is a half-order of corned beef hash and a half order of pancakes (one huge pancake). Oh did I mention Snooze's pancakes are the only ones I've ever liked? I'm usually a religious French toast follower, but the pancakes here are the perfect balance between fluffy and cakey. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the syrup, which I find really sweet and on the watery side, but I feel like the pancakes don't even need the syrup so it's not a big deal to me.Service is always friendly and super laid back. Sometimes it takes a little bit of flagging during peak hours, but it's always greeted with a smile. I haven't had a bad dish at Snooze, and some of my favorites are:Pancakes pancakes pancakes:Snooze has a specialty pancake on rotation, and I've tried three different kinds so far and liked them all. Specials will be written at the front on a little blackboard, can be ordered within pancake flights, or can be ordered with a half order. Full orders are two huge pancakes, half order is one, and flights are three smaller-sized pancakes. So far my favorites have been chocolate chip, sweet potato, and a specialty one served with chocolate, almonds, and homemade creme anglaise. I've also enjoyed their plain, blueberry danish, and other specialty pancakes. The texture is really nice on these pancakes -- not too cakey, just be right amount of fluffy.French toast:There are two kinds of french toast: neat and OMG. I think they're rather similar, with the OMG coming with more mascarpone cheese stuffed in the middle while the neat version has a little dollop on top. I find the neat to be more balanced and less heavy, especially when topped with fresh fruit that have thus far been strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries. Corned beef hash:Seriously scrumptious corned beef hash with tender and flavorful corned beef, cohesive hash browns, and lovely flavoring. I substitute the toast out for more hash browns and mix it in. You can also ask for the hash browns to be extra crispy, although I like the original soft ones just fine.Breakfast pie:I was curious as to what this actually was, and it turned out to be a flaky puff pastry doused in gravy with eggs and hash browns. The puff pastry was stellar, especially speaking as an amateur baker who has fumbled many times at making puff pastry. It was light and airy, with a  perfect crunch on the edges and a buttery flakiness in the middle. The gravy didn't mask the texture of the pastry, and it complemented the overall dish well. I was surprised by how much I liked this dish, and I'd order it again on a cheat day.Benedicts:Snooze offers an interesting quinoa benedict with corn salsa. I thought the taste and textures were well thought out, but it took a little getting used to. The sharpness of the spice and creaminess of the egg and sauce complemented each other well. Regular eggs benedict was good as well, and eggs were poached perfectly each time.Miscellaneous items:I've had a mocha here a couple of times, and it wasn't bad, but I'd probably opt for the plain coffee.  Hot chocolate comes with cinnamon and a heaping mound of whipped cream. Chicken sausage can be request a la carte, and I appreciate the non-red meat option. Extra crispy hash browns are smooshed down into flattened discs instead of the regular cupped kind and fried until they're crunchy on the outside.Writing this review makes me hungry for Snooze, and chances are I'll be back this week."}, {"review_id": "95LbjwhMeG3JD29GGvBwRg", "user_id": "7C4B2Skmh4X9f8xJDo9O4w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "This place is busy! They said it was kinda slow but it was packed for a Monday. I can just imagine the weekends! So my first time here. When I came in they asked me how many people but it was just me & my lonely self. So they said I can get a table or booth but it would take about 15 mins. They also offered me a seat at the bar which I took cause there was seats available & you can choose where you want to sit. I sat down and they gave me a menu and they ask for your drink. I just got water. I ordered the 3 egg omelette & you can choose what you want inside. I chose sausage, bacon, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, red peppers (they don't have green), spinach, onions & avocado. It comes with hash browns & your choice of bread (toast). It was delicious! But I had no idea how much it would cost. It was about $20 ($19 & some change). It's about the same price I pay at ihop. Still trying to find a breakfast place where I don't have to pay for each ingredient. So far first watch is the winner but they don't have hash browns just potatoes. They also have a patio outside. They have alcohol."}, {"review_id": "6mOhcErJ7dQTVgFWvtrE5A", "user_id": "MMf0LhEk5tGa1LvN7zcDnA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Worth the WaitIt can be said that there's no shortage of breakfast eateries in the valley, however, Snooze an AM eatery stands out above the rest.  If you decide to visit Snooze you better be hungry, or plan on sharing your dish with someone else, because the portions are large and the food is delicious. This place was crowded and ee had to wait to be seated but it was worth the wait.I highly recommend the \"pancake flight\", three pancakes of your chosing. I went with the peanut butter pancake, pineapple upside down, and sweet potato pancakes. All the pancakes were delicious but the peanut butter will knock you out.

Visited in January and being the pancake addict that I am, pretty obvious what I ordered. Overall- Excellent presentation, great service and unique decor/clean restaurant.Flight w/ sweet potato, pancake of the day (board was not changed) and cinnamon I think. Food came quickly but I realized POTD was not what the board said at the front of the store. No worries tho because my server said I could swap for any other pancake on the menu. (Or the OMG F. Toast) Couldn't decide between the Nana's seasonal and the blueberry danish, so guess what? My server gave me both at no additional charge!! Score Turns out those were my favorites anyway! Amazing flavors. My least favorite was the recommended sweet potato but will be back to try them all!!Pancake addicts and aficionados must come and eat!

Staff here was great and the Ham Bennie was on point! On a side note, lately I've been over-tipping as little experiment. I took my average tip from 18-20% to 35-40% with a minimum of $10. This place wrapped up my 20 restaurant experiment. Interestingly, I haven't noticed any change in the mannerism of the servers. I don't know if they think I don't know how to tip or 35-40% just isn't enough to get their attention. Also, it's not in cash, so maybe the larger tip loses its' effectiveness when paid by amex. Respectfully, I'm curious at what point a server gives you the extra smile and 'thank you' as you walk out the door. Next experiment... I'm still going to pay by card, I do too many business meals and like the points. So I will zero out the credit card tip and tip out in cash. Minimum $10 and average of 40-50%. I will also try to round up to the nearest $10, $20 and $50 bill. I will let you know how it goes. And remember, food service is usually a pretty thankless job with some crummy hours. I encourage you to over tip and find the line between 'sucker' and making someone's day better. Besides, aren't smiles priceless?"}, {"review_id": "n2Or7yxjjX69bvBLf0KTBg", "user_id": "6hz5iTb9afLU6HeTK7QnpQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "These are probably some of the best pancakes I've ever had.

For one thing, the service is always good. This time Angela was our server and she was friendly, really helpful with my friend's gluten-free needs and forthcoming with what she liked on the menu and recommendations. This seems to be the norm for Snooze. We were seated promptly and decided on drinks. A Bankok Bloody Mary for me, consisting of MEll Vodka, Sriracha, Lime, Cilantro, Basil, Fish Sauce & House Bloody Mix. I added a nice slice of bacon which was just delicious. T. had something called a Cherry Pie cocktail which was tasty. Breakfast for me this time was the \"Sandwich I Am\", a soft pretzel roll filled with scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese and a sausage patty, served with a side of smoked cheddar hollandaise & house hash browns. Arriving at the table it frankly didn't look like a lot of food on the plate, but let me tell ya: it was more than enough. The hash browns are served as a round patty (from a mold, I suppose) and are moist with just the right amount of crispy. The sandwich is really tasty, especially on the pretzel bun. Snooze offers a pretty extensive list of breakfast selections, not the least of which are the pancakes. There's usually a \"pancake of the day\", one time being an apple-filled pancake which was, to this day I think, the best damned pancake I've tasted. I'm not often in the area of Camelback for breakfast (though there are a number of locations in the Phoenix area) but Snooze is high on my list of stops. The service is exemplary and the food is always above par."}, {"review_id": "fHR2UsBnJ8R5QMODFu1enw", "user_id": "XcCovlR56b_uaNKymmZ4RQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/11/2017", "text": "Everyone we spoke to on our trip recommended to try Snooze.

We went around 7 AM and luckily got one of the last few tables before it started getting super busy. Nicely decorated atmosphere with their own special decorations. Loved that they had cute modern round tables in the middle of the restaurant. Food wise, I ordered the Reuben sandwich. Yes crazy to have this for breakfast, but it was available; and Reuben sandwiches are my favorite! Definitely a great tasting sandwich, and it does come with a side salad if you prefer.
