They make everything in house: pizza dough, salad dressings, possibly bread? It can get really busy and food cab be slow. Food that is excellent: veggie wings!!, Soho salad, peach burger, and amped idahoan cheesesteak. Kids pepperoni pizza and Mac n cheese were very yummy and I didn't taste them but the Thai chicken tacos liked good too. Food that is okay: garlicky bread (swimming in oil), poutine taters, and balsamic chicken sandwich. None of it was terrible but certainly not as good."}, {"review_id": "st7xyS4m7GCoPUgdwKLxTA", "user_id": "KpOE-Z-gzJxwZqss8vO3Tg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "\"I feel like pizza tonight.\"  That was the first thing I heard when I came home from work today.  Ok, that's really not true, but in the conversation with DW this evening, the topic of pizza did come up.  A quick Yelp search showed that Gramercy Park was close to the top.  Since this place is only a couple of blocks from our home, it was a natural choice.The place was pretty busy when we got there, but there were some tables available so there was no wait.  Our server warned us that they were running a bit slow on cooking the pizza tonight, but that didn't stop us.  We were pizza focused!!!  We both ordered personal pizzas; Pepperoni for my wife, and Maui Wowwie for me.  We also ordered a salad, which ended up being excellent.  It was big, and there was bacon, cheese, and fresh greens in the salad.  I loved my bleu cheese dressing too.  Awesome salad.Our pizza's were great too.  We didn't have long to wait, despite the warning from our server.  My pizza was super hot when they served it. The crust was thin, and cooked nicely.  The sauce tasted great, and the ham, bacon, and pineapple were wonderful.  There was a distinct salty-and-slightly-spicy vibe happening with each bite, which made my tongue tingle a bit.  The personal size was perfect for me, as I ate half, and I'll have the other half for dinner tomorrow.  So the food was great, the service nice, so how can we not come back here again?  I'd certainly recommend it.--------------------Did you know that most people want at least three covers on their bed?That's just a blanket statement."}, {"review_id": "Cn4U-qj-5IvBYscVpgyvxA", "user_id": "NKnRn9wFLKH43JIcbrd0rw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "The lunch vibe is festive and relaxed.

BOTH times I've shown up only to be met with confused looks and somehow my Order didn't get made. I can't explain how frustrating it is to plan ahead when you only have an hour lunch break, call ahead of time, walk into restaurant, wait 10 minutes all for them to figure out-oh we never put her order in our system. And this freaking happened twice!!!!!I will never try this place again. Maybe the food is good- I will never know as my orders seem to go into a black hole around there.

The salad was the best thing there. I had the Peach and Chong pizza which is supposed to be one of their more popular pizzas. There was so little flavor, other than spicy. The toppings overpowered the crust by a mile. The poor crust didn't stand a chance. They had a very limited beer selection. The service was barely there.

So Tuesday I ordered the Peach & Chong for carryout and brought it back to my hotel to devour in private and it was phenomenal. I'm a creature of habit so once I find one thing that I like I'm likely to be a repeat offender. Wednesday I went back and ate at the bar while watching the Indians lose to the Yankees and had a simple pepperoni pizza which was also delicious. Problem is I saw 3 tables order the veggie wings and I didn't soooooo, Thursday night I ordered another takeout order again. Veggie wings and a pizza with veggies.

Sadly our main course came just five minutes later and was mediocre at best.

Still floored at how great the food is. The kids both have gotten pizza which is completely legit and have given us leftovers to take home (yes....the kids pizza). Last time, I had the Salmon BLT and I was beyond amazing. My husband had a spicy peach burger. Surprisingly full of flavor and in my top three burgers of ALL time. Today, we split the Vanilla Panzanella Salad (with salmon) and the pork belly. The salad was so good. The salmon that came on top was a FULL filet, perfectly cooked. The whole thing made me fall in love with salads again. The pork belly was on top of cheesy grits and had crispy spinach which I was so intrigued and impressed with. My kids even asked to eat the spinach because it was cool and delicious. The entire meal was awesome. Oh we also had the vegetarian wings (cauliflower) and it was worth buying again. Great flavor. Great texture. The service is on point. Not too distant. Not too clingy and extremely friendly. I think we have found our new favorite place in town! (Oh... I'll post pictures NEXT time we are here.

Nice view of the autumn leaves. Overland Road traffic. Groovy old rock & roll tunes. Old railstation style electric filament light bulbs. Televisions? I am never that interested in watching muted TV at a restaurant. Smooth beautiful wooden table tops in the dining room. And high barstools (so you can dangle your legs?) and high tables in the bar area. I didn't come here to order alcohol, I came to investigate why Gramercy Park Pizza and Grill was on a list of the best places to eat in the Treasure Valley..No, I don't seriously believe every written review. As my waiter said, or quoted (a cliche) - Different strokes for different folks..I did tip the waiter, not because of the food, but because he was pleasant, patient, he gesticulated to the rhythm of the music, I had my food on the table in less than 10 minutes after I ordered, and he offered some extras to try to enhance the flavor..Having lived in New York about 4 years, I always compare pizza I eat in Idaho to the pizza I remember at Italian pizzerias of New York. This Gramercy is more of a pricey eclectic restaurant. You can't watch the chef prepare your pizza, or sandwich. Most of the menu space is for foods other than pizza: appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pasta. I ordered the popular GPPG pizza..The first way I judge a pizza is by the appearance of the toppings. Captured by cheese is my preference. This GPPG was free range, meaning that the toppings sat on top of the cheese, and easily fell off my slice as I lifted it..Next thing is the consistency of the crust. The GPPG crust was not stiff enough to hold up to the weight of the other ingredients. .Most important to me is flavor. There was a peppery-looking dust on the bottom of the crust, but it hardly added any flavor. The sauce was average, the meat was larger chunks than I would expect on pizza, the gobs of cheese in my mouth kind of reminded me of a grilled cheese sandwich. Not too good, not too bad..Only distasteful thing I would say is the parking lot, designed to make people wonder where they should park."}, {"review_id": "kRwJMbrFQMBmEwzUtFKnbA", "user_id": "MIXnMsVzTiqvHUH3hEOVgA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2017", "text": "Windows, windows, and more windows.

It was one of our recommended restaurants for family when they came into town. For me, the restaurant was 5 stars before the remodel. Since then, I have been back 3 times and each time have left a little disappointed. The pizza is always great but the pastas have not been the same. It is almost as if there is a new cook that isn't as passionate about the outcome as the previous. The Gramercy bread bites are excellent though! I love to support local startups so I'm sure I'll be back and hopefully upping the stars back to their former glory!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/gramercy-park-pizza-and-grill-meridian?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
