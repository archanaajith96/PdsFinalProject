Please, please, please make Wrath Of Banh a permanent specialty pizza in your lineup. What do I need to do, tell a good joke, do a dance, beat somebody up for you?This is a pizza of the month they ran like a year ago and we got it, awesome. Saw they were running it this month and dinner was decided, got it again. The kimchi, the sauce, the right amount of cilantro, it is just a great pie. Go order one. Now. Well, not now, it's 2am and you'll look like an idiot, but order one later today.As for the more traditional pizzas, no complaints there either. Dough hits that right amount of chewy without being too chewy, toppings are all quality. Their Italian salad for a take out salad from a pizza place is also better than one would expect it to be and we add one to the order probably half the time.Does it cost more than Dominos or Pizza Hut, sure. It's worth it. There are a couple of good non-chain places in the area in my rotation, but I would say this is my favorite of them.I know you guys are reading. Wrath Of Banh. Permanent menu item. Do it. Now."}, {"review_id": "4QaaSqAcIXTPAyT0RAm_VA", "user_id": "4wKdbMl9XmCRw6Bu3G7xRg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "I am not sure where to start about how much I love this pizza place. First off, epic pizza combinations. I had a PIpeline calzone (ground sausage, mozzarella, feta, hot peppers and pineapple). It was very hard to decide from the 20 plus offerings (plus you can chose what you want). Calzone (marinara on the side) and 10\" pizza are the same price. The kids devoured a super cheese laden 12\", (there is one size larger, check their menu). My husband had 3 Pigs. Plenty of tasty pork based toppings, and they don't skimp on the cheese. Charming staff that let us hold up two of the three places to sit inside; there is more seating outside, and all the other patrons that came in got take out.So MY final  test of good calzone:  is the dough and fillings good enough to eat cold. And the answer in this case is YES. I just finished the second half (because they are huge, in a good way) 8 hours later."}, {"review_id": "VyJRLw12BpRL8SkNLMTwRw", "user_id": "BEEwA-hzBRPxMZi8ilRlMA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/14/2017", "text": "Super convenient since I work down the street.  Salads and pizzas and calzones, oh my!  They sell pizza by the slice which is perfect.  Usually, food comes pretty fast.I don't want to tell you this, but I do.  They sell brownies at the counter when you go inside.  THEY WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.  When I'm having a bad day, I go buy a brownie and have a better day."}, {"review_id": "ge9PT6LkO2ijSizb24drfg", "user_id": "utubOC6HjpgqN6Judy7wzQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/4/2017", "text": "Well, lo and behold! We had take out from Park Pizza last night and today they're Charleston Eater's number 3 of 12 essential pizza places in Charleston! In Hanahan for the evening, we thoroughly enjoyed their extremely unique, very tasty food. Park Circle sure has grown up!We had 3 small pizzas and one pizza roll between 4 people. Perfect amount of food (unless you're into leftovers!). Who would imagine that She Crab pizza would be so delicious!?! Check out their menu! What a great way to stand out among pizza places! Unimaginable combos on pizza, done very well. You can have your choice of add-ons to the pizza roll. We added onions and spinach. I'll be fantasizing about it forever. Maybe we should have gotten two. Just writing about it makes me want more."}, {"review_id": "QXIXSb37jmzzARlo04ZQcQ", "user_id": "3ycyux8899WSBAE-LPvMDg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/22/2017", "text": "When you're feeling a pizza, but you're not into getting ready to go out to eat but you also want something other than the regular delivery places, check out Park Pizza. They do have a few seats, but it's more a grab and go place. I think they deliver near N. Chas, but confirm that. We ordered while we were on the way and it was great timing. We got the Kurt Brussels (all pizza names are hilarious) and cheesy bread. Everything was very good! They left it so that we had to bake it another 5-10 minutes when we got home and that was perfect. It's definitely more gourmet than regular delivery, but it's also a little pricier. Worth it!"}, {"review_id": "aPKWZqWoJzXmiysnwk0GKg", "user_id": "RuYNhh8ClsxaRwIz7P0cyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "This is probably the best pizza in Charleston.

They offer a wide variety of pizzas with a variety of creative and some non traditional toppings. They offer small salads as well as calzones, cookies and brownies. The pizza crust is always very crisp as if it is fresh from the oven and during lunch you can purchase individual slices, it's best to call ahead as they take about 15 minutes to prepare.

That and people who use the word literally for literally everything. (gah when did that start...)I want to blow up both of those things: People who every other word out of their mouth is the word LITERALLY and bad pizza joints. That would be my contribution to the world in which everyone would thank me.The good news is that Park Pizza has neither one of the above problems--otherwise it would have been on the top of my hit list. In a very unassuming little charcoal grey/bluish building near the end of the stretch, closing in on the flashing red lights is Park Pizza. It is now within skipping distance for me (yes!) so I checked it out this past weekend. The menu is so diverse. The combinations are creative, but not so much so that you wonder who the hell would want THAT on pizza. Their combinations make you cock your eyebrow in wonder, thinking, \"damn, that sounds good--I want to try it!\". The problem is there are so many of these moments and you end up not knowing what to get!I ended up trying to Steeler, subbing the pork sausage for turkey. A 12in pie was around $14 with tax. Now at first that sounded a little pricey to me, but considering the number of toppings it has, if you were to get this same pie elsewhere (not that they would even have the many toppings this place has) it probably would end up being more having to pay for each topping individually. The pizza was piping hot when I picked it up. Caramelized onions, sweet/spicy peppers (cant remember what they are called but man did they add the perfect heat to this pizza), the mounds of cheese...ah man, this pizza was pretty great. They have so many topping options! Just a plethora of possible pizza deliciousness. Ill have fun creating some fun little combinations. Simple, clean, they offer delivery--Park Pizza is a pretty cool spot. One I will definitely hit up when in search of pizza in the future. I believe most do takeout, as they only have two tables inside, and a handful of tables outside--literally."}, {"review_id": "bAp774Af0_tNHE8dxuqC3g", "user_id": "5K1b0FMLLufFKY0YLwvT5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/26/2016", "text": "Pretty impressive tiny pizza joint. As for the pizza eaters goes, the critics are always bringing up crust, so I'll start with that I enjoy a hearty crust. And with the amount of transplants in Charleston (present company included), this might be a deal-breaker, but if your thing is thin crust, then get that elsewhere and stay hungry. I'll eat here and feel like I ate something.The place is small and they prepare the pizza almost in front of you,--which doesn't leave much room for seating. A few bar stools and two indoor tables (additional sidewalk tables for good weather). A fancy date spot this isn't. Maybe a regular one if you get a seat, but better yet, take it to-go. They are pretty heavy on topping so you probably should not order double/extra unless you know what you're doing. My friend likes cheese -- who doesn't ? -- ordered extra cheese, they took it as a 'challenge accepted' and it got messy...I've also been here prior and had their lunch slice/salad/drink special, which is a good deal. If you do, make sure you get the creamy cucumber wasabi dressing. It's not as spicy as it sounds and a good change of pace. In summary: good crust pizza, call ahead and to-go like the locals do."}, {"review_id": "cxy924fmSqKsqUBsMbuwug", "user_id": "85kBr-UqD-jP0429YVfIKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/31/2017", "text": "Our family LOVES this delivery pizza shop.
