Another dish made of chicken broth rice and cajun crawfish ($17) was quite tasty but meager in supply. The flourless chocolate cake was still half frozen so it took a while to dig in at the risk of breaking the forks.Despite all the food sadness my mate and I experienced, the friendly staff (who had her thumbs at another patron's salad bowl upon serving) was very sweet and accomodating. Coming back to this place is still a consideration when patio seating is available. The romantic ambiance alone is well worth the revisit."}, {"review_id": "OiFArGSK8bou8npXwPUejg", "user_id": "WoKCLSctS7G2547xKcED-Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/26/2017", "text": "Mmmm....bone marrow.  Oh, and they have beer here, too.  I have friends who got married at Two Brothers Roundhouse and they never let me forget that I couldn't make it to their wedding.  Now I understand why.  What a great venue!  There's a classier feel than your typical brewery with the restaurant interior and the menu.  But then they still have their swag, beer to go and even a coffee bar. I tried a couple beers but the highlight for me was the peppermint bark porter I had for dessert.  Is it weird that I think the food overshadowed the beer?  Between the bone marrow appetizer and short rib sandwich I had, I don't think I even needed the beer.  (I can't believe I just typed those words.)I did walk away with a bomber of the coffee stout.  And a pretty sweet t-shirt that was on sale.  All in all, a good afternoon."}, {"review_id": "C7rTQ1PyLLba9lplBA9A0w", "user_id": "jC4koDH_gCtbh6dHJmMpjQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "It a huge place with plenty of comfortable seating and good food selections.

I don't believe they were quite a 4 (as you'll read why), but they do deserve 3.5.-Parking is pretty horrendous, and you might get T-boned at any given intersection in that parking lot. It's not their fault, just something to very carefully watch out for!-We were very nicely greeted upon entering, and given a table outside close to the fireplace to keep warm as the night cooled down. Surprisingly at 7pm on a Friday, tha place wasn't busy at all and lots of seating was available.-The band wasn't starting until 9pm, so it would be nice to have some sort of outdoor music during the times when live music isn't being played.-We were trying LOTS of beer samples. Half the party tried a sample of every single beer (minus Pinball). The other half was trying a sample of all the seasonal beers (they were out of only one and replaced it with another). We asked for the samples to be brought out 3-4 at a time so that they wouldn't get warm (hello, sitting next to the fire). Our server said that wasn't a problem. Next thing we know, here come 3 servers bringing us trays of beer and loading them all up onto our table. Our server said \"Yeah, I brought them all at once just because it's easier this way\". Excuse me?! We're not paying all that money to have samples of beer sit out, loose their carbonation, and get warm. And the server totally dismissed it, because it was \"easier\" for him on a night that wasn't busy. OKAY - his tip *was* going to be much better...-My beer cocktail was very yummy. And it's nice to have some drinks available for those of us who aren't huge beer people. That made me really happy. I wish I could have tried the cinnamon root beer soda.-We ordered the chimicchuri nachos with steak. The steak was a little difficult to find, but the nachos tasted really good overall!! For $15 though, they better be the best nachos I've ever had, and they weren't at the top.-We got a salted caramel cookie on our way out which was very buttery, crumbly, and the caramel still chewy inside. :) Overall we had a nice visit here with friends. I just wish the beer situation had been handled how we asked. The guys had to drink warm beers and couldn't enjoy them how they were meant to be enjoyed. I would also eat elsewhere at a cheaper place prior to coming here."}, {"review_id": "IMYg1R_BDsR0d-I8bJd7QQ", "user_id": "FvfPMvfcW5M5Be4YWl8OqA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/7/2017", "text": "Date of my visit: 4-July-2017Time of my visit: DinnerTotal bill (with tax, but not including tip):  $32.50We usually come here every 4th of July, kind of a tradition.I like this joint for multiple reasons, including their food.  Today, we decided not to indulge in their beer selection or hard liquor, but rather just eat.I ordered Chimi-Turkey Sandwich with a Side Salad and Cup of Red Pepper Bisque Soup.  My girlfriend ordered Brewer's Reuben with Fries.My salad and soup came out first.  I was hoping that Red Pepper Bisque Soup would be similar to tomato basil soup, but, unfortunately, it was not.  It was still decent.  Salad was your typical mix of veggies, they did taste fresh.Our sandwichs came out last.  My girlfriend said she enjoyed her Reuben with fries.  My Chimi-Turkey Sandwich was actually pretty good!  The bacon was nicely cooked, not to the point where it was hard, but it was not saggy either, that perfect middle ground.  There was plenty of turkey on the sandwich as well and it tasted fresh.Overall a sold B+ experience.  Definitely worth coming here for food and beer!"}, {"review_id": "SJ5VCvrMV1mg3MFBIHPong", "user_id": "717WbWR760j3CwMsEbEwmQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/11/2017", "text": "Love this venue for the variety of drinking & eating options.

They have great beers, good food, and entertainment often. It's a huge venue with a restaurant, three bars, a coffee lounge, and multiple party rooms. You'll often see weddings and private parties taking place here.Last time I was in we can to see a friend's band (Joker's Rival - they're awesome!). Originally we called ahead to reserve a table in their restaurant area, but they said they were no longer taking reservations for the night. We decided to head there about 6 pm anyway to see if we could get a seat. We were told it would be about 30 minutes when we got there, so we grabbed a spot up at the bar, but then my dad decided to check the back bar room for seating and they told us we could grab a seat and order food right away. Pretty confusing situation and their communication was obviously lacking, but it ended up working out well. We were able to get a table for eight right away in the room where the band would be playing. Our server was great and took our orders immediately.I tried their version of a long island, but it was way too tart for me. I think it was just from the flavor of the beer this cocktail is mixed with. I ended up switching drinks with my mom and drank her beer. I then stuck with drinking Wobble all night, because that's my fave! They have a ton of awesome items on their menu. Our table started with a couple orders of the Beer Brezen which are three delicious Domaine Dupage organic pretzels, Cane and Ebel stone ground mustard, and Sidekick beer cheese sauce ($8). We got an order of their chips and dip too which were house-cut potatoes with their Sidekick beer cheese sauce and spicy ranch dip ($7). Both were really good appetizer options, but I preferred the pretzels. A must try!My mom and I decided to split a few small plates for dinner. Our server was helpful in making suggestions and letting us know which small plates were bigger than others so we could decide how much to order for two people. We went with the beer mussels ($12), short rib risotto ($10), and pork belly tacos ($7).The steamed mussels were amazing (and a whole pound btw!). The Ebel's Weiss broth was simply delicious and I'm really glad it came with two large pieces of bread for dipping. Short rib risotto was pretty good too, but not worth $10 in my opinion. Pork belly tacos were delicious and perfect for splitting between two people.Overall this is a great venue and if you like Two Brothers beer you'll want to come hang out here. Everyone who works here really has an awesome attitude and provides great customer service. The Roundhouse is always hosting different bands, comedians, etc. so it's sure to be a good time!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/two-brothers-roundhouse-aurora?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
