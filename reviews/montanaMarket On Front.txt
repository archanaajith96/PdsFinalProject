The coffee is not bad either. They are also located near lots of parking options. Only complaint is it gets really really crowded and fast during the morning rush. They need more seating more baristas, and should separate the checkout from the barista station.  You can barely find a spot to stand while you wait for your order."}, {"review_id": "eCtctqIg-cGJ0sBjXkkB7w", "user_id": "NsfWccYkH7WEL1zcD9eJ3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "Great place.

Healthy, fresh, delicious food meets little health-conscious market. It's equally great for grab-and-go options and a filling sit-down meal.I had the Strawberry Matcha iced, which was insanely delicious. To eat, I had the Crispy Cobb and my husband had the Reuben.My cobb salad was crazy fresh. I really loved the thick avocado-herb dressing that accompanied it. I dug their take on a cobb salad, with unusual components such as roasted corn, radishes, and apples. (But don't worry, there was still bacon.)My husband loved his Reuben and he's a Reuben snob. I tried it, and it was amazing. And I don't even really care for reubens. Theirs had a horseradish aioli and apple-kraut slaw and was served on perfectly grilled rye bread.The atmosphere inside is also very inviting. Clean, simple, but cozy. Loved the fresh flowers, fun window art, and large open windows for people-watching!"}, {"review_id": "PXiof4MzdCS03VnNU6cGaA", "user_id": "vBS9JGjvmwlLQVTgvPsJlQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "I really love their sandwiches.

You've found it. Not only is the food delicious, but the service is fantastic. My workplace ordered about 30 breakfast items, and when our coworker returned there was one item missing. One call later and the manager drove clear across town in the snow to deliver a single burrito bowl! I've loved the food since they opened, but that kind of service will definitely keep me coming back. Also, their sandwiches are spectacular. Worth a visit for sure! Grab some food and walk one block to eat it next to the river.

We ordered the baguette with jam, waited 15 minutes, and when they brought it out, it was served with some hot chili pepper berry jam.  Now, I wouldn't have cared,except for this was for a child, and the last time we were here, they provided plain strawberry jam. I just spread the jam on without thinking to myself, \"Hmmm...maybe there's cayenne pepper in this jam...\" A regular fruit jam makes sense, especially since the cashiers do not ask you what type of jam you want, nor does the menu make any offerings.You do not give ANYBODY spicy jam without asking first. Now, I don't even care about the spicy jam because I can just have it switched out with something else. What prompted me to write this review is that when I went to exchange the jam, the cook apologized, and then said that they were trying to get rid of old jam, so they were giving it out to everybody.Are you serious? If you have old product, you don't give it to your customers. Take the loss. After we were given the strawberry jam, the cook was definitely right about using old jam...it was a weird consistency and hardly spreadable. We were very disappointed because this place is usually very nice."}, {"review_id": "l96IeBXOPsT6Z8cWLZjSvA", "user_id": "lxXMzj25-hb5VtaYwnbXgA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "Best breakfast sandwich in a long time.    Smokey pig on croissant!  Delicious and gooey!  Have napkins handy!"}, {"review_id": "8LaCOqsIo2HVLZFaxPGw4w", "user_id": "Z-nEfqW79Ny2kados0nE7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/14/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Ponce de Leon was wrong, the Fountain of Youth isn't in Florida, it's in Missoula Montana at Market on Front.Seriously, want to live to be 100? Order the quinoa and root vegetable salad, which is not only delicious but has veggies, nuts, lots of fresh spinach and an amazing zingy mustard dressing. Of course you can balance this with one of several breakfast sandwiches such as the BLT which is loaded with eggs, avocado and delicious, lean crispy bacon that tastes home cured, and finished with a touch of goat cheese and a hint of garlic. Don't worry, this place isn't a one trick pony, there's plenty to choose from which is why we went for breakfast and lunch in the same day. Last but not least, for those who care, the bathrooms are spotless.

If you're staying at the hotel that's within walking distance, you are in quite literally the most perfect location in Missoula. The coffee here, first off, is fantastic. My cappuccino was on point, and I am a complete espresso snob. Second, I love that they have a variety of organic options to grab & go if you're in a rush--- as a traveler, I need lots of granola bar options and this place has PLENTY! Lots of seating if you want a minute to relax before you head out, lots of food choices if you're hungry. I will definitely be back when I have more time to examine this spot closely. Service was excellent, I was in & out in less than 5 minutes. Overall, if you're looking for a quick coffee and some breakfast before you head out for your day, this is where to go. What a pleasant surprise in Missoula."}, {"review_id": "dAWkiCQO23hXvnp919g6GQ", "user_id": "Qh-zIT3jvPm-h5SOwt_t_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "A very nice place to stop by.
