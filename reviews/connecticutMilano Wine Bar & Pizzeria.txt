We found out about this place thru a group we belong to and decided to try it and we were very impressed by the quality and flavor of the vegan pizzas. We would highly recommend this place to any other vegans and non-vegans."}, {"review_id": "0hWigAbtAScIF7SE9gJZ2Q", "user_id": "_3MS5a4Baa9i3DqYVgioZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "We decided to dine here before the Vienna boys choir concert at the Klein auditorium. My friend had eaten here once before and enjoyed it. We started out with three appetizers, fried calamari, eggplant Rollatini, and meatball crostini. All the appetizers were good but the eggplant and the crostini could've been hotter. The owner came over and explain to us what happened and said he would try to fix it in the future. We chose the mashed potato pizza with bacon. It was excellent! I would definitely go back and try this place in the future."}, {"review_id": "GHeYoHhWvYUa7kOz7fwS0g", "user_id": "Y2jB1p_M3mJwFkWaBfYzlA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Great place, nice and cozy.

This was my first time ordering here but I had heard that the food was really good. I ordered the chicken parmigiana entree and was surprised that it didn't come with a side salad for the price. My food was ready when I picked it up but I noticed that there wasn't any bread in the bag. I asked the woman who was cashing me out and she said that they would give me bread. The bread was on a table behind her and she grabbed a loaf and handed it to the cook. I had an issue with that. I believe she was the bartender and was dealing with cash and handing the bread with her bare hands. Other than than that the food was good and they gave large portions."}, {"review_id": "uGvqLKuZ3670HB9waar_1g", "user_id": "AyzYIzub-bx4wxozKoK4DQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "They have a VEGAN pizza option!

The family enjoyed a buffalo chicken pizza and the owner, Fred, made me what had to be the best gluten-free pizza I've ever had. Fresh mozzarella and delicious sauce and a crispy crust. Unlike many restauranteurs Fred truly cared what we thought of his food. As a native NYerI know realNYC pizza. Milano's is the real deal.

The owners gave the old Two Boots space a fresh, new look. Before I visited, I had heard that it was going to be a pizza place. Milano does serve pizza, but it is definitely several steps above a regular pizza spot. That being said, we enjoyed a wonderful clams casino pizza on our first visit. Actually my cousin ordered the pizza, but it was so good, we all tried to get some.  Before that we started with the mozzarella triangles appetizer, which was artfully presented with tomatoes, avocados, and drizzled with balsamic vinegar. The presentation told us there were some skilled hands in the kitchen. The eggplant rollatini was excellent with a good-sized serving cooked to perfection.  I had the salmon piccata on two visits and it was another dish that said this was not just a pizza place, this is an Italian restaurant.  On top of that, Milano also offers brunch on the weekend, which is great since there aren't too many brunch options nearby. I met a friend on a recent Saturday and we selected the bottomless drinks option: a mimosa and a bloody Mary.  I had the New Orleans omelette and my friend had the pulled pork Benedict.  I enjoyed the omelette and the home fries were nice and crispy (so much better than the greasy version some places serve). My friend reported that the pulled pork was nice change from the usual Benedict, but said he would preferred a bit more Hollandaise.  Of course, we took full advantage of the bottomless drinks.  The first time we ate at Milano, it was only open for a few days, but you wouldn't know it from how smoothly came out. The dishes seemed to come from an experienced kitchen. Even so, the owners and staff at Milano are clearly interested in feedback and ensuring their guests are happy. I spoke with Nick and Fred on my visits and they were very open to suggestions.  If you're reading this and haven't been to downtown Bridgeport, I offer another reason to head down and check out Milano or one of the other dining options there. There are some wonderful people working hard to bring you great food!"}, {"review_id": "hJnwcdMtidi9AM-QigQHzA", "user_id": "UwWJzUZJSvyrjFl4y084EQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "Love going here, great prices and the staff is very friendly and attentive.

I was somewhat of a regular at Two Boots, the restaurant that used to be at this location and was sad to see it go. The space has a whole new vibe. It's much more subdued. It has been repainted, cleaned up and the menu has more traditional options. I stopped in on an early Friday evening and there were only people at the bar. My fiance and I were seated in a booth. Our waiter was very kind and we were checked on by multiple staff members. I ordered a small buffalo chicken pizza that could have easily been split between two people. If you're in the downtown Bridgeport area and looking for good pizza, this is the place."}, {"review_id": "rQcwu7VLEkHqq5g9s4n0Tg", "user_id": "W6O4dE-IlM5STE0b5jrxww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/10/2017", "text": "It's rare to find a place like Milano's. Not only is the food great, but the service makes the experience awesome. My favorite is the Chicken Pesto Pizza, but a close runner up is the Mashed Potato Pizza. Both are always cooked to perfection. In addition, the location of the restaurant is just what this city needs. It's a great family spot, friend spot, or even a place to grab a beer and watch a game. **Also! The Gluten-Free crust is the best I've ever had. Did I mention their sauce is vegan? Great options at this place. You have to check it out."}, {"review_id": "wXtrbz68rN48EYdDenHtCA", "user_id": "lQ2GuycyVh2ThO1juzWmeA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/11/2017", "text": "Delicious eats!

The waitress was obviously new. Of course it's hard to start out and we all make mistakes but she made every possible mistake you could. Maybe in these cases it would be smart to have the server shadow someone else or just be in charge of a few tables. So I get there and get seated, it takes like fifteen minutes for anyone to do anything. Finally, the bartender asks if I'd been helped, I said no and ordered an iced tea. That took another 15 minutes. Then finally, the waitress took my order and seemed unfamiliar with what Tuscan chicken was. It took another 20+ minutes for the food to come out, with the \"chef\" coming out to ask if I wanted the appetizer and entree together. Um, no. It took another ridiculous amount of time to get my check too. After I'd been done 20 minutes, I again asked the bartender and it still took another 10 minutes. The waitress brought me the check without the check envelope, then asked if I wanted to keep the Customer copy of the receipt.As for the food: I would normally have a glass of wine with my chicken but since no wine list was presented to me, I just got tea.  Of course, the tea came sweetened, my bad, I guess but a good waiter/waitress will let you know. So the shrimp casino was pretty good, mainly because it is hard to mess up shrimp with bacon and butter. The Tuscan Chicken was basically just drizzles of balsamic vinegar on chicken and what seemed like Bird's Eye vegetables. Undersalted and boring and just edible. I never saw the waitress to ask for salt. When I finally got my check, I was so glad to get out of there. I guess they make extraordinary pizzas to get the glowing reviews they do but I found it pretty horrible."}, {"review_id": "O4GYqpm9b7GwuwlmHYOjoQ", "user_id": "0eG8c7mHGEWmOgOK1bmsWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/21/2016", "text": "I loved this place!
