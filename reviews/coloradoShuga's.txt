I had the Cuban Mojo and my friend had the spicy Spanish soup. I could only snag one scoop of his before it was gone and it was great. Just the right amount of spice, too, to remind you it's there without overwhelming you or other ingredients.My Cuban was aweessome. I mean it's not \"traditional\" but the meats were well seasoned and cooked great and the bread was the star (important in a sammich I'd say). It was just crunchy enough and had that great toasted flavor that you get right as it's toasted and right before it's burnt. If I'm through here again and looking for a sure thing then I'll be back. Oh and the prices are ok, slightly expensive including cocktails but not terrible. Also staff was super friendly and service quick!"}, {"review_id": "WSw_PCI83oD2TxtQUOw1MQ", "user_id": "LUFAyQVnzpBJmvZEgtBUiA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Great Flavor * Small Quantity for Price Best Ramen in Colorado Springs (pretty much only decent ramen in Colorado Springs) This is a To-Go order review! Came in to pick up the ramen and staff was friendly and food was ready. Small portion for the price you pay. If you're from California, New York or cities like Portland, Austin, Chicago you're used to paying less for more.

This place is simply adorable with awesome art deco decorations and a sassy vibe. Expect solid sandwiches, soups, and salads. I got the ramen and it was good. Not the best ramen I've had, but decent. They were out of pork so they subbed in chicken for me, which I may have even preferred. It was cold out so the warm bowl of soup hit the spot. My husband liked his pesto and goat cheese sandwich.Service was attentive and friendly. Would recommend as a casual spot to catch a meal in the area."}, {"review_id": "SDHHkQm5zwLyNri9P36G0g", "user_id": "Rr6Fub4mQizSolmPY_TH_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "This might be my new favorite spot to eat in the springs. I came here last week with my mom for lunch and we both had a great time here. First of all we came at 1 PM on a Saturday and this place was happening. We lucked out with two spots at the bar but we saw a line forming after we were seated.The interior has a lot of charm with fun old signs up and a great bar. I also love that this location used to be a residential home. The service could be a little slow at times but it was understandable with how busy they were.Ok now to the food. Everything we had was delicious. My mom got the tray which had a little bit of everything on it. I got the two bruschettas and the soup of the day which was a potato bacon soup. Everything had great flavor and hit the spot. I honestly can't wait to come back."}, {"review_id": "gHapN8sdv918DlQwZGzd0w", "user_id": "zMaJaQH_j5xPHwgNuGvp8A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Had a great lunch here yesterday! It was around 12:30 on a Saturday and we had 8 people, and still only a 15min wait which was much less than I expected. That said, they were understaffed I think because we didn't see our server for a while after seating. Though she was perfectly sweet and helpful once she was available. I had 1 bruschetta and the Spicy Shrimp Soup. The soup was FANTASTIC! Insanely tasty with just the right amount of spice. The Bacon and tomato bruschetta was good but the cream spread had a funny taste I couldn't get over. But still the bacon was this thick delicious slice of goodness, tomato was perfect and the bread was terrific. I also had the beet cocktail which may have been my favorite part of lunch. Overall I really liked this place! A little pricey for lunch and lunch cocktails, but I could tell they put time in all their menu items."}, {"review_id": "NhP-UIFIVB8v8GKubRCIAA", "user_id": "gX_UqVIT1Ut7r1XUj1y9ng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Loooooooved this place! Super hipster vibes with delicious food.We ate outback in the yard. I ordered a mojito - yummy. For my meal I had the spicy shrimp soup and salad. The salad was fresh and came with amazing chunks of bacon! The soup was delicious. Very light in terms of it being on the watery side, but very flavorful. I liked how it came with two pieces of toast smeared with goat cheese, yum yum."}, {"review_id": "s4z4B5WgRtn_8K-vx8uPhw", "user_id": "o-D5QNL4FkURKKaZLJdSEw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Local funky...my favorite listing on their menu: crap beer $2.00.The offerings are eclectic and varied to offer something exciting to eat for everyone.

We checked out the menu and let the waiter make the choice for us, we both were happily delighted and full. The fish soup was amazing, it does have a bit of a spicy kick on the back but totally good. We saw lots of what I would call a lunch box or platter lunch - with a cup of soup, bruschetta, salad and slice of cake, I'll get this next time!You could tell the locals filled up the tables, which is always a great sign. It was also totally packed when we went for a late (1:30pm) lunch.

This place totally nails everything. The Vietnamese style iced coffee and the lavender lemonade were spectacular and perfect for when I went on a warm spring day! I definitely say to get the Cuban mojo, this sandwich was packed with great flavor from the pork that deliciously contrasted with the tang of the pickles and mustard, a must have when you're here! The interior decor is also spot on with an setting that feels like a neighborhood hang out with a trendy vibe.

The decor for this restaurant is marvelous and whomever artist that they hired to decorate deserves the utmost praise. I found their wide selection of mixed drinks to be phenomenal. The blushing Geisha ( Lychee, Lemon ginger, chambord) was fantastic so their martini/cocktail menu I would give a 5/5.All that being said while I found the food aesthetically pleasing, overall I found their food flavor wise to be quite average. Nothing horrendous by any means but nothing that I ordered blew me away. The ham and brie sandwich wasn't bad but I found the ramen here to be underwhelming. Perhaps its my incredibly high standards for ramen and the exposure to LA's Little Tokyo scene on a regular basis that ruined the ramen here from the get go, but I found Shuga's take to be overly salty and the soup base to be particularly bland. Worst of all the noodles seemed undercooked and tended to clump together. The staff could have also done a better job getting the food out in a timely manner during my visit. While they did look busy on a friday night it looked like they only had 3 gentlemen servicing the front of the house and our table didn't receive food until 20-30 minutes after ordering and to top it all off I had to track someone down to fill up my water and ask for the check. Not a bad place overall but if I came back it would be solely just for the cocktails at the bar.
