This is the ultimate dining experience for a group of friends who like to taste, share, and pass plates. Menu has three columns; small, medium, and large plates that can be shared. We tried 7 plates and liked almost all of them.1) Smoked whitefish potato chowder. Smoky, warming, smooth. Perfect for a snowy evening. 2) Chicken meatball with truffle sauce. Sweet and truffle-y. 3) Hand-made mushroom pies. Small bites, big and bold flavor.4) Roasted fingerling potatoes with jalepeno mayo. So dang delicious.5) Brussel sprout salad with bacon and gruyere. A favorite at our table. 6) Parsnip agnolotti with carrot puree. A little dry. Would skip this one. 7) Smoked duck and pear with arugula. Really tasty.Kait was a great server, guiding us on how to order and amounts (7 dishes for 4 people). Turned out perfect. Then we got dessert. Cherry upside-down cake was a favorite. Nice layout to restaurant. There's a store with beer, wine, liquor to purchase on one side of restaurant. Other side haa an open kitchen area. Kevin and Chris were cooking up a storm. Everyone here, guests, bussers, chefs, waitstaff, everyone(!!) is having a good time. Great fun vibe!

Firstly, we arrived at the opening for the day (11am) and people began flooding in. We were seated and the whole restaurant filled up. Seriously every table. The service was wonderful. Our waitress,Amanda, was kind, informative and patient. (We gabbed a lot and were eating along with socializing which is time consuming!) Each of us ordered something different. I had a frittata and my other friends had crepes filled with ham and cheese and the other raspberries and duck. One other friend had the crepe-urrito and potatoes. All of us were thrilled with the food. Fresh and Delicious. Two of us had Bloody Mary's with beer chasers and one had mimosa and some coffee as well. All good. The place itself has lots of different tones of beautiful wood from walls to floor. Gorgeous to look at and very barn house chic feeling. They offer many fine wines by glass and bottle to take come. They have homemade sweets like cookies and rolls. We didn't have room. Maybe next time. The down fall for me was two fold. *Parking is on street and not very convenient. *As more and more people filled up the dining area, it was hard to hear over all the feverish conversation. The vibe was pleasant and happy, just loud. Prices are a little high but everything we had was high quality and prepared very well. It was a very nice experience over all. Go in and experience it for yourself. You won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "ohpWgy7APcTwAAMsoN6ndA", "user_id": "hBElMVw_jyGL7p2X0332aQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Milwaukee, your eats keep bringing us back across the state line. Story Hill BKC lived up to the hype with friendly service, envy worthy style and spot on food. Both the hostess with the perfect skin and Eli, our down-to-earth and knowledgeable server, made us feel welcomed and at ease. Our kids ordered the cheese flatbread (waaay better than the typical kid's meal pizza option) and the berry crepe with vanilla sauce (basically dessert ). I sampled the crepuritto and the French dip crepe. Both were amazing! We indulged in a cinnamon roll to close out the meal. You should probably do the same. Next time we're in town, we'll be back.

Too soon? Gah I don't care. This food here is seriously out of this world. The crepes (savory or not) come in huge portions and are stuffed with the best ingredient. They are by far my favorite items on the menu. I've also tried the breakfast hash, the breakfast burrito, panicotta and sausage roll. Everything thus far has been delicious. The bloody Mary's are also quite delightful. It's not the least expensive brunch in town, but is totally worth it. They have quite a large seating area, but there's usually a wait.

We started with a sausage roll that reminded me of ones seen on the Great British Bake Off (in the best way); the pastry was flaky and buttery, and the sausage was hot and well-seasoned.  A pleasant, comforting kind of food.  I had the house special crepe, which was extremely decadent and quark heavy for my tastes--however, if your tastes lean in the direction of more savory, heavier foods, this would be a good dish for you.  It was just a little much.  My favorite detail was the chili maple syrup that was sweet and then would give you a little kick.For me personally, I think Story Hill BKC was a little overhyped considering the wait (we got on the waitlist via Yelp an hour beforehand, arrived at our scheduled time, and still had to wait 25 minutes after) and how crowded/loud it was inside, but it was still, nonetheless, above-average breakfast food. I wouldn't mind returning, but I think, if anything, I will come back and try out their dinner menu and cocktails instead."}, {"review_id": "a65QX1WVig3YytOB2SVBhA", "user_id": "LMPFjtk4Zlf1U8QjNySRag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I have been here a handful of times and I just love this place!

The last time I was there, I indulged in the special. I got a meatloaf sandwich with their roasted cauliflower salad as a side (the salad is on their regular menu). Both were absolutely nothing short of fantastic. The meat loaf sandwich was pure hearty delicious comfort food. The roasted cauliflower salad features roasted cauliflower, dried tomatoes, pesto, almonds, Montamore, and a zesty citrus vinaigrette. It was one of the best salads I've had the pleasure of consuming.Their prices are reasonable and as I mentioned their service is fantastic. I should also mention there is typically a bit of a wait (rightfully so, they're a popular spot). But, the good news is you can get on the list and in line right from home through the Yelp app. The last time I went for lunch, I got on the list from home, and by the time I arrived I had to wait less than a minute.

You can see it reflected through all the 5-star reviews. And I'm not saying they don't deserve it-- I think I must just not be drinking the same Kool-Aid as everyone else because I feel like it's a solid A-OK experience. I finally ventured here for the first time for a weekday brunch. The ambience is really nice- sort of rustic hipster chic with wooden floors and trendy light fixtures. Parking is fine; there's a small lot in the back and street parking. I'm not sure I'd even try during a Brewers game. The food was fine..? I had the back bacon with eggs. While my server sold me on the green chili sauce, the toast was actually the standout on the plate. And I'm not sure that was intentional. Everything was good, but I guess I just hoped for more heat/flavor - I ended up relying upon a generous dash of hot sauce instead. The coffee is Valentine, which is my favorite local roaster, so I happily accepted the refills of that. Honestly, the most impressive part of the experience was the service. Our server was awesome in that she was prompt, appropriately attentive, readily made good recommendations to our group, and was clearly well-versed in food allergies and dietary needs as evidenced by her recommendations to one of my co-diners. Other staff with whom I interacted were similarly helpful and polite and just came across as professional in their work, which I appreciate. Would I go back? Sure. Would I go out of my way to do so?

Atmosphere was great, very lively and casual setting. Perfect for a nice Saturday brunch. I ordered the crep-urrito and added bacon.

One big thing that draws me to this restaurant (especially during their busy brunch) is that you can reserve your spot in line from the Yelp App! No waiting, no fuss, no getting there at the crack of dawn. Wake up when you want, put your name in line and arrive when the app tells you to -- It's perfect! However, if you have to wait in line, there is a cute little wine and beer shop at the back of the restaurant that you can browse through to take up time. Next, for the menu items. If you are hungry by the time you get to Story Hill (like I usually am) I definitely think you should either get the sausage roll appetizer (if you like savory things) or the cinnamon roll (if you like sweet things). Also, you could always get both to satisfy everyone's taste buds! The only reason I am giving Story Hill 4 stars instead of 5 is because half of the menu is constantly changing! Every single weekend they have a whole new side of the menu. Therefore, it can be hit or miss (depending on what you like) and if you really loved something from that side of the menu, chances are, you will never get it again. So, maybe it is good to always order from the \"special\" side of the menu because it is a once in a lifetime opportunity, but maybe it will be painful the next time you go back and cannot get that dish again. Service at Story Hill is always courteous and prompt. Like another reviewer mentioned though, the place is small and usually packed for brunch. Although I do not feel rushed by the servers, I typically do feel bad for hanging around the table and talking with friends when I know how many people are hungry and waiting in line for my table. Parking may also be tricky so if you make a reservation on Yelp ahead of time, take into consideration that you may have to drive around the block a few times before finding a spot!"}, {"review_id": "W3XbDf2fehJm7rOR-iS8Pg", "user_id": "zVb8dGz3j4owW-8-fIt7iw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "Obvious commentary of the day: Milwaukeeans love brunch. As a result, there are an overwhelming amount of brunch options to choose from in our great city. One that rarely fails to disappoint is Story Hill BKC. I'll start off by saying that Story Hill is not really for everyone. If you are the breakfast traditionalist -- \"Just give me my eggs and sausage and leave me alone\" -- then you may consider popping by Story Hill's sister restaurant Blue's Egg, which offers your typical breakfast fare. However, for the slightly more adventurous amongst us, Story Hill offers something new and exciting. I most recently went this past weekend to celebrate my birthday. My friends and I, being Milwaukee brunch experts, arrived exactly when it opened at 9am. There was already a line out the door waiting. This is VERY typical of Story Hill. The weekend brunch is always packed. Always. So plan accordingly. Our waitress was very friendly, despite being rushed off her feet. She pointed out her favorite menu options and, in general, we had an excellent service experience. I ended up ordering the shakshuka, which is probably my all time favorite brunch dish, although most restaurants do not offer it. It was GREAT. So flavorful and delicious! My friends selected the panna cotta, which was too sweet for me, but my friends enjoyed, and the crepe-urrito -- basically a burrito in crepe form. This dish was recommend to us by our waitress. It tasted good, but was definitely not very visually appetizing. The biggest meal let-down was the birthday mimosa I ordered, which tasted very watered down. I would not recommend. The one disappointing aspect of Story Hill BKC is that you don't really feel like you can relax here. They are always SO busy that it feels like there is a pressure on you to get in and out as fast as possible, so as not to inconvenience the many, many waiting customers. Bottom Line: If you can overlook the huge crowds, the food is worth the wait."}, {"review_id": "NNm3yymP8PyvcKVndODYlQ", "user_id": "n2CIxZA-lr8UPKpiOQlPtA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Excellent choice for breakfast on Sunday.
