Made a reservation, which was great considering all reservations were assigned booths. The place was prettyyy packed by 6pm. Had 7pm reservations and decided to get some drinks at the bar first. I ordered the mojito which tasted lovely, and my hubby went with a hoppy IPA that was on draft. After having a few drinks, our table was ready and we were hungry. We were given pickles to 'pick' on ha pun-intended. We started off with the salt and pepper onion rings. Now, i do have to say if you enjoy a thick coating on an onion ring, these are not for you...They are nice in size, however, they are thinly coated but super crispy. The coating was falling apart - which wasn't a bad thing considering you have a side of horseradish ranch to dip it in.For dinner I wanted the roasted chicken, but they were all out! This was a huge disappointment BUT their menu does state that they have a limited amount. I would've hoped that with a 7pm reservation there would have been some left, buuuut I was wrong. So...my second choice it is - the bison short rib.  The hubbs went with the bison pot roast. For sides he kept it as is with the garlic mashed and roasted carrots which were pretty good. I am not a huge carrot fan so i should have subbed them out. I did switch my mashed for \"aunt fannies\" squash casserole - WORTH IT. Didn't make it to dessert, but there is always next time!"}, {"review_id": "5UJfMKa9DNcdYrShds542g", "user_id": "kHN-rpOFMq8A_Hi9r2EQcA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/26/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We had a horrible experience here -- not at table, but at the bar.We encountered a combative bartender (our cue to leave). We also witnessed several totally confused staff members who obviously had no guidance, and the manager who was responsible to shepherd them. We made a feeble effort to flag this man down, but he was too busy chatting with his employees -- the ones running around without direction.We told Yelp that we responded to the email address on the credit card receipt. We let the corporate people at Ted's know the awful time we had at this restaurant. A regional manager responded directly and promised a comp meal. We declined -- we're vehemently opposed to the current restaurant-world frame of mind that thinks \"free stuff = everything's alright.\" Everything is *not* alright with this handsome, nicely-located restaurant.What's not alright is the staff, from the top down. I'm not going to take the trouble to reiterate our previous detailed description of the treatment we received at the hands of the bar staff, the waitstaff, and the failure of the manager to heed our hand-wave for attention.The bottom line is this: We asked the regional manager to please contact us when he was satisfied that the service and quality was up-to-par for the chain, and we'd return, at our own expense, and re-review. It's been over two months and they've failed to contact me.'Nuff said."}, {"review_id": "UMD-BZgmDYciyoSg9x4J5w", "user_id": "qAcoCMovkkFoLp8t48bBVg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "So I don't really write a lot of reviews, I only do it when either I really like the place or I really did not. I visited Ted's for the second time tonight with a girlfriend, we sat at a bar table around 6 pm, waited for 15 mins and no server in sight. We decided to leave as our movie was at 7 pm at spotlight.After the movie we came back at about 9 pm and the bar was practically empty, we figured perfect time to have a meal. When we told the bartender that we had come in earlier and no one served us, he mentioned he was the only guy taking care of the whole bar and bar tables along with drinks for the rest of the restaurant. Ridiculous! because the place was packed!Anyway, we both ordered Big Sky grilled salad with Salmon. When the salads came out, my salmon was 1/3rd the size of her salmon (I wish I had taken a picture!). When I pointed it out to the bartender, he said \"they look the same size to me\" That got me furious, when we could clearly see it was not, I just wanted him to acknowledge it. I basically paid 15 bucks for a veggie salad. Bad service and doing nothing to fix the situation. Highly disappointed twice in one day at this place. Will not be coming back here!"}, {"review_id": "oNQBn-hk6OpwPltA0iPp8Q", "user_id": "gZ7mbHLlQsLd6S_i5U69tQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "We stopped here for some drinks before a show at the Infinity Theater across the street. I like Front Street, and the adjacent parking garage makes things super easy. The bartender was very nice, however incredibly slow. It was a Sunday night and the place was pretty dead, and even with just the few patrons at the bar, she was very slow and it took a long time to get drinks. My drink was also very weak. We will probably go somewhere else next time."}, {"review_id": "yYGflQX8DKFzc425EMv_pA", "user_id": "TRTtcsL6Lxw0HMQOQnQBIw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "The service was great.

The parking garage across the street provides easy access and the whole area is very pedestrian friendly and vibrant. The food, like all Ted's locations, is phenomenal. Get a burger. Do it.

I have visited other Teds restaurants and found them to be superb. I walked in and there was a professional woman sitting to my left and a hipster couple sitting  to my right. I overheard both of them complaining about the food and service. Subsequently, I asked them both for more details and commiserated. I decided to stay for dinner as I had good experiences elsewhere with the same chain. The bartender was surly I was having dinner at the bar. Not a good sign My $30 Buffalo ribeye was way overdone despite asking for it for  medium rare. The bartender argued with me but finally took it back. While I was waiting for the steak, her colleague literally refused to clean up some salad dressing that I spilled in front of me. He told me to do it myself!  Promptly, I asked for the check, and a few seconds later was told that they had comped my whole meal. Nonetheless, the whole experience was so offputting that I will never sat in a foot in their door Again.    Ted Turner would be embarrassed to know of this crews incompetence"}, {"review_id": "XXaHi9gzIzoRmtVHIuNR_w", "user_id": "Payu5W_nSRy7uj1uV0xuLw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "Came here for our anniversary dinner and was not super thrilled about our experience. Service was fine and accommodating but the food was lacking. I do like the complimentary pickles and paper straws. We were sat and attended to promptly. I ordered the steak which was done well but the sides were awful. Our server offered to get some something else, which I took her up on that but what was sent out to me had the same burnt over-broiled flavor as the first round. When the server asked, I was honest about the taste but she did not follow up with an offer to take anything off the bill. I feel like for the price, I would rather pay a little more and go across the street and enjoy the quality and the ambiance of Capital Grille."}, {"review_id": "jc7hqSnfunuU2A2SfjAcmA", "user_id": "2f2lJxgXIiQOp_-TuKVEeg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Love this place!
