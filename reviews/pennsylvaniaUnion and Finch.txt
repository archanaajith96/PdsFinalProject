Owners and staff are super friendly. Lots of room for families with kids.  We got in at 11 but reservations would be a good idea.   You can park behind the building or on the street.  We will return!"}, {"review_id": "AdqvYwBev-6nv4DzVk-AjQ", "user_id": "dwUHz-9zMHRnGGns4q5ASg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "This is my fourth time visiting. First and second visit was at the bar and wasn't amazing. Third time I had brunch which was good.Trying to be fair. Location and place is nice. Service is nice. Manager is nice and welcoming. Tried the Mac and Cheese, no. Has a bread topping like it's baked and it's more like from the box. The cheese wasn't even pleasing. Bought the savory stack pancakes were still wet. French baguette was terrible wasn't even a nice fresh piece. Rarely do I go somewhere and feel upset about paying for the check but this time I wish I didn't waste $70.Only good this time was the bottomless mimosas which they had no problem refilling every minute."}, {"review_id": "uaXYalCDF_craYc4FIEJkA", "user_id": "V5W2PWtKxLdMNeYM9jfzBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "I don't usually give out a perfect score, unless a place really, really deserves it. The formula I lean on consists of three components with multi-faceted parts: Vibe/Look, Food Menu Offerings/Quality, and Staff/Service Quality. With that in mind, your first step in the door you see a clean and warm restaurant with natural woods and local artist flare on display. You get the distinct feeling you're in a Meat Packing District NYC cafe. Simple yet gorgeous. The drink menu and lunch menu prescribe notably unique dishes and drinks that appeal to the simple salad goer or the out of the box risk taker. There is something for everyone. I ordered mussels and frite. Perfect, delicious. But, it was the service that excelled my expectations. The owner was a kind and outgoing woman who not only seated me, she also took time to converse with me. We chatted about a number of things until my meeting arrived. Our server, Ben was equally as charming. We didn't feel rushed and the order was perfectly accurate. I absolutely recommend. I can't wait to go back again!"}, {"review_id": "ZxVxiDdOEd7mATLdiiYRbA", "user_id": "Tc8OKFonGE51iNoU5JSpig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "I'm from out of town.  The ratings are true.Come visit this place.

I didn't realize they do brunch, so it was the brunch menu, which we are not too into brunch. We just shared wings and a burger. I was excited to try the burger because I saw that it was voted one of the best burgers in Lehigh valley. The wings were fantastic, pretty crispy. The burger was good too, I don't know if it was the best in the valley but it was good. The fries were cold, but when they brought fresh hot fries they were really good. Maybe we will try again on a non brunch day."}, {"review_id": "uq8AWq7U4tYqAuJzM8k8vQ", "user_id": "yXnEnkRdQLEb6iPxoS1ZTw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Lovely establishment nestled in a residential neighborhood. The interior is bright, clean, and has the vibe of a hip brunch spot in a metropolitan city. I came for Sunday brunch with my friend. I ordered their waffles foster and my friend ordered the union omelette. The waffles were moist and golden brown, bananas were brûléed beautifully, and the caramel sauce was drizzled ever so lightly over my waffles. It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, which I often fear when ordering a sweet brunch dish. My friend also enjoyed her omelette, but commented that the potatoes were not as crispy as she would have liked. I will definitely return to check out their happy hour specials!"}, {"review_id": "HUOD5PisMN_bWd7cohOvlw", "user_id": "mU2cnfVVPy2CPebR33ZacQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "People are awesome here, the food is awesome, I would highly recommend the crab and fennel salad with a Mediterranean Mule."}, {"review_id": "dTwh68u_ylg3qzkLcZcGHw", "user_id": "PYZZavPY5EPeXPso8kwY3A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Outstanding brunch!

They don't have a large menu, but what they offer they do very well. House-infused liquors keep the drinks menu interesting, as well as their rotating draft list. The staff and owners are friendly and welcoming. Sunday brunch can be very busy, so make a reservation to guarantee a spot to take advantage of their bottomless mimosas or Bloody Mary's. Keep in mind that Union and Finch is in a residential neighborhood, so parking can be a challenge - bring an umbrella if it's raining. ;-)"}, {"review_id": "FTLEjW4T1DydlK8RxbsIyQ", "user_id": "Plflg8uzQIIBcuVz3G4Q6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Came here for lunch on a Thursday afternoon after newly moving to the area.

The atmosphere is great! Very warm and inviting. The brunch on Sundays with the bottomless mimosas or Bloody Marys are definitely worth coming for, along with the bananas foster waffle.

Easily shareable for the 5 of us but not so huge we wouldn't have room for the main course. I ordered the Carbonara which was absolutely delicious; hardy, juicy pieces of pork cheek and very filling...perfect on a cold night. They have reasonably priced drinks and an interesting beer list; try the bartender's special...it's always different and no one knows exactly what's in it! Our friend ordered one, was told it was gin based and it was pretty tasty. Tucked away on the west side of Allentown, it is worth the trip."}, {"review_id": "EhAOTZVNTKD4KFskEusDfg", "user_id": "mRS97RRGZ3QfjnI2_RKLJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Great food , ambiance, and staff.
