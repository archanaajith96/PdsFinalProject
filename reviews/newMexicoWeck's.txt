GPS offered the usual. Brought up Yelp app and typed in Diners and this place came up. If your in the area looking for good flavorful food, breakfast a then check out Weck's. I had the chicken stew which was delicious and had some good heat to go with the taste. Colleague had the Huevos Rancheros which he couldn't stop moaning about while he was eating. Will definitely eat here again. Staff was super friendly. ** update: ate here a second time, day after the above post, bringing a group of people with us. It was WONDERFUL. This time I had the Huevos Rancheros with eggs over easy and \"Christmas\" (red and green sauces. Out of this world. And two days of super friendly people???  What's up with that??  This place is now on my \"must visit\" list when back in the area"}, {"review_id": "g3oi0KIXr_drVCA9uvBLMA", "user_id": "_8k3meon7y8Ds2nxdCVO1A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/18/2017", "text": "A family favorite, we often go for \"weckfast\" on a Sunday or Saturday morning. We love Patricia and her service. We will always wait longer to sit in her section. The food is always wonderful, large portions, great service. It is very popular, so getting there early is a must. You can also call in an order to go. We do that if Patricia isn't there. I usually order a papa's bowl, but sometimes I have other items. Get them to heat up a cinnamon roll for you before you get your regular order. It's large enough to share. My favorite location to go to, but they are great in any location."}, {"review_id": "mv3-s49A4pLe3WfROmGBIg", "user_id": "CBFT-aUaLYmA_nmCoan2jQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/7/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Placed an order to go and SPECIFICALLY ordered a sandwich with no green Chile or jalapeño yet ended up with both. Wtf. Total waste of money since there's no way to salvage the food since it's SMOTHERED in the stuff, and didn't notice until I took a huge bite of my $10 sandwich after driving fifteen minutes back to my house. Pissed? You bet I'm super pissed.

My water was never empty & my coffee always refilled. They had a special coffee blend the day we were in that was to die for. I got an omelette, the one with sprouts in it (the names not memorable) and it was mediocre, I had to drown it in hot sauce to make it edible. Friend got French toast she said it was ok, other friend had a papas bowl, she said that's her \"go-to\" meal there & she liked it.

This to me takes the heat and flavor away from the chili. So you can have the normal gluten free things, but no breads that are gluten free.

The wait can be daunting at peak times, but usually our wait has been less than ten minutes, if any at all. The service is performed in clear audible voices, there is no doubt as to who is taking care of you because everyone in the Weck's shirt is on one team. My happy misfortune of being brought two simultaneous Dr. Pepper's- Joy! The food is prepared for feeding you. You will not go away unfed, that is to say; The portions are adequate and satisfying to anyone's standard of fullness. The fifth star I gladly offer for this one thing: The To-Go drink policy. That is going to bring me here for many repeat visits.Specific dishes that I have luxuriated over: 1) New Mex Benedict, inventive and flavorful. Rich tender carnitas in green chile sauce and runny eggs.2) The Full-Belly French Toast. You are entering a world of pain, Donnie. 3) The Bowl Of Papas. Had mine with bacon, green sauce, and extra cheese. That meal is still in my side-view mirror when I day-dream. Cannot say enough about the thoughtful, hospitable service."}, {"review_id": "XcMg0r4oLDi2ZyvZJI0FIA", "user_id": "j_iWfll9qsQ7UMWLCPhqeQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2017", "text": "Searching for a great taste of local flavor for Sunday brunch? Then give the Farmer's Benedict a try! They substitute the regular English muffins for biscuits, and it's delicious. They also made the potatoes extra crispy just how I asked and they were perfect. I also recommend their green chili sauce, it's some of the best in New Mexico. Maddison was sooo nice and hospitable, she even made the baby laugh a few times!
