I got here around 12:30 and took a solo seat at the bar. Apparently I just beat the crowd because I was hearing 40 minute wait times for a table of two. It took no time for me to chomp into this thing. The only thing that slowed me down was that the lobster kept falling out of the roll. And this isn't due to a crappy roll, it's due to the amount of lobster they stuff into it. It's partially an entire lobster. This buttery goodness was definitely worth the Uber ride from the office just for lunch. Come but expect a wait.

BOSTON.I've never made it to Neptune until now because I always disliked that they didn't take reservations and didn't have the patience to wait. I'm a monster when I'm hungry.But I got lucky on a Tuesday night with only about 25 minutes of waiting, and got even luckier with the daily special menu.Oysters: A wide selection, all delicious and very, very fresh.Crudo - DAYBOAT SCALLOPS: AMAZING. I love raw seafood and they amazed me with the scallops. Very fresh scallops and thoughtful plating and seasoning.***SEA URCHIN BUCATINI*** (Tuesday special): As a sea urchin lover, this dish was a dream-come-true. I was pleasantly surprised at how fresh the sea urchin was, how the dish was seasoned perfectly, and how much sea urchin they put in the dish. This was my happy dish and I'd have it for every meal if I could. Really.The fact that they don't take reservations might be a let-down at first, but I can see why -- they don't need to! Overall, with the fresh seafood, excellent service, and wide selection of artful dishes, it's worth the wait.

Score!!! :) Sat down at the bar and ordered a Hot lobster roll. Portion size was huge, but so was the market price. Lobster meat was fresh & tasty, couldn't finish and had to pack it to go. The French fries that came with was plentiful. Also ordered a clam chowder to go, since it's made fresh to order. Picked up 2 items from their raw bar - a cherrystone clam, and a Wellington oyster. Both were delicious & $2.50/$2.90 respectively.

ROLLS. The best I've had. Worth the two hour wait.The good: I'm sure all their food is delicious, but by God the lobster roll is phenomenal. The reputation holds true, from the generous chunks loaded on a soft yet sturdy bun to the load of fresh cut fries that are served on the side. The roll wasn't too buttery and the lobster flavor was tantalizing. The atmosphere is unique and rustic, but in a classy way. The server was friendly and attentive, and the food came out pretty quickly after we ordered. Oh, and the portions are huge, I had to be rolled outta there.The not-so-good: The wait, as many others state, is absurdly long.

Where is the best place to get one? Neptune Oyster! BUT, if you're not ready to fork over some $$$ for delicious seafood, this might not be the spot for you. Honestly, Neptune's 4.5 star rating already speaks for itself. Patrons come from all over and line up very early in the afternoon to enjoy the delicious food Neptune has to offer. LOBSTAH ROLLI was so excited to try seafood in Boston and see how it differed from seafood from the West Coast. A lot of my friends were raving about the delicious lobster roll here and I was definitely not disappointed. For $30, you can either get the lobster roll hot with butter or cold with mayo. Personally, you can't really go wrong with lobster and butter so I had to try it this way. It warmed my heart, I absolutely loved it. The lobster was sweet and they did not skimp on portions. The bun absorbed all that delicious buttery lobster flavor, it was awesome! It comes with fries, so very easy to share with one other person. SEAFOOD CIOPPINOMy sister and I wanted something warm to help us out with the Boston cold winds, so we tried the Seafood Cioppino ($30). It came with mussels, local fish, salmon, shrimp and clams. Unlike other Cioppino that I've had, this was served with a bed of rice pilaf. It was just the thing we needed to warm ourselves after braving the cold for days. RAW BARThey call this place Neptune Oyster because they have great oysters available from all over. I honestly love West Coast oysters like Kusshis and Kumamotos, but since I'm visiting the East Coast, why not try some of theirs? I enjoyed the Well Fleet ($2.90) and Katama Bay ($2.90) oysters a lot, but I didn't get the \"popcorn\" finish they talked about. Still meaty, salty and fresh. Cherrystone Clams ($2.50) are also delicious, both sweet and meaty, they're some of my favorites as well. I saw a lot of pictures of their seafood cocktails and I was very interested in trying the Japanese Octopus. It was perfectly citrus-y, the octopus meat was sweet and it was from Japan. Awesome find, I'm so glad I got to eat it. This is really the perfect place for seafood lovers. SERVICE/WAITWe arrived on a Friday afternoon at 11am, 30 minutes before they opened. There was already a line forming outside and my sister and I hoped that we would be seated during the first round. Fortunately, when the doors opened and people slowly made their way in, there were two seats left at the bar. Those in line after me were told the wait was going to be anywhere between an hour to an hour and a half. We were so lucky! Service was great and I loved sitting at the bar because you were able to watch the servers shuck the oysters and prepare the raw bar options.I really can't rave enough about this place. I highly recommend it for those who are visiting Boston and passing by, or even to locals. Yes, it's expensive, but you're paying for high quality and fresh seafood, something you can't get very often. BALL OUT, drop extra moolah for that experience, it's really worth it.

But I don't mind padding their stats after such a great dining experience!I went to Neptune Oyster on a Friday evening after a day of shopping on Newbury street (taking advantage of the no sales tax!) and ice skating on Frog Pond. I anticipated a long wait, but there was actually no line at around 5 pm! We weren't very hungry yet, so we asked if we could just go back in about an hour, and the host was kind enough to accommodate our request.We ordered 6 oysters and the Neptune Johnnycake to share, and we each had a Maine lobster roll. The oysters were so fresh, and I enjoyed sitting at the bar where I could watch them being shucked. I didn't know what to expect from the Johnnycake. It was so delicious... warm and buttery, but also crispy on the outside. I savored every bite, and it was one of the most memorable foods I ate during my Boston trip. And of course, the lobster roll was wonderful. It included a generous amount of lobster as well as fries.I can't recommend Neptune Oyster enough.

I noticed some larger parties having a hard time getting sat so if yI was so torn between what to order but settled upon the sea urchin bucatini with some help from my amazing server.

Even at an lunch opening, the line was down the block on a Saturday morning. Plan to have a line holder or to arrive early enough with a charged phone and expect to wait yourself. For our dining experience, we had the lobster roll ($31) and 8 oysters for market price.  We truly enjoyed what we had, but despite the great food, we still left hungry and our wallets bare. Service was so-so, and a little slow considering the number of servers they had for the opening lunch. This is my final take - the food is delicious, however, they realize they have notoriety and it possibly could be getting in the way of service and a quality customer experience.
