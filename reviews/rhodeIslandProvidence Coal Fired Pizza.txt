We were seated right away and got started with the wings. The wings are amazing! A must get! They are grilled and seasoned with rosemary and salt, not buffalo, and topped with roasted onions. The waitress informed us that they have been nominated for best wings in RI! And it is easy to understand why. Although there is only one style wing, they have it down perfect and they always come out just as good as the last time I had them.For dinner, we split a couple of pizzas. The pizza here is somewhat thin dough but with a meatier crust. It is most akin to the New Haven style pizza I grew up with, which you don't find many other places near here serving.  Although we were stuffed, someone in the party had to ask about dessert, and I'm glad they did. Turns out, they make all their desserts in house. They are small portions (served in a ramekin size bowl). My friends got the strawberry cheesecake; I tried it and the cheesecake was dense and moist - soo good! I got their butterscotch pudding which was also very good; the butterscotch was not an overwhelming or overly sweet, and it was topped with whipped cream. Desserts were $4-$5 each. And thanks to previous Yelpers, we discovered that Tuesday has a wine special! Half off bottles of wine with purchase of a pizza. As if we needed another reason to come! Whether you are looking for a place to grab drinks and snacks after work, getting food before a show, or just looking for a dinner, Coal Fired Pizza is a consistently satisfying option!"}, {"review_id": "xkkn1jhKj_16VrwWQ4QnCg", "user_id": "Hqsuhjs3iN1MtKHD3Hzkuw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "I just can't give this place a good review since they are a pizza place and the pizza was terrible. I am so confused on how they have such a high rating. We ordered a pepperoni pizza that's about $18 dollars thinking it would sharing size. It's not. Your paying the price of a large pizza for a personal sized pizza. I felt like I was eating more grease than pizza. It's like they hardly put any cheese or toppings on the pizza. Someone shared with me that they used to fill their pizzas with toppings but now the portion control just makes for a terrible pizza, wish I had known that before we went. Drinks are fine and I did enjoy the spinach dip I had. It's great for large groups space wise for down town providence and they have valet parking but I just can't get over how bad that pizza was. Customer service was good and I had no issue with the service but if you're a pizza place you should get the pizza right. Just don't go."}, {"review_id": "88GQrid0EcqBx4RG3leesw", "user_id": "E0rKCurqwmTbZ3M08w-O_A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Really, really good.  This is like NY coal fired pizza with slightly nicer fresher cheese.The service was also great."}, {"review_id": "Y3iiImyrg_R7SbuzVZjqjw", "user_id": "PK6txq7fd945nX86_dSw9Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "Came on a Sunday night and there was plenty of seating available.

Nine of us came here Sunday afternoon after a running race. For some reason after doing a race, pizza, wings, and beers are always good cravings and indulged in them we did!This restaurant is huge and not surprisingly with the too many choices to go to in Providence, it wasn't busy at all. Or maybe because this place is so big it tends to make it seems less busy than all the other establishments in the area. Anyway, we were accommodated right away. The Patriots were on the tv screens, good friends around you, and great pizza in front of you. What more can a girl ask for? Free pizza maybe? Done! They have a special on Sundays during the football season that if you order 2 large wings, then you get FREE Margherita pizza. So we ordered 2 sets of coal-fired large wings. The wings and the 3 types of pizza we ordered (see pictures below) were all delicious! This is definitely a great place to go to with a whole bunch of your friends. It's walking distance from Johnson & Wales University. Tons of street parkings, as well as parking lots. Good food, good price, and great service!"}, {"review_id": "FOsY7PWaCtwspJ1OeG1WgA", "user_id": "BcvBCZuYaLR71pkjyCNEzA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Stopped in after a long day of travel from PA.

It is very spacious but always pretty packed. They have lots of daily drink deals (but beware, you get what you pay for. a $3 Marg is going to taste like a $3 dollar marg) and pizza deals. I would check their website or just show up for a nice surprise.Starters: I always get the arugula salad (accompanied with Prosciutto di parma, shaved fennel, Pecorino and lemon vinaigrette). That lemon vinaigrette is TOO good. Just enough zest and never overly oily. The goat cheese and beet salad is really good as well. Pizzas: Always get 1/2 1/2. I love that they do this! A staple for me is the Eddy, baby Bella. (if they have the caesar grilled chicken special make sure you get it!). The only one I haven't liked is the broccoli rabe (which is a bit bland). Also the pizzas are LARGE! 2 can feed 3 people (to max stuffing)."}, {"review_id": "g8ySrublcJ4eeQdbK4CmdQ", "user_id": "Q23OKvi-TO5u2x5cyrcqcA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Ordered steak pizza and it was a bit overwhelming.

The pizza came out pretty burnt on one side and underneath, to the point where it was completely black and inedible. When we asked the waiter if this was normal, the manager, who was very accommodating, came over and immediately offered to replace the full pie for us.  The new pie was cooked to perfection - slightly charred, but that's how thin crust pizza should be.  The chicken wings were pretty unspectacular.  Based off of all the hype, I was expecting them to be amazing, but they tasted like average grilled wings to me, although I did like the caramelized onions that it came with. I  really enjoyed the pizza though - crispy and thin with a chewy crust.  My only issue is that the toppings on the clam pizza made the crust a little soggy. As a result, I had to resort to using a fork and knife to eat it.  Overall, I had an enjoyable experience at Providence coal fired and really appreciated how the management and waitstaff went above and beyond to accommodate us."}, {"review_id": "RqykoBq7QeVyVtzrKP_L6w", "user_id": "M33qVUDKyKlLHsHONhtc6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2017", "text": "This is where it starts folks!!

Well, first of all, ask for Dino to be your server. He's incredible and incredibly kind.

Pizza also doesn't come or scorchingly hot - you can pretty much go for it when it gets to your table. Absolutely incredible.
