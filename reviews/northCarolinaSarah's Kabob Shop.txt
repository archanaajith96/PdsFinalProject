Most particularly I was inspired by my recent visit, where i tried the Shwarma salad, extra spicy. I have long loved their Shwarma over rice, but am trying to eat a very low carb diet, so had been searching for tasty options to eat out with more protein.Just great flavors in that shwarma, and the added heat only enhanced them. It wasn't just heat for heat's sake, it added heat while adding spice that worked with the meat nicely. On top of that, it was a nice big salad with a generous amount of everything. I am going to be getting this a lot.Bravo Sarah. Keep up the good work!"}, {"review_id": "37AVlZ5eCSsuLxp_3YTecQ", "user_id": "iNNxSbtDSlg10ed9-ChUyA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "This was my first time trying Sarah's Kabob Shop. I ordered the beef and chicken kabobs, came with a salad and rice. I also got a falafel (which was outstanding by the way)If you are unsure of what to order, definitely go for the beef kabob. It was soft, cooked perfectly, and had amazing flavor! My only complaint would be that the chicken was very dry. It had good flavor but I had to mix it in with the rice to finish it.. all in all they will receive my business again. Staff was extremely helpful and nice"}, {"review_id": "HD_mHP6Oxha6U2jeJ3eLXw", "user_id": "UoC0jLDFzY2Ou5Tsd4AIHw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "I was traveling solo for business and needed something to break the monotony of fast food and carryout so I took to yelp to find what the locals eat. I saw Sarah's as one of the highest rated restaurants and decided it was worth checking out. I am from the Washington D.C. area which has a richly diverse food scene with no shortage of kabob shops so I was skeptical that Sarah's would hold up to DC standards.I ordered the mixed Shawarma over rice, extra spicy, and was amazed. Without exaggeration it was the best kabob meal I have had. The meat was tender and flavorful, the spices well balanced, the naan warm and soft, and the portions generous. The atmosphere was exactly what I was looking for as a solo traveler with  an easy ordering process, helpful staff, and self seating so I could find a spot for myself without the awkwardness of booking a table for one.I will be back every chance I get."}, {"review_id": "mvwJi8HdSG0Sl5pZbNTb-w", "user_id": "78dSO1f1Y5h0sYmUbxMhSQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "I love love love Mediterranean food (falafel is my weakness) so I was extra happy to find out that Greensboro had a plethora of dining options that would satisfy that craving. My friend recommended Sarah's Kebab Shop and told me that I just HAD to try the shwarma over rice platter. She actually hadn't even tried anything else at Sarah's because this was so darn good. So after hearing her raving about Sarah's magical chicken shwarma platter, of course I had to try for myself. It's like a quick service setup, so you order at the cash register, and then take a number and a server brings your food over very promptly. My mouth was watering by the time our heaping plates were brought to us. Generous serving of rice, salad, and a couple triangles of pita surrounding the beautiful meat. I've never had shwarma served like this before--the chicken was cooked in with vegetables and a sauce, whereas the ones I've seen aren't covered in a sauce. Portions are ginormous, and thankfully so, because I cleaned my plate. I know I should try something new, but I honestly can't wait to come back and order the same thing!"}, {"review_id": "5jKxphIy8DxYdLCNiIoVdQ", "user_id": "78ububL5TP4V82eOAQpURg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Great food!

Im used to the bland gyros of Pita Delite and such and figured this was just another Pita pop up. My sister had a coupon so we decided to try it. I ordered the mixed plate with chicken and beef, French fries, and salad. She ordered a lamb gyro, spicy. Her gyro was excellent. It was packed full and she actually had to hold it while I took a bite so she didn't risk all the stuffing falling out. It was definitely spicy and packed with flavor. My mixed plate was very good. The chicken was moist, the beef was cooked well, the fries were yummy, and the salad was good. Their tzatziki might be the best I've ever had. They had another sauce or dressing (I'm not sure what it was) that was amazing. I thought it was tahini at first. It tasted garlicky and a bit oily and was perfect for dipping my fries and chicken in. I used it as salad dressing as well. There was plenty of food on the mixed plate, enough for a second meal for me.This place was packed when we went at lunchtime. The employees were super friendly and answered a bunch of questions, made suggestions, checked on us as we ate, cleared our table of trash, and got us extra sides and such. For a quick service meal, I felt like we were waited on. And best of all, they did it with a smile and they were so friendly. Good service will always make me come back. But more so, good food will make me come back. And Sarah's has great food. As someone who grew up eating this stuff, it was on point!"}, {"review_id": "7uUaJicGbg6MhSzKyByc9A", "user_id": "UmAC_AobvVhmGYjFLdNyUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Absolutely delicious!

I travel across our great state on business so the next time I am in Greensboro I know where I am having my lunch or dinner.  You go Sarah!!!  I am a fan and when I go on this diet at 12:01AM January 1st, I believe I can still eat here with some modifications.  Whose loving it right now? Oh me that's who.  Two thumbs up!"}, {"review_id": "ztENiwlbVYpWX-TsfMx9CQ", "user_id": "oM3Az1XksL5bN266EO7k5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Stopped here when driving through Greensboro because of the strong Yelp reviews.

They offer a wide range of Mediterranean food and its honestly one of the best Mediterranean restaurants I've been to.I ordered the Lamb Gyro (medium spicy) platter and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Shawarma platter (medium spicy). Both came with sides (rice and a salad). What makes their food unique is how they spice the meats. I've never had a gyro spiced so perfectly well and flavorful! Plentiful of food, service is quick, and the staff is very nice and welcoming. Definitely recommend if you're in the area.
