We had:Gorditas with ground beef. Huevos rancheros w/ potatoes and tortilla. And the pork plate with red and green Chile & tortilla. The waiter was really nice, brought us complimentary salsa & chips and kept the drinks refilled.All agreed the food was excellent! I mean really tasty & the Chile is hot, just the way we like it.The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star rating was the sticky, greasy feeling table. We all agreed, if not for that, it would have been a perfect visit."}, {"review_id": "zeYc2cOHY8rTuYx6AaE5jg", "user_id": "CJW4pIHoXnKvvzxVonUqsA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "10/4/2017", "text": "Not sure how this place has 4.5 stars?! My guess is that it's often reviewed by kids from the college located near by. Honestly, its frightening from the outside and I'm not even talking about the cracky looking hotel adjacent to it. Parking lot looks like it needed to be redone about 20 years ago. We had to ask the server to wipe the table down because it was so sticky (even after he wiped it, it was still sticky). The chips were stale, the salsa was watery and tasted like any poison. I'm actually scared for the food to come out. Okay the food came out. It's better than I expected. I asked for green chilie pork smothered in red sauce and it came with green sauce but it's good. Pretty damn spicy, even my Mexican friend is being a little bitch and crying."}, {"review_id": "WJ_W70zUM8T4vMLnBkg98A", "user_id": "OlLFIr0nX73M86io_a4anw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/16/2017", "text": "Amazingly delicious!

Unassuming exterior but packed with flavor inside. The three day of us had: lunch plate (green chile pork, cheese enchilada and chicken taco), a mushroom Swiss burger with hand cut fries and the red chile pork plate. Delicious. My son enjoyed the extensive selection of Jarritos to select from.  Lots of food and tasty. The red chile was just spicy enough without being overwhelming. The green chile sauce was less spicy but still delicious."}, {"review_id": "YLDvuE5zrAbVyRdbcc_9Dw", "user_id": "iC3Bpd3S6VpbE8wYXk4Cag", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/18/2017", "text": "The service is amazing!

Verdict, it's FoR REAL!  Food is 5 stars. Ambiance is typical of a hole in a wall place. It's small, average priced items, clean and very  friendly staff.Food came out fast and hot and plentiful. They had some not so common typical items in the menu that was just outstanding.  We had the beef cheek tacos- kick ass flavor and texture. Had to also try the chicharones burrito smothered in red and green chile- amazing!All in all great food, nothing fancy-actually had holes in the wall (ok, just one in the ceiling) but a must stop for authentic great Mexican food!"}, {"review_id": "5Qrh9mp3ASbHmkn2WZmRUA", "user_id": "ajMU_T8qAfimXsanii2b9g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/17/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Fantastic sandwiches.

I personally like hole in the walls as they often have the best food around. The Green Chile has a unique taste and texture as it's more of a sauce than anything I'm used to.  I've never had anything like it, that's not bad, just different.The beans and rice had a good flavor as did the complimentary chips and salsa.  They serve bottled drinks from Mexico as well as horacha if you're into that.  Our server was on the ball, there are 6 tables inside and three had people at them but he did a great job."}, {"review_id": "IzmIs3v-4BHoKmz-1DDGww", "user_id": "AvyJ_BQPq-4EI7LMI81Oiw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/28/2017", "text": "This place was ok.  The red sauce is spicy and made my nose run. I liked that. But the beans had no flavor (aside from the cheese on them) and the enchiladas were a little dense.
