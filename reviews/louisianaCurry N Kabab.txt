The first time we dined here, we spent several minutes chatting with the owner who is very passionate about the quality of food he serves. If I'm not mistaken, the dishes are *mostly* vegan and/or gluten free (please confirm with the restaurant) which means that you won't feel that super uncomfortable bloat after eating fluffy naan and rice. This also means that the dishes don't use heavy creams and what not, your dish will likely not 'look' as rich but the taste is just as rich without the calories. You have the option to order your dishes mild, medium, or spicy; the SPICY is FIRE so be careful! I'd probably go with medium for the food to be palatable next time around. We had their buffet once and ordered a la carte the other--I must say the a la carte ordering is a tad expensive. I've never paid for rice at an Indian restaurant, and $4 for a medium-ish bowl seems quite high. We ordered the chaat papri to start, channa masala, butter chicken, rice and naan. All were very good, but when I took the left overs home, I kept getting a grain of cardamom or coriander (not well versed in my Indian spices!) with almost every bite of butter chicken + rice. That was kinda off putting. Honestly, I think the vegetarian dishes are the star of the show here.The owner encourages you to order over the phone in advance (for both dining and carry out orders) as everything is made fresh and upon order only. Service was ok the last time we were there; I think the server was overworked or maybe having just a bad day. The bathroom could certainly use some work. Will def be back when I'm in the area!"}, {"review_id": "XoCnfFxOsa8Ip1Z0FD74bQ", "user_id": "zpJDd75wJZUQ5qP9PYivPg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "I was looking for some grub, after an evening of Christmas shopping on Siegen.  I have often wanted to go to Curry N Kabab, but we live on the other side of town and just have not taken the time to go.  I got on the website to check the hours.  Unfortunately, they were going to close in 45 min. But I saw they allowed carry out orders to be placed for another 15 min and they had an online order form.  I browsed the menu and placed an order for Chicken Tikka Masla, paneer in curry sauce, garlic naan and gobi aloo.  The pictures on the website were great and the order process was very easy.  At the end the website told me what time to arrive and pick up my order.  Picking up my order was easy.  Walked in, gave my name to the server and a few min later my order was ready to go.  I paid online, so I just got my bag of Indian goodness and was on my way home.The food smelled great and filled my car with aromas of curry and garlic, making it hard to wait to get home to dig in.   Unpacking the order, I was happy with the portion size of all dishes.   As a few reviewers have said, the dishes were a little sweeter than expected, but not so much that it over powered the food.  I still enjoyed all of the food and had plenty left over for another meal.  Looking forward to going back and trying other dishes."}, {"review_id": "ysF4PRCpNcjJxKgFB-JEUw", "user_id": "7DKBzeUhgSXb6PdcRdFFAQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "My family and I are in LOVE and are planning our next trip to this area just to come back.

If you go there, you'll get the real thing!Once you walk into the place all the aromas and fragances melt and create an unique atmosphere that takes you out of Baton Rouge... it brought me back to a different continent!The decoration of the restaurant is very simple, but it is part of the whole experience. The owner is Mr. Khan. A very nice gentleman who takes the time to go to every table and talk to the customers offering courtesies from the kitchen.Everytime he receives us with an \"appetizer\" (a taste of something new or out of the menu), last time it was a type of crunchy oregano bread, it was super tasty!The first time I went to this restaurant they had a buffet, but after the flood (August 2016) they don't have it anymore. They do have a special menu (I believe it  changes every day), it is served with a main dish, a side, rice and nan. Be aware that portions are big (the \"side\" was almost as big as the main dish). So, if you order the special and something else (appetizer), depending on how much you eat  you may end up bringing a box home with some food for lunch for the next day. During our last visit, we ordered samosas... They were delicious and good size. And we also ordeed the special menu. Chicken tandori, fish curry and a dish with spinach that I don't remember the name at the moment. As I said earlier, this includes rice and Nan, everything was super tasty! Perfect balance of spices, the chicken was a little bit more spicy that the other two dishes, but mild enough that it didn't take over all the flavors. The service is good and the food amazing, next time I'll try some of the desserts... I love this place! 100% recommended!!"}, {"review_id": "5BysA2uQ_e1O0aIs87p5jg", "user_id": "VphN1_gIDAk-AJSwXxEPEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "I visited this place twice. The owner and servers are very friendly. The foods came out pretty fast and tasted very good. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala the first time, and Butter Chicken the second time.

While we were waiting on our food, he came to our table to warmly welcome us. He really took care of us and went out of his way to make sure we were enjoyed our time there. Above it all, his friendliness made our experience very personal and enjoyable.The restaurant had a quaint, home-like atmosphere. Everything is made fresh and from scratch from tamarind sauce to mango lassi drink. The dishes we ordered were heavenly, which made the wait for the food worthwhile. We ordered the lamb boti kabab and chicken kofta. For drinks, the mango lassi and masala chai. I felt the mango lassi tasted essentially like aloe and mango juice mixed together. It was extremely sweet for my taste. Whereas my boyfriend enjoyed his masala chai. We unintentionally stayed 15 min after closing because according to Yelp they closed at 8:30 Sunday, but that is incorrect. It's actually 8. Moreover I deeply appreciated that we didn't feel rushed to get out of there. All things considered I could not be happier with my decision to dine here.

As the final stop from Louisiana, we decided to eat some indian cuisine. This place has some bomb diggity samosas and naan. Oh man... that naan doe. It was crispy and fluffy at the same time. Probably the best i've had at an indian joint.The special that day was the chicken tika masala. The portion was quite large (I couldn't finish it). Though it was slightly on the sweeter side, it still tasted fresh with the long grain rice. There was a huge selection of food to choose from so be prepared to choose. The highlight of this place was their impeccable service. The owner and waitress were both super nice.

Up until now I have only ever gotten their biryani to go and loved it. So today I decided I would give their lunch a try.We got there before 12 and the place was empty but the food was freshly set onto the buffet. It is a smaller buffet, but they had 2 chicken options, 2 fish options, 1 goat option in terms of meat. They had the saag paneer, veggie pakora, cabbage curry, and a potato dish as their vegetarian items. Aside from that there was also tomato soup, and a dessert. The moment you get in the waitress will ask you what kind of naan they can start for you, and i have to agree with fellow reviewers, their garlic naan is pretty great.All the food was solid, good flavoring and fresh. They don't have very big portions on the buffet but I suspect that is to reduce waste and to keep the items freshly refilled. I think they can improve on their ambiance, the place is a bit stuffy and a tad bit warm. I was surprised it costs extra for mint chutney, seems like it should just be included. It may not be my favorite indian place in town but it is definitely a solid optionZ"}, {"review_id": "gfZTxD5pRUZG7xVimALLsw", "user_id": "2S0MLQWrSpQxb8rEWXVTlw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/19/2017", "text": "Cuisine at Curry N Kabab is fresh and full of flavor.  There is an extensive menu that is also vegetarian and vegan friendly.  Dishes are full of wonderfully tasting spices, and you can request the spicier version, which can leave your mouth on fire (if you wish).  Staff members were friendly.  Music selection was a nice touch.  Mango Lassi is very refreshing and I would recommend it after your meal, rather than during as it is very filling."}, {"review_id": "7weI2XIzAlMkRrAMu1TasA", "user_id": "pAL9RXb6dH35qspCB2j7bw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/10/2016", "text": "Upon arriving we were looking forward to the dinner buffet but we were informed they have suspended the buffet at this time. Bummer! Regardless we decided to stay and dine here. Our server Austin was beyond friendly and helpful. I couldn't believe the personal experience from recommendations which consisted of him describing the menu and the different entree dishes. I was thoroughly impressed with our server and felt really comfortable. Our server asked if we had any allergies and informed us what may or may not have milk in it (some naan does.) He said that could sub coconut milk, they have gluten free options, as well as all the vegetarian dishes. I love the personal touches here. We decided to get the plate special which consisted of Chicken Tiki Marsala (which is broiled chicken tikki in a cream sauce) and Palak Paneer (which is like cheese and spinach cream dip.) They subbed the fried fish for me and gave me extra of the good stuff. Winning! They brought out regular naan when I had ordered wheat but the server graciously accommodated us after the mix up and brought us out our Naan Roti which was buttered and golden brown and just yummy. The menu is exceptional. They have so many varieties ranging from multiple naan breads to choose from to multiple vegan options. Our food was very good. We thoroughly enjoyed our dishes and our experience. And three cheers for the pistachio pudding on the house.
