Except I do not have that much gym time. My first Burrata was at Dough in 2015. I have only seen this on one other menu in my 17,000 mile journey across the USA.

Yelp to the rescue!\"I did not, however, read all the reviews. I tend to just get an overview of the places, then try them unbiased, then form my own opinion. The only thing I did do was look at pictures. Upon perusing those, I had already picked out the pizza I wanted -- the aglio e ollo --which in Terrispeak translated to \"let's see how much cheese I can get on a small pizza\". I was pumped!I arrived early and was seated right before a dinner rush. I asked to be seated out on the patio as the temperature was dropping a little and I thought it would be nice. It most definitely was, and they even give you a blanket to use. (I didn't, but I'm a weird germaphobe like that.) My server was extremely nice and friendly and when she described the appetizer it sounded very delicious. She left out that there was honey in it though, which weirdly was off putting when eating the prosciutto and spreadable cheese combo. I love honey, I love ham and I love cheese....but weirdly, that honey overpowered everything else on the bread. I ate one piece and just left the rest, which I felt very bad about since it was a $10 appetizer (I think a bit more). People come here for the pizza, so I had already picked out the aglio one, which appeared to have lots of cheese and no marinara sauce. I love white pizzas, so when she said it wasn't available, I sort of wanted to be all petulant. Instead, I simply asked if they could make it even if it wasn't on the menu and she, without even checking, said no. I'm not one to pick a fight, so I said fine. Looking back I wish I would have pushed her a bit more on that issue, seeing as how plenty of the reviews state they can make something not on the menu. I did ask her what her recommendation would be then, and she said the margherita pizza was her favorite, and that's what I ordered. She also said to upgrade the cheese for 2.5, so this small pizza is clocking in at 16 now. That's a lot for this pizza.I'll preface all of what I'm about to say with this: I have eaten my fair share of Neo Pizza. Cane Rosso, Olivella's, Spin, Cavalli's....I know all the places to hit up in Dallas for great Neo Pizza. So when I had this, that's what I was comparing it to. I also did not know that this place had been on Guy Fieri's show, which totally makes sense now. This was overpriced pizza. Look, I know pizza and what the cost should be here and San Antonio didn't reinvent the wheel here. The pizza I got lacked a good sauce, and that mozzarella was not worth charging more for. I'm still wondering if I even got the bufalo mozz, as this didn't taste like what I get when I order it. I gave it three stars simply because even though the waitress was unable to change the availability of pizza, she was nice and did do her job. Overall though, I felt like this place was simply coasting off of a TV spot. There's apparently one here in Plano, but I've never even heard of it, which does not bode well in my opinion. But I'm a big proponent of people making up their own minds, so if nothing else try it and hopefully your experience will be different than mine.Added one extra star because Lori, the manager, reached out."}, {"review_id": "bYo9hr4xPdxjwYXjBrC1vw", "user_id": "m1IYrFif8u7Tn1VYRDmZvA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Absolutely the most perfect pizza I've ever eaten in my whole entire life.

Nice char on both the crust and the ingredients. The cheese flavor wasn't very prominent to me, the leeks were nice and tender, and the mushrooms were meaty. The sausage flavor wasn't very strong.A few challenges of neapolitan pizza - the crust definitely has a bit of a chew to it, so heads up. This is not your fluffy, domino's breadsticks type of deal. Secondly, because it is so thin, it cools down quickly. There's no real way around this and I do think it's much tastier when it's hot (like all pizza, really)"}, {"review_id": "IBi-0_ZAAdfIoGPTb1VthQ", "user_id": "jaDSdYjWd0qB49u4e8pGsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "I have heard so many great things about dough and I must say i have to concur! I came here for lunch with a friend and were greeted very warmly by the waitress as soon as we were seated. She was extremely friendly and resourceful.

We were here for lunch so I wound up ordering the small arugula and prosciutto pizza with a salad and tea added for $5. The salad had excellent presentation and I loved the house dressing. The pizza was absolutely delicious, they don't skimp on the toppings.  Overall great service, food, and ambiance.

It had a basil leaf atop and mushrooms and fresh Roma tomatoes underneath with a balsamic vinegar drizzle around the edges. It came with delicious garlic and cheese bread. The bread would have been delicious all on its own, but paired great with the cheese.I got a spicy sausage, mozzarella, ricotta pizza. I forget the exact name, but it was delicious. The sausage did indeed have a nice but of spiciness. Not at all too much to handle, but worth calling spicy.My husband got the neighborhood favorite. It had mushrooms, pork, and other items. My husband enjoyed it, but he felt it needed a bit of something fresh to cut through to flavor. Possibly basil. He still enjoyed it.Bathrooms: one person and clean.Parking: Enough parking when we went, but may be difficult at peak times."}, {"review_id": "M3GgmNq7Qyk_uFsaXOsPEg", "user_id": "MIYzuhcSblBYViHrUYquEQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/30/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Sadly, all the TV, media and crowd notoriety has cheapened Dough's food quality, but certainly NOT their prices! The expansion was welcomed and much needed, but the tables are a bit TOO crammed together. I'm not big on personal space but I feel like we are sitting and conversing with the tables on either side of us. If I stretched my arm out, the next table is 1/2-3/4 maximum arm length away. I've been for restaurant week the past two years. The menus have been bland and disappointing...I'm talking 3-4 times. Every time, our pizzas were burnt on some or all of the crust. If I'd been paying full asking price, I'd have been pist. We let it slide cause it was restaurant week lunch price. Decided I won't go back again for restaurant week. But I will return for a \"regular meal\" and brave the madness. I hold dear my memories of drool worthy burrata and mushroom/pork love pizzas. One foot in the grave, Dough, but I have hope still."}, {"review_id": "3lAhe2YpPi2qNsMp-a51hA", "user_id": "7ovXc0TH_Lz1Yg0EU5eFxg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "The food was great!

I could use a huge square to roll up in and take a nap. It is soft, textural, perfectly al dente and delish. The menu features numerous pizza options, appetizers, sandwiches, salads and plates.

Fortunately the rest of our group was on the way and we only waited a few minutes. We sat outside on the patio, even though it was a moderately chilly day - but there were multiple heat lamps and each seat has a wonderful blanket resting on the chair back for you.We had a party of 8: 2 kids, 2 gluten free (celiac) adults and 4 glutenous diet adults. They had something for everyone! I didn't get a salad, but other did and raved about how good they were. It was hard to tell the difference between the GF and regular pizzas except that the 2 gluten free happened to both be Margherita and the rest of us got something different. The crusts were almost identical though! It's difficult to find a good gluten free pizza and this one ranks high, if not on top! The regular pizzas were absolutely scrumptious as well. Post-meal, we skipped dessert (though the menu was quite tempting!) and opted for a round of cappuccinos. Delightfully made; reminiscent of Italy. If you're looking for a specialty coffee third wave cap, this isn't it. But if you want a solid European espresso drink (the closest thing you'll get to a brewed cup of coffee is an Americano) this is it!The staff was great. They're located next to a cool stringed instrument shop. Amazing food.

We ordered the signature pork love and Andrew's pizza. Both of them were so flavorful! The bacon and onion jam on Andrew's pizza was the perfect salty sweet, but we definitely preferred the signature pork love! The sopressata salami on the pizza was my favorite part as it really stood out from the rest of the ingredients on the pizza. The crust and and bread of the pizza tasted so fresh and the marinara was deliciously sweet.

Amazing. TRY THE BURRATA. Before coming here, I had not realized my true love for burrata. To start, we had the burrata trio sampler - it consisted of pesto burrata, plain, and truffle burrata, with a wonderful mixture of sun-dried tomatoes and other things in the middle, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar dotted around it. Out of those, my favorite was truffle burrata, followed by the pesto, and lastly, the plain. After the table finished this trio, I HAD to get another truffle burrata (I'm in love). Despite only containing a small bit of black truffle, the burrata permeates just the right amount of truffle flavor. Additionally, the burrata is extremely creamy, soft, and perfect with the toasted cheese flatbread that comes with it. 10/10.We had another starter - roasted olives with some ricotta on some toasted crostini-like bread. Also delicious, but the burrata is the clear winner here.For pizza, I had the special of the day, a delicious combination of ricotta, ham, spinach, peppers, and this honey-barbeque sauce that I loved. The thin crust has been perfectly baked, and is not too chewy or crunchy. The peppers truly did give the pizza a kick, much to my surprise. For dessert, we had these nutella sandwiches - these weren't bad but they weren't special either. At this point, I was stuffed from burrata so I did not care one way or another :)"}, {"review_id": "SKVnxryP-Wd1UJdltTHTmA", "user_id": "oa2oK8oWk1CmsFveaITC0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "The bursts appetizer was fantastic and the pizzas were delicious.

As a lover of all things cheese and bread, you really can't go wrong with anything on this menu. We always start with a bottle of red (the wine selection is truly great- everything I've ordered is delicious). Do yourself a favor and order the Mozzarella sampler. The variety of flavors is just incredible, but if you have to only choose one- the truffle burrata is my personal favorite. The olive appetizer is also a great touch. Their seasonal salad is also always on my radar- cuts up all the wonderful fats your meal will have and is always unique. My favorite was their fall pear squash salad last fall. Go crazy on the pizza, but don't forget about dessert. I've never had a pizza I didn't like. The specials are always different and wonderful. The desserts are on of my favorite parts of this restaurant- Panna Cotta and Limoncello torta. I might have to go in for just dessert one day. Truly amazing. This restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating (the outdoor even has blankets and heaters, which I think is adorable). The inside is dim lighting in the evenings and seating is pretty close together, but I never remember it being too loud.
