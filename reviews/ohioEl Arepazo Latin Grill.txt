I used to live in South America and while the food here isn't the exact same as having a family cook it for you in their restaurant or while out adventuring, the food here is pretty good. A downtown staple, and not too far of a walk for many on a summer day, I would suggest this place to anyone looking to expand their culinary horizons. A variety of countries, cultures, and palates are represented here with dishes like Lomo Soltado, Arepas, empanadas, tequeños, yuca, etc. Don't come here looking for your taco bell fix, come prepared and with an open mind to try food that is new to you!I would suggest to someone trying this place out for the first time to try the Lomo Soltado or any Arepa, with a side of Yuca to split with some friends. And maybe schedule some time with a friend or trainer at the gym after this delicious comfort food."}, {"review_id": "CSr-5fBgD1iMK8GqxacwKA", "user_id": "cuC4xpS-Rjeg0MWAXUmvFw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "Portions here are enormous - so value is a plus here. One of my coworkers adores El Arepazo, so we have gone several times for lunch. Of everything I've tried, the empanadas are the best, and they are GIANT - can easily split one for two people. The chicken empanadas taste dry to me, so if we are doing empanadas, I prefer the beef or pork. The outside crust is flaky and golden delicious. I've had the lomo saltado entree, and I couldn't decide how I felt about it. Each bite prompted different reactions. The overall flavor was good - the tomato, onion, and potato all tasty. The steak was a bit tough and chewy, and the avocados not quite ripe enough to add anything to the plate. The plantains were a little burnt in my order which made them too bitter for my liking, despite their sweet treatment.Service was quick each time, and the staff handles the expected lunch crowds with apparent ease. It's not my favorite option, but it's worth a visit and definitely a great value. Perhaps I just haven't found my go-to menu item yet."}, {"review_id": "o9uw9VkcqaDX9DkC2YMEBg", "user_id": "ldtxYghu6OLAMxRkkKh3uA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/6/2017", "text": "Great option for the Latino culture in Downtown Columbus Ohio, a mix of Peruvian, Venezuela, and Colombia (SouthAmerica)place, with a good decoration and outside area to eat.  The staffs are super friendly and the food has that touch homemade that your mom or grandma will do on a normal day. In El Arepazo it is good to highlight that although the place has many tables, you must go to the cashier, order and pay for your food before eating it, although at the time of your payment you will be assigned a number where a server will bring your food to your table.The food like I said before is almost like a homemade meal, I can recommend having Lomo Salteado Round z top choice strips sauteéd w/onions, tomatoes, Spanish fries, rice & fried plantains, the amount of food is not very large but not too little, I would say that is decent, the taste is very delicious , the rice is very good the meat was on point and sweet plantains did not have too much grease I really recommend this plate of food, I also had the opportunity to eat the Pabellon Criollo a Venezuelan Platter that comes with  Pabellon Criollo Rice, black beans, shredded beef, fried plantains & arepas.  For me, not beans please!!! with the cashier told me that I could have some French fries instead the plate also was delicious but I prefer the Lomo Salteado more than the Pabellon Criollo."}, {"review_id": "pEYaRpSyT8vjpUxEYP0Lfw", "user_id": "VAWG-hL9g_95YPvMCSvWPQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "Loved it.

Although my supervisor told me to \"choose wisely\" aka choose an expensive af meal you couldn't get for yourself as an undergrad, I could not resist pictures of the Big Mexican burrito and the Peruvian Lomo Saltado... taking the first bite confirmed my decision to go to El Arepazo as a wise one- the caramelized onions and plantains on this god-sent Peruvian meal were everything. Don't get me started on the steak bc it melted at first bite. The portions are decent, the menu has a good variety so I would say this place is good to grab lunch with friends and chill w, especially with the place being tucked inside a giant mural of fierce ducks and other funky artThe only thing yucky was the construction right outside but what's a columbus summer without construction everywhere amiright"}, {"review_id": "7RTupjOQPd7cBkBVopqR9w", "user_id": "SKPUx9rFw6rKXICFCjJWYA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/18/2017", "text": "Wow! I was super surprised by how good the food was. My wife suggested this place and I was skeptical. It's down and ally way that looks a little scary. The space isn't super big but has enough tables as well as seating outside. They staff is small so you have to walk up and place your order at the register. My wife order the chimichurri carne asada which is skirt steak, rice, black beans, fried egg, lettuce, tomato, cheese, avocado, and arepitas for $14. I ordered the mix empanada which comes with chicken, beef, cheese, rice, and beans all inside the empanada. The food was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing.

This food was amazing. And the chimichurri sauce is addictive. I had the steak with tomatoes and vegetables. So good. My daughter who is on the search for the best fish tacos couldn't stop ranting. Hubby has crab cakes and he said they were delish, which is a rare complement. We also have a big empanada, I think it had beef and cheese. Anyway the crust was great and With that sauce? Yum. My only ding is that I am not a fan of places that don't have fountain drinks or that give you that little cup for warm water. It was also a bit hard to find. Like down an alley or something.

I go with the Spicy Fish Tacos or Lomo Saltado, both of which come with their famous creamy Cilantro sauce that adds tons of flavor to every bite.

Yelpers, you did well. El Arepazo was AWESOME.Lomo saltado is one of my favorite dishes overall, and this place did great! Think of it as a Spanish stir fry. There are onions, tomatoes, french fries, and beef tenderloin. I ordered mine spicy, and it had a nice mild kick. It comes with Cilantro sauce, and I advise that you smother your entire dish in it. IT'S SO GOOD! They even sell it in larger quantities (12 oz). My lomo saltado was served with plantains and rice, with sliced avocado on top.My boyfriend ordered the cuban. It came with deliciously crispy fries, but I wish they'd added more mustard on his sandwich. It was a little dry for our taste.Definitely a must-try, but make sure you don't have big plans after eating here. I highly recommend going home, because you will eat yourself into a food coma."}, {"review_id": "vc4Pqx39AsiCaNh-NtxRfQ", "user_id": "JzP5uJjhZb0Vj8J_bn3mOg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/12/2015", "text": "Ah! No really, ahhhh, so good!!I've been looking for someplace to eat empanadas for like, oh, five years! Their is no place in Columbus that specializes in this dish :( So, the other nite, chatting with Bryant M., the topic of good empanadas came up, and his suggestion was El Arepazo. Since I've only been to the downtown Arepazo one other time (and I didn't even know they served empanadas), I thought what better time than a sunny Friday afternoon to make it happen. I got to the **small** joint around 11:20 am, and the ordering line was already starting to grow. Luckily it gave me just enough time to pursue the menu and decide what I wanted to try. I got one Ckicken Empanada and the Peruvian Lomo Saltado entree. Holy cow, all the Reviews I've read are exactly right, the Empanada was ginormous! The chicken was so tender! Slightly seasoned. Not spicy. I drizzled some of the cilantro sauce on it as I downed that sucker. I am so ecstatic I finally found these $4 morsels of ecstasy! I've gotta try their Mixed Empanada next time.I had no idea the huge size of their empas, and was totally full after that. I had to get my entree in a to-go container, and ate if for dinner! Warmed it up in the micro. STILL had mondo flavor - good doesn't even begin to describe the bold flavors of the onions/tomatoes/skirt steak! Mixed the rice and avocado in to make one jumble. So good. Just... So so so freaking good!! Oh, yeah, and the reheated plantains? Outta this world!"}, {"review_id": "50zeuxhkKWHrnHdzZ1pSqg", "user_id": "FelbhpeYBWl_m25H4pwgZA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/6/2017", "text": "When happy hour calls, Wine Down Thursday can't be beat.

The fish was cooked perfect and it came with rice, beans, and a side salad. It also came with this house made Cilantro sauce that was awesome. I covered my fish in it and it was amaze balls.  I really enjoyed this food. My husband said his burrito with plantains was very good. He has had Latin food before and said it was authentic. My only complaint though is that it is a little pricy. For the both of us to eat and we ordered 2 bottles of water, it was $28 for lunch. Overall, if ever in Columbus again we would come back.
