But it's also worth calling out that they were the kind of business you want to support. I was in town on business and sat at the bar alone. One of the owners happened to sit next to me. I observed the respect and friendliness among him and the employees. He was humble and kind. When I accidentally knocked my beer over and broke the glass, it wasn't a scene, and he gave me another half beer. It was great- give it a try!!"}, {"review_id": "7cb9lq5KpnCDYaBE6nsPmg", "user_id": "is89Hl1aR0U2fn2fC8VlQA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/10/2017", "text": "You can get whatever you want here, as long as what you are wanting is beer and pizza.  The pies are in the flatbread style and are big enough to fend off almost any appetite (probably big enough for 2 moderate appetites).  Beer selection includes local varieties and global favorites.Service is great.  Very friendly staff that understands expedience."}, {"review_id": "9mf8i-8JN1oibd0hDJYY6A", "user_id": "WHGjqjqBFXkFyF8UjXwP8Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/8/2017", "text": "Independent Ale House is a great, no-nonsense Ale house with good beer and flat breads. Walking in the door, there is no question what I'm going to eat and drink: beer & pizza and that's alright by me. (Side note... they also have salads but I didn't feel like a salad so I can't speak to them.)There is nothing too special about the bar itself; fairly narrow with some tables on one wall and the bar on the other. The bar has some TVs and a large chalk board with all of the beer selections written out. There were probably 50 selections in all so there was definitely something for everyone.  There were a bunch of flatbreads to choose from but I went for the three piggy flatbread, a signature selection. It was exactly what I needed after a long day of work. My only complaint would be to the lack of a dessert menu, but that is minor compared to the excellent experience otherwise. Plus it's in downtown Rapid City so within easy walking distance of a couple of great creameries. Yum. Next time I'm in Rapid City, you'll know where to find me, sitting at the bar enjoying pizza and beer."}, {"review_id": "GGb_qobZs0xwznf4KeGyfw", "user_id": "7XlgegWDpBJkBCpilCdN6w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Large selection of brews and delicious, eclectic selection of pizza, what more could you ask for?"}, {"review_id": "EtK3E0maMXKdqOZccolB9w", "user_id": "TNe0haVlEBMAf7StCFuzRg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "This is a tough spot to pick up a table.  Always busy.  The pizzas are to die for.  Large and good for sure.   Great selection of beers which makes it one of my favorite places in rapid city"}, {"review_id": "FfTvMt9VMdBJv-eFpMYgCw", "user_id": "Cg-mtLddNSzKUn7Y_btjdg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Great place to go for a beer downtown!

I can probably rate it a 4 because of the food option (they have three salads and only pizza), but that's their thing so I can't diss them for it. The pizza was interesting. The cardiac arrest was normal, the one I got had jalapeño bacon cream cheese and raspberry jam, which was surprisingly yummy. They have tons of beer. I got the blueberry beer and my hubs got a hops that tasted like passion fruit mixed w hops to me but he didn't think so. It's a small place and it looks pretty new. Server was pretty nice. It's one of the only places that I found open later than 9pm."}, {"review_id": "v7PmPluSBFXNSEWcqvUXUA", "user_id": "e9UKDjFkzWpZ3_QnsZGX1g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/15/2017", "text": "Very large selection of beers displayed on tv screens that run on a loop--I think I found my desired cider at number 33.  Good pizza, kinda flatbread style, with some pretty unique ingredient combinations, as well as the traditional options.

Although this place is labeled as not being kid friendly on yelp, I would disagree (at least for dinner). There were at least two other parties with children and the restaurant is very relaxed.

With the name of the place, I thought they might have some of their own brews but didn't; & they don't have many local beers either which was disappointing. Most were Wyoming, Montana, & other state beers. I always enjoy trying local brews when I'm visiting someplace, but if that's not something you look for, I'd recommend this place."}, {"review_id": "0QZVUcoFaC7UB6jd7MyNXQ", "user_id": "6JL4oV-BAUA0qhnGVv77hg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2017", "text": "Ugh, I'm craving their delicious pizza right now. I want that jalapeño cream cheese pizza with jelly. I thank them for introducing me to this wonderful combination of ingredients on a pizza. I was introduced to grilled cheese and jelly years ago and thought that was great. This takes the cake. It might not be for everyone but if your adventurous with you food, go for it. We also tried a pizza with olives. It was very good as well. The beer selection was nice. They have a system that tells you the type, color, contents, alcohol % basically all the details. It even tells you how much is left in the keg. This place wins.

The pizzas are personal sized and perfect for getting a few and sharing. My only complaint was that the pizza crust could have been a little crispier- but I think that's more personal preference and to be fair I could have asked for it to be left in a few extra moments and I did not. They do have an excellent selection of beer on tap! If you love beer then you'll be in heaven here! The servers are friendly and quick and we'd definitely return if we are ever in the area again."}, {"review_id": "m1q0HAH9tKA8gOtHurjNfg", "user_id": "CQyN3l8KelnpsV5r8D3__g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/29/2016", "text": "Cannot even express how much we loved Independent Ale House! First of all, they had every Bell's beer imaginable on tap...shoutout to Kalamazoo and the best Michigan Brewery!We sat at the bar, and the bartender was awesome and friendly. We ordered two pizzas: the cheeseburger and the jalapeño popper. THE PIZZA IS SO UNIQUE AND AMAZING. It's much less of a pizza and more of a pizza bread with toppings. The ones we had didn't have traditional sauce and it's served more similarly to pizza bread. I was nervous to see how well the unique toppings would be executed, and they did an amazing job. I mean, like a delicious Big Mac on a pizza?! Yes please! The jalapeño popper wasn't on the menu, but they had it. The jalapeños had the perfect level of zing, the smoked meat gave a great flavor, and the raspberry sauce was a perfect touch. This is absolutely a must try place in Rapid City!! I wished they had something local on tap, but they seem to rotate their offerings frequently.
