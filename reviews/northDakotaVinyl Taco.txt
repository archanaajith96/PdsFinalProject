We had the fired tortilla bites. They came with two sauces one was a orange chili sauce and the other a cream sauce. Both were awesome! The bites were very spicy but I liked that. My wife on the other hand wasn't a fan.We both ordered tacos and they came out stuffed and delicious. Basically the perfect taco. I got the barbacoa taco and it was delicious. My wife had the chicken and she also complimented how great they were.The ambiance is relaxed and great music. They have two locations but the one I was at is located in downtown."}, {"review_id": "MgrGvdQalg2T6V4s4y5Krw", "user_id": "9N0eKiaaLAWk2tYLfKUyUg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "First joint on my hit list is Vinyl Taco. Not your average Mexican joint, they have crazy creations like chicken skin chicharrones with Habenero BBQ sauce and jalapeño ranch. I had 3 tacos, crispy fish with sriracha tartar sauce red slaw with Serrano pepper and avocado salsa. pork belly agridulche a crazy fried slaw and au jus was delicious. Crispy chicken and mango that says it all.Well almost all... they play entire albums start to finish of your classic rock favorites. I heard CCR, Clapton, and Aerosmith during my dinner. Definitely a funky food find.Service was great but I wasn't acknowledged when I first walked in but once the ball was rolling my waitress was spot on the food came out fast  and everything was delicious. Every worker was moving and doing their thing except one girl who stood at the corner of the bar and hardly moved"}, {"review_id": "rITyPgZ3V2p9Qm6G2zNpzg", "user_id": "P9bzEKtt0cJ54eY-CPJhaQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Tacos are good but small.

A great taco shop in Fargo? Can you possibly be serious? And of course, when all the locals said it was great, I just smiled to myself and thought they were being homers. But then a transplant from Texas looked at me and said, \"I didn't believe it either, but that place is legit.\" I was sold. We were on our way.Vinyl Taco is a gaudy, kitsch, Mexican food joint that serves unique, ala carte tacos with cocktails and good beer. They have a cactus strung with with green Christmas lights and a giant silver bison over the bar, the menus are glued to the back of old album covers, and they play classic rock (hence the name). It may not look like much from the outside, but it's sheer tacky awesomeness inside. My kind of place. Their margaritas are fresh and strong, the queso  has great heat and consistency without being overbearing, and the taco menu offers some amazing flavors. Being a westerner I went with the fish taco, which is very good but fairly expected. What blew me away though was the pork belly served with an au jus. And the steak fajita, and the chicken with tomatillo, onion and cilantro were all amazing. But the pork belly was transcendent.If you find yourself in Fargo, and have a hankering for some good Mexican food, or just a nice bar, Vinyl Taco is a must. Great food, great service, and a terrific vibe. Highly recommended!"}, {"review_id": "ic518l2ZfNSIiEEaYUtt6w", "user_id": "1DhKvepHRNKs3aUw6NSOKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/18/2017", "text": "Best tacos I've had in months.

Ordered queso, chips and salsa, a Cadillac margarita and a dos equis to start. Red salsa was good queso was great and drinks hit the spot. On the way of vegatrisn options there's one, the vegetarian Taco. The vegetarian Taco was good. I asked if they could make me bean or cheese enchiladas because I'm vegetarian and the waitress looked at me like I was an alien and said they only make them beef or chicken. My face must have looked confused and she said she would ask the kitchen. They did make me cheese enchiladas, cheese and onion only and I hate onion so meh the queso sauce was good. My friend ordered the chicken tortilla soup and said it was good. Our waitress never stopped back to see how the food was or to ask if we wanted another drink and I had to flag her down for the bill so I would say the service was severely lacking. All and all the place had a pretty decent vibe. If I lived in Fargo I would probably give it another chance because it does seems like a decent casual bar."}, {"review_id": "fkaY3OCGCris3WdZMpdiqA", "user_id": "rjoiUbF3ZQ79nH07p8S6xw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Really unique, like the variety.

Both salsas tasted a bit like water. Will avoid next time.* Gringo taco - overall, the tortilla and beef were a little dry. I really could have used some salsa here but, alas, see bullet point above.* Chicken tortilla soup - delicious. I could have consumed the entire vat. I wanted 7 more bowls. Will order a double helping next time.No alcohol this trip but I do see myself returning here and will partake in an adult beverage or two. I loved the atmosphere and the fact that we could sit at a table on the sidewalk and not have homeless people begging for food or money as would happen if Vinyl Taco was in Seattle. So, if that is not worth one star in itself, I don't know what is!Along with my double helping of chicken tortilla soup, I will also order the buffalo chicken taco and at least one other speciality taco. Or maybe the enchiladas. Will have to play that one by ear. The options are endless at Vinyl Taco."}, {"review_id": "V9aLkshwkk-XL_v23yNIAA", "user_id": "jAVtSgE5L-Dt6_I5FIiVGA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "Very cool place.

We were out tasting brews and decided that, having passed by 100x and not stopping, it was time. We expected to find loads of college patrons gobbling up cheap tacos. That was somewhat accurate. There were plenty of college age patrons, in addition to people twice our age. We also found inexpensive food that was surprisingly not \"cheap tacos\" - customizable individual items. I had a black butte porter with pork belly taco and the hubs had 2 hearted with chicken cilantro taco side of black beans and we split guacamole and chips - wrapped up with churro waffles and ice cream (amazing) -- we were not disappointed - at all... pricing allows adding for larger appetites or going small. Staff were friendly and prompt. We'll be back. Great music, atmosphere and food.
