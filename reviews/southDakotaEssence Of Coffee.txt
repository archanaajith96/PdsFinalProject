I was looking for a place to get a decent cup of coffee and breakfast, and knew it had to be early since my toddler is an early riser. The Internet suggested this place, and man, am I glad it did!As someone who worked in coffeeshops and restaurants for nine years, my experience has been that you don't often find a place that does espresso AND food equally well. Sure, a great restaurant can have some solid drip, or might break out the French press, but they don't usually have a well-trained barista on staff. On the flip side, coffee shops may have tasty treats and satisfying quick breakfast items like quiche and breakfast burritos, but you generally wouldn't call it great food.Essence of Coffee is the best of both worlds. Every drink I got there--drip, americano, espresso, mocha--was amazing. Every meal I got there was also stellar. I went two or three times in the couple of days I was in Rapid City, and even wandered over from Custer--just for their coffee and food. This was a family vacation, and everyone on the trip was equally obsessed.I get emails from them thanks to Square, and every time it makes me a little sad that I'm not in Rapid City enjoying a hot drink right now."}, {"review_id": "EDTbf1A7m6rFA8k05zPh-g", "user_id": "d-Gqlej30b9jgRQKWJe4yw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Must do if you are visiting or live in Rapid City! Wow is all I can say about the breakfasts that I had! I'm particular about my food quality and this was perfection! We split the Apple and Sausage Hash with a side of hash browns. I wanted to go back and order 20 hash browns. Best I've ever had an I love hash browns. My husband and I had to go a second time before we left Rapid City on to our next stop during our cross country road trip. Staff was friendly and I seriously want to come back to Rapid City just for this place. Well, the whole city was cool and South Dakota as a whole was one of our favorite states on our drive! Hope I get back here sometime soon! It is a must do if you're visiting or local!"}, {"review_id": "bMoP11kuFtPZH7WXit7zhw", "user_id": "8W0pxni8FwSurMtSxYmSig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "Spent 4 days in SD and we were thrilled to find this place. Chemex Tanzanian Peaberry was awesome. Like drinking a great glass of wine. The beans were freshly roasted and you can really taste the difference. Had the Sriracha breakfast sandwich and was so happy with the mix of sweet savory spicy flavors. Staff was crazy friendly and helpful. Can't say enough good things about this place!"}, {"review_id": "rPbypZcpn7t-7YZoZFMj_g", "user_id": "J7xfPnLSszk8jilmlQRNfw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "Friendly staff, and very unique breakfast menu.

Perfect spot to sit outside on a nice day and enjoy a coffee. Their steak salad is easily the best salad in town. Super tasty and a great quick lunch. The avocado open face is also amazing.

Amazing cappuccino made with house made almond milk. I enjoy going to coffee roasters and coffee shops when I travel. This cappuccino was in the top 5 of places I've tried.

Carry out also available. Great for work or school meet ups and just chillin, reading a book. Avocado Open-Face sandwich and Mediterranean Sandwich are my faves...great alone or with a little sriracha to add a little spice. Berry french toast is perfect comfort food. You can order in advance online, too, or set up coffee bean orders for your own usage.

I'm beyond pleased with my iced latte. The milk that's used is fantastic, and the espresso wasn't bitter. It's a cute shop with a larger than expected breakfast menu. They have both a chalkboard menu and a paper menu, the paper menu with the descriptions of the food. The staff was friendly, without going overboard. I can only handle so much before I drink some coffee! I ordered the avocado open face. I was told it's a very popular menu item. It was certainly different with fresh ingredients. I want expecting the sweet in the mix, and I might have them hold it in the future, although I'm not sure what was sweet, haha. Great egg and avocado! I will absolutely be back next time I come to Rapid!"}, {"review_id": "6VL-11TJKeglkYzOMabdGA", "user_id": "qKx0RRPxSEdhVG8oHpygjA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/11/2017", "text": "Great little coffee shop.
