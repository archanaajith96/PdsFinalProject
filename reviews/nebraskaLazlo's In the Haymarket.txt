Trip Advisor ranked it on top 10 of 500 restaurants in the area so I decided to witness the hype. I attended around 5pm. Perfect time because by 6 it was filling up and by 6:30 it was packed for a Friday evening.Phenomenal customer service. Eye contact and smiles all around. The server advised us (party of 2) just to settle for half order of onion rings because she was right that was certainly enough.I had the bacon guacamole burger. It was amazing. If I go back I want to try the widow maker.  I wasn't sure what beer to consume but I was in luck because they give up to 3 samples. I ended up choosing the Dark Side (vanilla porter). It was good but nothing compares to Dragons Milk.As the restaurant became more packed our attentive server was not visible as much but that should be expected. I bet this location is incredible during Husker football games."}, {"review_id": "gKitWMpSUvDj5APLtqNjkw", "user_id": "SFqTfyrnjYB8LMqwlNq_pA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "As the place was almost empty at 4:30, I asked to sit by a nice window. Hostess still stuck me in another area right next to the one family-occupied table. Ordered my steak medium rare. It came super fast before I had even eaten 1/4 of my salad. Terrible coordination. Was bloody red  and cold center. Not even close but the waitress never came back to check on how my steak was until she asked about dessert. The baked potato \"butter\" I asked for on the side was margarine. Unbelievable. Who eats margarine??As solo traveler passing through, I definitely got the \"tourist\" experience restaurant. Crappy. Barely above a chain like Chili's. But, this is the Midwest and the level of taste and expectation matched the typical native's desire, I suppose. A lifetime in SoCal has my palate expecting far more, even for the budget $24 filet mignon."}, {"review_id": "pL5IiB1OVhrAlzM7xEoGRg", "user_id": "Illd7w5e2U25AcFzU9H6Dg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "I tried Lazlo's for the first (&last) time yesterday.They have to be 'home of the worst Rueben sandwich'.Here's a cooking tip for you....loading up extra salt onto your French fries does not make up for the lack of heat.I would have told all this to my server, but she went M.I.A. on us. Had to be 10 minutes after the food runner dropped off our meals before she decided to check in with us. By that point, I was already regretting the decision to skip Leadbelly's to try this place.Why the two stars and not just one? I could see the other food servers in nearby sections being great with their tables. I was able to flag one guy down to help us in lieu of our POS server, but not his responsibility to work our table too.Beer was ok...Water glass was dirty...Had some crusty junk caked onto the rim of the glass.If you're thinking of growing here, look around the corner.  There are several other better choices."}, {"review_id": "Wv4uYzOB2XXoVUUrMRiB_Q", "user_id": "_FYyzArjOBzzySUrtkos_Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I love this place, been here so many times as I'm here from California - I think someone is new at this but the beer is fantastic and I'll be back Hopefully"}, {"review_id": "1cmge8VaAoXfneAyKfZo9w", "user_id": "pozrBI9PGiw7i6XYUHD9rw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "Came in tonight with a large group for a meeting and I was so impressed with the friendly service. Our waiter was so attentive but also noninvasive while we were conversing - a real beverage ninja. I ordered the barramundi with a side of sautéed green beans and tomato basil soup. I'm generally not a big soup fan but this soup was unreal, it tasted like grilled cheese in a bowl. The barramundi was good and had great flavor from the grill.

Came here for a quick bite before heading to the game and wasn't disappointed a bit.The atmosphere with everybody showing up for the games was nice, and the food was equally awesome. If you've never tried a lahvosh, this is a must at this place.. think Matzah flatbread + pizza. For only ~$10 you get way more food than you would think, easily shareable between 2 people.Their beer selection is pretty stacked due to them being attached to Empyrean brewing co, I ended up trying their Long Butte PB Porter which was pretty fantastic!Overall cool place, great food, and nice vibes on game day!!"}, {"review_id": "19B2D8E6D-iXiaC4_688Qw", "user_id": "0bJo3U6C14PfZU0ujjg6ug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Never had a bad experience.

Have never been disappointed; the rainbow chicken with wild rice is my favorite! Neutral: parking obviously is a negative because it's in the haymarket. Nine times out of ten the parking will all be taken and you'll have to walk quite a distance, so plan for that.Negative: Drinks are great but mixed alcohol drinks are or in pretty small glasses and the price tag is large.

All the locals recommended Lazlo's. And \"get the steak\" of course. The steak was very flavorful, and super juicy. I'm not adamant for juicy steak but I appreciate it when I get it. Got it for a low price here, too! The mash potatoes were good, and I really enjoyed the free beer bread (just ask, as stated on the menu). I tried the beer cheese soup, which I thought was very special but way too cheesy for me to finish. Felt like I was drinking a sharp cheddar queso.

So me and my friends decided to go to LAZLOS. we ordered LAVOUSH with barbecue chicken and another with ranch and vegetables for appetizers. Those were reaaaaaaaaally goooooood ! A must thing to get if you go there. My main course was a TOP SIRLOIN steak, medium well cooked. It was pretty good, just would preferred it to be a little bit bigger when compared with its price. I liked the loaded backed potato along with a super delicious sauce. I think it was garlic ranch or something like that. My friend got the salmon and it was pretty good too. The waitress was super friendly and recommended us the lavoush. Over all the entire atmosphere was amazing. It would make a great place for friends night out or even a date night.

We had been working a 12 hour day with very little to eat. We were getting to the point where we were seeing stars and things were fuzzy. Recommended by a local, we were headed to Leadbelly when someone told us that Lazlo's was a better option. We headed directly there with no time to waste. We decided on Lazlo's for a burger and fries. When we entered, it was a Wednesday night at about 7:30 PM and the place was slammed. The hostess told us it was going to be a 20 to 25 minute wait. It ended up being about a half hour. We waited patiently, or truly impatiently as our stomachs twisted and turned. There were only three of us so we were able to get a good seat by the window. It's took a while for anybody to come up to us. Finally, when somebody did - it seemed like it wasn't her table and she was just asking if we had been helped yet. She took our drink and food orders right away. Our food took about a half hour to get out. Again we all got burgers and fries. I got the Lazlo burger. I always choose whatever burger the restaurant puts their name on. I added avocado and got sweet potato fries. My burger was delicious. I wasn't done eating, when the waitress came around and grabbed my plate. I was just taking a break and there was clearly food still on my plate. Maybe because the two girls I was with were already done she figured I was. She still should've asked. The service wasn't great, it didn't seem like a clean place, it seemed very unprofessionally run. The prices were very in expensive, though. We are still surprised by that being from Los Angeles!  I know where I can move if I ever want to save money. The food was good-you want barfood like a burger, pizza, chicken tenders, etc. I don't know if you got a full-blown meal if it would be any good. I wasn't dazzled by this place whatsoever, but it is in a really great location in the center of town. Not sure of the parking because we walked. It is very central in the middle of the Haymarket district and we went to Ivanna Cones and got homemade ice cream after. Will post that review tomorrow!"}, {"review_id": "bkR9vKSn5jXOKtADz3-rZA", "user_id": "uALx5Fzs3_T8lcCQLOXNiA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/10/2016", "text": "Great place for a meat eater on a budget.
