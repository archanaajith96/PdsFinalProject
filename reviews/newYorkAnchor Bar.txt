I have been here more times than I can count but have never ordered anything other than wings! I have had pizza too but it was ordered by someone else. If you are not from Buffalo, the wings will be better than almost any other wing that you had before. Traditional Buffalo style with that crispy, greasy, Frank's hot sauce deliciousness. If you are from Buffalo, Anchor bar is probably the 5-7 ranked wing place in the city. Still great food though!"}, {"review_id": "hFnL3Tofx10WUyjJR5o6pQ", "user_id": "JChx-48PcGZjD1OE7O69VQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Came here with a group of four and were seated within about 20 minutes.

Hostess didn't even look up to great us. Just asked if we needed a table for 2. My daughter was in the restroom, so we told her 3. She lashes out and demanded that everyone be present before being seated. Mind you, this is 4:00 on a Thursday afternoon. There were 4 tables occupied. Waitress came to take our order and must have been trained by the same master. Didn't smile, took my menu before I could order (or finish reading the story about how the buffalo wing was invented), and looked like she could whoop my ass (I'm a 6'5\" big boy).  I was very quickly brought a Southern Tier IPA. My attitude began to change. We started with the fried pickles. Unlike any I've had, cut like french fries, battered and served with some delicious sauce. Wife got an openfaced sausage sandwich. It looked phenomenal and she said it tasted great. Daughter got the boneless wings (apparently from chicken without bones) that she really enjoyed. I am a bit of a wing snob, so I remained pessimistic. I like them crispy and wet. Ordered the hot ones. They did not disappoint. Both crispy and swimming in sauce. Came with blue cheese and celery (which I didn't want...celery and fried food just doesn't work for me), but the dressing was over the top. CHUNKS of blue cheese that would have impressed a steak lover on top of their ribeye. I actually had to drill the little chicken wing into the chunks to break them up. $13 is a lot to pay for 10 wings, but I'm glad I did. Next time ask if I want the celery so you don't waste it on me. You could feed the starving children in Africa with it. Or better yet, take the money you save and use it to buy customer service training for the staff."}, {"review_id": "jYMIRnalQbQr-Isu0Vl7XA", "user_id": "0kPfZz9R1_0f7vYSXglF8Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "Finally, got to try the Home of Original Buffalo wings. We visited Anchor Bar during our trip to Niagara falls. The place is located in the heart of downtown Buffalo. The decor of the place is very interesting. We were there on a Saturday evening and it seemed like there was live music.We sat at the bar and ordered 2 dozen original wings. They do not allow mix n match. Also, they were a bit stingy about ranch and blue cheese dressing. That I did not like.The wings were fine and tasty. I would come back here again. Wing sauce was great.

I came here once and to be honest, customer service wasn't superb. Once we were seated, it took almost 20 minutes to be asked if we wanted water and this was during a time where not many customers were around. Once the order was placed, it took almost another 30 minutes to receive our order. So in regards to wait time and customer service, not the best. However, the wings and the quality of the food was decent. The flavors weren't too overwhelming and the chicken was super tender. I'm not a huge fan of spicy and often times, mild may still be spicy for those who can't handle it. In this location, mild was actually bearable which was great! I also got the garlic parm. and it was delicious. The flavors matched the tenderness of the chicken very well."}, {"review_id": "pHNmVyI-lCJag-LUjtTGBw", "user_id": "p-3GcxiOW6NDvrFq3Z0HVQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "I went on a trip to Buffalo for the hockey world junior tournament the last week in December. Before I arrived I did some research on places to eat and Anchor Bar was the first on the list.  I have to say, it did not disappoint. We went after the USA/Canada outdoor hockey game so the bar was filled with American and Canadian fans. The line was a big wait but luckily we ended up getting a spot at the bar. First glimpse of the bar was very dive bar(ish) but that's my style, I love those places. We ended up having a few beers, ordered wings and enjoyed the warmth. The wings: Very very good. They are not breaded, which is different, but apparently that's how they do it in Buffalo and that's how the original wings are made. The wings were good size and had great flavor. I really enjoyed the sauce the most. I ended up getting hot sauce since the bartender told me even their medium isn't hot. It was perfect temperature for a typical mild to medium sauce eater. I enjoyed it so much I brought home a bottle of their sauce. All in all, I really enjoyed his place. If I ever go back to Buffalo I'll be dining there again."}, {"review_id": "B_0fyC9O_UXC2DA3Luop4Q", "user_id": "jCXVfltMEe5QFiypcYlRfA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "First time here and from Vegas.

It's actually quite shocking if I'm being perfectly honest. I like my wings to be crunchy, and I put in a request that the be crunchy, but that was far from the case when I received them. I also received cold food. The service could use some fine-tuning as well. It's very slow. There was a moment when we had to request a new drink because our server dipped his fingers in there while attempting to bring multiple drinks over at once. That was a minor infraction, the other was when he kept scratching at his nose, and I wasn't certain if he washed or sanitized his hands afterward. I'm sorry, it just made me cringe a bit. The environment itself is nice. It has a great vibe when you walk in. It's just the food and the service needs some work. It also makes me sad that people associate buffalo wings with the Anchor Bar name, but you can get better wings elsewhere. You can't ride on the name alone, you have to bring the quality food too."}, {"review_id": "hmq4EiawP4WAon7rQ1cwtQ", "user_id": "7R73YNcPggFfSc85VfJLGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "we order buffalo wings and pepperoni pizza.

Yeah baby, bring it on! Went there on a Saturday night during our visit to Niagara. They have a really cool decor with motor bikes hanging from the walls. We got the original buffalo wings (ofcourse!) and yes, they were pretty good. Not out of the world but pretty good. There's no mixing and matching of flavors. You just get one flavor for 2 dozen wings. There was a live music there when we went but we just waited long enough to get our take out. They sell their wing sauces in a store attached to the restaurant. I think I will return for the vibes of the place.

There's a battle between Anchor Bar vs Duff's Famous Wings on which one sells the best wings in town. I think that's something you will have to decide for yourself, but I like Anchor Bar a bit better because (1) Anchor Bar's wings had more balanced flavors and (2) wings from Duff's were way more saucier than Anchor Bar's and I don't like too much sauce.My friends and I arrived to the restaurant at 6:30 PM and the parking lot was completely packed. Luckily I was able to quickly spot a space to park within 5 minutes. The waiting line was pretty long, but we only waited about 30 minutes. As you wait, feel free to check out the gift shop as well as different license plates hanging on the walls. Live music on Thursday 7 PM ~ 9 PM and Sunday 5 PM ~ 7 PM & live Jazz on Friday / Saturday from 9 PM ~ 11 PM. The restaurant doesn't take reservation unless you have a party of 10 or more.Service was a bit slow and our waitress didn't seem happy when I asked whether I can split single order (single = 10 wings) into two flavors. So you can't get more than 1 flavor unless you order a bucket (bucket = 50 wings). Huge selection of food, but the front page of menu is all you really need if you only want to order Anchor Bar's signature items - Buffalo wings.***Single (10 wings + traditional celery + bleu cheese, mild spicy with medium spicy sauce on the side - $13): Other than somewhat of dry wings, bleu cheese and buffalo sauce were on the point and not overpowering. Buffalo sauce had the right combination of sourness and savory taste.Original Anchor Bar Spicy Hot Chicken Wing Soup (cup of soup, $5.50): It tasted very much like Buffalo wing chowder. Chicken wings were chopped into small pieces and soup had a savory and creamy Buffalo sauce taste (slight vinegary and spicy). It was actually a pretty delicious soup!***Other than somewhat underwhelming service, wings were much better than I anticipated and I enjoyed eating these tasty wings!"}, {"review_id": "mPnTOcTXvqXm-KhBsEds1g", "user_id": "lOn4Hj2u4-8hy8JTJ3idMQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/25/2017", "text": "I honestly feel like the best part of the visit was the chill atmosphere and the decor.

We happened to be in the Buffalo, NY, area so we made sure to go during our trip. The decor is eclectic, with a bunch of license plates, motorcycles and photos of famous patrons on the wall. We were seated immediately as it wasn't very busy. My husband and I both got the single order of wings (10 pieces) - hot and mild. My parents, who were with us, got an order of wings, side salad, and a regular salad -- which would have fed 4 people it was so huge! So my husband and I both love wings - we eat them as much as possible and love to try them at different restaurants. Knowing this was the \"original\" wing, we had some expectations, but I had heard from some locals there are better wings out there. Yes, the wings are good - very crispy and large. I got the mild and didn't feel like I had any sauce on my wings, so more dry than I am used to. My husband said his \"hot\" were barely medium, so I am wondering how hot their suicidal is. My parents bought a bunch of their sauce for christmas gifts, which you can do in the little gift shop in the front.

Decor was definitely up to par to a place with so much history and added to the unique experience, menu is expansive and has much more than just wings with pasta, salads, and a huge variety of appetizers and sides. But let's get straight to the point because we all are really just interested in the wings. Now I love a good buffalo wing from other places, and so I would have assumed I would be drooling over the original. I ordered the medium and the sauce was perfection, perfectly spicy, perfectly buttery, no complaints at all. My only disappointment is in the wing itself. The chicken wings were.... skinny and without enough meat on the bones. A few were also fried to the point where it was too much work to eat the hard bits. Perhaps my expectations were skewed because of the way buffalo wings have become so mainstream and that so many other restaurants have changed their recipes and used different quality of chicken. Overall, the sauce is absolutely perfect and definitely recommend. I did end up buying a bottle to take home myself :)"}, {"review_id": "KdUFt4SWMa0DiEbRZD0aaQ", "user_id": "0AaIzRQtwHliTIq8q-lbRw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "No place to go but the original place for Buffalo wings right?
