Some great games and a cool fish tank when you walk in. It was my first time going to a cherry cricket so I did the make your own burger. The toppings are very pricey - $1 for a slice of cheese is a little bit over the top. But of course a burger needs cheese so I had to get some. The biggest let down was the $1.25 for \"candied bacon & jalapeño jelly\". Man this was seriously disappointing. It sounds really good like it would be a strip of candied bacon topped with jalapeño jelly or something. But it was a few 1 cm strips of bacon in a clear gelatin with a few pieces of diced jalapeño. I wish I had know that or I would have chosen a better topping. Overall it is just over priced burgers that were good but not great."}, {"review_id": "GTpjI58z0iRZu6bZSXyZFQ", "user_id": "hMCdGj-5RFcMkCA4bE28Cg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "On a trip to Denver to visit my sister, my wife and I took a visit to Cherry Cricket per my sister's recommendation. We had read some great reviews from fellow Yelpers and were quite excited to give this place a shot. When we arrived, there was about a 30 minute wait for the four of us. We put our names down and decided to spend some time walking around the area. When we came back about 30 minutes later, our table was ready for us right on schedule. At first, I was impressed by the size of this place (there are several rooms with what I imagine is around 100 tables). A few minutes after being seated, our server (Matt) came by to take drink orders. I passed on the alcohol with the intention of ordering a milkshake after the meal, though others at the table ordered some alcoholic options (and enjoyed them).Taking a look at options for food, it was clear that a build-your-own burger was a must. I created what essentially ended up being a classic American cheeseburger (although with Swiss cheese). My wife and I also split the \"Frings\" (a basket of French fries and onion rings). Burgers are made to order, so we each ordered our burgers as desired (all 4 of us ordered burgers). What I also love is that you can select the size and type of patty (including 1/2 pound, 1/4 pound or 1/3 pound beef burger, 1/3 pound turkey burger, 1/3 pound bison burger, 1/3 pound veggie burger, chicken, or hot dog). Prices for all the above are average.When we finally received our meals, my wife and I were both disappointed. The French fries were dry and chewy, as were our burgers. The onion rings were perhaps the bright spot. Still, the food left me with a bit of a knot in my stomach.The best part of our meal, though? The chocolate shake! Complete with whipped cream and a cherry, the shake was truly delicious (I always admire a burger place that can get a shake right).Service here was also good, as was the ambiance (loved the retro atmosphere). Nothing to rave about, but our server Matt and the rest of the staff was friendly and upbeat.I'm not sure Cherry Cricket would be on the top of my list on a return visit, but I was certainly glad we gave this place a try."}, {"review_id": "1hHDteZmAwwOrH3yhHPKoA", "user_id": "P_Nvn60Gmup5XcOWbOOagg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "A great burger in Denver!!

Just how I like it.We are talking about burgers and queso, get your mind out of the gutter!Cherry Cricket was on my bookmarks list right when I moved to Denver. Unfortunately they had a fire and were shut down for quite some time. Looks like they re-opened last spring and have been overrun with excited customers ever since. Never once have I gone by and not seen a line out the door.Don't let the lines deter you, though. Two people on a Saturday afternoon were seated at a booth within 10 minutes. That's not a bad wait at all! If you're in a bigger party, it might be closer to 15-20 minutes during the busy times. However, if you can hold off until that \"in-between\" time for restaurants (2-4 pm), it's not bad at all!Get a burger. Get queso. Get steak fries. Yes, I ate all of them. And drank two margaritas. After a Saturday morning spin class and a few meetings, I earned every calorie consumed. And I was so full, I didn't eat dinner that night. Pro tip: 1/4 lb burger is still very large and very filling. Unless you have an extremely large appetite, go for the smaller version so you can indulge in all the carb-tastic sides."}, {"review_id": "qMmES_9EYXpX5pc-QMoYIw", "user_id": "c05gJZEqDDtrSPMyzFGjrA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "One of the best burgers in Denver, hands-down.

This place is deceptively large and looks like they have added extensions over the years. Cherry Cricket oozes charm and personality at every turn! Tons of kitschy and funny trinkets adorn the place! As for the food....it is incredible! I had a Cricket Burger with American cheese and an over easy egg and it was spectacular! Perfectly cooked and oh so tasty! I love it when the egg yoke runs down the side of the burger with every bite! Definitely a 5 star burger!Also had the angry mac and cheese, which had a surprising little kick to it, and the steak fries. Those steak fries were much better than I thought they would be! A large and generous portion of delicious fries to compliment an outstanding burger!Service was quick and friendly and there was never an issue! We left the Cherry Cricket stuffed and satisfied!

Very reliable, and very little deviation in taste and quality, just a higher price these days. But unfortunately that just comes with the territory. Don't forget to check out all the other food they have to offer! Great daily fresh made soups and salads. Awesome Mexican food and green chili.

Hands down. Duffy's Cherry Cricket... Where to begin? I suppose at the beginning. This perennial powerhouse in Burgers has been doing their thing in the trendy Cherry Creek area of downtown Denver since 1945 and although the neighborhood went trendy 30 years ago - not much has changed at the Cricket. They still have the Best Burger in Cow Town (and the world). The Beer is Colorado Craft with plenty of Domestics and Imports to boot, all ice cold. The service is rock solid and makes everyone feel like a regular. If you are ever in Denver, this is a must stop - even if you are on your own. The menu is unreservedly massive and everything they do, they do quite well but Burgers are their flagship item and it is a cardinal​ sin to order anything but the Burger - particularly on the first visit. With a pitcher of Beer, naturally. Me? I always get the same thing. The half-pound​ medium rare Cricket Burger ($8.25) with Smoked Cheddar, Lettuce, Tomato, & Pickles along with a side of \"Frings\" (Onion Rings and Fries - $5.00). At just over $13.00 this is the cheapest gourmet meal worthy of Michelin stars that you will find in the Rockies, or perhaps anywhere. Everything from the consistency, seasoning, and quality of the Beef employed is utterly​​ superb. Louis Lunch, Father's Office, Au Cheval, Tookie's, Brindle Room, hell, even Shake Shack and my beloved In N Out - none of these remotely compare. Cherry Cricket will always be the black sheep of Cherry Creek.

There was quite a wait when we came in (Broncos were also on deck to play) and we lucked out after waiting 5-10 minutes and found two seats at the bar. There is definitely a dated feel to the restaurant, but overall it was very clean (including the bathrooms). Service could not have been better. Both people manning the bar were awesome. We ordered a couple of local beers and they were attentive without being overbearing.I was starting to feel under the weather and didn't want a heavy burger. I ordered the Veggie Basket and Angry Mac & Cheese. The Veggie Basket was okay but the veggies could have been more on the fresher side. The Angry Mac & Cheese was so amazing I couldn't put my fork down (and the serving was huge). It was the perfect combination of cheese, bacon and jalapeno. We had all kinds of amazing food while visiting Denver but I'm still craving this Mac & Cheese. So simple, but really hit the spot. My SO ordered the Bison Burger with swiss, mushrooms and bacon.  He said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had. He also ordered the Frings (half order of fries/half order of onion rings) and they were also delicious!Overall, I know we'd be in trouble if we lived close. The food here is incredibly unassuming but hits on so many points. They were also kind enough to put on the Falcons for us even though every other TV was supporting the Broncos.

Service was perfect honestly, my IPA adult beverage refilled twice before the food arrived. YES PLEASE! Bleu Cheese Burger tasted great, grilled to perfection.
