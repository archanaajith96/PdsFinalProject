We made reservations a few weeks in advance & the earliest time available was 8:15. We generally don't eat after 7 pm & were tasting our dessert close to 10 so you definitely need to plan ahead! We planned to arrive early to have a cocktail in the bar & it was enjoyable but I wouldn't have wanted to have my meal there since it was very crowded & loud. We would not have enjoyed spending over $200 on a meal in there. However, our meal in the main dining room was outstanding!! We started with the baked grits then my husband had the Amberjack & I had the Risotto & it was all wonderful! We finished with the chocolate & aged rhum cake & it was easily one of the best desserts I've ever had. My husband said his fish was the best he has had as well. My husband is a bourbon drinker & said he expected them to have higher end or more special things to try. I had The Orange Drink. Patrick was our server & is beyond great at his job! All of the staff we came into contact with was very pleasant. I would ask for Patrick if we return because of some of the reviews about having a bad server. Bad service changes everything especially when you are spending a lot of money!The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because if the risotto had not been on the menu that day, the only thing I would have eaten was the grits! I don't eat beef, pork or seafood & the mushroom tart, while on the menu,was not available that night. And the mushrooms with the grits & the risotto were so very good!"}, {"review_id": "xEOo-tjRPuAKvPkt7YrvxA", "user_id": "4paWpLov6LjpsNNgE1fhSg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Highlands is not simply going to dinner, it's a dining experience. Will B had given me a heads up that we had reservations here so I did a little investigating. After finding out more about Chef Frank Stitt and his ties to Charlestons Sean Brock, I knew I was in for a memorable meal.I'd say the most memorable dish was that Grilled Pork Belly with watermelon. It was such a unique take on this common southern staple. I couldn't get enough of it. Another favorite was the Stone Ground Baked Grits. The texture of the grit cake was great and the saltiness of the prosciutto paired perfectly with it.For entree's, I got a taste of the Veal and the Grass Fed Ribeye but my entree was the Seafood Medley. I loved the mix of prawns, lobster, and scallops. I expected my seafood dish to be a little lighter than my cohorts veal and steak but I do wish there was a little more on my plate. Mostly I'm being greedy because it was delicious and I wanted more.We finished up with profiteroles which were a different take compared to what I'm used to. While I expected one dark and one white coated pastry, I was pleasantly surprised by the three small rolls stuffed with ice cream and drizzled with a light chocolate sauce. A perfectly sweet ending for the three of us.We sat in the bar area which has a little bit more of a casual vibe but we still felt like we were being served at a fine dining restaurant. Our table was in a high traffic area but our server was so on top of things we quickly forgot about it. Overall it was an excellent dinner."}, {"review_id": "ufnj7MtQqOnHQ6kRaNEIfg", "user_id": "i64KzovbKTk8rscSPaTWWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We ate at the restaurant for our anniversary. Our meal  and the service was wonderful. We ordered drinks from the bar mine a martini and my husband a manhatten. My martini was perfect.. dry and so cold. My husbands drink was exactly as he ordered it. It is hard to find a good mixologist  and they have the best. We had the shellfish appetizer which contained very fresh shrimp, crab, and oysters. It was beautifully presented with four different condiments. For the main dish we ordered venison. It was perfectly med rare and came with two different sauces which complimented both the meat and each other. Served with onions, sweet potato and cauliflower. Absolutely delicious. We finished with coffee and creme brûlée and because it was a special occasion we received complimentary sparkling wine. The service was attentive but not overbearing. Truly a perfect experience."}, {"review_id": "RFNWZRKXLezTNfd8fILgYQ", "user_id": "2DCKZKJhVuHPaT7_tf0Khw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/21/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This is my second updated review. It is only fair to raise the rating after our last experience. Previously the service was some of the worst I have ever experienced in any restaurant let alone one of this quality. Andrew renewed my faith in Highlands. A litle rocky to start as we were seated in the bar tonight, and at the front side of the bar it is very congested and loud, and they really shouldn't have dining tables located here. We asked to be moved and were put on the other side of the bar, much better!As I stated Andrew was awesome! He made drink recommendations based on what we told him we liked. From wine for my one friend to the blood orange mimosa style recommendation to my other friend and myself...he was spot on.We started the meal with crab claws that include an amazing ginger dipping sauce. Small claws packed with flavor. Be warned they are cold (not the favorite for one of my friends because of this). We also had the Beef Tartine. Again, Andrew was spot on with this recommendation....amazing.For our meals we selected the Braised Short Rib w/spring vegetables and creamy grits (mine), Gulf Cobia w/mango pineapple relish, cilantro, jalapeno, and lemon honey vinaigrette (one friend) and Prime New York Strip w/paradise farm kale and potato salad. We absolutely did this on purpose (ordered different things) so we could get more mileage out of the menu. All tasted amazing and had their perks. The short rib was possible the most tender meat I had and was complimented perfectly with the horseradish, the Gulf Cobia (hands down my favorite) had the melt in your mouth quality and the pineapple relish was paired perfectly with it, the New York Strip wasn't cooked perfectly and was on the extremely rare side - had good flavor, but surprisingly the potato salad was the hit of this plate. Deserts were sampled as well and were loaded with flavor. Again using our combined genius we ordered three different desserts. To be honest, at this point I was so full it was hard to stomach anything more, but depending on your taste buds and mood anything on the desert menu is a good choice. We had the lava cake, the strawberry trio, and the meringue cake. Really good....perfect....way to end an already great meal. Thanks again out to Andrew for providing the type of service you should get at a restaurant like Highlands."}, {"review_id": "lF3fPuCAKYfybP55ihlAjA", "user_id": "-qc1caP_K9RavGQFNucH2Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/14/2017", "text": "After a wine night with the ladies downtown, we decided to get a late bite to eat at Highlands. Because it was a Wednesday night at 8:00 PM we had no issues with finding a seat at the bar.  We were kindly greeted by several members of the restaurant including their new chef. My friends and I decided to try 3 starters which included the Shrimp Louie, Stone Ground Baked Grits and the Pork Crepinette & Fried Oysters. My favorite was the Shrimp Louie (and sadly I didn't snag a photo). It was a massive slice of avocado with crab meat and perfectly cooked shrimp on top.  The grits were pretty outstanding as well! We then were served fresh baked flounder which was out of this world. I loved the ambiance The Highlands had. Dim lighting, clean white linen tablecloths and light music in the background.

This place will make an ATL gal come back for more!I was in town for Sloss Fest and my friend saw this place on Eater top 50 in the US and said we had to make it work into our plans. She continues to earn the right to choose because...wow. First let me start by saying she did not pay attention to the dress code - whoops. We were \"underdressed and overeating\" but they sat us no questions asked. I definitely recommend biz casual, no jeans unless dressed up. Otherwise, you'll stick out like we might have hahaWe started with a lovely glass of Sancerre (I was so happy to see one on the menu!) and ordered oysters to start. Based on our fantastic waiter's recommendation we went outside our usual Blue Point and tried the Johns River and Bass Master. Both delicious although now I'm sure I prefer the meatier variety. We shared the grits because that's what you do (thanks yelp crew). Our main courses were so hard to decide because when our waiter described each dish it's like I could taste it already! He described everything so beautifully and you could tell her appreciated the art of the Chef's mastery of each course. We decided on rabbit two ways and the veal - both were prepared perfectly and fit the waiters description to a T!

My SO wanted to take me out to a snazzy restaurant where we could dress up. He had suggested this and another place. I looked at the menu and was skeptical, but he assured me he called them the week before and they said they had a vegetarian menu. We pull in the parking lot, and they have valet parking (very nice!). We walk inside to our very late reservations. We sit down and right as our waitress comes to bring the menus I say, \"can I have the vegetarian menu.\" She states that they don't have any options, but I can get a veggie plate. So upsetting. My date felt bad the rest of the evening since he had called and they had told him they could. We order an asparagus appetizer that was really good and I try to pick some veggies for my main course. Let me tell you, it's easy to cook meat and make it taste good. It's a lot harder to cook vegetables. I got my veggie plate and nothing about it was special. They literally just cooked everything in butter. My SO enjoyed his food and I had leftovers because unlike Paula Dean, one can only eat so much butter. We ordered the chocolate lava cake for desert and it was heavenly. I had a glass of white wine throughout and my SO had red. We then left to conclude our night. I had such high hopes for this place. Being told all I could eat was a veggie plate when there's a chef there who could whip something up was depressing. It tinged our whole night. I WILL NOT be coming back until they make a more inclusive menu."}, {"review_id": "LDKoEVIvvPm7QyKrxswaeA", "user_id": "mV9CpqMSvn_MFFZoRKqFMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/13/2017", "text": "We really enjoyed our dinner here. When we first sat down, we were seated on one side of the bar where there was a group of women were being loud and obnoxious. I asked I'd there was a quieter table and we were immediately moved to other side of bar. So that was good, otherwise I would have been very unhappy. Our waiter, Andrew, was really great. He made recommendations on everything, from our drinks to our dessert. I told him what kind of wines I liked and he recommended a great wine for me. He recommend a blood orange drink for hubby and the orange thing for our friend. All were very good with the blood orange drink being our favorite. We started out with the beef tartine and the crab claws. Both were really good. Crab claws were small but delicious. For dinner I had the gulf cobia because I love fish. The presentation was beautiful and the fish was buttery and delicious. I was very happy with my choice. Hubby got the steak. I tried it and that was also really good. Hubby was disappointed because part of it was very rare and he had ordered medium but he didn't give them a chance to fix it so guess who ate the rare bits ; )? I'm happy to take one for the team. For dessert, we had the lava cake, the strawberry trio, and the meringue cake. We all tried each other's. My favorite was the chocolate lava cake. However, the strawberry cobbler also rocked.

I have now been Yelping for 3 years and I haven't reviewed Highlands yet? It is the quintessential Birmingham Restaurant to send people for a fantastic meal and I haven't bothered to put it in my 367 current reviews? I am ashamed of myself and only hope writing this glowing review will make up some for my lack of contributing to this Magic City Staple.I also don't think so highly of my reviews that I will be able to contribute something that everyone else hasn't already. It is the flagship restaurant of Birmingham's oldest, famous chef. It is a James Beard finalist every single year and churns out my favorite fine dining experience in Birmingham. Frank Stitt is a wizard in the kitchen and I have yet to have a bad experience here.The ambiance is definitely that of a white table cloth restaurant. Coats are not required, but I typically wear one. The main dining room is not quite as loud and is great for a special occasion. While the bar area is more relaxed. I like the experience that both rooms provide. In the main dining room, if you are lucky enough to get Goran (otherwise known as Red Dog), your experience is boosted tremendously. He is extremely informative and provides a laid back experience in a place that can feel a little stuffy. The menu is constantly changing to provide the freshest ingredients. But as I have already said, nothing has been bad here. There are certainly things that are tastier than others. But if you pick what sounds good to you, you can't go wrong. For some reason, I have always avoided steak dishes that are offered. Probably because I prefer that at a well known steakhouse. But on my last visit while sharing many plates with co-workers, I was blown away by the steak someone got and won't make that mistake again. The seafood is always fresh and the sides are typically outstanding.Although I have many restaurants as favorites in different categories, when it comes to the place to send people in Birmingham, Highlands is that place for me. It doesn't always fit what some visitors may be looking for. But if someone is looking for that one great Birmingham experience, Highlands Bar and Grill is at the top of my list."}, {"review_id": "SORvvk7V5H1wv8q--X3Wag", "user_id": "pou3BbKsIozfH50rxmnMew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/2/2017", "text": "Why 5 stars? Because this was an epic and memorable experience.   ---   ---    ---I love saving milestone reviews for special occasions, and this occasion was definitely special, so here goes #1700!I asked Will B where he would eat if he had to leave Birmingham forever, but was given one final meal in town before being exiled. He said Highlands, which is kinda weird since he hasn't reviewed it, but that's another conversation for a future quarterly evaluation.As for Highlands, it turns out that he's dead-on - this was a serious culinary experience. I'll go through each item:Stone Ground Baked Grits - 5 stars. I love grits, to begin with, so when you add in mushroom and prosciutto, my love instantly becomes even deeper.Grilled Pork Belly - 5 stars, and 6 if I could. Pork belly, watermelon, red onions, mint coriander and lemon vinaigrette. This is such a bizarre combination of foods but was possibly the most delicious thing of the night. Oysters - 5 stars, but in fairness, oysters are 5 stars just about every time I order them. My oyster palette is not refined enough to notice the difference between really good oysters and amazing oysters, but I was with a couple oyster connoisseurs who insisted that these were life-changing. Grass-Fed Ribeye - 5 stars. As close to a perfect steak as you're gonna get. This also had a sprinkle of mint on top, which was quite a nice touch. Speaking of connoisseurs with advanced palettes, shoutout to Yelp Charleston's Scotty C for noticing the mint after one biteThe veggies that accompanied the ribeye - 2 stars. This was the only hiccup of the night. Unfortunately, my veggies and Will B's veggies that came with his veal were very unremarkable. They honestly tasted like they were dumped out of an old can and heated up. I'm certain that they were not actually dumped out of a can, but they definitely were not great.Profiteroles - 5 stars. I've never heard of this dish before, but now I will seek it out in the future. This was a great treat to finish things off.We also had a very helpful server who picked out a great glass of wine for me, a guy who doesn't know much about wine, but does enjoy it. I was told to dress nicely, which was a good move by Will because otherwise, I would have shown up in shorts and a polo, at best. If you're super cool with your casual wear like myself (i.e. you wear pants three times a year) you may want to re-think your wardrobe for Highlands. And one other note, Highlands is delicious, but you will definitely pay for it - some come ready to drop some cheddar, but know that it was all worth it!"}, {"review_id": "nBwyysiGZethCk-BQggI-A", "user_id": "dtsCHzkadQTN8lhgS9bsPg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/18/2017", "text": "Hands down our favorite place in Birmingham.

Not only are there so many great reviews, a dear friend insisted we tried Highland. The three of us had a late reservation, when we were sat at our table in the bar next to the door, extremely close to the table next to us, I did not have a good feeling. The table appeared to be awkwardly placed with 3 chairs just to get another sale. The gentlemen behind me continuously bumped me throughout my meal, beyond annoying.  When we first sat down, my husband placed his wine glass to the edge of the table to be removed, to his surprise the glass was broken causing a cut on his finger to bleed. When our server finally approached he let her know & ask for a bandaid. She cleaned the broken glass, continued to serve drinks to other tables then threw 2 bandaids on our table as she walked by. Completely shocked that it was so brushed off. While this type of thing happens, when a customer is sitting there with a napkin wrapped on his finger to stop the bleeding, kind of expect a response of some kind. Other ratings of excellent service we did not expect this poor of customer service. My daughter started with deviled eggs that were to her liking. My husband and I shared Blue Point oysters and ceviche. The oyster presentation was very good. The snapper ceviche was excellent! No disappointment with the appetizers.My husband asked questions about a few of the entrees.  The server expressed the veal dish was a veal shank, one of his favorites, without hesitation he ordered it. This is not what the veal dish is. Not sure if it was the high noise level from the bar, our server did not hear the question correctly or she just was not familiar with the menu. Complete disappointment from what was explained when he ordered. I ordered the triple tail fish entree, very dry and way too salty for my liking. My daughter ordered the flank, this too was very salty. Unsatisfied, we did not finish our entrees. People standing at the bar were surrounding our table with drinks in their hands, saying \"excuse me\" one too many times as they bumped our table. Many of the waitstaff was surrounding the bar talking what appeared to be many locals. I do appreciate that kind of energy, just not when it is interfering with my dining. We decided not to order coffee and dessert as this was not a pleasant experience at all. All the hype with an expensive, upscale menu, I expected so much more.

I've read about Highland for years and when I found I would be in Birmingham, I immediately made reservations. For the most part, this was an enjoyable evening. For a restaurant with this stellar provenance, I suspect I expected more. The corn meal muffins reminded me of a pancake flavor. My waiter proclaimed them addictive and he was right. For an appetizer I tried the grits and they were excellent. A dense, but extremely moist cake was surrounded by a ring of boutique mushrooms, prosciutto and a decadent lemon-butter sauce. Everything was perfect except half of the baked grit cake was cold, the other half was warm. This is a reality I had not expected at a restaurant of this caliber. I could not escape the Sweetbreads entrée. They were prepared very well and served along side grilled carrots, artichokes and baby peppers. All was platted over a unique parsnip purée. I enjoyed this presentation. To complete my dining experience I enjoyed the banana pudding. Topped by a fired merengue with tiny wafer cookies buried deep inside. I liked Highland. I guess I had expected more. Could that be the result of high expectations? Likely.
