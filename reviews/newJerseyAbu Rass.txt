The mixed grill came out a little late and the guy who brought it to the table was extremely apologetic and they gave us a free pot of tea.  A staple of Palestinian hospitality which I'm extremely proud of. I live in NYC and although it took me over an hour to get here,  I'll definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "PjxWdS0NsfJ_wgmSK56WWw", "user_id": "1P2-csezbZ1zKI7bTQ9XjQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/7/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I noticed the Fatteh Eggplant was now served on a square plate versus a bowl.In addition, the Fatteh (toasted pita) portion was not as tasty with the Fatteh being cut into chunks of varying sizes which meant some of the pieces were either too toasted and the others less toasted. This inconsistency meant that some pieces tasted better than other ones.Despite the Fatteh issue, the flavor was still on par with previous visits.I tried a new entree in Abu Rass' Lamb Chops.Let me tell you that they were some of the best lamb chops I've eaten!The entree consisted of four perfectly grilled bone-in chops that had a perfect ratio of sweet lamb meat and decadent strips of fat. Upon my first bite I was treated to tender lamb and a burst of juicy gamey lamb fat, and I was happy!Complimenting the chops was Abu Rass' rice pilaf that was the perfect vessel to absorb much of the delicious flavors from the lamb chop fat.Lastly, Abu Rass has started to make their own pit bread which is served complimentary with your meal. The bread was very soft, but still having just a slight chew, and was lightly toasted. It proved to be the ideal way to eat the Fatteh Eggplant as the bread served as an awesome scoop."}, {"review_id": "k9jM_jm7-OlnJfUE-kENfg", "user_id": "Ff2d4Y6Bf9Jrjb-M1VjLIQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "11/25/2017", "text": "On my way back to NYC I decided to stop by Patterson New Jersey for some Arabic cuisine. I strictly went by the yelp reviews and decided to try this place out. When we entered we were promptly greeted and seated. The seats are worn out and this place is not cosmetically pleasing. As we entered my wife went into the bathroom to change the baby. The waiter awkwardly waited for us to order. I told him to give us a minute and he just stood there. The food was bland and didn't really have flavor. The shawarma was very dry and burnt.  We ordered the Hummus with shawarma meat and the shawarma was burnt. The salad was extremely soggy because it was over saturated with their oil and vinegar dressing. The only thing that we ordered that tasted good was the mixed grill. Overall I would avoid this place."}, {"review_id": "9xA8mIDX39sXZqdb9us_sQ", "user_id": "SlDSPuv63_TrEcSeMG23sg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "We stopped in to Abu Rass on our way out of NY City for a traditional Middle Eastern Breakfast and we had a great experience. We were a large party of 10 and they went out of their way to accommodate us.  The restaurant is small, but they have all hands on deck and really did a great job making us feel welcomed.  The food was great, we just ordered an assortment of food mom use to make us growing up and shared, olives, humus, and humus with shawarma, lebaneh, fried cheese,  pickles, eggs and potatoes, falafel. They had fresh pita bread they made in house which is always an added treat.  Great Place and Great Service."}, {"review_id": "8V5klklDdF8mwNhlsJImxQ", "user_id": "mBwLsf3GL0p-m173B4XOTQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "This is a awesome restaurant.

Just finished a meal with two buddies and as usual, they met my high expectations. We had the hummus and fried cheese for appetizers (highly recommended). Then we had chicken shawarma, mixed kebab platter, chicken liver sandwich, and french fries. Everything was cooked perfectly and brought out promptly. The staff was friendly and courteous. And of course I topped everything off in the end with some great coffee. I'm slouching in the back of this car right now and can barely move...

I've placed a phone order and was there within 15 minutes as I was told it would take for for the food to be ready for pick up. There was no reason/ excuse for the cold meat at 11:30 in the morning, unless it was leftovers. Gross and unacceptable. The owner(s) should know that we, the customers, have other options in the area. This place is the cheapest for a reason, they know they won't do well or stay in business if they raise the prices since their quality of service and food is poor.

The cold apps were good, presented well. Not the best Fatoosh salad I've had. I had to beg the waiters 4x (no exaggeration) just to get garlic sauce in addition to other basic things. Small mixed meat platter -- Meat was cooked well, but all the restaurants in the area excel in that. Ordered the vegetable platter (mix of cold/hot apps) and they substituted an app not on the menu..they fixed that when I pointed it out. The good parts: we were seated quickly, environment was family friendly, mint lemonade. Staff could have been more attentive.

We had reserved a table 45 min in advance just to secure a spot, because it usually gets pretty busy around this time of the year. As soon as we walked in we quickly noticed our tables as it had our names on it.When we sat down a waiter came and asked us if we wanted menus or get food from the buffet they had stationed outside. We opted for the menus.  After 5 min of giving us the menus the waiter asked us if we were ready, and when we told him we were not, he left our table and never returned.Another waiter actually came and took our orders, seemed like a people's person too. Not even 10 min had past since we put our order in and we start getting random plates of food from the first waiter. As happy as we were to see food on our table we knew it wasn't ours and we were right. The waiter came back and took the plates off our table and gave them to the table behind us(this happened twice).Now the food here is very delicious (just stay away from the tahini salad). We had ordered a large plate of food with various meats, hummus, fried cheese, and the salad I stated to stay away from. But the service is slow and at times you wonder where the hell your waiter is. Other than that, if you're in the mood for middle eastern food it's got my recommendation."}, {"review_id": "9OeEaPH2GVMADSUnARoXnA", "user_id": "Qt2H4wmIGKQaNlBn2cMEkQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/14/2017", "text": "Ask about the special menu that they have everyday.Delicious food.Lovely and friendly staff."}, {"review_id": "C3l9mqP6MREDV1ddvmuGEw", "user_id": "RztBrfKeOrbbm7H1Y-XeiQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "I keep giving this place a try but they keep getting it wrong. The food is okay but the service is horrible even for Patterson. EVEN our togo experience was bad. We ordered $200 worth of food. They promised and swore to god 3 times it would be ready at noon. Well it wasn't ready till 12:50. Our dine in experience before that was so bad we left. They basically forgot about our large table on the other side. And they were super slow. The waiters acted like we were bothering them. When I complained the owner came out and was just like deal with it or leave. And then the meat came out medium instead of well done. When we told him just take it off the bill even though we returned it. He was upset.

It's a pretty decent hookah bar with very cheap food. We were seated outside, the setup keeps people smoking hookah away from people not smoking hookah.I got the shawarma sandwich and some hummus. The hummus was a little more lemony than I was used to, but not bad. And a shawarma sandwich with fries for $5 is a great deal. I ordered a watermelon mint hookah, which came in a grapefruit bowl. It smoked pretty well and they changed my coals regularly. The prices aren't bad, but they do charge an automatic gratuity. But it's only 15% unlike many of the other hookah bars in the area. I can definitely see myself returning."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/abu-rass-paterson?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
