The buffalo shrimp (at the west location), the spaetzle, the brats, the best lasagna in town. They're open late with a late happy hour so every Monday after basketball I go and crush happy hour beers and get a late dinner. Great wine selection, classy, for a date or family or even solo (small bar area). My only complaint is that there aren't enough menu items! Best \"normal\" restaurant in LR."}, {"review_id": "Xtp0CeVQWV9mnphIQ6Zzsg", "user_id": "Wtqs33i70BpWFzlOlL5hfg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "This has been a really great dining experience. We had the charcuterie plate. So much food for such a small price. The pork belly is smokey and melt in your mouth good. Pate tastes just like it does in Eastern Europe brought back memories to both my wife and I. The sausage and bratwurst have a unique taste with a perfect texture, bratwurst was also very good.We were given pommes frie cause they made extra for some reason. They were absolutely the best french fries I've ever had. They are made with some potatoes I've never heard of, but they were crispy on the outside and soft and tasty on the inside. Served with curry ketchup and another really tasty sauce.The service was exceptional, our server took time to chat, told us about things on the menu and was knowledgeable, friendly and fast.Our dessert tiramisu was deconstructed and one of the best desserts we have had.Truly one of the best dining experiences we have had."}, {"review_id": "KGFYoeeXmRCVY7zzVkPMww", "user_id": "vFdtKzEELg7kAf8ag6ur4A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "My daughter picked this restaurant and I absolutely loved it.

This has a cozy interior which can get a little noisy depending on whose partying, but with romantic touches and a patio that is one of the best in town. I honestly cannot say enough good things about this place, it is one of my favorite restaurants of all time."}, {"review_id": "uVeqDSgkTcA1bxBduZ-egA", "user_id": "5f7tPbvAeUCIvVfGVfw3HQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/12/2017", "text": "The one thing that the middle of the country doesn't ever seem to have is a staple of solid German restaurants. A good one can be more uncommon than a Harvest Moon. I've been traveling through the Little Rock area for the past week, and I've been relying on the Yelp App to find \"the good places\". I'm very grateful to have discovered The Pantry Restaurant along the way, especially since I won't ever have my Oma's German cooking anymore, which her cooking sets the gold standard for Deutsche Küche in my world. I started with the pomme frittas, basically fries, while I browsed the bier options. It was the right appetizer for one or two people. The ketchup is blended with curry if you're wondering what makes it spicy. It's different but good. For the entree - the Jäger Schnitzel. A solid choice. I really enjoyed the spaetzle, which was visibly and deliciously homemade. Big props on that. The schnitzel was amazing. I had the breaded version, because hey - gravy!The atmosphere was very posh. The Pantry is perfect for business dinners, anniversaries, romantic dinners or hanging with friends. The only downside for me was the German bier selection. I wish there had been more European choices."}, {"review_id": "F0v2fBuzy2EvxtJILw9hkA", "user_id": "KgDtoAvntrW45_F9iWF41Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/3/2017", "text": "Given the near-unanimity of glowing Yelp reviews, it's possible I patronized The Pantry with overly generous expectations, but I honestly wasn't all that impressed. Although the restaurant's visual ambiance was appealing, the noise level was more akin to what one might expect from a rowdy bar, which made it notably less enjoyable. The same dynamic could be felt in the service, which in my case was provided by a very sweet waitress who was also a bit slow and easily distracted. Then there was the food, which was neither terrible nor mind-blowing, and should have been prepared in a fraction of the time.All told, The Pantry is a place I would be open to revisiting in the future, but probably not one I will go out of my way to patronize again."}, {"review_id": "SABLwcsFxKikx35tXctqpg", "user_id": "_MXv1-cPvmy2P5y6dHdSpg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Flat bread good.Hey Chef heads up- the Leah salad needs a bit more flavor in the dressing.

As another reviewer said: it's not that it was bad, it just wasn't as good as all of the hype had me hoping it would be... And the truffle deviled eggs? I did not even like at all - they had an unpleasant oily flavor. Apparently I'm not a German food fan, although this is probably the only time I've had it... The ambience was fine, the service was good...Don't bypass this place because of my review, however... Maybe I need to go back with a regular and have them help me order!

Better than in the river market district. The menu Is German but with a heavy Czech bend. ?Sudetenland cuisine perhaps would be more accurate. The Sovichkova is a beef roast, sliced and served with bread dumplings and gravy and it's quite tasty without being overpowering as some gravy dishes can get.The German equivalent of the shepherds pie is heavier and heartier.The ambience is relaxed, the lighting somewhat low and the service is friendlier than most places.

We did not dine in but that wasn't our initial choice ( life of new parents lol). My hubby enjoys everything German so we knew we wanted to try this place out. So happy we were able to call in, also so happy that they stay open so late! We made it to LR around 8:30pm and after getting settled into the hotel it was after 9:30pm Thanksgiving Eve so most restaurants were closing. The iron skillet potatoes!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG!! Those potatoes were so good! Hubby ordered the Jager Schnitzel and I ordered the Wiener Schnitzel. The mushroom sauce for the Jager will slap you in the face if you aren't expecting it!! Lol But to be honest, I couldn't stop eating it!Great food! I hope one day hubby and I will be able to sit and enjoy the beer selection too."}, {"review_id": "Rl0zjS_MojT0SEIvguEqwQ", "user_id": "u8h3wDfdnggrz41s7zltZA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Great food, great service, great price, great atmosphere, and great company - have I said \"great\" enough?! We thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of our meal. The house made ricotta and rustic grilled bread was light, and refreshing. My husband had the Rustic Bowl of the day, which was essentially a German Chile relent - the flavor was spot on. The potatoes that came with it were okay, The dish would have been better served with spatzele instead of the mashed potatoes that came with it. We loved the apple strudel that ended the meal. Our server, Kim was gregarious, informed, and all her interactions were perfectly timed.

However we came back a few nights later to an excellent experience. They have a gluten free menu that will make a allergy foody take a second look, I mean some of the dishes are awesome and something you don't get everyday anywhere. Especially German food. The cocktails are real iffy, some good, some are downright nasty, however the Daiquiri is one of the best I've ever had. The Savory Pantry pie is what I ordered after our appetizer of Deviled Eggs which were very tasty, the Pantry pie has \"Hearty Goulash Stew and Mash Potatoes\" it was good, and even good for leftovers.

Everything I've ever ordered has been absolutely delicious. My favorite way to visit The Pantry is with a few hungry friends and several times we have ordered every single dish on the appetizer menu. There is not one disappointment in the bunch. My favorites are the cheese spaetzle and the house made ricotta. As for the entrée section, it's hard to beat the fish and frites, but the lasagna is a close second. The atmosphere is warm and cozy, and the service is the best. I also appreciate that they have Steigl and a wonderful wine list.
