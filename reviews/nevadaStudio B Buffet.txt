Decided to meet up at the M resort at the Studio B buffet. It was Friday so its Seafood night. I believe they charge $40 pp. We got seated in 5 minutes for a group of 7. Waitress took our drink orders before we rush to chow down on some crab legs, oysters, shrimp, mussels, and etc. Let me get to the point. In my opinion Studio B buffet was good but i dont think it was the best of what other yelpers rave about. Although, their prime rib was really good along with their fresh oysters. Btw, unlimited wine/champagne came with the buffet. Not so much selection of sushi that wasn't fresh. Oh, desserts and ice cream was delicious. They had a better presentation of it. I'll probly be back only if friends or family would like to try this place. Other than that I rather go to an all you can eat sushi place and spend $27  for dinner.The highlight of the dinner was just hanging around friends and listening to their funny stories back in the days.

They were told about this buffet in California and wanted to experience it together so we decided to go. I have been in a dessert mood for the past couple of weeks. But I am not neglecting my dietary needs, since one can experience and experiment with many choices here.This is a very high class buffet with steak on the menu that is so fine cut and succulent. The dessert menu is great too and one can sample many different types all at the same time. The atmosphere of the buffet is very warm and welcoming and elegant. The staff is very outgoing and attentive. Overall not a bad place to have great food and share old family memories and make new ones."}, {"review_id": "Sm0-_ssumugAvz3QlznAqA", "user_id": "vnpfnIsSFzInHaXgP4doLQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Studio B Buffet is inside the M, not on the Strip. My friend and I decided to get a taste of the famous Vegas buffets en route to a Utah hiking trip. We initially decided on Studio B based on the solid reviews and what we thought was a ~$20-something price on the website, but when we arrived it turned out to be ~$45 each--don't know what we had seen on the website, but just decided to go with it since the latter is the average buffet price around. I had never been to a Vegas buffet before so I'm not sure if this is special but Studio B would definitely satisfy any seafood lovers out there, with a large selection of different types of crabs, shellfish, and ocean critters. I tried a raw oyster for the first time! I'm not a huge fan of raw fish in general but it was surprisingly pleasant. I could definitely see the reason in coming in to such a buffet and simply eating 40-50 oysters or something, getting one's money's worth. Needless to be said there is a world of cuisines offered, and even tasting a bite of every single one of the hundreds of items would be an impossible task. As with any buffet, the quality of any one dish was lower than that of a restaurant that specializes in say, Korean cuisine, but we're obviously going for quantity rather than quality over here, and in the field of buffets, Vegas quality is top-notch. Alcohol is also included, and the bartender was a sweet middle-aged woman."}, {"review_id": "icI8W1M1ErfZ_ffmEehUtQ", "user_id": "8lzAZ5hLQWuOAHBd8bGQSg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "*This review is for the special holiday feast they were offering*Great buffet with lots of options and endless alcohol! I have wanting to come to this buffet for a while now because I have heard nothing but great things about this buffet. I heard it was one of the better buffets but it being away from the strip, I never had the chance to visit. But I'm so glad that I finally did because it was really really good! It's about a 10-15 drive away from the strip. We were on our way out from Vegas so decided to stop here. We came for lunch expecting it to be a lunch price, but they were offering a set price with the holiday feast because we came 12/20, so it was $40 per person but it had some special menu items like oysters and different kinds of seafood. The buffet has lots of options and everything was very tasty and was fresh. They had Your Asian section, Mexican section, American section and lots of seafood. The oysters were yummy and fresh and were very plump. Everything I had was much better than the Bellagio buffet where I just visited couple days earlier. The shrimp were nice and big and perfectly cooked and were very yummy. The Asian had lots of options too from sushi, noodles, pho and lots of Chinese items. The pho was really good considering it was buffet pho. Sushi was fresh too and all the Chinese items I had were good. What really sets this place apart is that they offer unlimited drinks with your buffet. You can get beer, wine and champagne! What a deal! That's worth the price of the buffet in itself! Definitely check this buffet out as you will not be disappointed!"}, {"review_id": "e_ZzOOFiT23_QbTu1yrqDw", "user_id": "ICtC3GL1ssRWDkOA5tt4iQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "Yes this restaurant currently boasts 4 stars...  and my beau loved the crawfish and mussels.  It's also in a big Casino, it's huge, and dramatic.  The overall selection is enormous and seemingly infinite.  Pizza, spaghetti, every salad imaginable, seafood for days, turkey, ham, ribs, Thai, sushi... I would dare you to find a soup (chicken noodle to ox tail) or side that wasn't there.

One of the best buffets in Las Vegas by far if you enjoy seafood and in particular crab legs galore. Come here on the weekend and get your fill! One other little perk to mention is the open bar with alcoholic beverages including mimosa's, red, white and rose wine, and a few beers. They have a very large selection of food ranging from pizza, hot and cold crab legs, clams, shrimp, sushi, salads, soups, noodles, meats, and a dessert area guaranteed to fill any last part of you that requires a sugar fix.

And for $25 per person total you also get all you can drink beer and wine with your order. Sweet!

Everything was fresh and clean. Service was superb. Reasonable price includes wine beer and champagne in addition to tea juices and soda. For New Year's Eve, it was $49.99/pp and they had grilled lobsters. I think the regular dinner buffet is cheaper but it doesn't have the lobster which was well worth the extra $10-$12 price. The desserts were also very good. I loved all of the shots in tiny cups. They were fresh and not overly sweet. I seriously loved each tiny cup. Flan and creme brûlée were on point. They had sugar free desserts that were delish.

They still have their dependable prime rib, turkey, marshmallow sweet potatoes, Asian, Hawaiian and usual buffet suspects. Even the crab legs are the ones that are cut lengthwise, so no fumbling with crab-pliers or chopsticks. I even recognize the buffet bartender from when the M first opened.Aha! They have a gyro spit now!! Thats new!! Super soft and thick cut sliced meats with the gyro bread next to it. Taziki sauce with hummus and veggie toppings are good. The fennel salad with fresh dill goes well with this, too. I think the gyros are where the nachos used to be.Of course, all you can drink wine, beer and cider on draft."}, {"review_id": "dUBOBS16agMV3BqmMn1rog", "user_id": "dkpSGDbULRpFfrpKPaZeQA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Pretty much on the expensive side, even though they have a wide selection of food.

I'm usually not into crab legs all that much but I got like 3 plates haha, super easy to eat. Towards the bottom of the bin they were pretty salty though.The pasta I wouldn't waste my time on, it was all watered down. The meatballs were pretty good but yeah I wasn't impressed at all.I thought all of the meat were good though. I was begging for a steak of some sort, all they had was a mostly med rare prime rib, but that was good at least. Both ribs I had were great, barbecue and then one asian style. The chickens were the meat stars - honey, roast, jerk.The brochure said there were 200 dishes yet I didn't really feel like there were, mostly because there were so many kinds of salads they were probably including in that, I wish they had had more sides or entree meats to make up that 200.They have free beer and wine btw, better get on that :)I was bummed when she said we'd be seated in the back booth because it's far from everything, but actually I think it's better. Less crowded to maneuver through, but more importantly a romantic wall to wall view of Vegas The desserts are so cute, they were all unnecessarily intricately decorated. Both my friend and I thought most everything was too sweet, but I loved the panacotta, and the chocolate covered marshmallows we're good.I grabbed an ice cream cone on my way out, the rum raisin was very rummy haha, I wonder if they make the ice cream fresh Every employee we encountered was very nice btw, every single one was friendly and our waiter was attentive.I'd give this buffet a 3.8"}, {"review_id": "1pbO4mPnXUuuYqpqah3AxA", "user_id": "Ac2oeT_2_xFn117_UszdcQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "A must go buffet in Vegas!

Everyone who visits Las Vegas love buffets.

Lol) is included in the $50 per head charge! B studio has an excellent and never-ending stock of snow crab legs. They are cut in a half for easy eating and offered HOT or COLD! The oysters were NOT good. They should be shucked upon request or in smaller amounts. A lot of the oyster were dried out and had pieces of shell in it.The rest of the seafood offerings were nothing crazy and I really did not care for it. They have tuna poke, cocktail shrimp, ceviche, and much more. The buffet has a wide selection of cuisines ranging from Chinese to American. I'm enjoyed the oxtail stew they had! But the fried items were not very crispy. I felt that a lot of their food were stale and needed to be changed out.Their meat selection is plentiful but nothing to write home about. Lots of beef, sausage, turkey to keep you satisfied. I enjoyed this very much!I am not a big dessert guy but if you are, I'd recommend you to check it out. Tiramisu, strawberry cheesecake, marshmallows, and lots of baked goods. I'd say give it a try, it is worth the drive and price if you're into buffets.
