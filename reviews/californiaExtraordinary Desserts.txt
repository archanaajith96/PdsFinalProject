Super fancy looking inside and the desserts . . . well they're extraordinary! If you want to sit and eat the lines are definitely long but if you take away it's much faster although they do charge extra for some desserts that are plated. The desserts definitely look better than they taste. Don't get me wrong, they taste good! I'm just saying that its looks WAY better!We got the parfait and the crème brulee bun which were both good and not too crazy sweet. Service (even for take away) is a bit slow and they could be more organized in the ordering process as well."}, {"review_id": "KFdrjC1c09ncL_VNvKFtKg", "user_id": "K0AHrgCJtZCSP7BRVOv0dg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This is the first time Yelp has ever steered me wrong. 4 stars on thousands of reviews - can't miss!In SD for work, went with two colleagues. Everything looked amazing. I personally got 3 desserts:Lemon meringue cake - cake was dry. Really dry. Meringue kind of tasteless. Banana cream pie - whipped cream (and there was a TON of it) was tasteless.  Crust was tasteless. The very thin layer of banana filling was pretty good. Cherry chocolate chip cookie - cookie was dry, and overall it was relatively tasteless. My colleagues got a few things, they were also disappointed. Again, just bland. The one high point was one of my colleagues got a cup of coffee and said it was outstanding. A month ago I was at Bottega Louie in LA. This place kind of reminded me of that. Except the desserts I had there were phenomenal. These were just bland.

Sweet and delicate. But the line wasn't fun. Definitely hyped and I would not wait 45 min on a friday night again. SO MANY OPTIONS. I can see why many people love this place, I guess it just depends on the type of person you are. I would wait 1+ hour in line for certain sushi restaurants but not for Extraordinary dessert. The wait was so bad for what it was causing me to put EO only my list to avoid, unless my girlfriend is really REALLY mad at me. Like REALLY mad. But even then, I would order take out rather than wait in line. Pro tip: Do take out if you can. What sucks is that the shop cant meet demand properly, which is bad for customer experience (like me) and good for the business.....But then again, that could be part of their plan to attract!!!They are constantly packed on weekends. Good luck with parking.

Now, I have planned MANY parties and arranged many events for family, friends, non-profits, business and more.  1 week should be enough to push a couple tables together and serve a menu of desserts and grilled sandwiches.So, the day of the birthday comes, and we show up and wait for our table.  We get split into to tables.  1 high top and 1 low table of 4.  And all the while, there is another high top sitting empty the whole time.  I've worked in restaurants and banquets and pushing two tables together so the party doesn't have to be split is not hard to do.On top of that, my friends at the small table of 4 (which my priest was sitting at) said they were ignored and food and water took forever.  Our table got pretty good service, but that's not how it should have been.  We ALL should have gotten great service and there is no reason why we couldn't have all sat together.The place still makes some beautiful dessert and it's good to come by and grab something to go, but don't even bother to celebrate special occasions here with a big group.  They don't know how to handle large, special occasions."}, {"review_id": "YPW8viBZ6dzRN8iYPfccdg", "user_id": "F-BAEwAMXSjfAQeWTHIPlw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "The desserts here are extraordinary beautiful; hence, the name of this establishment. Each piece is so exquisite and vibrant - it is almost too pretty to eat. It is a wonderful combination between tasteful and tasty to your eyes and stomach. This is not the original location, but this location is way more spacious and serves food aside from dessert. All kinds of delectable desserts imaginable are crafted here: cakes, pastries, cookies, tarts, and so on. The food menu is more tame and is that of a typical cafe: salads, panini, and other bites. There is also a bar that serves beer and wine, but if you want a non-alcoholic drink, there is coffee, tea, and other drinks to choose from. The way it works is that you get a slip of paper and pencil when you enter the door. The dessert selection rotates so take a look at the desserts on display and write down what you want to order. If you do take-out, get in line and hand your paper to the cashier. If you do dine-in, hand your paper to the server when you place your order. The prices for the dessert are quite steep, but you do get more than a fair share. Plan on sharing, having leftovers, or being stuffed from dessert. Extraordinary Desserts nails it on aesthetics, texture, and taste. The desserts are rich without being overbearing and melts more than crumble. There are also vegan and gluten-free options. The cafe food is good too. I had the BLT and avocado panini, and it was on point. The bread was perfectly toasted, and the bacon was crisp and delicious. Extraordinary Desserts is the place to go to for dessert, but it is also a a solid option for a meal. Expect it to be busy, but any wait is well worth it. Reservations can be made for between opening time to 4 P.M., and happy hour is Sunday to Thursday from 4 P.M. to 10:30 P.M. Parking is street only and metered. Plan accordingly and enjoy some time in Little Italy and at Extraordinary Desserts to make it a fulfilling day."}, {"review_id": "TAPeQL9McaD9gSOOhpG-cw", "user_id": "_5ZU2jXJbffdKb7p1RvVfQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "For years my family would get cakes from ED at the 5th Ave location, it is a small intimate nest for two to have dessert and a Krasne selected fine tea.  It's an experience.

Been going here for over five years now and will drive two hours just to satisfy my dessert cravings. Some people think it is pricey but it is so worth it; they decorate their desserts with flowers and gold flakes, it is like a piece of art on a plate! It does get crowded and the wait is sometimes long, I suggest you browse the dessert case in the front and write down what you want while you wait. Also if you plan on visiting this place, dine in because they do give you fruit purees with your cakes and it does make a difference!My favorite things there are anything passion fruit, but especially the Passion Fruit Ricotta Cake ($10), which is probably my favorite cake there! Their Linzer danishes ($6.25) are served warm are really delicious. I love the desserts here because their creams on their cakes aren't too sweet and well balanced. This place is worth the visit. People usually dine in and get desserts only so don't be hesitant on dining in.

I appreciate that it wasn't SUPER sweet. We had a birthday tea which tasted a bit like cookie though. It was good! I would love to try more of their tea as well.Our server was so nice!

I love desserts, but generally find many too sweet, and was interested to see where these desserts fell on that spectrum.After a filling dinner in the Gaslamp district, we walked here (was only about a 10-15 minute walk) which was necessary to open up more room in our stomach for dessert! The wait around 9pm on a Saturday was around 30 min, so we decided to get the stuff to go.A little primer on the place: the host/hostess will take your name outside, and will give you a menu and a paper you use to order. The menu contains food, but not the desserts, for which there is what they called a \"visual menu\". AKA, you have to look in the displays inside to see what they are actually offering.We ended up going with the Gianduia and a pineapple cheesecake. The slices were generous, but the gianduia was too sweet for me. We both agreed the pineapple cheesecake was the superior choice. Sweet but not too sweet, rich, great cheese flavor. This one was a winner.Overall, I'm glad I don't live close by: potentially dangerous from a waistline perspective =P"}, {"review_id": "Bh58HN3jVXIOl-UGtvmGMA", "user_id": "MunaluAQXNiOyryfXKSQgQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/1/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I've been here a few times now.

And also the day a wedding proposal happened to a wonderful couple!! After the proposal, the families and couple of their friends were going to surprise the future bride in Extraordinary dessert. That's a great idea and we were very excited! James and I were in charge of the flowers and also getting a table for 12. The day before yesterday we called and tried to make a reservation. The phone receptionist (or the host)informed him that the store doesn't accept reservation. But he/she also said that Tuesday is usually not too busy. And if we show up an hour beforehand, we should be able to get a table for 12. Well James and I got to the store an hour beforehand. But we missed another piece of the information. That is we need to have at least half of the party present to get the table. Hmm... Well James and I got off work early but the rest of the people didn't take off work early. So there's really no point for us to show up an hour early cause we couldn't get the table until more people show up anyways. Miscommunication indeed.We ordered some tea and waited at the bar for more people to show up. Our server was very attentive. She refilled our tea while she's taking care of couple other people.About ten minutes before the couple showed up. The hostess set up the table for 12 by the corner. I was a little nervous that we won't make it because it's supposed to be a surprise and what not. However, I worry for nothing because everyone was so happy for the couple. No one cares how the things were set up. It's the first time in Extraordinary dessert for half of our group but our server was very patient with us. We ate a brunch of cakes, drank a lot of coffees and took a lot of pictures. It was a good night at Extraordinary dessert."}, {"review_id": "YfuDqkvGUO8PYYF3pvyvHg", "user_id": "s9HbNwmZhL8FDNWaAdM-Fw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "My favorite bakery at all time.

I'm from Seattle and I wish they open up one in my area so I could eat their cake anytime I want. This place is a must if you visit San Diego. My family had 4 different cakes and we love all of them. My favorite one was the passion fruit cake. Very light cream with perfect sweetness and sourness from different fruits and sauces. The space was big and open and the service was great. Only one complaint is the drinks. The coffee was not very good and my pink hot chocolate was overly sweet. It came in a small lame looking cup.

Definitely would suggest to come in smaller groups or come to grab things to-go. My boyfriend got the cheesecake and I got the strawberry bread pudding. I wanted to try the chocolate croissant bread pudding since I've heard so many great reviews on it but unfortunately they were sold out from them that day and all they had left was one strawberry croissant bread pudding left.
