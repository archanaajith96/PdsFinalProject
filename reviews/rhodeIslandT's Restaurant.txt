I've been to T's on two occasions and I was far more impressed the first time before they changed everything to appear to be \"classier\". My family and I went this past Sunday for breakfast and waited approximately 35 minutes for a table. I think collectively the best part of our experience was talking with the patrons who were also waiting for a table and debating whether or not they should take their business elsewhere. We were sat fairly close to the time they quoted for us but once we got the menu everything sort of went downhill. The menu is small, lacking most of your brunch and breakfast favorites and the prices are expensive. Our server was great. He was attentive and immediately brought us coffee which I appreciated. They also had an amazing French Toast coffee that I would highly suggest to flavored coffee lovers. Once we decided what we had wanted off the small selection of items on the menu, we ordered and it took about 30 minutes to get our food. I thought the food was okay but for the price of the meal you would think the portions would be huge and they weren't. We weren't given butter for our toast which we were told came with our meal and they didn't have a large selection of hot sauces like most breakfast places do just one specific to Rhode Island. I definitely don't think this is the worst experience I've ever had with a breakfast place in RI,but I've certainly had better. If I go back it will only be to utilize the coupon I got through yelp for checking in which by the way you cannot use on Sundays."}, {"review_id": "bN6zAY8ba83r6VPFEXAdSQ", "user_id": "cX7OCX2mndXgRMXm2ThxDw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Food was good ,but a little pricey,my granddaughters Mickey Mouse pancakes(she's 3 yrs old) cost me $9.00.

There are so many good breakfast options now and T's seems to have fallen off. We went in here this past weekend. I haven't been here in maybe 8 years and I won't be back. Before we walked in we looked on Yelp at some pics and menu items. When we were seated we looked at the menu and they no longer had any of the desirable items that were pictured and listed online. The waitress said they changed the entire menu back in October. We asked the waitress if they could still make them and she said no. Ordered and omelette, toast, and home fries. Just not good. Not bad, but definitely not good. Omelette was thin and oily and home fries tasted like frozen freezer section ones. My honey did like his corned beef hash and said that was tasty.People seriously love it here .... just look at all the glowing reviews. We just didn't and will not be returning."}, {"review_id": "bCLWXx7aM1yjDAbDUnqhpA", "user_id": "0VQUX_vaLxaXu_-OIIOpAQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Took a friend here and was so disappointed.

Recently they remodeled the inside and redid the menu. I have no issues with either of these things. I know a lot of people don't like the new menu but I like it. I find it much less overwhelming than the old menu. I've found that while the food is still good (with the exception of the eggs Benedict, where the poached eggs are so undercooked you can still see the clear of the whites - I've found this multiple times), the service is terrible. Almost 10 minutes for someone to take our coffee order. Another 10 minutes for it to be delivered and to take our food order and at least 30 minutes to deliver the food. It's disappointing. The other disappointment I have is that you can no longer order a banana. I get that they can go from ripe to rotten quickly if not ordered. But going with two young kids and trying to explain that they can't get a banana at breakfast isn't fun."}, {"review_id": "jHcQuZzGm7ewQYAv-vIP_g", "user_id": "Vw_65hYXm1pCEvYSbLztWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "Love Ts. It's like a 45 minute drive but well worth it. Since I last went they updated the decor and the menus. Very trendy now. Still same great food! They also have soooooo many good drink choices! They have alcoholic and non alcohol. Sons of liberty bourbon! Awesome that they are using local RI places. They also have nitro brew coffee which is awesome!!! Make sure you aren't hangry when you come because you do always have to wait because everyone knows how great it is. Parking is rough but usually no one cares if you park in the Bank next door. Make sure you get buffalo homies! It's the best park of breakfast :)One word of advice for the owners, bring back the old mugs!

For as long as I can remember, this place was the breakfast spot on weekend mornings. However, it's always packed and there's always a wait. Since we're here on vacation, we decided to get Monday morning breakfast. There was no wait! We got a seat right away. Our waitress was very nice and quick.I decided to order a coffee and my meal of choice was the bacon Benedict. Ah-maz-ing! The food came out fast too. The bacon Benedict came with home fries. The fries were super crispy just the way I like it. The egg was on the tackier side but it's perfect for me since I don't like my eggs too runny. Each egg had hollandaise sauce on it. It's on an English muffin and the bacon was crispy. I just remember each bite was filled with a burst of flavor!

Initially I thought this was a good thing because I always paid the up-charge because I wanted the fresh fruit.  The size of the side of fruit on the new dish is soooo tiny.  You basically get 1 strawberry, a few grapes and a few blueberries which is disappointing.  They also switched the onions to red onions and no longer cook the veggies all the way so they are still pretty crunchy and don't sit well with my stomach.  Lastly the options they used to offer are no longer there -- no more cinnamon apples, less selection on the bread etc.  Although these changes may seem minor to you (and some of them are) previously I was able to justify spending a little bit more on our breakfast ($33 including tip) as it was a treat... now T's has fallen out of our top spot for breakfast."}, {"review_id": "OAkv55bVye-Hnb_5c43krg", "user_id": "mg5gnAMS_LIstI1zC5-P8A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "This place is amazing!

I've been to T's countless times, and it has always been a mediocre experience for me. I mainly keep returning because it's one of the only breakfast spots open 7 days a week. The wait could be anywhere from 5 minutes to 50 minutes, depending on the day of the week you go. It's usually not as busy on weekdays. The food is DECENT, especially in comparison to other brunch spots in Rhode Island. I've had everything from French toast and omelettes to pancakes and eggs Benedict. There is really nothing special about any of this food- it's basic breakfast food that lacks flavor and consistency. The only thing I really enjoy are their buffalo home-fries. One other thing I do love is the ambience. This place is extremely clean, and the decor is nice. Even the plates and mugs are cute. The prices are also reasonable.

They are especially good at making Omelette and eggs Benedict dishes that repeatedly surprise me at the new tasty highs they achieve.If you aren't a fancy breakfast booger like myself, they provide plenty of standard breakfast options that are delicious.If you like spiced or cheese ask about the Buffalo homies or the southwest homies, both are quite good and can add some nice variety!"}, {"review_id": "5hHmel6Ly-D8mnA7yas24A", "user_id": "twt2cniWvC-VYU_Jn1QcxA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2017", "text": "T's has always been my go to breakfast spot.

It used to be our favorite breakfast spot. Sadly, we were so disappointed. The menu has definitely shrunk.  Everyone around us was also confused.  It took a long time for us to even choose what to order, as some favorites have disappeared or changed. In addition to the selection being narrower, prices have risen and portions have gotten smaller.  For example, my sister ordered the Ooey Gooey French Toast.  It was maybe half the size of what it used to be, but cost $1 more.  When the food, arrived, it was mediocre, at best.  It seems like they are trying to go more \"upscale\" instead of sticking with their winning neighborhood restaurant vibe. For instance, on the kids' menu, instead of the \"Mickey pancake\", there are now \"ancient grain cakes\". We won't be returning as long as this new direction continues.I am not the kind of person who writes negative reviews.  I prefer to give glowing reviews to places that really impress me.  However, I'm offering this up in the spirit of constructive criticism."}, {"review_id": "JlPw6JlnBizWSBy4tRazEw", "user_id": "oWkvmW_TzymQbbgun85Xnw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/23/2017", "text": "What a cute spot for a brunch with friends! It's in an old house, retrofitted to be wheelchair accessible if you need that. Main dining room is bright and there's plenty of separation between tables so you don't feel crowded even on a busy Sunday.The iced coffee was good - not just hot coffee poured over ice - and had free refills (not every breakfast place in RI does, and that drives me crazy).Blueberry pancakes were loaded with berries, and nicely sweet-flavored but nothing to rave about. My omelet was tasty, and not at all greasy; clearly made in a pan and not on the griddle. Solid rye toast, buttered and also not swimming in grease. The veggie omelet wasn't cheese heavy. Mostly mushrooms in there with occasional tomato, pepper and red onion, with little to no spice though, so overall a bit bland. I like the option of stewed apples instead of home fries! Our mimosas were really good and very well-blended.We did have about a 15 minute wait, but there's a large porch area with many chairs so we didn't mind.We'll be back. This is a good solid breakfast/brunch spot. Nothing trendy or especially notable maybe, but good and solid.
