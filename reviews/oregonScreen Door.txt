The waffle wasn't that amazing. He said he's willing to wait an hour on line again for the chicken. I on the other hand will skip it because I didn't find it fascinating and worth the wait. Ordered the cheddar grits and praline bacon as well. The cheddar grits was not spectacular and lacks flavor. The praline bacon was a huge disappointment as it does not taste like bacon and I did not like the texture.

Inside, however, there is plenty of space with booths and tables galore to sit the tens of people eager to dine in. The menu is divided into two separate lists, one for breakfast and one for lunch that starts at 10:30 am.We got there near the end of breakfast on a Monday morning and were seated in about 10 minutes. Everything on the menu sounded good with plenty of sweet options, like waffles, and savory options, like egg scrambles. However, we knew we had to get an order of their famous chicken n' waffles (one piece of chicken) and the banana french toast.Service was painfully slow. It took over 25 minutes for us to get our food, and to add insult to injury, no one even bothered to acknowledge the wait. But after taking one bite of our dishes, we instantly agreed Screen Door deserves a five star rating.The chicken was prepared boneless and fried to crispy perfection. The batter was beautifully seasoned and complimented the juicy chicken meat within. The waffle was prepared with sweet potato and dressed with a generous sprinkle of cinnamon, making it taste both savory and sweet at the same time. That was easily one of the best dishes we've ever had. The banana french toast, on the other hand, had a mouthwatering, buttery crust, while the bread itself was as soft as a cloud. The cinnamon whip cream paired so well with the french toast and the bananas soaked in rum were amazing. The slow service may have been a minor irritant, but my goodness, the food was mind-blowing. In fact, everything tasted so delicious that I'm actually sad our meal had to end."}, {"review_id": "k3vWJMCcvm0UeSoVtZDpgA", "user_id": "QjQND4xv6saxKL8eg7hfCA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "I enjoyed my food experience at Screen Door. My friend and I were referred to this brunch hot spot by a friend from the area. It was a bit of wait (close to 2 hours) so definitely come prepared knowing that on a weekend you might be waiting. The host had seating time down to a science and we were seated close to the time we were told. There is some bench seating inside but largely most everyone either hung around outside, at the bar, or walked around and came back to check their progress. We were seated outdoors which is covered and has heaters. This day in particular was a bit rainy and chilly so I'm glad we were comfy. I ordered the shrimp and grits and my friend got the chicken sandwich and a side of hush puppies. We were pretty stuffed from our meals that we go the hush puppies to go. The hush puppies tasted good but were a little dry and def on the sweeter side. I would go back for the shrimp and grits again! The sauce/gravy that it was drenched in was sooo good. My friend was a little unsatisfied with his sandwich. He was hoping for more flavor on his chicken. He also got a side of grits but it also lacked flavor. It's a lot of food so plan to go if you have an appetite!"}, {"review_id": "PW6uZoFXigS0hiVf5Nbiuw", "user_id": "4ORZMxO814akJnLhL1sf_Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "The hype over Screen Door attracted me and I'm not sure if my expectations were too high or if I just ordered all the wrong things (probably.. didn't get the chicken). We got here at 8:15am on Sunday and there was already a small crowd outside waiting for them to open at 9. We waited in line for 45 minutes and their doors were finally open! Too bad some people were a-holes and just pushed their ways in from the front instead of lining up.. There has to be some sort of a system! I ordered their beef brisket hash and the boyfriend ordered the french toast. We also shared the hush puppies, which had to be the best thing out of the meal. The beef brisket hash came with two eggs and tortillas. The hash was so greasy that I felt sick after half of it. The french toast was so drenched in syrup that the toast was just sitting in a pool of it. Like the boyfriend said, \"I'm eating my way into diabetes with each bite.\" Service here was impeccable though. Our server was a delight in the morning and was patient with how indecisive we were.

The food has a southern flavor, yet prepared with local produce from the pacific northwest. They are open on the weekends from 9am to 2pm for breakfast and lunch, and reopen at 5:30pm for dinner. Screen Door is a very popular restaurant all around, from the locals, to the tourists from all over the world. My girlfriend and I came around 1:30 PM on a Saturday afternoon and we waited a good hour or so. If you want to visit, I'd suggest coming on the weekdays, or during off meal hours. There is a Starbucks a couple of blocks down, so that's where we hung out for awhile as we waited for a table. Here are a few details:Food: I ordered the fried chicken and waffles. You have the choice of ordering 1, 2, or 3 pieces of chicken with your sweet potato waffle. Since I wasn't too hungry, I ordered the 2 piece and it definitely filled me up. I had to take some home. Portions are generous here. The sweet potato waffle was a hit. It had a hint of sweetness, and didn't give you the \"heavy\" filling after eating it. Definitely recommend this dish. My girlfriend ordered the St. Helens natural beef brisket hash. I didn't have enough of it rate it, but I thought it was tasty and filling. Service: The waiter was helpful and did his job of making us feel comfortable. As far as waiting in line for a table, there is a host/hostess waiting for you as you walk in and you'll give him/her your name. He/she will provide you an estimated time, and we ended up just waiting around 15 minutes before the ETA, just in case. Ambiance: It was pretty loud inside the restaurant. There are plenty of tables and the restaurant is packed! If you don't like crowds/waiting a long time for food, or sitting close to the table next to you, I wouldn't recommend Screen Door. With an established restaurant as Screen Door is, the tables are always going to be filled. Overall, I don't think I will come back, unless it was with a friend who hasn't been before. It's a restaurant you need to experience once, but I thought the food was above average. My preference isn't so much into the type of food Screen Door offers, so that's why I wouldn't wait 30+ minutes for the food they have to offer. It's a definitely gotta try though, so go if you're hesitant. :)"}, {"review_id": "P-V4pGJHyZSLq6k0qhGvxw", "user_id": "but2s3yQA5LokHGCaVXHVg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "I visited Portland for the weekend and knew I had to come here. I've heard so many fabulous things about Screen Door and they're true!! This Southern themed brunch restaurant served delicious food, and I am definitely coming back here again in the future. I heard about the crazy wait times at Screen Door, but I got lucky and just walked right in. I came around 9:45 on a Friday and there was no wait for a table of two. Nonetheless, it was packed inside. The line outside also got really long towards the end of our meal. (~10:30)I ordered the shrimp and grits. The flavor was delicious. I've never had cheddar grits, so I expected a very strong cheesy flavor. However, the cheddar just added a tint of orange and it's flavor didn't stand out too much. The shrimp was very well done, and the dish as a whole was just incredible. It also came with a side of egg and biscuit. My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken and biscuit sandwich. The gravy elevated the dish so much. We both loved our meals!Despite how busy the restaurant was, we still had good service. This place deserves a solid 5 and I can see why it is one of the most popular brunch location in Portland."}, {"review_id": "XbktgQv4IWDVRXO8zGu4_w", "user_id": "Ta0ki1Fi2fcDpOjiQcR1Qw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "I'm super late on posting this review l, and I ain't even sorry! *_*My fellow derp and I were derping around Portland before PAX West in Seattle during LDW.

No big deal since we got delicious coffee and a snack down the street in the meantime! We ordered the 3 pieces Chicken and Waffles and the 2 biscuits with gravy and eggs to share. We definitely struggled to finish this. Lol I'm not even surprised because 10/10 we're always so ambitious and end up stuffing our faces while our eyes are sparkling with hunger. Always. So.

Tiny cramped tables cover every square inch of the floor makes it a little hard to enjoy your meal. The food was good, not great. We went for brunch and ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffle was yummy a bit sweet and seemed like it had shredded carrots in it. The fried chicken was way over peppered what I'm assuming was a mistake kind of ruining the flavor. The brisket hash was really delicious, however I wish they offered poached eggs all of the time (not just on the weekend) because it would have added to the dish. I was also expecting something better than tortillas from the grocery store to accompany the brisket; if they have biscuits ask for one of those instead."}, {"review_id": "PLoOPWq0xzDSjmh-Qk9L-g", "user_id": "wo1qkZ38DcsiN4Fezj0FcA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Love this spot for breakfast/lunch! One of my favorite places to go to in Portland. The long wait and difficulty to find parking is worth it. If it is your first time coming, do not hesitate and go with the chicken and waffles. This is a must try for everyone.Other recommendations:- Fried Oyster Breakfast Po-Boy: I usually switch between this dish and the chicken and waffles, but I definitely recommend this! - Fried Oyster benedict: I really liked this dish too, but it just isn't my absolute favorite dish. I have had it once, but I liked the po-boy and chicken/waffles more. If you're in the mood for eggs benedict, but with a little twist, this is a great option- Screen Door Praline Bacon: I recommend getting this as a good side dish! - Shrimp and Grits: This dish is really good, I have not ordered it myself, but my fiance normally gets it, so I get a few bites :) I recommend this if you aren't trying to be in a food coma. - Banana Foster French Toast: Awesome dish, but can be overwhelmingly sweet. Definitely share this with someone. My tip: make sure to either get there at like 8:30am on the weekends if you are trying to get breakfast. If you are aiming to eat between 10am-12pm, prepare to wait for like 30+ minutes."}, {"review_id": "KRtaKCX-MZYzlowM7eDaTA", "user_id": "HaX7gPyv2ekl-OaeWH6EVQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "This place was delicious!

Everyone seemed to be raving about the chicken and waffles, so that was a given part of our meal long before we sat down to order. You have the choice of getting one, two, or three pieces of fried chicken to top your sweet potato waffle. My husband for the two piece chicken and waffles and the portion was huge! I liked the chicken but thought it was a little on the salty side. I wish the waffle had been a little more crunchy and firm instead of soft. I got the Alabama scramble, which felt like the lightest option on the menu. It came with a side of cheesy grits and a slice of wheat toast. Everything was good, if not particularly memorable. I'm not a huge fan of grits because I prefer grains that have more chew and heft, but these were good and the consistent and texture reminded me of macaroni and cheese ... but just the sauce. At the end of the day, fried chicken, biscuits, and other gravy-covered fare just feels a little heavy for the first meal of the day, and I hate the inevitable food coma that ensues. However, if you're craving Southern food, then Screen Door is a safe bet. I do think Brenda's in SF, for those ever visiting the Bay, offers similar food but does it better, IMO: their shrimp and grits are pretty amazing."}, {"review_id": "3TXL259MboWG3AUMZ2QPlQ", "user_id": "3pLZ7w_DYvjk5j5yqyaqhw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "got there around 8:15am on a Sat morning.

He ordered the pancakes, and I got the shrimp and grits. We also ordered their famous praline bacon. Less than 30 minutes later, we were out the door. The waitress was clearly confused when we asked for the check, because people probably spend a long time eating there. We didn't feel a need to be in there any longer.The portions were quite generous, although looking around, I could tell that the chicken and waffles were the most generous. My dish was just big enough that I could finish, but I was to be stuffed for the rest of the day. That's okay with me, because it makes the price tag worth it. But unfortunately, because of the taste, the overall dish was a bust. The shrimp were tiny (why is shrimp even in the name of the dish) and didn't taste worthwhile. The grits were good, but I'm generally tolerant of all kinds of grits because I'm a huge fan, so that doesn't say much. The biscuit was pretty bland.I also tried the pancakes and the bacon. Although the bacon was good, I wouldn't order it again. I'm not a fan of pancakes so I don't think my opinion of it would be fair.

Always crunchy, flavorful, and a little spicy chicken on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside. The waffle is soft and sweet - perfect with a drizzle of maple syrup!Their Virgin Mary (non-alcoholic) or Bloody Mary, are both good.  Spicy the way a Bloody Mary should be, and they have their own spice mix that gives it a unique flavor.  They add pickled okra, a green olive, and a lemon for additional punches of flavor. Their hot chocolate is delicious with homemade whipped cream! (Is there anything better than fresh whipped cream!?)Today, I ordered the Organic Vegetable Hash for myself and the Pancakes with Blueberries and Lemon Curd for my daughter.  Both were delicious. The vegetables included a mix of grilled brussel sprouts and gold beets, which are flavors that I love and most restaurants aren't daring enough (or experienced enough) to explore!  I only had a bite of the pancakes, but they were quite good. They seemed to need just a bit more lemon curd, but that could easily be ordered as an extra next time around. Finally, the service is fantastic.
