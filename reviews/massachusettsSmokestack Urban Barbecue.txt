I only ordered a couple orders of the smoked wings. I was a little hesitant because typically the wings, after being smoked, are dried out and tiny. These were the complete opposite. Big, meaty wings. Not dry at all. And a slight pork fat smell and flavor, presumably from the shared time in the smoker. I have a new favorite wing in Worcester, for sure."}, {"review_id": "Wd9PFNMZQhQe9QAHr3Blig", "user_id": "IYYeUL9790zUrGgcrxFUQg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "The only reason why I'm giving this place 2 stars was because the food was okay.. My friend and I had easy orders burger and pulled pork sandwich nothing special. Not only did our food take over 45 minutes with it not being really busy, there were several other patrons served before us that shouldn't have, and the waitress was not attentive to us at all. She never gave us an explanation about why the food was taking as long as it did plus she never checked in with us like she was doing with the other guests. Overall, not worth the wait and I will not being coming here again. It's upsetting because I really wanted to find a solid place to get good bbq!"}, {"review_id": "7VPb17P-LFBaDOfrq_Faeg", "user_id": "b0Z-Rc0SI_EEe9xVLXHmOA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "Brisket, ribs, and pulled pork for 20.99 and two sides: Mac and cheese and mash potatoes.The brisket and pulled pork were really dry.

Leave your guilt at the door and dive in! The service is great. The staff is wonderful and the decor is minimal but comfortable. But let's talk about what REALLY matters... THE FOOD! Where do I begin? The shrimp and grits are the perfect starter and plentiful. The Cajun sauce is on top is delicious! These are old fashioned hominy grits slow cooked and not too heavy. The garlic string beans are super fresh and can be ordered without butter but you don't want to hear about that.... veggies schmeggies you want to know about the star: THE FISH TACOS!  Wonderfully portioned, perfectly grilled and seasoned these catfish yummies had everyone at the table nodding in agreement. I would happily drive out of my way to get them again.... and I will.  I didn't have the meat but those who did weren't too thrilled bcz the brisket was fatty. The greens are cooked with bacon so i couldn't have them and the cornbread is served ice cold.  *GASP* Blasphemy! Lastly the beignets! The beignets! THE. BEIGNETS! I've never had one before and this was my first experience. The dough is indescribable. I did a little digging and discovered what makes them stand out from typical fried dough is it's made with Choux dough. It melts in your mouth. I could've eaten 100.I'll return for those tacos *as my mouth begins to salivate at the thought* very soon and hopefully try a few other items on the menu next time. Dang Worcester, I see you"}, {"review_id": "R3b5B6pXDPltki711qtW-A", "user_id": "BlyHrucOzEwIO7Ji3LmlVg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "If you can't make the drive to Sturbridge for BT Smokehouse, go here.

I would rate this place place a 4.5/5 if I could, but since it was my birthday, I bumped it up to a 5. xDAll the food came out really quickly! I think it was under 10 minutes? It wasn't a particularly busy night (Thursday night), but I was impressed nonetheless.I got the Crispy Oysters to start and boy were they crispy! Dipping them in the rich and creamy creole remoulade was delicious and the cherry peppers served well to cut through the grease between each bite of the oysters. The oysters were only $10.99! My apologies that my picture of the oysters already had a few pieces taken from the plate, so bear with me !I got the combo plate - Sliced brisket, pulled pork, and spare ribs with mac and cheese, bbq beans for sides and the included cornbread. I got pretty generous portions of each single item. :D Of the 3 meats, I thought the brisket was the most impressive. It was a huge slab of juicy and tender brisket that was almost as large as the ribs portion that I wish I ordered more of! Apologies again that the brisket in my picture was hidden under the ribs. :( The pulled pork and the ribs were juicy and tender despite the ribs being a bit overcharred on the outside. This was the only negative of my meal.The beans were solid with a good sweet bbq sauce. The Mac & Cheese were a big YES! Very rich, creamy, cheesy, the bread crumbs were the cherry on top!The entire combo plate mentioned above was only $20.99. That's a solid price compared to other bbq places that I have been to.Definitely coming back here again. Though, I am curious if this place can be consistent with their meats."}, {"review_id": "2YODr2wsDx2TTVOZ8vfSaA", "user_id": "uH8tTLb3Fz64GtEMWpZZcQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "We ordered the appetizer variety platter which has chicken wings, fried pickles, potato chips and chicken quesadilla accompanied by 4 dipping sauces.  Everything on that platter was delicious except the potato chips which did not have much flavor but it's ok since there were a bunch a dipping sauces to eat with.

I've been wanting to go here for a while and finally got to go for an early dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated right away at a booth near the bar. Service was good. Decent beer selection. For food I ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs with Mac and cheese and cucumber salad. I thought the sides were really good. The corn bread was ok but I would have preferred it warm/hot with butter. The ribs were tasty but I am use to BBQ sauce and they had a dry rub instead. They were tasty, just different. I would definitely go back again but I'm not in a rush.

But typically you get a big portion. Not here though. Just 3 slices. Really wasn't impressed with what I got for the price that time. We did also get their nachos that time which were off the charts awesomeness.Second trip was much better. We had a party of 4 and we got 2 orders of fried pickles. They did them perfectly. Not  thin and not too thick. Actually probably the perfect thickness. Great pickle flavor and enough fried crispy goodness.My brother and I got the BBQ kitchen sink. It doesn't come out pretty. But it talks the talk and walks the walk. It's a great flavorful melody on the taste buds that's for sure. Would love to go back and sample more of their delicious food.

There's a lot of differences and the big one is the sauce. Smokestack serves a sweetish sauce that's favored in the south east. I spent a lot of time in the Kansas City region that favored a savory tomato paste base so it's not what I'm used to. My point is, they serve a good meat with good a good flavor but not what I personally consider my favorite. If you're from out of town and looking for your hometown barbecue, this will probably not be your place. If you're a New Englander who's never debated barbecue, I'd definitely suggest this place."}, {"review_id": "GI8lGUNLEZdWVm6kP81elw", "user_id": "M61kuyV0snAsZYWCiGjlZg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/23/2017", "text": "Super accommodating! I called at 6PM on a Friday to make a reservation for 10 at 6:30PM and the manager made it work! We arrived and promptly got served drinks and orders were taken :). I had a brisket combo with mac and cheese, cucumber salad and corn bread. The brisket was about half fatty and half lean and went well with the BBQ sauces that they had placed on the table. Without the sauce, the meat needed a little extra oomph. The mac and cheese was creamy with a nice layer of crunchy bread crumbs on top (very good as a side but I wouldn't be able to eat an entire bowl of it). The cucumber salad had a vinaigrette dressing (perfect with the mac and cheese)!
