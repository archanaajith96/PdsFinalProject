Love a variety of flavors and options? Chimborazo just might be your spot! (Who am I kidding, it's everyone's spot!)Came here with a friend around 7 pm on a Friday and there was a line that reached the door. Don't be scared off right away - even though you can't put your name down and come back, the line moves pretty quickly. The restaurant looks tiny from the front, but they've got additional seating in the back room and they're definitely efficient with service! We waited maybe 25 min until we were seated. The decor definitely has an authentic Ecuadorian feel to it, and I adore any restaurant with string lights and bright colors. The menu is packed with so many delicious-sounding options, I had a hard time choosing! We ended up splitting the ceviche to start, which was oh so tasty and very different from any ceviche I've had elsewhere - just trust me and try it. For my entree, I opted for the saltado with beef. Great flavors, somewhat tangy with a hint of spiciness. Beef could have been a bit more tender, but I can't say I didn't polish off my plate :) I'll be back before I know it! So many different dishes, so little time..."}, {"review_id": "3j-7ufFr8GIit6pHIQgE8A", "user_id": "7R4tlEYfNmGDslqcKtwhzA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/10/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Been over a year but went back today and it wasnt as good as it used to be. I'll go back once more in hopes that today was just a bad day, but if it's still just okay I may have to face that one of my faves must be demoted.  First.... ordered the hot cocoa (which was on the menu) and the waiter had no idea what I was talking about, wasn't sure if they had it, and as he told me.....was never debriefed on it. That said, they had it (like the menu listed), but it's not the same. It was just a packet of cocoa powder dumped in a mug with hot water. When it was brought to me, there were still clumps of powder. To make matters worse it didn't taste good, and while I only had a few sips, there's still a funny taste in my mouth. That really sucks b/c the one they used to have was amazing.  Then I got the side of sweet plantain which has cheese on it; what a waste. Just 4 slices (not even the whole plantain) and the cheese really added no value.As in the past I got the Seco de Carne. It was okay....not as mouthwatering as before. The beef used to be so flavorful, saucy, and tender... today it was barely any of that. On a good note: they expanded (not sure when) so the wait time is a lot better and overall prices are still really good.As an Island girl these are the types of foods I eat/make at home, but it's nice to go out and have it prepared at a restaurant. H/E, if this is now the best they offer...then guess I'll have to pass. :-("}, {"review_id": "-nzANCki45V7Mp81af-qiA", "user_id": "s4aGMZjvDSzHJQm6Y16b4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "First time experiencing Ecuadorian food, and wow so yummy! I was surprised by the different food options and pleasantly satisfied by the flavors.We had a group of 10 and the staff happily pushed tables together to make room for our big group on short notice on the weekend. Our server was funny with a dry sense of humor and clear knowledge of the food and drink options. The decor and ambience added to the authentic Ecuadorian feel: string lights, art and handicrafts hanging on the walls, and handwritten daily and weekly specials on the board.Wine was very reasonably priced, and a few friends got a delicious mimosa with some type of fruit juice (mango I think?) instead of orange juice--delicious!We all ordered something different, and of course I made everyone let me try their food so I could taste the range of options Chimborazo offers. Nothing disappointed, and a few even surprised me! Platos fuertes only, we didn't order any soups, salads, or apps. The seco de pollo was a really nice stir fry type of dish with great sauce. Saltado had a very unique sweet and spicy, tangy sauce that brought some heat. Churrasco flank steak wasn't my favorite, but I loved the sweet plantain and fresh \"fries\"! Llapingachos potato pancakes were very unique--something I hadn't had before--and served with yummy chorizo and a unique spicy peanut sauce. Someone got the lamb special and the meat was SO tender and delicious! I typically don't get fried rice at restaurants cause I make it so much at home, but their Chaulafan (Ecuadorian fried rice) was spectacular--maybe the best thing I tasted!Highly recommend this authentic Ecuadorian hole in the wall next time you're in Northeast!"}, {"review_id": "01HsQW1heD3hbbM2OhCNtA", "user_id": "4xpAKWmhQ00w-HVy_bUCSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "I am visiting my cousin and she took me to try this restaurant.

Plus the food taste even better as leftovers! Lost a star because of the long wait for groups bigger than 4 people. It appears that even though they expanded their dining area, they couldn't possibly expand their kitchen and staff with such limited space and awkward layout of the restaurant. When you walk in, there are so many people crowding around that you will miss the sign that says to check in with the hostess all the way up front in order to be on the waitlist. With that said, the food is still as good as I remembered. The yuca fries are amazing!!!!

The food is always made fresh and served hot. I have a hard time not getting the beef saltado every time- the beef is tender, it comes with bell peppers, delicious steak fries soaking the sauce, tomatoes and white rice that's not bad at all. There is also a tiny slice of avocado (wouldn't mind if they doubled or tripled that). It's vinegary and just a little spicy, balanced and palette pleasing. The empanadas are served fresh and are meal-worthy on their own. The yucca fries are also delicious. I recommend going with at least 3 other people if you like apps, and split and try several of them together.The ambiance is very casual. There is some parking behind the building."}, {"review_id": "R2L4w7fEW9Lpdv3P-UnrhQ", "user_id": "fysSXoKslYsCLH51d50uew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2017", "text": "AMAZING! We waited for 30 minutes to get a table for 6 on a Friday night, but it was so worth it. For some reason when I looked at pictures, I imagined it to be a lot bigger. Do not be deceived, this place is small. Do not make the mistake I did, only bring 1-3 other friends to reduce the wait time. I ordered the Llapingachos con chorizo and all my friends were picking at my dish. Three buddies ordered the Saltado, too sour in our opinion. One ordered the Chaulafan, which was basically a fried rice, nothing too special there. Last friend ordered the Encocado, a curry dish, the only other dish among my friends that I would consider ordering for next time. Good amount of choices on the menu, I will definitely to back for more. They offered me the tres leches and a sweet cheese platter, but I declined because I know it would be more than $5. 2 minutes down the street, there is a Mexican dessert place called Durango that is portion of the price. Check that out to keep your wallet fat. NOTE: They do not split checks for parties of 6 or more.

You have stolen my heart. Here is a valentines poem for you.Chimborazo,If I could spend each day eating your sweet plaintainI would never complain.If you haven't tried the fries made from yuccaYou are really a sucka.Eating the beans and riceIs oh so nice.Okay, that poem really sucked I am sorry. I have never written a poem so awful, but please don't let it be a representation of Chimborazo because it is truly the most wonderful place in my eyes.So a little back story on my experience with Chimborazo. Before I moved to Minneapolis I was visiting from out of state to get some interviews done and scope the area out. I stopped in a shop in NE and the owner told me that this was her favorite place and when I moved here I just had to try it. She wrote it down on a post-it note for me and I kept it in my purse for probably close to a year. One day my partner and I both had the day off and I found the post-it note (yeah, I know I should clean my purse out more often) and we decided to get brunch here. We sat outside on the patio and I ordered some dish with steak, rice, beans, and an egg over top of it. It was the most wonderful thing I have ever tasted. I mean...the green sauce.....what is it even? I don't know....other than PURE MAGIC IN MY MOUTH. Earlier this week we stopped back in for round #2 because it was Wednesday and they have a fabulous date night special. The special includes a bottle of wine and two entrees for 35.00. the place can get a little packed especially on Wednesday (we tried to do the date night special another time but the wait was too long for our hungry bellies). so I suggest getting there a little early or preparing for a wait. The place is cute and cozy and has limited space so prepare to be intimate with your neighbors as well. It is really all worth it, I promise."}, {"review_id": "UON1-I3QnqL-7gsqLxnCzg", "user_id": "OuKbKgvCiYxzgRugnGLb3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Huge fan of Chimborazo!Like everyone says, the fried yucca and the green sauce are awesome.Authentic Latin American food, great service.  Restaurant is a bit small, but very nice vibe.

My wife and I split the Yuca Fritas for starters, and were absolutely blown away by the aji criollo. It's an explosion of light citrus flavors that pairs perfectly with the crispy starch of the yuca. The saltado was perhaps the best I've ever had. The flavors of the peppers balance nicely with the marinated chicken and tomato creating a surprisingly well crafted flavor profile that is earthy and robust.

Everything on the menu is authentic, delicious, and comes at a great price (plus, portions are huge!). Always be prepared to wait--they don't take reservations, but are pretty quick at getting people in and out. When it's nice out, at least you can wait outside. It can get pretty crammed inside and you will feel like you're constantly in the way of people coming in and out of the kitchen. It's not the best place for larger groups (especially because they don't split checks on groups of 6 or more) but will still do their best to accommodate as they can. Parking has never been an issue, they have a lot but there is also plenty of residential street parking. It can get quite loud inside but it goes with the vibe of the place. And the food...amazing. While you're waiting in line, you have the opportunity to see (and get a whiff) of everything on the menu. We love the yuca frita and patacones con queso (plantain patties) as appetizers. The ceviche de camaron (shrimp cocktail) looked pretty tasty so that'll be the next thing on our list to try. The chaulafan (Ecuadorian fried rice with pork, shrimp, chicken, and egg) is a staple that we get every time--it comes with plenty to share, and often times we split it three or four ways. We tried the llapingachos con chorizo (potato pancakes) for the first time at our most recent visit and were not disappointed. Still haven't found anything better than the fried rice, but most of the dishes come close! For dessert, you must try the tres leche cake. Again, definitely worth splitting but it can't be beat. It's moist with the perfect amount of sweetness. The first time I was here, someone in our group ordered one after the meal and then ordered another to-go...ha.
