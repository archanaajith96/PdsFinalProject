I'm from California so I have a pretty high expectation when it comes to Vietnamese food; however, the pho here isn't too bad.The service is pretty good and the wait time isn't long. The pricing is reasonable for the portions you receive.I'm glad I found a Vietnamese restaurant here in Columbus. Definitely worth a try!"}, {"review_id": "LNGOt-aEQpENKdLvkgZb9A", "user_id": "2mEBeDxejjpQmVBMHhb2ow", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "-Service was ok. Felt pretty rushed when I arrived 25 minutes prior to lunch ending which is understandable but kinda rude. There were still 3 parties eating when I arrived and I left before some of them. -Food was sad. That's the best way I can describe it. I ordered the \"Vietnamese egg rolls\" and dry noddle dish. Both were very underwhelming. The egg rolls were not Vietnamese style egg rolls at all. They more so resembled store bought Filipino lumpia. The filling was mostly shredded carrots but had some sort of meat filling that I couldn't make out. They came with a very skimpy amount of veggies to wrap them. 2 small leafs of lettuce that were barely enough for 2 rolls (order has 4 rolls) and NO herbs at all. The dry noodle dish was pretty disgusting but I just finished working out so I forced myself to eat it. It had tiny bits of shredded white meat of some sort, little pieces of squid (tasted super fishy and NOT in a good way), scallops and salad shrimp served with chopped lettuce, noodles soaked in Maggi seasoning and some bean sprouts. There was a side of pork broth served separately as well. Again, no herbs or chili's. Just sad, wilted Romain lettuce on hot noodles covered with Maggi seasoning. Gross!!!-Total came to $17. Definitely not worth it if you've ever had decent Vietnamese food. It's a shame what people try to pass as authentic food to unknowing patrons."}, {"review_id": "z20b2mrtnswXa1XT7pHu0w", "user_id": "Xp4CqFKFho7-vwTjct7u4g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "We went there around 11AM not long after they opened.Loud hip hop music were playing.. didn't know if I was at a hip hop club or a restaurant.I ordered the combination bowl and fried egg rolls.Only 3 came out first because they had to re-fry the 4th one, but honestly they didn't have to since I only ate one. Zero flavor, it was horrible.The broth of the pho wasn't too bad but very small portion of meat, tendon and tripe. Two pieces of each type and maybe 3/4 of one meat ball.Also the veggies (sprout, mint, jalapeño, Cilantro and lime) that came with the pho were in a very bad shape. The mint leafs were all spotty I couldn't even use them. I had to ask for another batch of cilantro because it was all wilted with dark spots in them. Kind of surprising since we were there right after they opened and since it states in their menu that they charge extra for additional veggies I assumed it'd be somewhat fresh."}, {"review_id": "1vuLEaCMt_1BZOv09C78Gg", "user_id": "3DWDQ0yFd1KxlyLlnoNJaQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Pretty good pho.  They offer other dishes as well.  Didn't appear to serve alcohol.  Would come back again."}, {"review_id": "CZukTYYenaq2bjPtu05fkg", "user_id": "q0MdjS5HgDz3YH4Fnc3hwg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/28/2017", "text": "Decent Vietnamese. The prices are very reasonable and the service is good. Pretty big seat yourself, pay at the counter restaurant. * Started with the fried egg rolls. There are 4 in an order and they come straight out the grease. Hot! Very generous portions of lettuce, cucumber & carrots to wrap around the egg rolls. The egg rolls were good. * Ordered the beef vermicelli bowl. Very generous portion of food. The beef was a tad tough & not seasoned enough. The beef is cut in thin strips and reminded me of jerky. It was super tough & dry. The bowl would've been a lot better if the beef were seasoned better. * Overall, the food was just ok. I've had better beef vermicelli."}, {"review_id": "6CAvh2nJC5V8Ry1Yk0pBzQ", "user_id": "byQvdU_H1z3Mr-F0eU_Mow", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "I had a bowl of pho (combination special) & that was just okay.

Although the food here is usually pretty good i.e. Pho, rice dishes, vermicelli dishes, and appetizers, the basil was just sad and brown this time. Sadly, the service is lacking in courtesy, efficiency, and clear business communication. To top it off, the staff members seem very resentful of the customers. It seems that a request for almost anything additional or forgotten can earn you an eye roll and a negative attitude. Maybe the best thing would be to drive to Atlanta and find better Vietnamese food and service on Buford Hwy."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-viet-columbus-2?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
