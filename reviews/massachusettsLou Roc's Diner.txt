This diner offers large portions, creative dishes and amazing service.Even though, I do not live in the area. I have visited this diner twice and each time has been a wonderful meal. If you are a diet, do not go here.  The portions are very large. On our first visit, our waitress had to tell us to change our hash browns to a half portion because we were going to have too much.Here are the highlights and suggestions to make the most out of a visit to this great spot.-Get their early - avoid the rush and enjoy a quiet morning with the regulars-Order the home-made hash. You will not regret it.-Check out one of their special offerings such as the Irish & Polish BenedictNow, it is not a question that I will be back to this diner.  Final note, Worcester is known for diners and it is really great to find a real well run diner keeping this great American tradition. If you are interested in seeing the history of diners, go to the Miss Worcester diner which is one of the model diners which were originally manufactured in Worcester and sent around the country. I personally prefer Lou Roc's all-around super star but Miss Worcester has some darn good cool French toast. To see more pictures of Lou Roc go to foodlovergirl website. She took some great photos inside this classic diner."}, {"review_id": "0KUbQWEKdotYLsmHsf7C0g", "user_id": "tJv6qTKNcydnwLeXxaiBpw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/13/2017", "text": "We come here at least twice a month and never have a bad thing to say about it!

Their Blackstone and Philly Cheesesteak omelettes are to die for and you can't go wrong with their pancake or french toast specials. There is always something to be impressed about here! There is no hostess, so just wait in line behind the next guy and you'll get a seat when one opens up. This place gets extremely busy because of how good it is, so try to get there before 9 on the weekends!

I was surprised and overwhelmed by the amount of food I saw passing by on the plates. The seating is first come first serve, so make sure you check out who is in front of you or you may never get seated. The diner is small inside--maybe about 20 tables and 15 seats at the bar top.The waitresses are very friendly though and make you feel at home. Once we were seated our waitress quickly brought over our menus and again I was overwhelmed by the amount of combos and entrees that were available. I ended up picking the big breakfast, which came with two pieces of sausage, two pieces of bacon, choice of toast, 2 eggs, home fries, and 2 pancakes or french toast. Since I was undecided if I wanted french toast or pancakes I asked  if I could get one of each and she said sure. All of this mind you was just $9.50!!It did not take long for our food to be brought out and I was again overwhelmed by the amount of food that was on my plate. I took my first bite of the potatoes and eggs and it was delicious. The potatoes were seasoned well, but just needed a little bit of salt and pepper and of course ketchup! The french toast and pancakes were swimming in butter. I scraped off some of the butter on the french toast and added some of their syrup. The toast was full of flavor and the syrup made it pop just right. I gobbled down both pieces and took a small bite of the pancake. The pancake was heavy and had a gritty taste to it, which I liked. Before I got too full I was able to take a few bites of bacon and sausage. Both were very good--the bacon was crispy and thick. I ended up taking most of my food home and eating it for lunch later on and then breakfast the next day.Overall this was an amazing spot to get breakfast. I would eat a little bit before you get there as you could be waiting a while just to warn you! But, it is so worth the wait! It is a gem among the many restaurants in Worcester. I will be back for sure!!"}, {"review_id": "JzGPiLyFvNhP17Af8EBUXQ", "user_id": "M8aXv4qnI7DJVGTmf_SCtQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/29/2017", "text": "The absolute best place to get breakfast!Huge portions, reasonably priced.Cozy little place.

They have a delicious breakfast and their portions are ridiculous. usually have half and then take half home. Unless you're really really hungry. They also have a great daily specials. Like American chop suey and their are homemade lemon chicken soup . a teeny bit salty. But I like the salt. The wait staff are amazing you never have to ask for anything. They always refill your coffee and knowing you need something. I suggest everybody go. Especially on the weekend be prepared to wait.

We were greeted by the same waitress from before, with big welcoming smile. We were finally back! The inside was a bit more lively than the last time, as we arrived later time than the last time. And, the customers kept coming in more and more. Each time, the waitress greeted them with \"Hi John!\" \"Mornin' Tom!\" \"Usual Paul?\" since she knew almost everyone by their names.Learning from the previous experience (their portion size is ridiculously huge!), we decided not to order any side dish. Again, learning from our previous huge portion food servings, we decided to go with Eggs Benedict. That is usually a portion that is not crazy huge, right? Wrong! This is Lou Roc, after all. When they came to our table, we were again amazed at the crazy portions! It was again super delicious and we were more than happy, they certainly lived up to our expectation for the second time. We had lots of left overs, which we had the next morning with pleasure.At the end, we had another magnificent experience here at Lou Roc. Friendly service, amazing food, and incredible amount of food. We will be sure to return again in the future, for more delicious food!!! If you are a fan of any diner, this is a place you must visit at least once in your lifetime!"}, {"review_id": "3EbAH6Fj7H7nJ0qkihYzBw", "user_id": "PyqF5Gln7sqkJZfg4y_VUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/13/2017", "text": "First time coming here last week, while there was a line on a Thursday morning for brunch it was worth the 15 minute wait.

The food is always good and the service is always been pleasant and efficient. The amount of food you get here is fantastic. I don't recall ever finishing my plate. The only issue I have with this diner is its popularity. Because it is such a well known and well liked diner, you may have a long wait, especially on the weekends. The only time my boyfriend and I had no wait was we showed up right when Lou Rocs opened one morning. If you can deal with the wait, then the food is worthwhile."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/lou-rocs-diner-worcester?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
