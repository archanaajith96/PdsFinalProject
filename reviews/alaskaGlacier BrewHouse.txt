The atmosphere feels like a wood lodge and the giant fireplace in the middle is a spectacle of its own. The staff were quick and accommodating. They gave us menu recommendations and travel recommendations since we were visiting. They took their time with us and didn't rush us at all. We ordered the halibut special and said we would share it. Our meal came out on separate plates, each beautifully put together. The halibut was cooked perfectly and was simply divine! We ordered their flourless chocolate torte for dessert and were blown away by the flavor. On our second visit we ordered their calamari. The menu calls it \"the best ever\" and it truly is! The sauce served with it is the perfect complement. We were dipping the bread (freshly made, too) in the sauce because we didn't want it to go to waste. We ordered another halibut dish this night and split it again and it was also perfect. We finished our meal with their peanut butter pie and oh my goodness was it good! If you're visiting like we were, go here early in your trip so you can come back like we did. You will not be disappointed!"}, {"review_id": "v4cUnBSMKb7SCclqkvgD8Q", "user_id": "bw_2ax2FHLviJbI68LEpwA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "I love coming here on my yearly Alaska trip.

There was a nearby uncovered parking lot, which was located only one block away from the restaurant. So sorry! But my friend paid for parking, so I couldn't tell you how much it was to park there for two hours. There is also parking located along the street as well.Reservations: We called about 30-45 minutes in advance and they were able to put our name down on the waiting list, which was an absolutely marvelous idea because when we arrived, there were several people waiting for a table and the restaurant was completely packed!Food: I ordered the Salmon Dip as an appetizer and Halibut Fish & Chips. The Salmon Dip comes with a side of crostini and you can definitely taste the capers, which gave the dip a bit of a nice citrusy taste that balanced the flavors.  When I go to Alaska, I always want Halibut fish and chips and Boy oh Boy! The Halibut melts in your mouth when you take a bite and the batter was perfectly seasoned and fried very well. Not greasy! Just perfect!Service: We came at a busy time, so reservations prior to arriving was a must! The hostesses were extremely kind and welcoming. When we got to the bar, you can apparently see that the bartenders were busy making so many drinks to fill so many orders that they didn't have any time or acknowledge you when you went up to the bar. On top of that, we were shooed away and informed that we needed to order drinks on the other side of the bar, which was not an easy task to do because the bar area was cramped. Right when we got to the other side, none of the bartenders acknowledged us, but the buzzer went off to cue that our table was ready. Other than being shooed to the other side of the bar and not being able to get a drink before we sat down, we had a really good waitress, who was very attentive. Overall, I definitely recommend coming to Glacier BrewHouse for the food and the beer! Great place and I'd come back when hopefully, it's not a busy day or week!"}, {"review_id": "qSXnY8Uy3nXyZ5PLExFLMA", "user_id": "53mFB1WyC9bLgJOBCBUTsQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "This is far, FAR from the best place to eat in Anchorage. I'm pretty sure this place only gets by through catering to tourists and any hapless locals who don't know any better.On my most recent stopover, I ordered their sausage and mushroom pizza since it was just about the only thing I could afford besides a salad. Our orders were taken by a gentleman who couldn't even be bothered to look any of us in the eye, setting the mood for the rest of my dining experience. I'm pretty sure the only other time we saw him was when he delivered the bill.As for the pizza, well, I'm no professional pizzaiolo myself, but it was probably the shittiest one I've had in a while. I can only describe it as if they baked dough, sausage and cheese in the oven, only to top it off with uncooked tomato sauce and canned mushrooms afterwards.It absolutely boggles my mind why anyone would cook it this way. I can't imagine anyone enjoying the taste of raw mushrooms straight out of the can, but here it was. The tomato sauce was probably of the jarred variety too as it lacked any depth or complexity in flavor. Cost cutting at its finest, I'm sure. Also, the dough sucked.It's not just their pizza, either. I've been here numerous times in the past only to find myself let down by their food one way or another. I've had their beer as well, and can surmise that their options range from \"serviceable\" to \"good,\" with their imperial blonde being the high point.At least the restaurant itself looks nice and has an atmosphere that's enjoyable enough. If you've got money burning a hole in your wallet and would like to treat yourself and a date to some questionable-at-best food, then by all means try this place out!"}, {"review_id": "MjSX0K_wc921KpN232D6mg", "user_id": "Zyi3Wxrmrqf6cwK86UreGw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "You'll spend for a meal at this place but I daresay it might be the best $$$ you've ever spent.  I felt like I had died and gone to heaven.I debated and debated on whether or not I wanted to spend $80 for crab but I was visiting Alaska for the first time and felt like it was a celebration.  It was also a bucket list check off because Alaska marked the 50th state I've visited.  Yes, all 50 states....that definitely calls for $80 crab legs!When the crab comes out in one thick chunk, ready to be dipped in butter, you're hardly thinking about money.  Damn, it's good.I changed the sides to garlic mashed potatoes and a side of fruit but I don't even remember eating those because I was in a king crab coma.My son and husband got the halibut (just for the hal-i-but....lol) and it might've been the prettiest dish I've ever seen.  OF COURSE, it's the one dish I didn't take a picture of.  Didn't I just tell you that I was in a crab coma?!  We ended the meal with a different dessert per person but we all tried each other's.  Peanut butter pie is way too rich for one person.  Three people could easily split it.  The creme brulee, which is normally my favorite dessert, is just okay.  But the cheesecake is to die for.  I could not quit taking bites off my husband's plate.All total, I think we spent upwards of $230 for three people.  But it was worth it."}, {"review_id": "IkdNd6VUT2A1akT0Jw_ARA", "user_id": "L0A50Gg6yWohQLLSST29HA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Some people have staples like their favorite cardigan or pair of shoes but me, I have staples when it comes to restaurants and GBH is definitely in my go to list.

Others enjoy their steaks and burgers. Of course here is dessert. My favorite is the creme brûlée but the peanut butter pie is a must on some occasions. They also make a delicious flourless chocolate cake. It is rare that I have a meal I don't enjoy, but it does happen. I would say do not get the jambalaya fettuccini. It is over cooked, over salted and drowning in oil. It's a shame because jambalaya and pasta sounds delicious. I was also not impressed with the cod tacos. There was not much cod and the slaw had too much mayonnaise. I did like the corn and flour tortilla though. Service is always knowledgeable, attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is one of my favorites and I love the open kitchen."}, {"review_id": "V8ZLGlmMjNQBHm-8QMdZQQ", "user_id": "aX4Zs1tHhIe3xz-CLm8CSw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Was pretth crowded for a weekday dinner and people recommend reservations.

I was surprised to see how busy it was on a Tuesday however, so nonetheless, they are surely continuing to rake it in. We arrived at 7 and were crammed into a booth, which was awkward with all of our coats stuffed in. (It was 5 degrees outside.) We noticed the tables were mainly 4 tops, so a group of 5 wouldn't work out that well perhaps, but we noticed a larger table near the windows which would have been much better, but our seating hostess ran off. Comments were made by others also, that a table would have been nicer. Two of us ordered the rotisserie chicken and it was underdone, and very small.  More like a pigeon than a chicken. This I have noticed before, yet back then, the presentation was so much nicer and the flavors were there. The plates were hot, but the food was lukewarm. The mashed potatoes and vegetables that came with the chicken, although flavorful, were also a small portion, and on a large, white square plate the presentation was messy and haphazard. On one of the plates, the steak knife was plunged in the plate and covered with sauce, including the handle. Yuck. Also, the knives were very dull, as if someone had been chopping wood with them. And the cups of decaf that we asked for were definitely not hot- I truly cannot stand lukewarm to cold coffee. If this review were just for our server alone, it would be 5 stars, so fist bump, high 5 for her, because we hung out for quite a while after dinner talking since we hadn't all seen each other in a few years. I should have gotten her name, because she was super nice, professional and fun. She had a pair of earrings on, that were in the shape of a wineglass, and when I commented on them, she said she also has a pair that are shaped like martini glasses. I asked her if she had any shaped like beer steins and she said she has yet to find a pair like that, and laughed. Overall, and very unfortunately, not a spectacular evening, not even close. So very sad about that, being long time Alaskans entertaining visitors from outside. With Glacier Brewhouse prices so high, the plates really should have been more carefully prepared and presented, especially the chicken. It's best to stick with their salads and a nice slice of buttered bread. The beer is pretty good. Maybe their saving grace? But, they had run out of one type of beer that one member in our group wanted, so he had to order something else. I had a cup of the Alaskan seafood chowder, and it was quite good, but nothing to write home about. I also had the Chop Chop salad which had about the same effect on me. Nice large size however.We were very disappointed, mainly with the low quality, cold food and coffee, messy plates and the cost. For the price, it definitely could have been turned up a few notches. It was as if the people working the plates were more like hash slingers than fine dining employees. This year marks 40 years since I have been an Alaskan. When visitors arrive, we always choose the best restaurants to take them to on their final day here. Glacier Brewhouse has now been crossed off that list, permanently. Sure, the place is NOISY packed and making tons of dough, and good on 'em. However, some folks prefer consistency on quality, especially when paying a high price. It's only right. And it's only fair. And I hope that the people of Glacier Brewhouse who count read this, and get a clue."}, {"review_id": "y5dVc5Tln3YeCUnFIIq3Ow", "user_id": "41HLwXnR0Lm3NUp01cIOQg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/25/2017", "text": "It might seems like Glacier BrewHouse is super touristy  but it is really no trap.

Also like Moose's Tooth, this place is worth visiting for the beer selection alone. Their raspberry wheat beer is probably my favorite beer of all time. Anyway, I recommend making a reservation, especially if you have a large party or you're celebrating a special occasion. This is definitely not a good place for an intimate dinner. It's always packed and loud, whether you're at a table or the bar. There's little space between booths and tables so servers have to squeeze through. You don't get much personal space here. Service is hit or miss. I've had very personable, attentive servers sometimes, and servers who never seemed to be around other times. Last time I went there was the latter. My table ordered an appetizer which never came so we had it removed from the check. It's almost like the server forgot she was supposed to be attending to our table.The food was been satisfying every time I've visited. Last time I went for brunch and got biscuits and gravy with bacon and breakfast potatoes. The biscuits were fluffy and delicious and the gravy was rich with large chunks of sausage. The bacon was crispy and peppered, just how I like it. The breakfast potatoes were more like tater tots which was perfectly fine with me. The lunch and dinner menu has a good variety of pasta, salads, and seafood, among others.Worth a visit if you're staying downtown or hosting out-of-town guests."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/glacier-brewhouse-anchorage?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
