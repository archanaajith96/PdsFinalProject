We had a larger group of 14 including a few vegetarians that the Chef was happy to accommodate. The wine list was great and the staff (Jamie I believe) was beyond 5 star and that is what takes a restaurant from 4star to 5.  Service was amazing and the food certainly didn't disappoint. I had the charred filet along with french onion soup. Our appetizers of rock shrimp and crab cakes were near perfection.This would be a great location for a special occasion or entertaining guests.When your work group is still talking about how great dinner was the next morning - you know it was a great experience.  Keep up the good work - see you soon!"}, {"review_id": "YmA2xomTQ-JoCOunUrQdbw", "user_id": "D1HUTUpefdZFJ8SYdjEvwA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "You will not be disappointed.  The steak here competes with any high end, big city steak house.The ambiance inside is nice; typical dark wood setting but big windows in the front bringing in some natural light and a more modern feel.  They have a glass wine cellar in the front part of the dining room showcasing a very nice wine selection.  It's not a deep list, but they provide a nice range to choose from.  I started with a tomato bisque soup that was average and they wrote a large \"R\" in a sherry or vinegar on top that sort of cheapened the experience.  Luckily the soup was followed by a perfectly prepared queen filet that was absolutely delicious. Perfect size and incredible flavor. We had a mashed potato that was decadent and nicely prepared asparagus that went perfectly with the steak.  We finished with a few deserts to pass around that were pretty good, and the red velvet cake was exceptional. It was a great place for a business meeting, but would also be perfect for a night out with friends or a date.  I wouldn't suggest bringing your kids here."}, {"review_id": "A5UH0pXSf7eicHdtd2FLPg", "user_id": "qBfs_9S0H7fZJyj-ue9_VQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Great steaks! If you love steak, this is a must try.

My boyfriend just got a new job, so he was ready to celebrate with a nice dinner. Upon entering, I thought the restaurant would be more upscale. However, when we walked over to our table, I was surprised to see just an average looking booth with very warm, brown tones. It was a nice change compared to the usual stuffiness that correlates to a steak house. What we ordered:Cowboy Ribeye - Delicious! The Ribeye has more fat than I preferred but was extremely flavorful. My boyfriend finished the entire cut in one sitting ! - $51Filet Mignon - My favorite cut! Lean and tender - without the fat. I would recommend pairing this cut with their truffle butter. It melts on the steak beautifully and tastes AMAZING - $45Brussel Sprouts - Hmmmmm, perfectly, crisp Brussel Sprouts topped with parmesan. Need I say more ?!?? - $9Garlic Mashed Potatoes - Should you get the mashed with the cheese or without ?!?? This was already a heavy meal, so we opted without. Still amazing nonetheless - $9"}, {"review_id": "wN2atm-j2-MGehKc_7VQNw", "user_id": "B0mjjn-xDal9kmtqSv0u4A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "In town for the packers game the fellas and I were looking for our yearly top dollar steak house meal.  I think we were lucky to get a reservation at 8:30 on a Saturday in the bar area tables.  Service was first rate and the atmosphere was just as it should be.  Started with the french onion soup as I will order it wherever it is is served as I am a fan.  While it had all the correct parts of a french onion soup it wasn't traditional and not a hit like I'd hoped.  It was lacking plenty of onion, not in a crock, rather a regular bowl.  We all had a steak option, I went with the veal chop porterhouse.  I didn't think it was all that great, especially for $50.  I wish the steaks came with some options to customize them, and I'm not a fan of bone-in steaks I don't know why I ordered it.  The sides were off the charts.  Brussel sprouts were amazing as was the gouda mac n cheese.  I finished with the key lime cheese cake which was good.  I would come back here, just need to select a better entree."}, {"review_id": "3ZeMVgO8fKUtQYWcpCYMhw", "user_id": "JzbUaFHf37qtG4sHUTFwTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "This place is awesome!!!

Time to write a review. I have been here a handful of times for appetizers, drinks and dessert but never for a sit down meal. Went last night for my husbands birthday dinner. Drinks: Ordered a extra dirty martini. Beware this is a legit martini and super good at that. I have had a apple martini here before as well and it was tart and refreshing. Appetizers: Get the shrimp and the kabobs if you can. They are the perfect size for two people to share. The flavor profile of the kabobs was smokey and rich. The shrimp are spicy and really good. Bread service: This was really nice. They offer three types of butter and small little bread pieces. I really liked the butter options they offered each had a different flavor composition. Main Course: I had the drunken strip done medium (14 ounces). It came cooked exactly the way I asked. It was topped with mushrooms and a super yummy wine sauce. The sauce was thin but I liked that because I could dip the steak and mushrooms in it (bread too!). My husband had the Chilean sea bass which I really liked with the cream sauce it was served with. The salad that I had that came with my meal had the perfect basil vinaigrette. I want to figure out how to make it as it was so refreshing before a heavy steak entree. Dessert: We go out of our way to stop in to share a giant piece of cake here some nights. The red velvet and carrot cake are to die for. The giant piece of red velvet was easily shared amongst the four of us at dinner.  You really have to stop in. It is expensive but you pay for the quality of the food here."}, {"review_id": "KNSskwC8XW5sNaLpsrdgtA", "user_id": "Dkx218--XvJKqNkksaLJcQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/23/2017", "text": "I love the atmosphere, contemporary upscale steakhouse. We had a reservation but since it wasn't busy we were able to have drinks at the bar until we wanted to eat. The bartender made me a great extra dry martini. They have a great wine list and a good selection of beer including many local brews on tap and bottles.  One of the things I like here is that your food is served in courses and you have time to enjoy them before the next course comes out. I recommend the bacon wrapped scallops, large and perfectly cooked. We had an 8 oz filet and NY strip, both were cooked perfectly to the exact doneness we ordered.  For sides we had the garlic mashed potatoes and mac and cheese, sides are for two so their was plenty for both of us.  The warm sourdough bread is amazing as well. Because it was our anniversary we were offered a complimentary dessert, we had the red velvet cake, one slice could easily feed 4 people, this is a must have if you come here.  The 4 star is because the mac and cheese was kind of bland, and the service was a little slow but I would still recommend because the overall experience is great."}, {"review_id": "sGaTTcznykusugrlfPcFHw", "user_id": "cOvCmehV1wyjy3_wsyJDug", "rating": 2.0, "date": "8/13/2017", "text": "Expensive.  Went in January - wasn't busy, but service was mediocre.  Wine we ordered with meal showed up at end of dinner.  Steak was good, but husband's salmon was very salty.

Read great reviews so thought we should check it out. It was packed so book ahead for sure. I made an 8:30 reservation the day of for the lounge area. That's all that was available otherwise eat dinner at 10pm. We got there early but that didn't speed up our seating which was ok. So we found a bench in the bar area and ordered some drinks and an appetizer. Service was great. So was the company - we met a lovely couple celebrating their 28th wedding anniversary. Mark came to find us and sat us at a great table in the dining area (upgraded from the lounge area) facing the window so we could people watch. My favorite thing to do! Drinks: salted caramel for Mom and kettleone and soda for me.  Tasty! Ordered a bottle of Clancy's Red with dinner as well because you can take whatever you don't finish with you!Appetizer: Wisconsin cheese plate. Wonderful assortment of cheeses. I love cheese! Hhmmm. Dinner: We shared the filet mignon and lobster. SOOO tender and juicy. Lobster with butter - you can never go wrong.  I noticed we were brought a different vintage of wine which our waitress explained can happen but offered us a free dessert. We got the red velvet cake. Oh WOW! It was as big as my head! Deelicious!!The overall experience was a high 4-star but I'm giving 5 stars for Mark who above and beyond in customer service. He saw us walking out with a huge box for the slice of cake and our leftover wine and asked right away if he could get us a bag. And then went to get plastic forks. He was so attentive and observant. Kudos to Mark!!"}, {"review_id": "IE7fGBoi5OOYAI3jCOok1w", "user_id": "opz65N1iQ_Q_HsDmnqHd6g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/1/2017", "text": "Located in Green Bay's downtown area, the Republic Chophouse is a nice, upscale place to head out for dinner.
