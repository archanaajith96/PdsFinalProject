I had never been to Montana, let along Billings, so I was taken away by the number of casinos. As it turns out, the Montana Brewing Company is joined with the Hooligan's casino. It was a busy evening and looked crowded, so I was surprised to be seated so quickly. The Hubster and I order local brews when possible and enjoyed the gold and IPA (Quasar and Sandbagger); best elixirs after a day in the car. Since all we saw from the road was cows, we figured anything beef was a good bet (ouch, pun not intended!). He had the Stockyard Nachos, which were tasty and messy. In fact, all his meals that day were messy (his observation, not mine). I had the Shredded Beef Chimichanga (and why does spell check want to turn Chimichanga into Michigan?) which was an awesome blend of meaty, cheesy and spicy. Rachel was one speedy server who kept our glasses full and treated us like we were regulars. I'm not sure when we'll be in town again, but I'm ready to try another beer already!"}, {"review_id": "cj9dH3j-vUamVdUKaXNi2g", "user_id": "1a5_Rwy9yfHz_ptsTKcsMA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "4/10/18.

Fish tacos killing it as always. Fish is super crispy but still has plenty of fishy insides (not just breaded bread). Sauce is tangy but not spicy.

The atmosphere is upbeat and energetic. The staff are friendly, helpful and accommodating. The food service is quick, but cared for. The huckleberry mule is to die for! A great place to hangout with anyone! P.S. If I could take the aioli for the sweet potato fries home in a jug, I would!

A really nice place with engaging staff with music that is not too loud. They have a sidewalk seating area but we opted for the darker interior equipped with air conditioning.Serving all their owns brews and a moderately good variety of dining options.The place is a lot larger than it first looks with a really deep dining area. And guys (I assume gals are the same) extra bonus points for the heavy industrial, welded toilet partitions!

I walked around the billings downtown area for a while and this place defiantly stood out as a popular hub for locals.The bad: it's been a while since I've been to a restaurant with a \"modern brewery vibe\"  but a menu reminiscent of a state fair food cart; the menu is all over the place and caters to all, which is easy to do when most of the menu obviously comes frozen and they just pop it in the deep frier. I'm pretty sure they even deep fried my garlic before they roasted it and it was crazy dry. The ugly:  I hope it wasn't their intention but what really gets me is when businesses throw in words like \"local\" because they know it's a marketing key words, so make sure you read right when you look at their \"local favorites\" section because I feel this section really should be called \" biggest contributors to local obesity none of which are locally sourced\""}, {"review_id": "XlZDrJJO_qtYZag1M6EWsQ", "user_id": "3UhNWpWSlqhbQdAH5XvKKQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/25/2017", "text": "Good food!  The Mac and cheese is really good.  Both Hamburger and Rock Crab.  The fish taco was good except too much filling.  The amount of fish was fine but way too much lettuce and tomato.  The Asiago appetizer was okay but the sauce was quite thin but the dipping bread was delicious.  Good cider from Olympia.  IPA was okay.  The E.S.B. tasted more like an IPA along with the pale ale.  Tasted too much like an IPA."}, {"review_id": "WPPejYBf6ABKDt7XV9hZ_g", "user_id": "39bL-LzL78Cag8R9L8yXPA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/14/2017", "text": "Out of towner that was looking for a cool place to grab a couple craft beers and enjoy the local scene. MBC had great vibes, great food, and great customer service. I went during happy hour (4-6), but just the wells were $2.50. I tried out their stout, IPA, pale ale, and sampled just about everything else. I was told they had free apps at the bar at 5, but I sat at the bar and didn't come across any. I ordered the asiago cheese dip and it was fantastic. Lots of flavor, good portion for only $8.99. The three beers and app came to just under $20--- what a bargain! I truly enjoyed my time there. Hopefully next time I'm back the weather won't be so hot so I can enjoy the outdoor seating. Plenty of stools around the bar as well as small tables and a booth seating area. It was pretty busy, but the place sure knows how to fit a bunch of people. Great ambience. Can't wait to come back."}, {"review_id": "-kPrZB05zwU6usrv5zIXXw", "user_id": "bzuxMFF_BnAUO1519vvg-Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "Great atmosphere, awesome service, friendly customers and staff, and the food is to die for.

Sat at the bar and the bartender gave me good service. He is cool.However, 2 gals on staff decided to lay 2 large boxes on the cooler right in front of the counter I was sitting at and sift through them and talk. I think they were organizing a large carry out order. It was loud, annoying, and they were blocking the bartender from being able to serve me. I don't know what they were thinking. I had to move to the other side of the bar. As a server myself, I guess it just bothers me that restaurant staff would be so oblivious to their guests.
