The coconut was nowhere near overpowering (it definitely did not taste like sunscreen, as some coconut-flavored things do), and mixed with the taste of lime, it was a perfect combination. Would definitely get again. My friend had the house margarita and liked it as well.As for the tacos -- WOW! The one we liked the most was the Avocado taco -- it has fried avocado, beans, salsa, cheddar, and ranch crema. I really liked the crunchiness of the *fried* avocado. My second favorite was the BBQ -- smoked pork shoulder w/ Dr. Pepper BBQ, slaw, and cheddar. I loved how the taco truly tasted smoky, it was so good! My third taco was the Pastor, Vintage Style -- pineapple marinated pork served with salsa roja, guac, and pickled corn. It wasn't bad by any means, but I don't think I'd get this one again. Just eh. My friend had the Chicken Bacon Ranch and said it was good! While other restaurants like this may serve rice and beans with their entrees, I honestly liked how Vintage didn't include the sides. Rather, they let the tacos shine on their own and take the spotlight! I was much happier to be perfectly full with my three tacos instead of feeling too full if I would have been given rice and beans to eat on the side too.Looking forward to more visits to this cute restaurant in downtown Green Bay! On my list for tacos to try is he Baja, Barbacola, and the Buffalo Chicken :)"}, {"review_id": "7dig83OQScG_6lzUMQpHow", "user_id": "1_BL_PU7ZbFCIecCHeX0HA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Where else would we be?

Since then I have tried almost all the tacos and drinks now.Salsa and chips- The chips are thick and well seasoned here. They pair well with the salsa's they serve. The salsa's are always different each time I come in which I like. This past visit the roasted squash and tomatillo  salsas were my favorite. They will even refill your chips if you need more. At $5 this is a great thing to share with the table. Corn- I have no words for how creamy and luscious this was on my palate.  I order it every time I come and sometimes I am willing to share. Margaritas- Small in size but always light and flavorful. They have a small drink menu outside of these little beauties. Tacos- This place has a limited menu. You really have appetizers and tacos as your options. I always order corn tortillas and try to pick something new each time. This past time I got the special \"Green eggs and Ham\" and the Korean taco. I have never had a bad taco here and they are so creative in their offering. My favorites are the swordfish taco and the Pastor. In closing they have limited seating so you may have to wait for a table and service can be spotty at times. The quality of the food and the creativity is totally worth a trip in though. Stop in!"}, {"review_id": "RhME-4XPP0NU_Ai8KH2JMQ", "user_id": "p0CA3juBAIkSMI9hkE5FKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2017", "text": "Finding a good taco in Green Bay, WI is easier now that the Cantina has moved in where the old Cafe Espresso was.

The staff was especially attentive and the drinks were outstanding. Decor is catchy and trendy just like you would expect. Would love to give it five stars but the prices are higher than reasonable.Five dollars for a street taco does not make any sense. I think if they could get a hold of their pricing the place with earned five stars from most of us. My best guess is that they are in a trendy area of town next to the Meyer Theatre and that's what is driving the prices."}, {"review_id": "oxkqv6_-YGfsnyrXcSMgZQ", "user_id": "BRithUqebsMViT-CIiK7_w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/4/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Update on 3/4- Still great food, however staff upstairs was very bad. I ordered a tap Spotted Cow and was served a beer with so much head that I lost 1/4 of my beer. She was inattentive.  Hand down - amazing food! My husband and I went here for a date night, and we thoroughly enjoyed everything! My only qualm is that beer is a tad expensive ($4.75 for a pint of Spotted Cow), but not a deal breaker. We had the chips n salsa. So good! The butternut squash salsa was excellent. My husband had 3 tacos and I had 2, and we were pretty full when we left. All around superb experience with the great food and friendly staff.

I had the guero taco and the carnitas, both were incredibly flavorful and all of the different flavors came together beautifully! We had the churro's for dessert and they were great! Super authentic!

Meat was tender and the flavors meshed well together - $5Barbacola - Hmmmmm, smoked brisket. This was my favorite taco out of the three ! - $5North-East Side King - Tastes like a Korean fusion taco. I appreciate the idea, but it was too salty. I barely took two bites before deciding that I couldn't eat it anymore - $4Peach Margarita - I barely tasted any alcohol...I'd probably recommend sticking to a beer next time - $5.75Overall, the tacos are definitely more expensive than your average Mexican style street tacos - with just meat, cilantro, and onions.
