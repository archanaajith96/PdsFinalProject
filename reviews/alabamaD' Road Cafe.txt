The dining room is open and inviting, and we immediately felt in our element (except the air conditioner seemed to be set on max because it was cold in there!). The server showed us the daily menu on a small whiteboard, and we noticed that at the bottom it said that vegan and vegetarian options were available. We asked about them, and she had the chef come out and talk to us personally.Chef Janett gave us some options, and then whipped up a vegan plate of veggies and a masa-type bun that was delicious. She also presented fried sweet plantains, our favorite Latin dessert.We thoroughly enjoyed the meal and getting to meet Chef Janett. She's a jewel, and I wish we lived closer so we could visit again!"}, {"review_id": "wsDLUZDaTYkdm1qZyZz-og", "user_id": "JRr-cPI15dpg4lTG65eM9Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "This place is amazing. I'm in from out of town, and I desperately wish this restaurant was in my city. If you are staying in a hotel in the area and are trying to decide if you want to eat here - do it. Just a few options, Latin Soul food, literally the first bite of my meal we one of the best bites I've ever had."}, {"review_id": "kaeuMDfqScwJEQtOB8jV_Q", "user_id": "dIWD89dHoC_rmnjNw5m3eQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "This restaurant is located in downtown Montgomery and situated very close to City Hall. It is very clean and has plenty of seating. The ambience is comfortable and inviting. Interestingly enough, in one of the photos you'll notice that there are Italian chefs behind the counter; this seems to be a theme in Montgomery as several restaurants that we went to had them. We went on a Saturday morning so there wasn't a need for more than 1 person as wait staff.  This does not mean the restaurant was empty, but the young lady that took care of us handled it well. She was very attentive and answered all of our questions with a smile. Now to the food, we had the Crazy Eggs Skillet and the Criollo.  Both dishes were good but our eggs were overcooked. We also had coffee and a dessert very similar to a sopapilla.  The coffee was good (but a little week) and sopapilla was absolutely delicious. If you were looking for a good Latin/south American breakfast we suggest this restaurant."}, {"review_id": "zAq39HlesbrUEv9iNzBqMw", "user_id": "ad2B4SvsIwWxNpmtBxaH1Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Can't remember the best breakfast you've ever had in your life?

Arepas are just weird to me, (heavy, greasy, doughy and bland) and I think that I have had my last.  I would just rather have a full slice of toast and skip the Arepa all together.  While my meal was nice, I was shocked by my husband's omelet.  It was delivered DOA because it was flat and very brown, (what I consider burned and inedible).  He decided to eat it anyway, but I think he regretted it.  It was filled with ham and grilled veggies and served with very tough turkey bacon.  My husband never eats less than two pieces of toast with his breakfast so that one half piece of toast was just odd.  I have learned that if I am not in a French or known restaurant, I need to request to have my omelet prepared light and with no brown at all.Although I enjoyed my breakfast, I wish that more attention had been given to the care and cleanliness of the restaurant which had that unclean and broken down aesthetic.  The restroom had no toilet paper so the employee simply grabbed a used roll from the men's room.  The water facet was fixed to the wall but fell off when you touched it,so that it was difficult to use.  (My husband said that this also happened in the men's room).  The toilet is a clear see through design that reflects dirt very well. This restaurant has great potential but the owners need to give more time and attention to food preparation, as well as the the overall aesthetic and cleanliness of D'Road.  I wish them well!"}, {"review_id": "7Tf_niVNMPCFM_RBfSFebQ", "user_id": "msIRe0ESQI4AeJdcJQhcCA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/13/2017", "text": "Came in a Wednesday morning for breakfast. I was greeted by the owner Janet who was very nice. Got some fresh coffee with a side of steam milk. Really flavorful.They give you bottled water instead of tap water which I appreciate. The restaurant feels like when you come home to eat at your mom's house. All the love and manners.I ordered the Arepa with ham, egg, and cheese. It was an excellent choice, so much flavor and very fulfilling. They give you a small sauce with it. I want to say is avocado base and it tasted amazing.

We had planned lunch elsewhere, but when we found a parking spot it was right in front of D'road, so we decided to give it a try. It is unlike most dining experiences.  When you walk in, you choose your seats and then go get your drinks. Coffee, water, unsweet tea, or sweet tea. Lemon is already added, be prepared! I wasn't expecting it, but it wasn't too much so still good. Then you go up to the counter. Ms.Jeanette will walk you through all of the options. Everything is amazingly well prepared and delicious. Different options on different days, so you never know what you are going to get, but all of it will be delicious! You will wish Me. Jeanette was your Venezuelan grandmother! You feel like family. It's very relaxed. It's all healthy and she has many Paleo & gluten free options also. It's extremely clean also.

I took her suggestion and ordered the crazy eggs. She added chicken and made it spicy like we wanted! Expertly presented and deliciously made. They have pickled peppers and other veggies in mason jars at every table for garnishing and they were fresh and delish! The location was great, right in downtown and there were parking spots (paid on weekdays) right in front. The ambience was lively (I believe they remodeled some other business into a restaurant - they were pretty creative and made a very interesting decor) and the price was right!
