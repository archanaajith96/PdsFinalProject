I'm from Chicago, and this place is pretty close to latin food. The reason is not 5* is because the salsa was too watery, the Guatemalan chicken bean-rice had overcooked beans and the slaw was dressed too heavy; also the fries that came with the kids meal were terrible, and the onions in the fajitas tasted weird. The kids chicken quesadilla was AMAZING! My toddler ate the whoooole thing! My Guatemalan coconut chicken was tasty, and my husband was very pleased with his children fajitas (he just didn't eat the onion). Another disappointing thing was that we stopped here on a Monday evening, 30 min before closing and the crew started cleaning after we sat down. It was a little annoying to have ppl vacuum and sweep the floors while we ate. But we get it, slow weekday, we were the only ones there, came in late... At least the food was good."}, {"review_id": "1x2vfMAXe-zl2IqjBHEJIQ", "user_id": "oCKYSa49pDuReBkTuI46IA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/20/2017", "text": "The food here is amazing. I have to give this place four stars due to the service. We did not get refills, I had to ask a different waitress for a cocktail as the waitress did not come back to get our cocktail order after giving us water (we ordered our entrees and water and said we needed just a minute to decide on a cocktail). She did not come and check back in at all after we placed our entree order until we had to flag down a different server for the tortillas that did not come out with our entree. She noticed us talking to a different server then and walked over to ask if everything was okay. This was about 20 minutes after our entree hit the table. She dropped our check off while walking by and didn't ask us if we wanted dessert. I will go back and see if service is better next time, if so I will update my review because the food deserves five stars."}, {"review_id": "lnk9d0iHvrm7uAhdsRkxgg", "user_id": "lPNxg0oIDnQ4fRMQScgT2g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Fantastic!!

As a Cuban, used to actual Hispanic food, this is a joke. I always ask for my food on separate plates, so it does not touch and they always without a doubt bring it all together. Beyond frustrating as I hate the mix of flavors. Never even offered​ to fix it or remake my order. It's funny because the only people ever here are \"gringos\" and honestly that's why they're still in business. My family has a running joke that there's a reason why Latinx people never go here - it's because the food isn't good, ​but Americans don't know the difference. Los Paisanos is so much better, friendlier staff, and cheaper."}, {"review_id": "Jl60I1jaXB7Yz4iQfXIwKQ", "user_id": "wwsXjtVHNblXSaXcIjNCvQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/29/2017", "text": "Looking for another restaurant but it was closed for the day.

We stopped here while in Sioux Falls on vacation and were looking for a non sports bar place to stop for dinner. I enjoyed the veggie fajita and my boyfriend had a burrito.

The restaurant was very clean and welcoming. The staff was all very pleasant and attentive. We were greeted at our table with complimentary chips and salsa. The menu had decent options, but I was hoping for a taco/enchilada combo plate to which I didn't see any. I decided on the enchiladas verdes. The green sauce was good, but had a sweet taste to it. My boyfriend got a burrito which looked amazing. The food was good, but we both felt it was a little expensive compared to other places we've been to with similar items.

If you are from anywhere remotely south of Kansas, you will be very disappointed. The salsa they serve is cold and bland, like it was poured from a restaurant sized Pace salsa jug from Costco. I asked the sever for a skinny margarita on the rocks and just got a blank stare. Apparently \"house\" or \"strawberry\" are the only acceptable requests. When my house arrived, it was a good size but obviously born from a cheap sweet and sour mix. Weak and tart. My food was actually decent. Carne Asada. Not spectacular but about what you'd expect from a generic chain south of Kansas. Overall not great."}, {"review_id": "KT6mtBYOF1LTolsfUtk6hw", "user_id": "cQTSdet9EZFPnGJS8SDHvQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "11/14/2017", "text": "I tried one of their cakes at a friends house.
