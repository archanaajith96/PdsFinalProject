Their selections goes beyond the usual pancakes/french toast/benedict combo (which was great for my fussy Dad). We did, however, tried the benedicts (salmon for me, fried oysters for my husband) following our waiter's recommedation. I was a bit surprised at first by their hollandaise sauce as it's more liquid than what I'm used to (and also by the little quantity) but I have to admit it was a good move. Benedicts tend to be very filling (and sometimes too heavy on the stomach), but here quantities are enough to leave you hungry for desert. Go for the cinammon bun, it's delicious. My fussy Dad picked the traditional scrambled eggs that comes with grit - and they were really good! Great selection of drinks/cocktails and service was perfect (they accommodated my request to have some space for my stroller and also to give us a table accessible for my mother in crutches)."}, {"review_id": "G1QUL_MIv8LeinaS0jPIMA", "user_id": "xw_FIKpKqLiZR8yhqLRsyw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Amanda attended to me the entire visit , she was a rock star , down to earth and very relaxed vibe , she had a smile on her face most of the time I looked up , which means to me she is happy working here ... happy people better vibes better dining experience !    I have come here twice now once for dinner and now for breakfast, both times I had pork belly on my plate, this morning I had pork belly eggs Benedict which was fantastic it also included home style fries and fresh fruit, I also added the dude abides drink which was perfect for the breakfast. Overall the food has wonderful flavor and is cooked very well I can tell in that kitchen somewhere is a guy that cares about his meals coming out the way he plans .    They have plenty of seating and I like the atmosphere it is very laid-back and relaxing, I personally enjoy sitting at the bar tables. They have a full bar with plenty of options for you to choose from, one can never complain against options. They also have delicious desserts and also some very good appetizers or smaller meals for the the people that aren't that hungry !   Right across the street is a massive parking garage, if you come here on weeknights or weekends especially you'll have a hard time finding parking I suggest you do one of the following things Park 2 to 3 blocks away and walk or pay for parking in the parking garage.     Their hours are kind of interesting, Monday and Tuesday hours are 11:30 AM to 9:00pm . Wednesday Thursday hours are 11:30 am to 9:30 pm . Friday hours are 11:30 AM to 10:30 PM. Saturday hours are 10:30 AM to 10:30 PM.  And Sunday hours are the strangest which is 9:30 AM to 2:30 PM and then 5 PM it opens back up and closes at 9 PM.  So definitely they are more of a brunch versus breakfast kind of place.    I would say if you like good food and very nice staff and an overall good experience come give this place a try."}, {"review_id": "bKjyYTb8kSwlb_cKKz1D8g", "user_id": "yYOAYtu974oBfDf1FHvjFg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Went here for an early dinner Wednesday night. The people are super friendly. Our host, server, and food runner were very sweet. They were quick to keep our water classes full. Atmosphere is good, the outside facade doesn't really queue you in to how nice it looks inside. We had the pulled chicken and dumplings and the butternut Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was very flavorful and came out in a cast iron skillet. Presentation was good. My wife had the pulled chicken and dumplings. She said it was just average. Found it a little pricey for what we got.

I'm so surprised of the high reviews. Maybe I came on a bad Monday night.I've had this book marked for a while and really wanted to try the steamed mussels.I've tried a few different cheese boards but I thought this one was decent. Nothing but average.The steamed mussels were good and smelled wonderful and I adored the fact that they had bacon bits and small potato pieces. But some of the mussels were undercooked and it was lukewarm temperature. I'm not sure why it wasn't hot. It should have been cooked for at least one or two more minutes.I also got the butternut macaroni with bacon. I felt like there was way too much bread crumbs which was very over powering and did not taste a hint of garlic. The macaroni was cooked very well and if it wasn't for all that bread crumb it probably would have been better. I even mixed it but still eh. I only took a couple bites and was pretty much over it. Took it togo but I will not eat it.Tried the chicken wontons and the wontons themselves were severely over cooked and tasted mushy and unappetizing.Service was okay. Not greeted when entered. It was pretty empty but service was still slow. Had to ask for a straw twice and waited a while for a refill.The place itself is nice and has a bar although I did not drink.Waste of money 5/5."}, {"review_id": "NEdlrB6Rbi9jEfTpWsc8Ag", "user_id": "tA8s77RZqAHhBtf6Oc7AdQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Wow.Came in with low expectations on a busy Saturday night and was blown away!Went with a large party so I was able to try lots of different menu items and I cannot wait to come back here!Standouts were the Duckaroni and the salmon. The Sockeye Salmon had an outer crispy layer and almost nutty taste that you wouldn't believe! Underneath that layer the salmon was cooked beautifully (medium rare) and was moist and delicious. Paired with roasted sweet potatoes, mushrooms, and a green sauce the dish deserved a standing ovation.The Duckaroni was rich, intense, and everything you've ever wanted. The creamy-ness and depth of this oven roasted Mac will forever ruin Mac and cheese for me! The flavor is intense but keeps you coming back for more without over saturating your mouth. Best Mac and cheese I've ever had. Period.Honorable mentions include the sharp cheddar, garlic, and bacon mac, the Carmel pot, and the cheesecake. (FYI Carmel pot better than Cheesecake)Good but not great menu items were the sage chicken dumplings, the tomato soup, and the biscuits (the jams that came with the biscuits were fantastic though - honey orange truffle butter and a magical tomato jam crafted by the most powerful wizards in all the land )They take reservations so we had literally no wait time!"}, {"review_id": "6X-rHjOKHRo5Nqil40SDEQ", "user_id": "Vl-c9zRq-tcst4uC8GG1hw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Celebrated my birthday lunch here on a Monday afternoon and it was delicious!Maybe because of the time and day we came in, the inside was dark and empty. So we opted for outdoor seating which seemed like everyone else's choice because that's where all the customers were. Such a calm, quiet and beautiful day it wasMy meal was SO GOOD!!! It was perfect for me. I chose the Shaved Steak sandwich which had a big hearty stack of thinly sliced meat inside. The meat was delicious and the texture reminds me of the meat at Korean Bbq places. The bread was nice n toasted. What I loved was that the waitress recommended to get a half sandwich, a cup of their tomato soup, and salad. All three together was an amazing combo. Great presentation too... tomato soup was in a cute mason jar. I definitely recommend My bf got the EBLT which just means they added a runny egg to a BLT. It was brown sugar bacon and it tasted yum! I enjoyed the bite I took but my bf wasn't feeling the egg... But that's just his preference. Why did he order a sandwich that he knew had egg??? Don't know haha. It was a little simple for bday meal so I'm glad I got the shaved steak.Sandwiches are $13.5 - $15 They serve alcohol as well as non alcoholic mixed drinks too which are refreshing.I love the little art that they have. Like a small mural painted on a wall in their back patio and the big picture of RON BURGUNDY in their bar. (Anchorman fan, anyone??)Successful bday lunch in my opinion"}, {"review_id": "K6xA0EoxXkM-sPdyU1KsoA", "user_id": "kwjfwrE4Qs6ZblePxNeQcQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/10/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I used to absolutely love this place and would recommend it to everyone that would ask me for a brunch recommendation. We made the drive from Anaheim over the weekend and were sorely disappointed.There wasn't a wait so we were seated immediately. Our server came by and we ordered immediately since we both order the same thing whenever we visit. I ordered the Beef Cheek Hash and a Bloody Mary and the bf ordered a Hangar Steak Benedict and a Bloody Mary. As we awaited our dishes we realized that it was taking a while for the drinks to come out. But, we just hung out and listened to the Bluegrass band outside. Then, it felt like our food took forever to come out. Again, it wasn't too busy so maybe the kitchen was just backed up?Our dishes arrived and it was a completely different dish than what I normally get. The portion was smaller, but the price was the same, and as I ate it I realized the huge chunks of tender beef cheek that I used to get were now measly shreds of beef cheek mixed in with corn and diced peppers. The poached eggs were not poached, but were a few seconds from being hard boiled. My bf's benedict arrived on top of small biscuits and small chunks of hangar steak. He sliced into his eggs and they were hard boiled. Not sure if they sat for too long or if they weren't poached properly, but he sent the dish back. When they brought it back out, he cracked the eggs open and they were probably a few seconds away from being hard boiled. However, he made it work and ate the dish.Lastly, we were both a bit disappointed to see that nothing was taken off for him having to send his dish back. Yea, we could have asked for something off, but they saw those eggs weren't poached. It would have gone a long way to comp a drink or something.Hopefully the cinnamon roll hasn't changed, but I don't think we'll be back to verify. So bummed."}, {"review_id": "FdMtyvthU-kwR8uyLoaCXA", "user_id": "PFlVOgq8MnHkffxy-40vgA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "We came here for brunch. 20 min wait for an outdoor table and no wait for indoor dining so we sat indoors. Nice atmosphere with dark mahogany and leather decor with dim lighting even if it didn't exactly scream weekend brunch.Food took a while but we understood it was a busy time. Heard about their cinnamon roll-- they had it in their menu in bold with an arrow pointing to it so I had to get it haha. The center was flavorful. The outer parts were a little too crusty. It was good but it was not the classic, rich cinnamon roll I would prefer to indulge in. Had beef cheek hash--ate it all! My friend ordered the salmon benedict. Salmon was cooked with the skin on which seemed an uncommon presentation for a fish benedict. Coffee was strong and good. I appreciated how they had brown sugar cubes and cold cream available with it.Servers were very nice and seemed happy to be there."}, {"review_id": "Kf6zvU2LP1Du5FAXgxEmbw", "user_id": "gxEynAfkQBbP_N-z9VrwHg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Came across this restaurant through Yelp. SO GLAD MY BOYFRIEND AND I DECIDED TO TRY THIS RESTAURANT TONIGHT. We ordered cheddar and chives biscuits and steamed mussels for appetizers. The biscuits came with honey and orange butter, and tomato jam. They were not dry at all!! THE STEAMED MUSSELS ARE TO DIE FOR. This is my favorite dish here. I'm full from dinner and I'm still craving the mussels. They were nice a creamy and flavor was perfect. I got the braised beef cheeks for my main course. It was okay.. The beef was super soft, BUT it was SO BLAND AND SWEET. The mashed potatoes and gravy was bland too. I felt like the dish needed some salty factors because each bite I took became sweeter and sweeter and blander. My boyfriend got the duck confit. This dish was SOOO good. Duck was flavored perfectly. It also came with this corn bread thing and if i could describe the flavor, it would be like corn bread and elote had a baby except there was no chile. I can't wait to come back for the steamed mussels, and to try other items on the menu"}, {"review_id": "nPZlbtw2CQ_87esO7fM41Q", "user_id": "iP0jK9FiAJ5MVC2YU7uVEw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Don't use the app OpenTable to make reservations!  They make you put a credit card down and if you don't show up they will charge you $25 per person!  Food is really good, especially the burger!!!!  Oh my Jesus!!!!  Awesome salad and okay Craft beer selection.   Iced teas are good too.  Patio is cool and inside is cool too, but patio is cool cuz they have those little wierd flys inside, so I suggest you eat outside."}, {"review_id": "CPEZY3LnuMQqDqBY4XwZYQ", "user_id": "CSSDt8EtG-zdPmWzzNOdTw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Had dinner here the other night with some girlfriends.  The restaurant is super cute and the there's a parking garage right across the street so it was super convenient.  It was a Saturday night, not busy so they sat us right away.  The waitress was super nice, she checked on us often.  We got a cheese board.  The brie was the best thing on there!  Could of done without some of the salami but it was still pretty.  I would pass on the biscuits because they were a little dry.  I ordered tomato soup, also just ok but definitely could pass.  For my entree I ordered the sea bass.  The fish was amazing.  Cooked perfect.  The vegetables were a little dry.  Most of the girls I went with loved their food.  My one girlfriend who ordered salmon, her salmon was over cooked.  But she didn't complain.  She's a saint!  I hate over cooked fish.  But all in all it was a great time and the food was good."}, {"review_id": "EhHTuL0hzeYqHUpD44D29w", "user_id": "NgS7gJ3C68fFu1Os4Zx0bw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Called to get information on a possible event for about 50 people.

It has been years since my first trip in which I thoroughly enjoyed. This time around, instead of dinner I came for brunch, and was happy to see that the place is still lively, playing great live bluegrass music and the decor has been updated with the same vibe. I'm giving brunch three stars instead of four stars while everyone ate their meals and the service was fine, nothing was blow us away delicious and there were a few issues. The pork belly on my Benedict and the pork on another sandwich in the group were both a little over cooked/dry. My Benedict, which was served on a biscuit which I thought was a great idea (and I love it), was cold, the grits on another plate were not properly seasoned, and lastly even my michelada cocktail had a slightly watered down taste to it.

We ordered a variety of things: biscuits, mussels, cheese & meat plate, fries, secret hanger steak entree, beef cheeks, and chicken dumplings.

I usually go on the weekends for brunch to eat with friends or dine solo. I like how you have the option of sitting outside in the patio or inside. Inside is usually my go-to as I like the refreshing A/C.  Super relaxing environment. The ambiance is what I would describe as southern or Texas upscale ranch.  Come on a Sunday morning and the have a bluegrass band. My usual cocktail is the Carlton. The cherry bitters and berry liqueur is a fantastic mix  and the Rose brut gives it a nice punch. To eat, I have ordered (1) kitchen sink biscuits n gravy or (2) the two farm fresh eggs with bacon and grits. For the kitchen sink biscuits, I was expecting the sausage to be in pieces mixed with the biscuit. Instead there were a sausage link (like a kielbasa) split down the middle. The eggs came over easy just the way I like my eggs. Biscuit was dense and the bacon was pretty damn tasty. You can definitely taste the brown sugar. It came with a side of mixed fresh fruit - orange, cantaloupe and red grapes The serving portion was generous. Much more food than I could have finished in one sitting. For the eggs and bacon, the portion is smaller than I expected. The star of the dish are the grits. They come in a small mason jar and are full of butter. So tasty!  If you are watching your figure, maybe not get this dish as it also comes with potatoes.  You have to try the bluegrass cinnamon roll with cream cheese icing. It is the best thing on the menu! When I am solo, I opt to eat at the bar.  The service from the bartenders is hit and miss. Sometimes they are attentive and other times I have to flag them down to help me. The place gets busy around 10:30 am on the weekends.  It will get a little loud. I wouldn't recommend it for a large group where you want to catch up and talk.The prices are a little on the high side but the food is great and the service is fine. I think you are paying for the quality of ingredients and ambiance. I really enjoy myself as I continue to come back!"}, {"review_id": "-J9ByLTB2_9KnHZE16vlSA", "user_id": "RjJ-W2SA80kWm5YcB3autw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I really enjoyed this place a lot.

Love it!- Crispy Duck Confit ($26) = broccolini-mushroom hash, and fennel soubise. I love everything duck meat and they prepared it well. - Seared Wild Sockeye Salmon ($27) = sunchoke purée, maitake mushroom, and heirloom carrot. Nicely cooked.
