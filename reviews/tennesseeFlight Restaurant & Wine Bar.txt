We started out with the oceans flight appetizer and wine flight which was outstanding! My favorite entree on the oceans flight was the lobster ravioli! The seasonings and sauce were outstanding.My main entree was everything , it was the best 3 entree dish I've ever had. I had the Alaskan Halibat , soft shell crab, and the shrimp n grits!!! Omg my favorite entree was the shrimp and grits!!!! I have never liked shrimp and grits but after today I may always want this specific dish Our desert flight topped it all off, we had the banana foster bread pudding, the blueberry strudel, and the white chocolate blonde!!! My favorite dessert was the blueberry strudel!!! My overall experience was amazing and I can't wait to go back"}, {"review_id": "Ic64rkqU5ptkS4LOoQJqNQ", "user_id": "td-RLO3vjf7sYk51kS_JZg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Flight Restaurant & Wine bar is an impressive eatery located on Main Street in the heart of downtown Memphis. Plan ahead and make a reservation because this is a busy place! Stuart, our server, really made our dining experience special. He was knowledgeable about their extensive wine list. He had 3 women (all w/different taste in wine) to help find a bottle we would all be happy with - AND HE NAILED IT!!! We were celebrating a birthday and he made sure to make our birthday guest feel special. Thank you Stuart! The food & wine selections are extensive and unique. Which is what makes Flight a more elevated dining experience than the rest.We enjoyed everything so much & cant wait for our next experience!"}, {"review_id": "guez6i6JSzyjHpR2bIHIQA", "user_id": "Q3iDI_Im-JKQnh27oUA-lw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "This place was everything I could have ever asked for and more. My best friend and I took a vacation to Tennessee and planned out all the the food places we wanted to hit ahead of time. Flight popped up in my research and I knew we had to go here. We made a reservation the morning we arrived, on Open Table, for 5pm. When we walked in for dinner we were greeted by the host and seated right away. Our waitress then explained the premise of the restaurant. She recommended wines based on our tastes. We each ordered flights of food. I had the seafood flight and my friend made her own flight. The food was so delicious. I don't think I have words to describe how good it was. Of course we also ordered dessert flights. I ordered the chefs special flight and again my friend made her own. This spot will definitely be somewhere I have to visit again!"}, {"review_id": "h7aeXbcLRJ6nOpF0m2tE4w", "user_id": "mHoxDictMZa4cGZmXKbkYw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Classy restaurant in downtown Memphis with a \"flight\" concept.  Not only do they have wine flights, but they have soup, dessert, fish, steak, and dessert flights!  If you love tapas and the ability to try multiple entrees, this place is for you!I went a simpler approach and had the seafood ceviche and one small fish dish (black grouper).

The space is beautiful and romantic with a bar at the bottom and a second floor that has seating that looks over the restaurant below (my favorite spot to dine, though it can have a bit of a longer wait, but well worth it I think!).You can get flights of appetizers, entrees, desserts, and wine, or order straight off the menu for a regular portion. They typical have a soup flight which is my absolute favorite starter and will order every single time I come here. My other go to's are the seafood flight, and sparkling flight. But you really can't go wrong with anything here. They also serve up very creative flights with things like antelope and other non-standard fare. I've been 3 times and love my experience on each visit. They also change up the menu regularly so it's never the same thing. I've always had wonderful service but we have had to wait for a table despite a reservation on a busy night, but it wasn't terrible. Make sure to make a reservation before coming unless it's on an off night. Overall it's my favorite restaurant in Memphis and a place I will be returning to over and over again!"}, {"review_id": "aTRKC1r1jSmtrcIWiE9Gzg", "user_id": "cABwThg1iINhuyFkRnEBWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "My husband and I's dining experience at Flight was exceptional.

After regaining my composer from almost busting my ass on the slippery tile...just watch your step  I ordered the champagne bubbly flight and E ordered the scotch flight. Let's eat to the meat of the matter! The food was phenomenal!!!!!I had bison...elk...quail...game meat heavy but it's something I never do so I had to indulge. The portions folks! The portions were so much even for a flight, I couldn't finish them all. You will definitely get a good sense of the entree and not feel that cause it's a flight you are some how missing out. The atmosphere was wonderful, our table was a little tight as waiters walked back and forth. But overall a lovely Memphis experience!

I made reservations ahead of time and Im glad I did. It was a Sunday night and very busy. The restaurant is a decent size with an upstairs and patio area. We got to sit upstairs with a fabulous view of the gorgeous chandelier and outside area. Stuart was our server. He had excellent knowledge of the menu and top notch Southern hospitality service.  I would definitely ask for him if you go.  We started with a flight of wines each. My husband red of course and myself white.  My flight was called  ABC. They were delcious, slighty sweet wines.  We proceeded with an appetizer course that included the best crab cake I've ever had. Forgot the cake part, that baby was all moist, chunky crab pieces. It was the bomb!! The flight also had shrimp and lobster ravioli. It was delicious and worth the price.  We both had lobster bisque soup. It was good. Not one of the best I've had.  I mixed and matched my entree flight because the pre-set ones they had  just didnt work for this picky eater.   I had chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits, and  duck with sweet potatoes. Sadly, I did not love any of these three. Like I said, picky eater. I was busy scraping mushrooms, pecans, and gravy off my dishes. Obviously this did not hinder my rating. The portion size for one entree is what you can get at some 4 star restaurants for the same price and here you can have three different options. Love!! We ended the night with a very unnecessary dessert flight where the highlight was a bluberry toaster strudel with a decadent cream sauce.  Mmmmm. I also had a dessert wine flight and hubby went with a scoth flight.  We were beyond full. Uncomfortably full, but thats how good our experience was here. It didn't matter. We also spent way too much money here but it was worth it.  My hubby's only complaint is they do not carry espresso.  Don't come here if you're not ready to drop some dough and serious eating and drinking. Take advantage of this wonderful concept. A new fave restaurant for me."}, {"review_id": "uhk7ksbRgjupG3NqMfnMmw", "user_id": "E0VZHuM2GF0cNzf-ygyIHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Although we were here just a week ago for a glass of wine before seeing Wicked at the Orpheum, we returned this Sunday for brunch with friends; one of whom is a Trained Chef and HIGHLY Recommends Flight's Sunday Brunch.As usual, the food was Beautifully Presented, the Flavor Profiles were Exquisite; the Service was Exceptional (Great Job Josiah T)!!!  We enjoyed: Deviled Eggs & Fried Oysters with Bacon Relish (WOW!!!), Smoked Salmon (Beautifully Presented), French Quarter Scramble (Extraordinary Depths of Flavors), Small Plate Steak (Perfectly Medium), and a Cajun Pasta (Rated Superb by the Chef and this New Orleans native).  As usual, the libations (Mimosa, Bloody Mary, Wines) were FANTASTIC!!!  Unfortunately, we were too full to try desert, but we did see a few TEMPTING offerings being delivered to other tables.In downtown Memphis, we HIGHLY RECOMMEND Flight for a Sunday Brunch.  In fact, for years, we have and continue to RECOMMEND Flight as one of the Top Dining Experiences in downtown Memphis!!!"}, {"review_id": "9-nRkxObk6tQJKSLG5e0Tw", "user_id": "3-NALIg_KyTitEgpzyowtQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Came here for a drink and some snacks and so glad that we did!!!

The young man was very polite and our waiter notified him of our departure before we left the table. Robbie was our waiter though it was a big team effort by the whole staff delivering food, taking away dishes, etc. Robbie was very good at describing how it works with all the flights, mixing and matching if you'd like or doing one of their Pre-made flights of soup, salad, wine, appetizers, entrees, liquor, and dessert. My husband chose to pick his own including the gulf fish, pork tenderloin, and duck all which he enjoyed. I got the chef favorite flight all which I enjoyed as well. We had the chocolate dessert flight as well which was delightful. My husband had the world wonder red wine flight and I had the creme de la creme white wine flight which both came with descriptors. It was very hard to chose our favorites and so I'll just say you'll just have to go and pick your favorite! Will definitely continue to try different things on the menu next time since there is such a variety and all look sound good.

The concept of having flights for every course of the meal is fantastic. I am someone who loves to have a variety. We sat in the wine cellar which has beautiful decor. Our meal started with a flight of soup. We had the lobster bisque, seafood gumbo, and a watermelon gazpacho. All the soups were delicious. My favorite of the three was the seafood gumbo.For the entree, I ordered the steak flight. The bison was so tender and flavorful. The elk and filet were solid but the bison takes the cake. We ended with my favorite part of the meal. A desert flight. After looking at the desserts, we chose to make our own flight. We ordered the lava cake, bananas foster bread pudding, and the chocolate chip cookie soufflé. The banana pudding and lava cake were both great. The chocolate chip cookie soufflé is to die for. It is very rich so I wouldn't want a full dessert but the flight size is perfect."}, {"review_id": "4lTRfY5ekK8BQnnoB_SlyQ", "user_id": "U2PuGiwfJKShO0c2Vw4REQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/13/2017", "text": "We enjoyed our night here, but I am left with a few negative thoughts. The greeter managed to find us a small, comfortable table in the heated, enclosed footpath. It was a little noisy, but the place was packed and it was to be expected.The staffers were all very pleasant and the service was good. The food was excellent. We started with a salad, my wife had a flight including crab, lobster and shrimp, while I had veal scallopini. We ended the meal with, for her, lava cake, and for me, Memphis belle pie. I followed that with coffee. Again, service, food quality and  the environment were great.So, what were the negatives? I ordered a non-alcoholic beer. It was out of date and flat. There is no excuse for failing to keep an eye on stock (We know, we own a liquor store)...especially when the cost of that beer was $6.50; more than the cost of a six pack of it in Publix. I brought this to the attention of the waiter who was quick to bring me a Miller Lite as a replacement. The Miller Lite was, oddly, only $4.50, but I was still charged $6.50.My wife ordered an old fashioned with Knob Creek bourbon. They were $10 each, plus an extra $2 for the upgrade from stock to Knob Creek. Finally there was the coffee. They don't do espresso or fancy coffee, and the stewed coffee I was served was about what I would expect at a second class truck stop.However, when all this was mentioned to the staff, the extra charges were removed.We will go back to Flight because basically it is good. It is an expensive restaurant, and while we didn't think the value for money was altogether there, we still had a good night."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/flight-restaurant-and-wine-bar-memphis?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
