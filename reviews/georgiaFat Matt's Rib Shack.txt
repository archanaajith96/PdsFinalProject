The chicken was succulent and juicy whilst for the half rack of ribs that I got with it, one quarter was nice and bones just slid out whilst the other quarter seemed to be more dry and tough. I found that the beans was a bit too sour for my liking but it didn't detract from the rest of the food.

After going to Fox Bros, I came to Fat Matt's two days later. Fox Bros had more of a dry rub, while Fat Matt was wet. I came here on a recommendation from one of my friends who lived in Atlanta for 5 years. It was quite out of the way so I didn't think I was going to be able to make it. But then my Uber driver HIGHLY recommended this place... so I had to go. These ribs are fantastic. Full rack of ribs for $28. Sauce on the side. Their BBQ saucy is a bit more vinegar-y and sour. But the ribs were fall off the bones tender. Had a pint of Sweet Water by my side. Although these ribs were really good, I couldn't help but to think about the ribs I had at Fox Bros. It's not really fair to compare the two since its two very different style, I did prefer Fox Bros BBQ sauce more. But Fat Matt holds his own and you can tell its a local favorite by the line and crowd. I highly recommend both but personally I think Fox Bros had more my style of ribs."}, {"review_id": "Dnwpvd7sDR4Q5HpvH6xR9Q", "user_id": "s-sL4B_tlE62PaJcSqOU3w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Fat Matts is a barbque pace.

There are posters and Relics of jazz music and musicians old faded BBQ signs that line the walls. It is a quintessential hole in the wall BBQ joint.The food: I have the combo that features a quarter slab of ribs and a quarter of chicken both of which are doused in a sweet Tangy in a little spicy sauce.

If you time it right, you can avoid the lines. Just not completely sure how to do it. I've driven by and seen lines out the door and wrapped along the side of the building. Today was our lucky day because the line was nonexistent upon arrival. Although shortly after we arrived and our food served to our table, the line started.Good news is that service is fast and comes with good old southern hospital. There's a choice of 3 meats: pulled pork, 1/4 or 1/2 chicken, and slab of ribs. Since I don't eat much pork, I opted for 1/4 chicken, rum baked beans, and macaroni & cheese. Collards are prepared with pork so just avoid if you aren't a pork eater. Chicken extremely tender and juicy. Hints of lemon in the barbecue sauce served on the side offer a new twist to a hearty sauce. I was pleased that the beans did not contain pork, but they were a tad bit sweet and have a nice kick. Creamy mac & cheese, not the best but it complemented the meal well. To drink, I mixed my own Arnold Palmer (tea & lemonade), which was tasty. Limited coke products but sweet tea & lemonade go well with bbq. There's a stage for live music. That's got to be a nice touch. Will definitely have to catch a show."}, {"review_id": "eQmKvhsjRpSn3DVn6Qi1Pg", "user_id": "U05OmaWvCWgKLE1pMTUdIQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Best ribs and bbq sauce in Atlanta.

Ribs, sauce, both are unique, alone or together. And the nice thing is, you can enjoy them either way! Yep, when you order ribs at Fat Matt's, you're getting a distinct rib flavor (alone if you want), or a distinct rib flavor with a sweet, but spicy, sauce that's not quite like one you've had before. Here it is:FACTORS: Food, Price, Service, Location/Parking, Accessibility/Atmosphere/Decor.FOOD: I had the Rib Sandwich with a side of rum baked beans and collared greens. Rib Sandwich: as mentioned, the ribs are fantastic. I'm not big on the idea of a rib sandwich, though, because it's incredibly difficult to actual eat it as a sandwich (you know, due to the massive rib bones that run through the meat). But I know it's \"a thing\" so I digress. Anyways, at the very least I would have hoped that the bread would have been something a little more special. From what I could see and taste, it was your run of the mill white bread that hurt the aesthetics of these nationally acclaimed ribs. So I just took the bread away. The RIBS themselves were absolutely amazing. They were quite close to falling of the bone, and on the outside they were slightly charred which added a sharp Smokey flavor to the meat. The SAUCE - you can add it, or not, you'll enjoy the ribs either way. I added it, and it could be a little too sweet or spicy depending on how much you much you slather on. Rum Baked Beans: I thought these were good, but I didn't feel the \"speciality\" that they were supposed to bring. They weren't too far off from a can of Bush's sweet baked beans from Kroger it seemed. Maybe it was just my batch that felt that way, or something is wrong with my tastebuds (just kidding! You can trust my reviews ;P).Collared Greens: Now, I actually dislike collared greens in general, so it wasn't a great idea for me to order them. As I expected, I didn't enjoy them, and kind of had to force myself to eat them. HOWEVER, as far as collared greens go, I disliked these the least -- so that must mean they're good for you collared-green lovers out there. Ultimately, if you don't like collared greens, don't expect these to change the way you thought about them. PRICE: The prices here are on par with the going rate for the top BBQ joints in Atlanta, but there is a massive price differential between the rib sandwich (the cheapest) and the actual racks of ribs. You're almost forced to get the rib sandwich if you have to stick to a budget when eating out, which I thought was a bummer. I got the rib sandwich because of this price differential, but would have rather had something else. You get what you pay for, I guess. Also, the sides cost a little more than I'd personally value them at--I'd rather have just ordered a 1/4 rack in retrospect. The ribs in the rib sandwich alone though are worth the ~$8 you'll drop on them--at least to try.SERVICE: the service was great -- the girl who took our order was super nice, as was the manager. This isn't the type of place where you're waited on, but the staff made their rounds and cleared tables and while they're out on the floor they would frequently ask whether we needed anything. They also know little facts and tidbits about the history of Fat Matt's -- so feel free to inquire - they're more than happy to answer it seems. LOCATION/PARKING: the location is is very busy -- the street is two lanes--so depending on the time of day, it will be tough to get into the parking lot. If you do get into the parking lot, it will be tough to find parking--even at 10:30pm on a weekday I snagged the last spot in the lot at the time. ACCESSIBILITY/ATMOSPHERE/DECOR: The parking lot is leveled well, there are no stairs or obstacles of that sort, and I didn't really identify any real obstacles to entry. The only thing to note is that the restaurant is very small and it may be difficult to maneuver inside, especially if it is busy. The atmosphere is fine -- the only artificial lighting they have are red lights, which I wasn't a fan of. But during the day the massive windows ought to allow a lot of natural light. Decor -- I thought the decor was appropriate -- this is a historic, famous, quasi-hole-in-the-wall kind of rib joint. It's exactly as I imagined it would be, and it was exactly what suits it. OVERALL: I'd highly recommend Fat Matt's as some of the best ribs I've ever had--if you can get in, and aren't glued to a  less than $10 budget, treat yourself here--chances are that you won't regret it!"}, {"review_id": "BiaTIl-4U0hrjbh5ZPdwgg", "user_id": "NlJXVOhbzhHIJFobjTmO9w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "Was not what I expected!

I got the rib sandwich and Mac & cheese with baked beans. The ribs were good but pretty tough. I had to chew like I was chewing steak on some pieces. Also, bread is not Texas toast. Just regular ole sliced bread that breaks so don't expect to eat it like a sandwich. The Mac and cheese was just edible. Tastes like they use jalapeños or something in them, who wants spicy Mac and cheese?! Also, the baked beans were OK but didn't have enough beans. Tasted like I was eating maybe a good bean soup?? It was a bunch of mush in it. They also serve FROZEN dessert. Who wants frozen sweet potato pie? This place just confuses me, seriously. On the other hand, they had GREAT customer service and a nice live show playing on Sunday night. Wish the food was better....try it and tell me if I'm just crazy! If you need an awesome bbq place, try Grand Champion.

The ribs were fall off the bone, melt in your mouth, finger-lickin awesome! I didn't use much of the BBQ sauce on my sandwich just because the ribs were just so good by themselves!
