Large and accommodating dining area, quick and friendly service, fresh and tasty side dishes, excellent entrees. I particularly enjoy the spicy pork bulgogi. Tried the fried yellow croaker fish this most recent time... yum!Maybe my only qualm is that it can get pretty pricey; some dishes are $4-5 more than they should be IMO. Still, the rest of the experience is enough to highly recommend this place."}, {"review_id": "MiCUzKoJqE6XjKu_vmEOkQ", "user_id": "c9-Ty7XIB4p3CSPB9QIHiQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "I've held off writing a review of this place because I'm seriously conflicted.Pros: I love the food. The korean cuisine here is fantastic. Bimbimbop, gimbap, soondoonboon. All of these dishes make my little heart happy and it's amazing.Normally I'd be like there. I'm done. 5 stars. Easy. Normally the service doesn't affect my rating.But Myung Ga, the wait here for a table, for food, is horrendously long, even when there are clearly tables available. The worst I've had it was waiting almost an hour for my food to be ready and all I ordered was jap chae and soondoonboon. It was hard to find a waiter to even get me some barley tea while I waited. It's been like 6 times now that I've been here. Still conflicted. I wish the service was better and the food doesn't quite make it up for me.Bottom line: come here for good korean but don't expect to get it for a while."}, {"review_id": "Aq54Yq8b5ZEfcI8YfFqDTA", "user_id": "jtgNDZye9yWhPzKI3PXzkw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Been to MyungGa for many years, a disappointing visit today.

I believe it's Korean owned because most of the waiters are Korean. Decoration not bad and it's a good size. The food, one of my favorite Korean restaurants in SLC. My favorite is their ramen or kimchi soup with ramen. Short ribs and bbq beef are flavorful and go delicious with their stone cooked rice. I love their sides dishes especially the kimchi and bean sprouts. They also have a dish in a large pot with rice cakes, ramen, eggs meet and multiple other things. Can serve 2. I don't remember what it's called and not sure if it is still available. Other then that I do love their food and go back when I crave Korean food. I have been here more then 5 times. The waiters are nice, but they don't really have a system and all the waiters help each other. It's kind of all over the place and I noticed when they are busy, waiters bring wrong or forget dishes and they don't remember what the person ordered because it was a different waiter that took the order. They forgot one of my dishes and ended bringing a different type. I think assigning specific areas to each waiter would be simpler and easiest."}, {"review_id": "X_-gupvs3FHpNYb_Hh_6zg", "user_id": "cxf09cefsZMVpHNaqtRJXg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "My husband and I went here for dinner before our show at the Maverick. We weren't so sure of this place at first, but were so glad we decided to go here! I ordered 35 which was vegetables, a fried egg, chicken with brown rice in a hot pot. The brown rice was really good and had great texture, the rest of the dish, although not super flavorful was still quite good. My husband ordered #44 which was a clear noodle dish with vegetables and beef. I personally like this dish better than mine. It had really great flavor and was very delicious.

What is it? YouTubers who have made a living eating in front you, purely for your pleasure. So what's the connection? I've probably watched over 1,000 hours of Korean Mukbangs. Which leads me here, Myung Ga.First of all, the service is incredibly fast. I remember walking in with friends, blasted with mouth watering aromas, but was slightly disheartened when I saw how busy it was. All I could think of was, there's no way they're going to sit us on time, get our orders, and get the food to our table fast enough before I started crying from hunger. False, they were INCREDIBLY quick. BUT, not the kind of quick where they sit you down, shut you up, and hope you leave. They were very friendly, very patient, and very helpful with the menu items.Now the best part. Authentic Korean Food, no fusion, no Americanization of flavors, just pure unfiltered asian flavors. I ordered the Beef Bone Soup. Ox Tail stewed in traditional Korean spices, soft, melt in your mouth meat from the Ox Tail itself. And the best part? Marrow, it's been a while since I've sucked on some good marrow and wow did those flavors transport me back into my Grandma's kitchen. Pour the soup over warm white rice and it's heaven.Feeling adventurous, but not too scary? Try the broiled pot of rice cakes in hot sauce. Think of it as an asian version of spaetzle. Let's just say it's delicious asian pasta in a spicy sauce. And the best part? The appetizers, the myriad of flavors from kimchi, pickled potatoes, pickled cucumbers, and pickled sprouts make it the perfect starter to any meal.If you were every curious of what REAL Korean food tastes like and not like the watered down derivatives you taste out there, come to Myung Ga and I guarantee you've visited Korea with your mouth."}, {"review_id": "oyqeaFAp03ouJR0_4gtXcA", "user_id": "u2a9wozQnaJLfFS-jBe7Yw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "BBQ pork and rice in a hot stone was amazing, especially paired with Kimchi and all the other bomb sides.

Korean shaved ice, it sounds interesting, but I've had Taiawanese shaved ice and wondered how it was different. We'll get to that...So on we went to the meal. I ordered some chicken from the BBQ menu, which was a hefty serving and came with rice and a simple side of tofu soup. Oh mama, tofu soup is one of the great foods of this planet. The other folks I was with went full on tofu soup, with all kinds of other spices and meats and things. I had some order envy, but even my small side of the stuff was enough to remind me to order it next time, or every time. They were on top of things for the service--super prompt, and we asked for lots of extra sides over and over and each time they were quick. We were there after the normal lunch hour and it seems some of the service notes they get are in busy times, so I can't say how they handle a crowd. But out group of three was well taken care of.When it came time to clear the dishes, my curiosity pushed me to ask about the bingsu. One thing leads to another, and we find ourselves with two separate orders: strawberry and mango. I need to first describe to you the base of the beast. Bingsu is Korea's take on shaved ice. Whereas Taiwanese shaved ice is more like long ribbons, this variety is almost like long, grated strands of the frozen milk. Imagine a big bowl of shredded wheat strands, all broken up, but still fluffed and totally separate from one another. I was enchanted, as this is the first time I've ah the stuff. Add on top of that a fruit jam/compote, topped with fresh fruit and sweetened condensed milk and you have a straight up riot on your hands. I dig.The play is pretty big, and there seemed to be plenty of parking. But again, YMMV depending on time of day and whether or not anything is happening at the Maverik Center just up the road. I'd come back for the food, but I'll definitely visit again for the dessert."}, {"review_id": "B-_UDn3WA_ln2PPAgfCq4w", "user_id": "ecFnz7p6gta7fmqQ0uhW2w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/12/2017", "text": "I came here on a recommend from a friend who spent a few years in South Korea. It is one of  her favorite spots because she told me they have some great authentic dishes. Some dishes were really great, while others were alright. A lot of my friends got something from the BBQ section. I got a mixture of things in a hot stone pot (#25), which I absolutely loved. My Korean friend got some sort of enhanced tofu soup.Hits- Food, value, atmosphereMisses- customer service and cleanlinessHitsFood- I truly loved my dish. Especially with the hot sauce on the table to add some additional flavor to it. There was a section of black tendrils... They were horrible. Everything else though, was fantastic. The flavors all came together really well. Although, what stole the show was how the pot so was hot, it browned the rice as it sat inside of it. It gave it this beautiful, textured crunch and it was the most beautiful bite. Value- I though about knicking this because what my friends ended up getting, I wasn't that impressed with. The flavor of the meats was really good, however the dish themselves were just rice and meat. It lacked so much variety of flavor. I would have been disappointed had I gotten it.Atmosphere- the place is really cool inside. I love how it's decorated and the feel they had going throughout. I thought it looked great on the inside.MissesCustomer service- Our servers were kind of non-existent throughout the entire night. My meal was brought to the wrong table as well, haha.  They were a bit busy, so I imagine they had to of been short staffed. They probably were doing the best with what they had.Cleanliness- Our table was initially clean, so thank you for that. However, I noticed throughout the night that 80 percent of the tables were not bussed. Literally, every table I walked by had their dishes remaining. It was a turn off but I worked in the food industry and I know how it can be. I'd like to come back on another night and see if I see the same things repeat."}, {"review_id": "NRz-WVSEo2-rigMoVskUQA", "user_id": "SMLRZRPR9eJy1djCdni-rA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "Thank you yeppers!
