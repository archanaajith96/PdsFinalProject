Great on draft beer selections and an extensive beer fridge with beers from all over the world. Beer cheese soup is legendary from here and pairs really well with almost all beers and works as a perfect dip for sandwiches if you are okay with mixing your foods.Basically Bier Stein is an institution of Eugene food and beer."}, {"review_id": "hjS8uhkox9fBKnhqlrptCw", "user_id": "2M2GdA9HzcXI5cqECZDqgg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Great place for beer, wine, and food! They have plenty to pick from on tap or in a bottle. You can open a tab and order online from your table or order at the register. There's plenty of seating and a pool table if you're interested. Service is decent, some had not such a great attitude and when you're holding a plate of food from someone at the opposite end of the table walk around the damn table! Don't reach across the four people between you and them with a hot plate of food, that's just rude. Parking is easy, there are a few lots around the restaurant to choose from. It's a good place to hang out with a good size group of friends. Children are welcome. They will card you, especially if you've opened a tab and are ordering from your table, so don't get any funny ideas."}, {"review_id": "8WA4jw_-JdyTSkLiIH_G_w", "user_id": "ZhmgoJ5CT_u-riTppuEPYA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/7/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Beer selection still pretty good, even if some of the prices continue to inflate (even taking into account veritable lack of direct competition).  However $12.25 for a very average sandwich???  No freaking way.  I had trouble paying 10.95 for the same thing less than a year ago.  Similar spots in Portland and San Francisco are much more reasonably priced.If a worthy competitor shows up, things will get very interesting."}, {"review_id": "0uCzcIdvuRnxzg3mW6MnkQ", "user_id": "G46sGNCVURsZ8NAiWQH2Dg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "The place to go in Eugene when you want a huge beer selection and friendly wait staff."}, {"review_id": "gzmu4YWfZSNl6KDHK_a8QA", "user_id": "88MxEBxpc-KahHi9edHW_g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "My love for Bier Stein is great. When I moved to town, I didn't really know people and hung out there with the intention of drinking every beer there (over the course of a few years and all...). The tenders there are legit and know their stuff! It became my \"Cheers\" type of place where people eventually recognized the name on the credit card. Cool people that aren't pretentious. My favs were Brian and Sydney (y or i on either I'm not sure) Everyone there is great and friendly! I haven't been in about a year for health reasons but I sure have missed it. The food is not always amazing but it's trying. The beer selection is amazing. A table outside on a sunny day with a book is pretty much the best. Table ordering by txt is also the jam. Go there and spend all your money on Duchess De Bourgogne and Rodenbach Grand Cru along with whatever on tap."}, {"review_id": "7cUn98j7dPbuGPEmnsT-bw", "user_id": "BbVTv7HwwR6HumYUdqalHQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "This may be the most comprehensive beer selection in town! It's actually difficult to order because there are so many options. They have the beers they carry on tap PLUS an entire wall of refrigerators with bottled beer from all over Oregon and other places. You can order bottles to drink in the bar or you can take them home! Very cool. They also have pretty yummy food. I recommend the clam chowder or other soups in the winter months. Plenty of bike parking out front, but don't leave anything valuable (including lights) on your bike because they will get stolen. Love this place. Great for both groups and for individuals! Very friendly staff, great service, and casual atmosphere! Highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "Nz8txOi1PqZ_RmASJBBTfg", "user_id": "GvgFazc7AVO41ht6UnNcmQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "SO MANY OPTIONS!!! This place is so cool. Its a good little pub/eatery. There is a wall lined with refrigerators full of beers. You can either pick from the fridge or they have a decent draft selection as well. The food was also delicious. They have a good selections of sandwiches, burgers, salads, etc. We got a grilled turkey club that was more along the lines of a panini. I got the beef/pork sliders and they were very delicious but it only came with 2. Could have definitely eaten 3 easily. Prices were fair and the service was great. You order at a counter and they bring your food to you however, if you want another beer you must go back up to the counter. So its not like a sit down kinda place. We went on a Sunday night and it was pretty busy but we were able to self seat ourselves right away still. We will be back!"}, {"review_id": "BOI7iUMwdPD3r6IGSHUoMA", "user_id": "aD2xjv4jPNZit2aKKshvRg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "The food is always good! My German-American husband finds this the closest to his time in Germany since moving to Oregon. Also saying that the schnitzel and spaetzal is just like his Oma use to make. You can get unique international beers and ciders on tap or enjoy one of their large variety in the bottle.

My hubby and I went here for lunch. We brought our five month old as they are kid friendly til 9ish. Parking in their lot is a breeze. They have lots of parking spots available (thank you!). Inside, it is quite spacious. There are a lot of tables to choose from including some with benches-- which is our preferred seating. It's a seat yourself establishment with ordering at the bar. After your initial order at the bar and start a tab, you can actually order the rest of your food/drinks for your visit via your cellphone. I love that idea-- not having to stand in line for your next beverage-- what's better than that?! We loved the large variety of drinks. The wall of bottles is amazing!  There is truly something there for everyone to drink. To eat, I had The Dip, fries, and a cup of bier cheese soup. My hubby had the pork loin sandwich and a salad. We both enjoyed our sandwiches. They were good portions and delicious. I have found over the years that I am picky about beer cheese soup but I absolutely loved theirs! It wasn't watered down and you could taste the beer in it. (Sounds simple, I know, but not a lot of restaurants get it right). I can't wait to come back to this establishment and try new items off the menu. I don't think I will be disappointed!"}, {"review_id": "4wmeH6UYIA0l4gz2W-p5_g", "user_id": "rD5KItUqczUGdz4qw5Odaw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "I sat at the bar, ordered a beer and some dinner.

You can either stand in line or sit at bar for a more personal service...Tip: try 1/2 sandwiches before full plate, or share - their food is soo yummy good~ we are definitely going back! We left so full! Not a fan of the fries, but the soup was delicious and the salads that others had, looked great. I have 4 stars due to... Excellent service, however you had to chase them down. To get more beer, more water, your ticket. We sat at the bar, which thought that would be easier service, but you still had to yell or chase. When you had them though, great service!I really appreciated that they support local business and promoted them. The hot sauces were excellent. They should figure out the service piece a little bit in terms of all customers, spread out a little more vs concentrated in sections. Great ambience and vibe.. fun music, peeps dancing down the isles.

Every time I come back to Eugene (or am within a 2 hour drive), this is my first stop. Every time I have friends from out of town, I bring them here and almost all of them ask to come back before we leave. My usual go-to is a spitfire with fries and an ale I haven't tried before (which they always have).The main problem with the place is that it is so popular and frequently swamped. This means that if you want a quiet, relaxing meal with your family, this is not the best place.
