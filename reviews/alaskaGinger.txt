I think it's pan seared and glazed (texture is like bread).Soooo good. Cocktails always taste good.

We hadn't been here in a while and I'm wondering if they made some changes.We started with drinks recommended by the waitress, they were fine but my husband wished he had stuck with something he knew he would like. We also ordered spring rolls & chicken skewers which were good.I got the vegan curry, I usually love it but this did not have much taste and I actually added salt and pepper which I have never had to do.My husband got the beef curry and our friend got the duck. Both seemed to enjoy their dishes.The waitress was a little pushy and even though it was obvious we were chatting and catching up, she would awkwardly stand by the table waiting for us. I felt a little rushed and would have loved dessert but we were ready to leave by then.Will definitely give this place another chance, since we have normally liked it."}, {"review_id": "idNUEGVEXTZZZYY-ZIgeQQ", "user_id": "BcmkvSG-k6O9PXTIyWtKGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "Great place.  The food was amazing.  I went during happy hours and of course, majority of the happy hour foods contained meat.  But the bartender offered to replace the meat with tofu.  Can't say no to that.  I had the taco (soft shell) and the soba both vegetarian.  To top it off, the ginger mojito was only 5 bucks."}, {"review_id": "hKuEbN7OEFpIUsNFq0dU5w", "user_id": "p1V7aW3z5mk4jmLXF9fZ1Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/1/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I should have stuck with my standby and ordered the Mee Krob but settled on the buttermilk fried chicken.

I suggest calling ahead for reservations on weekends. We came late so did not have to worry about this, but I imagine that they fill up quickly. The drink menu was extensive and we tried quite a few cocktails. They were interesting and unique with amazing flavor. As an appetizer we tried the sweet and spicy crispy pork egg rolls which were awesome. I loved the dipping sauce which was loaded with fresh delicious cilantro! Our entrees were killer! My husband and I shared the duck breast and pepper crusted new york sirloin. They were equally delicious. I would come back and get the same thing again, we were very happy with our meals. Our server Cat was awesome as well. She gave great suggestions, checked on us often, and made sure we had a memorable experience.

We also ordered the spicy edamame and my daughter ordered a burger and fries.  The edamame arrived first and was slightly spicy but did not have a single grain of salt sprinkled on it, still, not too bad. My daughter requested no onions on her burger, but it came out loaded with onions. She just took them off, but if it would have been an allergy related request, that would not have worked. I was pleasantly surprised when the vegan curry was delivered because the presentation was beautiful, then...I took a bite. To call it bland would be an understatement. They don't have salt and pepper on the tables but will bring a set of mini shakers out when requested. Even adding a lot of salt and pepper could not save this dish. I never knew that a \"curry\" could actually be that bland. The ingredients seemed fresh and the one small scoop of rice was cooked well but a second scoop of rice definitely should have been added for the amount of curry. On a positive note, the service was fast and the server was very nice. Maybe it was a bad day for the chef on duty, I'll probably try it once more since it's close to where I stay when I'm in town. Hopefully I'll be able to update this review    to a higher rating then."}, {"review_id": "1vYRb_Y6Bfu1BrXsTFz23g", "user_id": "DO2GQwekspCf8RZIcVCRIQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "We had a wonderful meal.

My most recent favorites are the chicken lettuce cup appetizer, sesame-ginger Caesar, mango teriyaki tofu and mee krob. While the chicken appetizer is small, it satisfies any craving with well seasoned ground chicken and a delicious curry sauce. It's low carb as well with lettuce cups instead of a starch-y wrap! The dressing on the Caesar is what makes this rather boring salad full of flavor with a unique twist. I love the mango teriyaki sauce, it is fantastic! My only complaint is there were hardly any vegetables. It was mostly noodles, which were tasty but overwhelmed the plate. I love the mee krob because it has pad Thai noodles, a variety of meat and a wonderful sauce. It's a dish that satisfies any taste. The honey BBQ ribs were a little disappointing, while the flavors on their own were fantastic, it was overwhelming with all of them put together. The beans had way too much garlic and oil on them as well. One thing that bothers me about Ginger is they do not give you many vegetables. If there are vegetables they're usually finely sliced and not abundant. I wish they would give me some more veggies and less carbs! Service is always attentive and friendly."}, {"review_id": "jaxk2wqVcn8_HHW67rXyLQ", "user_id": "JQ6Q6E6jPzfeu6XjAKHO_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "(A very rare 5-star review here)I'm reviewing the cocktails.  I had drinks at Ginger from two different bartenders over a couple of nights.  The house drinks are spectacular.  Like, really good.  And the balance and execution is always perfect.  I am a big cocktail geek and was really surprised to see a place in Anchorage that really has their sh*t together here.  (I'm from Seattle; we have about a zillion craft cocktail bars at this point.)

Wish I had a bowl of rice to slather it on top of but nonetheless it was good.As for the green tea creme brûlée it was really nothing special at all. The custard didn't have much flavor whatsoever and the top crust needed to be harder as some areas were flimsy sadly.

Located in Anchorage downtown, this cozy restaurant creates a good vibe and good quality food. They also have a pretty generous vegetarian menu, and the vegan curry is a must. But the downside being, every dish is overpriced and the quantity is not appreciable either. Since we came here for an early dinner, we weren't very hungry.So my husband and I decided to share an entree. The waiter seemed to have been taken aback due to the fact that we ordered just one entree. I am not sure if ordering more than required is the norm or ordering just enough is frowned upon in fine dining. Anyway we ended the dinner with a delicious Ginger pear cheesecake and I had no idea until then that ginger could be such an excellent ingredient in desserts!"}, {"review_id": "3H2fTxKQes6jUTlp1C_Vxw", "user_id": "CzAQw3BTHWYhSNboBOkVnA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/27/2017", "text": "Ok service although with not only our table but with other tables as well (eventhough only a max of 1/2 the tables had customers) they were constantly rushing in trying to take dishes and glasses away.

I'll get straight to it, Asian Fusion that's in between mediocre and overhyped. I wouldn't say the food was bad but it wasn't that remarkable to say the least. Ordered several items like their pork Belly which is the best (taste wise) but i'd give it 6 stars out of 10 for the texture! It was tender but had this hard shell which is a little weird for my taste. The fat melts in your mouth , lol, doesnt sound appetizing. But that's good cause you can barely taste the fat fromThe belly. We also had chicken skewers with peanut sauce which is so-so and a little bland. Ribeye steak for our entree (tender but bland), korean ribs( mostly  vegetables, what a shame), rockfish with risotto. ImNot sure if it was rockfish or halibut, wasn't all that so that's probably why. Loved their dessert menu specially the matcha brulee. That's the good part , always is. As for our server who was very chatty and engaging. She was nice and all but a little in a hurry to kick us out. She had sait it more than thrice and checked on us 4 more times after dividing the bill. Am i coming back?

Parking is terrible they don't have a parking lot so it's curb parking or pay to park parking lots. I'm guessing inside there is a bar side and a dining side. We were sat in dining area. Service was prompt and attentive. He was also extremely nice for splitting our entree up on two diff plates. We ordered like 3 starters; egg rolls, pork bao buns(bar exclusive), and chicken lettuce wraps. One entree: Thai noodle soup Egg rolls: a little on the oily side but so crunchy on the outside and filled with pork and cabbage on the inside. It came with your typical sweet chili sauce to dip. So delicious. And I think like 4 came in one order. Bao bun: at first it wasn't on the menu so we had to ask our waiter if we could make an order from the bar. Which he was nice enough to do for us. The bun was the best part, it was so soft. It had shredded sweet pork (a little too sweet for me) and some pickled carrots and radish on top which also added to the sweet. Although I felt like the bun helped balance out the sweetness. Lettuce wraps: this starter was great! It was fresh and tasty. On the plate there is the chicken, lettuce, bean sprouts, and a curry dipping sauce. We didn't care too much for the curry sauce cause the meat itself was extremely tasty! Thai noodle soup: the only disappointment of the night. I was really looking forward to this dish. I mean it was our only entree it should've been better. But it wasn't. Everything was so good up until the soup. The soup was bitter and had almost no flavor to its base. It had some big prawns and tender noodles but what makes the dish should be in the soup base. I found it hard to eat because every bite was way too bitter. Like biting into a lime peel. Please don't order this.Last but not least we got the green tea creme brûlée and it was worth everything! It was so good. Big enough to share, not too sweet, and so creamy!"}, {"review_id": "WFNpIQd0QmreqbI7Uh3IzA", "user_id": "uaDqoEtK6wU06MBFuoWLMw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Ginger used to be my favorite downtown option.

I was there two weeks ago with a group of friends from my high school. I had the Farmers Market Omelet. It was packed full of veggies & goat cheese. The goat cheese was a little too sour, so I ended up scrapping part of it off. I also had their homemade ginger ale! That had an interesting  taste to it! I personally didn't care much for it, but someone who loves the taste of ginger would surely find it tasty. They used real ginger with soda water. Didn't like the taste, but it was good for me so I drank it all. What I like most about this place is the upscale lounge atmosphere. It's really calm. Though, the was a table next to ours that was rowdy, but that's not the restaurants fault. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I had something I needed to address with them and they were super attentive and made sure it was taken care of. Tip: Try their Mexican Hot Chocolate alcoholic beverage. My friend let me try hers, and it was pretty good.
