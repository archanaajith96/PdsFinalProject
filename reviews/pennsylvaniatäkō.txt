I'm clearly not alone of that - this tiny restaurant is always booked! A reservation weeks in advance is pretty much always necessary. It's worth the wait though for the creative mixed drinks and equally inventive tacos. Tako serves its Asian-Mexican fusion food in a small, dimly lit space with creative decor and danceable music, making it feel as though you've walked into somewhere secret. If you go to tako and are of age to consume alcohol, I'd say a margarita is a must! The spicy cucumber margarita is fantastically cooling and hot at once. On my most recent visit, I had the coconut margarita - it was a like a margarita and a piña colada had a happy baby. You really can't go wrong, unless you don't order a margarita at all.As far as food, the tacos are a must. I have had the non-meat taco flavors. I used to love their mushroom taco with huitlacoche but the mushroom taco has since changed so on my most recent visit I opted for the shishito taco which was quite tasty and they managed to squeeze a lot of peppers into two tacos. Side note: the flour tortillas are not vegetarian but the corn tortillas are. My friends and family have also said positive things about the other flavors of tacos. The chorizo taco has been praised for being rich but it has been noted to not be very spicy. And the tako (Japanese for octopus) taco is noticeably octopus tentacle so you have to decide for yourself if that's fun or intimidating."}, {"review_id": "QU-sXQEC6W6LCsChehFIhg", "user_id": "haT-IuuJcLbpTuG_tqwn_w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "This was my third or fourth visit to tako, but the only time I've ever been there during prime weekend hours. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Not because of the food or drink, but because of the way I was treated by the staff, and the poor management of indoor bar seats. I walked in by myself at about 8 PM on a Friday night, hoping to get a drink and a taco before meeting up with some others. I knew I had a small chance of getting a table, so I went in with the mindset of being happy to sit at the bar. When I tried to walk in, the hostess stopped me at the door and asked what I was in need of. When I told her, she sharply told me that there was a waitlist to sit at the outdoor bar and that if I wanted to sit at the indoor bar I would \"just have to wait and see.\" They have tables out on the street too but those were not being used. I went to stand and wait at the bar for a seat, and it was clear that MANY people were using the indoor bar as a place to wait for either an outdoor bar seat or an indoor table. This is totally fine if you are ordering drinks, food, etc., but there were several people just sitting there. I ordered a margarita (very good as always) and informed the bartender that I was waiting on a seat just for me should one become available. As I stood and sipped my margarita for over 30 minutes, hordes of people came into the restaurant, and getting a bar seat became a bit like the hunger games. Still, there were people sitting at the bar seemingly not drinking or eating anything. Another bartender noticed my empty glass and asked if I wanted another. I asked for the check and politely told her that I would have to leave because I hadn't been able to get a seat. She said, \"are you sure? one might open up.\" I am not blaming the bartenders, because I know they were overwhelmed and it can't be easy to kick someone out of the bar if they aren't ordering anything. Moral of the story? Don't expect to sit anywhere on a Friday night, even if you come alone. Perhaps one solution to this issue would be to employ a waiting list for the indoor bar, too. It's just a small restaurant and the traffic is difficult to control."}, {"review_id": "qXCmYd6AVz8AEwn5hpXiMA", "user_id": "uPMYfrfY2XCRcQUfeUnBbQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Food: Service: There aren't enough tables to handle the crowds.

The lamb tacos were to die for. Lets start with the meat - succulent, tasty, and juicy as hell. The real kicker is the other ingredients. Perfect in variety, portion, and layering. The crispies inside the taco were DIVINE. Let's finish with the tortilla. So nice, unique, and tasty!The choco taco was delicious as well. A very 'chef'y dessert with dark cherries on bottom. The ceviche was good not great. I'll have to try the guac and more tacos next time.It's very dark and vibey in here. Hipster fancy taDefinitely come here when in Pittsburgh.

The tacos (and salsas) were amazing and the margaritas (I had the pineapple/jalapeno one without the jalapeno) were wonderful. We sat at the bar, since we didn't plan ahead months in advance. The service was great and all the food we saw going by us looked amazing, too. I couldn't decide, since everything looked so good on the menu, so I took the suggestion of our bartender and she definitely steered me in the right direction, though all of us enjoyed our food. The tacos were also a lot bigger than I expected and filled me up more than I thought they would. I can't wait to go back.

The daily specials are very unique and crafted for specialty; tacos, appetizers and libations.The atmosphere is very cool, all customized by the Richard DeSchantz restaurant group. The bike chain chandeliers are so unique you'll never see anything like it anywhere else. The mural on the walls were hand done by a local artist. DJ's play on the weekends and some late nights in the evenings. The outdoor seating during Cooperative weather has a taco bar in front of the kitchen. You can watch the line Cooks make your food right in front of you.The unique artisan Tequila's are from all over and some of the bottles are very rare and collectors love to gawk over them. Good for small groups and date nights. You can be as intimate or as social as you like.I highly recommend getting a few items and sharing.Once finished here, check out their brotherly restaurant Butcher and the Rye."}, {"review_id": "RE1eutYyBWT5X66rcVeHeA", "user_id": "k55-QGGiZwKI0l6mY2w_lQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "So it was Thursday night ...we had our reservation (done right from my trusty yelp app)lined up but due to a situation at my house I called earlier in the day to see if we could change to later gentlemen on the phone was very nice and moved it later.Front is where all the tacos are being madeIt's a glass enclosed kitchen you can watch the chefs at work...it's very coolWe arrived and were warmly greeted and seatedDownstairs It's one long padded bench with high tops for twoThe other side are metal stoolsThe other side is the barWaitress was friendly and perky we had water instantly And drink orders quickly takenGuacamole has it's own menuMade fresh there are all sorts of fixins you can add from blue cheese to sausages Menu had tacos of all sorts including octopus ...octopi seems to be a theme here ...walls are adorned with these sea creaturesThe is a poke bowl We ordered plain ol guac it came with warm not to salty warm chips delish I had salmon tacos Soft little warm tacos a piece of warm salmon with slaw and some eggplant very tasty My dining partner had bbq beef she lovedI have a thing for light bulbs and the upstairs section has lots of cool all different bulbs as the lighting The pros .

Think dimly lit space with a fully stocked bar that runs across the length of the restaurant. It's a bit hidden as they do not have any door sign, but you know you're there when you see the large doormat with letters adorning the restaurant's name. You'll know you're at the right place when you enter and see the glass which reveals the huge open kitchen to your right. The guacamole here is a must. How many places do you go to that let you customize your own guacamole?! There's so many options to choose from such as pineapple, jicama, mango, bacon, crabmeat, smoked salmon - there's really no way that you can wrong!Now on to the tacos. Tako really knows how to make a mean taco. We ordered the following:- Al pastor (pork shoulder) with pineapple, onion, avocado salsa and cilantro- Korean short rib with fermented cucumber, napa cabbage, peanuts and cilantro- Blackened fish with onions, peppers, avocado crema, and cilantro My favorite by far was the korean short ribs taco. The short ribs were perfectly seasoned and the cucumbers helped to cut the grease from the meat. And of course the peanuts added a nice crunch to it. The blackened fish, which was one of the specials of the night, was a close runner up. All tacos come in two per order. One of my faves in Pittsburgh!

I really wanted to love Tako because its former executive chef, Dave Racicot, is one of the most talented chefs I have ever had the pleasure of knowing (I have been eating at his restaurants since he opened Notion in Oakmont), so I expected great things. However, the amount of \"hype\" that surrounds Tako does not reflect the actual food. Yes, the food is good, but it is not worth making a reservation more than two days in advance for, and the prices are not worth the flavor; a $2.50 taco from Las Palmas in Oakland is both tastier and cheaper. So, I'm not saying it's not worth going, but you should not have as high expectations as the reviews would lead you to have."}, {"review_id": "ypmXmoTtQjA5yIUumKosbg", "user_id": "WQnfyig39Xg5ni98ci-VBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "The decor and theme here are done really well.

We sat upstairs and I especially appreciated the huge portrait of Jesus and his disciples behind me and the huger portrait of an octopus to my left.I loved everything that I ate and drank here, and I didn't even get the most popular items.For an appetizer, we had the street corn (sriracha mayo / chili / lime / cotija cheese): With an intensely flavorful and tangy quality, this was probably the best street corn I've ever had.And the poke (yellowfin tuna / spicy soy dressing / sesame mayo / lime / rice crackers) was the most creative take on the dish that I've had. Just the look of the dish is revolutionary. On the left side, you have your standard fresh bites of fish topped with nice creamy bits of sesame-flavored mayonnaise. And on the right? It's a tart, lemony foam. Then, just when you think you have this dish all figured out, you find a hidden bed of silky guacamole at the bottom of the bowl. It's all awesome.I sampled a number of the cocktails, but ordered the lychee and pepper margarita (mezcal / lychee / bauchant orange liquor / pickled thai chilis / lime). This wasn't groundbreaking, but it was very good. A nice balance of heat and sweet lychee.

Highly recommend getting reservations if you can, but I've also been seated outside without a reservation before. Inside the restaurant is octopus themed (tako means octopus in Japanese), very hip, and can be pretty loud. Honestly my description doesn't do the place justice! They serve fusion tacos, appetizers, drinks, etc. I wouldn't go to this place expecting authentic tacos, but it definitely can be an amazing experience if you go in with an open mind. I don't even like octopus and the Tako taco tasted good to me! Another favorite is the Korean style one. Carnitas were good too, but I would recommend trying some of the more out-there tacos if you're here. In terms of appetizers I can recommend the papas bravas and the poke.
