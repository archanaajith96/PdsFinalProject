This place did not disappoint!  It's a different take on the buffet/open kitchen style and all of us said, they need to open this in California!!  I would choose to eat here over chipotle any day. Loved the mango bbq sauce, the chimichurri and the vegetable mix.  Top it off, the staff was super friendly and shared with us the story of the organization. Loved it!"}, {"review_id": "4I2BMcUL2j9TrCIv2inuZg", "user_id": "medpTsVoUT_omCIrr81xbg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Simply amazing. Parking was a bit of a pain and I almost gave up but I am incredibly glad I didn't. Five on Black is a mission style class act Brazilian joint with killer grub. I told the young lady who approached me that it was my first time in and I might need some help picking my mix and she was happy to help. The food was absolutely amazing. I will be back every time I am in town. The cheese rolls were even phenomenal, gluten free, cheesy and chewy in the best way. My only complaint? There are two sizes to choose from, basically small and large. I didn't think the small would fill me up so I got the large thinking I would at least have left overs in the morning and this is where is gets bad... I couldn't stop eating it! I ate the whole thing! Now I'm sitting alone in my hotel room, stuffed beyond belief, looking at my empty take out bowl and I want seconds but I am convinced I would explode and I still have to go back tomorrow before I leave town because Five on Black makes for utter lack of self control. Worth it.."}, {"review_id": "2KC7UPco4CvkPESwLun5Tg", "user_id": "iRJ9r8fXduur7-f-tziaaA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "This place has good flavor but their portions just keep getting smaller.   Bought the large bowl today at lunch.  And they underfilled it by 1.5 inches from the rim.   Not with the 9 bucks I paid."}, {"review_id": "weVJTVVyNziPm6cAiBXgoA", "user_id": "OWda9t1OFCreoahKoOs0FA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "We eat here at least a few times a week, it's always been one of my favs and will always be!

I recently moved to Missoula from the San Francisco Bay Area and was pleasantly surprised to have Brazilian food here. It is difficult to find Brazilian food in the SF Bay Area! The spicy coconut sauce is tasty and actually pretty spicy. The rice, greens, sweet potatoes, tilapia and lime with the spicy coconut sauce is an amazing meal. Service is excellent. They donate to a lot of non-profits and causes in Missoula. The Five on Black in downtown Missoula serves beer, so that is a plus! I highly recommend Five on Black."}, {"review_id": "BXCERUX9TmZx2zaDJO-2Ww", "user_id": "IlEjAx13QjEpJqw1L5aGaQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "This place ranked high in Yelp, so here we are. We tried the Brazilian option called feijoada, which is a stew. The spicy chimichurri sauce adds great flavor. The bowl is a bit of a mush-mash, but the flavors are good. The regular-size bowl is more than adequate. This place offers a nice change, but not enough appeal to frequent.

It's 'a la' chipotle in that you can order a bowl at the counter and add on ingredients as you go. The farofa (toasted casava flour) is the one ingredient you should add if you want your bowl to stand out with a Brazilian touch. As others have indicated, with build your own bowl you can easily build a gluten free or vegan bowl. It's perfectly located in Missoula to have that Univ. of Montana vibe and prices are decent enough to attract the college crowd. The one must, the bread (pao de queijo) order extras!"}, {"review_id": "g7nWvm1fM1OurXDCLtxv8A", "user_id": "jDZUnT7VeUMnqat19xrTvw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/29/2017", "text": "Not really sure what's Brazilian about this food, but it was decently tasty. Nothing really stood out to me, but it was something new to try. It was a little too saucy for me, so maybe ask for the sauce to be on the side since it can overpower the entire meal. Plus, I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce selection, but that's probably because of my own personal taste. I really liked the whole feel of the place. It was good and it looks really good in photos, but it doesn't taste like 5 star amazing as yelpers claimed."}, {"review_id": "c1l-ZuE5ZESSygFVHmSRPw", "user_id": "eHYKTfCcfHANJlxSs5q2xw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "Legit my new favorite place!!!

I didn't​ realize that Brazilian food had Curry but they do! I got the Tilapia with Spicy Coconut Sauce which is basically a yellow curry, Collards, Coconut Roasted Sweet Potatoes and the Chunky Tomato Vinaigrette, Spicy Chimichurri, and Cilantro. And of course Pao de Qeijo, a wonderful wheat free cheese bread. This is gluten free heaven. The only thing I would change is to have a rice- free option for the base that isn't crisp greens. Rice is good, but we don't digest rice so well. Yes we are in the anti-gluten free class. There is such a thing :-) Maybe have the greens sauteed? Or a combo of sauteed greens, black beans, and sweet potatoes? Or just black beans. I'm sure that would cost more. But we would appreciate the option."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-on-black-missoula?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
