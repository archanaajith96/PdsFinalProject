I had the burger with no bun and a side of brussels sprouts which was pretty darn tasty.  If I am in the area, or even just driving through, I would make this stop again."}, {"review_id": "tId5DpBWvOqBAARkcX5T9w", "user_id": "uryrJWzxLy_n20nV7C4rYQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "I loved the whole energy here. Our waiter was so upbeat and helpful! The only down side I could say is the seating situation. They have you seat yourself but a place that is packed like this needs some direction.

The ingredients are super fresh, the beef is juicy, and the service is wonderful. I must say that my meal was that of perfection. I had the \"Q\"; never had bbq sauce like that. It was rich and tangy, while the slaw and pickles gave it a nice crunch. I asked for medium-well and got it. I didn't try the beer, but would definitely go back to do so.

We both had the cheese and bacon burger and all but licked the plate, so to speak. We shared a medium order of fries. They were great . I also ordered the Brussels which were an original treatment that may change your opinion about Brussels sprouts. The waiter did forget to get mushrooms on my burger which would normally cost a star but he apologized and gave us a little off so no harm no foul. The burger was that good. The beer selection was good too although there were fewer than 41 choices. No problem as far as I am concerned since I found 2 brews I enjoyed.  Definitely a good place."}, {"review_id": "X-l6cZ4QWNskd6vyQ0RN6g", "user_id": "Q3aDB0gqeFA8XtK329tv9g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "The Brussels Sprouts are a must as is the duck fat fries!
