Just as in a similar review don't let the Luxe Inn dive motel it's in turn you off because this Hibachi sushi restaurant , I have to say is a PEARL in Gulfport, MS oyster!!!We sat  at the sushi bar but there is a regular bar too and hibachi station for non-sushi eaters. Our server Wang W was so fun and friendly he steered us in the right direction off an incredibly extensive menu ! Service and sushi were top quality, loved it! The sushi chefs were very proud of their creations! I will tell all my Pensacola sushi lovers about it! Wish it was in our town!! Order the Gulfport roll or and the Koi roll,  it is beautifully executed and superbly delicious! We shared a dinner entree Sashimi plate even the dressing on the house salad was so full of flavor I wanted to take a pint home! Don't miss this incredible restaurant!"}, {"review_id": "WT2S4P_o8-xCMQwOENQoig", "user_id": "9Ojmt0CYcKnrCQAK7csIfg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "This is such a good place to grab some sushi! We were seated immediately, our waiter was really nice, we started out with the Baked salmon appetizer and it was super delicious! Next we ordered the Biloxi roll and Combination  yaki udon noodles..We don't live in biloxi but we will definitely will be back for more sushi from this restaurant! It's a must to check out if you're in the Biloxi area, because you  won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "ixqlevJO7Rg9eYM8-JXwKw", "user_id": "whANnraKzW0EApWQmSS4QQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "If I'm Gulfport MS go here for a sushi hibachi fix.  Everything was good.  Great portions.  Scallops great, roll great, miso great and for the low low.  They have a lot of unique sushi rolls."}, {"review_id": "qSrqjr_UK8myCaMbLDN-zg", "user_id": "EWzMOoCiq9rzaUm5qBJOQQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/11/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Let me just start by saying, we love the sushi from Koi! We make it a point to dine at Koi when the sudden onset of sushi fever hits us hard and let me tell you, we are never disappointed. The quality and freshness of the menu is unparalleled, the service is always spot on and the atmosphere is not bad at all considering the restaurant itself is attached to the Ramada. That is my only complaint actually. In order to wash your hands or use the bathroom, you must go through the hotel lobby. Not that big of a deal to me really but just a slight inconvenience. Other than that, I can think of no other way Koi can improve, especially in comparison to the other sushi restaurants here on the MS Gulf Coast. Koi also has your typical Hibachi Bar offerings for those who seek a more entertaining lunch or dinner. Enjoy!!! My go to rolls are: Hot Summer Special, Roll Tide, Miami heat, The HulkEgg drop soup and squid steak for appetizers!"}, {"review_id": "etQluDIIKrPM1MQouK5XWA", "user_id": "iCNEJGXm2YaWtpUfv6MC_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/23/2017", "text": "This is my go-to place for sushi (when I feel like making the 20 min drive from my house lol).

I wish I got the girls name who served me, but she was amazing (everyone else who came by my table was very nice as well). Her suggestion for a tuna lover like myself was the Roll Tide roll, amazing. One other thing I should say, seeing a sushi spot connected to a hotel may be a little offsetting but don't let that turn you away, well worth the try! Oh and the spicy edamame were great as well"}, {"review_id": "M0JNnX0zbgiNAO010f3Fgg", "user_id": "NM_qkPizF2BYxBmEOLep_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/26/2016", "text": "It's been awhile since I've been back but I have been coming for the past two weeks with my children. Atmosphere is very quite calm besides the hibachi area and the decor is very modern.Service is pretty up to par & the menu is extensive. For appetizers I really enjoy the calamari, baked lobster, gyoza and egg drop soup.Special rolls I normally get the hulk, koi, nemo. The fried rice is too die for! A must when you dine  in! I can't say anything negative about this place! The best so far on the gulf coast!"}, {"review_id": "dKtzj8yerCj61K7nFpc3Tw", "user_id": "0NZLdG_w3OWW0QsbnuHUqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2017", "text": "My coworkers and I came early on a Friday evening and were seated promptly and served our freshly prepared sushi quickly. Service was top notch - friendly - accurate, and very willing to accommodate our requests. Parking was easy and the ambiance was fairly typical for a sushi joint.

Tonight was a complete disappointment comparatively speaking.When I go for sushi, the spider roll is a staple. I can really get a feel for the place with this roll. Unfortunately it was grainy and bland this time. The Koi's roll wasn't bad but not great. The third roll was so unremarkable that i don't even remember the name. My wife got pad Thai and I have her a piece of each. She tried the spider roll and literally spit it into a napkin.The service was good from the waitresses but this is probably the first time I've been to a sushi bar and not at least greeted by the sushi chefs. We didn't hear from them until we were leaving even though they were only 2 ft from us at any given time. Really just a disappointing experience and for $50+ i could've eaten McDonald's 4 times."}, {"review_id": "yYMMJPHzh2WYJ6h1_30TPA", "user_id": "AkhvfUoi_3q9aixcLifeyw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/27/2017", "text": "It was very good.

My wife and i went for lunch and the service was excellent. I ordered two rolls (snow crab roll and  egg drop soup and my wife ordered the sweet and sour chicken bento box. We also ordered a vegetable tempura for an appetizer. The tempura was great and the egg drop soup was okay. The rolls left much to be desired. Both of the rolls were really small but edible. My wife's bento box was full of food of different variety and was pretty tasty with fried rice and fried chicken. Her bento came with a small 4 piece roll that was edible as well. All and all it could of been a lot better when it came to the quality of the food.

But the eggdrop soup was the bomb.com!!  I was here on business and needed to eat, so a friend of mine recommended Koi. I didn't look at the reviews, but decided she was probably right if she said it was good. She was wrong, it was fabulous!I walked in hungry, and I had been to work so I had on a Spanx. TMI, but on my walk to the bathroom in the hotel I decided the carpet wasn't really clean in the hotel, so I wasn't going to like the food. However, once I removed the offending Spanx I realized I was just being squeezed silly and I didn't really mean it. And THEN, when I was seated, one of the seats was ripped. And if you've read past reviews, you know I despise ripped seats with a passion. Despise.them.with.a.passion. But, the food. I wanted a fried crabstick, but the waitress quickly warned me that it was made with imitation crab. Score one for her, because I would have been pissed, especially since my seat was ripped. She recommended the eggdrop soup, which was phenomenal! Then, she recommended the top three sushi rolls, so we just told her to bring us all of them. The were fresh, hot (the fried ones), beautiful, and crazy tasty.  The food was so good that I even ordered dessert, which turned out to be excellent as well. I will definitely come back here. Like, maybe even tomorrow."}, {"review_id": "Traci9FZkM27MLJSWGhopA", "user_id": "wCTbrMT0qXqg5ZjkRpQ3YA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2017", "text": "BEST SUSHI EVER!! Love the atmosphere.
