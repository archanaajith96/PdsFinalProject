I took a leap of faith and cameTo sweet P's anyways and was elated that I did. Maybe I am a bit biased since this was immediately after Central BBQ but boy oh boy, this was one of the best BBQ I've had.I was hesitant to get the dry rub since my last experience, it was so dry. I had to do it though, I refuse to believe all dry rub ribs in Tennessee tasted like tree barks. I was very happy with my choice. My half rack dry rub was amazing. The dry seasoning sprinkled on top had a crunchy sweetness to it, like crushed candy for meat! The ribs themselves were so juicy and moist. The meat simply fell off the bone, the crust was not hard at all and packed a lot of smoked flavor.I also had a brisket plate that came with a side of mac and cheese and tater salad. The mac and cheese was good, nothing extravagant but a great pair for the BBQ. The tater salad had eggs and onion that added a fresh break for the heavy BBQ. Their brisket was fatty and moist and seasoned just right, although I wish it was a bit softer, some bites were still chewy.The atmosphere was also great, you could dine inside or out in the patio, iced cold water was free. Sitting by the window you can overlook an industrial train track that was distinctly Tennessee. Overall, I'd give the place a 4.5 but since I had to compare it to places like Central BBQ, I'd give it a solid 5 stars."}, {"review_id": "r41GW0_Y7dLWltz_e_fRjQ", "user_id": "3Wwhr6O3MmUiZfDzBWEagw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "I have always loved this place, but decided my last visit warranted a new review.  While I didn't see me go to side the green beans (which would normally be enough for me to boycott a place or at least issue a public thrashing), the replacement seems to be Lima Beans made I the Characteristic seasoned and mixed ingredient style that makes Sweet P's sides the best.  As a bonus, they made brisket chili which I also had as a side.  They decided to add the chili today because of the cold weather.

Highly recommend the wings with the dry rub and the mac n cheese. When my daughter asked if the chess pie had nuts, the staff responded 'we don't know' which I find an unacceptable answer and lazy.

Joking of course.....I must say these guys got the right ingredients when it comes to BBQ, greens, and Mac n cheese.I had Brisket and I asked for it wet! I was waiting on them to ask what that meant but they already knew.  Now I will say they served  my wife some cold Brisket, not on purpose and they quickly correct it. I wasn't a fan of the potato salad. I am a country boy and to me potato salad is supposed to be sweet.Overall they had good food and a the service was good as well."}, {"review_id": "hTjboaE2LIST0WKXZ-n4Cg", "user_id": "sBVykNTQ7qApAW0fslQW8Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Good portions, great sauces.

Decided to come here last minute with a Tinder date from philly. We ordered the sampler around 8pm, 1 hour before closing, so our options were extremely limited. We ended up with pulled pork, brisket, spicy wings, banana pudding, beans and greens. The pork and brisket were dry but the wings were fabulous. I understand why people are crazy about wings now. It was so flavorful and moist! Who goes with wings on a first date? Someone who cares more about food than making a mess while eating. Besides, it's something to laugh about right? The greens and beans were edible. Nothing fancy to mention. As for the banana pudding, it was way better than I expected. It wasn't OD sweet. It had the perfect balance of sweet, creamy and flavorful. I must give them props for their banana pudding. Overall, service is like fast food since it's premade. Do not go near closing because your options will be very limited!"}, {"review_id": "jZnztgL42QRRw4RU7ywcWg", "user_id": "Vl7xrvx0sSD4yOdEeFrS6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "Dive is a good word to describe this place but it's the kinda dive you'll actually want to eat at!It's a cafeteria style restaurant with a small bar.

We wanted to find a good local spot in Knoxville while we were driving north. So we went to Yelp and we found Sweet P's. When we came in I was slightly confused because I don't think any reviews stated that this restaurant is cafeteria style. So we stood staring at the large chalkboard menu above the ordering location. After a couple of moments my boyfriend decided to go with the beef brisket, the green beans, macaroni and cheese, and a side of banana pudding for desert. I ordered the grilled chicken, the greens and things, and macaroni and cheese. The cooks took our order and placed everything on a plate and cafeteria tray. After we headed to the register to check out. The inside of the restaurant was gorgeous it had plenty of pictures with the history of Knoxville including information about the world fair. Another interesting  thing about this restaurant is there are two gender-neutral bathrooms on the first floor. After we chose our seats we began eating. I first tasted the pulled chicken without any of the barbecue sauces that were on the table (Thick barbecue sauce and Thin barbecue cause). The pulled chicken was very dry even with the light dusting of seasoning on top. My boyfriend agreed that his BBQ was dry as well. So I decided to taste the thick and thin barbecue sauce. Both sauces were really great! I would actually purchase them, but that didn't change the fact that I was disappointed that a barbecue place had under seasoned BBQ. The Greens and Things were under seasoned as well and my favorite portion of the meal with macaroni and cheese. For a barbecue place the food wasn't the focal point on this visit for us. Therefore I believe that most consumers are coming for the atmosphere versus the food because everything was pretty pretty bland. To end our meal we decided to taste test the banana pudding. The banana pudding was enjoyable. However there was nothing really special about the recipe.Overall this restaurant deserves a C-. There are gender neutral restrooms, the dinning area and inside of the restaurant is gorgeous, this place seems like a great hangout during the warmer months, the macaroni and cheese was good, and the thick and thin BBQ sauces were great. Pitfalls, the BBQ needs some help. Most of the dishes are bland and need extra sauce or seasoning."}, {"review_id": "H7zJ7QuKamjHcAW2iJuUSQ", "user_id": "6-2uPAsh7sOKAmQMFYrFPg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I will admit, the price is somewhat high, but this food really takes you to a backyard barbecue.

Pinto beans were really tasty and a nice part from the usual sweet baked beans. The green beans were made from fresh green beans which I really love. The collards really didn't have much flavor and really disappointed me.  In my opinion, Sweet P's Soul House is better, but Sweet P's has some of the best BBQ in the Knox area"}, {"review_id": "As65ksWsXMAjVmxemDoYTA", "user_id": "UGGpN4-q_4cf3SZ3mBJdbg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "I ordered the Meatloaf sandwich with Mac n cheese.

This is probably a top 5 bbq place joint I've tried. My co-worker and I tried this place yesterday evening, being our last night in Knoxville, before flying out this afternoon. We came here due to the high ratings on Yelp.It's definitely got a dive-type feel, as the restaurant is sitting by itself off a one-way road, and the food ordering process is cafeteria-style. you order first at the counter and take your food on a tray to your table.To try everything, my co-worker I was traveling with and I ordered the sampler platter with 2 orders of mac and cheese and green beans. We each ordered a chocolate chess pie and ordered one brisket burrito, just in case the other food wasn't enough. It was...Mac and cheese - awesome. Ribs - amazing. Pulled pork sandwich - dang good. I used the thick bbq sauce on the pulled pork sandwich...the sauce was so good, I wish they bottled it and offered to sell it. I would've taken a full case home. It had just enough kick and the tangy flavor was perfect to me. We both had a big lunch, so by the time we got to our pies and the burrito, which was attempted at last...it was a done deal. I took my slice of pie back to the hotel to eat later in the evening. I eventually got to it, and it was good. The burrito we didn't finish. The brisket inside was good, but we ordered it without slaw inside....and they prepared and gave it to us with slaw inside. We didn't make a deal out of it because we were so full anyway by the time we got to it...we each ate only about 5% of it.Great, casual dining experience. Staff was nice and helpful directing us to the sampler platter to try everything."}, {"review_id": "6SvUPKwGrAUa3JatrTFNgA", "user_id": "jmeaiVuAhZo3x4DEiH9EMA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/30/2017", "text": "Southern comfort!  This spot has delectable options.  Yes they are pricier than some other bbq joints in town but this spot is the one !  I tried their sample which comes w brisket, pulled pork sandwich, ribs and 3 sides.  I got mac and cheese, greens and pinto beans!  I shared all this with another person and was so satisfied.  So much food for under $25."}, {"review_id": "dmpal6B0OtfNNf_ipBzVqw", "user_id": "SyVSxzhC7An2mRMCPjXsnA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2017", "text": "Going back for seconds!
