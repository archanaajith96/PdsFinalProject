I know many people love bruschetta, but I usually find them (specifically, the bread) to be too hard or too soggy. A caprese salad with garlic bread would be tastier. BUT Postino serves up extraordinary bruschetta (bruschetti?). We ordered two orders of the bruschetta + bottle of wine (what a deal! Just $20 per order after 8 PM) so we got to sample 8 of the 12 offerings in total. I love how each bruschetta was sliced into 4 so that we could share them easily. Listed in order of faves: (1) PROSCIUTTO WITH FIGS & MASCARPONE: Sweet and savory. The thin layer of saltiness paired wonderfully with the chewy and tang of the figs and the sweetness of the mascarpone. (2) RICOTTA WITH DATES & PISTACHIOS: Totally unexpected and delicious. The nutty and buttery crunch of the pistachios paired with the chewy dates and the sweet ricotta = divine. (3) SMOKED SALMON WITH PESTO: Really well balanced and tasty.(4) BRIE & APPLES WITH FIG SPREAD: The green apples were very fresh and elevated the rich brie. (5) WARM ARTICHOKE SPREAD: Yummy! You could really taste the artichoke. (6) BURRATA, BACON, ARUGULA & TOMATO: Tasty, and exactly like you would expect these combinations to taste like. Although the taste of the burrata was buried under the bacon.(7) ROASTED PEPPERS WITH GOAT CHEESE: Assertive goat cheese and great taste of the roasted peppers.(8) SEASONAL: We got a tomato jam one, which tasted like an elevated lunchables pizza spread. I used to have these almost everyday in middle school! Quite interesting.If you are ordering one by yourself, I highly recommend (1) to (4) above! They are so interesting and the flavors come together to create scrumptious harmonies. Since I live across the country, I might try to recreate these flavors until I can come back and visit!"}, {"review_id": "IY2YmD8jJxTzig5jTDTThw", "user_id": "JAs3HUu6w13nOXTp2ofkxA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "This restaurant along with all the other Upward Project Restaurants is one I probably will not even go to.First of all when you call you get the options to press 1 for the location, and press 2 to make a reservation and to talk to someone awesome.  I assume that nobody makes a reservation as there is nobody awesome to talk to.  All you hear when you choose it is complete silence without anyone ever answering.I have tried time after time but the same thing all the time.  It is the same for Windsor, Joyrides Tacos, and  Federal Pizza.Will never find out how the food and service is at each of them. :)"}, {"review_id": "OTVIo78-ot7GWMZ_2mtIQg", "user_id": "DGR6BUVAm8jW7zxdmEQ7DQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Came here on a Monday night for their $20 board and bottle deal past 8pm.We waited for around 15-20 minutes and we got there at 7:45. The restaurant was incredibly busy, but that didn't take away from the great service we received. The staff was prompt about getting us our bottle of wine and informed us off the bat that the food would be a little backed up and would take 15-20 minutes. When our food came there was a mix up with one of the bruschettas. We told our server and she immediately went and got us the one we had ordered within 2 minutes.I was very impressed with the staff and how the restaurant was running as a whole for such a busy evening. I looked around and all the tables I could see looked happy. Will definitely come back to visit this location :)"}, {"review_id": "GuEasomEeSXxlYgb96OWcA", "user_id": "FI3ifkvRol42AkyyhpEgrQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Some friends and I came for board and bottle after a baseball game late one Tuesday night. Because who doesn't love baseball, bruschetta and wine? I finally got to try the Jean Phillipe and it was phenomenal!!!We were also celebrating my birthday and we all had a wonderful time. We were seated right away because we came in a little after 10 and were all served quickly.

I think that clearly gets my point across about how I feel about Postino. Their bruschetta, is amazing! I haven't tried on I didn't like, but I definitely have my favorites. My favorites being; the salami & pesto, smoked salmon w/ pesto, warm artichoke dip spread, prosciutto w/ fig & marscarpone. My all time favorite is the smoke salmon w/ pesto and if I could I would get a board with all salmon and pesto, but I get tempted with all the other options. I also love their service. I've been to three different location and I've never had an issue with the service. There's always a friendly, warm, welcoming ambiance at Postino. I've heard great things about their brunch and would love to pop in one of these days to explore more of their menu. If you're out of town or maybe it's your first time here, then I would go with their bruschetta because I feel like that's what they're really known for."}, {"review_id": "sSogD4sVkOdtrXRc99_BwQ", "user_id": "ojyEvT8dniHaz0qOJ6fFTQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "$5 before 5 deal is amazing!!

We arrived at 6:40 on a Saturday and waited 15 mins for a table. We sat outside, where they had several patio heaters that melt metal. We ordered the Bruschetta, which came with four choices. Great variety there. We made ours gluten free but you'd never have guessed. It was warm, soft and seasoned well. The toppings were well thought out and executed. We also split a Turkey Panini, which, when combined with the Bruschetta, was plenty for both of us. We actually couldn't finish it. The Panini was also on gluten free bread. It had pesto, tomato and greens and was savory and hearty. The atmosphere at Postino's was interesting: When we arrived, there was a 15-30 min wait. When we left, it was 1/4 full. Remind you, it was Saturday night. We will plan many return trips to Postino's on Central. Very good dinner."}, {"review_id": "Ixtae6rwTxrudC1mEcE_iA", "user_id": "AEQpkY089QMaP5ECx7qYRw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "This is my current favorite place.

You get four of them and super well served so. you best be hungry. I go here often alone and sit with my Kindle and read while slowly devouring my cheese board and a couple glasses of some good grapes.

The bruschetta is a must have. They have a bunch of different ones to choose from with a wide variety of fancy meats, cheeses, and spreads. Warm artichoke spread is for sure my favorite. They even offer gluten free bread! They also have a seasonal one so be sure to ask your server about that too. Normally you can get a board and choose 4 for $15 but if you go after 8pm on Monday or Tuesday you can get a bruschetta board and a bottle of wine for $20! Such a good deal. Also, be prepared for a wait.

I spent a lovely afternoon with the always awesome Kelley U. enjoying some shared \"bites on boards\". We ordered one board of bruschetta ($15) but in hindsight I would have liked to get another order of bruschetta to try out all the varieties instead of getting the butcher's block ($15.50). Everything about the bruschetta was near perfection. The bread was lightly toasted and strong enough to hold all the ingredients on top yet soft enough that it wouldn't be tough to eat. The ingredients on top were all fresh, well balanced, and a generous portion. Our selections were the warm artichoke, burrata bacon and arugula, prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, and pepper jelly with goat cheese. The butcher's block was also good, but I didn't like the toasted bread as much since some pieces were very hard while others were a little too chewy for my tastes. The ingredients for the board though were plentiful and a beautiful sight to behold though. Some of the foods included on the board were goat cheese, hummus, olives, roasted tomatoes, dried cherries, nuts, and asparagus spears. Service was friendly and polite. There was a slight miscommunication with our order (Our server didn't hear us when we requested the butcher board while ordering) but once it got cleared up our missing food came out in a matter of minutes.We got here right when it opened and it was easy to talk and dine. As lunchtime progressed though it got harder to hear each other as it got progressively more noisy in the dining area as more people got seated. The one reason why I decided to dine at Postino Central over the Arcadia location was that it was easier to find a parking spot. There are a small number of spots in front of the building but if you go around the corner to the back there are more spaces to choose from. It's not a huge lot but I had no problems finding a spot and when we left at noon on a weekday, despite being busy there were still a few spots left in the lot.I'll definitely be back for more of that bruschetta!"}, {"review_id": "2jTPspji995fr7A23MOr6Q", "user_id": "p5sRfw_mDHha3JXf7akIOA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "Char-coot-heaven. Bru-heck-YEAH!ttaThinking of my dinning experience there instantly makes my mouth water.You MUST get a bruschetta board. If you don't- go home. I'm sure the panini's are good but WHY would you get one when you can get a bruschetta board?We choose- Prosciutto, Figs & Mascarpone, Sweet & Spicy Pepper Jam with Goat Cheese; Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios and the Seasonal. SO GOOD. I really loved the sweet & spicy pepper jam with goat cheese.The Butcher's Block is also the star of the appetizers and SUCH a reasonable price for what you get. Our board was picked clean. Not an almond left for the mice.This place seems to get really busy. But it's worth the wait if you love cheese and carbs and cured meats. It's a nice warm, busy, modern and trendy vibe.Next time I'm back in Phoenix- I will make sure my friend takes me here."}, {"review_id": "-bgYzuKqzD8otjHOTm6D6g", "user_id": "1i3WvtGsIW8FGOFLvHHFMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/13/2017", "text": "We both loved the bruschetta and cheese board.  Food here is very good.We ordered the cheese board and most of the cheeses were awesome.  For bruschetta, pick the one with bacon.  That is the best one.  The other ones are good but not awesome!!We were stuffed.  That was plenty for two."}, {"review_id": "4-sCIlP4Z_gdlcC6zQaMtQ", "user_id": "IgDW1-6pNqp_TKWSaYccGg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/20/2017", "text": "Postinos is a gem.

The smoked salmon with pesto is also very good. The ambiance was nice for a date night, complete with fireplace outside. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. The only reason it isn't 5 stars is I didn't care for the autostrada panini much. It was a good sized sandwich but it just wasn't very toasted as it had barely notable grill marks and the meat and cheese were cool (I got the ciabatta bread) and despite the bread being good I felt like the bread to meat ratio was off: Too much bread and not enough meat or cheese. Either way I would definitely come back and try something other than the panini. It was a nice experience overall.
