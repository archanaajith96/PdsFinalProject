That first dinner was a formal sit down, during one of the epic Miami thunder storms. Since that time I have celebrated birthdays, first and multiple dates, solo  recovery meals, brought out of town friends and a bunch of times for takeout.My most recent visit was actually for takeout after errands and a 6 mile walk, during which I ordered my usual caprese salad covering up the whole to go box with fresh, creamy mozarella slices and tart tomatoes drizzled with a subtly sweet balsamic vinegar and olive oil in a full container. I skipped dessert (hello, I had actually exercised:) but indulged in my favorite classic Chicken Parmesan dinner. A very generous helping of pasta, three or four juicy & lightly breaded pieces of chicken with plenty of  marinara sauce how i like it.Besides tonight's dinner, I celebrated my birthday and come back for another \"treat myself \" dinner earlier in April. Klime, Anita and their whole crew go around and share time with myself and the other customers indulging every bit of late guests, custom orders and even saying hi to my Luna while I picked up my order. All of that wonderfulness put together is why I keep coming back. Here's to plenty more dinners!"}, {"review_id": "pU5degfIgfqwJaHJSAxb9w", "user_id": "l4RCZm_3tfXb4Nez0xaBxw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Best service in all Miami, personally my favorite restaurant.TOP Dishes:Seafood Risotto and Lasagna.Just awesome!"}, {"review_id": "AwdEp2ywXWWdqPCAeeOrQw", "user_id": "13UcYPMEAJ7k_HH3XE6VBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "My family and I love Crust. This is our go-to pizza/Italian restaurant in the downtown area. This family owned eatery is friendly, delicious, and have service that is consistency impressive. We are always greeted at the door as though our friends are welcoming us into their homes. We always start w the Kale salad, it is beautiful, healthily and very tasty. The pizza is fantastic! They are authentic and original. Their policy is that you can't make substitutes, additions, or subtractions to their speciality pizzas - they do not want to throw off the balance of flavors the chef has created, I admire that. The pasta is homemade and comes in plentiful portions. While they do not market themselves as a family style restaurant, their portions are more than enough to share. Gnocchi and linguine and meatballs are family favorites. Best chicken parm in town! I will leave it at that. You will not regret your trip to Crust!"}, {"review_id": "sjkpW872IuKAfM67Q2c-YQ", "user_id": "Icm-pfZ69TEZWndP5Bx8Ug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "This place is A1. If you're looking for some delicious Italian food, look no further. The pizza here is phenomenal and I highly recommend the crust pizza. The chicken parmesan is also one of the best I've ever had.  The sauce, the breading on the chicken, everything was done perfectly.  What made this place stand out even more was the phenomenal service and wait staff. They were super attentive and very friendly.  Our friend Sergio F was celebrating his birthday and they made his birthday song extra special when the co owner came out with the staff and sang along on the birthday song and then brought a round of shots to the table!   Once we were done with dessert, the wait staff came back with our left overs nicely packed and ready to go.  Overall a great experience and will definitely be coming back!!"}, {"review_id": "QYf8Lu0RY4zWu1JMDi-jNA", "user_id": "eH7tPQSXdihSwNUCgD6YlQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "This past Saturday my boyfriend and best friends planned a surprise birthday dinner and party for me. Upon getting to CRUST, parking couldn't have been easier as they have valet parking ($6). My group had made reservations so upon my arrival we were immediately seated. Service from that point forward was exceptional. The staff was attentive and good humored making it for an incredible experience. Anita the owner came up to my table and gave me a warm hug and wished me a happy birthday along with thanking me for choosing CRUST as the place to celebrate my special day. Beautifully decorated and reminding me very much of restaurants I've visited in New York City, I couldn't help but look around trying to capture each of their intricate wall pieces. Appetizers arrived within minutes of us placing our order and were truly delicious. We ordered the pan fried mozzarella, burrata, the garlic rolls, the fried calamari, and the grilled octopus. The group raved about each of the appetizers. I personally tried the pan fried mozzarella and the garlic rolls which were excellent. The garlic rolls are topped with the most delicious Parmesan cheese mixture. We also ordered three large pizzas: pepperoni, Hawaiian, and three cheese white, which were all excellent. The crust was crispy and the pizzas were right out of the oven when they got to our table. Lastly, our group ordered the tiramisu which the servers brought to me along with shots of dessert wine for the entire table while singing happy birthday to me. This was a wonderful experience and I truly cannot wait to come back to CRUST."}, {"review_id": "LyxH4DdWcnITnZ_gBq3RbQ", "user_id": "LHpRzIVqoJVTZjfP4BDK-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Hmmmm... CRUST! So good. I drive by CRUST almost every day and one day it just caught my eye. I immediately yelped it and boy was I excited to check it out. I mentioned it to a few friends and to my surprise one of them mentioned being a loyal customers. Mental note made. A few weeks went by and the opportunity presented itself. It was time to give CRUST a try. I called over to see how capacity was and I was greeted by a very friendly voice that asked for how many. I explained that it was two and she said there was no wait for a small party like mine. Mind you, this was on a Tuesday night. From my friends experience, I had been told to \"make reservations\". CRUST is delicious and gets really busy. It took me about 15 minutes to arrive. I drove around the block a few times. Although, they have valet. I prefer to park my car myself whenever I can. Street parking wasn't a problem on a weeknight, but for weekends. I am sure that Valet or UBER are the way to go. As soon as I opened the door, I was welcomed by the Hostess and a familiar face (thank you Yelp): Anita, Co owner. She was so friendly and gracious. Her immediate question was \"did you call for a party of two?\" And I smiled and said yes. She later explained that she had been asking every party of two if they had made the call. I thought that was very sweet and personable. We were seated right away and had a chance to review the menu. Soooo many delicious options. Ultimately we decided on: the grilled octopus, the meatballs, a Hawaiian pizza and the tiramisu. WOWWWWWWWWWWWWW. Let's start with, italian food is typically not my top cuisine choice and I was really happy with all that I had. The octopus was a generous portion as was everything else. The taste was phenomenal. The service attentive. The decor felt like a cozy New York spot. I was impressed and very happy. When we finished our meal, Anita came by to ask what we thought and offered a cordial (digestive wine) It was delicious. Like everything else we had. CRUST, you've quickly made it to the top of my favorites. And I wish that you remain there forever. I can't wait for our next moment."}, {"review_id": "Vf43R9hJ0Eh8Rny2F3MMFg", "user_id": "YMg8_Rrb7cYnIm7T6D4F0Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I came here on a whim because i remembered hearing good things about this place. I was in the area at a happy hour event and i decided to come here for dinner. We started off with the garlic rolls, i honestly think they were the best garlic rolls ive ever had. The bread was as soft and fluffy as a pillow and the garlic to bread ratio was on point. we ordered three different pizza pies- The truffle pizza, the white pizza with spinach, and pepperoni. We tried each others pizzas and all three were so yummy. We took the leftovers and they barely lasted a day in the fridge, we ate them any chance we got! i would definitely come back here! those garlic rolls are calling my name!"}, {"review_id": "sPATMc2Vf11z13Ss-Gul_Q", "user_id": "6Q1BEEOxAfSqTY5VdH8k5A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "Oh, this review is long long long overdue.My dear friend and coworker Foquita set up  my Birthday dinner here. We, the pizza fans, always enjoy a good birthday pizza.What was dangerous about it all was the fact that she created such a hype around Crust that it was going to be hard for it to the restaurant live up to the promise. Fortunately, it did.(Yeah, I know I should've kept the suspense a few more paragraphs, but why? You're here to decide where to eat, Crust is a good decision. If you want the details, read on, if not, go get your pizza!)First of all: the parking looks tiny, but they have complimentary valet, so that's one problem solved right there.They do take reservations, so our 10 people group (including a baby) was properly seated and tended.I had a grilled octopus pizza that I actually couldn't finish (it was good freshly made, and the slice I took home and ate cold later was still very good... that's how you really know that a pizza is good!)Some of the guests had pizzas to share, some had individual pizzas, and there was even a vegetarian pasta around. I didn't try other people's plates, but they not only looked good, everyone seemed to enjoy their stuff.I can talk about the grilled octopus pizza: it was very good, if perhaps a bit on the salty side... I think maybe the kalamata olives' flavor overpowers a little the octopus, and they, combines with the prosciutto, may be responsible for the saltiness. I will still recommend you try it, though.The ambiance is a bit dark, but it works well. And it gets to feel a bit crowded. Even then, the staff is attentive and efficient and you don't really feel abandoned, even if you have to wait a bit.Overall, I think it is a good place to return to, and the menu has a good variety (I have to try the Crust pizza next time, it seems like an interesting mix)."}, {"review_id": "B2PAKpkVrNXKB58KtxG5cQ", "user_id": "-BuhcKIN_7vXm59HAuAbsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I've had this restaurant bookmarked for ever, and finally we decided to go on a Saturday for an early dinner. Right on the side of the Miami River neighborhood the restaurant offers a convenient valet parking. When we got there the restaurant was full with a 45 min wait, but kindly the hostess accommodated us in a table in the outdoor area while we waited. Service was outstanding !! and the owner (I didn't know she was the owner until the end when I left) arranged a table inside in less than 30 minutes because she didn't want us to wait that long since we had an impatient baby with us. The restaurant inside is cozy and our waiter was nice and attentive. The food was absolutely delicious and we didn't know that the portions are practically family size and good to share so we ended up taking more than half home. Prices are good and portions are huge...so when you go give them a visit make sure to go extra hungry Lol"}, {"review_id": "G6RNvEd_qYZBUjatDs0JRQ", "user_id": "m3CGH2ZcaZs5czo2iCTsew", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "Me and some friends were having drinks close by when all of a sudden everyone decided we needed some food. Naturally everyone looks at the Yelper . I remembered that we were close to Crust which Ive been eyeing for sometime. Who doesn't love Italian? So we arrive around 6 on a  Sunday with no reservations.So upon arrival we were told that they were booked and that its almost impossible to eat there on weekends with no reservations. We immediately noticed that the bar area was completely empty and that there were tables outside. When we asked they said they were not taking outdoor table service that day and that bar service was not available yet which we thought was kind of odd.So we went outside and decided to look for something else when the owner Annita came out and told us to come in that we cud in-fact sit at the bar all 5 of us. Were we glad we got to stay. The menu special was a 3 course meal ( app, entree, desert) for $40. Really hard to beat all though that menu is limited. You can still order from the full menu a la carte. I decided to stick to the 3 course. I had the meatballs for the appetizer which gives you two giant meatballs with ricotta sauce and basil and a piece of bread. All the portions here are huge especially for the price.For the entree I ordered the chicken Parm which was massive. Literally 3 big chicken cutlets smothered in cheese and sauce and served with spaghetti. I really  enjoyed the sauce which is a bit sweet but also a bit tangy and a little heavy on the basil for my taste but very good nonetheless. Unfortunately I had no room left for the cannolis. You get 3 mini cannolis which had a great cream filling.  By the time I tried the cannoli the shell wasn't crispy anymore so I wont comment much there. The restaurant is kinda small and the location is a bit out of the way down the river close to Kikis , Garcias etc. The owner was nice enough to come by and chat with us quite a bit very nice down to earth people. Our bar server Chris was excellent and very attentive. The bar has a dark romantic vibe . Great place for a date. I will definitely be back to try there pizza which we kept seeing coming out of the kitchen and looked amazing!! I recommend you bring and extra stomach if you come to eat here..."}, {"review_id": "sE9oOl8-22iaMQO8cgyVvQ", "user_id": "rWw9uUZ85QwOLTaii4mntQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/11/2018", "text": "I finally made my way to Crust, and boy, had I been missing a great restaurant. Oddly located just off the Miami river bridge, this quirky restaurant is poorly lit, tables very close to each other in a rowdy dining room. Waiters waft around delivering enormous portions of classic Italian American dishes and creative Italian inspired concoctions. If you are used to Miami portions, this is definitely not it. Any dish can feed two or some even up to four people. Prices are laughable, and quality in service and execution is unparalleled. Don't be discouraged by the location or the noise.

I actually had a reservation for another night but the Wharf down the street was way to crowded for our taste. So happy we landed here. The area is very cool with a great vibe. The food was delicious. Our waiter Jerry was great. My only criticism is he said we were going to have plenty of food and we should order the smaller pizza but he didn't tell us how big the entrees were. We started off with pizza and it was delicious with a great crust. Then I had the eggplant parm which literally could feed three people. It was great. The owner Anita came over with a complimentary shot of port, asked how our meal was and seemed so thrilled we chose her spot for dinner. I love that.

The reviews don't lie when they say the portions are massive- but who doesn't love delicious leftovers? We both ordered off of the pre-fixe dinner menu since there were so many dishes we wanted to try. Order 1: shrimp cakes (not pictured), seafood risotto, limoncello cake; Order 2: meatballs (not pictured), chicken parmesan, triple chocolate cake. The food was delicious! Starting with the appetizers: The shrimp cakes had the perfect amount of crunch on the outside and the sauce and mushrooms added an extra depth of flavor. The sauce with the meatballs was amazing and paired together with the ricotta, the meatballs were one of the best I've ever had. The entrees: The seafood risotto came with generous amounts of seafood and was cooked with perfection. The chicken parmesan was tender and again, had their amazing tomato sauce. The dessert: the chocolate cake was good but the limoncello cake was amazing!! It had the perfect amount of tartness and sweetness.
