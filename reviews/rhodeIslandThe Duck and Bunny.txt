Service was so solid, music was good, the inside is set up and decorated well, and the drinks menu is well put together. Extensive cocktails that are creative, food selection of wine and beer, and a huge tea selection.  But above all (ambiance, menu, service, prices) the real stand out is the cupcakes. The flavors seem to change regularly, but the mocha chocolate and pistachio raspberry were easily some of the best things I've had in a while dessert wise. I imagine this spot is amazing to visit when it's nice out, saw that they have some outdoor space. Definitely check it out if you are in town!"}, {"review_id": "n7aSGPsYUB9CdlIQdB4k4A", "user_id": "TdodIrrwclw8Oc1B5H-mIA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "This place is unbelievably cute, parking can be hard but put on some walking shoes and take in the scenery if you don't find a near by spot. Brunch/lunch and light diners will not disappoint! Vegan options are a huge plus! Backyard patio in the summer is dreamy!!! Great spot for dates! (Its quieter than you would think) Every time I'm here I say I won't eat a cup cake, but I do, they are so good you will not regret it! This is our go to place for bringing visiting family/friends to Providence it's always a hit, really reasonably priced, has something for everyone, licensed, close to tons of other stuff and the service is always great!"}, {"review_id": "U4dqKYjjvEwCXGpQg_MeLg", "user_id": "HtzGBeEJ7Y5UV-_uGO52oQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "The cutest brunch/afternoon tea shop I've been to!After sleeping in on a spring break day, my friends and I stopped by to grab some afternoon tea. We ordered their sampler plate to split among the three as well as their cranberry mimosa. Their sampler comes with an assortment of finger sandwiches, mini cupcakes, and cookies -- complemented by a pot of tea of your choice (we got their Early Grey!). This is supposed to be an entire meal for one but it was just right for a light afternoon snack to share. Loved basically everything on their sampler -- their salmon/cream cheese sandwich and cupcakes were especially memorable! The Earl Grey was very nicely brewed and had a great sweet taste with some milk.Grabbed some of their duck and bunny cards on the way out because their illustrations were so adorable. If I'm ever back in Providence, definitely coming back to try their other brunch dishes and cupcakes!"}, {"review_id": "_WHnoGkWCSAAZBu7AS8RRw", "user_id": "6pTHuzch57b5uvHDqjMvqQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "I really wanted love this place since it has such great reviews, and I was almost there!

Yes the food was okay, but nothing I would go back to time and time again. But the atmosphere was just so darn cute that it was fun to eat there. I really liked the building, it was like eating in an old house but in a cute way! The coffee drinks were good so I can't ding them on that.

While this place is so cute and the food was good, I am holding onto a 3-4 star rating for a couple of reasons. First, the hostess is so prompt, cheery and professional -- but she gave wait times of 20-30 minutes when the wait was 50 mins to an hour. On a busy Saturday I could tell she was trying to please everyone, but the reality is that people are hungry and might not want to wait. Since we thought our wait was 20 minutes, we stood in the cramped doorway. That 20 minutes turned into an hour. There IS a small waiting/seating area in the middle of the restaurant but it only has seating for about 7 people. On a Saturday morning there were upwards of 25 people waiting. Once we got to our table the server was prompt and polite. She took our order right away and food came fast. Latkes here were good. Not excellent, but good enough to scarf down after waiting an hour. I ordered the eggs benedict with salmon on focaccia. All ingredients seemed fresh and high quality, except the focaccia was crisper than I would have imagined and you really don't get a lot of bread. I ran out of bread about two bites into each egg. My friend and I did agree that the hollandaise sauce was good though! The check was brought very quickly (obviously more parties were waiting) and then we were on our way. Overall I would come back for the quaint decor and to try some of the teatime offerings, but I probably wouldn't wait again on a weekend."}, {"review_id": "lRwi-ZhyEBrJlw7A07g7XA", "user_id": "YcoxoC8sw2RLEdaAP3ZYdw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/9/2017", "text": "I came here with my girlfriend for a weekend trip and this was the first stop we went to for brunch.  We came here around 12pm and it was very packed.  It was around a 30 minute wait, but they had seats for you to sit when waiting but very limited.  They have seats outside and inside.  The restaurant is pretty big and have very cute interior. It's a really nice location to go with your daughter for brunch and tea/coffee.  They really know how to use all the space they have because there was one small table in the entry room.  Service: The waitress was very nice and know when to take our order when we were ready.  Drinks: My girlfriend got honey latte and she said it was good and as always I love seeing artwork on the latte in a cup.  Food: It's brunch of course we gotta get the eggs Benedict!

Although we waited an hour around lunch time on a Saturday, the menu and cupcakes were worth it. We shared the afternoon tea. It came with finger sandwiches, scones and an assortment of mini cupcakes. The tea wasn't anything to shout about. The sandwiches were not anything special, I have had better elsewhere. The scones were on the dry side. The cupcakes though were AMAZING. That being said, people around us all got mimosas or cocktails and they did look very good! I also saw what other people had ordered and it looked delicious as well. Their meals look beautifully plated and it looked like you got a lot for what you paid.

It has a vintage design/theme with great decor, but the place is quite small. It is located in an old colonial home and is very easy to miss. If you're lucky enough to fall upon this place, it is so quaint! My french toast was a perfect size, but my friends' portions were smaller than we hoped.  However, the flavors are GREAT and the Portuguese french toast with banana foster and pecans is amazing. We came at a perfect time, we were seated within 10 minutes of arriving and came right before the rush! There is street parking, although it probably gets crowded on a weekend. To be honest, I was really looking forward to the cupcakes after reading so many reviews on Yelp. We had gotten an assortment of the different cupcakes and the cake part was a little dry, in my opinion.I absolutely love the service at this place, all the servers were very kind. Especially our waitress who was so knowledgeable, kind, and patient (we were being pretty indecisive). The hostess was also very kind and greeted us with a smile!

As a New Yorker well versed in the fine art of brunch, I have to say that this spot could hold its own against any of the popular brunch and crepe joints of Manhattan. Besides a sweet parlor interior, there's a beautiful back garden decorated in a hip and shabby chic vibe. Perfect for bridal showers, afternoon teas, or just a long golden afternoon of tea. Alongside the usual elegant savory crepes, they still have a nod to their Rhode Island roots with New York System dogs and coffee milk. My honey latte was the best way to cap off the afternoon. The highlight of my delicious meal had to be the cookie dough cupcake however - and too many more flavors I wish I had the stomach capacity to try!

I think they call it a \"snuggerie\" because you're crammed into this small space next to other customers, tables, and chairs. Good luck navigating this place when it's packed if you are a larger sized person, because there's no room for you here. Your only hope is that the outdoor seating area is open and that there's a table for you outside. Let's talk about today's visit, a friend and I went to enjoy their \"afternoon tea\" selection of sandwiches, mini cupcakes, and other traditional accompaniments. We were seated in the \"inside room\" at an all too familiar tiny table. The smell of peanut butter sandwich coming from the table next to me was overwhelming - especially for someone like me who can't stand peanut butter, but the little boy eating it is cool so I resolve to minding my own business and let him eat his sandwich without making a big deal that I'm basically half an arms length away from a tiny human who could literally wipe his peanut butter covered fingers on me ((*shudders*)) The service is pleasant and average enough but the food is awesome and the only reason why I return here.

The cuteness of this place is almost suffocating but its quirkiness adds a classy, elegant flair. But, beyond the decor, I feel like this place is truly overrated. The prices are too much for what they are (just different versions of crepes) and the portion size. Even though the food itself is good, I've never left feeling completely satisfied with my meal. Their cocktails are also hit and miss because there is a huge size and value range. I don't feel like I should pay more than $10 for a tiny flute of champagne + juice. The cupcakes are good but extremely rich. Their icing tastes like it's 75% butter, and I can't tell if this is a positive or negative. Sure, I've waited an hour+ to get brunch on the weekends or even 30 minutes for a late night table. But every time I leave, I question why I ever made that decision. I feel like this place has definitely capitalized on their name and decor.
