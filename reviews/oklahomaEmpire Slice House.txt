This pie mecca has great reviews and a cult like following, so be prepared to wait--a while--for a table or bar stool. But Cheesus Crust, is it worth it. In my travels to and from OKC, I compare pizza to Empire. Usually, it's the first place I go after landing at Will Rogers. I'm mildly obsessed (but I don't have the tattoo--yet)Items I love: classic pepperoni slice  it's perfect and iconic. It's got the right amount of toppings, good flex for folding, and the signature Empire chew on the crust. Pink sauce--think ranch with more dill and a mere suggestion of sirracha for color. Dunk all of your crusts in it. Rocksteady. Brussel Westbrook. Foghorn Leghorn. Teflon Don. Fungus Amongus.  There is no such thing as a bad pizza here. Slices are $3.75. A crisp, icy cold cheap beer (Lionshead, made in PA!) will run you $2. The decor is free.99 Be prepared for a wait on busy nights. They text you when your table is ready, so go wander through the Plaza District and grab a drink. Then, pizza."}, {"review_id": "g9IIARA7pNRiv9tVUdVsfQ", "user_id": "SKwMaFXP4Umiihb7bd4xlg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Very good pizza! Best in OKC but not the best ever you know? But still very good! The crust is like a thinner hand tossed but not really a thin crust in the sense that it is not crispy. I like the crust but it's a little bit doughy for me. The toppings is where they really shine. Everything tastes super fresh. From the sauce, the cheese, the meats and veggies. EVERYTHING tastes super fresh and just really really great! To me, that's what makes the pizza because all these fresh flavors are awesome. You have the options to choose from the slices of the day: cheese, pepperoni and 4 rotating flavors. You of course can also order a whole pizza which only comes in once size: LARGE! You get a lot of specialty pizza for about $25. Definitely worth it. I like coming here during the week because it just gets out of control on the weekends but if that's your scene then enjoy!"}, {"review_id": "4YPQPRt2TXDlvXBjrXV6AQ", "user_id": "9QcFe5myok5jYUwTpEeuxg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Hopped down to the plaza district for a late lunch. We hadn't been to Empire and decided to have some pizza and beer.  We sat on the patio and enjoyed the gorgeous spring weather. The waitress was very attentive and knowledgeable. The beer selection is quite extensive with some good beers on tap and tons of others in cans. We decided to order a whole pie instead of individual pieces. The pies are huge.  We ordered the Teflon Don. It was perfect.  Lots of meat and fresh red and green bell peppers.  The sausage was a tiny bit spicy but I loved it. Not too spicy. We would totally go again if we are down in that section of town.  Next time i want to try the ghostface killah."}, {"review_id": "3WAaVQS2wJgo5_lxZHmgQw", "user_id": "0MFiXakgg3_W0Gmquloa2g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "After multiple visits, I've come to the conclusion that Empire Slice perfectly embodies the shrug/idk emoji. Nothing about their food or service is terrible, and yet nothing about their pizza or service sticks out as anything more than...not terrible. The pizzas I've tried (Fungus Among Us, Pepperoni, Foghorn Leghorn, and Notorious P.I.G.) have all been okay, but I wouldn't say they're worth the wait or price. And these \"okay\" pizzas are ones that have been ordered as whole pies and not by-the-slice. By-the-slice pizzas at Empire sit under heat lamps for far too long and end up turning into soggy and dried out versions of their whole-pie counterparts. By-the-slice pizzas fall under my \"pbbt\" category.Oh and the ranch at Empire...terrible. Mischievous and deceitful. Chicanerous and deplorable. It's especially terrible because it tastes like they just left a bottle of Kraft Fat-Free Ranch out in the open and then thought \"oh right, we're in Oklahoma. We should probably have ranch. Here just use this one...nah, charge 'em $0.50 for it. They won't mind.\"Overall, I don't quite understand the fandom associated with Empire. The wait times are long, the pizzas aren't the best, and the prices are kinda wonky. Maybe I haven't tried enough of their pizzas. At the same time, I think I've given them enough chances to prove me wrong and it hasn't happened yet."}, {"review_id": "LsowHy0V9-3Ea2-7TMamiQ", "user_id": "zSPZVhJf3F8_RBZP05MH8Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "We checked in online (only way to do it when they are busy or you will wait for over an hour)The place was hipster and clean, the food was great!

Should have gone to Umpire. Also noticed Slim Shady in here, with zits. Must be a problem with Em's-pores. And don't forget that being Buddhist and Zen can really give you strength. They call it Ommm-power.But this is none of those. This is Empire.I'm glad there's only one of these places, rather than a whole Empire of them (ha, ha), because honestly, this pizza does nothing for me. My NYC, Chicago, Buffalo, Detroit pizza standards are so stellar, though, that it's not surprising that it didn't do a thing for me. I did find a lot of amazing stuff in OKC (like Quoc Bao and Arbuckle Fried Pies) but the favourite slice of the hipsters wasn't it.If I was giving ratings for the gorgeousness of the patrons and employees, though - and the absolutely awesome, left-wing decor - it'd score off-the-charts 5.The people working here are really attractive and pretty friendly - so I really wanted to like it, and the price of pizza isn't very good, but it could also be worse in this neighborhood, at about $4.06. Expensive for Oklahoma, expensive for most cities I get pizza in, on par with NYC slices almost (gasp), but at least it was a big slice.That's where the positive remarks stop. Unfortunately - and I hate to say this to all of you, because I sound annoying - but as somebody that lives in New York and loves pizza in many different parts of the country, especially the Northeast - this is not good pizza. The bread isn't very good. The crust isn't very good. The toppings are fairly average. It just doesn't have much going on. Tastes not homemade and not done very well.It's a real shame because people love it a lot and it's very popular and the servers are awesome, so I wanted to love it as well, but it's just not going to happen. I'll give it another try in future but I'm pretty sure I know how it's going to go.My dreams of having great pizza in OKC are burning now, on the funeral Pyre.

It is the quality of ingredients and the uniqueness of the combination of toppings that really does it for me. The prices are also cheap and beer selection is well rounded.

We both got evil empire which is a spicy food lover's dream - I would advise against more than two slices due to indigestion after or stomach pains.

I'm probably not gonna get a lot of likes on this review since its such a local favorite, BUT... it just wasn't all that it was hyped up to be. I will give it another chance, since its so popular, and i probably just didn't get the right type of pizza there, so i am taking suggestions for sure. So the pizza was \"OK\", I just wasn't impressed with the type of pizza i had. I believe it was called Ghost Face... It was a sad excuse for a pizza, I'll just leave it at that. Now, the other kind I had was called something like \"Rock...\", but i just can't remember for sure. That pizza was by far the best one, and I saw some others on the menu that looked good, but just weren't available for the day (which is why I'm giving it another chance). Overall the atmosphere was great, and the server was great as well. I don't focus too much on the pizza joint itself when i go, i just focus on the pizza (which is the most important thing). I really did like the way they covered the walls with old wall posters, it definitely gives you that 80's vibe for sure. If your in the area, and just want some pizza then i would suggest this place for an overall experience, but maybe not the best pizza you've ever had experience...

We drove through quiet neighborhoods to get to  a fairly popping area of the city with bars and restaurants lining up the streets. This was a good sign... but unfortunately the pizzas really didn't do much for us.We decided to order three (3) different slices from their \"Slices of the Day,\" for $3.50 each. We went with the Foghorn Leghorn, Midnight Cowboy, and the MCA to go. Our waiter accidentally put in three orders of the first one, and when we asked him to take it off, he graciously comped these for us which was very nice (since they were already heating it up).I think the fact that the pizzas weren't fresh and heated up gave us a pretty meh experience. Each slice of pizza felt dry, had hard crusts, and overall did not wow us in any department.The Foghorn was the best with marinara, chicken, bacon, and jalapeños drizzled over. But it still wasn't really an amazing pizza.I give them props for comping us a few slices and for being open late, but I would not recommend the actual pizza themselves. Maybe if we come back, we will instead opt for one large, freshly prepared order instead."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/empire-slice-house-oklahoma-city?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
