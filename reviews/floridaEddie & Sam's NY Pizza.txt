When you walk in you will get in line to pick out what you would like to eat. The pizzas and Calzones are put on display, and a staff member will come up to you to ask what you would like. I was overwhelmed with the amount of pizza selections they had, so if you are craving any toppings to mind they probably have it! They do not skimp out on the toppings and how big the pizzas are. We chose the Hawaiian and Chicken Bacon BBQ Pizza. They will plop the pizza back into the oven for a bit to crisp it and warm it up before serving it to you. The pizza was delicious and was pretty filling for only ~$3.00 and up! They are also connected to the Gelato shop next door, so if you're craving some sweets you can just walk to the next room!"}, {"review_id": "kDfTthdAeciB-SgSwsts6w", "user_id": "_urq_02yXuwm1tiMRDHHtg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Amazing amazing pizza.  One of my favorites anywhere on the country.  Great lunch special.  6.49 for2 giant slices and a fountain drink I wish they'd put a location somewhere that didn't have such poor parking availability"}, {"review_id": "dyVJEE9l97YTYLKipgNJPg", "user_id": "3YcdA5GeCsPuuIscyNLQYA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "I'm not a pizza expert by any means but I think Eddie and Sam's is some of the best pizza in Tampa. They have a huge variety of options whether you want it by the slice or by the pie! I absolutely love the white sauce pizza! There's also an amazing bakery/gelato place located in the same building. Perfect dessert after pizza. It's also conveniently located a couple blocks from the parking garage and also right across the street from a metered parking lot which makes it super easy to get to (considering parking downtown can sometimes get crazy)."}, {"review_id": "Pkm6k1-_WbSVqhMBv4MTXw", "user_id": "nok8EGzOP8NTefKcR1EG4g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Totally a fan of this place. Great pizza joint where they can serve you by the slice! Not the best pizza in the world, but it comes out super fast and it's cheap.Their spaghetti and meatball... now that's something to write home about. The spaghetti is cooked perfectly and the meatballs and the meat sauce are absolutely delicious. The portion size is huge and I have regretted finishing it several times but once you start twirling the pasta on your fork, you won't stop until it's all gone!

I ordered a supreme slice and they put it in the oven for a few minutes and then handed it over. First of all, authentic NY pizza has a decent amount of cheese, the supreme slice I was given here had hardly any on it, just sprinkled here and there. Further, NY slices are a good size, my slice here was small. It tasted fresh, but with the lack of cheese, it wasn't anything to write home about."}, {"review_id": "tVwPDBHlYbhJKRGy0CsRIQ", "user_id": "-kLVfaJytOJY2-QdQoCcNQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Fantastic place to get pizza.I can see why this place has good reviews, who doesn't love a delicious slice of pizza. You order before you walk down the line where all the pizzas are on display so make sure you know what you want before you get in line! I always love a good white pizza so I was happy when I saw they had two options, your basic white pizza and a white pizza with spinach. My husband went with a slice of pepperoni and a slice of bbq chicken with bacon. They grab that monstrous slice and throw it in the oven to make sure the cheese is bubbling when you get it. The line moves quickly so don't worry if it is a long one. The pizza comes to you hot so you may have to wait a minute before eating. This is a pretty herculean task - I should know, the roof of my mouth is still burnt. The slices range between $2 - $4 and each slice is so big it is meal in itself. I love thin crust and they perfect it well. They also have containers of marinara sauce so you can go to town dipping your crust in it. This place was busy on a Friday night at about 7 p.m. There weren't any tables inside so we opted to sit outside. By the time we left, there were almost no tables outside as well. I'm lucky this place isn't close to me or that would be incredibly dangerous. This is definitely one of my new favorite spots to grab a slice."}, {"review_id": "e1jnI3aVfaH-yNUNoud67w", "user_id": "QSIoCtJ1emofP1My3BfmHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I didn't want to believe in the hype of this place because every single pizza joint in TB area says they have the best NYC pizza. But this place really lives up to the hype! First, you can't beat the price. Under $4 for a giant slice of cheese NYC slice that can be mistaken for ordering 2? YES please. Pizza pies that actually are pies? YES please. The service line is pretty efficient too, and I liked how organized they are. And...that gelato station in the other area? I love & hate it because the last thing I need is to eat some gelato after I wolfed down some greasy but so worth it pizza... really not aligned with my fitness goals and lifestyle but DARN it, that gelato station is great. I had to get some because European desserts are my sweet weakness."}, {"review_id": "GEMjmztDuOu4JQCXU2Sxsg", "user_id": "AwGP1zmqNZVnRmYFliCq6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "I dropped in for a quick slice and grabbed the eggplant parm. What a mistake, because I've been craving it ever since and it's pretty far away from me! Their case is full of options of uniquely topped pizzas.

Meat lovers, pepperoni bacon, cheese pizza, eggplant Parmesan all good ! The water is shipped in from New York so that's what makes the bread different. It's crunchy and soft at the same time most of the pizzas are thin crust and they are very generous in their toppings . Slices are huge and average price is 3 to 4 dollars each. If you have a big group and looking for a large pizza they have a 28 inch pizza . Parking is easy to find there is a lot right across the street but pay to park .

They get their water from Brooklyn, New York. Which really does make a difference. They give you a healthy amount of toppings on your pizza.

Also they have the fancier new Coke machines that give you a big variety.  The prices are very reasonable especially for how good the pizza is."}, {"review_id": "uDYFqgA0V3ZMx-DQ4LxJ6g", "user_id": "nXoMel2fnA_dbgtZgpS0Uw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "First time here!Obviously I ate here based on the reviews of my fellow Yelpers. The place was packed inside and outside which was not a problem for me because I was ordering to go.The ordering process was quite simple and straightforward. My hubby and I got a 20\" pizza (will def go smaller next time) half lasagna and half Brooklyn Bridge. The pizza itself was made very well with a thin crust and lots of toppings. As far as the flavors of the pizza, I did not feel like they blended well. The fried chicken on the Brooklyn Bridge was a full meal in itself and took away from the other flavors. The lasagna should be renamed to the ricotta because that's all it really was. We are definitely planning to go back and be a little more basic with our order as I feel they would do the basic flavors really well.

I don't believe anyone from New York would know that this pizza was made in Florida, unless you told them beforehand. I stopped in after a meeting in the area and was met with a HUGE line (literally 40 people in line at lunch time). I started to second guess my choice - but they really handled that massive line so quickly, I can only suspect some type of voodoo magic.Pizza was as expected - perfect crust, cheese, and sauce. They had so much variety of things available that I think on every visit you could find something to come back for on the NEXT visit. Great lunch special - 2 slices of cheese and a drink for $5.

Crust is thin and crispy and manages to hold up to the heaping amount of toppings they put on the pie. Definitely a go-to for pizza in Tampa. Get over there!
