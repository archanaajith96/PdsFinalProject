Roger richly deserves more than Five Stars.Exceptional Pork Ribs, more than exceptional Beef Brisket, very good Pulled Pork. We tried a newer menu addition, Tacos (three for $8), with you choice of brisket, chicken and pulled pork. We tried one of each ... just delicious, could not be happier.The sides are pretty good ... the BBQ Beans are exceptional, the Mac n Cheese is very good (spicy), the Fried Pickles very good, the Slaw is good, the Kicked Up Corn is just ok, and the Potato Salad needs some oomph.I have eaten at Roger That BBQ more than 20-times now, and it is killing me, because I love to try new restaurants, and every time I ask the family \"where to today?,\" they sing the \"Roger That BBQ meat, meat and more meat song. It is just that GOOD.Talk about long hours, every time I have been there, Roger and his wife have been in the kitchen, making sure the food they served met their high standards. Plenty of parking, the dining room clean and tables bussed, clean bathrooms, excellent service and friendly, enthusiastic Staff.BBQ Nirvana. Five Stars, I wish I could make it Eight!"}, {"review_id": "_wg35v7JFi2xtlmkEoGwhQ", "user_id": "6Qk-Sc0NVUkimL-CX433Rw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "I just got back from Texas and was hoping to eat some \"authentic\" bbq; after eating at Roger That BBQ, I found out that we've got great bbq right here in Salem!#1) the portions are huge; in fact a couple could share a plate and walk away full!#2} The brisket is moist and tasty; not an overwhelming smoke flavor, just the essence of smoke.#3} The sides were pretty good -- the corn and bbq beans were our favorite. My only complaint is that the sides are warm; I want them to be hot.#4) no sauce is necessary, but it was flavorful.If you haven't been there, GO! If you've been there, I know you're going back.

Thu & Fri they open at 4, Sat & Sun they open at noon... they close when the food is gone... so depending the on supply and demand of the day, you might get there only to have disappointed tastebuds.   Service: Stellar!  Staff is friendly, outgoing and VERY informed about their product.  The Sides: Great selection!Deep fried pickles: Oh ma Lawd!!!  Delish!  The perfect combination of tart, fried and the new best friend for your ranch dipping sauce!Coleslaw:  Pretty standard although they do add bits of pineapple (would love to see more!) which gives it a new fresh twist.Tater salad: Again pretty standard with a twist of olives which is good but not really fitting (in this gal's opinion) for a bbq place.Fries: Yummy, salty crinkley fries... Kicked-up Corn: Think Creamed Corn with an attitude! Flavorful with a touch of spicy... Yum!!The Meats:  Ribs were sold out so we did the brisket/chicken combo.Brisket: Tender, a little on the dry side but not too bad.  Flavor was a little disappointing but not horrible all (think upscale pot roast).  I was hoping for more smoke flavor.Chicken: Darn near cooked to perfection!  Tender & Juicy with the right amount of smoke and flavor.So all in all a great little place and in my top 10 of bbq favorites.  I can't wait to try those ribs!"}, {"review_id": "Eq2crJjre8-bfo1ivBmN5g", "user_id": "lCQxWsNejHi1x1PSrkVFBg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Amazing, wonderful, we have found our new best friend Looking for good BBQ look here out of the way but well worth the drive."}, {"review_id": "yGVg4G3o5mv79Ewu1vYz5A", "user_id": "6eilRaUDPl1Vz8liYPpZjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "I've been to many BBQ places - but this is my first in a shared odd fellows hall.  It's only open Thursday - Sunday, so you need to plan your time and when I say you need to plan your time, you NEED to.The bbq here is some of the most tender, flavorful and reasonably priced Q I've ever had the joy of eating.  The smokey flavor was really all I needed, however their thin but tasty bbq sauce is a nice addition.I had the brisket sandwich - and it was more than I could eat - even after showing up pretty hungry.  It was served on a hoagie roll that could have used a little more toast but I wanted to eat it with my fork anyway so I could enjoy each morsel.The wife had the bbq brisket philly cheese steak sandwich - her second choice as they had already run out of chicken when we arrived.  The cheese steak version is chunks of brisket, onions, bell peppers and cheese - also, more than she could eat. I had a couple of links on the side, just to try and get some more variety of flavors.  While they weren't bad, they weren't the brisket either. I choose the bbq beans for my side - really meaty, fresh made (the beans weren't mush at all), great flavor.  The wife had the potato salad - something she found to be \"very good\".  Drinks are self serve, sadly they do not offer a brewed Ice Tea which would have been perfection.  But the brisket was so good, the value so good that I couldn't take off a star for not having the perfect beverage options.  (I would have like to see some self serve onion and pickles on the side as well, in case you're listening).The place is jam packed - I suspect a few families have come together to make a go of this, it doesn't look like your typical suspects behind the counter. Seating is on crowded picnic tables inside or other picnic tables outside when the weather isn't so bad.  If they weren't a full hour away from my house, I would have just got it to go and enjoyed it at home.My goodness this is good - don't miss it.  (and get there early - their closing time is listed as \"when everything is sold\", and I suspect that isn't all that long.  Be prepared to wait a little while to get your food, you won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "xgsAWMRnOztAPz1nk3uYnA", "user_id": "yzvCcMgWhVpPlRfBdlrLGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Amazing food!

Two meats, two sides. I had brisket, ribs, bbq beans, and spicy Mac (only on Friday) all this for 19 bucks. Huge portions. Plenty to take home and I can eat. Overall it was pretty good. I can say I've had better but for Salem you won't find better brisket. Ribs were decent. I think I prefer Adams ribs. Beans were great, spicy Mac was served on the cold side. I do wish they had a better variety of sauces being a sauce guy that's one thing I look forward to when checking out bbq joints. Overall though glad to have another bbq place in Salem.

This was worth the drive from the other side of the river, through that lovely West Salem rush hour traffic, and that's saying something. My ribs were perfectly cooked--very tender with perfect pink ring. I wish they'd been a tad more flavorful. The sauce at the table helped. My wife's chopped chicken sandwich was excellent--the onion ring was a nice texture contrast. The kids shared a children's chicken strip meal, which was very generously sized. From what I saw, the menu didn't mention alcoholic beverages. It wasn't until I was ordering that I saw a large ice bucket with beer and cider. It was inconvenient having to dig through the ice to see the selection with a long line behind me. Perhaps a small sign near the register with a list?And yes, as others have noted, the line was long and slow, even at 4:30 on a Friday. I waited about 15 minutes to place my order. On the other hand, our food arrived quite promptly, in spite of the crowd. I was happy to see that most of the menu was still available when I was there. The dining room was typical BBQ picnic table style setup with western-ish decor and TVs. The lighting was pretty dim. I had a hard time seeing my food, and my vision isn't that bad."}, {"review_id": "_p1mpWvdxRWXn6_b56bd4w", "user_id": "QNpKUT6f_tdoWh94Lgg1bw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "The ribs are excellent and the brisket was good.
