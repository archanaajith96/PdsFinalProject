To be honest, most of the pan-asian restaurants in Reno are underwhelming on the friendly American style of service.  Thai Lotus seems to be the exception to that stereotype.The lighting is always a little brighter here.  No squinting or fumbling for things, so it's probably not the most \"romantic\" date night, but could easily be a great place to get food on a more casual basis but still have some ambiance and not a ton of background noise to talk over.Other points of interest.Parking is plentiful.Always have some special on the board.  Check it out when you walk in.The heat levels can sometimes be a mixed bag.  So be cautious when you order something."}, {"review_id": "T4gmS42pnsz4HiTPfYjIHw", "user_id": "PCcNwGpkii04fEad5r_DLA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "I have been coming here for about 3 years and I can honestly say that they have the best Thai food in town.

I went here on a Saturday evening and the place was packed. I ordered pad Thai chicken noodles here, and it was extremely yum and filling, the portion was very adequate.One suggestion is to not order more that a 5 on the spice scale, 1-5 is the most common here. 5+ is Thai spicy and can make you cry :pThe waitress was extremely helpful and courteous, coming  in to check on us regularly.

Last review in 2015???? Here's the good news... They haven't changed one bit since then! This is still one of my most favorite Thai restaurants in town, not only because they're incredibly consistent, but because they continue to offer a new take on Thai to all of us. It seems every time I visit I find a new dish that renews my passion for this place. They used to relegate these to the blackboard behind the register, but as of recently they've started to include them on a menu insert too. This is a great way to keep those of us that really enjoy exploring the menu from landing on our old favorites! From this menu I've ordered:Braised Beef and Tendon with Basil and Rice Noodles Thai Street Noodles topped with fried tofu, veggies, braised beef and a tangy vinegar sauceThai Braised Ribs - SEVERAL TIMESAnd many others. The menu has some hidden gems too, which are worth mentioning again:Spicy Spicy CatfishThai Lotus ChickenMassaman CurryReally, you can't go wrong here AND they handle takeout super expediently too! Now... if I could only get them to open on Sunday AND deliver. I'll take what I can get!"}, {"review_id": "t5aNlBt8iyKiibpCBquNGA", "user_id": "p6z0yLiUB9_bk19tTbtbew", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "We visited this restaurant for lunch before with family and that was good, my husband and I decided to check out their dinner.

We ordered the sampler platter which gives you four different varieties it included potstickers,  shrimp rangoon, golden rolls and curry puffs with three of each. They also bring three different sauces for use with the appetizers. They were all very tasty.We decided to try four entrees and share them family style.

The host was friendly and courteous. The decor feels authentic with many Thai style Buddhist style statues and dragon paintings. The waitresses use iPad's for your order and it's linked to your table. The result is a quick meal and all of the dishes were accurate. The food. I ordered all of my dishes 3/5 spicy. I typically prefer 4/5 spicy at most restaurants but the first time there I always get medium. The 3/5 at Thai lotus was perfect for me. It was enough spice to know it's there but not too much to overwhelm you. Pineapple curry: 5 stars. amazing dish! A complex dish of spicy, red pepper, a little bit creamy and overall wonderful curry and some sweetness from the pineapple. This was a unique dish and very tasty. Basil fried rice: 4 stars. Delicious fried rice that really hit the spot. The basil was overwhelmed by the I'm looking forward to going back to Thai lotus"}, {"review_id": "xglwOXcHscWJE5N1JZeSdQ", "user_id": "Rdro0ZXoVNh1uNW0FvccNw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "The first time I ate here(A takeout order) was about a yr ago, and I was having the biggest Flu ever, felt like I got hit by a semi twice, def didn't want to cook, hell I wouldn't even want to blink my eyes only if they wouldn't dry out.....lol ( Yea i was that sore and sick), so I placed  takeout order and picked it up and went home and ate it, it tasted awful! So I never went back there until last night. Same as last time, only I wasn't sick lol, ordered the same thing, went home, and ate it, and they all tastes great! And waitress was very friendly and polite. Then I thought to myself, I think I wrongfully judged them the 1st time, it is probably because I was very sick, and sick people can't taste anything well.   Anyway, my conclusion is that Never write a Yelp review about food when  you are sick. It's unfair to the business owner. ( Of course back then I was so sick that i didn't even bother to write about it. Which is good!)One thing to add up: I wish this place can come up with some wow factors(ex: new dishes that other Thai place doesn't have), so far this place is just like every other good Thai restaurants, and in a competitive market you DON'T want to be just like every-other-Thai-restaurants, you want to stand out. Things to try:Fresh Spring Roll(Refreshing! Healthy! Full of crunchy veggies.)Yellow Curry( Smooth texture with a hint of sweetness from coconut.)Things you might NOT want to try:Thai Lotus Chicken chefs specials ( I grew some serious jawline after eating this. I have the bite power of T-Rex now.)"}, {"review_id": "sZftst6ADPy44pjVU_wUYA", "user_id": "WHuuz1Xm8zkrUl8fAd31Eg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "First I want to qualify this as I did live in Thailand for 10 years.

We received our soup and salad right away and then about two min later we got the entree. The Tom Kha was super good! We ordered it Level 3 and that was not spicy at all. It had a small little kick but nothing anyone couldn't handle. Then we had the Lotus Salad with the Ginger sesame dressing.  Yummy!! Good portion for all of them as well. We also had the Cashew entree with chicken but I had them use the honey and ginger sauce instead of the sweet chili. That also was so yummy!! It came with a lot of veggies and meat.

We ordered our standard Thai order: Pork Larb, Beef Pad Thai and Chicken Yellow Curry plus a glass of wine, which came to $38.81. A great value!Our dinner began arriving in 3 mins, with the Larb.  It was a bit salty, perhaps with too much fish sauce. Perhaps it was because it had been a while since we'd had authentic Thai. It came with iceberg lettuce, our preferred method of transporting juicy, diced pork, ripe with mint and cilantro, to our eager mouths. Pad Thai arrived with the Curry. Both were presented well, with the saucy rice noodles of the Pad Thai perfectly cooked.  The Chicken Yellow Curry had creatively-cut carrots and potatoes, adding to the rich, coconut curry broth.

I was personally disappointed with the coloration of my red curry as it is nothing but red. It tastes soupy and lacks the real kick red curries should have. My husband is pretty happy with his Thai basil pork. All in all, anything to shout about? Hmm... not really, unless you have been seriously deprived of Thai food and do not cook with even some instant Thai pastes."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-lotus-reno?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
