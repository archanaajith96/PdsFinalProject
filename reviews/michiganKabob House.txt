I don't live in Michigan anymore, but when I come home, it's the first place I go! Their fatoush salad with feta is delicious. They give you ample garlic and bread. I also like their meat grape leaves.The restaurant is usually pretty busy and the girls who work there work really hard. The restaurant could use a makeover though."}, {"review_id": "xzs3ccoiD3EJRxPgcNmlew", "user_id": "3kkLtwXa0RhrNCEdNBlJMA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "Food is amazing. Shawarma plate is especially good. Pretty much everything I ever had here was very good.However, the service at lunchtime is s l o w. It's probably because they are so busy, being that close to the Tech Center. But there's usually a line of people waiting to get seated, another line waiting to pay, and finding parking is a challenge.If not for this, I'd give them five stars. Food is good."}, {"review_id": "ZNoNYRMZJ6oOM9Yxa2bufA", "user_id": "GZX4-dT6JIjwc3nqa6TkVA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/7/2017", "text": "Dining in is OK.Lunchtime is busy, expect some inattentive service.Could also be cleaner in general.That's it for the negative. And, that's the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5. Food, alone is 5. I've been a customer since they first opened the doors of their old location at 12 & Van Dyke.Food here is outrageously good! We moved farther east, since they first opened, and I pass 4 other Lebanese places to come here for carry-out.There's no comparison you can make with any of the other local restaurants. I've tried them.You'll have to travel out by Lakeside Mall in Sterling Hgts., and head for La Saj to get the same great quality and taste of food.We usually order the Kabob House Special for 2 , and carry-out.This combo will feed 4, no problem. Includes beef and chicken shawarma, choice of salad (we always get tabouli), rice, chicken and beef kafta, falafel, hummus, fried kibbee, grape leaves and beef kabobs with grilled vegetables. It also comes with plenty of pita bread. They package the hots in a half-pan, and the colds in styrofoam boxes. The cold foods are crisp and fresh, and the hot foods all blend together nicely in the tray/pan.When you dine-in they bring complimentary 'hot bread' to your table.We add it to our carry-out for another $1.Can't go wrong here!"}, {"review_id": "XOFlo35i69anANtHYPy4tw", "user_id": "S_hw1Bnzwz9Ekag70zQoQg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "This place has incredible food. The family platter for 1-2 ($36) will easily feed 4-5 people. It includes hummus, garlic dip, pita, grape leaves, falafel, rice, fattoush salad and an assortment of meat. Includes beef/chicken shawarma, kabob, and others! Everyone can get what they want with this deal. We love everything, but highlights for me include the creamy hummus and delicious grape leaves!"}, {"review_id": "-zCF5KGWH1OnqqiGVv2LPg", "user_id": "XwV-td_G8X9Idr_R2JX5PA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "I love eating here, the food is amazing and the prices are very affordable.

The portions here are enormous.2.) Ever since they moved across the street, business has definitely been booming. If you try to park in the lot from 11:30-1pm good luck. 3.) The deboned chicken is their special and my usual go to at this joint. But today I opted for a more nutritious option and chose the chicken fattoush salad. Look I'm not a salad guy by any means, but this salad will make you a believer. It came with too much dressing for me but at least two chicken breaths on top. And in book that's a win baby. 4.) The atmosphere is pleasant if you don't come during the lunch rush. But if you do so happen to make it here on your lunch break, expect noise and lots of it. There are people from all walks of life gathered in this one spot and they all are speaking in their native tongues loudly so that they all can hear each other. It's actual a beautiful thing to see. This food is something that everyone can agree on. And the general consensus is, that it is good indeed.5.) I'm a big guy and I always have leftovers, you are competitive eater if you don't leave this joint with out a box. Their is no better middle eastern restaurant with in 10 miles and you will get your money's worth here!"}, {"review_id": "inAR1QOmJgJ6MIwo7sielQ", "user_id": "f9x1CcRx-8V0pdr1e3Rkmg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "Look up county food violations.

Got my sammy... no rice.  Ate it, fine but not great.  No one came to check on me.  In fact when I walked in I went unnoticed for a time, then just ordered to go to the left and find a place to sit.  Not exactly welcoming.  The garlic is great and it comes as you sit down. That was the highlight.  When the waitress finally figured out I was missing my rice, she offered to bring it.  No thanks.  Baklava? No.  Uhhhh....soup?  I guess, if you are going to give me a soup to go then fine.  When you forget to bring something throughout my whole meal, then remember at the end as I have my keys in hand? Take it off the bill, people!!!  The piece de resistance is that when I added the cost of the received item to the item I got as an after-thought, the cost was less than what was printed on my bill.  \"Yeah, she gave you the combo\" I was told at the register.  Great, I didn't get a pop and when you add the items up it should be $6, not $7... The super shoddy service (which I never deduct stars for unless it is remarkably bad) coupled with the missing items, okay food, and charging me for the food they forgot rendered a 2 star result.  No thanks."}, {"review_id": "Rt4YbvGwdPWElwvnrghJ2w", "user_id": "8ZVuJdKhza0VosyNLiMmxg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Ordered food and picked up carryout sad to say food was looking great unfortunately had no utensils to eat the food it should be obvious to add utensils when you order food i called and all i  got was a im sorry not even we'll comp your next meal due to inconvenience you experienced sad to say I've been going to this location for many years new and old location ordering at least once a week for 4 years, im to busy at work to run back for some utensils probably why i do carryout,hum so and im sorry lost them a loyal customer there are many middle eastern food joints in the area guess I'll give them my business from now on."}, {"review_id": "KMx1j2V8zy2Pd04U50ga2Q", "user_id": "4f7nCO2V_8aokooTPKKrAA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "The salad, the salad dressing, the hummus...the list goes on & on.
