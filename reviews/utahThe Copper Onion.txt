I enjoy dining here for lunch and dinner whenever I have the chance. I wouldn't describe it as a \"fine-dining\" establishment, but more of a versatile venue where I feel comfortable in jeans and a nice shirt for dinner or a cute dress while I'm out on the town. I have several food allergies/intolerances (because of this, I follow a mostly Paleo dietary lifestyle) and they have always been able to accommodate my dietary needs without sacrificing flavor or quality.

The veggies included kimchi, pickled carrots, and some very juicy mushrooms. I enjoyed the poached (instead of the traditional fried) egg on top, as it was more runny and easier to mix with the rice. The sauce wasn't the typical gojuchang sauce, but still tasted great (It was more like a spicy/chipotle mayo).The fried chicken congee included a poached egg, pickled mushrooms, herbs and sesame on top. The chicken was fried to perfection - crispy on the outside and very juicy on the inside. The congee was nicely seasoned with the herbs and pickled mushrooms. I personally would like the mushroom to not be pickled as I thought the sour taste from it interfered with the congee.Overall, I was very pleased with what I ate and would definitely recommend others to go. I would suggest to make a reservation (even though we didn't wait long), but you would probably get a better table (as we had to sit under the beaming sun)."}, {"review_id": "5wPDxrV_Z1txlWQCythacA", "user_id": "a4IgqHdva08RBnEV73Qk3g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "I almost never even had my lunch here because I could not find the restaurant! It is set back from the road a bit, and the sign is easy to miss. It is located right next to Copper Common, so if you spot that sister business you will know you have arrived. Parking was okay at the time I was there, though is likely challenging during the evening.The weather was cool outside, but they have many beautiful potted plants, and in the summer I can imagine this is a stunning spot for dining al fresco. Upon entering, you will find a sort of French café inspired interior. There's not a lot of space, and I think it's best enjoyed for a tête-à-tête meal. I had a date with two girlfriends, and thankfully, we had a reservation. You can make one via the Yelp app, and I'd strongly suggest taking advantage as it was busy even at 11:30am on a Friday (lots of business lunches, and almost everyone seemed to have a delectable looking hamburger).Onto the food! I tried the following:Ricotta Dumplings - SO tender and yummy. The candied lemon peel takes them from delicious to magic.Shishito Peppers - Loved the curry sauce, but could have done with about half the salt.Carrots with feta and tapenade - Perfectly roasted and sweet. The tapenade was an unusual pairing with carrots, but it worked. These were covered in olive oil, and though it was delicious and clearly a quality oil, there could have been a lot less.Snap peas with chili oil - Not too spicy, very fresh and crunchy-tender peas, but swimming in oil too.Stracciatella Soup - Beyond the threads of egg there was little texture to this soup. It was basically creamy broth, but with an excellent meaty flavor. It should be served with bread.Cacio e pepe - Simple creamy pasta, and the green onion was a fresh foil to an otherwise rich entrée,Steak fries - These are not fries, they are potato wedges, but they are tasty and super crispy, so I won't argue particulars.Chocolate Pudding - Probably the best thing I had (and I only ate a bite!). The crushed meringue bits were a dream, and there was a little touch of something salty too...yum!White Chocolate Almond Tart - Good, simple dessert. The jam that topped it was very sweet.Our waiter was attentive, if a bit standoffish. Prices might be considered high by some, but are appropriate given the quality of food (besides my friend's steak salad, which was uninspired and small in portion size).I think what I find particularly appealing about Copper Onion is that it feels like it is not even in SLC. It reminds me of the sort of place I would have dined at for lunch or brunch in DC. It has that sort of urban sophistication without being stuffy or trying too hard. As much as I adore the setting and atmosphere, though, the food should be the first consideration, and there were only a few dishes that were perfect on their own, so this visit was 4 stars. I still loved the restaurant and hope to return for brunch and/or dinner - maybe that will denote a 5 star rating."}, {"review_id": "hslQ-Q6I_OZ10_a-_7jDsQ", "user_id": "0H2ggT37lK8hsbH8aGR1Ug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "1/17/18Apparently this is the go-to Utauian restaurant of my Snowboard Crew... well... crew of 3?... um, 1 of which is a skier (I don't hold it against him.)  But anyway, yeah, our fearless leader suggested this place and honestly, it was pretty good!  I mean, yes the food is good, but maybe not amazing *except for their pork belly!), especially given how beautiful and trendy this place is, but totally enjoyable.  Overall, it's a really great place to relax, to drink, to talk about Snow, The Mountains, and Life.They came for Park City, but I came for another great adventure with friends, snow, hot tubs, and unhindered drunken glory!  It also happened to be the week of the Sundance Film Festival, so we knew things would be interesting... (to be continued in a future review)...This night we ordered:1. Soda $2.50:  Hey, normal prices!2. Blonde Negroni $11 \"gin, salers, cocchi\":  It was sugary, slightly smokey.  Some lemon in there too.  I think it would be better less sweet, but still very good.  8/103. Kurobuta Pork Belly $13 \"charred sweet potato, pears, pumpkin seed vinaigrette\":  WOW!  Tons of different flavors here, with much herbal goodness.  The nuts added texture and there was just the right amount of sweetness.  The pork was very well cooked and super tender as you'd expect.  Oh, and I LOVED the puree sauce which was deliciously fruity.  10/104. Ballard Farm Griddled Pork Chop $26 \"mushroom ragout, creamy polenta, pepper jam, poached egg\":  It was cooked okay, and more moist than dry.  Not perfect doneness though.  Could use more flavor too, though very pretty.  The polenta was creamy and yummy though.  7/105. Snake River Farms Teres Major Steak $33 \"pomesco, confit red cabbage, smoked potatoes, scallion\":  Well, it was cooked very well (just check out the beautiful red colors in my pics.)  But strangely, it felt a bit dry despite that.  Again, a tangy puree, which you wouldn't expect with steak but totally works.  Potatoes were boring unfortunately, as was the corned beef-style boiled cabbage.  7/106. Wagyu Beef Straganoff $23 \"Snake River Farms beef, house pappardelle, mushroom, creme fraiche, chive\":  This was our fearless leader's favorite, and go-to every time she comes here.  The fresh pasta was perfect, as was the sauce.  Noodles were thick with perfect texture, between the typical over-soft of fresh noodles, and the hardness of dried pasta.  Perfect.  Unfortunately the beef was a bit stringy, and I'm not sure being wagyu made any difference at all.  So, the \"wagyu\" part was a bit of a oversell.  8/107. Wasatch Polygamy Porter Nitro 12oz 6.0% ABV $7:  They actually had Goose Island Bourbon County Coffee for $26 on their menu!!!  Trust me, it took everything I could muster NOT to order than instead (but for whoever does, I'm jealous of you!)  Anyway, this Polygamy I thought was just okay, though apparently this would be one of the craft beers to be proud of for Utah.  It was like a stronger Guinness, but with the same wateriness and some bitter bite (the latter not in a bad way).  6/108. Chocolate Pudding $9 \"Solstice dark milk chocolate, vanilla whip, malted milk meringue, dark chocolate cake\":  This would be one of those everything-we-know-how-to-make-in-a-cup type desserts, but does taste good.  The pudding is super rich and decadent.  Love the cookies.  Unfortunately the cake tastes strangely rubbery with the pudding, though by itself where the two didn't make contact the cake was pretty good.  Overall this collage worked well.  8/10Like I said, the food was closer to 4/5, but I did love being here, so...5/5(adventure to be continued...)#utah #snowboard #parkcity #saltlakecity #american"}, {"review_id": "YLumKzQ3lWZoeJwBa5jvJw", "user_id": "oNII0l8kb83PbqGzDN4yCA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Super cute spot!

The pasta is homemade. The kitchen is open, which I like. Having worked in restaurants, I appreciate it when guests can see into the kitchen because I feel like it keeps the kitchen accountable.

The flavor of the roasting pan, the saltiness of the capers and anchovy aioli, made cauliflower one of the sexiest vegetables on the menu.Braised Octopus was über tender, flavorful, and the pickled onions and smoked potatoes were a great compliment to the main event, and SO delicious. The chili is an integral part of this dish, and my mouth felt it. I shared some with the couple next to me, and we all agreed that the heat will be a huge hit with those who love a bit of spice. Cacio e Pepe. You tell me, was it delicious? Don't be ridiculous, of course it was delicious! What'sa mattah whichuh??? LOL.

Someone suggested the Copper Onion as we were in walking distance so we decided to head over and give it a shot. When we got there, there was about an hour wait but they took our name and cell to text us when our table was ready. There is a room off the bar where you can grab drinks and hang out until your table is ready. We ordered some appetizers for the table - asparagus, steak fries, beets and sautéed mushrooms. The asparagus came with a delicious bearnaise sauce as breadcrumbs which added a lovely texture. The beats were dressed with pistachios which added a nice crunch. The steak fries were perfectly cooked and the mushroom dish was a table favorite. For dinner I went with the scallops - this was served with pork belly, pickled mushrooms, and xo sauce. It was so delicious. A little on the smaller side but I really enjoyed it. The downfall to this mean was the homemade ice cream. They really get experimental with their flavors we ordered two and one came on the house - orange caramel, banana curry and orange sorbet. Personally I did not like them nor did the group I was with.

Whatever sauce they use in the burger is to die for. We were dipping the steak fries in it when we were done! The bread pudding was served on a skillet and was so yummy!

Four words I would use to describe my affection for the Copper Onion. New American cuisine is rapidly expanding its presence in the culinary world but few accurately balance the fusion of international flavors and luxurious local sourcing. The current menu accomplishes just that, impeccable creations such as Hong Kong rooted XO sauce with fried delicate squash or the airy duck liver mousse with firm asiago cheese atop lightly toasted artisanal bread (see picture). I highly recommend the Kurobuta Pork Belly (see picture) with its savory heritage pork texture that is lightly softened by a sweet pear puree. An inventive creation with strong, yet enhanced, resemblance of pork chops and apples. We also enjoyed the Braised Lamb Shank and the Snake River Teres Major Steak. The teres major cut is second only to tenderloin filets in tenderness and was truly magnificent. Cooked to a perfect medium rare temperature and bursting with natural beef flavor. The steak is accompanied by lightly smoked potatoes and tender red cabbage. Overall, the food experience was overwhelmingly delightful but I was left yearning for stronger knowledge from our server. He appeared distracted and lacking of passion when it came to describing the dishes.
