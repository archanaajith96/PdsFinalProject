Arrived early for breakfast with hubs, around 830/9am. We were seated right away at the bar. But it's a small place so I'd recommend coming early or else you might have to wait.  Everyone is incredibly friendly, and service is attentive and fast.  It's your typical greasy spoon diner but everything is really well done, satisfying and portions are huge. We started off with one of their muffins (grilled which meant toasted and warmed). Highly recommend. They are very tasty. Kind of like corn bread. The special they had was the Tres Lesches which was delish because it came with a three milks sauce to dunk.  The muffin was very top heavy; the top being crumbed. I didn't try this part too much but the body was very yum. I then had the meal that included: silver dollar pancakes (warning. These are fluffy huge size pancakes; I could only eat a slither), eggs of your choice (got a wet scramble), bacon (They only give you two strips of your meat choice - which was fine by me but just fyi), and hashbrowns, which are shredded - my fave. You can upgrade to \"hobo\" style which is with onion, jalapeno and cheese (I opted out of the cheese). My husband got an option that came with eggs (perfect done sunnys, he said), sausage (not the gross shrunken kind), and rye toast.Highly recommend for an early breakfast to start off the day and taking a seafood break. Many people were eating the fluffy pancakes."}, {"review_id": "yHZrypv92kpOHNPOBb2lyw", "user_id": "q8V8MDINpPmPg_0STAsDSw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Highly recommend Man I really enjoy eating here when I'm up in Portland. It's a bummer this place is so small, so sometimes you have to hunker down and wait. I really enjoy the grilled muffins. I never seem to get there before raspberry sells out though - so I've only ever tried the blueberry. It's real good. I've had both their savory and sweet breakfasts. They cook eggs perfectly IMO. No where ever seems to get the cook right on my eggs - but I made my order - specified that it's a little different from the norm - and BAM perfect eggs. I tried the loaded hashbrowns, and while they were good, I think in the future I'll just get the regular hash browns. The pancakes are GIANT. The \"silver dollar\" pancakes take up an entire side plate. Be prepared. Only main bummer is the last time I was there I was overcharged (charged for two muffins when I only ordered and got one) but didn't notice until later. Will that stop me from returning? No way. I'm assuming it was an accident and probably not normal, I just recommend you give the check a close once over."}, {"review_id": "r7NWGPB5AddjMI9rkHgg1Q", "user_id": "GjwNvbKdTk31880J9MZ7wA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I've been wanting to visit this diner ever since the notorious controversy happened a couple years back (Darla is my hero) and experience the place for myself. Since I was in South Portland at a convention and visiting family, my mom and I decided that it was high time we tried Marcy's Diner. We showed up this past Sunday morning around 8:30 am and were greeted when we walked in by a cool yet polite guy and groovy music like Stevie Wonder and other upbeat tunes of yore. The cool dude promptly seated us at the counter and the dedicated, energetic waitstaff got our beverage order in moments. For food, my mom got the Crustless Quiche (Ham, Broccoli, and Cheese, I believe) and a colorful side salad, since she's trying to be as ketogenic as possible. I ordered D from the \"Favorites\" menu which included eggs, NY Strip Steak, toast (I opted for an English muffin), and hash browns. Oh my goodness...it was all so good. The steak (ordered Medium Rare) was just the right amount of pink and so juicy! The hash browns were a little like mashed potatoes but they were seasoned just right and the sunny-side up eggs were just runny enough that I could soak them up with my English muffin and hash browns. It was so substantial and stuck to my ribs so well that I barely wanted lunch or dinner later on! The only thing I will say as a word of caution is that it's probably best to go solo or just with one other person, since groups of 3 or more had a little bit more of a wait, but between the wait staff that could put the Energizer bunny to shame and the nice greeter/cashier guy, everything was running smoothly like a well-oiled machine.What I liked the most definitely was how much the staff seemed to support one another and had an enviable amount of synergy. The dishwasher seemed like a new hire and was a little nervous, but the cool guy and the other waitstaff had his back and were giving him tips and encouragement every step of the way. I wish I had that much moral support at any job I've had! The waitress we had most of the time was so funny and had us laughing even at that early hour and took the time to get us a Marcy's Diner shirt (we usually don't get souvenirs but the bacon and eggs in skull and crossbones formation was just a hoot), never once making us feel like a bother. Darla was a delight even though I didn't get to say anything to her since she was busy cranking out breakfast. She was just cooking away merrily, grooving to music in her pom pom hat and Hawaiian shirt, and looked like she was having the time of her life.I would go again in a heartbeat and I feel that a trip to the Portland area isn't complete without a trip to Marcy's Diner!"}, {"review_id": "bEL0hzBg9msN2o0QHdjs_A", "user_id": "hJY2NHWV6BA5Gd6kks6NPg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Awesome people, great food, very family and budget friendly place!  A PortlandTopTen.

Saw that it was cash only and once we placed our orders, had to walk to the ATM across from Nosh to get some cash. Not that big of a deal, but wish they accepted credit because that was a hassle. (It was worth it!)We were told before we sat down that they were short staffed and only serving the front page of the menu, but the guy said \"Don't worry, it's all the good stuff\", and he was right. Ordered two banana walnut pancakes, hash browns, eggs, and sausage. Pancakes- delicious. So generous with the walnuts and banana. Hash browns and sausage were excellent. I don't like eggs so I passed them off to my partner. I can't even remember what he ordered because I was too busy stuffing my face. Service was great, the coffee was never ending and I probably had 3 cups. Took a little while to get our food but we didn't mind, there was only one person cooking and we weren't in a rush.

We came in around 8:30 on Sunday. There was thankfully a seat open so we didn't have to wait at all. Once we sat down our waitress came over to introduce herself. We took a look over the menu and decided to get blueberry pancakes and Cap'n Crunch coated French toast. The waitress warned us that the pancakes were big and she wasn't lying lol. The food came out relatively fast and they played good music throughout our time there. The blueberry pancakes were delicious and had plenty of blueberries in them. The Cap'n Crunch French toast was amazing. If you have a sweet tooth I suggest you try it. We were here for about 30 minutes. The total was about $20 for two pancakes, two French toast, coffee and a side of bacon. Not bad!

There is definitely a locals feel to this place, which is a good and a bad thing. The good: they know many customers by name and what they will order.  The bad: if you're not a local you catch yourself looking around trying not to miss anything that's happening. We only come here on snow days to ensure that there won't be a wait. It has paid off for us during the last 4 visits. But rumor has it that the wait could get pretty lengthy especially on the weekends. The service deserves 5 stars. The staff will greet you once they see your hand on the handle to open the door. You will be served, refilled, and checked on by any and all of the people behind the counter. They always have specials written on the board, we always give those a try.  Depending on how busy they are or the time of day, they will run out of certain items. The muffins they serve are homemade. You have the choice to get it grilled with butter or plain. Today we had cinnamon chip, we wouldn't get it again. We got it grilled (strongly suggest) but it was still a bit dry. We should have stuck to our normal blueberry muffin. The omelette special for today was pesto chicken. It was tasty, but doesn't compare to the garlic chicken omelette special that they have from time to time. Our favorite part of the meal is definitely the hash browns, order them well done, trust me. **Marcy's is cash only**"}, {"review_id": "FjbFkU6xmNSFdVN8HFo_FA", "user_id": "dCTle2T66d6mtoXeEOCQdg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "Small downtown diner with all your favorite diner classics, good service, and since its Maine, a killer blueberry muffin.  While not in a diner car, the ambiance is still pretty old school and there are lots of great tchotchkes to admire while you wait.  The food is solid, don't expect much culinary innovation, but they do good breakfast at pretty reasonable prices.  The coffee, like most diners, isn't great.  I know that's usually expected, but Portland is a great coffee city and I was hoping that carried over to diners."}, {"review_id": "_ofbZ7ov_eaVJ2CdWERBfA", "user_id": "oiPutLXa5YpxcdLUMLyHjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/30/2017", "text": "I wish Marcy's was located in our home town!  We absolutely loved it here!!  Small, modern type diner located in beautiful Portland Maine.  A very fun upbeat place to be with a variety of music blasting in the background.

They don't need butter, but I liked them even more with it. I especially liked the raspberry muffin. For my meal I had the E1 (2 slices French toast, 2 eggs, bacon and home fries) with a coffee.
