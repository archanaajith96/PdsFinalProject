I got held to my statement, so Little Star Pizza it was.We got the half and half deep dish-- half old school with pepperoni, olives, and onions, and half little star, which is a combo with spinach and mushrooms.It arrived piping hot. The top was smothered in fresh-tasting diced and sorta wilted tomatoes, which made it a bit hard to tell the difference between the two flavors. I liked the cheese on this-- not that pungent, but perfectly stringy and made you feel like they were using real ingredients. The dough was super soft and the cornmeal crust was a nice change of scenery-- a bit crunchy for my tastes, with slight grittiness from the cornmeal. A 9\" would be sufficient for two moderately hungry people.As with all other foods, I tend to eat my layers separately so I can actually taste the ingredients. All were high quality. There was a decent amount of toppings on this. A 3.75/5 for me."}, {"review_id": "Pq28MCfsuZrOL-pkPblD1w", "user_id": "lP2v3zYQRGFHSm5Na8NFUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Best deep dish pizza I have had in a long time and I lived in Chicago. Rating based on bi-weekly delivery, so this does rating does not reflect the restaurant dining experience.  This is a thin crust deep dish crust, to be clear this does not mean that it is a light pizza. This is a rich golden crust has the perfect exterior crunch and touches of \"cheese caramel\". This is the best way to describe the bits of cheese that get toasted into the edges of the crust. We order the pepperoni and onion & the meatball and onion.The meatball has a pile of herbed ricotta on top on each large slice. The cheese base is the perfect pull apart texture, with lots of cheese. The sauce has big chunks of juicy tomato's that add just the right amount of sweet and acidic and can cut through the cheese and rich crust. Meatballs are flavorful and savory. Delivery is consistently good, I have yet to be disappointed.I also noticed they can cater to most dietary restictions"}, {"review_id": "DSzpWlz_A_3QbHmssCCmvA", "user_id": "flAu3ZECcLrsoYg7hy4EDg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "I ordered to go from here, so I can't say much about the restaurant, but the people I spoke to on the phone and when I got there were both very friendly. It is a very small restaurant, but they have a nice sign out front so you know where to find it.I ordered deep dish from here because it seems to be what they were known for. I have a very deep love for deep dish, so I was interested in seeing their take on it.I got the small deep dish with bacon, italian sausage, and goat cheese. The small was enough for me eat on for a couple of days. The crust didn't get soggy because of the toppings and had a nice crunch. The tomato sauce  flavored nicely and there wasn't too much so it didn't override all of the toppings I added. I wish I had the stomach to finish it in one sitting. I would like to come back here when I am in San Francisco again to try one of their specialty pizzas."}, {"review_id": "wldeWcSAINgAywPK8I1J0A", "user_id": "rZhUpPwiTDO5CFdbfhr8qQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "This pizza is bomb. I got: Large BYO Thin Cheese Pizza w/ pepperoni & pineapple (yes, I'm one of those people. Let's move on) - the thin pizza is SUPER thin, but it works! The dough is really fresh, and the perfect balance of chewy, crispy, and savory.The tomato sauce portion was restrained (not sloppy) and was just the right amount of tart, with visible pieces of actual tomato throughout. The pepperoni was crispy and the cheese was spread both under and over the pepperoni, which was a surprising and delicious detail.Overall, this pizza is really fresh, savory without being greasy, and really well-priced for SF & the portion/quality."}, {"review_id": "eMs0sG5CFr-XShzwZoybXQ", "user_id": "IcCUSVBmdfR0Pp-OIGkhaA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/1/2017", "text": "We chanced upon Little Star Pizza thanks to Yelp. This place definitely deserves its stars. We tried the Meateor 2.0 with a thin crust. The meat and the rest of the ingredients were delicious. The crust was just so thin that it served as a plate for the rest of the ingredients. The crust was not crunchy but firm. I am really impressed with the pizza. The ambience is cool. A jukebox in one corner, a few arcade machines around, and some cool artwork on the walls. Pretty eclectic and artistic vibe. Basically, this is a great pizza joint. Quite easily the best pizza I had in SF. It is best suited for a casual night out."}, {"review_id": "CnUzynq_vqajodGw8dhlOw", "user_id": "Z3-JwNXKpBAmcGWNH4tdJA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/22/2017", "text": "My husband and I came here for lunch on Saturday! it is definitely a hole in the wall type of place. Wooden tables inside, a bit dark. Clean and friendly environment. We were seated quickly and given our menus! We had ordered the breadsticks for appetizers, and the breadsticks were soooooo good! delicious! Then we ordered a small meaty pizza that was good as well! however next time I think I would probably like to try another one. They didn't have any ranch which was a bummer and I was sad! (that's why i'm giving a 4 star)  and my husband told me to get over it because it masks the taste the pizza so whatever haha. I LOVE their rootbeer, they give you a nice frozen glass, with a proper rootbeer bottle! and I love their dark brown straws. Seriously the best rootbeer I have ever had. Their small is 6 slices, so if there is two of you or even 3 it is good enough size, if you order deep dish they are quite filling! The customer service was good. Bathrooms were clean, however no toilet seat covers, so..squat it like it's hot! Overall, loved the food. Would defiantly go again!"}, {"review_id": "ZaNOzK4vnP4exZurznF-ZQ", "user_id": "kiwVPQ9jh2UIQn1sRes03A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Yes!

We were sat down quickly on a Thursday night, even though it was pretty crowded. We ordered 2 pizzas:- Margherita - we chose the thin crust. Well done  - Pollo - chicken in a deep dish and it tasted grand after eating the simple Margherita  There were whole garlic pieces (yes!) and the cheese stretches like no other. The deep dish takes about 20-30 min to cook but that's how much restaurants take to make food at times anyway. We also had a spring salad before the pizza to balance it with more fiber.

Solid pizza... I got the Little Star with spinach, onion, garlic etc. Even though the menu said DD only they made it for me on GF crust. The toppings were high quality and delicious. They mentioned this was the most popular pizza. The gluten free crust was just ok...definitely not the best I've ever had. Tony's GF pizza is for sure better. BUT this pizza still hit the spot and when you can't get all the way to North Beach this is still a solid choice. Even my non-gf husband and brother enjoyed the pizza a lot!I have Celiac so I always check on the cross contamination situation. They use the same oven for all pizzas but assured me they try to keep everything separate and use a cooking sheet under the gf pizza in the oven. I didn't get sick. Also, I ordered this pizza to go (for pick up), and it was ready as soon as my husband walked in the door to get it! I literally thought he may have stolen the pizza he walked out so fast ;)"}, {"review_id": "DTY7Uidayav6lL6OlFlnZg", "user_id": "Afyt7DpYyw9IT2jdCtPdlQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "I can not, not give this place 5 stars.

This is some of my favorite pizza in SF. It's deep dish but the cornmeal crust really sets it apart, its crunchy on the outside and soft inside and really really good. I like to order it with meatballs (delicious) and/or ricotta (small dollops on each slice so don't expect it to melt into the pizza like ricotta often does). The wings are pretty good although fairly spicy and the salads and other items are alright. But the real star (no pun intended) here is the pizza so definitely order that. They do a good job of packaging it for take out and delivery so it stays hot and doesn't get soggy which is an added plus. Prices are perhaps slightly higher than other pizza joints but each slice is pretty filling and the ingredient quality seems high. Definitely 5 stars from me."}, {"review_id": "ud_uAy8Aa9zRpz-a2HSWeg", "user_id": "ES12kMOR5fdoEnSXvxE0qw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "I ordered a large thin cheese pizza with double Kalamata olives.
