Interesting selection. Not such a great part of town. Prices are moderate, which since it's an iffy part of town doesn't win as well as if it had been cheaper. Take out available. Personally I'd prefer takeout from here. It's not an upscale place to sit down and eat with your family.  But to that end I'd have loved it not thinking about cleanliness. Now I know cleanliness can make or break a place but I freely admit that if a Mexican place is too upscale I lose confidence in its authenticity... I tried the empanadas bc I love empanadas from my time in South America. I saw someone eating fajitas and was impressed at how good they looked. We also had a few other more mainstream offerings. All were very tasty. All in all I liked it. I'd go back. But I'd prefer takeout to eating in."}, {"review_id": "4DD1lt7g1P4zqN3qtsv3_g", "user_id": "k74mdgq647d8-Kn5X--j0g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/14/2017", "text": "No frills to get in the way of this authentic Mexican eatery. Cheap AND amazing is the best recipe!I had the guarache, a thick tortilla filled with beans, cheese, avocado, tomato, sour cream, and onions. The menu is super helpful since there were items - like the guarache - that I didn't know about. It was fabulous in every way and humongous; I was too happy to save half for lunch the next day!My husband had an equally-ginormous veggie burrito. They are very accommodating to veg and include that option on the menu! Wtg!!Ok ok -- and I may have had a chocolate-filled churro and I may have used my finger to clean chocolate off the plate. #sorrynotsorry"}, {"review_id": "Wwlb4XGsG_RLdK7N8hDJ_A", "user_id": "nr3pW_Y7n94NHdUleBQpSw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "This place is legit.

Located on Rockingham Road across the street from the cemetary, there were no lights or obvious signage to guide us and it took a few minutes to ensure we were in the right place. When we did pull into the parking lot, it was clear that Nally's was bustling. The line to order was almost out the door. We chose our food, paid the cashier, then had a seat in the dining room.I picked a guarache and a beef empanada and I REALLY liked both items. A guarache is a cross between a soft taco and a quesadilla. Mine came with cheese, pork, avocado, and lettuce. It was excellent. The empanada was fresh, hot, and well seasoned. At $2, this was a pretty good deal and I could see myself returning for the empanadas alone. Nally's has great horchata. I didn't try the churros, but I'm really interested in doing so sometime!I'm glad we tried Nally's Kitchen this weekend! This was truly triumph of Yelp, as I would have never found or tried this place were it not for this website. The service at Nally's Kitchen was good, the restaurant was clean, and the food was delicious. I would recommend it to anyone!"}, {"review_id": "3iu5yE_GHMyq6UjtONouew", "user_id": "13DGsw3MHEurWTImpnGh2g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/5/2017", "text": "Just had Nallys for about the 20th time and it's  perfection as always.

If you needed another drink during your visit, the expectation is that you get back up to order and pay for it. The food was decent, but we did have an enchilada plate, one was a cheese enchilada and the cheese inside was cold and not melted. The rice was as if it was sitting all day waiting to be served. I wasn't too impressed with the empanadas either, the beef tasted like generic store bought taco seasoning.

I love hole in the wall restaurants! However, I was very disappointed. I came with my two kids. My son had nachos, my daughter had beef tacos and I had a beef taco salad. We waited an hour for our food! Luckily,  we had chips and salsa to hold us over. We really liked the salsa. When we finally got our food, my daughter took one bite and told me to taste the meat. It tasted just like we make at home with store bought taco seasoning. That was disappointing! If I'm paying to go out to eat, I expect it to be better than what I make at home. My taco salad was mostly lettuce and my son's nachos were cold and looked like cheese whiz from a can. The churro was decent enough.

I am here for you!!!!! I've been meaning to check this place out for a few months but just never took the jump. Let me just say that this is my new go to for all things Mexican food (except rice, could have been timing that day it just opened but it wasn't soft enough for my preference). The tostada- amazing. Chicken tacos? Delicious. My made to order churro? Bye Felicia. Incredible. Didn't make it out of the parking lot...it just happened to accidentally on purpose fall into my mouth...And I liked it ;-) The empanadas were equally as fresh and tasty. Davenport deserves more good and authentic places like this. We've tried at least 5-6 other Mexican restaurants in the area and nothing has compared to the love that they put into their food here. I can't say enough good things about this little spot. We have only ordered take out from here and it's not some place that is there to be cute and about ambience. They are focused on providing a great product and they do just that. We can't wait to try more items from the menu.

The carnitas were excellent!! I loved the pico, it complemented the pork perfectly. 3 tacos each with added beans and rice plus the drinks were only around $18. Great prices! I would probably skip the beans and rice next time, nothing special and the tacos filled us up.

They also were not bad but were made Mexican style not Puerto Rican. I also had the Guacamole and it was made fresh but it was not good. It was basically \"pico de gallo\" with some avocado in it. One could not taste the avocado in it. The onions in it were way to much and personally, I'm not used to even having onions in guacamole.Simply put, if you go for the items that are typically Puerto Rican, you will be disappointed because they are made Mexican style. The people are very friendly so, I will try them out again but I will stick to the traditional Mexican dishes. I will report back on how that turns out."}, {"review_id": "jjFUUpkwROQno2BWmzVoTQ", "user_id": "MWSOcrhZ2B7F8TJZ7woP6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/28/2016", "text": "Fresh real Mexican food for GREAT prices!
