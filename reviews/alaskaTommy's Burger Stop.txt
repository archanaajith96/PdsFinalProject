Today, I decided to try it out, and I was overwhelmed with flavors. My friend got one of their specials - the Bob-B-Q and I got the Sweet Charlotte with jalapeños (since I always crave something spicy) with Red Light - a house sauce they have - on the side. And I have to say, the food is amazing. This has to be one of the best burger joints here in Anchorage! They have a creative selection on their menu, take time to craft your burgers, and have friendly, helpful employees. It isn't as cheap as fast food places are, but you're paying for the great taste, quality, and size. Definitely fulfilling and delicious. I know for a fact that I'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "eiwk-D7OrVOiFBtZauKIxw", "user_id": "L0A50Gg6yWohQLLSST29HA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Don't mess around. Get a burger.

This place was tiny, only a couple people were inside, yet we still waited 45 min for our 2 sandwiches. My husband had  the halibut Po boy and I got the chicken teriyaki philly. Mine was definitely the better of the 2. My husband loves halibut but just thought it was ok. Food itself was good, staff was friendly.. 3 stars for the wait, the price (we thought it was overpriced).Quirky little place which is fun, but definitely not for bigger groups to dine in. 4 tables total, so take it to go!"}, {"review_id": "y57EdSB7xlCtL1Tq22pAuQ", "user_id": "d4qxGfyrHWWUFEuH8JkCOg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Thanks To The Yelp App We Found A New Favorite Place For Burgers When We Are In Town From Soldotna.

The burger menu is robust. There's phillys and po boys on the menu too! Prices are kind of high because you pay for fries and soda separately. I went with the halibut po boy with a side of onion rings. 2 people who love to eat could share this and I rarely believe that. It's huge and delish! Big cuts of halibut with just enough sauce and lettuce fixin's. But the bread steals the show...not too soft and not too crusty. Onion rings were good. I didn't get to fully enjoy them cause I was mowing down on my sandwich and before I knew it I needed to unbutton my top pant button.It's a hole in the wall for sure. Blink and you may miss the small red building. We waited for about 30 minutes for take out but we're told before ordering what wait times were. I got the impression that you can order ahead of time but don't know for sure. Seating is limited. Maybe 4 booths inside and then some tables outside. Atmosphere is unique and consist of hole in the wall decor. Robots, Star Wars, Mardi Gras beads, license plates. Just enough to make you smile. Despite the exterior, it's pretty clean inside. Can't wait to visit next time I'm in anchorage."}, {"review_id": "QjHO50sG3Yxygtj5W5iu_g", "user_id": "3eQohX5deTMVOV-IePbcgA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/2/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I'm updating my review to help new folk experience the Tommy Burger Stop! Specifically, those in a burger funk that want to try something new but can't read a menu or want to be told what to do by a stranger. I'm not a food connoisseur, I just love good food - and this place has plenty of it. If you like barbecue sauce, onion rings and, crispy cheese, then try the Gun Slinger. Wait!- You like pineapple & barbecue sauce? Get the Aloha Burger but, add some pizazz with the addition of BBQ sauce. You are a hungry beast and want bacon, meat and cheese with caramelized veggies - get the RLE burger or philly. Are you hungrier than a beast? add an egg. Are you a classy person who loves bacon cheese burgers and nothing else? Get a bacon cheeseburger. Want all that with a fried over easy egg? Mmmm - get the Spenard burger. Do you want a basic burger with veggies and some mayo? Burger Stop Burger. Like avocado? Sweet Charlotte. Are you a vegetarian or feeling like one? Black bean burger. Want spice? Get the papa d burger but sub in the black bean patty. Where's dessert? There are delicious cream pie slices in the fridge (my fav is the Cajun Delight) if you drink soda - grab a bottle or get a bottomless cup. Ooooor get a milk shake in your very own red solo cup.Oh and the French fries/onion rings are awesome. For those of you that want nothing more than spontaneous living, every week there is a special featured - get that. TLDR: this place is my absolute favorite place. Had a good week? Tommys. Had a bad week? Tommys. Got fired? Tommys. Do yourself a favor and visit this place. Oh - btw, maybe you should call to check on the wait time."}, {"review_id": "ZJBHAGjKx1ZXIXAPATJw8w", "user_id": "bwW54gi5-0aB3UM-ya0S0Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "Not really sure how people people consider these burgers the best in town, because they definitely are far from it. I ordered the blue cheese burger today and it was extremely dry and flavorless. I didn't even taste any blue cheese until I had eaten about half of the burger. The burger had an odd taste to it, like the meat had been sitting out too long or something? The fries were dry, bland, and hard like they had been cooked yesterday and left out all night. I have been counting down the days until quickie burger opens, I caved on trying one of these burgers and was instantly not impressed and it did not give me the burger fix I have been craving."}, {"review_id": "deZGYpNHSAjHU8r3cK-GUQ", "user_id": "iV2eVIsFvqtecdKjOO3shQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "This place is so damn unapologetically good.You want to watch your cholesterol?

I was totally delighted in finding this place in Spenard. I love this place, the food is excellent and I gave it a five star rating because honestly deserves it. The place is a little quirky, but it is a fun place to eat at, and great atmosphere, and they go out of your way to make you feel comfortable, Personally I think they make the best handcrafted burgers in Anchorage and the portions are large. You will not go away hungry. And as they say Keep Spenard Weird... Even though I am from Anchorage originally, and now live in Seward, I am looking forward to another trip home and back to Tommy's for a great burger."}, {"review_id": "bpxNMO3c3fs73R8fKqnEWQ", "user_id": "k_PehP_j7cNtB9UEYHu0wg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "The area is a bit sketchy, the wait was a bit long and there wasn't a lot of seating room, BUT was a dang good burger worth the wait."}, {"review_id": "D1tYYejfIcNoCDMEB7uPJg", "user_id": "zEVoqu49i_45iOOIPXac1A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "Omg.

Three months in Alaska and I've finally tried the burger stop everyone is talking about. I wish I could give a better review! I really do. Here are my top pros and cons for this place. First, the area is super sketchy. I came here with my 6 year old son after the sun had gone down. (This is not the greatest idea ive ever had) it's in a parking lot that contains a liquor store, but opens to an alleyway on both sides with the street behind you. So have your head on a swivel. There is no shortage of creepiness or creepy people meandering about the lot. It's a small place, which wasn't a downside. It added to the ambiance of the place and really gives that small business feel everyone likes so much. Service is great. They cooked our food to order and it wasn't too expensive, but I didn't expect it to be $34 for three meals and a soda. The problem lies mostly in my food. When we got home we realized my burger was PINK and cold in the middle. (I'm pregnant so This isn't safe at all for me) Just mine. Which was actually one of an identical pair of children's burgers. I couldn't imagine how grossed out I'd be if I was a kid. In that one bite I got a huge amount of salt. My husband agreed to share his double burger stop cheeseburger with me. That was even saltier. All three of us had extremely bad headaches after finishing and really rotten guts in the middle of the night. I'm not sure yet if I'll go back, but if I do I'm aiming for the fries. They had barely any salt and were covered in cheese. Right up my alley. I'll also go while the sun is still shining. Maybe if it was earlier in the day it would taste different. At this point it's sad to say I do not currently suggest this place to anyone."}, {"review_id": "K5WQWxC01Ls8Z4G3yiU3PQ", "user_id": "ZjtIyvR0LDTo4rx4C0ZEgw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/16/2017", "text": "Fantastic little of a burger joint.
