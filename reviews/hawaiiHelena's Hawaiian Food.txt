I still dream about it... They have weird hours so watch out for that but I'm just gonna talk about the food because that's all that matters.Kalua Pork- ok I had a lot of kalua pork on this trip but this was definitely the juiciest, most flavorful one. Helena's wins.Fried Butterfish Collar- So tender and buttery??? Omfg and the skin was crispy too... they know... this was a contestant for my favorite.Short Ribs- SO. THICK. its like the thickness of a medium-rare steak it's... insane I've never had anything like it before. They give you pink salt to pair with it and it's cooked to perfection I can't.We also ordered rice, the macaroni salad, and it comes with onions and haupia. So!!!

Nothing to go out of your way for.* Fried Butterfish Collar ($6) - 4.5 starsThe surprise winner! Very moist meat that just slides apart. Deliciously crispy skin.* Small Poi ($3.50) - 2.5 starsDefinitely an acquired taste. This was too fermented and was the only thing we didn't finish. * Macaroni Salad ($2.50) - 3 starsThis was fine. Nothing to complain or rave about.* Rice $1.25 - 4 starsEven though it's just plain rice, I really appreciated the texture.

I did really like the food here though. Here's a breakdown of the food:Pipikaula short ribs: my favorite dish. This was seasoned well and charred nicely. The meat was very hearty. Kalua pig: also really good. This was like pulled pork. It was smoky, and tasted even better with the onion and Himalayan sea salt. Haupia: nice dessert that is kind of like coconut flavored panacotta/jello. Poi: this is mashed taro. It was a little sour, and I wasn't a big fan. An acquired taste I think. Fried butterfish collar: good flavor and the fish was juicy. The skin is left on and was a bit difficult to chew, but it definitely gives it more flavor. Laulau: pork wrapped in taro leaf. Tasted kind of like a meat version of Greek dolmades. The leaf is a little bitter.

Now that says it all! What more can I say but, \"The people have spoken.\" Yes, Helena's deserves that title! I can agree. It's been a long time since I've eaten at Helena's. Probably, the last time I ate here was when I was a little girl. Back then, they were in a teeny tiny place somewhere in Kalihi. Well, now that I'm older and they have relocated since then. I'm glad to have returned many years later.I had the pleasure to dine here with my family on a Friday afternoon. Boy, was it...PACKED! The parking lot was crazy, waiting outside was crazy and dining inside was crazy! There were a lot of tourists and locals swarming  this eatery. Although, it was busy, we were lucky to find a parking spot in their limited lot and we were lucky to get a table.After we parked, I headed inside to put my name on the waitlist. The man who took my name was very funny. He started joking around with me. I felt like I knew him. He really made me feel like family. Now, that's what I call good service! He told me the wait would be 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, low and behold we were called by him. As he walked us to our table, he started joking around with us again. Lol!Let's get down to business...Here is what I ordered:Side order of: SQUID LUAU-so ono ono ono! Creamy, tasty and smokey flavor. I loved it. Tasted very authentic. KALUA PIG- de-LISH! You can tell that it was made with love! I never had kalua pig that tasted like it just came out of the imu! Kalua pig from the imu only can be found at a family luau...not at a restaurant. It was the best I've ever had from a Hawaiian Food restaurant. I'm not kidding. My hubs ordered a combo plate that came with HELENA'S famous pipikaula short ribs which he so graciously shared with me. Omg!!! These pipikaula is da' winnaz! As soon as my teeth sunk into those ribs, it was love at first bite! It was the best I ever had! It had just the right amount of seasoning and smokey flavor. Yum, yum,yum. I want more!!!Our meals came with a complimentary plate of raw onions with alae salt and a slice of haupia. The haupia was delicious! Yum yum.So, if you are in the mood for some great authentic Hawaiian Food, go and check out HELENA's. You'll thank me for that!"}, {"review_id": "s_aqMiDwQhv4y5SsYl1Alw", "user_id": "Ao8ahVBhXOwRdj0bAkyMcA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We sought out Helena's due to the reviews and I was not disappointed ... reasonable prices for the great local-style food quality give this place 5 Stars and the dinner crowd supported this!

Go to Hula Grill along with the Waikiki tourists.

Ever since I saw the Pipikaula Short Ribs on the Travel Channel with Adam Richman, it has been etched in my mind. Of course I was excited as well for the other stuff but short ribs are the ultimate for me when it comes to beef.Then that day came, when they brought out the ribs about to place it on the table in front of me I swear everything was going in slow motion while the theme from Space Odyssey was playing. Then comes the abrupt record scratch. As soon as I bit into the short rib I was VERY disappointed. It was very salty and dry, chewy like beef jerky. Not what I expected at all. Yes I know they use a soy based marinade and then hung to dry. Then it is pan fried. This is what everybody has been raving about? Im sorry but the perfect short ribs for me are the ones that are marinated and then straight to the grill which keeps the meat soft, moist and easily chewed. Not hung to dry and then deep fried.Everything else was just ok. We ordered Menu D($23.00) which consisted of Kalua Pig, Lomi Salmon, Pipikaula Ribs, and Luau Squid.  We selected the 2 scoops of rice but added another 2($2.20) for there were 4 of us. We added a large order of the Short Ribs ($16.00) because my plan was to eat a lot of it and didnt want to run out. We also added an order of Laulau($4.75) and Boiled Butterfish Collar with Watercress($7.00) just to try it.The Kalua Pig was one of the better pork dishes I have had in a while. The Lomi Salmon had more tomatoes than fish in it. The Luau Squid was ok even though it looked like green vomit. The Laulau was just ok. Took one bite and really didnt want any more. Boiled Butterfish Collar just ok. Tasted like your basic flaky white fish.In closing, the parking lot is very small, they take cash only, and there are no refills on soda! Business hours are tuesday through friday 10 am to 7:30 pm. Closed saturday, sunday, and monday. Note: The menu prices on their website are slightly lower than on their actual in restaurant menu. So im definitely in the minority of not really having any motivation coming back here. At least thats one more parking spot and table to occupy for you guys that love coming here. As for me, I am glad there is a place where I live in Vegas that makes Short Ribs the way I love and its not just that. If you guys are ever in Vegas, hit me up and I will tell you where my all time favorite Hawaiian restaurant is.Yelp 2018 Review #30699 overall"}, {"review_id": "SWv23IUwU3WJDrikSLBEZQ", "user_id": "NIrMaweeKcceWE1e6ALc6Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Seriously seriously overrated! I am really confused with the 4.5 star rating here. I had written another review of a bubble tea place that I thought was a severe letdown but this probably tops the disappointing restaurants I've tried in Hawaii so far. We ordered combination C with the small poi to try since everybody here has raved about the food here, especially the poi. I was so excited to try authentic Hawaiian food and experience the service but I would say I was severely disappointed...which is an understatement. We luckily didn't have to wait too long even though there was a line of people already on a weekday late lunch hours which was nice. I was excited to try a variety of different foods but wow the portions are tiny, expensive, and all the dishes tasted mediocre. I did not like the poi at all but it may just be an acquired taste. The lomi salmon was nothing special. Short ribs were alright.. super tough. The fried butterfish everyone raves about was rubbery and tasted like mackerel my mom grills..nothing special at all. We could barely finish the dishes. Service wasn't that friendly and our waitress didn't check on us once.

Everyone says that Helena's is a must visit place if you're in Honolulu. Those people are correct!We ordered the menu D (kalua pig, lomi salmon, pipikaula short ribs, luau squid) with small poi, large rice (2 scoops), macaroni salad, and the laulau. I loved all the things we ordered, except the poi because I just wasn't used to eating that / not my taste (I think it's an acquired taste). Poi is made from the underground plant stem/corm of a taro plant. It's like a gloppy mash, very viscous. It didn't have much flavor and was very starchy, but if you eat it with the other stuff like meat, then it is much better. I'm so glad we got rice because I was just not used to eating poi. I definitely needed something like rice to complement the meat Best thing ever was the laulau. Super flavorful, a bit salty, but delicious. Pork wrapped in taro leaf. Yums. It is a MUST GET.Their macaroni salad was also reaaaally good.Kalua pig was tender, and their pipikaula short ribs were super tasty. Just sad that there was a bit more fat than I wanted on it, but the marination/flavoring was on point. (According to Wikipedia, pipikaula \"is a Hawaiian cuisine dish of salted and dried beef that similar to beef jerky. Pipikaula was eaten by Hawaiian cowboys (paniolos).\")The lomi salmon is the salsa looking thing, and I loved the sourness & acidity of this dish brought to balance out the rest of the meal. The luau squid was another favorite and balanced out the meal well. It was savory and sweet due to the coconut milk, and I enjoyed it a lot.A side of haupia, onions, and some pink salt came with the meal. Haupia, a coconut milk jelly dessert, was refreshing and a nice way to end the meal!"}, {"review_id": "hKAo_1dWcWi3aGaaXNxRzw", "user_id": "p8Sb6apbKoc7V3j1LGyMNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "Broke da mouth good!Helena's is a local favorite hole in the wall restaurant and has been around for decades!
