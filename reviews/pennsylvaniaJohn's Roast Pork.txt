Growing up, not only was it the 'other white meat,' but it was the other *taboo* white meat.   But now that I'm a supposed adult, and arguably, a heathen, I indulge once in awhile.  With that said, I've tried and loved the legendary Roast Pork Sandwich from DiNic's, and back in Brooklyn, am a fan of the rendition from Federoff's.   So I'm coming at this with some sort of reference point:Anyway, I ordered a (duh) Roast Pork with extra spinach and sharp provolone for hubby and me to share.  Sadly, the meat had ZERO flavor.  And the mild spinach, v. bitter broccoli rabe that they offer at similar eateries, did nothing to amp things up.  The distinctive funkiness of sharp provolone overwhelmed everything.  The kid insisted on getting a Cheesesteak, and hubby and I were both surprised by how much we enjoyed it.  Dug the seeded bread it was served on, not to mention the tender 'n tasty steak.  Fwiw, had to go with American cheese, since 'Whiz' isn't an option here.Ordering was confusing and if I'm being really honest, intimidating.  There was a burly guy taking orders for Cheesesteak and other grill items, which you place first.  Then if you wanted Roast Pork, you had to do that separately, with another counter person closer to the register. I experienced a bit of a 'Soup Nazi' moment, a la Seinfeld.  If I didn't order 'right,' I feared I'd be tossed out of the place.  This is one of those 'just shuddup and eat' sort of spots with a bare bones interior, and seating, only outdoors mind you, to match.  I'm good with that, but the mediocre Roast Pork... Not so much.  Maybe it was an anomaly, though I doubt I'll return to find out.  Three stars, but only thanks to the respectable Cheesesteak.ps  According to Yelp, John's doesn't accept credit cards.  Well I can tell you firsthand, it does, and per the cashier, has done so for the past two years.  double ps  Unless I missed it, there isn't a restroom, gender neutral or otherwise.  Luckily, Lowe's is within very easy driving distance should you too have a pee emergency after dining here."}, {"review_id": "-5SJhZoModMVyBeGrFbtSg", "user_id": "N7IJIk9GNSqhoGW-QFNOYg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvsnia ---\"John's Roast Potk\" is a Philly icon for the famous Philly steak & pork sandwich since 1930.It is located on Snyder near 2nd Street, home of the famous annual January 1 \"Mummer's 2 Street pARTy\".The place is true Philly!  A true \"cheese, no cheese\" place.  Know what you want, know where to stand, & be assertive.Signs are there, but they are only clear to the regular customer.  People are standing everywhere, with people who ordered & people who have yet to order, and ... mixed together with those who want a grilled Philly steak sub/hoagie OR roast pork \"sandwich\" (which is actually a sub/hoagie) ...the staff is frienfly, but Philly direct ... know what you want and don't hold up the line!A small location with lots of character.  Outdoor & indoor seating tables available.  Be prepared to share a table.  No off-street parking (that I saw), and limited street parking.A \"Run-A-Way Bill\" Favorite experience, although, not my personal favorite Philly steak sandwich.As a 1st-timer, I totally enjoyed the chaos & perdonslities of the staff.\"Run-A-Way Bill\" was here! #RunAwayBill #FoodUSA #FoodRAB #Philidelphia #Philly #PhillyCheeseSteak #JohnsRoastPork 04.27.18"}, {"review_id": "lDtq_WuER1ym6QRctqi9Vw", "user_id": "gekp2Z5I4vPGf2NeFnZX2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Was hanging at CHOP visiting my niece and my brother-in-law brought in a cheesesteak with provolone cheese.

There is plenty of parking around John's, which is located behind what looks like some sort of industrial factory; really captures the Philly atmosphere perfectly. There are a few tables to eat at, but they are in a kind of outside area only divided from the cold outdoors by some plastic. Again, just the perfect Philly look. The inside is just enough to fit maybe 14 people standing packed shoulder-to-shoulder for ordering; any more then that and the line will surely be out the door.The ordering is a bit odd, as if you want a cheesesteak you tell the guy in the corner of the counter, versus if you want something else you tell the woman further down the counter. No signage at all, just a guy hollering about how to order. I guess that's Philly for you, but someone who hasn't been there before could easily get in the wrong line if they didn't hear the guy. They do not have Wiz. When I first opened the paper it's rolled in, the first thing you notice is the steam; this is freshly made to order. The roll here is very unique; it's a bit crunchier on the outside, and has sesame seeds on it. The meat is cooked perfectly; into ribbons making it an easy, and delicious eat. You can tell this is quality meat. The only knock I can give John's is that some of the onions on the cheesesteak were raw, not cooked all the way through. And while I do like raw onions, I don't think it was meant to be that way on this particular cheesesteak. The American cheese on it was perfect to compliment the meat, and the ratio was on point.If you are looking for the perfect Philly Cheesesteak, you come to John's.Food (A), Pricing (B), Atmosphere (B+), Service (B+)"}, {"review_id": "YOk0GIg2ezdBMQceyGoFhA", "user_id": "qV0rXL6IGnJfVsZbGOt6Lw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Food: 5/5Service: 2.5/5Atmosphere: 3/5Value: 5/5This is a no nonsense and frills place and the location and decor is a little unappealing, but the cheesesteaks offered here are some of the best.

There is an outdoor picnic-like seating area where condiments such as ketchup, mustard, pickles, and banana peppers, are found. It can get chilly though depending on the season and weather.I ordered the mushroom cheesesteak with provolone cheese and onions ($9.75), and I've never seen a cheesesteak with that much meat (12 oz to be exact). It was piping hot, and the cheese was thoroughly melted and mixed together with the juicy meat, mushrooms, and onions, which were all stuffed into this perfectly toasted, robust sesame roll. The onions were thoroughly caramelized, and they definitely didn't skimp out on the ingredients - I was full from eating just half of it. The only con is that I wish they had different or more pepper options. It also closes at 7PM, but they already extended their closing time from 3PM a few years ago.Definitely pass on Genos or Pat's King, which are super touristy, unless you like that cheese whiz, and come to John's Roast Pork if you're ever in Philly!

When arriving, the location looks like a dive in shack, not the most appealing. But these types are places usually have the best food inside!There was a line to order cheesesteaks, which went by within 20-25 min. Once you place your order, you wait for them to call you when its ready. Theres also a fair amount of picnic table type seating. The cheesesteaks- flavor was definitely there with cheese melted into the meat. Its not my favorite cheesesteaks ive ever had. HOWEVERR, i did eat my other half later in the day and it tasted even better. There was a good bread to meat ration as well. They use a delicious precisely toasted sesame hero to house the inside goodness. The meat was perfectly chopped and cooked, not fatty at all.  It was also very juicy. I would have preferred if it had a more cheesy aspect to it Ex. have cheese oozing rather than the cheese being melted in with the meat. Or maybe even both!! Give me all the fat. Everything was great until we decided while eating that we wanted a drink. We sat outside and there was a vending machine with drinks, so we just figured to get one from there. After putting coins in, it ate them. I then went inside to tell the employees. A girl told me that shes not the right person to tell and to talk to a manager or someone else i really dont know. (Keep in mind this is a very busy location with nonstop customers). I couldnt get through to anyone up front so i went back to the girl and just asked for the manager as i thought i could resolve the issue quicker. The manager spoke to me and i told her what happened. We wanted a pepsi and they ran out.  Really poor for a business to run out of pepsi/coke on a SATURDAY. The manager told me they dont service that vending machine (oook but its on ya business property seemingly a part of your business). She did give me my eaten money back. I then asked if they could just give me a bottle of water and shes said very short and rude \"idk check the fridge youre covering it i cant see\". This was my first time coming. Idk how yall serve your beverages. Im not on a search for where you locate your drinks. I was under the impression they would have access from behind the counter. The whole situation was suuuuch a turn off! I totally get working in a busy and demanding work environment and that they were all overwhelmed. Ive worked retail in midtown manhattan in my late teens. Extremely stressful. BUT youre always taught to remain calm, annd not for nothing, youre taught that the customer is always right. Idk. I just walked out pissed, knocked off a star for service.  Also, This location DOES NOT ACCEPT CARD, AND DOES NOT HAVE AN ATM!!! Which is another reason I knocked a star for la k of efficiency. If youre a cash only place, you should at least have an ATM.

The wait on a Friday afternoon around 12:30pm wasn't too bad -- we were outside for many 5 minutes and then waited another 10 inside. Note: There are TWO different lines -- one for cheese steaks and one for roast pork and others. I got a CHEESE STEAK with SHARP PROVOLONE, MUSHROOMS, ONIONS, PEPPERS. Also got a side of ONION RINGS which is pretty small by the way, maybe 7 pieces I think. But they are too die for. Greasy, but so good the onion just melts in your mouth. The cheese steak was amazing too, probably the best sandwich I've had in Philly for sure. The cheese was so so good too -- I totally suggest getting all the toppings for sure. The \"indoor\" seating area is basically a tent area which has a huge heating lamp. It wasn't on when we were there but it wasn't too cold.
