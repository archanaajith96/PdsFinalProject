Freshly made donuts customized with toppings of your choice. I like how they have a list of their most popular items which makes choosing toppings a little easier.  I just wished they had that list in the drive thru area.  Customer service is great. Place is nice and clean and you can see your donuts being made in front of you. Wish there was a location in Vegas!"}, {"review_id": "hkiCpuYqkSxUD-YCmeT34Q", "user_id": "QMUGCm95N-E2xt_yWfy_7Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Mhmm I've only had Duck Donuts one other time and it was just as good if not better. The service was great, everyone was soooo polite and nice I loved it. The donuts are so wonderfully soft and sweet. We had 4 Bacon Sunrise, Boardwalk, French Toast, and Cinnamon Sugar with Vanilla Icing. Omg if you're a bacon lover get the Maple Bacon or Bacon Sunrise. It's a sweet bacon breakfast. The donuts are no small at all."}, {"review_id": "pyjQoSJvDwT6YZtsVQkd4w", "user_id": "cXTcdpi-UJs8M3pZysmcvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/28/2017", "text": "As a Virginia Beach native I think that I can (possibly?) speak for the majority of us when I say that Duck Doughnuts literally never disappoints us when it comes to the quality of their food.It's always, literally, leg burningly hot when you walk out the front door and still warm by the time you're home and ready to eat them. An awesome perk since the last time that I visited is that they are now service milk. Alas, the milk comes in a cafeteria style cardboard box, but it's milk and I'll take it! HahaThe staff was kind, quiet and helpful. I'm looking forward to coming back soon for another maple glazed doughnut with their famous bacon sprinkles.

All their donuts are made-to-order, which makes the donuts hot and crunchy. Then, you'll have to pick the flavors of your icing and toppings(if you want), and adding toppings are FREE. I had: Chocolate icing with Oreo crumbs, blueberry icing, peanut butter icing with peanut crushed and strawberry.I personally don't like too sweet so I hope that they had dark chocolate or less sugar icing. Anyways, they are all delicious except the blueberry one is extremely sweet. Especially the peanut everything and the chocolate Oreo ones.The price is higher than other donut stores but that's definitely worth it. If you don't like too sweet like me, try the peanut butter one I had."}, {"review_id": "9Uz8sOhzq1s-eIQPgE5PZg", "user_id": "CpfMlMlcVgAubtJ86zGJkQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/7/2017", "text": "One of my favorite spots on the face of earth. When you bite into a donut from Duck Donuts it's like time slows down. The prices for their donuts are also amazing. Duck Donuts is a place to indulge with out ever breaking your pockets. I will take these donuts over any other donut shop any day.The freedom of customizing your own is amazing. I usually get maple glazed with bacon topping or choose one of their already customized donuts."}, {"review_id": "Q1IjFRtiYO8PLLaG-ICBDA", "user_id": "V2BH-x6PRAn3zf089m1-jQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/10/2017", "text": "I've been coming here for several years and have been happy with each visit. I remember my first time having their donuts and the maple bacon was most definitely my favorite and made Duck Donuts a place that I would visit on my vacations to the OBX. I was a giddy little school girl when I heard it was coming to very Virginia Beach and that this location was being built. They are one of the best in the donut game and since their arrival to the area other establishments have popped up and I have tried most of them (fat boy loves his donuts). Duck Donuts is still one of the best and is worth your dollar, check them out."}, {"review_id": "owYGIeHhRGDw8n9f-1b7Wg", "user_id": "j7TwGM3QvxVPPJBCQE5W0w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2017", "text": "Not much to say that hasn't already been said. The donuts are delicious. I drive 30 minutes to this location and its totally worth it. I have a Krispy Kreme very close to my house and I barely step foot in there anymore. Even their donuts fresh off the conveyor belt don't compare to these. Every flavor you get here is hot and fresh and there are so many combinations. Even with that being the case I always get the maple bacon. Prior to eating these I couldn't understand how bacon would be good on a donut but you absolutely have to taste these to understand how wonderful they are. The parking lot is a bit tight but such a small sacrifice for such amazing donuts. I was in and out in 5 minutes or so and my son loves watching the donuts come off the conveyor while we wait. The staff is always pleasant and friendly and I don't know how else to say I love this place!"}, {"review_id": "1kPqNttzgivggIrRxfzbvg", "user_id": "NjM31lKNFyYmDj_feNTOyg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Not sure if it was because it was off season, but we never got to try it b/c they close each day at 3:00???The ones we've been to before all stay open until 9pm"}, {"review_id": "8ssLVQOpf_RPgmJs5ihhFw", "user_id": "4bCZQJSe9a39Ba8YMizr9A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "My husband and I just moved here and are big donut fans.

I agree that they and Krispy Kreme are different types of donuts but they're both donuts and Duck is in first place HANDS DOWN. Always so fresh and warm. Today they had a perfect crunch on the outside while soft on the inside. They were so delish I called back to let them know just how great they were. They were truly MAGICAL! Oh...today I had the maple bacon (of course) and a plain one drizzled with salted caramel.

The donut itself was fresh and moist but the topping didn't seem to have much seasoning it tasted like plain sugar on a donut. The set up was pretty easy to figure out, the establishment was clean and staff was friendly answering all of our questions.

I agree with the other reviews parking lot is pretty tight but they do have drive through and I've never had to wait long.  You can also buy a single donut if that is all your heart desires (just not through drive through if not mistaken).  You always have to look for the hot sign to get a hot super fresh donut at Krispy Kreme at Duck Donuts think of it as the hot sign is always on. Each batch is made to order just for you.
