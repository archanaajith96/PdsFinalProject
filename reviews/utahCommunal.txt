If you've been wanting to check this place out but you're on a budget, try stopping in for brunch (Saturdays only) or lunch. Pricing during those meals are comparable to other downtown spots. Dinner is where it starts to get spendy. For brunch with my girls, we love the bruléed grapefruit and then something hearty. We all got savory plates with meat and biscuits last time and everything was so good. For lunch, I'll do a salad with chicken or salmon added in or one of their burgers or sandwiches. If that have it in, try the Reuben. They corn their own beef and it's so good."}, {"review_id": "ikXsB2x4DWw1A0CurQgStA", "user_id": "siaWMhA-eiZKHpV5Z-ZATQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/8/2017", "text": "This review is for Communal's Saturday brunch, because I go at least every other week. I have tried and love all of the brunch options at Communal, but my favorite are the eggs benedict for a traditional brunch item, the deep fried french toast for my sweet tooth, and the pinestate when I'm extra hungry. I also love the coffee and mimosas offered with brunch. While the menu is enough to keep me coming back, I also love Communal because the staff there are some of the nicest you will ever meet. I look forward to brunch every week!"}, {"review_id": "19mykeVhYT5jIDWUc5SzvA", "user_id": "mOYd6rrSHJoZlVjDhiWdsA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Ordered the blue cheese burger. Dry, over cooked, and lacked balance. Fries were salty. The coffee was terrible. The pasta dish was sublime, we loved that dish. The butterscotch dessert is amazing, we nearly went to battle over equally dividing the dessert between us.

When I made the reservation, it only allowed me to reserve it for 10 people which I thought was kinda specific, but once we got there it made sense. I was expecting to sit at the communal table, but they have a private room parallel to the kitchen that I had never seen before. It was SO nice to be in a private room - which can only seat 10, hence the cap on the number of people. Just in case you wanted to make a large reservation.We decided to go kinda family style and try a bunch of things on the menu. We ordered about half of what they have and everything BLEW me away! I was already expecting the meal to be fantastic since dinner there is unreal. But even with my high expectations, I was still very very satisfied. I am in love with this \"farm-to-table\" restaurant and think it deserves to be the Best of Provo in my opinion.I can't wait to go back and try everything! I think my favorite thing had to be the BELT (bacon, egg, lettuce, tomato) and the breakfast potatoes!"}, {"review_id": "EKqujmKnHlqwVoE-IsZ5xw", "user_id": "Up9Q-R5MDFaD2K_t5FEpQQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/30/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "It's been 6 years since the original review. Time for an update. I don't come here so much any more, but I still make it at least once a year. The place has remained very consistent. It follows the same trends of farm to table places across the country. If it's Trendy in Denver and Chicago, it's probably going to be on the menu here. It matches the restaurants that have the same philosophy in Salt Lake City. That's not bad. We need places keeping up with the current dining trends. The house made potato chips were top notch.The primary difference is that the places in SLC, and other larger markets will have higher end, or \"edgy\" ingredients. We're not seeing bone marrow, foie gras, sweetbreads, and similar. I understand it, but would like to see more breadth here. The locals like their basic, and simple, dishes. We are not seeing higher prices ingredients either. There's not going to be any dry aged steaks here.All that said, the food is generally very good. The melon with reduced balsamic vinegar features ripe delicious melon. It was the highlight of the meal. They do follow the local love for overcooked meat. I ordered my hanger stead rare, and was hoping that it would come out medium rare, it came out medium. Fortunately, it was nicely flavored, and it wasn't dried out enough to be an issue. The fries are good, but still need some ketchup to go with them. This is the one place where just supplying Heinz 57 in a nice little container is the way to go. Our taste memory and expectations require Heinz. They make everything else in house. Thanks for not trying to make ketchup. It almost never comes out better than Heinz.The biggest issue is always lapses in service. Our server brought appetizers that were obviously meant to be shared, but no small plates to share them. The water glasses went empty for far too long, and a request for some ketchup to go with the fries wasn't filled without asking a second time. These are rookie mistakes.It's great to see it's well supported, even at lunch. It is deserving of our support."}, {"review_id": "Si19-MfWV0cEGocqF1JDvQ", "user_id": "GU4MX8CAyhEco_VedFQZ9Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/7/2017", "text": "We are brunch here and it was amazing.

Take my money. All of it. This is hands down the best restaurant in Utah Valley. No fibs here. I was completely blown away by this heavenly place! I have tried 3 times previously to get a reservation here, and my husband finally got us one for our anniversary. Seriously the menu is out of this world and my soul aches for the day I can come back. How it works: Every plate is meant to be shared by two people. You first pick an appetizer, then a main dish with a few sides. Finally you finish up with dessert or coffee or whatever your heart desires. Andy and I chose the meat and cheese board for our starter. Best one I've had yet... everything is locally sourced. Fresh honey, sugared cranberries, grade AAA prosciutto, asiago (I believe) cheese, and crotons. Whammy! The real showstopper was the flat iron steak. I've had so many different steaks in my life, but like my husband, I found one that's so good I don't want any other!! It's amazing how it just melts in your mouth. Absolutely fantastic. We chose gnocchi's and mint asparagus for our sides. I really can't describe the flavors but they rocked my world!! The freshness was just so life-changing! You can really tell they only get the best of the best, so you get your money's worth. For the finale, we had the butterscotch pudding. I'm talking real butterscotch people. Who does that anymore?!? #blessed I would try that first but maybe try the sorbet next time too because it looked divine. If I were rich, I know exactly what I would do first... bribe the chef to come make me these delicious dinners every night. So much yes. So, like a good friend who tells you to get the shoes... get the food!! It's all worth it!!"}, {"review_id": "_LrUotwDR-xU-l79yuxT2g", "user_id": "cG6tlQRtfMKVf4Op196JPQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "Not quite as farm-to-table as I envisioned, but still yummy and fresh.

I didn't really like one thing I had. My flank steak had the worst char taste I've ever had on a steak; no seasoning flavor at all...just burnt taste. So bad. I asked for medium well and it was not. Most of it was still bleeding and raw. I was so grossed out. The mashed potatoes were very bland, not much flavor at all. Very disappointing. The squash side was pretty good; a little undercooked for my taste but the sauce on them was good. Dessert: we got the apple crumble. Although the crumbles on top we're really good, the rest was very watered down with not much flavor or sustenance.   For what we paid, I expected more.  Unfortunately we won't be going back."}, {"review_id": "ECQmqsbaIG-ULU1GLkGHYw", "user_id": "ppcTFh2Zle-PtopvodbxkA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "The food was pretty good but not up to their previous excellent standards.

It is actually better than any other place in my book! When I visit Salt Lake City, I always make the drive down to Provo, just so I can eat here!! They have never disappointed, and today was just proof of how amazing they are! The food is delicious!!! All fresh, locally sourced food that tastes incredible! The customer service is by far the best of all the other places in the area.Today was just further justification of this being my favorite place to eat. We arrived close to closing, and they happily seated our family. They took their time talking with my family, never once rushing us to order, even though the kitchen would be closing soon. When they found out our family was in the middle of a cross country move, not only did they take the time to talk with us about our plans, but they shared places they recommended, and they even surprised our family with an extra appetizer on the house. When we were the only family left in the restaurant, the Moana soundtrack was turned on for our girls. Oh, and when we went to leave, they had these amazing desserts ready for us to take home! They are the gold star of customer service!

The staff was very kind and accommodating. The food left a little something to be desired, although it sure looked beautiful! We came in for lunch. I got the lamb burger and liked everything but the patty edges, which were all char and no meat. The fries could have been salted more lightly. The pita on the falafel sandwich was toasty and dry and felt kind of crouton-y. The bleu bacon burger could have benefitted from a lot less bleu sauce and more bleu crumbles plus some greens and tomato. Surprisingly, the standout dish was actually the house-made barbecue chips! Those were crunchy, thick, and flavored just right, and the ranch was deliciously dill-heavy. My partner and I agreed that the chips were the best item we tried.

Save it for a nice date, or dinner with friends from out-of-town, it's on the spendier side (especially for Provo) but coming from the Bay Area I found it to be reasonably priced.The menu at Communal focuses on seasonal and locally sourced ingredients, so if that's your jam then by all means make a reservation already! Our group of six ordered a ton of food, which was great since a number of their dishes are sized and plated for sharing.One of my friends was familiar with the restaurant and suggested that we lean on recommendations from our server to decide what to order. I definitely think this is the way to go too as our server was super up front about what she was loving on the menu, and what was worth skipping over until next time.We ordered starters to share as a group, which were all excellent. The Mussels and Beef tartare were standouts for me for sure, but we also ordered a Beet Salad and Little Gem salad to share with the table. For our entree my fiancé and I decided to share the Rabbit Pappardelle which was incredible-- I would easily order this again if it was featured on the menu. I think people are a little intimidated by Rabbit but it is by far one of my very favorite proteins if cooked properly, and it was braised beautifully here (fall apart, fork tender). In an effort to a little more greenery we also ordered the side of Broccolini which was also really delicious.
