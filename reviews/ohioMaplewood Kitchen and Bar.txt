The food is delicious, super friendly service and a great farmhouse chic decor. Definitely try the side of geotta, a Cincinnati breakfast staple. The avocado Benedict was also amazing - eggs poached to perfection.

It's close enough to the river that I can walk there after baseball games for a Blackberry Lemonade cocktail and a cobb salad or rotisserie-cooked chicken.    The staff is always accommodating and polite and help provide a great experience. They may be a little more friendly because I'm a regular, but anyone would appreciate the restaurant.     It's a great spot for brunch with friends or dinner with the family."}, {"review_id": "xWmzJePRi1SXp9HZeIFrOg", "user_id": "Ck53nGYbkUKSwVc3ie_gJQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "This place has a different way of ordering. Stand in line, order at the counter and pay for order and tip. Do NOT expect to be in line less than 15 minutes. If you're starving, this isn't a good idea on the weekend. The food is good, but a little salty for my taste, but the cocktails are good."}, {"review_id": "6bYfpLs0PsJG2xt4ylwXjQ", "user_id": "5zXY_zul-H0vpnaXNJhPdQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "I have heard so much about this restaurant so, I decided to give it a try. My co-worker and I scheduled a meeting with our agency for a quick touch base. We arrived around 11:40 to beat the lunch crowd. That was a smart decision as the lunch crowd swarmed in around 12 and it became very crowded. On top of the loud conversation, the restaurant plays loud music. Even though the genre was a nice choice, the restaurant could have lowered the volume a little. With all the commotion it made it hard to hear one another. The food was very good and provided nice healthy options. I look forward to visiting again for brunch or a nice happy hour with the girls."}, {"review_id": "j-iDnNx3cyPnuukMz5U-oA", "user_id": "efZ3lgvDWfq4-U6U-q-2lA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "This place is fantastic! It may be a little pricey but it's worth it!  The hubby and I decided to split a few things and it was more than enough food.

There are a few menus at the entrance. This style of eatery has you order everything you want at the register, give you a number, then bring your food to you. I recommend to order your appetizer, main dish, and dessert at the same time to avoid going back into the long lines. I tried the chicken hash - it was absolutely delicious. You can taste the rotisserie chicken. The corn and hash browns gave it a nice sweet, meaty crunch. Chicken Tinga is also a great choice - tortilla with salsa and chicken. I think my fave is the spicy chicken sandwiches with fries - gives a nice spicy kick to the meal. The aoili cream is a great substitute for the traditional ketchup given as a compliment. For dessert, i got a $3 giant cornflake cookie - it's delicious, but I was expecting a soft cookie. This was more firm and crunchy. Lots of healthy options to choose from - they even have fresh pressed juices in front! Next time, i'll try out their famous ricotta and blueberry pancakes!"}, {"review_id": "lkDMgjphMbyQ-_HEpkdpRw", "user_id": "XBktAZawZR-Y7P2EwpYd4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Love this place! Reminds me of Australian style cafes. I came here 3 times in 2 days on a business trip. Everything is great!

They reserved tables for us after our first person arrived and they were very accommodating as we all arrived at different times over a 20 minute period. We had the Super Green Margarita, traditional Bloody Mary, and Mimosa. They were all delicious and the Bloody Mary came with great garnishments including a cheese stuffed pepper. It was a little spicy but not too spicy for those that are not fans of spice/heat. They have hot sauce on the table for that prefer a spicier bloody. Between all of us we had the chicken hash, eggs your way, breakfast sandwich, and blueberry granola pancakes. Everything tasted amazing and the portions were very generous. I had poached eggs with the eggs your way and they were probably in the top 3 eggs I've ever had. I also love a Cincinnati brunch restaurant that offers goetta, so goetta fans this is a great place if you're looking for your goetta fix. The service was awesome and they even brought over a free brunch dessert for the bride to be! This will definitely be going into my brunch rotation and looking forward for going for dinner sometime."}, {"review_id": "7CVZa-L7Q73pe7iGlP5HLA", "user_id": "V_RcZKv2ZxWzdUQYZlCpGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "I went here with some of my good friends. They introduced me to this place when I was seeing them off to their new place of residence in the Cinci area. We went here for breakfast before everyone was leaving.Let's start with area... Located in downtown Cincinnati its a nice city scene great for those days when you want to \"do brunch\". We went on a Sunday morning around 9 or 10. There is a parking garage across the street since there isn't much street parking. The building esthetics are gorgeous. I would say it gives off that modern farmhouse feel. Lots of clean white and deep oak wood colors. I was IN LOVE with the décor. Ordering your food is kinda cool too you stand in a line and you pick your drink and look up on the chalkboard menu located on the walls. I ordered the scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, hashbrowns, and the best part OMG the lemon ricotta pancakes with blueberry compote. The lemon ricotta pancakes with blueberry compote were so light and fluffy and also the perfect balance of sweet and air  texture and taste. If you are a health nut they also have fresh pressed juice. This place is gorgeous and the service is fast as well. You are not really seated by a host you will find a place after you order and each table has it's own design and special character. If you are in the area please check them out. I was so in love I googled how to make the pancake dish and it came out pretty good. :)"}, {"review_id": "ysqdxTwCeaKV4P3HA9Wkmw", "user_id": "zlcNLcuWPaJ_A6_Xl5R8FQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "I'm in love with Maplewood Kitchen!! I had a spontaneous brunch with the ladies here and wasn't sure what to expect (I'd never heard of it before) and was left wondering what I've been doing with my life up until this point. The interior is gorgeous... it reminds me of something Chip & Joanna Gaines would design. Simple, elegant, open concept. Normally I don't like the wait in line and order up front concept, but they do it well here. The cashiers were super helpful with any questions we had since it was our first time, and they were able to seat a table of four right away. We tried three different toasts and a soup, and all were delicious. You can tell they treat their food and drinks like an art form, and it was much appreciated by our group. Can't wait to try this place for dinner sometime!"}, {"review_id": "BJGe3Rqpop-2DJbpfSedsg", "user_id": "xx9o342t_qQqKt9oixwVig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Still think this is the best brunch place in Cincinnati!Everything on the menu is extremely good.

You enter the place and top class service starts right there. You will be asked about minutest details and informed the next steps if you are a first time visitor. The beverage choices are more than you can count or try in one trip. Same for the menu. We ordered lemon ricotta pancakes for the very first time. And boy was that good and hefty. Our avocado Benedict was fairly different from traditional Benedicts. It was good for a change. You should expect to wait in the line that forms outside the restaurant on sat and sun mornings, but the line moves along quickly without frustrating you.

Came here on Sunday morning at around 10am, it was relatively busy at that time though it got much busier later on. Got seats at the bar. Got the menus from our bartender who seemed busy but felt sort of unfriendly as well. Decided to order everything at once since we didn't know if we'd see her again and got mimosas, Bloody Mary, guajillo chicken bowl, the avocado Benedict and side of hash browns. The drinks were really good esp the Bloody Mary; got the mimosas much later after the food arrived and seemed like it was forgotten. For food, the chicken bowl was really good and full of protein. The avocado was creamy and delicious. The Benedict seemed good as well but my friend that had it felt sick to the stomach few hours later and didn't have a great flight back. Overall good/decent place to eat had it not been for those shortcomings. There was a big line by the time we got out and also a big line for takeout. There's street and garage parking available."}, {"review_id": "yQh_nGhGmIbF9wvPHY9zZA", "user_id": "aFtWxiQ53zUJM_rJFVdbzw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "This place had a great atmosphere and I loved the pancakes and steak and eggs.

I'm far behind the times on this gem - but imma just say it - SO FUGGIN GOOD. From the hashbrowns to the goetta to the lattes to the chicken club. Seriously, everything on the menu looks so divine - and you just know it is excellently made. I was warned about a potential \"line\" - really not bad all. We got in the door (didn't wait outside at all) and made it to the register to order within 15-20 minutes (seriously im one of those people willing to wait 3 1/2 hours for the Eagle...this was a doozy)The staff is so, so easy to work with and exceptionally kind.

Even without the addition of a protein, it's a generous portion that can, I dare say, leave even a meat lover fully satisfied. The tuna poke tostada is also as delicious, and the fish is extremely well seasoned. The living green salad did not have as much of a wow factor for me, but it's still a solid, healthy option for health conscious diners.
