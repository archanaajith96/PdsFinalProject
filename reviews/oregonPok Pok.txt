I was part of a large group trip and as it goes, majority rules. Friends wanted to check it out, they heard the hype, some were curious, and some in the group actually love this place. I made my best attempt to roll in with an open mind, telling myself to not be influenced by my previously unfortunate experience. After all, I've been known to be a complete a**hole and the ultimate hater! So here I am; a follow up to the only review I had ever felt obligated to submit.  Review #2... brace yourself!I take back EVERYTHING I previously said in my 2014 review. This place is the Bee's knees of Thai food! This guy gets it! The owner may appear to be some average dude, but you might as well call him the white Ong-Bak (cuz he kicks ass).  Or better yet, the Tiger Woods of Thai food.  It started off as a journey to Thailand for the hookers, but he returned to America with so much more than just herpes.You like fish sauce? Well you're in luck! Everything is doused with that magical sauce. Still can't get enough? Ask for a fish sauce shooter to chase those delicious wings!  For real, it's an off-menu option that only seriously connected peeps know about (kinda like asking for \"Animal\" at an In-and-Out Burger, but way more exclusive and much more delicious).  Here's the secret, just go to the most \"hipster\" server you can find (aka some curly moustached dude with his shirt buttoned to the top and wearing suspenders).  Tell'em you wanna \"chase the dragon\". They'll initially pretend that they have no idea what you're talking about, but you must persist. You won't regret it! A plate of chicken wings and 5 shots later, you'll be in fish sauce heaven and battling high blood pressure in no time!People often complain about the long wait, and the prices may seem ridiculously expensive... this is all real. But you gotta pay to play, playa! How else you gonna get those Instagram likes and let everyone know that you are at the hottest spot in Portland! As a self-professed foodie and now one of the thousands that rave about this place... Pok Pok isn't just the restaurant of your dreams, it's the restaurant that we all deserve!If you love this place like me, then you are surely a food connoisseur and tapped into the pulse of style and trendiness; you must have then heard about the restaurant called \"The Shed at Dulwich\"? If not, then you better get with it, friend; it was ranked #1 in London. Only the coolest of cool have been there! But I can say with utmost certainty that Pok Pok is, hands down, way better than that place!Bon appétit y'all!"}, {"review_id": "UGl-BQQjzIJqJ0tI4hpcgg", "user_id": "Wk6PRBf6dmCpt29Bp81Mxw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Overrated and disappointed ! This was incredibly hyped up when I was in NYC as my coworkers keep talking about how great the wings were. They even traveled for an hour to visit the Pok Pok location in Brooklyn, NY just for the wings. So I walked in with expectation being that this must be the greatest wings I will ever have, but I was disappointed.First, the wings were not crispy and the inside meat had no flavor. The only flavor was the skin. Second, the wings are overpriced. Third, the beef curry noodle soup that I got was disappointing. It was advertised as hand pressed coconut milk, and the curry had no coconut milk flavor. The noodles were egg wonton noodles which was the worst combination because it's not a good texture. Then fried noodles were added, why? And why is the soup cold especially When I had the option to add raw shallots, salty mustard green. Lastly, Thai ice tea was alright."}, {"review_id": "SkOOwakpRej3SSsi_wy7YQ", "user_id": "4ORZMxO814akJnLhL1sf_Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "I've heard many things about their wings and I finally had the opportunity to try!The wait wasn't too long on Saturday night; the two of us decided for counter seating and we only waited about 15 minutes. We ordered their fish sauce wings, muu sateh, and a bowl of jasmine rice to share. The muu sateh consisted of pork skewers with a peanut sauce, side of toast, and side of spicy cucumber salad. The pork wasn't dry at all and when dipped into the peanut sauce, all the flavors came to life. I absolutely loved the cucumber salad on the side (couldn't get enough of it), but I could pass on the toast. The wings absolutely blew my boyfriend away. They were crispy and flavored really well, but I suggest to definitely have it with rice. It does get really salty after the first piece, but so good that there is no stopping me. Service was a little lacking for us as we didn't even know who our server was until 15-20 minutes after we sat down. Nobody came to greet us or anything until we flagged a random server down asking to order. Trying to flag our server down for the check was also a little struggle.Yay for the food and will be back next time I'm in town!"}, {"review_id": "y5i2bz0xvzADZb_pC5L9xQ", "user_id": "wRq1DSWOjv0BUnSoCM1HwQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I had never tried Vietnamese food before and lol lol was a great introduction to it.

Perhaps this could of been the lone experience in the many, but before arriving here, this place was hyped. If I was to ask anyone where to go to eat, they would suggest Pok Pok, and I can sorta see why. We arrived a little before 6pm, and all tables were just filled, and therefore, we had to wait about 45 minutes to an hour. Whiskey Soda Lounge was down the street, and that seems to be the go-to place when you have to wait at Pok Pok, as Pok Pok and WSL are owned by the same people (?). 45 min-1hr passes and we check back in, and we are seated. The ambiance is unique, in that it's not your typical restaurant affair. Almost like a picnic table under heated lamps kinda vibe. We had two orders of their signature Fish Sauce Wing's, and a couple of other dishes that were good, but I will dive specifically at the wing's cause .. tbh I don't remember what else we ate. lul. Upon arrival, it looked amazing. A nicely battered wing, a shiny glaze of thick sauce, and you can see the spices right on the wing. Now I'm about to grab the wing with care cause I'm fully expecting my fingers to be roasted cause shit finna be hot. NOPE. The wing was disappointingly room temperature - kinda like that room temperature when you order a box of pizza two days before and theres that one single slice in the box that's been chilling. That kind of room temperature. I think the cooler-temperature wings kind of ruined the experience for me, but if you do believe in second chances then I guess this is that time. I'm hoping the next time I come back the wings will be hot, and that finding parking won't be a pain in the booty hole."}, {"review_id": "dDzsgAMS82InrdJBmMqoYQ", "user_id": "poVgBra2YN8DaJg5_CkL9w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Man did we have a feast here! We were ready for a long wait but were seated after about 10-15 mins. My friend and I shared an order of their famous spicy fish sauce wings, the khao soi with chicken and the pork belly curry (Kaeng Hang Leh). I was honestly impressed with everything! My mouth was just bursting with flavor! The pork belly curry and the khao soi are both wonderful rainy day choices.  The pork belly was so tender and such a wonderful mix of flavors and spices. The curry seemed slightly more like a stew, to be honest, but that's not necessarily a problem.  The khao soi was more subtle in flavor but very satisfying; so soothing and comforting!Our favorite by far were the Spicy Viet Fish Sauce Wings.  So perfectly made! Beautifully crispy without being too fried. And so tender and juicy.  I will say that our wings were not spicy in the least! Both my friend and I love spicy food so we were definitely expecting more kick to them. They did bring some chili paste. But it wasn't that spicy either; we had to keep asking for more! This wasn't the biggest deal as everything was still delicious, but maybe there should be some levels of spice?Definitely one of our favorite meals from our Portland trip!"}, {"review_id": "wwEaDQN43BpGrnk0ILU76g", "user_id": "zazhhZCdT4hG8OwRAPWiug", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "After recommendation from friends, we stopped by here. I had heard from people that this place is a little talked up, so we came in with that expectation. I walked up to the podium around 7pm and there was about a 1 hr wait. We debated staying and waiting or just getting other food. We ended up deciding to just order some wings for take out, which was estimated as a 15 minute wait. We ordered the fish sauce wings- the wings were crunchy and well seasoned. The fish sauce taste is very concentrated on the wings and was a very interesting take on wings- I recommend trying it if you're a fan of wings!The wings came out to about 15.75 without tip for about 6 wings. The guy that took my order in the take out window was one of the NICEST people I have met, so happy and sweet- which added that extra star to this review. Parking is a pain in a butt during peak hours, so you might stray into the neighborhood areas to park. I recommend doing take out here, as I'm not 100% sure an 1 hr wait is worth it. But it is a unique taste- might be worth atleast trying it!"}, {"review_id": "lr8ianQP-pQRba850tUWvQ", "user_id": "HqMWEEsYIXoFhdDIX1NtrA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "So good!  Came with my gf and sat with her at the bar/counter that jutxaposed being inside or outside. There was a 30-minute wait for 2 for a real table (it's not a terribly small or big restaurant - but very authentically decorated as Thai with Thai music) and we were glad to be seated right away at the bar thing because we had a bunch of other girls dining at Bollywood down the street... this was Sat around 3pm ish. I guess some locals feel there are better options these days, and even though there's a Pok Pok in my native NYC I haven't had a chance to go and wanted to try the original. I was surprised there were many other SE Asian specialties there, like Vietnamese/ Burmese. I thought it was just Thai. It is pan regional Thai, from Issan to Bangkok specialties, etc. And the menu is very very extensive - authentic (well, for being run by a white dude), with lots of options to choose from. They give you lime/salted peanuts to try to start; they were not spicy at all.  Since my friend and I had a heavy breakfast, we just split an order of the Fish Wings (spice on the side because my friend is very anti spicy but I really do think most people would have been fine with it, it was very mild). The wings were gooey, sticky, and sweet - it was a really mild Vietnamese style fish sauce (vs the salty Thai kind) I felt. We also shared an order of delicate and delicious khao soi - crispy noodles in a fragrant coconut curry. It was served with bone in chicken thigh and drumstick. The chicken was tender and cooked down, but if it was prepared without bone that would have been a better easy/sharing experience. Great, chewy, egg noodles. The curry was what was most delicious. Our server was nice, knowledgeable. He also understood we had a heavy breakfast and was ok with us not ordering more food. The portions are decent here, esp the wings and the food is inexpensive I feel. Maybe it's cause I'm from NYC :D Would recommend for authentic Thai food lovers, and for first timers. Decor, ambiance is no frills and overall vibe is relaxed. It seems good for groups or  a foodie date - seems like they can make stiff drinks."}, {"review_id": "7Ki5Qsu38V0qRUMF7jgoZQ", "user_id": "tgxOMt72pALx3_r2uZ92tQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Hmmmmm very overhyped. This place certainly got on the radar thanks to Guy dropping in a couple years ago for Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, but I'm not sure that they will be keeping up their ratings for too much longer.Their famous spicy wings will get you 6 wings for a whole load of money. And they ain't even that great. Nor are they spicy. For those of you who aren't a fan of fish sauce, this dish will very well need to be skipped. It's also wayyyyy too salty. There's a reason for those pickled veggies on the side, so make use of them!We also tried the Khao Soi Kai, which is a curry soup base with rice noodles and chicken. I liked this way better than the wings, but thought it tasted a bit bland. And, most of the chicken in the soup was bone. It was definitely too small to be a portion size for one.I almost wonder if Pok Pok made it big because there isn't much variety in terms of ethnic food in Portland.

BUT. I ended up super disappointed. This place is overhyped... Let's start with the cons:The place is extremely small - I felt squished. The wait was almost an hour and there isn't really a place where people can just wait. (There's another Thai place right across the street, which was closed during my visit.) Pricey af especially for the quantity they give you. For example: 6 pieces of their wings for ~$16...Service: Slow and horrible. It took them sooooooo long to ask for our order. So our total wait time to be seated + getting our order + getting our food + getting the check was, I want to say, probably close to three hours. They never checked up on our table or refilled our water. A lot of ppl working, too, but it doesn't look like there's teamwork/ good communication. They tried to compensate for horrible-ness with 10 pieces of peanuts? Lol thanks I guess?Ambiance: There will be a lot of chatter, because a lot of older folks in suits love to eat here and just sit and talk and talk which is probably a reason for such a long wait. The bad and slow service and squished seating arrangement gave me a very enhhh feeling to this place. I did not get that Thai/Vietnamese feel to the place at all. Music was... punk rock? Then mixed with other songs? I can't even describe it. I would not suggest this place as a good family sit down spot even though their menu says it's what Pok Pok is about. No parking lot so good luck finding street parking.Okay on to the goooood:Their wings were delicious!! It's definitely why Pok Pok is \"popular.\" I mean, if you look at the pictures on Yelp, all you'll see are pics of wings. First bite into the chicken def gave me that Ratatouille eating/describing food moment. With the fireworks and etc. Sucks that they only give you a few pieces for such a high price but it was ...worth it. We also ordered their ribs. It tasted sweet and had a lot of meat on the bone. Note: these are not the fall of the bone type of ribs. It came with two sauces a spicy and mild sweet chili sauce. I enjoyed the spicy one a lot! Lastly, we had to get rice. One order of jasmine rice and one order of coconut rice. I've never had coconut rice, and I have to say, it was pretty yummy. Yet, I'm sure I can have a better tasting coconut rice elsewhere. Overall, if you're visiting Pok Pok as part of your Portland to go/do/eat list, I do suggest ordering take out and IF the day is beautiful, find a nice park and have a picnic. Saves you a lot of time and saves you from smelling like fish sauce. Yes, order the wings."}, {"review_id": "jd2McpP4GvcStGSDGchRJg", "user_id": "g373TtVsKhEciAz5mEWYTQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "Yelp 100 Challenge 2018 (18/100)Pok Pok is one of those places people always recommend when going to Portland. They actually opened a location in LA, but it closed before I was able to try it. So, I knew I had to try it when I went to Portland.I went on a Sunday night with my friend and had to wait 45 minutes to be seated. It's nice though because they'll text you when your table is ready, so you don't have to wait at the restaurant. Also, they have a bar next door that you can chill at in the meantime as well.We ordered the Papaya Pok Pok, Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings, and Kaeng Hang Leh. The Papaya Pok Pok was a papaya salad. It was good, but really spicy! I can't handle spicy very well, so after eating a decent amount, I couldn't handle it anymore and had to stop eating it. The wings are one of the most popular dishes at Pok Pok. One order comes with 6 huge wings (like the whole wing!). They tasted really great! It was extremely flavorful - sweet, salty, tangy, and spicy. This was my favorite dish that we had. The Kaeng Hang Leh was a pork belly curry. The pork belly pieces were big & fatty. The curry itself was tasty, but was definitely more like a stew than a curry. Definitely get an order of sticky rice to accompany it.The cons of Pok Pok for me were that it was a bit too spicy and pretty pricey. But overall, I'm still glad I tried it.

Lots of little shops and cafes to browse while you wait. We got to sit upstairs in the converted house - fun, cute, intimate. Our waiter was AWESOME (Michael).  We are fairly familiar with Thai food, but his recommendations made our meal next-level awesome.  We started with Thai tea - we did the tea + lime juice instead of evaporated milk.  I think this was the best Thai tea drink I've had.  It comes bottled, made by Pok Pok, and I am now going to do some searching to see if we can order it online. Oh and their starter spiced peanuts are delicious! For food, we ordered 3 dishes for 2 (hungry) people and it was the perfect amount of food.  We started with their famous wings, and decided to go spicy.  These are NOT Thai spicy, and really it just adds a nice kick.  They were delicious - unlike any wing flavor I've had before.  They come with some lightly pickled vegetables.  We had two main courses to share. First was the Khao Man Som Tam.  ORDER THIS DISH.  As I mentioned, we are familiar with Thai food (from time in LA and time in Thailand).  We know that we cannot handle real Thai-level spice.  And we know (with reaffirmation from Michael) that this spice lives in the papaya salads.  So Khao Man Som Tam is perfect.  You get some papaya salad (spicy), some delicious meat, vegetables/cabbage, and rice.  Now I will say, we ate the papaya salad on its own as well as with the accompanying meats, etc and the spice was not the \"make you sweat/cry\" that we've experienced elsewhere.  BUT it was still quite the kick/punch, and I do not think we would've survived a full plate's worth.So next/last we had the Khao Soi Kai. We were looking for a mild curry and this was perfection.  It was so flavorful, and I don't really know what to compare it to because it's nothing like the Thai curries we've had elsewhere (we love those, but this curry had some unique spices/flavors).  We opted for chicken (and it's a HUGE bone-in piece).We loved our Pok Pok experience, and can't wait to come back for another visit."}, {"review_id": "dP5_yuWe3WFE0sZFH83WnA", "user_id": "MnbmGV2cQavYGtK07ngEhQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "So good, so unique, so worth the wait.Not your traditional Thai - so if you have a hankering for some Pad Thai or Tom Yum Soup or some Green/Red/Yellow/ROYGBIV curry, then maybe just get over the hankering and still go here anyways (but force your stomach to be more open and accepting).It's popular, so be prepared to wait.
