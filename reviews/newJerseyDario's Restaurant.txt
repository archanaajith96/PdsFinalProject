Even when the line is out the door, Dario really knows how to get em in and out and satisfied. If you're looking for a quick and flavorful lunch, this is the spot. Menu is Tex-Mex, tacos, burritos, quesadillas, taco salads etc. Everything gets a nice little char from the grill, seasoned with a hot sauce, corn, beans, and your choice of meat. Really tasty. Your best bet is to plan getting your order to go as seating is limited. They also do catering as well.

I wanted something on the healthier side and opted for the Taco Salad. Turns out that it was definitely not a diet food, but it certainly was tasty. I guess the closest thing that I can equate it to is a better version of chicken and rice but definitely not as greasy. You have the option to get your salad on a taco bowl or they can make it without the bowl. The chicken was really tasty and well cooked. A little bit on the salty side but overall not too bad. My \"salad\" contained lettuce, rice, chicken, hot sauce, cheese, and white sauce.The staff was really friendly and waited patiently for me to decide what I wanted, while offering suggestions. This definitely is one of those places where you can get to know the people that work there and they remember you as well. The restaurant itself is pretty small, but there are some tables where you can sit down and eat."}, {"review_id": "3JQGIbhd2DOfrZ-FKxMzVw", "user_id": "-wuoqZkRQwsrc4FiKfT4IQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Good food, great service and even better drinks.

They're rude. They won't allow you to decide how you like your food done. They're not good under stress, and they're won't honor customers' requests. For instance, the meats are not all available and if you ask for shrimp, they never have it. But then you get there to pick up your food only to see other people getting shrimp which they had just stated they did not have it. Every single time. Plus, food does not taste that great anymore.

This is one of them. Do yourself the ultimate favor and get a taco bowl. The flavor is Rich and savory but manages to have that fresh and healthy component. When woven together there's nothing where you can ask for. If it's your first time go for the chicken taco bowl. If you've been there but it's been awhile try their burritos they're equally as delicious."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/darios-restaurant-newark?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
