We also had 1/2 rack of ribs, jalapeño cheddar sausage (wife was really disappointed on this) and brisket.  Set-up was kind of cool with it being in old shipping containers behind the bar, I thought it was best use of a one I have seen (military will get it). Down side was you have to take food to go or take to bar in front of barbecue.

This was the best Brisket I've ever had and those are big words coming from a foodie like me. This is BBQ done right.The people are also really nice we were a bit confused because the smokehouse is seperate from the bar.Directions:Go around back to the smokehouse and get your delicious meat choice there you will also pay for the sides that you will pick up in the bar, where you will also be served your drinks.The service is good, the food was great and the atmosphere was nice. My only issues was the mac and cheese was Nothing to write home about but my Brisket was so darn good i barely paid attention to it anyway. It was also super reasonably priced.

It's a shipping container gone BBQ shack, decorated with mounted animal heads because what else screams \"We want all the smoked meats?\"  I DO!Located on a big chalkboard is the menu which features meats, sides, and two signature sandwiches. Happy Hour is from 2 - 4 pm..usually the 2 meat combo for $10. If you chose to eat there, you can take it inside to the Victory Inn. If you order a side, you're given a poker chip to hand to the nice lady behind the counter when you first walk inside. You can sit outside, but there's only one picnic table and it's getting colder...besides, there are adult beverages inside...MMM Beer.Let me suggest The Boar sandwich - Brisket, Pulled Pork AND Pork Belly. A trifecta of meats all hot and ready and waiting to get sauced. Did I mention the sauce? I like both the sweet and signature. I like to combine my sauces...no regrets. The other sandwich, The Dirty D is Brisket and Pulled Pork. Still a solid choice. My go to side is the Mac and Cheese...but the slaw is pretty good also. Overall, great place for BBQ. Don't let the Friday - Sunday only hours discourage you. I usually head there on Friday during lunch hour. It can get busy but they move pretty quickly.

Usually, the Smokehouse is only open on certain days of the week and I didn't think Monday was one of them. All 5 of us opted to walk on the wild side and try the \"House\" for a little authentic Michigander Bar B Q cooked in the back of the parking lot. Three of us opted for the Turkey sandwich while the remaining two grabbed the Pulled Pork sandtown covered with the Smokehouse's Sweet (rather than Spicy) sauce.   We also \"bought in\" at the Bar B Q counter and got real poker chips to trade in for some coleslaw and mac'n cheese at the window inside. Both the Turkey and the Pulled Pork plates drew rave reviews from our table as did the Mac' cheese and  slaw as we washed it all down with Diet Cokes. The only downside of our lunch at the Victory is their quirkiness of having to place orders at three different places inside and outside this dive bar. Our waitress, as friendly and as helpful as she was, would only take drink orders. The Bar B Q had to be ordered outside at the truck.  The slaw and mac'n cheese came from the walk-up window inside the bar. Whew...Glad I had my Fitbit on today... Got nearly a thousand steps in before taking my first bite of my succulent Turkey sandwich. Despite the long-distance runaround ( 1970s YES song) had a great experience and a 4-star lunch at this comfortable mainstay at 12 and Mound."}, {"review_id": "ABU3VbERRI91udZYi4tj4Q", "user_id": "GAXEqAhc95R9pdnVdib44g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/28/2017", "text": "Three and a half stars, really, but this was a pleasant discovery for us today.

You have to go to the back, pay for the the BBQ'd meat, then any sides you buy must be taken into the bar and picked up at the service window.  You then get a seat and get another server for drinks.  I'm a good tipper but being presented the opportunity to tip 3 times seems like a bit of overkill.Now the food.  We ordered a pulled pork sandwich, pork belly sandwich, and a side of mac and cheese and beans.We found we had two big complaints with the sandwiches.  1) They are doused with sauce and 2) The bun is very stale and crumbly.  I'd have like to sauce myself, and now I know if I go back.  I would much rather just have slices of white bread and make my own sandwich but it's not my place.The pork, It was smoked nicely, however it was very cold. I know bbq sits and that is part of the game but it wasn't even warm.  With that said, it was decent.The pork belly was sub par and we probably wouldn't order that one again.  It was pretty tough and just warm.The mac and cheese, is standard mac and cheese, nothing special or bad.The beans are the star of the show.  These are hot, lots of pork, creamy and would be something I'd order each time with our without bbq.I think with a few tweaks this could be a really good place."}, {"review_id": "oFKXEJ14qhaHFuRvFUYH0w", "user_id": "JQvtQmMBM0O2mgcZfayGYw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/23/2017", "text": "The best BBQ north of Tennessee!
