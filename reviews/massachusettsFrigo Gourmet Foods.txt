Don't get the half vienna, which is different bread, and too big anyway. The Italian meats are the star here. The sandwiches are meat-heavy and everything is melt-in-your-mouth tender and flavorful. Frigo's sandwiches compare in appearance to an authentic Philadelphia hoagie, but they are a different animal -- less balanced, more pure meat, but delicious in their own right. Don't bother comparing, Just enjoy."}, {"review_id": "jueJWZRERqb4f2Lc89ApKg", "user_id": "nrdkQO_tZJcoDNmGse7kHw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Unbelievably good authentic sandwich.

Whenever I'm visiting the northeast I seek these places out with a vengeance. Frigo is among the best I've found. Amazing assortment of Italian dinner classics ready to take home to \"make it a Frigo night.\" There's an awesome selection of sandwiches to choose from too, although it's easier to look at the paper laminated menu hanging from the display case than try and take in the enormous chalk board above the deli case. The meats are such high quality and all cut fresh. The bread is chewy and perfect. Forget chips, get a side of pasta salad or some olives.

We liked the atmosphere and decided to grab some lunch and some cheese & crackers (they were the fancy kind you find in Little Italy, sort of). I ordered the veggie lasagna, and as soon as I sat down outside to eat it, I realized it had chicken in it! I'm vegetarian, so this mattered to me. I went back inside, told them, and the apologized profusely and exchanged it for the pasta salad (pasta bows, mozz balls, arugula, shredded parm, roasted red peppers, and kalamata olives). All in all, I thought the pasta salad was delicious, the place is cool, and I'd come back despite the chicken glitch. I think that was an honest mistake and I won't hold it against this great little place."}, {"review_id": "otmUqhVIuROK0fdjfmF93g", "user_id": "LvxtsogJ3U3ljwtB8eF64Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Since moving to Springfield from VA, Frigo's is my go to sandwich spot.

I was nervous and curious at the same time about a sandwich with honey mustard and BBQ sauce. While the sandwich wasn't bad I don't know that I will be returning anytime soon.

The fresh prime rib carving station was a nice surprise, and the shear number of prepared options and sandwiches on the board was overwhelming. Factor in all the desserts, snacks, and wines on the shelves around the store and you can find anything you need for lunch or a quick take-home dinner.  I planned on only eating half of the sandwich and saving the rest for dinner, but that didn't happen and I don't even feel bad about it :)They seemed to be short-staffed for a Friday lunch rush, but our sandwiches were delicious so I really can't complain.  The cheese and wine tasting station was a little pushy, especially with someone sitting there telling everyone about the different types of cheese as we were in line to pay for our orders.

I ordered The Dante grinder (turkey, prosciutto, roasted red peppers, asagio cheese, and a bit of mayo) and it was amazing! The bread really made the sandwich though. Honestly I'll probably be back there tomorrow just to buy that bread. It's so much more than grinders though. They've got dinners, a HUGE food case with things like lasagna, chicken Marsala, all types of salad, even chicken and bacon Mac and cheese. Which I really should have gotten. The servings are extremely generous and the prices are incredible for the quality of food you're getting. I paid 7.95 for my 8 inch sandwich which can I guess seem like a lot (at least more than subway), but quality quality quality! I've included a photo so you can see how much meat was on it. They also have a grocery side of authentic Italian groceries.
