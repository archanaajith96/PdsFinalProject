The food was tasteful and delicious. Service was fast, friendly and helpful. Prices were great and portions good. Everything was great. I was even referred to here AFTER I had already gone by 'the mattress firm\" guy.  A total fan of this place.

Located on overland, between orchard and Curtis, this place was delightful. I was looking forward to having tostones (fried plantains) again. Haven't had them since I was a kid living in Puerto Rico. They weren't as good as I remember them being as a child. I'll have to pick up some plantains the next time I see them at the grocery store and make my own. We started with the tostones and Casablanca's chorizo croquetas. Described as \"six savory flour based rolls lightly breaded and fried to a golden brown. Available in three flavors: Ham, Cod fish, and Chorizo\". I love croquetas. The amazing ones from Bar Gernika/Manfreds come to mind. These were also delicious! Different, in a good way.I was going to order the Arroz con pollo (rice with chicken), but that's what my wife wanted to order, so I went with the ropa vieja. \"Affectionately called old clothes in Spanish. Shredded beef in Cuban creole sauce with onions and peppers. Served with white rice, black beans, and sweet ripe plantains.\" This was very good. The sauce made this exceptionally tasty. The beans were some of the best I have had in a while. The only downfall, again, was the plantains. Everything else was quite good. My wife's dish was delicious, and I got to try my father in law's cubano sandwich. Really quite delicious. I highly recommend this place if you want to try something a little different."}, {"review_id": "fwxQFS8qpzR7pbUFCGggrQ", "user_id": "jCF2lKTngLwbUt1dVg08nw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "This place is great!

I wish I could make chicken like this. I'm not a huge fan of chicken and will pretty much never order it at a restaurant but I heard that their's is the best and the pictures looked so I good I gave it a shot. It was so delicious.

Nothing wowed me that day and I didn't return. But I love Cuban food that I've experienced in Chicago and San Rafael, Calif., and finally decided to give Casa Blanca another chance. I ordered the Pollo frito a la Cubana, marinated chicken with garlic and lemon juice. It was served with rice and black beans and sweet plantains. The chicken was flavorful and tender and the black beans and plantains were also very good.

My friends all raved out how great the food was, etc. Went there on like a Saturday afternoon with my boyfriend, waiter seated us, gave us water and then disappeared. We waited about 30 minutes (mind you, there were two other tables and they were done, but the waiters were ALL talking to those tables and ignoring us) and then 30 after our order, got a Cuban sandwich. Ooo boi that sandwich was just straight salt between two pieces of bread. My boyfriend got a chorizo burger and showed me the patty...I kid you not it was a charred black thing the size of a silver dollar. Then we waited 30 more minutes, had to flag down two waiters to finally ask for the check. Then we waited at the cash register and no one was there either. All in all it was the worst dining experience of my life. I don't like ragging on restaurants but c'mon guys. Don't know if we went there on a REALLY off day, but I don't want to go back to test that theory."}, {"review_id": "2poa3RpigfuyY1cX0ZT0sg", "user_id": "YjJNgb2nJ1AcTvjnJpQehw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/15/2017", "text": "Best Cuban food I ever had.

The ropa vieja itself was good. The meat could have been more tender but acceptable. It just needed some salt for a little more flavor. The black beans broth was a little watery but still had good flavor. Beans were great. Not dry or chewy. Perfectly cooked. The platanos maduro (plantains) were sweet and soft but they were on the greasy side which gave me a slight acidic aftertaste when eating them. So they were fine. Just had to mask that aftertaste by eating them with the rest of the meal. Glad to see they offered Malta Hatuey to drink!Staff was very friendly. And I was short on time but it was no problem for them. They came out with my food about 10 min after ordering. I can see how this place is highly rated. Almost 5 stars. I'm being more critical with the food but can get how the locals would love this dish. If I had a chance to visit again, I'd definitely return to try their pork chops. Nice to see a Cuban restaurant in a place like Boise."}, {"review_id": "2Wmgps_UtLVSSHvj38_2Lw", "user_id": "Y8LY-2h_K222BDWMv-oWEQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/21/2017", "text": "I moved to Boise from Tampa, Florida (the Mecca of Cuban food) about a year ago. And thank god there is a Cuban restaurant in boise. And it's actually delicious! I've been a few times and have not been disappointed. The Cuban sandwich and roast pork are legit. The papas rellenas are a solid 3/5 (i'm a harsh critic on those since I used to eat some amazing ones in Tampa). Definitely try this place out! You won't be disappointed. Plus their weekday lunch special is a great price - only $6.99 for a half Cuban sandwich and soup.
