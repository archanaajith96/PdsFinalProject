I am so sorry I didn't try this restaurant my first day. I had the best Cubano sandwich I've ever eaten. Miami has nothing on this little place. All the food I saw others eat looks equally tremendous. By the looks on their faces the food is. This is a definite place to dine.

Since it was my first time the guy at the counter explained the menu and options available and was eager to answer any questions or make suggestions. The food was good, I got a beef empanada and the corn pancakes with side of eggplant instead of pork. The nata sauce was so good! The arepa we ordered was good but I had gotten it with the piccadillo salad. I wasn't the biggest fan of the salad in the arepa just too much tomatoes for my preference. Next time I have a better idea of what I would get in the arepa."}, {"review_id": "gO84cnPzEtuCEhbrwS-sgA", "user_id": "IbSjpOfxy2aIOfCgrC_4iw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "I'm sad to say we didn't love La Taguara. I've been wanting to go after seeing their strong Yelp reviews. I will say that I'm not a fan of fried food in general, so that probably colors this review. We walked up to the counter to order, and I was a little overwhelmed by the menu. There were some things I hadn't heard of before, so I wasn't sure what to get. The person working at the counter was not very friendly; she seemed irritated that I asked a question, and she was kind of cold when we asked a question about clean up later. (You bus your own table, which we were happy to do.)We got El Papu Venezolano for an appetizer. The beef empanadas were VERY good. Everything else that came with it honestly didn't have much flavor... it just tasted fried. It did come with three sauces (one sour cream, two traditional), but I didn't love those either. :( I got an arepa, and I didn't do a great job of picking what to go in it. I picked pork (very flavorful, but a bit too much pork for the size of the arepa), black beans (good), and cheese (nothing special and sort of stuck in the bottom). It was OK. My boyfriend got the Pabellón and also thought it was okay. Good, not great.  Maybe I had my hopes too high, and maybe I need to try again with a different order. Sad to be disappointed here since it otherwise seems so well loved!"}, {"review_id": "mZbnNmZdoI6GkaqJMTntyA", "user_id": "iwEmb0Ddq8wELeicJZcPnw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Damn, La Taguara is so good. I live in Milwaukee, but 75% of my (infrequent) Madison trips include a stop here. I've recommended them to two separate friends who both agreed they lived up to my hype.I'm guilty of being a repeat order-er here. Usually I'm not that type of person. But I get the Pabellon every time, I can't help it. I'm here so rarely and it's so good.  As someone who does not know Venezulean food, you get a nice variety of what it's about (and a lot of it). Their beef is juicy well seasoned perfection. On my last visit, I finally ordered something new- the fish coconut curry. Holy moly, it was delicious. It was actually my first time ever having FISH curry, so.. it was a big day for me. Flavors were spot on. I loved the picadillo salad and friend plantains. Seriously, make a stop here. Go with friends so you can try as many delicious menu items as possible."}, {"review_id": "evWlA2z-60-I4pjqfHIfZg", "user_id": "0OupmnUHBqWc0wOJg76J1Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/20/2017", "text": "This place is the very epitome of a hidden treasure. Forget the \"Caribbean\" and \"Columbian\" tags. This is a full-on Venezuelan restaurant to the core. (Want to know the national bird of Venezuela? There's a picture of one on the wall...) We recognized almost nothing on the menu, so the manager (owner?) recommended the \"two most popular items on the menu\", which were the pabellon and the cachapa, which we supplemented with an arepa. All were wonderful. The gentleman also asked if we liked spicy food, because Venezuelan food *isn't* spicy, so... they make their own hot sauce from scratch for people who like it spicier. If you're heat tolerant, do yourself a favor and ask for some. When he brought it to the table he said \"Be careful\", and he wasn't kidding. This stuff is not for people who find Tabasco challenging.If we lived nearby, this would definitely be one of our regular lunch places. And treating yourself isn't going to set you back very much either, with most dishes priced a bit over $10."}, {"review_id": "96H12M-71ju-VyWEXk2tfg", "user_id": "F4uTn9rxehO2g42sGM9tIA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "A slice of South America in Madison.If you've ever been to Central or South America, then you'll really appreciate this authentic cuisine...if you've never been come try it out. The food is fresh and plentiful. I ordered two of the Arepas (like a corn English muffin). One stuffed with shredded beef, pork and black beans; while the other was filled with chicken, cheese and beans. I was challenged to finish both as they were heaped full with the most tender-juicy fillings one could imagine. The guasacara (green sauce) is ridiculous! Not really spicy, just full of flavor. To drink I had Papelon con Limon (sugar cane drink with lime juice. Try it...you'll love it.The menu is extensive and the cashier is happy to explain it to help to make a selection.

So I bookmarked it and lo and behold, was able to stop in this past weekend.First, the location is super convenient - right off 30 & Washington. There's a small parking lot and a small, simply decorated eating area. You place orders at the counter and the friendly staff will happily walk you through the menu if you aren't familiar with the cuisine. Of course, we ordered empanadas (one beef, one chicken) - they're BIG. Two would make a meal - ours were well stuffed, full of flavor but perhaps a tad oily. Get them anyway, they're delicious. For mains, the Mister had cachapa which is a corn pancake filled with homemade cheese and served with fried pork chunks. Very tasty but FILLING! I went with pabellon which is rice, black beans and stewed beef. It reminded me of Cuban ropa vieja - tender beef stewed with peppers, so delicious especially when mixed up with the rice and amazingly tasty black beans. Seriously, those beans are everything - I'd happily order beans and rice as a meal.Prices are cheap (most things $10-12), portions are huge (my entree could easily have fed 2) and it's delicious.

This place is a must. Authentic Venenzuelan/ Colombian food. Service is great. Bathrooms are clean. Ample parking space. Restaurant is clean with simple decorations. My favorite is the chicharrones with yucca fries. This is a must order. Also ordered the arepas which is great and huge servings. Their passion fruit juice is really good. I tried the tamarind juice but I prefer the passion fruit. I will definitely come back here again and try their empanadas and order the chicharoness appetizer again.

Once inside, the interior is familiar from Caribbean and Colombian places with bright yellow walls. The menu is up on a digital display screen. Everything o the menu looked delicious.For our appetizer, we ordered the rompe colchon, which is a lot more food than it looks. This is a very rich shrimp salsa that you use as a dip for plantain chips. It was quite intensely flavored, perhaps a bit too rich, so make sure you share with at least one other person.For entree, I did the Bandejita Paisa, which is almost a sampler platter of everything with beef, pork belly, chorizo, egg, platanos maduros, rice, pinto beans, avocado, cheese, and arepa. This was an enormous amount of food, especially for the price.Wife ordered the Camarones al Ajillo, which was sautéed garlic shrimp with salad, tostones, and guasacaca (similar to guacamole). She loved it.Given the super casual setup, good prices, and delicious food; I have to give it 5-stars. Definitely check it out for a unique change of pace in Madison."}, {"review_id": "8xlhe1RAsXdArZPKZdH-Zw", "user_id": "VFy1bWR93nTv2jFStql6vg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/1/2017", "text": "Wow.

My best empanadas so far. Ordered from the lunch menu, 1 beef and 1 chicken. I love the pastry on the empanadas- slightly crispy on the outside, once you bite through, you get the ingredients (shredded chicken or ground beef) without tasting the dough. Very nicely done. The soup of the day I had was noodles and tomatoes. Very clean taste and not salty. I liked it. Another observation was the clientele. There were people of all ethnicities; a true American joint serving Venezuela food!Overall, I recommend this place."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-taguara-madison?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
