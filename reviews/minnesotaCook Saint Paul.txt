Cook is part of a wave of really good restaurants popping up along the main road. From the outside it doesn't appear to be anything beyond maybe a local coffee spot or small diner, but inside it holds many amazing secrets. The menu is changing as of 3/1/2018, so my reviews of food may be slightly out of date. We recently went to a dinner that claimed they focus on \"in season and locally sourced foods.\" Being from CA where farm to table is all the rage I was excited to try it. It was a let down. I was losing hoping that the twin cities had a good locally sourced/slow food place. Then we came to Cook. Cook is a mutt of a restaurant, and I mean that in the best way possible. It is one part diner, one part Korean, and one part Mexican/Latino. It takes delicious elements from each style and blends them in fun and creative ways. To start with we did the curry carrot cake muffin and a cinnamon roll. The curry carrot cake muffin was good, but carrot cake is more of my husband's thing. I liked the addition of curry though because it added some nice zest. The cinnamon roll though, my god the cinnamon roll. The thing was the size of a frisbee. Seriously, this could be your breakfast or it needs to be split with like two-three other people. It was delicious though! There was a slight crispy outer shell but the center was still slightly doughy.   The frosting wasn't overwhelmingly sweet either. I couldn't stop myself from eating the whole thing. I went with the \"trust me\" as my main. It is kimchi (for those not in the know, kimchi is basically fermented cabbage with spices) and home made peanut butter. Sounds gross right? I'm all about weird and out there food combos, so I was all about this. It came on really good (what I assume is home made) Texas toast style bread. The kimchi was burn your mouth down hot in the best way possible. I didn't think Minnesota was capable of making things that spicy. The peanut butter added a really nice richness and depth to the kimchi. It was a combination I would never expect.The service was friendly and prompt. It felt very much like a local neighborhood joint. Very warm, friendly, and welcoming. It felt like you were eating in someone's home and they were so happy to feed you. They used to do Friday Korean dinners here, but now they do Friday pop up nights. I think that is really cool because it lets chefs stretch their creative muscles. I can't wait to check one of them out. The menu is changing on 3/1/2018, but I hope they keep the trust me. Kimichi and peanut butter is a combo I just can't forget. 4/100"}, {"review_id": "J6X5UB6M7HP9072cWY5JRQ", "user_id": "ZKr4YuXdzq41sVk-_29k-w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "I came here for Dine out for Life, as they participate, but now I really want to come back and try more of their menu and not just breakfast because my visit for the event was great! First off, the place is small and seems very local. Lots of visitors seemed familiar to the worker helping them, but I felt just as welcomed as the regulars. Our service was very friendly and helpful the whole time. For food, my mom and I split two because we couldn't choose so we ended up with an omelet (with hashbrowns) and some of the orange french toast. The omelet was great. The texture was great and the cheese was incorporated really well. The french toast was good, the flavor of it was great, but I might pass on it next time to try more things because it didn't wow me as much in texture as the flavor did. The bread was just a bit dryer or denser than expected? But that was very minor!The star though was the dang hashbrowns! Good, griddle-top hashbrowns are like a constant search for me and these were great. Good crunchy layer on top and lots of spices and flavor incorporated in. Check them out for sure. I'll be back."}, {"review_id": "BqM3lOtU2plY96pIf2P6_g", "user_id": "XcVOxggK6WCWzcKRpx-YNA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "I ordered the Korean pancakes with hash browns and a glass of orange juice. I haven't had Korean pancakes before but I thought they tasted particularly dry. The hot sauce at the table was delicious but couldn't offset how dry they were. I also ordered a side of hash browns which were good but a little on the salty side.On the bright side we were able to find a table right away.  It's a quaint little spot with nice decor inside. Based on the other reviews I will definitely be giving this place another try but maybe ordering a different dish next time. Despite the slight disappointment with the food, the staff were kind and attentive. In their defense I didn't mention my disappointment with the food and I'm sure they would have made it right. Other notes: street parking, one bathroom inside."}, {"review_id": "dvnNFrihw5LmNQUdhuadVA", "user_id": "kfn3-f0la9Lei0qWZ0ajMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Cook Saint Paul got a new menu on March 1st, so of course we had to check it out. I got the Migas, which has tortilla strips, black beans, scrambled eggs, salsa, and shredded cabbage and it was absolutely delicious. Super filling but doesn't weigh you down like a pancake breakfast might. My friend got the Korean Fried Chicken with a side of fries and loved it! The fries are incredibly fresh and perfectly salted. Add a little of the gochujang seasoning that sits on the table for an awesome touch. Food at Cook is great and I love supporting this local spot!"}, {"review_id": "7JHxoW3BPsqqjfpka_lOAg", "user_id": "rJ1AyDWiJTr1WqoJVxqx3A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "This immediately became one of my favorite restaurants in the state!

If your answer is \"no\", think again, because Cook Saint Paul has this combination down pat.Believe me, I was a skeptic too. Granted, I don't think you can say that just adding kimchi, Gochujang, pickled daikon, and sesame seeds to an otherwise American dish would make a dish Korean, but the flavor profiles do go well together at Cook. My brothers and I ordered Chicken and a Cake, a Korean omelet, and Korean pancakes, and they were all delicious. The buttermilk pancake on the Chicken and a Cake was okay, but the Gochu BBQ sauce was good. The Korean omelet was good, but maybe a little overwhelmed with the amount of kimchi in the actual omelet. The Korean pancakes definitely had a bite to it, with the spicy sausage and cabbage, although the heat was tempered with the addition of the poached eggs on top. Their homemade gochujang was pretty good too, although all three of our dishes didn't really benefit from it as they all were spicy enough.Since the door is right next to the dining area, if you're at tables near the door, it can get a little chilly. Service was prompt and we were seated quickly. If Korean flavors aren't your thing, there are other options on the menu that are your more traditional American diner fare, but where else can you find American dishes with a Korean spin on it? Either way, I'm sure you can't go wrong."}, {"review_id": "zAI4-87S8-64HtH-heMrwA", "user_id": "vLn5BGb_8wzmEvsgwZC3RQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "All you need to know is GET THE MAC N CHEESE!  I saw this dish featured on the Today Show and I get why it got that much hype.  I don't love the usual gooey, over-cooked noodle combo that is considered mac n cheese at most places so if you're looking for that, this is not for you. This dish has tons of flavor- Korean spices, kimchi, sharp cheddar and cream.  My husband got it with bacon and he had to play a lot of fork defense to keep me away from it.  I got the Migas breakfast... pretty good, but I still had serious food envy.  I declared that the next time I run a half marathon, I will be going there for my celebratory caloric meal!The only down side was the wait on food.  We had a small weight for a table (15mins? at 12:30 on a Sunday), but it took about 40 mins to get our food.  Still worth the wait, but don't come hangry."}, {"review_id": "4HAIMvn992p8eBIyokaPnw", "user_id": "rnOkbZU_dOu3WLAjLmtugg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "This is my favorite place to have breakfast/brunch in twin cities. Parking is not that difficult to find although not designated. The main server/hostess is one of the most welcoming server I have come across. She is cheerful, gregarious and funny yet gives you space. She makes this experience extraordinarily good. Now coming to food. From routine breakfast items to some unique amalgamation of Korean, kimchi options are scrumptious. Don't forget to try Korean pancakes ( they are savory ). Hot sauce is phenomenal. My friend tried their cheese burger and was thoroughly impressed too.

They have a small, industrial decorated space with room for a couple of groups, so keep this in mind if you plan to visit. Service was very friendly, informative and attentive. Vibes are comfortable and laid back. No need to wear your church clothes. But, about the Mac and Chi. Where do I even begin? What a refreshingly creative dish! I absolutely loved the kimchi and cheese combination. It was rich, creamy and spicy - not overbearing. The cavatappi is the perfect noodle compliment as I found myself madly forking at pieces with the most cheese and kimchi wedged in between its rings. The green onions helped with balance - both visually and tastefully. Portion size was MASSIVE. I was able to save a good amount for tomorrow's lunch while still being extremely full for that day. This was seriously so savory and satisfying - I highly recommend it to my fellow pasta carb-loving and/or spicy food loving friends. The only negative is that Monday through Friday, Cook St Paul is only open until 2pm, which doesn't work for my 9am - 5pm slave life. But, I am more than willing to start off my weekends with the Mac and Chi as they are open from 7am until 3pm.

This is not a typical diner. My mistake was that was what I was looking for something more like Magnolias. You have to be in the mood to try something new. 3 Stars means It's OK. I wouldn't go out of my way to stop in again. But it was worth trying once. I prefer Magnolias. The dining area is elbow room only. If you are big or tall you might be uncomfortable. I would describe the décor as very liberal and something hipsters would appreciate. I am just OLD at 36 and feel like I prefer boring décor. As I get older I do like quieter and spacious eating quarters. For atmosphere it's a solid 3.Now the food: I don't normally like hollandaise sauce. My boyfriend had the short rib eggs benedict. The hollandaise was mild. The beef was brisket textured and very beefy flavor. I had the chicken and pancakes. I loved the chicken wings made from the homemade hot sauce. It was a perfect blend of spicy, sweet, tangy and crunchy. I could have just have 10 of these without the pancake and been pretty content. I'd come back for these wings!The wings were fresh and hot out of the fryer. I had to blow on them a little before really chowing down. No food safety issues here that is for sure. 5 for the wings!Pancakes were ok. Pancakes didn't stand out and neither did the syrup. It was not as fluffy and flavorful as my boyfriend makes at home. :)3 for PancakesThe Service:Service was decent. They were friendly and efficient for the most part. I was worried they wouldn't take credit card but they did. Thank goodness since I don't carry cash.For service I'd give it a 3.5Ladies... There is only one bathroom at the entrance... Wash your hands and go potty before coming here.. I ended up just going home with sticky fingers from my yummy wings. Wet wipes are helpful!I recommend coming early...
