The sushi lunch special comes with miso soup, Asian salad, and 2 rolls. It comes to $10.71 with tax, and it is a ton of food. I always tell myself I'm not going to eat all of it, but it's so good that I end up eating it all. I normally get the crunch cali and crunch yum rolls. It's so good, and they offer a small free ice cream at the end!The service is always great, and the sushi is always incredible. My favorite appetizer is also the tiny spring roll. It's perfect size. My husband likes sushi but doesn't love it as much as me, but he's a big fan of this place. I really can't say enough good things about this place. What are you waiting for? Go check it out!"}, {"review_id": "_qBkfUD8f7w7OgUcvkSWGw", "user_id": "lZbotco47bHU7oE5b3d1DA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/21/2017", "text": "Started off with yum yum roll and it was yummy!  Then had chef special and could have eaten three more orders!Absolutely perfect food at reasonable prices.

We got seaweed salad and miso soup as well as a variety of sushi pieces and rolls. Everything was fresh and the presentation was great. I particularly liked the octopus, yellow tail, and red snapper. I am very fond of eel and I got the Dragon Roll which is a whole eel over a California roll. It was amazing! They offer a large variety of sushi as well as a menu of many other food choices. i wish I found this place sooner. I will be a repeat customer."}, {"review_id": "fSNZFJWRRjRtdr44UF7GLw", "user_id": "_VKyCOvtRfyLzrMDxZev9Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2017", "text": "This has always been our go to sushi place, we have tried other spots, but we always seem to come back here. Mostly because the quality of the food, and the great prices. They make sure to cover anyone's sushi needs rather you have $5 or $50 to spend. Service is always served with a smile, and attentive waitstaff. The chefs are true masters at what they do, the atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming.

There was one roll that we had that was warm- like it was cooked or something but it was very strange and we didn't like it. I wish I could remember what it was called but ask your server if it's served warm and if they say yes choose another. It was very weird."}, {"review_id": "OaGcDAbQ_uJA9MxagNY2zw", "user_id": "qMl6VlVy9qeg6q_VWjF-6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/12/2017", "text": "This place was amazing. My husband had me yelp a place to check out on our road trip, it was a little off the path, but worth it.The wait staff are very friendly, greeting you the moment you walk in the door. Someone else brought soup and salad.My favorite roll of all time (sweet potato roll) wasn't on the menu, I asked if they could make it. They did!!!!!! It was AMAZING!!!!!!!! My only regret is not ordering more. I got the chicken Katsu lunch bento box. It was delicious. The waitress said they might Add sweet potato roll to the menu!!! Definitely check this place out if you like good food."}, {"review_id": "yYk549itE6DaiGQ05K1p4A", "user_id": "89I9x66k94PA_SdTdKCqkA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/26/2017", "text": "Best sushi we've had since moving! We were passing though on our way back to Joplin and called in to carry out (only 5min before arrival). They were very quick, but after being welcomed so warmly (including a free sample) and seeing the quaint lil place, we decide to open our to go box and eat there. The staff were so sweet and had no objections but instead brought us drinks and warm miso soup to accompany out \"picnic style\" meal. We really enjoyed the sample of Sam's roll and will defiantly order next time we come through town!

The Mama Sang is my regular order, but every once in a while I order the Fire Roll. Yum!!! It's never really busy when I go which makes for a great atmosphere. The staff is friendly, but sometimes they forget refills or take a little while to get back around to your table. That's my only critique for Sakura! The sushi is fresh, delicious, and is sure to fill you up for a reasonable price. I highly recommend this restaurant."}, {"review_id": "HGHITu4qQZ8VmlEwP_NIPQ", "user_id": "1wkkI_mFTL01pcgWjHFGdA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/10/2017", "text": "Customer service was ok, they treated me nicely but didnt look happy or it was a long day for them. The sushi guys immediately greeted me. Surprised me with a sushi sample. I ordered water first and then followed up with a imported beer. I always do my normal rolls to test the place. I ordered my Spicy Tuna Roll and Rainbow Roll. The rolls were quite small. I was impressed with both rolls. The spicy tuna was actually a bit spicy. Ive tried many many spicy tuna rolls and sometimes the spice isnt even there. The rainbow roll is a bit small but had a great amount of fish on top which made up for it. The dish came out with no ginger or wasabi. They ask you if you want these 2. Which is smart to save from wasting. But this is the first place to not give you it with your order from the start.  And yes I do eat the ginger, and use the wasabi. After finishing, they offered me ice cream on the house. My choices were strawberry or coffee flavor. Of course I went with strawberry. This place wasnt anything special besides getting a sample roll and ice cream. Yelp seem to make this place awesome, but its just okay to me. It is definitely not terrible or the best. Just average.

That day was my friend's birthday and he likes this restaurant a lot. I ordered salmon terriyakki and ichiban chicken maybe it's combo menu. There are some fruits and salad chun-kyun, too. It's enough to me. The taste of that foods is okay. But i don't think that it seems like japanese sushi. (Personal experience!) but the price is notmuch expensive. But the location is a little hard to find. And the atmoshpere is not bad, there are many people. A little loud but it's okay. After eating foods, they gave an ice cream.

The SAM roll was good. It was a bit spicier than I like but I am not into spicy that much.  The food came out quickly and was delish! I had the Chicken Bento box and my husband had the Beef Highgate.
