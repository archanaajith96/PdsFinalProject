I'm seriously in a toss us over who has the best brunch on the Oceanfront here or Pocahontas. I love that this is place is a renovated house. It really gives a homey feel, I honestly forgot I was sitting in a restaurant (But that also could've been the two $2.50 mimosas I gulped down while waiting for our food to come out.) Haha The right side breakfast was very simplistic; however, it was some of the most delicious breakfast food I've ever eaten. The chocolate chip pancakes were BOMB. Light, fluffy, and full of chocolate.If you haven't already, you must expierence Doc Taylor's for brunch if you're an HRVA resident or find yourself in the area visiting."}, {"review_id": "p3WBCfpKh08Q1Xa1z4c0Zw", "user_id": "pmX_OHLkQ8n3DPC8ZmKErA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "I came here for brunch with some girlfriend.  It's usually pretty busy here on the weekends so we had a 30 minute wait which we didn't mind since we were enjoying their yummy mimosas.... their Bloody Marys are really good too.Sorry I didn't take any pics of my order...by the time we were seated I was buzzed...$2.50/glass..so I forgot to snap a pic. Food was ok.We had a good time... the only thing I thought was kind of inconvenient is the one person bathroom and nowhere for you to stand without being in someone's way.Nice outside patio that you can chill on when weather permits."}, {"review_id": "mlY4mlBgYUkcxhNUsvW6fA", "user_id": "GY0S7A5qmCES-BiQ9C8zmg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "Went here the other day with a friend.

Only a short walk from the boardwalk. It doesn't look like a returning from the outside and inside is very cosy like if you were eating a meal in your own home. We went for breakfast and were seated upon arrival.  The wait staff was awesome and super friendly. The food was great. I ordered a custom omelet and my friend ordered the sausage and gravy. Bother came out perfect. I would recommend this for family and small groups but they dinning rooms are not very large as the restaurant is inside a house. Seems like a great local spot.

First of all it's in a cute little house. So very charming. The kitchen/grill is open so you can see the chef cooking up s storm; I like that. I had the flatliner Fried egg, bacon, cheese and Parmesan tomato on an onion roll really really good. The accompanying potatoes with old bay seasoning were done just right. This was awesome good. We added sweet potato pecan pancakes just because we were on vacation and figured why not...I must say yummmmmy not too sweet just flavor up the wazoo! Go here for breakfast.

You may be shocked by the significant wait times, but it will be worth every minute of the wait. The atmosphere is very welcoming and cozy, sort of like going to your Grandma's house. They leave the front doors open. It's not fancy and small tables are sort of pushed together to create larger tables. But it was the best breakfast we had in Virginia Beach. I ordered the \"The Right Side\" breakfast which consisted of two pancakes, eggs, and bacon. I opted for chocolate chip pancakes. It was definitely a good choice. I was surprised by the variety of pancake flavor options. My boyfriend ordered \"The Doc Taylor\" which was essentially a bacon, egg, cheese, and tomato sandwich. He loved it. I've never seen him eat anything so fast in my life. For drinks we ordered Mimosas and they were good and cheap. No complaints about the food or drinks. I can't wait to come back!!"}, {"review_id": "k2UkWWXtTmpGW1adePVCtA", "user_id": "G9N61V6yE-zcOCCyf1Uypg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "This place has been a local staple for as long as I can remember.

No worries- they have unhealthy options as well:) Their coffee is great. Atmosphere is cool. You don't feel like you are in a restaurant. The kitchen is open so you can see them cooking your meal.

While it's not a bad place to enjoy your breakfast or lunch, you shouldn't go out of your way to eat here. The good things that stand out are the decent prices and the friendly staff. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable which goes well with its proximity to the beach. The food arrived quickly which was good since it's took over 40 minutes to seat us. Aside from that, there isn't much else. The food is enjoyable but is the same as other restaurants in the area and the portions are average.TLDR; Friendly staff, great service and price.

Surprisingly, so did my girlfriends french fries, which were also golden crispy and done right.  Her sub was tasty and was on-par with any sub of the same type I've had from any other restaurant.Friendly atmosphere and good service.  When we're in town again, we will certainly stop in for more options on the menu."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/doc-taylors-virginia-beach?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
