Who knew alligator sausage was so good?  I had it the prior day on a sandwich at Jazz Fest but what they do to it in this gumbo is so sexy that it should be rated XXX. Finally, the bread pudding alone is reason enough to go here, and make sure you get it warm.  The rum sauce should be illegal it's so good.  I could drink it all by itself.  It is a perfect combination with the warmth of the bread pudding, and they aren't stingy with it either. Parkway is, needless to say, where it, all of it, is at.  Thanks for helping me close out a truly stellar weekend to one of my favorite cities with a smile and a full belly.  See you next time.

There's ample seating for you to perch where you please. I love that the tables and chairs are made of white plastic.I'm no connoisseur of po boy sandwiches and I'm not so in tune with the intricate flavors of Southern food. #Nolanewbie. So? I'm here to tell you that my food was delicious and dog gone enjoyable.I had the 5 inch fried shrimp sandwich. It could've used some more dressing to keep things moist (bread and breading needs sawwwce), but otherwise it was blissful. Light on filling (lettuce strips, tomato, pickles), the sandwich's focus was on the shrimp. You never lose sight of that throughout the grubbing process. And don't be mislead. A 5 inch sandwich is by no means \"small\". It'll keep you full.The chili was pretty standard, complete with cheese and onions if you please. It came out warm and would've been better if hot. Just my personal preference.If only I ran into President Obama there.."}, {"review_id": "IZdAgtlLiG6tOQExMkIsEA", "user_id": "WwmWdDCJREohcxQqfnOL-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "First place we visited in New Orleans after checking into our AirBnB and it was definitely a great local tip.

I followed my local friend's advice and got the surf and turf, which was a heavenly combination of roast beef and fried shrimp covered in debris (or gravy).  If you get this one, think about skipping the lettuce and tomato because they are just stomach fillers, and definitely skip the mayo.Finally, wash it all down with a Barq's root beer in a glass bottle.  And there you have the perfect lunch in New Orleans."}, {"review_id": "ezi9DozXq8eFagIzuB5hkQ", "user_id": "jfP512Pt6pjRHGw8UlyHGw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "This place was surprisingly occupied right before closing time on a weekday. It was probably around 9:30 pm when I got my order in, and there was still jovial chatter floating though the crisp night's air. Although maybe only half the seats were actually filled, it sounded like the place was crowded because of all the festive conversation that was being had. The line was long, especially for that time of night, but it moved pretty quickly, and we got our food quickly as well.Golden fried shrimp po' boy - delicious! The shrimp was some simple breaded shrimp, yet it was so crispy and flavorful, perfectly apt for an overall uncomplicated and yet amazingly tasty sandwich. The shrimp was seasoned with some simple flavors and spices, which was done perfectly. And the lettuce and tomato added just the right amount of crispiness and juiciness. I could see myself eating tons of these sandwiches on a daily basis and not getting bored at all!I regret that I didn't get to try any of their other po' boys, as I imagine they are also simple and yet wonderful.
