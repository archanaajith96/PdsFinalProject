Lol...  The pepperoni slices were on point.  They had the perfect flavor...the real deal kind of pepperoni!  You know what I mean! :)Service wise, they were phenomenal.  The hostess and waiter treated us like we were the only ones in the restaurant, showing that they really care for your experience there and value their customers.  I even saw them speaking with other tables like they were old friends!  There is just so much on the menu that I still need to try, so WE WILL be coming back!  Especially since it's now on my favorites list for pizza!!I definitely recommend it!!"}, {"review_id": "0hoDEVmT69ZnF3woaKG3Mg", "user_id": "XbVH_vnLNm3V2iAFxL-qBg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "I had heard about this pizza from a co-worker so I really wanted to try it out. When I checked in on yelp I received a 30% discount which was a really nice surprise!! The establishment is small and pleasing to the eye. The oven is the centerpiece of the establishment. I was greeted with great service and was offered a whiff of the truffle oil before I purchased La Porcini pizza. Even though the oil has a pungent odor, I still wanted to try this pizza because I love mushrooms. And I wasn't disappointed! The flavor was ahmazing! The toppings were just sliding off the thin crust and I was piling them back on just as fast! I got my daughters the Hawaii 5-0 pizza and the chef added sauce to it and didn't add the hot peppers for me. It was really flavorful and sweet. Ok, now the one negative...I REALLY want to give this pizza 5 stars, but there was one important aspect that me and my family didn't enjoy...the crust was too burnt. It was a strong burnt taste and we had to throw the end pieces of the crust away. I loved the consistency of the dough...it was thin and airy. I am hoping it was just a one-time situation and I'd like to give them another shot and see if I have a different experience with the crust."}, {"review_id": "sV6yMYdWndkUcYFuSI-XJg", "user_id": "xybB1cweh83ecXHh1ZL6pg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Don't miss it. Inspired dishes created by a Chef  who obviously has a passion for delicious and authentic Italian cuisine. Great atmosphere and friendly service. Pizza came out quick but not rushed, and we were not rushed. You can safely get a fairly quick meal (think lunch) here or have a proper \"dining\" experience with a multi course meal.I tried the Pizza del Papa (The Pope's Pizza)Created by Chef Antonio Starita and served to Pope John Paul II. Roasted butternut squash crema, smoked mozzarella, zucchini, roasted red peppers, fresh basil, and romano cheese. A masterpiece of a pizza recreated right here in Chesapeake.

You are all right! As someone who who will take her pizza any way I can get it, I have to say that traditional Neopolitan Pizza is in a league of their own. The sauce here is perfection, slightly tangy, not too sweet and perfectly seasoned. Put it in a jar and pour it over some pasta and I would still be happy. The crust is light and airy without making you feel fat after eating a whole pizza by yourself (confession). I came on a Friday night with a group and we were able to get a table with no wait (you wont always be that lucky).  I was delighted to hear that they allow you to have 2 different types of pizza on one crust, as long as the \"base\" is the same (Olive Oil, No Sauce, etc.). I ordered half Napoletana and half Capricciosa. These are great options for people who typically order a Supreme or Pepperoni at your standard pizza place and want that \"safety net\" of relate ability but knowing that you are going to get much more flavor! As a Chesapeake resident I am happy to see this place flourishing and I will definitely be back to try their other non pizza options."}, {"review_id": "is-J39y35MuPIe_dJBIEEg", "user_id": "uBstCgBKai7zsryamPLjWQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "I didn't know what to expect.

I got the Marinara pizza which was really great with basil, oregano, fresh mozzarella and garlic. It was really good and the crust was very tasty.
