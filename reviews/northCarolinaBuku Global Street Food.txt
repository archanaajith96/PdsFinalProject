We've been about 4 or 5 times now because once we went, we couldn't stop going back. We have ordered almost everything from the small plates section and there wasn't one thing I didn't like. Some of my favorites are: chicken empandas, mussels, crab flautas and the pork buns. We came here with my boyfriend's parents and spent about 4 hours here because they wanted to keep ordering food! I was stuffed by the time we left. While it is very good, doing the small plates can get pretty pricy. There are a few small plates on their menu for $14-$15. I would say it is a good place for a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary. I think their menu in the restaurant must be different than the one online because it looks like there are some items missing online. They offer way more than what is posted on their website."}, {"review_id": "P7ad-0EEN4iHKIrneSROHA", "user_id": "WxRbCUmBObaAxHaZ_49-Lw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I went there for a group dinner with a pre selected menu so didn't get to try anything I might have wanted tooThat said the selection was wonderful and both the vegetarian and regular menu options were very well received.  I honestly can't remember the menu item names as it was buffet style but anything on the plate got eaten and was well liked by the group.  Beer menu was a little light.  Not a lot on draft and most area beers were in bottle.  Would rather it be the other way national generic crap can be in a bottle."}, {"review_id": "FlhheZ9olZwS1kq-79fIxA", "user_id": "nz5tOk3njk4l-S4Cb9c2AA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Ambience : This is a rather fancy place - which I didn't realize as we walked around Raleigh and happened upon buku. It was interesting to note that though there were a couple of tables with people in very casual clothes, the latter dinner crowd came in dresses and ties. I wasn't made to feel out of place in my post hiking t shirt and jeans. Food: It felt as though the menu was mostly Inspired by Asian food. We ordered :1. Pierogies : good pastry! Very cheesy but not overbearing. It was good, but I wouldn't order again. 2. Afghan Mantu : This was not vegetarian but my bf loved it and highly recommends it. Says the flavoursand texture of the wrap were delightful. 3. Aloo Channa Chaat : I had a tough time with this. The taste was good, and it was like home style flavours but given the fusion nature of the restaurant and the ambience it portrayed I would've like a little bit of surprise. Or some twist. It was just too normal for me. 4. Banh Xeo - entree : it was a really good crepe with some nicely flavored veggies and tofu. I enjoyed it , but the plate should've been a bit larger to accommodate the overflowing nature of the food. 5. Samosa Pot Pie : This was delicious! Loved the flavours and the pie crust!Dessert : went for the Filipino Halo Halo and it was absolutely one of the best dessert I've ever had. Ube ice cream was nice and creamy and good toppings that melded in with the dish. Loved it. A+Service : our waiter was really nice. A solid check in very now and then, friendly, not overly intrusive. They cleared out frequently and boxed my leftovers. Verdict : would go again And definitely get halo halo. It's on the expensive side so this was a nice treat for us."}, {"review_id": "Gn_D25qPQDzYNjxkKCWWtg", "user_id": "9WZbTtvRdbX4Cm27IQQgNQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Alright first of all, I just had high expectations coming to this place so maybe thats why I rated lower than others have. This place is fancy. Super upscale so I would dress a little better than casual coming here. I came for my birthday and everyone was hyping up the food so I went ahead and ordered everything I could. Got some edamame, duck duck larb, hot pot, and an appetizer. I feel that for the price the dish sizes were small. But then again most upscale restaurants do that. The hot pot had a lot of coconut. I am a huge fan of that but for others who do not like it, I would recommend not getting it. I shared it with someone and I didn't think it was enough but there other people at my table shared it and it was plenty for them. Overall the dishes were pretty average to me. They didn't really fill me up. Just thinking about the price when ordering another dish killed me. If you're not one to eat a lot then this place can be good for you. I'll have to come back and give it another try."}, {"review_id": "-fQABiJrIRg8Vxy620wqvw", "user_id": "cfMgTfD4TkPhjdTd6OfYCQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "I came to Buku one Sunday for brunch with a friend. Apparently we chose the wrong weekend to go because there was some race going on in the area that made parking feel like a game of musical chairs. Eventually we prevailed. The brunch at Buku is $25 per person which may sound like a lot to some but I felt it was a reasonable price based on the variety of dishes they offer.While they market this as a \"global brunch buffet,\" ironically I felt the global part is where they fell a little flat. Some of these dishes were exciting in name, but fell  short in flavor. Specifically, there was a Jamaican sweet potato dish that was lacking salt, and some Asian dishes that didn't have enough seasoning (although my friend said she really liked the dumplings - I didn't try those).The more traditional fare you'd expect for brunch (e.g. waffles, muffins, omelets) they did a pretty good job with, but I can get that from somewhere else for less. Nothing was mind-blowing or particularly memorable with the exception of a creamed truffle kale dish. That was delicious.Overall, I don't regret going but it's not a place that I feel like I need to go back to again."}, {"review_id": "Hlu_Ibf6j72YVVfK1VLtAA", "user_id": "Nf_BiLj3gK2bdFQqgCTICA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "Vegetarian:I've been here twice now and been underwhelmed each time. I've had the ginger pear salad, Filipino deviled eggs, edamame, pierogi, chocolate souffle, and the Pad Thai. All of it is overpriced and the portions of the small plates are too small. The Pad Thai has a very strange flavor that I did not enjoy at all, it's priced at 17$.Vegan:They have about 10 vegan menu items. All of them that I've had are mediocre at best. Watch out because some items that are seemingly vegan, like pad Thai, are not because they put egg in it. I'm sure you can ask the waiter to exclude it though. Just make sure to read the descriptions. Service:Each time, my waiter has been extraordinarily friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. They saved the restaurant from a 1 star rating. Recommendations:This restaurant overrated, overpriced, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Some of the food borders on disgusting. Both times I went was because someone wanted to have an upscale birthday dinner so I couldn't complain.

I can't give this place any less than 4 stars because I really enjoyed my perogie, their beer selection, and the friendly service. Their menu is very eclectic and showcases a variety of dishes from across the globe. My only qualm is that Buku is super pricey. Like I said, even though my perogie was tasty, in the end, it's only flour, cheese, and potatoes. It shouldn't cost more than $4 per perogie (even that is a little steeper than what I am used to). Also, I've never seen Bibambap cost $25 before. I would understand the cost if there was some crazy twist on traditional street food that made it super gourmet, but there just isn't...It's a beautiful restaurant and perfect for a first date with someone you really like, but I am just not convinced that the quality of the dishes warrants those prices."}, {"review_id": "59F8dn0O8wVPj21SlYf9HQ", "user_id": "MmQv7nXo3EKVW6ZbFBZ08A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/4/2017", "text": "Buku is a solid option for dinner! I always find myself enjoying dinner, but the price is a bit to high for me. The majority of the large plates are $30+ and you can mix and match with small plates, but it still adds up. It feels like every time I'm going out with a large group the reservations has been made at Buku. It is a plus that a downtown location can hold such large groups, but it can get a little repetitive. Buku has a \"party\" room in the back which is great, but can get quite loud when there is more than one celebration going on. I will say that the staff is clearly use to handling large parties as the service has always been spot on even with a group of 10+! On my most recent visit I ordered the steak. It came with a fig compote that I wasn't a big fan of, but the steak itself was seasoned well. I ordered it medium rare and it came out medium. My husband always gets the bimbimbap and loves it every time. I've tried quite a few small plates as well and haven't been disappointed including the empanadas and poke. On my last visit I learned they no longer do complimentary valet which is a total bummer.
