Learned menu essentially the same. Extremely friendly and helpful service; love the self-serve nacho bar;On to the food: chicken tacos al carbon were very good (tortillas served separately so construct your own) and my wife loved her flautas (rolled tacos). Manager stopped by for a friendly conversation, learned that we were out of towners and sent us away with some chips and delicious cheese queso to go.Lots of dogs in the patio area (thus the name of the place), and  a really friendly and relaxed atmosphere. We want to return on our next cross-country drive and have dinner here."}, {"review_id": "4A-COo5OdD9hEV5kjCzhgQ", "user_id": "xOZmlipuC8SSREVspj3hhQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "This place is jamming! We came here on a Tuesday evening around 6pm and it was packed. People were outside waiting, but we had reservations so we got seated quickly. First off, the chips and salsa are self serve and so good. My favorite salsa was tomatillo. The chips are very good and have a nice crunch to them. My friend ordered the house margarita, which is a wine based margarita. I got to taste it, it was fine but we all agreed it needed the alcohol instead of wine. I ordered a beer, the Bosque IPA they had in tap. Three of us decided to share the large taco place that came with \"10\" tacos, guacamole, with our choice of meet, plus bean and rice. We ordered a side order of beans and rice since three of us were sharing. It ended up being more good than we needed still with three of us. It came out as a big plate of meat, with some garnish and corn tortillas on the side. The food was very good, I have no complaints about it. I would definitely go back when I'm in town. The only bad thing that happened when we were there was one of my friends ordered the steak and didn't get it until after all of us had already finished eating. He took it off of the tab and gave us a Sopapilla to make up for it, so it's forgiven, but it did happen. If you live in Los Cruses, or are driving through, in the summer stop here!"}, {"review_id": "6zPHtSPMjrcZQJkaqzGu7Q", "user_id": "0Pd-LScDP0zLf4ShnV8L0Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Was visiting the area and came by based on the great Yelp reviews. A pretty large place with both indoor and outdoor seating. Awesome things include all you can eat chips and salsa, and the beer is quite cheap.We weren't particularly hungry but there's honestly no small dishes here and probably should have just shared 1 entree. My husband got the CARNE ADOVADA and I got the FISH TACOS. Neither unfortunately were that good. The pork in red chile sauce was honestly not very tender or flavorful. My tacos came deconstructed which ended up being good for me as I skipped most of the rice and beans part altogether. However the shrimp was overcooked and again lacking in seasoning. Based on the entrees alone, I would have given an ever lower rating. But the large portions for the price, free chips and cheap drinks, 3 stars is pretty fair IMO."}, {"review_id": "iAEtCZoSza19H9r6Buuv6w", "user_id": "iU3lC82yJjHGVx2m_ThgsA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/20/2017", "text": "This place is closed on Monday, but any other day I would recommend this restaurant if you're an out of towner or just passing through. This place has been well recognized as one of the best Mexican food restaurants in the town of Old Mesilla. Plenty of seating, and I believe there was a patio for outside seating as well.I had the taco wrap things that are crunch with meat inside them along with some chile con queso. The taco shells were a little too crunchy for me, but the taste of the taco itself was delicious. The queso was better than any other cheese I've had at other places, because it wasn't too runny or thick. There's also other specials you can have on the menu, so if I come back I may poke around more at the menu.This place was suggested to me before I went on my vacation, and I was pleased to find that so many people were out here for dinner. Come with a group, or alone if you want lunch. I may try some good enchiladas with some of that green chile stuff next time."}, {"review_id": "ysdRL0gxTIhV9aSSTZdubQ", "user_id": "nZzfFwxalMntqhWedY7sWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/2/2017", "text": "When in New Mexico, local cuisine is a must!

When I was in one of the local grocery stores I saw their salsa was sold at the store as well.

It's free unlimited refills, and serve yourself!For entrees, this place seems like it's mainly for meat eaters, but as a vegetarian, I was very satisfied with the offerings. Namely, the green chili cheese enchiladas and chille rellenos are both delicious entrees. I'd recommend ordering \"Christmas style\" - both red and green chili sauces, but the green chili sauce really shines. It's so tasty. The enchiladas were my favorite.The portions are large, and there's pretty solid rice & beans as well.

My top favorites:*Build your own burrito smothered in green chile*Beef torras with a side of queso*Green chile chicken enchiladas*Beef tacos*And of course, their wonderful chips and traditional salsaI have to say that sometimes the service is slow because they are too busy. It is a wonderful thing that you can bring your dogs with you while enjoying a nice meal. The parking lot is small, however you can park in the andele's restaurant parking lot which is big enough and right across from the dog house. Their food is amazing, however, there is one item on the menu that I would not recommend and that is the green chile steak (ground beef) I believe that's the name of the plate.

The waiter we had was training another waiter so we had 2 - both men were EXTREMELY helpful and attentive.

I walked around the little town and wanted ice cream or coffee. It was nearing 4pm so I was out of luck. On my way out of town I noticed a sign that said drive through.My heart fluttered. Why? Because I wasn't in the mood to go inside a restaurant and have to communicate with anyone for longer than 3 minutes. I soon realized that it was a pick up window only. So I drove around and called my order on. The girl at the window was so sweet.But that's not why you're here. I got the quest burger. That's right. Mother fricking queso on a mother freaking burger.

The patio is a really nice place to sit, and it would be a great place for a group. My friend and I ordered the Mexican hot dog and Chili dog respectively. We also got chili fries to share. First, there is chips and salsa bar so you can fill up a little bucket of chips and little containers of salsa and eat to your heart's content. The hot dogs are wrapped in bacon which reminded me of the street dogs in LA. I can only speak for the chili dog, but it was pretty good. I got it without beans, and the chili they put on it is actually a green chili cheese sauce, not the red beefy chili I thought. It was all good because it tasted good. The only downside is bun. The bread was very dense, not a soft hot dog bun that you might be expecting. I only ate half the bread. I added salsa to the hot dog to add some freshness. The chili fries are YUM, so if they were able to cut up some bacon wrapped hot dogs and put it on top of the chili fries with some pico de gallo...AMAZE. Think about it Andale's! Service was super attentive and nice, parking is a non-issue here in Las Cruces, so don't worry about it.
