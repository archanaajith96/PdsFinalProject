I've been here tons of times and I've always had delicious meals, great drinks, and 5 star service. I've had their fish ceviche, shrimp ceviche, and mixed ceviche each in the rocoto pepper cream sauce. I like it a little spicy so I normally ask for a side of the spicy red sauce on the side to add to the mild heat of the rocoto. All the ceviches have been super fresh and full of flavor. It's made with great quality ingredients. I highly recommend it.I've also tried their Lomo Saltado, Linguini 105, and Jalea just to name a few menu items. All of the main entrees I've had have been really good, but my all time favorite is the linguini 105. It's a bed of pasta with 3 pieces of churrasco and 3 large shrimps all charcoal grilled in a Peruvian sauce. Not really what you think about when you go to a Peruvian spot considering it is pasta, but wow is all I have to say. For drinks, you can never go wrong with the traditional pisco sour. But if you're looking for something more flavorful, the jalapeño infused pisco sour is also delicious and so is the piscojito. The service has also always been fantastic. The waiters have always been very helpful providing the list of specials and recommendations on drinks and food. Our most recent waiter was Moises and he was great! Really knew how to handle all the tables he had while continuing to provide excellent service. Highly recommend this spot."}, {"review_id": "tIfp-XgK2EYUaSqhwbJlfQ", "user_id": "-Q5ZoGisZpt3GfQk0O2vbw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "My wife and I went here following the Mercedes Benz Corporate Run to have dinner and kill a few hours until the traffic subsided.  I've been here a few times before and enjoyed it every time.  I had a Pisco Sour and share the Trilogia De Ceviches with my spouse.  Afterwards we enjoyed cuatro leches with Nutella.  The waiter was very animated and attentive to our needs."}, {"review_id": "fahoXsHsRtzcPkFAO12bZg", "user_id": "hER-uaup29ICB3SXZ0q2KQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "I was in Miami (Brickell) for 2 weeks for work and I went to this place 4 times.  I couldn't help it, the food here was just really good.My go-to's were the traditional ceviche and their octopus appetizer.  I've been to Lima peru and this place makes a ceviche that is about as close to Lima's version as I've seen.  Their octopus appetizer is a huge portion, covered in peruvian spices and served on top to potatoes.   Their Aji dipping sauce was a perfect combo for the octopus.Love love love this place."}, {"review_id": "XFhNNtJLg97Wn1lGZ6ZbHA", "user_id": "OFpFCzqRU4nxi3MuPIPIvQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "We were really impressed by how the restaurant looked. Very hip! Every table had an order of cerviche so we definitely had to try it. I don't remember which sauce we picked for the mixed cerviche but it was soooo delicious. Lots of lime flavor and the seafood was so fresh. For entrees, we ordered the linguine 105 and a fish dish. Both were very tasty.

I had a ton of friends recommend this place so it was a must stop. I took my BF here for his birthday lunch and it was amazing! Service was excellent and the food was top notch. I think we ended up spending a good 2 hours here. We didn't have reservations so we had to wait about 15 minutes which wasn't bad. I highly recommend this place if you haven't been. WORTH the hype.DRINKS:Pisco Sour and Marcutini - both delish. I liked the Tini more.FOOD:Trilogia de Ceviches - 3 different samplers of ceviches. This is a must order. I recommend sharing, it's a lot of food!Linguini 105 - BOMB. Noodles were soft, the meat was flavorful not chewy, the sauce had the right taste and balance. UGH!!! I wish I could eat this again right nowMy bf ordered some kinda deep fried seafood dish. I didn't try much of it because I was full and still don't know why he ordered such a heavy meal.DESSERT:In all honesty this was probably my most favorite out of everything we ate and I don't even know what it was called! It was some kind of mousse texture but I can't remember if it was like a caramel or maybe a dulce de leche or coffee/mocha flavor (I FORGOT!) but it had Oreo crumbles on the bottom and it was fu*kin phenomenal!!! If someone knows the name please comment me!Please open a location in SAN DIEGO!!! We are all about that cevieche liiiife!"}, {"review_id": "UqXOYeHP7E4Jy4ACV248fw", "user_id": "Rhlbsy95KOu26BvL4U8Ftw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "My friends and I just happened to choose this restaurant on yelp and boy am I glad we did. This place was amazing! Amazing food, huge portions, and great service. PESCADO A LO MACHO: took a risk and ordered a dish I had never tried before. Usually lomo saltado is my go to Peruvian dish but this seafood dish was delicious!! The menu described it as a plate of seafood served with a secret sauce only known to the restaurant's chefs. The sauce was in fact very delicious! Very creamy. I also got a generous amount of seafood that included fish, squid, shrimp, mussels, and clams. The fish was cooked perfectly, with the meat falling right off the bone. I would definitely get this dish again!ARROZ CON POLLO: my friend ordered this dish and it looked amazing. The rice was seasoned well and was served with a huge piece of chicken on top. 2 people could easily eat this dish! When I asked for some hot sauce, the waiter brought me a flight of 4 different hot sauces, ranking them from the hottest to mildest. How amazing! All the sauces were delicious :) If I were to come back to Miami, I would definitely come back here. Only downside is the parking. Very difficult to find street parking and even valet was full when we tried! Fortunately, the building next door had valet parking for $15."}, {"review_id": "rNr3ks44D4tPkGXe_K5FXQ", "user_id": "tmk9UysAEwAj0PA1icTJsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Alright. I found this place via yelp and the pictures of their foods looked amazing. So we ventured from our hotel in search of this restaurant. When we arrived, the outdoor seating was full of color and looked like a fun place to dine. There's a bar to the left and unfortunately the outdoor area wasn't open during the brunch service. The inside of the restaurant was clean and bright. When we were seated, our server Evelin, explained two specials to us. One was an appetizer and the other was a main dish. I briefly looked at the menu but knew already that those two specials were what I planned to order. Also to note, for something to pick off, Evelin brought us Peruvian corn kernels shortly after giving us our waters. I wasn't able to catch the name of it but it tastes great. It's crunchy on the outside but airy when you bite into it, almost like popcorn but not as full. The kernels are much bigger than our usual corn kernels. When Evelin came back to take our order, I mentioned that we would be ordering both specials of the day. The appetizer was called Sabor A Mar. It consisted of generous various amounts of seafood (shrimp, muscles, squid, fish, octopus, and most noticeably a full lobster tail) ceviche as well as the corn kernels. The wait time for that appetizer wasn't long at all and when it came we were amazed! That appetizer could have been a good sized meal itself. And the taste! Oh man, it was so fresh and so flavorful. Every bite never got old or stale. If anything I wanted more! We easily finished off the dish with few to no survivors. Shortly after, our main dish, called Crocante De Pargo Tarta, arrived. Again the plating looked amazing. Just see for yourself! I forgot what fish Evelin mentioned it was, but the whole fish is fried. The meat of the fish is cut away and presented inside the main body. Along with the fish, there were calamari, shrimp and muscles. To finish the plate were what seemed to be fried potato sticks. Think of a thick French fry. We were very satisfied with our order and finished most of the dish. The bill was just below $90 but it was well worth it. Not to mention as were eating, we would see other plates of foods as it passed our table and those also looked delicious. When we come back to Miami, you can be positive that we will return!"}, {"review_id": "bpD05GGImnuCkFvrz4MeDA", "user_id": "cJCYCEfDL4n5TgU9y8RTWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Finally! After all the hype about this restaurant, I finally got to come with friends and enjoy some great dinner. We each had to order their house mojitos which were tasty. They weren't too sweet and they had a nice citrus bite from the passion fruit with every sip. I had to order their special for the night which was fried whole red snapper with shrimps, mussels, and squid! It was topped with this garlic creamy sauce that was tasty and had Cajun spices. It was one of the best dishes I've ever had from a restaurant. It was priced at $45 and could feed two people. When I come back to Miami, I'm going to have this very same dish for sure!"}, {"review_id": "y77d3L0eCH7Y8EvLWcTjbQ", "user_id": "H2DNqyt2CR5a8Gv3Jisqhg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "David O.

I don't know what his future plans are, but he needs to be promoted to something ASAP! This guy was so knowledgeable on what we were ordering, and he was genuinely passionate about explaining everything to us in great detail. Kudos to you David!Now on to the food. We started off with the Causa De Cangrejo Con Palta. It's a refreshing potato dish stuffed with crabmeat, avocado, and covered in Peruvian yellow pepper sauce! The flavors are exquisite and will leave you wanting more. Unfortunately I don't remember the name of the entree we shared but I do know it's one for sharing. Our waiter David recommended it and I have attached an image to this review for you to see! It was great! It had 2 different types of ceviche, one Spicy and the other had no spice. It also came with 2 different rolls. We truly enjoyed everything we ate during our visit here. We topped off our dinner with 2 desserts. Again, I don't remember the names but they were TO DIE FOR! I've also attached images of the dessert so feel free to show your waiter during your visit if it looks like something you'll enjoy (we know we did!).

I love this place! IMHO its just short of 5 stars due to location, heavy traffic and parking issues. Located in downtown Miami, adjacent to the Bayfront area, this is one hot spot. However due to the never ending construction, and dodgy streets, it's a bit of a trifle navigating here. Once here, be prepared of an amazing experience. As you enter you get a preview of the outside bar/seating area to the left...the artsy decor with lots of color, visual enchantment and pleasure, providing you the blissful feeling of contentment. Unfortunately, I went during lunchtime, when it was not yet open and did not get to experience the ambiance in all its glory...but I could only imagine it. I opted to sit at the bar, since I was running solo and felt I would get served a bit faster...I was right...I think...lol. No, I was definitely right, this place was packed...not an empty seat in the house, usually a great sign.The entire venue is very modern, chic and trendy...definitely a very Miami feel to it. I had Peruvian food before, but never like this! Never seen an extensive menu like this one or the variety of dishes. I had the pleasure of being helped by the bartender, since I was sitting at the bar...I sooo can't remember his name! Shame on me. I ordered a couple of dishes based on his recommendations. - Piscojito - 5/5: Think of it as a Peruvian Mojito...actually that's exactly what it is. Delicious, refreshing, well balanced, not too sweet, nor all that light...still able to taste the alcohol. House Specialty!   - Trilogia Tradito - 4.5/5: The bartenders first recommendation, he said it was very good...well I'm happy to say he was definitely not wrong! I didn't expect the dish to have raw fish...think of it as Peruvian Sashimi with 3 different sauces on it. To begin, the plate looked like edible art, the presentation was visually stunning, then there were the flavors...I haven't tasted anything like this before: fresh Peruvian yellow pepper sauce, rocoto serrano cream and their secret virgin cream. Nearly impossible to pick a favorite, each sauce so very unique and full of flavor. - Aji De Gallina - 5/5: I was told this is a very local dish...not quite sure what that meant. All the same, it sounded good to me. The description on the menu nails absolutely it: Delicious pieces of shredded chicken breast covered in Peruvian yellow pepper cream, milk, pecans, Piso bread and topped with parmesan cheese. Color, texture and flavor in full harmony...absolutely!! The shredded chicken just melted in my mouth, the yellow pepper cream just made this dish...flavor galore.- Pisco Sour - 5/5: A staple Peruvian Drink. Best I ever had.My only regret, I did not have any of my fellow foodie or yelpers to share this experience with or the room to try any of the desserts."}, {"review_id": "qEFv3C8oSgjatrmEUbq9Aw", "user_id": "v_jwnEUTzQp3XZdOTQ0VDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "As a Peruvian living in the US for over 15 years, I have eaten in many Peruvian restaurants some not so good, some really good.

They also give corn nuts for free which are very delicious and yummy. The restaurant is kind of loud and it was hard to hear our waiter - so if you're looking for a quiet evening out this is not the place to go. This is a very vibrant and loud atmosphere though!
