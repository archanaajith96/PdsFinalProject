We were about their corned beef and were brought a free sample of it. Most places have that nasty ground stuff that looks like cat food. They have chunks that they hand pull and it is too good! I got the croissant sandwich and it was a good standard sandwich but the over medium egg was more like over-hard. They have something called a panwich. It's a pancake folded over itself after being covered in egg and breakfast meat. It's a fun idea but a bit goopy in the middle due to the cooking method.I would return to try a full meal of the corned beef."}, {"review_id": "RNFvlD-QnC_hlGlhfDLDWg", "user_id": "GmZa-gsU_y-ve4mwz7nS6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "My boyfriend and I love hole in the wall restaurants. This is one of them! It has small and intimate seating, luckily, there wasn't a wait when we went. The menu is limited but everything looked delicious. The prices were affordable as well. We tried the breakfast burrito (double) and biscuits and gravy (single)! The staff was attentive, helpful, and friendly. I will definitely be coming back."}, {"review_id": "mUxjod4JcsLOdVGXyRiFFg", "user_id": "yPtw4a_lVeCCWLC9qK8Haw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Close, but no smoke-and-a-pancake. Although very small, this family-run establishment works very hard at ensuring that the customer experience is timely, well prepared, and as reasonably priced as if they were your own family. It was relaxing to see a condensed menu of select dishes, unlike the pages of possibilities found at other breakfast joints. Their corned beef is actual brisket! They shred it, and kick it around with a gentle hash. I actually liked this dish very much, though it would be considerably improved by incorporating a half cup of finely chopped holy trinity and some salt and pepper before the meat goes down; a little unseasoned for my taste, but the texture was magnificent. Still, my second favorite corned beef in KC, unlike the cat food that some restaurants un-can for unwitting patrons across this fine city.And on to the veritable \"Panwich.\" Though novel and somewhat handsome, it is a moist, goopy-battered mess. They pour two cakes, allowing them to run and mold into each other, drop cooked egg and torn bacon atop the half-cooked pancakes; then before dry on top, fold it at the hinge to form a bonded pancake sandwich that melds and bakes into one unit. The flavor is nowhere to be found, because milliard has only done his magic to two sides of a four-sided pancake. It tastes like an undercooked pancake to be honest. If they figured out how to incorporate butter into the party before cutting, provided liquid butter in the syrup, or something, it would be better. Maybe a little salt and sugar in the batter too wouldn't hurt. Novel, but no good.They're fast, and the food is well prepared. I would try it, and find something you might like. Contrary to the norm, this breakfast place is so reasonably priced that I wrestled between 3 and 4 stars for a few days. Still, the flavor element is a heavy detriment, and these guys couldn't haven't yet lifted that pressure."}, {"review_id": "ILQO8H2dVRizxUVvDIBsfg", "user_id": "QZ8qKlrrDA0gyNE1XDkA0A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "My husband and daughter and i came here today for brunch , i been wanting to try for a while now so glad we came !

Probably only has 10 tables and only 2 that will accommodate a party of 3-4. Small menu as well. I ordered the Panwich which is a pancake sandwich with bacon and eggs in between. Mine was a bit overdone, but still okay. My family member ordered an omelet with choice of 4 ingredients. They seemed to like it too.

First of all, the \"waiting area\" is the narrow hallway to the bathroom/kitchen that has staff walking through with dirty dishes. You  feel like your totally in the way. They have a variety of table, from outdoor iron furniture to standard dining tables and chairs. There's an outdoor heating propane lamp in the corner, just very thrown together and cramped feel overall.Service was good, no complaints there. The food... the menu is very limited. I appreciate simplicity, but this was underwhelming. Our meals were bland and poorly presented. The hash browns were so greasy I couldn't even eat them.Finally, upon payment, they use the square pay via their phones and only have one tip option, 20%. Convenient... I'm bummed to give a poor review, but I have to say, this was a waste of our time and money."}, {"review_id": "278G1cWOqqc66AdoZecqXQ", "user_id": "-Humrt5lzXKCmTX-Rr3EoQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/9/2017", "text": "Thank Goodness for Yelp!

Extremely cramped and small, however the wait time is nearly nonexistent even when all tables are full. Believe me, that does not take away from the deliciousness of the food! I had the build your own panini, sourdough bread, turkey, ham, and pepperoni. With jalapeños tomatoes and cilantro, and Swiss cheese. This thing was top notch yum yum in the tum tum. All the Ingredients were fresh and flavorful, and the sandwich as pressed/cooked to perfection. My lovely lady had the mexi-cheesesteak, which was incredible.
