Kitchen and dining were having a hard time providing adequate service to 4 tables including mine. The owner is selective, loud and shouting from the sushi bar. She made sure to let all the other 3 tables know that they were getting VIP service by providing 1 table with free sake and extra salmon to go and the second table got extra sushi just because they were sharing.I ordered the Kalbi from the korean specials for $24.95 plus the extra $4.00 for korean style which provides you lettuce, garlic, jalapeno peppers, and sauce. Although, the portion was decent, it lacked flavor. The other dish I ordered was the Unagi Stonepot bimbibap with miso soup and it was definitely not worth the price of $26.95. The miso soup was luke warm and the unagi was cut into \"four pieces\" the size of pumpkin seeds. Here is my challenge to anyone reading this, find the eel in my posted photo. Also, the female owner was very stingy in providing refills for side dishes. I asked for 1 refill for more kimchi (since I ate it all because I was so hungry and waiting over 25 minutes for the food to come) but the owner loudly told the man \"No, she doesn't get anymore.\"Overall, I definitely would not recommend this to be your first choice if you are craving korean food. It was a huge disappointment. I will leave the photos for you to conclude your own decisions and to judge whether this LUNCH was worth $60.93."}, {"review_id": "mxrA7V-F0isJNvrjXrNNIg", "user_id": "7Id8zVYyQhYhfil6idaYcg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "This is the best secret around.  Wonderful sushi- salmon belly is to die for!  We have been coming here once a week (because we have to limit ourselves to that)!  Great food, great drinks, always leave satisfied!

I assume they deserve it. I have not had any first hand experience. And it's not for lack of trying.They claim, at least on Yelp, to be a takeout restaurant. (See my Twitter pic for proof. twitter.com/PuneetLamba/…) I've tried ordering takeout twice and failed twice. The first time was on New Year's Eve 2018. After much research, my wife and I decided to order Korean from Shira Kiku. I had in mind a spicy chicken stew that I had seen pictures of elsewhere and had hoped Shira Kiku might be able to accomodate. I had seen similar entries on their online menu, but with every other meat except chicken. I figured I could convince them to swap in chicken instead of pork or whatever. Easy peasy. Right?Nope. Not so easy. \"We're too heavily booked and too busy to take takeout orders.\" Perhaps they said sorry. I don't recall. All I recall is the disappointment. I also don't recall what we ended up eating instead. My wife might recall. She usually does.The second time was today. I had treated the first failure as an aberration. Of course, it was my fault for thinking that such an awesome restaurant will be able to handle takeout on New Year's Eve!We make eating out a once-a-week treat. We find it easy enough to cook delicious food at home. Eating out is usually a disappointment, except for the convenience. And occasionally we discover a gem. So, I spent some time investigating Korean cuisine for a while, just to make sure that the spicy chicken stew I wanted to order was a real thing. I even discovered that it is called Dak Dori Tang. I spent about an hour salivating about the stew while I did some errands. Finally, I got to my car and got ready to make the phone call to order.\"Hi. I'd like to make a takeout order.\"\"We're really busy today. Not doing takeout orders.\"There was likely a sorry in there somewhere. But I didn't hear it. I only heard my saliva dropping to the floor. \"You can't be serious!\" I wanted to say in my best John McEnroe impersonation. This restaurant seriously needs to decide whether they want to be a takeout restaurant or not. Please don't play with my emotions. And my saliva.UPDATEA tried again a few weeks later, and they took my takeout order and accepted all of my requests to create a Kimchi chicken stew without tofu and with extra spice. So, I'm changing my rating from 2 stars to 3 stars. If it tastes good I might add another star.UPDATE 2I think I got lucky because of the Nor'easter. Traffic was low. So I got my takeout request fulfilled. An old couple also managed to get seated without reservations. Perhaps unlikely on a normal Friday evening. My order was handed to me in a shoe-box sized sturdy cardboard box. Contained were a small styrofoam container of rice and a quart-sized plastic tub with the Kimchi Chigae stew, wherein I had replaced pork and tofu with chicken and requested it to be hot and spicy. I just took a spoonful of the soupy gravy (dinner isn't until 3 hours later) and it tasted good. So, I'll add another star and bring the rating to 4."}, {"review_id": "U5FA9CB8fH1UqvSWldIO8Q", "user_id": "jUW1PsmZk7WNcHoQUYuiAQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Definitely Delish.

The owners were delightful, helpful in explaining the menu items there were questions about and provided great table service as well. The food was the real deal with Bibimbap, Pad Thai, sushi and maki rolls and a large variety of traditional Korean dishes featuring kim chi, squid, eel and Asian vegetables that are just hard to find in New Hampshire. The Bibimbap was available hot or cold and was delicious, everything cooked perfectly with subtle spices, but more provided so you are in charge of your own level and free to add more if you want. Be careful to ensure they are open when you come, they are as the time of this writing closed Monday and Tuesday and only open for dinner and not lunch except on weekends. Also, be prepared to pay for the authenticity, it's not cheap. You'll not find a lot on the menu for under $20, so if you're expecting to sample a lot of smaller things or eat on the cheap if Korean isn't your thing, you'd be best splitting something, which is fine because the portions are enormous.

Their food was very nice. I had the tofu stew with chicken, and as a Korean it definitely tastes authentic.What led me to giving only one star is the fact that Jeany, the waitress was talking so loudly to everyone and was being very annoying to me because of the fact that I am a \"fellow Korean\". What I mean by this is that she was asking me questions related to my heritage and when I gave her answers, she always acted shocked because what I said was apparently not very Korean. I understand that they're all supposed to be jokes, just for funs and giggles, but there is a fine line where 1. It gets boring, 2. It gets offensive/annoying.I ordered a chicken tofu stew, and that was after we talked a little bit and she found out that I'm a Korean. The tofu stew I ordered is traditionally made with seafood. However, it wasn't my favorite so whenever Korean restaurants offer the stew with different options, I order it with something other than seafood. So when I saw that they had the option to order it with chicken, I went with that one. Jeany then proceeded to act incredibly surprised, because being a Korean herself, she knows how it is traditionally made and was probably shocked that I ordered it the non-traditional way? So she proceeded to tell ask me if I really am Korean, or am I sure. She was overreacting even if she was joking, so I was pretty annoyed at this point. Then she turns to people in the dining hall and yell out something along the lines of \"This guy is Korean and he's not ordering this tofu stew with seafood!\" Which obviously embarrassed me unnecessarily. I didn't care if she was telling me that in person. I was only slightly annoyed, but that was taking it too far.I vowed to never come back here at that point. I thought this needed to be shown out there. Not everyone likes a loud talkative waitress that talks to people.

I'm glad I did. While there isn't actually a physical vegan menu, the staff is knowledgeable and willing to answer questions and alter dishes as needed. I ordered the vegetable gyoza for an appetizer and tofu bibimbap for my entree. The server made sure to say that it would not include the egg. When she brought out the side dishes, I inquired about the kimchi as it usually isn't vegan. She double checked and quickly removed it from the table. She very kindly replaced it with a tofu side dish. The bibimbap was lovely - lots of vegetables and a nice crispness to the rice thanks to the stone pot. The server mentioned that she was sure to pack it full of veggies for me (got the impression that she helps in the kitchen too), and boy was it filling!The atmosphere isn't elegant, but you feel welcome and like part of a group of friends you didn't know you had. Everyone seems to know each other and the server, sushi chef (owner, I think) and others are friendly, welcoming and chatty. They clearly love their regulars and even though I'm not a regular, I felt very welcome. I did feel that the price was a bit high, but I'll definitely be back.
