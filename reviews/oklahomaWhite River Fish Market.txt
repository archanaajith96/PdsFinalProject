This place has many, many options to order from. The staff is always friendly and will help tailor your order to exactly what you want. Broiled, grilled or fried. It's all awesome. Probably not all that great for a date. If you took a spouse/girlfriend here for a date, you won't earn any romantic points. On the other hand, it could probably be a good place to break up with someone. Roll your own dice. Anyway, It's one of Tulsa's best."}, {"review_id": "e2VI0dFR7p7PIoQJh0aQhg", "user_id": "3f392WQUmfyLs0zlgEyyEw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Three things to know about this place...1.

When you walk in, the scent seafood will overwhelm you to either leave or want to eat everything that lives in water.I  ordered the Grilled Seafood Platter ($16) - It had scallops, shrimp, a white fish and hush puppies.  I also came with 2 sides so I ordered it with Cole Slaw and Spiced Rice.  I also got a side of beans.  The plate also came with drawn butter and lemon. My 4 stars because it was salty where I really can't taste the true sweetness of the fresh shrimp or fresh scallops. I can say that I liked the sides more than the entrée itself.If I'm in Tulsa again, I'll look for another place to eat."}, {"review_id": "fciULJfNhl1RwVkcNX3dRw", "user_id": "qVuZit1iyRNc_0eqdBYgYA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "I was in town for business and was looking for a good restaurant. I found this place in yelp and decided to try. I came here around 5pm, so it wasn't busy. There were many options to choose from and the staff gave me recommendations. I wanted to have gumbo but I wanted to have something else too. He said that I would be able to choose gumbo as a side, so I decided to get seafood skewer with gumbo and green beans. I sat down and gumbo came first. Gumbo was very flavorful and savvy. Very good. I then waited for a main dish to come. It came another 5-10 minutes. The food looked very good. Green beans had enough seasoning and cooked perfectly. Seafood skewer was very good too. All pieces were big. The staff was the service were good. The portions were big. I'll come back when I'm in town."}, {"review_id": "192VAJI2cSqtsrSsrsEyUw", "user_id": "JlhauUmhB2IGvlSAdwnFaw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Simply fantastic. Every time I'm in Tulsa I visit this place, and have never been disappointed. As someone who travels extensively for work I can truly say this is easily one of my favorite seafood restaurants in the country.  Could go toe to toe with any coastal joint for quality and selection, without the pretentious snootiness that upscale fish houses tend to have. Amazing diamond in the rough.  The sides are average. But if you're here for the sides, you're missing the point."}, {"review_id": "KGk_TZdt_xVaJInLOcCW0Q", "user_id": "tjwSKJA3KmkKrfmWmC8Msw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "We had lunch today at the Broken Arrow location. Very impressed. Delicious food and friendly, attentive service. I highly recommend their gumbo, fried shrimp and broiled rainbow trout. The fresh seafood selection in their market looked awesome too. We live in Dallas but if we lived in the Tulsa area, this would be our regular haunt. Great place.

This place is definitely the place to be to get some seafood. Now.... It's not a flashy dress up dim lighting sit down restaurant. This is a family style, share a table with someone you don't know kinda place.. The food is the best.. My first suggestion is the Onion rings as your side item.. Can't go wrong there.. Now to the food, Jumbo Fried Shrimp and now my mouth is watering! The baked salmon with butter poured on it is the next best way to go.. You won't go hungry at all! If you are a lobster person, they got it and they can do it right!!!! To this day i have never been able to eat a dessert there, but they have a case full of good looking stuff that one day i may try.. Probably not b/c the rest of the food there is DAMN GOOD!Now.. pay close attention... After you order and sit down.. Try to figure out how they knew where you sat... mindblown!Seriously if you are in town stop by.. do realize this is a fish place and they sell it to go here too.. so it may smell a little fishy..

Because WRFM is centrally located in Oklahoma and right next to the airport, they have the luxury of flying in fresh fish from numerous regions daily. This includes seafood from areas in both North and South America. They have a 12' display case in the front of the restaurant that allows visitors to see the quality of the seafood before it is prepared. They encourage you to select the exact pieces you want. For a main course, I highly recommend the sea scallops and fried catfish. If you can, go Tuesday or Wednesday for the fresh lobster! You won't regret it. For sides, I love their spiced rice, green beans and cole slaw. But you can't go wrong here, it's all good.WRFM won't disappoint. It's not fancy, it's literally a fish market with some tables.
