It's gotten so bad ( good!) that if we don't make it here every couple of weeks we start to get withdraw symptoms . I've eaten at most of the Indian restaurants in the valley . I frequent the Indian festivals that are hosted . I try my own hand at feeble attempts at Indian dishes . But this restaurant with any dish they serve just knocks me back on my heels. Family members own local restaurants and are chefs. I love Italian , Japanese , French, Mexican etc. but this food has become our favorite ."}, {"review_id": "c2WVRKq8VgSnb-9P3guuBA", "user_id": "zb723R2g4erHBoPh8t5I-w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "As a Indian I think this is barely mediocre food, at best. With awesome Indian restaurants in NJ not too far from this place; a Indian shouldn't have to depend on this place.

Stewed cauliflower, onions, potatoes, and tomatoes in their special sauce. It's one of the best meals. I crave this dish. I defiantly don't miss the meat. This is the best Indian restaurant I've ever eaten at, including Philly. The mango or rose custard is also out of this world. The service is so friendly and they always want to make each experience better than the last.

We went on Wednesday and they had a buffet. The buffet itself had dishes that were very different and very rich quality, usually buffets have lower quality food but this was very much the opposite. It was almost as we ordered the dishes. Also they have the option of garlic and onions naan with the buffet, another plus. Beyond that, the staff was phenomenal. We went a little late (an hour before it closed) and one of the dishes was running out (paneer makhani) and they gave us our own fresh bowl of it. It was extremely considerate considering we were the ones who came late. This is just one of the few things they did for us throughout the night.Overall, amazing place and I'm so excited to go back."}, {"review_id": "bRbJPx-unDA-k-d7hD9DgQ", "user_id": "6YYxSXdseZcpRMa0fKLn2w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "This place is amazing super clean I love the selection!

This place is always a delight I love the service food and the ambiance. I would recommend this beautiful place to anyone. I love there buffet they serve fresh desert upon request. Our bill only came out to $23 and some change for lunch buffet. The mango lassie is the delicious.

From the cozy, even romantic atmosphere to your most gracious owner to the food, prepared with love and fresh ingredients. The mulligatawny  is seasoned nicely and tonight the freshness of added citrus in the soup making me want more.The garlic naan, as always perfect, supple loaves with fresh garlic baked in. Tonight, I ordered the chicken tikka masala \"medium\". Yes, I know this is not an authentic Indian item, but I order it sometimes, was going to get lamb vindaloo but changed my mind last minute.The chicken tender, not dry, they nail the basmati with the right amount of seasoning, the sauce had the right amount of everything, all tasted so fresh, not heavy on the tongue.I love everything about Clove and I super recommend them. I rarely love any restaurant like this. I may be a Clove addict?A+++"}, {"review_id": "qrGs4Lwksx7DV0076L-YoQ", "user_id": "J0TauHzVhvNcFDRDWui9NQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/5/2017", "text": "Worst experience. Went here Wednesday night around 9. Ordered chilly chicken with garlic naan. And paneer pakoda. Pakoda were alright. Nothing great. Paneer felt a bit chewy like rubber. Worst thing was the chilly chicken. Chicken pieces were so bad so hard to chew it took for ever to finish one bite. Either was uncooked or stale. The chilly gravy didn't cut it either. Was too sweet and sour to be called chilly. Lost my appetite. The owner had left, the waiter(i guess 2nd in command there) kept apologizing and got me the bill for pakoda n naan. He didn't charge the chicken. Total waste of time, money and 10 mile drive."}, {"review_id": "P25k1YUYZcbfPFSIUPkbpQ", "user_id": "p1N0aF4plwbGmZDrrs0vUw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2017", "text": "CLOVE is located in East Allentown, an area dominated by Hispanic, Chinese (surprise?) and fast food establishments. It's a BYOB (love these places) so I enjoy choosing a wine from my own collection to pair with a meal.The food served at Clove is fresh, a nice treat from the instant/artificial/processed and frozen crap served everywhere else nearby. Meals are cooked inside a charcoal clay oven, Mmm.Is the food authentic? Sure is (unlike that \"Mexican\" stuff Americans enjoy).It takes time for staff to prepare a delicious meal from scratch, so don't come here without time to spare. Or with people you don't enjoy making conversation with. Traditional/Authentic Indian food is not only delicious, but requires patience, skill and dedication to get right. Think of it as edible art (for lack of better words).Interested in perusing the menu? Its available online via their website. Online ordering is available for takeout orders.Now onto the menu itself...Very extensive, in comparison to other establishments. There are various styles of Naan & Parantha offered as appetizers and general sides. There are also plenty of main dishes offering chicken, veggie (vegetarian), lamb, goat and shrimp. If you come here wanting anything with beef, you're a jerk. The servers are very knowledgeable about the menu, I'm talking right down to the overall ingredients and how its prepared (!!!!). Staff can easily make recommendations based off of one's personal palette. If an entrée can be made mild, hot, etc they will indicate so.I typically order something made with goat meat since it's not easily offered elsewhere and its delicious. Personal Suggestions:Appetizers - Veggie Samosa, Naan, Aloo Tikki ChaatEntrees - Chicken Tikka Masala, Saag Lamb, Lamb Kadai"}, {"review_id": "eyrscVUMZRRd-zvGKR33QA", "user_id": "cFacHHDM40jQkKDicHSocQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/21/2016", "text": "Absolutely fantastic!
