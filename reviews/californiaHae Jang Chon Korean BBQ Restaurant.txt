Yes, it's K-Town so the parking is going to be awful, regardless of time. But is it worth suffering through for Hae Jang Chon? Absolutely.It isn't the best Korean BBQ in LA (that's a lofty achievement) but it's such a wonderful experience that you're just happy to be there. Good meats, great banchan, EXCELLENT service. And the kimchi fried rice at the end? You're too full to eat it but you do it anyway because you're not a quitter.Delicious."}, {"review_id": "-vXHQMBhlwZ1vWbr5HRUVQ", "user_id": "3ap-H7tbFT0DeDzXhd4Cqw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "The service was super awkward.

If you like bbq and can eat a lot, please come as well! Although if you are like us who doesn't eat that much, it's not the best deal because they only have AYCE for bbq. Lunch is $24. They have the small dishes and all the sauce, and the server constantly walk around and cook for you. They have I think 15+ items to choose from, from meat to veggie to rice, all included in the all you can eat package. I'm personally a fan of tripes but theirs is meh. However the beef tongue and short ribs are a must! At the end of your meat meal you can order kitchen fried rice stirred in all the meat juice/oil. Yum!Again if you eat plenty, this is the spot for you. I only wish we could order plate by plate instead of all you can eat. Be aware that there's a charge of $15.99 if you don't finish the meat you ordered.

The only time I've had anything remotely similar is Japanese Steakhouse. And really the only similarity is that that it's cooked in front of you. The meal starts with an assortment of sides like spinach, potato salad, a tasty radish dish and a few other things. You then order your meats three at a time. I liked almost everything. The exceptions were the chicken and the octopus - didn't love these as I expected. Favorites were: short ribs (me), brisket (my daughter's) and spicy pork (my husband loved this and the short ribs). The only thing not to like were the policies. It says on the menu that if you leave too much they can charge you $15. Seriously? We didn't want to get charged and were worried about the chicken and octopus. Ugh. That wasn't fun. But we didn't get charged so it worked out.

We pulled into the lot to find out you had to pay 2$ for them to valet your car. i didn't mind cause i really didn't wanna look for street parking. The lot itself is VERY cramped though. The wait was about 40 min for two people. It was PACKED. I'm from the east coast so i was surprised as it was a random Monday night. When we got seated i noticed that they set the small plates up for you already which i enjoyed cause we were able to start munching right when we sat down. This is very different from KBBQ back home in boston. here the waitstaff do all the cooking and cutting for you. Back home, we do it ourselves so i was surprised to see the confused looks i got fromthe wait staff. whenever i grabbed the tongs to flip the meats, someone would come over and help. Is that a west coast thing or......?Nevertheless the food was really good, except for the kimchi pancake. i'm used to that coming out already crisped up. here you have to do that on the hot stone yourself. It took us a while to find an all you can eat KBBQ place on yelp and we're glad we came across thisplace!

Over 4K reviews and it's still 4 Stars? And you're open until 2am? Sure I take a try. My friends and I arrived about 9ish pm and put our name down. For a Tuesday night we were rather surprised with the crowd but this seems to be their norm. We were told about 20-30 mins. I think we waited about 20. Once inside we were seated by the door. One thing about this place is that they don't have the traditional grill but instead it's like having a huge cast iron pan and they come and clean it with shredded radish and water in between sets instead of new pans each time. There is a decent selection of meat choices. We got brisket, marinated short ribs, spicy bbq beef, bbq chicken, shrimp, squid, pork belly and octopus. You can also get steam egg and kimchi pancakes and kimchi fried rice which is all included. The short ribs and brisket were good. We could have done without the chicken and the spicy beef bbq. This is a typical Ktown strip mall, so parking is horrendous but they do have valet (for $2) during peak times."}, {"review_id": "OTKDFc5bbivSpVLtllrNUw", "user_id": "3XBkZ019Gil7EOUxBn9Tng", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "A solid choice if you're looking for an AYCE k-bbq spot.

Everything was pretty good! There is a good spread of banchan (small side dishes) that you get as well. Good food for a good price. It is unfortunate that the wait is usually so long. It makes sense since its a popular AYCE place and usually, people stay seated for a while.

I think one of the allures is the convenience of having a bar right next door. This place is always packed. So you'll absolutely have to wait a bit. This is actually the first kbbq place I ever tried upon moving to LA About 6 years ago. It's reasonably priced, and the menu is direct. All you can eat, everything. Easy. I keep hoping to find marinated short ribs at other joints that are as good, but they just don't ever really compare. In terms of quality, there are places with higher sourcing, but the prices are reflective. Valet in the front for like $2... $25 a person for dinner. (We even brought a vegetarian here once on accident and she was still stuffed when we left...so that's pretty cool). If you drink (which we always do... you're looking at like $45/person after tip and everything). Maybe it's because I've been coming for so long, but it's definitely my comfort spot for all you can eat! Great sides, great sauces, and quick staff."}, {"review_id": "0iHYELLZCr0lMbkE36NrNQ", "user_id": "Ng0A-XbB8PQZu17DcuOlug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Bravo. This is All You Can Eat Korean BBQ done right. I have been here several times over the years but this is my first review. It's only one meat option at $27 but it's comes with everything you want - including tongue. The small dishes before the meal are great and very focused. There aren't a lot but the ones that they have are the best. Fish Cake, Kimchi, Bean Sprouts, and THE BEST POTATO SALAD IN K-TOWN! It's light, crisp, and refreshing. I especially enjoy the apples and eggs in it. Makes it sweet and delicious. The things you absolutely can't miss:Kimchi fried rice. So savory and salty that it will have your head spin. They cook it at the end of the meal in all the fats. Tongue. The prince of the KBBQ meat world. Clean, high end, salty, and fatty. Don't miss it. Marinated Angus. Wow. Very good. Well seasoned and of a high enough quality to eat rare. Kimchi Pancake. I honestly don't know where else you can find this other then here but GOD DAMN IS IT GOOD!The service here is unparalleled. They practically cook the meat for you and the waiters are in steady circulation. They will tell you their favorites and bring out fresh portions sizes of meat to match your party size. We had a part of 8 people and all the platters were on point. They brought great miso soup, egg, and rice when we asked and the FOUR DIPPING sauces were killer. Peanut sauce, chilli sauce, oil and salt, sweet brown soy based dip. This place rocks."}, {"review_id": "usiO6Z0IIjljmt7WY-_uuA", "user_id": "sOwYuGDH5JyVZ0Uj3YoCQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "What can I say about my favorite Korean BBQ place?THE WAIT TIME SUCKS. I almost sort of like the pain of waiting while I peer inside and everyone is engorging themselves with meat. While I breathe hard on the glass, fogging it up. Staring. Waiting. Crying. I'm a masochist, what can I say? Otherwise, why would I wait for a table for an hour and a half? It speaks volumes if other people are willing to do the same. The quality of meat is good. I really like the marinated galbi, bulgogi, and brisket here. I wish the brisket was just a little thinner. Still bomb though. Kimchi is good here as well.They cook on a stone vs a gas grill. It definitely gives the meat a better taste. It taste cleaner. I really like the banchan too. ONE OF MY FAVORITES IS THE POTATO SALAD THEY SERVE WITH APPLE IN IT. It's weird, however, it's always the first thing I mow down when I get to the table.The service is pretty good. The one thing I do notice is how fast they'd like to turn over the table. They do this because of the countless other people waiting outside eagerly to snatch your spot. So the servers are really adamant about asking you what your next meat is, even though you haven't even started cooking your next plate. Just comes with the territory, it's not them being rude.WEEKENDS ARE BUSY AROUND 7-8PM, BE PREPARED. BRING A BOOK, CHARGE YOUR PHONES AND EAT SOMETHING BEFORE YOU GET THERE BECAUSE YOU'LL BE WAITING FOR A BIT.Cheers and happy eating!"}, {"review_id": "Pf3orMTGLbuFQeIiTtB7oQ", "user_id": "W2WVinNXzhx0OK4Zy2nS4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I have to be reminded that this KBBQ place is the friendliest of all.

It was our first time and we were not disappointed! We decided to have a mini LA day and plus we wanted to try out a new KBBQ spot since we always go to the ones in Cerritos or our favorite spots. This time we really ventured out to experience something new. Our waiter was very attentive to us and brought us all our requests quickly as possible. The meats did take a little time but according to my boyfriend he thinks that the meats are cut to order. We didn't mind at all. The thing that was the coolest was the stone grill. We weren't used to that but it cooked the meat perfectly. Our favorites were obviously the brisket and bulgogi. The salad was great too which complimented the meat perfectly. I don't usually eat any of the other sides since I can't eat anything spicy so I didn't really try anything else.

This is also the first time my boyfriend and I have been to a kbbq where the server cooks the meat for us.Food (5/5): They claim to serve only high quality meats and I definitely taste it! The stone states to soak up additional oil and fats but it personally didn't impact me in anyway shape or form. The meat was just bomb af and the sides complemented the meats so well! I thought it was creative that they serve kimchi fried rice, but only at the end of the meal. We were too full so we cancelled it.Ambiance (5/5): Because of the popularity of this KBBQ, expect to wait at least 1 hour to 1.5hrs. Every table is full but it doesn't feel crowded and they play loud hip-hop music, which may bother some people but I personally didn't mind it. Price (5/5): If you'd like to get more for your money, and avoid getting the  $15 fee from not eating all your meat, order half orders of your meats! You can only get three meats at a time and a full order is pretty huge especially if there's only two of you. My boyfriend and I compared the price of some of the kbbqs near and I believe you get more from your money in quantity and quality considering it is AYCE."}, {"review_id": "-omM2uIkdxCsL6l8op9CUg", "user_id": "CtD3xma3B9OBXFo4H1X0ag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "This is my favorite KBBQ place.

All that fat that has been keeping the stone non stick will make some of the best kimchi fried rice you will ever have. 5. Steamed egg dish! It's like a palate cleanser. Kinda of. Lol!

Service and ambience: A very casual setting (wear junk clothes that you don't mind having the kbbq smell on). The service is spot on where the waiters come every several minutes to cook your meat for you and to refill your water or side dishes (I think this was mainly to keep the flow of customers going since the wait is so long).

Arrived at 7:40 PM on a Saturday and put our names down for two. The guy told us it would be about an hour and half, so we decided to go next door to have a few beers. We returned at 8:40 only to be told that they had already skipped our name, but to not worry they would come back to it in about 30 minutes. After waiting another 45 minutes we were finally seated around 9:40. Not a bad little spot overall. As others have mentioned, this place gets loud. Not sure what the logic is on the loud music, but it did make it difficult to talk during dinner. Let's be real though not here to talk I am here to stuff my face with lots of yummy meat and banchan. The meat quality was pretty good overall didn't have any issue. The squid was a bit chewy, but that is because the waitress literally refused to let us take it off when we tried telling us it wasn't cooked. I politely disagreed with her and took it off anyways, she got angry and stormed off. (eh..whatever).After ordering 5 orders of meat (bulgogi, brisket, squid, and porkbelly) we had eaten all that we were going to be able to eat. Really appreciate that they give you radish and rice paper, but I do wish they gave at least one order of sesame leaves with the meal. The banchan wasn't as expansive as I would have hoped, but the fishcake and spinach were on point so I can't really complain. Overall totally worth the wait in my opinion, but then again that could be because I am deprived of good Korean BBQ on the east coast and at this point I'm willing to wait extended periods to get a fix."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/hae-jang-chon-korean-bbq-restaurant-los-angeles?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
