At first the menu looked fairly limited but I found several interesting options.I am doing Weight Watchers so both the chicken and the salmon appealed to me. The salmon was absolutely flavorful and perfectly prepped. I got Collard greens as a side and Qinoa and Brussells Sprouts were on my Salmon as a side. Everything was fresh and each had more flavor than you would expect.It is a very cool place that would impress a date or colleague. Everything is so white and clean and the old building just added to the charm.This is not Bricktown-a completely different vibe."}, {"review_id": "M__Gc7OZsDAPg9kgu6Sfww", "user_id": "FvkYjnPatkg5uO4zm6z2fA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The restaurant is right downtown in a good location. Parking is free after 6pm on weekdays.  I had the Fried chicken pot pie and the sweet potato side dish.  The fried chicken is very crispy and well seasoned.  The pot pie has lots of chicken is very tasty and topping is very crispy.  The only downside is that the pot pie was a medium size portion. I would have preferred a bowl twice as The sweet potatoes are very soft with salty bacon and feta cheese. It sounds terrible but they are an excellent combination. There is actually a sort of spiciness to the dish like maybe a hint of cayenne pepper.  It might have even had a honey drizzle but was hard to tell.  This place is a must do restaurant and I will be back!  The desserts looked awesome but I was quite full. Next time!"}, {"review_id": "KaciCDEhASl6TvrXawiDAw", "user_id": "m-mDk1NFTzBrdpyHTiVJnw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I went to went to Kitchen 324 with some friends on a Saturday evening. It was pretty busy, so I'm glad we had a reservation. Since I've only been here for breakfast, I was excited to try their dinner menu.We ordered the farmer's market which consisted of our choice of three sides. We picked the brussel sprouts, cauliflower with gouda cheese, and the loaded baked potato cake. I would say the potato cake was my favorite. The other two were good, but not what I would consider memorable.I ordered the poached pear salad with chicken after our server recommended it. It was a beautiful salad (sorry, I didn't get a picture) topped with prosciutto and a great mix of dried cranberries, figs, and pecans. I'm not a huge fan of blue cheese, but it paired well with the sweetness of poached pears. The chicken was really good. Our server made sure to let us know the chicken's background from where it's from (California) to how it's humanely prepared. It's not every place that gives such a detail. I wasn't sure if I should be glad to know this bit of information, but I did end up having it with my salad, so obviously it didn't turn me away. If knowing such info helps you sleep at night, then I guess it's a good thing to know.After trying dinner here, I will say I prefer their breakfast better. This is a nice, spacious restaurant and the wait staff really is kind, fun facts and all."}, {"review_id": "EfdleUgae4Gjpag9ic5a3g", "user_id": "1t9pHpZUokQCt8ihAG9JLg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Qualification: this rating excludes pot pies.Item rating:Poached Pear Salad: 5Scallops: 2Drinks: 3General ratings:Food& Drink: 3Service: 5Ambiance: 4Scallops:$28 for 3 somewhat tasty scallops. I felt like I was punked. I mean they were cooked perfectly. And they tasted good. But if this was my only entree I'd be heated.Redbird Farms French Cut Chicken Breast:The best thing about this dish is the accoutrements. The grits and greens are both creative and tasty. The chicken is meh. But get a bite of either of the greens or grits or both with the chicken and it's magic.  Poached Pear Salad:May be one of my favorite salads ever. The dried fig and poached pear pair perfectly with blue cheese and salmon. I'd come back for this. Brussels sprouts:So the Brussels sprouts came in two of our dishes- the scallops and farmers market. Hard pass! I mean I can make better and I'm not a great cook.Crispy Caulifower with Smoked Cheddar:Mixed reviews. Some of us liked it some didn't. I thought the cheese should've been sharper for a cheddar or smokier. Chef tip. Gouda smokes better than cheddar according to the bbq pros in Dallas.Pro tips:- 2-5pm this place is a ghost town...or you'll have the run of the place...depends on your view. Either way it's empty-wine & beer instead of cocktails hereI wanted to like this place more than I did. Especially since OKC has the best brunch spot in  the world - Hatch. Other reviews seem to rave about the pot pie. I'm not a pot pie kind of guy. I'll give it a shot though when I come back here."}, {"review_id": "ZHF5zDPdvVwLer13QJ_MhA", "user_id": "m2RByYb5W37zOvx4C4QkQA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "We were looking for a neat local place to come and eat lunch before a Thunder Game. Planning a reservation in advance is a must here, it fills up quickly and you can tell that it is popular with the professionals and downtowners alike. This place is hip. We kicked things off with a refreshing Hemingway Lemonade. A cold toddy of lemon honey and bourbon. I ordered the burger and fries and it was great. The sides here are their best items.

This place came up again and again on yelp and online as being a great new place so we had to give it a try. First impression- very hip, trendy and modern feel and decor. It's very light and open with big windows and an ideal downtown OKC location. It was pretty busy when we arrived, but we had called ahead and made a reservation for 30 minutes later and were seated immediately. My biggest complaint about this place is that the seating is atrocious. This combined with the time it took to get our food after ordering is why I'm giving 4 and not 5 stars. For such an open space, the seating does not optimize it appropriately. There are long booths with multiple tables and chairs across the restaurant that basically put you on top of the people seated on either side of you. It's not a good place for groups unless you call in advanced and have them block out enough room. It is ideal for one or two people. The seating is so close together that the lady next to me had her belongings between us and it was halfway on my leg. She truly had no other place to put her things. I am not a larger person and I  could barely squeeze through the tables to sit and leave. Second reason for 4 and not 5 stars- the wait for food. Granted, the food was absolutely AMAZING and I know it takes awhile because it's fresh and made to order, however I don't think those two things explain why a salad, 3 sides, and a burger took a little over an hour for us to receive, even with it being lunch hour. Make sure you have plenty of time blocked out if you do go here. Overall, it was a decent experience and the service was amazing aside from the long wait for food. I will definitely be back, but maybe right when they open to avoid the hour wait to receive food."}, {"review_id": "SpKH1UFT41L-Ou4Byc8tcw", "user_id": "A4nLKGkbClTPiSWg8YVcUw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "My mom and I headed here for brunch before starting our day walking around downtown OKC for the day. The ambiance is super classy with a rustic touch. We had a reservation, thank goodness. The wait was around 45-60 mins. Upon sitting down, our waitress brought us two coffees. The coffee is why I gave this restaurant four stars instead of five. When I go to brunch, I want good coffee. And this coffee was just ok, which was surprising because they curate their coffee. The food, however, was outstanding. A craft bakery bar sits adjacent to the main sitting area, which is a great plus for those people who are waiting for a table. I ordered the kitchen green eggs and ham. The eggs were poached perfectly on top of a nicely toasted English muffin with a generous portion of arugula. I ordered the pesto on the side, but it was also very delicious. A great touch of flavor. The crispy potatoes are served on the side, and they too are worth the extra calories. My mom ordered Paul's Big Boy - a classic breakfast of eggs, bacon, potatoes and a croissant. She subbed a salad for the potatoes, which she said was a nice move. I'd highly recommend this brunch option to anyone. So good!!"}, {"review_id": "DuBaA7lxqw7ww4urlI26ig", "user_id": "EaRd_4nFnPs8Fei-H2ZmVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "What to get: green eggs and hamService: 4/5Atmosphere: modern, trendy brunch, breakfastWait: 15 mins for the bar (Sunday 10:30AM for 1)Parking: Street parking, parking garages (lots of road closures)The Experience:I loved the food here! This is what I want for brunch/breakfast.The downside is if you're coming on a weekend, you will wait. Even as a single diner, I had to wait for a seat to open up at their bar (which probably seats 7 or 8, maybe?). Otherwise the wait for a table was approximately 90 mins or more. They don't play games out here.There's a lot of road closures in downtown OKC due to construction, but there is street parking and lots of garages within walking distance. Everywhere you have to pay for parking, but it's extremely cheap for city parking (one garage was $5 for an entire day!).Okay, once you do get seated, you'll really acknowledge how modern and classy this place is with your linen napkin and place setting. I ordered the green eggs and ham, which comes with potatoes. By itself, its a light breakfast. I could see other diners struggling to finish other dishes, but this is easy to finish, but just enough to fill you thanks to the potatoes. Eating through poached egg, arugula, and English muffin was a little messy, but it was a delightful breakfast that I really looked forward too. Not too heavy and overly greasy. If you're willing to wait or come at a less busy time, Kitchen No 324 is an absolute dining gem."}, {"review_id": "-qU-Xqh0Uw8QsYVTVvIVZg", "user_id": "W2P5w9oNGil_mUF5BHf3WA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "I found this little gem online and thought I'd carve out a little time to have breakfast. It is, of course, the most important meal of the day.The location of the restaurant really intrigued me and I was looking forward to a good meal and an even better cup of coffee. The restaurant is found on the bottom floor of a multilevel building (not a skyscraper) in downtown Oklahoma City. I'm not sure but the neoclassical design looks reminiscent of a bank and with its extremely high walls and white paint I felt very open and free as I was seated at a table. I ordered a cup of coffee with milk (Cafe Latte) and I was quickly brought one and was left with the menu. The 2-pager was not a lot to read and I was ready to try some of the local cuisine but my waitress was busy elsewhere. So I tried the coffee. At least it was hot. But the flavor was more burnt than a dark roast Starbucks blend. As an ex-police officer, I was reminded of some of the dark black brew we would share at the police station. It brought back dark memories. Finally, after some stretching of my neck and waving, I got her attention and I ordered the sunny side up eggs, hash browns, with bacon and another order of a homemade biscuit with chorizo gravy. I asked her to make sure that my eggs were \"soft\" or overeasy. I didn't want the bottom of the egg to be hard or crusty. My mouth watered in expectation. Twenty minutes later I was brought my order and I dug in. Lamentably, the eggs were hard on the bottom. The hashbrowns were simple and unimpressive. They were just salted and served. There was nothing else added to spice it up or to set it aside from any other hash browns I've had or have made at home. The bacon was thick, which is good but had no distinct flavor except for a hint of maple. I was disappointed. So I turned my attention to the homemade biscuit and the gravy. I should have left while I was ahead. The biscuit, although tall, was bland and dry. the gravy was under seasoned and only had a hint of chorizo flavor. It was after digging through the gravy that I found the reason. It was just poured over a dollop of chorizo which was placed on the opened biscuit. I was more than disappointed. With a heavy heart, I must give this restaurant two stars. the quality was mediocre, the flavor was average and the experience was forgettable except for the architecture. Maybe I came at the wrong time."}, {"review_id": "4DmvQA7PW3s2t6GkBpTGZw", "user_id": "OJOD8EFC1tw4K4HtfSmvnQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "My ordered Kichen salad,my husband ordered franch dip.

Free street parking is available nearby, and it was a quick, if brisk, walk inside. First up were cocktails, and as is so typical, my daughter and I zoomed in on the same one without saying a word to each other, the ancho margarita. We both asked for it a little light on the syrup, and our third diner decided to make it a trio. It was a delightfully spicy cocktail that really hit the spot. Next up was appetizers, and we selected a couple of side dishes in lieu of the listed \"snacks\". Crispy cauliflower with smoked cheddar fondue was a nice dish, with only a slight issue: the florets needed to be a little more uniform in size, which would also help roasting a little. It tasted great, however. Brussels sprouts with hazelnuts, sage, and red onion was an almost great dish, but the sprouts really needed more time under the broiler. Flavorwise, though, they were fantastic. For the main dish, braised boneless short ribs with blue cheese biscuit pudding and pan jus landed in front of me and my daughter, and wow, what a dish. The short ribs were cooked to perfection, not too chewy, and not too soft, with well rendered fat and a beautiful exterior. The pudding was almost perfect, save for being a little heavy on salt, but it was one of the best \"slab of meat\" accompaniments I've had in a long time. The flavor and texture were simply incredible. This is a must try. Finally, a special of the day was chicken fried steak, and it was a really good dish... almost. The preparation and presentation were fantastic, the crispy coating was perfectly cooked and seasoned, the mashed potatoes were delicious, but sadly, the beef cutlet inside was a little subpar, suffering from some stringiness and texture inconsistencies. This is a dish that could do well as a regular offering if they could secure a better supplier of beef (and it's not like there aren't quality cows up this way :) ).Overall, we had a really nice experience here, and I'd love to come back and try some other items."}, {"review_id": "Hgy7zJC8hLIOtp5bBqfjTA", "user_id": "gd1RhLvaN6Zs0iJyrcVGVQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Ordered the Fried Chicken Pot Pie and it was great!
