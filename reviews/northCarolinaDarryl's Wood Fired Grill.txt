This was a big mistake. Let me explain:WARNING #1 - Upon walking in, the humidity level was crazy.WARNING #2-The machine or mechanism that delivered carbon to the soda, to make it soda, was down. The soda was completely flat and we were informed that it would be 2-3 hours before it was corrected.WARNING #3-I went to the restroom on the 2nd floor, to wash my hands, and was dramatically greeted by a toilet that was clogged with the most unholy terd! Ummmmmmm...wtf! I sent the young ladies in my party to the bathroom downstairs and they had the same experience, but much worse! I'm talking bodily fluid projectile on the walls worse!Your soda machine is on the fritz, your HVAC system is potentially failing, and your restrooms are beyond deplorable?My family and I decided to leave because there was no way the neglect simply stopped there. You couldn't pay us to consume food from that kitchen. Once I informed our server that we were leaving, she said she understood and that the manager was AWARE of the ISSUES and was considering SHUTTING the restaurant DOWN!......(dramatic pause). What was there to consider? Put your CUSTOMERS and their HEALTH 1st!Only after Gordon Ramsay himself accepts the challenge of this Kitchen Nightmare and gives his seal of approval, would I ever consider crossing the threshold into this establishment again. That is a hard CONSIDER."}, {"review_id": "JM3DARBIsoq-9wrn_0EXoQ", "user_id": "L96mpfcihp2bjAc6yfHXAg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "Overrated Slow service and not crisp at all Ok ambiance Nice menu but lots of lots of fried foods Not too many health options Great beer options Poor wine choices Fair prices Wouldn't go back unless I had to"}, {"review_id": "VkIGD-_BaKZWX5F-QxzZOA", "user_id": "YzDD6cc_UtXmAICA_m-C7A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Darryl's Wood Fired Grill is an excellent place to dine.

Ribs were good, not the greatest ever but good.   The prime rib was one of the better ones I had had recently.  Cooked perfectly and a big big serving.  The sides were good but not great.  I'm sure there is a better spot in Greensboro, but his place wasn't bad.  Don't know if I would go back though."}, {"review_id": "hpFeIUjTArV0z4iQgr8KsQ", "user_id": "1_XJoE1xAFp2Yg3FYNHfgg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I haven't been here in a while and probably won't again. The waiter completely ignored my husband and I for almost 25 mins before he decided to come take our order. When he heard us complaining he decided it would be a great idea to bring me a drink glass encased in \"food\" or maybe it was a dirty glass. I guess he thought he was getting back at us by bringing us some filth to drink out of. It wasn't crowded so there was no reason to make us wait so long. He kept saying it was the kitchens fault. How is it the kitchens fault? The kitchen had nothing to do with YOU taking our order!!! He must use \"the kitchen\" as his excuse on a regular basis. If someone will bring you a drink in a dirty glass (purposely) what else are they capable of?"}, {"review_id": "KNzc8Cf4LHt9KS7Il5o0Lw", "user_id": "JLjXr6xn_0j9gjOzBcOE3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "This probably is the best smoked wings I ever had!!!

I've not tried the other items, but if their just as good as the wings... oh baby..The ambiance is a mixed themed atmosphere surrounded by brick and dark wood.

When we got here at 6pm on a Saturday, we were told the wait would be 40 minutes! So we sat down and prepared to get comfy. 10 minutes later we were called! As you enter the restaurant, the decor and atmosphere takes you to almost a nostalgic time. Right above the bar they have an old antique elevator (not functional) where you can dine. Right next to that there is an old Ferris wheel car (also not functional) where you can dine as well. I'm pretty sure the wait for those would've been forever so we were fine with our first floor seat. The wait staff and cook time was average for a busy Saturday night. We ordered the Painkiller drink to start and I have to say that it probably had just about 1 drop of alcohol. It was more of a dessert in a cup. For the entree, we had the fried flounder w/fries and hush puppies and the black bean burger w/fries. We really enjoyed these entrees! They were very flavorful and very filling. I would say if you are in the area of Greensboro, you really should give this place a try and ask to be seated in the elevator or Ferris wheel car. They have the best views!"}, {"review_id": "hidfT9UKMkJhvITnZrHiKA", "user_id": "XLgoL2FOyKEBe6xCOhQiBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "This is one of my favorite places to go eat a nice dinner.

It gave me an old pub vibes. Our waiter was really nice but the only downfall was they messed up on our order a lot of times. For appetizers we ordered the chicken wings with buffalo sauce but when it came out, there was no buffalo sauce on it. We weren't really too bothered by it so we just asked for a side of buffalo sauce. The sauce was really good and the wings were crispy. My boyfriend and I ordered the rib and steak combo with loaded mash potatoes and broccoli. When they brought it out, we didn't get our loaded mash potatoes, we got Mac and cheese. When we let the waiter know he took the Mac n cheese back and brought the loaded mash potatoes. Our friends order was also messed up, her wings came out plain with no buffalo sauce when she had requested for buffalo wings. The food was okay, not all that.
