There were 17 of us and they reserved a table made up to seat all of us. All of the staff there were very accommodating and pleasantThis was the first time for me to eat at an authentic Indian Cuisine Restaurant. Bombay House did not disappoint. The service was first class and the food was wonderful. We shared several plates and they all came out piping hot and served quickly.I loved the Chicken Tatakki Marsala with medium spice. The Chicken Tandoori was slightly dry but still delicious and the simple Basmati rice was served first so you could plate it as our entrees arrived. The other dishes that were ordered were equally tasty.All in all, especially with our large group including kids, we had a great experience and everyone said they would definitely come back.I would say that if you have ever had any reservations about going to an Indian restaurant for dinner try The Bombay House and you will not be disappointed!"}, {"review_id": "hiYlVaaSy90c_5QOXqQJZA", "user_id": "EukID12xjUkU4Z79shP4-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "I have eaten Indian food in almost every state in the country. It is a favorite of mine and I can't believe that one of my favorite restaurants is in Provo, Utah! The Peshwari naan, Lamb Briani and Chicken Tikka are one of the best I have had, hands down, anywhere. I am not saying I am going to create a business trip to go back just for the Bombay House, but if I am anywhere in Utah, I will make the trip!Awesome awesome food."}, {"review_id": "8uVPMdXOFp9pEJ8G4ttYvA", "user_id": "CEWN7ozgvvPwbaKvPlMlIA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "The first thing you need to understand about me is that I'm not normally a huge fan of indian food. I decided to try Bombay House anyway, and it was one of the best food risks I've ever taken. The food was top notch, the wide variety of flavor options so I could have food that was flavorful but without the extreme spiciness. The naan bread served with my coconut curry was outstanding. I'm normally a french bread-only person, but I was surprised how delicious this was; I couldn't stop dipping more and more in the sauce after I told myself I'd only have one. The portion sizes were good; I had a filling lunch for another day after dinner here.This is the perfect restaurant for a nice date, out-of-town guests, or just a spicy day. I would highly recommend the Bombay House for anyone, from the passionate indian food guru to the amateurs just testing the waters like me."}, {"review_id": "jeZyWEh1jFtNqOzHFSm6jw", "user_id": "Jo9r1XO46MDW9PKSNAIgCw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Delicious. Tooooo good. I came here on a date and our waiter was happy to recommend the best dishes. Hot, but not too hot in spiciness. Good times here!

Food is excellent. It took me so long because I couldn't convince my husband to eat here. And he who says he hates Indian food was eating his words afterwards.  It took over an hour to get seated but it was worth it. Service was excellent. The gentleman pouring our water was helpful with suggestions. We ordered the sampler appetizer and loved trying all the various dishes. We got 4 sides of garlic naan for our party of 4. Huge pieces and we could have just shared 2.  We tried 3 different entrees to share. Chicken tikka masala #2 favorite. Chicken coconut kumra which was also excellent. And our group favorite was the chicken makhani which was recommended by the guy filling our water. It was a little more savory but the flavor combination was amazing. Can't wait to come back and try more."}, {"review_id": "KnLaxegP6ol8FMxXZTTipw", "user_id": "LQkm8Ol6XoBC9kS4ZDdiew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "The owner recognizes us, because we are friends with some of his neighbors.  He is super nice to us every time we come- asks about our kids, whether they are with us or not, and teases us a little. Josh was our waiter, and very nice and attentive.We ordered vegetable samosas; 2 chicken makhani dishes: one medium and one mild; the fish curry; garlic naan; and basmati rice. I got a strawberry lassi... yum.  The chicken makhani and garlic naan are what we come for.  The rest is just bonus."}, {"review_id": "R0fkHncxd3msn9pYm1QF-Q", "user_id": "bbxMCHQk0_I0aIB-XYrAYA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Our family has going here for over 20 years and every time we go, it's just as great as the first time. The service is impeccable- seated quickly even when busy, water and drinks brought to you within minutes, appetizers delivered within minutes of ordering, and main dishes timed perfectly. Never long waits for anything, but also doesn't feel like they're rushing you. We always order the vegetable samosas- fried dough filled with potatoes, peas, and spices, served with tamarind sauce and mint chutney. I like to mix the sauces to put on the samosas. I always get the Chicken Tikka Masala medium heat. It's chicken breast cooked in the tandoor oven, covered in a tomato cream sauce with garam masala spices. Medium heat is perfect for me but you may wanna go milder or spicier based on your preferences. Gotta order garlic naan bread, that is cooked in the tandoor oven, to eat with it. I've tried at least 10-15 other Indian restaurants from SLC to Provo, but we always come back to Bombay House because it's the best."}, {"review_id": "Gbo7-HZ9LIHOh79YEcIRyQ", "user_id": "QxIOCyDY_wJc5emddq3BgA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "I have a new love affair with Indian food these days!

We went in on a Saturday evening and they quoted us a 25 minute wait. We got to our table in exactly 25 minutes. The server was prompt and gave us some incredible recommendations (see the pic, it was sooo good we ordered an extra and could have literally drank it straight from the bowl). the naan was perfect in texture and taste. The chicken was tender and the vegetables were out of this world delicious. Definitely some of the best Indian food I have had in Utah (which isn't saying much...) but still, put this one on your list. You won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "g_51bEUe5xiV29qRqqV7hg", "user_id": "RQf1HHRoh1SVxJWDjEzZnQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "There's a reason this is the highest-rated restaurant on Yelp in all of Provo. I've come here dozens of times and have never left disappointed. The staff are friendly, attentive, timely, and beyond organized. The food is phenomenal. My personal favorite is the Chettinad Kolee, but you really can't go wrong. I've tried multiple items of the menu and have liked them all. It's always busy so my advice would be to arrive sooner rather than later. My favorite restaurant in Provo without a question.
