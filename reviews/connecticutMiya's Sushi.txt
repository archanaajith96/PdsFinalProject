If you're more adventurous with your food and come in with an open definition of sushi, you'll probably have an enjoyable time.+MAKI SUSHI: This is perfect if you want to try 10 different pieces, and as a first visit, this was a good introduction to the restaurant. It came out on a piece of wood, which were different for each person who ordered this dish. We had to ask the waiter what each roll was, but it seemed difficult for them to remember which one was which as well. Some of the rolls in here are definitely unique, with ingredients such as toasted coconut, okra, goat cheese, and apricot.Along with the food and plating, the restaurant has an interesting theme. There are little babies on the table alongside mason jar water cups. Then there's the menu, where it seems that customers could color on and are re-used. Their menu also boasts sustainability and invasive species.All in all, it was a unique experience. It is on the more expensive side so I would be more hesitant to come regularly. For sustainability and invasive species food, I would hope that it would be slightly more affordable and filling. The food was eccentric nonetheless!"}, {"review_id": "bmWjfdvEBVrUXSPbK-0wbg", "user_id": "P8PkUJ91Ux_NuQ2SDXsUSw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "Excellent food, wonderful family owned restaurant and atmosphere!

The restaurant has great history, with newspaper articles about the original chef's concept hung up around the restaurant. The ambiance is hip, with menus you can scribble on with crayons. It only makes sense that their offerings and their sustainable philosophy follow (i.e. sweet potato & goat cheese sushi rolls, and a focus on eating invasive species for ocean conservation purposes).So, Japanese food is one of my favorite cuisines, & I like it simple--a fresh piece of sashimi dipped in soy sauce & wasabi. That's it. I ordered a salmon poké bowl that took quite awhile to come out (it was packed on a Sat night), and it was drenched in so many sauces, I couldn't even really taste the fish, which was disappointing. Nonetheless, my bf absolutely loves this place because he's into innovative sauces and extreme flavors. Like I said earlier, you either love it or you don't. Unfortunately, it's not for me."}, {"review_id": "vYOArXonI-Wv5VDyGW5SIg", "user_id": "J4oFgnoIhuXRDFSLyHQWsw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/9/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Obsessed with the uniqueness of this restaurant and the owners unwavering commitment to sustainable ingredients. The sake is delicious, especially my favorite, the firecracker sake. The menu, which changes often, can be overwhelming and the service can be wishy washy, depending on the server. Came here last night for an early dinner. The restaurant wasn't too busy at the time. I ordered the maki(?) platter, an assortment of their most popular rolls. Server didn't say anything about the ingredients in each or explain much about the rolls. I noticed that the owner, Bun, went around to a family and asked them how their meal was. He never once approached my sister and I to ask us about our meals.

However , what you get for the price simply isn't worth it.

The late night menu is a great deal with delicious options , and I would highly recommend it if you end up there after 10 pm for whatever reason.

How can you not love a restaurant with a heartfelt retelling of its backstory disguised as an eclectic, creative sushi menu? (Well. I can think of a lot of people who wouldn't like that.) I recommend going with a friend who's been there before so that you're not too overwhelmed by the menu.I cannot speak to whether this place is any good for something normal like a salmon avocado roll or tuna roll. Instead, I can say that if you're interested in mind boggling sushi creativity, this is the spot. They also have surprisingly good and often very interesting spins on miso soups. Who remembers the miso soup? You will if you have it at Miya's."}, {"review_id": "O9pThd8izBdo1hC4DNYXRQ", "user_id": "WA0UGWBFO5fh9fK3HpZcEw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/4/2016", "text": "I know this place is super hyped, which is why I feel a little guilty for (and maybe why I am) giving them such an average review. However, my experience was good, but not exceptional.We had reservations for 6pm on a Saturday, but showed up half an hour late. We were still seated promptly and for that I am very grateful. The place wasn't too crowded. The ambiance was nice. You can dress up or down. I was dressed in jeans, but saw a woman wearing clubwear so YMMV. Come as you are. They have a very extensive sushi and non-sushi dinner menu and accommodate vegetarians. They do not have a traditional non-alcoholic beverage menu, as in they don't carry traditional sodas. They had a hibiscus soda that tasted like unsweetened, carbonated, watered down hibiscus iced tea. I know the ban of soft drinks is probably welcomed for their typical crowd, so I acknowledge I am in the minority in finding this annoying.They do have an extensive alcoholic beverage menu list with tons of sake cocktails, mixed drinks, and traditional sake wine. I didn't try any, but any fans of Japanese wine will be pleased. I ordered the ginger tofu, which was good but had a lot of sauce. It basically consisted of steamed tofu, brown rice, and mung bean sprouts (mostly the bean sprouts). It was almost too syrupy without enough rice or tofu to absorb all of the flavor. I was kind of expecting more from such a well esteemed restaurant. The service throughout was incredible. I just wasn't blown away by my meal. However, I may have just ordered the wrong thing and would be more than willing to go back for a do-over."}, {"review_id": "avRKVKypYdqqd-DojZliew", "user_id": "dZaNIIelRYlPMzTbfvELMQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "We went here for dinner and the staff went out of their way to make it a memorable night.

It'll focus on the actual taste of the food and the dining experience.Having read the reviews that depicted Miya's as an absolute hate it or love it experience, I braced myself with an open mind. I wanted something different but also demanded something undeniably delicious. And knowing that some dishes could be hit or miss, my friend and I got the Sushi of the Future (full course meal) with Saki and beer. This way, we were sure to do a tasting of a wide variety of menu items, increasing the chances that we'd get more hits than misses. In the menu, there was a quote from a former employee which commended the restaurant owner for doing the right thing in business even when it didn't make the most financial sense. After eating at Miya's and loving it, I look back on that quote and it explains why Miya's has a handful of negative reviews from diners. Miya's makes fine dining affordable and accessible to crowds who don't usually experience fine dining. Most 5 star fine dining restaurants on Yelp have super expensive menus that filter out all but a particular kind of patron. Nevertheless, my friend and I splurged $133 each on our meals (though if this restaurant were in Los Angeles, the $133/person meal would easily be $300/person, if not more) and it was unfathomably good. But, if we came on a budget and the 2% of the menu items that we didn't prefer were the ones that we had ordered larger quantities of, I can easily see how my experience would've been seemingly average, lackluster, or sub-par from the hype.Because another one of my best friends previously warned me to stay away from Miya's--depicting it as a \"disgusting\" dining experience--I think it's helpful to share his perspective on restaurants as well. He's very peculiar in his tastes and when he cooks at home he cooks on the simpler side. I can easily see why he--and anyone else who is finicky about the texture of certain seafood--would've disliked Miya's. I say this next part half jokingly but also half serious: but if you're the kind of person who, like my sister used to be, likes your hamburgers plain with just the bun, well-done meat, and nothing else, Miya's isn't the right fit.What my other friend and I experienced at Miya's was one of the best meals of our lives. 98% of the dishes were hits, and the remaining 2% (literally only two items: a red colored saki shot and one piece from a sushi cut roll I forgot the name of) could be considered to be adventurous and interesting to the palate--but by no means bad. Nevertheless, you can tell a lot of care went into each item and since we got a tasting of so many things, the \"oh that was interesting\" sensation of those two items literally lasted a few seconds before we were onto the next hit.Miya's strikes me as the kind of restaurant you'd find on Netflix's Chef's Table--good for the mind, body, and heart. The dishes also have a history of locality that will inspire your imagination and make you feel adventurous while you eat. It'll give you the ability to taste true American cuisine that is not a continental breakfast, hamburger, or BBQ ribs. If you enjoy hiking and being in the outdoors, you'll absolutely love this experience because you'll recognize scents from the trails in the beers and food you'll taste. Scents are infused into your food in a way that's surprisingly delicious--and natural. It literally feels like experiencing the taste of the New England countryside in your nose and mouth because it's a multi-sensory experience.If you're going to do Miya's, approach it as a tasting and fine dining experience. Go for the full course meal and experience the tastes of New England as the chef intended for you to experience it. If you do that, you're in for one of the best meals and sensory experiences of your life. If you're on a budget and pick and choose what to order in piece meal, you may not match with something you'll absolutely love. But, if you must do that, there are two items you must try: the sushi with the little crab on top and the dessert sushi with the ice cream on top. I'm already feeling separation anxiety just thinking about how amazing those were. And there is a cut roll that had mussels in it. That was incredible if you like the texture of cooked mussel.In closing, by the time my friend and I were  1/2 through the meal, we were already convinced that we'd gotten more value than the $133 we paid. By the time we got to dessert, we felt beyond full--and we arrived hungry, worried that a tasting of all of the dishes wouldn't be enough to satisfy us.Lastly, if you're sitting in the waiting area right now, reading reviews like I was, remember to go big and all out.  It'll be an experience you'll remember for the rest of your life and one that's well worth the price.Thank you, Miya's!"}, {"review_id": "BOVQzNCqCXSWW2AbfHRKfA", "user_id": "WDZkkvAtWuwIKPAR1Lvy7g", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "Made a reservation for dinner here, just to show up and the restaurant was closed.

We came as a large group that ordered a prix fixe option (to save the trouble of having to order), but did not realize that this meant we would wait an eternity to be fed. Our humorous waiter would visit our table and bring us tiny plates of food at intervals of about 1 every 20 minutes. When I say tiny, I mean literally a plate with 4 rolls. Of course, he would bring probably enough at once that we each could eat a roll. But then when dining with colleagues, it would be awkward to pick up a second when you know there's not enough to give seconds to everyone. About 2 hours in, we were still hungry and there was an awkward hiatus of about 30 minutes when we hadn't gotten any food at all. When the waiter came by, we asked if the dinner was about to come to an end, when he mentioned that he could stop or slow it down if we were full. We kindly asked him to do the exact opposite. So he did start quickening the pace to about one course every 15 minutes. Yet again, barely morsels were served in each course. Around 3 hours in, we said we had to head off, so we'd like to wrap things up. I should say that the waiter was pretty humorous. He gave very interesting stories about each dish (which we never knew whether or not to believe). At first this was charming, but the hangryness got to me later and I found these stories rather annoying, as if they were trying to sell us on just how rare or unusual the food was to increase the hype. This will be the second and last time I come to this restaurant. The first time wasn't quite as uncomfortable because we ordered a la carte were served promptly."}, {"review_id": "G1LKLpzAJjBUcWi_IBW9Cw", "user_id": "_ZsXqIyKOa0zcQma12OOJQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "The late night menu is amazing!!

I'm going to sound like a food snob, but it was a pretty transcendental meal. But first, let's start at the beginning.A friend mentioned that Miya's was her favorite restaurant in all of New Haven, so I bookmarked it for later. When I went up to NH, I suggested it for dinner, and he told me about the Groupon deal. $105 later, and we had reservations on a Sunday night for a 16 course dinner (cheaper on weekdays).I know there are a few reviews on here that are negative because they don't serve traditional types of sushi. And yes, those are fair assessments. But it's also not what Miya's is going for. Their menu exclusively featured sustainable fish and foraged plants with a focus on invasive species. It's very much not the typical sushi dining experience and was equal parts a learning experience.That said, onto the food. I'm not sure how they counted the plates, but there were 12 plates and 4 sake pairings. The nigiri plate may have counted as 4 separate things. But anyway:1) Pumpkin miso soup with squash1a) Chinese Firecracker (basically a sake bomb with Szechuan pepper and honey)2) Tokyo fro (potato string basket slathered in dressing)3) Vegetarian chicken with a curry dipping sauce4) Locally made tofu (from a guy named Steve)4a) Premium unfiltered sake5) House salad with dandelion greens6) Edamame with a lot of tumeric and possibly garam masala6a) Beer with fresh berries7) Brown rice wrapped in seaweed topped with dandelion greens, and mugwort8) Sashimi Course - 9-spice carp9) Nigiri Course - octopus, scallops, sockye salmon, jersey surf clam10) Sushi Course - Eggplant/apricot/vegan cream cheese, jellyfish/broccoli, burdock/avovado, eggplant/jalapeno/cashew/cheese, sweet potato, broccoli/avovado, coconut cream cheese, kimchi salmon10a) Firecracker sake11) Shrimp havarti dill roll with potato and a whole deep-fried shore crab on top12) Dessert - Strawberry and banana roll with cashew butter, topped with coconut ice creamI'm not going to lie - some of the courses were hit or miss. Could've done without the salad course, or the brown rice \"nigiri\", or the broccoli rolls. But that's three things out of about 25.There were a bunch of things I would consider the best. The pumpkin miso soup was great, as was the Chinese Firecracker sake bomb that accompanied it. So tasty. The vegeterian chicken was surprisingly good, and we kept the curry dipping sauce around for later courses. The carp sashimi was a favorite, as was most of the nigiri (the octopus one had a nice smoky char to it). Of the sushi, I was a huge fan of the burdock/avocado, and the crazy eggplant/jalapeno/cashew/cheese one. And of course, the shrimp havarti roll with their signature deep-fried shore crab was a great way to end the night.The pacing of the meal was great. Our server J.P. was a nice guy who explained all the courses in impressive detail and made sure we had everything we needed. There were a few lulls in the meal, but that was ample time for bathroom breaks or (gasp) actual conversation with the person I was dining with.Sure, it's not the best sushi in the world. But it's a unique dining experience that you'd probably have to travel to a larger city to get. Plus, you feel like you're doing something good for the planet while you're there. So win/win."}, {"review_id": "U42MtMtuTb8yd4i4s8vZyw", "user_id": "rMrDHhDm4Bkm3QVHtOeHvQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/15/2017", "text": "Alright... the food was different... very different... not my cup of tea.. in my opinion disgusting combinations in the sushi and other dishes.. did not taste good at all..As far as the atmosphere.. yale has a pull on the owner or something you could tell it being very hipster and liberal..Hey if all gender bathrooms is cool with you be my guest but at least have some good food, the saki was even grossNever again a waste of money in my books I could of brought my girl somewhere a lot better on Valentine's Day and a had a good but filling meal"}, {"review_id": "gC4fdc8rbnVP6daDQkY31g", "user_id": "96p4qnSxesI9-Ieb86Ynpg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "This is the best sushi I've ever had!
