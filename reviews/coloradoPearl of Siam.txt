My family and I have been coming here for years, every time we are in the area and hungry for some amazing Thai food, we always come here. The interior, besides the food is probably what makes this place so special- very clean and tidy, with amazing decor and edgy atmosphere that automatically invites you in for a delicious meal. And the food, oh my! It reflects the interior and takes it even up a notch. I always get the Siamese royale and it is amazing every time. I'm getting watery mouth just thinking about it! This place is definitely a hidden gem in this neighborhood. This place deserves more than 5 stars imo- amazing atmosphere, even more amazing food, kind and assertive waiting staff, and just a place to enjoy a delicious meal with your loved ones. Whether or not you like Thai food, this is the place that everyone should visit. It's bomb!!!!"}, {"review_id": "rYUywslvEk2dW6-M_13Fkg", "user_id": "8E6yQWx8rJet_aAqWq39Tg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "When I am craving for Pad Thai, this is the location that I come to. I am happy that it is about a 5 to 10 mi it's drive from my home. The owners are super friendly and always welcome you with a smile. They do their very best to provide excellent customer service. Not only that, the staff is super friendly and helpful. They are always coming by to check on you and ask if everything is alright. It does get busy if you come in around dinner time. The last time I came in, it was around 7 and we only had to wait 15 minutes for a table. Just note, sometimes sitting in is faster than take out. So be prepared for that if you want your food quick.Now onto the food. The pad Thai was delicious. You can adjust the level of spiciness to your choosing. I like medium. The color is so inviting. I love all the colors on my plate when I order pad Thai. I usually order it without meat and it is still delicious. The flavors are rich and flavorful and it makes me crave for more. I also ordered the crab wonton to try and that was really good too. Like the pad Thai, full of flavor but crunchy as well. For dessert, we ordered the Thai tea ice cream to try. It's kinda strange only since I am used to drinking Thai tea and to eat it cold and frozen was different. The ice cream isn't really creamy and felt more like bingsu but still good. Just love this place a lot and very happy to have found it."}, {"review_id": "zfCOxaJ0rhx_XuNwSleH5Q", "user_id": "7tHoFLp3vMYgVkubvjt_2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "This is not a dining in review, but a takeout review. When we got in, it was so busy and packed. I got the Pad Thai to-go. First time here and I was so excited. A good pad Thai near my house. We had to wait a little longer than the quoted time for our food, but that's ok. They communicated with the takeout guests (myself lumped here) that it was going to take longer. Again, very busy so understandable. Service adds to the experience and they are so sweet. When they brought out my food, I was salivating like Pavlov's dogs. The to-go tray was so hot on my lap ahhh, I excited. I wish I took pictures of this beautiful thing but I was too hungry.The crisp fresh vegetables were on top with a lime wedge on the side. Squeeze in the lime, mix the vegetables with the noodles and hello food heaven. It was the perfect mix of spicy, but not crying kind of spicy. I got the medium chicken Pad Thai. Next time, I'm not going to get any chicken in it because I loved the sauce, vegetables, and noodles more than the meat. So good, next time I'll take pictures but it does look like the pictures the restaurant took and when does that ever happen. No false advertisement here folks!!! Can't wait to come again"}, {"review_id": "FiSkasjqiKo6qef9WMpbdA", "user_id": "Qz7XU2bJfdAR_va18B5Ulw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "I generally really enjoy Thai food, so I was excited when I read all the really good reviews for this restaurant. I got the red curry, which was good, but not amazing. I was slightly disappointed because I was expecting a bit more. The curry was good, but very average and nothing you couldn't get at any Thai restaurant. I like how you can choose the spicy level, so I got medium, but it was more mild than medium in my opinion. It mixed well with rice, but all curry does. There wasn't anything special about he food here. I also think it was a bit expensive for the quality of food that you get. The inside of the restaurant was also extremely small, so it's better for take-out than sit-down."}, {"review_id": "V6Zv6QEck8TkX9Qv9WjAmA", "user_id": "rDyMtKDY9lxYv5GlxFO8VQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/27/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "One of my go to spots for amazing Thai food when in Denver. Everything we grab from this spot has been amazing for the past 5 years. We always make sure we give the level 2 spicy chicken curry a try with the delicious pad see ew noodles.

I ordered the drunken noodles and an order of chicken fried rice to go. The waiter however brought some sort of soup with chicken on top. When I asked if this was possibly for a different table, they said this was the chicken bowl. I kindly explained that that wasn't what I ordered and they replaced it for my correct order. When it was time for me to leave, I asked for the check and asked how much longer before my to go order was ready. The waiter said he would check, left to the kitchen, and came back to tell me they haven't started my order. My drunken noodles was delicious, but they skimped on the meat. I also didn't get any service despite being only one of two tables there. But what was most disappointing was the fact that the waiter decided to take a nap before they closed in the hour after lunch and before dinner rather than checking on my to go order. He didn't forget to charge me for it though! Maybe I came at an off day. I would be willing to come back and give them another shot if I'm in the neighborhood but I was not too impressed with my first visit."}, {"review_id": "nNRHE5oMGLHk111YO62FGg", "user_id": "9e27sLzEKaESS8UuD5G1PA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "If you're looking for amazing authentic Thai food with great friendly staff, then this is your place. Came here due to its reviews and it lives up to it. We were greeted and seated right away and the staff was very friendly. I am a big fan of Thai tea, I literally went to Thailand just to get some good authentic Thai tea, so I had to order some here. It tasted amazing, and they offer a discounted refill (only place I know that does that). I ordered pad Thai and it tasted just how I remembered it back in Thailand. The portion size was very good for the price. Very much recommend if you want to satisfy your Thai food cravings."}, {"review_id": "_cRTBRgp9H-5QmGAxQ7MHw", "user_id": "SaAjnnn7U6JnNWNv91VNuQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "The pad thai here is to DIE FOR!

True to the flavors you should expect, and easily controlled amounts of spice. If you like it hot, go for anything from 3-6. Not so into flaming tongues? 0-2! Great service from an outstanding staff. Can be busy, but they do take reservations. And to make it even better they can make everything except a few items gluten free on request without losing any flavor!

There was a line out the door waiting for carry-out, so we knew it would be good. The only reason they didn't get 5-Stars is because of the service and wait time. You could tell they were very overwhelmed / busy in the kitchen. The owner had to turn the phone off and stop taking carry-out phone orders. That didn't stop people from driving over and ordering anyway! Again, the food was THAT good. However, we waited over an hour for our food to be cooked and served. The staff was apologetic and accommodating (gave us a discount for the wait).So onto the food: Salmon Panang: AMAZING. I highly recommend it. We also had the Tom Yum, Pad Thai, Chicken Cashew, and Som Tum. They were all full of flavor and the ingredients were fresh. They put care into the quality of the food and the presentation. We live in the Springs, but I would drive back just to eat here."}, {"review_id": "b2V_-wv19dOCtEC4_9s05g", "user_id": "bD701-SgqJOm2kl-Sm4IPQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "This place is busy please know that when going to eat here or ordering for take out.Food here is authentic and so flavorful.  Our family has sampled the menu and everything thus far has been good.  My personal favorite is the sweet rice with mango.When ordering to go they will do their best to give you an actual pick up time not just say 20-30 minutes.  We've had to wait an hour for pick up when they are busy but well worth the wait."}, {"review_id": "BjuzQLhR86PovuKH2K3tRg", "user_id": "hon-bFdldJTHnwPfRDbEzg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/5/2017", "text": "After trying another high rated Thai restaurant in the area and receiving crappy service so me and my friends left.  We chose to come here, which is what I wanted to do in the first place.The service and food at this place is top notched and excellent.  They are so accommodating and friendly, plus the food is great!Customer service goes a long way in my book and I always leave them a great tip.  Most times I don't even have a chance to take pics of my food here hehe.  If you're ever in the mood for delicious Thai food in a pleasant restaurant with friendly and excellent staff go here!"}, {"review_id": "GDibnDJoFdUF97y3J_uyQw", "user_id": "i-y2-MbdJebSaTKmY1QxHw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/8/2017", "text": "Ordering from here was quite the experience.

First I asked if the do delivery, and he said \"yes, what would you like?\"I ordered pad Thai with chicken and shrimp, and pineapple fried rice with shrimp. Then he said \"see you in 30 minutes\". So...that's a no to delivery! When I went to pick my order up, he was determined to get my name right. I spelt it 4 times but the O sounded like an A and the E sounded like and A...I think the actual A then became confusing. We got there in the end, as in when he looked at my credit card receipt. He is a very sweet man, had a chat and asked how long I'd been here etc. Welcomed me and shook my hand. He gets points for trying so hard. The food was nice, one of the better pad Thai's that I've had in this country. For and extra $3 I thought there would have been a few more shrimp. There was loads of chicken though. The pineapple fried rice was nice too, loads of curry flavour and a good amount of shrimp, could have used a few more pieces of pineapple. Meals are quite large, and I'm glad considering it was $30 overall."}, {"review_id": "LFr-7MD_wsJV3i1SUAwEQQ", "user_id": "tyl5vyEb86EvVvh2IBfa2w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Quick service, and AMAZING food!
