We saw this place was highly rated for pizza, and we are always on the lookout for great pizza. We are here for lunch. Ambiance is nice. Service was slow because there was only one server, who was also the bartender for ten tables, and a party of six.So, about the pizza, they are personal size prepared in a wood fired oven. We had a Margarita and a Meatball pizza. My spouse rates the Meatball at a 9. I can only give the Margarita a 6 because part of the crust was nice and crispy, but the toppings resulted in a soggy crust in the middle.Now we get to why I only gave three stars. In addition to pizza they have a lunch special; two items for ten dollars. Great deal right? Except I never got them. Server didn't write down the order. After I was halfway finished with my pizza, I had to ask for the soup and salad. Server says 'oh they didn't bring it?' Well no, I wouldn't be asking right? Then he comes back and says, 'did you order a salad?' Now I'm really annoyed. No apology either. So pizza was it."}, {"review_id": "ikyHGUTOCMARrHtNtx1I8Q", "user_id": "ZJM3ED1GCpkEUQQARgJs6g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Came here for a business dinner, and Kol has a very charming atmosphere.  Lots of open space, and not a ton of background noise, which provides a perfect setting to have a nice conversation.  Kol has a brick oven for pizzas, so we all went with that options.  I decided on the Sausage Pistachio pizza and was well worth the choice.  Very flavorful and filling!  Definitely made for an enjoyable night!Just as a tip, since Kol is a little pricey, Press Start (the barcade right next door to Kol) supposedly serves the same pizza as Kol's, and it's half the price.  Next time I'm in Rapid City, I definitely will be seeing if this is the case.Overall, Kol's is a very solid food option in Rapid City!"}, {"review_id": "9Pcc60upFNHZ-tY5xcdp5w", "user_id": "yfABZOut0uSIq7lK6JRCzQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "Huge fan of this place. I was a little skeptical a night club/family restaurant could work but I'm happy to be proven wrong. The food here is great! They cater to all different types of diets as well: there are options for gluten-free, keto, vegetarian, etc. The new owners have done a really great job.I think the most underrated part of Kol is the brunch. There are so many creative, great dishes (I had the chicken/waffle sliders) that I'm really interested in coming back.Also, whatever that magnetic thing is my kid gets to play with, he loves it. I almost steal it every time."}, {"review_id": "XoJoyGxfbCIMJVO3avjymg", "user_id": "IOfmpRdQCc1BbY7u0KpTAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This place was amazing! My family and I came here for dinner and got pizza, a pasta dish and the chicken dish and all three were great.

First off, we have a toddler and any food outing can be challenging but they offer these amazing magnetic wooden blocks and let's just say.. we were ordering them from the table because they were such a hit. We ordered the featured waffle, chicken and waffle sliders and a kids cheese pizza. Everything was AMAZING. Presentation was gorgeous, food was hot and delicious and everyone left full. Will definitely be back here again!"}, {"review_id": "Dm1k6nJmVYJ-lIA8PK3d-w", "user_id": "Cg-mtLddNSzKUn7Y_btjdg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "I've eaten here a couple of times.

The reviews were spot on.The food was good and the service fantastic.We were seated by a very friendly hostess and a few minutes later met our waiter, Drew. He was great! He explained the menu, answered our questions and made note of my mother in laws food allergies.I split the meatball sliders with my daughter. They were delicious! Very flavorful with shaved Parmesan cheese on very soft mini buns. She ordered the pepperoni pizza which was also really good. I started with the Yellow Fin tuna sashmi. Really good and really spicy! For my main I had the chicken and broccoli Alfredo over pene. As usual the pasta was on the soft side but I expect that. I don't know why chefs don't all know that pasta needs to be al dente. (And cooked to order. Not taken from a pot of pre cooked) Great atmosphere and decor. Very cool bar area too. It's definitely a place I'd come with friends and hang out at the bar."}, {"review_id": "tPQg7dAv159Ewf9AMhbNTA", "user_id": "Rg029D9WIIzB09-Z9GjscQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "8/23/2017", "text": "Waiter is not friendly, I don't understand fully dark exterior window. hand toss pizza is good, roasted vegetables is too salty, superfood kale salad is medium, quinoa salad is sour.

I'm a vegetarian and had the veggie artichokes. Very flavorful- perfect portion size.  There are a nice amount of vegetarian and gluten free options without it being the typical salad or pasta dish. I was leaning  towards the pizza - but resisted. Two fellow Patrons At the bar had the pizza and said it was excellent. I also had the Spicy Nifty Martini- very flavorful and interesting ingredients.. Very busy Friday night- they had a casual or dressy environment. There was a class reunion which was kind of strange and a bit obnoxious, so I can't comment on the service as it was packed. My server gave his honest opinion about dishes and the size of the meals. Which is refreshing. He did share that later, the place turns into a kind of night club. I didn't stay for that. It appears this is a refreshing addition to downtown Rapid City. I would definitely come back."}, {"review_id": "e6tjYb_lztGo7WhPQcIBnw", "user_id": "IG592XE4qa1izIJbgY3Z6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/20/2017", "text": "This place!! The service here was peerless. We debated long and hard about appetizers, because the choices were all so interesting. Our clever server ordered us the last pork belly in the building, served with a schmear of sweet potato and grilled chives. Amazing! We then puzzled over the entrees, and asked again for her suggestion. She steered us right once more, and we enjoyed the two greatest pizzas ever to crisp in a wood fired oven. Have a meatball--the owner is using a family recipe. The whole place seems like a family--each serving in each and every capacity, from service, to tending bar, to clearing plates, and all in between. The vibe is cool, music hot, and food delicious.

The prices are very fair for an upscale restaurant. I ordered the Pork Belly and was absolutely amazed with the flavors of the dish. Hands down one of the top 5 meals I've ever eaten. Then our waiter generously took 20% off our bill because he felt bad we had to wait awhile for our food to come out. It wasn't even that long of a wait! So kind of him! Obviously they care immensely about quality service. I also love restaurants that prepare all of their meals fresh rather than microwaving foods from the deep freezer. Kol is fresh and delicious!
