Soul food should be simple, it's roots are simple and made by hand. When I lived in Missouri for 10 years, I learned soul food from friends/ co-workers who were from the South. Everything was not complex, it was simple and from the heart.Minnie's does just that, everything is made with the homestyle- homemade feel. Minnie's location is in a historical neighborhood and sits unassumingly within blocks of beautiful period homes. The interior is casual and homey, a perfect place to enjoy food with some soul.Minnie's Soul Food is served cafeteria style and there are a lot of side choices. As for desserts, you will see individually homemade cakes and pies everywhere- choose wisely!  The servers have that southern comfort attitude calling you \"Baby\" or \"sweetie\". Love it!I ordered the whole fried catfish, mashed potatoes and collard greens. It came with a ligit hush puppy rolled in corn meal and cornbread. Everything was incredible, all homemade tasting. The catfish was made perfectly so I was able to pull dem bones out in one pull!For dessert, I chose a chocolate Fried Pie! It was so yummy. I should be taken one of each flavor and brought it but to the hotel. My hotel is like 10 min from Minnie's, I just might stop by again and pick up more desserts! Seriously though, if you are around this area and need some Southern Comfort, Minnie's can help you with that! Yum!"}, {"review_id": "iwF9PSC-N1HdtejcQ-wGLg", "user_id": "4Gaeo5NxRqQdl1DDoq3C5Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Lunch today of fried chicken, dressing and gravy, green beans, and tea.  Add mac and cheese to the wife's lunch.  The chicken was like grandma's and the spicy chicken leg they were giving out today was really good.  The un-sweet tea was good but would have been much better if I could have gotten some Splenda or other artificial sweetener.  We're really looking forward to going back."}, {"review_id": "jA3o2FKemSec7EEUAEUoWQ", "user_id": "RNstfXGgxLVzdo7A7vo7AQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/25/2017", "text": "Oh my when I think of good 'ole southern food Minnie's Uptown Restaurant is what I would picture in my head from the atmosphere, to the set up, to the actual food.  From the outside, I would not really think of giving this place a second thought.  The windows are covered in huge food character drawings.  I almost mistaken it for a daycare.  You walk inside and it has a cafeteria type feel with plenty of tables and if you walk to the left there is a cafeteria buffet type set-up.  A lot of their desserts were lined on tables and there's a food line of all the scrumptious food.  I ordered the fried chicken (dark meat), rice with gravy, and the collard greens.  Since it's a cafeteria style line, you receive your food immediately.  I was slightly nervous that the food would taste like he had just been sitting there for hours but it didn't!  My fried chicken was juicy and had such a nice crisp on the outside.  The outside breading was outstanding!  You definitely can't find that sort of crust outside of the south.  And goodness gracious, if the south can also do another thing right it's collard greens.  My boyfriend also got some sort of dessert and devoured the whole thing in two seconds flat.  Minnie's Uptown Restaurant definitely hit the spot!  This isn't a upscale restaurant.  It's a simple, you know what you're getting sort of place.  I'm dreaming of the fried chicken and collard greens as we speak.  I may make the 10 hour drive just to taste that deliciousness again!"}, {"review_id": "1a1zIeap6lh8n4uVONGnNw", "user_id": "EBJsROoG_F_bjqsjnzAh4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/21/2017", "text": "A must try when near the heart of Historic Columbus.  Our loft is literally across the street from it and during the four hours they are open, this place is always packed.  We loved the little hop across the street for some very cheaply priced, high quality and quantity of Southern delights..!!  NooommmDelicious..!!!!!!"}, {"review_id": "D56m_Bqs7QPkXtzqCdOIRg", "user_id": "EirkioCGWc-kRwhy07B7-Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "First time to eat at Minnie's.  The roasted chicken was good, Mac'n cheese was ok, green beans were too salty and the roll was okay.  The eating area and bathroom were not well kept.  Water was in plastic milk jugs."}, {"review_id": "29ukvs6rFe1NQWnL9bbobg", "user_id": "GGTF7hnQi6D5W77_qiKlqg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/9/2016", "text": "Some call it Soul Food but to me, it's just good Southern Comfort FoodWe had to cut our vacation to Florida short because of Hurricane Matthew and in the process, also had to detour west through Alabama to get to the Carolina's which ended up taking us through Columbus. Good thing because otherwise we would not have found Mimmie's Uptown Restaurant.It's in what appears to be an old store front just South of Downtown Columbus. You walk in and move to the serving area on the left and go through the line and you meal is served to you Cafeteria Style.  Not fancy but it worked in grade school and it works now.This day they had a choice of 5 meats and looks like 12 sides.  I had the baker turkey with cornbread stuffing with gravy, along with my two sides which were mashed potatoes and gravy and mac and cheese. My wife had the same except she had creamed corn instead of the mac and cheese.Excellent choices and I'm sure the other items on the menu we did not try were equally as good.You can tell you're in the old South and not from the accents but rather from being address as Sugar and Hon. Very pleasant.As I pointed out, it appears to be two storefronts tied together so the place is not fancy. The primary decorations are all of the awards this restaurant has one over the years and you can get a hint of how many in some of the pictures, I'm posting as well.A bit hard to find if you're not from the area but definitely worth the effort to track it down."}, {"review_id": "iaJpe_IPTatWaCP_BVslew", "user_id": "bDTirPzfGCPNy6euy5U1-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Minnie's is always our favorite Go To when we are wanting home style country cooking!

You could tell it was all homemade, just really good food. Kids were extra happy since kids meals come with either a cupcake or ice cream!

The atmosphere is simple and homegrown, the food is reminiscent of a simpler time when you sat down at Grandma's after church and ate all afternoon with your family. I'm having a hard time explaining the chicken because I've never had anything close to it. It's fried and seasoned perfectly with not a lot of batter. I could seriously wat two whole chickens and next time I'm there I might try it. The sides are delish and plentiful and if you're lucky, and I mean really lucky, you might get to the meet the Chicken Lady herself.

I'm in Town Here Today in Columbus Ga. on Business I'm from California, so I decided I wanted to Try some Southern Cooking before I head back to Cali Tomorrow. So I searched Yelp for some Southern Food and Stumbled upon this Place. Minnie's Uptown Resturant. The Pics of the food look so good and the reviews seemed to match the pics. So I decided to go, when I turned on the street I saw signed that indicated that this was an Historical Neighborhood and all the homes were these Huge historical homes I felt like i had went back in time 100 years or more it was an experience  for sure now i'm really curious. My wife and I park and go inside, it was Cafeteria Style but right away the smell of good cooking hits you right in the face and the Staff was soo welcoming. When i approached the food counter it was so much to choose from and everything looked so good i got confused until I spotted an assorted dessert  table to my to my left and I went straight for that Strawberry Cheese cake lol. Sooo good tooo! I ended up getting food to go with my cheese cake lol. I had Fried catfish, green beans, black eyed peas, dressing w/ gravy and Jalapeño CornbreadMy wife had Fried Chicken, Mac n Cheese, black eyed peas, Corn bread and Cheese cake. The food was excellent!

Maybe it's because I'm not from the South, but I just thought it was very average.We went for lunch, and for 2pc chicken with 3 sides and cornbread it was $10/person. My dining partner put a lemon in his water, and it was dirty (like, actual dirt on the lemon wedge). I don't feel like you should be paying more than $6 for the food you get.Items ordered:- Fried chicken (dark) - Great, but not the best fried chicken I've ever had- Dressing with gravy - Delicious, probably my favorite part of the meal- Mac & cheese - Really mediocre - Fried okra - Awesome, some of the best fried okra I've ever had- Jalapeño cornbread - Better than average, but nothing life-changingProbably won't be back. Can't justify paying the prices for the quality of food you get. Very overrated, IMO."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/minnies-uptown-restaurant-columbus?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
