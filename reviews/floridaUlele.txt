Ulele sits upon the Tampa river walk and is nestled between Water Works Park and Armature Works. I haven't yet been here for dinner but I enjoyed every lunch I've had here. From the ambience to the service to the food, Ulele surely does not disappoint. On my most recent visit, I came with a large party of 15 and our servers were extremely attentive and helpful during our meal. I enjoyed the gulf grouper sandwich and was pleased at the generous size of the fish. Afterwards, we enjoyed ice cream that Ulele makes in-house. Dishes here are a bit higher, but the service, quality and ambience adds to the amazing experience."}, {"review_id": "IFfHWu7YzLVeT0XCKBjFLw", "user_id": "Av7YF4CQL0wNgWXWqCjQ_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "I understand why this is the #1 rated restaurant in Tampa.

Midweek the indoor seating had a 20min wait but the weather was so great that we decided to sit outside. The menu is very different and farm fresh. Ambience and decor is trendy. Service is efficient and prices are reasonable. Food tasted good but definitely could have used some spice especially after getting a taste of their Ring of fire a drink made with ant vodka. Okra fries and jalapeño grit cake was different but nice. The fire roasted chicken was succulent on a bed of saffron risotto. 3 sisters stuffed portobello was a vegetarian dish and again very different than the usual. It was overall a nice experience. Worth revisiting."}, {"review_id": "9lrSesUdNBjVmTBWua8JBg", "user_id": "QKPkbuVIbN1v9gj4qpQAnA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Ulele has an incredible location and the vibe is very welcoming! Located right off the Hillsborough River and nestled next to the all new Heights Public Market, this place is one of my new favorite spots! I started with the IPA and it was actually very stout and the alcohol was pretty heavy with just 1 glass which is exactly what I was looking for! My appetizer was the Pulpo Carpaccio which is thinly sliced octopus with a spicy piri piri sauce, green and red chili's. Freaking incredible! Next, I had the Gouda Grouper Gulf of Mexico fresh grouper fillet with smoked Gouda ale béchamel sauce! Mind blowing to say the least! There's an awesome beer garden with outside bar right on the water! Tampa is booming and Ulele has contributed greatly to me wanting to move back here ASAP! Can't wait to come back!"}, {"review_id": "Vkb9uyOwzF-UTOnH9Iut4w", "user_id": "asFJcKE-UAzgmzOT3QG--Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Ulele is good. I mean, REALLY good. Great atmosphere, great menu, and overall great execution. Wonderful patio area to sit and soak up the spring days. Parking is free in a lot to the north. You can hop on the Riverwalk and go all the way to Channelside. I had the Roasted Beets & Poached pear salad. I am a true-to-form meatatarian but this salad was incredible! Sweet and refreshing. We also had the crab mac-n-cheese and the Ulele Burger. Excellent all around.

I am not intrigued by this restaurant like most visitors. I and a friend came on a whim to Ulele on a Saturday after roaming around the area. Outside seating was over an hour wait so we opted for inside seats. We were seated in less than 20 minutes upstairs and was greeted by a very friendly waitress. So far so good. Ambience: suttlely loud but tolerable. Seating: comfortable and staff were very accommodating and friendly, hence the 3 stars.The BAD: we decided to go for the Ulele burgers, alligator hush puppies, and native chilli. Simple. The hush puppies were really good but my friend did not try them because she did not think they were \"haram\" also known as kosher but in Islam. The native chilli was forgettable, cafeteria chillis carry the same flavorBut what surprised me was the burgers, I mean, how do you cook a burger well done twice when we asked for medium? I know how. The kitchen might be overwhelmed. The place was packed and so is the menu. The good thing is we were discounted 10% off the burger and given free ice cream. Which I do not indulge in.Note to self and others: Do not order anything other than seafood in a seafood restaurant."}, {"review_id": "Q_BiQh_tL4wILOQ3MJJjQA", "user_id": "ZwuMhX42GsKorrqg1pDPGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Best chargrilled oysters East of Acme.

As far as the restaurant goes, it used to be the Water Works Building, built in 1906 to harness water from the nearby spring.  The industrial character of the building is still intact and there are little nods to water throughout.  The dining room is two floors.  Additionally, there is a patio, bar and oyster bar.  They are well know for their 10 foot wide grill, or barbacoa.As far as food goes, I recommend the grouper sandwich - either grilled or fried.  I also recommend the okra fries.  I do not recommend the ahi salad - the tuna was good but the veggies were soaked with dressing.  Ulele brews their own beer and I enjoyed the seasonal strawberry lager.This place is popular so I recommend a reservation.  We didn't make one but fortunately we were able to snag two seats at the bar.I would definitely return to Ulele but next time I will be sure to make a reservation and order something different than the disappointing salad I had."}, {"review_id": "EVA5IDsmS67CWR7GOy6sPg", "user_id": "UdR_LY_X02e0hikUdVHK0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "There was one place my husband picked out for dinner that he had to go while on a week vacation.  It was Ulele.  Our plan was dinner but ended up going on a Thursday for lunch.  It was so busy!  Luckily the bar area is open seating and we found some open spots.  We had the Alligator Hush Puppies to start (so good) and the Florida mojito to start.  My husband got the Ulele burger (came recommended) and I got the U Club.  They both came with fries and their homemade ketchup (YUM).  Nothing disappointed us!The location is great.  It is located right on the water and the riverwalk.  If it would have been a little warmer it would have been ideal to sit outside and enjoy the view, but it wasn't.  The inside vibe is modern and industrial.  It's also very casual.  I am SO glad we chose this option."}, {"review_id": "e9d90TX4BwOLw6eZWzT2Qw", "user_id": "F3w-vIHxJ8w2pQap6LOZAQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "***Edit***The location is great right along the water and I love the brewery tour and the outdoor games and seating. The restaurant is beautiful but the menu is just ok. I've given it a try a few times with coworkers right after work for drinks and appetizers, a work lunch, and even a farewell dinner party. Service can be slow so it's not ideal for those who punch the clock for a strict lunch hour. I love fresh air but  every time I've gone I'm bothered by keeping flys off my food. I think it stinks but for sanitary reasons they should keep the windows and doors closed for the indoor diners. The photo I shared is from last year because it was the best I've taken from all my visits to Ulele and I felt it showed that the food does come out of the kitchen looking great.

They take a lot of well-deserved pride in their local and responsibly-sourced menu.I took my server's advice of the Florida Pompano and it was delicious as was the avocado soup - I was afraid the jalapenos in the salsa would be too spicy, but even my Midwest-born taste buds could tolerate it.When you're not on the company dime, be sure to stay for a game of Cornhole and some day-drinking.

Service was great from the time I walked in the door with friendly greeters. I chose to sit at the bar, table for one, and was lucky to get the very knowledgeable and friendly Cateline. She could/may be a model so that doesn't hurt either. Ok, the food.  Grit cakes, I could have made a meal of these and been happy. They are thick and heavy. Be prepared to nap afterwards. The meatloaf and sides were stellar. You can tell Ulele is all about using the highest quality food and the cook staff is services my up delicious meals.
