After hearing many different reviews, my mom and I stopped in to find out what The Creamery is all about. And delicious food and drinks is what it's all about. First off their drink menu is beyond extensive so whether you want a classic Bloody Mary, a fun coffee drink or fresh squeezed juice (in a glass of champagne perhaps?) they've got you covered. We ordered Bloody Mary's and coffee to start. Who needs any other starters when your Bloody comes with a relish tray in it?!? It's great. Speaking of starters, while we did not partake in any, just looking at them I wanted to order one of each. For our breakfast I had the Smoked Salmon Benny and my mom had the Town Drunk Benny. The food came out fast and was the perfect amount. The only bad thing, in my opinion, was the hollandaise was a bit on the salty side. I really enjoyed Pumpernickel as the bread with this Benedict because it held up to the runny yolk and hollandaise amazingly well. My mom loved her Town Drunk Benedict, especially the Onion Bacon Jam that came on it. The space seems like it could become easily crowded, but we didn't experience that. I cannot wait to go back and try something different!"}, {"review_id": "E6PHTu5FmKUamb-AHKrgoQ", "user_id": "09KPCp9W_NalQga28aPd2Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "Very first visit to Green Bay to support the greatest team in the NFL the Green Bay Packers. What a wonderful city and that's not me being biased. Ok now more on Creamery.The service was great, food was amazing & presentation very abstract but culinary.Ordered: - Blackberry Whiskey Lemonade- Lumberjack breakfast (It's literally a full waffle with bacon & sausage sitting on top of a glass, amazing presentation)- Strawberry/Regular Mimosa- Chicken & Waffles (Order the sauce on the side, way to much sauce so mine was soggy)- The Brunch About Bloody (A must see if you're into Bloody Marys) Presentation has a wow factor.We enjoyed Creamery so much we came twice. The menu had so many tempting selections we figured we'd come back to try the steak. Unfortunately, they ran out the day before so we didn't get the chance to try it.Note - they serve their coffee in sort of a bar glass or a small highball type glass. I particular didn't enjoy the coffee as it was served room temperature so wasn't hot and I personally like my coffee hot."}, {"review_id": "saglW330665sHxUR5oIYZQ", "user_id": "p7TjV--wUSeDUObKCFpeJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/22/2017", "text": "What an absolute joy to have stopped in here this morning for breakfast. I had just finished a tough project for work and wanted to take an hour to celebrate. I was greeted with warm hellos by several staff members, and my server, Christina, helped me navigate the full and imaginative menu, and explained that all ingredients are made fresh in-house, so I could customize to vegan, vegetarian or anything my heart desired, really. Love that we have this option in Green Bay!The coffee was served \"European style\" and I got to choose the type of roast I wanted, which really is spectacular.The food was so delicious and was just enough to energize me and comfort me at the same time.Highly recommend this space, this food, and this staff.

I have to say the service is fiercely on our side of the table. I appreciate the cleanliness and the warmth overall. From the perfect choice of background music to the attentive service.  I appreciate the diverse and locally sourced menu. I feel like I am at home with the choices on their menu. Free WiFi makes this a great early start spot for professions such as mine, teacher. They open at 7:00am and are ready to serve immediately. Breakfast is my favorite choice here.The Creamery is worth some patronage and delight. Delight is boating, biking, driving and walking to breakfast and enjoying everything involved. $$ is what you should expect in a downtown location on the riverfront/City Walk. If I were asked I would tell The Creamery to expand a line of to go breakfast sandwiches that could be picked up fast and made to go. Expand and advertise this model of business to the river walk for events and supplement the strictest element of restaurant management, the chef's line. Smoothie bar, Luna coffee, breakfast sandwiches and a one of a kind Culver's sourced butter burger, just to start a request list.If I was asked by you to leave you with a thought... Final thought: Nueske's, Bacon Bowl."}, {"review_id": "CuFqXjd0l2N9TR6xMX0SqQ", "user_id": "_c1dx5zPEiHFxnW6nVeATQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/23/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Stopped in for coffee with my mom yesterday... was so nice. She had scrambled eggs (perfectly creamy) & toast and I had the Avocado toast. Let me start by saying it was very pretty but there is no way to gracefully eat it. You must commit and dive in cause once you do you will be treated to this very simple and delicious treat. The avocados were perfectly buttery, the radishes a bit of bite, lovely slice of white bread and the EVO tied it together. I still wish they offered half-n-half but mom liked it just as it was so who am I to say."}, {"review_id": "-SYM_tyYoaT46-MIddonrw", "user_id": "k6CR8pPiqL1NBPb1VUEYTg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/4/2017", "text": "Went on a Friday morning for breakfast. TIP: Don't follow the exact directions while driving since they will cause you to drive into a dead end with no parking. Once you get close, just park on the street or in the lot across the way.Was greeted quickly but took a few minutes to get a table cleaned & setup. Once there, service was good and friendly even when we had to ask for the check early since we had an appointment we didn't want to be late for. Decor is cool, lots of reclaimed woods and interesting lighting. We ordered coffee which came out with two small glasses and a carafe - very cool. The idea, not the coffee. That was fine.Food was a breakfast burrito which was grilled causing a bit of difficulty in cutting through it but the insides were full of egg, potato and meat. All sorts of goodness. Maybe less grilling or just a warming instead. Also shared a triple-berry waffle which was awesome. Apparently they also offer bottomless Mimosas but we had places to be so unfortunately didn't get to try that out.

Is this revitalization (a.k.a. gentrification) I spy happening downtown along the river? You mean I don't just go downtown to drink under cover of darkness any more?! So confused!I came here for brunch with my friend after barre class while I was in town and I was fully expecting the usual \"meh, it's good enough\" that I'm used to getting when I'm in town. Holy moly, I was completely blown away by this place. It would not be out of place in a larger city and would be equally as packed.It was a windy day, but the patio overlooking the Fox River was still fairly comfortable. We started with mimosas because we just worked out and we totally deserved them, and they were very strong and very generous pours. For food, I went with the Espresso Burger because it has coffee and meat and that's glorious. It also had spinach, so obviously I was being virtuous and healthy after my work out. It was so very good. It was everything I wanted in a burger with coffee and meat and I guess spinach.The service was fast and attentive without being overbearing, and really everything about this place is great. They have fresh-baked goods as well which I thought about snapping up. The next time I spend any significant time in Green Bay again (so, in a couple years, probably), I'll be sure to stop in again. It's definitely worth a return trip!"}, {"review_id": "msGQZjJAxWZL3J-AAk8Hpg", "user_id": "4WXFJilovCp9zsOUl_tw0g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Great menu with lots of tasty options.

No sweat, it was a nice weekend morning and we didn't mind waiting. We put our name down, played cards, and before you know it - 50 minutes flew by. However, we checked back on our status - just to see the time remaining. She mentioned it would be another 30 minutes.It was extremely ridiculous because there were four empty tables the entire time. If it was going to take 1.5 hours initially, they could have just said that from the beginning, which is why we were upset. ALSO, I simply asked for a water while we were waiting, but the bartender never brought it out :/For our first brunch in Green Bay, this was a huge disappointment.

We walked over from the Hyatt Regency for breakfast with expectations of not much more than a few greasy spoon type joints. I did not expect this hip and funky, farm to table style restaurant.Our waitress recommend the avocado toast and I will probably demand that we come back tomorrow to have it again. The salt and pepper hit this fresh and tasty toast just right and it was so pretty.He ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of the house hot sauce. The hot sauce was definitely fresh, homemade and HOT. The blueberries on top of this dish made it fantastic.I ordered the shrimp and grits. These are a courses than normal grit served with more sauce than grits. Sausage, two giant shrimp and topped with pickled onions (one of my favorite things) and cilantro. A little chewy. I liked this a lot but would probably try something new next time v. repeating.Coffee was out of this world delicious. Distinct flavor And very rich. While visually cool, the mechanics of drinking piping hot coffee out of a glass was not ideal. And remember, you are in Wisconsin...forget the half and half. They serve full blown cream. We also ordered a nitro coffee which he loved. Super smooth and creamy like a guineas. The mimosa was super flavorful fresh squeezed oj and the best I have had in a long time.They have a nice selection of coffee drinks and coffee infused cocktails, house cocktails, a whiskey menu, wines, etc.Two coffee drinks, cocktail, appetizer and two of the pricier entrees and our bill was $63 before tip. A pricier breakfast but we could have easily eaten for less here.We will be back if we are in town again.

The decorations and ambiance in the restaurant are simply amazing. The tables are made out of old hard word floors and there are wooden crates eloquently organized on the ceiling! We called on our way there letting them know we'd have a table of about 10, and when we got there they had the table all set up and ready to go for us! I ordered a half vanilla have caramel latte, and they brought a caramel one over to the table. I like both, so did not ask them to remake it; however the server realized once she had set it down and brought me over vanilla to add to the latte as we were sitting there. The iced latte was a wonderful balance of milk, espresso, and ice. My friend and I split 2 meals so that we could both try more! So we got the mac and cheese (to die for! There are onions and breadcrumbs in it!) and the breakfast burger. The mac and cheese was very creamy, and probably in my top 3 mac and cheeses ever! I am not normally a huge fan of eggs on my burger but it was delicious! The burger comes with fries, and those were perfectly done as well! The bacon on the burger was crispy and caramelized to perfection! I will definitely be back again for our next occasion."}, {"review_id": "DQIlhIH4e-gaSGCtGjSGOQ", "user_id": "YnVxu3Cy7PEqB3TSVx9J-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/10/2017", "text": "I visited Green Bay for the season opener against the Seahawks in September and chose this place based on its location (and rating, of course) with a view of Fox River.

Her opening line was about enjoying having nice conversation and we immediately knew it would be an wonderful brunch. I started of with a black coffee. Medium roast. It was a perfectly balanced pourover. I ordered a BYO omelet for my simple taste. Perfectly Cooked and a perfect ratio of toppings. My dad ordered quite possibly the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had. I have no idea what's in that gravy but I would be willing to abandon all of my typical eating habits for a plate of that multiple times a week! Lastly, the basket of bacon.... Cooked exactly how we like it- mostly crispy with some chewiness in the middle. Erika noticed that my mom's toast was burnt before we did and kindly brought back new, perfectly toasted slices. She also always made a point to chat with us whenever she passed by. The service alone deserves 5 stars.

I have wanted to stop in since they opened. I was slightly worried when we walked in and they told us that they recommended reservations on Saturday's and Sunday's. Lucky for us we slid up to the bar and could eat there. I started out with a mimosa that had chai in it. One of the best breakfast beverages I have ever sipped on. Lightly spiced with the orange juice and fizz from the champagne. my husband ordered a bloody Mary that looked like it had half a salad on top. it was delicious. The bar was comfortable and it was fun to watch the bartenders make some unique drinks will we waited for our food. The food itself was small portions but just right for a early brunch. I ordered the fried green tomatoes. Rich poached egg on top of it with a green verde type sauce/ meat mixture. This deeply rich bite was offset by an arugula salad with pickled veggies. My husband shared with me and he ordered the red eye benny. A toasted English muffin is topped with ham, poached egg, gravy and burnt tomato. It was decadent. My husband stated he wished it had more gravy but I thought it was perfection. I would have to say this may be my go to brunch spot now.

Decided this week I wanted to find someplace for brunch that was like home (Arizona). Found the creamery via yelp and saw excellent reviews so I figured I'd check it out. The look was trendy and reminded me of one of my favorite places back home. I was alone but the wait for a table was 20 minutes so I opted for the bar. The bartender was really busy so he only acknowledged me once I said something to him. I felt like I needed to raise my hand to talk to him because he was all over the place. But anyways, I ordered a water and a Sunshine Chaimosa.... the best part of my experience! I decided what I wanted to eat and managed to blurt out my order before the bartender got away. I forgot to ask for something to not be included so I told the bartender and I had to assume he heard me because he didn't acknowledge it. I finally got him for a second to confirm he'd heard me and he said he let the cook know.I ordered the steak and eggs, one of my favorite choices for brunch. I ordered my steak medium well. For $18, I was expecting something amazing, I mean I pay that much for it at home but it's a big city and upscale so being here I'm thinking for this much, I KNOW it's gonna be delicious. WRONG! As soon as the server set my plate down, I knew it wasn't gonna be good. (I'm mad I didn't take a pic) My \"medium well\" steak looked like a blackened something thrown on the plate. The eggs were cool, as if they'd been sitting on the plate waiting for the steak to finish being killed and added to the plate. Steak fries also came with it and those too were room temp. I cut the tip off the steak and cut the rest in half to confirm it was NOT medium well as I had asked. I bit into the tip I cut off only to find the meat was not only tough to cut but also crunchy! I asked the bartender if he ordered it medium well and he said he had. After I let him know it was burnt and the eggs were cold he asked if I wanted anything else. I told him I was good and I finished off my Chaimosa and asked for my check. Really had high hopes for this place based on the reviews... oh well."}, {"review_id": "invID3VSRVrfyUJZB1QV1w", "user_id": "hR4aBZ4C9mYNcxfhQ-K7jQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "I love love love the Creamery!

We waited an hour for 3 orders of Belgian waffles. The waffles were not Belgian style in anyway. They were cold and soggy. They were two little thin squares that were undercooked. I have had better frozen toaster waffles. I had a side of chocolate sauce which tasted like Hersey syrup but had water mixed in to get the runny watery consistency. Gross!When asked how much longer we were told it was coming right out that the kitchen was backed up. Place was half empty when we got there. Only reason we waited an hour and then ate the gross breakfast is because we has a very hungry 7 and 2 year old with us who would not wait any longer to eat.Will never eat here again."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-creamery-downtown-green-bay-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
