Answer: too long.When I want comfort food, this is where I go. The thing I always get is the yellow curry with tofu. The tofu is sliced up perfectly, the curry is seasoned so well and you can add the level of spice to your liking. I highly recommend this dish, it's delicious.The curry puffs are a really good starter- they are a bit oily but burst with flavor. I've also gotten the pho from here. This is another super tasty dish from here. It's a pretty large serving and comes with all the classic fixings (jalepeno, sprouts, lime, etc).I've dined in a couple times but I mainly do take out. It doesn't take very long to be ready and everything is neatly packaged. Even the pho is packaged really well!I will always recommend this place and I'll keep coming back!"}, {"review_id": "jRSS8DfuOPVLJV9mfONZRg", "user_id": "hyBWllD1EmBwx1tlApaS-A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "I have been here on several occasions, but yesterday was the first time I ordered CARRY-OUT PHO (PH8, regular and large). I wasn't sure if this was a good idea -- but it was perfect, rainy pho-weather, and I didn't have the ingredients (or time) to whip up my own. The order was made around 6:40 pm and she said would take 20-25 minutes. We arrived a little after 7, and boy was I glad I ordered carry out. Even with the tsunami-like weather, the entry way was packed! I made my way to the register and the transaction was quick. My order was ready, nicely packed. When we got home, it was still warm enough to eat right away. The broth and meatballs were packed in a plastic container, scallions, noodles and other meats in a take-out box, veggie garnishing in a zip lock (bean sprouts, basil, jalapeño and lime), two small containers of hoisin and a packet of Sriracha sauce. Everything was placed into our bowls. We used to think the pho servings at restaurants were small and this proved us wrong. Our bowls were loaded! Broth was delicious, noodles and meats the perfect texture! We are definitely doing carry-out pho again -- but only if/when we're short on time. Other times we've been here, we've enjoyed many dishes. Their AP10 (Spring Roll with Egg Roll) has inspired me, and the LS7 (Nem Khao) is my favorite! I'm a spice-fanatic, and they not only have chili garlic oil on request, but freshly minced Thai chili, too! If your palette is accustomed to SE Asian flavors, you may not be a fan of their Larb or Papaya Salads.They only con I have is that the sit-in service can be slow. There have been many times where I joked with my Hubs, \"Ha Long Bay\" is really \"How Long Bae?\" I get it though -- they get busy, have an extensive menu (Thai, Lao and Viet cuisine!), and a teensy kitchen to work with. So this hasn't deter us from returning."}, {"review_id": "jDGZUYU52YBZRsrnMZL7zw", "user_id": "Pstaq3a0m58jBDkoT5HtOw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I've been dying to go to Ha Long Bay and finally made it! It didn't disappoint! I had the Mc Rang Mui(Fried squid tossed with salt, pepper, onion; on lettuce) and while I felt it a little heavy handed on the batter - it was good and fresh and tasty! The onions and peppers where delicious and perfectly seasoned.  We started with the chicken satay and fried tofu - both solid appetizers! The peanut sauce was chunky and peanuty which I prefer to the creamy smooth variety.  Service was incredibly sweet and helpful.  My dining companion was brand new to Vietnamese cuisine and our server was more than happy to help her decide what to go with.  Very clean, comfy, well lit - great place, I'd definitely head back!"}, {"review_id": "Uw7hHpCZCnJxYaqS5YuVlw", "user_id": "DjlwzCPN1RWmGZR9K7mL7A", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "So I wanted to bring my mother to someplace new, saw the high rating, and many reviews that were positive.

I expected too much. Between the Yelp reviews and the locals recommending this place, my expectations were too high. RED CURRY FRIED RICE -Ordered with tofu, no egg, no mushrooms, and level 5 spice (their highest spice level). I expected lots of flavor, especially with the addition of the red curry, but I was extremely disappointed with its lack of flavor.  It also lacked spice. If level 5 had no spice, I can't imagine what level 1 and 2 are like. MANGO CURRY (TC9) -Ordered with tofu and spice level 5. Their tofu is too spongey for my liking. The flavor itself was just ok. I thought a mango curry would bring some exotic sabor, but it didn't... Aside from the pieces of fruit, it didn't stand out from a regular red curry. The spice was good in the curry though.PAN FRIED DUMPLINGS -Fried dumplings, filled with veggies and served with sweet & sour sauce. They were pretty good. CURRY PUFFS -Now these were delicious!! Crispy pastry puffs filled with curried potatoes and served with sweet and sour sauce. They were the highlight of the meal, and the only item that I'd recommend. Aside from the Curry Puffs, this place just doesn't hold up to the hype. Nothing was extraordinary, flavor was lacking in all of the entrees that I ordered, and the service received from the hostess during my carry out process left much to be desired.  At this time, I just can't see myself wasting my time or money returning for mediocre food."}, {"review_id": "C4NoYx5L8SqXnAg-fAeq6w", "user_id": "wNLZnNNLV8rOGiPjqMPVdQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Okay you guys, if you haven't checked out Ha Long Bay yet, you are SERIOUSLY missing out. I love Thai food. This is probably the best Thai I have had in Madison. And it's not just Thai, either. As the name suggests, it's Vietnamese as well, and there is also a Laotian section offered too. Now, if you've ever driven by Ha Long Bay on a warm day at peak meal time, you have probably noticed a line out the door. It's common. Yesterday, on a brisk evening around 5:30pm, we were given a 40 minute wait time. This place is POPULAR. If you're not okay with waiting, I would suggest going at non-peak times, or ordering for pick up. I promise, though, the food is WORTH the wait. We started with AP10 - Gi Cun Ch Giò. They were spring rolls, with pork egg rolls inside. So yummy. The freshness of the spring roll paired perfectly with the crunch of the egg roll. We also ordered the AP4 - Crab Meat Wontons. Similar to Crab rangoon, but better! For my main, I went with the TN3 - Pad See Ew with chicken. I've had a lot of Pad See Ew in my day, and this was definitely toward the top of the list as far as taste and quality go. It was rich and flavorful, they didn't skimp on the egg (my favorite part) and the chicken was prepared really well. Since we started with appetizers, I got to take the majority of this dish home, so I get to make multiple meals of it. Yay! My friend who I was dining with went with one of the fried rice dishes. I can't recall what one it was, but it looked good! There were some folks sitting near us who had some curry that I was basically drooling over, it looked SO GOOD. I will be back soon to try that next. There are so many items on the menu I can't wait to try!"}, {"review_id": "_jUu_dwMn1UEgMZJy3DGCw", "user_id": "claV_wXYEgojvBrRodrSGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Ha Long Bay is one of my top recommendations to people if they're looking to try something new in Madison or haven't tried Vietnamese, Thai, or Lao food before. We made a reservation for when they opened right away in the morning, and within a half hour of being open, the whole restaurant was already filled!I always start with a glass of Thai tea; you won't regret that decision. I normally get the panang curry with tofu, a hearty bowl of peanut-y goodness, but I was feeling a home-cooked meal, so I had a bowl of banh canh with chicken, a soup dish with hand rolled rice/tapioca noodles. The banh canh tastes so much like the one my mom would make, and I love that they give me a plate of vegetables to add in. The noodles taste homemade, which is how you know if it's good banh canh. If you want it spicy, their levels of spicy definitely cater to an American level of spiciness as a heads up, because although I ordered five stars of spiciness, I added in more chili afterward.Service can be spotty, but the food makes up for the wait, and I can promise you that you will most likely leave with a full stomach."}, {"review_id": "97XzaauGG6jmZ7mS5hbwrw", "user_id": "A4nLKGkbClTPiSWg8YVcUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "This was our first time at this highly recommended Thai/Vietnamese restaurant. We are huge fans of Thai food, but this was our first Thai food venture in Madison. The restaurant felt small upon walking inside because it was very busy, but there was ample seating and we only had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated, which was just the right amount of time to read through the extensive menu. We started with the Thai fresh rolls. I would give these maybe 3 stars. Not very impressive. The lettuce seemed a little soggy. I ordered the Shrimp Pho and boy was it good. Definitely a 4/5 stars. Just the right amount of rice noodles accompanied a large portion of shrimp and bowl choy; however, I did ask for extra protein ($2 surcharge). The flavor of the pho broth was spot on and the side of basil, bean sprouts and jalapeños added extra flare. I added spicy garlic sauce for some extra heat. We also order the squash curry which was easily a 5/5 stars. Three kinds of squash were cooked in a spicy red curry sauce. The squash wasn't mushy and with a little bit of rice, the dish was fantastic. We have a tolerance for heat, so next time instead of medium, we will order it hot. This place will most likely become a staple for us. It was wonderful finding a nice restaurant to satisfy our Thai/Vietnamese food craving!!!"}, {"review_id": "uYYVJO6fYOfAtgF4KClp3w", "user_id": "3NX-ybpkq7sMKCCO7o_nmw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "They get super busy.

Get them pan fried rather than steamed. The spicy wonton soup is so delicious. The flavors are awesome. Try it.4/5 (excellent dishes):  HT1 and the Thai red curry. The HT1 is a fried noodle in some gravy sauce with vegetables. I usually get it with chicken and non spicy.  The Thai red curry is more sweet than spicy. Love the creamy, sweet, salty flavors.

Although coming right after work typically means no wait and being seated right away. There was a slight light situation where some of the light fixtures needed replacing but once the light was replaced, the place went from being a dimly light romantic restaurant to a slightly more light. The shrimp pho that I got was surprisingly topped with some baby bok-choy. Normally when I ask for no toppings of green onions, white onions or cilantro, it's always just plain noodles and meat with the broth but I do actually like veggies so I was happy that it was topped with some veggies! The waiter must be new because halfway through eating our meal, he just came and dropped off our check. Granted, we were in a rush to finish, but it always leaves a strange feeling when the waiter drops a check without saying no rush (as if there's a timer on the table and we have to leave soon).

I personally love their yellow curry with tofu and their pad Thai with tofu. My friend raves about the Pho the serve and gets it every time she goes here. In addition, they have lunch specials Monday through Friday from 11-3 PM. The lunch specials includes an appetizer so it is a great way to get a bang for your buck.

That the person usually in charge of preparing the appetizers was cooking... Which may also explain why the appetizers that we had ordered were severely over cooked... Who was making the appetizers while she was doing the main cooking??   I sincerely hope that Chef Tom is Ok... That it was just his night off, or perhaps he is on Vacation... If he is out sick, I wish him a speedy recovery not only for his sake, but for the sake of the restaurant as well.  Please, please, please let it be something as simple as that... God forbid anything worse, or that he has left the restaurant...You see, Chef's Really Do Matter.  For without them, you really are just another flavorless Fast Food Chinese Restaurant, lost in a sea of mediocrity that isn't worth it's weight in soy sauce."}, {"review_id": "MKgVt4MXWaPtIjfTQL-g-A", "user_id": "rBEsu2MUcoCcknBpTicsZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "This is my favorite place in town for curry.
