Usually do the calm chowder and a salad.  Work up to the Pan Roast with everything.  Oh my goodness, heaven in your mouth.  So much flavor. Creamy and spicy (pick your own heat level) with extra yummy.  I loVe it with white rice, however some individuals enjoy crackers. They provide you with a sour dough roll with every meal as well. The alcohol selection is limited so get your drink on before you go over to oyster bar.  Mainly wine and possibly beer. Didn't notice drinks much was in awe of the chief.

Just eat here. The pan roast is still every bit as sensational as the last review I wrote, and the combo pan roast with lobster will always be the stuff that your dreams and happiest memories are made of. However, this time my review is to emotionally prepare you for your experience. I like to show up to Oyster Bar when I'm alone; Americans always have the need to space themselves out from strangers, and more often than not there's an empty solo seat. =Cue my entrance, please=Here's what to bring if you show up during summer season or anytime (roughly) before 4AM or after 10AM:- Camping chair- A roadie (maybe you can flag a cocktail waitress down)- A few activities like crossword or Sudoku books (or coloring books, but no one under 21 here)- A ton of money to beg everyone else in front of you to let you cut in lineGreat, now that we've established that the wait here is rough sometimes, you've finally made it to the front of the line and are about to pounce on the seats that just opened up. Staff will- with restraint- ask you to wait until the area is cleaned off. So hang out by the rope and just wait to be called. I knocked this place down in stars because I'm tired of putting up with the staff's bullshit here. In the past 1,000 reviews, I've only commented negatively about staff one other time (The Mule in OKC), given that I'm a bartender myself. The past two times here, the older servers have treated me like a burden and made zero effort to be pleasant at all; no thank you, no smile, no response except an order call back and a refill dumped on the counter. The whole thing straight up makes you feel BAD, and who the hell goes somewhere to eat and leave feeling like that? (If you didn't think it was possible to toss a drink at someone... it's possible.) To the staff, if you're worn down from the tourist grind, get out of it and make room for someone who wants to be there, especially since money isn't ugly here. Will it stop me from coming back? Nope. The food is amazing. And I still tip well because the cook ends up being nicer than the server, and the cook is part of the tip pool. Maybe next time being a little nice to people will be on their menu, too. Or maybe not. Whatever. Pan roast and ignore."}, {"review_id": "cRUqSz5oHm78uCBh_nr-Bg", "user_id": "9FyBOjMNADDIWtGbWZPMQg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "OMG!!!  No wonder why the Oyster Bar located at The Palace Station always has a long line.  It's worth the hour wait for the best raw oysters off the strip.  This spot is not a sit down restaurant.  There are about 15 or so seats in a bar setting.  It can be hectic pretty much throughout the day.  When we arrived there were only 2 people waiting in line.  So we thought it was going to be easy breezy.  It was a bad idea.  We hit the casino for about 30 minutes and came back.  By this time the lunch crowd all decided to swarm in.  We got seated within 45-50 minutes.  The chef cooks right in front of you.  It's interesting to see the magic happen in an open kitchen setting.  I didn't get try the Combo Pan Roast with the linguini noodles.  But I was able to try a dozen of the raw oysters.  Very fresh for Vegas standards.  I also had the little neck clams in garlic herb broth.  Flavorful and delicious!It's a must try when visiting Vegas.  I will be back to try more entrees.  Be patient because the wait is bearable.  Then you'll get to enjoy the seafood.  Not to mention the friendly service even though it's busy."}, {"review_id": "p1RuxW-IFvN4QHoIZrShwA", "user_id": "-lf3oTyr2K-CzBG67zZ6LA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Ummm tbh, this seafood spot is a fun-ish to check out and try, but the quality of the seafood is meh (shrimp was overcooked in the stew and the oysters by the shell was pretty fishy). Wait-time: Roughly 40mins on a Monday night around 7pm. Not bad, considering the wait times everyone else has been posting about, but was it worth it? Nah. Line: a bit confusing bc there's some construction happening on the right hand side of their bar...so the line swings to the left now. Tons of ppl missed the line and tried to jump into open seats when they were walking by. Repeatedly. A bit awk once you're sat and the workers have to keep telling ppl to wait in the line. Service: standard. Nothing specular or particularly bad. Food: Shared a dozen raw oysters and another dozen raw clams. The mere size of the oysters were impressive, but had me a bit worried about how fishy they'd taste. And they were pretty fishy... As for the clams, it was fresher, sweeter and had more of a bite to them than the oysters. My personal preference btw the two. And for the main, had the seafood stew. Flavors were on point, but seriously, all the seafood was over cooked!! Whyyy. Esp the shrimp. Pretty disappointing. Btw, this dish was massive. Everyone looked like they were ordering their own, but no one was finishing it. Totally shareable portions. Overall, it was decent. I'm shocked that everyone has been giving such high reviews. I'm glad I tried it, but I wouldn't come back.

Too bad. You'll miss an opportunity to try their amazing pan roast and oysters. If that's ok for you to pass on, go ahead. For me, it was the best oysters I've ever had. Most memorable to me thus far. I'm from Chicago and when you're in Midwest, oysters aren't most fresh. They're also tiny. But these at the Oyster Bar? O m g! I'd fly back just for those oysters! We initially ordered just one dozen for my husband and myself. I typically eat 1 or 2 and tell him I'm done. This time? Nope. I wanted adozen of my own so I've ordered another round of dozen oysters. My husband says, \"I've never seen you eat oysters like that before.\" And he's right. I don't. Why? Not because I don't necessarily like them; apparently it's because I haven't had good ones!!!! An entire dish of pan roast was a little too much for me. Too much, as in the size. I could never imagine myself eating the entire thing while dining there. After reading pro tips on Yelp, I ordered white rice on the side, which was a smart choice. I loved the crab meat the most in my combination pan roast. The shrimp were too small; lobster-- I don't know. i don't know why I didn't like them, but I've picked them out and gave it all to my husband. I did take my leftover as take out and had it later which was still good. I timelapsed the entire cooking process that was in front of me. It honestly didn't seem like the chef was doing much. He was such an expert and I'm sure he does this hundreds of times in a day, so he just dropped off some ingredients. Then drop off some more. Stir it a little, and it was done! I saw the color or the sauce go from really light orange to light red, from their pan roasting procedure. I need one of those at home. Ok, maybe not. I also need their chef, and their secret ingredients & sauce. Then, maybe, I can handle their pan roast instrument at home. :) I waited about an hour on a Tuesday 6pm. Was it worth the wait? Absolutely. Would I do it again? No doubt! Next time, I'm going to make sure I arrive starving so that I will eat even more, maybe 2 dozens of oysters. Service wasn't the best- don't take it personally if they're not nice to you. They're constantly busy with lines of people waiting all the time.

They also give you rice to go with it, which is great after a long night of drinking. I don't think I've ever seen this place without a line, and that makes sense to me. The workers are nice, the food is great and the prices are reasonable (for Vegas standards). Overall I would recommend this place to anyone willing to take a trip slightly off strip for a great meal.

I've eaten here several times, spanning as far back as in the late 90's and have always gotten great food, great service, and YES, there's a wait due to the limited seating area. That's to be expected!!My last visit here was during CES. I think anyone who lives in Vegas or has been in Vegas knows that CES week can be absolute hell in terms of the amount of people that are in town and how crowded restaurants can be. That being said, at 7PM on the first night of CES, our wait time was only 45 minutes. Anyone who has been to Oyster Bar enough times, knows that's nothing!!! I've been here during a regular weekday and have waited up to 2 hours. And still, there were two guys who were being obnoxiously rude, yelling out to patrons eating to \"hurry up! there are hungry people waiting\" and making rude comments about how slow the service was. *NOTE* DON'T BE THOSE PEOPLE!!! If you can't wait a minimum of an hour to be seated for food, don't waste your time standing in line and complaining the whole time. Go eat elsewhere!Now with that out of the way, there isn't anything on the menu that isn't good. Raw oysters are always good, the clam chowder is a must for me (though I still need to try the Alaskan chowder). My husband always gets the Pan Roast (spice level at just 1) and I will sometimes get the shrimp scampi. We both love our dishes, although I will say that on my last visit, chef was a little heavy handed with the rosemary/thyme and it completely drowned out the flavors of my scampi.
