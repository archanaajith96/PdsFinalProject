Once we found parking, we went inside and there wasn't a table to be found at lunchtime. The waitress quickly took us to the outside patio (which to be honest I was not happy about, but I was so wrong!) The back patio is the quintessential Cajun outdoors feel and look! We could not have been happier! They were playing Cajun music and we sat at an open table that was more like a very long bench. When you think \"Cajun experience\" this is what you get! From the hanging lights to the alligator head, it was all there. They have an awesome wait staff that were quick to bring us drinks and to explain their menu. You know you're in Louisiana when you hear that Cajun accent and we knew we had arrived!  It was apparent that they were very proud of the restaurant and boasted of its status as the best crawdad place in town. After searching the menu over we ordered a plate of Fried Alligator (HOLY COW!), the Crawfish Étouffé, The Combo Plate with two different types of fish and the Super Seafood Platter (BTW, All Fried....except the étouffé).  We all tried each other's plates and I can assure you they were amazing! My personal favorite was the alligator and I would order that every time along with whatever else I order. Flat out, this is a must restaurant if you want to have the Cajun dining experience in Shreveport. Happy eating!"}, {"review_id": "56c12vfMAJYc54dRjpi2yg", "user_id": "JvY-L2j0QEwHr9EZ1_Qc8g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Some great crawfish- rest of food I have had- fried fish - broiled fish- jambalaya etc is pretty good alsoIce cold draft beer - service can be a bit slow and place is a tad cramped and loud"}, {"review_id": "GujmRatsfhEV8xbJ9uWvoA", "user_id": "N5uWWaZeDiA9rnoA8leulw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "2018 kicked off to a bad ass startFried fish is the best in town Beer is coolCrawfish are, once again, amazing..And  don't leave without getting some crawfish cornbread..Keep it up guys..!"}, {"review_id": "gveykUTymKTFDtFSPjXQtg", "user_id": "5VlzjxdmNnloK_IWXN6F9g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Okay, so first of all, the food was really, really good, but the highlight of the visit was our waiter Patrick. Patrick was a hoot, extremely personable, and gave us great advice on the menu. We were passing through town and this restaurant was highly recommended by hotel staff. Great call!Everyone was served complimentary cole slaw and pickled green tomatoes as an appetizer. I always judge a seafood place by its cole slaw, and theirs is excellent, so I  was eagerly anticipating the entrees,  which did not disappoint.  I had the Shrimp Po Boy which contained crispy and seasoned shrimp. Very tasty. My wife had the Fried Shrimp which will be my call next time. My daughter might have made the best choice though, with the  Crawfish Fettecuni Alfredo. Extremely flavorful dish with deep flavor. The atmosphere was fun with lots of  Zydeco music.

Awful food. Plain and simple. Avoid this establishment at all costs. We came in at 6:30 on a Friday night. It was slammed. I get it. My girlfriend is a server. We knew there would be a wait and expected it.My girlfriend ordered a beer that our waitress clearly forgot about. We reminded her 15 minutes later when it still hadn't arrived and finally she sauntered over and brought it to us, at which point it was already flat and getting warm.But that's only where the problems started.My friend and I split an entree. It came out first, before my girlfriend's food, and was already starting to get cold. Our waitress told us she brought it to us because \"she didn't want it to get cold.\"Yeah, right. You forgot. Again. After my friend and I got our food, which was the sampler seafood platter, my girlfriend sat there for 15 minutes waiting for her entree. It finally came when we were halfway finished, and was not good.To top things off, my friend and I ordered the fried alligator with our sampler platter to try it, and only 35 minutes after getting our entrees did we receive it. We asked to cancel the alligator, but our waitress awkwardly insisted it was \"on its way.\" Again, another lie. It took another 15 minutes. I personally don't understand how it's so hard to time frying things. All of our food was fried. But apparently, that was just too difficult for this restaurant, as they felt the need to send our entrees in three different waves.As for the food? Blah. Raw oysters were OK, I've had way better in Florida. The seafood was all fried and just very meh. The best thing was the fried fish. Everything else I could have lived without - and I wish we did.A dozen oysters, seafood platter, fried shrimp and a beer was $100 after tip - and I still tipped 10% after some of the worst service of my life. I left feeling swindled, bamboozled and just cheated out of my money. I would have much rather stayed at the casinos and gotten my tail kicked in craps or blackjack - it would have been a much better use of my money.I wish I could somehow get a refund because this was just an absolute joke, but unfortunately, no manager was to be found tonight. Avoid this joint at all costs. I don't live in Shreveport, but even if I did, I don't think I would come back if they paid me to."}, {"review_id": "EMus3xTPCn3OK6KjzJ6qZg", "user_id": "50FWKnraAhuX8DOQt2pHSg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Stopped by here in mid February to have dinner while on my way out west.

Everything about this place is amazing. When we pulled up, the parking lot looked full (it's just a tiny lot lol), so we figured they were packed and we may have to wait. When we walked in, we were seated immediately and promptly greeted by our waiter. This place has a funky Cajun vibe with Bourbon Street signs, Mardi Gras posters, LSU decor, and Zydeco music playing in the background. I loved every bit of it and decided I had to order crawfish since I was in Louisiana. I ordered the small crawfish fettuccine alfredo... let me tell you, this place had not only the best crawfish dish I've ever had, but turned my mother from a former crawfish hater into a crawfish lover. Everything about the dish was phenomenal. The sauce was super rich and flavorful and there were tons of peeled crawfish tails. The bread was toasted to perfection and tasted amazeballs. I couldn't help but say \"mmmm\" with every single bite! My ma got the fried shrimp and I tried one... those things were lightly breaded and fried to perfection with a slight crisp. My dad got a shrimp po boy and he loved his as well. Our dishes also came with a pickled relish and cole slaw, which were not my personal favorites, but were big hits with my parents. Our waiter, Patrick, deserves a special shoutout as well. He was very personable, funny as hell, never let our water glasses get less than half full, and very attentive without lingering. Next time I'm in Shreveport, I will 110% make sure to stop at Crawdaddy's!"}, {"review_id": "c1UNitMJTtKUK2xNWkvKCA", "user_id": "3waLsbW9iAYLuXb0IPbQRg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Great seafood.

When we went in June of 2017 we had such a horrible experience that the owner gave us a gift card and asked us to give them another try. We live about five hours away so it has taken us some time to get back this way to give them another try. Lets put it this way they will not be getting another second change. This time was just as bad as last year if not worse. We arrived a little after 1:30. We were seated immediately upon arrival. We thought that was a good sign. That is where the good ended. Knowing how bad it had been the last time we were there I timed things this time. From the time that we were seated to the time that the waitress came to get our drink order was twenty-two minutes. During this time eight staff members stood up around the register doing who knows what. We even heard on person tell the woman who turned out to be our waitress (an older lady with short red hair) that she had two tables waiting and her response was \"oh well I know I will get to them.\" When she finally came to our table she took two of our drink orders and started to walk off. There were three of us at the table. We had to stop her so she would take the third drink order. Fast forward fifteen more minutes and we finally had our drinks. She tried to walk off before we could place our food order but we again stopped her because we had a feeling if she walked off we would never see her again. We ordered appetizers and three entrees. Again watching the time. Forty-five minutes later and the waitress, who never introduced herself so we had no clue as to her name. showed up at our table with two of the entrees that were extremely well done to the point that the bread that is supposed to be tan was more like burnt to a crisp. When we questioned her as to where our appetizers where she informed us that appetizers are not supposed to come out prior to the meal and they would be out when they were done along with the third entree. Ummm we have been all across this country and of course eaten on the trips and it is news to us that appetizers were to come out after the entrees. It must just be there policy when they cant get their act together. We told her that we had order appetizers and three entrees and we were not going to accept two entrees before the appetizers and we sure weren't going to accept two burnt entrees when there were three of us at the table. We informed her that she could return the food and that we would be leaving. We also informed her that this was there second chance and that they would not be getting another one. She asked us if we wanted to talk to the manager before leaving. We declined because if it is still the same manager as last time, she at least still works there because she was one of the many that were just standing around, it would have not gone any good to talk to her because she is extremely rude and clearly can see the issues and doesn't care. The only person that seemed to be doing any decent work was an African American gentleman who had a crucifix tattooed on his right forearm. He was hustling and busting his butt. Needless to say we walked out. We had a $200 dollar gift card and the service was so bad that we walked out on what would have been a free meal. That is saying something. We felt bad about letting the money go to waste because there is no way that we would ever go back there so we were able to find a homeless man in need of a meal who said that he didn't mind bad customer service and were able to give the card to him. It is pretty bad when the only people who are willing to put up with the horrible service are those people who do not have a lot of options.If food is decent poor customer service can often be overlooked and sometimes even the other way around. With this place horrible customer service and food that is so visually bad that it will not even be tasted results in a place that needs a complete overhaul and someone in there that knows how to not only run a restaurant but who can make staff either do their job or find work elsewhere. We do not want to hear give us another change or anything like that because that would never happen. we do not care if we lived right next door we would never step foot in that place again."}, {"review_id": "tpaInUYVKEcsz-ovooDMYQ", "user_id": "ICoh_A2Sl7NGkmji00iAHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "We had the seafood platter and boiled crawfish everything was amazing !
