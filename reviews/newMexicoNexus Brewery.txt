Walking into the brewery, it has a restaurant feel to this place. The staff is friendly and know their foods and beverages. I can see that this place can be crowded as their seatings are limited. Should a group of friends spend time for dinner and drinks, they could be there for a few hours. The turning of the table can be slow. The foods were very tasty. My friend and I ordered a few dishes to try out such as spicy fried chicken, fried pickles, and collard greens. All the dishes came as described in the menu and the taste was very palatable. The spicy fried chicken had a good kick to it, which could be cooled down with some beers. Speaking of beers, we tried their flights and we were satisfied with the selections. There were some seasonal beers which you may have to give them a call to see whether they have them on tap. Their regular selections are very satisfying as well.Overall, I definitely recommend this brewery to anyone who is interested in having beers and some food at the same time. The only down size is that the brewery opens till 9:30pm to 10pm."}, {"review_id": "mhkJp6vueDlt_NrEUA6LTg", "user_id": "a2aPYEvhrxJyawr8h1qNPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "The genius who decided New Mexican/Soul Food fusion should be a thing and then further decided that it needed to be paired with his own craft beer-- well that person deserves a medal!!  Nexus is my favorite brewery in town, not necessarily for the beers, which aren't bad, but every single food item on the menu is absolutely first rate. From the chicken and waffles to the bbq pulled pork frito pie smothered in red chile and literally everything in between (bacon and green chile Mac and cheese, anyone?). Any one item is enough to make me keep coming back.Add to all of that the very generous rewards  earned as a Nexus Neighbor, and it makes it hard to try out new breweries because we know Nexus has it all and we probably have a $10 reward coming towards our next visit!  The service staff at Nexus is also very attentive and friendly and the kitchen is busy, but efficient!Try Nexus. Take your friends. You won't be sorry you did!"}, {"review_id": "fzg-Gs4KyVSViIiz6ge8GQ", "user_id": "a_FPrPnK-6BXYluuFntE8A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "I had a very pleasant experience at this amazing brewery, not only the food was super delicious and we had a side of outstanding customer service, I admit that I would not expect that coming to a bar. Nexus will give you a whole new experience! We had gone with a party of 4 about 11:00am and it was fantastic because we were one of the only people there, and then it started to get crowded around 11:30ish which was a very good sign! We came to the right lunch spot.We had ordered the chicken and waffles, pulled pork sandwich, and an order of pulled pork nachos and I enjoyed each dish. They were all so fantastic and I couldn't wait to taste each one.The chicken and waffles were one of the best I've tasted here in New Mexico, the chicken was so crunchy and juicy every bite, and i had the butter pecan syrup on the side.... game changer! The pulled pork nachos and the sandwich was so good, they definitely had the flavor spot on. Our server was also great, he made sure to check up on us and give us recommendations.I  would definitely come back."}, {"review_id": "NyZCgyximjjXePSlyHV6Dg", "user_id": "ifPsoDduP0imIUV49WbHrQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "SO. GOOD. I write this review with a FULL stomach and joy in my soul :-) Nexus Brewery is amazing!!Now, my review is NOT about the beer --- I'm not a beer drinker so I can't help you there. The location: Lot's of parking, I came in at 4 on a Saturday -- it can be tricky to find, I had a friend guiding me on the phone, LOL I'll just say this, when you think you are going the wrong way as you pass by some commercial buildings, keep going, you're almost there. Seating/quickness of service: 5 stars I was by myself and they were able to find a good table, by a window fairly quickly. I think I only had to wait about 5 minutes. and they had a good amount of people in there. I was glad to see that I didn't have to wait long. Service: 5 stars The hostess who sat me also took my drink order and let me know who my server would be. My drink order came out right away and the hostess AND server were so nice!! Food: REALLY good!! 4.5I ordered the fried chicken and gravy, with red mashed potatoes and a side of greens. The fried chicken was good, though some parts did taste a bit... rubbery. I can't explain it but some pieces it had the texture of gristle. It was odd because it was pure meat , so... I don't know. It was seasoned perfectly and I ate it all, so clearly I enjoyed it!! LOL!It came with a side of greens (collard greens) and those were good, they had a light taste. I ordered a side of mac n' cheese and it was ok. I needed to add some salt but it wasn't a bad dish and I could see myself ordering the mac n' cheese again. Dessert: I got the fried biscuit bread pudding with Scottish Ale sauce - 5 STARS!!!  The best way to describe this is it tastes VERY much like a beignet without the powdered sugar. SOOOO good!! the sauce that they serve with it was great and I loved it!Tip: That dessert really is big enough for 2 or more,so I ended up boxing most of it because I was STUFFED. OH! I almost forgot one of the cool things (cool to me at least) they don't have Coke or Pepsi. They sell a handcrafted soda called Zuerfizz and I'm usually a \"Coca Cola\" person (NOT Pepsi- I promise it's not the same) but anyway, I tried this cola and it was really good. Had a nice sweet taste, almost like a root beer (maybe?) anyway, try the handcrafted soda if you don't drink beer. What a great place! It was fine going alone, I could see going with friends after work, to watch a game. Nice, lively and social atmosphere."}, {"review_id": "xOz2rKmiKCS9cIQcCX-Zrw", "user_id": "Eoei-rxyyKYY4S9_la4Ewg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "FANTASTIC FOOD!Nexus serves up great soul food with a few New Mexican dishes. On a Sunday expect to wait because the place is booming! But it is worth the small wait. Wings, Chicken and Waffles, Enchilada with an egg on top were all excellent dishes. Our server was very good, placed was packed and she was hustling to get to every table.Nexus, the name is based on a Star Trek movie and you can tell that the owner loves Star Trek based on the autographs downstairs and the new logo which resembles something from the movies.

So i ordered the fried pickles again because there were great last time and this time was no different. But my catfish dinner fell very flat, the fish was cooked ok but lacked flavor. When you claim to be a southern soul food spot I expect to get just that. Everything we ordered was very bland and just didn't taste very good except the pickles. I don't recommend this place if you are looking for good flavor.

Convenient or what?!!Friendly service staff with good recommendations. After a couple of beer tasters, settled on a seasonal brew and the IPA. Dinner for two consisted of Gumbo (added shrimp), just spicy enough for a beer to temper. Also a Fried Chicken sandwich (with bacon) and a side of mash potatoes (with AWESOME white gravy). May I get a hallelujah on that gravy. The only let down, the dessert of peach/cherry cobbler had soggy crust.

This place is definitely 4.5 stars and all because of HOT CHICKEN! I've never had Nashville hot chicken, but I really don't feel the need to. Why go all that way when I can get NM hot chicken here? Guys, I crave this chicken weekly. It's on fire, juicy and I've substituted hot chicken for the tenders, chicken and waffles, chicken breast plate, chicken sandwich and wings. Just ask for hot chicken and keep the beers coming!Side note- get yourself some mac n' cheese or mashed potatoes too. You're gonna slap someone's mama!

Nexus has been on my bookmark list for YEARS. Our recent trip to Albuquerque finally allowed us to try this local joint that was featured on the Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. I read up before we arrived. The owner left his lucrative banking business in order to pursue his dream. He opened Nexus, and the beer and fried chicken speak to his passion. The entire table ordered the 2 piece chicken and waffles. I opted for the boneless chicken breasts for an additional $2. I enjoyed the waffle and the chicken was delicious. They definitely did not skimp on the portions.

We don't drink but we had iced tea which was real good. The chicken is made fresh and comes to you hot from the fryer. The Mac and cheese is made with white cheddar and the hatch chili gives it a real kick. The okra is crispy not slimy with the ranch dip you can eat them all nite. The waffle is soft and with maple syrup and butter.I didn't even use the hot sauce. Next time we come through New Mexico we will stop and enjoy this place.By the way it was featured on diners, drive ins and dives."}, {"review_id": "arRg7sJgQwsWrtn2kvzz4w", "user_id": "yR1HEgxVTbBfv1Yg_BuYRw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/17/2017", "text": "Some days you just need comfort food. And I don't mean something familiar and tasty. I mean something that truly hits you in the soul and makes the world good again. Nexus Brewery does that consistently and will keep you coming back for more. The chicken and waffles are famous here and there's a reason for it. The waffles have just the right amount of crisp and the chicken is juicy. A brewery isn't usually somewhere that I think of for food but lately there seems to be a trend in Albuquerque where that is changing. Nexus is on the front of this change and leading the charge. There really isn't anything on this menu that will steer you wrong.Oh and the beer is good too. Did I mention that? See - that's how good the food is.

She got my drink order a few minutes later but didn't ask if I wanted food. Luckily, there was a menu nearby.  She seemed to not pay attention to the fellow next to me as well.

My husband ordered the gumbo and he said it was good but he kept thinking about the gumbo from Paula Deen's restaurant and it didn't compare.  They do not have a children's menu, but there is a decent list of side items you can order.  My son got an order of the mac and cheese and an order of fries.  Both were pretty good.  It was homemade M&C and not Kraft - yay!  Our server was a little frazzled and could have checked in with us a little more especially when it came to paying the bill.  He was, however, super duper friendly and really helpful with the menu.  He knew the beers well, too.  We like being able to get the opinion of the server on what they like to order and so it was great that he could offer a helpful opinion.Overall, a fun place to hang out.  I'd definitely have that chicken again."}, {"review_id": "G0X6dpsGr6UA48y7ToWLCA", "user_id": "Bc1szaikZAox5Xmh42XfmA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "I was happy with everything here from service to great food.

My bro in law had the open faced enchiladas and thought they were excellent with lots of chicken and amazing green chilis.  Everyone's portions were ginormous- so go easy and maybe plan to share.  The beer was also pretty good. I liked the chocolate porter.  While I wouldn't say this place is not kid friendly, they do not have kids menus and drinks are not kid sized or priced.
