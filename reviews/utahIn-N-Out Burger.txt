However....this burger shockingly shockingly shockingly Out of This World! Each ingredient in the burger is essential to all the flavors you get with each bite. The fries I'm not crazy about, fresh cut but somehow they taste a bit dry and hard. The shakes are also blow your mind good. The east coast needs an Inn N Out and soon!"}, {"review_id": "Plj-ojM509bZrVkBTBX-bg", "user_id": "wxuVZTfo1pThbqfzz97uLg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "Few things are as consistent in life as In-n-Out. I've found that anywhere I go, other than the Las Vegas ones as of a few years ago, they are always the same good burger, good fries, and good shakes. Some people will throw a fit and compare it to $10+ burgers, but that's a weird comparison to make. Compare these to similar prices burgers and they blow them away.  Maybe they are over hyped, but as far as fast food burgers go, I've found them to be the best.  Yes, the $15 burger you had at a sit down restaurant is probably better, but that's beside the point.The drive thru is always solid.  Fast, and I love that they give you place mats and plenty of napkins.  It makes eating in the car an unusual joy.  If you're in the area and need a quick bite, In-N-Out will never do you wrong."}, {"review_id": "Gs4fi5aOescrRMjqY8mfRg", "user_id": "FgClsm9HXKTaYogbbRhV1Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Nothing against this In-N-Out in particular but this is where my second experience was and I have to say I despise this chain fast food restaurant. The west coast hype had me give it a second chance, from LA, Cali to SLC, Utah I'm just not into it. Bland and tasteless food, very greasy.  Secret Animal sauce has no flavor whats so ever and fries suck! May be an appeal to people after a good night of drinking and I mean bombed or homeless people. The sober mind might as well and should go to Shack Shack, Mcdonald's, Wendys, Burger King or ANYWHERE ELSE to get your fast food fix! Although to end this on a positive note this location had very nice and fast staff."}, {"review_id": "HUFC-0K58CF2GVXE_mqJSg", "user_id": "f_wLVKFXyYh74PPEhy_ICA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Sometimes you just want a double double, protein style, animal style, with cut up chilies cheeseburger on a tray with a side of animal style fries and Neapolitan shake on a Saturday afternoon.

Serving fresh ingredients you can taste as well as affable staff that exude elation with every customer.If you really want the full experience this old-fashioned burger joint has to offer, then check out their secret menu that is found in the interweb. Or you can be like me and stick to the straight forward menu and just ask for some extra packets of their sauce cuz there is nothing more tasty. The main issue that most can concur with is that it's usually, if not always, busy, regardless of the time of day. The wait (standing in line and waiting for your food, even in the drive-thru) is fair to say 15-20 minutes. Despite being a \"fast food restaurant\" it is usually the contrary."}, {"review_id": "LnrI0YfP_V5WS7ud_G6j4Q", "user_id": "RfYeWwgE4vpQ55uBv7IvQQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "Who doesn't love in and out burger!? This girl certainly loves this place with her whole heart. You get a burger at a very reasonable price, the people there are friendly and service is usually very fast. The burgers don't look like slop either like other fast food places, and it's made fresh to order. I always end up getting the double double which is my favorite and add pickles to it. Very delicious. The only downfall for in n out personally is that their fries have always been mediocre. I've tried their fries five times and they always have a weird texture. I like my fries crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and this place just doesn't have that. However, I'll still go here and drive fifteen minutes because the burgers are delicious!"}, {"review_id": "MJcpkkVPvIsqK_BCDRdZlw", "user_id": "W6rNl8O6QuIqT5IRDBk4pg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Great place to eat good and cheap food!

Yesterday I went to this location for the first time and decided to switch up my usual order and be one of those people who orders off of the secret menu. I ordered an Animal Style burger, but unfortunately I just got a regular burger. It was as tasty as ever, I'm just bummed they ignored my request for Animal Style since I was looking forward to trying it.Also, our fries were cold and we got mostly the small fries from the bottom of the basket, it looked like.

This location has a fresh and inviting appearance with all eating options available to meet your preference, whether this means utilizing the efficiently designed drive-thru or choosing to eat at one of the many tables inside or outside.   The meals I had here were identical to the top-notch quality I've had at other locations.  The service was friendly and efficient even though they were extremely busy, just like at other locations I've visited.  Bravo to the staff here for working like a well-oiled machine, even under pressure!
