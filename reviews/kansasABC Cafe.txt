This cozy little join is not your typical dim sum spot there are no carts whizzing around just a neighborhood spot serving up bowls of awesome packed tightly and I am not just talking about the dim sum (it's a small dining area, you will see when you get there but if you are luck you may have your own personal tv). They do an excellent job of turning out the orders and making sure your table is not stacked with empty containers.                   I am pretty sure I am addicted to those lotus leaves filled with sticky rice and bits of pork, it's the texture of the rice the steaminess that gets me every time I open it, just get these (you get 2 per order). Yes yes they have that staple of every dim sum meal Siumaai and I do get it every time. I also like going deep and getting items such as the chicken feet, it's a guilty pleasure. Some of the other items that I would recommend that are a bit less off putting but amazingly delicious are the shrimp and pork stuffed in tofu skin and the mixed beef, but if you are in the mood for wings get them you will not regret it, I think this is the first time I have ever had wings and tea! The Steamed shrimp balls are great I believe those diapered with 10 seconds of placed on the table. The BBQ pork bun is also not to be missed with a good filling to bun ratio, with every bite getting perfect mix of filling and bun. It is one those dishes where I like biting into it when its super-hot, the same with the curry beef puff as that meat juices are best enjoyed hot. For sweeter items they have an excellent egg tart with a nice flaky and buttery crust.            Just because this is Dim Sun spot you should not ignore the larger entree's as they are really good my favorite of which is the Sautéed Squid with XO Sauce each bite is perfect with a great mix of  textures for example I love how the veggies are cooked with that snap to the peas, and the squid has that nice springy nature to it, if you like squid you will love this dish. This squid dish is served with white rice but what I like to do is add some Eggplant with Thai sauce to add that sweetness to the rice and complete change the taste of the squid for something different.                 I have only been here a handful of times and absolutely left with a great food coma, you know the ones that make you want to come back not those that turn you away from a food.  I honestly believe there is not a single bad item on the menu thrust me I have checked and double checked to make sure. One of the things I love most about dim sum apart from the sharing nature of it, is you can make some interesting favor combos which are all amazing in their own right, so grab a few buddies head over here and order way too much food and mix it up!"}, {"review_id": "5b1l2jfDFW9o9uQVkzEBCw", "user_id": "6z9rcXC24kC6PhH1ffZ8_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Thank God for all day dim sum! Bring the family and score the lazy Susan table. Pace yourself. Don't overdo it on the cheesy fried shrimp rolls. Save yourself for a whole Snapper. Feel healthy by adding some bok choy to the mix. Immediately undo whatever health benefits that bok choy gave you by ordering another round of fried shrimp rolls. Get your mom some pork porridge. Fact: moms love porridge. Skip the barbecue pork puffs. Warm up with some homey beef stew noodle soup. Get your friend who's never been to dim sum some chicken wings to break them in, then surprise them with how tasty deep fried intestines can be!Did I mention the TVs playing super amusing Asian game shows and dramas everywhere? There are a few BIG screens and then all the outter tables have personal screens. Do I know what's going on? Nope.

The restaurant is small & can be busy easily. Since it's so small they don't take reservations so it's first come first serve. They have several tvs in there with different shows or sports on. I'm sure you can request a channel if they have it. Food is always delicious here. I saw on their menu that they have the Ginger Lobster! I will need to try this next time. We ordered seafood soup, chicken with black bean sauce, mayonnaise prawn, beef chow fun with black bean sauce, soft shell crab & many others. Everything came out hot & delicious. They are definitely an authentic Chinese restaurant.   I was so hungry so I forgot to take pictures & only got our jasmine tea,the seafood tofu soup & our wine we brought in.They don't serve alcohol beverages but allow you to bring your own in which is great! Only beer is served here which that is the only thing you're not allowed to bring in.The staff here is great! Very nice, helpful & friendly people which makes dining here a delight."}, {"review_id": "rYyE4NZcrkuYu-kwXXPRuA", "user_id": "V4zPISLt2eqU1LrWdZ98ZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "A friend and I made the trip to Overland Park, Kansas the other weekend to try the dim sum served at ABC Cafe. I must say this is the best dim sum that I have had since I have moved back to Kansas City from San Francisco! In fact, the food was not much different from what you would get in a highly-rated dim sum house in SF! There are a few important things that one must know about the dim sum experience at ABC Cafe. First, there are no carts being peddled around like you would find in a larger dim sum restaurant; this is by no means an issue, they just have a rather small restaurant to operate out of. Second, dim sum is served all day long, this is quite nice especially for those who may want to eat some of those yummy little dim sum dumplings & other items around dinner time.R.M and I had quite the large dim sum brunch when we dined here and it was not very expensive at all! Just a tad over $30 each (not bad for a ton of food) & we both left there completely fulfilled. We shared all of the dim sum items that we ordered & we were in agreement that all were quite good. My personal faves here were: the scallion pancakes, the shrimp dumplings, the (always tasty) bbq pork buns, and last but not least the lotus leaf stuffed sticky rice. That sticky rice is really out of this world and honestly the #1  best that I have eaten outside of San Francisco! ABC's sticky rice was super glutinous, seasoned & wrapped in the traditional steamy lotus leaf with the rice having little hidden treasures of small diced pieces of crispy pork belly and other various veggies & meats.In addition to their dim sum menu (served all day) ABC Cafe also offers a nice selection of Chinese dishes. R.M and I ordered the XO chicken wings and they were really flavorful! Why did I not give ABC Cafe 5 stars? Well, I guess the biggest reason is that I am judging their dim sum against the dim sum that I was used to eating (like at least weekly!) in SF. Granted this is probably not a fair yard stick with which to judge; however, I do think that if you are in the mood for dim sum and you either live in the Kansas City metro or are just passing through then you should definitely give ABC Cafe a shot...I know that I will be back real soon! Oh and also, I didn't think that the desserts we're very good. Maybe stay away from those and fill up on the savory item?Notes: if you go during peak hours be prepared to wait for a little while...do not fret though, it is worth the wait, trust me;)! The service here is quite attentive and they do a great job of keeping the food coming and the tables turned without being too pushy pushy! I did get the sense that they wanted us to eat & leave asap but again they weren't mean about it:)!"}, {"review_id": "XdUec4BrYlGK9Z5P-BTjLA", "user_id": "KKVbSm8XTPPxPlqK0WZ3-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "I love you, ABC Cafe. First thing - service was superb. Hot tea was waiting for us when we sat down. We were waited on hand and foot. Fast, effective, and friendly. Incredibly impressive for such a tiny place. Food consisted of beef with snow peas, red bean buns, wings, honey garlic pork, vegetable fried rice, shrimp wontons, etc. It was all fresh, cooked exactly right, and delicious. I would come here every day if I could! It's a hidden gem. Note: Most tables have a little TV by them - helpful if you don't want to miss a game. It's small and gets crowded fast. Takeout is available too. Their menu is authentic. The real deal. Chicken feet. Intestines. The good stuff. Please don't come here and want only orange chicken with white rice.

I come from a city with a pretty spectacular China Town, so I can be snooty when it comes to authentic food. Not to mention I brought along a partner who lived in China for a few years. Thus, we were excited but also skeptical about our dim sum needs being met.Clearly the 5 stars I gave speak for themselves. We were oh so happy with our wonderful meal. This is a small place, and it gets busy very quickly. We went on a Saturday afternoon, about 30 minutes after opening, and we took the last table available. Service was super quick - we ordered and had our food in very little time. We ordered the following: turnip cake, scallion pancake, barbecue pork bun, pork potsticker, steamed pork dumpling, and beef chow fun. Our favorites were the beef chow fun and the scallion pancakes, but honestly, all of the food was delicious and brought us to our dim sum happy place.If you are in the general area of Kansas City and hankering for some good dim sum, head on over to ABC Cafe.

Came here with some friends for dinner because I have been meaning to check this place out. It was packed when we got there (Friday 745pm). We were told to wait 15 minutes but we got a table in under 10. It is a smaller sized place. We were seated at a larger table with some strangers, but it was fine. They took our order pretty quickly. I ordered scallion pancakes and BBQ pork buns to start. For the main course I got chicken and eggplant hot pot. Friends ordered abc chicken (like sweet and sour) and salt pepper pork (fried) and a chicken noodle stir fry dish. I tried all of it and was thoroughly satisfied. The only dish that seemed to come with rice was telling abc chicken but there was enough rice there for all of us. I assume it was for our group, not just for abc chicken.Food came out super fast except the noodle dish. My friend was still waiting while we were all enjoying our meal. Maybe if it happened to me, then I would have taken off a star :p.  He ate our food so it was fine for the time being. I must have been craving fried salt pepper pork chop because it was super tasty. Everything was delicious. Water refills were fast too. There could have been more scallion pancakes and BBQ pork buns for the price, but it was good. At the end, we tried to pay for our own meals with who we came with, but the staff member said we all shared the meal so why not just split it down the middle so we did. He jokingly said \"I dont want to have to take your order twice\".  So if that is an issue when you go, you may want to know how you want to pay for the future."}, {"review_id": "Mgi5ydBEiSm5EGQOJkW9BA", "user_id": "n6djCejGrwATGC8GFm6enQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "They accept bitcoin!

You may notice an absence of General Tso's chicken as a helpful hint of its authenticity. I also didn't feel lethargic and bloated after my meal, which often happens to me at American Chinese restaurants.Operated by a family from Hong Kong, the food options make this clear with a variety of Dim Sum options. I personally enjoyed the BBQ Pork Buns, which were very doughy and almost sweet. As far as large dishes, the Softshell Crab was incredible. I also liked that the menu had an above average number of photos of the food so I could get a gist of what I was ordering because I'm not hyper familiar with Chinese food.I personally think the best way to enjoy this food is to buy several items and share them. Bring a big enough group and you can sit at a large table with a spinning tray in the center to properly share dishes (no more awkward reaching across the table!).When I went here for lunch, there were available tables. However, it is a smaller establishment and I could easily see the place filling up on a popular day, fair warning."}, {"review_id": "kj4rPzDJ3PAi5Zve2NaHQw", "user_id": "VOe7LbHxVhZYzz6rDp5iPQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "Hmmm where to start on this review...Well the good first. They have a huge menu especially lots of dim sum. The stuffed eggplant was excellent. I also tried sui mai, pork dumplings, pork and shrimp wrapped tofu, BBQ pork buns, chicken feet, and another steamed bun. The black bean sauce was awesome. The chicken feet had no meat at all and the skin was just chewy. I think if it had been crispy I would have enjoyed it more. The dumplings were good but nothing special, same for the pork buns. Service was unusual to say the least. While I don't expect overly friendly service at most Asian places, I don't except having my plate removed while I was still eating. She literally removed my plate as soon as I picked a bun to eat. Just prior to that she'd tried to take my menu before I was finished ordering. I'm sure I'll be back because I would like to try other things.

I might add, the people telling me this appear a bit racist, but that's another story.Upon walking into the establishment, I thought I might have mistakenly entered someone's living room - the place is seriously cramped. I stood as awkwardly as possible by the front door, waiting to be seated. A wizened lady came over and gestured me to a booth. I was immediately given hot tea and asked what I wanted to eat. I said I needed to look at the menu, and was regarded like a half wit. Two minutes later, I was asked again. I still didn't know. My speed reading skills were sorely lacking on this occasion. However, on the third pass, I was ready, and ordered a hot beef dish. While I waited for my food, I noted I was very close to the next table, and could have easily shared their appetizers with them, had they given me a friendly glance. Alas, no. I also noticed due to the hot and steamy proximity of what I only hoped was cooking steam, and not body steam from nearby diners, my hair was drastically affected, and lost all curl. On the upside, I felt like my face got a free steam bath. The food was okay. Nothing to write home to my Asian ancestors about. Service was quick, almost too much so, as the moment I laid my fork down, someone was there, taking my dishes and washing off the table. Hey, what...Not a bad place.

They are usually closed Tuesdays and Wednesdays which are weird hours. It's usually always busy during lunch time which is 12am to 2pm or dinner time around 5:30pm to 7pm. The place is quite small so be cautious when you go with a big group. I been here often and order the same items and am never disappointed with the food. The service is quick and friendly. There will be multiple people serving you. It has the family restaurant vibe where you just call to someone if you need something instead of waiting for someone to come by. They like to clear the table for you whenever you finish a dish. The dishes I mainly order are Cucumber Salad, XO Chicken Wings, and Shumai (The best pork and mushroom Shumai ever!!).
