Even when it's super busy, lines are proficient and food orders are brought out quick and hot. They did forget one of our orders of fries and hot peppers but it was a quick and easy fix. Besides that our order was correct, which I know can get tricky for large orders. Their Italian beef sandwiches and cheeseburgers are awesome, their fries are perfect, their chopped salads are out of this world, and if you haven't tried their chocolate cake shake or slice of chocolate cake, you need to fix that because it's so damn good.

A friend had recommended it. I'm a fan of Sonic's Chicago dogs, also, so I wanted to try Portillos, as I heard theirs was the best. It wasn't at all what I expected - as one friend put it, it was like Chuck E Cheese on steroids. There were two restaurants in the same building, Portillos and an Italian/pasta fast food place, and it was confusing to figure out which line was which.That being said, the hot dog (Chicago dog) and fries I ordered were tasty and only about $5-6 with tap water, making this the cheapest meal of our trip (yay).

I got a small sandwich but could barely finish half. I loved it and amazed at how lean they get the meat. It's a little confusing the first time. There are different ordering counters, depending on what you'd like for lunch. Now that I've visited, it will be easier next time. We enjoyed sandwiches, fries and drinks. I didn't see one person having a salad. Very interesting decor. Kind of like Pirates of The Caribbean characters suspended from the ceiling. There is no doubt, you are in a midwestern city. I think this is the perfect place for a very hot hearty lunch on a freezing cold day. You could never find these huge fresh beef sandwiches in California.

So, when I was here in town, it was on my short list of places to go check out due to my love for Portillo's.Walking in, it's got plenty of seating and the line went quick.  The place was jammin as expected even for a Monday afternoon.  Of course I went with the all beef hot dog, and only ordered one by mistake.  I got a drink and snarfed it down when it came out.Service was hilarious, as the gal who took my order was a hoot.  She clearly had her job down to a T, which made my life a lot easier.  There's so many good things to eat here that I could repeatedly come back at eat everything on their menu twice.Seating is plentiful and the place is clean. It's located not to far off Michigan Ave, so you don't have to venture to far to get here. Be prepared to walk in at any time and find the place to be a zoo it's just that good. I wish we could get one here in Detroit because I would be queen of this place all day long!

Unlike many other tourist things, the good parts about Portillo's are: 1) It's cheap 2) It's fast 3) It's good. When you walk in, you might be a little confused. There's a lot going on in here. It's set up kind of like a food court, and each stall has its own line. If you're visiting, you'll probably want to walk straight back to the hot dogs and italian beef.When you get to the cashier, they will probably be really rude and not care that you're a tourist who is excited about your meal. It's not you, it's them. After you order, you'll get a number. They'll call out your number in ten minutes or so, and then you'll go up to get your food.I'd recommend ordering a Chicago dog (because you have to, and it's cheap so YOLO) and an Italian beef (because it's the best thing on the menu). You can do both for about $10.Both are really good, but the Italian beef is the star of the show. I got it with both sweet and hot peppers, and it was so good that we went back for another. The Chicago dog is also good with a good snap to it, that neon green Chicago relish, and the poppy seed bun you expect, but the Italian beef is where it's at.If you're visiting Chicago, you kind of have to go here. It's kind of like going to Shake Shack when it was only in New York. It's a fast food place, but it's special because of where you are. And it's fun because people will ask you if you've been here, and with memories of your delicious Italian beef in your mind, you can confidently say yes."}, {"review_id": "0plUXvSY4JVN6fgzRO5ZAw", "user_id": "mIEh1Z_3JYUrLYFwuVONSg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Born and raised in Chicago.

I went on a Saturday at lunch time and it was packed but the line really doesn't take too long and we still were able to get a seat. I, of course, went for the Italian beef (dipped, with hot peppers and cheese sauce) and it was a beautiful sight. The fries weren't great which is why I took a star off but, honestly, I don't think you need fries if you're about to consume that much greasy meat. Yes, of course, it's greasy and probably 2000 calories for one sandwich, but don't go to Portillo's if that's not your intention. This place didn't feel like a tourist trap, keeps the prices low, and moves through the huge lines super quickly (for reference I was order number 238 and they were well into the 400s by the time I was eating).If you're in Chicago, even for just a few days, you have to go.

Whenever out of towners come in, I always bring them here! They always love me for it.Why? It's cheap, fast, low-key, and delicious. My go-to's are the Jumbo hot dog and the Italian Beef. Actually, make that 2 Jumbo hot dogs. Once you pick up your order, tackling these monsters certainly is an art form by itself. With the hot dog, the key is to make sure you're using your index finger to secure the pickle in place while holding the bun with your thumb and middle fingers and gracefully stuffing the entire hot dog in your mouth in one swift motion. Make sure you're leaning over the wrapper because chances are a tomato or some relish may fall as casualties in the crossfire. If you're doing it right, you'll be able to finish the jumbo hot dog in a quick yet GLORIOUS three bites. The italian beef, however, requires a more intricate plan of attack. First, be prepared for messy. The italian beef is a full sized, meaty beef sandwich that's doused in beef broth at the end. Don't be bringing a first date here if you want to enjoy the sandwich to the fullest without worrying about if there's anything on your cheeks. Second.. nvm that's it. You're on your own.
