It was juicy and seasoned just right, with bacon. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a good burger.Update: this burger was on my mind and I had to go back. Still good.

The margarita was good, just a little small."}, {"review_id": "u2b2yojb7E6l5-FzyXnj8g", "user_id": "jEvtIRdSLIbPt2jSn-wZWA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "A few years ago I would have given them four stars. But now, things have gone down hill. They recently changed management and they're cutting corners trying to save money. Multiple visits have been a let down and we've finally decided we're done with this Hopdoddy. Sad day. While trying to save money, they run out of food fast. Two Sunday nights now, they only have half the menu available to order. Half the menu! Sunday nights are usually packed for them. You think they would plan better. Not only were they low on menu items, they've been known to run out of condiments. Ketchup in particular. WARNING: BYOK POSITIVE: Great milk shakes. I'll be back if I have a hankering for a salted caramel shake."}, {"review_id": "ed8tIMDUTcKpbPbwldTdVw", "user_id": "KfvOpIDzjTkTTXn6kiCi7Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "YUM!! We came here on a Saturday around noon and it was pretty empty with minimal wait. Service was so friendly and prompt I would have rated this high even if the food sucked. I got a normal burger and the Lil Prick, and my husband got the spicy burger with fries.Okay I had to steal some of the fries because they were really tasty. The burger was the perfect size for me and honestly was really pretty to look at. It reminded me of a better version of an In-N-Out burger. The Lil Prick packed a lil punch! It wasn't too sweet which was nice, but I would have loved it more if it were a tad bigger :)"}, {"review_id": "dRZD7v0ut0UqSyFZZVKy3A", "user_id": "YcVjZ7H7RE8rAT6frz6RZw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "So after having to repeat my to go order to the server 3 times I got home with my burger completely wrong. I asked for no avocado (I'm allergic), onion, or pesto. & sure enough avocado, onion, & pesto were all on my burger, I asked for lettuce &  there was no lettuce, I also asked for a different bun. I get it I'm that person that has a complicated order but I got home & took a bite to then realize something I'm allergic to was on the burger, thank goodness I don't have a serious allergy but if I had that's where I see the issue, not sure if it was the server or the cooks fault but make sure you're really biting into what you thought u ordered.

The truffle fries are good and the garlic fries are good but they're salty.

I love a good burger with fries and Hopdoddy delivers. We came during their Happy Hour on a quiet Thurs evening, and there was no line. During their Happy Hour (4-7pm and 9pm-close), their infamous parmesan truffle fries, delicious drinks, and select burgers are discounted (ask a waiter which burgers). When we came, I got the Boardwalk Burger for $5. It's a summer special from 6/28-7/11 so grab one while you can!The Boardwalk is a beef patty with kosher hotdog, chile con carne, cheddar cheese, tomato, shredded lettuce, pickled relish, diced onion, and sassy sauce (blend of mayo and house-made horseradish honey mustard). It's delicious - almost like a classic American hotdog in burger form - perfect for the summertime! It's a bit messy though with the chile so I eventually resorted to using the knife and fork they provided with the burger. My friends and I split a large order of the Parmesan Truffle Fries, and trust me, they are to die for! I couldn't stop eating them. Lastly, my friend got their summer special Chocolate Cherry Bomb Shake (available 6/28-7/11) which was immensely satisfying. It had brownie bits inside and wasn't too heavy to slurp. Yum! Summary: food 5/5, service 5/5, ambiance 4/5."}, {"review_id": "ffWDXJQJfcwGKiguBHRy8w", "user_id": "PXahFh3gyJYqjwlWwp0uNw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/23/2017", "text": "I understand that I'm probably the last person in DFW/ATX to try Hopdoddy, but I have my reasons. I was intimidated by the long lines tbh, but they move somewhat fast and they have a system in order for assigning tables which helps out a lot.I ordered a burger with BBQ sauce, onions, and other toppings that I don't quite remember. My burger was cooked to well done perfection without being dried out which is not very common, so well done, Hopdoddy! Get it? Like, good job? Anyways. I was a little underwhelmed by the size of the burger in comparison to other burger joints, but at least the quality was there. The BBQ sauce was way too runny for my liking, so I'll opt for a different burger next time.They have monthly specials like the Juicy Lucy that's currently on the menu, so check that out before deciding on your order. Oh and you can customize an alcoholic milkshake at the bar, so I'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "w1mP4Aflm98Ul64ZMjCBGA", "user_id": "p47CQe-EtDqFjpre7O0GWg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "It was my first time trying the famous Hopdoddy joint and I was not disappointed.  It's a very chill bar atmosphere with an order at the counter set up.  I tried their El Diablo burger and it was the perfect combination of heat and spice.  Hubby tried the bean burger which he really enjoyed.  The truffle fries are much raved about here but if you're not in the mood, go for the large order of sweet potato fries to share or for yourself.  No one is judging.  Other burgers that are supposed to be phenomenal that I definitely want to try next time are the Good Night and the Prime Time."}, {"review_id": "hs-mVAB-up16pUcFkmxEww", "user_id": "1yg2fxUfTB-qLykvE3FY_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/21/2017", "text": "Loved it!

We told him we were new and he told us how they bake their own bread, use local sources, etc. My friend and I were not that hungry so we just split a Classic cheeseburger and fries. The fries were Kennebec fries-made from special starchy potatoes to give the fries a special crispiness -yum! They also had Parmesan truffle fries-will have to try next time!

Some days they're absolutely amazing, food is great, service is great. Some days I would get cold burger or stale fries that barely has any seasoning. The one burger I usually go for is the Prime Time, SPECIFICALLY well done. Not sure why they would keep the patty \"pink in the center\" as default because not everyone is comfortable with it. Steak maybe, but not burger patties. The only one thing that hasn't failed me here is their Oreo milkshake. This is it! It's more like melted ice cream goodness mixed with chunks of Oreo instead of Oreo blended in and getting lost in the milkshake. The hint of cinnamon is the cherry on top!Parking can be a little tricky but it's doable, you can park on the streets or in the parking garage.

I ordered the parmesan fries with the truffle oil- DELISH. It's big enough to serve 2-3 people. Also ordered the good night burger, the bbq sauce is good on it! I was a little skeptical bc I'm not a fan of BBQ but this was good. Medium rare of course. Also ordered the la \"benito\", don't know if I spelled it correctly but instead of the bean burger, we switched it to the beef burger. Very delicious! With a side or regular fries.
