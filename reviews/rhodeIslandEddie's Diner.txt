We were greeted when we walked in.As soon as we sat our drinks and coffee order was taken. Exceptional service. We ordered and it wasn't long before boom! Giant plates of food arrives. First words from party, \"hash browns are incredible\".They were really really good. Eggs cooked perfectly. I enjoyed sausage more than bacon. Pancakes were done nicely. My only wish is better syrup or offering option to order real maple syrup. I'm a syrup snob. The syrup offered was a dissapointing but everything else was so good.One of owners kept checking on us as well as our server. Really enjoyable breakfast. My first time here and won't be my last. Now, if you try Eddie's and enjoy it don't tell anyone. We all still want to be able to get a seat."}, {"review_id": "C7zhnoeDgO40KtOHLJ8djA", "user_id": "a16brpY5SqqkRVZXKldI6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Small quaint little diner with very friendly staff. incredibly fair prices and they were very generous with portions as well.No wait time to be seated and they serve you in record time. looking forward to visiting again soon!"}, {"review_id": "OGmY1YMiMLZ3yVzusiezZw", "user_id": "7J-N0Y14f0ukIAHsufBiZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "Huge portions, great tasting, staff is super fast and Paula is a rockstar!!We walked in and were seated right away - no wait.

I decided to try somewhere new and stumbled upon this place. The diner is tucked away in a cute little plaza that is located right next to the bike path. Walking in, you instantly feel at home with all the seasonal decor.The ham steak breakfast special was a generous portion. The ham was tender and juicy and the eggs were cooked how i wanted them. I got blueberry pancakes with the special which were buttery and delicious. The home fries were perfectly seasoned. This was a lot of food and I had to get a to-go box. The other dish ordered was the chorizo and egg special. The chorizo was grilled just right and was flavorful. We had the pleasure of having Paula as our server. To be honest, she made our experience worth coming back. We did not stop laughing thanks to Paula's funny personality and lively attitude. This place is definitely worth the money and I'll definitely be back on a Friday to try some of their fish specials!"}, {"review_id": "DslPwOXubW8mQWDc1q4gDA", "user_id": "qKhxciaM7rdFZYSl5QQSYA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Omg is all you can say!!!

It was certainly the highlight of the meal. -The menu was pretty basic, but the portion sizes were HUMONGOUS. Like, seriously, gargantuan. I got a vegetable omelet and let me tell you, this thing was stuffed with so many vegetables that it could have been split four different ways and given each person their daily serving of veggies. -Coffee was great. I asked where it from, and the waitress said \"Excellent Coffee.\" Not familiar with that brand, but I guess the name speaks for itself. -Paula was such joy. It was probably 6:30 AM when we went, and she was perky and joyful. There was an obvious sense that there were \"regulars\" who came there at the wee hours, but she welcomed us just the same and remembered both of our names as we left."}, {"review_id": "6Xd_NVRRWjI2ErcLzDH0Bg", "user_id": "nuKdo3yKCRLkj2otIRUWTg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "Great food!

My ham steak(s), which encompassed a whole plate, were very lean, tasty and cooked just right.  Basically, everything was outstanding, except for the sausage links, which were not on par with the quality of the rest of the meal.As other reviewers have written, portions were enormous.  A 'starving' teenager, Ricky only finished half his breakfast!  When you consider that he really got two breakfasts' worth of food for less than $11, that really comes out to a little over $5 for a full breakfast!  With the leftovers we took home, we both have breakfast for Christmas morning.The staff was attentive and had neat uniforms.  We were greeted and seated as soon as we walked in.  It was only moderately busy; the food was ready in a reasonable amount of time.   We arrived around half past noon, and since they were open until 2 p.m. on Saturday,  I originally had hoped to have lunch, but they only serve breakfast on weekends, I was told. Besides no lunch on weekends, the only minor complaints I had were the lackluster sausage, and the fact that our waitress did not ask how our food was after we started eating it (she was attentive to coffee refills, though).  Overall, though, these small negatives were not enough to lower my rating to four stars, especially in light of the quality and generous portions of food.  I would definitely like to return on a Friday, when they serve an extensive array of seafood dishes."}, {"review_id": "72uaH0l7yA2iuwN2dh70Ow", "user_id": "efG-9LYACuApnoQlqlzrzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Awesome place.

Nestled on the side of the road hidden in a little strip mall is Eddie's Diner, if you blink you just might pass it.Cute, quant little family owned business where PAULA and her girls cater to your every need. The food portions are incredible if you aren't leaving with a takeout box you need to go on a diet. We ordered the baked stuffed shrimp and the chicken cutlet dinners. They come with soup or salad and a side. We opted for clam chowder (creamy white) and a garden salad. The white chowder was really tasty, PAULA came out with a side dish of the red to try. To be honest it was really really tasty and would most defiantly get that the next time. I'm some what of a chowder snob, and I really enjoyed the taste. Now with the baked stuffed shrimp we got mashed potatoes and Cole slaw (FYI the slaw was sweet and tangy and just all around good) the potatoes were creamy and loaded with butter. With the chicken cutlet we got slaw and french fries...not enough time in the day to eat enough fries....they were crispy and not greasy. The shrimp was ample, cooked just right, the stuffing, and again in somewhat of a food snob was a little too greasy for my liking, and I don't like to taste the bread crumbs, however, that wasn't my dinner I just got to try one. My wife enjoyed it very much and ate every bite. The chicken cutlets (3 3\" cutlets per order) a definite share plate were covered in brown gravy and very tasty. Crispy outside tender and juicy inside.Just beware the drinks (soda)  are cans and when you  start eating and refilling it adds to the bill quickly but all and all it was an enjoyable dinner, only thing missing was the baked apple pie à la mode.Thanks again PAULA it was pleasure meeting you and we will see you again soon for breakfast next time!"}, {"review_id": "_sOJxvOPy80VD5JIFwqDJA", "user_id": "-06Oh5wyl3QnNT1P9HBgnw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2017", "text": "This place is very easy to miss driving by, as its located in an unassuming strip mall on Dyer Ave, but its definitely worth a stop by!The food here is delicious, amazing and the portion sizes are HUGE!
