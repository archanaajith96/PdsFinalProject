They said this is their new favorite restaurant and we could certainly see why. All pasta is handmade. The staff is very friendly and the owner even came over and greeted us. Italian bread they serve is also the real deal. Food and service could not of been better. Wasn't that busy can't understand why. With food like that they should be packed all the time.Although our friends said they went there for Valentine's Day and the place was packed. For anyone who wants a real authentic Italian experience this is the place.Can't wait to go back."}, {"review_id": "aU5V0KEyxlIa3Xg8U8qijQ", "user_id": "Xpk4Lj99kxRv-cEz__N6qw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "How completely surprising that one can get a real taste of Italy in Bridgeport, CT!  It is a most welcomed surprise!This place is fantastic.  Simple, understated decor. Simple and varied menu, and pure Italian style in the attention to detail and fresh ingredients.This restaurant is not like many of the standard Italian/American restaurants frequented.  Our waitress was wonderful, offering suggestions and ideas while being most patient with our difficulty in deciding what to order.  She was warm and friendly, attentive without being annoying, allowing us to thoroughly enjoy the food and flow of conversation.  That is how the Italians do it.  Many specials were offered and they all sounded divine. We ended up ordering a lovely arugula, beet and goat cheese salad to share. Excellent! Fresh, crusty bread with olive oil to dip was brought to our table. Then came the pasta dishes: Spaghetti Carbonara and homemade gnocchi with sauce.  The Spaghetti Carbonara was amazing. Pasta perfectly al dente, pancetta done just enough to add to richness of the dish while offering wonderful texture. Just enough pepper to bring out the flavors without masking them. Serving size was ideal, particularly if one opted to follow the traditional primo piatti and subsequent meal courses.The homemade gnochhi (I find it hard to pass up homemade gnocchi-ever) was deliciously fresh, firm enough to hold the sauce, yet melt in your mouth goodness. The sauce was also most fresh and simply  seasoned and an ideal compliment to the gnocchi.  And then the panna cotta!   Just try it.We will be back! Hopefully weekly.This will definitely be a go to spot for me in Bridgeport!"}, {"review_id": "ezEy5cRYHTcuV2R6CSSPTw", "user_id": "rwinVOl6-y58YIWr_Lp5jQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "There are three types of Italian restaurants: Italian-American, Authentic Italian by Americans, and the most rare: Authentic Italian by Italians. This restaurant is one of three restaurants in Fairfield County that I am aware of that fits the rare definition of an Authentic Italian restaurant by Italians and the only one that I am aware of with a kitchen staff that is actually from the region from which the food originates. All the negative reviews about A Vucchella are predictably American complaints. When I read the negative reviews I immediately knew this was a real Italian place run by real Italians because all of these complaints highlight how things are supposed to be in Italy.If you have ever been to Italy, the food and service is exactly like you'd expect at a restaurant on a summer night in Sorrento. The food will great but it will be made for Italian palates, not American and it will come slowly and they won't bring the check until and unless you go out of your way to flag them down and ask. The food will not be spicy, it will not be piping hot, served in large portions or doused in heavy sauce. Your carbonara will not have cream in it, your fresh mozzarella will be the saltier variety from Caserta province - considered the best in the region surrounding Naples (where the cooks are from). The gnocchi are like light pillows, the sauces will be light and not loaded with meat or seafood, your steak will be over-cooked because \"medium-rare\" isn't a thing in Italy, and the calamari will be better grilled than fried.If you're looking for fried anything, penne alla vodka and fettuccini alfredo, cream in your carbonara, or rapid service any different than you'd expect on \"the continent,\" this place is not for you. If you want to go eat in the Province of Naples for a night without a passport, then there's no place better than A Vucchella."}, {"review_id": "VarPAd1E_Kd0ExwWLNmB2Q", "user_id": "yeV7jyIEmMhmJB9Xiocl3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "I'm hesitant to give this five stars for fear of too many people finding out about it.

When you know this veggie and know how it gets wet, funky and mushy when it gets old....... well cook that (over cook it) and serve it.  Terrible.  A private message went unanswered - this is the public one"}, {"review_id": "un-rPUpt-Nh07NBw_tAFtg", "user_id": "jMeFteT1cDsdNok4TvaydQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/14/2017", "text": "I am not a pizza and pasta person. When I go to an Italian restaurant, I order the fish or vegetarian dish. This is because most Italian restaurants cook with lots of salt and sugar and top everything with cheese. This restaurant was really different and our entire experience here was superb from the table service to the rustic food. We had the mains of shank, gnocchi and branzino and enjoyed them all. Everything tasted home made - I especially enjoyed my shank which was slow cooked in white wine with a side of mirepoix. We then shared the panna cotta and mille feuille washed down with an espresso. Needless to say I had a great dinner here and I would come back in a heart beat."}, {"review_id": "J_ELZ3AGSV5PKxfAgxAbDA", "user_id": "bT_0aGHblJKjF0628EgoWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "I have drove by this place a thousand times and never paid it any attention. \"Ah, just another place downtown that's going to close soon\" I thought to myself.

Original review (5 months ago)We had a great experience here! Pasquale the owner is outstanding and makes you feel like you are on the Amalfi Coast.  He seems to be a genuinely great guy who cares about his customers and restaurant. We had the zucchini Parmesan for an appetizer, gnocchi in a creamy crab sauce and papparadelle with lamb ragu.  If you like restaurants that go beyond the \"normal Italian\", this place is for you.
