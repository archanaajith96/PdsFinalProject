I was hungry and didn't have breakfast yet so I decided to stop by. I was totally satisfied.I think that Sarah's Bagel Cafe would be perfect to brunch. Bagels are typically breakfast, but here it turns into a lunch food. They have shakes, juice, and chips. I did not see any hashbrowns or tater tots as an option. If they served Bloody Mary this place would be more than perfect.I have never seen so many choices of bagels in my life. I wanted to try them all! I got the BLT on a plain bagel and it was wonderful. I think I have been preparing my bagels wrong because the ones served here are the perfect texture."}, {"review_id": "eJ_z97PSND9DkgTsAHe74g", "user_id": "yrBxqMkCx19SNdd71DpcRA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/5/2017", "text": "Wonderful bagels, so fresh!!

However, the coffee is awful. I decided to go with something basic (vanilla latte) to test it out, and he didn't need to finish making it before I knew it wasn't going to be good...the shot was quick and watery and he steamed the milk for all of 10 seconds...there was no foam and it was luke warm.

We come for breakfast, my favorite is Sarah's Special, #17. Delicious! Fresh spinach and mushrooms, avocados and egg. Bagel of choice is the super seed, very flavorful.

When I arrived I was very happy to see a display case packed full of homemade bagels. However after I ordered I realized THEY MICROWAVE EVERYTHING...  Ew. It took everything in me not to leave as soon as I realized. To me that is just tacky..  Especially when your paying $5-$7 for a sandwich.

On my first trip to Sara's bagel cafe,I ordered a jalapeno and cheese bagel with herb cream cheese. The bagel was warm,soft and delicious. The herb cream cheese had an excellent flavor. The price is reasonable for the simple fact that its homemade. Basically you get what you pay for,so skip the grocery store bagels and grab yourself a fresh bagel"}, {"review_id": "Vze8MnXb2Nhj1it_gUhS0A", "user_id": "4QrPLLHySscbe_Oa2PqSVQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/19/2016", "text": "Like some others have mentioned, I was disappointed to find out that everything that goes onto a sandwich is microwaved. I'm not prejudiced against microwaves in general, but microwaved eggs are just never quite right. The salsa was just out of a bottle of Pace, so there isn't a whole lot that's \"homemade\" except for the bagels themselves. If it weren't for the truly excellent bagels themselves as a medium, it tastes like something you'd make at home. That said, the bagels are really excellent. The sandwich tasted good; I would recommend it with the caveat to know what you're getting into."}, {"review_id": "rLPlmjxixU2iTQwzWsWmxA", "user_id": "oxMYhDth9f5v3UlTSkHoXw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/10/2016", "text": "Such a treat to have something like this in Nampa.

I've ever had in a long while. This place is definitely a true hidden gem and i am so glad i stubble upon it! One of the best places in the area to get your morning bagel or afternoon sandwich. As expected the bagels are made fresh everyday and are amazing. Their prices are very competitive, their quality of food is excellent and their customer service is out of this world. Like they always say- price is what you pay, value is what you get. If you want a lousy bagel please do down the street!Thanks for the great customer service as well!!Keep up the good work!
