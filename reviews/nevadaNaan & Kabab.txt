One star deduct for serving Mexican salsa in \"Persian\" restaurant...a basic celantro and green pepper salsa is easy enough to make...also the meat was over buttered and was crying out for some acidic lemon or salsa.2. Another star deduct is for old or poor rice...Persian rice is famous...what I was served was anything but a poor attempt at rice.Service was good and hope this rating will help correct some of the basics that can be fixed for zero cost."}, {"review_id": "TjixD9y0Wj2N1pSgMU7BfA", "user_id": "aWFYHUyhbD5Uhp23boFGzw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "It was pleasure meeting you in person MR.

The only let down for me was the service took a bit too long. So, if you're heading here, do prepare to be patient. My friend and I ordered chicken kabab and rice, as well as he chicken kabodeheh. The portions were pretty big and filling, and were served hot.. nothing like a fresh Made meal the kabodeheh had a lot of good spices and tasted delicious. It came with some salad too which was fresh. We also got an awesome dude ice cream! It was AWESOMEEE it has a traditional ice cream covered with baklava.. do try this. You will not be disappointed.Other than the speed of service, I had no compliant. The place is a bit more pricey than other food joints nearby, but they have larger portions too."}, {"review_id": "cnLkG1VGYME_HDETjEe8Yw", "user_id": "6YT-nF271c6fOMienWWwDA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Terrific food and wonderful Service!

Not sure why we waited so long!!! The chef greeted us himself, let us know about his specials and his favorite and came out to check on our table two more times during the meal. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful and the food was delicious! We ordered the Vegetable Combination starter. It was preceded by a big basket of freshly baked, piping hot naan bread cut into triangles served with a spicy dip reminiscent of salsa. I didn't think I would be a fan of the dip but it was really a nice combination. Our Vegetable Combo came out quickly, it had amazing dolmades, three larger falafel balls, and a small pot of hummus and another of baba ganoush as well as some picked veggies. It all worked really nicely together and was the perfect starter to share. For my main entree I ordered the Chicken Koobedeh, on advice of a friend. The skewered meat was well seasoned, tender and delicious. It came with incredible rice that was perfumed with safforn, a grilled tomato and grilled onions. Especially after having eaten my weight in naan and filled up on my starters the portion seemed huge and I gladly took half home for the next day. For dessert we ordered the house special that they call the \"Awesome Dude\" apparently the chef told us this name came about because the dessert was just that....awesome...dude! Indeed it was pretty awesome. It came with saffron ice cream dotted with pistachios and topped with house made baklava. I love things sweet but this may have been a little too sweet even for me. That said, if my dining partner wanted to split one next time I visit, I wouldn't term it down. All and all the meal was great, the chef and staff so friendly and the ambiance lively and energetic. I will go back sometime again soon!"}, {"review_id": "0435cY-8XnVYJDsd3alhew", "user_id": "-Kv9DMBZGQyf2WSKDR7LwA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Go Jessica!

The restaurant was very clean and we were the first at shortly after 5 for the dinner service. I did catch the Tom, our waiter having his dinner, I felt odd that he got up in the middle of a bite to seat us. But the rest of the service for dinner was great. Fresh naan and dip was delicious. The saffron cream pasta with chicken had nice flavor and lots of fresh crunchy vegetables. And plenty to share and still had left overs. The lamb kabob was a prefect medium rare and incredibly tender, but on the gamey side with bit a of seasoning coming thru. The grilled veggies on the side still had nice firm texture. And the dessert- always awesome- saffron pistachio ice cream topped with chunks of crispy sweet baklava. I'll return, as I live almost across the street, but I'll try a couple other dishes next time."}, {"review_id": "zw209Xw8bBJ27-WKFgY0Ig", "user_id": "EviSnShkNTq26IhBiMhc2w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Homemade Mediterranean food done very well.

I came here for the first time with my boyfriend a few weeks ago - we are always on the hunt for authentic mediterranean/middle eastern food. His family is Iranian so he really knows what's up! and well.. he approved. Our waitress and what I assume to be the owner (Claudia) knew all the right lingo to convince him this place had the goods. And when our food arrived (we ordered so much!!!) it was all fantastic. Then today I took my dad for lunch and again, very pleased with everything. Both times we've gone for lunch on a weekday and we were the only ones in the place surprisingly! Also when we were leaving the owner, a very sweet older man who I again assume to be the face of the place, asked how everything was and then gave us free dessert cards for next time. So nice! We will back to claim that free Baklava. :)"}, {"review_id": "XoeaTjacfc4jMkC6gcHzIg", "user_id": "EYDrkh3sBaJO6VhAcJAMLQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Delicious Persian food at moderate prices! Nan & Kabab is a causal and funky mom & pop operation just across from the Peppermill Hotel. My wife and I are seasoned world travelers and serious foodies and always seek out unusual dinning opportunities. We found the food here to be quite authentic, nicely prepared with fresh ingredients, and generally well priced.The menu is varied and quite interesting. There are several overpriced entrees (probably for unsuspecting tourists), but the simple dishes and sides are just marvelous and a real value.We were staying at the Peppermill and were a bit tired from a full day, so we made several selections and did take-away. We just walked across the street and dined quite well in the comfort of our room. The food was simply marvelous and the generous portions were more than we could finish.If you're looking for adventurous dinning -- or even something more familiar -- Nan & Kabab serves excellent food from the Middle-East. The broad menu offers affordable choices for dinning inside or take-out. We would come again and can recommend the terrific food served here."}, {"review_id": "Ar5rZk9LAzIbtrZI1lSexg", "user_id": "SmthNLH6QhlBjbLdZQjQNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "This place is great.
