This place has bar seating as well as tables. The bathroom is located at the front of the restaurant.We had already gotten some drinks that night, so we decided to just get some food. We shared the poutine starter and the Carnivore pizza (pics attached). The poutine was made up of fingerling potatoes, meat, and sauce. I was expecting fries so I was caught a little off guard, but it was actually very good! The poutine was the highlight of my experience here. The Carnivore pizza wasn't the best pizza I've ever had, but I'm sure different people have very different likes and dislikes for pizza. The pizza here had a medium crust (not too thin, not too thick), and was more on the heavy side. It definitely did the job, but just wasn't a pizza that amazed me. Perhaps next time I come I should get some drinks, given that it's a Tap Room."}, {"review_id": "Yp2-0hPdAsRL6IjjrklhDw", "user_id": "Ft3meYP9Nyb4b15L22dkFQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "We went here before a show at the Benedum center and it was pretty disappointing. Two people, two appetizers, one 8slice pizza, a couple drinks each and desert for a total of $110. The ambience was nice except that they had made sure to squeeze a butt into every possible square foot in the room so it felt cramped and hard to get around. Wait staff was nice, no complaints there other than the fact that we felt like maybe our waitress was kind of hoping we'd eat and run instead of stay and chat over our $13 drinks. The drinks were the best part of the meal. Everything else was OK. If the end of the night bill would have been half as much I may feel less negative about it, but clearly this was not good demanding the cost and the ownership obviously just sees the location as warranting charging $18-25 per mediocre dish. The Cheesecake was not really Cheesecake but a dry bread style cake with a thin layer of cheesecake ontop. The greasy lack luster pizza could have been bested by any number of cheap pizza joints. The appetizers were nothing to write home about. All in all...The people were friendly and it was a move spot to kill some time before a show with a couple drinks. But nothing more than that."}, {"review_id": "HhC7WgNRfXAFvG5U_ylOsw", "user_id": "UdbvIleQQfqiFBFxD1Ckug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "We popped into Proper for lunch on a whim.

Proper is located in the theatre district and very easy to find. Dine at a table or at the bar---preferred, so you can chat it up with the other patrons. The ambience is warm and casually classy. I dined on their Amalfi salad and the carnivore pizza minus sausage, add mushrooms. One bite of the salad with the juicy kalamatas and lemon shallot vinaigrette left me just wanting more and more of it. Something so basic yet so full of flavor--it was good. The pizza was cooked perfectly...brick oven pizza with chewy crust and delicious sauce slathered on just right with a nice  throw of meat and oozing cheese. I mean damn...just get you some!Lastly, my cocktail for the evening was the blackberry rhubarb smash that was simply righteous.  Rum combined with the fruits, iced tea  made edgy with some lemon.

Came on a Saturday late afternoon, not busy at all. Had the ocean pizza, which was unique and delicious (I loveee seafood but haven't really come across seafood pizza before) and my friend ordered the carnivore, which had a ton of meat on it, although wasn't as special of a pizza (in his words). The crust is my favorite part, firm enough to hold toppings but soft and seasoned enough that it feels like a breadstick! Little overpriced but would come again."}, {"review_id": "hKU64vuEwUMtCJDUCGa2SA", "user_id": "mtrwciirsnKJGleYFfXYCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/23/2017", "text": "Such freshness in their ingredients.  This is one of my nieces  (14 yrs old) favorite restaurants downtown Pittsburgh.

Four of us shared the pepperoni and cheese starter, followed by the Tuscan Sausage Soup, and various salads, including the BLT Salad.  All very lovely and tasty.  We also chose the Mediterranean and White Pizzas.  These pizzas would have been perfect for two...  had it not been for the appetizer, soup and salads.

We went on a Saturday, and it was busy, but we were seated in about 10 minutes or so.We both ordered a Proper House Salad that is prepared with goat cheese, pear, and candied walnuts, and tossed with a white balsamic dressing. You have the option to have the half size ($6) or the full size ($10; pictured). We both opted for the regular size since we were hungry, and it's a good thing we did because the salad wasn't that large. It's not that we wanted to fill up on salad, but for $10 each, I think the salad was over-priced. We ordered the carnivore pizza, and it was so good that we ordered one to go for lunch the next day. It was just the right amount of pizza. I usually prefer a more seasoned tomato sauce on my pizza, but since there was a lot of flavor with the different meats, the overall taste was pretty balanced. The price of the pizza was a little high ($17-$18), but this was a special occasion. We finished the night with the strawberry-lemon cheesecake. I didn't get a chance to take a picture of this because it was so good! I didn't even look at the cost on this part of our meal.Overall, the experience was really great! We had a great time, great food, and great service. We will probably go back, but not frequently due to the cost."}, {"review_id": "DSjaRdhEu7lIwAuI9wq24A", "user_id": "hg71CGHy9bwpgY8cGVVg4w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/6/2017", "text": "Wife and I went to the Proper Brick Oven & Tap Room on Tuesday night for dinner.I had the Halibut special and tried some of my wife margherita pizza.I also had a beer on tap which was pretty good sorry do not remember the name.My daughter had a sour beer that was on tap and hat was really good.I think from now on I am into sours.The service was good and the waiter was extremely friendly and gave us great service.The fish was just ok noting special at all.I did try my wife Margherita pizza and it was totally delicious.I would go back again and definitely get a pizza.Overall i would recommend going to Proper for pizza and beer.The service was great and so was the pizza and beer.If in the area definitely worth a stop"}, {"review_id": "r3qw1jzN2S4J56KBUMnrhQ", "user_id": "OWAJHLaGTLJ0FSzenCrPwQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/9/2017", "text": "This place was seriously awesome. They have a rotating beer list which in my opinion is, well, the tops! Every time you go you'll see something different and that's awesome plus tons of local breweries. Which was great for us since it was our first time in Pittsburgh. We got the bacon candy...yes bacon candy. Do it. It's chewy but hard but sweet but salty. It's perfect. Followed by the Bianca pizza. Which had burrata cheese and like three other cheeses on it. It was amazing. The crust was chewy but crunch so perfect. And to round it out we luckily had the best bartender ever Jason who was able to get us the cookie dough cheesecake even though it was past dessert hours. (After 9:45 they only do pizzas) and when I tell you you need to try this cheesecake, this life changing,gut changing, mind blowing, super delicious perfect combination cheesecake I'm not exaggerating. It was soooooo good, yes six o's good. Honestly the nicest part of our visit was Jason. He was such a nice human. He let me try a few beers before I picked one, he shared awesome pickles with us (which he said they make a cocktail out of the pickles juice..yes we will be back for that. A pickle juice cocktail, how could that be bad! That's right it can't be) and he was just genuinely a nice dude who is probably the main reason we need to come back. It's rare you get someone who's actually into talking to you and making sure you're doing well and enjoying everything. Really really great dude. You should defiantly stop by and tip him well! All in all great spot, with really good people and really good food. 10/10 would recommend."}, {"review_id": "tjN7V0vZBtPUUKkLk4X5uQ", "user_id": "_hsruQCw6UTnjlQiuSpScg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "Came here after a show at the Benedum Center.  We got 2 pizzas and some drinks.  The pizzas weren't too bad but nothing special."}, {"review_id": "UepsxSR2EsQAQMFGRhUTLQ", "user_id": "yesQ8YQi6ZZy7qnUY1FeaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/24/2017", "text": "This was a great combination of a good beer selection and very tasty food.

Anyway, our group got a mix of the house salad and their chicken and dumpling soup.  Both were thoroughly enjoyed.  We then split 3 pizzas1.the black and gold pizza - potatoes and red onion.  I think this was my favorite, but they were all very good2. The Bianca - a bunch of different cheeses - also very good3. The Greco (New) - which had braised lamb.  This was probably the table favorite.  The lamb was such a unique addition to pizza.  They also have a great alcohol selection and the staff was excellent.
