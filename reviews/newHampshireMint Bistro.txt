They recently tweaked their menu so everything is on one double sided menu...much nicer than wrestling with two menus at a small table. The sushi is always fresh with decent portions...I crave it on the weekends! The short rib nachos are soooo good! And the Khaleesi cocktail was on point."}, {"review_id": "DQjn3N98rGT-SXEwoHzsGQ", "user_id": "lyIwECTGiPb2SNrryJFPmg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "We went there as a group of 7 and had some good appetizers and great meals. It's a pretty plain looking place from the outside but very nice inside and had great service. They had many different beers on tap and so I tried a couple local ones and they came out nicely.

We decided to get the most bang for our buck and enjoy the happy hour drink and apps specials.  We ordered our usual apps, consisting of fish tacos and Asian nachos.  Sadly, the fish tacos were warm and the portion was VERY small, compared to what we usually are served. I can honestly say if I wasn't starving, I probably wouldn't of eaten it.  The fish was just ok, and the myriad of flavors that are usually there, wasn't.  As far as the nachos, I will say that the wontons they use were crisp, light and not greasy.  However, the pulled pork and the fixings seemed to be just on top instead of mixed into the layers of wontons. It seemed to me the rule is with the 4pm-6pm,, buy one app, get one half price, also means you get half the portion and ingredients. Needless to say, we opted to eat dinner elsewhere.Unfortunately, I have found the Mint Bistro to be either fantastic or just \"OK.\"  Yesterday, the food was just OK and it will be several months or more before we go back.Lastly, I wish The Mint Bistro would change up the menu. They have had the same \"Main\" dishes forever and I feel they need to get more in touch with the \"food trends\" in the area. Also, I wish they would switch up the soundtrack and what they have on the TV.  No one wants to see talk shows when trying to have a nice meal."}, {"review_id": "y6_2q40Bb4OJNqT8OnL7GQ", "user_id": "2K8-gg5_k7OdeKbYA_KNcA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "One of my favorite spots in Manchester.

Devil's Breath roll might be my favorite maki ever. All other rolls I've had here (Alaskan, eel, spicy tuna, etc.) have been excellent as well. Sushi boat for 2 was good except my personal preference is more variety in sushi/sashimi - all sushi/sashimi on the boat was based on three fish meats only (salmon, tuna &a yellowtail). The sweet dinner rolls before meal are delicious. Service has been genuinely perfect each time I visited - it's actually quite impressive. Some outdoor dining area, which doesn't seem too popular? Cons: it's definitely on the pricier end. Really difficult to get tables on weekends. If you don't call ahead... good luck getting a table for a big party for your Saturday dinner plan. Also they don't serve lunch and therefore don't open until 4 pm aka can't make a reservation on the same day until right before dinner time. Tables are set up pretty closely. Gets a little loud so might not be the best place for a large group anyways."}, {"review_id": "vVlf2qakhZ8z_0usgLuA0A", "user_id": "gGwBpp8X3z_WKkmS9zz5gg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "If you are looking to try amazing fresh sushi and delicious cocktails- this is the place!

It has a great dining & bar atmosphere especially with the sushi bar. I started off with a sake martini w/fresh ginger garnish..awesome! My wife was sipping on some J Lohr Chardonnay @ $5/glass...great deal. She then went on to Earthquake Cabernet @$13.50/glass. They do a very good wine pour!We did appetizers only: Poke Tuna & Fire Roasted Eggplant Cakes. We love the poke tuna but eggplant cakes were similar to crab cakes in texture & seemed like it had too much bread crumbs, would have been better using whole eggplant sliced or chunked rather put thru a food processor.They have an very good sushi selection & the seaweed salad goes well with any sushi selection you would make. Overall, a great place for dinner or just as an after work place for drinks & apps.

It's a quaint place, with a relaxing ambiance. The main menu is American traditional, but they also have a whole sushi/sashimi menu. Our server was Kevin and was awesome! My Mom is a picky person and she enjoyed everything she ate. Kevin was on top of water refills, drinks and making sure always had everything we needed and were enjoying our food.We started with the crab cake, french onion soup and fresh rolls. Fresh rolls weren't wrapped tightly, but they tasted delicious, just a little messy. Crab cake was giant with some corn and avocado within the the dish. Tasty! Seasoning was a little different, but not horrible. French onion soup was sweeter than I normally like, but add a little salt and it's good to go. Packed with onions and cheese.For dinner my Mom had the filet mignon, I had the risotto and added short ribs for $10, and my fiancée enjoyed a giant Delmonico steak. The asparagus on the filet was of the thin variety, but cooked to al dente and not overdone. Still had a nice crunch. Mom said the filet was tender and perfect. My risotto was wonderful. Their is a fair amount of pesto that's tossed in the risotto so that is the main flavor you get. The short rib was DELICIOUS. It melts in your mouth and shreds with just a fork. The au jus was also wonderful as it was not sweet and paired with the risotto nicely. Hubby said his steak was great. I tried a bite and was quite fond of the seasoning.For dessert I had cappuccino and my Mom had Jasmine tea and crème brûlée. I know cappuccino is universal in most places, but this one was delicious! Perfect layering and temperature. Tea comes in a huge, porcelain tea pot with enough for 3-4 cups.The crème brûlée was presented beautifully and the taste was outstanding. The dish comes in a homemade almond crust bowl. The bowl itself is a dessert and tasted great on its own! I'm not a huge crème brûlée fan, but this one won me over. Rich, but creamy and not over torched.If you're in the area check out Mint! All the recipes are homemade, prices reflect the fresh product and work that goes into each dish. Presentation is beautiful. Owner was walking around the whole night. You can tell he has a passion for his restaurant and employees. All they need is a bigger space!"}, {"review_id": "cxquAhl8lO77q2XGI0Tr1w", "user_id": "vBbqzqwH2Pt78YNUc4_DkA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/29/2017", "text": "Easily one of the best spots on Elm Street.

She was super attentive and friendly and gave great recommendations. I had the raspberry lemon cocktail. It was both delicious and potent. We shared the Maine lobster rangoons and Asian short rib nachos to start. The rangoons were awesome, but the nachos were too fried and greasy for me. We also shared 3 different sushi rolls: the Red Sox, Devil's Breath and Snow Mountain. All three were fantastic.

We are huge sushi fans and got a bunch of rolls to start off.  Elm Street Maki, Red sox Maki and the Monarchs Maki all out of this world!!!! Appetizer gnocchi with braised bacon and the sweet and spicy Pork Belly again a home run.We had a little more room so the Risotto Verdure with braised short rib was the call!! AMAZING!! This is one of the best restaurants in town.  You should absolutely go here and make sure you bring an appetite because everything is good.I can't leave out our awesome server Rita!! She was so nice and didn't have to look for her for more drinks. One of my biggest pet peeves!!! Drink menu, wine and beer selection again exceptional.  I had to ask for the owner this time and Tim came right over to greet us and introduce himself.  Really nice guy.

When I ordered my next drink, she knew I didn't like the stemware glasses from the previous martini I ordered, so she made sure my next drink came in a low-ball glass.  Cassey moved the service from a 3 to a 5 star on the service side of things.  Overall it was a good experience from food to service.  Would recommend and would come back (thanks Cassey)"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mint-bistro-manchester-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
