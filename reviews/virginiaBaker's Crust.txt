We made it in for happy hour to grab some apps after a girls outing around town. I didn't care for the alcohol happy hour specials so I ended up getting a regular priced drink, the blood orange-mosa! I wasn't sure if I'd like it but I loved it! If you don't like tasting your alcohol in drinks you'll love this one. The calamari wasn't my favorite as they don't give an even portion of calamari rings to tentacles. Was more tentacles than rings and not as crunchy as they would seem given all the breading on them.The tavern chips I really liked! Never ordered them before but I will now. Also a friend introduced me to the \"Weeg Sauce\". Chipotle with brown sugar... sounds iffy but so good!The caprese bruschetta were also delicious! I loved the roasted tomatoes and the softness yet crunchy bread."}, {"review_id": "2h2wH7sPoocxE0JtlLH76A", "user_id": "0jk8ucP_Y4-KDg3paA42lA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "I have to say that I really love the vibe this restaurant gives off! It almost feels like a fancy Panera: not too fancy where I feel weird in casual clothes and not too casual where I feel like I'm eating fast food haha. This is located in the heart of Greenbrier and all the little shopping centers by the mall. Parking is a breeze and there are plenty of stores near by, so this would be a great lunch date spot to catch up with friends!!I wish I remembered our server's name but she was really great! Shout out to you brunette girl with the great make up, I hope people tip you well all the time :) When we let her know that it was our first time here, one of the chefs came out to give us a complimentary sample of some items on their menu! It was super nice of them and it didn't make me feel like a i was eating at just another chain restaurant. I ordered shrimp tacos that came with a thai sweet and sour sauce. There was a generous portion of fried battered shrimp in each taco, but I could have done away with the sauce. It wasn't really for me. It came with a grilled corn on the cob.This place has a huge menu so I would love to come back (especially for brunch) and check out what else they have to offer!"}, {"review_id": "T2lUblnaTOF0el1F3dM2JQ", "user_id": "UzORoQ_fU_IOneGWx_wpVw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Bakers Crust has a gluten free menu for people with food sensitivities.

It wasn't until I spoke with the catering manager at a yelp elite event that she educated me on what they are about. Yes, they are a chain but they are a local chain that started as a simple bakery in Virginia Beach ( where one of their owners was French). They source everything local, from the  greens in their salads to the meat in their burgers and I found that to be impressive since they aren't very expensive. I had the pleasure of trying a lot of their menu items at a young adult networking event where the owner himself attended. Despite him being  there he did not hold back on giving his own restaurant constructive criticism, like if  the fries weren't perfectly cooked. He told me that his favorite menu item was the Tuna Burger, so of course I got that. It was Sashimi tuna tossed in poke sauce with avocado, pickled onions, sesame aïoli and sriracha mayo.The meat was flaky tender and not dry at all, and the aioli that came with it was cream and spicy enough that it didn't overpower the flavors of the meat itself. We received a few off the menu apps that are actually Hors Doeuvres from their catering menu. Including an avocado toast bruschetta topped with bacon and a sunny side up egg and Tuna Poke Wonton Cracker with seaweed salad, tuna, mango, avocado and rainbow microgreens.I appreciate their dedication to providing good tasting and high quality food in a manner that isn't pretentious and doesn't cost an arm and a leg. I would consider this to be in the top 10 places I would always eat and recommend to others."}, {"review_id": "FiHIW-GNtKzyBEid1EqeWA", "user_id": "sqxx1GRQxBgKHAb5KpfQ8A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "I keep seeing this place every time we go to Target and had to try it. The food was mediocre. The presentation was gorgeous but the taste of everything seems so bland tasting. I had to keep putting pepper and salt for taste. I don't normally do that but I wanted to give this place a try and see what was on the menu. I may go back one more time to try something different. But so far, the food was okay.

I am completely impressed and will be coming back. The GM Jeff brought us out samples of their tomatoe and cheese soup and fresh made house parm chips. He was very friendly and approachable. Our server Adam was simply delightful, his knowledge of the menu and it's ingredients is extensive and was happy to answer all of our question. My husband was so impressed with the soup that he got the soup and sandwhich combo with the mozzarella tomatoe panini. He said it was the best he's had and would order again. I got the baker club and Frisco turkey Cobb, the salad portion was huge and it was amazing. We were stuffed but Adam recommended even we choose to dine elsewhere to stop back by for a cappuccino and desert crepes , we will have to take that suggestion I'm sure.

There were 8 of us and they almost couldn't sit us down b/c someone else reserved a spot for 8 (even though we were first in the door). Mental note - if you're coming with more than typical size party - always check to see if they take reservations. On that note, they did get us in (thankfully). Sat down and everything was as expected from Baker's Crust good food and service at a good location. My only 'iffy' with the food was the hash browns (cubes) had a very weird taste to them. It makes me think there was bad oil or something. It just wasn't normal. If it wasn't for that small bit, I'd have given this a full 5 stars.Outside of the small blip in the food, the facility is very classy and the service seemed very friendly to work with.

And Kat our waitress was BOMB. We told her it was our first time there and she mentioned it to the GM. He came out a few moments later with complimentary samples of their in house made mushroom soupand homemade potato chips. That soup was very good and had a creamy base, my grandmother loved the chips. I ordered the Calamari of course for starters and also a side Caesar Salad. Both were scrumptious and the Calamari came out pipping hot. For my meal I ordered the Chipotle Gouda Turkey Burger with fresh cut fries and it was awesome. My mom and grandmother both got the pick two where they got a Caesar Salad and a half of a roasted chicken sandwich on fresh French baguette. My mother enjoyed her food and my grandmother eventually enjoyed hers as well.My grandmother actually had originally picked wheat bread for her sandwich but it came out toasted pretty hard. Kat had no problem getting her another sandwich made on the original bread it came on and the GM, John happily brought it out to the table. They also took care of my grandmothers meal due the hiccup. Now that's 5 star service, Great Work Guys!!!"}, {"review_id": "7iLksD4KvrSaD4183_0ysA", "user_id": "WpXU7AH7i08zd57gImQsJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "The Greenbrier location is one of my go-to lunch stops if working in Chesapeake. I almost always sit at the bar as this store regularly has a wait at lunch. The food is fresh and I have always witnessed the staff moving quickly and working fast. They usually have one or two stand-out beers on tap, to compliment some standards. Lyndsey is the normal daytime bartender and she is knowledgeable and attentive. I have had several of the sandwiches and have been a fan of each, along with the burgers. I usually get these with the house made garlic potato chips. I could probably eat two pounds of these (as a retired Marine, I do PT every morning, so don't necessarily do this) and believe they are prepared just right.They also have a small bakery and pizza oven right across from the bar and you can watch some of this activity while at the bar or at a high top.

FYI My gps was off on the location, it is in the Greenbrier/Volvo shopping center.. in front of Barnes and nobles and in the vicinity of Stein Mart, Harris Teeter,Target. Was invited here by my group of friends, for a special appreciation Breakfast. Great place for group gatherings. We all fit on our table of 10.It has a sophisticated but still casual ambience, great for business meetings, or dates. I'd had dinner at bakers crust but @ the Richmond location, and I really enjoyed it. Great thing about this place is that they serve Breakfast. Many people compare it to Panera, but they have more options, not just bread, soup and salad. I feel that they put a little more pizzazz into their food but this place can be a bit pricey for some people.Breakfast menu had a great selection of Belgian waffles, eggs Benedict, omelettes, to lighter options like yogurt and fruit. There were many options to choose from. I had to go with the \"swanky\" fried chicken with poached egg, leafy greens and hollandaise sauce (egg's Benedict). I'm a lover for the Benedict and I enjoyed that it was on a sweet potato biscuit rather than the usual egg muffin. It came with a side of fried potatoes to compliment the dish. It was a huge meal for me because it came with two eggs Benedict's I had to box up one to bring home. I'd say for 12 dollars it was well worth it. Especially since it was a business treat out for me and I wasn't paying for it. But would I pay the price to eat here all the time... usually not. I would perhaps have a date breakfast or dinner here or meetings here. We did have a short meeting here and for the time we were here the waitress was always making sure we were fine and refilled my coffee numerous times. She really busted her butt with making sure we were totally satisfied. Serving a group of 10 for 2 hours in a restaurant requires a lot of patience. I really loved that the executive chef came out to make sure we enjoyed our food and to ask us about our experience. I felt that they really appreciated our business there and were very friendly and professional.Overall I'd come back again another time."}, {"review_id": "5DfaX2z3n24mTYMCKyDITA", "user_id": "t1RG_ACD_HLM7Y5S0l9D_g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "Nice location and good service even on a jam packed dinner evening.
