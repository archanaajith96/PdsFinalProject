A group of us went for lunch and enjoyed crisp lumpia (mild sausage spring rolls with tangy sauce) as an appetizer. Our favorite sides were the collard greens and onion rings. As far as entrees, my colleague enjoyed her brisket sandwich. But the show stealer for a few of us was a \"little\" sandwich endearingly called the \"Hog Trough.\"  To best explain this towering, please-call-Guy-Fieri food extravaganza, I will start at the top:Grilled cheese sandwich over cole slaw over pulled pork over beef brisket over smoked kielbasa over a half-pound cheeseburger patty over a second grilled cheese sandwich. Served with your choice of side dish. Yes, for $12.95, you can feed a family of four--or eat it all at once and not have to eat for two days! Seriously, we loved these sandwiches and broke into applause when a server brought them out, two at a time, balanced like three-tiered wedding cakes.Go to to Tasty Bones. Share some Lumpia. Take a \"cheat day\" and try to leave room for dessert!"}, {"review_id": "MZf8HBSsG-lzYV3v68lo5g", "user_id": "dad_ISKIMfvlii82rweW6A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "The staff gets 5 stars for their friendliest and helpfulness, But the portion sizes were small for the price you pay, Especially the dinuguan, which was small portion size and really thick.  Chef needs to lay off the black pepper a little bit, almost every entree we ordered all you could taste was the black pepper.    Was hoping to find a regular spot to stop when we pass through Cheyenne, but were disappointed."}, {"review_id": "ptuHblxykewH9eZ5tnHc-g", "user_id": "JMKG9oOyQHh9015P4Z-79Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "Fabulous barbeque in Cheyenne. We stumbled onto this gem on a side street and entered a world of tangy smoky deliciousness. The brisket had a few fatty areas but the flavor and the texture of the meat were on point. Tasty sauces.

Staff are always friendly and the owners are great. The BBQ is excellent and definitely able to keep with what is found in those BBQ country places. The Filipino specialties are also fantastic and well worth a try, although they definitely don't help those folks trying to watch their waist line.  It is in the back of an old hotel downtown, but don't let the looks deceive you,  Tasty Bones is the real deal."}, {"review_id": "wgs9WtamBn9CDdsi1zl3pg", "user_id": "xGvmF9OSTkNUk9EVrTHxew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I love this place coz its like east meet west, get my filipino food fix intown instead of d4iving all the way to aurora colorado.

I'm not seeing the entrees I got on the provided menus, however. The first time we went in, I got a dish that was more Filipino-inspired. Pork back fat and rice. It was good, but it was heavy. About halfway through, I was ready to box the rest up and take a long nap.  It's not going to hit the spot if you crave BBQ, so consider that before ordering. The second visit, the waitress suggested a sandwich called the \"Hog Trough.\"  I'm not going to balk at her insinuation that a big guy like me would be at home eating something like the Hog Trough.  She went with her gut, and I went in full bore on her suggestion.  It was amazing.  Three kinds of meat stacked on a burger and sandwiched between two grilled cheese sandwiches.  It's a ridiculous sandwich for sure.  And folks, I've always thought people who order burgers at BBQ joints were nuts, but this has to be one of the best burgers you're going to get outside of a major metropolis where the options are endless.  This thing will most definitely satisfy your appetite for a good burger and for BBQ.  You'll likely have to box it up and take it home.They have a large selection of sides.  Perhaps their best offerings are the parmesan garlic fries.  The mac-and-cheese isn't too bad either.In all, I can't say it's the best BBQ I've ever had, but I wouldn't cry myself to sleep if I were told that it's the only BBQ I'd ever get to eat.  The staff is friendly, the food is good.  What more does a town like Cheyenne need?"}, {"review_id": "KG0djgt45w9FnJ3gRc6BaQ", "user_id": "aMtEYdxluXpCz3gvU8NYwg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/11/2018", "text": "This was one of my first selections in town.
