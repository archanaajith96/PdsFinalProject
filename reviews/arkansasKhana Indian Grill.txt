So I thought I want to try the Khana Indian Grill. It was my first time trying it and now it wont be my last. Amazing!! The flavors was so good especially if you like spicey!!!  I had the Papdi Chaat which is like a salad with fried wafers topped with fresh potato, chickpeas, cucumber, radish, chopped green chilies, mint yogurt, tamarind and cilantro chutneys . It was so good and everything was fresh and I loved the crunch!!!I tried their dessert Kheer. It was good too!! It was Indian rice pudding, flavored with cardamom and bergamot. Topped with toasted coconut and almonds. It was different but I loved it!! Loved the coconut!!They have alot to offer and definetly give them a try!! I will be back"}, {"review_id": "Trca5qtKjICBj8qlYfHDFg", "user_id": "fuslIq-ZJCd-qornjEokUg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "This was my first visit to Khana Indian Grill and it was definitely a good one. When you first walk in you are directed to the counter where you place your order. It's not an extensive menu but it had enough variety to meet your Indian food craving. Once you place your order you are given an # and then you pick your table. We went at lunch and the food came really quickly. I imagine, since it's a smaller menu, they have pots of food ready to go. No complaints though, everything was very hot and fresh. Food: Sambar SoupChicken Tikka MasalaChicken Coconut Malai"}, {"review_id": "5d_fNSqbR65GV3GYtKq6NA", "user_id": "CDfyF1bA-H98xdaMgNwWzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "Great ambience, good portion size for dishe, Indian dishes re-imagined w/o too much spice and finally very clean restrooms... Good Samosas, Malai and Panneer Tikka Curries, Chat, Katti Rolls and excellent Cutting Chai. Naan quality is the only thing that can be improved: it has to be soft and fluffy if done right. I have tried out many Indian restaurants in different cities of USA.

Considering how many times we have gone there, it's criminal I waited for this long. We love this place. Makes it worth driving from Bentonville to Fayetteville. Their khati rolls are fantastic and their cutting chai brings back so many memories from back home. And if you want a unique cocktail, you have to try the fireball chai.

First of all, the inside of the restaurant is clean, decorated nicely, and well kept. The tables are spaced out and there are huge glass windows, which allow you to look out onto college Ave. They have some awesome local beer selections, which I truly appreciate. They also offer a variety of Indian American fusion cocktails, which is a cool perk of an Indian restaurant. We ordered the super Indian meal, option 2. The cutting chai teas were probably the best part of the meal, second to the Kheer. The samosas were very average and lukewarm. The chicken tikka masala was very disappointing for someone who eats Indian food frequently. It even had a sour taste to it. The naan also makes me feel sad. The menu is limited and does not include any of the usual items that you would expect to find at a great Indian restaurant. I would recommend making the drive to Rogers and visiting chennai cafe for more flavor and variety."}, {"review_id": "WsoLsEEaK7ft-KpD06TGkg", "user_id": "4pU-kZLQK87gVpnFgA0vdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Khana has an all-around good thing going.

They mark their gluten free and vegetarian options. Their food generally has a spicy kick to it. The lighting is absolutely gorgeous. Even though it's a casual restaurant, the hanging lamps give it a dressed up feel. They change colors - expect red on football weekends! Khana is very very clean and the service is always friendly and polite. During busy times, parking might be limited, but I've always been able to find a spot. You can dine in or carry out. Their carry out service has been quick every time I used it. If you're a newbie to Indian food, try one of their samplers, a cutting chai, and their rice pudding dessert"}, {"review_id": "y8NUzVPrRcff1x_X62_K1g", "user_id": "cxb8722xKDGzCEC0z6L0_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Lightened up Indian food.

I had the combo plate #2 with chicken tikka masala and chicken coconut malai. Both items tasted amazing and they had the right amount of spice.  The atmosphere is great they have a friendly staff that is willing to answer any questions you have. The bathrooms are nice and clean. They also have this kick a** little pond thing that have flower petals floating on top of the surface.

After my first visit I was so intrigued by this restaurants food, display of culture and how they spice their dishes--I knew I wouldn't be able to stay away for long.After speaking with the friendly and very helpful Owner we were guided through the ordering...Their portions are HUGE--so start slow, remember the spices are pungent but so well done. We ordered the Paneer Masala and the Turmeric Curry. An order of Samosas and a Paapdi Chaat (My fave dish)..is a Salad of fried wafers and topped with fresh potato. The Chaat here is the best Indian food I've ever experienced. The Coconut Curry is stupendous--but if a novice I'd  suggest beginning with a Curry or the Paneer Masala-it is incredible, the flavors are so varied...it's just fantastic.

They have colorful patterned lighting and some Indian things arranged in different places. We ordered at the counter and the food was delivered to our tables. We had samosas, paneer tikka masala and nimbu pani. Samosas were fresh and nimbu pani tasted very good! Paneer tikka masala came with fresh butter naan and basmati rice. The only suggestion is not to serve the paneer tikka masala poured over the rice. Everything was served in leaf plates which gave an Indian touch.The owner is from India and his wife is from Texas. They were very nice and they shared their stories from India..Great food and great people.

I would recommend this place as a good Indian restaurant that is not just another assortment of curry dishes but rather a good combination and variety.  It is also not too hard on the budget but yet giving you good quality Indian food with good service.  Doesn't get much better than that folks."}, {"review_id": "7CvMivetalIjaBXdbCcitw", "user_id": "hEmnh5y-_nTwdidamvylVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2016", "text": "I ate here last week with a friend and was very impressed. I had heard good things about Khana Indian Grill before and it was spot on!PARKING:They have a decent size parking lot that wraps around the restaurant.CUSTOMER SERVICE:Great customer service. The employees that helped us were very helpful and friendly. The food also came out relatively quick, but not too quick... you don't want it to be too quick because then it would be like mcdonalds and this place is definitely not that!FOOD:Awesome food!! Great authentic Indian food. One of the owners is from India and sure delivers tasty food!My friend and I shared the Papdi Chaat: fried wafers with fresh potato, chickpeas, cucumber, radish, chopped green chilies, mint yogurt, tamarind & cilantro chutneys. It was delicious!I ordered the Thaali Combo: Chickpea chole, turmeric potato, yogurt raita, pappadum with chicken Tikka Masala with rice and naan. It was yummy as well. I highly recommend both of these dishes. AMBIANCE/DECOR:I really liked the ambiance inside. It is a fast casual restaurant (you order at register and then they bring it out to you), but has a more upscale feel. They have colorful lanterns hanging from above all over the ceiling and it really adds some authentic, yet modern feel. The tables are super high quality wood. The overall feel is awesome."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/khana-indian-grill-fayetteville?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
