Muffins, eggs, fruit, OJ, blah. Oh no, I need me some varieTAY, thus falsely considering myself more of a lunch or dinner type of girl... until now. I have seen the light. First stop in San Diego, I wanted to treat myself to what the locals and travelers enjoy alike. After a quick search, Great Maple popped up and off I went. I came on a weekend so obviously this place was PACKED! Thankfully I was able to be seated right away at the bar. I quietly tucked myself in and glanced over the menu. My order:Johnny's Lolliwaffles - Waffles on stick are a street food novelty, like say a corn dog or a BBQ'd skewer, but as a breakfast item, it actually works out quite perfectly. I can totally picture a busy Financial District guy dashing to work early morning with his handy dandy waffle stick in hand. Who has time for plates anyway? These Johnny Lolliwaffles are made to order. The outer breading was slightly crisp and the inner portion was soft and moist. Delicious. 4 dipping sauces accompanied the waffle sticks: lemon, whipped cream, raspberry, and caramel; all of which weren't overly sweet.Maple Bacon Donuts - Salty, sweet, bready, soft, and lightly fried. These warm doughy donuts are brilliantly prepared. It's best to eat these babies right when they are served as the maple glaze may harden a bit. And when I say generous, I mean GENEROUS amounts of bacon were sprinkled on top and then lightly dusted with powder sugar. Every bite was an absolute joy to eat. Three donuts come per order and are pretty huge. Perfect for sharing. Grilled Chicken and Eggs - I love a good sunny side up, especially when not overcooked. They executed the eggs perfectly, although the grilled chicken breast did come out slightly dry. This protein style dish was served with sliced tomato, avocado, salsa verde, and fresh fruit. I also added pork sausage which came out flavorful and juicy.Grapefruit Juice - Not freshly squeezed, but still the closest you can get being that it was produced by reputable juice company Evolution. They also have a full bar for those who enjoy morning cocktails. I thought this place was really great. A concise vision of bringing traditional American breakfast food fare to a more modern and lively take. Service was quick and very accommodating. A well oiled machine. Thanks Great Maple for ridding my disdain for breakfast!"}, {"review_id": "WRJcgnH4G01AMoijkNKSFA", "user_id": "gHdelySt8vkoQ6PcnL412A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Tried this place for the first time Sunday for brunch around 11am. The wait was 45min for 3 people and parking is extremely difficult during that time as the farmers market is happening nearby. While waiting they provide water and coffee. The service was prompt and courteous and I ordered the beef brisket. It was pretty good and enough for 2 people. In general the prices were a little on the expensive side compared to great brunch places such as BR, Mission, Swami's etc. I would not say the quality of the food or portions justify it. Overall, great food but overpriced."}, {"review_id": "8Yn_cjcuyR6PIE36QUvD0Q", "user_id": "ST_fMmqzp4LIPnHIvwArWQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Despite all the great reviews on yelp, my family and I did not have a pleasant experience.First off, good luck finding parking! Spaces are very limited, but luckily, we found one right in front. We came on Easter and it was extra packed. During peak hours, the wait is very long. It took us about an hour to be seated. Worth the wait? NAH. We got seated outdoors in the sun, so we asked if we could get moved to an empty table in the shade. The hostess moved us to the table we requested. However, it was dirty and wasn't clean. She told us she would get someone to clean it and set it up. About 10 minutes later, no one came. We had to flag someone down to get it done! The girl who took our order made us feel very uncomfortable. My family of 4 wanted to order only 3 entrees, because the portions seemed huge and we didn't want to take leftovers home. The server kept insisting we order more and made it feel like we were obligated to order ONE entree + ONE drink per person. That's up to US to order, not you lol House Smoked Beef Brisket ($18) - An English popover with poached eggs, fresh hollandaise cream, served with herbed pee wee potatoes and fresh fruit garnish. The one I got had slow smoked beef brisket, with grilled asparagus, fresh tomato, and smoked bacon. This is one of their most popular english popovers! HUGE PORTIONS. Presentation looks really nice, but I thought this was pretty average. It was great, but still mediocre. House Smoked Beef Brisket Hash ($19) House smoked beef brisket, with potatoes, bacon, kale, cherry tomatoes, red pepper, hollandaise, poached eggs, and a grilled beard. Once again, very nice presentation with a big portion. This hash combo tasted good, but there was nothing unique about it. Great Maple BLT ($15) - Smoked bacon sandwich, with lettuce, tomato, mayo, and fresh avocado ($2). It also comes with fries on the side. You can't really go wrong with a BLT sandwich. My sister enjoyed it a lot and she would recommend this. Customer service was poor. During our dine in experience, the sever only checked up on us once. No one came by and asked if we needed anything after that. We had to flag down the servers so many times to get our to go boxes and check. Our server counted the tip in front of us and responded with a \"WOW. Did I do something wrong?!\" Which I found EXTREMELY RUDE. First off, you should NEVER count the tip in FRONT of the costumer. Second, why would we tip well for bad service? Overall, we did not have a good experience here. Definitely not coming back! Originally was going to give this place a 3.5 because of the presentation and portion of the food. But after that type of costumer service, this place deserves a 2."}, {"review_id": "3qmFYFX93Bw9gzwdGXvXfg", "user_id": "fRJpK_b0rrjpBgRZjvfvgA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Wow. What an amazing place Great Maple is. I read all the great reviews. So I needed to stop by Great Maple for a try. When you walk in your are greeted with a nice welcome. I met a client here for breakfast. Right away we where seated.After being seated your drink order was taken. I saw a table next to us eating the French toast. So I asked how was it. The lady the best. I ordered the French toast. Also the beef brisket with eggs. About 15 minutes later then food arrived.After one bite into the French toast I was speechless. The best French toast I had in town. You be the judge. The beef brisket with eggs was so good. I never had beef brisket with eggs before. The brisket was very tender. For a person who enjoys corn beef and eggs. I have to admit the brisket and eggs is much better combination.  The customer service deserves 10 stars. From the minute you seat down to the minute you stand up you get the best customer possible. I look forward to coming back to Great Maple. Hats off to the owner and management for a great staff."}, {"review_id": "SFPkLdoDsheX_WNZq6u_4Q", "user_id": "yjNiZDQgWmwaSDgDm_uEag", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/1/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I had heard so much about this place that I had to go see for myself .....Truth is those doughnuts are as good as everyone says but except from that , food is average and a bit on the expensive side for the portion you get.

After reading numerous reviews, all said to come early or make a reservation beforehand so we did. I'm not sure if we came on a slow weekday (during Spring Break) or if we came prepared with a reservation, but we got seated immediately. *two thumbs up*We knew that the portions here are huge, so my sister and I decided on ordering an entree to share and the maple bacon donuts with two cups of coffee.The coffee came out first and it's soooo thick, more like espresso rather than a dark roast coffee. I usually love dark roast coffee but I didn't need a second cup that day.The maple bacon donuts were really good, but the donuts itself were really dense and not like fluffy cake donuts that I was expecting. The maple sugar glaze was a little much since they pile the sugar on top. I would have preferred they candied the bacon in the maple sugar rather than just throw it on the top.I ordered the smoked brisket popover (which I still don't know what the popover part is). The meat was tender and nice, but I'm from Texas so smoked brisket is only made well in Texas. The fingerling potatoes were also ok... they also served this with a side of bread which made this dish, and meal, super carb heavy.Not sure if this place was worth the hype but it was a decent breakfast."}, {"review_id": "T3txiTrUQuQuh62ijghIhA", "user_id": "tA1U-XSh9woo73eQmWGyAQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "COMEDY:My discovering this place has a bit of a comedic tale attached to it. 2 days ago I went to Torrance California to shop at the Del Amo Fashion Center. While on the way I thought to myself I would really like to get some breakfast but, being that it was over to you about 11 I was kind of thinking more towards a lunch item. Well when I pulled into the mall I know it's a place called great maple. It conjured thoughts of maple syrup, perhaps Canadian bacon... And then I thought to myself I bet this is in your restaurant. I bet it's some fancy hipster clothing line from Canada or at least the Canadian inspired clothing store. And I ended up eating at a place called Lucille's, where I had a great barbecue lunch.FEEDING TIME; Fast forward a day... And I'm in the San Diego area and I see another Great Maple listed after I did a search for waffles. So I looked at the menu and so liked what I read. They had a turkey bolognese, so I felt I was all set. I don't want to get too technical about what else was ordered at my table, my other half may want to write her own review. Anyway, she ordered a turkey burger with brie and a side salad. For appetizers we had the popovpers and  a bruscetta that was more of a build your own from the ingredients left on your plate.OUR APPETIZERS:Felt the popovers were wonderful. The bruschetta I could have did without. I just don't like the flavor of the cheese combined with an onion marmalade and then the flavor of figs.OUR MAIN COURSE:My pasta was amazing. I tried a sample of just the meat from the turkey burger I did not like the flavoring at all.WATER:When we were first were seated and water was brought out to the table, we noticed that it came a clear bottle fit wirmth an articulatinga stopper a top it. I came to learn that it wasn't anything fancy from Europe. Instead it was just playing San Diego tap water, which are waitress called San Diego's finest.COURTNEY:Speaking of our waitress, our wonderful service was provided by young lady named Courtney. I'd like to state for the record that I was very pleased with how Courtney conducted herself when tending to our table. Her knowledge extended past the menu and her outgoing , friendly demeanor was a true asset that PARKING: The  on property parking lot is not huge but we are fortunate enough to find a spot. Other than that on the street parking is your other choice."}, {"review_id": "itLdrK3zgLiVYXCCoGBOsg", "user_id": "YoaQY0EZmhYCgTLtz5sd2w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "We arrived a few mins before our 10:30am reservation this morning.

There's a pretty big gap between 3 and 4 star reviews in my book. Great Maple deserves 3.5 stars.Breakdown Format:Style: I love forward thinking spots like Great Maple. A foodie's haven. A unique variety of offerings. Some trendy, others borderline genius blends of flavors. The aesthetic and staff also had this hip vibe to them. 4 stars for this aspect.Service: It's obvious this is a popular spot when there's a wait at 11:30am on a Thursday. That's great and terrible. I had to ask about being put on the wait list after seeing the manager(?) 3 times up at the host podium. The counters took a while to get cleaned up from the previous guest's visit. This wasn't just my wait, but 2 other adjacent parties. I also waited a good amount of time to place my order and get my check. Ironically, my food came out exceptionally fast. Go figure. Mind you: There wasn't a single member of the house not hustling constantly. It just looks like their business exceeds their staffing. 3 stars here.Food: I ordered the House Smoked Brisket Hash - I decided on this entree before stepping into Great Maple. Gotta love Yelp! In concept, smoked brisket, thick cut bacon, rosemary fingerling potatoes, sauteed onions, 2 poached eggs, and a hollandaise sounds amazing. My take: This was an excellent concept dish. When you rush the prep, the delicate balance of flavors becomes single faceted. The bacon wasn't crisp, more so chewey and tasted like run of the mill uncured bacon (good uncured bacon is seasoned to make up for the nitrates). Brisket was somewhat dry. I'd have expected brisket that was \"smoke-finished\" for flavor. Brisket can be too lean for a drying process like smoking. The hollandaise wasn't anything special. More so creamy than flavorful. And the potatoes could have benefited from about twice the rosemary. You want the bright flavors to pull through every bite. Enough overlay to be complimentary, but each ingredient lending a unique characteristic. Too many of these flavors were muted.I'm being very tough on this review because I expect more from concepts like this one. It's a $20 breakfast item and all of the ingredients are great, just lacking that je ne sais quoi that makes it worth the price tag and a smiling foodie. 2.5 stars here."}, {"review_id": "NejHeywuu6ob4CO7An2YYQ", "user_id": "LmoYySdaAO7XBEajSAytGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "Life changing to be honest.

The wait is crazy long. I came by at 10 am during the week between Christmas and New Years. I assume that many tourists or locals who were off of work like me decided to try it out at the same time. I overheard that the wait was 45 minutes.  I got lucky since I was by myself, I snagged a seat at the bar immediately. The prices are a bit steep. For the two egg breakfast with an upgrade to English popover and a side of bacon, the cost was $18.40. Yikes!  The food was tasty. I enjoyed it very much. My elderflower mimosa was $13 but I will pay for a tasty cocktail.  I would lose my wallet if I became a regular here. The service could have been better but the place was slammed so I gave them a break for having so many customers to wait on. The biggest deterrents are the lack of parking and the wait. If you are not dining solo, make sure to bring your patience if you visit during peak breakfast hours. If you can, take a Lyft as parking is a challenge. I didn't mind parking five blocks away and walking to the restaurant. If you are by yourself, try to sit at the bar. Make a friend with the people seated next to you and you might get lucky like I did and they share their beignets with you. :) The couple on the other side of me offered me some of their maple donut. I should have said yes just the try them but I tried the beignet instead.

They're the perfect amount of sweet, the maple frosting is absolutely delicious, the donut is cakey yet light, and the bacon bits are the perfect compliment. A MUST try!This time I ordered their version of an \"eggs benedict\", the English popover- specifically the house smoked beef breakfast. And my boyfriend ordered the hardwood smoked bacon scramble melt. The popover was absolutely delicious! The brisket was so flavorful along with the bacon, avocado, and cherry tomatoes- a perfect benedict!The scramble melt was also delicious and was served with peewee potatoes and some toast.

Although they don't offer bottomless mimosas, they have a unique mimosa selection such as pineapple, white pear and lavender lemon. The daily mimosa special was mango, which was super fruity and delicious! I tried the Kentucky spirit, and it was a stiff drink, but definitely tasty. For breakfast, I ordered the brisket popover. Entrees are large portions, definitely shareable or expect leftovers.
