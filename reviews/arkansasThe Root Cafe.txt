The Root serves delicious food, with wonderful, crisp ingredients, and the customer service is always phenomenal.Favorites include; Omelette, Shiitake Benny, Shitake Burger, and anything with whatever they make their homemade dressing on it. It's delicious."}, {"review_id": "M3p1Dy5PeB_0uo0rrQseoQ", "user_id": "ImRojZ8BxLXCz6GWRQ7yEA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "My husband and I stopped here for lunch on our way back home to Dallas. He was looking for a burger and I found this place on Yelp. I saw that it was all locally sourced food, and the menu looked delicious. While I wasn't necessarily hungry, I figured it would be a good place to check out. Overall, the feel of this restaurant is cozy. We took our food to go, so unfortunately we couldn't enjoy the quaintness of the atmosphere, but it was adorable. The line to order was a little long, and the wait for our food was longer than we wanted, but it is totally worth it. The burger was amazing, one of the best we've had. The burger came with a side salad, and it was also fantastic. It's weird to have a salad with a burger, but they made it work. Another thing that really stood out to me was the reusable items. Mason jars instead of cups, cloth napkins instead of paper, glass bottles or aluminum cans instead of fountain beverages to go. Overall, it was a cute place with delicious food. One of a kind place that is worth the trip back."}, {"review_id": "6Ht5f6TtRIvQgLwHbtO93w", "user_id": "QLIA3SK_4PCan64Ao05JLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "This place may well be the epitome of modern Southern cuisine.  Most of the ingredients are locally sourced, prices are reasonable given the quality, and their dishes are clearly Southern in origin, but made in modern methods.  We stopped in for a Sunday brunch on the way to the airport out of town and were not disappointed.  We did have to wait about 20 minutes but it was worth the wait.The place is a bit cramped and you're forced to rub elbows with the table next to you, which created a bit of a problem for our neighbours as we had our 10 month old, his stroller and a high chair.  I ordered the tofu scramble, which was seasoned a bit too heavy with curry powder, but it still tasted rather good and it was refreshingly light compared to the junk we'd been eating during our visit to Little Rock.  My husband got a biscuit, egg and sausage sandwich which he loved, and we also got an order of biscuits and gravy to share.  The biscuits were pillowy, and the gravy was lighter, had more sausage and was less salty than most country gravies out there.  The total of $43.00 including tip was more than fair."}, {"review_id": "JpdSEDIl1v3Utrz735suKA", "user_id": "oJGXpQ9q-B8nv6tl_WjLGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "The BEST find on my road trip!!

They use local farmers for their products. They have several vegan options. Make sure to not go during peak times unless you want to wait. This place fills up quick. I would not take a large group there. Not a whole lot of seating. Located in SoMa. Nice up and coming area. They usually have vegan pancakes on Sunday.

We stepped up to the entry counter early in the morning to order a light breakfast before the day began. The biscuits were phenomenal! Nice and crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. They were perfect. The parfait was delicious too. My only qualm was the jar was really tiny and packed. They should size up the jar and leave a little room at the top four those who want to mix it a little bit. The pancake was light, fluffy, perfectly cooked. The last time I stopped in, I ordered the eggs bahn mi and they were well spiced and perfectly cooked. We appreciated that the coffee and tea were unlimited. It was busier during lunch but I didn't have a problem finding a table. Small parking lot with close street parking."}, {"review_id": "-zyoqhAk7jNAZhAVkonPPg", "user_id": "PZpincAXn8RRXA41pxrRAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "If you are a true foodie and enjoy local fresh organic, there is not a better restaurant in central Arkansas."}, {"review_id": "BJRpjPS-1R78L8GOcYu4MA", "user_id": "6NBJprU8lxCbiR8Y0wp-Vw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/1/2017", "text": "This is a great local restaurant in Little Rock.  I visited after seeing how positively the restaurant has been reviewed, and I'm so glad I did.  I had the cheeseburger, which was excellent.  It is clear that all of the ingredients are of the highest quality, and it was served with a lovely salad.  The sweet potato fries for were a highlight.  My friends enjoyed full size salad as well as a bratwurst, and they were all very pleased.  During lunch time, you order at the counter.  The food was delivered quickly, and there is a large selection of drinks (try the lemonade).The restaurant has a fantastic atmosphere, as does the surrounding area.  If you're in the area, be sure to check out some of the local stores."}, {"review_id": "KP77ERG9c8nWMKlvV6AuPQ", "user_id": "BBgh2-58CFQVfaBX2ionCQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Atmosphere is great!

I was looking for a good breakfast spot and was recommended I try the \"The Root Cafe\". It had over 300 reviews so I figured I would give it a try. The Inside is decorated very nice. It had a lot of local decoration. This is a local cafe. I ordered the biscuit with sausage, egg, and cheese. It was priced at 6.50 which is overpriced. You order at the register and then find a seat and the food will be brought to you. I waited about 30 minutes before my food was brought to me. It seemed like there was a lot of people waiting for their food then actually getting served. After our food was finally brought out I realized that the biscuit was small and it came with no sides. Overall the taste of the biscuit was what won me over. The other person I was with ordered a single buttermilk pancake which was priced at $3. Although the cost was high... the pancake was good and so was the syrup it came with. Overall it was a good experience but considering the service and the pricing of the meals I was let down. However if your in the area I would recommend you try it out."}, {"review_id": "MITRfT3qPwbrYVGUb4T8JQ", "user_id": "3dgHf8eAuenZIGbzUy5Hsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Expensive for what you get but the food was fresh and delicious.  BlackBerry Lemonade was meh...Burger was off the chain with the salad."}, {"review_id": "opnNYeJfOBv8xKhBheNe0Q", "user_id": "MGkkr8cZJDHThfsd8dhv1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/25/2017", "text": "Found this place online while visiting Little Rock.

Super cute place with vegan/ vegetarian food. Small menu but the establishment is a very friendly and home cooked style food type place. The servers were nice, the mimosas were delicious. They had meat and meat alternatives so everyone can eat happily. Well priced! WoohooooOur only complaint is that we waited 55 minutes just to get to the counter to order food, (however!! we did come on a Sunday morning, so that's something to keep in mind ). Maybe a few more people working would speed it up a bit?

Hamburger was good, but not outstanding!  Others joining me for lunch all had different items and were pleased with their selection.  Would eat there again, but not a place I would eat at frequently.  If you are into all natural and healthy you will probably enjoy.Last visit I had Dante's Inferno Burger.  It was very good, but had to many veggies for me!  Fries still excellent. Unique place and very different menu, but good food! 10/31/17"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-root-cafe-little-rock?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
