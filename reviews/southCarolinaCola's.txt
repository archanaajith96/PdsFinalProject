Everything was so fresh tasting and eloquently presented throughout the evening. Coupled with an amazing ambiance and view, I was more than impressed and will definitely return in the future.Service: One word: phenomenal. It started from the beginning. We were 15 minutes for our reservation, but the host still seated us in the most awesome seat in the house (in my opinion); by the open garage door. The view was great and the breeze coming off of Assembly really threaded well with the ambiance. Our waiter was very pleasant, easy going, and professional. Food:Everything was really great. Very fresh tasting and beautifully presented. The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the macaroni and cheese. It was just cheese, a lot of butter, and cavatappi noodles. The crab cakes had very little filler (which this Charleston girl can appreciate !). The green tomato relish was the perfect compliment. We also had the special which was the grilled Mahi Mahi over cheese grits. It was very fresh and not overly done."}, {"review_id": "lWdLwnpAsXsnyeZbl4OVSA", "user_id": "o3Gwl9wUC9xIAhjkBmHQlQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Service is my focus followed by great food. The service we received from Colas management was subpar for the type of establishment they are. We spent +$600 and they were the most unaccomodating in seating my corporate team of 13 together from the start. They made us make two separate reservations to even host us a MONTH IN ADVANCE. We did so with the request to sit close to each other. We arrive and they have us in separate rooms. We asked if there was any way to sit us close together given the ample number of open tables. Their answer \"we're all booked... Those folks requested a table of 9... We have regulars that submit reservations for specific booths...\" Every excuse was given. The first 6 sat in the front of the restaurant and us 7 sat in a back room. There were 3 open tables the whole 2.5 hours we were there... Service varied greatly from front of restaurant to the back. The front got bread, fresh silverware everytime, and fast and attentive service. Great overall! While us in the back received okay service. Our server took our drink order in waves... He couldn't wait for us all. Never brought bread, it took forever to get our food, forgot to bring dessert plates, etc... We spent +600 and were treated in a very unaccomodating manner. The food.... The entrees were great! Highly recommend the flounder, steaks and scallops. My blackened chicken primavera in parmesan sauce is good. Fried zucchini is excellent! My colleagues said the oil served with the bread is great... I don't know. Desserts were excelente! The Almond Basket is the winner!"}, {"review_id": "O8UCTvUjEsnoS9CtCtJhtA", "user_id": "FMAcF7vnR8z7Fm3MDJ2AcQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "One word: DELICIOUS!

They didn't hold out on the crab in the crab cake and the relish & corn sauce really topped it off. My steak was cooked to a perfect Medium and was well seasoned (fingerling potatoes and green beans were bomb and garlicky too). And my dessert was good too - fluffy mousse cake as expected. Very chocolatey. Service was excellent and friendly. It was a large party coming in at different times and they accommodated us very well. Unfortunately I have no pics of anything.

We heard great things about Cola's through my godbrother and his wife, so I was excited to experience this restaurant in the Vista.Customer service was exceptional. As soon as we walked through the door, we were greeted and the hostess asked if we had a reservation. She confirmed that it was a birthday reservation. Check for me lol!The food was awesome, as I had the roasted chicken dinner with collared greens and sweet potato, and my husband has the salmon with grits and spinach. The wine selections are ample, and they also give you bread with some type of olive oil.

We started with a few glasses wine and beer from their extensive list. I was tempted to get a mixed drink, lots to choose from!, but instead had a glass of sauv blanc.Rather than an appetizer, all six of us either had soup or salad. The heirloom salad was their take on a caprese salad and the tomatoes were bursting with flavor! The crab bisque was flavorful and someone also had the gazpacho.Warm bread and an olive oil/Parmesan/garlic combo tided us over until the meals were served.I had the crab cakes - very meaty, not a lot of filler, with a pineapple chutney atop. The chutney was a little too sweet for my liking, so I scraped about half off each crab cake to tone down the flavor a bit.Also at our table was a filet (cooked well and presented with huge onion rings), the pork chop and apples, a fish special and quite a few of my companions opted for the macaroni and cheese side dish (yummm!).We had 3 desserts, including the almond basket which is a scoop of vanilla ice cream inside a light, think layer of almond crisp, with loads of fresh berries on top. A real treat!!  The Creme Brûlée was just okay, nothing really set it apart.  The Toffee Cheesecake was also really good and the Toffee was crunchy and hit the spot!The only complaint of the evening was the slow service due to the fact that our server had someone shadowing them. I'd suggest not doing that during 7 pm dinner rush for a large group ... took forever and the server literally stopped in between each step to tell the newbie what she was doing."}, {"review_id": "TQ1f9vPaZD5k3y0FJPAsvg", "user_id": "ghxfOafrp1PrDcKlyxpyAA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/21/2017", "text": "I went here for an early Valentine's Day dinner with my boyfriend.

The atmosphere is very enjoyable. In fact. The second we sat down by the window (which was a fancy garage door), my husband said \"yea, I like it here.\" The service we received was nothing special but good nonetheless, as our server made sure drinks were filled and that everything was delivered to our table in a timely manner. We went back and forth about which appetizer to try and ended up getting the pan seared shrimp dumplings. I wasn't impressed with them, but then again I'm half Asian and my dumpling record can be intimidating to most. The citrus soy sauce it was served with was actually the best part! I expected a usual pony sauce to be served with it, but it was lime juice squeezed into soy sauce with a sweetness added. You could even see the pulp and it was delightful. For our entrèes, my husband ordered the Braised Beef and I ordered the Filet Mignon,  after our server claimed they were the most popular meats to choose from. They braise the beef for 2 days, so the tenderness of the meat is unbelievable! My filet mignon was some of the best I've ever had, bursting with flavor that melted in your mouth. This may sound silly, but the most memorable item on my plate were the onion rings. My husband doesn't even like onion rings and he literally said \"that is the best one I've ever had and I could eat a whole plate of those.\" The batter they use for those are delicious and fried to perfection!"}, {"review_id": "AS2zmhUpG8j_6G2Pjxjsrg", "user_id": "P2VwTR-pwCZK-IAtNZzU-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/11/2016", "text": "Appropriately titled, Cola's was once an abandoned RC Cola factory that was renovated into swanky yet casual fine dining experience; furthermore, I really enjoyed my visit here.Service was on point and the food was delicious.  From time time I walked in to the time I departed, I was met with nothing but smiles, warm greetings, and good ol' southern hospitality.  While waiting on my main course, I was given generous pours of wine and some bomb bread and olive oil; refills were waiting on me the moment I finished with the current glass I was drinking / the current loaf I was eating.  As for my main course, The Wagyu Burger was one of the best burgers I have ever experienced.  All the ingredients were fresh and everything tasted just right.

We were told Cola's is a 'swanky establishment' and it seemed that way. The decor was a bit Restoration Hardware meets Industrial. A nice place for date night.The food was memorable, to say the least. I liked every bit of it. The oysters Rockefeller were super Parmesan cheesy and cooked to perfection. For a salad we tried the pear which the Anjou's were cooked perfectly. I would love to learn the recipe of the dressing on the salad. The flounder was probably about the best I have had. Skin and all. They scored the skin, flash fried, and topped it with an asian-inspired sweet and spicy sauce. Truly perfection. If you're not a fish fan, that would be one to try. Extremely fresh and fantastic flavors. The drinks were incredibly weak and expensive. I don't mind a pricey drink, but it needs to have fresh juices (which they did), and actual alcohol in it. The 'martini' I ordered seemingly only had the blood orange juice. I asked the waiter and he happily charged me $6.50 for an additional shot when asked if they could remake it. This is probably the sole reason I docked a star. Just a bit distasteful when I'm spending over $150 for two people to dine."}, {"review_id": "g3mRXXgX555oStOVOjpeEA", "user_id": "hXwS_LnYXbBawHnc6uTtww", "rating": 2.0, "date": "11/6/2017", "text": "Really disappointed in my choice at Cola's.  I was assured the tuna was sashimi grade and would have no sinew.  The tuna was uncutable*!  The waiter removed my plate and went to have the chef prepare another piece of tuna for me.  The manager came by and apologized.  By the time the manager brought out the second piece of tuna my dining companion had completed her meal.  The manager said he wanted to wait while I cut into the tuna to make sure it was okay.  Well, this piece had even more sinew!  The manager offered to bring something else but I decided against that option.I gave Cola's two stars due to the waiter's and manager's attentiveness to the problem.  I will return and try something different.  * a new word that I particularly like."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/colas-columbia?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
