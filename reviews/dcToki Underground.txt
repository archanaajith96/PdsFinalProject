This is the first authentic ramen place in DC .. This place is small and artistic. They really have a good sense of music  it's loud and trendy zzz Hardly it could accommodate 15 people at once ... they serve alcohol too .. I tried sake it was really good.. We ordered dumplings , chicken buns , curry chicken ramen and classic there is no question about the food everything is bloody yummy ..Must visit place when you want to eat something pretty cool in DC .."}, {"review_id": "otLeFSoi7nTiWRpPP-Jzrg", "user_id": "SEpb5M-em5b0Vlmy2-eB6g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Salty.  Got the regular bowl and it was salty  noodles were good texture.  Dumpling come out covered in sauce so it's oily.

It's easy to have been to each of the 'main' restaurants and making your rounds as needed. Personally Toki is my fav and simply being because I do not eat pork, but also the decor... and the little melon candies they give you at the end that I recently order through Amazon prime.If you don't eat pork, veggie ramen is often the only option, for an instant loss of flavor and authenticity. More places are beginning to introduce chicken ramen but I enjoy Toki's the best! It's the only place where I'm feeling equally satisfied at the end as my swine eating companions. I've had a little bit of everything on the menu btw, from hot sake to dumplings everything's good but they definitely have to catch me on pay day because everything adds up fast! $$$Service is cool if you know what to expect. There's a 75% chance you'll be eating facing a wall, squished between others, probably will have to wait outside or at a bar for 30 min or so. Possibly not the best place to go with more than 2 of your friends but the mission is for the food."}, {"review_id": "SvBsOpFHPB0YodWVZwbyVQ", "user_id": "f3yOvysZdckSfFRhrhHOvw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Arrived with a party of 3 at 7:30 pm on a Friday night. Surprisingly, We were seated right away. Service was super nice. Food came out quickly. Very cute, interesting space. We ordered:Fried chicken with buns: DELICIOUS! Chicken was perfectly crisp with a nice tangy/sweet sauce. The dish was served with pickled vegetables, basil, and sauce. Dumplings: yum! Super juicy with an interesting dipping sauce that I would do without. Abura tsukemen: the side soup was DELICIOUS! The dry noodles was topped with a handful of pickled vegetables - too much for my taste, it overwhelmed the noodles. I made the poor decision of pouring the soup over the noodles to mask the slightly sour taste but it resulted in an adequate noodle soup. Red miso: too strong a flavor of miso, not spicy. Noodles had a good texture. Honestly, I would only return for the appetizers and perhaps try the other ramen dishes."}, {"review_id": "65BZ_Th4VCNYH3bQW2mzww", "user_id": "66Tf8URvvmzMDdG2WCVtRw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Visited again last night for a late night dinner around 11pm. No wait to be seated, and our server was attentive. Again I got the Tan Tan Mien, which was again amazing! Hubs got the Red Miso ramen, which he loved.

It's a very cozy place, a bit too close for comfort. I was rubbing elbows with my neighbor. I asked to be reseated, which the manager declined and then reseated us at the bar area. The vegan ramen broth is quite savory and I appreciate that it wasn't that oily. The chewy noodles were the best part! I also enjoyed the ginormous chunks of fried tofu, I've never seen pieces that big! I wish there were more greens and veggies. My fiancee enjoyed the Toki classic ramen and fried chicken steamed bao bao buns. I enjoyed the \"Lillet Lady Lay\" cocktail so much that I got another round! It was refreshing and well-balanced with vodka, lillet, lychee, and lavendar. My fiancee enjoyed his whiskey flight and \"Toki Monster\" cocktail with bourbon, scotch, and bitters topped with porkbelly. I appreciate how Toki Underground is DC's 1st ramen house and offers vegetarian ramen boosting with flavor. I've been to Tokyo and other parts of Japan and found it very difficult to order vegetarian ramen (mostly at airports and large train stations). Granted that we didn't have to wait long, we enjoyed the food and had a nice experience. Given the hype though and 3 hour wait, I would skip Toki Underground as there's a plethora of great restaurants on H street (Farewell, Dangerously Delicious Pies, Poki Papa, Sticky Rice)."}, {"review_id": "8LQKPD3XyCaIHZS4xmoqdA", "user_id": "rUxXi_Af--wXXMAWjJaK8Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "We were brought here by a friend who lives in DC. Coming from California, I have high standard for ramen, so I had some expectation since this place has a lot of good reviews. However, sadly, I cannot use the standards from California to compare. The ramen here to me is definitely just average. We waited for about 1 hr before we got seated. Most likely will not be coming back when I visit DC again."}, {"review_id": "XzJuMyaBuq_GV9w16lgPdQ", "user_id": "SpH5NGNmcP6ObZysIBwRzg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Best ramen I've had (the broth is amazing) and being coupled with great service I have to give it a 5.  Yes, you will probably have to wait since it is a very small restaurant and extremely popular but there are plenty of bars nearby to keep you occupied for a little bit.  You can get carry out and eat in the downstairs/Nextdoor bar or at home for those of you that cannot wait.  We came at 8:30pm on a Saturday and had to wait an excruciating 40 mins or so.  Really wasn't bad at all- we went to the 80's arcade bar next door to kill time and got down on some Mario kart and other Super Nintendo games while taking down a couple cheap drinks.  Hitting Toki and the Arcade bat both up on the same night will most certainly give you a memorable night.  Off of a great recommendation from our server (who was very attentive and helpful), we started with the fried chicken steamed buns and I'd suggest you do it, too.  Get a couple of their cocktails or sake to accompany the steamed buns and you're off to the races.  We also went with some pork dumplings which were tasty as well.We had the Toki Classic, Red Miso, and the Taipei Curry chicken ramen dishes.  All of them were very good in their own way with much different tastes to each dish.  You can't go wrong with the Classic though so give it a whirl and enjoy every last drop of broth.  The food and service is excellent here and it was the best ramen I have had so I think it's worth the hype.  Cool little hole in the wall set up as well."}, {"review_id": "R7pIHCM_lGITxcpcJPDTVA", "user_id": "ozcPrVByGmf-QnQgvN7IRA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Best ramen in DC. Hands down. This was one of the first places I went to when I first came to DC and I keep coming back because it is too good. They have a long wait list, about 2 hours, but it's always worth it. They have a cool, urban vibe inside, and they have four styles of ramen -- I recommend the classic or the miso. I recommend these two because both have the pickled ginger, which really adds a nice touch, and they both have the classic pulled pork. The broth in both is absolutely incredible, and include a lightly poached egg. Seriously, make plans to get to this place ASAP."}, {"review_id": "b9y04DAe-4ZrFjacY3YcYA", "user_id": "pj-67bD58pjaAczrZkAYAA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Shocked when I look and see this only has four stars!

I landed and headed straight here, thinking no one would be here on a Saturday night. WRONG - the wait was over 3 hours!I knew right then, I had to come back. Came back to have lunch and it was delicious. The most annoying part was our waitress - she gave me the opposite of customer service. All I wanted was to sub chicken for pork belly and she said you can do that but for an upcharge. It made no sense since pork belly is usually more expensive than chicken!! She wouldn't budge and I just sat there, appalled. I ended up ordering the Fried Chicken Noodles - it was divine. The flavor was almost too much and I was dying for more broth to dilute the flavor as much as possible. Overall, it was a good experience, seeing as how I've never had a noodle bowl like this own. A true hybrid of Ramen and Noodles."}, {"review_id": "kkZN06pb8cc74wDAZtSjGQ", "user_id": "4kmfWahEwb_iIDD95z4ilg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "So, being a foodie and all, and with hearing about this ramen joint from Diners Drive Ins and Dives, the hubby and I made a special trip to stop in while visiting Washington. We were prepared to wait in a long line, but it was a rainy day (weekday around lunch time) and the place was empty! This was actually nice, because the place is so tiny, I would have felt claustrophobic if it were crowded.The FOOD:- Pork Cheek Steam Buns: These were the best! (actually better than the ramen, sad to say.) They were so flavorful. Price: $10 Rating: 5- Kimchi Ramen: Woooo, this was spicy! But good. Not the best ramen I have ever had, but pretty good. It was missing the Umami that I was so longing for before we arrived. Price: $15 Rating: 4The SERVICE: The service was amazing. Our server was very attentive and even provided recommendations. Outstanding!The ATMOSPHERE: As you may have already read, it's super tiny in there! The place can also be hard to find, as it's just a random door and when you walk in, you go straight upstairs. There is like 1 table in the middle and the rest of the seats are up against the wall, facing the wall. Luckily, the hubby and I got a window seat and were able to look at the lovely rainy day while dining. OVERALL, it was pretty good! We stuffed our bellies with good food and yummy sake and were on about our merry way. It's definitely worth a try and a Ramen institution in DC!Follow me on my way to Foodietown! britneygfoodie.yelp.com"}, {"review_id": "BLuuiJF7IGDOGQ2j5tRdrA", "user_id": "Ii79ooIfL_AlWGpK-DvoNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Writing this review is just going to make me sad that I'm not in DC anymore to eat Toki. I'll pause while I daydream about those steamed buns. Okay. I visited Toki while visiting DC this past weekend. The first time we tried to go to Toki it was a Friday night around 7pm and the wait was about 2 hours long. We opted not to wait because we were starving BUT thankfully we tried again on Saturday with only a 45 minute wait. They were kind enough to text us when our table was ready and we hopped downstairs to the bar for a drink while we waited. Inside is probably the most adorable hipster of a place you could ever imagine. The seating is limited, which is why there is always a wait. But its quaint, I loved looking around at the figurines on the wall. We sat at the bar area that was in front of the windows overlooking the street. The cocktails sounded amazing and so did the entire menu. I kid you not, it took me 20 minutes just to decide which I wanted to try since I only had one shot. I opted for the Red Miso Ramen with  a side of the Endorphine Sauce. I'm a girl who likes my food spicy and the Red Miso Ramen doesn't come spicy. I was told only the Kimchi Ramen does. So I got the Endorphine sauce that is sort of like Sriracha but better! Our table ordered the fried chicken steamed buns as an appetizer. If there is one thing I can say, it's order these! Order many of these! Order 5 orders of these. They come out in a way that you assemble them yourself, which was perfect for our table since we have some vegetable-phobes. The Ramen itself was delicious. My favorite was the broth. There was lots of veggie and lots of noodle/broth ratio. The veggies and egg were cooked perfectly as well. If I could, I would have gone back here multiple times to try all the different Ramen dishes. Do yourself a favor and schedule time to check this place out and come super hungry."}, {"review_id": "lZBCbcA7_V1298Lj1FzSBg", "user_id": "p32osXalEA4Ex58DeV3SIw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Great place overall: food, ambience, service, drinks.

I was surprised because they asked if we had reservations. Traditionally ramen places were walkins only.Onto the food, the chicken buns were salty. The ramen was a-okay. The broth wasnt super thick. The chasu was pulled pork which was disappointing. The runny boiled egg was perfect, but wasnt marinated. I didnt like that they put pickles in it. Still probably better than the other popular ramen place in DC, but a far cry from New York ramen.Great decors though.

Just when you begin to think It was bought out by \"The Pug\", if you are persistent enough you will eventually realize that the entrance is pretty much disguised as The Pug. There is no sign, just some difficult to read white lettering on the door. If I could only use one word to describe my experience at Toki Underground, it would be \"wow\".I ordered the Toki Classic (named after the resto, easy choice for me) with extra noodles and Adrenaline Sauce (the Japanese version of Sriracha, only way, way hotter).The first thing you notice is how large the bowl is. I quickly dumped in all the Adrenaline Sauce and boy was it hot. I can handle my spice too. Anyhow, I was still able to power through. The broth was soooo complex. It was like having a world class chef prepare me a bowl of soup. The healthy serving of chashu pork just melts in your mouth, the noodles are perfectly bouncy, the greens and the pickled ginger liven everything up, but the real star of the dish is the soft boiled egg. It's the best egg I've ever had.I was now experiencing my ramen hangover and was not looking forward to the drive back to Gaithersburg. Again, everything was just \"wow\". I'd be hard pressed to find a better ramen shop in the DC area.Pro Tip: Come alone! The waits are super long, which is okay if you plan on grabbing a cocktail (or five) before dinner. At 9pm on a Saturday night, there was a three hour wait for anymore than one diner. I lucked out and they were able to squeeze me elbow-to-elbow between two strangers."}, {"review_id": "7PyVMl0Tgw6tJ3GujEnEBg", "user_id": "EQuRVtkQdPkyrqj0bbYeuw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "If you want to eat your noodles with much space and in peace, DO NOT GO HERE!
