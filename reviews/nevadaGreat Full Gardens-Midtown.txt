Trying to find a place that I could enjoy a meal with friends and still stay compliant with my Whole30 was stressful. But I'm so thankful for Great Full Gardens! I called ahead and the staff were so helpful in answering all of my questions regarding ingredients. Sadly their bacon has sugar and the only animal based protein I could have was their chicken. But my lunch was still delicious! I ordered the Cobb Salad with the cilantro lime dressing. I nixed the bleu cheese and bacon to make it Whole30 compliant. I also tried vegan cheese for the first time and it was fantastic! Their cashew based vegan cheese is a nice salty addition to their salads, especially if you are like me and need to remove the bacon. Added bonus: during my visit, they were giving away free cookies and prizes to celebrate the restaurant's birthday. I didn't win anything but it was still cool!"}, {"review_id": "wIr_IeoOceWdEQ4vrh7KGA", "user_id": "Uw0gpYbwQ3yctZYXRG6sKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I am still speechless - and let me tell you why - They are my favorite in town! I took off my birthday at the end of March, and as far as food goes - they are my favorite, so family and friends went there - and not only was the food just as excellent as I remember - the service was AMAZING.They are so so so busy there, no wonder they needed another location! But the server, Mike (sorry it's been a couple of weeks, so I can't remember) was so great, he gave us undivided attention, and was focused on all of our strange dietary needs and everything.  And the VEGAN MENU is insane and amazing and delicious!!!!!! They continue to be my FAVORITE. Best In Town - hands down!

We came here with a gift card from a vendor. It was a beautiful day, and we decided this would be our place for lunch. We found a spot to park, which seems to be a problem in that area, and went in to check it out.I think I was the oldest guy in there! I know I was the only guy in there without skinny jeans and a man bun! But, whatever! I didn't go there for fashion contest!I asked for the least healthiest item on the menu, and apparently that was a cheeseburger of sorts. It was good for a burger, nothing incredible.I suppose if you are trying to be hipster, or young, or uniquely like everybody else, this would be a pretty good place to try. And it just wasn't my cup of chai."}, {"review_id": "hwqZEH87E01UrnsL1Lgkrw", "user_id": "njUgJcn8ZN0BdZdNEswRwA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The salmon Paleo bowl is everything.

They pride themselves on top quality ingredients and some really healthy options. This location is a sit-down restaurant unlike the one on campus which is more grab-and-go. Also, this spot is in the heart of midtown which is awesome but their next door neighbors is the strip club. Food is good. This time I got the grilled cheese, add bacon, add avocado. It had like a pesto mayo of sort on it that was awesome. Really good sandwich! It came with a side of Cole slaw which was just okay.

The quality of the food and the portions were both top notch.The service was wonderful from the moment that we walked in until the moment that we left. I notice that they have a takeout counter as well as a delivery option. Happy hour was from 3 to 5 so we were lucky enough to partake in that menu and got half price appetizers. We ordered the Caprese salad with mozzarella, the chips with white bean dip and daiya (vegan) cheese and the stuffed vegan mushrooms. They were all delicious. For our main course we ordered the Elvis, The BLT a sandwich with a side of quinoa, the vegan Reuben sandwich with the side of coleslaw, and then neatball vegan  sandwich with a side salad. Absolutely everything was delicious and the portions are great. Hubs and I got $5 sangria from the happy hour menu and my schmoo got the strawberry lemonade. We will definitely be back, probably way too much.

I merely skimmed the surface of their menu this time with an order of Avocado bruschetta, which is avocado spread on toasted multi-grain Ciabatta, topped with diced radishes, tomatoes and pea sprouts, then drizzled with lemon and oil. It was freakin' delicious!!! Super fresh and healthy ingredients.

The menu is on the healthier side which I really enjoyed. They use a lot of veggies and love that they have almond milk and soy as options to drink. My daughter ordered a kids oatmeal which came with brown sugar, choice of milk, bananas, and almond slices. She loved the oatmeal and putting the sides in it. My other daughter ordered kids pancakes which I actually enjoyed more than her. They were small and fluffy. Loved the flavor of the pancake even with no syrup on it.

During this visit we were celebrating my roommates college graduation. I thought it was strange that he wanted to go here for his graduation lunch, but now I know why. I chose the BLTA for my meal this outing. It was made with naan bread, tomato aioli, tomatoes, bacon and avocado. On the side was a quinoa salad. Everything was delicious. I even got to try my friends Turkey Pesto Sandwich, which was also delicious.Overall, it was a pleasant experience.

She had them awhile back and now GG's liege waffle is basically the gold standard--what every waffle should strive to be. I was skeptical at first, especially after they brought this teeny tiny waffle to my table, but I have to agree with her. A liege waffle is a more dense waffle made of a dough that uses a special technique and ingredients. It's small, like I noted, but one of them will easily fill you up. In addition to being perfectly crispy and delicious, you can choose from a variety of toppings that are not common. For example, I regularly get the Funkytown version which includes bleu cheese, apples, honey, and cinnamon. It's a perfect balance of sweet, funky, crunchy, and savory that takes me out of my normal breakfast rut. The roommate gets the Bedazzle, which includes bacon, eggs, cheese, and basil. It's a really nice savory combination when contrasted with the slight sweetness of the waffle it's on top of. I got a side of bacon last time and it was good, but a little overcooked for my tastes. Service is always really good here, but there is definitely a crowd and you potentially have a bit of a wait in front of you if you're looking for a table. Generally, though, if it's a not a weekend, you can get in pretty quickly to give one of these waffles a shot."}, {"review_id": "K48bYN35frQ5oCuRsdgy-Q", "user_id": "ux8oH7TvcbSUGdrbC5c8tA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "Day one I got a Gluten-free breakfast tacos.
