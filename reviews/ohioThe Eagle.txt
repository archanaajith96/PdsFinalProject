It's always very busy for a reason - the food is very good and not expensive!I get the half chicken, which you get white meat and dark meat. It's fried and comes with a jalapeño honey to drizzle over it, which is to die for! Sweet, spicy, and savory at its best! The Mac and cheese is one of my favorite sides to get. I got a kale salad last time I went and it was just alright. I also have gotten the collard greens in the past and I didn't like those, it tasted like they weren't cleaned very well because it felt like there were grains of sand in it, which really ruined it for me. But, I really like the atmosphere here and they do fried chicken really good! Make sure you get here early or have a plan to drink at other bars until they text you to tell you your table is ready!"}, {"review_id": "dIdUfNt20T2VY_PIn3BK4A", "user_id": "r0PIAIRRsaxpF7z9SRCT1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Absolutely LOVED dining at The Eagle and I really hope to come back here next visit to Cincinnati! It was a beautiful day out so it was extremely busy but my friend and I were given a table pretty much straight away, which was awesome!We started with a pitcher of the Eagle Iced Tea (apparently their most potent and popular cocktail) and also some Fries and the Mac & Cheese to share. The drink was very tasty but it didn't seem to be overly strong on the alcohol, fries were also yummy but the Mac & Cheese was hands down my favourite! For my Main I ordered the Fried Chicken Sandwich and it was absolutely delicious! So fresh, so tasty and the portion size was huge! I took the other half home and ate it the next day!Staff were prompt, polite and so helpful when it came to asking questions about the menu. Definitely worth a visit."}, {"review_id": "7wJNldY-1HcN_W2HJDDCDA", "user_id": "XCXOzS3AekUGbOsexWeVdA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "Well..we came here for what we heard was the best fried chicken in the area and..spoiler alert..we were NOT disappointed. Everything about the chicken here is delicious..the breading is amazing, crisp, perfectly seasoned..the chicken itself is some of the juiciest chicken I've ever had. Overall I can definitely see what all the hype is about.We ate here on a Saturday afternoon. The place was already pretty packed when we got there. They sat us at one of their \"communal\" tables..basically they sat us at one of the a longer table and they eventually sat another group at the other end. Normally I am very uncomfortable with this kind of set-up but honestly it wasn't that bad. The hostesses were all so nice and personable. Our waiter was super attentive and very patient in explaining the menu to us and making sure we understood how things worked there. Basically if you want the fried chicken you can choose between a quarter, a half, or a whole chicken. A quarter's enough for one person, a half for two (or one really hungry person), a whole is enough for 3-4 (or one really REALLY hungry person).The side dishes are pretty big in size as well and are pretty much set up to be shared with others. We each ordered a quarter of chicken and a side of mac and cheese and fries to split. As I said earlier, the chicken is out of this world and has every right to carry the kind of hype that it does. The mac and cheese was amazing as well. It had a breaded crust on top that mixed perfectly with the mac and cheese and the combined flavors were amazing. The fries were pretty good, pretty heavily seasoned..the side of aioli that came with them pushed their flavor factor up substantially. I can see myself craving this chicken in the future. Much like the island in Lost..we have to go back!!"}, {"review_id": "esSGK3GOBr57jH6CeJ6Wjg", "user_id": "H7cgV5VZB8SebCVPqEoRFw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Beware, this place is extremely popular! We went in late on a Monday evening and thought the wait wouldn't be long and still had about a 20 minute wait. It didn't bother us at all, but just know that you will likely have to wait when you arrive. There is a big bar and outdoor standing room and the food is worth waiting for! My friend and I split the fries and Mac & Cheese so that we could try as much as possible. I had the yummy grilled cheese but you really come here for the Fried Chicken and everyone raves about it. The food was plentiful, the Mac & Cheese is easily shareable - especially if you have a sandwich coming! It's cheesy, delicious and totally worth it...even if you are going to eat it alone, you're secret is safe with me.Loved the vibe in the room. It was cool, hip, not too loud and the staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. My fiancé adores this place so I know we will be back.

Been here several times on visits to Cincinnati, and so happy there's now a location in my hometown of Indianapolis! My son and I popped in last week after a quick stop at Rhinegeist and were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away. The Eagle isn't large, and you should probably be prepared to wait for a table. It's dark and cozy inside with cool light fixtures and shared banquette seating. The menu's not huge either, but covers fried chicken in various serving sizes and all the greatest-hit side dishes you want along with it -- cornbread, mac and cheese, bacon, biscuits, pickles, greens, cole slaw, grits, mashed potatoes.... my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  The kiddo and I enjoyed a 1/4 dark order (with two extra drumsticks for him), creamy decadent mac and cheese and biscuits with butter and blackberry jam. A meal that would make any grandma proud. Don't skimp on the spicy honey that comes with the chicken -- soooooo good. I keep hoping someone at the Eagle will devise a bourbon cocktail with this stuff. To drink, there's a full bar and a nicely vetted beer list.

We arrived at 3:30pm on a Sunday afternoon, thinking it would be like the lull, but we were given a 1 hr and 15 min wait time. Wow! But it was alright, because there are a lot of interesting stores up and down the street to kill your time with (they text you).Good news, the wait was actually only 40 min, they probably overestimate. We were seated with another party at a table, we didn't mind. We ordered a whole chicken to share (3 ppl), mac n cheese, biscuits, and candied bacon for an app. The food was definitely enough. The chicken was nice and crispy but still moist on the inside, the honey Tabasco sauce is super yummy and pairs well. My honest favorite were the sides. The mac n cheese is sooooo creamy but not overwhelming at the same time - you can eat the whole thing and not be sick of it. Definitely tops my list of best mac n cheese I've had. The biscuits kind of scared me in the beginning - they look dry from the outside but let me tell you... it was extremely moist and buttery on the inside, it crumbles as you dip into the raspberry sauce. So good and not drying when you eat it.

My friend hadn't arrived yet, though, so I was told to wait until my guest had arrived. I was stressed about it because we were planning to catching a show at the Music Hall (newly renovated!) at 1, but eventually she arrived and we were seated at 12:10. Our waitress was accommodating when we let her know we wanted to order right away because we were heading to the show. The food came out super quickly; we each ordered a 1/4 chicken, dark meat, and shared spoon bread and macaroni and cheese. The chicken was really enjoyable, a total guilty pleasure. The skin wasn't too breaded, which is a relief, and it was quite juicy. I also liked the spicy honey, nice touch. The macaroni and cheese, like all reviews say, was super tasty, while the spoon bread I would probably not get again, and we definitely didn't need two sides to feel satisfied.

Moving on to the actual restaurant, it's comfortable, warm, welcoming, it's a really nice little place.

My sister took me here for brunch a couple years ago, and I recently returned for dinner. Between two people, we had a whole chicken, mac & cheese, and spoonbread. We were able to finish everything (admittedly, I ate a little more than half), and I loved every bite! The chicken tasted fresh, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The key player was the spicy hot honey. Oh my goodness, I couldn't get enough of it! It complemented the chicken perfectly. The mac & cheese was one of the best I've had. It was so gooey and cheesy. A must! I was also a fan of the spoonbread. Everything came together for a delicious meal.The ambiance of the restaurant was the cherry on top for a great meal. The outdoor seating is first-come first-served, so we jumped on a table as soon as it was open. This reduced our wait time significantly!
