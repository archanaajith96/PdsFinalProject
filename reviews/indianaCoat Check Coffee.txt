I work remotely, so finding a comfortable shop with good coffee is a must.The reviews for Coat Check are AWESOME! I couldn't wait to work here and check it out. When you walk inside the building it is beautiful and nicely decorated. It's very cozy and comfortable. The baristas were very friendly and the macaroons (sea salt caramel omgggg) were very very very very verryyyyyyyyyyy good. So was the coffee. I got a simple latte. Everything was fine and dandy, until it wasn't. There were no tables available with an outlet and I needed an outlet for my computer. I noticed a large couch had a table of some sort attached to it with an outlet. I sat myself there and proceeded to work. I had my legs crisscrossed and faced the table. I sat like this for a good 2 1/2 hours. Sitting like that for that long causes my little leggies to go to sleep. So I switched up my position and had one leg hanging off the couch and one foot on the couch. Everything is dandy at this point.I had a work call (with a client) that I was using headphones for. During my call I was interrupted by a woman saying I needed to take my shoes off (I think, couldn't really hear because I was A. Talking to a client and B. Had my sound proof headphones in). So I just moved my foot off the couch. Hindsight yes I can see not taking my shoes off on the couch as rude. But, I feel that for someone to interrupt a work call to tell me so is very unprofessional. As soon as my call ended a gaggle of screaming children came into the vicinity and I was no longer able to continue to work.I think this coffee shop has great coffee and food. I will be back for that. But I will probably not try and work here again."}, {"review_id": "z_qgkWsspZgs4JQTR-DhGQ", "user_id": "ct9B-lnP15W7hB-oqBMOlw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Want to jazz up your morning? Walk in Coat Check Coffee and order a Coat Check Cola. What's that? espresso, orgeat (google it, I did) and garnished with a luxardo cherry (just go ahead and google that one, too), and orange. After coming here three mornings in a row, I also tried Iced tea and green tea (both were decent, but nothing to write home over).The vibe in Coat Check Coffee is charming and only mildly pretentious. Like...everyone is wearing earbuds, but you know they're all listening to NPR (Confession: I was too). The baristas definitely give off that \"I'm a little-too-cool-for-school-barista vibe\", but to be fair...I sort of expect it out of this type of place. With a great location and some awesome drink & food choices, Coat Check Coffee is the place to go for your Mass Ave Caffeine fix."}, {"review_id": "ZtytBSr2PSwTwY1A3z0voQ", "user_id": "WU37eI3PFubXlE95wDYD5g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "So many of my friends suggested that I try out Coat Check Coffee. Since I am not a \"coffee person,\" I kept it at the back of my mind but I didn't feel like I needed to make a special trip to try out this cafe. On St. Patrick's Day, I found street parking that happened to be on the fun run route and could not leave downtown after dropping my husband off for work. It was this circumstance that caused me to wander into Coat Check Coffee and I do not regret it one bit!Coat Check Coffee is essentially located in the hallway/foyer of the historic Athenaeum Building, which is also home to multiple businesses including the Rathskellar, YMCA and Basile Theater. While you would think this would be an odd place to relax with a cup of coffee and a pastry, it is quite oddly relaxing. The decor is a whimsical mix of traditional and modern that can make anyone feel at home. While I was there alone and content to not be bothered. The cafe also seems to be a great place to meet with friends as a few of the neighboring tables were friends chatting quietly over their morning coffees.Most of the previous yelp reviews mentioned an amazing Butterscotch Latte. Again, I am not a coffee person, but I decided to try it. In addition, while the ham and cheese croissants that were in the oven smelled fantastic, I ordered the St. Patrick's Day special chocolate donut. I think it had Guinness or Jameson in it. Unfortunately, they ran out of these quickly so I did not get a photo of the sign noting the ingredients. Both the donut and the coffee were NOT a disappointment. I savored each bite of the rich chocolate donut and sipped on the sweet latte between bites as I watched the people in the cafe. After enjoying about half an hour of people watching, I walked to my car and prayed that I made it home before I slipped into a sugar coma.p.s. I loved the heart the barista made in my latte. I know that many places do this, but I rarely get coffee."}, {"review_id": "mcMyoL_ahSHu35DXmwHauA", "user_id": "wXdbkFZsfDR7utJvbWElyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "Since I retired, I've spent a lot of time checking out public art, historic buildings with cool architecture, and visiting most areas of the city just to see what I've been missing.  So, I couldn't believe I took so long to visit Coat Check Coffee.  And, I wasn't even planning on it.  I was taking pictures of a new art installation on the west end of the Athenaeum.So, imagine my delight when I stepped into this massive building (b. 1893) that is filled with beautiful woodwork throughout the entryway.  But, in case you were thinking this would be some stuffy, highbrow place, a vividly colorful mural is painted on the east wall of the stairwell and wraps around through the entry.  Once I got up the stairs to the main floor, the space was transformed into a modern and stylish meeting space with lots of guests plugged in to their computers in small groups sipping coffee and noshing on munchies.It was a little confusing since there wasn't really a line for ordering...lots of folks just standing near the order counter.  Still, the server behind the counter called out to me and said she would be with me in a moment.  And she was.That gave me time to look over the counters of food on display.  They don't have a lot of food to choose from, but I'll take quality over quantity any time!   I wanted something sweet, so I picked a Blueberry Cheesecake Macaron.  Wow!  Fresh and tasty.  I wanted something savory, so I picked a Ham and Cheese Croissant.  Fresh baked, warm and buttery.  Another Wow!And when it comes to coffee, I have simple tastes:  a cup of black coffee that isn't scalding hot and has a rich flavor.  Tinker Coffee took care of that and I could drink it as soon as I picked my spot to enjoy it.  No burned tongue to make the food (and coffee) become tasteless.  Everything from service to taste to environment was good and felt relaxed and inviting.On the technical side, you hover near the counter and step up when you see an opening.  They take your name and call out to you when it is ready.  They didn't seem to have trays, so be aware you may have to juggle a bit if you order a lot.  Coffee is served in real mugs, not disposables.  That means, you need to bus your own space (a collection bin is near the place to get napkins on the main floor.)  And parking isn't free.  Hopefully, you can find a metered street spot close by.They just celebrated their first anniversary in this space at the time of my review.  Don't wait for a reason to go...just go!Review #589"}, {"review_id": "Iwo5itq6c3TRgOlitqqQbg", "user_id": "j3XwzFVZF8p54XUWRExhFg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "This place knocks the socks off your coffee chains (looking at you, Starbucks!).Not only is it located in a beautiful building, but the baristas are friendly and the ambience (for studying, working or just hanging out) is perfect.  There is PLENTY of space.  I didn't realize how huge this place is!  Plenty of tables to spread your work out on, or lots of couches and chairs to sit down and binge watch some YouTube.Did I forget to mention the delicious lattes?  Coffee was great as well.  I had their butterscotch latte and it was amazing.  Best latte I have ever had.Come here and have some fancy (and fairly priced!) coffee :)"}, {"review_id": "5xGJw_NxXoNyDyDcXFJeHQ", "user_id": "wniSiq1OoP8ebmAmIQQk3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "I have bookmarked this place for a long time.

My boyfriend loves this place, and he is slowly converting me to the dark side. When I go or join him I get a flavored latte (too dampen the strong coffee flavor). Big fan of the pistachio and chocolate. I've had a few matcha lattes too. They always have a dairy alternative. Today they had oat milk - yes, oat juice! Had never heard of it!Baked goods are very good. Today we had a blueberry muffin that was surprisingly dense and drizzled with a hibiscus frosting. Loved the unexpected punch of flavor from the frosting! My boyfriend consistently gets their croissants, which they bake in-house (aka 'in the coat check'!)I like the modern, colorful furniture. Lots of outlets for plugging in electronics. However, WiFi is just so-so. I can't get Skype video or other video conferencing to work well. Just too many people accessing... hence the 4 stars. Maybe get a additional router?This place is always very busy on weekends. Hit or miss on weekdays. Beware that this space flows into other business areas of the Athenaeum like the Y and rental spaces for meetings and events. Expect your reading or working session to be interrupted by wedding parties (rehearsals and actual wedding day). They will be loud and taking pictures and generally disregarding that other people exist."}, {"review_id": "DPBJ9Rpu_FY02hjkR7uCxg", "user_id": "XItANpHKQO3MLgErEmSYsg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "They just keep getting better.
