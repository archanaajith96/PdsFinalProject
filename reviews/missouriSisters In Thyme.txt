The cafe offers a wide selection of gluten free items but the menu was very simple. The sandwich I ordered was very good, but there weren't a lot of toppings to choose from. I also ordered a side of the tomato soup, which was delicious! The menu seems a bit overpriced for what they are offering, but our food came out quickly and the service was great. I will definitely be back for more soup or a baked good."}, {"review_id": "EAh_ncRBFTuqUQrlGitO9w", "user_id": "KgDtoAvntrW45_F9iWF41Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/10/2017", "text": "As soup and sandwich places go, Sisters in Thyme offers exactly what you'd expect, but does little to exceed those expectations in any meaningful way. I began my visit with the spinach and mushroom salad, which to my delight, was heavy on leafy greens. However, it was light on just about everything else, and a fair amount of the spinach itself was questionably safe to eat. To be fair, past experience with substandard greenery has made me a bit of a stickler on this topic, but when you're being charged $8 for a salad, I think it's fair to hold that salad to a high-ish standard. That aside, the bacon dressing was an interesting accoutrement, although surprisingly sweet to an extent that made me glad I ordered it on the side. Unfortunately, I was informed that's not something they like to do, so you may not have the same luxury on your visit. The second half of my meal took the form of the roast beef and blue jack sandwich, which contained substantial meat and good overall flavor. The bread was buttered and toasted to the perfect level of crispness, although beyond that it was not altogether different than what one might get from a quality loaf at any supermarket.None of this is to say that the food isn't good - it absolutely is - but it's probably not worthy of a five star review average. And, as such, it is not a place I will go out of my way to avoid in the future, but neither is it one I will seek out purposefully."}, {"review_id": "v4zjiM-pn8L8xV_MUN82zA", "user_id": "Y5iTX26HyeWDfKwY7BexWQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "This place is awesome!

We went as a group of six at about 12:40 in the middle of the week. We all ordered a variety of items from the pasta special to my choice the Ruben. I like my sandwich although I prefer a heartier marble rye. The sandwich had plenty of tasty corned been and was quite moist which I liked. I tried the German potato salad and it was good but I prefer mine a little creamer and also with more tang. I also had a side of deviled eggs which were simple but reminded me of moms and that is a good thing. To drink they offer multiple bottle options and I was happy to see them carrying the individual bottle of milk from almost  local Edgewood Creamery which is an amazing milk and the perfect drink for a Reuben pairing. My lunch cost was around 15. which I didn't think was bad for a full sandwich, two sides and a premium milk. My only issue is that it took a pretty long time to get our order taken due to the staff trying to make food and take orders at the same time. However once the order was in the food came out very quick. Its a nice option to have on Commercial street for sure."}, {"review_id": "JK_-gPA4ldyg8MLrtPFtpg", "user_id": "kKeji0ukksoaTq6nofjEmw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/30/2017", "text": "Stop at Sisters in Tyme. We, 2 retired guys and 1 retired gal, did for lunch. The chicken sandwich on artisan bread was good. The Rueben sandwich was rated excellent. The roast beef sandwich was outstanding. The eclectic decor is an excellent conversation focus. This is a remodeled brick store in the old railroad section of Springfield.
