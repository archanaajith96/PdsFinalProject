Some background: early 20's thought I HATED sushi so when my sister, husband, and his friend went out I barely ate...that was until my sis introduced me to Dynamite Sushi in Hudson and dared me with some cash as incentive. Shortly after I moved to AZ and there are sushi places on almost every corner but they slather it in sauce to mask the sawdust taste (or complete lack of taste). Moved back and was depressed Dynamite closed. Tried a few other local places then came Yoshimama. I ordered so much because I couldn't decide my bill was just under $100 but we'll worth it. Have yet to try anything that isn't spectacular, fresh, and leaves u wanting more even when u r stuffed.Neither of my parents like the idea of sushi so theyve been trying the Teriyaki dishes. I have to say, teriyaki isn't my favorite but when I tasted my dad's order the first time it was better steak than I've had in Boston. Even better it easily makes 2 meals. My mom has had both beef and chicken and same reaction.Only a slight negative is the price but I assume it's because everything is exceptionally fresh and I'll happily pay a bit more for the freshest around. Service is always on point, I've never had to wait, and everyone who works there is happy.accomodating and pleasant. Such a nice change! If u haven't yet, try Yoshimama. Perfect for the couple where only one half is a sushi enthusiast! (No judgement there )Tako, my.yelp app won't let me update but exactly why I thought it was more expensive but hey, who cares when the food is so incredibly and always consistent. 20 orders in 14 months and never one issue!"}, {"review_id": "FJ_uP0dtOcMAq9WLCHbUfw", "user_id": "0wBI9RiVyf9HnL1IuGCCUw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "UnimpressedThe low-carb menu is gone.The dishes are extremely overpriced.

We paid and went elsewhere to get something sweet.I wouldn't go back here:Limited strip mall parking (we got the very last spot)Very small interior with only six tables Overpriced Complete lack of customer serviceThe food was decent for Nashua, but you can't charge downtown Boston prices with a McDonald's approach to customer service."}, {"review_id": "We33Rg7Wlsbz0Xsl46OHtQ", "user_id": "9bR_HILAQDOpejwynGCzBA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Lunch holds some real value, decent food and bentos.Not sure if its family run, but they are all great. Very friendly and accommodating.My issue is/was the weak drinks and the miso soup. Fine, whatever, every bar has their rules, but I wouldnt bother with the drink I had last few times...and kombu is chopped up and left in the soup [??!], leaving a slimy off texture and a fishy off taste that follows you well after you leave. Kombu isnt supposed to be left in the dashi, just til the simmer point and immediately removed. Just pushed it away after a few spoonfuls.The pork cutlet/sweet rice [katsudon?]bento is better than YouYou, but thats not saying much. Im going to swing in there again soon and try a few different things. Service and value A-Food C+3 1/2 stars. Edit:  since Ive been called out [see comment below by angry soupguy who handles \"customer relations\"] I'll bite...or maybe I'll take a picture next time of the chopped up pieces of kelp. It's soup not rocket science and it had chopped up Kombu [kelp] in it on my visit, hence the overpowering flavor of...wait for it...Dried kelp....left in, slimy, murky, fishy. Was exactly how it was served, so not sure why the response says it was not. Weird. Anyways back to pretending how to make dashi...maybe the prepcook/dishwasher was having a bad day. Dashi is tradionally made this way, I learned it and make it traditionally. [below]Pretending:1: Dashi is the base of Miso soup along with many other Japanese broth based dishes. Dashi is water, and strips of kombu just brought to the point of simmer or water starting to \"roll\" AND REMOVED. Heat is shut off. 2: Katsuobushi is then added and steeped and strained. I do mine for maybe 10 minutes or so.Katsuobushi, Kombu, tofu and miso paste are all purchased easily at Saigon Asian Market in Manchester NH. [which is a fantastic local purveyor btw] to finish the soup. I only got it because it was placed in front of me when I ordered lunch...it was included with my lunch.Another tip for the angry soupguy below--- that I do for larger batches; hold the cubes of tofu, and rather add the tofu to empty bowl and pour soup over it to order. This way, you dont have cloudy, murky soup with half disintegrated pieces floating throughout. You know...so it looks fresh?"}, {"review_id": "bEoSrbuPynqPjxzPBGhXqA", "user_id": "JBemRpk6K8jqsiKeoc00ew", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "It was pretty good.

This place is tucked in a small shopping plaza. Not a whole lot of parking. Minor details.This place was packed on a Friday night. Service was good! Waitress all giggly and in a good mood! That helps.Food was good, but not great. Had the Hotate-Hokkaiyaki as appetizers (Fresh scallop bake w/ crab stick spicy mayo mix) and the Hot Mama Combo entree (spicy tuna, spicy salmon, spicy yellowtail makis).Appetizers was delicious. Makis, well, they were 'ok'. All three rolls had fried tempura (or somethin') mixed with the spicy fish. As a cheap filler? I don't get it. It ruins the taste, in my opinion. I usually eat 3-4 maki rolls easily, but there I could hardly finish 3 because if this fried __ they mix with the fish preparation. If we go back again, I'll make sure to ask for makis without any fried ___ mixed in.But then again, it was 'good', but there are many other better closer sushi restaurants. So... We'll see."}, {"review_id": "JD1tbJbe5nzdJsnXEL9Vug", "user_id": "YHseo7g67rr0cgSd-sPtBA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Good sushi and good overall Japanese fare"}, {"review_id": "OSeq4i9ENMrBxzOHudnP4Q", "user_id": "qudHk5wo0DHufJbMmvO-8Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Always amazing.

The taste was good but I think the hamachi was frozen and was still a little watery.After I was done, they dropped the bill down pretty quick without asking if I wanted more or another drink. Perhaps they are used to people leaving as fast as possible.Overall it was a nice meal but next time I'll try someplace else.  At least it was an improvement over what I experienced years ago."}, {"review_id": "UygNrnIUxUnSxjKEhagm3Q", "user_id": "AMtwMvFcVGrA3oBCPApA4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "This is definitely our favorite sushi in town.
