First of all the sushi is amazing, you can tell the chef is really passionate about what they create. The atmoshpere of the resturant is super cozy too, there's only so many seats so you feel pretty special at you're table. The waitress is also a gem! Her demeanor is very down to earth and she eems to genuinly care about the costumers experience. I have come here for both my anniversary and valentines day, and both times I have been so happy/pleased with my meal and time there. If you are in the eugene area you HAVE to eat here!"}, {"review_id": "Y8RtYN_mMDJovyL3O5-WGg", "user_id": "nEnvPEBoZE5pR5700Afw7A", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "If there was an option for minus I would use it.The only server is so rude and she as her boss ( \"chef\" ) have such huge ego!He thinks he's the best cook ever in the history of this planet he has the worst attitude. We had a very negative experience. I told the server I wasn't happy about my experience I told her I am a server as well and I told her I would never treat a guest they way she treated my big birthday party she was smiling and laughing at me. The owner/chef told us to go F ourselves the server throw the check in our faces and walked away!!!! OMG!!! Good thing we were regulars and \"friends\" w them I wonder how we would have treated us if not.NEVER EVER GOING BACK to such a place where I'm treated like trash!! Oh and he demanded we payed!!

If you love sushi, this is a must in Eugene. Mame is located in the Whiteaker neighborhood, and you'll miss it if you aren't looking for it. Seriously, it's so tiny there's no bathroom inside- just a few tables and a view into the kitchen where the magic happens! Make a reservation early- like weeks before if possible. Plan to spend a couple of hours (and a chunk of cash)-- this is not just a meal, it's an experience! We did the 7 course, alternating between sushi and other dishes and it was amazing!!!  (and so exciting to see what was next!) I normally like sushi rolls and don't eat sashimi or nigiri, but this place converted me. One of the best foodie experiences I've ever had!!"}, {"review_id": "bjgqC5VIj4rUQ8aKjLFpVg", "user_id": "z3Y2-jlS2nV8snZRrkczAw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/3/2017", "text": "We had an absolutely amazing meal here last Saturday. We were seated at the bar and were able to chat with the chef, which made the meal extremely enjoyable. We ordered just about everything on the menu -- the omnivore, chefs special, as well as some rolls. Everything was amazing (and I don't even like sushi that much). The best was the surf and turf with the fried shrimp. The restaurant is extremely small so make sure you make a reservation in advance. It can also get quite loud, though this may have had to do with us going on a football game night."}, {"review_id": "KFsu8sUXloIhHJZ9PMcEkQ", "user_id": "g3CuQb2tOKNRP-rXvpX3jg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "It would be hard to add more praise than that offered by the zillions who say this is the best of the best.

I've been trying to come here for a few months now. Each time I call to get put on the wait list, they tell me, \"We're busy until about 9-9:30pm, but we can add you to the wait list!\" Like most places who tell me that, I politely declined and thought, \"They must be busy tonight, we'll try it some other time.\" After doing this for 2 months, I finally told my wife, \"Screw it! We're waiting until 9:30 to eat Sushi! This place has been busy until 9pm for months, which tells me something good is going on down there!\"At 9:00pm, I received a call from Rose letting me know that our seating was going to be available in 20 minutes. We arrived on time, and had the chance to sit at the Sushi Bar. Mame is a very small space. I believe maximum capacity is right around 16 people. I personally have never ate somwhere so small, however I didn't let this quark change how excited I was to try this place out.My wife was able to get a glass of wine, and I opted for a Ninkasi IPA. As much as we wanted Sake, we weren't feeling it that night. They do have a good selection of it however.As I've seen suggested by others, we had the Chef's Choice. We payed $25 each and were able to get an amazing plate of Nigiri. Smoked Eel, Tuna, Scallops, Salmon, and a few speciality roles are what we recieved. I can't start to explain how amazingly FRESH this food was. It was amazingly tender and completely disinegrated once it hit your pallet. The flavor's mixed so well, and after eating a whole sitting of it, never had any type of \"fishy\" after taste that lingered on. It was superb! I have now questioned all other sushi I've had previously after eating at Mame.After our dinner, we were able to catch up with Taro, Rose and Patrick. Taro is the Sushi Chef who is a master in his own respect. His passion for HIGH QUALITY goes beyond the norm. He told me, \"Our customers work hard for their money. We dont want you to come in and spend your hard earned cash on a terrible meal. We want you to enjoy every last bite and be happy that you spent your money with us.\" Hell yeah Taro! Preach on!Patrick was great talking to as well. He explained how Mame started, and the vision they had. Clearly they're killing the Sushi scene in Eugene. Rose was very kind, attentive and a pleasure to talk with also.  Being able to sit down and chat with them after eating, was a great addition to the experience. Mind you, we were the last customers of the night.I cannot praise Mame enough for their Sushi. Heaven sent to say the least. I have a new passion for Sushi, and Mame has likely damn near ruined me from here on out. Great work Mame!"}, {"review_id": "cmS29pq59sKxSmDqeCAY0A", "user_id": "qtyn2QQVcbQIP9z1Ww94RA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Disappointed when it's chefs choice Sunday and it  turns into just rolls- nothing exciting. Nothing different than other sushi places with the exception of waiting forever for the stand in chef to finish making a platter. For gods sakes if you know you are only going to serve rolls have the decency to stay ahead of the demand. So disappointed! I guess that explains why they'll be closed on Sunday's and Mondays from now on. Ugh.

Might just be the best sushi experience. Teeny tiny unassuming, no frills place with a portable heater taped to the ceiling corner. What it lacks in decor ( which is SO Eugene and super quaint), it more than makes up for with incredible food and over-the-top friendly service. Every dish that comes out outdoes the previous one. Sit at the counter and be entertained by the sushi master as he rocks out to rap music, while creating bite size delights. Clearly an artist. The sous chef and kitchen runner move in synchronicity, whipping up mouth watering side dishes. This could be a Michelin Star establishment, Eugene style. Charming as all get out and heavenly food. Oh - and you won't get in without a reservation, plus the restroom is outside.

It's totally a hole-in-the-wall, and you could easily walk by without realizing what a gem this place is. Don't. Stop, turn around, and walk inside. There, you'll find a cozy space that seats maybe 10-15 people, incredibly friendly staff, and artful chefs doing their thing behind the sushi bar. I definitely recommend getting there early, and calling ahead to get added to the wait list. With it being a small place, and having such high-quality food, the place gets swamped! As far as decor, it's no-frills... you have to let the food speak for itself here, and let the chef speak for it too, if you have the opportunity to chat with him.

A unique dinning experience where there is no set menu but instead the chef whips up food items based off of dietary restrictions and inventory. Trust me, no matter what they bring you, you will be satisfied and asking for more. I chose the 7 course tasting menu (4 entree's & 3 sushi plates) for $50.  *my friend went for lunch & they served her food \"until she was full.\" The price was then set to how many plates she had consumed by the end of her experience. Some of our entree's included: *Giant scallops soaked in butter, so rich they literally melted in your mouth. *Short ribs that literally fell off the bone when I picked them up. They were cooked to perfection with just the right amount of fat. *Octopus ravioli - wasn't the craziest about the texture or flavor but when else would you get the opportunity to eat octopus ravioli? *Fried shrimp which was prepared in a way where you could actually eat the tail. I literally dream about these all the time. Every entree served was an 11/10. Every piece of sushi was Nigiri. I've always been picky on raw fish but it tasted as if it was caught and prepared in the same day! CONS: my roommate called 3 weeks in advance for a reservation at 7:30, upon arrival they told us they were running 45 MINUTES LATE. Arriving at 8:15 we did not leave the restaurant until 11:30 pm..... service was so slow (about one plate every 20 minutes) so there was a lot of sitting and waiting for our next plate. We were seriously still hungry after eating, even though we all had 7 plates of food, it was light & paced over 3 hours. We ended up missing plans for my roommates birthday after dinner because it took so long and stuffing our face with more food once we got home. They did comp us $20 and two free desert for the inconvenience, however, it does not make up for missed birthday plans on a Friday night!! All in all, our waitress was great and my mouth was watering from the descriptions of the food alone. The place is small and crammed and the bathroom is basically a shack out back, which is a little sketchy. It was lengthy, however, the food was so worth it. I will be back in the future to see what kind of unique dishes they can serve up"}, {"review_id": "Uk9BR03P9_Uvs923fIrlXg", "user_id": "jH2z7_ERZ8mD-aI38hsthg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/13/2017", "text": "Let's keep this simple.

It was hard to find because there are no signs. It's in a colorful building next to the weed store. Enter via the black screen door. It's a tiny place that seats maybe 15-20 people, and reservations are essential. We called at 5pm (opening time) and were told they could take us if we arrived by 5:30. You get some a la cart rolls to choose from but the special deal here is the chef's 7 course tasting menu which includes sushi and mains for $50. You can choose from the Omnivore or pescatarian option. 7 courses is a lot of food, so you can share it and opt to double the sushi courses (doubling option) for an extra $30. The meal was interesting. I wouldn't say it was the best sushi we've had (we're visiting from Los Angeles where there are amazing sushi options). However, it was a good meal and I can see how the chefs were taking great care in their creations and preparing a meal we would find enjoyable. It's worth trying the tasting menu to see what the chefs are capable of. But if I were to come again, I would order the unagi roll. The unagi in the tasting menu was out of this world. It was the most tender, moist piece of eel I have ever had. The front of house/server was super friendly, helpful and attentive. We went with our kids, who enjoyed the food. While they are welcoming of my kids, putting up with their dietary preferences, I would say this place isn't really for kids because but it's such a small place that noisy kids will overwhelm the small place."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mame-eugene?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
