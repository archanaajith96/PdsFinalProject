Our waitress is very knowledgeable about the menu and answered all our questions.  Kept our water refilled and the drinks coming.  For appetizer, we ordered Som-Tum (papaya salad).  It was delicious and it came with wings.  I like mines spicy and the person i was with don't.  The waitress brought out a side of spice and pepper so i can add more spice if needed.  For the entree, we got the Red Curry and Panang.  It was delicious.  Some of the best Thai food in Tulsa.  It's very flavorful and will fill you up.Will definitely go back whenever i'm back in town."}, {"review_id": "KclcXjUZ7XLlxNkaBcY3cw", "user_id": "DHua9d47mY8l6VcPt5YDIA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Wonderful, sweet service and good food!

We went in for a later lunch today around 2 pm. The restaurant was not that busy and we were able to get a booth without having to wait. Our waitress was quick to greet us and get our order. I decided to try the Yellow Curry Fried Rice and my wife had the Pad See Yu. We both ordered ours at a 2 (out of 5) on the spicy scale. The entrees were served pretty quickly and both were amazing! Everything was really fresh and had a ton of flavor. The spice level was about right after adding a little of thier red Sriracha style sauce. We decided to try some of the Coconut Ice Cream that our waitress suggested and it also was absolutely delicious without being overly sweet.The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. The staff were all very friendly and quick. The food was great and reasonably priced. We definitely will be back!"}, {"review_id": "U_jYxQC0gAmlZwesVlweOw", "user_id": "YhTQFj8dZOl_APgWAQ4VGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/9/2017", "text": "The thing we miss the most about no longer living in Australia food-wise is the wide variety of incredible Asian cuisine we had there--visiting The Tropical made the sting of being back home hurt a little less.It's not the easiest place to find, but it is definitely worth the trip! We went on a weeknight and were quickly seated and had our drink orders taken. They have a nice variety of domestic and Asian import beers to choose from, along with wine and other cocktails.The apps were super yummy and there we lots of vegetarian options for me! I had a curry, spicy, and it did not disappoint (they take spice super seriously so be warned!)! Full of layers of flavor, not too oily, and served with lots of rice. They also didn't hold back on the tofu, which I really like as a lot of times I feel like I get very few pieces compared to what a meat dish would offer.We left with full and happy bellies and will definitely be back again!"}, {"review_id": "UNFcIr4MDtYhWyhEpYTAKg", "user_id": "JN-zGqEp3VrSXKqfTEG9jQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/21/2017", "text": "Wonderfully fresh with authentic Thai flavors. Super friendly staff and very accommodating to our large party that came at staggered times splitting the check several ways with no objections. Everything that was ordered was made to specific heat specifications, which I thought was delightful as some Thai food can be overpowering to me. The lettuce wrap appetiser, three mushroom soup and seafood salad were all amazing and highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "D6EUUT52MrScjDZMox-omw", "user_id": "HnKLC4pAONVilDhSJFzIPA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "The Tropical in Tulsa was good.

We all really enjoyed our time here! The outside of the building is a little unassuming, but it is gorgeously decorated and very well kept. The staff were incredibly kind and patient (we always take forever to decide what to order). Our drinks were kept full and the food came out in a timely manner. We tried 4 different dishes, the tropical fried rice with chicken, pad see ew with beef, their more unique fried rice with pork (whose name escapes me) complete with apple slices on top, and pad thai with tofu. Everything came out as expected and was absolutely delicious. We had a hard time choosing a favorite! The meats (and tofu) were all cooked extremely well, and the spice level we asked for (0 haha) was a true 0. The lunch specials are a great price, and we left extremely satisfied. Such a great find!"}, {"review_id": "mZu9A_42O2tenh3xLfbJEQ", "user_id": "IY7bKhLq2lG8WYZPB9jDSA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/3/2017", "text": "This is one of the only Thai restaurants in Tulsa that's open on Sunday! That is when we first tried it out, and the food was really great. They have some good Thai dishes, but in my book it isn't the best of the best Thai in Tulsa.The atmosphere is nice, and the size of the restaurant is bigger than I expected. I had an experience trying to get food to-go that took WAY longer than it should have (maybe 40 minutes or so). My experiences have been better dining in. If you're in the mood for Thai food on a Sunday, this is a good spot to try!"}, {"review_id": "r9VF9nvj-pZKqLu6j-33NA", "user_id": "TrX71WAA_Ndx92mh6od0XA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/15/2017", "text": "Thanks to Yelp for finding this place, tucked behind car dealerships I would have never stumbled upon it myself. We will definitely be back to sample other menu items, it was hard to choose. We started with the fried calamari and the chicken dumplings. Both were tasty, but a little dark for our liking as it was obvious the oil needed to be changed. I ordered the Ruby Red Cosmo and it did not disappoint, delicious cocktail! The entrees were large portioned, flavorful and the service was fantastic! Note the spice levels were not very spicy. I now know that not all 1-5 spice levels are created equal. My 1 here as opposed to another establishment was not spicy enough, so next time I will kick it up to 2."}, {"review_id": "9FzwObTAOsxZF7K7cJg0Iw", "user_id": "dntN2AhTWOJWrXgs0JfAaw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Highly recommend the tropical if you enjoy Thai food.

We showed up and the doors were locked, being a little confused because it was business hours. They had just reopened for the evening and forgot to unlock their doors. No biggie, they apologized numerous of times. We were instantly sat, and offered drinks. We ordered Edamame for our appetizer which was hot and tasty and a good size portion. Our two main entrees came out quite a bit later, but so full of flavor and they didn't go easy on the sauce. Which I greatly appreciate it. You could rate your spicy level from 1-5, and both entrees were ordered on the 4 scale. Definitely spicy and totally worth it!"}, {"review_id": "VG1a0QZTmVR4CvclUtey2A", "user_id": "QYc4F4QCd7nFUTY-mBpHTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2017", "text": "On my never ending quest for quality Thai food in Oklahoma, The Tropical is right up there. It is probably the best Thai I have had in Tulsa. The restaurant itself ooks a little odd from the outside, it's an odd looking cottage with a garden out the front. However in the back is a more traditional looking Thai restaurant. They have a good selection of Thai and local drinks and cocktails. Their Thai curries are some of the best I have ever had. Fully of diverse and complex flavors and spices. As a self-admitted spice-woos I found their medium level spice curries to be just right.I will be back here real soon!"}, {"review_id": "WpULduzSlRnwVTVBjM28zQ", "user_id": "H3uQGBao75PvWgE7tMJnpw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "The tropical is a nice restaurant and the food is not bad either.

Yum yum.  The service is quick, I've come over my lunch break and they turned us around pretty quickly.  The atmosphere would be very nice for a date night as well.  You should definitely come check out this hidden gem that's a much better place than Memorial deserves."}, {"review_id": "28cEo22raWW25lMxrCdmJg", "user_id": "GNdk3kZUehXD4-MXxuvmkw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/18/2017", "text": "While visiting the Tulsa area my family and I decided to try The Tropical. The previous night we went to El Chico which did not turn out very well. The Tropical however, did not disappoint. The appearance of the restaurant from the outside does not seem grand however inside is decorated nicely and is very comfortable. I ordered the Panang & my husband ordered the Garlic Pepper chicken. The Panang was creamy & delicious! With no added spice it's still had enough heat to satisfy. My husband fully enjoyed the Garlic Pepper which was appropriately spicy for his choice of level two. Our children split an order of the Fried rice. I can't remember the exact name, but it was the no spice fried rice with tomatoes, carrots, onion and an egg. They really enjoyed it. One plate pleasantly served 3 small children. We rounded off our meal with two orders of the coconut ice cream which was completely sublime!! The staff was very friendly and attentive. If I ever visit Tulsa again I would definitely return or recommend to others."}, {"review_id": "b9KY9wPd6la0Ni7j91nrcQ", "user_id": "oOLP8sO5psJ_arZmZbVW7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/13/2017", "text": "I finally tried this place after my fiance's roommate had kept suggesting it to us.

I am a major pad thai judger since I eat it about once a week. This is exactly how I like mine (not watery) and has a great flavor. Also the portion size was big enough to have it twice (another thing I judge pad thai on).
