It's a order and sit down food stop. Or one can take it to go to their room. At night, it's the drunk people's food line.  Definitely make sure to go when it is less crowded if one just wants to eat the food. FoodThe value for the sandwiches is delicious. Hot sandwiches for a cheap price in Vegas is hard to come by. This place hits the spot really well.  Everything that I have tried there is very good for the price. ServiceThis is mostly an order and pick up place as mentioned earlier. The service is really only when ordering and picking up with a pager. It's a good customer service while going through the ordering and picking up of food."}, {"review_id": "upGyzMOSOhyRNwu7sLX_vQ", "user_id": "_5cskuF6D4V9ipUFO6PQKQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Let me start off by saying I'm not really a sandwich person but I was hungry and most of the other options were expensive or huge portions. I just wanted something fast and filling. I had heard a lot about this place so we opted to stop by. It's nestled inside the Miracle Mile shops and has its own seating area. Mind you, there's quite a few options and all of them sounded really good. I'd say take a look at the menu while you're in line or before you step in. I opted for the Thai Chicken Wrap cause sandwiches weren't calling my name. It was a decent sized wrap and it was wrap well - in the fact that things were layered in the way where you could take a bite and get a bit of each ingredient rather than a bite with all salad then protein then sauce. All in all, this is a solid choice when in Vegas and you're trying to cut back on spending but still be full."}, {"review_id": "iNbhSolzlibbWpYaQ5LrIQ", "user_id": "_jqTa-3-fqmBxnkANJHtFw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "When two hungry people are creeping up on hangry, it's a good idea to pick a place to eat quickly. A lot of research and indecisiveness led us to this place which turned out to be awesome.I ordered the chipotle chicken avocado sandwich ($7.45), which comes with grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce & chipotle sauce. Those are some of my favorite things so to have them in a sandwich is a no brainer and it tasted very good. They have a large variety of sandwiches so I want to come back and try all of them.This place is pretty cheap, especially for Vegas standards when buffets are upward of $50.

I love that they are open 24/7 and make delicious sandwiches quickly and for pretty cheap.We were starving after a late flight into Las Vegas so decided to grab some food from this place as it was near our hotel. The staff are very efficient and they are able to get food out quickly. We got the chipotle chicken avocado ($7.50) and turkey club ($7.50). Both were really good and had nice crispy toasted bread on the outside. I especially liked the sauces, which were flavorful but not overpowering. It also felt relatively healthy, which is a plus!"}, {"review_id": "cQXMiiNBpGGwLkJU6AAtSg", "user_id": "qTcese4apYSlYZpSZyj6NA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "To MR EARL, YOUR SANDWICH ROCKS MY TASTEBUDS!!! Are you searching for food at 4am on the strip?? there sandwiches were absolutely amazing. The bread was just so good, soft and fluffy... the cheese was so silky and gooey. My recommendation is the mozzarella and tomato sandwich. I took out the tomato and added avocado for a dollar, so yummy. You can make it a combo for $3 and add chips and a drink. No exaggeration one of the best sandwiches I've ever had and I'm not saying that because it was 4am.Staff is so awesome, the night crew was so funny and corky. They also have a huge seating area ! I find it super cool that your sandwich comes wrapped in gold aluminum foil.BY THE WAY: Check your sandwich before you go back to your hotel if you don't eat it there, they left my avocado out the second time!"}, {"review_id": "6ra6CpqcWMJEKb7m62oHow", "user_id": "Iu1xzkRyR7i473KGrMRaag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "The earl of sandwich is a classic in vegas. If you are looking for a great lunch or trying to recover from the night before, the earl is always there. This is a high quality sandwich that features excellent ingredients with fresh deli meats and artisan bread. The classic is a great place to start which features roast beef and horseradish. The full Montigu is my personal favorite which has roast beef and turkey. I had their salt and vinegar chips which were not my favorite S&V chips because they lack a vinegar flavor. The tomato soup is excellent. It is creamy without tasting overly creamy and has a taste of fresh tomatoes without an added sugar flavor. I recommend getting the croutons on the side otherwise they will likely be soggy by the time that you are eating. Even if the line looks long, they will likely be able to get to you rather quickly. They are very efficient behind the counter."}, {"review_id": "op01Y_sY7EbBnzoynBFrew", "user_id": "3i48mMo0ydcfJd1-7_Iieg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "This place is a classic for me when going to Vegas!

Line to order can get long if you come during prime time. You order first and then pay at the next station. The only thing that's not so great is the parking. You have to pay for parking....

The last sandwich before we headed back home. I got  the avocado chipotle chicken sandwich and it did not disappoint at all. The size of the sandwich was big enough to satisfy anyone that's super hungry - and I was satiated with just half the sandwich. I think the sandwich was around $7-8, pretty affordable! There are only Earl's locations at LAX and Disneyland (the only ones near me) but those are already so far for just a sandwich. Luckily, Earl's is here in Las Vegas. Bonus points that the line was short and moves fast!

This place has the best sandwiches I have ever tasted. The sandwiches you can order here melt in your mouth and you get the craziest sensation of an aftertaste. There are so many sandwiches to choose from, you just can't decide what is good or not.  Don't ask yourself this, all of their sandwiches are very delicious. Their spicy tuna sandwich has a special aoili sauce that gives the tuna a kick. Their Hickory smoked BBQ sandwich is sweet and tangy. One of the best melt in your mouth sandwiches ever tasted. My favorite sandwich is the pastrami with saurkraut mixed with a special coleslaw sauce and corned beef. They drench their corned beef in a succulent dressing to give it a softer texture and taste. The service is fast and the waitresses are kind. The environment however can be noisy due to the Rockstar being across from it.  In conclusion, if you like sandwiches, this place is legendary. I will definitely recommend it and will be back again to try different sandwiches. The only Con is the loud music and being so close to the casino. The smell of smoke is just unappealing. It would be better to take your sandwich to go."}, {"review_id": "-hRpmcavsC0UDI_QsQsUcA", "user_id": "7W-p-PJlmrzg0mk3pWKoyQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "I stopped by here for dinner after spending  $50 for a lunch buffet across the street that served average food.  My wallet and I were ecstatic to see that sandwiches on average were under $8.  This location is open 24 hours and one orders and pays at the front before one's order is called out on a pager.The Full Montagu ($7.45) - This consisted of roast beef, turkey, swiss cheese, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and a mustard sauce.  A choice of white or wheat bread is available.  My buddy ordered a wheat one and I went with the white.  The sandwiches are cut into 2 and each piece appears to be about 4\".  It's not a big sandwich, but it's a fairly good tasting sandwich.  There's a decent amount of meat and the bread is soft on the outside and crispy on the inside.  For $2 more one can get a double order of meat on any sandwich.Overall I enjoyed my sandwich and the pricing is reasonable for the quantity being offered.  I'll definitely stop by when I need a quick and affordable byte to eat in the Las Vegas area.  This location is conveniently located near the entrance of the miracle mile shopping center closest to the Cosmopolitan hotel."}, {"review_id": "vSl_aU-EOM6B6EzAe2eJOQ", "user_id": "jVjuv-C8oMuD6n-MhgsMHg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/12/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Aside from being open 24/7, friendly workers and decent pricing, it's an okay option.

It paired perfectly with the sandwiches. They tasted amazing and were piping hot.Full Montagu: Roasted beef, turkey, Swiss, cheddar, lettuce, Roma tomato & mustard sauceThe Earl's Club: Turkey, bacon, Swiss, Lettuce, Tomato & sandwich sauceThe Original 1762: Roasted beef, cheddar & horseradish sauceI don't remember the full montagu having turkey in it... but that's what the internets is telling me.  It tasted great. everything worked well... you can't do much to mess up a sandwich so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯The 1762 was my favorite probably because I love anything horseradish. It wasn't super spicy... it tasted like Arby's horseradish sauce but less artificial. worked real well with the roasted beef and the cheddar. Earl's club is good, I'd eat it if someone got it for me... but of course I'd rather opt for the other two.  They all tasted like how sandwiches should taste... perfectly sauced, not overly salty... and not tasteless. Great for a quick, hot meal.
