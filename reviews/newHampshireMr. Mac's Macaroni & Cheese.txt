It was a convenient stop off the highway coming from New Hampshire. It's in a little Plaza and is a perfect take out (or super casual dine in) spot. The menu for Mac and cheese is vast and super creative. They also have beer available bottled and canned. I had the cheeseburger Mac, favorite part was the pickles! My husband had buffalo chicken. I'm sure we'll be back in to enjoy more on our future coming home adventures from New Hampshire!"}, {"review_id": "12h9xYTwKgk93TRhS-wyvw", "user_id": "bWCKqZXKgkBIFXPeEJIxYQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "such a wonderful Idea in a kinda random spot!I mean seriously who does like mac n cheese? If you don't I don't think we can be good friends. Quite literally the most comforting thing you can ingest! Mr. Macs excels in the way that they do literally nothing else BUT mac n cheese. So its a really nice, hot, warm meal thats been perfectly executed - EVERY time! Unless you are truly ravenous, stick with the small and eat in. I HAVE at a time of great hunger finished a medium to myself but I did need to be rolled out of there .. it was a sight! Its not the same when you heat it up later - though still quite good, reheated can be dry. It is not the same to say of the dishes you order that can be prepared later in your oven or toaster oven at home. They get it ready and you do the rest with a nice little instruction card. Don't think they pop in frozen pre-prepared stuff.. no way jose. The freshest ingredients go into any of their well thought out preparations or in anything you want to customize. I have been a great fan of the buffalo chicken, the carbonara and the bacon cheddar. But in my  most recent visit - I have a new found favorite - the garden veggie. WOW SOOOOOOO fresh So much lighter (if mac n cheese can be lighter) for lunch and it was MOST delightful, prepared with Provolone instead of cheddar.. dang people. I got some Mac N Cheese studyin to do - I THOUGHT i knew how to make this stuff... but clearly I have much to learn!!!"}, {"review_id": "Bk3MBy3JMgL7wScrRfd1NA", "user_id": "3_7yIXTK-0SP9rcjTdZDSA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/8/2017", "text": "This was a fabulous Yelp find when we were in need of a quick, solid dinner on our way back home. There are so many mac and cheese options on the menu that it's almost a bit overwhelming. They have everything you could possibly imagine as an option. It felt almost impossible to make a decision without having the feeling of missing out on another dish. Luckily, the menu guides you as to what size to purchase based on the amount of people eating it. After all, macaroni and cheese is the meal that slides right down. We ended up (finally) deciding on the buffalo chicken macaroni and cheese and the taco. Both were fabulous. We added bread crumbs to the top of the buffalo chicken, and it was the perfect addition. They bring the dish to your table, and your mouth thanks you."}, {"review_id": "_SUUASnY5vgWA7NxzVI__Q", "user_id": "si99SgWBLfk0WX3dZJhWlA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/26/2017", "text": "Post-shopping at the Merrimack Outlets got me building up a big appetite. Decided to drive 25 minutes to Mr. Mac's to try their famous mac & cheese. Phantom Gourmet was right - this was a destination place worth driving out of the way for.There were dozens of pre-set varieties to choose from, in sizes S, M, or L, all served sizzling hot in cast-iron skillets. There was a Specials menu (Hawaiian mac and broccoli/cheddar mac), and they also had cold mac salads. Oh, and you can create your own custom mac too.We tried the chicken parm mac and the shrimp scampi mac. I was expecting ordinary Italian pasta dishes with macaroni substitute. To my surprise, they were a harmonious blend of different cheeses and Italian herb sauces - so so good. Don't forget to request the free breadcrumb topping (-1 star for not offering). Definitely eat it fresh on-site; I ordered some take-out to bring back home and it was not as good.I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in NH. I seriously want to try all the pre-set options!"}, {"review_id": "UEgcoeq1zQnaXSxXiAsEOA", "user_id": "3eAeluZHQJ1jg42b4wqFoQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "I really don't like Mac and cheese but my husband does so we decided to go here because of the great reviews. I got the deluxe burger Mac and cheese and I LOVED IT. It was amazing. My husband really enjoy the buffalo Mac and cheese as well.

For the amount of money you pay (around $9) you don't get as much macaroni and cheese as you would at other restaurants. But if you want 'gourmet' comfort food, you'll have to pay a 'gourmet' price as well.  The pasta is served in an iron skillet that is still hot to your table. It is a beautiful sight to see the cheese bubbling before your eyes. I got the veggie mac and my friend got the bbq pork mac. The veggie mac was DELICIOUS, it everything I could dream of and more. The bbq pork on the other hand was a bit too sweet for my liking but my friend enjoyed it. For the love of mac and cheese, and all things heartwarming, this place is a must try."}, {"review_id": "iH_kY-JSdeJzrSdzWGVyPA", "user_id": "1rViFTpxzon2Y9f2rx1pPQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Excellent place to go for comfort food with a twist. Lots of versions of Mac and cheese and you can also customize. Very personable employees, very helpful. Manager was great when we moved tables for our party of nine, had us move so we weren't blocking wheelchair access but was very nice about it. We had no prob moving of course but he was just over the top friendly and nice about it. I got chicken pesto and hubby got steak bomb, both excellent. Everyone at table agreed small was probably enough but was so good we all wished we got medium!

There are over 20 basic menu options in three size categories, and with a mix of any of the ingredients they offer, the possibilities are almost limitless.We stepped up to the counter, and placed our orders with a polite, friendly young woman who asked if we were dining in, or having our orders to go. We replied that we'd be eating in, so she said that because there was a short wait for a table, she wouldn't put the order in until we were seated. Nice! She produced a number on a disk stuck to a small pole that we put on the table that opened up a few minutes later.Shortly thereafter, our extremely hot, cast iron skillets filled with, for me, a medium size order of lobster macaroni and cheese (can I get an Hallelujah!), and a small cheeseburger mac 'n' cheese for my sister arrived.They were brought with sturdy plastic forks and knives that fit with the fast-casual vibe of the place. The wonderful, cheesy, concoction in the skillet had an adequate amount of large pieces of very flavorful lobster. The cheese was clearly quality, as were all the ingredients. I tasted my sister's cheeseburger mac 'n' cheese, and that also was delicious!Overall, a very cool little place offering quality food at reasonable prices.They also recently opened a second store on Rt1 (Lafayette Road) in Portsmouth.\"SAY CHEEEEEEESE!\""}, {"review_id": "R5f29X4lnw2a_4-PVF1c4g", "user_id": "ZsTZg-R5QPCkBgyE0MyktQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/3/2017", "text": "We stopped in to Mr Mac's with a family full of picky eaters for a quick lunch on our road trip. Nearly everyone was super pleased with their choices. The choices are overwhelming and you can customize your mac n cheese and salad in so many ways, I was afraid we would never get our orders placed. Unless you just do not like mac n cheese, and really who doesn't love it, you will find something just perfect to suit your taste. We ordered to go then decided to dine in so our driver could enjoy his meal as well. The to-go containers are really nice foil pans packed in pizza boxes for extra support. Once we got our lunches we wished we had planned to share because the serving size is super generous. If we were local this would be awesome and I could order one lunch and have it for three days. The mac n cheese has a base bechamel sauce and they can add various meats, veges, additional sauces, and all kinds of cheese. I went with the special that day, the Hawaiian which had huge chunks of ham and pineapple in the pasta. I am pretty sure there was some crispy bacon and mozzarella cheese in there too. This is way better than a Hawaiian pizza. The family tried various types of veges and the most popular was adding the buffalo sauce to anything. The salads start with a base and then you can top with various additions. We ordered just the basic and it was fresh and filling on its own. The dressings taste fresh made and are plentiful. We wished we were hungry enough on our drive back home to stop again, but you really need a hearty appetite to make Mr Mac's a good lunch stop for you."}, {"review_id": "12bHYYbvUJNmCUTt9us7Aw", "user_id": "MRVJLChwjzqzRUCr72rksg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/16/2017", "text": "Wow awesome!
