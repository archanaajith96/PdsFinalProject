The brisket cut maybe a perfect 1/5 of an in thick was perfectly cooked with delicious flavor and texture. The pulled pork still had body, delicious porky flavor and was not too shredded. My husband could not resist the irresistible burnt ends. We rounded it out with spicy slaw as I needed to pace my food consumption in the two KCs and resisted the fries.All in all it was a bucket list barbecue experience.

Their website says they have the Kansas City specialty of burnt ends twice a week, Saturday and Tuesday, so we made sure to go on a Saturday. Wanting to avoid a long wait since we had limited time in town, we arrived at about 10:30 and sat in our car for a few minutes with other people who seemed to be waiting for 11 am to come. Eventually some people got the line started, and Joe's started serving us around 10:45, which was nice! You just order at a window and then pay at the register a few feet down and then your food is handed to you and you go find a seat. The food lived up to the hype, and as someone who is not a huge BBQ fan I could definitely see myself coming back here anytime I'm in town or passing through. You can get good BBQ at multiple places in KC, but my boyfriend and I agreed that the side game is part of what sets this place apart. Good variety and the ones we tried (beans, onion rings, potato salad) were all amazing. By the time we left (11:15) the line was out the door, so we were glad to have arrived early so we could move along with our day."}, {"review_id": "xyJZIxC3QnzQyiSAG49GvQ", "user_id": "54fxRJ208EllluM_yPmZCw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Came into Kansas City for a conference and all I heard was talk about how I had to go to Joe's BBQ! Thankfully it was only about 7mins away from the hotel and was able to get there by an Uber affordably. Everything about the experience of Joe's was great. When we got to the restaurant and saw it was in a gas station I had no worries because the line looped all around the inside and was still flowing out the door and down the sidewalk a good ways. Don't let the line scare you, they move incredibly fast. I realized once you get up to order your food is finished and handed to you by the time you pay making it quick and easy. I also saw where they had a call ahead order section and Togo section if you are in a big hurry. Now for the food... the menu is typical BBQ menu with a wide selection of chicken, pork, brisket, turkey, salads, sides, desserts, and more. They also had local beer on tap inside the gas station. I opted to grab an item off the kids menu the turkey BBQ sandwich since I wasn't super hungry and it came with fries and a drink for around $7 a lot cheaper than the $14 or so that I would've had to spend on another meal. Their fries are some of the best I've ever had. I also thoroughly enjoyed the hot BBQ sauce and saw where you can buy it or have it shipped to your house which I definitely may consider. The service was super friendly and incredibly fast. Joe's knows what they're doing and it's evident when you see how efficiently they run, all the recognitions they have on the way, and how the manager comes out and interacts with everyone making sure they feel welcome. If I'm ever back in the area I will definitely be returning and bringing others with me. I also will always recommend it to everyone and anyone I know who will be visiting the area. If you're looking for quality food make a stop at Joe's!"}, {"review_id": "ajoQQGZPC39OuAm4pSnmYg", "user_id": "t1sygVI_diVfeSV46lxwtw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I love BBQ ribs--and these folks have the best!  Like you, I have spent spent years eating ribs around the country and never did I know what a good Rib was until I ate at Joe's.

I usually add on 3 bones of ribs too...the ribs are tender, meaty, smoky, basically everything you want. The seasoned fries are perfect, but I can usually only eat about half an order since I stuff myself with meat. The caliber of BBQ here just can't be beat. There's a lot of amazing BBQ in KC, but Joe's is the best. Sides and sauces are also nicely done. The decor leaves a lot to be desired, as do the hard chairs, but as it's a BBQ joint, everything fits. Usually by the time you order, there's a place to sit.

The brisket and pulled were good though, don't get me wrong, I just can't get over those ribs.The baked beans were phenomenal as well. Probably the best I've ever had. The fries were great too, your typical Belgian style. I've never been a huge fan of the thick kanas city style sauce (sorry if that's offensive) but this one was pretty damn good.

A 4 hour drive from St. Louis on Valentine's Day and I treated myself to some of the best BBQ you can get. \"Best\" is not a word I throw around lightly either.Wednesday evening is when they serve burnt ends. They are ready by around 4PM (I tried to 'pre-order' but that didn't work...they told me to sit down and wait haha). I honestly thought burnt ends were the charred ends that were probably more crisp than meat. Wrong. It's more like the beef stew chunks that are bursting with juice and extremely soft. What a surprise to my naive BBQ knowledge. Damn, was I schooled.You can get a  1/2 lb of burnt ends, but I also heard amazing things about the ribs...so I did this combination of 1 meat [burnt ends] + ribs combo, with fries as my side. It's great at the counter because they're very flexible with orders. They have a separate area for to-go orders too. It was only 4PM, but there were always about 10 people eating during my time. The line was 2-3 groups deep, so not a problem at all for 4PM.I think since I also came at that time, most of the parking spots were available. There's a few spots next to the gas pumps, then if you turn the corner, there are multiple spots in front of Joe's. You can tell I'm a pro at eating at popular food places ;)I feel like I'm jumping around, but back to the food: the ribs were my favorite. I mean of the United States. Pappy's was wonderful, but Joe's had this beautiful bark on the outside, like that of jerky, but under that was the juiciest meat. I'm usually not able to clean off the bones at any time, but I was able to here. It's not \"fall off the bone,\" but it is tender enough to easily tear off when bitten. A half slav was 3 ribs + a few partial ribs. I couldn't finish it all in that first seating, but I enjoyed the food coma right after. Definitely went for a walk afterwards. I also recommend trying it first without sauce, then slathering it on. The sauce is tangy and sweet. Ugh, I think I'm drooling again. Pretty sure this has ruined ribs for me now (in the best possible way, like brisket from Franklin's).Oh, also props to the fries. They have a claim that they're the best fries in Kansas City. It's seasoned salt that they put on, which I agree, is the best way to season fries. They give you this bag that you normally put baked goods in, which puts a 'large fries' from fast food chains to shame. I took these with me to eat as a snack later. I have a weakness for kick-ass fries and Joe's nailed this as well.All in all, I'm just going to be another drop in the bucket of Joe's thousands of reviews, but now I can definitively say I've tried some of the best BBQ in the nation."}, {"review_id": "BYDwvSAqCDuKESgs8Y9n8g", "user_id": "Iz38YSWYPZXFTD4W4N_ipQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Still a bit annoyed that is no longer Oklahoma Joe's.  Although I can see the Kansas folk getting upset that the best BBQ joint in Kansas not having 'Kansas' in the title.This is the original location, and the best.  I have no idea why.  I went to the other one that has a much better layout.  Lots more space.  Ridiculously more comfortable, but for some reason does not taste as good.  This has BBQ that apparently can't be replicated.This started as, and still is, a gas station which sells BBQ.  They hollowed out the entire inside to put in a dining area, but it stays crowded.  You enter in a line that wraps around the entire restaurant and out the door.  But the line moves somewhat quickly and it is totally worth it.There is an article that had the top 20 places to eat in the world before you die, and I believe it.  Definitely something that you should try.   i was highly impressed."}, {"review_id": "Wqh8sZhfwFUU4C2BPvp87Q", "user_id": "Jaq3aXvYpBAjyoKiQwhnzw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Very tasty BBQ but the line is something else.

Get the Z-Man sandwich. Not too expensive, and basically an onion ring with delicious sweet sauce on top of some of the best meat you'll ever try. There's a reason they win all the awards in a town which is already famous for having the best BBQ in the world.My main issue with this place is the ridiculous wait times. I think they should just open up a few more registers and get that line down, because sometimes if I'm popping in and out of KC, I have to skip this amazing food just because the line is always so damn ridiculously long. But still, so worth it.I was slightly disappointed to find out that my beloved Oklahoma Joe's had turned into Joe's KC BBQ, expanding to the rich southern suburbs of KC. Sure, everybody deserves to have access to this food, but I knew it wouldn't be quite as good after expansion, and it isn't.The original gas station location is best. But the last few times I've been, I had no way of waiting. It would have been well over half an hour. A food tour hurry is no time to be standing in OJ's line.All these years later, the Z-man is amazing.However, I do remember it being more sloppy, less generic, less corporate. Inflation and expansion hasn't raised prices much, but it has decreased the originality, homemade-ness, and perfection. My first Z-man at this gas station location, was somewhat sloppy, perhaps *the* most orgasmic BBQ sandwich I'd ever tasted. Now it's still up there, but is morphing into a fast-food item, and you can taste the difference. The famous sauce is a little bit mass-produced, generic and sugary now. I'll probably try it with different sauce next time.I feel like KC sauce should be more salty than sweet. Like my... but I can't argue with this wonderful, legendary spot, so popular, and they taste so good. They as in their foods. Not them, the owners or workers. Although I'm sure a few of them do taste good. Hiiiiii.KC has the best BBQ in the whole country, a few places in TX compare, and that's it. Certainly if you are in KC, you *must* try a Z-man.So: Burnt Ends, Pulled Pork, Brisket at Arthur Bryant's, any meats at Woodyard, and this Z-man. And make sure you go to this location of Joe's KC.So all my sisters and BROSNow that I kept you on your TOESYou'll be glad you CHOSEThe Z-man at JOE'SWHAT"}, {"review_id": "iZDVZyA_FTu5oGJCtAxvjQ", "user_id": "r5b2VV4jJRw-tI6ulglxOw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "I can't believe I have not written a review yet about Oklahoma Joe's. This was the first Bbq restaurant I tried when I moved to KC 6 years ago, and I will forever called it Oklahoma Joe's.When people say barbecue in KC, Joe's is mentioned 9/10 times. It was here before Q39 ever existed. I love coming to the 47th location because of the authentic, old, rustic feel the location gives off. Probably has something to do with being connected/inside a gas station. The lines here can definitely get long (at least an hour wait during peak times), but time flies in line as you take in the smells and sights of the trophies this place has won.Now the food...do I have to save more? The briskets here are my favorite-smoked, juicy, flavorful goodness. The Z man sandwich, a combination of the briskets and fried onion ring, is to die for. The fries literally taste like they've been sprinkled by God, because I have never had fries as good as Joe's. I'm not a fan of ribs in general so can't comment on their ribs. Their other smoked meats are awesome, but they are for sure most well known for their briskets and ribs. I still try to come at least once a month, even with all the competition in the city.

Because I'm not in KC all that frequently, I decided to gorge and order the Z-Man sandwich (brisket, cheese, onion rings) and, of course, burnt ends (only available Mon/Sat lunch and Wed dinner).Story time! It was Wednesday, and I had a very late day at work (finished at around 8:30pm). Joe's closes at 9, so I decided to call in an order for pickup to not be THAT person who shows up 10 minutes till closing. They still had burnt ends - hallelujah! I drive on over, and...The line is wrapped all through the gas station. Thank goodness all I was doing is picking up the order, which I *highly* recommend, regardless of where you're staying in KC. What's amazing is that they only pack up your order when you arrive, so it's not sitting there for ages. What level of customer service!The car ride back to my hotel was torturous (the smells in my car were, for once, amazing). I pretty much ran into my room and tore into my food - the sandwich was beautifully flavorful and tender, and the burnt ends were by far the best of all that I had in KC, bar none.So, if you managed to finish reading this novella, I applaud you.
