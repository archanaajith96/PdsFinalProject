The chicken pieces were in dense cubes, the rest of the soup was fine. Overall, everything tasted good but nothing was extraordinary.

Charlie the Butcher specializes in beef on weck and their sandwich was featured in Food Network's \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" (youtube.com/watch?v=1ltw…). This is the original location and there are few other express locations in Buffalo.The staff was friendly and you can really tell this is a local favorite restaurant because there was still a lot of customers at 2 PM. Additional condiments (horseradish, mustard, etc) are on the table.***Beef on Weck - A Buffalo Tradition (Charlie's slow roasted beef, served on an old fashion kummelweck roll, kosher dill pickle and Broadway Market Horseradish - $6.99): Good meat quality with a hint of kosher salt on the roll. Nonetheless, sandwich still felt a bit underwhelming and I do wish the portion is a little bit bigger.***If you never had beef on weck, then I would still give it a shot because it is the second most popular food in Buffalo. I wouldn't say I was very disappointed, but the sandwich didn't exactly blow me away."}, {"review_id": "9Ndx7SafVSfY2rLD8b0xyw", "user_id": "tgapYbFvCjVGGRWd2jJe-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "I have been eating beef on weck since I've had teeth I think.

This was the first time as an adult that I have visited the Niagara/Buffalo area and it was a MUST eat on my foodie list. I'll tell ya what, I did not leave disappointed! The weck rolls were fresh, the beef was thin and medium rare, the au jus was flavorful, the onion rings and fries were crisp and they had root beer! I was memorized by the fella behind the counter skillfully slicing the beef to order. I could watch that all day! It is definitely a sure fire way to get your customers mouth watering and ready to chow down! I definitely recommend this beef on weck from Charlie's as a must eat if you come to Buffalo.

I was told by a colleague I must try a weck sandwich when I'm in Buffalo. I called him a fool and didn't try one until my 3rd or 4th visit to Buffalo, figuring to eat as many wings as I could while I'm up there. I wish I had listened and didn't waste my time with wings. The weck sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I'm a big bun guy, and their bun is out of this world.  Soft, not soggy, and topped with salt that just makes you savor every bite. Their main sandwiches are the beef and turkey wecks. Every day they have a special meat for a third sandwich of the day. You truly feel the love from the minute you walk in. It's a great customer experience the entire time.

With such a broad menu of beef on weck, specials, various sausages on a bun, sides, desserts, etc... it's like facing an Anderson's menu with only 3 feet of space to step back and make a decision!On my first visit, I ordered the beef on weck as well as Italian sausage on a bun and grilled asparagus.  On my second, I tried a polish sausage and a kolbassa.  You pay for your order  around the corner to find a specials board so you immediately get buyers remorse - darn, I could have had the special! (In this case, it was a prime rib platter) but it's food for thought for your next visit.Then you sit down and wait as your meal is made - it's not the fastest fast food, but I've waited for a Ted's Hot Dog so I can't complain to have a meal that's cooked to order.Portions are good.

Is it just me? Is my mind that warped?What to get: Beef On Weck sandwich.What else: Any of the meat sandwiches, Brat.Still hands down the best Beef On Weck in town. But the service often leaves something to be desired. And the prices for what is essentially a little sandwich that won't even quarter-fill-me-up, are ridiculous. And some of their specials (Chorizo ew, that's not a chrorizo) are awful. And the worst part is, when I came in and got some of their amazing Prime Rib soup ($5), I asked for a small container of gravy too. Guess how much they charged me for gravy.$5.So a little thing of gravy is the same price as the delicious Prime Rib soup. Okay, well this better bet some damn good gravy then. Except... that it was clearly store bought, thick, disgusting, vinegary, awful gravy that if I got it from a jar, I'd think it was the worst jar I'd bought. And those jars cost $1 for twice as much gravy as this.Having been utterly ripped off I have no choice but to change the rating of the best Beef On Weck in town - by a mile - to a 4 star.From the makers of \"Charlie Brown\", \"Charlie's Angel's\", \"Checkpoint Charlie\", and, er... \"Charlie The Unicorn\", comes this, a carefully sliced cut of Buffalo, served au jus with a hefty dose of authenticism we like to call \"Horseradish\".Actually, don't ignore the lone bad review, in that the portions here really, really are fairly small. BUT the more I go to CTB the more I realize this really is the ultimate Buffalo meat experience. It is unrivalled, and they have hands down the best Beef On Weck I have ever tasted. All their meat sandwiches are fantastic and their Brats are perfection.I've never seen a place with so many positive reviews! It seems like almost everyone that tries it loves it... I know I do! So do the right thing, and try this place before you try Schwabl's or some other inferior Beef On Weck and decide you don't like the dish that much. If you want a more bar-esque Beef On Weck, I've found a really good one... on Clinton near Kaisertown at a bar called \"Weichecs\". Damn good B.O.W. Or Frank's Grille in Lancaster-Depew.This is the the #1 sliced meat in Buffalo, it is definitely one of the best tasting meat places in town, and everything on their menu is delectable and delicious, if overpriced and comparatively minuscule. Don't get me wrong, in England, it would be a large portion, but this is America, land of the giants, and so the food here is fairly paltry in its relative size. But it is so. damn. good. It's too good not to try. And if you're not super hungry, one of their sandwiches might hit the spot. But I recommend you get 2, or a sandwich and a Brat, which is what I always get!Their pork stuff is great too. It's very juicy and different from the types of pork you're used to if you eat Pork Sandwiches in Philly, or if you eat Mexican Pork. But watch out for the local pork (especially the Cheektowaga pork) because they will pull you over for anything.Buffalo is an amazing food town, though, so if you come here to try wings (go to Imperial or Wise Guys on Hertel and get your wings medium, extra saucy) and this sandwich, you must also try some of our other, better gems. Check out this list, in order of amazingness:yelp.com/list/wny-top-32…But anyway, Charlie's, owned by Charlie Sheen, Charlie Chaplin, Charlie Puth, and Selena \"we don't talk anymore, we just do mouth to mouth resuscitation because I'm good with it\" Gomez, is well worth your time and money, even though they will rip you off."}, {"review_id": "aRnZTvkVLuIJdsgMmojDHQ", "user_id": "6Xru0lJGK0pGOrLcw7Lfpw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/13/2017", "text": "You can get wings anywhere, so if you're visiting Buffalo, seek out a regional specialty that's hard to find outside Western New York: beef on weck. If you're not familiar, it's a sandwich of rare roast beef on a kimmelweck roll -- which is a kaiser roll topped with caraway seeds and kosher salt. The cut side of the upper roll is dipped in au jus and it's traditionally eaten with a smear of horseradish, nothing else. No lettuce, no mayo, no tomato -- this sandwich needs none of that.A great place to sample beef on weck is at Charlie the Butcher's Kitchen. The Williamsville location is easy to get to from the Thruway and worth a detour. Don't expect fancy. You order at the counter and seat yourself in the slightly dated dining area or outside. There are other things on the menu, but the main attraction is the beef on weck.
