Unless you're starving, you have to share these entrees. They literally give you a whole trays worth of food whether it be nachos, fries, or combos. The food was very good as well! The sauce is very sweet and the food is like any other barbecue place. The burnt ends were very chewy though I found it kind of hard to eat towards the end (probably because I was getting extremely full). You DEFINITELY get your money's worth.If you make the mistake of thinking you can conquer a whole entree on your own, it's okay! They have to-go boxes and utensils in the back so you don't even have to ask. I would come back here again if I lived in CT!"}, {"review_id": "a9kOX7_lW8b0G8UhirIJ-A", "user_id": "VTfBYyQNftaZLlpAPKV3og", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "I don't know if it's just me about people rave about this place and I think it's below mediocre. The meat had absolutely no seasoning and was dry and the sauce DID NOT make it any better. So I thought I'd try their fixins/sides to see if maybe the hype was found there but absolutely not! I had such high hopes for their ma and cheese and even bread but that was a let down. I'm all about second chances but when you mess up the second time it's your second strike. I'm sorry but this place just isn't the place for \"great bbq\". Perhaps I'm spoiled with the southern touch but I've had better bbq ribs from A Chinese restaurant ‍I will say the staff is very friendly and homely so kudos to great workers"}, {"review_id": "7Rj1DtVINm9y1JKsIKbKDQ", "user_id": "f8gNFGMwiG3DP15GE1oYAw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Very disappointed....I was looking forward to a great meal at Bear's after a long day at work. I initially received good customer service at the front of the house when I went to order wings. I've never had a problem with customer service in the past, and I truly love eating here. HOWEVER, I was taken a back by the rude and poor service I received by a worker. I went to get sauce to accompany my wings and I was harshly scolded that the containers had recently been filled and that I would have to pay extra. I was also informed it took an hour and a half to fill the containers....I know it was close to closing but the attitude of the workers and customer service should still be consistent. The service seems to be going down."}, {"review_id": "oCdr0C9mOQVJBR5fRiHNSQ", "user_id": "OpX1SaY87lOslcPfqgWSdg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "The BBQ is pre cooked and ready to go.

However, there are some folks who come around to clean up tables. Even at such a peak time, it was no problem to find a seat in the cavernous dining space.The food. The important part. In short - amazing. Between the two of us we ordered a Mac Attack with Kielbasa and a plate with burnt ends, beans, and coleslaw. The only thing we didn't like is that everything seemed to be sweet. I also recommend asking for less sauce when being served meat because it hardly needs it. Both meats and all the sides were amazeballs. The beans were very hearty with a lot of meat mixed in. The coleslaw was a nice break for hot and heavy food, the mac n cheese was sharp and flavorful. The burnt ends were amazing. We also tried the moink balls which were good but nothing seemed to standout there. However, there is nothing wrong with a bacon wrapped meatball. All in all, fantastic food, nice eating space, fine service. I will certainly come back for the great smoked meats and sides."}, {"review_id": "UbBb7e7IKdLY4gmMvm4QVA", "user_id": "m2ErsvuAEkvImslUYUhx9g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Honestly I like Bear's more than the Cook & the Bear in WeHa. I think for the price and the amount of food, you get more bang for your buck. I've only visited once, whereas I've been to the cook & the bear a few times, but I was very impressed with my food (I forget what it's called but I got the thing where it's cornbread topped with mac & cheese and then finished off with a choice of meat - I picked brisket)There's plenty of seating, and you go up to order.

I felt extremely rushed even though the guy behind us said he wasn't in a rush at all. The servers were rude and not paying attention. The cashier (our receipt says her name is Cherelle R.) kept talking to a co-worker, and she even cut my husband off mid-sentence so she could talk to her co-worker. As we were signing for the receipt, she disappeared into the freezer to talk to another co-worker. Extremely unprofessional.Many of the tables were dirty, like no one cared to clean them. Mind you this was at 2pm so it was essentially empty, not like the staff was too busy or anything.Bathroom was dirty, TP all over the floor, and soap dispenser was empty. Which is kinda a big deal in a BBQ joint where people eat with their hands.The food was good, but everything else turned me off to this place.

I have had the brisket, smoked turkey, moink balls, and burnt ends.Brisket- It had a little smokey-ness in it's flavor. That said, it was a little bit dry. This place is definitely about the different sauces that they offer because I don't personally think the meat can stand alone. In my opinion, the meat being able to stand alone is a sign of amazing BBQ.Smoked Turkey- They brine it first which is a good thing, that said, I was a little overwhelmed by the saltiness and I really lost the smokiness on this meat. It was very peppery.Moink balls- This is a meatball with bacon around it. Tragically, I lost the bacon flavor. #tragicBurnt Ends - This is the part of the brisket that you hope to get. Fatty, salty, crispy, goodness. These are 90% fat, 10% meat, very delicious, and you absolutely don't NEED to eat them with sauce. In terms of sides I have had the coleslaw, the mac and cheese, the broccoli salad, and the corn bread.Coleslaw- A+ if you like vinegary coleslaw like I do! Herby, acid-y- good. Mac and cheese - Lacking flavor, basic, don't waste my time.Broccoli Salad- This has cheese, raisins, bacon, and mayo. Good, but not great. It's a little heavy on the raisins making it quite sweet, but maybe you're into that. Cornbread- Maybe a little sweet but moist! All my friends are going to make fun of me for yelping on Christmas Eve.

Word to the wise-say no to the sauce on your meal. Unless of course, you like barbeque sauce with a side of meat. That server had a Mac attack ahead of me floating in the to go box. Swear to god he put 4 ladles of sauce onto it. Sucker was drownin'. Code phrase :floating if you want the sauce. I regret not checking out the soda fountain station. They have strawberry soda. I really love strawberry soda, but sadly I'm so full I wouldn't enjoy it. Spacious seating here guarded by a grizzly bear pinata. He stands tall in the corner ready to pounce.

I've been to the location by the airport but typically go to the Hartford location. You stand in line, order you food, take your tray and pay, then sit down. This procedure is efficient so even if the line is long it moves quickly.Big open area with tables and booths. There is a separate private room and also a bar area. Prices are good with a good variety of options. My husband usually gets a 3 meat combo with burnt ends, wings and sausage. I get the garden salad and top it with brisket (you can choose from a variety of meats). Since I save carbs by having a salad, I don't feel guilty having UConn dairy bar ice cream afterwards. There is a separate section in Bears where you can order ice cream.  Our typical MO is to eat at Bears, go to a UConn game at the XL and then go back to Bears for ice cream (Bears also has a stand at the XL and at The Rent with a limited menu). I don't just limit myself to basketball season though as it is definitely worth the trip to Hartford!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/bears-smokehouse-barbecue-hartford-5?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
