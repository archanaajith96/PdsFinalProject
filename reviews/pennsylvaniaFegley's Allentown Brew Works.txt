Fegleys has great beers- the Weiss and Monkey Wrench- and tasty food. We started with the pierogies YUM. Southern chicken sandwich and cajun pasta both worth ordering again. We enjoyed Adriana as our server- she was delightful and answered a million questions. The Pots De Creme Chocolate was unbelievable. This will be a regular stop for us."}, {"review_id": "t5Edlq3EPtHf8L1CdQsTIg", "user_id": "JNqcv2-EGHwWUKtVw-31QA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "Honestly, not a huge fan.I sat at the bar when I visited here with my family and the bartender was very nice but it was very warm and cramped. I felt like I was bumping into people and I wasn't even moving. Definitely not my type of atmosphere. The wings were okay but nothing to brag about. If anything, it's convenient to come here if you're in the area as there's nothing too much better in walking distance, I'm afraid."}, {"review_id": "1Jv14HN_ge3r81bdgUhLqA", "user_id": "Th-A3NlhCWBqbTzBZ9Tc2w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/9/2017", "text": "Attended the Fegley's beer fest last weekend with a few beer obsessed friends. Well organized and spacious brew house with 5 (you heard it) floors of fun. The event only took place on the 2,3,5 floors. 2 floors of beer sampling stations plus Fegleys drafts at the bar and a whole floor of self serve style buffet foods to soak up the unlimited samples. Overall well done, although several of the Fegleys beers I wanted to taste were not available as part of the event....why they didn't have all their drafts beers for sampling even if only during the VIP hour I don't know.I don't have any need to return, but if your in the area, their mad elf is a popular sweet seasonal beer to try."}, {"review_id": "OcShCxisWEks-5gcxfcp_A", "user_id": "-y9ZiqqSVGonWkF8ImG6ew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "So after my great experience there the first time solo, a few weeks later in September we made a repeat trip for the day to Allentown. Upon my recommendation for food, the group of us ate outside in the still warm weather and basically repeated my experience 4 times over with great beers/drinks, great food and everyone needing to unbuckle the belt one or two notches. Will definitely go back there again and this time I'm bringing more people."}, {"review_id": "ew_2XYpZNmpbYn3ufZt-5g", "user_id": "WMbfjrvsbS82Hra6HmqMvw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Wanted to try a new place so decided to go for dinner on Saturday, place was surprisingly empty. Music was good, ambience was great. Server was friendly and service was fast. We were confused about beer, server helped us in picking what we actually wanted. However, the starter we ordered ( from the special menu named \"dublin lamb something\") was a disappointment. Some of the potatoes in it were raw, we asked server, she replaced it with another one, but the second time it came on table was no different than the previous. Manager was generous to remove it from our bill. The other things we ordered were good. Beer was awesome. Overall, it's a good place to hangout with friends, or for dates and for drinks ofcourse!!"}, {"review_id": "95MbVJKcUY9voZ9gOy9g4A", "user_id": "Yu_hudFZt_jt2kTiPpm14Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/3/2017", "text": "Stopped here for dinner and drinks before a concert.Great food, great brew, great service!We had a short wait, so we grabbed a drink at the bar, they use a system that texts you when you're table is ready. The bar was packed so we had to stand, but the bar tender gave us a beer list right away, and kept an eye on us, despite the fact that we were far back. At dinner, the waitress was very attentive and the food was delicious. We got a sandwich and some cheese dip with pretzel. I would 100% return if I'm ever back in Allentown."}, {"review_id": "JxvDazSgCve_GmGZV3R7Aw", "user_id": "hZx9whdbiAXjA1RMRw-AkQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/5/2017", "text": "Early dinner and beer here. Typical brewery layout and interior. Good music playing the whole time. Big plus. Staff very attentive and nice. Had the slider trio. Pulled pork, turkey sloppy Joe, and braised short rib. All of these were amazingly good. Drank space monkey. Very good micro brew. Finished with the apple crisp. Good but big for one person. Price was about $30 for sliders, salad, apple crisp, and 2 beers. Overall good place to eat."}, {"review_id": "rZAmLCwlYs29Hbcq5tjKmw", "user_id": "PgzU7MzNrdLI3xLwme1BUA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/6/2016", "text": "The stars all belong to the craft beer fest that Fegley's sponsored. I am not from Pennsylvania, therefore I had no idea what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised and will return for another craft beer event in the future. The event utilized all five floors of the building. Although there was not as much food as advertised, the selection of craft beers made up for it. Do check their events out. On that note:Restaurant side after the festival. Wish we checked out grain down the street, because Fegley's staff are rude for no reason ... which is all good because I mastered the art of rudeness a long time ago. The food: pub food took almost an hour to come out. No water glasses for the table. Their beer selection however was on point. I tried space monkey, so lovely. If you're looking for good food and service, go somewhere else. If you're looking for a great selection of beer and food to match - you found your spot."}, {"review_id": "7T3LU1cw7cKt-obOX5GN_Q", "user_id": "OriZprtD3fn9PPHIdQq6Zw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "Having only ever been to the Bethlehem location prior to this trip, I was shocked when I walked in on a Saturday evening and there was no line and the place was empty, even despite the fact that parking took a solid 15 minutes. I was glad that we were quickly seated, even with our party of 4 adults and 2 small children, in a nice dark booth. The noise level was perfect for our noisy girls and the staff did not seem to annoyed at the fact that they wanted to roam. The table, however, was not very forgiving of the fact that we had drinks, food, and still needed room for the obvious coloring place mats. I ordered the fish and chips, mostly because I was craving tartar sauce, but I was a little bummed that the meal lacked the flavor I was hoping for. Our hummus appetizer was good, but the olive tapenade was the real show stealer. Unfortunately, the pita they give you is barely enough for even one of the hummus options, so we asked for a side of bread so we could continue to enjoy our app without looking like cavemen by eating it off of a spoon. Overall, the service was great, but the food was not something to write home about."}, {"review_id": "pJBDVifKg4bxgz8yhjocaw", "user_id": "tO2LtoiXyA-AH0usdPezMg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2017", "text": "Went on a Saturday night. Was shocked to see 2 police men acting as bouncers but Flattered to get carded lol. Food was great! They have a good selection of vegetarian options which I was happy about. The portions were large and easily shareable. One of the people in our party of 6, his order was forgotten and he was not charged and given a free dessert as well. Our sever Matt was super attentive, attractive and funny. Very kind and went above and beyond for us. As for the beer I can't comment as I don't drink but a few in our party were highly pleased.

We opted to sit at the bar though there were plenty of tables available on a holiday weekend.The bartender greeted us immediately, and helped guide us through the beer selections to make our flight.We were able to try all of their flagships, as well as their seasonal pumpkin and a few other specialties. Now, while my beer tastes tend to shy away from the 'typical things women are expected to like' I did love their Blueberry Belch. I'm also a sucker for anything blueberry, so there's that. My husband very much enjoyed their Devious Imperial Pumpkin. I'm usually not a fan of yam beers, but this one did have a nice after taste. If yam beers are your jam, try it.One warning I'll give is about the actual bar top. Don't be surprised if your phone starts to go bonkers when you set it down. It's because of the lights underneath.All in all, we had a really good experience.
