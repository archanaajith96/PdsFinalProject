While I love their selection of bitters and they have a few cocktail concoctions I enjoy, I find the price point a bit steep. The bar area is smallish and it gets really loud with only a few people in there. Perhaps it's just the acoustics. The popcorn is really good too, but sadly costs a small fortune. I do, however, find a lot of fun and easy-to-ship Christmas gifts on the retail side every year. Again, a bit pricey, but they have an amazing selection of local bitters. Also, they often have these infusion packets that come with easy instructions that are perfect for mailing in a padded envelope or popping into a stocking. I've never used them myself, but I've been told they are simple to use and delicious."}, {"review_id": "6fMAlTXqZCxwC2QgJ7sh8g", "user_id": "Gryw4ErAwlNpkxjX1g8Gwg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/24/2017", "text": "You don't find too many cocktail bars like this around.

These are some of the most unique cocktails in Portland that I've seen yet. The owner is very knowledgeable in his craft and is enthusiastic. Inside is a well stocked and very cool gift shop if you want to make your own drinks at home or buy gifts. Cons: I have a hard time paying $12-15 dollars for a small cocktail that I can devour in a few sips. It's too expensive for my taste. It's always too crowded for me inside and the wait to get a drink is often too long than I'm willing to wait. I want to buy everything in the gift shop but it is expensive so I rarely buy anything. Vena's is located in the Old Port, so like everywhere else down there, parking is a nightmare."}, {"review_id": "sK2YMKwM9Jp0xh797PdqHw", "user_id": "yCzlWb4byNJjYmlMVtZRdg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Batender was great! Educates  las he pours. I like that in a place that serves specialty drinks. My first drink was delicious. Cherry something?!? (Forgive me).

Seriously, when my boyfriend and I ordered ours (after looking through 3 pages) we realized that there were like, 5 more pages of cocktails! They seriously hook you up with options!!This isn't a bar you'll want to get hammered at, considering children are allowed there and the other half of the place is for respected shopping. By the way, their shopping piece is amazing.. They provide all the different materials to become your own personal home-bartender! Seriously you gotta check out the shop before leaving this joint.

Cocktail and mocktail bar...for all ages! Everything on the menu is pretty unique and fun- it almost looks like an apothecary inside instead of a bar. There are bottles of bitters all over, and different stirring and shaking devices. All the glasses are pretty and unique too. We love the metal straws- super environmentally friendly. My husband had two whiskey cocktails and I had my favorite St Germain cocktail. Fun vibes. Popcorn and pretzels available too.

The only reason I came in to Vena's was because a friend was a bartender here and boy am I glad I came.Vena's is such a cute location with a little shop to buy some of their stuff and some sporadic seating throughout and then the bar and some tables in the bar vicinity.Their drink menu is extensive and has something for everyone. Although I can admit that the prices are fairly steep, they were 100% worth it. All of the staff was very knowledgeable about what they were making and were able to explain and answer any questions in regards to the menu.Each staff member that had some availability created some casual conversation with us and made sure we had everything we need.

Vena's has an extensive menu filled with various cocktails and non-alcoholic drinks with someone for everyone. The staff are incredibly knowledgeable about the bitters they use in their drinks, and the owner is friendly and often introduces himself personally to ensure your experience is great. Some cocktail highlights are the G&T and the Maine Margarita. Amazing! Their menu also offers some small plates of things to munch on. The one thing that keeps me from giving Vena's a full five stars is the pricing. Expect to put down at the very least $25 for two drinks. Definitely a place to check out!"}, {"review_id": "iBy_xWTw6MbdBB98LcaUWw", "user_id": "hlperdEEqsvLHU5KIFudzw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/2/2017", "text": "If you're looking for something different to try while visiting Portland, this might be a great option. If you search \"speakeasy\" in Yelp, this is listed which adds a sense of adventure to the evening! To be honest, we thought Vena's was closed as we approached it on a late August summer night. Peering into the windows, there were no patrons or activity visible but a girl with pizza walked by us and in, saying come on in! The first two small rooms are unique retail areas showcasing shelves of various tinctures, bitters and unique \" bartender\" must haves. In addition, there was antique antique glassware for sale . Another room offered a few high tops amid more display shelves and finally the small bar area. We chose a corner hightop near the window so we could watch the bartender do his thing! The menu is large with detailed listing of ingredients most of which I've never heard of! There is one waitress, very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. We chose a lemon and blood orange option, the later a nonalcoholic listing that they added vodka to! Both were served in vintage glassware and the best part.... a bent metal straw!!!! Drink options with alcohol aren't cheap but you're paying in part for a unique experience as well as a \"show\",  watching the bartender concoct his offerings! If you love a bar with an entertaining, knowledgeable bartender who loves his craft, this is a great place as you watch him pipette small amounts of flavoring agents  in the form of tinctures and bitters into complicated drink mixtures, happily discussing their origins or essences. My choice, the blood orange was unique and while not the best adult beverage I've ever tried, the Vena\"s experience was well worth the stop!"}, {"review_id": "f1I4H_S5_WIp8VHuoiyHLw", "user_id": "3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/13/2016", "text": "Vena's Fizz House was my favorite stop in Portland. It's the epitome of the kind of unique place I look for when I'm visiting a new town. The atmosphere and drinks were both out of this world.The Fizz House's main bar area is upstairs and the main floor has a shop of drinking goodies. The shop has every bitter, syrup, shrub, bar tool, and gift item related to making drinks that you can imagine. It was a great place for me to start stocking up on Christmas gifts for friends and family. The bar has a cute old-time feel that creates the perfect ambiance to settle in for a few drinks. Seating options include several tables with booths and seats as well as bar seating. It's cozy without being too cramped.The menu is impressive, offering fizzes, mocktails, and cocktails. It was hard to choose just one item so we settled in for awhile and enjoyed several drinks each. We went for fizzes and mocktails. Every drink was really good with unique flavors in each.  Our favorites were the Cremes and the Prickly Pear-Tini. All of the flavors really popped and made for refreshing drinks."}, {"review_id": "lAhg7t1tuGS1tCA_gElBXA", "user_id": "aTpsRtqpiJTaCSrKuiyTwQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Great spot.
