My father brought me back here and they never disappoint. It's a small hole.in the wall and if you don't go at the right time you could be waiting for a table, but let me tell you it's worth the wait. They menu is so simple that everything they make is cooked with fresh and proper ingredients. I had a stuffed Chicken dish that was out of this world, and you can never go wrong with their fresh pastas they offer. Definitely come check this place out on a slower week day to get a table, and try their Fusili. Thanks for coming back Dom and the Family!!!Vanacore Family."}, {"review_id": "wkZBphfXhGmo_k0uvk_I3Q", "user_id": "4CZRxkvHZHgAuGXkBz8r7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "I love lasagna more than Garfield - and once I read other reviews here we decided to give this place a try. We had the fried calamari as an appetizer - it was fresh and the batter was very light and crispy. My husband had the chicken parm- which I tasted, of course - and it was so amazingly tender. I had the lasagna bolognese with extra cheese ( I specifically asked for super cheesy because that's how I roll) and it was sublime. It was not too heavy / dense -surprisingly light- but meaty -cheesy and really really good. Quaint atmosphere, nice friendly service- you can tell it's a family business.Highly recommend!"}, {"review_id": "Q03Gw2pvobMMNN4qnlWVxw", "user_id": "DhhPLFd-bLf2NaC8Fvc7dw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "There was something so magical about walking back into La Riviera (now Aurora Ristorante) and seeing the old crew back in business! All of the magic and spirit that had started to disappear leading up to the restaurant closing was completely back. New, amazing specials on the board, new decorations around the room, and it was finally PACKED again! Don't get me wrong, the food was never bad, but something did go missing at some point.My husband and I went all out to celebrate the return- stuffed artichokes (SO glad it's back!), riceballs (absolutely amazing), lamb osso bucco, and orechiette with shrimp and mushrooms. Can't wait to come back regularly and try all of the new specials!"}, {"review_id": "bEMyD76O6PA2n5XJ7kWIQA", "user_id": "SZUQgLuLqHfdmS9vWWW95w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "My favorite restaurant has returned.

I was not impressed with this place. This place is BYOB and very quiet. We came here with our 3 months old son and the whole night I was afraid he might throw a crying fit and people would be looking at us since it was so quiet but thank goodness he behaved lol. This is definitely a restaurant for adults. We ordered their special Thai calamari and that was a bit too greasy and sweet for me. For entrees I ordered the tagliatelle bolognesse and I thought that tasted very average. The pasta was overcooked and on the soggy and soft aide and the meat sauce was just ok. My husband ordered the manicotti which was stuffed with spinach and ricotta. I thought that was just average as well. Service was good. Our older waitress was cute and attentive and took good care of all the customers in the restaurant. Overall, nothing mesmerizing or wowed me. Don't think I would return again"}, {"review_id": "G8b9cjgc4qPxTXHGe5DF0w", "user_id": "-5ewQwoFnkMuwhF9aMxRNw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Ordered large take out yesterday and so happy to confirm - this place is excellent, as it was before.

It is definitely not your typical take out spot but it is offered along with sit in. The restaurant itself is relatively small, but it is cute and the service is exceptional. I placed my take out order over the phone. Upon arriving to the restaurant I was greeted and taken care of immediately. The service is honestly great and the food is really good. I ordered the cheese manicotti w/ vodka sauce. The manicotti was a bit cheesy, but it was delicious. The Vodka sauce is creamy and by far one of the best vodka sauces I have had. The lunch came with bread and a small salad. I will definitely go back and I would recommend it as well!"}, {"review_id": "kAtoOKCxmRksPXSrolIG7w", "user_id": "U_8JA8_GzxgZAfot8snc_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "There is nothing else to say than Amazing!!

I recently got take out from the new Aurora Ristorante (previously La Riviera Gastronomia & just Gastronomia). My family & I have been coming here for 10 years so when they closed for a few months we were very upset. So we decided to try out Aurora and see if it was the same(since we were told it was) but let me tell you it was not. The food was absolutely horrible. Almost inedible... According to an employee I was going to be blown away & notice the difference of the new Aurora food & trust me I noticed the difference... horrible. Chicken was so dry & had zero sauce even though it was suppose to be a saucy chicken Marsala. Penne vodka was more like penne & red sauce, no cheese or cream in the sauce. Whatever they are doing, they are not doing it right. I will not be coming back to this place ever!"}, {"review_id": "vSecXo1lijuLvMGBvvQ1XA", "user_id": "jwhw-_uVmyWze2_b6g-rjQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/18/2016", "text": "Yelp has done it again! This place is absolutely perfect. It's a tiny little hole in the wall but it's the most authentic Italian home cooking you will find around. In this area you find Italian on every corner but few places stand out as AMAZING. This is one of themWe started with soup. I got the tortellini en brodo. Light with a great Parmesan flavor. Mom got the lasagna & I got the meatball special -2 meatballs with fresh ricotta. Get the meatballs if you can. It was heavenly. My husband got the chicken parm.  He loved it!  At the end of the meal they brought us fresh baked lemon biscotti. The biscotti was only baked once and was like a pound cake almost. Out of this world!! You MUST go to this restaurant!! Best meal I promise!"}, {"review_id": "aVQK_9t49xWNWTwwSdrGnA", "user_id": "mZDrYEiua2Zr3KvtAXtI3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/5/2017", "text": "I know there are a lot of options when it comes to Italian food in Jersey, but this has to be in the top five.  This place is BYOB so if you walk into the Riviera with a bar, you are in the wrong place.  This is a small restaurant with about 10-12 tables and three pictures on the walls.  This is really a no frills restaurant and there is nothing wrong with that.First they bring out complimentary bruschetta and warm homemade bread.  I don't eat tomatoes, but this bruschetta was out of this world.  There was so much flavor in such a small bite, even if you don't eat tomatoes you should give it a try. There is only one waiter working the room and boy does he know his stuff.  He listed off four different amazing sounding specials, and then told us what his personal favorite dishes were.  Luckily for me one of his favorite dishes as orecchiette all nonna.  The second he finished describing this dish I knew that I had to order it.  The rest of the group ordered veal marsala, shrimp francese and the chicken murphy.  When looking this place up on yelp I saw a lot of photos of the chicken murphy, but none of them really do it justice.  When they brought that plate out and the amazing smell hit you, just WOW! Everything was absolutely delicious and authentic.  I tried some of the marsala sauce and it was by far the best sauce I have ever had.  The shrimp was just as delicious covered in the amazing homemade sauce.  As for my dish, I couldn't stop moaning.  Every bite was better than the last and I am so glad I have leftovers.  I tried the chicken murphy and even the description doesn't even begin to explain it.  The amount of flavor in that dish is outstanding.  I loved how thin and crisp the potatoes were as well as the thinly cut delicious sausage.  Before our meal we started with the burrata and mozzarella with roasted peppers.  Both were outstanding and I highly recommend ordering one if not both of them.  The flavors or the peppers and the balsamic on the burrata were so mouthwateringly delicious.  Unfortunately when it came time for dessert they were out of canolis and tiramisu.  Instead we ordered the tratufo and ricotta cheesecake.  Just WOW! The dessert was just as delicious as the meal.  I had never had ricotta cheesecake and I think I like it better than traditional. In my opinion, if you want a delicious authentic Italian dinner, this is the place for you,"}, {"review_id": "px10Ey5OXkczWlsbDKmCuw", "user_id": "gdqgLHF4UDCiofh-I2Ax_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/5/2017", "text": "If I could give this place 10 stars I would.

The food? Amazing. We had two of their specials because they just sounded amazing and tasted even better! Thai calamari and manicotti stuffed with ricotta and spinach in vodka sauce DELICIOUS. We also ordered the chicken franchese and it was hands down the best I've ever had. VERY inexpensive, too! Authentic, great Italian food for cheap and a friendly staff? What more could you ask for!!! Definitely would recommend this place and 100% returning to this place for more dinner date nights!

The restaurant is rather small, but you're there for the food, right?We usually order fried calamari and meatballs for appetizers. The calamari tasted fresh and not gummy. The marinara sauce for dipping is great as well. The meatballs here are MY favorite, bar none. I think they're made w/ pork, veal, and beef. They're very juicy, meaty and full of flavors. They're served w/ marinara sauce and ricotta cheese. For the main course, I'd def recommend the chicken Murphy! Plenty of chicken breast, potatoes, peppers served w/ a light balsamic sauce. This easily serves 2 ppl. Also, the lasagna bolognese and manicotti are amazing!  All in all, love this place!
