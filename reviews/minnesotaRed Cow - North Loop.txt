Best burger I've ever had.The restaurant is visually appealing, red booths with wood tables. From the moment you walk in you feel welcomed. The staff is friendly and the waiter we had was exceptional.We started with an appetizer of cheese curds. Those were delicious-the breading was great, not too crispy just right. I had the double decker burger (forgot the name - but the menu states it had won local awards). Delicious. The saut√©ed onions and the special sauce (which had a hint of horse radish) was delicious. Burger was juicy and not dry. Even the Home made pickles that came with the burger were good. So good, we asked for more. One thing I appreciate during my meal is assorted condiments for dipping fries. At any given time there were at least 4 different kinds of dipping sauces-special ketchup, assorted mustards, all home made.I would strongly recommend if you're in town stop by, you won't be disappointed!"}, {"review_id": "FbNmQgnHmJrp_idW-ohuUg", "user_id": "eXnK9DW3hv4iVBoXgz3WUg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "This is a great place with a good crowd for Sunday brunch. There is an entire BOOK volume 3 dedicated to craft cocktails, wine, beer, mimosas, etc. I had Chilaquiles and the barbacoa was very flavorful but I so wish I had had the double barrel burger...my own game time decision but when I saw that come out afterwards, it looked incredibly tasty. My friend had the Parisian, it seemed small but is described as being a lighter fare (one egg, a couple strips of bacon, and one piece of French toast with berries - she was delighted! I would go back for certain and the rumor I heard is they may expand to Colorado, which would be welcome by me!"}, {"review_id": "ZkN-0UTqq9aUU4UsCnUJUg", "user_id": "U11uwbLlIfR7uKuYRa0wZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "I'd been to the Uptown location before, which was wonderful, but after perfect food and service tonight I'll drop my five stars at their North Loop spot.My friend and I arrived at 5 (Saturday night) when the wait was just starting- we only waited five minutes, however if I were waiting longer I would have really appreciated that they text you when your table is ready. We were seated at a high top next to the bar which was perfect for watching the game. I love when hostess takes the time to explain drink specials and the menus- we knew we were in for great service from the start.As a culinary student and aspiring chef, the best part of this place for me is the wide array of inspired burger toppings. With cheeses like brie, manchego, fontina, and gruyere, sauces like smoked pepper aioli, tomato jam, cherry red wine reduction, and apricot rosemary black pepper jam, meats like bacon confit, pork belly, prosciutto, and root beer pulled pork, and veggies like arugula, piquillo pepper, truffled shallots, and merlot mushrooms; any culinarian would be impressed. These are truly gourmet burgers. Last time I had the Blues Burger which was absolutely fantastic but this is not the place to order the same burger every time. I had such a hard time choosing that I had our server, Roberto decide between the Manhattan and the Royale for me. He shares my love of brie cheese which is on the Royale but recommended the pretzel bun from the Manhattan, so we went with the Royale sub pretzel bun. The patty was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The flavor combination of the tender pork belly, nutty brie, peppery arugula, and sweet tomato jam was an absolute flavor bomb. The bun substitution was a lovely recommendation albeit a little pricey at $1.50. However, the $2 upcharge for a specialty salad side (I got the heirloom wedge- YUM) was very reasonable and highly recommended, given the fact that this is the same price people pay for a side salad with only lettuce, tomato, and carrots at most other joints. My plate exceeded the $16 I spent on it in quality. My friend ordered the Cowboy which he really enjoyed, it had great sweet and smokey action going on. It was absolutely massive with three jumbo onion rings. He had fries as his side, which were clearly hand cut, nicely seasoned and crispy.The beer selection is amazing, featuring several beers they brew themselves. My friend ordered a Farm Girl which I ended up enjoying more than he did. So good! And only $4 during happy hour. I skipped happy hour because the Hurricane sounded so good. It was $12, and while it was worth the price in its sheer strength, it wasn't balanced for me. I'll stick with the Farm Girl next time.Roberto was kind, chill, and thoughtful. He anticipated anything we could have possibly needed- a real professional. A manager swung by at the right time (as we were just realizing we're ready for a to go box) to ask how everything was. We had nothing but compliments of the service and food to offer. The only thing we had that was close to a problem was finding parking. But our experience was well worth that 5 minute fiasco.I highly recommend this small local chain to anyone seeking a truly gourmet burger! Even the veggie patty sounded good, with curried chickpeas as the base. There's something for everyone here. Can't wait to return to try their baked brie and a new decadent burger!"}, {"review_id": "5MUtak0K4b4CguYDvxrM7A", "user_id": "YkDKDbtj1BRaZ6KYOgv9dw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Red Cow was great. It is located in North Loop, and it can sometimes be hard to find parking near by but there is always a spot somewhere that opens up!

It looked so good I ate it all before I even could take a picture! The fries here were equally as great. Red Cow is definitely the place to come if you want a great burger!The inside of the restaurant was absolutely adorable. It's red toned and has Cow prints, super cute.

They said they would text us when the table is ready. We waited by the bar and got a couple of beers. I could tell the locals knew to wait around the bar to snatch up the first couple of seats that opened up. We weren't in a hurry so we just waited on the side and watch the Minnetonka hockey game on the big screens while enjoying our beers. A server walked by and offered us some complimentary popcorn! It was absolutely delicious. It tasted of syrup and bacon bits. We got the text that our table was ready about 40 minutes later. Right on schedule. Our server was really kind. Made a lot of suggestions as to what we should order. And I even asked her where a liquor store is nearby that we could pick up some drinks before heading home. She went to do some research and we were then greeted by the manager who gave us a printed list of liquor stores in the area. We could have definitely done the research ourselves but it was incredible that they went above and beyond to print out the list and tell us of some local favorites. We got the cheese curds out first. So good. They're like little mozzarella sticks but small. I didn't care for the berry ketchup sauce that came with it too much because I don't like sweets. I would have preferred an aioli or something savory in that nature. The burgers came out next. My boyfriend and I split our burgers and gave each other half. I really loved his Cowboy Burger. I don't usually like bbq sauce on my burgers but their sauce was delicious. And the patty was cooked perfectly. So flavorful. The Barcelona was really good! I only had a bite of it before I was too full to eat anymore. Not going to lie, I felt like the prosciutto was really really salty. I know prosciutto is like that but I needed something to balance it. Maybe some greens. We also had sides of french fries and onion rings. Onion rings were cooked perfectly. I would suggest those over the french fries because the fries were good but nothing special! The onion rings are added with a small upcharhe though. All in all, I was blown away by the service. The people who worked there are the reason why I loved it so much. The bill came out to $56.51 after tax and I tipped our server 20%.Thank you for sharing that Minnesota culture with us on our first night in town, Red Cow! Your team should be so proud of the welcoming environment they have created."}, {"review_id": "aetH1CJtm_Gq1yLF4POWgA", "user_id": "OFH7VPA6CVoRclvSG7zBkw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "I came here a few nights ago on a date.

But I'm back for those juicy, soft boiled Scotch Eggs for a very late breakfast. The other night when my beau and I were here, we both went with a beer flight, split one of the burgers ...and the scotch eggs. Everything we ate was SO good! They even brought out our split burger on separate plates, perfectly arranged. This morning, I was set on just Scotch Eggs. And coffee. And then I looked at the menu. Dang it. In addition, I ended up ordering a Red Velvet pancake and a Cool as a Cucumber sparkling water/juice concoction and a side of bacon!! I'm sure I look like a pig with all this food on the tablet...and there is only me! But I couldn't resist! And they do have to go boxes...On another note- the staff was really great for both outings.

We stopped in for a quick lunch before flying out of Minnesota per a local friends recommendation.

I ordered the Moscow Mule upon our waiters recommendation, which had pink peppercorn ginger beer made in house. Great drink with a little kick. The BF ordered the Cold Brew and Tonic, very unique I will say, but odd. I had a sip but wasn't a fan, and I don't believe he was either. Glad we tried it though.For food we ordered the Ahi Tuna Crisps, and wow amazing flavor! I would order those every time if I could. We also ordered the jerky, but our waiter forget so we didn't bother. For entree, we split the Tennessee Hot Chicken with french fries. The kitchen was nice enough to separate it into two plates before bringing it out. Delicious, even tastier than than one chain who makes spicy chicken sandwiches I will admit.

From what I witnessed they all busted their butts to make the customer experience great, so shove it. Drinks: Holy moly Bloody Mary. Soooooooo good. It had a well rounded kick and acidity level. They even had cholula at my request. A delicious IPA was served as a chaser with it. Food: THOSE CHEESE CURDS THO. Every, single, day. I would eat those cheese curds and regret it while not regretting it. Love that triple berry sauce. Give me that sweet...wait I'll stop, no more cheese curd talk I have to talk about the rest of the food.
