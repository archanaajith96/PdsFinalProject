The live music is a nice touch but feels very out of place because of the way the floor is set up.My waiter was M.I.A. after I ordered and I thought he legitimately forgot about me after serving my pizza.The pizza was pretty good: blue corn crust and fresh ingredients were used. I got the Area 51 and loved it. My main complaint about the pizza was that the green chile was not spicy at all and you could barely even taste it.Overall it was a fun spot I just wish I could've had refills of my water more promptly or at all without having to go up to the bar."}, {"review_id": "3qQKsZTROmAmKWfb8ARWXw", "user_id": "P7Pf0G238qRgk5zDsT_4qg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Can't believe that I haven't written a review about this local gem that we have frequented more times than I can count! THIS is the place to be on Thursday nights, when the pizzas are being flipped, the drinks are poured quickly, and the music is poppin'! Let me tell you: The Chris Raven Band that plays every Thursday night is phenomenal. We already LOVE the food, people, and ambiance, and this band is the icing on the best cake in town. The pizza! Oh man, so good. Made fresh, and if you'd like to sit up at the bar, it can be made right in front of you! Our favorite is the Hawaii 505, sub pepperoni for ham, add (FREE) green chile. Yep, you heard me, FREE, on anything you'd like. Tell me that that is not LEGIT New Mexican right there. Our second favorite: pesto chicken tied with the gyro pizza. SO good! Now, you don't want pizza? That's okay, order the Zozobra Salad... oh my gosh. Perfection. I don't like salad, seriously, but I order this EVERY time. The service is phenomenal, they have a rewards program--sign up now, and they have live music every day. But seriously, your first time, go in on a Thursday, listen to Chris, have a pint of one of their MANY local beers or even a glass of local wine. You will love it and you'll be back."}, {"review_id": "pmNfETdDPabNG-Ev8DqfFA", "user_id": "G_KpCd1f1piMRq47zoEgbw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "This place is a good family friendly resteraunt.

I prefer a thin layer of sauce to allow for the toppings to shine. I think the pizza master and I are on the same page!We also ordered the \"Meatless Monday\" a wonderful white garlic sauce was the base for this pizza. Artichokes, zucchini, spinach and red onion topped the base deliciously. On to the crust. We ordered the thin crust and were very pleased with the thin, crunchy, charred in places, results of wood fired baking of the pizza"}, {"review_id": "-4TeSlNzxbWmKi_UODBP_Q", "user_id": "APx20b9etKLY0HDovgSrMA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/27/2017", "text": "The Blue Grasshopper is the dream of my friend Peter Apers. He wanted to create a community room where friends could meet for conversation, good pizza, good beer, and good music. He and his partner have really hit the target. The pizzas are baked in a wood-fired oven at a very high temperature and come out perfectly every time. The  thin crust is firm and never siggy, and the dough is slightly sweet. My fave is the Area 51. OMG! Pete is a guitar builder, and some of his instruments grace the wall behind the bar. The live music is, in many cases, excellent. Pete has been known to sit n on the drums occasionally.  This is a comfortable room.

The place was packed.But better than that, Blue Grasshopper was fun, friendly, local, great service, good food, and great music. Yes great music. There was a local band there. They took the stage and I thought omg can I get out of here. Glad I didn't leave. They were amazing. The Chris Ravin Group, nailed it! They added to the atmosphere. They are playing songs from the past and let me say that I thought Glen Frey was back! I was impressed. Plus it turns out that it was Ravin's bday and a customer by the name of Olivia and there was birthday cake that they shared with everyone. I didn't have the cake, and it does not matter if was good or bad. They took the status of local to a new level. GREAT JOB!!!Getting back to the food, I had their version of a BLT )and you are thinking how could they screw that up) places have, they have not and it was ....I will definitely order it again.

Go here if you like thin crust, well done pizza. This is a nice little spot for that pizza as well as trying some local beers. They have a great selection. The night we went there was live acoustic music provided an older gent. He had a fabulous voice. He was followed after a set by a duo of older gents. They were good too, but we were on our Friday night beer tour and had to move on.Blue Grasshopper has two locations, the other one is actually closer to home for me, so I'll be stoping in there next. I was actually craving that pizza this morning! If you like pizza and beer, stop in. They have salads and sandwiches, too. It's a friendly neighborhood feeling brewpub worth your visit.One last thing to add, and this is true for many brewpubs and breweries, please offer small size glasses (4-6 oz). I love beer. I'd gladly pay the price of your 12 and 16, as that's what many ONLY offer. But I'd rather taste a few different brews but like to be safe out on the street. Smaller offers please?!?"}, {"review_id": "ins2xJi_yyWQaQsTnhK7oQ", "user_id": "dtbQ9Y2AD9E1UYCc2hnSZg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "8/23/2017", "text": "After reading reviews I was looking forward to the pizza and beer selection. Upon arrival I asked for the beer menu, but as in many places I was directed to the chalkboard. The only problem is the beer they have don't have the brewery they are from so unless you know, you have to ask for each one. Really???And the second faux pas was when I ordered a Margherita pizza and it was served with NO BASIL, I asked and the server said they were out and I explained that it's not a Margherita pizza with out basil, it's a cheese pizza with tomatoes! He said the kitchen didn't tell him until it was ready. The server also knew before serving me but waited until I asked to tell me, bad move!I was offered another pizza, and heard the server ask the kitchen to go across the street for some basil. But in this case, it is a little too little and a little too late. Beer selection when you know what they are is good, and the atmosphere was nice but I will not be returning anytime soon."}, {"review_id": "w-4Diz4YJZKLQbxT2WcLOw", "user_id": "xTf0L-BbQQ97NLciDuC4DQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "I have visited this location many times.

We could barely hear the live singer. He was mostly background noise as the customers outside were quite lively.  The view of the Sandias at dusk was spectacular. The waitress  was very good at checking on us even though the place was packed.They have a wonderful taproom, with 33 mostly local beers on tap including selections from La Cumbre, Santa Fe Brewing, Ponderosa, Nexus, Boxing Bear, Abbey, Turtle Mountain, Red Door, Sierra Blanca, and Bosque  Brewing.  They also have three beers that they brew at Blue Grasshopper.  We ordered a stout, porter, brown ale and a black IPA.  They do sell growlers, and we ordered one of the Sierra Blanca brown ale since it was so good.  We ordered the Greg's Special  pizza and it was good, but not great.  I think the toppings could have been a bit more  generous.Overall, this place would be a great place to go enjoy the Sandias and drink a beer (or two) on a less busy day."}, {"review_id": "qYkRmFad6Eon-bLDvYXC6g", "user_id": "jflJnidl1iicxSxkHwLYiQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "7/15/2017", "text": "The only reason it's 3 stars is the food and beer is good.

I went to this restaurant called: Cazuela's (on Sara Rd and Coors Blvd) a few nights back that had great reviews for there stone-fired pizzas, but it was a nightmare upon tasting it, and the female Mgr was awful and extremely rude when I said that I didn't like it...anyhow :) Fast forward to today, and the cravings wldnt stop, so I did another search for really great pizza in the area, and, The Blue Grasshopper popped up. Upon reading multiple reviews and looking at the evidence, I decided to place an order for the Meat Lovers 13\" pie. I called and a female answered who sounded extremely irritated and came across very rude. I requested that the pizza have mozzarella cheese, as the menu says (even on here) that you choose between mozzarella or provolone, she was snappy and rude, and said, that it only comes w/ mozzarella...when I pointed out that on the menu it says something different, she just said ok w/ major attitude and it continued for the duration of placing my order.The pizza...it looked great (***see photo***) as I asked for it to be well done. I know that the wood-fired pizzas are supposed to have a little char on the outer edges/crust, but there were a few slices that had extremely burnt crust that was inedible. The lady told me to arrive within 20 mins, but I arrived in under and the pizza was done, however, it was just warm and not piping hot. The taste was awesome, but I know had it been hotter it wldve been over-the-top fab...nonetheless, it was a good pie, but not great - to my taste. Even w/ the extreme, inedible char and less than perfect temp, had it not been for the lack in customer service from the rude young lady, the place wldve been given a shaky 4-star rating for the pizza alone. The toppings were great, cheese was boss and the sauce...really good! And the atmosphere seemed very chill and laid back - perfect for a casual date night or a chill w/ friends."}, {"review_id": "B8XLadcIhRXWCKb5SL8wcg", "user_id": "IfML58SgxBKJUfIkY5TMpw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/24/2017", "text": "The best pizza  in Albuquerque!
