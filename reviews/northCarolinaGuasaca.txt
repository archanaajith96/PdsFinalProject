I've been meaning to try this place so when I saw them on groupon it was a no brainer. I stopped by and ordered 1 pork arepa and 1 chicken arepa with chips & Guasaca. I loved the pork arepa, so good! I wasn't sure about the beans in it but I ended up liking them. The chicken was good too! I liked the mustard sauce but didn't have a chance to try the cilantro sauce. The Guasaca is like guacamole but slightly different in taste and ingredients. I liked it! It almost had a sweet note to it - like they added mango juice or something. I ended up ordering more food than I could eat. I'd say if you tend to eat smaller portions, one arepa will fill you up. Next time I'll order one!"}, {"review_id": "gCqRliVX62Ugs-vu_LCi5w", "user_id": "ro_KA0Ics7XAr4Q6Ocvzfg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Wife and I stopped in for a bite after Art Museum visit.

The shredded beef was also good.  My recommendation is to try the tilapia.We ordered a side of chips and what appeared to be a thicker guacamole.  It was solid.  They offered a nice outdoor sitting area on a busy street.For the price I don't think you can go wrong for a little Venezuelan food."}, {"review_id": "k1kc9jiqCzAYJVbF6k-lwQ", "user_id": "NHdz19zsxDsql0z4ulFQow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Best cheap lunch around!All of the arepas are very flavorful - I especially love their mustard sauce.  I usually go at lunch, and though there is a long line, it goes very fast.  The arepas are so soft and warm and pair perfectly with all of the delicious fillings.I also love getting their chips and guasaca on the side -- the guasaca is like a chunky guacamole that is so fresh.  I usually go and get one arepa and chips and guasaca.  Sometimes two, because I'm hungry and they are delicious and cheap."}, {"review_id": "0FQxQ13aIiLqdoaP5X3cyg", "user_id": "1Bw_gAkqOSCW0NzHnWhMvg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Check groupon for discount price. This place is in a strip mall, with not much of parking. The place is nice and has back garden patio. The food is good and pretty decent size, one arepa is good two will be a bit much, about five dollars a piece. The chicken arepa was delicious, the carne and fish were ok. I like their spicy sauce I definitely can taste the habanero chili in it. The Guasaca sauce is just a thicker variation of guacamole, it's good eaten with their corn chips. I've been here before and the taste is still the same. The workers are typical fast food joint workers, fast and efficient.

I got the mechada arepa with spicy red sauce (good amount of heat) and chips with what I thought was Guasaca sauce but turned out to be guac (guac was also really good). The arepa looks small but is actually really filling and full of flavor. Good enough to come back for. The not so good: ordering is stress. Definitely know what you want ahead of time, best of luck if you come unprepared. And unfortunately the guac looks really similar to the Guasaca sauce so make sure you get the right thing. My girlfriend got the Guasaca sauce which I ended up not liking so I was fine they screwed the order up. The parking at this location is also chaotic so be prepared for that too."}, {"review_id": "S8j3h7P5szeg6Q3beWMFyw", "user_id": "sg6wlC4SOSL94E2U0tJ7Xg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "I'm in the minority here.

It's fairly inexpensive, tasty, interesting to eat and it looks and tastes fresh. I often get the chicken signature arepas (pictured). Signature means you want everything as it comes - without changes. They also have a location on Chapel Hill Road in Morrisville and Durham too. The signature chicken arepa comes with tomatoes, chicken, beans, cheese and cilantro sauce. Chips and guasaca (a version of guacamole) on the side are a great addition. Tip: Bring a scarf and warm clothes in winter - it's a pretty cold environment. During the summer - wear sunscreen and sit outside. Honest, to me, arepas signal spring and summer- light and lots of cilantro!"}, {"review_id": "xc642qkvvfQnojtZx_7Q8g", "user_id": "Sqrk_TVaHendVeytj9dI3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Truly delicious, reasonably priced food.

Guasaca is magnificent! Raleigh has grown significantly. I'm impressed with the growth of this city. Occasionally, I visit to see my parents and a few friends. With the help of my good friends, I'm able to locate the best restaurants in the city. I couldn't wait to visit Guasaca!! With eight-hundred and thirty-one reviews on Yelp, this place is on FIRE! My friend suggested I purchase and download the Groupon online ( $5 for $10 Worth of food). The Food:My first time trying Venezuelan cuisine! There's only one thing to order on the menu....drumroll! Arepa's!!!!! The best thing I've ever eaten, no joke! Priced between $4.10 and $4.70 you can't go wrong. I selected two signature items, one Chicken Avacado on a corn tortilla and the pork on a flour tortilla. The chicken avocado was my favorite! I choose the corn tortilla to try something a little different. This was made fresh! A little sweet with a crunchy texture! AMAZING!! Ingredients included oven roasted chicken and avocado all mixed together in a house sauce. The Pork arepa comes shredded with black eyes peas, pico de gallo, white cheese and cilantro sauce! I would suggest getting extra sauce because it's that good! My two favorites are the cilantro sauce and the mustard sauce---I would put this on everything! Guasaca should consider bottling this stuff! Overall this restaurant is clean and well staffed. They move quickly! I was here for two hours, the foot traffic was never still. Thank you Guasaca for such a great experience, I hope this business continues to thrive in the RDU area!"}, {"review_id": "HmuWMIBfZhxDEPs3S7iOLg", "user_id": "JTgrfHWboGJEjNkNAWQWTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Guasaca is a simple idea: fresh ingredients, authentic cuisine, quality product. For a fast-food, Chipotle-esque model, I certainly expected that the food would be mediocre, but boy was I in for a surprise. I ordered tilapia on the white arepa, with black beans, plantains, and pico de gallo along with the signature guasaca sauce (an avocado spread with chunky vegetables), and was taken aback that each ingredient made it's self known on my palate. The arepa was perfect texture and tasted as authentic as I remember in South America. The tilapia was very well seasoned, with no fishiness about it. The plantains had just the right amount of subtle sweetness. And the black beans and pico harmonized so well that I just couldn't have enough. You'd think a small arepa sandwich wouldn't be filling, but it was actually just the perfect portion and only for $4.70. All the arepa sandwich options were around the same price range. Double that for bowls or salad options. Man am I excited that Raleigh has such an exciting concept to offer and wish I could bring it back with me to Michigan. Will definitely be back again to try other options, sauces, ingredients, bowls, and salads!! Can not rave enough about this place. Blown away.Pro tip: If you like avocados, pay the up-charge and get the guasaca sauce. You will not regret it!"}, {"review_id": "6gYdGMWzYWBlaE_awyLLjw", "user_id": "WJOjqOmrM2jJxwrlqHIK9w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/16/2017", "text": "Oh man, this place is change-yo-pants good. Yelp, you guys have not let me down. I didn't even know what a arepa is (according to Wikipedia, arepa is a type of food typically from Venezuela and Colomade of ground maize dough or cooked flour prominent in the cuisine of Colombia and Venezuela. I think of it as a Jamaican patty, with more options ha.There's several ways to order here. The setup is typical to fast-casual -- you go through an assembly line of options and ingredients, pay, and munch. Choose between any of the signature fixed toppings/ingredients arepas or build your own arepa, bowl or a salad.I ordered the signature:* Steak -- grilled steak, black-eyed peas, caramelized onions, white cheese & cilantro sauce * Tilapia -- braised tilapia, baked plantains (cut into small little cubes), caramelized onions, white cheese & cilantro Sauce* Grilled chicken -- grilled chicken, black beans, pico, white cheese & cilantro sauceIf you decide to go cowboy and make your own, you have quite a few proteins to choose from:Grilled ChickenShredded BeefGrilled SteakBraised PorkBraised TilapiaAvocado ChickenToppings include:Brown RiceWhite RiceLettuceSour creamWhite cheeseGuasaca -- similar to guacamoleAll of the arepas come with a solo cup of cilantra sauce, but I also tried the asian sweet n' spicy and the super hot sauce. Overall, absolutely delicious, great toppings and options, and from the three arepas, I only paid $12, which isn't too bad. And yes, I destroyed em all.BATHROOM REVIEW: Located near the front entrance, the men's bathroom is a single-person bathroom. It consisted of a super duper clean toilet, that when you flush, can suck up any thing you throw/poop at it. The sink and everything was just so clean. Sit or squat?

The arepas themselves are hot and fresh and they are tasty. We ordered a chicken and avocado arepa with cheese and were extremely disappointed with the way they were stuffed, compared to the way a traditional arepa is supposed to be filled, the filling was laughable and sad, it was not filled at all, let alone over stuffed like it is supposed to be. One arepa is supposed to be more than enough but we were both still hungry afterwards which is disappointing. The flavors were good, but the roasted chicken texture was very strange and not very enjoyable. I also ordered a build your own arepa thinking there would be more filling, but there wasn't. I ordered a black bean, plantain and steak arepa with cheese. The flavors were great but the portions were laughable again. I chose the cilantro garlic sauce and could literally drink it with a straw. It's delicious. Overall, the flavors are very good but they are stingy with the portions and they shouldn't be for the price."}, {"review_id": "JMys5eUj3J1lqVMpJjLIOg", "user_id": "aotAs0qpPephPZz_QSqmtA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Guasacas is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Raleigh. It's like a Chipotle but with a Venezuelan flair which just means it's bursting with flavor. You start by picking a base (rice bowl, salad bowl, or the traditional arepa), then the meat and then finally the toppings. The meats are seasoned perfectly and for those of you who lean more to the vegetarian side, there's a tilapia option as well! I usually opt for the tilapia salad bowl which is delicious- my favorite being the plantain topping. My fiancé always gets the chicken and pork arepas and I always sneak a bite into his because the topping sauce is superb and because those tortilla/pita pocket things are chewy and add an extra element of yumminess to each bite. If you're short on time but don't want to sacrifice taste for time, go to Guasacas! Even if the line looks long, it moves rather quickly. You can even choose to order online and pick it up at your convenience, skipping the line altogether."}, {"review_id": "X2hhd0Bazd6d-_3R_u1ttw", "user_id": "M48VUqiK4cx3YGyHscC1bw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "We decided to have lunch on a weekend and found the food style was similar to chipotle.

They serve plain rice,beans/black eyed peas, Guasaca ( resembles guacamole) ,plantains, other toppings like cheese, salsas, cilantro sauce, mustard sauce, etc.. so basically you get a whole bowl of everything.

It's basically a fast food place like Chipotle that actually has some delicious food. The main attraction of Guasaca is arepas, and they are absolutely delicious! The yellow corn one is slightly sweeter than the white one, but both of them are a great base to make your very own arepa!My favorites are the caramelized onions and the plantains. The plantains add a bit of sweetness to the arepa, but they also add a great texture that hold everything together. And the cilantro sauce - woaw! I hate cilantro and refuse to have it as a garnish, part of the dish, flavoring, or whatever it is that people like to put cilantro in. But this particular sauce? Absolutely delicious. I just heap on the cilantro sauce and nom nom nom my way through it.Pro tip: If you're taking the arepa to go, it's better to get the bowl and get an arepa on the side. Otherwise, the arepa gets soaked through with the juices from the meat and toppings, and soggy arepas are no fun!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/guasaca-raleigh?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
