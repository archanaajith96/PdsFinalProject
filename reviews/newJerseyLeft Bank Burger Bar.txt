The day before, we were told by another coworker how Left Bank had, in her opinion, the best burgers in Jersey City. Needless to say, she wasn't far off.The truck had a sizable line in front of it, but the guy on the truck was quick to take orders. My coworker ordered the Bankrupt Burger (their classic cheeseburger), whereas I had the Garden State (black bean veggie burger). Both came with fries and cost $11 ($12 including a bottled water). Not a bad deal.My coworker LOVED her Bankrupt Burger, specifically for its Bank Sauce (an elevated version of Mac Sauce) and thought the fries were perfectly seasoned and didn't require your standard blast of Heinz. As for me, I'm not normally a veggie burger girl, but this burger was rich, flavorful and packed with yummy condiments. I almost forgot that I was having a veggie burger. Almost. As for the fries, my coworker was spot-on; good seasoning and no ketchup required.Will definitely be coming back to LB's truck, and will need to hit up the restaurant location soon!"}, {"review_id": "AgcHgAtAL97pJHAVOazN4g", "user_id": "061LABLyATjh5jEpPDOSSA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "So I've been really wanting to try this place and I finally got to check it out. Came on a Friday night 20 min wait for a table of 2, that was actually ready in prob less than 10 min which was great. Vibes in the place are awesome. Employees are friendly and welcoming. Dj was playing some music but it wasn't too loud, you could actually have a conversation. Drinks were fairly cheap, they have a ton of beer/shot combo specials as well as drafts, bottles, cans and mixed drinks. Overall menu prices were also on the less expensive side which was actually a surprise. $10-$15 for a specialty burger, doesn't include fries which is unfortunately the norm at most places now. Ok so far so good. Good music, great service, cheap drinks. Then the food comes out. Meh. I got the Mac daddy burger and was not impressed. Burger was kinda dry and lacking flavor. Cajun fries tasted kinda burnt and the Cajun seasoning wasn't really much of anything. Overall I'd come back for the atmosphere and the drinks but the burgers definitely disappoint."}, {"review_id": "vBMcOebe2xvSLIajgexDQg", "user_id": "kSGcDOfPeUCU_nLmkiABng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "This place is so consistent. Overall, Left Bank has the burger experience nailed down from the quality of the food to the service. Its super popular so recommend calling ahead especially on the weekends; not too sure if they do resies. They have a fun drink selection with shot and beer pairings, ranging from $6-$10, which are great deals. They have a bunch of killer signature combos for fries and burgers, with the option of building your own burger as well. You could also add fries, onion rings, veggies or a salad for $2.75 on top of your burger. The fries and onion rings here are fantastic, the onion rings especially are top-notch, with perfect crispiness and texture. Their house-specific items are tasty too, such as the house blend patties and the bank sauce. Overall, have been here multiple times already and will be frequenting more in the future. Leftbank is a Grade A establishment and I'm always impressed."}, {"review_id": "JnkKsFzSCNvJIer-eV43nw", "user_id": "IGl2xslL30l5LorXydI-nA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Food: Mac daddy burger was good I need to go back to try more burgers and if you love buddy Mary this is the place to go and have their ultimate buddy Mary.BBQ wings I wasn't too much of a fan of but that I haven't had many to compare it to.

They have been going to this place for a few years now. After hearing them rant and rave about it for so long, I finally had a chance to tag along with them and find out what the big fuss on this place really is about. Parking is a little bit of a pain but that is literally the only downside. I had high expectations for this place and I can say that this place has exceeded those expectations. They have truly masted the art of making the perfect gourmet burger. They have a decent craft beer, wine bottle and cocktail selection. Service was quick even with an almost packed house. I decided to create my own burger, and I wanted to do it up big since I didn't know the next time I would return- house blend burger with lettuce, tomato, runny egg, pepper jack cheese, avocado, bacon, caramelized onions, garlic mayo with a side of sweet potato fries. It had to be one of the best burgers I have ever had. As big as it was I finished every last bite. I was full halfway through but couldn't stop eating it because it was that damn good! The sweet potato fries were also quite delicious. If you are a fan of burgers, I highly suggest putting this place on your list and trying it out. You will not regret it!!"}, {"review_id": "eEJefsLy0R3WCF6YuWcexw", "user_id": "xbVAw4LICyDC28LAO7xHlg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "This place is awesome!

I've been here a few times before, haven't been in awhile. I came back when the place first opened and loved it. I was super excited for a burger place like this to open on Jersey City. Unfortunately, I feel like I set my standards too high and it's gotten progressively worse each time I've came. This time we got two orders of wings for the table, and I ordered the challenger burger (can't remember the name) which had bacon, and pork rinds on it. The wings were pretty good, nice and crispy. The burger was just alright. In my opinion, at a \"burger bar\" the best part of everyone's meal should be the burger, not anything else, or the wings in this scenario. The burger was just bland. It was cooked well but as a challenger burger I was expecting more. I'm not saying I wouldn't come back, because I'm sure I will, but honestly, you could probably get the same quality, if not better burger, from a place like Five Guys, for a cheaper price."}, {"review_id": "mT0GtIH92KJF311TgSIb_g", "user_id": "isilLts_tupKm4-pN2FAFQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/25/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Nice small place specializing in burgers.

That's a mighty fine burger! First time here. Nice relaxed atmosphere with some good local brews on draft and cans (including Carton 077-XX). There are two small TVs at the bar.I ordered the The Truffle Shuffle ($14), a luxurious brisket patty topped with herb roasted pork belly, parmesan tater tots, gruyere cheese and truffle aioli. It was juicy af. That truffle aioli is creamy and holds its' own against the flavorful meat, serving as a magnificent sidekick. Aside from the meat star headliners, the bread vessel is an under-the-radar top performer. When you take a bite, the sandwich doesn't fall apart and the bread all the various ingredients together.Great burgers, nice atmosphere.

I've come here twice now, once for happy hour and once for lunch. Food is excellent, but service and atmosphere dings Left Bank one star. LB's combination of consistently closed blinds and decorations makes me feel like I'm in the food court section of a Dave and Buster's. I usually don't care too much about ambience and tend to notice it in a positive, not negative, but something about this LB stands out in a not too good fashion.Anyway, onto the food, which is more important. The disco fries are fantastic! It's a huge size, so if you get them, share with a friend or two. They came out piping hot and perfectly crispy, despite the gravy and mozz. I've also tried the Mac Daddy burger with a side of sweet potato fries. The burger came with fried mac n cheese, garlic aioli sauce, thick cut bacon, and tomato. I'm a huge sucker for garlic aioli and bacon and burgers so there really was no chance that I wouldn't absolutely love this burger, but damn was this burger tasty. What a genius creation! Everything separately was delicious, so you can imagine how good everything was together.The service is not bad, but a little slow. I've had to make multiple attempts to get the attention of our server at some points while the restaurant was not packed at all. Not a huge deal, but I think if it we had been there when it was very busy, we would probably have been waiting for a much longer time. Nevertheless, the negatives of Left Bank will not be enough to keep me away. I will definitely be returning for those burgers, and would highly recommend anyone who likes burgers to try this place."}, {"review_id": "a6KFDsAv-ENCpS0I-LVR1Q", "user_id": "hMDkd6t7cCNOFttKZ5H0Fw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Great Servive kid friendlyGreat beer selectionHomemade French friesBurger was cooked just right"}, {"review_id": "_yTy6UdLZOF6INTLHgULCQ", "user_id": "yc0aA1bOnH0NIYL_ZWKwjw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "This is a real burger.

You won't be disappointed ! I will be ordering tomorrow! Thank You! I wish I could give 10000 STARS!
