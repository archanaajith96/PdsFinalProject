Although, we had to wait about 15 minutes, the host made sure we got in as soon as possible. As we entered, all the chef's in back actually stop working and greeted us very loud and cheerfully.Then our waiter Roy came over giving us his expert recommendation for their signature dishes. He was very attentative and made sure our tea and water glasses were always full.We started off with the specials nigiri Chu Toro and Golden Eye Snapper. Then the Seared Wagyu Beef Tataki, Hamachi Kama, Aona Garlic Itame Salad, and Golden Eye Snapper Fish base miso. I gotta say every item surpass my expectations by miles. I never had a fish based miso with huge chunks of the fish.We topped it off with dessert Green Tea Terrine and Hiyashi Shiratama Zenzai with Vanilla Ice Cream and fresh fruits.An incredible dining experience, highly recommended."}, {"review_id": "YSfjXtySSEdZBKVdCObKWA", "user_id": "PN_TA5PO9WI7LZjUNFS1YQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "This was a last minute dinner choice.

I think I can only eat that once a year! ‍ Wagyu is so fatty but so rich and high quality!! Yum!Next was the Aona Garlic Itame; Garlic Butter Veggies - Choy Sum with mushroom medley. Great sauce! Chef suggested the Fish base miso and boy was it interestingly good! A piece of the fish body with fins added a great texture.I also ordered my go-to Fav; Hamachi Kama!! Love cooked fish! The Kama was excellent with ponzu sauce of course. For Dessert, Hubby chose the Special; Green Tea Terrine; Green Tea brownie.

My fav. was the unagi(eel) and crab cake? I've never experience unagi like this before. You can taste how flavourful it is and they grilled it with charcoal which you can taste and tell.Struggling to describe it so just try it! The crab cake was very good as well but a tad bit too much oil.Sashimi was good. The ama abi took a while to have the head fried. During our time there a lot of the tables ordered their shooters.

Since my husband and I would have to finish eating dinner at a decent time to pick up my daughter from the in-laws I had no time scoring reservations at 5:30 PM and got to park in the back lot that was nearly empty.I had done a lot of research on yelp about what dishes to order but upon sitting at the sushi bar I got so excited by all the fresh looking fish that we ended up asking for the omakase option. And all I can say is... wow! I've had a problem in Hawaii with finding sushi that was fresh, perfectly seasoned (a.k.a. no shoyu needed) AND small (one pop in your mouth and perfect proportions between fish and rice), but at Sushi Izakaya Gaku they had all my criteria. I was in sushi heaven.So with all that being said - why the two stars? Because I had ten nigiri sushi in two hours. And remember, as mentioned above, these were small pieces of sushi. Ten small bites in my mouth of sushi. We received the first six sushi in the first hour. Then we were asked if we were done. When we said no, we had the next four... provided in about 15 minute intervals to finish off that last hour. By this point, worried about how long it would take to get even one more piece, we called it a night and headed home. Home to cold leftovers from the fridge after spending over $300 on dinner (and sake). Now for our last 45 minutes in the restaurant the place was packed, but the previous hour plus it was pretty empty as when we walked in there was no one else at the sushi bar and only one other party in the entire restaurant.I was on the fence between 2-stars or 3-stars because I really was excited and enjoyed the tiny morsels of food that I had. But 3-stars to me means I'd give it another shot, and I just can't fathom giving this place another try to leave again with a hefty bill and still hungry."}, {"review_id": "WkljTXPyPXQJhtqnSZl1cQ", "user_id": "xQ6Vc9YHh6JU2JltPZcEiA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/12/2017", "text": "If you want to impress your date with some amazing izakaya style Japanese food, Sushi Izakaya Gaku is the best place to go. This place is extremely popular so definitely call ahead for a reservation. Fortunately, I just called one day early and was able to secure a couple of seats at the sushi counter. I actually really like sitting at the sushi counter because the sushi chefs can recommend things to you and also they prepare things for other people and you can see what they are making and if you like what you see then just order it! I strongly recommend their sushi platter and rolls. I also love their oysters. Of course, their tempura is made to order so that's an additional favorite. The restaurant has limited private parking directly behind the restaurant in a small lot. There is street parking available after 6 pm. Just be sure to check the signs.

Very traditional Japanese cuisine served at the finest quality. All the chefs speak Japanese much more fluently than English so you know it's legit.

Must order: Spicy Yellowtail Tartare - Served minced in a bowl and dry seaweed. Don't be fooled, this seemingly small bowl can feed a table of 3-4 as an appetizer.Uni Shooters - Just awesome. Packs a punch of uni flavor. Liquid goldLive Abalone - Very fresh with a side sauce that is equally delectableAnkimo - Very soft and creamy. Unlike the other cheap, pre-packaged stuffAll of their sushi/sashimi list is delicious. It is not the same level of low level sushi you find at cheap joints, where they just slap the store bought fight onto some rice that taste over a day old. Each bite has depth and balanced flavors and above all else, extremely fresh. You taste each sushi fish without being overpowered by a sauce. The entire mouth feel of each bite of sushi is balanced and leaves a smile after chewing. Don't forget your hot sake! Such an awesome restaurant.

I celebrated my birthday here before and loved it. Now that I eat a plant-based diet, I usually stick to very simple sushi at sushi places. What a fantastic sushi chef and server that I had at the sushi bar on my most recent visit! With my server's recommendation, I got two off menu veggie rolls along with several other items that I ordered. I was able to confirm which items were dashi and dairy free. The first veggie roll was amazing. I love shiso leaf and the sushi roll was made inside out and wrapped with layers of shiso leaves and filled with takuan, ume, sesame seed, yamaimo, and more shiso leaves. The second veggie roll featured grilled shiitake mushrooms and fresh avocado made inside out and coated lightly with sesame seeds. Both rolls were so good. Very clean tasting with no fishy or strange flavors that I have experienced at other restaurants.Along with the veggie rolls, I had kabocha karaage (fried kabocha), pickled eggplant nigiri, and a natto roll. My meal was complete with yummy desserts that I chose. I got the homemade yuzu sorbet and zenzai mochi. The sorbet was so fresh and refreshing! The zenzai mochi was really good and great if you like mochi and azuki beans like I do."}, {"review_id": "kq6x87X8MevP9ALpf85kGQ", "user_id": "B1N1QjKFL5cPTODHBAkCCg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/6/2017", "text": "I couldn't decide where I wanted to go for our anniversary dinner until the night before.
