Atmosphere is warm, rustic, and intimate; lighting is dim. Hip, but not hipster-y (at least in any obnoxious or unwelcoming kind of way). The folks behind the bar are a lot of fun to talk to. The food is both hearty and complex. We had the granola stout beer cheese soup (which was every bit as wild as it sounds) and the pork ragu with egg noodles and goat cheese, which were both delicious."}, {"review_id": "GdOmEfHAbOltLZYcsUjIIg", "user_id": "ojiN3u-8CVBPBisohY9_5Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Came to this cheese heaven on a Saturday night with my boyfriend and a few friends and we were seated right away in a booth in the back room. The restaurant has a very cozy intimate vibe -- dimly lit, perfect for a date. Let me start by saying that for the most part, the food itself tasted great. We ordered the cream of broccoli soup, Mac and cheese, and gnocchi. The gnocchi was divine -- the cauliflower were basking in the delicious cheese sauce, and added a nice contrast in terms of texture. All 3 items were delicious really, but the portion size on the gnocchi was a little ridiculous. Or they could've just used a smaller bowl...not really sure what happened here. One of my friends (hi Muhammad!) ordered the steak frites...I feel obligated to discuss it for his sake. He ordered it medium. What arrived at our table was 100% medium rare. He tried to eat it, but felt uncomfortable and asked our waitress to cook it a bit longer. Second try: still medium rare. Looked like it did the first time.But all this aside...I think what really tanked the experience was our waitress. I don't really know how to describe her to be honest...she seemed entirely disinterested in us being there. When we asked questions about the food, she would just stare at us, making us ramble on instead of just addressing the question. With the whole steak fiasco, she made us feel like it was an inconvenience to take the steak back and didn't acknowledge that it was ridiculously undercooked...like bish what??? This is not a matter of opinion! It's either medium or it's not! She just gave off a clueless, too cool to care, \"I'd rather be in Portland\" type vibe. I've been here before and had a better experience, so I was a bit disappointed with how things went this time.Overall, food 4/5, service 2/5, vibe 5/5."}, {"review_id": "AaiA3y9Su4UmRONz0RVJdA", "user_id": "OHS9w17ejao_P4m89Y63hQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "From their charcuterie boards to their Mac and cheese to their massive grilled cheese, it's perfect for the cheese lover.

The ambience and service make it a very cozy place to dine. I've gone with a large group before and we were able to sit in the cheese shop area. Not sure if this is something they do on a regular basis. This is also one of the few places around that serves poutine. As a Canadian, I've missed poutine since moving to New Haven. Although not as good as places in Canada, Caseous does a decent job. They also run a cheese truck that serves grilled cheese (although no where near the size of the one at the restaurant)."}, {"review_id": "NaXav4N13qeHgJl6jdDACQ", "user_id": "wZPizeBxMAyOSl0M0zuCjg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/2/2017", "text": "I came here on a double date on a weekend evening.

I even loved picking off the burnt cheese off the skillet. The cheese burger was underwhelming and could have used more cheese, and the poutine was ok.

Between the three of us, we ordered a starter bowl of their vegetable soup, which was a squash base today, along with a cheese board, a burger, the mac and cheese, and the poutine. My favorites were the cheese board and the soup. The poutine was really overwhelmingly wet and the cheese's were a bit mild to me for producing enough flavor. I like my poutine to be a bit of a happy mush, but this was maybe a bit too mushy, but my boyfriend LOVES the poutine, so my opinion is sharply balanced with his. His burger was good from the sample I stole, but my soup stole the show. It was very thick, clearly with a good puree base and the flavors were so comfortingly warm. Of course, from a cheese shop, the cheese board was great. Through the entire meal, the service was great and very friendly/helpful.Prices are moderate, on the higher end for a lunch, but everything is very high quality so it's to be expected. Afterwards, we stopped into the cheese shop again and once more found that experience delightful. They are so helpful there and give ample samples to help find the proper one. I ended up purchasing a cheddar that was like the Flory's Truckle I liked last time so much. I loved eating here for lunch, but the shop portion still might be my favorite of the two. Either way, stop in."}, {"review_id": "7uBOcywcK2ilJ3Zkxsot9g", "user_id": "4TF3h3_tTqfWruxLZgTlrA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/13/2017", "text": "I've been here now a couple times.

By the time we got our table at 8:30p, they were out of many items on the menu already. We were there late and the staff was trying to close up but never did we feel they were rushing us or being rude. Friendly!

The cheese is definitely stand out here, but the other offerings are not overshadowed. The restaurant is very small (there's both an outside and inside section) so be sure to make a reservation. The staff here are knowledgeable about their offerings; she explained a lot about the different cheese and meats and where they came from.+CHEESE & CHARCUTERIE BOARD: Each board comes with 4 types of cheese and meats. The cheese options varied between milky, creamy, and sharper flavors. The meats were also quite delicious (loved the mousse!). The boards also came with almonds, jam, mustard, and different toasted and untoasted types of bread, such as onion baguette and flax seed. We were a little unsure about the toasted and untoasted, with some of them being super crunchy and soft. To be honest, I liked this! +BEET SALAD: This was surprisingly good. Was definitely my favorite dish of the night. It was tasty and beautiful, with orange, pink, and red beets. The burrata was also delicious, and the dish had some nice crunchy bits. We chose to get it with the guanciale which added some nice meatiness and varying texture to it. They're chewy and fatty and absolutely decadent.+ANSON MILLS CORNBREAD: Marrow butter! This dish is on the heavy side but it is absolutely delicious. I love how rich and buttery the entire dish is. There's also cheese on the bottom and since it's on a cast iron, it stays all melty and delicious.The food here is amazing, but we were sad to be too full to try their dessert (potted creme especially). I was also happy to find out that they have a cheese shop which I will be visiting soon! All in all, a great place for dinner and I look forward to coming back for their other offerings."}, {"review_id": "6URFWvNRM-HtgjdgSJwnEA", "user_id": "er5J_9AgLOIJmDjFZLXF6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "Love this place. Let me start by saying if you have never been here before and don't know what to expect, I can tell you. The location is odd in that you can easily drive by and not know it is there. It is a very small place but it feels comfortable and intimate. If you try and go there without a reservation you may only be able to get a bar seat- which are limited- or you may be entirely out of luck. Once inside you feel like you are part of the in-crowd. You are in this small space with cheese snobs (in a good way) and you are about to have one of the best meals you have ever eaten. Get ready to start an addiction. The servers are attentive, even when busy, which they usually are. They have a small menu with daily specials. But the go to item are the grilled cheese, mac and cheese or the cheeseburger. My husband had never been there so I encouraged him to get the mac and cheese while i got the grilled cheese. The mac and cheese is decadent and smooth and buttery- it's everything you want in an entree. It is tangy and salty and has amazing texture. The grilled cheese- OMG! The bread is soft inside but crusty and buttery on the outside. The cheese oozes with each bite and if you dip it in the mustard that comes on the plate, it takes it to a whole other level. Once you do it, I fear you can never go back to any other grilled cheese- it just won't impress. On a side note, Our server never brought our fries and when asked he went to the kitchen and came back to apologize, admitting he forgot. I liked that. He didn't BS us, he took responsibility and we were glad to have his service. All in all it is a fantastic place. Great food, nice atmosphere, consistent quality."}, {"review_id": "O87-YyNsVnsJpeQVXDxWWA", "user_id": "Mw9jklpJ-fM-7CP3u9XHMQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "If you're looking for a truly decadent meal, the Mac n Cheese with bacon lardons here will hit the spot. With four kinds of cheese, tender and fatty bacon bits, and a nice crust formed by the breadcrumbs, this meal is the definition of \"elevated\" comfort food. The ambiance here is nice as well -- it's a little removed from the sounds of downtown, the outside patio has heat lamps that work really well, and the decor in general is rustic and comfy. The servers are helpful and nice, even when we went at a relatively busy time. Unfortunately the cheese shop was closed when we went for dinner, but I've heard great things about that as well. The only negative about the place may be the somewhat steep prices, but considering the high quality of the cheese in the dishes, they're tolerable."}, {"review_id": "yS6pLD101LVPahvVOu12Fg", "user_id": "dzXeeCDAZIrF0uVH4cSiSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2017", "text": "Caseus was pretty much my # 1 bookmarked location that I never made time for.  I blamed it on the fact that they weren't open on Sundays, and that every time I thought of it and tried to get a reservation, they were fully booked.  Finally, one Saturday, I was in the mood to go and was able to get a reservation.  The mother ship has landed!!We decided that we would day drink to go along with our cheese feast.  Had it been warm enough to sit outside, I believe I would have been transported (mentally) back to Paris...a nice bottle of bordeaux and a fabulous cheese plate.  I could spend hours at a sidewalk cafe just watching the world pass me by.  But I digress...it was still cold out and the staff at Caseus were definitely not interested in us taking up one of their few tables for several hours.  Not that it was rushed, as it definitely was not.  But you had the feeling that you should eat and leave, tables cleared around you as soon as feet hit the ground.  But it didn't stop us from enjoying two wonderful glasses of red wine each, along with our various cheese dishes.We started with the cheese plate.  It was amazing, of course.  Four different types of cheese, bread, marcona almonds, fig jam.  So good!   We also had to try the mac and cheese and grilled cheese as well.  We tried both as is, without any additions.  I loved the mac and cheese plain.  Six cheeses and baked to perfection, with a hint of nutmeg maybe?  The grilled cheese was large...thick bread and thick cheese.  The menu said it had half a pound of cheese!  If I were to order this again, I would probably add ham or bacon, to break up the cheese a little bit.We stopped in the cheese shop on the way out and picked up two types of cheese, a container of marcona almonds and a goat cheese brownie.  This place is dangerous!  But well worth the trip."}, {"review_id": "nfyPUoN-WvP70FQk2NDtAw", "user_id": "ypOkmdi7ldmzh6lyplQTyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/16/2017", "text": "I've wanted to come here for so long, and it was worth the wait.

Wow. I ate here with my flatmates to celebrate the beginning of the school year, and we were completely floored by the quality of this food! First off, the decor of this place is beautifully rustic chic. During the day part of the restaurant is actually a cheese shop, and they turn it into a seating area for diners in the evenings. We ate in the \"cheese shop,\" literally surrounded by cheese of all shapes and sizes and were immediately introduced to our menu options by our waitress, who was super knowledgeable about each menu item. I think each menu item was explained with at least 50 adjectives haha. By the end of each description we were all left with mouths watering. In the end I ordered the Onion Soup Gratin with a kale salad, and my friends got the Macaroni & Cheese and Moules Frites platters. We started off with a charcuterie platter which was adorned with a few types of dried meats, pates, and breads, all of which were gobbled up in a matter of minutes. Our food arrived without too much delay afterwards. I was expecting just a bowl of soup, but it ended up being completely covered in a thick, rich layer of three types of cheese! I had never eaten a more delicious bowl of soup. Combined with the melting cheese, the onion soup was a savory and decadent treat. The kale salad was also one of the best I've had. The kale was roasted to a delightfully crunchy crisp with a light seasoning that was tasty and refreshing. The only downside of the night was the bill, which was understandably pretty steep. We're definitely planning on returning, though--maybe to celebrate the end of the semester in a few months."}, {"review_id": "evwamSGuOdcKvwaHQOJmug", "user_id": "eZ5foTyIV3MaypOwcE839g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "Great service.

MY GOD was this place incredible. The inside is cramped, but it fits.First off - our waiter was awesome, down to earth but knowledgable and helpful with every question asked about things we didn't know about. We had some of the poutine fries - gravy and cheese on french fries. Now I'm a picky eater and I've never had something like this before - but man did it blow me out of the water. The gravy was phenomenal and the fries were perfection. It goes without saying that at a place like this the cheese was off the chain as well.Then we got a cheese board - man was it... good. Some cheeses I absolutely LOVED - others - eh. But the experience of trying them was fun.Entre - sadly they were all out of Steak for the night so I got the brined, smoked and flash fried chicken. It was GREAT! The wife got the pork chop and she really enjoyed it too. And because it was our first time, we were not leaving without trying some of the mac n' cheese - which gave me a glimpse of what mac n' cheese tastes like heaven. Oh, I can't tell you how great it was you'll just have to try it for yourself.To close -  we got the chocolate pot de creme with vanilla bean cream on top. It was INCREDIBLE much like everything else. Also - ordered a coke: Mexican coke. Oh yeah - they know what they're doing here.So why 4 out of 5 stars for something I'm writing so gushingly about? Well, for one - was very disappointed they ran out of steak - but secondly, and I knew what I was getting into when I ordered it, but $30-ish for chicken - no matter how good is a little much. Same for the wife's dinner. Including tip - we rang out at close to $120. Thats a BIG night out for us. Everything was fantastic - but it was a little overpriced. But that's the price you pay for quality I guess.

At 7, we were promptly seated. Our server was so patient and kind! We were so excited to see each other and kept yapping away and all she wanted to do was to take our orders. But she was so so so nice and funny about it! I ordered my favorite, the Mac n Cheese, to share with a friend. Oh my gosh, it is so good! So cheesy. Like seriously, take some lactaid pills even if you aren't lactose intolerant because the amount of amazingly melted cheese is overpowering. Everything about the Mac n Cheese is just so perfect! And because it's so rich, sharing with a friend was definitely the way to go. We couldn't even finish the whole thing (maybe it's because we ate too many pickles earlier? Forgot about those delicious pickles). And now that I no longer live in New Haven, I can confidently say the prices and quality are the best you're going to get (Murray's on Bleecker in NY got nothing on Caseus).

We were all sitting and talking after we had paid the check so we didn't notice immediately that we were the last ones there. That was until my friend and I turned to see one of the chefs (we were seated right by the window into the kitchen) glaring, and I mean glaring, at us while drumming his fingers on the steel countertop. I held his gaze for a few seconds, confused about what was going on, and he kept on staring at me in this weird and intimidating way. Obviously this guy wished that we would leave, which is totally understandable given that we had outstayed our welcome and the staff wanted to go home, but I don't think a restaurant as good as Caseus should resort to such childish and rude tactics to enforce closing times. Why didn't the waitress or hostess just come over and point out that it was closing time? It was our mistake not to have noticed sooner that it was time to go but a simple reminder would have sufficed. The people in our party are all reasonable people and would have leapt up to get out of their way as soon as we realised, after all we left just as soon as we noticed the chef giving us the evil eye... I love this place but this was such a mean spirited way to end the night, and as a result we really don't want to return."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/caseus-fromagerie-and-bistro-new-haven?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
