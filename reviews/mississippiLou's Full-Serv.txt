I love brisket but never ventured far away from the Number 7 burger. Today, after the day I've had.. I said BRING IT! Brisket #3 it is. This massive brisket sandwich has white bbq sauce, caramelized onions, candied bacon, and I believe provolone. The white bbq sauce is more of a horseradish mayo than white bbq sauce.. but don't be misinformed, it's banging! The meat is moist and very tender. But what I was missing was flavor in the brisket. I like a prominent seasoning and smokey flavor. Just wasn't there. Those steak fries are phenomenal. Ok. Jason was our server. He was very attentive. I asked to have my sandwich cut in half to share with my mini foodie. I was told they charge $4 to cut it and add an additional side. However, I didn't need an additional side because I don't eat fries. Just tasted it and passed them on. So basically he said even if I didn't get the additional side, it was $4 for them to cut my sandwich in half  so I elected to cut my own sandwich. I thought this was a little crazy but ok lol. But the best part! I asked for a to go box and my check, as I needed to leave for an appointment. He brings the box and says, your check has been taking care of already. I said, what? He said yeah someone paid your check. I said that's nice but who. He said anonymous.. so I left the tip and had gotten the cure for my depression at Lou's after all. Whoever picked up my check, bless you.. you made my day better."}, {"review_id": "n97salbx_lr9YofEoPg87A", "user_id": "XfHbOSzShpitHEFs3hjs9g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "My new favorite restaurant. Very casual atmosphere with 5-star entrees! I recommend the teres major - bacon wrapped tender steak medallions atop wilted spinach and creamy mashed potatoes with an au jus gravy to top it off. The salmon and redfish dish is a flavorful masterpiece. The homemade ice cream is the perfect complement to what has to be the finest bread pudding in the United States. Seriously - try it! The sandwiches are great & the drinks are damn good too. Try the old mule which features real ginger. Or the Louis I which features proseco & one of my favorite liqueurs - St. Germain. Try it and save me some bread pudding!"}, {"review_id": "Dm7UFaz_cbyb3nJG4G-c1A", "user_id": "husORiMtF2jwq04r_u_uaw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "I am basically obsessed with Lou's.  I follow them on Instagram and day dream about their desserts.  They have a bread pudding that is topped with home made brown sugar ice cream that is to die for!  Love the onion rings and the chicken sandwich.  Also the blue plates are really good.

The place is located next to McDade's off Fortification. I've passed by it without going in several times. I was told that their desserts were phenomenal. And I must admit they were pretty great. I indulged in the blackberry cobbler cake. The ice cream had a unique flavor that offset the sweet cobbler. The balance worked perfectly. The drinks were worth the visit as well. I'd suggest going doing lunch the dinner prices are a bit steep for the city but the food is on another level."}, {"review_id": "JBtGbsa6zfwvebqc5OZUbQ", "user_id": "2jxE-cvG4f0RnGtXte76VQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/27/2016", "text": "Located on FORTIFICATION STREET that bears that in name. Lou's Full Service is located on the hallowed grounds of a turn of the century pharmacy, now a hipster homage to an old-school gas station w hand hewn pipe fitter styled housewares & tables, muted sectional seating in the bar area with Edison bulb lighting.Upbeat ponytailed servers are ready to take your order. All staff, save the host, don grey pinstriped auto mechanic uniform  w sown on name patch badges. Booth seating is new w proprietor handcrafted 2x6 dark stained industrial table tops. All in all the look of this place has a nice spin to it. So here's what you need to know.The food IS ALL THAT (and they can crab crust most anything on the menu for a $10 add on). Yes! I'm in agreement with fellow Yelpers proclamations, adding this: It's really really good food presented in the hipsterish way this town offers to the repeat clients of well heeled Pinteresters. The flounder entree and blueberry desert was kicking it! My spouse's Big Mac styled cheeseburger was unbelievable in taste and that it took a steak knife to secure it from toppling like a giant Jinga tower.Other Yelpers & Magazines have taken primo photos, capturing the interior that are quite magnificent. And the Etsy-like sculpture in the bathroom you have to see to believe. This is a very good place for lovely eats. FYI expensive as all get out so make it the meal of the day for a big splurge. It's worth it in my book!"}, {"review_id": "OxW8wdf0f7u2yhFPIhwAVw", "user_id": "IOX4m9-sWTcjaqDy3r_O8Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2017", "text": "Now this is a real treat. I have only been here several times because it is a bit pricey, but it is amazing! I have tried the burger and the prime rib. Both are fabulous and so flavorful. This place was voted the best burger in town! It's kind of weird because this is a classy restaurant at the very end of a not-so-classy grocery store (McDade's)... but don't let the exterior fool you! Walk on in.

The food is plentiful and favorful. Their drinks are authentic with a twist. But the desserts...now that's some next level stuff. I had the burger and it was good but large. It was the small burger and I could only eat 1/4 of it. It was juicy and cooked to order at medium. (I wouldn't suggest getting any other than medium unless it was a good restaurant.) It's a bit pricey especially if you go during dinner and not lunch but it's ok for a splurge night out. Really good date night place or dinner out with a intimate group of friends."}, {"review_id": "XVnQJ9-p2AQ3aCn-SDraKQ", "user_id": "OudRWpnv1wIirXcLA5ButA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Favorite restaurant in all of Jackson!

Food is excellent, staff is warm and extremely knowledgeable of the food choices. Just always a joy to come here. Everyone I bring raves about the food and they end up returning on their own. I got the Tres Major which was a succulent beef shoulder tenderloin I believe. Presentation was fantastic and the flavor was over the top. I always get the blueberry cobbler for dessert and it is the best part of the meal. Swing by and you will be hooked!!Ok, was back again tonight (after a couple of other great trips here without an update), and this place NEVER disappoints. Tonight, I got their special which was a pan seared red fish on top of cheesy grits, with sweet flash fried crawfish tails. That dish was incredible, best dish of the year for me! A bit sweet at the end and flowed amazingly. Dessert has always been the blueberry cobbler as it is outstanding. However, I was swayed by the barkeeper, Jeremy, to get the bread pudding with a Brown Sugar, Caramel Ice Cream that was just over the top, \"SICK\"!

Overall it doesn't make it or break it on the atmosphere Food - the food is just off the chains good. They source everything they can from local places and really go all out on each item. We had crawfish fondue with steak fries to dip in, so rich and good. Meal we had their burger and it truly is one of the best I've had, meat is cooked to perfection, had pork belly on it, smoked Gouda, and BBQ aioli.  Dessert was their no. 1 seller the blueberry lemon cake/cobbler with ice cream, just perfection.One thing to note is the prices in general seem a touch high, at least for what we are used to around the area, not saying it's not worth it, just something to be aware of."}, {"review_id": "SPVtWd5C2YgoqxCpqMJ1fw", "user_id": "It8o_mi0IKR1VbJM8RI5Pw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Finally got here to try out this local gem!

After trying to find a highly rated restaurant for my vacationing family I found Lou's. The Yelp entry showed the price range as \"$$.\" Having spent the last five days on the road, the most I paid in a dinner bill was $60 for the four of us. Unfortunately, Lou's broke that record by double. For two fish entrees, a shrimp risotto, and ONE braised rib dish, the total was just shy of $120!!!! The food tasted great. However, the transparency of pricing sucks. Definitely not a finer dining moment in of my life.- expect to pay at least $17 for a burger- NOT Kid friendly: no kids menu- portion size could be better- not the diner that the setting makes it out to beI won't be returning, even if I am in Jackson again."}, {"review_id": "mp_0n90KC7tFEfi8TLi2_Q", "user_id": "NobNTSM4glG5opX050MQHQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/21/2017", "text": "Food was great, but our waitress wasn't attentive to us!
