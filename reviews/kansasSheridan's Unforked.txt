So I wanted to post an update.Over all, this place does serve a fair amount of food for what you pay. As far as the fries, I think the truffle fries are the way to go if you order them. I am not a huge fan of the salted fries or the unsalted fries. But the truffle fries? Only a dollar more but worth it!I went back to try the new \"Impossible Burger.\" I've heard a lot of hype about this burger over the past year or so since it was announced. People on You Tube posting how this was the best veggie burger ever and on and on.Now this is not made by Unforked. Impossible Burger is made by another company, but they just started serving it here. So my comments on the Impossible Burger do not reflect on Unforked. Just my 2¢...To me the burger was good, I just wasn't prepared for the sticker shock! Granted, this is my first time ordering it, but I had no idea that the meatless patty was going to be so much more exponentially expensive than their other burger offerings, including their mushroom patty. ($11.00 for the burger! This is nearly double than their regular meat burger patty!) That has to do more with the company and their price to the restaurant so take that for what it really is. To me, the Impossible Burger was just a little better than a Morning Star Grillers Prime burger. The texture seemed to be close to the Grillers patties, but clearly more superior ingredients. But would I return to Unforked and order it again? I certainly would if/when Impossible Burger gets their costs down so restaurants like Unforked can pass that savings on to their customers. Maybe to treat myself now and then.But what I really wish Unforked would do would be to develop their own veggie burger. The best veggie burger I had ever was at Zombie Burger in Des Moines, IA. And it did not have a meat texture. A good veggie burger does not need to resemble meat. (In fact, I think the best ones don't!) I have tried their grilled portobello mushroom \"burger\" a few times and really do not like it. I want to like it, but it really did turn me off. And maybe was the motivation behind my previous review. Unforked has some great quality food, so I think they could really come forward and develop a true veggie burger that tops the lists of quality!I have enjoyed other foods here. Their avocado tacos are great! The veggie quesadilla! Their CHIPS! OH WOW, their CHIPS! They taste so fresh and crisp! And I checked their menu and now see they offer Ma-La Bello tacos! Well, that's going to be worth another trip very soon!This place is great! And if they got a truly great veggie burger on the menu, I would be likely to give this place five stars! I am glad they are giving Impossible Burger a chance, but right now it's just too expensive for my tastes!"}, {"review_id": "QPS9iG8SXnU2rTtRPDMGfg", "user_id": "aHKfqu0iAenvgIOEvS2Xqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "The food is on the restaurant quality, always made to order and always fresh and clean.

Good quality ingredients at this counter service restaurant is a great place for lunch or dinner. The portabella burger is very good. The meat is real tender and cooked to order, while the mushroom is full and tasty. The fries are crispy and freshly cut. The frozen custard is excellent. Creamy and higher quality then most places, and the mixins are fresh, especially the nuts are crunchy.  The high quality of this counter service place shows."}, {"review_id": "qx55U2tkpB4qGHpVsCWrIw", "user_id": "AL0RTsAE5GHK0gvnN-Vb0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "We come here for work-lunch.

My brother got both of the vegetarian tacos and I got the vegetarian portobello burger so we could all try stuff. We also tried the regular and truffle fries, tumeric milk, and margaritas. Everything was incredible. My favorite was the portobello Thai thing I got, the brussel sprouts on top were incredible. The fries were thin and crispy which I enjoyed! Turmeric milk was a bit odd but glad we tried it out. Margaritas were super strong and amazing, black salt on the rim! The tacos my brother got, crispy avocado and the one with pesto on it were soo good. I want to try a shake next time I come to visit!"}, {"review_id": "8zJxd8JarifhkmKiNbZjkg", "user_id": "HMDCV5aOvB_RynPPU2fNTg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Unforked has Sheridan's delicious custard, but also it's a healthy alternative to fast food. My favorite tacos are the citrus crunch chicken and the barking pig. They also have seasonal specials that add a little variety to the menu.I don't recommend using their drive-through lane though, unless maybe you are the only one in line. Their food isn't prepared quick enough to make the drive through time-efficient. Just go inside and get your order to go."}, {"review_id": "C8ll4WlgZjqSEKsZFtnBGw", "user_id": "rOQZhDe4jMd2BOZXzZGklg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "This is a great place to grab lunch on the weekends.  I've ordered several of their tacos and I haven't been disappointed yet! The restaurant is always clean, the staff are nice, and the food always tastes fresh.  They have a good selection of drinks, including some alcoholic drinks.  I tried the blueberry margarita--not the best margarita I've had but it was pretty good.  Overall, it's a good place.

Once I got over that, I settled on the pure burger with fries, and a PBBH (peanut butter, banana, and honey) shake. The burger and fries were delicious, and are way above and beyond typical \"fast food\". The PBBH was delicious, and was a great way to end a meal.

First, I always get fretting in a timely manner and with great service. I do realize it is a popular establishment so expect a wait during peak times (lunch). But we were still able to get a table inside. I also visited after work and it was less crowded. The food is so always fresh and flavorful. Let me tell you there Fried Egg BLT was something special. The bun was perfect, the sandwich was a good size and it was delicious! If you have t had truffle fries splurge on yourself and grab you an order!!! My go to drink is their Lavender Lemonade because it gives my drink an exotic taste. It's not your typical fast food chain so oh the little extra money and get you something good!!"}, {"review_id": "TnQlnX5BURsh3T8dFjnyJw", "user_id": "QWd3RGdHgaQnjfkua_HCFQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Ready for this?

Other positives are the water with fruit that's always available and the manager is very awesome. I hope this place expands and includes a special for tacos lol.
