We came here for lunch and were not disappointed. Although they do have a drive-thru which is great for convenience, I am very glad we came inside to place our to-go order because otherwise we wouldn't have known about the delightful dessert and beverage options. If you like freshly brewed iced tea then hold on to your britches because they have like 6 different flavors to choose from here! In regards to the dessert options, there are several types of pastries and such but I was drawn immediately to the case of a dozen different flavors of homemade cookies. I opted for the peanut butter which had a little chocolate drop on the top and it was absolute perfection.For breakfast (they serve through lunchtime) and lunch there are many choices from egg combinations and sandwiches to pizza bagels and soup or salad. One of the cool things about the different choices is the ability to customize your choice. For customization you can just start from scratch and build your own bagel or sandwich or you can choose from already put together combinations with whatever kind of bagel or bread you choose.On my first visit here I had the pizza bagel with pepperoni and a peanut butter cookie and a water and my total was something around $7 which is pretty affordable in my opinion for lunch with dessert. I say my first visit to allude to the fact that I will for sure be back here to try different menu items and I will update my review with the deets as soon as I do.The service was good with very friendly front line staff and the order didn't take very long to fill. Next time I come here I will probably try to come inside and sit down to enjoy my meal because the ambiance is really nice and they have free WiFi. The ceiling is decorated with clear Christmas lights which seems fun and cozy to me. The walls have memorabilia from the owner and the local Tulsa area. Would be a cool place to come with friends and hangout/grab a bite to eat."}, {"review_id": "BgtAsGvmtdNr3SRDxAJpdQ", "user_id": "Pu7KLX7W2TpeFTtvUN1row", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/29/2017", "text": "Oklahoma based, consistent quality, friendly service, incredible pastries, community oriented, and affordable prices, all perfectly describe each and every Old School Bagel Cafe. You really can't go wrong at Old School Bagel Cafe and this location excels at showcasing all these qualities. The bagels are amazing, the cookies/pastries are amazing, the staff is extra friendly, and even the patrons are friendly. 2 people can easily have a tasty complete breakfast meal for under $10. The one possible area of improvement (and not just at this location), the espresso drinks. Coffee is good, but cappuccinos and lattes could be better. Overall though, this is my go to bagel place in Oklahoma, and I really doubt that will change anytime soon. Tip: Leave some room for a cookie!"}, {"review_id": "h7gQ3QTlQfkg6-6aRJf4og", "user_id": "E_1ewJlzx5yvXHwAHpUEMA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/18/2017", "text": "Fam friendly, fast and fresh.

And I still love it. Ordered it on the everything with jalapeno and honey almond cream cheese and I'll say, delicious. Also, wife had the chorizo and we had a couple muffins and a couply lattes. All perfect.Service was friendly and fast. Parked across the street. We had a big group and no one was rude to us or our kiddos. I'll be back for sure.

Here's the deal. I had to make a quick business trip to Norman. My original plan was that I would be there for lunch and grab a Chick fil a sandwich but my granddaughter was crying off and on all night for some reason and that meant I was up at 4 am. Which resulted in me being in Norman by 8 am and back to Tulsa by lunch time. And I passed right by this place and I read their cookies were great so there ya go. The Cowboy Club was really good. I had the multi-grain bagel. Soft and fresh. The meat had great flavor and there was plenty of it. I bought a cookie which I will eat for mid-afternoon snack. It looks delicious. They are pricey do the grandkids won't be getting one. The good news for M is I would be happy to return here and will bring her along."}, {"review_id": "oTgoBMhMk1YeH_nrPDDLjw", "user_id": "Fcer-9E1LnBDVnfM0wPlNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "They handle a lot of traffic with efficiency.

Honest to God, in 1998 I skipped class once to get bagels. I pulled up to my local bagel shop in my (parents) busted up LeBaron convertible, blasting Days of the New (or some other overly serious alt rock band) to order a Sesame seed with ungodly amounts of cream cheese. So yeah, I was kind of a badass. I think we used to think bagels had some sort of health benefit back then. They gave you energy or something. Flash forward to today, and bagels are just this tasty part of everyday life that you just don't think that much about....... Unless you're still trapped in the 90's like me!  I freaking still love bagels!  Fancy or plain, sweet or savory. I don't give a crap, I just need bagels as much as I need my Silverchair CD. Old School Bagel Cafe are just the people in Tulsa to give them to me. First of all, the bagels are delicious. The cheddar and jalapeño is especially good, with a lot of melted cheddar. The French toast is also very good, very rich. The cream cheeses are great as well, half the fun is pairing a bagel with the right cream cheese. They have other baked goods as well. I impulse bought a black and white cookie one time, it was good but mostly made me miss New York. The place itself is very clean. It's a good place to meet a friend for a casual breakfast. They have a giant tv that was showing Bundesliga soccer when I was in. Cool stuff. So this is definitely my go to bagel place in Tulsa. If you're here on Sunday mornings you might just hear me coming, blasting some Flagpole Sitta by Harvey Danger and pining for the days when it was cool to be unambitious."}, {"review_id": "hItiuzvsgsHLl_6SQuOcKg", "user_id": "xdi4RQh3RihQHpS3gOuxfw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/3/2017", "text": "their everything bagel is the best thing out there! usually, an everything bagel has the topping on the top f the bagel - but here, the topping is on the bottom as well.

While they aren't the greatest bagels in the entire world, they're easily the absolute best in Tulsa. You can't go wrong with any of their bagels, but I personally love the Everything or Sesame Seed. Asiago and French Toast are also super yummy! I usually order low fat cream cheese, but I think Old School's tastes a little weird, so I recommend just getting regular cream cheese here. If you want something a little more substantial (though their bagels are HUGE and I'm always full after I eat like half of one), I love the lox and cream cheese sandwich. Breakfast sandwiches are great, too, but order them on bagels to make them even better. Also, I never really buy cookies or pastries when I'm out to eat because I figure I'm already being unhealthy enough, but Old School's cookies are ridiculously good and unique. I can't resist getting cookies here, and if you're trying Old School for the first time, you should definitely get at least one - even if you aren't hungry after your bagel, you can save the cookie for later.Ambiance inside is great - very New York and sort of divey feeling. They have pretty lights strung up on the ceilings, and it's a really great place to meet up with friends for a quick meal or even just come by yourself to sit and read the paper. My brother and I came the other day and realized for the first time that there's an outdoor seating area, so we went out there and it was really nice! Also another tip - the lines get really long on Saturday and Sunday mornings, so you should try to come on a weekday for no wait."}, {"review_id": "dA9Wcbp9jmy4Qe45Odkusw", "user_id": "Gf9LwNXRdlWzWFXHUXXRzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/24/2017", "text": "As a lover of all things bread and cheese, I typically go to old school bagel for the asiago bagel.
