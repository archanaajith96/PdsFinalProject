I don't mind getting charged  4,5,6,7 dollars for salmon in my bagel as long as it is a proper amount. It is as if one needs to order double amount of salmon to get a proper layer of salmon across the whole bagel. Bagel was still  tasty or at least the bites that had salmon in them.  I'm not sure  I'll be coming back for a salmon bagel.Also I wish they had whole grain bagels that are not honey infused."}, {"review_id": "Qn_Rem46403OJ3GFl9hSQA", "user_id": "5CfUTW4O0GNCB-aTfZnjGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "This is a great locally owned restaurant here in Reno!

After multiple consecutive visits...I've decided that it doesn't even matter if they run out of bagels during the late afternoon. Why you ask? Because these bagels are WORTH getting up early for.That's right, you heard me... I'll actually get up early...for this bagel. And I have too lol!That and the owner went out of her way to message and respond to my first Yelp review about the bagels running low later in the day.That just shows how involved she truly is. This place is her baby and you can tell by the amount of love that's put into it. Now, it seems every time I go in, I can't help but order the same thing. The Denver post, on jalapeño cheddar bagel with chive cream cheese added. I've also tried the same sandwich with sriracha cream cheese and also with the garden garlic, yet the chive is so far my favorite.Two eggs, ham, grilled onions and peppers, cheddar and cream cheese, make this bagel to die for. A melty, gooey, deliciously savory bagel sandwich, I just can't get enough of.I talked to who I believe is the owner in the store about getting my bagels eggs, with yolk next time. She said they'd gladly do it and I might ask also, for it to not be cut in half so it's easier for me to eat and not as messy, especially with the two runny yolks I want to get! Either way... I love this place. Truly the best breakfast bagels in town. And while I haven't really brought myself to try anything else...one day I will!!! ... or maybe I'll just keep getting the Denver Post!"}, {"review_id": "PShRsyllxr4FnfM5IvQ87g", "user_id": "mbmJmGvpcVNtNHD7Lmimgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "As a local Las Vegan with bagel places in abundance it was so great to find this Reno gem!

You can choose any bagel you want, and everything on the menu looked pretty customizable. The coffee menu was plentiful too; I opted for a small latte with almond syrup, and it was divine! The ambiance here is cute, and it looks like they feature local artwork, some available for purchase.

Shanel and her husband are two of the hardest working business owners I've ever met and if you spend five minutes watching them talk to customers you'll know exactly what I mean. Best of all, they know how to receive feedback to make their business that much better. I come here because the DB knows how to keep it simple and keep it delicious. So that's exactly what I do when I stop in. A breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese and ham or bacon on one of their freshly baked bagels (choose any and you won't be disappointed) with a hot cup of coffee makes me happy. All I add is a bit of salt and pepper, and Cholula! On the last visit I did notice a chorizo, spinach and cheese sandwich that sounded so good, but I couldn't break away from tradition. Truth be told, I actually crave this basic sandwich from time to time and go out of my way to get it! Their bagels are a bit doughier than I'm used to, but for a sandwich it's actually perfect! The last time I was in I requested my coffee in a real mug and the server wasn't sure she could do that, but on this visit Shanel let me know that was totally doable.I'm upping my rating for consistently serving a quality product with a huge smile and regard for every customer coming through their door. They more than deserve it and you owe it to yourself to pay them a visit!"}, {"review_id": "EvcPSlMFvRCnWhZD3YFQZA", "user_id": "N3-xR8xMQF6Ey3EfWKAYvg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "Excellent!  Got an everything bagel with cream cheese and lox.  It was great - the bagel could have been toasted a little more so next time I'll ask for it well done but it tasted wonderful.Got a cappuccino and it was actually a cappuccino not a lattePleasant service and quick delivery topped it all off...I'll be back next time I'm in Reno"}, {"review_id": "ATQ78D1zGFf-DOVAijBtWQ", "user_id": "Y7E4Q4xHfuW4w1o5KUNWuw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/11/2017", "text": "They're located at an unusual and secluded spot in Reno, but it's truly a hidden gem. Hopefully, the rest of the area becomes more developed, excluding the neighboring apartment complex. I tried their strawberry banana smoothie and a breakfast asiago bagel w/ tomatoes, avocado, and Swiss. They're priced pretty nicely, depending on your choices of insides (roughly $3-4). They have specialty ones as well that cost a bit more ($5-7). The store itself is quite small and is connected to a salon via a smaller room on the side. They hang up quirky art pieces as well that are up for sale. And a bag of yesterday's leftover bagels (but still good) are also for sale ($3). Overall, this is a great place to grab breakfast then head out! Definitely want to try their other breakfast items."}, {"review_id": "h8RJvPomcOYeYiENZATYcA", "user_id": "M9RyXJM_nnav0JYWP4TWLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "From Sincity Las Vegas.
