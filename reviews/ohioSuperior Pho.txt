I've ordered pho soup takeout before but I just tried the Bún today (3B) and it was so delicious. Our party of 3 came during lunch time and they were slammed. We waited maybe 5 minutes for a table. Our waitress immediately brought us water and asked if we wanted anything else to drink. They keep it pretty fast paced I think because of the rush hour but she was still very polite, patient, and had a great suggestion for my meal. The fried spring roll in my bowl was the best I have ever had. Despite it being busy there it wasn't loud and we had plenty of room to sit. I also really enjoyed my pho soup that I ordered as takeout a few months ago. It was really nice that they packed everything separate so nothing gets soggy.great prices, great atmosphere, great service. I highly reccomend it!"}, {"review_id": "fLkmb2JXVsvmNXfMyOaO_g", "user_id": "NqBYt9pw7kNoytFQ9ATS-w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "One would think that the Pho in Ohio would be cheaper but that is a negative. They have a lot of meal combos so you get a spring/summer roll, Pho of your choice, and a drink for like $14.I picked the pho with everything in it, fried spring roll (you get one), and the viet iced coffee (this is 2 dollars more on top of the meal price). My meal was basically $17. For some reason I just thought it would be like cheaper... side note: cheapest pho ever that I had was actually in Houston (6 bucks a bowl!)The broth is decent. The spring roll was like from a Chinese rest- not the authentic viet spring roll that comes with lettuce wrap & dipping sauce. Viet coffee was pretty legit- came with the dripper at all. FYI: You have to like go through a hallway to get here unless you park in the back. Also-philly pho is still the best!"}, {"review_id": "oC02ev8IUl5yMUjvVKrdmQ", "user_id": "ouI1xciHLEMSriQUK95nlQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "After being on my Cleveland bucket list for years, I've finally made it to Superior Pho!

We had the #7 and #8 pho with beef. Our food came out really quick and was warm and steaming. The side of toppings, fresh mint, bean sprouts, and jalapeños, was large and more than enough for two. The noodles were perfect and delicious, some of the brisket was bit dry but makes sense for that cut. I was a little disappointed with the flavor of the broth, it was less flavorful than I'm used to. Still really good comfort food and at a great price! We also tried the summer rolls for an app and they were great.Note: this place is tricky to find from Superior, it's in the plaza with the red awning. You can turn onto 31st from superior and find their parking lot on the left, you'll see a larger sign for a Korean restaurant and they're in the same building."}, {"review_id": "iRiEbWeNEE0kdUdMhPHE-w", "user_id": "FgErZblCviykov87oDIk0g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "This has got to be one of the best, if not the absolute best pho spots in all of Cleveland. I've been here multiple times and have never been disappointed. Not easy to find from the street, but rightfully tucked away. The interior has a wall of all of their accolades, and you know your in the right spot. It's always a win when we can agree on a restaurant since there are many different options on the menu. I've always dined in, but I always love the idea of take out. Aside from the amazing pho options they have one of the best Bánh mí I've ever tried. I would highly recommend this spot.

I believe my cousin now when they say Vietnamese people don't eat out at Vietnamese restaurant in Ohio (and no it's not because they can cook it at home)... The quality of food here is just down right unacceptable as well as their service. I'm just going to be straight forward:Service: Waitress or \"cashier\" sat us down. Didn't ask if we needed a high chair for our toddler and no water. A group came in after us and immediately got water and got their orders taken.  (At this point I'm still holding my child... no one bother to look at us) I just decided to carry my child over to the high chairs and carry it over myself while holding my child on one side...AND STILL not one waitstaff bother to look at us or come over to us. Eventually I had to wave one waiter down, he just look confused and went back to the kitchen to get us water. I had to wave another wait staff down to place and order. My husband accidentally knock over the water. The waiter took our orders and told us that he will be right back to clean the mess up... (the mess was NEVER clean... and when i said never I mean, we pay and the ice was still on the table *see picture for reference*) There were different waiters coming to our table to drop our food and FAIL to see or bother to clean the mess that's on the table. Over all the whole wait staff needs to be retrain... Food: Papaya Salad: tasteless... in Vietnamese it's advertise as \"Kho Bo\" meaning \"beef jerky\", but we got pork jerky... the sauce was just plain soy sauce. Pho: bland... I normally don't add hoisin sauce or hot sauce. But I had to this time and almost a tablespoon of fish sauce and it was still bland...I just felt the need to write this because I'm highly disappointed that this place have raving reviews and this is nothing like authentic Vietnamese cuisine. If you think this is great, wait until you have the real deal in places that have a good amount of Viet community, your mind will be blown! You are better off investing in a 8 quart instant pot and follow \"Cong can cook pho\" on YouTube...."}, {"review_id": "CSTL6owbt-iEeOlsdJudCQ", "user_id": "s_KLwRLXu29brgrjRZirFA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/7/2017", "text": "My GO-TO spot for Pho in the grand city of Cleveland. Although I usually go for one thing and one thing only, the Pho Ga, AKA pho with chicken, I have ordered a side or two in the past, like the vietnamese sandwich and chicken cabbage salad. Absolutely everything I've had from here is excellent, flavorful, and hits the spot. They have a variety of different phos, appetizers, and combo meals to choose from. Tons of sriracha, soy and eel sauce at the table for your using pleasure, and every time I've eaten at the restaurant, the place is crowded, but I'm eating my pho only 5 minutes after ordering. See, this place rocks. I order pho to go from here frequently, and it comes in very user friendly containers. The broth comes in a separate container, so all you have to do is combine the noods and the broth in a bowl at home and voila, you have pho on your couch in your pajamas. The service is great. The product is exquisite. Hands down, my favorite pho spot in the city.

This rhetorically named restaurant is an elusive gem amidst a rock strewn dessert of various choices; however, it is a must try for those who enjoy Vietnamese food, or simply for the adventurous types who want something outside the normal realm of Asian fare here in NE Ohio.  First and foremost, if you need a caffeine fix, then the Vietnamese coffee (made with sweetened condensed milk and quite strong) is an excellent choice! Being a vegetarian, I like Pho because it is light, yet flavorful and satisfying. I usually get the vegetarian Pho, which comes in a large bowl and is generously portioned with carrots, celery, and other vegetables! There are a variety of other dishes as well, so if Pho doesn't float your boat, perhaps rice will!

I'm not a pho connoisseur, but this bowl definitely hits the spot! The small bowl is enough for a meal, but I'd recommend getting the large. It's a lot more food and for not that much more cost, and maybe you'll have leftovers! If there's a bunch of people on your table who ordered pho, then they'll combine the veggies onto a single plate, and I feel like you don't get as much as you should. Not a huge deal, but it might be annoying if you really like your bean sprouts. I've also had their vermicelli noodles with spring rolls and beef. So good! I can eat the whole bowl. The spring rolls are crispy and not too oily, and the whole bowl doesn't feel very heavy at all.  Parking is easy, and I've never had a problem with long waits.

However after having been here dozens of times I can finally write a thorough review. I typically only order the pho.  The broth and the noodles are always inconsistent. The broth is sometimes good and sometimes really watered down. Sometimes the noodles are good and sometimes served in a clump that is way over cooked. The bathroom there is absolutely disgusting and maybe the site of a b movie horror flic. It's always been like that btw. If they don't care about their bathroom sanitation then what else might they be 'lax about. Last time we went, we decided it would be our last :(  the bathroom door lock doesn't even work unless you are a lock picking master. When the owner's son saw me struggling he  said just keep trying and laughed at me. I still couldn't get in and then he took the key and he couldn't even get in lol. It's called spend 30 f'n dollars at the hardware store and get a new mechanism!!! Obviously they don't care. The owner never speaks to us if we are an all man group, but if we're with a female he comes by and greets her in a flirting way. Our one female friend won't go there because the owner won't stop asking her out. Isn't he married? Last thing, how come almost every time I have been there, the wait staff sprays the cleaning fluid right next to us onto a table and splashes on our table and the smell is awful while you're eating.

I don't even like some NY pho restaurants. I am a little spoiled.... (maybe snobby too). Sorry!I was excited to find such a highly rated Vietnamese restaurant in Cleveland, but I was immediately very disappointed. This was severely mediocre pho and Vietnamese food. The main star of pho is the broth, and it wasn't very flavorful. I also ordered the pork and broken rice dish which was subpar. I definitely do not want to take away from how much everyone else loves it. It definitely wasn't horrible or inedible; however, I have definitely experienced better.In addition, it was pretty confusing locating the restaurant. It's not a separate building from the Korean restaurant. If you park in the back and walk in the building you set on googlemaps, you'll see the restaurant to your right. Other restaurants are in the building too. Don't get it mixed up!"}, {"review_id": "BNlOKOTHAVwX23XfxQQdGw", "user_id": "NSQSY7j3RJ4RY-8SYbMGKA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "Yesss!

So moving out all the way to Cleveland I was pleased to see that I could still satisfy any pho cravings I had, and I ended up eating here many times throughout the years.I can't exactly explain it, but my general feeling is that the pho here is not as good as the pho I have back at home. Maybe I'm just biased, and it is such a minor difference, so we'll just set that thought aside. It is still the most filling and comforting food that is perfect on a cold day. Plus it is at such a reasonable price point, which is all a poor college student can really ask for.A lot of people like ordering the #12 pho, because it comes with all the meats, but since I don't like all the meat (especially tripe!) I would usually get the #6 or #7 (small $8.25). If you don't want pho, I would recommend ordering 3C, which is pretty much rice with deliciously marinated pork  ($9.95). It is sweet and savory, which is my favorite flavor combination. But if you want the best value, definitely order one of the combination meals, which will pretty much feed you for 2 meals for only a fraction more money.On a final note, the service is always really friendly, and the food comes fast. Definitely a solid go-to place for a quick bite, or a pick me up on a cold winter day in Cleveland."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/superior-pho-cleveland?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
