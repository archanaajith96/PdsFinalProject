He was polite and moved the lunch along promptly.  No rudeness, just efficient.  We had about a 2 minute wait in line outside for a 2 top.  We got there around 11:45 am and beat the crowd.  I will definitely repeat!"}, {"review_id": "bICXXolwKkwh7UkHuNptvQ", "user_id": "Jc8AaWiqsi8xTXcyasvSZw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Good Lord, that was some delicious steak!

Not disappointed although as you can see I am at 4 stars for the first visit in. No line, it formed just after we arrived around 11:00 AM, and we got a table in the back dining room near the server station. A line of about 10-15 formed after that. We were able to order pretty quickly since we were all there for the famous fried chicken. Three white meat plates with one side each and an extra side of fried okra. Community iced tea too! Food came out very quickly and was hot. I had two wings and a breast and attacked the wings first. The breading lightness and crunch were as advertised and the meat juicy and flavorful. The breast was more of the same but mine was pretty spicy unlike the wings but I love spicy. I am one of those who leave very little on the plate when I finish fried chicken. Chicken: 5 Stars. Sides are another story. While the fried okra was hot and crunchy, my fries were hard and dry, mashed potatoes seemed from flakes and Mac and cheese school cafeteria style. My cornbread muffin was good too, a bit sweet. Service was great, snappy and friendly but it's clear that they do not want you hanging out after the main meal to get more folks to your table. Understandable at a place of this nature. Desserts sounded good but we took some chicken with us even so none this time. At $15 for three pieces and one side it is a tad more expensive than my current favorite fried chicken spot, Mr. Ed's on 21st in Metairie. They serve half a chicken with the best potato salad ever for $13.75. Highly recommend them along with Willie Mae's. I would wait maybe 15-20 minutes in-line here but not really any more than that. It's great chicken but......"}, {"review_id": "Cui2BfrnmWXPczL5iz-S4w", "user_id": "lzdyQzxbmNxtKRZ3seip8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "The best friend chicken ever!! Like ever!!! The skin is super crunchy , crispy with a hint of spiciness and melts perfectly in your mouth. The chicken is moist, not dry at all. I wish i bought some to go so I could eat it one last time at the airport.This was my last meal in NOLA. We arrived 15 mins before they open on a Monday and was first in line. The long starts forming though by 9:50am. We ordered 2 plates of the 3 piece chicken, dark and white meat (15 each). This was the only meal in nola that my boyfriend and I did not share. It is so good and delicious, just do yourself a favor and get your own plate. It's too good to share and 3 pieces is not too much, also comes with a side. I got the fried okra; boyfriend got mashed potatoes...both were bomb!! We got two corn bread and again it was good as well. Fried chicken is not the same anymore. And can't wait to come back here one day. Service is top notch too. Gotta love that southern hospitality!!!!

I had really high expectations coming in, and they were still far surpassed. Not only was this the best fried chicken I've ever eaten, I can't even think of any other that are in the same league. Everything about it was just about perfect -- the skin was super robust and crunchy, the meat came right off the bone, the flavors really jumped out, and it was a great portion size. (Big, but not murderously large.)The sides were great as well, especially the mac & cheese. I really enjoyed the fried okra (especially with the awesome hot sauce they have on the tables), sweet peas, butter beans, and cornbread as well. My wife also got mashed potatoes with gravy, and we were more neutral on that.I'll be dreaming of this place until next time I'm in New Orleans, and it'll probably be our first stop when we come back."}, {"review_id": "i-GqJrZDKB9J4Msozf0NDA", "user_id": "d73I0TIDJSzwBC_Tk1_Y3A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Voted best fried chicken in America by Food Network and Travel Channel, and I have to concur. :)) GREAT service!!!!

Eat a snack first because you'll be waiting a while. We went around 3pm on a weekday and still waited a little over an hour. Well worth the wait for delicious friend chicken!

We were a large group of 12  people but the wait in line was a decent 30 mins. The people in front of us were waiting in line for almost 3 hrs! Claimed as America`s best fried chicken- I was curious to try the food.We were one of the last groups in line-every 15 mins or so  a lady would come out with a notepad to let people in. We were seated on the main floor. The bright orange walls and acrylic painting of Willie Mae herself were welcoming. I appreciated the artwork for highlighting the history of the business. We got our menus but to my suprise-we didn`t really have much of a choice to order from other than the fried chicken, butter beans and corn bread. I really wanted to try the mac`n`cheese or mash but they were out cold. The butter beans tasted like indian lentil soup-it was interesting to sample something out of my own culture cooked in a different way. The chicken itself was deep fried to almost toasted crisp/not burnt but to a brown. The texture was nice-greasy but the batter didn't fall off the chicken. The pieces were generous in size. Am I a fried chicken expert? No but I did enjoy the chicken.My perception of my meal would have changed if I had more sides to try the chicken with. But that was the price I paid for coming late!

I came on a Monday in the afternoon around 3pm. There of course was a line but it wasn't too bad. Waited on line for about 20 minutes. They are known for their fried chicken so of course had to get that. The smallest chicken meal you can get is 3 pieces with a side. Which is actually a lot of food. I got my three pieces with red beans as my side. It was 3pm and the restaurant closed at 5 so by that time they were beginning to run out of sides. So that's one downside of coming later in the afternoon.    The restaurant does not have alcoholic beverages. They have soft drinks, teas and lemonade. The fried chicken was no other fried chicken I had ever had before. It was delicious and spicy. Couldn't finish it all so took my left over priced to go. I will try to come back to Willie Mae's every time I'm in NOLA.

So we settled on mashed potatoes and gravy, reordered... and then found out they were also out of them. So we got our third-string sides of fries and sweet potatoes, and despite the menu stating that peas are included, they were not (or maybe they were out?)The chicken fingers had that weird slightly gummy texture like they could have been cooked a little longer. Nice crisp coating on both types of chicken but overall, I can't say it lived up to the hype. The fries were good. The sweet potatoes were some of the worst I've had and were extremely over seasoned with cloves.Maybe the food during the initial opening hours is better?

Actually everything was amazing! From the service down to their memorabilia, it was 5 stars! Willie Mae's was on a long list of restaurants we had to try when visiting NOLA--which should be on your list too! We got there about 10-15 min after they opened on a Monday morning. They open at 10AM and close at 5PM. No line! We lucked out. There were a few patrons in the front room and about 2 other patrons in the back when we were seated. It is a small restaurant, but it's not as small as the pics make it. There is counter seating of about 4-5 stools. Ordered the 3 Chicken Tenders [$15] which came with a side--got the Mac & Cheese! Yums, cheesy and cooked perfectly! It was so good I had to get another serving [$5] Also ordered the 3 sides of chicken [$10]. Omgggg the chicken skin was so light! Yes it was a bit oily, but it's so worth it! The chicken itself was so flavorful and far from dry! Mouthwatering for sure! The cornbread muffins came with 2 [$0.75] & was good, but I've tasted better.  The service was really good. Ashley made sure to check on us even if the restaurant got busy-- and it sure did.

Arrived to the location about 4:10 on a Friday afternoon. There was a line on the outside of the door at first it looked like a lot but we had nothing but time, so we stopped. Parking is in the neighborhood and is pretty limited. About 15 people were ahead of us and it took about 25 minutes before being seated. Not too bad.Our server was all over the place and kept forgetting about our table but he was busy and still kept a positive attitude, so I give him kudos for that.Now. The moment of truth. Was this the best fried chicken? Yes. It was very tasty! The 3pc mixed was fresh, very hot, and had a little kick to it. The crust was not overly crispy which I liked. For the side I chose to have the red kidney beans and rice. OMG I think I enjoyed the beans and rice more than the chicken lol I was a little upset because they were out of mashed potatoes and mac and cheese which were what I had wanted to try. Considering we went so close to closing, it wasn't a big deal. Before the chicken came I was also able to try the corn bread which was good. Moist with good flavor. Overall, I give this place 4.5 stars. -.5 only because of the overall wait. (Time arrived to the time the food came) Just go with time to be able to enjoy yourself and the company you are with.

I recommend ordering the fresh squeezed lemonade. Although there's no free refills on the lemonade, it comes in a very large glass and had just the right level of sweetness.My husband and I both ordered the three piece mixed fried chicken. It was amazing. Perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy in the center. Excellent breading to chicken ratio. I also highly recommend the mac and cheese. I don't like very creamy and running mac and cheese so this was perfect. We also split an order of fried okra and that was what we expected it to be.

I assumed it would be good fried chicken and I would shrug and say yeah it was good I guess. But let me tell you, the fried chicken is truly excellent. We tried both the dark and white meat, and I surprisingly preferred the white. The spices and flavor of the crunchy fried coating is incredible. It's not too greasy, but the crunchy coat melts in your mouth a little too. The chicken meat itself isn't dry, it's juicy and flavorful but comes right off the bone. Not only the chicken was excellent though. The sides we picked were both surprisingly great. We had the mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese. The gravy on the mashed potatoes has wonderful flavor, and the Mac and cheese is creamy and tasty. I'm really hoping we make it back before we leave on Tuesday. It was worth the hour walk (combined both ways) and hour wait in line!
