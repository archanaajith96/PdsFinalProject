No comparison with Five Guys or Cookout--this place is really good food because they use high-quality ingredients and cook everything just right. It rivals Hops. Choice of bun type. Fresh-tasting ground Angus beef and several other meat (and a vegetarian) choices.It's located in an Exxon station plaza at the intersection of Cotswold Ave.  Low-rent = low prices.The only thing missing is malteds. I want a chocolate malted. We'll probably keep going back until our doctor puts a stop to it."}, {"review_id": "YHowR-PCkYWUIpnX67IXrg", "user_id": "wCrg8GPUGMqP6fczjuM4_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "I am always up for a good burger. I am working my way through Thrillists Top 100 Burgers. This spot is not on that list but it should be. It's part of a gas station complex on a busy road. So you don't come here for the atmosphere. But if you're lucky you come here for the burger. I have been here a few times, I like to come more than once before I write a review and this place is great. There are a number of burgers on the wall menu and they are great. The burger uses excellent meat with an appropriate fat content. The burgers are in a patty but that patty is not packed too tight, many are, and that allows the juices room in the burger. The sides, well the onion rings which I ordered every time are excellent, not over battered and you get enough to share. The only complaint has been the shakes are too thick. Tea and soda are serve yourself so you can have as many refills as you want.The staff is friendly and extremely helpful. Burgers are cooked perfectly. Definitely a Top 100!"}, {"review_id": "r7HtYvv7VnT_e7I0J6HowA", "user_id": "SNKItb2KLMr6D_I5HcCvIA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "I had the smoke house.

I have been wanting to taste test the food here for a while so this time when I found myself in Greensboro, I took the the plunge and an extra 15 minutes off my route. I must agree with all the other reviews concerning the parking lot. It is VERY small and appears to stay packed. This is a good sign to me. It is usually a good sign that the food is good or cheap and filling. In this case, the food is good and filling but certainly not cheap. Two sandwiches here will set you back around $16 bucks and that is not including the fries and drinks. Here at Burger Spot, the service is super fast, fresh and I'm in love! I won't waste your time with lots of words. GO HERE! Just don't frequent to often or you will need a gym membership.FYIThey do not sell the short rib burger anymore. I was disappointed but for those who were looking to try it, we missed it."}, {"review_id": "jQX2RFhp36tIVywcFO0vcw", "user_id": "bOLe8UPUOBDHoVM4Ed7-rg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2017", "text": "How have I not reviewed BBS?  I've been coming here since they first opened.  It's nothing fancy but the food is always delicious.  Plus the prices are very reasonable, ordering is easy and the food comes out pretty fast.  I noticed on my visit tonight that they have really expanded the menu over time - they have tons of different sandwiches - chicken, Cubans, pork BBQ, two kinds of brisket, veggie burgers, Reuben's...  on and on.  The combinations of burgers and sandwiches with toppings is endless!  Plus they have milkshakes, brownies and homemade banana pudding for dessert.   Tonight I had the beef brisket sandwich with added jalapeños and fries.  So good!  I typically time my visits with good weather because I love to sit out on the patio.  BBS is just a great little joint that is part of what makes Greensboro great!"}, {"review_id": "kaNCVKFG1bTZP6G0h4CHmA", "user_id": "FsctW2UZMmWhGgF1Nt_sTg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "If you r driving on battleground looking for delicious, reasonable prices and good service head straight to Big burger spot.

I had super high hopes based on all of the awesome reviews. I think maybe it was because we were customer number 2 for the day but here is the story:Ordered the burgers we had decided on days before. Got the natural cut fries and onion rings. Side note the sauce that comes with the rings is the bomb dot com. I had my burger cooked well since I am expecting and my husband ordered himself medium well. Obviously mine cooked longer no biggie deal. We get our food in about 15 mins which is totally fine since the you know they cooked it fresh for you. I got bacon cheese hubby patty melt.The first bite of mine my senses are not assaulted by burger deliciousness but a strong lighter fluid chemical smell that masks all else. I think it could just be me so I press on about three more bites. Mean while husband enjoys his patty melt. Fries/rings are good. I begin to try a deconstruct my burger to find the source-husband tries a  bite and gets the chemical too. I ended up picking it apart and only eating the pickles. TMI but for the rest of the day each burp was tainted with the same lighter fluid chemical taste. The girl who worked the register came over to clear our plates. Which was nice but she saw my hardly touched food and asked about it. I told her the story and she said they do use charcoal and may be it was that. Nope, we cook on a Webber grill at home with charcoal and you can't beat that flavor and what was going on in my burger was not that. She did offer to have the them cook me another so I could compare the flavor but I declined as we were ready to go."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/big-burger-spot-greensboro-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
