While we sat and consumed salad and pizza, the staff was attentive and cleaned up our dishes as we emptied them. No tips. No hope of receiving a $10 on the table but simply because they are that nice and willing to serve. I've not seen bob-tipped people work that hard in a very long time. As for the restaurant: it was too warm. Warm outside plus hot ovens inside equals uncomfortably warm in the house and no way to escape it.The pizza was nothing to write home about. Wood Fired Pizza is everywhere. It's floppy and messy and honestly lacking flavor. The salads looked delicious. I wasn't hungry enough for a $25 meal.Loved the Gelato options! Yum! Double Chocolate and  Chocolate Chip Mint!"}, {"review_id": "asDCF0Zj_3j1SBvF6SJ_Ag", "user_id": "NzVyhONQ5naUYjQEVYJLZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "Food: 4/5Service: 5/5Atmosphere: 4/5Value: 3/5-------This place is awesome! A staple since I've been in high school, Zaza's Little Rock location is a popular stop for many in the area. They focus on pizza and salads, and both are great options. To date, Zaza's makes my favorite salads in the world. My favorite is the Santa Fe, which is a bit of a spin on a traditional Cobb, but there are lots of other healthy and fresh options as well. Huge portions for the large size, so be prepared. They are a bit expensive, so not as good value, but for the quality of the ingredients and the taste, I'll always give them 2 thumbs up. Pizza is also usually great. I will say the many of them feel dough-heavy, which makes it less of a great value as well, but their dough is perfect. So if you're into a perfect balance of doughy and burnt, this is the pizza for you. Service is always perfect, very friendly and helpful staff. Every table is clean almost immediately after it's cleared, and even though it's always incredibly busy at this place, it's a great vibe and a perfect place to catch up with friends."}, {"review_id": "ENHD7TQi3ROX-xuebTb-0Q", "user_id": "fWiEWyUgVqI7tJ-aLhhvtw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "ZaZa is one of my favorite places in town!

It has a modern, minimalist vibe, and it's not the best for big parties in my opinion, BUT! The pizza is a must try, prepared and cooked in a fire oven in front of you. And the salads, oh the salads. I generally eat salad because I'm supposed to, not because I necessarily want to. I'm not at the top of the food chain for nothin'. You can taste the freshness in the ingredients. The crust, sauce, cheese, toppings came together perfectly. The fire oven put a wonderful crispness to the crust, or pizza bones as we refer to them. The salad was amazing. You can order a half size or a whole. We ordered a couple of em and shared amongst the table. When you walk in, you make your way to the counter and place your order. You pay at the register then find a seat. Someone will bring your order when ready. The place was abuzz. We were a large party with a baby onboard. My anxiety was a little high based on the crowd and the tight spaces. But this place is the perfect place to stop with a couple friends to grab a great meal reasonably priced."}, {"review_id": "sHOt96xxJkmFFiVw7JmCgw", "user_id": "qxDFz2xm7l30yPW7rDgukA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Sooo good.

The line was long and there were only 4 people working but they were quick and the line moved fast. The pizza was delish and my salad was even better. The pizzas are cooked in a wood fire oven and have that crisp thin crust that's amazing! The salads are all unique and put together right in from of you, kinda like a subway does with their sandwiches. Great location that you can actually walk to or ride your bike to if you are around Cantrell."}, {"review_id": "N_RQVV7kIU1HrzHl4mvuhA", "user_id": "t9pGSMkZJjObkLccDHHn1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Ho. Ly. Cow. I didn't know what to expect when I got to Arkansas, but this gem started the trip off way right. With a wood-fire pizza kitchen, 2 stories of rustic chic, and the best southern-charm service, ZAZA did not fail to impress. I ordered a Santa Fe South salad to split with my partner, and they were able to keep it vegetarian for us. The ingredients were all so delicious. Apparently they source their ingredients from a local farmer's market. My partner got The Forager pizza. Again, holy cow. You have to try it to believe the amount of yum. I also got a glass of Kings Ridge pinot: 3 thumbs up. They make a f'rose (frozen rose margarita) in house, and while I can see the appeal, I wasn't a fan. The gelato however... Just trust me when I say you've got to give this place a try."}, {"review_id": "gERzfVgpY4Zolp5HgR6LGg", "user_id": "Z_8clYC-IkqrfHcTCjzAiA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/5/2016", "text": "Gluten Free Review+gluten free crustEh had some time to kill and was driving around the Heights and found this place, I called and asked if they had gluten free pizza and they did, so I was super syked.  Now it's a cool place hidden away behind a shopping center but it's very cozy, perfect spot to relax on a cold day. You walk in, order through a assembly line type of thing. I chose the Potato and Tomato & a Prosciutto and Arugula pizza. Thought they would be an awesome choice and tastyness, also with a glass of Prosecco. So I sat at the (mini) bar next to the gelato side, went to the bathroom and came back with my number. I waited about 20 minutes and then I had to pick up my friend and the lady overheard me say I'm waiting on my pizza, she grabbed it from the heated section and apologized. I guess it had been sitting there for 10 minutes.. nobody brought the pizza to me, so if it wasn't for my phone call I would have ended up waiting forever? Number was useless. The pizza itself, eh, maybe it was the gluten free crust that sucked but delivery pizza is better, at least on the day I went and the choices I made, it was dry, no real flavor, and lacked any actual pizza qualities. The prosecco was awesome. I'll go back but try a different pizza and get extra everything!"}, {"review_id": "r116lSbJQew1hA6AVkSNFQ", "user_id": "8OyApOAFqg_k7QUjHkqaEg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "Place looks good bad they do not know how to make a pizza, it was droopy, too much cherry tomatoes, not much flavor overall a mess"}, {"review_id": "2jXqXhrIaimU6E_3LTTgyw", "user_id": "VUZ3Mi036F9HHY2k0H0Jkw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/12/2017", "text": "Really great authentic fresh pizza and huge salad.

Then the wood fired pizza is also great. Personally I like the salads best but the pizza goes with it great.They have local beer and wine and then gelato for dessert.

But still very delighted by the pizza, quality, gelato, etc.Environment was nice too btw.  You can eat outside and they also have a nice upstairs in case it is jam packed (which it was not on a Sunday evening). Easy parking too.Clean and friendly environment.  Good customer service from gentleman at the gelato area on Sunday 9.10.17 around 5:15 pm."}, {"review_id": "QrTDOS6QsjiiaqHXN9swzQ", "user_id": "Ti5J7EXtVRHS7iEmgpaL2w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Highly overrated.
