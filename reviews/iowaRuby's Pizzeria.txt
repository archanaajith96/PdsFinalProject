As much as once a week. They do a great job of mixing up traditional favorites with funky and adventurous slices at lunch, and they post the daily selection on Facebook. I loved the Crab Rangoon, personally. They're also one of the cheapest lunches downtown, and def one of the fastest. It might not be a big deal to a lot of folks, but the place looks classy and well branded. I was surprised to learn this was locally owned as opposed to a regional chain. They really have a cohesive look and feel. The service has always been very prompt at lunch and I've never had a problem at all. I can't recommend this place enough!"}, {"review_id": "141dovA1XhHHlkDHve0wGA", "user_id": "buCAwzk8wYw-6h544Od6hw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Excellent cheesy bread... but...We've been there 3 times and each time well.over and hour for one pizza.  Sketchy wait staff and always excuses."}, {"review_id": "Zi6vuhJSFzwBSdHEJwmPhA", "user_id": "EDVIzAVqkmksEMRIp3Im3A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "This was an awesome experience I ordered the Detroit pizza with the homemade meatballs btw the pizza is amazing and I'm a trucker I know good pizza when I taste it anyways somehow something happened with the delivery guy but instead of calling it quits the manager pulled up with my pizza I worked 10 years in retail that's what you call customer service thank you so much and I hope your business keeps booming!!!"}, {"review_id": "FRjDne9XeD8af70R9ecEBQ", "user_id": "jOCfFdZRi1r87zlwqWo9rQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "As you can tell, we are more \"to go\" people.  So we phoned in our very first order.  This is honestly the first piza place that you can not get 1/2 and 1/2 when you order. (Or so I was told)  Was a little confused by that so we placed an order for a large bacon cheeseburger NY style and a small taco NY style.  The crust is VERY thin... in fact so thin it doesn't support eating as a slice.  We busted out the forks and continued to dig in.  Both tasted ok, but I can honestly say there wasn't anything about their pizza that makes me want to run right back and grab another.  I was expecting really great pizza when I have seen all the reviews.  If you haven't tried it, do so, but I'd be curious to see if a different crust may be better next time. My teenager even said the same thing and he loves any pizza. Maybe next time...if we venture to try it again."}, {"review_id": "TBZZQgJ5ek5nKwVGSRoKnA", "user_id": "qwYq-gXP0-OCypjZgZP_UA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "This place is so cute!

And you get a pretty big slice for $3...not a bad deal. They also offer salads, and they have a small selection of beer. I haven't been here during suppertime, but it's a good place to get a quick bite for lunch.

Based off the reviews and pictures it was highly regarded so my coworker and I decided to give it a shot. Pretty appetizing menu for a pizza place. Not to much, not to little, just your right amount and straight to the point which is pizza! We decided to go with Chicago style (deep dish style of course!) Had pepperoni and sausage toppings and it was incredible. It isn't Chicago of course but damn good. Service was good considering we were the only customers in there, but the service was excellent considering! Highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "L7F0jNB7xivmAzVLU5wNKQ", "user_id": "1tfmaUdtHwWqxSM6-75Vug", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/13/2017", "text": "It's OK. Affordable. Fast and friendly service. Skywalk makes it a great option for those not wanting to battle the fridigt cold like I did. Convenient location. A bit on the colder side inside and I could have done without the mix if country music and jingle bells.

What a nostalgic throwback for me. After living out west where the best pizza generally comes from Papa Murphy's, walking into Ruby's reminded me of what a good pizza place should feel like. The smells, sounds, and the look of the place let you know it's where people get together to share a good pie. After perusing the menu for a bit, I was informed about a secret \"off the menu\" pizza, the Crab Rangoon. I've never in my life had a pizza like that, although I've tasted some funky stuff in Asia. I'm not sure what's in the secret sauce, but it was freaking amazing. And the crunch of the fries wonton pieces? Wow! The taste and texture of the Crab Rangoon is incredible! If your in the mood for a new and different slice of deliciousness, order that. I'm going to try the Taco or Cheeseburger pizza next time I visit."}, {"review_id": "XJ45PSbHy645oeFJszxO4A", "user_id": "V8SGOMp06vts-tCvh6RLXQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/27/2016", "text": "Recommended by a friend.

The small kitchen area behind the counter tells the tale of what goes on here. A medium chicago style is more than enough for several other meals for one person, could feed 3 with ease. The Chicago style has the sauce on top with deeper crusts. They also have New York and Detroit style as well.   Beer and stuff to wash it down, I didnt dine in so can't comment on selection or pricing. The pie itself wasn't the cheapest but came heavy and hot (ohhhh baby) and the wait was worth it. 50 minutes from order to ready, so be prepared to have some family time or call ahead. Would be a great spot for a pre-show meal."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/rubys-pizzeria-cedar-rapids?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
