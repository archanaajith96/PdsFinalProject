The atmosphere is great, people are great and the brisket and ribs are super great! I am somewhat of a bbq aficionado, I have been to multiple bbq cook offs in multiple states and these guys/gals would rank among the best! I was also surprised at the price! I would easily pay double for bbq this good in my home town. A do not miss for sure if your in wichita and want some good bbq! Don't skim the menu so fast you miss the bloody Mary like I did!"}, {"review_id": "aH8co5jIJ_ibWgLrGzjTbQ", "user_id": "UtFyET1Q2oxKsnAdmvbOZw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "First visit and I definitely enjoyed it. I went with my wife and adult daughter They had both been there a few times before.  The atmosphere was very nice.  I visited at lunch time on a weekday and there was plenty of seating. No to say there wasn't a small crowd they have plenty of seating. We waited to be seated and drink orders were taken right away. The menu is has a good variety of BBQ choices. The waitress was very pleasant and answered the few questions I had. I ordered the chopped brisket with hot links sandwich on a bun with pasta salad.  You have a choice of bun or Texas toast and a ample choice of sides. The sandwich was as very good not fatty and had good flavor. The smoke flavor was not super sweet or over powering. The pasta salad was decent. I think they could use a little less mayo but again it was decent. There is a cold bar with pickles, onions, peppers etc it was a nice selection. The price is typical BBQ but definitely worth it. I would recommend this place. I will definitely be returning."}, {"review_id": "t2YvBYJkCp0AM3YyWleO1w", "user_id": "EsF1wR4pzYwbuOF5y4Ws3w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Food was pretty good but I prefer Rib Crib. Im giving it 3 stars for service. Our waitress wasn't getting our order right and we spoke clearly. I'm assuming it's the ear piece the staff wears so she wasn't fully engaged in taking our order. When we got our food, she still messed up on one of the sides-No big deal. When we asked her for a refill of coke, she brought water so we had to correct her again and wait quite a bit. It was difficult to get her attention when we needed just 2 items but when it came time to pay, she made sure to hover over us and wait for her tip. She barely gave us room to exit our booth. The prime rib was dry and you only get enough aujus for 1/2 of your prime rib unless you want to pay more."}, {"review_id": "WintTW7yq1EjoWinIt63gQ", "user_id": "BRcgHLkCDMr-oIurtdlGcQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "Seriously?

Not phenomenal. I sampled wings, brisket, and smoked turkey breast. Dinosaur BBQ in NY Jack Stack in KC are a few places that come to mind with a higher quality of meat. Brisket was slightly tough for something smoked 18 hours. I'm guessing this is from the quality of beef but possibly their smoking process. Turkey was \"smokey tasting\" but unimpressive. The wings were average but unimpressive. Overall an average place that is suitable, but it is not a \"must visit place\" when I come to Wichita."}, {"review_id": "y5Fl-4IBBjz8U5o6cdHB-A", "user_id": "qNjOMqxAvYLnczpeIxswiQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Came here with 3 friends and got the 3 meat platter with the pulled pork, turkey, and brisket.

It's a really cool little spot on the very edge of Old Town. I love the exposed old brick walls juxtaposed with the more modern art pieces on display and apparently for sale. Plenty of seating options and lots of room to navigate. As with other bbq joints you get hit with the aroma as you approach the front door. Super nice touch that the larger than life, former-marine looking owner swung by to see how we were doing. Great touch!"}, {"review_id": "JuuU9fu3C6qiW_8ZHALlJQ", "user_id": "fL005WNiykEgIxq37BHHkA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Had a big party so made reservations at the BMB - they were able to accommodate us fairly well, and the service was quite good despite the need for three large tables. They have an alcove near their little pickle station which also houses some variations on hot cucumbers, jalapeños, and hot sauces and condiments, which fit the party fairly well. Our party partook in the ribs, various Tex-mex fair, and the pulled pork and chicken dishes - all were very good although there was more than one comment about the small amounts of salsa within the meal. Regardless the aforementioned pickle bar was appreciated and the spicy cucumbers were excellent."}, {"review_id": "KeGPMRvQuQ0peV2tYF5asQ", "user_id": "MSNkXUxHIcpgHQ8wQhIVWg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Nastiest nachos I've ever had in my entire life.  After trying two chips and giving up, I went to the ladies room.  There was feces all over the toilet.

My ribs tasted the way that mothballs smell. Very. Off putting. 3 ribs was more than I could eat.  Coleslaw was the side I selected which was very bland.  On a good note - both the mild & spicy sauces were delicious!   The link sausage was also very good although doubtful they were made in house (not advertised as such, just an observation). We ordered several appetizers including the BBQ nachos & ripple chips (which I thought would be rippled) that were tasty.  I sampled various dishes that my colleagues selected and honestly didn't care for any of them.  I'm not used to pulled pork that is served wet and the brisket although flavorful was quite dry.  I might try somewhere else for BBQ before trying this place again but I'd give it another go.  I believe in second chances."}, {"review_id": "r-wa5TWh2LY8pKTgm65s2A", "user_id": "HGS88iPSAI0mAN_wffyRqw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "8/3/2017", "text": "BBQ was good and the wings were over cooked. And our  waitress charged us for plate sharing $2. That wasn't on the menu and they didn't even split our meal for us. So we were basically charged for a plate. Then she charged us for an extra dressing with our wings and we only got one and never asked for extra. When you start to charge your customers for the basic items you need to eat your meal you may have to look into what you are doing and why. Maybe she was just trying to get her ticket price up because we split a meal. Idk but it's still bad for business. I wouldn't say it was the best BBQ in Kansas but I would say they are the worst when it comes to nickel and dimming their customers"}, {"review_id": "r0HWEX1IvcdyZuT00NDZEg", "user_id": "sWTO7SOSKqtYlgz3VQFF4A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Driving through to Arizona and wanted some bbq, this place had some good reviews.

But Bite Me has its place among lots of the big hitters.So for me, I judge a BBQ place by three things: brisket, beans, and sauce. I know, I know, there's lots more to BBQ, but those are my baselines. Bite Me brisket: the sliced brisket is very flavorful, moist but not dripping, and very tender. Thick slices cut across the grain fall apart easily and chew even easier.Bite Me Beans: Meh. They're OK, not representative of either of their signature sauces, and have plenty of meat interspersed. They could be better.Bite Me Sauce: the regular sauce is very flavorful, sweet but not syrupy, and has a background of heat that is understated. The spicy sauce announces itself quickly but is not overpowering and complements the smoke flavor of the brisket. Sauces are worth the take home bottles that can be purchased.Overall, pretty good place. Service wasn't too sharp when I was there, but a decent bar and plenty of seating helped that out."}, {"review_id": "QVwgZCl0FptmpdDed9NAyw", "user_id": "bygcf8KCjLoYPxWm2G3tNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/7/2017", "text": "WOW!!   Now we are talking BBQThe best ribs in Wichita -- no question about it.It's a little pricey -- but it's worth it for great BBQ"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/bite-me-bbq-wichita-2?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
