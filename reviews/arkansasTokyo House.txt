It's a 7 hour drive but knowing that we get to go to Tokyo House even one time while we are there makes it all that much more rewarding. I can't believe I'm saying this but I finally like a Buffet!!! It's an all self serve asian fusion buffet heaven up in this place, their food production cycles very fast so nothing sits under any heating lamps longer than it has to. Their seafood selection is outstanding and also incredibly delicious. In my experience a lot of buffet style places get a bad rep from me but this one takes the cake (in the good way, even though they don't really have cake). They have this little sushi island with amazing assortments of sushi, sashimi, salads and raw fish dishes. They also have a beautiful dessert section. It is a bit pricey, at around 20$ a person roughly from what I remember, but at the end of the day I can always look forward to coming here when I visit my family out of state."}, {"review_id": "eqyvT2R2CWpYx8L39KrWWw", "user_id": "ofr2B-0VtKkqGfaug9aBsA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "The taste wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad; kinda hot or miss, like another reviewer said. There was a good selection.  There's something wrong with the tofu - there's a sharp chemically taste to it. The seaweed salad is the only thing I tried that actually tasted Japanese. There were a couple good fish dishes - tilapia and salmon. I liked the mackerel sushi but not the salmon, though it looked good. They could really call it 'China and Sushi House'. Minus two stars for how much it is. They should have a 'one plate price' for people who can't eat that much at one time or something. I also think they should have fortune cookies. Just because. For the price, and especially if you're not a huuuge eater, I'd go to Kemuri."}, {"review_id": "dS0BY5RYwk-kcpmJbGd3dA", "user_id": "dRte-WAkgD_b_HlycuP-Mg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "TL;DR Review: Place is awesome. Put aside your notions about buffet sushi and give it a shot.Amazing.  Simply amazing.  You walk in, you're sat by the courteous staff, you throw your coat in the booth, and you go get your plate to fill at the gigantic buffet.  Then, walking down the line saying to yourself, \"two of these... three of these... ew, that looks weird; only one of those...  three of these...\" you look at your plate and no longer recognize it.  \"This is NOT the plate I had when I approached this bar!  These are not my rolls!  There's no way I can eat all of that sushi!\"  Then you go rejoin your coat at your booth, and you eat.  You eat ALL of that sushi.  And you love it.  Some things better than others; that weird thing you grabbed?  Yeah, that tastes almost as weird as it looked.  But it's okay, because it didn't cost you any additional outlay of currency, barter, or trade.  You leave its remnants on your plate and go get another one.  Try again.  Get another plate.  This time you don't go toward the sushi; this time you pass the sushi and go where the egg rolls are.  Where they've got the chicken teriyaki.  The shrimp tempura.  Everything there isn't quite as impressive.  It's good, it's totally edible; it's just not as good as all-you-can-eat sushi.  Oh.  A word about quality:  The sushi is hit-and-miss.  Some rolls you'll try will be \"not quite as good\" as you're used to at your favorite sushi restaurant.  OTHER rolls, I do not jest, will be BETTER.  ALL of the rolls are good, but some are great.  This is not one of those \"I'm at a Chinese buffet that also serves sushi\" type situations.  This is professional, hand-rolled-in-front-of-you sushi.  Though this lunch was a duet with my wife, on the way out I had to ask what their rates were for children.  I was told that my son would be free (he's 3) and my daughter would be between $5-$9 depending on the day and shift.  Wow.  I love this place."}, {"review_id": "P8gD3jAW8eMKxaj785b32w", "user_id": "ihbXFAXYtByqJaTcvhqKPA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/29/2017", "text": "first of all, let me just brag on how good the green tea ice cream is. my coworkers told me about this place, so me and my cousin decided to go one Saturday evening. they have all you can eat oysters and crab legs on the buffet. i'm not a huge fan of sushi but they had a sushi that had bananas and strawberries that were fantastic.the lower part of the buffet was my favorite. they also had jellyfish salad and some other food that was on the top level."}, {"review_id": "rM9qkZua247Vif_27-Mu0Q", "user_id": "v10TN8MwKrTOkpg67-Mq0A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/10/2017", "text": "This Japanese/Chinese/Korean buffet is one of our favorite stops in Little Rock, especially if we're not sure what we want. It is a big buffet with a large cold section offering nigiri and sushi rolls as well as a wide assortment of salads and seafood. A few steps down and there is another large buffet serving hot mostly Chinese and Korean dishes. I can fill up a plate of just their vegetables, fresh, perfectly cooked and tasty! If you have room, there is also a bar that contains desserts and fruit to complete the meal. The prices, both for lunch and dinner are extremely reasonable and they offer beer and wine for those who are interested. The location is not the most visible or convenient but that doesn't seem to matter as they place is always busy!"}, {"review_id": "nx4Tcwhn38HoUY3K7Q9Ekg", "user_id": "-HtSaAdQymjq_-RWP7TFzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "I've eaten at 5 other Asian restaurants in Arkansas and all of them were terrible.

This is hands down one of the best sushi selections I've ever had on a buffet. There were several rolls to choose from along with other additions like seaweed salad, kimchi, and octopus. If I lived in the area, I would definitely come back. The sushi offerings were actually better than the hot offerings on the buffet. There weren't as many things as I see on typical Chinese buffets, but all of the staples were there- fried rice, lo mein, sweet and sour meats, meats with broccoli, etc. Usually a lot of Chinese/Japanese buffets include American options, but I didn't see any (and I don't count that against them). That may matter to people with children. I was too stuffed to get ice cream, but again, this place was solid on the sushi options. It was a great value."}, {"review_id": "DOSXWQeumnfq67C12gjaaA", "user_id": "D1BjnlvE0UDIjubvYkwI5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "Definitely the best sushi I've had on a buffet.

The most amazing feature of this buffet is the sushi selection located on the upper level. The sushi chefs prepare a large and varied selection that disappear quickly and restocked as quickly. On the weekend I understand from my coworkers they have crab legs, shrimp and other seafood. This is definitely a place to return to over and over. They also have wine by the glass or bottle, a bit overpriced but with the selection this place provides a great value and great food."}, {"review_id": "pL55qoHxbrJU2SYLKK4Slg", "user_id": "QX69ycu5mv2QgFc7q6LvSw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/27/2017", "text": "This is one of the best buffets i've been to.

About time!I've been trying to make my way here for almost two years, since I first heard about it, and everything from the weather to bad timing had me passing it up for other options. But, I finally tried it!So, what is Tokyo House? It's a Chinese/sushi/Korean BBQ buffet. As happens when I make it to a buffet, I get one giant plate with a little bit of everything, so here's a quick rundown of what I did like, and what maybe didn't quite make the cut:The Good!It's a heck of a deal, an all-you-can-eat buffet for around $12 per person (for lunch), and with a huge number of options. I'm told the food is quite a bit better for dinner, but it bumps to closer to $20/person.I really enjoyed the Soba noodles, the hawaiian chicken, the korean BBQ pork, sweet & sour pork, the spicy green beans, spicy cucumber slices (super spicy!), dynamite roll, shrimp rolls... Heck, I even enjoyed the orange Jello :)Also, I give an extra special nod to the green tea or red bean ice cream. It's included in the buffet, and it's quite good if you like that kind of thing. The red bean threw me for a loop, it was so close to strawberry, but just enough *not* that that almost made it weirder. The green tea ice cream was definitely green tea!Oh! Oh! And you know that pickled ginger that always comes with sushi, but you never get enough? Well, there's a giant bowl of it here. Go nuts!The Bad...Well, for starters, that \"Tuna\" sure wasn't tuna. It wasn't bad, and it was still sushi, but Tuna is Tuna and that wasn't. A number of the sushi rolls felt similar, they weren't bad, but they were a little chewier and less flavorful than one might hope for.  But, as other reviews have said, you don't really come here for sushi at lunch. They have it, and it's fun to get some, but what makes this place good is the particularly impressive selection and quality of the non-sushi stuff.I would be willing to bet that the sushi at dinner is very good, so I'll have to be back to try it out!"}, {"review_id": "fVLpmdA68qtwDK34qnmmEQ", "user_id": "Tj-MSoDlfpM8Zv7_4qpzFA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/18/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Another wonderful meal at the tokyo house.
