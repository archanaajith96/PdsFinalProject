Tons of reviews, so I'll *try* to keep this short & sweet. My kiddo & I got there shortly after they opened for brunch on a Saturday morning. She arrived before me, but when I walked in I was greeted and they pointed me to the right table. Water was already waiting and our server wasn't far behind to see if I wanted anything besides water. I wanted to try a few thing and the kiddo was down to split an order of waffles. She considered the Brunch club but feared the onions. I knew already I was indulging in carbs so ordered the brunch club with breakfast potatoes and she went with the Southern Breakfast. EVERYTHING was delicious! It ranged from good, to stupid amazing. I forced her to try a bite of my brunch club because it was so delicious and even with the onions, she was impressed! We couldn't eat it all because the portions are massive (and the prices more than reasonable!), but my daughter was more than happy to take the leftovers for a future meal. In fact, she got mad because I had to have one more bite of the waffle! So if you're reading this... just stop... and GO EAT AT IRON DOG DINER!"}, {"review_id": "r3s-ByZqH4w6M1KOyZ3gdw", "user_id": "6H4Zj-c7FqM9mCsXvwaEQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "I have had the pleasure of eating at Iron Dog twice in the last couple of weeks.  Both meals were unique and delicious.  On the first visit I had the meatloaf with the fried okra and broccoli salad.  The meatloaf was very good and the tangy sauce it was topped with was the perfect addition.  The fired okra was crunchy and delicious but wished there was some pepper vinegar available to add to it.  The broccoli salad was also very good - a simple but healthy delicious side!    For my second visit I wanted to have their chicken and waffles.  This would be my first chicken and waffles so my buddy recommended I try it at Iron Dog as theirs was one of the best in Charleston.  When it arrived I could tell I was in for a treat.  I covered it with the maple syrup and then put all of the delicious hot sauce on top too.  Wow who knew this could be so good!   I was tearing into this treat as if someone was going to steal it from me.  Before I knew what happened the plate was empty.  I was full and very satisfied with my new found favorite meal.     The service here is very good as the waiter was attentive and very friendly.  The inside has an eclectic feel and reminds me of diners of yesteryear.  A fun place to come get some outstanding food.  Looking forward to my 2nd chicken waffles and also trying more from the menu!!!"}, {"review_id": "VLgQ7AeF03mpuwf8AQnVDA", "user_id": "K2sB64T3p1tcgThE5OJLEw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "My little one and I impulsively stopped in today for lunch. It's a cute little place- Definitely mid century modern vibe going on.It was pretty empty when we went (around 12:30) which surprised me. We chose a tiny booth and we were immediately greeted by the server. She was wonderful. We ordered the Monte Cristo and the House fried chicken sandwich, both with fries. The Monte Cristo wasn't bad at all... lots of turkey and the jam was tasty. It was a tad soggy, but overall pretty good. Fries were good too. A bit salty but would have been perfect if I had accepted the ketchup They offered.Let's talk about the House sandwich though. This may be .the best. fried chicken sandwich I've ever had. It was delicious. The tomato jam was addictive and the house made pickles and aioli were insanely good. It has ruined me for all other chicken sandwiches- my new gold standard. I will definitely be back- next time I'd like to try some dessert too!"}, {"review_id": "hFyG4ySLInmyDWNzuqjSJA", "user_id": "Hkf1Louo_WA_oNghgut4gw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "Walking in, this restaurant definitely has a really cute diner feel. It's very open with eclectic seating, and a small bar by the register and bakery case. I visited during brunch and decided to order the frittata with pork belly hash. I have to say that I wasn't that impressed with this frittata itself compared to others I've had. It was quit thin and didn't seem to have any cheese or real flavor. The hash however, was very good. I loved the salty bits of pork belly as well as the onion and wilted spinach. To me, it just seemed to be more of a hash dish as oppose to a frittata dish. The service was a bit slow as well. We weren't checked on often so I was left with an empty cup of coffee that by the time he came back around to offer a refill we were ready to leave. I'm also not sure how I feel about paying out at the register without an order ticket in hand so that you can see it will be rung up with the correct order. It's as if they just remember your order at the register. But mistakes do happen so I'd rather catch it before reaching the cashier. Paying at the register is not an issue but I think it would serve them and the customers better if the server dropped the order ticket to each table or party first so that they can see their order and amount to be charged, then take it with them to the register when they are ready."}, {"review_id": "abf02otkd_mBn1lRfhsphg", "user_id": "3Rh4z7OoZQoH6LXgh783YA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "I had the best omelette ever!  It was so tasty, I contemplated ordering another, but talked myself out of it.   Not sure what it was called, but it had cheddar cheese, onions, sweet peppers and bacon instead of ham.

The Chef didn't skimp on the pork belly and the hash was fantastic and super flavorful.  My husband ordered the chicken and waffles, and again, outstanding  flavor.  I loved that it came with a shot of maple syrup and tasting spoon of hot sauce; what a great touch.  My son ordered the Dutch baby apple fritter pancake and ate every bite, yum!  The Chef came out during our meal to check on our food and other tables.  You can tell this place is his baby and he takes care of it.  The menu was small and I would bet every dish was as good as what we tried.  I seriously hope Triple D does not find them as it tends to ruin these neighborhood gems.  When in Charleston, definitely check this place out!"}, {"review_id": "Y72byDWVsPaaNZhkqa6law", "user_id": "Mv-tTQBKj-j_Eu0Og_8fwg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Quite possibly my most favorite/ delicious meal while visiting Charleston!!!

After we sat down she immediately asked us what we would like to drink. We were presented with the brunch menu which has the breakfast options such as sandwiches and meals. I decided on the frittata but unfortunately they were out of breakfast potatoes and offered to do it with zucchini instead. I declined and decided to go with the chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits and the Dutch baby. The chicken and waffles were served with the syrup and hot sauce on the side with a crispy looking chicken breast sitting on top of two semi thin waffles. I decided to drench everything in the syrup first. The chicken was very tender and a crispy with a small amount of seasoning. I would prefer a little more seasoning but overall the dish was pretty good. Very simple version of this dish. The shrimp and grits were very good. The gravy is what makes the dish. I was very pleased and so was my guy. We decided to take the Dutch baby home for later.

She checked on us just the right amount of times as well; sometimes waitresses can be a bit much. Service was fast. The cook came out and asked us how the food was which is really cool.

On the inside the place is big and roomy with an odd collection of restaurant tables and chairs.  It reminds me of a yard sale. The staff was real friendly and took care of me as soon as I sat at the \"bar\". I liked the rock playing in the background. The place was nice and clean. I ordered the unsweet tea and it was perfect. The menu was not huge and I focused on a sandwich for lunch. I ordered the caprese with fried chicken. I think I wasn't supposed to order it that way but the waiter said I could have it any way I wanted. What a fabulous sandwich. Simple but with big flavor. The fried chicken was done to perfection, juicy and great crispy crust. The  ciabatta bread was fresh and held together well the arugula and tomato was fresh the mozzarella cheese melted all over was gooey and delicious. Even the balsamic on it was perfect. Glad I ate it here instead of trying to eat it in the car. That would have been messy. I am once again thankful to the yelping community for writing up this place so I could find it after several hours in airports to get here. I was going to do 4 stars but the food pushed it to 5.

This place is delicious to say the least. The interior design is quirky and bright with vintage pieces thrown in around the room - I couldn't stop taking photos. But...the food...y'all...it was delish. The place is cheap with nothing exceeding $11.75. We decided on the biscuits and gravy, shrimps and grits, and pork belly hash side. I honestly would go back for the pork belly hash alone - if you go, get it. The shrimp and grits had a different twist to it than I've had before but it was still oh so amazing. Service was good and fast and we were in and out within about 40 minutes.

My first time having them anywhere so nothing to compare too. I don't typically like waffles so usually steer clear, but this seemed to be their staple dish so had to try. Glad I did. The only thing I'd do different next time is ask them to not put butter on the waffles. The ones that did get it were really soggy. I liked the ones that didn't get it on them. The syrup was so cute in the mini jar bottle and very tasty. The chicken was really juicy and I didn't need anything else with it, which is surprising for me. :) The unsweet tea was good, but costs 2.50, so was a bit surprised at that. The chicken and waffles was 10.75 and I felt the portion size really was just right. Seemed small when it came compared to what restaurants usually do, piling extra stuff on your plate, but I liked the clean presentation and size. I left satisfied, not feeling like I was going to die from so much food. My bf was happy with his selection - but he can tell you in his review ;) lol The staff was great, very very nice. Diner setting but yet was cleaner than what you'd expect for that area. So I was very pleased with that.

It was on the newer side then, but oh so good. First off, try the Vietnamese coffee. Perfect amount of sweet to coffee. Get a cinnamon roll that's fresh out of the oven. Almost as good as Wildflour, but different in that it's not a full meal (which is good because you'll want to have room for the all star breakfast line up). The food was great. I went for the chicken and waffles and it did not disappoint. One of my girlfriends got the shrimp and grits and it was so good. I tend to not order them because it's a dish I can actually make and make well, but these were good. There's parking in front and on the side. Our waitress was super sweet, but she could have come by more often for refills.
