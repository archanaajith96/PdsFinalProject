We noticed this dining establishment was rated number 1 on yelp, so my roommate and I wanted to try this place.First of all our server Steven was very knowledgeable, and informative with everything on the menu. I ordered the trout with bok choy, my roomie the cauliflower bolognese, and we shared the angry Mac & cheese. Everything was delicious. One thing I was disappointed with, was we found out later that they had a chefs table, and he could make anything we wanted, and the speakeasy bowling alley!!! Wish we knew so we could've checked everything out. Oh well, we'll be back next year for our annual seminar."}, {"review_id": "6ygbEgHy9DyC9y6KMxlXfA", "user_id": "GaRYHh7BVd_NrU2Ie2X62w", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Overpriced and underwhelming food.

I recently stopped by for lunch and we decided to split the burger.. So the bun in its large awesomeness was good by itself and with the burger wasn't too bad but the sauce.. It was really quite good, but I could have used more of it or even a side of it in case you were a blue cheese nut.. And seriously I counted one mushroom thinly sliced and .. humm.. Ya.. For the size of that bun, they should have had that thing a sticky hot mess! And I hate to say even thought it was really good a tomato and maybe a pickle on that sucker would just bring it into the burger world and finish that sucker off! SO.. ask for more sauce and thank me for that... So I also got the onion soup to snack on and I would have to say it was what i was hoping for.. I hate to say it was made out of a bunch of packets, and some real onions, (it probably was) but this was the REALLY good stuff.. Like lots and lots of well cut onions.. big... small.. medium... ya! and just the right amount of breaded crutons soaking up all that onion soup.. Flavor was great, my only meh was there wasn't enough cheese on it.. There was a pretty decent size glob, but I like the ones that are a bit more cheese than you would expect, but not too much to make you feel like you are chewing curd.... The the fries are those reallly thin style fries which really annoy me, but werent horrible.. Why do they annoy me you ask.. b/c they get cold very quickly.. they are so thin!Need something else to give me that 5.. but i'd still stop by and eat and have a drink here with friends..."}, {"review_id": "FBq9SfxHxn467Uh87jRNVw", "user_id": "TQADkEroJOsSShK-gONV_g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Everything was fantastic!

Is it bad that I pine to live in a space that's reminiscent of an upscale drinking establishment? At least it's classy.Everyone gets the burger and understandably so. Especially when it's half price after 9. It looks decadent like a true tavern burger should be. However I ordered the beef goulash and am not regretting a single bite. Similar to a stroganoff, only with a red sauce instead of cream. The beef was tender, juicy and full of meaty flavor. Perfect for a cool fall evening, and pairs well with a glass of Cab Franc.White linen tablecloths, extremely knowledgeable servers and curated artwork on the walls makes this Tavern feel like a throwback to a place/time where people dressed up just a little to leave the house and dining out was a special occasion. But not so stuffy that you can't order a beer and a burger."}, {"review_id": "mLvJqe_EXo3WS1hhjnyVEw", "user_id": "kVt96BKgLo0gehgS4jAZwg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/28/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Can't help but love this place (even when service at the bar is a bit lacking--nothing major, but we kept having to get the bartenders' attention).  :(We stopped in for a late bite and sat at an almost vacant bar.   Ordered the obligatory (for me) Bengali Gimlet and our traditional order of olives (divine)!!!!I always have my mind set on ordering a Tavern Burger but the menu always side-tracks me.  This time I ordered a kale salad (which had transformed a bit from my memory) and the angry mac 'n cheese (both side orders).  It turned out to be a tasty combination.  (The mac 'n cheese is indeed angry and spicy---may not be for all palates.)  The Hubs ordered his regular--the burger.  Tasty as usual."}, {"review_id": "n-5zzJcMyjY0kVC2cOdFRA", "user_id": "rUin-Da2jkNoG8RfTyko7Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Simply not impressed. Went for brunch after church with my Grandma. First and foremost I am from Austin we take brunching very seriously and when there is literally no one in a so called \"amazing brush spot\" that's a sign it's probably not that great. Service was subpar...food was something I could make at home, and for being in trendy little area of Tulsa they don't really meet the demands of dietary needs.

I'm staying in the Brady District and based on multiple recommendations from numerous sources my companion and I decide to eat dinner at Tavern.It is chilly out, 24 degrees. We had walked from our hotel and the short distance left us shivering. The place was packed and clearly popular. There was no host in sight, I asked the bartender how to be seated. He immediately responded, came out from behind the bar and found us a table. I was glad to settle and thaw.I like the decor, it faintly reminds me of a place in Fulton MO, where I have visited a few times while attending the annual Churchill lecture series (that's where he gave his Iron Curtain speech). But, as I say it was full/crowded, and noisy. This makes it difficult to have a conversation, especially if one's companion is hard of hearing. Oh, it was also 'tavern' dark.Our server was not long in presenting herself and providing menus. She also brought water, the water tasted as though it had been filtered, it tasted good.I like the menu selection. The fans who recommended Tavern had said all the food items are made in-house. Pickles, charcuterie and cheeses are part of the selection. I made a mental note, that there were several items I'd want to sample on a return visit. (On retrospect, maybe not.)The server had asked for our drink order, it seemed to me that not ordering alcohol may have altered the attitude towards us. Though the demeanor continued to be pleasant, there was no effort to make suggestions even though I noticed the server for the table next to us did and I had to specifically request descriptions.My companion ordered a hamburger and I selected the fish and chips. I also inquired into the Hoppin John. That item the server did describe, as not--being black-eyed peas (which IS what Hoppin John is all about) but rather small red beans. I ordered it anyways to give it a try.The table next to us, who though they arrived much later than us, received their order quickly as my companion and I awaited ours. I inquired of the neighbor's waitstaff person whether we could order something to eat, interim. He said he'd find our server (who didn't appear).After additional time passed our dinner was served. The hamburger looked excellent while my fish and chips, not so much. The server had used the word 'plump' when I asked her to describe the fish--this was not plump, it was nearly 'squished' thin. My companion offered the opportunity to sample the burger and it was excellent, very good meat (oh, except that it was ordered medium and was very much closer to rare), served on a lovely egg bun. My fish, did not taste like cod, it seemed more similar to catfish and on the 'squished' dry side. The fries, were unpalatable, as though they had sat too long so were refried, then, they sat again longer still--they were neither hot nor fresh (or palatable). (Neither were my companion's string fries, ick.) I tried the Hoppin John and was equally disappointed. It seemed to be more like (I cannot think of the name of the Creole dish) a red bean mush than the (traditionally NOT mushy black-eyed peas) cooked legumes served over white rice of which I'm accustomed.Our neighbors noticed (my) disappointment and commented on it, engaging us in conversation. Clearly, they were exceptionally pleased with their own meal and were concerned on our behalf.I ended up completely disappointed and dissatisfied. Not just a little bit but completely. (Ummm, for me, the water was the best item.)"}, {"review_id": "GWX851WSM174p--fIOINGQ", "user_id": "1yg2fxUfTB-qLykvE3FY_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2017", "text": "The Tavern is truly delicious!

But honestly, the highlight of the evening was by far, the cocktails, specifically, the Bengali Gimlet. I have never tasted anything like it, and three months after that evening my husband still talks about it. We do not usually spend that much on a meal out, but it was a special occasion.

I don't remember what my fiance said but he really liked it and ate every bit. I will definitely come back here for their burger special because it is one of my very favorite Burgers of all time.
