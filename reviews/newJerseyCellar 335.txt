When i finally found a spot my friend had already started drinking a fancy drink (see photo) and we had to wait for our other friend to find parking before getting our reserved table. They thankfully did not cancel the reservation. The outside is so unassuming and the lights are so low giving either romantic or chill vibes- whichever you're in the mood for. We had the edamame, garlic shrimp, avocado rice and steak and all of it was delicious! We also shared the \"flame girl\" bowl drink which was appropriately strong.I had a desert cocktail also that was great and the service was excellent including comped shots for a slight mishap in our order. Dave was our server and sat with us a couple of times giving us suggestions on where to go afterwards and answering all of our silly questions. Overall you should definitely come here for a date or a friends night like I did but prepare to drop some coins and don't drive if you can avoid it!"}, {"review_id": "Zc_qT4qbMJBTTREjTLWQNg", "user_id": "-ZhhlENaEtObyy-j13rZaA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Great food, awesome ambiance, and good service. We came here for my cousins birthday and pretty much ordered the entire menu (their menu is on the smaller side). We started with some really exotic drinks, punch bowls that could serve about 5-6 people- one of them had a flame in the middle!The stand out dishes were the korean bbq wings, they were so crispy and delicious. We also loved the corn bread that had this cheddar cheese topping, it was amazing. The branzino fish was very delicious as well, it was light with a curry broth. The avocado fried rice was definitely a top contender. I would stay away from the fries...they were REALLY salty. We had to send them back.As for the desserts, they were very average. The ice cream sandwiches were a cool concept because you get four small ones, all different flavors but nothing special."}, {"review_id": "VfjEG7XyHmOP3KwAjRrrkA", "user_id": "LKZFYrpAtW9NJRY1vYc5DA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "The vibe of this place is great. I went with a group of 7 and we were seated at a round table in the middle. The decor, presentation, and especially the service is fantastic. The staff was exceptionally kind to us and catered to our needs and also our complaints very effectively.I found the food to be pretty fresh. Every dish has a kick of spice + sweetness to it, which I guess is the flavor of the genre of cuisine, but it wasn't my cup of tea personally. Regardless, I enjoyed the food. The Avacado Fried Rice was my favorite.The drinks here are fantastic. We ordered two of the \"large format\" drinks (Fire Dancer and Zombie Priest Punch) which can be shared with multiple people. The presentation is fun and the drinks are potent and flavorful.The desserts were alright. I was looking forward to the chocolate mousse but it was too heavy for a mousse.

The drinks are on point - cocktails are reasonably priced, and provide an array of classic and creative options. And ask which ones come in the fun glasses - like parrots and pineapple glasses! I ordered the Smoldering Bastard ($11), a dark rum old fashioned. And fiancée ordered Bird is the Word, which was a rum drink served in a parrot glass.All of the food we ordered was really incredible - such a nice surprise!

I've tried to book a table at this location for quite some time now! Here's a tip: If you're planning on trying it - book your table well in advance. I booked a table for 10:00pm on a Saturday night at 4:00pm that same day. This place is super busy! That's a good sign! Now to the ambiance! Cellar 335 is literally a cellar on Newark Ave. Its super edgy, dimly light and filled with amazing art on the walls. They were also playing really good music.The staff was friendly and super helpful. The manager was walking around checking on tables & our waiter was funny and on point! I think his name was Rafael.Everything that I tried was absolutely delicious! I wasn't going to try this location because of the few bad reviews I read on here but I am SO glad I ignored them LOL. It was definitely worth it! Please keep in mind that the portions are a bit small. It's mentioned several times here on Yelp so I wasn't shocked when we received our food.We started off with the Spicy Cornbread! It was so moist and flavorful. We then moved on to the BAO. I had a veggie Bao and my husband had the Short Rib Bao - again, flavorful! We then tried the Sacri-fries - delicious! Lastly, I had the Avocado Fried Rice and my husband had the Spicy Maple Chipotle wings - just f*cking amazing! I also had the Category 4 cocktail - it's named after a Category 4 storm/hurricane for a reason! They are definitely not shy with the liquor. My husband tried the Bird is the Word and it was so smooth! Overall, this was a great experience! I will definitely be visiting again! Everything offered on the menu is so unique - please do yourself a favor & check this place out! You won't regret it!"}, {"review_id": "sBRXWS_jpLWmrBfC9u3EcA", "user_id": "1kD_JtZCpovqdS-qvs5HGg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "Ambience was great--but the food and drinks were \"eh\".

LOVE this place. Yes parking is a lil tricky but this place has a great social ambience and amazing food. All five of my friends loved this place too! What's fun is that you share plates and get to try different things on the menu. The soy ginger wings were the biggest hit! We got several orders. I tried the spicy beef noodle this time and I loved it! Would get it again. The short rib bao buns were also a hit and super tasty. The crispy duroc ribs were good. For some reason- the chicken wontons were just ok for me this time. They were my fave last time I was here. Everyone loved the avocado fried rice- I liked it but enjoyed the spicy beef noodle a little more. The prime skirt steak was ehh and everyone agreed. I highly recommend this place if you like ambience and really good food :) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~March-April 2017Had this place bookmarked and I'm glad I finally had the chance to come . I came  here last night for 7pm dinner (Thursday night).Parking is metered street parking which I could see it being hard to find spots but luckily we didn't have any problem.Outside is not very obvious. It's a ground floor entrance using stairs going down to the entrance. Once inside- you are transported into a cool ambiance. It's a Tiki bar but it's dark  and adorned with cool decor and lighted candles.Reggae music fills the air. Not too busy around 7pm but was packed  by 9pm .... and thus more loud (due to people talking). There is a bar near the entrance and then a back dining area( where I sat) Drinks. Happy hr is 5-7pm . And it's 2 bucks off drinks. Drinks are pricy . Drink menu - has some cool cocktails and I also saw cocktails with things I've never even heard of. I tried four ( including trying my company's also) . They are pricey drinks. Some strong. Some with way too much ice. Some with cool presentations.I think my favorite was the \"smoldering bastard\". I tried the dry tongue therapy, barracuda bite and maui's gift which were ok. Food.... YUM!!!....Except for the crab cake- it was eh to me and not worth it. The Bao was tasty and better than I expected. The Korean style wings ( comes in three kinds - I had the spicy maple chipotle) which was good. The Sacri-fries were delish. Now to my Top Two faves here.... the chicken wontons were so flavorful we got two servings and the crispy duroc ribs were so yummy and fell off the bone. Things dreams are made of :) We shared the churro dessert which was good but I prefer chocolate vs a blood orange kurd.It was mentioned to me that they will change the drink menu soon ( to the spring menu) .The service was on point. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and the drinks. The owner/manager - not sure which he was- walked around and asks us/guests if we were ok. I was very pleased ...I would definitely come back .....for the smoldering bastard , those dishes I tried ... maybe try some new things and a large format drink."}, {"review_id": "-hxWRUAX9hcdCs2aIyP7NA", "user_id": "HS1xj2PfkdhkmQaW6hJXqQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "First learned of baos in San Francisco, but took me all the way until a date night with bae at Cellar 335 until recently when I had my first bao ever.

Will not be my last bao.I think Cellar 335 is known for their wings, so we got the wings! Amazing. I will go back just for those wings. Very crispy. You get 3 different onces to choose from. We also had the fries and they're actually potato wedges. It was delicious and  bacony enough, although the portion was a little small.Great cocktails and wine pours.

I nixed the first reservation as Cellar 335 seemed like a better choice based on reviews (what can I say, I'm a yelp ho) and I think I made the right move. Upon entering - has kind of a intimate tiki bar type of feel to the place, but swankier I guess. Were seated right away and we all commented that we liked the ambiance. Drinks: Several seem to be a tad on the too sweet side, so be forewarned. We started of with the Pele's Awa. Was pretty good, boozey, and fun as it came aflame (and wasn't too sweet). Not sure if because 3 of us sharing but seemed to run out quickly lol. Was a good start though. Tried a couple others, but none really caught my attention outside of the Golden Grog which I thought was delightful and the only one I ordered a repeat of. Food:Brussel sprouts - were pretty good, a touch too oily though. Great char on em and not overcooked which is the exact way to serve em.Fries - good but nothing specialSpicy cornbread - hoollly shit good. I took a bite and involuntarily just said \"damn\" and paused to stare at the remaining bite while I reflected on how wonderful life could be. Yes that tasty. Must be really bad for you as it's suuuuper delicious. I ordered a few more later. Definitely order them. Order a lot of em (they aren't large) as one isn't enough. I vote you change the name to spicy crackbread.Short rib bao - yumHamachi tartarte - take this off the menu. This was just bad all around. Tasted like tuna out of can with mayo on top of a chewy (said crispy ha) sad rice cake. None of us enjoyed this one and I would definitely advise you to skip this. If you have quality tuna to serve, this is a good way to ensure no one knows (or maybe that's the point :o)Skirt steak - This on the other hand, this dish was superb. Tender, juicy, flavorful. Everything I want in life from meat. I'm salivating thinking of it and also a dish you should definitely order.Wings - were good. Did the spicy maple, good mix of salt spice sweet and crunch going on.Spicy beef noodle - ehhhh. This dish was weird and not what I expected. Its ground beef and noodles and the flavors are... odd. It almost wants to be peanut butter noodles (which I love) but instead takes an odd flavor profile turn to something less enjoyable. Would skip this. Although my review on the food has both hits and misses, overall I have a very positive outlook on the food here and found it a good eating experience.The service:Meh. We asked if we should order all the food at once or wait to put in some orders later (as we wanted to space it out so we could enjoy our cocktails/buzz before getting too full) and were told it would be spaced out so he would take it now. We pretty much got evvvverything at the beginning. Sat with empty drinks for a while multiple times which is a huge pet peeve of mine. Had to flag down other people to get our waiter on a few occasions, another server stepped in 2x as well. When asked what something was on a dish we ordered, he had no clue and felt zero inclination to go find out (which if the service was solid I wouldn't have cared, but poor service + lack of knowledge = more meh). I can't even recall a time I tipped only 15% but I was pretty annoyed with the lack of service here. I think there was a floor manager by the hostess station who looked very approachable at least and if we hadn't had to rush off to the next spot I would have considered even mentioning it to him which is something I've never actually done. Anyways, service and those 2 dishes aside, I'm sure most people would have a very enjoyable dinner here and it's probably deserving of better than a 3 on most nights."}, {"review_id": "Q4xsIrReriXq0t3-xczAzg", "user_id": "2KURds0iXKihtaBJo7xvrg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "Great neighborhood spot.

I finally made it last Saturday night and it was packed! The hosts told us it would be a two-hour wait since we didn't have reservations (so make reservations!). When they saw we were willing to wait they immediately started suggesting ppl at the bar who might have been getting ready to leave soon, so we could wait by their area, to get seats. There were so many ppl waiting by the bar, though, that we decided to just wait out a table and hope it wouldn't be for a whole two hours.We got our table in maybe about an hour and 20 minutes; and they sat us in a cozy booth. Although they were still busy our waitress got to us right away and was extremely helpful with explaining all the really cool choices of drinks they had.When I wanted to get our waitress back really quickly to add to our order I asked another waitress and she actually went and got her! (Most of the time those requests could be ignored in other restaurants) Then one of the hosts come over and brought my boyfriend and I shots, he said we were great guests and a breath of fresh air for being so patient and I told him their service really made it easy on us as well. We ordered a bunch of tapas plates. I would have to say, do not go there without indulging in the Brussels sprouts. They are amazing! The drinks were really great and strong also. Our waitress had a lot of personality and was fun to talk to, again, even on a very busy night. Even the host came back over to check on us again and make sure we were all good. Also, the other host happened to come by at the same time and wish us a good night as he was leaving. This will be a regular spot for us. Oh, also I'm vegan and I still found comfort here :-)."}, {"review_id": "gtHKopKoW7D3T9mftZBG7A", "user_id": "G68tylZdeaLD_rWighANvw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/19/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "More of the same from my prior review.
