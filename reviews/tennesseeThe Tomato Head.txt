I always enjoy my meal here. There are so many choices for vegetarians and vegans but, their menu would please any dietary preferences (including meat eaters). I never feel like I'm missing out on something like I do when ordering a veggie variant elsewhere. I have tried many of their dishes and they've all been very fresh, tasty, and well presented. I especially enjoy the Vegetarian Sandwich. Tofo is not something that I typically enjoy but, whatever they do to it here really hits the spot! They are probably best known for their wide selection of unique pizza combinations. You can't go wrong here.   They are always very busy but, you wouldn't know it based on how quickly you are seated. The wait times are usually very reasonable and they offer text alerts so you can walk around Market Square if you like. The atmosphere is very modern and matches what you'd expect of Downtown Knoxville. They even have local artwork displayed and (usually) available for purchase.  If you haven't eaten here already... you're missing out!"}, {"review_id": "0Wklf6doF45uHiNCX7ppNA", "user_id": "itKqcEM4jICvXS5k7Qyi3A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Tomato Head was an average dining experience.I ordered 2 slices of pizza, one with all meat and one with salmon and pesto. The nice and unique thing about their pizza menu is that you can order specialty pizza by the slice (at lunch only I believe?) Most places don't allow that. I was a little disappointed with the pizza. The flavor was average, the crust was much too thin, and each slice was overpriced. My wife and I each got 2 slices, paid $20, and left hungry. I would recommend getting a whole pizza or ordering something different on the menu. Perhaps some of their other dishes are better. Overall, it was an average pizza place. I probably would only return if someone suggested something they really liked from the menu."}, {"review_id": "crZrHcVLX8QtgMrrvC20og", "user_id": "j9Z1dcoZrwn8Ul9JTnjjug", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "After almost living in Knoxville for 5 years, I have finally tried out what all the hype is about for Tomato Head. And to be honest, it was everything that it was so hyped up to be. I know, I'm pretty much in the minority in this opinion, but to me it was just okay. I think there are better pizzas around Knoxville and should be visited so people can decide for themselves.Anyways, I ordered a 9\" pizza for $15. To me, with the additions of options and toppings a pizza could easily get pricey quickly. I am in no way saying that their ingredients weren't fresh or that service was bad... to me it just didn't hit that spot of balancing the ingredients to what you get. My experience at Tomato Head was pretty good. The food wasn't bad, there are a lot of options to customize your pie and you'll come out of it with an satisfied experience. However, if you're looking for more in pizza, there are better spots personally. I would recommend to look at A Dopo or Hard Knox if you're looking for a good comparison to the type of pizza Knoxville serves."}, {"review_id": "7_c3H4PyIZaU6btXIikg0g", "user_id": "7Ogw1uT6k7vkf1xOtmNuUQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "I called in a carry-out order today during lunch at the height of a festival downtown.

Food takes way too long to come out for salads, pizza, and sandwiches. Plenty of options for pizza as you can build your own pie. There are 3 categories of ingredients thus 3 different price points. It adds up really quick though.Why is this place to dark?

They have lots of other items to choose from as well like custom pizza and other salads and such.

Thank goodness she did!! I used the nowait option through Yelp and arrived at our given time...we were seated within 10 min. I have to rave about the excellent service. Seriously if there is a restaurant in need of examples for service, go here they are great! Top notch...seriously. Okay for the food. You may see tomato head and think pizza. If that's what you want great they have it! If not, like me that day, don't worry there are so many other options! I ordered one of their brunch sandwiches without the bread and no problem, they put it all in a bowl for me to enjoy. And aaammmaazing! The bacon, oh the bacon!!! (Note to management, sell me this bacon and ship it to me! I'm still craving it. No salt needed in the dish, the bacon gave me every bit of flavor I needed. Next time I'm in town, I will be back!!
