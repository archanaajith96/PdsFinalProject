All the flavors worked really well together and the brussels sprouts were tender with the right amount of char. This was my favorite dish of the night. They came with 3 dipping sauce, but they were too delicious to eat with sauce.Truffle Fries $7 - These fries were good and not overly truffled.  They came with 3 dipping sauce, but they were tasty on their own.Croque Monsieur $13 - This French hot ham and cheese sandwich on brioche toast was good.  The brioche was fluffy and soft.  This sandwich comes with a side of bleu cheese potato salad, hand-cut fries or chocolate espresso muffin and the muffin was really good.  It's almost like a dessert cake.Creme Brulee $7 - This dessert came with a choice of white or brown sugar on top.  Typically it comes with white sugar, so I tried the brown.  It was thicker than the traditional topping, but tasted just as good.Unfortunately, my vegetarian dining companion did not enjoy his veggie burger as it was lacking in flavor. However, he was impressed with everything else and would return to try the other vegetarian options.The interior is quaint. Service was friendly.  They have free parking next to the building and behind the building.  There were plenty of spots in the back when we came for dinner on a weeknight.....| \\      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,      .../  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \\ -  ;  ;  ;  , _    ..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .  (   ` - ` -  ' - '   '  - - - ' ' ( _ / . _ ) - ' ( _ \\ _ )"}, {"review_id": "BDSvhLTJ_T_twF0PhnuGlw", "user_id": "Pr9BlXYGUxFD7tq77PM1ZQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Good food but worst service I've had at a restaurant in quite a while.

The second time, not so much. Three stars- The food was not bad. I got the salmon Benedict and it was average. The first time I had it, it was the best thing ever but this time around it was a little bland. I did order crispy hash browns with my Benedict and it was really crispy and I love that! So three stars because my hash browns came out the way I wanted it. We also got the pomegranate mimosas! I really like it!! Not really a mimosa type of person, but I'll drink the pomegranate one!! Minus one star- Let's talk about the service. I have never had such terrible service before in my life. Me and my group of friends probably spent an extra 30-45 mins here because he did not attend to us properly. I felt like he could've prioritized his tables in a different manner. I understand that serving is difficult when you have so many tables to attend to, but our server was hanging out at the hostess stand after we had asked him for our checks. Before we even asked for our checks, we had to wait about 20-30 mins AFTER we finished eating to get his attentions FOR our checks. Then our server took an extra 15 minutes to split up our checks. As he was coming back with our checks, he stopped by the table next to us and took their order. On top of that, he didn't even split the checks correctly. We didn't bother asking him to fix it because we just wanted to get out of there. Minus one star- So everyone knows that if you have a valid N card, you get a free dessert. According to our server, green gateau doesn't \"have that promotion going on in the summer.\" It's funny because all of our other friends have gone and told us otherwise. Definitely unfair. So that concludes my experience at green gateau. I won't be coming back."}, {"review_id": "Zvax3cErxbPFvU-T0mczNw", "user_id": "88YVtATlF3mOTBzU_4zymA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/17/2016", "text": "This place was allot nicer than expected. It is great if you have a special someone and you want to impress and score big points. Fancy and up scale restaurant with interesting dishes. On this day, they offered a cod fish freshly caught in Oregon by the chef. Or was it the north east. Anyway, scallops, asparagus, shrimp and risotto. But first I started with a lobster bisque. Very nice. Bread was a croissant with whipped butter. The main dish was very tasty. I don't usually have cod or scallops but I will say, it was very good and not fishy. Very fresh. I did not have the dessert but it all looked amazing. Service was very professional. Atmosphere was romantic, although I was by my self.So. Good food. Good service. Nice for a date.
