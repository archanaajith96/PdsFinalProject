I said okay, but added, \"Why don't we go to Cafe Cusco for dinner, first.  I've been wanting to try their Meatless Monday.\" Folks I gotta' tell ya'...I was not disappointed.  The hostess, Denise, took care of all because the Meatless Mondays were apparently served upstairs only.  I explained to Denise that I really wanted to try their special but the stairs prohibit me.  No problemo. The next thing I knew a male wait person brought me pudding and a cup of Minestrone Soup, complete with Peruvian vegetables.Then Denise appeared again bearing a potpourri of mixed vegetables in their Peruvian flavored sauces. Not only that, but she also brought me a large plate full of Nachos and the best clean and light tasting salsa I've ever had, along with an orange looking tea of which I've forgotten the name...delicioso!  Though, not my favorite meal that I've enjoyed at Cafe Cusco, which was more my fault.  I guess I'm just not much of a vegetarian.Oh and the Gelateria will have to wait for another time as my daughter and I were filled to the brim. By the way, she had an - arroz con pollo - (rice with chicken) dish and claimed it was magnificent (she warmed the leftovers and had them tonight, at home.) My favorite sandwich - so far - is the Pollo Oliva with melted Provolone cheese.  But then their dinners are hard to beat as well. You can check out their entire menu at: google.com/search?q=cafe…  Hmmm, wonder what I'll try during my next visit?  No matter their wonderful wait staff will certainly serve up a culinary delight. Great food is always on the menu at Cafe Cusco!"}, {"review_id": "K2ekbwCGwjivrjwX4-dbcg", "user_id": "qCu_bt6LmIUex2YnjPgTvA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "The decor and ambiance of this restaurant is 5 stars, the service 4 and food 4. The food had great flavor but it was a little on the sweet side. Both me and my fiancé thought our dishes were too sweet-not for sure if they add sugar to their dishes. Overall, the price is okay but some of the dishes should come with tortillas, instead of having to order them as a side item. I am vegan so my options were limited but I felt there was still a variety of unique dishes. The majority of their sauces have mayo, bummer! I am unfamiliar with Peruvian food, not sure if that is an ingredient they utilize in a lot of their dishes?? If I was in area, I would eat their again. Perfect restaurant for a date night!"}, {"review_id": "TDX5cYRA8Bq2NsHCm925Tg", "user_id": "nr35WjC-YI0dFcsnW33Szw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Based on all the Yelp reviews - u know this place is already good. However, for me it isn't exactly authentic Peruvian food. You judge a Peruvian restaurant by a few main items: Lomo Saltado (Beef with Fries/Potatoes), ceviche, some chifa offerings (Chinese Peruvian food - b/c this is a natural fusion, Wong's Supermarket is the best CHAIN in Peru ever!), lots of corn/quinoa dishes, and a really good pisco sour or chica morada (purple corn drink). This is a nice Americanized take on Peruvian since I've missed it so much since I've lived there. Been here for dinner and lunch, always busy either way and maybe more so at lunch. Think about reservations! Things to Note:1) Lomo Saltado is not the Best2) Love love the Trout Dish3) Vegan offerings w/ delicious quinoa soups4) Amazing Lunch specials5) no roasted Peruvian chicken but plenty or other alternative chicken dishes6) Vegan Monday night buffet7) Decent  ceviche but made w/ tilapia, ask for more heat8) Hot sauce made in-house and u can buy it! 9) Service is always wonderful And I haven't had dessert yet - but it looks large and tasty to share, so I'll be back again!"}, {"review_id": "eCxKT54KCgAGr2_vwN8oYQ", "user_id": "lZbotco47bHU7oE5b3d1DA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "I will start by saying we tried this place based upon the wonderful Yelp reviews. It is Peruvian fusion food and well done!We ordered two appetizers to begin the feast. 1. House Ceviche which is fish (tilapia) cured in lime juice, garlic, yellow peppers and cilantro. This was my favorite part of the entire meal and I would highly recommend it!!  Outstanding flavor but extremely light and flavorful appetizer.  2. Fried Guacamole that comes with mango sauce. Nothing to rave about but at least we tried it.There were 4 of us dining so we also ordered the Chicharron, which is seasoned fried pork topped with golf sauce and a side of sweet potato fries. Both were very good and split four ways gave everyone a sample to try. The main meals were selected from their Signature Platos - Aji Panca rubbed 8 ounce sirloin steak with black beans, gold mashed potatoes and fresh veggie medley. Again it was good, but not spectacular!  I would rate it a solid 3 and 1/2 stars. My wife had the Puca Picante, an Incan recipe with toasted peanuts, garlic and potato served in a red beet sauce. Only 3 stars - if that. We also had one person order the chicken Aji Verde - sautéed in cilantro and served on top of greens with mango, red onion and fried avacado (yes they are big on the fried avacado here).For dessert we split a Torta Askinosie, which is chocolate cake soaked in coffee and topped with caramel fudge and whipped cream  ! !In summary, it was interesting and certainly Peruvian fusion food. We will go back, as they have daily lunch specials that look interesting!!"}, {"review_id": "xG3TbZE8IRDq2JM3t0jBTw", "user_id": "sxG8mCAr6aN3nIcOpK3Weg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "This place is really cute and the ambience is really nice! Came here for dinner, got the pesto pasta with chicken, friend got the sweet potato noodles. You've got the option to add mushrooms or chicken on the pesto noodle, and the option to add chicken, beef, and I think something else to the sweet potato noodles. Or you can make the sweet potato noodles vegan by not adding any meat! Both were so delicious! I thought everything was great here- the service- the atmosphere- and the food. Id like to come back and try their specialty dishes!"}, {"review_id": "d7oA8gfrD2wWQw-7YQ6dKg", "user_id": "h4W1fFr35s4z5KAEwgs75g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/9/2017", "text": "The ambiance here is really cool!  This would be a super cute place to come on a date.  There are a lot of choices on the menu but everything it is more on the expensive side.  I ordered the chicken aji verde.  It was very flavorful.  My daughter tried the veggie bean & quinoa soup.  It had a lot of spices that just didn't blend well.  My husband and I both tried it and neither of us liked it either.  We told the waitress that we didn't care for it and she didn't offer to trade it out for anything else.  Overall, this is a trendy and interesting restaurant but the food has a lot of unusual & unique spices.  It's not something I would want to eat on a regular basis."}, {"review_id": "1duBWWT5GTJNNX4bmd_ppg", "user_id": "f6D8B8V4rNCnNNSVqK764g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Cozy booths and bright window seating!

Each dish had potential but we did not enjoy the food as expected. The lomo saltado rice was undercooked, fries were stale and reheated and it was extremely sweet. Definitely not what I'm use to when eating lomo saltado. My husbands dish lacked flavor and tasted like \"jelly\" noodles. I'm giving it 3 stars because the ambiance was AWESOME and our server was so sweet. It would have felt more authentic I she could pronounce \"chicharrón\" since it's one of the popular dishes, but she tried."}, {"review_id": "4jrh6ZJxRuAVXw_1pJ5CYw", "user_id": "Q0cpwOF2XjBy7FXlklI_1w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/14/2017", "text": "An excellent meal within an exceptional restaurant.

They are open seven days a week, and 3:00 to 5:30pm Sunday through Thursday is happy hour, which is a great time to drop by for a quick, light, low-priced meal. Although I am not a vegetarian nor gluten-free, my dining choices lean away from red meat and refined flour. My favorite dish is the Mango Chicken Verde, a light, but substantial salad; my daughter's favorite is the Lomo Saltado, a sliced steak with fries, tomatoes and garlic; a friend of mine enjoyed the Tequenos appetizer so much, she ordered a second plate for dinner. The service is good, the prices are reasonable, the ambience is cozy, and in the warmer months, there is outdoor seating.

The food here made me feel like it's been a really long time since I've had a really stellar restaurant meal. Let me tell you, the chicken aji verde was it. The lunch portion was generous and easily could've made me two meals, but it was so delicious that I couldn't help but eat the whole thing. Our server recommended it and I'm glad I took her advice. Wonderful fresh flavor, and unlike anything I'd ever tasted before. Wish I could cook meals like this at home. I know I'll be back, because it was so hard to choose what to order. I'd say about 80% of the menu sounds amazing. The interior of the restaurant is just gorgeous, too.

Certainly a lot of effort goes into the extensive menu. Your correspondent enjoyed his lunch. A subsequent trip will be necessary to get a bead on the level of authenticity (the proprietor is a fan of Peru - like your correspondent - but not Peruvian). Potatoes, which Peruvian chefs seems to understand in their complex variety and different uses, seem strangely absent from the menu. Not sure authenticity matters to most folks anyway.

For my entree I had the Jungle Fruit Nut Salad and it was good. Once I sprinkled it with a little of their house made hot sauce to add just a little more acid, it was perfect!This is a great restaurant. Would recommend it to anyone who likes big bold flavors and a festive atmosphere, or drinking on the dog friendly patio.
