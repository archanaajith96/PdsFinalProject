The menu didn't offer too many choices but each option was unique and offered some great flavors.The steak and biscuit Benedict was cooked perfectly. The side of greens and potatoes really made it that much better. And with something like the crab cake hash you are really in for a treat. Everything is mixed together with perfectly cooked crab cakes on top. Pair all of this with a pitcher of blood orange mimosas and the live band playing in house and you're bound to have a great time at brunch."}, {"review_id": "zuy95gBO0ITC87MTCcYmdQ", "user_id": "xHx_nLvU_ajAP04v3b_m6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Found this restaurant last time we were in Nashville.  My wife and I decided to eat here prior the Foo Fighters concert.  The reservations were all booked so we sat at the bar that has a full menu. The bar staff were very attentive. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken with Mac and cheese and greens and my wife ordered fried green tomatoes and a bowl of gumbo.  Loved the buttermilk fried chicken flavor but the chicken fillet was a little to thin for my taste. The greens and mac and cheese were tasty.  My wife's gumbo was very spicy which we both like but my wife was disappointed as there were not many vegetables in it. She said the fried green tomatoes were just ok. I like the atmosphere at this restaurant and the staff were very good but we were disappointed in the food. I may try this restaurant one more time as I really like the buttermilk fried chicken flavor, but if the food does not improve I will move on to other restaurants."}, {"review_id": "jZFRZ-_JUw23tVNfASTeCw", "user_id": "4he1EYCFL6zISjpwmqEEBg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "The Southern seems to be on a free fall. This was our third visit to The Southern for a much anticipated Sunday brunch. What a disappointment. We had an inkling something changed since our last trip to Nashville when we had to wait almost 10 minutes for someone to appear at the hostess stand to take our reservation. We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation and were seated immediately at a nice booth in the bar. There was live music which was a nice vibe for Sunday morning. Our server seemed very new and certainly tried although his inexperience showed when he forgot our coffee and stood over my husband when he brought the check. The main disappointment was clearly the food. I ordered the Cuban which I've had in the past and was really looking forward to. My dish was lukewarm at best. My husband ordered the burger which was delivered stone cold and slightly frozen in the center. We rarely if ever complain or return food to the kitchen but did in this case since both meals were substandard. The kitchen remade our meals which were slightly better but not the flavor and quality we've enjoyed in the past. The manager came to our table to apologize and comped half of each entree cost. In a city as vibrant as Nashville there are many choices for great places to eat. Hopefully the management of The Southern will read the past several reviews and make some changes. The staff needs training on how to make a great customer experience and the kitchen needs to employ a chef instead of cooks. Very disappointed in this last visit and will likely not include The Southern on our list of places to eat the next time we're in Nashville."}, {"review_id": "JPIaKZhpRvoWIYXHTeTkwQ", "user_id": "vRHUVyLn6uzShnF8uG4Qcg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "I have been wanting to try the Southern for a very long time but never had the chance. So, I don't know if it was because they were super busy from prom night or what, but I was not satisfied with this place at all. Let me start with the good: the oysters were fresh and tasty. They bring it out on a platter with ice (like normal) and they set you up with horse radish and cocktail sauce and a lot of lemons. Great! Loved it. They also messed up my order in a good way because I got a dozen sent to the table instead of half. The bread is decent, small rolls but savory. I really enjoyed the taste of my lamb entree, as it was cooked well and sometimes that's hard to find. Our waiter was nice but did nothing above and beyond. The bad: my friend and I wanted to split an entree, which seems common because they have a split fee, which I have never heard of in my life. They literally charge you $5 to split the food and the bill. Uh what? No. You can just bring it out on a plate like normal and we'll just share it. Like how hard is it to bring two extra plates? When we got our bill, he ended up splitting it on our cards anyway. AND he charged my card for our bill and someone else's because, and I quote, he \"wasn't paying attention.\" Okay. Fine. It happens, we all make mistakes. What grated my nerves was that we decided to get the lamb entree. We almost got the t-bone but I really wanted the lamb because it sounded great. We specifically asked the waiter if it's shareable and he made it seem like the lamb chops were big and thick. Yeah. No. They were the size of a silver dollar, maybe smaller. Not enough to fill us up. My friend was NOT full at the end of the meal. Fortunately I was because I had the oysters and the overly salted gumbo that has very little rice and ZERO shrimp in it. This is what made me the most annoyed- my friend ordered a side of Mac and cheese, that they charge you for, it doesn't come with the meal and another friend had it in her fried chicken entree. Let me tell you, I have NEVER EVER tasted something so bland. I kid you not, it looked really good and creamy but it tasted like absolutely nothing. I was actually kind of offended by that because mac and cheese should taste good and I don't really know how it's possible to make it without a taste because cheese is great!!! But this didn't even have salt. Also, my other friend got roasted oysters or some kind of cooked oysters and they were overloaded with corn. He said it was all he could taste. Honestly, this place is super overrated and way too highly priced for what you're getting. I won't be recommending it or go"}, {"review_id": "m1OqxTR8AKMuFZAZf5InTw", "user_id": "rkdE06BbheP4gEhb3ooH0w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "A SERIOUSLY SLOW STARTSome major service snafus at the beginning tainted an otherwise great meal at this restaurant in downtown Nashville.A quick search of seafood in the area showed SS&O at the top of the list, so it got my Yelp blessing.  After hearing about the 1-1/2 hour wait for inside seating, we chose to sit on their outdoor heated patio.  \"No problem\", we thought, \"we'll get the same service outside\".  We couldn't have been more wrong.A full TWENTY MINUTES passed (I timed it, folks) and not a single server even so much as made eye contact with us.  No one.  No welcome or hello, no \"sorry, we'll be right with you\", nada.  Nix.  Eventually I got fed-the-f*ck-up and motioned to my girl where we moved inside to the bar and got almost immediate service. lolwutThey had a great variety of beer taps and the pours of red wine were substantial.  The guy sitting next to us even bought Nichole C and myself a round of drinks (thanks dude!)  I got a cup of their gumbo ($5) which was very tasty and came topped with a fried whole okra and rice.Her half dozen oysters ($24) came out lightning fast, despite being tiny!  These were NOT \"buck-a-shuck\" oysters like Poor Phil's in good old Oak Park, Illinois.  They were out of the reasonably priced oysters (how convenient.....) and these were far from cheap.  Her flank steak ($29) was prepared medium-rare and served with frites.  The fries were nothing special, though the aioli was great.My chicken fried chicken ($19) was delicious.  A succulent boneless chicken breast had a tremendously crispy crust, and the bed of southern greens with white cheddar mac 'n' cheese it came served atop had awesome flavor.  I wouldn't hesitate to order this dish again!Bread = 4.5Circuses = 2It must've been a bad day for one female barkeep, as she broke no fewer than 4 wine glasses and kept muttering stuff under her breath.  We've all had those days, but that grouchy demeanor in front of customers just reflects poorly on the business as a whole.  Other bartenders were nice, though.* TL;DR *The lengthy delay at the beginning was totally unacceptable for a nice place like this.  I came VERY close to telling the manager -- which I never do -- but I was on vacation and didn't feel like being Señor ComplainyPants.  Apart from that, however, the food was solid and my wine pours were hefty.I'd recommend Southern Steak & Oyster to those seeking a good meal......just don't sit outside, lest you turn into the invisible man (or woman)."}, {"review_id": "ayr96dX47fUkV38_Qf7lww", "user_id": "JKB_4_KYzs0yfgkyg8cXbQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "My boyfriend made reservations here via Open Table as we were here visiting Nashville for the weekend celebrating my birthday.

It was still a nice cut so I definitely enjoyed it. The mac and cheese was fresh and a good amount of cheese.

I had the best jambalaya I have ever had and it was packed with crawfish and spicy andouille and was the perfect companion to their own bottled hot sauces. Our server hailed from Florida and is a raw oyster lover and told us he has seen oysters come in from around the world that he had never heard of. He went on to say that they come and go with the changing seasons and I got to trying freshly shucked new ones. Each was unique and had their own distinct flavor and all encapsulated the essence of the sea. The appetizer with fried oysters and andouille was just as good and I highly recommend it for the folks that don't like their oysters raw.I had some local brews and tasted a mixed drink with a muttled jalapeño in it and they were all refreshing on a hot summer day on Nashville! They have a huge bar with an massive selection of bourbon, whiskeys, and spirts, after all it is Nashville!

This past visit was the visit where I sat at the bar.  I arrived about 9:15 and they close at 10.  They still had a decent crowd in house so I definitely wasn't trying to squeeze anything in right before closing.  But the bartenders were in full on clean up mode.  So it was a lot of waiting for a refill, waiting for the bill, waiting for the cc to be processed etc. There were 3 people behind the bar that appeared to be bartenders or bar manager, in addition to a shucker.  One of the 3 bar staff should've still been cognizant of the customers and their needs."}, {"review_id": "OHgjcn0XsnjRaBOt0Pol4w", "user_id": "kc_oGROYgDbkItQT5rfaUQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "One of the best filets, I've ever had.

For appetizers, we started off with a dozen of raw oysters and the soup of the day that was perfect for a cold weather. One of my favorites was the delicate texture of the Dominican Pulled pork, which is a Caribbean-spice braised pork and mango pico, topped with crispy sweet potato grit cake. The waitress suggested we should try the crab cakes. One bite had me chomping down the Bayou Crab Cakes that consisted hominy red pepper relish and chili lime beurre blanc. The best crab cakes I've ever tasted! The Southern Burger was so massive, I could not finish it. The burger was topped with crispy fried onions and pimento cheese. Every bite was a new experience depending on which ingredients I wanted to combine next.For dessert, we went with a slice of the Banana Bread pudding that my friend and I shared that we both enjoyed. There is just something magical about chomping into a nice delicate crust of the Banana Bread pudding, and then tasting the fresh flavors of caramelized bananas, rum sauce with fresh whipped cream.
