The wait for the restaurant was about 45 minutes and my boyfriend was on the verge of hangry and we popped into the \"to go\" spot. We looked at the shorter menu and decided to eat there. We ordered a BELT sandwich and pancakes. Unfortunately our first set of utensils was extremely dirty, we tried to get the attention of one of the staff but she was speaking to a vendor that sitting a couple tables over so my BF went up to the front and the second set was also dirty and the staff member up front shrugged when my boyfriend showed her the dirty second set of utensils. After our third set was decent we decided to dive in and the food was amazing! We can't wait to try the main restaurant! We also took a chocolate banana muffin to go and we devoured it!"}, {"review_id": "jATO1ZoP_TjxOjRfHgrFrw", "user_id": "3zPpMuN2f8lZx_6B7PFaOQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "I really wanted to love you Clinton Street Baking Company. Unfortunately, I do not get the hype suthis place. The lines are long and the wait time can range anywhere from 30 mins to 2 hours. I do appreciate the fact that their menu is notextensive which allows them to perfect the few items that they have. I'm not a breakfast fan but I do enjoy brunch especially when I can have dinner in the morning. I just wish that CSBC offer more of a variety. He ordered the chicken and waffles and I initially ordered what I thought was a Shrimp Po'Boy. Our waitress confirmed our orders at which point she asked me what? I repeated a shrimp po'boy. His coffee and my passion fruit bellini came out. I didn't care for my tart drink so I called over another waitress to remedy the situation. I told her my drink was sour. She stated that it's passion fruit. Great, I did not ask her to reiterate what I ordered I just wanted something else. Nonetheless her response annoyed me. She changed it to a mimosa. Our food came out and that's when things took a turn for the worse. His chicken and waffles were perfectly executed. My \"shrimp po'boy\" was actually the \"shellfish catch of the day\". Confused by this I called our waitress over. She told me yeah we don't have shrimp po'boys and then pointed to a sign that read, \"filet or shellfish catch of the day\". I can't begin to explain how I felt once she said that. Quite frankly I wanted to folio but decided against it. Making a scene would have been pointless. I just sat there upset, annoyed, and betrayed. I didn't even want to taste my hunny's food because of this. Our waitress came by and asked if I wanted to change my order. I declined. I tried to suck it up and eat the \"seafood po'boy\". Unfortunately,  I could not. The catch of the day was inedible and was incredibly mushy. I ended up sending it back and requesting a replacement dish of the fried chicken sandwich. I requested chipotle mayo instead of the lemon pepper mayo. I also substituted the hand cut fries for sweet potato fries. This was much better but lacked seasoning as well. The chicken was fried perfectlyand the brioche bun was nicely toasted."}, {"review_id": "VqQXaDO8G6n2-jk4m04zxg", "user_id": "3rYu-baIaiK6EkgHsHdZEg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "REALLY wanted to love this place, I mean...Chrissy Teigen's favorite pancakes?!  I had high hopes.  We came here on a Monday at around 1030.  The wait wasn't bad, we only waited about 15min and got seated pretty quickly.  We decided to order: -blueberry pancakes (the pancakes itself is really good!  Fluffy with a bit of crunch around the edges)-banana walnuts (this one was good too, the syrup is definitely special to this place, I've never had something like it.  For both pancakes, recommend to share because they get way to sweet after a while!)-eggs benedict w/ham (average, but definitely not special and not worth a long wait at all)-Mexican shake (definitely not worth $8)Aside from the food, I just didn't feel comfortable eating here.  The service was so slow.  I think they only had 1-2 waitress for the whole place and it took forever to ask for anything.  It's also a VERY tight place.  Getting in and out of your table takes strategy.  If you must, I recommend for the pancakes and definitely not with a big party."}, {"review_id": "_W7bv6unHsilm4iCD764cQ", "user_id": "Om8ZSsazTm2xNawyHlvf7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "This place definitely lives up to its hype.Pro tip: come early, within the first 15 minutes of it opening, and you will be able to score a seat without having to wait.Husband got the cheese grits and fried green tomatoes.  The cheese grits were some of the best I have ever tasted...instead of the usual cheddar, I think they used greyere, which  make the grits creamy with a slight bite...it was delicious.The fires green tomatoes had a light batter and this delicious sour cream like sauce...I wanted to drink that sauce."}, {"review_id": "AVBMbxxwjOMVAgMWeSV4Pg", "user_id": "GmQR50bIII7gDNRYEgfXfA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Woah, the hype is real at Clinton Street Baking Company.

Clinton Street Baking is making a KILLING. But, it was DELICIOUS. I don't know what it is, but they live up to the hype. *Buttermilk Biscuit Sandwich - this was my friend's order and she seemed to thoroughly enjoy it! But, we thought it was curious that it was served \"deconstructed\" for the diner to put together. Why? HahaIt took a little while for the server to come around and take everyone's order since there was only one server handling the tables, for some reason.

It was perfect for a quick friend reunion in the city. Beware, there is always a huge crowd and tables don't come easy. We were on a 2 hour wait, but it was quite worth it! Clinton Street has a selection of brunch goodies, including 2 types of southern breakfast options (mine include fried green tomatoes- YASSSSSS, baby!) and delicious Banana Foster French toast and fluffy blueberry pancakes. The drinks are kept simple: Mimosas, Bellinis, and a great Apple cider and whiskey drink. Everything came out fast, and our waitress was pretty sweet.Keep in mind that this place is CASH ONLY.

They are famous for their pancakes for a reason, it didn't disappoint, blueberry compote that isn't too sweet and has a hint of lemon is on top of 3 stacked blueberry pancakes.

It was pretty packed, but our party of four was able to get seated right away, which was nice. On a weekend it would probably be a lot more packed, so that's something to consider. Note that this place is CASH ONLY so drop by an ATM beforehand if needed.  We ordered the wild Maine blueberry pancakes ($15), the eggs benedict ($18), and the chicken and waffles ($19). We also got two sides of the sugar cured bacon ($6 each). I felt like the majority of what we ordered was good, but not out of this world. It was pretty standard brunch food. I enjoyed it and would order it again, but have definitely had more unique brunches in the past. I will say that their maple butter is fluffy and delicious. But, the stand out item for me was the bacon. IT WAS SO GOOD. That was actually the main reason we visited this place, and it most definitely did not disappoint. It was so sweet and salty and good! So definitely give it a try. And for $6 you get a pretty hefty plate of bacon. If I were rating this place on the bacon alone I would give it a 5/5, but alas everything else, while tasty, wasn't anything super unique which is what warrants the 3/5 rating. All in all, come for the bacon. It will change your life."}, {"review_id": "mXo-NJXsPEdaOmJe9hUn-Q", "user_id": "rHDxRF258QPy7zlpOUgC7Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Came here because there's an article highly recommended this place.

I'm taking one star off because of this place's popularity and how they can underestimate the time for customers. I have waited more than an hour for a weekend brunch. Tip: They serve their full menu all day long, like a diner.

I ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffles was light crisp and fluffy the perfect compliment to the crispy juicy chicken that accompanied it. The chicken was well seasoned and with a nice crispy crust.Along with that a side of maple brown sugar cured bacon which was like meat candy that had me like a kid in a candy shop. It had a nice char with the sugars caramelizing over the salty bacon. One of my favorite things I ordered was one of the simplest biscuits with butter and jam. The biscuit was flaky and fluffy yet nice and buttery the jam it came with was amazing the perfect sweetness over the hot buttery biscuit. I could go back and just eat biscuits that's how good they were.

My brother, his gf and I decided to check it out on a Monday, and despite it being a weekday, we had a wait of over 40 minutes, which was disappointing, but luckily there are tons of other great places near by to walk around and check out, so we decided to wait to try this food, we've been hearing so much about. I ordered the blueberry pancakes, my brother ordered the fried chicken and waffles, and his gf ordered the salmon Benedict. Overall the food was pretty good, but it didn't exceed my expectations.

I usually get the latkes (potato pancakes) with sour cream and apple sauce and their famous blueberry pancakes. Both times they were SO delicious and well presented. The blueberry pancakes are extra fluffy and buttery good and the latkes are super crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. We came here on a Friday and it was pretty packed. They don't seat incomplete parties so make sure everyone gets there on time. I would say we waited about 20 minutes at 11am, which isn't bad for NYC. We also got the cheese and mushroom omelet this time and it was just okay. The omelet was a good sized portion and very fluffy. I'm not a huge cheese fan, so you can take my opinion for what it is. We split all three dishes between the three of us and we were pretty full. Would definitely come back again!

I didn't feel like having dinner for dinner, so the most logical thing I could think of was to have breakfast instead! No wait time. Yaaaaassss. Chomped:1. Blueberry Pancakes - these pancakes were fluffy af. They probably put cake flour in the mix, because the texture was so light and airy. Comes with a side of maple butter which complements the blueberry compote; both items which were surprisingly not overly sweet (a good thing!). 2. Buttermilk Fried Chicken - this is fried chicken done right. Popeyes, KFC, Los Pollos Hermanos and all them other fried chicken establishments should take some good hard mental food notes. The skin was crunchy, the meat was juicy, and the seasoning wasn't salty.Both portions were generous and left me stuffed. Prices are jacked, albeit justifiably due to hype, reputation, and location, but I would visit again for brunch on a cozy, sunny weekend morning."}, {"review_id": "ATNoSf1j_AEtLwBBfG9jRg", "user_id": "39ob3TUuT8AVi4Y_POIJnQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Delightful brunch option!

Definitely get here early, since they do not take reservations.

They clearly actually cook their chicken in house (as it should be!). The highlight of our visit, however, were the breakfast cocktails. We tried the hot buttered rum and the Mexico hot coffee and both were sublime - right and warm and well-crafted.

Luckily I came here on weekday afternoons, so there wasn't a line but still quite a few patrons inside. The first time I came for pancakes, and also some other dishes. Now I only come for pancakes (for the other food is good, just expensive and not quite worth the price). For a place that is usually crowded I'm not sure how there isn't more waitstaff available. We were seated quickly but no one came by for a long time, and someone who was seated after us was gotten to first. I'm not sure they have an actual order in how they serve people. Also our waters were not refilled once the entire time we were there. Eventually a busboy did come around to take our order, just that order of pancakes. It did take awhile but worth the wait (as long as you aren't to the point of hangry).The chocolate chip pancakes are fluffy and served warm. Tastes amazing. The best part is the warm maple syrup it comes with, the problem is I wish there was more than just the little side it comes with.  But at $15 for 3 pancakes I can't be frequenting this place all that often.
