Anyways, after spotting the reviews on this one we made our way to grab lunch and I gotta say... the hype is real.Pretty casual spot all around with a full bar. Parking was easy to come by in the rear of the cafe. Staff was friendly through the entire dining experience and you can pick wherever you'd like to sit.Once seated some free plantain chips to enjoy while browsing the menu. Note: beers only $4 on tap. Score! Ended up sharing a smaller order of the nachos and had a Jamaican Jerk chicken plate for myself. The nachos while not the prettiest thing to look at were damn tasty! Tortilla chips topped with melted cheddar, Hawaiian style pulled pork, choice of spicy bbq sauce, sour cream, cilantro, onions, and tomatoes. Deliciousness in every bite! The Jamaican jerk plate ~ just as great. Jamaican seasoned chicken served with black beans, fried rice, cilantro, onions, shredded carrots, limes, and a side of cole slaw. Let's just say there were no leftovers when it was all said and done.Price point came out to just under $30 as I recall for the two of us. Not bad all for two entrees, an appetizer and a draft beer. I'll take it.'Til next time, cheers!"}, {"review_id": "ygyQv1ZRE4JicBBvyBoYFw", "user_id": "JLjXr6xn_0j9gjOzBcOE3w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "A charming little bar, that carries a homie personalized touch. My server (Jenna) was equally charming and quite welcoming, offering several local favorites from the menu. I had the jerk  chicken platter, with a side of yellow rice, black beans and red cabbage coleslaw. In one word.... yum. I washed it all down with a glass of ice tea.... disclaimer: this place is above the Mason Dixon line... so they don't put sugar in their tea!Overall, this place gets my endorsements. When in the area again, I would revisit and try some of the other items. I heard on Tuesday they have half price tacos, especially if you have a Zeke t-shirt.Thanks for reviewing."}, {"review_id": "dIW3quCLl8YmC0-Qw1It2g", "user_id": "Rsz90Xe6mcc3TOmBx8nQkA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "Found this place on Yelp while in town, and decided to give it a try.  Parking in the back is a little sketchy, but it was Saturday, so we parked out on the street.The moment you walk through the door you know your meal is going to be good!Our waitress fresh squeezed fresh fruit for my cocktail...legit, they have a press behind the bar!!!We ordered the nachos as an appetizer, it didn't last long!  The chips were crisp and the pork was so flavorful!I would've given 5 stars, but our meals took forever, and when we did get them they were cold.....our poor waitress was by herself and it was busy.  Will definitely return for round two the next time I'm in town though!"}, {"review_id": "r3s93loa4x5OZ1nO8k7QHw", "user_id": "x8-dN_YvWMgZqP33Iea8LQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "I've been meaning to stop by Zeke's for awhile, and I was very surprised!

In light of a brutal winter day, walking into Zeke's felt like a warm hug of sunshine. $4 draft brews? Check. Quick and efficient service? Check. An option to order a half order of nachos as an appetizer? Yes- healthy portion of pulled pork, baked cheese, and scallions. Definitely a check. I got a tilapia salad that was amazing. My fiancé got a jerk chicken plate that my fork found its way into more than once. Both delicious. Total bill around $30 with a beer. Not bad."}, {"review_id": "_C24TJyquLVOVwTk-QjGVw", "user_id": "Ht8Y2TdriLUOjdlEr2jVHg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "I'm in the area often for work. This was a nice surprise. I couldn't decide between the jerk chicken or garlic shrimp. I settled on chicken and it came with a sampling of a new chicken recipe they had. I thought that was great! The chicken came on island rice and beans. There was a side of coleslaw too. It was very refreshing!The chicken was a good choice. I will have to come back and try the shrimp. They also have nachos and salads. They look good too!Parking is in the back.

It's one of me and my husband's all time favorite places to go for a casual date night! The food is always fresh and delicious. I typically get the crispy shrimp tacos because the slaw is unreal! He tends to get the Huli Huli Chicken Plate because he likes the variety. The meals come with macaroni salad and cabbage egg rolls. I'm not a cold pasta kind of person, but this macaroni salad is delicious and pairs perfectly with some of the spicier dishes. The service is always really good here. Last time we went, we spent about 45 minutes trying to figure out the secret flag coded message on the wall. It was fun and gave us something the do! The waitress even gave us some hints. Overall this place has great food and an awesome atmosphere. Definitely a diamond in the rough!"}, {"review_id": "rCdR1LoMslnXrKffQRwdYA", "user_id": "WUqf-HYspfs94QGlCgH57g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "I had never experienced \"island cusine\".

I won't completely fault Zeke's because they outsource their delivery service. However, I am beyond appalled that they would charge $2.25 for a  plastic ramekin of pineapple. We're talking the plastic cups you put ketchup in. The Huli Huli chicken was decent (I've had it from here before) but again the portions are minimal. This wasn't a lunch portion or anything of that nature. Just cutting corners. This is my third time trying Zeke's and definitely my last. The dine in experience was better but service was slow and inconsistent. This may be an attempt on island food, but they are definitely behind the island times. Service and quality must improve."}, {"review_id": "6hbea8-Q1-JKtB9LK839Jg", "user_id": "5lkHacI3a7mFQ2qJ0j_eqA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Island vibes in Iowa!!!
