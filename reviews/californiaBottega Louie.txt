Took my sister and her bf here that were visiting from out of town. This is a long overdue review. We went during the middle of the week so the wait during brunch was not that long. Waited maybe 5 min at the most. Prices were within reason considering the location. My favorite bites personally were the Smoked Salmon Benedict, along with the Earl Grey Macarons from the bakery! Both were very delicious and would definitely recommend. According to the website these menu items are still available. Would definitely be back to try other menu options. Overall a great first-time experience, 4.5/5!"}, {"review_id": "0z7f4HDedTa0I3sRKfco5w", "user_id": "m19IzjDyYKtIlWJSjytU2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Brunch at Bottega is on fleeeeek. I recently came with 2 friends around 11am. The wait was about 30 minutes and it was so tough to find parking. I had the best experience here. Usually, people would consider BL as a touristy spot because of their famously aesthetic lines of macarons. But the brunch here is where it's at. Portebello Mushroom FriesA little heavy, but so yummy. The mushroom is cut into steak like strips and battered in a cheesy bready goodness. It comes with a cilantro aioli that pairs super well with the fries. Everyone raves about this dish and I definitely think it's good. The serving is pretty small but I think since it's so heavy and salty, one order is enough to share between 2-3. Lemon Ricotta PancakesSuper light and fluffy! I think these pancakes would be every girls dream pancakes. It comes with a blueberry jam - the tartness of the jam pairs so well with the sweetness and denseness of the ricotta pancakes. Definitely worth a try. Artichoke Pizza Ok honestly, I don't really like pizza. But when I come to places like this, I always order one because pizzas are generally pretty filling. The artichoke pizza, however, was actually really really good. The make the dough and fire up the pizza in house and fresh. I was eyeing the truffle pizza (because I'm addicted to anything truffle) but alas, my friend wanted the artichoke. Next time!Service was amazing. The interior is brightly lit with natural sunshine and everything is very clean. Food takes a while to come out though! Can be kind of busy and loud during rush hours. Prices are a tiny bit steep, but not bad in my opinion. Definitely worth it for the experience."}, {"review_id": "pclAW7T1L5E0cGTGV8I33g", "user_id": "ewQJk1w1_GoS3aWIhqmXjg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Ok so I get why this place is popular...there are some great French pastries, the macarons are pretty delicious, and this is probably the best presentation of assortments of goodies that you'll find anywhere. But this review is purely for the brunch. Again, I get why people want to come here. It's in downtown LA, it's popular, it's covered with windows and has a lot of natural lighting...but overall I find that the place is too crowded and the food to be sub-par and overpriced. I always feel like if I'm paying a lot for brunch, it really needs to be worth it because there are certain things that can easily be recreated right at home (like waffles, French toast, eggs...). This being the case, I ordered the Tuscan Farro and Eggs, and I will say that there are a lot of good looking options (albeit still overpriced). The plate was pretty good but was kind of bland and for $15 I was kind of hoping for a warm egg? I don't know. Honestly I can't tell if I was being too picky or if I just couldn't get over the fact that waffles were priced at $18, but all in all I thought this place was ok, a good place to go to say that you've been there before and buy macarons."}, {"review_id": "ymGpyIBQy4G-XzEsURS3IA", "user_id": "cPcStFGBlk-6lWWsttIfVQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "French toast (Thick cut caramelized bâtard, strawberry compote, buttered almonds & Vermont maple syrup on the side) - Easily the best and most fresh French toast I ever had.

My exposure to babka in the past has been Seinfeld and grandmothers, and while it was hearty, I can now leave the babka experience in the Seinfeld and grandmother realm.

We ordered a latte and an americano and yes they have sugar free syrups available! The coffee was fantastic delicious and balanced so delicious I truly enjoyed it. We ordered 3 beignets not the typical warm with powdered sugar, that was disappointing. The strawberry filled one, Nutella filled, and plain were delicious and only $3 each. Also ordered macaroons to go.

The food is reasonably priced for an upscale eatery, and the pastries are made with such attention to detail, they warrant the considerable price tag. A few things I love about this place: The hustle-and-bustle and coolness of the city is well captured in the ambiance. There is no delineation between the 255-seat dining room, bar, and café areas, and the vaulted ceilings further add to the openness of the space. There is also an open kitchen with glass panels, so you can see the chefs hard at work. My date had the Chicken Parmesan and I had the Trenne pasta. For such a simple dish, the chicken parm was divine. The marinara sauce was perfectly tangy, sweet, and savory. The chicken was moist. The trenne's half-fried pasta gave it an interesting texture, but I was partial to the sauce on the chicken parm.Service was friendly, efficient, and overall excellent."}, {"review_id": "gDWmWewmH7IGgzZenSbS_g", "user_id": "NzhzPtJLC-zZggW0ha2Q6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "The service was awesome but the food was okay for the price.

It was right on time as I was in need of some caffeine right around 11am so this is for the cafe portion of the establishment. They also have a restaurant and small market inside. I ordered a latte and a couple macaroons. I'm not a fan of macaroons, I was going to get something else but macaroons are a specialty here, they are the first thing you see lined up like the color spectrum. I went for the grand cru and earl grey macaroons. They were flavorful and rich without being super sweet like other macaroons I've had elsewhere. They had a good texture, smooth and almost crunchy on the outside and moist and soft on the inside. Latte was good tooThe first thing I noticed was how clean the place was, almost everything is some shade of white or gold that gives it a very royal vibe. It was so nice and bright inside with high ceilings and lots of marble.  I could really admire everything inside and the large windows mean you could get a seat and people watch while your there.

Bottega is an institution of its own. Beautiful high ceiling with intricate detailing, open kitchen, ready-made sweets, and always good people-watching!Brunch is really my go-to here. It's best to get there right before the rush.. it gets really, really busy. For brunch you can't go wrong with the avocado toast, french toast or pancakes. While those are my preference, Bottega is known for plain good food. Everytime I go, I see a dish I haven't seen before being served to another patron. Good sign. For dinner, you have to do pizza or pasta. Pesto gnocchi is a personal fave as a starter and the bolognese kills it. What I like best about Bottega's pizza is the thin dough - lets the toppings shine! Be prepared to wait a little extra for the pizza though. Last but not least, don't forget to IG that sh*t!

When we were in LA for the weekend, I knew we had to hit up one brunch spot on Sunday before we headed back home. Bottega Louie was the winner. They don't take reservations and we unfortunately were tired from the day before at Universal, so we didn't get an early start like we hoped for. We made it to DTLA around 11AM and there was about a 45 minute wait. Not terrible, we've definitely waited longer for brunch in San Jose. Unlike most restaurants, this place has a bakery. So we spent a good chunk of our time looking at all of the goodies in there. Let's start with the brunch. When we were finally seated, we skimmed thru the menu, but had a pretty good idea of what we wanted. My two friends that were with us ordered two main meals and decided to split is, as my daughter and I did the same. We ordered two of the beignets, which was the first best decision of the morning. When they came out, they were warm and just really light and airy with the raspberry dipping sauce, WHAT?!? I probably could eat those on the daily for the rest of my life, if I'm being honest. My daughter ordered the waffles, which I was surprised because she usually goes for the french toast. I like waffles better than french toast, but it all looked so good, I probably wouldn't have complained. I ordered the classic eggs benedict and then we split both dishes. Lets just say: we didn't need any to-go boxes. The food was just cooked perfectly, great flavors and just an overall great brunch send off back home. The marble for the interior make it seem like a clean and modern feel, with a twist of elegance...not not pretentious.My friend also dropped like $200 in the bakery on the way out. They apparently love baked goods. I took a few things home for the rest of our family. If I lived in LA, I feel like this would be my go-to breakfast spot. Thanks for a good Sunday funday, BL. Maybe we'll meet again in the future."}, {"review_id": "UcpFwHdqtJzBUCFBK91_vw", "user_id": "FMEM6QazGhjPxXjOQv471w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "High quality food, although service is painfully slow.

(at least as of today ha ha at 14,400+)I am so so so so excited to be writing this review. It's like what a fellow elite commented on my check-in, it's the \"Mecca of Yelp\". I'm such a yelp geek and I legitly googled \"Most reviewed place\" and Bottega Louie showed up in the results. I honestly had never heard of Bottega Louis before my google search back in December and I'm actually shocked since it's really not that far from me. Only about a 2 hour drive. I would have assumed it was Cafe du Monde in NOLA or Voodoo Doughnuts in Portland with the most reviews.Bottega Louie is an Italian Restaurant and also a French Patisserie located on the ground floor of the Brockman Building in Downtown Los Angeles.I visited on Saturday with my middle school best friend whom I had not seen in 8 years! She lives in the LA area so we did a mini food trip for our reunion. I parked at her boyfriend's apartment downtown and we walked about 15 minutes to BL.There is a sit-down restaurant portion and also a casual to-go cafe/bakery. We had dinner reservations that night at Spago in Beverly Hills so we only tried the bakery portion of Bottega Louie.They are most known for their macarons. They give you a menu where you check off your macaron order. 5 pieces is $12.50, 13 pieces is $32.50, 28 pieces is $70 and 45 is $112.50. It sounds pricey but it's really not. Anywhere else you go macrons are in that price range of $2+ and for a known brand it's not that bad.My friend and I ordered 5 pieces which comes with a super cute box too! The flavors we tried: Coconut, rose, pistachio, espresso and lemon. My absolute favorite was the rose flavor! Love the cream filling! We also got some iced coffees to go with our macarons. While we were waiting for our order we went to the bathroom and missed my name being called. I went up to ask for our iced coffees and I'm not sure if they gave my order to someone else but it wasn't there. After a few minutes I went back up and the second time the coffee was ready but I think they forgot to call my name. The lady working there was really nice and apologetic. It really wasn't a big deal but she gave me two complimentary beignets LOL it wasn't necessary but still very nice of her to do that. My friend and I had a great time catching up on 8 years of our lives over delicious macarons, iced coffee and beignets! Well worth the trip!They have some seating near the bar area, I assumed it was restaurant seating but one of the guys working there said it's actually first-come-first-served for the seating. Even if you only order from the bakery you can sit there which was cool since I thought we would have to eat our treats at home.Bottega Louie is super awesome! I can see why it's the most reviewed place! Yummy sweets and treats and also excellent service with cute ambiance too! I'll have to come back to try their restaurant portion next time since their pizza on the menu was calling my name!"}, {"review_id": "v7e5KI3Bl0IPzO2qRRoCiw", "user_id": "oaOEItHZ3xq4PKz4K8Ux0g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Two of my coworkers and I went here for lunch and spent $105 (before tip) and that was for a starter, pizza, two nonalcoholic drinks, and three entrees.
