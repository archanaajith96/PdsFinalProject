Their pizza is DELICIOUS...like so delicious I am drooling right now thinking about it. Zoey's and Need are the best in town. I have ate both in and did pick up from Need. Both times, I have been thoroughly impressed with the flavor. It puts other pizza to shame. 2. The people who work there clearly love their job. They can help you find a beer that hits the spot. The Bad:There are only three things I don't like about Need. Mind you it doesn't bring down my score so they aren't big things.1. The places is always busy, but what do you expect when the pizza tastes this good. Obviously, don't come when you are extremely hungry or you are going to also be extremely frustrated with the wait. Pick up is always a good option, but that leads me to point number 2.2. Downtown parking can give the most patient person a headache depending on the time of day and season. I have realized sometimes it is better to park in the ramps than to drive around aimlessly looking for something to open up. 3. Finally, in the winter the booths near the door can be pretty chilly especially when it's busy cause the doors lets all the cold air rush in. However, if you are lucky enough you will get there early (hint, hint) so you can pick a booth in the back. Otherwise, make sure you keep bundled up and enjoy the pizza. I am sure you will."}, {"review_id": "_W5JxVR190E3nB4gSqGVMg", "user_id": "SlnLBqEdBxTxj7ZPKdiONw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "Thought it was a cool spot to kick it.I got my food to go but from what I could tell from the short time I was there: cool ambience & friendly staff. I wish I got a picture but the bar looked cool, they had fridges that the taps came out of. That's a first time seeing that.The food as also good, I got the portobello mushroom appetizer ($10) and a small Caesar salad with chicken ($9). The quality and taste were great but I don't know if the mushrooms were worth $10. They were kind of small and I'm not sure if the stuffed crab dip had much crab in it (maybe 2 or 3 had noticeable crab). But aside from the below average portion sizing, I would still come back but order something else instead of the mushrooms."}, {"review_id": "Ra3egnVkKIwW1FgJ9z4UTQ", "user_id": "qdZhyZyndhKhZUz3Ah7ZNQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "I have to give this place 5 Stars!!!!   Pizza is great and comes in these oversized pans!   Service is very reasonable especially considering how busy the get.  We had a party of 10 and did not wait long.

I had heard good things about Need Pizza so decided to give it a shot.Need Pizza is located in downtown CR. I love that they are trying to revitalize the downtown area. It reminds me a lot of what is happening in Des Moines. Walked in a settled onto a stool at the bar. Decor is interesting. The back wall behind the bar is lined with old 50's era refrigerators and the beer taps come out of them. Really cool. A few TVs behind the bar for your viewing pleasure.I wanted something completely different so I went with a clam and bacon personal pizza. Instead of going with red sauce I went with the olive oil and garlic option. It was phenomenal. The salt from the bacon and clams combined with the garlic, it was divine. I would go back again and again for that pizza alone.Craft beer selection was really good. Plenty of taps and this particular weekend they had some leftovers from a Big Grove Brewing tap takeover so that was right in my wheelhouse. I like places that don't stick to just the standard crafts and instead get a little wild with their offerings.This is a super awesome pizza place and I will definitely be stopping back whenever I'm up in Cedar Rapids again."}, {"review_id": "RNfiYOCOSrYwqJLwzW39-w", "user_id": "n55QRPKgssfW1VT5rt5NsA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "This place is awesome. They let you sample as many beers as you'd like, and there are plenty to choose from! They have great appetizers, and their pizzas can range from traditional to specialty, all are fantastic. The only drawback is that the pizzas take up the entire table, so you have to eat under the pizza rack they provide.

Excellent beer selection. Creative toppings (eg: clam, mashed potatoes, had em both) that actually work well. The crust, bake and cheese are average. They call this \"New Haven\" style. I've never heard of that before and maybe it's just not my style. Not the place to be impressed by matter of the basics.

Although they are usually busy on a Friday/sat night, this doesn't excuse the service considering they have a lot of people working. We also got seated by the door at a small half booth/table for 2 which is a joke to me unless you're eating alone. We barely had any room on the table and it was cold I think I actually kept my coat on. The decor and atmosphere were both nice except for the seats so close to the door. I will go back again but I will definitely request a booth away from the door and maybe get there a little earlier to beat the rush and or wait."}, {"review_id": "FnOyPsF4TFMmUxhF6uvFbQ", "user_id": "U0neoRrRJ-EtKwVdhlpXZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/29/2017", "text": "Wife and i ate there last night.

I wrote a review on Facebook, but hadn't got around to \"Yelping\" until recently. Had heard from coworkers for a long time how great this establishment was. But for whatever reason, I never really got around to going downtown and actually checking it out for myself. What a huge mistake that ended up being. I went with a buddy of mine and we were greeted and sat kindly and quickly -- great start. The server was prompt on coming to our table and getting our drinks -- also very friendly. The menu says a large feeds 4 or more people, but I know from experience that some places like to exaggerate on their sizes a little bit so my buddy and I decided to go ahead and get it anyway. Ended up ordering a large white chicken, bacon, & mashed potato pie. The wait for the pizza itself was relatively minimal, also another check in the positive column. But at first, I thought our server was taking the pizza to a different table around us, because he was carrying a MASSIVE sheet pan.Sure enough, he came to our table and dropped it off and my jaw hit the floor.Pizza was fantastic. Great thickness (it's a thin crust), great flavors, not cheap on the topping, and if I didn't mention it before... the thing was HUGE. Great value, overall, considering what you end up paying, in my opinion.I see in other reviews that people say that you can surely get a better pizza in Chicago or other large city -- I strongly disagree. Chicago is mostly known for it's deep dish, but when I was there, I tried FOUR different well known pizza places and I would take Need over all of them. Big-city pizza is overrated. You can find amazing pie in Cedar Rapids, and Need is proof of that. A small side note -- the atmosphere is very relaxing and \"chill\". Just a great place to be, sit, and relax. The ONLY, minor \"complaint\" I would have is that the menu is written so that you kind of put together and build your own pizza. They typically run one special at a time, which kinda sucks for people like me who love to try new things but aren't all that creative. SO if you've already had the special or it doesn't appeal to you much, you are on your own and kind of just throwing stuff on a pizza that you hope ends up tasting good together. But as I mentioned, that's a very small detail. If you've been waiting to go to Need like I did for so long... Stop waiting! You won't regret it."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/need-pizza-cedar-rapids?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
