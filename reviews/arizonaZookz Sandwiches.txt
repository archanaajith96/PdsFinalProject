I was super hungry and in a rush to get to work, and needed a quick fix for breakfast. I decided to give them a try because of the reviews. Not sure if I chose an underwhelming sandwich or if it declined in quality from the ride over...but I probably won't order that sandwich again. Hate to say it, but I would have preferred a breakfast sandwich from the mermaid queen of coffee aka SB. Might be awhile before I try this place again...To each their own. On the plus side the coffee was good and delivery was prompt."}, {"review_id": "zf_YPFZ0-qsCtGoMYLCnGQ", "user_id": "cjfV4NTTmcD-mwYxRFaE3A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Modern and trendy sandwich place.  I got the #25 and it was OK overall... It tasted basically just like a normal hot sandwich that just happened to have a unique shape to it. In other words, it was fine, just nothing memorable.

I can't believe this was my first time here. This place was amazing!

I also got a freshly squeezed orange juice and it was worth the $4. We sat outside since it was a beautiful day and enjoyed our delicious sandwiches.

Heck, I'd even drive a few miles extra to be able to stop by and grab a sandwich pillow full of delicious goodness, made with fresh ingredients, toasted and sealed to perfection. Quite honestly, Zookz has the BEST sandwiches I've ever had -- they're a cross between an adult gourmet version of hot pockets and paninis... and if THAT'S not a great combo, I don't know what is! Not only do I make it a point to stop by Zookz when I'm in the area, I bring someone with me every time. One bite of the deliciousness served up by Zookz and you get hooked, I'm telling you. I brought my mom with me and at first she was a bit skeptical, but it was love at first bite. She ordered the No. 35 (Thinly sliced roast beef, crisp bacon, fresh tomatoes, shredded cheddar cheese, and Zookz Horseradish Sauce), which came with a side kale salad. I ordered the No. 66 (Cheddar cheese, 2 poached eggs, bacon, tomatoes, green onions, and Zookz zinger cream cheese sauce). It was all extremely flavorful and delicious, so much so that it's almost a sad and disappointing moment when you finish your last bite and realize you don't have more left. On the plus side though, you can always order more (if you're still hungry), or come back for more another time. Yaaasssss!!!Moral of the story: Don't judge a sandwich just 'cause it looks small and cute; not only will Zookz satisfy your tastebuds, but it will also satisfy your hunger."}, {"review_id": "5oYRNkmn3gvDegHOJiw5lw", "user_id": "2bUBT-wI-XEt-2-0tbdpRQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Love this place!

I really love the founder's story of how she began to make these sandwiches and where her inspiration comes from. If you haven't been to Zookz, let me explain why it's so special. The founder created a special sandwich press that perfectly toasts a round, crustless sandwich filled with delicious items of your choosing. They have a number of amazing combinations - both sweet and savory, breakfast or lunch options. I love the menu items with eggs in them, and I LOVE the nutella one, too.

I happened to be in the area, so lucky me. I was impressed by the store front. Very modern, with large open windows and this really cool, big glass door. I can see this place great as a spot to work at. I got 2  breakfast sandwiches. I don't remember the numbers though. One was their classic one made of poached egg, bacon, basil, and cream cheese. The other was made as a frittata with red peppers, bacon, ham, and Chipotle cream. They were definitely stuffed and I loved the crispy bread. But with the rave reviews, I was expecting more. I feel like flavor was lacking and I find myself sad after eating it. I make breakfast sandwiches that are so tasty and I wasted my appetite on something less than expected. While the sandwiches weren't bad, I will just find myself somewhere else for breakfast."}, {"review_id": "Wol6bNNeHP1STdVoQkht4Q", "user_id": "8Mif_XAoR8kj3pb-NrB1_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Sandwiches were very yummy!

Stopped here this afternoon and I had bookmarked it a couple of years ago. Was happy to see a few delicious looking vegetarian options!
