Buddakan is hands down one of my favorite restaurants in the city. It's on the pricier side, yes, but it's pretty much my go-to for special occasions (celebrated three birthdays there). The reason I'm writing this review is because of how great my experience was the last time I went. It was on a busy Friday night, and we had to wait longer than expected for our table - which was understandable. The food was worth it (GET THE ROCK SHRIMP + GENERAL TSOS CHICKEN DUMPLINGS), but what made everything even more special was the service. The manager (shout out to Ben!) took amazing care of us, and even brought out complimentary dessert to make up for the long wait. 5 stars all around."}, {"review_id": "LYsEhHFr1ngOFa8rNVSoMw", "user_id": "b7jCdgX3qTQAOOeKJXOS7Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "To start, everything about Buddakan was perfect! We had reservations for 5:00 p.m. and we were greeted and taken to the bar area to wait for our table. The decor was absolutely fantastic with deep teals, browns, orange and whites. The place is very trendy and fun with great music but still intimate enough to be on a date and not feel like you have to yell to be heard.  Our server was Tatiana (short brown hair). She was wonderful. She was extremely attentive, gave excellent recommendations based on what questions she asked us to be sure we got foods that would work with a shellfish allergy. Her opinions were spot on. We had the cod and the charred filet with rice and edamame dumplings. The soy butter that came with the beef was to die for! We finished with a creamy pineapple dessert that was delicious just as Tatiana said it would be. We asked for wine recommendations as well and the choices Tatiana gave were perfectly paired with our foods. Everything from the service, decor, restrooms, music, food & drinks was outstanding. Buddakan is officially our favorite restaurant in NY. We will be back!"}, {"review_id": "TS60XfT6R8t-8qzP50SE9g", "user_id": "6H9g6agwpmiHG8ZYgBJq5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "My second time here I came with a big group for a birthday and tried the $85 pre fixe menu.

If you are here on a romantic date and need privacy and quiet time, specifically ask for the library room. If you want to feel like royalty and don't mind the crowd, or are with a big group, ask for the main dining room. You can add these as special requests as a part of the reservation.The decor is exceptional! The main dining room which is the most coveted part of the restaurant, makes you feel like you are on the sets of Phantom of The Opera!It's an upscale place, so the dishes are obviously expensive. Everything we tried here was unique both in terms of flavors and presentation, hence worth the money. Highly recommend these:- Dimsum for two ($40) consisting of tuna spring rolls, sesame shrimp toast, tea smoked spare ribs, carrot dumplings, cantonese spring roll. Great order to start with. Fills you up with just enough space left for the main course, while getting to try out 5 delectable appetizers. Hard to pick a fave from the 5.- Glazed Alaskan cod ($36) . While the cod is cooked to perfection and has a subtle flavor of miso, the eggplant and mushroom mix on the side adds relish to dish. Servers were extremely attentive and courteous. We were too full and decided to skip the desserts. The server who knew about our anniversary, got us a plate of ice-cream with a candle on it. The best part? It was on the house! Very sweet of them."}, {"review_id": "08eIdqqb4BWkAMqZALcYyg", "user_id": "QNNY_lA1Wjn0QoLxsQoKzg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "A behemoth of a restaurant. Didn't know they come in this size lol.Walked in to this nondescript building and got transported to a dimly lit nightclub/pop lounge atmosphere. The receptionist was friendly and professional, quickly confirmed our reservation, explained it would be a few minutes for our table and invited us to sit in the lounge. Coat check is free and immediately next to the receptionist and very hassle free. As soon as we sat in the lounge a server came to greet us and offer appetizer/drink menus. Shortly after the hostess came to seat us. Still not sure how in a room of 1000 people they knew who we were and where to find us when our table was ready *mind blown*Our waiter was phenomenal! The place is HUGE and was packed, yet we never had to wonder where he was. He was attentive and gave great recommendations on the menu. The food was amazing. Every single item we had was perfection. And I loved that they included mocktails on their drink menu!"}, {"review_id": "smv5B5eWKH5ZXDtogGoVhw", "user_id": "J2JIo5RO8fkjWBONWWod8g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "My wife and I had heard great things about Buddakan and we were not disappointed!For drinks we enjoyed a Moscow mule and a Bellini. Both were mixed to perfection and had us looking forward to our meal even more! For appetisers we enjoyed the cantonese spring rolls and pork buns. The spring rolls were crispy, crunchy and succulent. Combined with the excellent dipping sauce that accompanied this dish, these spring rolls were everything we could have asked for. The pork buns were also excellent. The sauce was sweet but not too sweet and the pork was super tender. For our entrees we felt like some surf and turf so we chose the kung pao monkfish, the black pepper beef and the chinese sausage fried rice. I wasn't expecting the monkfish to be battered but it really worked as the batter was light and the sauce had a lovely kick! The beef was cooked perfectly and the portion itself was quite large. The sausage fried rice came with a poached egg which was promptly pierced so that we could mix that gooey egg yolk goodness into the rice. Every dish was superb!Onto dessert... We were a little stuffed at this point so we decided to share the crying chocolate dessert. All I can say is that it was so good it almost had me crying!!I can honestly say that dining at Buddakan was a great experience and one that we'd love to partake in again. The reason it doesn't get the full 5 stars is the service. Our server was friendly, attentive and informative but where the restaurant is let down is with the folks at the front desk. They were so cold when we arrived (not a smile nor a hello), that we almost felt unwelcome. This was but a small blip during an otherwise great experience but it is something worth the restaurant looking into."}, {"review_id": "aY3o12n4TzuaTcp3j189CQ", "user_id": "1M3Y5FhumVwkJ6h5773Ypg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Came here for our Valentine's Day dinner. The atmosphere is trendy and the place huge. We waited a bit awkwardly in the dark lounge, kinda standing by the doorway, kinda hovering next to some empty seats, before we got picked up by our hostess. She made a point of leading us down the beautiful stairs and in a long circuitous route around the place to our table tucked in one of the side vestibule. Apparently, we weren't the only one to embark on the scenic route as the ladies seated next to us also commented, \"Oh look, isn't that another doorway to the right we could have just gone through?\"Service was friendly and attentive. We ordered the Dim Sum Tasting for Two, consisting of tuna spring rolls, sesame dungeness crab toast, tea smoked spare ribs, carrot dumplings, cantonese spring roll. Overall, we weren't too impressed by the items. Some were a bit too salty, some tasted exactly like regular dim sum I've gotten a gazillion times before for a fraction of the price.For our entrees, we shared the Glazed Alaskan Black Cod, which was delicious and cooked perfectly. We also ordered the Wok Tossed Noodles with Prawns, which was ho hum, nothing memorable; I didn't finish my portion. We finished with the Chocolate Pistachio Cremoso for dessert - this was amazing, the chocolate creamy and decadent. All in all, this was a relatively nice experience for a date night. I wasn't too amazed by the food however - most of what we had felt like overpriced Chinese food that I've tasted elsewhere before. The cod and the dessert were the main highlights of the meal."}, {"review_id": "ZWckIU9d-I_vO9IH8mlQFw", "user_id": "v8jzFfSobiXGFF_QHDOZIQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "Buddakan is a beautiful place to check out for an evening. However, make sure you sit somewhere that's lit. We sat downstairs and it was just SO dark! I get the intimate feel to the restaurant, but if I can't even see what I'm eating or need my phone flashlight to look at the check, that can be quite annoying. I give most of the stars for my server. He did a great job at being quick and although not so efficient, he fixed his mistake quick to make us happy. If I had a big party or lived in New York, I would use this restaurant to host a dinner since they have a huge dinner table with beautiful chandeliers hanging above you.

Fun atmosphere, Asian-inspired decor and the most delicious edamame dumplings. Nice décor and huge menu.Edamame Dumplings: My absolute favorite!! Amazing flavor and texture. Very creamy and smooth, with flavors of truffle (probably truffle oil) in a light shallot broth. Just melted in your mouth...More underlying edamame flavor, probably mixed with lots of butter or heavy cream, but hey, they are delicious! Tso's dumplings: Basically, soup dumplings with chicken. The soup inside had a good kick to it (too spicy for me) so the chicken filling was rather plain. Not my favorite due to its spice level but my friend enjoyed them.For more reviews, join me on Instagram: @dining.delights"}, {"review_id": "b_KJtInEbjBC6gFFUfNc6Q", "user_id": "EOm_fi3vMyRWFRI9TAkzGA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "The service is helpful and professional.
