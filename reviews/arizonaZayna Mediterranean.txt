I ordered the Gyro platter and was really impressed in how fresh the greens were and how well cooked the rice/meat was. Very good flavors all around an the beef was super tender and juicy. AND they give you more of that white tangy sauce for free! I'm used to getting charged .25-.50 at other places. I was pleasantly surprised to see that was not the issue here, because i LOVE that sauce.The 5th star is given because of the wonderful service I received, the place was not super busy but there were several tables of people there. I was quite pleased with how fast and attentive my server was. As soon as you are seated your asked what you would like to drink which is great. My server Julia was very attentive and sincere during the whole dining experience. Super nice people. Great food and great service, that's all it takes to get five stars folks!"}, {"review_id": "4CVhU2Li463pmeHaiUYEKg", "user_id": "NLUsJN51SlxsCqD0obVQnA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "I was questioning my friend's decission to try another Mediterranean restaurant (I love Mediterranean food) but the last few places I've been left a bad taste in my mouth. Here it goes! Friday night, a bit busy of course, there was a wait but the turnover was quick. We were greeted and seated promptly. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming. Our server was great; got us drinks right away, answered any questions we had and delivered our food at a timely manner. Portions were big for its price which ranges from $12 to $14. We ordered Gyro Salad, Shis Tawook Plate and Sandwich and a few more dish (I forgot what they were) Everything was so good! Definitely will be going back!"}, {"review_id": "Qi5A04NyjyCdB7k3twAXhA", "user_id": "qK3kaF_CH6lI2NwSN_l7tg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Came here last Sunday for lunch. Our waitress was really cool and always kept our drinks full. I ordered the Gyro Sandwich with potato fries & my spouse ordered the Grill Sampler Plate and Falafels for appetizer. He really enjoyed his meal. My gyro was average and the fries were  nice and hot. I noticed a young lady pouring a sauce over her sandwich, I asked our waitress what it was. She said it was hot sauce that they make. I asked her for a bottle of hot sauce and it was a whole game changer. I poured the sauce over my fries and gyro sandwich and it just took my sandwich to a whole new level. It was the best gyro sandwich ever thanks to that sauce. - If you go get the sauce."}, {"review_id": "S-06iocNHtBf6vQiAkIZxQ", "user_id": "tD6a8AI7q__4COb_hhHc9w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Great veggie options!

I don't give out many 5-stars review, but this one is deserving of it.The service was good for a Saturday at noon. It probably deteriorates at night when there's a huge crowd. The portions are huge here which is great since each plate is around $12-$14.Now, it's time to talk about the food. The chicken schwarma was served with hummus and pita, green beans, and a slice of tomato. The chicken was perfectly seasoned with crispy edges. My only minor complaint is that it was hard to scoop some pieces that were cut too small. The hummus was good as well. I liked the cooked green beans too.The lamb kifta was also very tasty and not too dry. The seasoning of the meat was definitely fantastic. I'm not a huge lamb person so I still prefer the chicken. The rice was fine-nothing special but it wasn't bad.The fries are potato wedges with garlic salt and some other spices along with lemon juice. Perfectly delicious and they have a garlic aioli for you to dip with.The baklava is a superb dessert. I picked the one with pistachios. The minor thing is that this baklava was extremely hard compared to other ones that I've had.Overall, a solid 5-star restaurant that I will definitely be returning to."}, {"review_id": "hyJYnnR2J0SOhfwVvrjG6g", "user_id": "xfSiMtuhrlZNszvU2q_bCQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/5/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "My friend had the Falafel sandwich with fries and I loved the lentil rice pilaf with Chicken.

Zayna was a little bit difficult to find but eventually made it. I was pretty hungry and came in solo so decided to go for the grill sampler with the lamb kafta! I was pretty excited for this dishes, comes with the proteins, a salad, green beans, a cucumber yogurt salad, rice and some pita bread.Well the salad came first and it was pretty good. The platter came afterwards and I would rate the dish 7.5/10. The lamb kafta was delicious complimented by the yogurt. The chicken tawwouk and the chicken shawarma were disappointing. The tawwook was a perfectly seasoned grilled chicken breast, I would have expected grilled chicken cubes. The shawarma didn't feel like it was the proper shawarma more like chicken breast cut into tenderloins with heavy seasoning, that in particular was fairly salty but you can compliment them with their hot sauce! No rice is ever like Moms', but this rice was actually pretty good, Kudos!Shirley was my server and she provided exceptional customer service!Recommend this place for lunch or dinner, but I would recommend the lamb kafta over the other proteins! Plenty of food and lots of homemade touch in the food!

But it's not some fast food dump or a greasy spoon... there's a reason it stays in our regular rotation: The food is always delicious.They have tons of options to make anyone happy, from shawarma to falafel and everything in between. I'm partial to the falafel sandwich, but my husband and toddler love the \"carne taco\" (which is, apparently, what a three-year-old calls gyro on pita). The sides are also delicious and flavorful. If you go the plate route, you'll get TONS of food. We always have leftovers and plenty of different choices to share like hummus, baba ghannuj and grape leaves.Generally we go for takeout because it can happen in 20 minutes flat, but dining in at Zayna is an even better experience. The service is always incredibly courteous, fast, and attentive, and the food is even better straight out of the kitchen. Plus, when you eat there, you can enjoy Arabic coffee or Lebanese wine.

I came on a Monday night with a friend and was seated super promptly. Shortly after I arrived, the place started filling up. My friend is a vegetarian, and I'm definitely a meat eater, and Zayna had great offerings for both of us. I ended up getting something vegetarian: the falafel sandwich with fries. My friend had the vegetarian plate. Everyone's food going by our table looked really good, too; it was difficult to choose. We both liked our food, and I thought it was very fairly priced.The space is a little tight; we were seated at a two-top against the wall. Our server was polite and attentive. They have some wine and a couple of bottled beers, including Baltika 4, which is a favorite of mine. I will definitely return and try some other dishes.

We also ordered the cauliflower(fried) appetizer that was served with  Tsiziki sauce.The entire meal was tasty filled with flavor and the meats were grilled with perfection still succulent! The salad had a light lemon olive oil dressing which really accented the savory meal.  Comfortable family style setting, waitresses familiar with menu and were helpful.
