I came in on a Sunday morning 30 minutes before lunch time (oops) but the owner Ann was waiting on me and allowing me to order it before lunch officially started. The other owner Gary cooked it on a flat top right in front of me, and my mouth was watering while I waited for him to finish. The sandwich came with onions and provolone cheese and since it was offered, I added mushrooms, green peppers, and a side of coleslaw (which is vinegar based).I wasted no time to dive right in once the sandwich was placed in front of me. The sesame seeded bread, which is shipped directly from Philly, is toasted on the outside and soft on the inside, but has substantial weight to carry the load of all the ingredients.The meat was tender, well seasoned and I never felt like I was chewing rubber. The cheese melted into every crevice of the sandwich, and the grilled onions were caramelized down but still had a crunchy texture in them. I would have preferred that the green pepper had been cooked longer and for the mushrooms to be cooked less, but neither took away from the flavor of the sandwich. My goal was to only eat half, but I devoured the entire sandwich in one sitting.I also got a slice of Chocolate Pecan Pie, because its my favorite dessert and why not, I've already ingested a thousand calories so why not a few hundred more. Best Pie ever, I have no words other than that it was delicious and If I hadn't eaten so much I wouldve taken another slice home.I cannot wait to  come back for breakfast. Ann and Gary are the sweetest people putting out some amazing food."}, {"review_id": "B7CWVmsRwJGPNZvf4nos_w", "user_id": "Y8l-vYse2OhWGNvi2WttBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/10/2017", "text": "My fiancé and I have recently moved to Virginia/Chesapeake and stumbled upon The Grill one weekend day. We fell in love with this quaint little place. The food is beyond fresh and delicious. We've been for both breakfast and lunch, both being fantastic. Most recently being for lunch, which was amazing. I had a Philly Cheesesteak and my fiancé had a bacon cheeseburger, which we agreed that we will be coming back again for because it was sooo good.The Grill at Great Bridge is definitely on the list of places we will take our out of town guests for a wonderful, stick to your ribs, breakfast/lunch.Keep up the great work!!!"}, {"review_id": "6xiCzQ57HcDKnRlJ_xiw3Q", "user_id": "MMBbe_LesUvRHKco_28eDA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/19/2017", "text": "Perhaps the easiest way to write this review is to invoke \"Ishkabibbles\" - one of the best Philly cheesesteak sandwiches in the home of the the Philly cheesesteak in Philadelphia itself. The Grill is \"a hole in the wall\" (I almost drove by it and I was using Maps :-) on South Battlefield not far from Chesapeake Pizza. Once inside, you see that it's about the size of Ishkabibbles; actually a bit bigger. The counter was full and the couple tables they had were taken too. This size crowd says, \"good food is in your future\". The staff is friendly, like family. I took a seat and ordered the cheesesteak with everything. Seemed like the best idea for my first visit. Then my sandwich arrived (along with the homemade slaw). This place may be better than Ishkabibbles or Geno's. Service was great and so was the food. You should come for lunch and see for yourself."}, {"review_id": "60ln94Uwkz9h1ySxaiWHZA", "user_id": "B47vQ_UEb5QAbVrbfozr7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/14/2017", "text": "Omg!!!!

There were not tables but you can wait outside in your car and they'll call you right after they get one. You can also eat at the bar and it's kind of cool because you see the chef cooking your food. I had their omelet with home fries...yum! It was big enough for two people, I can't believe I ate it all myself, it was so good! I believe the chef and the lady taking orders are the owners, I'm not sure, but she was very nice, always offering more water or coffee, asking if we needed something, if everything was okay, etc etc you can tell she cares for her costumers. I recommend this deli place, if you need to wait for a couple of minutes, do it! It's worth it  I'm glad I live in the area, I'm coming back to try other dishes!"}, {"review_id": "1Cy9m7UJgBmLyM8W1BoZzQ", "user_id": "2irl3iTAADcXnuVRK8j7Vg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/9/2017", "text": "Great place.

Perfect little mom and pop restaurant. Gary and Ann seem like such nice people and always greet us with a smile. Limited seating, but there isn't usually a wait. Make sure you look at their times on the website--they switch over to lunch and stop serving breakfast around 11 on weekends.I always get the same thing for breakfast--egg white omelette with onion, peppers, bacon, and cheese, sourdough toast, and home fries. My boyfriend likes to either get the scrapple, or try the special (usually a French toast variation).For lunch I've had their burger and the grilled bacon, tomato, and cheese.

We were lucky it wasn't busy because we were able to get a table for the four of us. Although I was craving breakfast, they only had lunch available at this time. I had to try the philly cheesesteak. I really liked the flavor and how cheesy it was. It also came with some chips, which were pretty basic as well. I want to come back and try some other things as well.

There is a counter you can sit at and see all the food being cooked. Surprisingly the loud banging one would expect from a kitchen is absent and the atmosphere is friendly and unpretentious. They seemed to know most of the customers' names. They were quite busy with all the orders coming and going but they are very attentive and any need you have is quickly taken care of or they offer you coffee or something else before you knew you needed it. The place is so popular that it may be that early in the morning, you may have to wait for a seat. There is more parking by the trees and the store next door.The wall is lined with old metal ad plaques and decades' worth of The Best of Chesapeake awards that they have won in multiple categories every year since 96. The categories they have won in include:Best Lunch, Best Breakfast, Best Burger, Best Dessert, Best Sandwich, and Best Kept Secret.They do not accept credit cards and I may have missed it but there doesn't seem to be any signs alerting you to this fact, so bring cash. If you have a large family or large group, there are probably not enough seats open or room in the place for you.I ordered an omelette with onions, green bell peppers, mushrooms, cheese, bacon, and sausage. They also have ham as a choice. The omelette comes with your choice of home fries or grits and your choice of wheat, white, sour dough, or rye toast. I had the home fries and rye toast. The home fries were good and had fried onions in them. They were a little bland but there is salt and hot sauce available.My only complaint was that real cheese was not used; it would have contributed a lot and melded well with the egg flavor.I would have liked to have seen biscuits on the menu but there is probably not room for an oven in here .My favorite thing about The Grill was that the food did not have that commercial food service taste to it with the large amount of preservatives that make everything taste the same. This was real food and you could tell by seeing it on the grill and by the taste. The freshly ground beef prepared by a local butcher.One thing I really liked is that the official breakfast cutoff time had passed and they were still cooking and taking breakfast orders because the people had specifically come in for breakfast. Their goal was to get the customers their breakfast and not comply with some arbitrary standard. This flexibility is a big part of the value of a mom and pop place like The Grill that you can never get with a corporate restaurant and employees that don't care. In contrast, if you show up to some fast food place at 10:20, you may be out of luck for breakfast.I did not have any deserts but apparently the owner's wife has her own special recipes and makes them from scratch herself. I saw some and they looked delicious.I look forwarding to returning and having a philly sandwich here. The owner was born in Philadelphia and the menu says they are using actual shaved ribeye. It seems a lot, if not most philly places are using cheaper cuts of beef as ribeye is one of the best and most expensive cuts.After so many burger awards, I look forward to trying the burgers as well."}, {"review_id": "kTQtwMN_lBSSmoNmNopXrg", "user_id": "3p5tXN-OV-BNPluNPhyy8A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2017", "text": "Amazing little place, with amazing food and people!  We are regulars here, and I'm sure I have tried everything in the menu.  I have yet to find something I don't like.  Ann and Gary are awesome and always greet us with a smile and by name!  The girls they have working with them (I'm guessing family) are very nice and attentive.  If you come here, make sure you try the key lime pie!"}, {"review_id": "MBWye8baipZ7AAZ3qPwcNg", "user_id": "WnoYLgOTQfdoXpC1F7OTJQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2016", "text": "Great Desserts!

The coleslaw is a little bit too sour if you are just eating by itself, but if you are eating it with the cheese steak, it became the perfect match!!! The sourness balance well with the cheesy fattiness of the cheese and meat! Love it so much!!! I wish they open for early dinner too!!! If you still have room, you should try their homemade pies too!!!! I would recommend you to eat half of your sandwich and save some room for the dessert!!!
