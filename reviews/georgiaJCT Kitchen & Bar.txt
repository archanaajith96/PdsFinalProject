The first - I had shrimp and grits and I would give it a 4.5 out of 5. They were great. A little different than normal for me but good nonetheless. My girlfriend on the other hand had the pork-chop and I would give it a 10 out of 5 stars! It was phenomenal! We split the garlic fries as an appetizer and they are 5 out of 5 stars. Overall the service, drinks and food combine for an incredible experience!The second - We went for a late night date and booked the table maybe 30 mins before showing up. We sat at the bar instead of our table and got drinks and split the steak and potatoes. The hangar steak was amazing (5 out of 5 stars) and the drinks were spot on. Most importantly the service, drinks, and food were amazing yet again. I will most definitely be back as soon as possible."}, {"review_id": "1_SGTVwsX-cumYK6PK6fcw", "user_id": "U-h78U7aMQAf3GxwFNUF2A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Excellent food and a tastefully decorated interior. JCT is a smaller, cozy restaurant that makes you feel comfortable while majoring a nicer/ more elegant feel. Aside from the main dining, they have an upstairs outdoor area that overlooks the bridge in west midtown. The servers are attentive to accommodating your needs, I am gluten free and dined with a vegetarian and our server was more then happy to answer any questions/double check with the kitchen.Start with one of their amazing cocktails, which are listed on the menu in order from lightest to heaviest. My personal fave is the el centro, a smooth tequila based cocktail. The westside sour was also delicious! To begin, they have a great selection of plates to share with the table. The truffle Parmesan fries are phenomenal and a generous size to enjoy with a few people! For the main course, the scallops really steal the show. With a touch of mushrooms and crispy ham, they were cooked perfectly and tasted impeccable. We also got the day boat fish of the moment which was cod the day I went, served with plenty of delicious veggies. For my vegetarian dining with us, she got the roasted vegetable place which included roasted veggies and potatoes.I do hear the fried chicken is outstanding.Overall, impressed with everything from the atmosphere to the meal- yum!"}, {"review_id": "40vvv1Uy0OmTx20vEO4azQ", "user_id": "nQ7RKbvUOS-FSsb8aeFWBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Yes, yes, YES!!! At most restaurants, it takes many visits to get a large enough sampling of the menu. Fortunately for me, my visit to JCT was with a party of 12 very hungry foodies so... we ordered EVERYTHING!! The fried chicken set a new standard for me. Every single side dish rocked my world. I was a collard greens virgin until that night and I'm a fan (at least for that one!). The service was up to par with that of a 4 $$$$ seafood or steak house. The atmosphere and decor of this place was also most memorable and beautiful. From now on, for me, Atlanta will mean I get to visit JCT!!"}, {"review_id": "qvcTVM_6QG2J_9TXvsYJHQ", "user_id": "XoSPy_9tHRuVkPZ2VeMVUA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Wow this place is PHENOMENAL. I was only in Atlanta for a few days for work, but saw this place online and had to give it a shot. I was so torn between the fried chicken and the lobster roll, but went with the more classic fried chicken and don't regret it at all. The hot sauce was delicious, the chicken itself was beautifully brined, crispy and flavorful, and the meat was still juicy. Biscuits on the side were phenomenal as well. overall, just a truly fantastic bougie fried chicken. Also loved the Sweet Tea! Big fan of this place, would definitely come back"}, {"review_id": "JsR6kI2xRDYpf7uevV6ylQ", "user_id": "T99jHZvXqbLhSIr9g_RXEg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "JCT Kitchen is located off of Howell Mill in the Westside Provisions District, alongside Jeni's, Warby Parker, and Taqueria Del Sol. Parking is hard to look for during the weekends. It'll be a good idea to come early or park in the deck. There's also valet available. We came here for a large group dinner. As others have stated previously, reservation is a must.The main highlight of JCT Kitchen is their bar upstairs - fun ambiance and delicious drinks! Service was excellent and attentive for our large party. Food though, wasn't as memorable as I had remembered. It was good, but tasted like it was under seasoned. Out of all the dishes we had, my favorites were the Truffle Parmesan Fries and Garlicky Green Beans."}, {"review_id": "zZSCOh6BGiGBrJWzTZ39qQ", "user_id": "mfUqexGCiamAxeEzzxmijw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "What can I say? I love this place. We came for date night using a dating concierge service so I wasn't sure what to expect. We came in blind. We arrived at 7pm and the place was jam packed - every table occupied and the bar was bananas.  Surprisingly, there was ample parking as well as a valet option. We were warmly greeted and seated promptly. We had limited interaction with our server (by design) since we preordered and prepaid, but he was still attentive and available if we needed him. Now onto the good stuff:Ambiance - It had a sexy vibe which was perfect for a date night. Food - Wonderful! Appetizer: Clams with pork belly - it was a large enough portion to share and had great flavor. Entrees: He had the pork chop and I had the fried chicken. I NEVER order fried chicken, but heard it was a must try here so I did. Listen! It was half a chicken served with greens and homemade biscuits. Sooo good. I didn't get far, but it made an excellent lunch the next day. Hubs liked his meal as well, but had to bring it home too. The portions are huge and most meals can be shared. Dessert: We has the peanut butter cup and the coffee cake with caramel sauce. By this point, you could have rolled us out of there, but we took a bite of each and wrapped it up. The peanut butter cup was very good. I would have liked the cake equally as well had they not drowned it in caramel sauce. Cocktails: We let the bartender choose our drinks so I'm not sure exactly what they were called, but they were good as well.  This is a perfect place for a date night because of the ambiance and it's proximity to other cool places. You can take a walk and have a night cap at one of the nearby spots, or go up on JCT's rooftop and enjoy the view."}, {"review_id": "yrTpKfaUjcJCMts4blWekA", "user_id": "CkQX4GHcSkHYYalZSeiHNw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "My boyfriend and I went on a Sunday night and boy were we in for a treat. First of all, the feel of this place when you walk in was luxurious and cozy. It felt like I was at my rich grandmothers house. We were seated with the best server and he explained to us how things worked. On Sundays they serve things family style and you share as a table. The Sunday Dinner. We got fried chicken, Mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, and greens. All of it was absolutely delicious. The chicken and Mac were my favorites though. I would love to try their regular menu, but if it's compatible to their Sunday Dinner I'm sure I will be pleased."}, {"review_id": "knUs4_3mGVOlMgeV6UJhNA", "user_id": "agSAhBiAoExMAMftMo16KA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "I really enjoy going with friends! The only thing I even like getting is the fried chicken. I feel like they should make the menu with more variety. The atmosphere is good and also romantic setting for a date but I dislike how there literally is no elbow room. I can easily hear the next tables conversations and they can hear mine so that's a little awkward. I do like coming here for the yummy fried chicken but don't like coming on Sunday's because sundays it's a planned meal so you can't really choose what you what. Everything is served family size. Mac and cheese and collard greens are my favorite! The biscuits are awesome too. I know I keep talking about the chicken but it is the only thing I keep coming back for!

We didn't have a reservation and it was a Friday so it was sketchy getting a table.  The hostess was nice and explained everything well.  There was a nice evening buzz so the 45 minute wait seemed worth it.  We opted to go upstairs to the Bar to get a first serve table and found one really nice spot.  The views are nice and the band was just getting started, but it is still feeling like winter these days so back downstairs!  We ordered the Broiled Oysters and drinks while upstairs and they graciously moved our order to us.  The venue has many nooks and crannies that give it that romantic vibe.  Patios, courtyards all have a industrial feel with a  romantic twist.  Our sever Sydney laughed at all my corny jokes while providing attentive and friendly service.  Shrimp & Grits was better than I had at some other spots.  The burger with the bacon jam is all good so I've heard.... but I can attest to the Truffle Fries and the Coconut Cake.  We will return to experience everything that is JCT."}, {"review_id": "iYDgDBWRgRRS4KC10P7Vmw", "user_id": "VZMT6MI5kBjasvjlCWj2QA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "\"Meat and potatoes\" but subbed for Mac and cheese.

I loved the wine selection but I love that the cider and the beer are locally sourced. (btw - I am a big cider fan, so this place def. got an additional star just for that!)2. The fried chicken dish is really good. It's basically fancy fried chicken but it is cooked really well3. Chicken & Dumplings - GET THIS! It is really heavy for a main meal though so make sure to wear stretchy clothes (ladies - you know what I am talking about!)4. Dessert - I wish I could remember what I had... It was amazing and a little on the sweet side. Sorry I can't remember but GET A DESSERT! Next time I go back, I want to try these:1. Steak Tartare2. Hickory Roasted Heritage Pork Chop3.

We got the scallops and they were a little overcooked and the sauce was a little underwhelming on the flavor. The mussels didn't go well with the wine sauce because they wine was not cooked out of it completely, leaving it bitter. The avocado toast was the only thing we liked because it was light and fresh. The crab also gave it a unique seafood flavor. This review is weighted heavily on the food and not the service because the service was outstanding. Our server was very attentive and nice.

When we walked in there were a bunch of spots at the bar (we contemplated eating at the bar) but were told it would be 10 minutes to have a table. 10 minutes didn't seem bad, so we decided to wait. 15 minutes went by and we asked if the table was ready. They said it would be 5 more minutes. This continued and we ended up actually waiting 50 minutes for a table. The last time we asked them they looked annoyed. I understand the flip side, I hate being asked the same question over and over. However, we had told them from the beginning we didn't mind eating at the bar.They sat us outside, but there are heaters so we were nice and toasty. It took them another 10 minutes to ask for our order. We ordered right away, because we knew what we wanted. It took them 20 minutes just to bring us our drinks. It was terrible. Again, I've been here many times and I always enjoy it but I just felt it was unacceptable. It wasn't crazy busy, so we didn't understand why it took so long for everything."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/jct-kitchen-and-bar-atlanta?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
