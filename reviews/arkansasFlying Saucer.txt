They have over 100 beers on tap. If you join the beerknurd club you can get a plate on the wall. You have to drink 200 beers but only 3 a night. The food is awesome. My favorite is the bratzel. It is one of their amazing pretzels with Swiss cheese, cut up bratwurst and green onions. It comes with spicy mustard but I swap that for ranch. Their cheese dip is good. The pizza is alright. There are many sandwiches to choose from. They are all good. The wings and loaded cheese fries will not disappoint either.

Tons of beers on the tap. The food options are not that many and only a few are worthy options like the chicken sandwich, the german plate and the Shepard's pie. The decor is funky with name plates.

It's seemingly pricey. However, It's a cool environment, tons of beers on draft and in bottle. They have pool tables and darts in the downstairs area which is awesome. The food has been decent every time I've visited; prices are OK, not great but not cheap. I would like to see them expand the menu a bit but I'm not the boss ( wish I was LOL ) my only complaint is that they are Always always always out of something, In the 4 times I've visited- they've been out of a beer or cider that someone I was with or myself tried to order even though it was still on the menu  :( - the staff is friendly as heck"}, {"review_id": "PG2NqFG2iFsbsokHBIb3zA", "user_id": "2D7Zqx2qFnz0ARNNfcz8oA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Some of the very best beers around!

I'm liking what they're putting down and we barely know each other! Tonight was my second visit, and I've found myself at The Flying Saucer twice in one week! Also, randomly, both times we had Lynise as our server. This could be the start of something big, right?! (Lol) First visit, we were on a mini March Madness pub crawl and tonight we were getting our bearings while deciding on our downtown dinner spot. (We had a Gus' FAIL tonight and strolled across the street to recoup! -- but don't get me started.) Anywho, when we were seated and then greeted again by our exact same server, I thought to myself... ok, definitely time to review! Lynise is great and super helpful! On my first visit, she introduced me to 2 new ciders that I now love! I told her that I'm an Angry Orchard girl and she recommended the StrongBow and the Pineapple-something cider, then hooked me up with samples. I loved them both, ordered both and gave one to the hubs (but it was really for me), and I even re-ordered the StrongBow again when I returned tonight! The hubs and I really like the rocket-tots (they had me at the fried egg) and the great vibe at FS! I've been eyeing a few more things on the menu and I'll be back to try more. I guess my FS appeal has been more about Lynise's awesome service and less about anything else, but that totally works for me! LYNISE, YOU ROCK and you've made repeat customers out of us!"}, {"review_id": "PL51aJKBJCL2Aby7I0SHdg", "user_id": "cpaJHLSy9MSnyMKiJ3rPtA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Loved this place. Over 200 beers available at all times. Although the menu was small, it was very good. They have a special every day. I got the buffalo chicken salad the first night and it was incredible.

The flying saucer has a very neat curb appeal. The big front windows open up to the side walk to enjoy fresh air. They have a huge selection of beer & Mondays are $3 drafts. We taste tested several beers, enjoyed a couple with dinner that was also very yummy.

You know all my weaknesses, and we barely know each other!They've got darts, they've got pool, they've got all the beer in the world to try, and they've even got evening specials during the week (pint nights, trivia, happy hour)I hear they even have food, but that would have taken far too much valuable beer real-estate for me on my first run ;) But, I will be back!They also have a club, where you have a digital punch-card and log every beer you've had there, when you've gotten up to a certain amount, they put a plate on the wall. If you're a real rockstar and keep going long enough after that? Gold plate! Nice!There are two spaces here, an upstairs/bar area - which includes sitting tables, and a nice group seating area in the front and smaller tables in the bar proper (and bathrooms) - and then a downstairs/basement area. The downstairs is in the main bar to the right, and it's much larger than I expected. Down there they have cozy lounge spaces for even larger groups, pool tables, and darts.To get darts or pool balls, you have to go upstairs and turn in your ID, then trade back when you leave.It is a regional chain (and I believe your beer-club numbers carry with you?) but it's still a local watering hole of sorts as well.It's a very popular place, particularly on weekends and evenings. It's still well worth going to, but expect a bit of a crowd."}, {"review_id": "yDL1Z9KAdiTBeBdf70ZOcQ", "user_id": "WjuTjjQe5joJGlANtocO4g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/20/2017", "text": "Cool place for some local AR beer.
