I'm not blown away by any means but my burger here was hot, juicy and delicious. I like the bottled real sugar soda options. The shakes are pretty yummy. I wish they wouldn't call the French fries freedom fries. Horrible and very politically off putting. It's a little dirty, it could use a sweep up and table wipe down much more often. I suggest going in the day, the night crew is busy and the quality and flavor seem to decline with an increase of patrons. I will definitely eat a burger here again...but I'll skip the poorly named fries unless rebranded."}, {"review_id": "L3zreM2iy29XIJCzGPi7Wg", "user_id": "WNJAlgroEswoeXVQ8BcnUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Best Burgers.  A must try for anyone visiting.  Fries are hand cut all day and the burgers are simply excellent.  You can't go wrong with any of the burgers, not much else to say beyond this place is great!  All other burgers are compared to how they measure up to Abe's, sorry everyone else."}, {"review_id": "GATxGnShRZaXu4HXUNtDpw", "user_id": "jXTtbrv8jhHDKJVMBxQvOQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "We stopped into Lincoln for a short trip and decided to try Honest Abe's because it had good reviews and was one of the few non-franchise restaurants in the area. I was pleased with the eclectic decor inside, but became truly excited when a nice guy in line behind me struck up a conversation to ask if I'd eaten there before. He said I'd chosen the best restaurant and that there was no way I wouldn't like it. Whether he was a paid actor or the ghost of burgers past, the guy did not steer me wrong. He suggested the Eye of the Thai-ger fries, which were topped with slaw, ground peanuts, and Thai peanut sauce. He also suggested the Greatest Burger Ever, and it's bacon, onions, and special sauce caused it to jump to my top five. I also shared an Honest Salad. The vegan patty and apple vinaigrette were perfect-- good vegan food for a burger joint. If I'm in Lincoln again soon, I'll be back at Honest Abe's."}, {"review_id": "dk24bJiUcC1CeJGX2CoHjQ", "user_id": "AObj48xwUckeh_yQzZYRqg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "First time here.   There was a small group of people milling about just inside the door trying to figure out the menus.   Two of the three menu screens (large LCD screens) were off and I guess that caused some confusion.

They have the classic burger but also really creative burger variations. I had one with bacon, barbecue sauce, and potato chips on it and it was delicious. They have the same group of burgers all the time and then a rotating list of burgers, so there is always something new to try if you want to. Also, their Parmesan truffle fries are super good and addicting. They don't come with the burgers but are only a few dollars extra.

It was an interesting combo, with arugula pesto, blackberry jam, and salt and vinegar chips. It a perfect mix of flavors! The fries, we just got regular fries. Not sure I'd get them again... but it seems like the right thing to do with a burger. The shakes looked good... i didn't get one but they looked like a great topping to a burger meal. I will say the shakes were about $5... burger was about $8 and friend another $2... so a little pricey but it was much better than a McDonald's burger, times 10!"}, {"review_id": "nPducEqg2aDkL873Io3zrg", "user_id": "UYrrKmvJV18KJCwFx4d9CQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "So delicious!

I will say the shake was really good and there were a bunch of options for shakes on the menu that I'd definitely like to try. But we did not like the burgers. Part of the reason may be they didn't ask how we wanted them done (and we forgot to say), so they were medium well/well done, which we aren't fans of. The buns were good though! However, I barely ate any of my burger. The parmesan fries were good and you get a lot of them, but they weren't great. I've had way better. Could have used some aioli sauce to dip them in. The process was a little odd too... we walked in not knowing the menu and felt a little pressured to order right away with the guy at the register staring at us.

As a base the buns and burgers themselves are amazing, which allows an easy transition to some crazy toppings that aren't over the top on flavor. They boast a rotating menu of burgers and fries unique to the season. Staff are friendly and the decor is simple with a polished ruggedness.

The whole place is very evocative of the city of Lincoln, a town that specializes in burgers. A lot of people are into the rotating burgers, but I'm of the strong opinion that burgers are not to be messed with.  We went with the classics. My girlfriend went for the \"Best Burger Ever\" and I had the \"U.S.A.\", which are essentially a standard cheeseburger and a bacon cheeseburger. Both were great burgers (especially when paired with the parmesan fries) that I would gladly plop down ten dollars for again....but I'm not sure Honest Abe's is the \"destination restaurant\" that a lot of people make it out to be. If you're in town and you've never had it, absolutely you should try it.  It is one of the best burgers you can get in Lincoln. That said, if you live in town, I'm not sure why you would go out of your way to eat here regularly. It's a little greasy and similar, high quality burgers can be found else where at lower prices (honestly, the burger at the Red Fox on West O is comparable, and it costs all of $5). It also comes off as a little....I don't know, silly.....to name your burger \"The Greatest Burger Ever\" when you can get a better burger down the street (at Leadbelly, where the burger patty is thicker, so the flavor of the meat shines more). I think a lot of the love for this place comes from their rotating menu of speciality burgers, but those have never been my bag. Peanut butter or honey siracha slaw or sweet and sour cream cheese sound great, but they overtake the flavor of the burger too much. I read a lot of Anthony Bourdain, and a quote comes to mind: \"Some things never get old. Some things are just classic. You never lose appreciation for them. Your enthusiasm may wax and wane ever so slightly, but you always come back. Whether it's the Rolling Stones Let it Bleed or doing it doggie style, good is simply good. There may be other things in life, you can pretty much spend eternity considering the matter of the former, or latter, but you'd be hard pressed to improve on either of them\". The same goes for a classic burger.I'm probably being too negative. Honest Abe's is freaking great, and you should try it."}, {"review_id": "dJiu5uqik9LXWW5UXFm0jA", "user_id": "pozrBI9PGiw7i6XYUHD9rw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/15/2017", "text": "Unexpectedly delicious burger place! We were told by some local friends to come here and I was very skeptical once we arrived. The outside of the location we went to was kind of gross looking and in a strip mall. I was expecting more of a sit down experience with a waiter/waitress but it is more low key than that. We both orders the best burger ever with Parmesan truffle fries and awesome sauce. The burgers were amazing! I love that they use nice buns that don't get soggy. The fries were the best part for me especially with the \"awesome\" sauce which is some sort of  creamy garlic and Cuban spice mix. We will definitely be back!
