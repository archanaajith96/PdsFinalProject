Ordered the sour cabbage with +1 spice, probably could go +2, but it is an extra dollar per spice level. You can have more than 1 broth (split pot) but they will charge double or however much the broth cost. Each meat plate is $5 ($3 during happy hour 4-6pm). Consists of the thin slice cuts and probability about 10-15 slices. Vegetables and seafood are Saran wrapped in the fridge and are priced by plate color from $3-5. There are black $10 plates for premium such as lobster tails. For 2 girls we had: beef tongue x1, lamb x1, watercress, lobster roll, and glass noodles. Not much but we were stuffed! Probably could've tried more if we had a larger party. Sauce bar free for all! Take advantage since there are so many choices to mix and try. Free shaved ice at the end, but didn't care much for it. Very sweet pink and orange bobas. I couldn't identify what the white pudding was but it was bitter and so was the coffee pudding on top. Would opt out of it to reduce waste. Parking is free in the lot but difficult since there is a lot out front shared by many businesses.

My server, realizing I'd never before been, pointed me to favorite broths (a garlic-based one) and favorite dipping sauces (a sesame one and a house-made shoyu).  Those dipping sauces - and all that I tried (there were about 15 on offer) were the icing on the cake; just delicious.  Sweet Home well manages the urge to linger.  You have your table for 90 minutes and at 60 minutes they bring out your free dessert, a creative way to say both \"thank you\" and \"please think about moving along\".  That free dessert?  Having never been to Taiwan I had no understanding of the photos I'd seen of this dessert.  Taiwan Shave Ice is NOT Hawaiian Shave Ice.  The dessert here features shave ice buried beneath  a  cornucopia of toppings including boba and custard and a host of other intriguing textures and flavors.  It's smooth, cold, and an immensely satisfying coda to the experience that is Sweet Home Cafe.  Before leaving Honolulu I passed by a second outlet of Sweet Home Cafe, right there in Waikiki so for visitors without a car, that outpost might be more convenient.  A daily happy hour offers an AYCE version of the above but honestly, for only a couple dollars more during non-HH, I consumed plenty.  Sweet Home Cafe brought something new and fun into my evening and I couldn't have been more satisfied.  Odds of a return visit are 100%."}, {"review_id": "NMIrfJmcYD2LlkovOsectw", "user_id": "h9_fjt5vrx2oRocePqepig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "This popular and delicious hot pot restaurant will get you better acquainted with both the people you're eating with and the strangers that you are sitting two inches from and maybe backing your chair into.

SHC stands out compared to the other hot pot offerings in Honolulu in terms of price and menu choices; it is on-par with most others in terms of food quality. The price here is good, but becomes great if you come between 4 and 6 during happy hour. Plates of vegetables, mushrooms, and seafood are $3-$5 -- you should expect to purchase about 5 plates per person. SHC offers 10+ interesting and creative broth options, more than other hot pot restaurants I have visited. The food at SHC is largely fresh and high-quality, this being said 1 of the plates I had tasted like it had been in the freezer too long. I am not subtracting a star for this because the overall quality was good and the restaurant is not expensive. There is an adjacent parking lot that fills up quickly -- do not park in front of the dumpsters or in spots labeled reserved (a car towed at this shopping center during my visit)."}, {"review_id": "kENEXqeJHSeQMx3SEWNndw", "user_id": "QIeAVTBAkSIKHiph0PU6yg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Like hot pots? Then this is a place you need to try. This place offers your typical hot pot in several different broths.  I prefer the spicy version to have. A little extra kick but the others are just as good.Unlike other hot pot, places you can go into the fridge to grab your own vegetables, meats, fish cake, etc. but what truly makes them unique are their sauces. Most places offer a couple sauces but this place offers an entire counter of sauces to mix and match with green onions and/or cilantro.  I recommend the Garlic Butter Sauce (be sure to take your time and grab the garlic and slightly drain the butter into the container before scooping into your saucer - you'll get the tasty garlic and butter to add to your rice or dip your meets and vegetables into without being overwhelmed by just the butter).  I also recommend the soy garlic sauce with green onions as well.  With so many options for sauces mix and match and enjoy a different meal each time and each bite. One nice thing about this place is the dessert that comes complimentary with your order. It comes in a huge bowl with a mixture of shaved ice, almond float, mochi, coffee jello, and some other goodies. Great mixture of flavors and the refreshing taste helps to cut the salty or spicy broths you just ate. Aside from waiting outside of you come during busy hours, the service is quick and they are very attentive to guests needs. Otherwise just flag someone down and they'll take care of you right away.  Just come a little early or late. There are quite a bit of seats as they opened a second side to seat guests (both sides are fully staffed and have everything in terms of sauces and foods available).Parking is a bit tricky as there is a small lot that is used by other businesses and limited street parking. Worth making the effort. For food I normally order one broth for 3 people though I've seen others order two (there's more than enough; you can even take the broth and soup home like other places which I would recommend).  With all of the vegetables, mushrooms, meat, tendon, etc our bill normally runs about $60 or just under for 3 people.  But as always there are leftovers so factor that into your cost of you like to take home leftovers. Fairly reasonable in terms of hot pot places and the amount of food you'll get. Never walked out of here hungry.Atmosphere wise it's fault crowded with enough room to pass by and not hit other patrons next to you. There will be an aroma when you go in from everyone cooking but nothing so bad that your clothes will be reeking after.All in all a place worth trying if you are in the area.

Their broth and sauces are superior compared to others in the area. The sour cabbage broth ( non spicy ) is my personal favorite. The guys working are pretty chill and laid back and there is a sort of buddy system going on that makes things run smoothly in the restaurant. The shave ice at the end of your meal is just so delicious, one of the many reasons why I love this place. Including being located next to Ross to walk off your meal thereafter. The only trouble here is finding at least 2 people with a healthy appetite to come with me. Parking can be challenging but there are plenty parking opportunities in the surrounding area.

With no other hot pot places to compare it to, I can only say it has been a very good experience both times I have been here. Many thanks to the Yelpers that have reviewed and explained how this works because this is not a simple endeavor. You kinda want to know what you are doing ahead of time.I was super keen to try this place after doing some research and locating a highly-rated joint near home. The decor is ok, nothing fancy for sure. When you leave you will smell like steaming hot pot so go in knowing that and you will not be upset when garlic (or whatever) wafts off your jacket and jeans for days.As many have described, you order a soup base (we got the house special, which we were told was vegetarian), and choose between one large broth in the hot pot or two broths in a divided pot. The pot and a warmer sits on your table. Getting a divided pot costs more so don't do it like we did and get the same broth. That made no sense but we were unprepared for that choice. This works particularly well if you have vegetarians and meat-eaters dining together. After you order you go to the refrigerator case(s) in the back and choose your vegetables and proteins, noodles or whatever else suits your fancy. The plates are color-coded so you just stack them up on your table and the waiter will count them at the end before tallying them and giving you the bill. We particularly love their sauces! There were spicy sauces, oily lemongrass sauces, so many lovely sauces. Apparently these change often and they are complimentary. The staff only ask that you don't take more than you plan to eat. That's fair. We wanted to try them all but decided we'd have to come back to do that.The veggie choices are great. So many things to choose from including lotus root, which I LOVE. They also have puffed bean curd and tofu and other bean curd items. The noodle choices should make everyone happy. And I believe they give you complimentary rice, although we didn't want it so don't take my word on this.Not that you really need it after that gigantic pot of soup, but they give you a complimentary shave ice with tons of stuff I cannot identify. It was quite good considering I don't like cold food or dairy.Parking sucks because the place is popular. The lot has been full each time we have come and you either wait for someone to leave or you look for street parking. Or you get lucky. Don't let this or your smelly clothes stop you from coming here.

Having no other experience to compare it to, I can't say if it is better or worse than other Hot Pot places but I really liked the food, the BYOB friendly atmosphere, and the communal dining concept.I'm downgrading a star because I was not thrilled with the parking situation (they do have their own lot but it is jammed with cars so if you are very lucky you might time it right and get a spot when someone is leaving but otherwise plan on street meter parking which I detest based on principle) and I'm not a fan of their flow management which takes no reservations and wants you to arrive, put your name on a door clipboard list and kind of stand around in the parking lot waiting for a free table. It is a nice touch that they have a bucket of umbrellas in the waiting area in case of rain and that they try to limit you to no more than 2 hrs at a table (their signal is that they start to bring you dessert at the 60 min mark) but it is difficult to come here with a large party because you are really subject to getting lucky and hope that several tables clear simultaneously so you can all sit together. What is great though is the fun you can have when a pot of your selected broth style is put on the burner in front of you. There are 15 styles to choose from and for sliced meats, you tell the server which ones you want and how much you would like. For everything else such as vegetables, tofu, dumplings and even some proteins such as squid, go to the freezers at the rear and take what you want. They are priced according to plate color which all gets added up at the end. My party made about 4 trips to the freezer over the course of our meal and we had so many great things. Soak them in the pot like a food jacuzzi and pull out at will. It is amazing how the broth takes on a life of its own as it changes flavors over the course of the meal depending on what has been in it. Towards the end, use the provided ladle to make a last pass from the bottom and see what surprises have been lurking there and missed by everyone else. Kind of like dredging for a body in the lake only coming up with something in this setting is much more pleasant. The 20 or so condiment dipping sauces are awesome and free (Loved the garlic/ginger/green onion one the best!) as is the arrival of dessert politely suggesting to your table that you finish up and get the hell out because people are waiting! I can only describe the dessert as a large bowl of communal shave ice with a bunch of sweet syrups, jellies, tapioca balls, and curd like substances dumped on the top. It looks like an alarming disaster that a 4 year old would have put together in a cooking contest but somehow it works. This is a very fun and social way to dine. It promotes a lot of discussion, interaction and even some competition to get the last good surprise out of the pot! It is tight quarters, a lot of sharing and others touching food that you will eventually swallow so if you are an introvert, OCD or a germ freak, you might be better off staying home."}, {"review_id": "zE2_GEyOlzkU_6QvQiTbhQ", "user_id": "ovujdKvXcqmH4EDHc1tzmQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/25/2017", "text": "This was my second time coming to eat here and I think that my second experience was way better. The first time, I chose a different broth and since a lot of the choices are taiwanese based (and I'm not a huge fan of the taiwanese broths) I didn't get to enjoy it as much. The second time, I got the summer garlic broth which is supposed to be more shoyu based which was really delicious. I love the layout of being able to select the different ingredients you want to put in. They had all types with different types of fish cakes, dumplings, noodles, vegetables, meats, etc. so the choices are endless!From 4-6:00, they have cheaper pricing where it is $3 per plate of meat (the beef tongue was my favorite) and $17.95 per person for unlimited plates from the fridge. If not, then you can just pay according to how many plates you take from the fridge. Also, there is a place for you to make your own sauces to dip the shabu shabu in which I always look for when going to shabu shabu restaurants. The waiters are also really great. They constantly filled my water, asked if I needed anything else and were really helpful when I was indecisive of which broth to choose. However, don't fill up too much on the shabu shabu because their dessert is the BEST. They provide complimentary taiwanese style shave ice for everyone to share. It has boba, jellies, coffee flan, and more! Hands down, I would come here just for the shave ice. The layout of the restaurant is a little different because they are two separate spaces with a salon in between so the workers are actually running back and forth. However, Parking is a little difficult since the lot is shared and also some of the stalls have time limits. If possible, try to find parking on the streets before you turn into the lot.
