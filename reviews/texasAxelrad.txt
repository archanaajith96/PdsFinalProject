Who doesn't love sitting in hammocks? Even if it was raining. Axelrad provided everyone with rain cover-ups, so we can still enjoy the live music outside. Parking is a bit limited. There's a small lot in the front or street parking nearby. You must have an ID to go in. I believe it's 21 of age. Apparently it doesn't matter if you look older than 21, an ID is a-must to get their entrance wristband. There are frequent food trucks and nearby food joints for your food options. Their ginger beer which is nonalcoholic is a good choice if you don't drink. The taste is richer than the ones you get from a can.  You can order drinks inside. There are a few seatings with TVs. It gets crowded when there is a game on. Outside, there are various type of hammocks from singles to the ones where you can lay down. Careful on some hammocks because they might be broken. It's best to not sit more than 2 people on one hammock. Love the chill vibe here with the vibrant lights strung everywhere."}, {"review_id": "X29P2bWJ57NR2Rl6RvBDPA", "user_id": "nWxor12uSy5MryaJK28CSA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "What is the meaning of life? Am I happy? Seemingly endless questions that throughout the ages are left for the next generation to solve. While universities around the world strive to push the boundaries of technology further, Axelrad is the location of modern day philosophers. When you walk in you automatically sense a vibe unlike any other. It's a bar thats venue sprawls out into the open, and engulfs a crowd from all walks of life. There's the picnic tables, the hammocks, and hammock chair contraptions, and some more traditional seating available. If you're brave enough to go to a bar alone it's easier here with the easiest conversation starter of \"what the is going on with those pictures on the screen\". As far as drinks go their happy hour and drink of the day is very reasonably priced, and you can have a good time without having to be featured on the Forbes 400. The one caveat to this place is when you come here in the rain. There's a place to get some cover, but overall there's just too many people and not enough space. They alleviate the problem a bit with ponchos scattered around, but it's not the same The iconic tree looks down at you from above and lights the nights away. There's so much to like about axelrad, and they really cultivated a great atmosphere. With pups and people around don't be surprised if existential questions are solved after only 1 or 2 drinks down."}, {"review_id": "0_sghesL0yuBrWEivZ_qgA", "user_id": "YPZ2PyHFvbgtgZol0YY0OA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "I've been going here for a while now, and just realized that I have not written a review!

Parking is all street parking unless you want to park in a parking lot for a fee across the street. We had found a spot in the small park so that's where we went. They check your ID as soon as you walk in and give you a wristband. Otherwise, without ID or underaged, you get a X marked on the back of your hands. We had a friend who didn't have her ID but didn't plan to drink anyway get marked. HAHA ! Avery Lilikoi Kepolo beer was the one I got. There was a few others that sounded interesting but the bartender said this was one of her favorites so I went with that. Very bright yellow color. Not that bitter. Quite refreshing actually xD The cool thing about this beer garden is their outside area. Very chill \"backyard\" style layout. They have a lot of hanging hammocks on one side for people to sit/lay in as well as tables/chairs in the area next over. Luigi's Pizzeria is also on site as well as another food truck (forgot what they had, maybe tacos?) Saw a lot of people order whole pizzas to share with their party's. It wasn't too busy on the Sunday afternoon we went but it was the warmest day of the few days we were there. I had wished there was some sort of cover over the hammocks. It felt amazing when there was some cloud cover but got pretty hot when the sun was blaring its rays onto us.  Would be a nice place to chill on a cooler day. I don't mind being outside but coming from a city that was cold, the extra warmth was a bit un-used to.

Great selection of beers and ciders, and they have plenty of classic and inventive cocktails too. Also you can go inside and check out their board game shelf, which is cool! They have Balderdash, trivia games, Clue, Scattergories, Monopoly, and a lot more -- probably quite a few are missing pieces but that's to be expected lol. There's also always a food truck onsite, and Luigi's is right next door too. Last time I was here there was also a bubble egg waffle place filling the air with the fresh, deliciously warm scent of batter. Bathrooms have only 2 stalls for the girls (and I think similar for the guys) and there's almost always a line; the guys' is often as long as the girls'! My most recent visit, I was suddenly hit by a miserable stomachache but I didn't want to leave since it was a planned get-together that took ages to coordinate. One of the bartenders (my boyfriend sadly didn't catch his name :( ) was super kind and gave a cup of ginger ale and separate cup of ice chips for free after hearing I was all sad and achey. :') So nice!"}, {"review_id": "insUmggr1XbC6kAFf2izcw", "user_id": "fShXOnCc_qnmX5BEk_8LNg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Great spot, near my old neighborhood and HCC Central campus, to grab some brews and just chill in a backyard-like setting. The selections of beers (especially local ones) is pretty vast. You can grab specialty mixed concoctions, if your heart desires that. The \"yard\" has all sorts of seating. You can choose a full hammock, a sitting hammock, high chairs at the high pub table, typical chairs for typical tables, benches, etc. They have an inside bar, outside bar, and a small mobile trailer in the yard that works as an additional bar, so you're never without a way to refill your glass.There seem to be more pups than kids running around and I see that they have a projector and a stage.

When I have been later at night you'll also often see live music or some kind of entertainment. An added bonus is the pizza place next door which will deliver your pizza while you're at axelrad.

The music is mainstream and makes every one feel welcome. The hammocks are super cute too.

We ended up playing Taboo.I like how this bar is open-air, it had a very hip backyard vibe to it and much of the food/drinks was being sold from trailers or food trucks.!The impeachment cocktail was pretty good. A little too sweet but much better after the ice had melted.The coolest thing about this bar was the hammock section at this bar, I love that you can admire the stars/night sky while lying down and sipping on your cocktail.
