They give you a bag of tortilla chips with your order as well. I got a steak bowl and it was actually really tasty and flavorful, but if I had not been to a place like this before, it would have been a horrible experience due to the lack of helpfulness of the staff serving the food. They just wanted me to rush through. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt that they were just really busy."}, {"review_id": "8ka7iVlVrT1OKV1lXVGfBQ", "user_id": "DutVKv2_Orvh9qG1uUOgsg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/7/2017", "text": "Came here for dinner after work and for my first time coming here, it was awesome.

They had me at free chips! I found this place by accident getting off the interstate and looking for a bottle shop. So happens right next door is Diablos, so upon exiting with my beverage of the weekend. I popped over to quickly glance at the menu and decided to be bit adventures and order take away. What a great choice I made! I got the chicken bowl with almost everything on it. I may have scraped the bottom it was so good. Only thing is I wish they would explain the sauces a bit more, but after two visits now I think the spicy one on the line is the best. If you are in need of a quick meal, that's fresh and semi healthy drop by."}, {"review_id": "MX2ZqDdDTIDhZS5Z9O0V0Q", "user_id": "n59y0c6Grqq9pwbfUgmJeQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/15/2017", "text": "First time at Diablo's and was not too dissapointed.  Chicken Quesadilla bowl was tasty but I ordered a dollop of sour cream and as you can see from the pic, looks like a small river. Also, I would have preferred a corn tortilla bowl for more crispness and flavor.  I liked that they had sauteed and fresh jalapenos (has a kick)."}, {"review_id": "7eEdOeL2QXFFaHyh0KDNJg", "user_id": "XTkuInJdNwHbuw_TJNW7lw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2017", "text": "Awwwweeee mannnnn!!!!! I was so disappointed to learn that there is no Chipotle near me. But Diablo's is definitely the next best thing if not better.First off, they have the same exact set up as Chipotle so it's pretty easy to order. But the things that set Diablo's apart is the fact that they have the option for jalapeños (fresh or pickled), sour cream (regular or spicy), Queso (which is pretty good and the manager gave us some on the house try out) and 2 different dressings for bowls/salads.The staff was really quick, nice and attentive (something that has been a hard find for me in Augusta thus far). The manager even came up and noticed that we were military, gave us some extras and made sure that we were taken care of, which is dope!Overall I rate this experience at Diablo's a 4.5/5. I'll definitely be returning and I hope that you'll give them a visit as well!"}, {"review_id": "HY8lFj3QejQnS9QzZj03rA", "user_id": "cWXOC4CzQFZPLAS7jXlNUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/28/2017", "text": "There's no Chipotle for miles, but this place definitely fills the void very well.

The ingredients are also fresh...some of the best guacamole ever!! They have a spicy guac that I love too (when I feel like kicking it up a notch!) The portions are huge though...so you will be very full; I usually can not eat it all. If I want a quesadilla I get a kids meal because the portion is usually enough. I don't have a particular recommendation for food to try because everything is so good...just choose one! The seating includes comfortable booths (comfortably seats 4 adults), tables (4 chairs each), bar height seating, and patio seating. I like that they have complimentary charging stations (at their booths only) for phones, tablets, etc.Wheeler Rd location is our favorite (although we are looking forward to the opening of the Grovetown location). Their sweet tea is some of the best in Augusta!"}, {"review_id": "m_Ozla_eq_DKF4yaEjZZzg", "user_id": "GyFYCr09z16eznrqs-X_6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "Love this spot.

If you're looking for something in the area that's comparable to Chipotle, then this is your best bet (although I personally think that this is better). I find myself always getting a bowl with the tortilla on the side (something I started doing at Chipotle many, many years ago), and as many chips as they'll give me. I think the staff at this particular location is very friendly and nice, and they always have enough food (never out of anything). My only complaints really are that since they get so busy (at lunchtime in particular), you may be hard pressed to find a clean table; but as long as you get there before the lunch rush or later in the day, you'll be fine. :)"}, {"review_id": "89JHXx1bWP61qc8hmwRZ2w", "user_id": "tXYs5fXKgON3m1am4Fd17g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/2/2017", "text": "This Is so far my favorite place to get a burrito.
