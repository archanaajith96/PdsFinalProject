Whisper \"Bombay Darbar\" in my ear, and my mouth waters like Pavlov's dog. Been years since my last review, so here's an update. I'm going keep it simple. I eat a lot of indian food (check my check ins). Bombay Darbar is the BEST in south Florida. What I suggest: Lamb Rogenjosh, Lamb Pasanda (it's similar to Korma. Cashew sauce), butter chicken, tikka masala, biryani (lamb, chicken, etc), and the garlic and cheese naan. Get any of these and your mouth will thank me. If you are new to indian food and are a little hesitant, get chicken tikka (it's similar to grilled chicken, but it is cooked with spices and in a clay oven), but make sure your friends get one of the saucy meals so you can look at their food and die of jealousy. The restaurant is nice enough for date night, so you can dress up if you would like. If you're reading this, stop combing indecisively through Yelp and just make some reservations for this spot. You won't regret it."}, {"review_id": "sBsgCcPpiOyxlkHzzh9VcA", "user_id": "G1Tuuqni8vc3v6nYPlY2XQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Don't know what all the hype is about.

I thought you a snobby, trendy restaurant with unauthentic flavors. Then again, I was but a novice, new to your fine cuisine and unaware of what was good and what was bad.You are and I want you to know it... repeat after me...Delicious. Delectable. Delightful.I can say it now sans doubt. You reign supreme on the Indian scene in Miami. I find myself exploring the entire city and none compares to your taste. I even find myself thinking about you on my travels to other cities.I do not know how you did it, but you have ensnared me. Bewitched me. Taken me for your own.At this point, I have visited you on dates, with friends, and I would probably visit you alone if it weren't for the fact that I feel compelled to share the love.I have had the papadam, savored the samosas, munched on the pakora, enjoyed your tandoori wings. I have battled with spices on my tried and true chicken tikka masala. You are the reason I love spice.I have laughed and been merry with drinks and desserts. That mango kulfi definitely hits the spot after a long day. The same can be said for your presence.Your customer service is the best. Whenever I have questions, your staff always answers them promptly. They go above and beyond. Making a reservation is easy, too, and I am happy you have them.Most times I visit you, though, a reservation is unnecessary. You are spacious and vast. You work quick to please and provide personal attention. Honestly, you have become my restaurant crush.More so, you have become my favorite restaurant. Please, please, keep it up. You are one of a kind in the 305.Yours sincerely,Marilu F.P.S. I really do hope I did justice to you in this updated review."}, {"review_id": "UsNY94rdJ0NMhDKjnbikfA", "user_id": "5Nxi7ACyRq7MDtYZct82eA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "Food: The food here was excellent!! I ordered the butter chicken and was very satisfied with the meal. It was so creamy and just melted in my mouth. I love my moms butter chicken and this comes in a close second!! The chicken was made very well and I thought the food was great. I couldn't finish the whole dish and I think 1 order per person of an entree is more than enough! I also highly recommend ordering the garlic naan to eat with the entree. Overall, I recommend ordering the butter chicken and garlic naan for a very satisfying dinner! Service: I only gave this place 4 stars, because the service was very slow on the day that we went. Our food took a little over 45 minutes which was disappointing as our party was very hungry!! The servers were very nice, but this place can get busy so you might have to wait a while till your food comes out."}, {"review_id": "xDDk3zVQEQrnbCjO0-HEhQ", "user_id": "2czWH22WXdKhBK8RTwtwaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "TLDR - The Bollywood videos playing in the background may be a lil extra, but the food will get your taste buds dancing for sure The food here is some of the best Indian in Miami. I've spoken to some friends who would disagree on it being the absolute 10000% best, but hey, they're not the ones writing this review. While the portion sizes could be a bit larger, the flavors of the food are out of this world. One of my favorites is the saag gosht, lamb cubes blasted with flavor in this creamy spinach based sauce. One of the best. Always get some naan on the side (I suggest the garlic), and don't forget to ask for extra helpings of the papadam (these thin lentil crispy flatbreads that are paired with some chutneys to dip). Other entrees I love are the classic butter chicken and the mutter paneer is a great vegetarian choice. I also really like the atmosphere here. Very lively, well decorated, and the friendliest staff. Protips:1) if you haven't yet, and have a sweet tooth, try the mango lassi (it's like a mango yogurt smoothie)2) Drench your carbs. Douse whatever rice or naan you have in all the sauces. Just do it."}, {"review_id": "6nXSKpaWX-g5v9TCc0C53Q", "user_id": "35rPFixK1aLtysqHGjfvkg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "I don't know why I haven't written anything sooner! I love their food and have been coming here for the last couple of years. Before trying them out, I was not a fan of Indian food due to a bad experience at another Indian restaurant that claimed to be the \"best\" in Miami where I experienced food poisoning. :(At first, I was reluctant to try Bombay Darbar but thankfully, BD proved to be the spot for Indian cuisine experience. :)The ambience is fun and modern--not your typical Indian place overloading on the tchotchkes or incense (I don't mind them, but I like it when I see traditional restaurants think outside the box). The service is attentive, polite, and helpful when explaining certain menu items. They are also great at customizing the heat scale for any of your orders. Mild is mild -not spicy at all (my Mom was able to eat it). I like my food medium spicy and it was nice amount of heat without it overpowering the food and curry flavors.Favorite things to eat? Any of their naan breads and their mango chicken curry!Unlike other most Indian restaurants, they also serve alcohol. I like coming here for lunch--good place for family style sharing food with groups, or even with your SSO. This place is a must try for those looking for great traditional Indian cuisine, as they have a menu with tons of options!Thank you, BD!"}, {"review_id": "l9pq_19cWrz8XrRxFlT6EA", "user_id": "7z5rPt_JprTFeeXH-IwKyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "My husband and I have visited this restaurant a handful of times and it never fails to satisfy us! We love bringing our friends and family to try something delicious out of their comfort zone. The Great: 1. The food: we've ordered quite a few times including: the bean soup, samosas, cheese pita bread, tandoori chicken, mango chicken, rice with shrimp, chicken masala. Each of these dishes have been delicious, rich in flavor and very filling. I get so excited every time we come here. Oh yeah and even the white rice complements each dish very well. 2. Service: staff is very friendly, from the moment you walk in, someone greets you and you are escorted to your table. The service we've had every time has been superb as everyone is very attentive, especially when it comes to filling up my glass of water and taking the dirty dishes from the table. 3. Ambiance: love the vibe here. The seating, decor, music- all is great. Looks fancy when you walk in. Perhaps the one downside is the parking which some might find to be an inconvenience. No free parking you have to park in one of the garages which there are plenty of down the street from the restaurant. We will definitely continue to come to have our Indian food here."}, {"review_id": "oI9e-aKIr6h9DSQklHHrjQ", "user_id": "FR1PW6j8Q_zCH4PlSQixGg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "This is the best Indian restaurant in Miami!!!

The last visit we had I decided to get their Malai kofta and it was seriously the best Malai Kofta I have ever eaten. Their flavors are always spot on and their medium spice level is the perfect amount of spice for me! Their naan was warm and buttery and their lassi was a perfect end to a wonderful meal.

Sure, first time I was here was 1977, and Miami was the closest South American city to the U.S. - jokes apart, food options were slim.How things change. Miami is now a magnet for arts, fun and food (don't even mention the beaches). This city is vibrant, hot, exciting. But being a world traveler, and thus able to try the most exotic dishes from Berlin to Singapore, I always complained about the lack of great Indian dishes in South Florida. Oooh I feasted on amazing Indian restaurants in Dubai, London and Hong Kong ... but nothing at home.Last night my daughter invited me to eat out, a weekly dad/daughter tradition... she suggested Darbar. I was very very skeptical that it would be above average, my expectations were low...Now I can say ... how embarrassed I am... Darbar was freaking good. Yep, on par with some of the best Indian restaurants tucked away in medieval London alleys and fancy Dubai shopping centers.Here's the low down:Food: We had the Shrimp Biryani rice, the Lamb Kadhai and the Tandoori chicken ... all very good (one caveat: the Biryani was a bit too spicy for me, wish they could tone it down a bit).Service: ...it.was.great...  our waitress was super nice and attentive, she showed concern about our experience at Darbar and was always smiling and \"simpatica\" (no translation in English for this word). When they brought the food they praised us for the superb selection we made, and later the manager showed up and also congratulated us for the choices... I felt like Bobby Flay ordering food at a restaurant in Mumbai. Cool.Pricing: a bit on the high side, but justifiable. I wish their wine offering would be a bit cheaper by the glass, but hey, all restaurants are going postal with wine prices... I don't get it (I love wine, but when I'm getting fleeced I just order water, a huge loss for the restaurant... hint hint).Overall a great experience.

Being from America's Indian food hub, Edison, NJ, (also, being the daughter of the world's best Indian cook) I can be quite choosey when it comes to this cuisine. Bombay Darbar definitely hit the spot for my naan and shaak craving. The naan was served hot and fresh out of the kitchen - mama rollin' that dough got every customer droolin' (dw, keeping my day job...) Alas, everything else was just average. I was longing for some papdi chaat, but the appetizer menu was quite unimpressive for my vegetarian self. We got the paneer pakoras, which was exceedingly bland. The accompanying chutneys (tamarind & mango) did an OK job at making up for it though. However, the fiance did loooove the tandoori chicken wings he ordered! For entree, we got the Paneer Makhani (super good!) spice level at medium high, which was exceptionally spiceless. The S.O who legit sweats at the slightest bit of spicy even thought it was bland. I'd say the spice levels are geared towards the American version of spicy, not the Indian so I'd suggest ordering a higher spice grade if you're like me and enjoy that extra kick! Tip: I'd suggest calling ahead to see if reservations are needed. We came in at 7pm on a Thursday night when literally 1/10 of the restaurant was full, but when we left at 830, every.single.table in the house was occupied.
