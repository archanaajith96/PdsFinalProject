By the end of our meal around 9, there was a semi crowded waiting area.I ordered the chicken fried steak, with croissant and eggs over easy. They were able to grill my croissant which came out very good.Our server was very welcoming and friendly. She brought over a big balloon for the little one.I also ordered my hash browns well done and they came out great.One thing I noticed on exit, is that in the waiting area they have complimentary coffee and water while you wait. That's a nice touch which I have never seen before."}, {"review_id": "ebIj3Xfe1ejqQy4g9AGOmA", "user_id": "IPgwgePGeQuc-xjqZBQraw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "This is classic diner food. I came here with a friend who had two little ones and my finacée. We waited about 30 minutes which wasn't  terrible because it was so packed. There was little room in the waiting area, but the rest of the resturant was large. The food was decent. I got the eggs Benedict and the hollandaise sauce was very buttery so I scrapped most of it off. However it was good and the eggs were poached perfectly which doesn't happen often. My finacée got the fried chicken steak with brown gravy and said it was decent as well.Overall, decent food and nice little place for breakfast."}, {"review_id": "7YHROS7nHk6Ovfoqr9M4Sg", "user_id": "NPGj_aMtE0TZXpHy_1vUFw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "This place is the stuff breakfast dreams are made of. As far as I'm concerned there is no better place for breakfast in Omaha. Last time I was here I ordered your basic pancakes and bacon which was good. Today though I ordered the 11-Worth omelette with a side of cinnamon toast (GET THE CINNAMON TOAST)and boy was it worth it! To my surprise it came with a side of magical country gravy which typically I'd be grossed out by but adding a little of it on top pulled the whole meal together. My husband who was born and raised her unlike me to my surprise had never been here. He ordered the Philly omelette with a pancake as his side and he was just as happy as I was with his choice. We will for sure be coming back here whenever we get a chance. The wait was no more than 15-20 just as the hostess up front told us it would be. What made the wait entertaining though was how many regulars came in and were immediately greeted like they were family. This entire restaurant has a great calming welcoming family vibe. Bonus: No screaming kids. My husband and I get nervous sometimes when we see highchairs but to our surprise the little ones that were their must pick up on the same vibes as us because we didn't hear a single peep. My only complaint which is very minor was the coffee. It was pretty weak but I'm sure that's so they appeal to all their clients."}, {"review_id": "VC3pU-rZ20MqW0tc9RNJoQ", "user_id": "hs8DpwHhp204x4tmuZR5ww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "We flew into Omaha and had about 3 hours while we waited for our passengers.

The everything omelette came with hashbrowns and toast. The only thing I didn't love was the slice of melted cheese rather than shredded.

With the consideration that life is short and I could get hit by a bus tomorrow, I decided to get there as soon as I possibly could, being sure to avoid all bus stops.After running around downtown Omaha, I could certainly use some comfort food which I was pretty sure I'd find as I darted across traffic to actually get to the Cafe from its parking lot (See? Suddenly the whole \"getting hit by a bus\" thing doesn't look like hyperbole, does it?).My special lady friend and I found ourselves being quickly greeted with hospitality the likes of which you only find from the most loving of people. Her dress was adored by the ladies on duty and I chuckled as they all demanded she spills the beans on where they could get the threads. We're getting to the food, I promise.I expected there to be a wait from all accounts, but we were promptly escorted to a cozy booth. The Cafe was doing a turn away business, but despite it all, waitresses efficiently maneuvered from one packed table to another, expertly addressing all customer needs and concerns.Shortly after we sat down, we had menus in our hands and after I finished my order, it was swept to the kitchen for a very prompt prep. After the blueberry muffin I ordered was delivered *maybe* 45 seconds after I requested it, our waitress was eagerly taking pictures for a large group that I can only assume was traveling through.I thought that I'd have time to catch up on my e-mailing, Twittering, etc.I was wrong.My special lady friend ordered the junior Robert E. Lee (biscuits and gravy) which is anything but \"junior\". It comes with two sausage patties and a heaping helping of hash browns. Needless to say, she couldn't finish it all.My delicious muffin devoured (and it was fresh from the oven warm, by the way), I decided to try a chicken and cheese omelet with regular hashbrowns (you can get them crispy if that's your preference) and a pancake instead of toast.The hash browns were fantastic. A golden brown outer layer and buttery taste made these perhaps the best I'd ever tasted. Looking at this omelet...well, I needed a strategy. I was later told that technically two to four eggs are used, but I'd say a more accurate estimate would be six to eight.  This is not a complaint, mind you. It was stuffed full of chicken and topped with melted cheese. I almost felt bad that I was going to inhale the thing.The eggs were amazingly perfect. Light and fluffy, expertly folded around seasoned chicken. Since I only eat reduced sugar ketchup (but enough about my life story), I prefer to use hot sauce on things like hash browns and eggs. 11W had me covered with two different types. One was a little sweeter with a bit of a kick while the other had a more mild flavor and packed a bigger punch.Then there was the pancake. Remember the best pancake you've ever had? That perfect, pillowy disc that was just golden brown on the surface and puffed up in the middle to allow as much syrup as you wanted?If this has never existed for you, it does at 11W.I felt bad that I didn't have a second stomach as there was so much more I wanted to try, but with my hunger overly satiated, I had to leave the Cafe an extremely satisfied customer and one that hopes to become a regular.Warning: This place will ruin other breakfast spots for you."}, {"review_id": "eHvU1T6z1iI8g6KPdhj9oQ", "user_id": "dImHZAWN0h5DQ48ae8TT9Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/2/2017", "text": "The wait was long, 30 minutes, but we were prepared for it.Sat down, promptly waited on and seved water and coffee.

However, on a whim... OK... full stop. Not a whim...I researched the terms \"gravy\" and \"burger\", so we ended up at 11-worth for lunch.When you're looking to eat your feelings, this is the place. For about $10 plus tip I enjoyed a messy bacon-burger (with gravy) served with a massive serving of crinkle fries (alternating dips in gravy and Heinz 57) and a large Coke. I managed to get through half the burger, half the fries and half the Coke - because the portions are THAT generous. Food arrived hot of the grill (or out of the fryer) or ice cold (for the beverage). A delightful juxtaposition of temperatures and flavors.Fast and friendly service with no judging by my need for all available condiments (did I mention that hot sauce for the ketchup?!). My feelings were eaten. My food baby was happy.Don't judge.

It is clearly a popular breakfast/brunch spot as the wait was out of control. There were several different sized parties and obviously for a bigger party you should be ready to wait quite a while because for just us two it was at least 30 minutes, likely closer to 40. Nothing particularly special about the food. It was pretty standard breakfast fare. They claim that their sausage gravy is what they're known for but it didn't taste any better than the sausage gravy you get at pretty much any other breakfast restaurant. My husband had the Robert E. Lee which was two biscuits with sausage patties, hash browns, the whole thing's drenched in sausage gravy. I had the 11-Worth Omelette which is basically a meat feast in an omelette. It came with hash browns and the bread of my choice, I chose the biscuit. It also came with sausage gravy. The biscuit was dry and cold and there wasn't butter or jam on the table. No big deal in the grand scheme of things but seems like it should just be available on every table. All in all, the service was quick and friendly, the food was standard, the wait was long, and the prices were maybe a tad steep."}, {"review_id": "I5I7MF4Gizx0TL0ESYfu4Q", "user_id": "ZaQZneZ4hu7dngCkNLBZTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/5/2017", "text": "May have found my new favorite breakfast spot in Omaha.  Located on the outskirts of downtown, 11-Worth Cafe is definitely worth the drive.  I got the KC potato casserole (steak).
