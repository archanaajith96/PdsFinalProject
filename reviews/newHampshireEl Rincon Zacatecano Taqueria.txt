They brought a bowl of more salsa and another bowl of spicier salsa. Delicious.  They refilled the chip basket when it was empty.  We ordered the homemade guac to start.  Appropriate ratio of chunky and smooth, cilantro, some onions and a barely a hint of tomato - no peel and no seeds.  YUM!There were three of us and we each ordered a different fish.  The Burrito with Chili Verde came with a salad of lettuce and dreamy dressing.  The pork was tender and melted in my mouth.  Basically it was HUGE and could have been split between two people.  I have to say that it was probably the best burrito I have had and yes, I do love Anna's. And yes, this was better. We also ordered the Gorditos, Mexican sandwiches in handmade tortilla \"bread\" which were like mini pockets about 5 inches in diameter, great chew texture with a little crackle around the edges. It was filled with steak and also came with a salad and some rice.  The steak was tender, and cut into small strips.  Very flavorful.  I felt that the tortilla was a little oily but it gave the overall gordito a nice flavor.Another order was the Fish tacos which came with a seasoned mayo, and a side of rice. The rice was perfectly seasoned.  There were 3 fish tacos. The Tilapia was lightly breaded - maybe floured and fried.  The it was tender, moist and literally melted in your mouth. As with all of the dishes, the protein was the star of the dish. There was not an over abundance of filling like lettuce, and pico, and all of that. The fish amount was quite substantial.  The whole thing was amazing.There is beer, and a lot of interesting Mexican soft drinks.I live about an hour away and I would make the drive to go here again.I highly recommend this place. It is everything I have heard about - authentic, the best, and the closest to Mexico from this side of the border!"}, {"review_id": "QLqkMAAbv7DIuymZovkt7A", "user_id": "WdoavCMH0qq8EuqyrLOhrQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "I was born and raised in California and have tried nearly every Mexican place in NH.

It's small but the service and food are excellent. We usually start with the queso fundido con chorizo, which is stellar. Gooey cheese with a flavor bomb of chorizo tucked in. My husband had the El Rincon margarita and it was delicious. The salt & spice rim was definitely spicy and the candy straw of tamarind was delicious and a good contrast to the spice.The horchata and jamaica and Sidral are a favorite of ours...we get them almost every time. We've tried the tacos, the pozole, gorditas, guisada verde, and molcajete and it's all authentic and super tasty. Best of all, we leave with a full belly, didn't break the bank and feel like the staff are like friends!"}, {"review_id": "doEIkps7kT_mSpsZsO8Z8Q", "user_id": "BzS5iUHr_M9fYar_iwfx4w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "One word: Molcajete. Of all the Mexican restaurants I've been to in Manchester since relocating here in November, El Rincon has the best molcajete I've had to date. Sizzling, creamy cheese, and delicious.

While I came in without many expectations, I left immensely satisfied. I had just gotten out from a concert at the SHNU arena, and went walking looking for a place to eat. After bouncing around a little bit, I finally took to the Yelp-o-sphere in search of a cheap dinner near me. This place came up near the top of the list.The location is rather small, the outside isn't very flashy, and the inside is decorated with that familiar colorful flair. There was a wait that evening, but I lucked out as it was rather short. Here we come to one thing that amazed me. The service was blindingly efficient, with not a moment gone to waste. As soon as a party left a table, it was wiped down, and the next group was invited to sit. My order was also taken quick, and brought out in less than 10 minutes. Meanwhile, the servers weren't casually walking around the restaurant, but near running. Chips and salsa were not only complementary, but delicious! I doubt the chips were homemade, but with a place of this size, I'm not complaining. They were gently warmed, which is always a nice touch. The salsa was fresh, definitely homemade, just the right amount of spicy, and not acidic. Thickness and chunkiness was on point, it stayed just fine in the chip, and had a few little chunks that it is so embarrassingly fun to fish for.For food I ordered the Pastor Taco order. These tacos were as I understand it more on the traditional side. None of those fancy toppings, just the protein, onion, and cilantro. In terms of the protein, this was among the better Al Pastor I'd had! In past experiences, it was rather saccharine. This Al Pastor however not only had a gentle, delicate sweetness, but also a tanginess. Little pieces of grilled pineapple helped add this sweetness/tanginess. Meat itself was tender, and the fact that it was small pieces helped keep the tacos from falling apart. Overall, the tacos were extremely balanced, they were overloaded, but they didn't skimp on the meat either. It's a shame this place is so far from me, I'd come here again and again. All I can say now is, should I be at the SNHU arena again, I will come here again without hesitation."}, {"review_id": "s4IgHa62JlnXMWoPpZe7CA", "user_id": "fU-oPUtA-Oq9On7_ttMFRw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I don't give usually 5:star but this place is very good!

The prices are fair and the portions are generous. I used to prefer La Carretas but this restaurant may be my new spot for Mexican.Drink: I had the Hibiscus iced tea which was $2.50. Price was good and it was delicious. It was sweet (may be too sweet for some, but I like sweet drinks) and fruity. If you are not sure if you will like it, then try asking for a sample.  Our server was very kind in providing a sample of the drink for us before having us place an order for it.Food: 1) Chips and salsa were given on the house 2) Guacomole is $4.00. A little bit on the pricier side for me but it definitely tasted good. There were chunks of avocado and it was seasoned well. 3) I love steak grandes burritos but did not see that option on the menu. Luckily, the server did not hesitate to accomadate me and gave me a steak grandes burrito and kept the price the same for $10. Definitely recommend. 4) Chicken Chimichanga for $10.00. This was their lunch special for the day. It is basically a fried burrito with chicken inside accompanied with rice and beans on the side. 5) Chicken Sopes are delicious and not bad for $8.50. They will require your fork and knife to eat but it is basically a fried tortilla layered with chicken, beans, avocado, lettuce, tomato and sour cream. I definitely recommend you try it if you have never had this before.Service: Awesome service. I haven't had good service like this in a long time. Server was kind, patient in explaining the menu, and he was willing to help you change the dishes to suit your palate. They also never let the salsa and chips run out. First time I had servers bring me a refill on salsa before I asked which is a plus. He even went above what I expected and held the door for us as we left. Also want to say good job to the kitchen staff as well because our food came out quick and was hot!Tips: After you come in to the restaurant, look to the left and you will see a sign that has the specials. They had empanadas for $2.00 as well. And try the hibiscus iced tea!"}, {"review_id": "nDbyI4fd85gdZMfP3a0New", "user_id": "nphtjuJ9uIe_kTrciSimzA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Margaritas will knock you out with a surprise punch.  Bring one person to drive you home ;).  Food was really good for NE Mexican.   I grew up in NM so a bit of a snob when it comes to this type of food.   Best in Manchester for sure"}, {"review_id": "wZ2No0VXoYkjMfZwK0nFDQ", "user_id": "QS6v8qDHBQkfgc7H4B_xUQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Really fresh and incredibly tasty food.

I grew up in Arizona and have been a devoted fan of Mexican cuisine my whole life. Living in Illinois, it can be difficult to find good Mexican food. This little gem in New Hampshire was a lovely surprise. The food was perfection. My husband ordered Fajitas Mixtas and loved it; he said the chicken was amazing and he'd order the same thing if we return. I had Gorditas with pork carnitas; the serving was generous and the flavor outstanding. They had a great homemade salsa, too. The tortilla chips could be improved upon, but the tasty salsa made up for them. The food was reasonably priced and the menu quite large, with lots to choose from.There's no signage for the building, except the restaurant's name on the door. We drove right past it thanks to wonky GPS directions. I recommend parking in front of Veteran's Memorial Park (metered parking) and walking the block to the restaurant. The entrance is around the corner, on Lake Avenue, behind the Japanese restaurant. It's small inside, but has a full bar and seating for perhaps 30 diners, with a combination of booth and chairs."}, {"review_id": "Ladk-KjVtfPzWcAgZ5I1dQ", "user_id": "pDfvRWWTo4Mu1iT9V72Cew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "If it were possible, I would give this restaurant a 10!

My husband and I are seniors and both handicapped. One of the women that work there called Uber for us. I had told her that it was my birthday. She helped us out to the car and made sure we were OK. Then, she told the driver to put it on her card. We were taken away by this.What a wonderful person she is. I don't know her name but she is a gem! I can't wait to go back so that I can thank her in person for all of her help, her compassion and her generosity. I recommend this restaurant extremely hi!ghly!
