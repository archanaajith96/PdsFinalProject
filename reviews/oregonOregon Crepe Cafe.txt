They are limited on how quickly they can make crepes, so it's not a good choice if you're in a hurry. It's located just off the park with the cool brutalist fountain, so it's a chill place to have lunch."}, {"review_id": "qKRqSiS476DX7kP15hARaA", "user_id": "2wPCBHDARqTw-8BVuNsY9w", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "The Short of It:My review is very much like the others who were not impressed. There are no major complaints on the menu options.   They have an excellent variety of choices for differing pallets and our overall flavor combinations were good. Food expectations were not met and there was a definite disconnect in seating, ordering and serving.  We wish them the best with their business and will leave it to their following of dedicated customers to patronize them as we don't have a desire to return. The Long of It: I would recommend if you are going to name a crepe an \"avocado crepe\" then avocado should be the star of the crepe.  Do you not watch Food Network?  Anyway, I had about four or five artichoke leaves, maybe six or eight small cubes of avocado, a smattering of tomato and spinach piled about an inch high or higher.  This should have been called a \"spinach crepe\".  I had an oil spot on top that I think was supposed to be the chimichurri sauce but it looked like someone tried to wipe it off as an afterthought so there was just an oil smear.  Flavor was good but the interior proportion of ingredients did not live up to the name so the expectation was not met,  Big issue with staff communication and the appearance of disorganization. There were four of us and we immediately got on the list when we walked in.  There was a very long table available for large groups and the bar along the window that were open.  Having children with us the window bar was not really an option.  Two tables left about the same time.  A small square (seats four) and a rectangular table (seats six)  There were three groups of two waiting behind us.  Instead of seating us at the rectangular table and one of the sets of two at the small square, they put us at the square suggested the window bar to the others and left the six open.  Two pairs sat at the window and two seated shortly after at a bistro table. Two single visitors also came in and sat at the window. Everyone who came in after us had their orders taken and started receiving their meals before we even had our order taken except one man...he ordered but leaving about the same time as us he had still not received his meal and had to leave without it. I believe all of this was due to miscommunication where an older gentleman took the orders from everyone along the window and so the server assumed our orders had also been taken. I am not sure, but we did receive an apology from the server and she took our order.  The kids' food came out (french toast and a nutella, banana, strawberry crepe) and then ours trickled out one at a time but the guy serving seemed confused as to where he was going with them.  We ordered two petite samplers. Another lady who came in a lot later and ordered after us received her petite sampler before we got ours.Great variety, good flavor combinations, nice staff but very disorganized."}, {"review_id": "xIWiUx5d44Q3Jsa3Lz3VNQ", "user_id": "fARZ-3kECuVtbBn4lFPJmw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "We had a great breakfast Crepes are super yummy (we had strawberry and crème) - try it out"}, {"review_id": "HcX9P90KPM6_x5qsmRJ4qg", "user_id": "_jBdfmFM5uN0l9fk7ZbACQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Nutella in crepes.

Positives:1. Good gluten free and vegan optionsI had the gluten free French toast which was good. A unique flavor. The bread was spongy but held together well, even with syrup. 2. Bacon was nice and crispyNegatives 1. The wait was long. We waited probably 20-30 minutes before we sat down. They immediately took our order but the food didn't come for a while after that. 2. Weird locationWe sat outside which was nice and breezy. (Inside was too muggy) but it's a weird area and some sketchy characters walked by.3. Didn't give us utensils 4. Didn't bring our food out at the same time. I finished my meal before my husband got his food. 5.

They could have easily got 5 stars from me. Con: unfortunately, the service was TERRIBLE. The worst service I've had possibly. The older gentleman (maybe a manager? Owner?) he was nice and accommodating.  However, one of the coffees were sent to the wrong person in our table, when asked about it our server said \"no, that's yours. It's just the wrong cup\". So he started to drink it. Then the older gentleman came up and informed us it was in fact the wrong cup, but he quickly fixed it.  The server also did not order one of our dishes, and instead of apologizing for either of those mistakes just said she had it right and wasn't sure what happened. One of the workers came up to us and asked if a plate was ours, we said no. She asked a few more times, we said no and as one of our guests began to say what he ordered, so she would know.. she rolled her eyes and walked off mid sentence. One of our guests got his food after all of us had already finished our meal and that wasn't even the plate our server forgot to order - or maybe she forgot that one too, but didn't tell us.  Overall, we would probably go here again to give it another shot. The food was great, but hopefully we wouldn't have the same server."}, {"review_id": "LYxH9E0hH1ltlRNjsOmTpA", "user_id": "r4lBS99nt52BtoOwS2sQnA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/28/2017", "text": "Came here on a Saturday, had a little wait (10 minutes or so) and were seated.

We placed our order before too long, my boyfriend got a vanilla latte half-sweetened and he said it was the best latte he's found in Salem! Our food took a while to get to us, but it was worth the wait. I got an artichoke crepe that had Swiss, dried tomatoes and spinach with pesto on top-such a great combo of flavors. We shared a bowl of salmon chowder and OH MY GOSH it was SO GOOD!!! I highly recommend it! My boyfriend got the roasted turkey sandwich on toasted sourdough, which was good but a little small.

The cafe is small, but well laid out so you don't feel crowded. Every member of the staff we met offered cheerful and pleasant service. They were also knowledgeable about their product and able to assist in catering to the food allergies at the table. Now, the food. It sounds dramatic, but I grabbed my dad's hand when I took my first bite of the vegan-batter, dark chocolate and cherry crepe because I needed some assurance I had not died. It was that good. We also had the smoked salmon chowder - creamy with chunks of fish and potato - a BLTA, which was everything a bacon, lettuce, tomato and avocado sandwich should be and a savory crepe that my dad said was delicious. In short: go. Go now."}, {"review_id": "21dZvz3Nm3zQzZyZHPygfg", "user_id": "TSwjv2fMEHMsKAqX6n-l2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2017", "text": "I love this place!
