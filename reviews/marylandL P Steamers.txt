Tons of seating and fast service. Seafood was super fresh and cooked to perfection. I had the cream of crab soup which was a great version of a chowder, but with crab. The Boat Load of Seafood is a bargain and two of them easily fed our party of six. Everything that came with it was amazing.Long story short, don't go to Baltimore without trying LP steamers. Next time I'm in town I will be making this my first stop."}, {"review_id": "IL17j_LlkTOp89DJRiwqsA", "user_id": "rJYjnT7qmHKv8W2z_K5QXQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Came here for the first time today.

Thumbs up."}, {"review_id": "Uhomb1VpdDYQEITG4322Rg", "user_id": "8krvHr5j3ilbk_AAMBQWLA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "I am not the biggest crab fan but my husband is! He gave this place a 5 star rating, but I am a bit more picky so here is why they got 3.The restaurant itself was not my cup of tea. The first floor where we sat is tiny, old and dirty! It could really use a bit of work, we sat all the way back and it was not pretty, we had servers walking by with dirty plates every 5 minutes, the place is so tiny that we were literally on their way! It's also pretty loud, I don't know if it's because of where we sat, but we could hear staffs conversations and directions from one another. Now onto the food:My husband had the crabs, which he loved, he even got a \"class\" on how to properly \"open\" them. I decided to get the fish and chips and was underwhelmed. The fish was not good, it was lacking flavor, and there was nothing special about it! I obviously understand that people come here for the crabs, but overall the place just didn't do it for me!"}, {"review_id": "GRSXkB-EGPnEMAITa0VwCA", "user_id": "VKsec-NW7nZpIFzmBSEchA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Food was okay.

Great prices for weighed, steamed seafood - also fried entrees as well! I ordered half a pound of steamed shrimp, 1 medium crab, and a bowl of Maryland Crab Soup for about $21. Excellent and the soup is to die for! Will definitely return! 4 stars bc we were seated right by the door - so imagine a cold breeze every time someone or 12... came in to get a table or inquire about wait time. Not cool at all and annoying as hell - with ppl looking right at your food.  Go away.... They need to incorporate a walk up window for wait time and questions bc the entrance is literally one long row of tables to the left of the wall.

The seafood is FRESH and it's filled with locals so you can bet it's good. We got some medium crabs to share along with the famous fries, oysters on the half shell, hush puppies, and a steamer tray. Everything was amazing!! I especially loved the steamed seafood- the flavor was on point and just very natural. I don't think you need much to make fresh seafood taste good and LP definitely lets their product shine naturally. My toddler thoroughly enjoyed her popcorn shrimp basket and I had a nibble, too- delish!Love this place but parking can definitely be a pain from what I saw.

This was my second visit. Both times, I came here to show out-of-towners how to pick crabs. We came here on a Tuesday night from like 6:30-8 and it was pretty busy the whole time we were there, but not too loud. For appetizers, we ordered the crap dip and the hush puppies. The crap dip was nothing out of the ordinary. However, the hush puppies are some of my favorite hush puppies: crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, with some whole corn kernels. We got a dozen medium crabs to split. We had 4 people this time, but I also split a dozen with just me and another person before, so it depends how hungry your party is. Obviously, it is not crab season, but they still all tasted decent and were fresh. Their beer selection on tap is very basic (Natty Boh,  Yuengling, Sam Adams), but they have a good number of bottles too. We had great service throughout the night. Overall, I will continue to come here with friends who want to crack crabs."}, {"review_id": "Pheja2zmefuDDo_jOivZzg", "user_id": "w2FbNarEtg1p2YfRIZ06KA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "This place is Great!

The hush puppies come with a delicious maple/cinnamon/something butter that makes for a nice sweet and savory combo. I've also had the lobster tail here - I'd recommend sticking to crabs and starters though. But enjoy it all with a nice glass of beer and you're good to go!The staff is always super friendly, and they have an electronic waitlist so they can text you when you're table is ready during busy times.

The crab cakes were tasty- however, they weren't as flavorful as I would have liked.  On the plus side, there was not a lot of filler, so we got more crab per bite! The crab chowder was the star of the meal for me- the thick, creamy broth, filled hearty chucks of crab meat, was so soothing and comforting.  It was fluffy blanket for my tummy! Yum!
