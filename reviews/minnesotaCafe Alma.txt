Anyway, should you order the wine pairings, keep an eye on the by-the-glass menu. The pairings are short pours rather than full glasses. My three short pours would have been $30 for full glasses, but they charged me $35 for the pairing. They don't show you the bottle, pour tableside, or even tell you the producer, so even if they poured wines that achieved the implied value of the pairings, they're doing it wrong.They made up for it when we talked to them; but honestly, between a chili crepe that didn't taste like chilis (and had surprise onions all over) and noticeably lackluster service, by that time I was over the whole meal."}, {"review_id": "_hmZ4oetxEYc6JImQNnzUQ", "user_id": "HeGfVQkV0zFQ-4f14poz6A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "I planned to go to Alma Cafe for a long time.

I've had it in my bookmarks for quite some time and finally pulled the trigger on it. Not going to say it was bad, but it was not that great.The place is pretty cool, warranting an \"oh wow\" as soon as I walked in. They got a pretty cool atmosphere and setting. Good first impression. Started on a high note with the house-made Ricotta cheese and bread, which was delicious. The cauliflower, on the other hand, was lackluster; minimum amounts of flavor and just meh. The beet salad was also ok but nothing to write home about. On to the main plates. The pork chop was decent, well prepared and with a good presentation but its not something I would order again. The lamb burger was again, ok but would not come back for it. The lack of options on the menu was also disappointing. I'm curious to try their full-blown 3 course meal but after our experience I'm feeling doubtful and with so many good options around I'm not sure I'll make it back any time soon. Funny because all 3 of my friends that I met here were surprised I picked this place for dinner because they'd been here before and all agreed that for the money it's not worth it. Two of them even ate before to save themselves the unnecessary cost and just swung by just for drinks lol...."}, {"review_id": "twsqRCjYLbK0lxLGc3zuWg", "user_id": "Ibm0F3tRC7bCHYrmYMY84g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/12/2017", "text": "I love this beautiful place. I have here three times now for lunch and dinner. Food is good but it is a little expensive. Their Spicy Turkey Burger is very tasty. I would suggest to get vegetables instead of chips. Chips are little greasy but ok just need a dipping sauce. I do love their Warm Hummus and Homemade Pita. I love their cocktails. Sitting at the bar is fun and lively. Spritz Life is good. I had their cappuccino with oat milk, it was good too. I was disappointed that they did not make nice decoration on my drink. Lol. Otherwise it was all good. Great service.

There was a good crowd but we were able to snag four seats along the bar. I started with the Daily Punch - a concoction of bourbon, ginger beer, cider, rum, blackstrap bitters, and vermouth. Despite the super boozy description, it was extremely well balanced and a good sipping accompaniment to my meal. I had a really hard time deciding what to get, but my travel bud and I both had our eye on the same two dishes so we went halvzies. On the sweet side was the french toast special, and for savory we chose the spicy turkey burger with an upgrade to the crispy smashed potatoes our friend raved about. I started with the french toast which was one gigantic slice of bread sliced in half, topped with candied pecans, strawberries, creme anglaise, and served with real maple syrup. The mix of soft bread and candied pecans was perfect, and half was the perfect portion with how rich it was. The turkey burger was spicy as promised; I'm glad they didn't shy away to please more tender palates. It's also probably the best turkey burger I've ever had. Turkey burgers, at least in my experience, often end up being dry and chewy. This was juicy but cooked through and with a texture you'd expect from a non-poultry burger. The star of the show was our upgraded potatoes. Super crispy exterior with a creamy interior and seasoned perfectly. I had originally considered going the route of a lemon currant scone and crispy potatoes, and I think I'll definitely go that way with a return visit. Aside from the food, we had the best bartender/server. He was friendly, funny, answered all our questions about different drinks we saw being made, and even went the extra step of mixing us a mini cocktail to sample and giving us all micro carrots after I exclaimed \"those are so cute\" when I noticed one as garnish. Extra points for his vintage (and I hope unironic) Mickey Mouse watch.Glad this is in my best friend's new neighborhood!"}, {"review_id": "RgflzNx2hvTLZ3oUqGYsjQ", "user_id": "HUw0S-dz6oCTZiE790-7HQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/27/2017", "text": "When you ask a local where to go to eat, 4 out of 5 people will mention Café Alma.  It is a restaurant with two personalities:   the informal Café and the formal Restaurant side.  At first, I was disappointed we didn't reserve seats in the restaurant but after the Café experience, I recommend it whole heartedly.   The restaurant side has a prix fixe menu.  The food critic Jack DeRusha suggested Alma was deserving of a Michelin star.  I disagree.  One Michelin star means, \"it's worth a stop\" but myself and my dinner party all think it's deserving of 2 stars...  \"worth a detour\"     I had hot, jasmine tea with tomato basil soup for my starter with rigatoni as my main dish.

I had the Octopus Tarine and King Crab Rice Grits for starters, Duck breast & confit for entree and the cream puff as dessert. Very single dish is right on point, you can taste out the high quality of the food itself, the great cooking skills of the kitchen. Did my research of Chief Chef Alex here, he's been running Alma for more then 18 years and keep everything in elegancy & consistency. He also won the title of Best Chef of Mid-West Region by James Beard Foundation in 2010. No wonder Alma is No.1 or at least the top choices fine dinning spot in MPLS.

Just far enough. Is it a hotel, a restaurant or a cafe? Well.........I'm not quite sure, but what I do know is that when you walk into the vestibule and ask where to get a burger (only on thursdays), the hosts will direct you to the cafe. We walked right in and sat at the bar. Super comfy stools with a low back. The copper topped bar looks cool and felt great to lean on. The entire cafe had contemporary industrial look and feel. Exposed ducts and sprinklers. It's a large room with some tables, booths and a big center bar. The bartender immediately set out glasses and asked it we want our water sparkling or still? They have a great selection of cocktails. Last time I was here I had a few including an old fashioned and a Manhattan. Tonight my wife got the bartenders Signiture special which was a blueberry, ginger, oolong tea infused rum mixed with bitters, lemon and watermelon juice. It was girly but super good. The wife LOVED it. They have a cool little rotating selection of local taps and cans/bottles. I grabbed a dreamyard and combed the apps. We've had the crispy smashed potatoes that are served with a black truffle aioli. They were excellently crunchy, crispy and salty with a fluffy center. Small bite sized chunks of pure potato glory. The burger is served with these little nuggets so we decided on the hummus for an app. It's made in house and served warm with house made pita. The hummus was smooth, bright and full of citrus and mint. Super good and not to heavy. Now, I've had the hominy brisket and a few other main dishes that were all amazing, but it was Thursday and I came here for the burger. The burger is not on the menu so I can't tell you exactly what it's composed of, but I know it was not a 'large' burger (think saint dinette size). There were two thin patties, that bursted with flavor that ground chuck alone could not produce. Both patties were smothered in cheesy sauce stuff that was like a Gouda and american combo. It was delicious. Then there were the house made spicy bread-n-butter mini pickles. OMG. They completed the burger. No ketchup, no mustard. Just all this fantastic melty, crunchy, salty, sweet and (just a lil) spicy combo of flavors and textures put in between a wonderful brioche bun. I'm not sure where this burger sits with local burger peeps, but it's a top 5 any day of the week and the #1 burger in the cities only served on Thursday's.Service was excellent, ambiance was dark and cozy- again, excellent and the food has never disappointed. Cafe Alma has continued to exceed my expectations every visit.
