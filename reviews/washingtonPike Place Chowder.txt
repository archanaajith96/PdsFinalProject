Nice and thick the ingredients were well proportioned. Not overly salted or overly creamy as some places do which does not make for a good chowder. Pike Place nails it on the traditional chowders as well the the-more creative ones. You may find long lines but don't let the deter you. The lines move quickly and they are really nice just don't expect to become chums with the staff they are busy keeping that line moving."}, {"review_id": "ZQb9VCDOOCocHdWVxpI68g", "user_id": "NRYJBguIFH3EtWeAdarkrw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Yes, DEFINITELY come here. Some other places in Seattle have a lot of reviews, but are very bland. However, this place 110% meets its expectations. FOOD: Simply amazing. I LOVE clam chowder. It was super cold when my friends and I came here so it was perfect. We ordered the sampler, since we knew we would be eating a lot for the rest of the day. The New England Clam Chowder was the best, hands down. It was extremely rich. I couldn't get enough of it. If I had known, I would've replaced 90% of my meals in Seattle to get more of this clam chowder. My second favorite was the Crab and Oyster Chowder. The crab and the oyster tasted very fresh, and again it was also very rich. The Seared Scallop Chowder was on the sweeter side. It didn't taste like a normal \"chowder\" which was a nice change of flavor from the others. My least favorite was the Seafood Bisque. It wasn't like chowder really and the flavor was a bit off. I only had a few spoonfuls of the Seafood Bisque since I didn't enjoy it at all. WAIT: The line looked so long. We kept walking to the end of the line and it seemed like there would be no end to it, but once we got in line we waited maybe 20 mins max.SERVICE: The worker in front of the line who was letting everyone in was really nice. He made a few jokes here and there. Once you get past him, you get your clam chowder almost immediately."}, {"review_id": "Ej0UQPcrN5D0WKWkZ6yWCw", "user_id": "n1sABuj3mGrbPYUWgnUmdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This was my first stop on my trip! I've heard endless compliments on how delicious the clam chowder is and wanted to try their chowder flights. Regardless of the time, there is always a line that wraps around the restaurant. My friend and I arrived around 11:30am on a Saturday and waited about 20 minutes. We decided on the chowder flight and a lobster roll. Order first then find seating. Since the line goes fast, this was more of a 'eat quickly then leave' type of place. They weren't kidding when they say it's the world best clam chowder. Way better than the ones I had in San Francisco or Monterey. I wish I could take some home with me instead of ordering online! chowder flight (New England Clam, Seafood Bisque, Smoked Salmon, Crab and Oyster Chowder): I was a bit disappointed in the size of the flight. You get a decent size of sourdough bread and oyster crackers. Absolutely loved the New England Chowder! Everyone says it's the best, and I can definitely see why. Perfect warm and creamy texture that leaves you all happy and tingly inside. This was hands down our favorite. The others weren't bad. Our rating in order from most favorite to least: new england clam, crab and oyster, smoked salmon, and seafood bisque. TIP: check in on Yelp for $1 off the flights! maine lobster roll: overpriced for a small roll and not worth the $23 we paid for. I wasn't overly impressed, and it tasted bland to me. They were generous in terms of the amount of lobster you get but just stick with the clam chowder instead."}, {"review_id": "84DrKJbBRt7MgxPvgTZJFQ", "user_id": "oFttcOJHPivyNVddVwRDjw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Kind of a hidden area but it's in an alley! There is a line for the clam chowder but no worries - it moves pretty fast. After about 10 minutes, we got to the front which is all pretty worth it. I got the original clam chowder and it was so yummy. It was the right amount of creamy with vegetables, clams, and whatever else was in there. Mmmmm! It also fills you up on really cold days so be sure to get some! To my knowledge, you can order 24 hours ahead and skip the line too!My only complaint is that the sourdough bread was not my favorite. Even dipped with the soup, it didn't taste appetizing to me. I'm not sure if the bread bowl is made out of sour dough but I would definitely say to just go ahead and skip it since the cup does just fine!"}, {"review_id": "ArXShm_TS2gy3heerboq-g", "user_id": "SsgDGJWBNvefjY0z8XsVCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "There was a long line for Sunday lunch.

And the line turned out to move along quickly after all.Once you get to the front of the food stall in this market, there is a cafeteria style display behind a glass window with multiple tubs of different kinds of chowder. Choose your bowl size, choose your chowder flavor and then pay. Grab your crackers, napkins and plastic utensils on a table nearby (as well as extra pieces of bread) and you're free to find a seat and table in any of the public seating available outside the building.They serve many different kinds of chowder: You can't go wrong with the CLASSIC CLAM CHOWDER. It was full of clams and it was creamy and not watery. It was very good. Just to make more space for the chowder, I highly suggest skipping the bread bowl altogether... and they give you a piece of it anyway!The OYSTER AND CRAB CHOWDER had noticeable chunks of oysters and crab and was also appropriately thick and yummy."}, {"review_id": "u8s0Zzh9Rq9bJzZUxVznNg", "user_id": "D5yJMAEvkAt74s0r6A_lWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "OKAY!!!

Warning the line gets pretty long like a blockbuster movie.  We waited aprx 15 minutes on a Tuesday around 1:30 that's long considering this place only serves chowder and a few rolls like Dungeness crabs, Oregon bay roll, Maine lobster roll all perfectly balanced with seasonings etc.  oh soooo good!!! Seating maybe be difficult to get but the turn around is pretty quick.  No reserve seating either!

For that day, which was a Saturday...was lobsters, crab and sweet corn. So yummy!!! It wasn't thick but chunky enough to chew on lobster and crab. Every chowder come w free slice of bread and where the utensils are you can also get free clam crackers as well. This is a must stop when you're in town.

As a clam chowder lover I picked he New England because I wanted to try the best of what I already knew, and it was absolutely delicious. Chunks of potatoes and clams so fresh they probably plucked them from the ocean that morning. My husband, feeling adventurous, tried the market chowder (a chef's whim, basically) and his blew mine out of the water (haha puns). So creamy and delicious with plenty of lobster and crab. If you think you might be down to try something new, I would. This place can't fail!Based on our experience yesterday we will definitely be back today, and we will probably have to try one of everything!

The Crab roll was tiny and I finished it in just a few bites. While small it packed great flavor, was very fresh, and felt light. The bread is well toasted and buttered, and they gave more crab meat than I was expecting. The New England chowder was amazingggggg. They win awards for it for a reason! It was creamy, filled with great chunks of veggies and seafood, but never felt too heavy. It only got 8 oz, but wished I got a whole bread bowl.

There seems to always be a line at this place but it moves by fairly quickly. Once your ge to the front, you choose our chowders and the scoop it from the cauldrons in front of you and you pay. We opted for the New England chowder in a bread bowl ($11.95) and a medium seafood bisque ($7.95). Loved both of the chowders, the new england had a sweet taste to the broth and it was loaded with clams, and the seafood bisque had a strong tomato flavor to it. I personally don't think getting the bread bowl next time would be worth it for the price since the amount of soup you get is about equal to a medium. They give you a side of free bread anyways and there's unlimited extra bread and oyster crackers for grabs on the shelf.

So rich, creamy, and hearty. Definitely something that will warm your soul on a cold day. I used to think San Francisco had the best but nope.... Seattle wins this one! - Smoked salmon chowder (3/5): Very very fishy. I wasn't a fan of this one mainly because cream cheese was in the base and I couldn't overcome the fishiness of the salmon.- Crab & oyster chowder (5/5): Another one of my favorites! You can really taste the oyster. If you love oyster, this one is the way to go! Amaaaaaazing.- Seafood bisque (6/5): YAAAS. This chowder is a tomato base and hits so close to being a pan roast. If you've ever had great pan roast.. you know this will be delicious.Service was quick and not much interaction goes on other than ordering your food.
