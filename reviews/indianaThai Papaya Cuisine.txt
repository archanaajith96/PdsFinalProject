I was worried when we moved here that real Thai wouldn't be available in such a small city, but this place is amazing! And the owner and staff are kind and always helpful! Tom ka gai, phad woon sen, phad see ew, chicken satay, spring rolls, and of course phad Thai are all awesome. They can work with many dietary restrictions too! Much love for this great restaurant"}, {"review_id": "1ysp8PYeqZwVNb4K7Ypdkg", "user_id": "oxNMIUED0MQ6M23IR9IuvQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "Was in the mood for some Thai food so my friend and I stopped in here for the first time on a Saturday afternoon.I went with a Spicy Pork Fried Rice and a Thai Tea. Tea was amazing but a bit expensive. The portion of the rice was really nice and more then I expected. Tastes fantastic. Word of warning though: I love spicy food but getting this as spicy as you can is a bit much.The food was great but the service was inexcusable. We were the only other table in the restaurant and we did not see a server the entire time outside of putting our order in. Could not get a drink refill for the entire meal. I'll be getting take out if I go again.Bill came out to $19 before tip."}, {"review_id": "-sndcsf0-zis9ZMtNIHCwQ", "user_id": "t50G0iH7sju_l4CkUNSJBQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Less just say I wasn't impressed with the food. The restaurant and the staff was nice but the food wasn't. To be fair.. my wife and I have been to a lot of Thai/ Asian restaurants. With that said.. we ordered the tiger tear (crying tiger) level 10 spicy. That was like a 2. It was over cooked, sweet, and had too much sauce. We also had red curry. It has too much coconut milk and again it was not spicy at all. The rice was under cooked. We spent $60 for that. Too expensive!! Any where else it would've been like $30. It was a nice try but we won't be going there again"}, {"review_id": "LpGmdAUvq-o-CVQNmK9LcA", "user_id": "iZkaWZ68iJ3gFtoLTgsR2A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/27/2017", "text": "Came in for dinner on a Sunday evening. It was pretty quiet for dinner time but not empty. Lots of items looked good on the menu, but I went with the Pineapple Fried Rice w/ tofu rather than chicken. The server gladly made the change for me. Very generous portion size, you could easily share it with someone (I took half of it home). The meal was good enough but I was by no means impressed. The rice itself had a nice taste but overall the meal was dry. Average food at best. Definitely overpriced if you ask me!"}, {"review_id": "z4WiT2_9gEIfsAe8ZOhy2g", "user_id": "Oczs8WWm45yVWdn6M32h6w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "I ordered some green curry from here with a spicy level of 6 to go. Ordering was easy and pick up was even easier. The staff was very friendly. The curry was wonderful with a variety of vegetables and just the right level of spicy. I prefer a little bit of heat, towards the end of eating I had a drip of sweat on my forehead, so 6 was right for me (judge my spice tolerance however you like). The price was a little higher than what I would like to pay ($14), but overall the meal was good, and I would order curry from here again.

We went on a Saturday about lunchtime. Firstly 3.25 for a glass of sweet tea id a little high and if I'm paying that much my glass shouldn't set empty for over 15 minutes waiting for you to refill it. Especially when the place was mostly empty with only 3 table occupied there is no excuse for poor service. The food I had from the lunch menu (Pad Thai) was bland and pretty lacking in flavor and meat, the only think that was good was the spring roll which was about half the size of most of the spring rolls I've seen elsewhere. I honestly felt like I paid 15 per person for a plate of noodles that were lightly coated on sauce with a few bits of meat and cabbage tossed in. In the end we left feeling as if we got ripped off as I don't mind paying good money for a good meal but honestly this did not live up to the expect ion I had based on the other reviews.  Not impressed as others have been at all and I can not reccommend it, we will not be back."}, {"review_id": "B2YaVGf3QycEH_GSAzEodw", "user_id": "bTz0OsKesCXTtSNFSmkvWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2017", "text": "Hands down, the absolute best Thai in all of Evansville!
