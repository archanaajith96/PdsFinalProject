The ambience is fun and warm and super welcoming. Made reservations by phone and it was packed on a Tuesday night!Decided to try the ginger grapefruit drink, but it was too ginger-y for me. So my friend shared her ginger mint tea which was really refreshing!We all ordered our own guac, and I love how it comes with unsalted whole tortilla chips. So genius to not serve with typical triangle chips but thin ones that you can just break apart.We also ordered our own grilled corn which was cut off the cob. So tasty! Ordered 4 tacos on bibb lettuce: chorizo, pork belly, duck, and baja fish. They brought my chorizo on a tortilla, and when they brought it back out on lettuce, it was smothered with cilantro which I asked for none. They got it right on the third try, which is minus the one star as they seemed annoyed that I kept taking it back. The duck taco was my absolute favorite! So tender and delicious!Make sure to end with the churros with chocolate sauce! Perfect cap to the meal!Overall, a great place for amazing reasonable prices!"}, {"review_id": "RA0UKFCIiBAk4QknHnPj7Q", "user_id": "miQzjfgp-y9cxbGUnRzj6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Been multiple times and they are always on point.  They have an amazing crew of happy hipsters that are trained with care.  The staff still bring their refreshing personalities to the table (literally).  The mix of quality and entertaining service is very hard to cultivate but BT has done it. BRAVO!!!I've yet to order an item I didn't enjoy. Tacos, bowls, share plates, and drinks are all fantastic.  DO NOT pass on the plaintains and street corn, I go off the cob (a request they honor).  If you are looking for \"Americanized tacos\" you can \"run for the border\".  If you want some real authentic tacos, great service, drinks and atmosphere, this is the spot.Cheers!!!"}, {"review_id": "srMZx4pdHD-wy7jKtm-8Aw", "user_id": "E96vQnptExiA7iEDCyuH3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "The tacos are on the smaller side fyi - so far my favorites are the baja fish, pork belly and sesame ribeye tacos, and guac & chips, grilled corn, and spicy cucumber salad on the side. The baja fish taco is perfectly golden and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I really like the fried cod fish with chipotle slaw, they go so well together! The pork belly and sesame ribeye are very flavorful and always on point. I wasn't too impressed with the falafel taco, tuna tatako taco, and tuna poke as I found them lacking in flavor. Especially the tuna poke was nothing special and was also missing a lot of ingredients to be considered a poke bowl. Still my favorite taco spot in Tampa and I highly recommend :)"}, {"review_id": "R8HuvMt8-3wSjkyrmXqarg", "user_id": "mGiUnXUc9iX_WAha4I5QNQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Strolling in Hyde Park and craving some tacos? Head over to Bartaco!For the area, the prices of the tacos are standard at $2.50 for regular tacos and $3.50 for speciality ones. Our waitress told us up front that the tacos were two-biters and it would be filling to get 3-5 and an appetizer or side. Therefore, we ordered the chips and quac ($7.75), which was delicious, but the size was underwhelming. As for tacos, I ordered the ribeye, duck, and carnitas; I'd definitely recommend the duck! My boyfriend ordered the ribeye, pork belly, and portabello and enjoyed the pork belly the most. Although, he did say that the portion of​ that one was not worth the $3.50 and I'd have to agree.The branding within the restaurant was pleasing to the eye with the same shade of navy decorated throughout. The ambience is casual and was perfect for a quick sit down after walking about Hyde Park."}, {"review_id": "lGXYC3eceF5GtqPK-GgR0Q", "user_id": "XCotpO_HfYwlYsY6L_d8lA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Perfectly pleasant brunch at Bartaco.

Their front of house staff was a little off-putting--making my friends and I walk to the side door outside--rather than through the restaurant (presumably because we were in workout clothes). So starting off that way made the meal a little less enjoyable. Our sever however was very good and professional. We had three tacos each. I had pork belly, rock shrimp and the red fish. They were all ok. The red fish was dry and the tacos seemed to be overly salty. I was thrilled that they made chicha in house so I had to try it, being that I've been to Peru and had their homemade beverages. It was pretty good, but nothing like the real thing. We ended the night with Churros. I'd have to say they were better than I expected, but a little undercooked and doughy/cold in the middle. Overall it was ok."}, {"review_id": "l32IHTuYJb7bDTqjq4HfFg", "user_id": "5nLsZ3ouFAlysZ8QICEaTA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "I love the ceviche and chips and guacamole here.

But the experience may be a little different if you don't really write your order down properly. They ask you to write your order in a menu; but really they likely would be better off with the server just taking the order. At least that was my experience. The appetizer guacamole comes large and small...if you are sharing ask for the large. The pricing isn't bad and the ambiance is actually really great. It's not the that the place was bad, but I think the experience could be better. Maybe an adjustment to the service style could help, at least in my opinion. We had 12 tacos and a couple of sides plus a few drinks, totaled ~$90 plus tip."}, {"review_id": "IqwOlaUXSddsulknLn4jzw", "user_id": "aEqgu3lpsfVKlYfuD8NpEg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Why the three stars you ask?  Lets dive into the review to get this question answered.  Went here on a Tuesday night, so it being taco Tuesday it was pretty packed.  I had to wait for my party to arrive so I went and sat at the bar and had a beer.  The bartender was very friendly and helpful.  She got me my beer quickly and checked on me at reasonable times.  When my party arrived we moved to a table.  Here our waiter explained the order process.  We ordered the triple nacho appetizer.  It consisted of two different sauces a red and a green.  It also included a very small plate of guac.  The chips for this is one circle chip that you break off into smaller chips.  These were very tasty as the sauces were.  Problem I had was the super small cup of guac that was given.   We got somewhat confused with the ordering process since he did not mention that we should fill out the one card for the whole table.   So we mistakenly filled out 5 different cards.  When our order arrived they had missed 3 tacos we ordered.   We did get an extra taco that we had not ordered and the waiter told us we could keep it.  We then eventually got the tacos that had been missed.   I had the baja fish taco which was delicious.  Also had the falafel taco which had a little bit of spice, but was very tasty.  I ordered the pork belly based on all other reviews but was left wanting more taste.  My final taco was the chorizo which was really good.  For desert I had coconut and chocolate gelato which were very tasty.  The waiter did give us a little bit more of a portion on the gelatos for the taco mishap.  Atmosphere was very loud that night which is understandable.  Parking is a problem in this area for all restaurants but the plus is that all parking structures are free.  I will not be coming back to bartaco.  I think its more of a trendy place than the actual experience for food."}, {"review_id": "S2wLw5-axs1vZN89XdJ6NQ", "user_id": "tUOD2bXFLaiYP5_KeKJNOA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "This was a quick in and out visit for me, and normally I would not write a review as I had only a margarita and no food. However, it was an amazing drink and certainly deserved a 5-star review.I was in the area picking up something and had a few minutes, so thought I would venture in for a quick drink. The bartender immediately approached me and asked if I had ever been. When I replied no, he told me how orders worked and recommended a margarita, which I was all too happy to order.Their margaritas are amazing. Very fresh, all freshly made with hand-squeezed juice and may have very well been the best I had ever had.... this was just the standard, house margarita. I would say a bit on the pricey side, about $9 in a small glass, but this is surely a quality drink!They have a lot of taco options on the menu, all Ala Carte, in the $3-4 range; which look great; will have to come back for dinner sometime soon.

She would just answer quickly and then stare at me waiting for me to fill out the order card.  We ended up with two tacos each and shared the guacamole (which was barely enough for one person).The food tasted good (not great).  We could tell the ingredients were somewhat fresh, but the execution was about 70% there.  I felt like my food was just missing that little something extra to make it great.
