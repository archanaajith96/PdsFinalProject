Of course you can't expect every restaurant to have vegan options, but they have a big sign when you walk in that says \"Vegan Options.\"The black bean burger is made with egg. The only two other options are a portobello burger and a salad, but both are modified so they're not the real entree. You have to request that they don't put cheese or pesto or dressing on it. I went with the portobello burger and it was basically inedible.The mushroom was absolutely flavorless, not to mention rubbery. I got halfway through the burger and couldn't finish it. Very disappointing from a restaurant that claims to serve vegan food."}, {"review_id": "pcflrirt9SbIgVHWncwzHA", "user_id": "NtqYrwGtG_ARngmeR915qw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "I have a hard time with Cubby's. Here's the quick and dirty review: fine food at an expensive price. Keep reading if you wish for me to break it down further, because I'm going to anyway. Fine food--The Cockadoodledoo sandwich and Tri Tip Steak Salad are alway my go to's. Everything has a yummy flavor, but the steak is usually super chewy and hard to bite into. Sweet potato fries or regular rosemary, every time I have them, they taste old and cold. I ask for the buffalo and ranch on the side so I can dip and they won't get soggy. A Hunckalala Shake (huckleberry and chocolate chips) is the occasional treat I'll get if someone is willing to help me slurp it up. It's all fine, like I said, but nothing to really rave about. Expensive--The aforementioned steak salad is $10. HOLY CRAP. And I can inhale that in a matter of seconds. Basically it's a place I go to when I feel like I can splurge and treat myself. A salad, sweet potato fries, and a shake all came out to be $18 (not including tip). That's a solid chunk taken out of my pocket, and I have a hard time finding it worth it. The sauces are good, ambience is super casual and fun, and there is usually enough parking at this location even though it shares a parking lot with other businesses and is located right in the heart of Provo. TIPS & TRICKS: * Find someone to take you on a date here, rather than buying it yourself ;) * Grab an extra water cup if you don't drink soda, because their soda fountain is a far ways away from your seat. And let me tell ya, there is nothing worse than having to get up in the middle of your meal to refill your drink.* BRING A SWEATER. It's always sooooo cold!"}, {"review_id": "zOkugQwgzRGu-C8vHI54DQ", "user_id": "y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Here's the bottom line...Cubby's is pretty good.  Cubby's is a chain found throughout Utah. Their menu consists of sandwiches, burgers, salads, some desserts, and sides. I got the Dragonslayer Burger, which is their top sirloin patty mixed with bleu cheese crumbles and topped with smoked bacon, onions, pickles, greens, and their creamy buffalo sauce.  Price is $7.99 for a single patty or $9.99 for a double.  This burger doesn't come with sides.  I recommend getting the double since the burger is small. The burger may be small, but it's thick, juicy, and packed with flavor.  Overall, the restaurant is clean, the service was good, and the burger was very tasty."}, {"review_id": "NNJeUlE7UHDBtRUnLrDoRQ", "user_id": "Jo9r1XO46MDW9PKSNAIgCw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "I'm a huge fan of cubby's but they recently messed up my catering order horribly.

No plastic utensils, no napkins, nothing. I go back and get those, and feel that they are bugged by my presence. I was kind the whole time but felt that my needs as a customer we're not met.

Cubbys \"Chicago Beef\" is great. Nothing more to be talked about. That being said, let me explain my rating. I don't think it deserves 5/5, but it's still a damn good, and solid place to eat. My regulars are: Tri Tip Steak Salad, Rosemary Fries. Such great taste, and he fries are to die for. SOMETIMES the fries can be a bit salty, but what's new.That being said, 4/5 rating. Back to that, it's a good place but it doesn't blow me off my feet. It's another one of those great tasting places, with a quick \"provo\" turnaround.

And I don't even love mushrooms. Great flavor with good sauce. And I still love those Buffalo fries..... . I've heard so many rave reviews about Cubby's. But I'm not really convinced that it's that much better than many other places around. I've tried it twice, one to go and one staying there. Don't get the fries to go. They just die. But I tried the Buffalo fries when I was able to stay and that was hands down my favorite things. I would just get that for a meal and be happy. My friends really like the tri-tip sandwich but I haven't tried that one. I tried the dragon slayer burger and was really just underwhelmed. Really average. The salads are quite good though. Also, if they could fix the flickering lights, that would be fantastic. At first I just thought it was a bad bulb. But then I realized that most of their light bulbs do that. Started causing a serious headache. Otherwise it's a decent space and was nice to catch up with friends for lunch"}, {"review_id": "fZyER4djqUo7a1rq8RS4QQ", "user_id": "EzCWIXl2SttlhvnSJaG4Mg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/15/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I wrote my first review of Cubby's four years ago when it was a bit newer to the Utah scene and Provo was its only location. It has since expanded, as has my appreciation for it, and I felt like an update was due.This place deserves its lines and accolades. The food is hot, fresh, and fantastic, and of a unique style that isn't really found elsewhere. I can't say enough for the tri-tip sandwich (get it cali style with cheddar and avocado) and recently also tried the Che burger--sirloin with fried egg and manchego cheese and bacon and other goodness. We usually binge on a side of buffalo bleu cheese fries, and have heard (for the more healthily inclined) that the salads are top notch.

Cubbies is a staple that keeps on giving! The quality and flavor of the menu items is genuinely amazing! (Spoiler: you gotta try the whole menu!)I've been coming here since it opened and to be honest my first few visits did not make much of an impact on me. I started with the beef (it's in the name and when I try new places I usually go with the house specialty). It was good, but I was certainly not wowed. Well let me tell you when I expanded to the chicken, salads and burgers my eyes were opened and I've been in love ever since! Don't get me wrong, the Tri tip and Mr. beef are good, but it's not where my heart is. For example, I tried the portobello sandwich a week ago and I was blown away! The taste was outstanding! I would go vegetarian for that sandwich! (or just enjoy it as I am)Recommendations: Cockadoodledoo chicken sandwich, Houdini Burger, Portobello sandwich and rosemary fries. And their sweet BBQ sauce, dip everything in it! (I could drink it)I love the environment, the wood & steel furnishing and the cheerful and helpful staff! I recommend them as well!

Cubbys has become a favorite of mine because they make awesome quality food. I'm happy to see them popping up all over the place, but I hope that because they are expanding it doesn't mean they start taking shortcuts.My favorite sandwich is the Tri-Tip Steak sandwich with the Spicy BBQ sauce. They seriously nailed it out of the park with this one. The bread holds together well and has a nice chew to it, the steak is tender, juicy and flavorful. The BBQ sauce is full flavored with a touch of spice to let you remember you ordered the Spicy BBQ but not too overwhelming.  They also serve delicious buffalo fries that are lathered in buffalo sauce and creamy blue cheese. They are ridiculously good. Their rosemary fries are also delicious but I wouldn't recommend ordering other because the portion sizes are huge! Also get a chocolate whoopie cookie. I usually will but one for me and one for my wife; but I actually usually buy two for me and greedily eat one inside before going out with the rest of my food. They are seriously good.Keep it up Cubby's and remember expansion is great but stay small minded, don't change a great thing :)"}, {"review_id": "5k5HdT4B_Pm_RMOhHJF1ng", "user_id": "06KcDeYqraygxE-D1U8lfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Another place I love to bring people when they come into town.

Goodness.  My family ordered the sweet potato fries, rosemary fries, and the buffalo and bleu cheese fries. The buffalo and bleu cheese fries were, hands down, some of the best fries I've ever had in Provo. I'm passionate about bleu cheese, so it was cool to see how they made both a buffalo sauce and a bleu cheese sauce and combined those to top the fries. The buffalo sauce cut the tangy flavor of the bleu cheese, so they were perfectly paired.
