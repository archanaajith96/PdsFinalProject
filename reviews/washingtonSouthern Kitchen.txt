Southern Kitchen's got what you need. Their chicken is fantastic, all of their sides are great (My top 2 are the greens and the hush puppies), and the staff is always great. And holy hell - get the lemonade! Definitely not the place to go if you're looking for a quick bite - it can sometimes take a little while to get your food. But the spot is nice, always smells amazing, and once the food comes it'll definitely be a highlight of your day. If you haven't already, you should definitely pay Southern Kitchen a visit. Stop in, grab a bite, and enjoy yourself!"}, {"review_id": "Wj29-0ef1qQmRELRAw6b5w", "user_id": "MRpvSI8Pt8XMdgYoaaYv6Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "The food is good most of the time.

Our server Ben, was great.  What has happened to this restaurant?  It used to be good.  The last two times we've been there have been really disappointing experiences.  When did they stop using seasonings?  The red beans, rice fried chicken were so bland. The chicken was greasy. My son had the brisket.  He said it was OK.  But, that BBQ sauce is not homemade. It's from a bottle.  Mashed potatoes were from a box.  My son ordered the peach cobbler for dessert.  What a gloopy over sweetened mess that was.  I'm not sure what it was, but it wasn't peach cobbler.  Plus, dang it's gotten expensive.  $5 for a mason jar full of lemonade?  No refills?  For that you should be growing the lemons and strawberries out back.  We've been here throughout the last 20 years.  But the quality has really declined over the past 5 years.  We won't be back."}, {"review_id": "owxBP2pFaP8g8T6vVq1S2Q", "user_id": "gs1HAp_sImvHS_yCfySaKQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/30/2017", "text": "Delicious food... this way! If you have an inkling for some good ol' Southern cuisine, then you have come to the right place. This place serves up some tasty food at reasonable prices with a smile.My friend and I shared two entree meals, which had more than enough for leftovers. 2 piece fried chicken and catfish strips. Both came with two sides each - we got the fried okra (amazing) and collard greens (good but slightly plain). Each dish also comes with a hush puppy, loaded with flavour and a giant cornbread pancake. I've never seen anything like it!The meal was very satisfying as was the atmosphere. A comfortable yet well maintained restaurant. There is homemade hot sauce on the table, always a good sign. Friendly service added to the experience.Their menu is quite large with breakfast specials, sandwiches or full entrees. Definitely a must try when in the area."}, {"review_id": "k3UdjTSYUS-9ErNp6UB9bg", "user_id": "mz0nmzn1d9jVEUS9HC64GQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "So I heard nothing but great things about this place from a few people. The reviews are great  on yelp. Maybe I ordered the wrong dish or expected too much. But damn I feel like I got ripped off. I ordered the catfish breakfast. It came with one giant piece of catfish, hash browns, scrambled eggs and a biscuit. The hasbrowns were watery as hell, the eggs were dry and the catfish was ok. I paid about $18 for the meal which i think was worth maybe $8. Catfish is cheap it isn't hard to find.  I think I will give this place one more try and order something else maybe it was just a bad day."}, {"review_id": "mnIBodtYnnEoh1XYZw8ImQ", "user_id": "t1zojY9Z4I4ExsMWLSHB0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Be prepared to wait, you may become \"hangry\".. but good food takes time.

And for good reason, the food is BOMB. If you're looking for soul food, this place is it. Collard greens, fried catfish, fried chicken, peach cobbler, sweet potato pie, etc etc. If you wish it, they probably have it. My party order the fried chicken - thigh and drum stick, collard greens, mac n cheese, mash potatoes and gravy. They also give you complementary corn cakes, at first I was like, oh hold up, I don't think we ordered these and our lovely waiter told us, it comes with the meal! No one had any complaints what so ever! The chicken was fried and seasoned to perfection and all our sides were delicious and had flavor. We also ordered peach cobbler to share for dessert! Just be warned,  it is definitely southern style sweet, but if that's what you're looking for, you're in heaven. I also cannot get over the service here , if there was an award I could give, Southern Kitchen would take first place! And it's one of many reasons to go back. Our server, if only I caught his name, was probably the best thing about our meal, in addition to our meal! He was extremely attentive, he joked around with us, and just overall, you felt taken care of - the best. If I lived near here, I'd come here often. If you ever find yourself down in Tacoma, make sure you stop here."}, {"review_id": "9ODWz8eB5uFhupDN4YPO8g", "user_id": "F_e8O1XPYf7kTNdp1-Jscg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "If Kevin Hart was in your hometown and ate here, you'd wanna come eat here too right?! I was really excited due to the fact that this place has been on tv, and has been visit by a few celebrities. There's not too many choices for soul food around so this is pretty big.I really wanted to love this place, but I think I might have just came on the wrong day. It was as a Sunday and they were swamped! We were lucky and got seated quickly, however, it took about about an hour to get our food. I'm going to assume they forgot about our order because the parties that came in after us, got their food first.We got the chicken wings dinner with collared greens, and mashed potatoes with gravy. The fried chicken was nice and crispy with decent seasoning. Not dry at all! Like grandma's cooking! Which unfortunately, I could've just had at home..not too unique. The collared greens...man let me tell you. It was soooo salty! I couldn't take more than a few bites. I felt very bad wasting it ): however, the mashed potatoes and gravy was amazing! We actually never got our corn cake while dining (even after waiting that hour and during our meal)....so we just asked if they could pack it for us. After trying it a home, it was dry and a tad bit bland. Do get teas and lemonades! It's a must, the mango lemonade makes my mouth tingle just thinking about it.I love the staff here though. They're incredibly friendly and welcoming. Kind of overpriced for what you get. I probably won't be back unless I have a friend in town that wants to check it out."}, {"review_id": "rOXeYD8hNo_YJ9xRzowZzw", "user_id": "O06HV8tbH8bOnvRJ8s4CTw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Maybe the restaurant was having an off day today, but the food was really bland.

It's right in the middle of a busy intersection, with a small parking lot- that said, it's kind of easy to miss. The space is modest with limited seating. They have classic barstool seats up front. The inside is decorated with lots of vibrant colors and the walls are decked out with black history photo memorabilia. It was pretty cool to see Oprah, Guy Fieri, and Kevin Hart pictures too. The people here are warm and friendly; that southern hospitality, right?I got the BBQ beef brisket entree with sides of collard greens and macaroni and cheese. Comes with a corncake, which is pretty much cornbread shaped like a pancake. Pretty damn good, I must say. The brisket was also cooked well- nice and tender and doused with a good amount of BBQ sauce. It's a heart heavy meal. Also ordered a three-piece fried chicken. To me, fried chicken usually doesn't taste that much different from one place to another, but I enjoyed it here more than the usual. They don't use too much batter, so you're getting a little less of that crispy and crunchy outer, but the meat is succulently moist. Tastes good with ketchup."}, {"review_id": "6238HJbGFUDEoTIJYyL4UA", "user_id": "GcO0oyFpvkZi0eaJFRCyZA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Best souther food I've had in a long time.

Fried green tomatoes to start were good but the ranch they came with wasn't (I'm talking Hidden Valley bad!). The generic smuckers jam was weak (how does a southern restaurant not have house-made jam?). The biscuit came out cold. The basted medium eggs were cooked perfect. The hash brown were bland. The grits were alright. The gravy was bland. The chicken fried steak was complete garbage. The water cups were foggy old plastic. The coffee was meh. Sheena enjoyed her Cajun catfish.

I really enjoyed this place. It is a very comfy cute little old diner with some good food. The service was very good as well. The whole vibe of the place was very homey. I ordered the two piece southern fried chicken with yams and mac n cheese. My baby ordered the two piece catfish with no bones with mac n cheese and collard greens. We both got two sweet teas. Lemme tell you the sweet teas came in a mason jar and that drink lasted me MY WHOLE meal- which never ever happens. The sweet tea was so good. It was very addicting and I couldn't stop drinking it. When our meals came, it took about 25 to 30 minutes for our food to come so I knew that they just cooked it which is a good sign and OMG is the chicken the bomb! The yams were better than any I EVER HAD. I fell in love. Chicken with hot sauce and yams and mac n cheese. The best. My baby enjoyed his meal too. He said it was very good and that he usually doesn't like other people's gree ns beside his Auntys but he enjoyed theirs. His catfish was good too he said.

This is a little diamond in the rough in this area of Tacoma for hearty inexpensive breakfasts. The food is made with care and a giant serving of love!We had the breakfast special for the day, 2 eggs, your choice of side, biscuits and gravy. I had the grits as my side but they did also offer hash browns and home fries as other sides. The biscuit was a hearty portion with sawmill gravy, thick and flavored with bits of sausage. The biscuit texture was more on the soft than flaky buttery side. The grits were a good consistency and the eggs (Requested as over easy) were well cooked.The exceedingly friendly, genuinely warm service is what particularly stood out for me. Our server was awesome he really made us feel right at home here.The restaurant is small and the parking lot is equally small with a very limited amount of spaces.
