We had a reservation, which didn't seem necessary as it wasn't overly busy. They also have free parking available after 5pm just down the street, which was super convenient. My fiancé and I like to think that we're wine snobs, but we were slightly overwhelmed by the wine menu. Our waitress was super kind and gave us plenty of time to decide; she gave us space but wasn't completely absent. From where we were sitting, I could see into the kitchen area which I found very cool. It was fun to be able to see them preparing dishes before sending them out to be enjoyed. The bar also looked cool and allows you to look into the kitchen. We visited during restaurant week and decided to order off that menu, although we saw food from the regular menu go by and were a little jealous. Probably the most impressive part of our experience here was actually after we left. I had asked for the other half of my entree to be boxed, but then left before it was given to us (oops). They actually called me (they had my number from our reservation) to tell us that we had left it behind. Thankfully, we were more than a few blocks away and were able to turn around and grab it. It wasn't even a very large portion of left overs, but I'm really pleased that they took the time to call us and offer to hold it for us. Definitely plan to come back and 100% recommend to others!!"}, {"review_id": "IBSCRS0VQqPhjr-DARxU7Q", "user_id": "HqMWEEsYIXoFhdDIX1NtrA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Lovely, old-school spot with spot on food, and warm service. It's a romantic, dim light place so highly recommend it for a date night. My husband took me here while on a birthday weekend trip to Portland. Food was simple, but well done, fresh and great portions for the price. It was in the $30s but the dishes would easily be $40+ in the NY area where we're from.  It's also nice to get a breather from just straight up seafood and in a different part of town. Started off with yummy warm bread, and butter (they can refill for you). Then, moved onto sharing a light, yet dry and flavorful Willamette, OR Pinot Noir. They have a big wine list. What we got, was $50 per bottle (Two Messengers). Then, we shared the peekytoe crab cake (delicious, meat, big to share) with a yummy tartar. And the crunchy, hearty Caesar with a creamy buttermilk dressing.  Croutons were small and not overwhelming ( a plus). The nice thing about the service was that they split the salad, and the apps for you. They change their menu daily. I think eating at 8pm was a bit late for Portland because on a Sat evening, the restaurant was not too busy.  We had such caring, kind, and knowledgeable service.  I was lucky to grab the last halibut. The portion was huge - got 3 chunks. I think they were just cooking off whatever they had left. They otherwise would move onto scallops. The dish was prepared with a yummy mushroom risotto. My hubs got the famed duck breast, also huge, with lots of breast meat and confit. The confit, as usual, was delicious. It said it was brined with lavender but it hardly apparent. I think I liked my fish better actually. But this was good. Came with delicious gnocchi. There are many other mains to choose from - filet mignon, stuffed chicken leg, to salmon (it's supposed to be good), to two hearty options. It was yummy all-around. For dessert, we shared a decadent caramel sauced, caramel ice cream which came with whipped cream, and an almond lace cookie for yummy crunch.  Overall, I enjoyed it and it wasn't too sweet as the name would suggest. They put a nice candle in it and sent me well wishes along the way. Would recommend for something off the beaten path. Apparently it's a James Beard Award winner. $200 for dinner which wasn't bad for everything we got.  We were plenty full.  Got a nice seat in the corner and plenty of spots to choose from for 2."}, {"review_id": "gBvfgmryFS__axqYbmiFSg", "user_id": "EzXDaJjdCwMtWdBJiRcC6Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "Definitely is the fanciest, smanciest restaurant in Portland.  Food was excellent.  My girlfriend had the duck, and I had the salmon (which was farm raised - they mostly all are unfortunately).  Both of our dishes were really good!We split the mussels as an app; also excellent.They don't have any craft beers on tap, that affected the rating.The service was excellent from start to finish, including the host at the door.Place has a pretty high price tag.  Special occasion type place - fo' sho!"}, {"review_id": "jM4ttJSA5kiJmJPn8_zn_A", "user_id": "thpSPlb2O_w4TXmStTnvgQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/22/2017", "text": "My boyfriend and I were in town and wanted to treat our selves to a nice dinner. We had reservations at the bar at 8pm. We arrived a couple minutes early but the couple who sat there before us ran over their reservation. The restaurant was very accommodating and also brought us a free glass of wine! It was really appreciated and they truly cared. Once we sat down we were served truffle popcorn and bread and butter. The popcorn was amazing. We actually ate all of it. The bread was warm and the butter was soft enough to spread. Our waiter who was also the bartender was awesome. He made sure to constantly check in and make sure to ask if we needed anything without being over bearing. We decided to order two appetizers and they were nice enough to split them on two plates before bringing them out. The crab cake was awesome had the perfect amount of acidity and had a bunch of crab meat through out. Next we decided to have the hearts of romaine salad which they also split. It was the perfect salad. For dinner I decided to go with the filet mignon which they cooked perfectly to what I asked. My boyfriend got the salmon. Both were amazingly cooked and perfectly complimented with their sides they came with. Overall the food and ambience were amazing. I think the price reflects the service and food you are getting. I would definitely come back here in a heartbeat the next time I'm in Portland!"}, {"review_id": "hxpjfWSM-OrSZmmXF0uiyw", "user_id": "6H_2vRRjevxnoAYTTCgFPg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Wow we came here for my Birthday dinner and Back Bay Grill did not disappoint. We had the mussels for an appetizer and they were the best I have ever had fresh and cooked in a light sauce I would eat them everyday. For dinner I ventured out and tried the duck. I have never had duck before and now the bar is set wicked high. The duck breast was juicy and cooked to perfection. My husband had the filet cooked Pittsburgh style.

FOOD: 10 - seriously, a 10.SERVICE: 10CLEANLINESS: 10Great wine list by the glass or bottle. Very warm greeting from the moment we walked into this spotless, well-run establishment. Fine linens, and exceptional wait staff started shaping our experience.  Everything homemade. The mussels were among the best I've EVER had - plentiful for 3 people, served in a KILLER broth, and freshly baked bread straight from the oven.  The mussels were SO CLEAN and plump - really AMAZING. I had the duck, a signature dish. Cooked to PERFECTION, crisp skin, the whole thing just melting in my mouth. So many different flavor profiles, but staying true to the dish. Just AMAZING, and most restaurants fail with duck. Generous portions, EXCEPTIONAL STAFF, well paced, and DELICIOUS food. Dessert was homemade, and was the perfect ending to an incredible experience.I don't use the word ETHEREAL often, but this place was one of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had.  Congratulations to the men and women professionals who NAILED it - well done."}, {"review_id": "79lxhfpBY4BVFFnS5TQWHQ", "user_id": "Pc_Nx4LV5XKQey2iEkALWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "Portland, ME is a great food town, and Back Bay Grill makes it that much better.  Duck simply incredible.  This place is a 10."}, {"review_id": "jt4JBJAdvCazujsspCcCSw", "user_id": "vpFrkOCUJjTE-GPTcFrzJg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "An unexpected find, with a fantastic staff and delicious food.

It's the type of restaurant that can best be described as \"old school.\" It's a safe bet to bring Grandma here, but the thing is that they do it really well. Saxophones played in the background throughout our meal. We had a gift certificate and being mostly vegetarian, we put off coming in because the menu wasn't all that inspiring. When we arrived we sat at the bar for dinner (it was warm and cozy) and were pleasantly surprised by a menu larger than what is listed on their website. Our server was extremely polite without being stuffy. She was all about us not eating meat but okay with eating fish. I really liked her!  We had a glass of champagne ($9) and a Maine Beer Co Big Bottle ($13). Their wine list was quite impressive if that's your thing. We were given the (free) bar snack of truffled popcorn. Omg. This is the best popcorn I have ever had, hands down. Then came the (free) bread and butter which was warm, fluffy and just perfect. I could have eaten the whole loaf. We had our \"amuse bouche\" of little salmon and cream puffs. (Free) Next we split the muscles without the pork belly as an appetizer. The kitchen actually split the order for us so we weren't both hovering over one plate. This was extremely surprising because the order was HUGE. For $13, we were expecting just a couple muscles. So at this point, we have spent $13 on food and are pretty much stuffed! We each had a salad: the winter greens and baby lettuce. The baby lettuce was basically a Caesar with big shaves of cheese and garlicky croutons. Each component was well thought out and the dressing was delicious. The winter greens came with a hard boiled egg which was perfectly cooked. I think these were each $13. For entrees:-Mushroom linguini which was so so so flavorful. The mushrooms were outstanding. ($18?)-The Atlantic salmon: huge cut of salmon perfectly seared with what I think was couscous and some kind of root vegetable with baby shrimp. One of the best salmon dishes I have had! ($30?) We had to try dessert even though at this point we were busting at the seams. My only complaint is the dessert menu wasn't too diverse (it was old school). It was mostly ice cream which I wasn't feeling.I went with a decaf cappuccino (delicious) and the vanilla chiffon cake with lemon curd, some kind of vanilla cream, and crumbled almond cookies. It was very good! ($9)Today, I must run 30 miles to burn the calories off. It's a great place for a nice meal, or even to sit at the bar and have a drink, popcorn, muscles and bread and leave extremely full for a cheap price tag. I hope you check it out!"}, {"review_id": "_M4KFJT_o20nL1YcgpweMA", "user_id": "xLorpJhIVPNKXxqrSMIaWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Very happy with the variety of food available.

I have never been to any restaurant where the staff is so accommodating and flexible.  I can see why \"regulars\" return again and again. This atmosphere spreads among the customers as well.  I have seen patrons eating alone at the bar, and by the time they are ready to go, have made new friends with the people sitting next to them.Adrian, the Maitre D', and Evie the bartender are of particular note for their warmth and humor.  Adrian has instinctual people skills and greets patrons at the door in a way that can make you feel like you have finally arrived home for a very special meal.  Evie, aside being a gifted mixologist, keeps a congenial conversation going with those eating with her at the bar.While anything I have ever ordered off the BBG menu has been incredible, particularly memorable are:StartersThe Steak Tartare-Do not spend a moment on hesitation!  I often dream about this one!The Mussels-Pair with some of their house baked bread!The Crabcake-One gigantic expertly prepared crab cakeEntreesThe Duck-I NEVER order duck anywhere else, but ALWAYS order it here!The Filet Mignon-Medium rare actually comes medium rare!  A rarity!The salads are all wonderful as are the desserts If I lived a different kind of life (and were not an elementary school teacher), I would love to be a regular at BBG.  I pacify myself with the thought that maybe Back Bay Grill is all the more magical if you only eat there on the most special of occasions.  Regardless, if you are looking for a place to celebrate, or are just plain loaded, call and make a reservation.  Let me know how it went!"}, {"review_id": "6rKKk2SjyVYuN5TSol-NDg", "user_id": "-atxx_G9W1sXZ1RYDqUSVg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/26/2017", "text": "Just awesome.  When you don't have to incur the high rent of the touristy waterfront locations, you can spend your money on excellent chefs, quality ingredients and experienced waitstaff.  Or that's how I imagine the thinking goes.  Anyway, it works at Back Bay, which is not near the waterfront, but once you go inside you are lost in the cozy ambiance and friendly serviceWe had the gravlox and romaine salad appetizers, then the fettuccine and stuffed chicken leg.  Everything was delicious and the portions large.  We were stuffed.Not cheap, but definitely worth a return trip."}, {"review_id": "DNhwpGOWBR14IPTuIP8JzA", "user_id": "4k43P1zuES57ewaGC4jYjg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/25/2017", "text": "Very good, traditional American cuisine in a classic setting.  All the dishes were perfectly prepared and professionally presented.  The lamb chops were among the best I've had -- lean and meaty and cooked medium rare.  Delicious.  The Duck breast dish was another incredible dish, with a portion of risotto and duck confit beneath it.  Lamb pappardelle was very tasty, but too little pasta and too much water marred the dish.  Deserts were above average, and the service was friendly and knowledgeable.  Overall, a solid, high class restaurant for a nice night out."}, {"review_id": "IfrRWFdLrxZYAiuj01f7Mg", "user_id": "FK3R4tDyZlQdTSrF0x_kng", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/27/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "On a Friday night this place managed to squeeze in a party of six.
