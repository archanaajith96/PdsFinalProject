They offer sweet and savory waffles. It's a super casual restaurant. You order at the counter and minutes later they call your name for you to pick up your food. I got the Nutella love with strawberries. It's a Belgian waffle topped with Nutella and whipped cream and your choice of topping (I chose strawberries). The waffle was warm and crispy on the outside but a little doughy on the inside. It was amazing! It cost $8 and came out within 5 minutes of ordering. We came here after dinner so didn't try any of the savory waffles but I would definitely come back here."}, {"review_id": "gdWnql6pVcHeDR3IQtszgQ", "user_id": "hsDYV8OEx19XAKx8GNQe3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "I am so glad my sister recommended this place. I'll have to check if Waffle Love is out in California. Will definitely come back every time I come to Utah. Maybe I'll make a special trip just for Waffle Love. I had the Cinna Love waffle.

The only reason i give it 4 stars is because of the inconsistency with the gluten free batter. I always have to call ahead because we've gone several times while they hadn't had it. My fiancé has celiac so when we find a great gluten free restaurant, we go often.

I love the concept of it - a restaurant solely devoted to dessert and savory waffles. What's wrong with that? For me, it was too pricey for not that great of quality or quantity of food. Now, don't get me wrong, the waffles themselves are excellent. Yet when I finished my meal, I realized I spent almost $10 on a gourmet waffle that I could have made at home myself and it would have been both faster and cheaper. I went with my friend and upon finishing our lackluster meals, we were still ravenous. Maybe this is the hangry side of me critiquing this hip place in Provo, but in my opinion it did not live up to all of the hype. The customer service was meh. They were busy and it all felt rushed. If I did have the money and wanted to treat myself, I would give this place another try and maybe order something else. I got the waffle breakfast sandwich. It was waffle overload with not a sufficient amount of egg or bacon. However, my friend ordered the \"Sunshine\" waffle and that was so much better, despite it's small portion size. Next time I should order that or perhaps another sweet waffle, and then maybe I wouldn't be such a hater."}, {"review_id": "rt34YpsZyLN_fKIgURcTfA", "user_id": "p_2daiuEk774FFHsKrCAlg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2017", "text": "Had breakfast here on the way out of Provo,UT- saw they had a Restaurant, and did watch them on the Great Food Truck race on the Food Network, I went with a Strawberry and Banana Waffle and it was fantastic!

The staff was busy, which I give a little break for rudeness when busy, but it seemed bluntly rude. Secondly, I felt like the waffle didn't really taste like anything.

Its just simply good. Came in this location late Friday night during a BYU football game. The place was packed. There's a lot of energy inside this small joint. The staff was very friendly. Mostly college students. Our food came out and it was delicious. Had their banana cream pie, churro waffle and chicken waffle.

And Waffle love is the very best. They bake small chunks of crack...I mean sugar into each delectable morsel. The toppings to choose from are amazing. We always get the Nutella with strawberries and whipped cream. We got the ice cream once and almost died of satisfaction. So we save that for special occasions when we would mind leaving this world on a high note.Only complaint is space. The dining room here is often crowded and people liner at there tables for a while.This place is tops!!"}, {"review_id": "jLPQHeQoAAR_H-FNXGu3Hg", "user_id": "MxoiJKjMFA5iaYwSf1RYpA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/10/2017", "text": "This is a great place.  I do not know what to say about it.  I have to admit that i am a bit biased because I spent time in belgium and missed the waffles from that country.  So finding a place that makes them well is nice. It is clean, and they are fast.  They make the waffle while you wait, unless there is a crowd, then they may get started a bit early.  The waffles are unlike what you see in america, they rise with yeast, so it can give a different flavor than one that many people expect.  It can be a turn off unless you are ready for that.  I know for some it is an aquired taste.This very much reminds me of a college place.  They are nice, friendly, and overall just a pleasant place to go. Pros:  Good at what they make,  simple menu, fast, friendly. Cons:  If they get busy the parking is terrible."}, {"review_id": "xI9C6UPsrPDYtHkejbHk0w", "user_id": "WqEn62iaUMBKQIq48ziUlg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "Hello my ADA family!!!  My family and I had the opportunity to eat at this food truck at Rockwell Porter H.S in EM.  I have a son that is in a wheelchair and we could not find a spot.

I tried them out recently at a food truck location. Not super pleased hopefully their commissary location is better. I love me some sweets but this waffle was sugar overload. It had a biscoff layer on top of it before the strawberries and cream. It was enough to put me over the top. I threw it away...Loved the flavor and taste of the waffle. The strawberries and cream were nice and fresh as well. A bit expensive for what it is. Don't know that I'll try that again.

You will love it.But I can't rate a place purely on the merits of the flavor of the food. Waffle Love is expensive.  I'm not going to pretend like I know how much a waffle costs to make, but whatever it is, a tiny waffle with raspberries that leaves me $8 poorer is too much. Good food, but too expensive for the average consumer. This is a novelty product that can only be enjoyed on rare occasions, and this bums me out."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/waffle-love-provo-provo-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
