It's something more than a taco stand but less than a full service BBQ, with a dedicated focus on freshly prepared, slow roasted pork paired with craft beer and hearty wines by the glass. There is an ordering window just off the street where the lines form and an outdoor seating area to the left, where you'll find a mix of semi-enclosed and partially shaded seating options, along with an extra bar serving drinks during busy times of the evening. There are 2 other locations in San Diego, at Petco Park and on the Embarcadero near to the USS Midway Museum, but this is the orginal location and the most local, so if you're looking for more authenticity than those other spots, make the effort to come here, especially if it's you're first experience with the \"shack.\"The carnitas taco plate (2 for $8), the flagship item on the menu, comes with generous portions of slow roasted lightly fried pork covered in diced tomato, red onion, cilantro, and guacamole and is served on corn flour tortillas. There isn't much in the way of spice added to the regular order, so you'll need to add Tapatio or Cholula hot sauce from the condiments rack if you want to set off the ingredients with a proper dosage of heat. A pint of locally made Fall Brewing Co's pilsner, or a glass of Foxglove Paso Robles red wine, can pair nicely with a taco plate or the \"triple threat\" pork sandwich, another of the specialties here. There are happy hour and all-day Sunday discounts on beer and wine orders as well and special menu items advertised next to the ordering window, like lasagna or German-style grilled sausage. Nothing is very pretentious here, but all orders are well made, quickly served, and very satisfying.The atmosphere here is equally appealing to the food and drink: a well landscaped outdoor seating area with shady seating on 4-sided counters built around trees, under umbrellas, or in a semi-enclosed seating area within viewing distance to a flat-screen TV. It's pet and kid friendly and attracts a lot of North Park residents, especially on sunny and warm weekends. Definitely a fun and funky stop far from the maddening tourist crowds in Old Town, Little Italy, and the Gaslamp. And close to the Hillcrest Sunday farmers' market as well as North Park coffee, shopping, and bar destinations. Bookmark it for your next San Diego visit!"}, {"review_id": "-iUI-vnNyA7ooxNjU68cKw", "user_id": "ttysyyhtILYl9qTPMoRVBA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Was excited to check this place out.

The service is great. The vibe is awesome too, that little hidden patio in the back is awesome. They play great music and have fans and a TV going. We started with the bacon app, DROOL. The carnitas tacos were so juicy and packed with flavor that I just wanted to suck on the meat all day. Not only that but they were typical corn tortillas with a HUGE GENEROUS PORTION of meat. Loved it. We also got the fried pork belly which was probably my favorite thing there. Super juicy and tender. The sauce they use on top is also delicious. I love their fries and the seasoning they use as well. My recommendation would be to do as I did and go with a buddy and order multiple things on the menu to share. I will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "mAx0SbBcozIasfo84rRyEQ", "user_id": "m6xIwssdiGweFRaSIWTx4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Their carnitas tacos are excellent, and I got their Friday special, which was some sort of pork belly hash taquito which was AWESOME.

It's street parking only, but there's a decent amount of spots available in the residential area. Pork belly app- this was fantastic. Juicy and fatty and the BBQ sauce that it was cooked with was absolutely delicious. Will definitely come back to get this againTriple threat pork sandwich- this was good, but is put to shame by the pork belly app. The sandwich was an absolute gluttony of pork (deep fried pork on top of pulled pork and bacon). Stick with the pork belly app and enjoy a couple beers with your friends.

I ordered the shack steak sandwich. Very moist and tender meat with a nice dash of spiciness with every bite. The aioli sauce sauce made the sandwich extra delicious. The sandwich itself was decently sized, it was able to fill me up by the time I was done with my meal.  Order right in the front by the street, but don't be deceived by the quaint storefront- there's plenty of seating in the back. Once you order, you're given a number and your food will come right to you when it's ready. At night there are also space heaters which was very much appreciated. I might have had some bad luck, but when I went it was a decent wait for my food (~20 minutes) which kinda irked me since it didn't seem especially busy. The food was worth a wait though.

I have NEVER had a bad meal or experience here. The food is always top notch and a few items rotate in every once in a while. I STILL haven't had a chance to try the Poutine and I'm just going to have to make it in on a Monday which is the only day it's served.Staff is always friendly and helpful if you just can't decide what to order. If you've never had an opportunity to visit, I recommend you try the Triple Threat or the Pork Belly. Both are amazing and always a good default go to.If you are in the area make sure to stop by and save room for desert!"}, {"review_id": "IuasZTTJZ5kUDzGQ05stMw", "user_id": "UfiGEp8owldl-K2y_0lhtg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "Came on a Saturday during lunch time.

My friend and I split the tacos (which are served 2 per order) and the triple threat sandwich (bacon, pork schnitzel, carnitas, and a side of possible heart attack). The total was close to $20 after tax and tip. My party of 3 easily grabbed seats on the patio which is tucked away in the back yard of the shack . Our food was brought out to us quickly. The tacos were pretty big and came with a large scoop of guacamole and salsa.. the carnitas were pretty good but may have been a little dry compared l to other places I have tried. I kind of find this to be the case with \"hip\" tacos as opposed to hole-in-the-wall family spots. The triple threat sandwich was unique.. never tasted anything like it. Pork overload.. which is the \"you get what you pay for\" kind of attitude.. definitely not complaining. All the components of pork worked really well with each other. To be honest, any sandwich with peppercinis is a win in my book. Overall good experience, I'll come back if In the area and am craving pork specifically.

It is a bit difficult to see if you've never been here before. Definitely look for the pig on the roof of a green \"shack.\" It's order first then sit service. Lots of outdoor seating! The prices are right for the massive portions. I got the carnitas tacos (duh) and they served at least 6oz of carnitas per taco. It was massive. The tacos were a bit salty but it's nothing that some hot sauce can't fix. The fries were disappointing and the bacon ketchup was even more disappointing. Just tasted like ketchup with bacon fat.

That all changed today! We ordered delivery for about 20 employees, what is better than free food, is GOD DAMN GOOD FOOD! This place is not cheap on their meat and all the food we ordered today was mind blown! Not one thing to complain about!Triple Threat Pork Sandwich: This is pork on top of pork on top of pork! PORK LOIN SCHNITZEL / PULLED PORK / BACON - Pork made three different ways and stacked on a sandwich, I bet you if we ate it there it would've been an amazing picture! Fried Chicken Sandwich: This is a fried chicken sandwich and it was everyone's favorite because it was a bit sweet and savory. We got it delivered and the fried chicken was still crunchy! The chive aioli topped it off and completed the dish. Snackshack BLT: They definitely stepped up their game with their BLT. Its about a mile high of bacon compared to most places, which I enjoyed very much because bacon is thin and bread is thick, this place had the bacon and bread ratio sorted out very well!Pork Belly Mac & Cheese: What makes Mac & Cheese better?! PORK! They added pork belly on top and they weren't skimpy on the portion of pork belly either. The Mac & Cheese was dense, just how I like it!

The front of the restaurant is seriously just a little shack, but unbeknownst to passerby, there are some delicious happenings going on in the back.  My grandma has been a few times before and told me she wanted me to come try this place with her when I was in town so off we went...When we arrived, we parked about a block away and ventured up to the front of the shack.  My grandma always gets the carnitas so she ordered the two carnitas tacos.  I decided to go for the daily special which was the adobada tacos.  We also got a couple coups of water and headed around the corner.They have a beautiful patio set up on the side with plenty of shade trees and fans.  It looks adorable and there are quite a few tables set up. We went and got our water and found a cute little table near the front under a fan since it was kind of warm out.A couple minutes later a staff member brought us our tacos.  They looked simply divine and better yet, tasted better than they looked.  The carnitas were wonderfully flavored.  The meat was tender but not stringy and the toppings were fantastic.  The adobada tacos were filled with expertly seasoned pork, pineapple and other deliciousness. I would absolutely recommend this \"shack\" and would easily return for some hella good tacos!"}, {"review_id": "Itt5VW4Ah-NqMeGW7S5xwg", "user_id": "Bbar1EB4JEviStEAqUEFOg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/24/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Review #006 - 2018We had a great experience here on our last trip so we were super excited about coming back for our favorites on this trip.We showed up on Sunday, Jan. 21st, around 1:30 PM and placed our orders.  The line was short and there were plenty of seats available in the back, but we had a crazy time finding parking.We ordered some of the same items from last item: beet terrine salad, pork belly appetizer, 2 triple threats and a shack BLT.Everything still tasted good, but my BLT took an extra 15-20 minutes to arrive after everyone else's food was already eaten.  I was actually disappointed since it didn't even taste that good compared to their other items.  The sweet brioche was way too thick and the aoli sauce was too sour.  I only ate half of it and ended up throwing the other half away.Their soda fountain was also broken so it was really inconvenient to not have drinks to enjoy with your meal.We'll still be back for our regular items, I'll just remember not to order anything new."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/carnitas-snack-shack-north-park-san-diego-3?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
