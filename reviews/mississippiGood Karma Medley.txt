If you are tired of the typical food options in this area or if you just want delicious vegan/vegetarian/gluten free options this is the place! They nailed everything from hospitality to the food. Each day they have a different menu. They serve food until sold out which means to me that it is practically home cooked food. I will be coming back to this cafe more often i mean beyond impressed!"}, {"review_id": "3bLh0vzQcrgF9BTDVXRcQA", "user_id": "TArZ2KA29w_bP7PBFJSTRg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I went to the one in Biloxi .

It had amazing flavor and this perfect crispiness to it. The Chipotle sauce was delicious, along with the mayo. I also had the lentil soup, which was quite tasty. The cinnamon tea was perfect. The staff were incredibly friendly. We got a slice of chocolate cake and mango cake and they were both moist and flavorful. I really can't say one bad thing about this place."}, {"review_id": "adcNW4n0IHFBXljC7WOUuw", "user_id": "ybU1CpFgKKoNHRYVBezoKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Very simple menu.

Words cannot describe how much this restaurant enriched not only my day but my life. Let me paint you a picture. Imagine that you are famished and about to begin a 3 day roadtrip from Mississippi to Wisconsin with only one driver. Imagine that a member of your party has countless allergies and can never find anywhere to eat. Now, suddenly a light bursts open in front of you to reveal what one would only expect to be a mirage. A restaurant with a menu full of delicious and healthy gluten free vegan options. Can you hear the bells? Imagine my delight upon stumbling across this little gem. Upon entering it is a bit jarring as it is very clearly an old Subway but the owners have tried their best to spruce it up. Speaking of the owners, are there nicer people in the world? They are so warm and welcoming! We felt like a part of their family.A truly unique feat of this restaurant is that they do not have a menu. That is right, no MENU!! The owners cook whatever they want so every day is something entirely new. Just let them know any dietary restrictions or allergies and they will take care of the rest!I had some amazing food during my visit to Good Karma. The salad was light and delicate, the soup was phenomenal, my entree was jam packed with a variety of flavors and textures, the house made poppadoms are fan-freaking-tastic and they even let me have extra, and last but not least the dessert; a simple coconut cookie that melts in your mouth. I am drooling simply remembering all of this tasty food!If you want a truly special experience and don't mind a few surprises I highly recommend Good Karma. Especially if you are gluten free, vegetarian, dairy free, vegan, or a combination thereof! You can't ask for a better experience."}, {"review_id": "SkMVNLB4I4hckbP30Ju0EA", "user_id": "bTGb2QxQT82SKBKAzSfReg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Yum yum!
