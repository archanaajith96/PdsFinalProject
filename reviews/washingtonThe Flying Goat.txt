I asked for a recommendation on what the most popular pizzas were and almost didn't take it when they told me there were pears on a pizza, but was it ever delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to all you pizza lovers out there"}, {"review_id": "C1mva6Q41jxTL-0AWOM7EA", "user_id": "h8JqFWUS9deayebtoiEuxg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Will not be returning here. It is extremely unfortunate because we read all the great reviews on yelp and yet we had such a horrible time. The customer service here is horrible and you only get served well if you are a friend of one of the staff members or a regular. The food itself was moderately good and something I would eat again. When we received our salad, my girlfriend and I were given one fork. I am gave the fork to my girlfriend and asked the bartender if I could get another one. She stated they were currently out and they were waiting for the dish washer to wash them. I found this very odd because people who had received their food after we did were provided with forks. 20 minutes after we had received our salad I was provided with a fork. When our pizza came out, we were given plates that were not washed. There was old cheese stuck on the middle of the plate for mine and my girlfriends plate had old pesto or something green on the rim of the plate. I told the bar tender and she looked at the plates and seemed to get upset at me. She came back with two new plates and gave me a slight attitude while asking me \"is this better!?\". The restaurant was definitely busy but I can't find justification in why we were treated so differently then everyone else. I still left a good tip but I assure you I will never come back."}, {"review_id": "C2rKGyZamzpiQ1FyUdwdOg", "user_id": "cImDQx0o2qDC7qVsYEBAXg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Hubby and I went for dinner one Saturday night. We were promptly greeted, seated within a few minutes at a 4-top. While waiting we struck up a conversation with another couple and got some advice on dishes. Seeing they had no seat and nobody looked to be vacating theirs anytime soon, we invited them to join us.This simply enhanced our experience. The service was excellent, the artisan pizza was fantastic, and the appetizer was really tasty. I'm sure that without the appetizer my husband could have eaten an entire pizza, for they are individually sized. Although I will say, our dinner companions also took their leftovers home."}, {"review_id": "qUUlfRUSDoMokQMnCzvpHw", "user_id": "LEPULBfMm4zKr_3vITYXzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "What a cool place for lunch or dinner.

This sure speaks volumes about how incredible this restaurant has been received. Our first visit... From Washington DC. On our way to Couer D'Alene. Loved the rustic atmosphere.  Got there around 115. Patio was busy but we chose to eat inside. A couple of tables and the bar was full. It took about 11 minutes for someone to take our order which was surprising. Imagine my surprise when Hank, our server, profusely apologized right away and offered to buy our first round of drinks.  We sure didn't expect that and would not have caused a stink but we were so impressed by his take charge approach. We split the most incredible spinach salad with pepita seeds/strawberries and goat cheese, quinoa & walnuts. Honestly, I think it is one of the best salads I've ever eaten!Oh the pizza... not enough accolades to say how outstanding this pie tasted. We have the Kerri Lynn Margherita & proceeds go towards someone they obviously care very much about. When we fly back to DC on Sunday, we're going to stop back for lunch again!"}, {"review_id": "CFEIUD0ZKAw2tX4jsGPuEA", "user_id": "bOFI-JLvjwAOeOSgarHiKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I still love your wings.

It adds to the rustic, homey feel of the oven-fresh pizza. I, however, am not a fan of charred crust. It's okay, just ask for a side of their delicious pesto, and dip said crust into the oily sauce to mask that burnnn.My pizza (the Cora) was quite lovely: pesto, chicken, artichoke, and a sprinkling of tomatoes. I attempted to share with my colleagues, but alas, it all went down my gullet (save a few lumps of coal, err, crust). One colleague ordered the dumplings, and they sounded fantastic.  Who doesn't like deep fried morsels of cream cheese? I don't wanna know them. Feed them crust!"}, {"review_id": "9KmDjY6V55towN5SuPD3WA", "user_id": "Iqf-QFceWRlCqHMQ2qRcsA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Awesome service 99% of the time.

I am visiting relatives from Seattle and one of my friends recommended coming here and there is a reason the parking lot if full almost all the time. The service was excellent as well as the food. We had the signature margarita pizza as well as the Cora pesto pizza. The margarita was one of the best I have ever had. From the marinara to the thinness of the crust it was excellent. They fire roast there pizza and which is a must for any good pizza shot in my opinion. We also had their spicy bbq chicken wings. I would recommend getting at least 3 stars spicy. I'm not much of a spicy person but they were not bad at all. (Side note my mother has a service dog and they even brought her dog a bowl of water without us asking or anything) Overall: service excellent, pizza excellent, drinks excellent, experience excellent.

I ordered the Nat Arugula salad- Arugula tossed with lemon parmesan vinaigrette, served with chicken, roasted asparagus and tomato for $ 12 and added the Parmesan bread for an extra $2.50. It was very good. The lemon juice really makes the salad pop and the chicken and bread give it more heft. I really enjoyed the grilled tomatoes. They added this nice pop of sweetness and depth of flavor.

I can't get away from this delicious pizza. Me and the wife were talking about when first heard of a pizza with egg on it and we thought no way. Then after maybe a year I had a slice. Wow I was hooked. I've probably had it 20+ times now. Give it a try. Be brave.

The FLYING goat. When I looked into non-to-miss eateries in the Spokane area and I saw this name I already knew I was not going to be disappointed. The restaurant has a rustic yet hip feel to it, and its emblem is everywhere -- from surfboards to beer glasses, you name it. Our server initially appeared very deadpan, so it was hard to read him... but he was GREAT! and pretty funny. We ordered the McClellan dumplings (which were deepfried but came out without excess oil, almost like they were baked, which added to their flavor) with pesto and chili sauce, Silver City double IPA (which my fiancee said was so good that he couldn't tell it was a double), and the Waikiki. The pizza was thin crust and baked to heavenly goodness. Not too much cheese, just the right amount of sauce, and sufficiently filling for two. Will definitely be coming back if we're ever in the area. :)"}, {"review_id": "zJkS02maHAb0iQmUJWdwxQ", "user_id": "c8YL8X9Xw6ijFRkn-s337Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/11/2017", "text": "I have been to the Goat many, many times and for some reason haven't reviewed so here we go... I really like the Goat and especially love to sit by the fire on the patio. Everything I've had here is pretty good and they have a nice beer selection but I wouldn't say it's the best pizza in Spokane, especially for the price. All of the pizzas are really tasty though and they have a delicious veggie sandwich as well. If you order an appetizer I highly recommend the Dumplings, they are magical. Skip the pretzel though, that thing is just plain sad. Be forewarned, this place is almost always packed, especially on the weekends so if you come at a peak time, expect a long wait because it's a tiny restaurant with a huge following."}, {"review_id": "7lfrO7oMz6c6KKcTTm7sAA", "user_id": "Y3bVP7Vrl43H2MJojVXVFA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "6/14/2017", "text": "I *might* return because the food was tasty & fresh, if I am willing to put up with airheads, poor service, and I'm not too hungry.Service:-Once I was served my food, I was ignored.
