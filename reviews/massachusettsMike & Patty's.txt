And these are great sandwiches! I came around 1 pm and they started to run out of things, but what I did get to try was fantastic. My friend and I split the Breakfast Torta (added on chorizo for $2) and Baller. The torta had avocado, beans, potatoes (!), cheese, and chorizo, and it was fantastic. The sesame torta roll started to get a little soggy but held up to the fillings. The Baller was absolutely amazing. It was your basic bacon, egg, and cheese on sourdough but with ibérico bacon. The bacon was sweet, salty, fatty, porky deliciousness. I'll be back (hopefully earlier in the day so I can try more foods)!!"}, {"review_id": "Szp_e7EPUKH8zn7wodVTBg", "user_id": "vwFzmf2HC-863YNjeDUgNg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "I was excited about visiting this place because of all the amazing Yelp reviews I read. I went through the photos and the menu and already decided I would get The Fancy long before I actually decided to come here last Sunday. Mainly because I love avocados. I ordered online on my way here so I could easily pick up and head to the Common to eat because there isn't much seating at all inside. After finally opening up the bag, I was extremely disappointed to find that my Fancy sandwich was two slices of bread with 2 scrambled eggs in the middle. Confused, I pulled out my phone again to make sure I had inputted my order correctly. I did: Fancy with scrambled eggs and no onions. They scrambled my eggs and took off the onions, but they left out everything else as well. If it had just been me, I would've thought maybe I ordered wrong and was supposed to indicate that I wanted avocados and bacon even though the sandwich itself states that it would have it. However, my boyfriend got the Robbie 2.0 which also states that it has avocado and a few other ingredients and all of that was present on his sandwich and he didn't tick off any additional boxes when ordering. I was left very sad on a bench in the Common with my $9 egg sandwich (quite literally). Hesitant to come back again."}, {"review_id": "8DtvmhSd841K5x_LLszVEw", "user_id": "X7AVL_5WMOb_wy9s3QBd6g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "OK so you've probably already gathered this, but Mike & Patty's has almost NO SEATING but for 4 stoops near a very small, very crammed corner. I found this experience to be just that... a local Bostonian experience. It is beyond me how such a small breakfast sandwich shop could have anywhere from 10-20 people waiting in line, outside, on the curb, for their sandwiches to be made. Although the sandwiches weren't the best thing in the world (I won't be craving it), I did enjoy a high quality sandwich, friendly service and this sort of \"community experience\" waiting 30 minutes for my sandwich to be made at the corner of a small neighborhood. If I had a ton of time on my hands, would go back for the experience."}, {"review_id": "ud6MS2gAmQU4UK7xpRljoQ", "user_id": "O54qpaPFcfpR9rf7f6Ltag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Overall: If you're willing to wait, the sandwiches at Mike and Patty's are out of this world good.The good: First things first, both of the sandwiches that we got were incredible and were perfect fuel for the day. They had that \"wow\" factor that most other places don't. The Fancy was anything but; filled to the brim with avocado, bacon, egg, and cheese goodness. Hot, well-portioned, and tasted great, and the bacon had something special about it. The prices are also reasonable, especially considering the portion sizes of the sandwiches.The not-so-good: It gets packed, and there's not a lot of room to move. If you come during rush hour, expect to wait 15-20 before you even order, and then be ready to wait outside. Don't come here with more than 1-2 other people, otherwise you'll be waiting awhile and will have to take your food elsewhere anyway.Atmosphere: 8/10Service: 8/10Food: 10/10"}, {"review_id": "v2cedZwsgwhKdjji-RYzng", "user_id": "xQiaZwrAqRjXgjm5hyWyJg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "So my first impression of the place was pure disappointment as to how small the place is. Four of my friends and i were looking for a place to eat that wasn't based in Chinatown, so we looked up brunch places and this showed up. We hauled ourselves over to mike and patty's only to realize we couldn't sit so you can imagine the disappointment. We were met with the most welcoming customer services, got to make friends with some of the people in line. The place is like your classic mom and pop restaurant but with a very homey feel, looks like your grammas early 80s kitchen. There are about 4 seats inside, pretty compact space especially if people are in buying/ waiting for their food.The breakfast sandwich was pretty good, my favorite part was the bread - it almost has some sourness to it making it unique. I will definitely go back, hopefully this time I get a seat."}, {"review_id": "JouuLydwpwEePYlb26W67g", "user_id": "lpHn-VnV89cLE5hmkppNsA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "My favorite breakfast spot anytime I am in Boston. They make the absolute best breakfast sandwiches in Boston. It is a tiny little space that perhaps seats four people at times.  The lines are sometimes out the door. This time around it was just semi busy I order the crack breakfast sandwich & a freshly squeezed orange juice, just so good. Everything on the menu is delightful. The service is speedy The staff is wonderful The price point is kind of high but the quality is worth it.

Just enough space for about 3-4 people to sit and eat along the ledge, so most people do to-go orders. And service is pretty quick.You may think this is just another breakfast sandwich place...how can it be any different with your basic ingredients? The breakfast sandwiches here are AMAZING! A lot of the people that ordered while I was there ordered the torta or the fancy. I think some of the items on the menu change/rotate. I opted for the fancy cause I'm a sucker for anything with avocados on it. Oh.My.God. This is the best breakfast sandwich ever. The bacon was so crispy, the bread was perfectly toasted. The freshness of the avocados and the gooey egg yolk from the fried egg.....there's other ingredients on here that I can't recall but it all comes together perfectly! It's a huge sandwich that's packed with fresh ingredients."}, {"review_id": "S0R1oUNHWlEumtAYrfrgng", "user_id": "5IDOHpkKaD5JqhoPCa1Csw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "I lived in Boston for a few years and never made it to this place, and on a visit back made sure i came but was a bit disappointed. A littttttle expensive in my opinion. I got the Rob 2.0 with bacon, paid 14 bucks, and expected a way bigger sandwich than what i got. They didn't have their traditional bread, so i got it on sourdough. It came with turkey, cheddar, house made mayo, avocado, and tomato jam (interesting). It was grilled which i liked. Overall it was decent, but If I'm paying 14 bucks i would at least expect a monster sandwich, OR make it include a soda and chips.Very small - only 5-6 people fit inside. I definitely suggest ordering online to pick up to avoid the wait. I think if you're coming here, try a breakfast sandwich, as that what people rave about. They did look good, just wasn't what i was in the mood for. But definitely more expensive than your normal breakfast sandwich."}, {"review_id": "jM9fkkncNoq5e2YNmqdONw", "user_id": "2jRCrhVxQTjn0sZBZ_R3IQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/26/2018", "text": "A small shop with delicious sandwiches! Ideal for grab and go.Located on the corner of a residential area, Mike & Patty's makes the most of a small building.  Within its doors is a cooking area that takes up the majority of the space, and a small portion for customers to order and sit (there are maybe 4 chairs).   As a clever byproduct, the small space forces people to stand outside which undoubtedly hypes up the place.  I was able to come during a less busy hour, but I can understand why some might be put off by lines.  There is not much room to wait for food, except on the nearby sidewalks.Undoubtedly the focus of the restaurant is the food, and it is quite good.  I ordered the Fancy which contains an assortment of breakfast items (fried eggs, bacon, cheese, avocado, onions), all cooked in the ideal way for a delicious and manageable sandwich.  Don't have to worry about needing to stop and sit to tackle a sandwich here.  Whether you will be able to tackle an inevitable food coma is another thing."}, {"review_id": "PLxAscOqLT-8adjFNGsTZg", "user_id": "HDw0Snw6PI_kOMIMc1MvAA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "We ordered in this morning, delivery was faster than expected.

Still, it was an amazing vegan sandwich and the best I've had in Boston. The cheese blend, savory tomato jam, greens and what else is in there work so well together. Every bite is comforting and better than the last. Reminded me a lot of southern flavors of my youth. I only wish the sandwich had no end. The vegetarian impossible burger will fix any burger craving. They make a vegan version too. Call in or come with patience, there are about 4 bar level seats and standing room inside for 4-5. I grabbed a sandwich and took it to The Public Garden to devour.

Well how could I not just investigate? So we did an about face and head for some Crack. It's described as so tiny only 2 people could barely stand inside. They are so popular their like a well oiled machine, a assembly line of Breakfast goodness. All they have are beverages and sandwiches which is great. I hate big menus. Just stick to a few things and make them great. Yes, you will basically pay $10 for a grilled cheese but once you taste the ingredients you taste the quality. They are not cheating you, this is legit! We settled on the-Breakfast Crack: 2 perfectly grilled gooey yoke eggs, 3 deferent cheeses and 2x bacon (possibly the best sandwich I ever had. -Edgar Allen Poe: Turkey, tomato Jam, Caramelized onions, collard greens, cheese. Very good. Can't believe I'm gonna day this but the collards, Its doesn't need the turkey........Mind Blown. We ate half of each in the car since there's no where to park or eat anyway. Then headed back tp NY with half my sandwiches and heated them in my kitchen low and slow and it tasted just as good. This will not be my last visit here. The only negative is the parking, it's only for residents. For those that b*tch about the line my suggestion is go somewhere else. If they make a good product then people are gonna want it not just you! Or just go on a weekday when it's empty like me!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mike-and-pattys-boston?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
