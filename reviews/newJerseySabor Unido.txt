We originally wanted to go on Sunday after a concert at the Basilica, but they were closed. Their website says they are open until 9 but they close at 6 on Sundays. That's reflected on their online ordering and on google, but not on their own website. Ok, so the husband and I go back during the week to have a bit of a date night. We haven't been out and about as much lately and wanted some quality time. We both love Brazilian and Portuguese places, so we figured this would be perfect.It's an adorable little spot, I'll give them that. They have limited seating and the place was a little more than half full when we arrived.  The young gentleman who seated us was also our server. He brought us menus and pointed out the specials board above the counter. I ordered the Mixed Meat platter from the specials (half size) and my husband ordered the Grilled Octopus, also a half size.Imagine my surprise when the server brings my entree and it's covered in shrimp. I say \"I didn't order that\" and he tells me that it is indeed the mixed meat platter. I think there's a bit of a communication error here. Shrimp isn't meat. Potatoes aren't meat. The only thing in there that was meat was cubes of pork. I told him I couldn't eat it and he took it away, asked me to order something else, so I ordered the skirt steak.  As we're sitting there waiting I'm begging my husband to eat because his is getting cold. I notice they're wiping some of the specials off of the board because they have presumably sold out. Next thing I know the server comes back out to me with another \"mixed meat platter\" but with the shrimp off of it. *sigh*  He can't tell me at this point if they just removed the shrimp or if they completely remade it.  If I eat shrimp, lobster or crab I go into full-on anaphylaxis, so I don't like to mess around.  Trust me, I'd much rather not be allergic because I used to adore all of those things. I ordered meat thinking it would be safe. I'm still not sure why they just didn't give me the skirt steak, I would have paid the upcharge.I ate very little and started to get the tingle in my lips, so we asked for everything to be packed up and we left. I took my medication, went home and crashed. My husband ate mine the next day for lunch. So I'll focus on the positive here: it's an attractive place, the people seem nice although I think they needed more help in there because they are busy, the half-sized portions are extremely generous and the prices are good. The food is obviously fresh and my husband raved about the Octopus. I just wish they'd had better descriptions of what was in each of the dishes. I thought that by ordering meat the whole allergy thing wouldn't be an issue."}, {"review_id": "_FHKp1KsentklblLHBswTQ", "user_id": "5-n6wEz7B72sIoNr5Nk4_w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "We came in at 8pm on a Friday night and were able to find street parking half a block away. At first, I was surprised by the size and outside appearance of this place & I had some doubts. But Yelp is right again!This place is BYOB, which we had forgotten. But there is a liquor store around the corner. Definitely pick up a bottle or two... while the service is attentive, the kitchen is slow.We ordered entirely off the specials menu: oxtail, steak, and pork. All the mains were great - really flavorful and well cooked. Things were saltier than they needed to be, but that's always how I feel about Portuguese seasoning. I liked the option of half size or full size.The sides were good too. They let me substitute collards for rice, which was great. The yucca was a hit, as were the plantains, although both would have been even better with some sauce.  This is a great place for a BYOB night out. It's not inexpensive, but it's still reasonable."}, {"review_id": "_MIJ0355sRbfqzkv2Magig", "user_id": "jHS_tvtLjcIPSeiJa_xCtw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Woooooo delicious Portuguese dining experience. A really small/medium restaurant along Jefferson Street we decided to dine here after a show at NJPAC. Found street parking relatively easily for a Saturday night.The table ordered almost everything on the menu from beef ribs, to skirt steak, to top sirloin, to sea bass, to grilled octopus, to garlic shrimp and all the sides (sweet plantains, fried yucca, sweet potato and regular fries, rice and beans, collard greens, and fried banana). Wow! Everything was delicious! We especially loved the grilled octopus it was a fan favorite of the table! My skirt steak and fried yucca was heavenly.We also tried their flan and berries desserts which were quite good! They were out of tres leches though!The restaurant is BYOB with a liquor store just around the corner. Really great food and quiet environment. The food took a little bit to get to us but it was definitely worth the wait!

Last week my husband and I had a flight to catch in Newark airport, so we decided to order some food from Sabor Unido and have it delivered after work. The schedule time was 6:00 pm. Around 5:30, I was informed that the delivery will be 10 min late, which is understandable because of traffic, number of orders, etc. However, nobody contacted me again. Around 6:30, I seriously thought they left food with the apartment concierge without calling me, so I went down and checked. Of course, nothing was there... I called Sabor Unido, the lady said \"Oh he is on his way! Another 10 min max!\" At this point, it was still acceptable. Then another half an hr went by, it was already 7:00 pm, we have been waiting for our food for literally an hr by that point. Remember, nobody from Sabor Unido has contacted us, I had to call them to receive a very generic feedback - I doubt they even checked before answering me it will arrive in 10 min... Around 7:30, I got a call from the delivery guy (finally!!!), and he said \"You won't believe what happened, I will tell you when I get there\". Hello? Story time for starving people trying to catch a flight? No, thanks!!! Apparently there was a system error, and our order was missed till we called. And that was the FIRST time anyone told us about the error, only 90 mins after the scheduled delivery time. What I am most upset about is the broken chain of communication, and the lies right in front of customers' face. Never again Sabor Unido, thank you for lying to me."}, {"review_id": "nVmf0B8VRSIDFULhKafEnQ", "user_id": "PyTg7Np9pZZsaNdRqdiYIw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/27/2017", "text": "I had been wanting to try this place out ever since I started school in Newark last Fall. Eventually came in here on a Saturday afternoon post-lunch hours after studying and writing papers all morning long. It was my first time trying Portuguese/Brazilian food and was kind of hesitant since I can't eat pork due to health concerns and I know their cuisine is meat-heavy. Thank goodness their menu are beef-based for the most part. I ordered bitoque and man that was so much food in one plate. It got the steak, fries, and rice too. I would say my first time on Portuguese/Brazilian food didn't disappoint. I also ordered the fresh pineapple juice which made me felt like I was chilling in some beach in South America. The service that day felt real slow to me but I saw that they were kinda busy. The price was really reasonable considering the amount of food you're getting.

Super recommended to everyone. We went in less than an hour before they're closed on a Saturday, but the service was not a bit less than perfection. There were a younger guy (waitor) and an older guy which I felt like was the owner of this restaurant. The younger guy was in charge of our table and he was welcoming and chill, but still the older guy would come a second time in a very humble way to make sure everything was done right. When I tried to order fresh mango juice he told me he would go check if the mangos were ripe enough first. It turned out that the mangos were not ready to use so I changed to pineapple juice and I saw him cutting a pinapple and making the juice himself. This is a small detail that catches people. I appreciate what he did a lot. The food was amazing too, especially the Saturday special black bean stew. We ordered the stew for one (I think by default it's for two) and another octopus entree from the board on the wall. It was so much food that I felt like the bean stew alone would have been enough for the two of us. The collards side that came with the stew was a fresh green, lightly but thoroughly cooked, which I liked much better than the more commonly seen dark green and very shrinked ones. There were pig ears in the stew aside from pork ribs and sausages, which was a nice surprise. The octopus was also very good, only a bit too oily, but I guess the mini potatoes definitely benefitted from that much oil cuz they were so soft and moist. It was such a nice dining experience and both me and my bf were excited that we found out this place. We might come back to Newark just for this restaurant some day."}, {"review_id": "M7M9DHsxq66VeWvCetkD9w", "user_id": "eCy43X201JNHYKbPDN8xpA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "I happened to be traveling by the Newark NJ area and decided I wanted to get some good Brazilian grub. I did a quick search and found this place which seemed to be a nice little mom and pop shop. I walked to the address and couldn't seem to find the establishment, then I walked back to the corner, where is this place? I looked carefully at the numbers and finally realized that it is a tiny little storefront! You can easily miss the storefront if your not watching carefully! It's unassuming and almost doesn't look like a restaurant.Once you walk in the dining area is actually decent size. I would say, it can seat about 50 to 60 people. The furnishings are really no frills, wood tables and old captain's chairs. I was able to choose to sit wherever I wanted. There was a board with the specials of the day written on it in mostly Portuguese. I thought I would have Picanha steak today and ordered their half portion of Picanha, which was not small at all. It came on a hot iron plate, had two Steaks, with plenty of onions and peppers. I ordered it traditional style with rice and beans and collared greens (or Feijoada).   It was so good, in fact better than some of the bigger places in the area. The only slightly down side was I ordered the steak medium. But since it came out on a hot plate, most of it was pretty much medium well or well done. I also had the Brazilian soda called Guarana, so good! All in all it was very satisfying.

Once inside, the interiors were modest and tasteful, and the place seems well-kept.Now, for the food:We got the garlic bread for starters which was mediocre, but it was free, so why not? I ordered the half serving of grilled squid ($11 if I'm not mistaken), and it comes with two sides (I chose boiled sweet potatoes and a mixed green salad). The squid was cooked perfectly, not rubbery, not overcooked; the salad was delightful, with mango chunks and olives (unlike most restaurants that serve some lettuce with a prosaic dressing); and my boiled sweet potatoes complemented the sauce (\"boiled\" usually sounds unappetizing but this was an exception). The entree was presented beautifully as if it were a gourmet dish. I wasn't sure if I ate slower than normal or the food was just filling because I was so satiated there was no room for dessert (which is a bit unusual since I have an appetite of two people combined normally).I heard that to know good food, you must eat the best food. Sounds costly and pretentious, I thought. Yet not all expensive food guarantees good food. Sabor Unido has real, great food that won't cost an arm and a leg.I particularly appreciate that they cater to everyone- whether you're a vegetarian, health buff, carnivore, or a fat kid forever, there's something you can actually enjoy.Looking forward to my next visit!"}, {"review_id": "_3IJwBmpfMVyMw3CnXX0zg", "user_id": "AhG9r9YEE1lEYpknPUfWxg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/18/2017", "text": "We waited 45 min for our food and people that came in after us receive their meal and were on dessert before I got feijoada (which was prepared in advance), chicken Marsala and bife steak.

The waiter was so kind and attentive. He told us about the in-house hot sauce that was just prepared that day and encouraged us to try a little bit. I love spicy foods so I was excited. When he mentioned hot sauce my ears perked up. So I drizzled a little hot sauce on my rice and beans and oxtail sauce... so perfect.I'll definitely be coming back here if I'm in New Jersey.
