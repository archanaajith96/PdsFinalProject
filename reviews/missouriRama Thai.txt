The service is always phenomenal - they're beyond friendly, patient when you have questions, quick, and always smiling. I never have to ask for a refill, they are on top of it. Love love love Rama Thai! Parking can be a massive pain if there's a Cardinals game or big school event, just be prepared to search for awhile. The patio is also great for summer months!"}, {"review_id": "Fp_FBm-VWqiqmCw6ySGDYw", "user_id": "otdRO1dTaIfPjBknS-tJ_w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/1/2017", "text": "So it's really tough to find good Thai food when on business trips. After searching Yelp , I found this place. It was rated at 4 stars. As I got closer to the restauarant, I noticed that I was driving through a residential neighborhood. I was puzzled cuz then I thought my navigation app was steering me wrong. But no, lo and behold, there Rama Thai was. There is a big sign on the front lawn of a 2 story house. There's a picket fence in front and you have to go from the sidewalk, through the walkway, to the front entrance of a house. Once inside, there is a hostess stand and to the right, there is a table that has various Thai scarves for sale. One of the waiters greeted me and proceeded to take me upstairs to my table. My table was situated in what looks to be a living or family room upstairs. Interesting decor. There have been some modifications done to turn the interior of this house into a restaurant but it's not too weird. There looks to be a small bar to the left as soon as you walk in the front entrance.I ordered the satay chicken skewers for an appetizer and the crab fried rice. I was torn between getting Pad See Ew or Crab Fried rice, but my craving for fried rice at the time won out. To wash it down, I had a glass of ice water but I also ordered a Thai iced coffee.I didn't have to wait too long for the satay chicken skewers. The order comes with five skewers. They had decent flavor and came with a small cucumber salad thingie and some peanut sauce. The chicken was moist and not over cooked. Nothing spectacular but tasty nonetheless.My Crab Fried Rice arrived soon after the appetizer. The menu stated that it is cooked with real crab. The small clump of crab is served atop the fried rice. It's not mixed throughout. I liked the fried rice as it was seasoned well and cooked with the requisite Thai Jasmine rice. It was a decent-sized portion but after scarfing down the skewers, I wasn't able to finish off the fried rice. I took a little more than half of the order back to my hotel for a night cap. The iced coffee was good. Not as strong as I'm accustomed to but thankfully not too sweet.The restaurant has a nice homey atmosphere to it because it's in a  converted 2 story house. The wait staff were nice, the restaurant was clean albeit the interior was old, and the food was pretty good. In a pinch, if my work travels bring me back to Springfield, I'll come back here again. I'd give this place a 3.5 stars if I could."}, {"review_id": "HXQOco_Y7tvD564-7lTSfQ", "user_id": "6XsqJM5XUWBkhpExh234TA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Excellent service and excellent food.  Fun atmosphere.

A super casual place, it's literally like someone turned a house into a restaurant. The service is decent and the food is good. The crispy egg rolls are pretty tasty and I had to ask for more. The dip that came with the egg roll was the perfect pair for it. Mixed vegetables was a good plate of food with lots of veggies and very tasty sauce. My boyfriend didn't like the Rama Thai dish too much. He took pork with peanut sauce and said the peanut sauce wasn't good at all and the pork not cooked too well. He loved the side soup that came with it.The servers are always in a hurry and hardly pay any attention to you. They ended up getting us a wrong dish because of a miscommunication between them. They could definitely work on that and also the place could be a little cleaner.I would definitely go back to try more of the options they have!"}, {"review_id": "LNhZIiOju_y9HZdfVkQOqQ", "user_id": "zM1L7Fah8khvzR6VDdavSw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/22/2017", "text": "Yellow Mango Curry with chickenFlavor was really tasty.

Yes we do also get sick of eating the same thing, and of course we don't want to cook all the time. Anyway back to the food! They give you so much food for the price, we usually have leftovers for the next day!

I thought the portion size was great for the tamarind chicken and vegetables (~$10). The quality was average, though that likely suffered a bit since I didn't eat it as soon as it came off the grill. I ordered a spiciness level of 2/4, which was perfect for someone who wants a kick, but not too spicy that will overwhelm the actual taste of the food.Like others have stated, I was a bit disappointed by the quality and quantity of the side salad. Though complimentary, there's just nothing in it but shredded lettuce and a cup of dressing.I didn't have any trouble finding parking and the staff was friendly during my short visit in the house/restaurant.

If I don't know where to eat, Rama Thai is my safe choice. If you come during dinner time, you'll probably have to wait to get a table and then wait for the food cause it's packed most of the time. I usually come for lunch cause it's not as crowded. They also charge less and offer free soup during lunchtime. My favorite dish is Shrimp Pad Thai. The shrimp always tastes so fresh.

I was here last year and had a good meal so I thought I'd return for more Thai food. I had order the sampler plater, Thai ice tea and Thai beef salad. The sampler was not good. The crab ragoon were filled with cream cheese, veggie unflavored eggrolls and potstickers and dry salad rolls. I was hoping that my salad was going to be a bit better. Unfortunately, it was not. The beef had a terrible taste and unusual texture. I took a couple bites and had to have my meal replaced. The third star goes to Mai. The server was very nice and had great customer service. She was kind to get my meal replaced and not charge me for the salad. I ordered pad ka praw medium spicy. It was okay but better than the salad. I do not know if I will come back but I would like try their other dishes before I decide not to come back again."}, {"review_id": "OBy8eCQHwD8J7ii3nRKl1w", "user_id": "wPEjrp0zfsCZ167duXSiig", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/8/2017", "text": "I was in the area and was craving some Tom Yum or Tom Kha Soup. I'm glad I found this place.Started to think I was lost in the neighborhood when I was trying to look for this restaurant until I saw the big sign in front of a house. The restaurant is located at an old house and parking is on the street, which wasn't too bad. The restaurant is small but they weren't busy when I went so I got seated immediately. The servers were friendly but didn't speak English fluently, so it was a little difficult to converse with them.Tom Kha Chicken Soup - big serving for a small order for $4.95. It has a strong, coconut cream taste with a little sourness, saltiness and sweetness. It had big chunks of chicken, mushrooms, slices of white onion and green onion.   Not the best tom kha I've had but it's good enough to satisfy my craving!Crispy Duck in Pineapple Curry sauce - recommended! The duck is so crispy and flavorful. It comes with white rice and the dish is big enough to be shared by two people. The duck was placed in a pool of curry sauce with mixed veggies. The veggies didnt look fresh and were dry, but I did like the crispy duck."}, {"review_id": "dmUFmdK3TPaKQxdTXC1_Hw", "user_id": "L42ZA6O2exBEPRi1MsFJYw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/20/2017", "text": "Rama Thai is my favorite Thai restaurant in town. Not only is their service great and speedy, they also serve affordable and delicious food. Their lunch special is really economical, and each food comes with two delicious crab rangoons and free appetizers (salad and soup of the day). The restaurant ambiance is also very nice; it makes you feel like you are in Thailand. My favorite items on their menu include the Pad See You and the Three-Taste Chicken. You can also customize the spiciness of your food on a 4-star scale, with 4-star being the most spicy. It's easy to find parking as well.

The place is a bit offish if you've never been there before. It is actually a house that they had turned into a restaurant. Parking is in the street. I like the atmosphere, its a bit small, but you can also dine outside on the patio when the weather is nice. You start off with one of their side salads with a sweet, I want to say plum sauce. I've had a few different dishes here but I love their chicken pad Thai 3 stars, which is pretty spicy for me. It really is amazing. Their chicken mango curry is also delicious and I usually order that 2-3 stars depending how spicy I want it. Some people order 5 stars! Too spicy for me, lol. Overall, their service is always great and so is their food. Keep in mind that they close at 3pm and re open for dinner at 5pm..
