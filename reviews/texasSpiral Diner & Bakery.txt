As a vegetarian, I love this place, but I've heard very positive reviews even from friends who eat meat. They take all of your favorite comfort foods and veganize them without losing the flavor. I loved the Buffalo nachos, the Sketti and meatballs, and the migas. The blueberry pancakes were honestly some of the best pancakes I have ever had, vegan or not. They were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I have never had a bad meal here, and I am convinced that I never will.They do monthly specials with themes for each month. I really enjoyed when they had a Mardi Gras theme and they had vegan crab cakes and po boys which were both delicious.The wait is often long (45 mins-1 hour) whenever I've come here, but it's very much worth it. The food is reasonably priced, but it's overwhelming as a vegetarian to have so many good things to choose from, so I always end up spending way too much money here. Totally worth it, though! Spiral Diner can keep all my [very limited] money!"}, {"review_id": "fSWnHvoKoLntPdEJMNsJ3g", "user_id": "fSG4pup3skEMCOAuKWiNfg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Spiral Diner is the ultimate vegan cheat food. Their buffalo \"chicken\" nachos, patty melt, milkshakes and baked goods are by far the most worth it. The brunch is also delicious. I am seriously obsessed with this place. The only reason it's getting 4/5 stars is that they have slow service and a terrible system for reservations and walk-ins. It's almost always busy with vegan and non vegans (cheaters) but I highly recommend !!

The service is good. The setting is good but the food is just alright in my opinion. People hyped this place up but unfortunately, the hype came crashing down on me once I had their food.

I tried them and the flavors were pretty bold.Coffee is all fair trade and organic.

I'm so glad that family recommended that I try this vegan restaurant, I felt so at home here! Spiral Diner would be a great spot to take a friend or family member who believes that vegan food has no taste, is a vegan or plant based food skeptic, and thinks vegan food cannot rival non-vegan traditional North American foods. I would love for this location to acquire more space in the future as the spot they are in now is cramped, but several spot inner dallas are so the locals are used to it. I would've eaten here last week, but the receptionist never sent my party a text that our table was ready, and we put our names in waaay before they closed. I'll excuse the small error as the food was so delicious that I ordered two entrees. (Don't worry I'm no glutton, I saved the other for dinner lol).I would definitely recommended Spiral Diner to absolutely anyone! Good authentic ingredients are used here, the food doesn't leave you feeling heavy or bloated after. Try the oatmeal cranberry cookie sundae with banana \"I-Scream\"!"}, {"review_id": "bMtyYN5bWGO4-fNL4p68Kg", "user_id": "cpYwZ2a3Ib_Scy8czNVzMA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "AMAZING!! My mom and I went here before our long road trip and had the best visit I've ever encountered! Our server was the sweetest and coolest girl I've ever met she was so informative and helpful! We started with the bacon jalapeño Queso which was very good. However, our entrees were the real stars. I got the bacun ranch burger and it was the closet thing I've had to a real burger since I went vegan a year ago! Amazing. My mom got the philly cheese steak and loved it! She said the pasta salad was very good as well. We also got the buffalo chikin nachos to go as well as a brownie and one lemon and one chocolate pretzel cupcake for my sister and her boyfriend for tonight and we are looking forward to trying them all! This visit reminded why I fell in love with spiral in the first place. I will be returning multiple times!"}, {"review_id": "QE1gwh1WXhpcVnvxtWHfzQ", "user_id": "Kg2PNC2000le5Exww4guoA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/10/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I'm seriously done with this place! I would give them zero stars if there was the option. They consistently have the Worst service. Per my last bad experience and review- I decided to continue to support this business via take-out. I figured this would alleviate the horrible and frustrating service I consistently receive here. But Nope, they are very consistent on this bad service thing. On this last occasion I ordered the buffalo chick n Nachos and brownie a la mode. Easy enough? As I wait to pay for my food the manager just stands in front of the register without once acknowledging me. Finally, the gentleman at the other register must have noticed my blank confused stare because he intercepted saying he would be with me in a moment...Once home I noticed that my ice cream is missing. It wasn't worth another 20 minute drive so I called to simply ask for a refund for the ice cream that they failed to give me. (Simple and fair, right?) WRONG! I am told that I have two options. 1) drive back to get the ice cream (as he said oh yea, it's still in the freezer) or 2) Get a 'free' scoop on my next visit... lol how is it Free if I already paid for a product I didn't receive? After speaking with the manager I am told that I cannot be refunded because she would have to refund the full amount and recharge me for the amount less the ice cream. I responded I would simply like a refund because I seriously don't plan on returning for a 'free scoop of ice cream'. At this point I am placed on hold before being disconnected. I didn't bother calling back. This is their service, they are so arrogant that they believe people will continue to support their horrible business practices without as much as a simple apology. Instead, I am told that 'we'll see you the next time around'?! The main reason this type of thing is tolerated is because of the lack of vegan/vegetarian options in Dallas. In the NW they would be fiddling their fingers because of the plethora of better options. Hopefully, entrepreneurs take note of the void! Sigh...Four stars to zero within six visits. If you take anything from this review 'always check your orders and if it is incorrect, don't expect to be compensated. Apparently, they'll take care of you on the next visit because although they messed up, they're sure you'll return.

I came here for Sunday brunch with a friend and they said the wait was about an hour. We ended up only having to wait about 35 minutes and our table was ready! The menu is eclectic and has something that everyone would enjoy. We had such a difficult time deciding on what to order since everything sounded so good! My friend raved about the nachos supremo so we got that to start. Oh my goodness, wow! These nachos were AMAZING!  Topped with cashew cheese, quinoa, beans, olives, guacamole, cilantro, corn, tomatoes, green onions, sour cream, and jalapeños, this appetizer did not skimp on toppings at all. So delicious and the cheese doesn't congeal and turn into gloop like the typical nacho cheese. You must order this!  Portions were huge so it's great for sharing with a group. After contemplating on several options, I decided on the Cowboy burger which comes with their homemade 'bacun' and got a side of their Mac and cheese. Honestly, if I wasn't told this was a vegan restaurant, I would've never guessed it. The patty was firm and tasty and the 'bacun' had a smoky flavor to mimic the taste of real bacon. And let me tell you, that mac and cheese was out of this world. Perfectly cheesy and so decadent, I couldn't believe it wasn't cheese. My friend ordered their daily special which was their stroganoff with meatballs, mushrooms, and asparagus. Also very delicious and the pasta was creamy and delicious. Meatballs were also very good. All in all, excellent food and I'll definitely be back here again soon!"}, {"review_id": "_Jz16fztV7kAHd0UeF-qOA", "user_id": "yDgBhl1QH-z7UMb6i98SOA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/12/2017", "text": "The vegan world is somewhat new to me, and that is only because my daughter has \"gone vegan\".  When we went to lunch today I was impressed that a place like this exists and is able to provide vegans with a great dining out experience in which they do not have sacrifice taste or experience...this place serves up both!  The staff is amazing and handles everyone at the table expertly whether they are an experienced vegan or someone dipping their toes in.  They guide you to the \"crossover\" or \"gateway\" dishes.  To be honest though, I have had what I believe to be better vegan burgers at several other places, but this one one was not bad by any means.Overall though, it was a great experience and I would not hesitate to come back in the future."}, {"review_id": "Gwt3j4KPqYSTh8fxBIH34Q", "user_id": "_1_y6NvVSlH7gKMQlRbNcA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "This is the only place where I can come and get a stunning, tasteful, vegetarian cuisine.

The milkshakes were absolutely top notch; I highly recommend the mocha milkshake. I don't even like coffee and yet that was so tasty. The cupcakes were beyond heavenly - if you're bringing a non-vegan here, they won't even be able to tell the difference in the milkshakes or cupcakes. There are lots of burger options, and they have the beyond meat patty which tastes just like real meat. I would ere on the side of caution when choosing the mushroom-Swiss burger as the horseradish flavor is strong and over bearing. You really have to love the flavor of horseradish to choose this.

I was picturing a mod, white interior with 50 calorie salads sprinkled with chia seeds. But then we ordered the Nacho Supremo. And then I ate my words. And licked the plate. Spiral Diner offers hearty, comfort foods that I'm assuming are healthy because everything is plant based (even the peanut butter cookies and cream milkshake, right?).The nachos with cashew cheese and quinoa and beans and other goodness are my favorite thing on the menu, but I've enjoyed everything else I've tried. The patty melt rivaled Whataburger's. The hummus wrap and bunny bowl were more wholesome options. The only thing that let me down were the biscuits and gravy- the gravy tasted a little too sweet, and the biscuits were dense. The restaurant has a casual ambience with attentive waiters, and you fill your own water. There's always a wait, so make a reservation or buy a pastry to munch on while you wait.

I got the Nacho Supreme as an appetizer to split with my friends and a Tofu Scramble as my entree. The Nacho Supreme was made with a cashew-based sauce as a substitute for cheese and it was DELICIOUS. With the quinoa, black beans, and corn, it was also really FILLING. People might not usually associate these two adjectives with vegan food but take my word. Worth. The Tofu Scramble had an Indian vibe to it with the addition of turmeric and the yellow coloring made it seem more egg-like. I enjoyed it. My friends ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger and Spinach Quesadilla, and we were so stuffed that we couldn't get a full dessert. I really wanted to try their homemade tiramisu ice cream though so we got a scoop to split. Yum!I can't wait to take my vegetarian friend to try this place. My only complaint is that the service is lacking. We waited a while to be seated even though they had tables available and had to track down our waiter for the bill.
