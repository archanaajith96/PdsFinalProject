This place is a popular, casual spot in the Grove - with indoor and outdoor seating, and plenty of beers to keep you hydrated. The burger menu is filled with something for everyone - including a veggie burger that will make you question if your really need the meat. But if you are going to have meat, the meat from Lokal is top notch. It's from Florida, and ground in house each day. The assortment of burgers is pretty creative. Enter - My childhood dream - burger nestled between a donut from Salty Donut. I have never tried that one, but it sure does make for great food porn. I've tried the Fidy Fidy, the Lokal and the Miami Heat. My favorite is the classic Lokal. While I always try and like the Miami Heat, the Jalepenos are raw so it is so so so spicy!The also have awesome apps. My faves are the fish dip and the guac. What pairs better with a burger than some beer? Lokal is offering up a really great selection of Florida craft beer. I looooved the Kaptain Kush last time I went, which is a collab with MIA brewing and Kush that features guava - YUM!A special moment of appreciation for the honey mustard from Lokal. Whether you get regular fries, sweet potato fries, half and half - just make sure you are getting a side of that honey mustard. IT IS THE BEST!Extra shout out to Lokal for being super dog friendly! They even have a special menu for the pups :)"}, {"review_id": "DmdLdR45KY9iWoxJSOBFtQ", "user_id": "iA_MVLQ_FlhZ0VwzcZDN0g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Lokal has become one of my favorite burger places in Miami through each and every visit.  The service has always been incredibly friendly and accommodating. I seem to frequently get their Lokal Burger which is just a classic Bacon Cheeseburger and it is simply exquisite. I wish they would incorporate draft soft drinks, I think it would go a long way with a lot of people. I certainly appreciate it.  Regardless of this, I still think this place deserves 5 stars and I will continue to recommend them. If you want a juicy, great tasting burger and a cool ambiance to eat it in, seek no further!They have a great variety of different burgers. They also give you the option to do half regular fries and half sweet potato fries!"}, {"review_id": "jbPrMqQ4tmi0EbJKHCIP2g", "user_id": "ckG7-tdMfxiukdA4jEnE1Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Mmmm give me allll the carbs aka burgers and beers. After a long few days of drinking (thanks to SOBEWFF), our small group was craving something carby, heavy and filling, so our local expert led us to Lokal. Lokal is located in the Grove and surrounded by many other restaurants, bars, and cute boutiques. Parking can be a wee bit tricky, since it's all street and metered parking, but if you're lucky and maybe drive around the block a few times, you can find something right outside. It was a beautiful day so we decided to sit outside (soak up all that vitamin D). They have a wide selection of local beers. I was feeling something light, so I decided to go for Funky Buddha's Pineapple Hef. Wow, that was refreshing. As for burgers, they have a huge variety of options. Diandra S recommended the \"Frita\" burger, so that is exactly what I got. The \"Frita\" is topped with gruyere cheese, guava jelly, potato sticks, and crispy bacon. I couldn't think of a more Miami burger - the guava jelly just made it for me. I subbed the bun for a lettuce wrap, and it was still just as delicious. I also got sweet potato fries on the side, which was an added bonus to my meal. If you're craving a burger and happen to be around the Grove, Lokal is the place to go! Also, be sure to check out the not-so-secret milkshake bar next door! We weren't able to grab a milkshake because they were closed, but we were able to get a quick tour of the place and it's SO cool."}, {"review_id": "G-YlKmhGi_xTLXy-mZL_5w", "user_id": "NEDuxl85ODtanAS-xRNitQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Delicious burgers in a laidback setting in Coconut Grove.  They serve a classic burger & then a variety of special burgers: the Miami Heat (which has a spicy kick from sriracha & jalapeño), the Frida (which has guava jelly & gruyère), and Juan's fidy-fidy (which is half beef-half pork with caramelized onions).  They serve the burgers with regular fries or sweet potatoes fries.  They also have other items on the menu -- fish tacos, etc.  And lots of beer options.  The food is great, reasonably priced, and with good customer service.  I went with my friend & her 2 year old son & they were very kid friendly.  Had a high chair available & even Gabe him a free stuffed animal to play with during the meal.You can sit inside or outside on a sunny day."}, {"review_id": "CetrmIVWFYRg_XZAZCT8WA", "user_id": "8p1Y78lW6s2926SjAP5oMw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "I keep bypassing Lokal and heading straight for Vickie's because I find myself in the area AFTER already having dinner however I was finally able to grab a burger from Lokal ... and I went for the wildest looking one and am so glad that I did. I opted for the salty donut burger. The idea of a donut for a bun on a burger has intrigued me but also scared me because a donut is so thick, right?Not the way Lokal prepares it. It's PERFECTION.They pick a glazed donut from the salty donut. Slice one donut in half so the donut bun isn't bulky and overly filling and layer that donut over and under their juicy, cheesy burger patty. It was exquisite. I was always under the impression that I would feel pretty gross after eating a donut burger because let's be honest... it IS an extreme burger however Lokal's version left me feeling so satisfied and accomplished that I was finally able to try the donut burger hype. And it was AMAZING.The wait was long for a Saturday night (hence the 4 stars) but they do have a full bar which helps pass the time faster and better. Will be back, Lokal (and Vickie's too)"}, {"review_id": "z4Px0qH82gQB-e_8T-92iw", "user_id": "PVvXY6JuQGfdwaMWAWhXcA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "Is $15 a lot for a burger?

Not a plain old bun a donut, from the Salty Donut, no less. I mean, need I even continue with this review?

This place is just amazing, between the people and the food it was a home run. We decided to eat inside and just the look of this place was a nice throwback to a place you just wanna hang out. We talked with the waitress and she gave us her recommendations. We are not big drinkers so we  ended up trying their pop. The orange hibiscus blew my mind! We ended up trying the gator bites and the flavors, textures, and temperature were perfect. A must try in my opinion. I also got the Royale with cheese, cooked medium as all burgers should be. It was also cooked amazingly and had phenomenal flavor. I was so happy with the service and food I bought a shirt. The gave me a bunch of other stuff with it as gifts.

I was excited that there was a relatively small wait (everyone wanted to be outdoors with the cooler weather), but that this place was so highly rated by so many reviewers.We ended up getting a seat at the bar, which worked out perfectly for us because that's actually where we wanted to sit. I was a little disappointed that there weren't any \"purse hooks\" to hang my purse on, but this was a stupid side note that did not effect the number of stars in my review.We watched  numerous people receive the fried alligator, so we decided that was a must try. I can happily report that I can totally see why they are so frequently ordered! The alligator was delicate and flavorful, with the perfectly fried crust attached. The homemade sauces provided were also excellent accompaniments. At the suggestion of the bartender we tried their two \"most popular\" burgers- the FRITA BY KUSH Burger topped w/ guava jelly, melted Gruyere, stuffed w/ potato sticks, crispy bacon and a LoKal sauce, pressed down and cut in half, and the JUAN'S FIDY-FIDY A burger made from 50% Florida ground beef and 50% Florida ground bacon, served w/ mayo, Monterey jack cheese, smoked bacon from Miami Smokers in Little Havana and a sweet onion marmalade. This is served w/ 50% sweet potato fries, 50% french fries. The burgers were what made this place just short of 5 stars. We have had better. The descriptions that I included made them sound so amazing, but they were honestly just both good. My husband was overwhelmed by the fattiness and saltiness of the bacon in his Fidy-Fidy. With the abundance of burger joints out there, it's quite easy to be picky.We finished our meal with their Key Lime Pie. YUM! Best i've ever had personally. I'm usually not such a big fan, but the huge dollop of cream on top of this pie really took it over the edge.Overall, a great restaurant with an awesome vibe. If we made it down south more we would absolutely be regulars. :)"}, {"review_id": "RZjushZgWIojvd4kEKYfMg", "user_id": "nZvVDimsmfYBCOlwvPqHFA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Best burgers: YESAwesome local craft brews: DEFINITELYDog friendly AND a dog menu: YEPCool restaurant AND outdoor seating: FOR SURE Great staff and service: YOU BETTER BELIEVE ITTo die for desserts: OMGLokal is our go to spot for all things burgers and brews.

This is one of those places that you really hope you're going to enjoy but completely come out of it disappointed for the following reasons:1. Service: The service was subpar. It took a good 15 minutes to get a server out to our table, which I was kind of annoyed that my husband had to go to the bar to get us drinks, mind you, it was around 9:15 PM so the restaurant was pretty empty. Also, not sure if it's part of the atmosphere, but the servers have pretty much this total hipster \"I don't care\" vibe, which was totally annoying considering that every time I tried to order something they seemed annoyed and condescending.2. Food: The food was honestly OK at best. Nothing special, and extremely long to get to the table. 3. Price: So the burgers and appetizers are moderately priced, however the beer is wayyy overpriced! I understand a lot of them are craft beers, however you can go to other places and find the same beers for less. Definitely not going back again, not a good vibe, subpar service and OK food!!Two thumbs down.."}, {"review_id": "twn5WFtzG6s6H8ZkZGBo9A", "user_id": "tuikqq9JDDgIAwP3mhW76A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/26/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "After another long walk from South Miami we made our way into Coconut Grove down town center. GrovetoberBeer Fest was finishing up, and we excepted a large crowd, but were able to find a couple of high stools to sit outside where it was bustling.Not new to Lokal, I knew I wanted a decent beer and also knew they have an eclectic bottled menu of beers to choose. This time I settled on a peanut butter chocolate porter from Baltimore's Du Claw Brewery, called Sweet Baby Jesus, which was packed with peanuts buttery and chocolate flavor without being overly sweet!  After a few sips of we figured why not try go on the deep end and try a non-conventional burger: My Childhood Dream!  Was dreamed up by imaginative burger chef as as a kid working in his dad's donut shop. They cut the donut in half, sear the outside and serve it w/ a 7oz burger, American cheese and candied bacon.  Your would expect the bun of the glazed donut to appear on the outside but the sheet genius is it's the other way around. The inside of the donut is facing outside so you don't glaze up your fingers while eating this desert-dinner option.  I have to say it was better than expected but I did miss my veggies of lettuce and tomatoes.We also ordered the Lokal Salad with a side of salmon which is also seasoned well will Fresh pepper and sea salt. Lokal Salad comes with mixed greens tossed with carrots, avocados, bacon, tomatoes, croutons, green peas, cucumbers, gruyere cheese. The dressing choice was Lokal vinaigrette.  Loved the salad and got all my leafy greens which made up for the lack of greens in the burger we had.Our host made sure we had enough room for our baby stroller. All in all LoKal continues to deliver good service and quality food.  Glad to keep coming back here."}, {"review_id": "g2Zl1BFyU4SmEnb46LLvBQ", "user_id": "DLFihVPkMJqNDlLy2F4hIw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "While waiting over an hour for a seat at Greenstreet for the King Mango Strut, I came down to Lokal to quell my hangries and ended up making a nice discovery.

This was a great 6% IPA with the bitterness leavened by hints of guava and hibiscus...cool name too. On the chalk menu I saw some very \"high octane\" brews as well. For a quick bite I had a grilled cheese. The bread was very flavorful and it's served with a robust chunky tomato soup. The restroom was clean and had eclectic wall designs, and the tab was very reasonable.

Came on a beautiful Saturday in the Grove. There was about a 40 minute wait which was reasonable for the weekend. Service was excellent and they accommodate your furry friends,they even have a dog menu. So right down to business we started with the New Mexico-chili appetizer. Beans cheese chili very good flavor and the chips were fresh. They have a pretty good selection of beers both on draft and bottle. And they're kind enough to give you samples of beer if you ask. I ordered the classic with spicy  mayo. The classic is a cheeseburger with lettuce onion, tomato on a toasted bun. There was something in the spicy mayo that gave it a strange taste like if it had clove in it  my sister in law agreed that it tasted weird.. its kinda hard to mess up spicy mayo. As for the burger  itself nothing special about it. It was cooked to my liking. It just wasn't full of juiciness and flavor like i was expecting. It was kind of bland. Wheres a shake shack when you need it! Fries were nice fresh and crispy. My wife ordered the Frita burger but was let down because she assumed that the name meant that it would be similar to a cuban frita but it was not. To Lokals credit it doest say that it is on the menu. But again i took a bite of her burger and was not impressed. She did however mention that she had the fiddy fiddy burger. Last time and it was great. My sis in law ordered the chicken and waffles. Two large pieces of fried chicken and a stack of waffles with a bourbony maple syrup and sprinkled with bacon..Id have to say it was one of the better chicken and waffles I have had in Miami . However, this is a burger joint after all and a such they should all shine.  May or may not  give this place another shot. Very chill vibe and cool place to have a few beers on the weekend if your in the Grove."}, {"review_id": "ZFU2IT07lrE1KqTZumRjRw", "user_id": "lACykr822R7w1HxAoNWbZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Great service and tasty food.
