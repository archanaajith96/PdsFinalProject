The menu is diverse in flavors but have similar ingredients, which are soy based products.  What makes cornbread cafe stand out from other vegan inspired restaurants is that they make their meals based off the flavor and scent of meat dishes. The first time I tried a \"hamburger\" there my mind was actually blown in how mimicked the taste of it was. Then the \"oh my god is this actually vegan?\" thought turns into a \"how do they even make this?!\"  The customer service is on point, friendly & knowledgeable staff. I have asked the recipe on some meals and they are able to inform me on it. Definitely try the chicken & waffles meal, and the cashew ice cream! Decent price for a vegan spot."}, {"review_id": "aNLaH-Z1HrQrS4lF65vOmQ", "user_id": "gbak6CfHdEp7qMcBgncInA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "I am not a vegan, or even a vegetarian, so I'm not sure I'm the best judge of this food, but I had a good experience here. I LOVED the hush puppies. They were some of the best I've had. I ordered the moody portobello sandwich and it was good, but there's just nothing \"wowing\" about sautéed mushrooms on a wheat hoagie. I did sample a bite of the buffalo tofu from my cousin's sandwich and I liked it a lot (and I don't usually like tofu). I would definitely come back here to try something different (maybe the eugenewhich, or just an order of buffalo hot things). I also want to say that our server was so friendly, but I do not remember his name. Friendly servers can really make for a good experience!"}, {"review_id": "dqvuRgtLxQtOu1flwHAGwA", "user_id": "HFHE6Es1ddKDB-XLgQbt_g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "This place exceeded my expectations.

The service was prompt and very welcoming from the start. Our waitress was great, kept our water full, made friendly conversation and continued to check on us throughout the meal. I never felt like I was waiting. The food was delicious as well.

It's vegan/vegetarian, but I've taken meat eaters here and they love it! The atmosphere is wonderful, bringing you back to an old school diner feel. The wait staff is awesome, always having a smile on their face. But let's talk about the food!! I love the eugenewich. It's a chicken sandwich, that was showcased on DDD. If I'm not feeling a sandwich, then the chicken & gravy plate is my next favorite. I haven't found anything on the menu that I don't like! The agave lemonade is tangy and not overly sweet. Be careful if you're allergic to cashews because it's used pretty heavily throughout their menu."}, {"review_id": "gUjp8jyHCM7HbXYiMiThlQ", "user_id": "ZuymEcnOIAs53WOCnL951Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "Wow! After the great reviews it was finally time to try the Cornbread Cafe and I was very impressed! Although it's vegan, I'm pretty certain all food lovers would enjoy it! I had the fried tempeh that tasted just like friend chicken, yummy grits, and salty sour greens. The cashew gravy was fabulous!We also had the jalapeño hush puppies for an appetizer and they were also perfectly cooked, great flavor. I didn't love the dipping sauce because it was almost too salty. We didn't try desserts but will next time as they seemed very popular.

I love the country breakfast and the eggs benedict. I'm not a sweets for breakfast person, but my sister is and she dies for the French toast. Even my non vegan family and friends love this place!! That diner, old school feel of this place is so comforting and cozy. I love the decor and the continuous refills on coffee. The service is always great, and the food is totally on point.  It gets busy quick, and tables don't fit more than 4. We had a group of 6 and we got two seats and the bar and a table for 4. If you're going to catch up, don't bring a big group. Make sure you get there early and bring some quarters to play the old school PAC man while you wait for a table. :)"}, {"review_id": "ZrDIaqQz3WtKoi_JWF-Bkw", "user_id": "cp6NYX97Y2E2PMevjEOPTQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Not only the best vegan food in Eugene, but some of the best food period.My boyfriend and I eat here often.

I'm not vegetarian either, but I am a foodie and I have lots of vegan friends! Not sure if that'll change anyone's opinion of my review but here goes:I've never been to an all-vegan restaurant before Cornbread. I think that this place is a great option for vegans and non vegans alike because everyone can find something delicious off the menu (unlike most places where there might be 1-2 vegan options if any). Nearly everything they make (desserts, sauces, cheeses) is made in-house. The issue I've always had with vegan food is that it's pretending to be something it's not and then comes up short (i.e., cheese). However, this place really steps up to the plate. My boyfriend has gotten their meat loaf and LOVED it. I've gotten the special both times I went because they sounded too good to pass up. Once was for breakfast and they had this herbed cream (un)cheese that was just amazing! The service is incredible - the staff is friendly and accommodating (although the menu says no substitutions which seems silly to me - what if I want tempeh instead of tofu?). Anyway, I give this place 4 stars because it really is excellent food, but I don't think I would come here if it weren't for vegan friends suggesting to go. It would be easier for me to find something off Cornbread's menu than it would be for them to find something off the menu of a place I'd like to go."}, {"review_id": "yPAXOpcskq6K2ysJkJI4Fw", "user_id": "YBAg0cUD8iIRvgfTDwXfTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Thank you for existing! We live in Vancouver, WA and have only been to your restaurant twice but cannot wait for our next visit!

This was our first stop before we headed to the Oregon Coast, we ordered the sampler platter, double biscuits and gravy, the big'o burger and a side of tempeh with gravy PLUS cinnamon roll cake slices, rice crispy treats and cheesecake in a jar to go (so we had vegan treats for our trip) and everything was incredible!!! I'd also like to note that the homemade ranch is hands down the best ranch dressing I have ever had since going vegan ~ YUM!!!

Never did see that episode of Triple D, but after browsing the pics here of Yelp, my mouth was watering.I ordered mine as take-out, with cornbread instead of fries, and was able to pick it up about 15 minutes later. Cooking and assembly apparently take a while and it's no wonder given this masterpiece's many components--southern fried tofu, crispy onion, and carrot bacon being the most unique.I devoured the sandwich in the car--all of it. It was damn good. Very smoky and savory with lots of great texture. Filling, but not heavy like your typical burger. I appreciated that they include some freshness--tomatoes and lettuce--to lighten it up. The bun was unusual and very enjoyable as well. The only thing that would have made it better would have been a note of acidity--something tangy to really make it pop. Perhaps some sort of pickle. The cornbread was excellent. No one would have guessed it was vegan, and they serve it hot with a dab of margarine on top. Delish. Despite my endeavors not to, I ate all of it directly after the sandwich. I saw lots of menu items I'd like to try, so I'll probably go back and dine in on my next trip to Eugene."}, {"review_id": "B9upR7IXVlhRZ3y5by6Ajw", "user_id": "ZPcYKOWcmAkZR1viqJb7Pg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Pretty good!

Is always under staffed so the service is okay at best. Always busy and takes awhile to get a menu let alone place an order. I have walked out a few times with no one saying anything on the way out. Often with no greeting or goodbye. Cooks were not wearing gloves!? Watched one rub their nose them adjust hat and then back to food. Cooks are way too busy to wash their hands often and it's a small kitchen. They brought water without ice luke warm. Didn't ask if we wanted different drinks or ice. Had to ask for refills. If busy you'll have to wait for one of the few tables but usually pretty quick.I'll certainly be back again but after years the service is the same and could be improved so 4 star is best I can give.Enjoy!"}, {"review_id": "-zb2PNsoQnEeMUlPjQhyOQ", "user_id": "s7qFhPQgZq_po9ffh_Icpg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/26/2017", "text": "Great experience eating here for the first time a few days ago. It was about 6pm on a weeknight, and we were seated within a few minutes even though the same place was quite busy! My friend and I both went with the Bacon Ranch Burger on the recommendation from our server. It was very tasty and filling, though I would've like a little more \"ranch\" on mine. The fries that come with it were only so-so, just regular ol' fries. I'm not vegan but currently testing out being 100% dairy-free so it was great to find a place where I know everything on the menu is up for grabs! I also love that Cornbread sources local/organic/non-gmo/etc (all the good ways to do things) and that they create almost everything in house. None of that weird super processed fake meat stuff here!The service was super and I definitely want to go back to try the reuben!"}, {"review_id": "47XRElobkwKvjp8g3RUtlw", "user_id": "E1rpxC0Tui7GUBRCet4bvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/8/2017", "text": "Vegan soul food paradise.
