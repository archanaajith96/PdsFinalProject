The staff was super nice, and very helpful in making beer recs based on my pointing out ones I'd had and liked, and pointed my toward some fun new ones to try.  They did not let me down with the ones I sampled.  I saw some people ordering flights after I'd already ordered, and might do that on a future visit.  We got the fried dill pickle appetizer, polarizing, I know.  I am on Team Burg & Barrel Fried Dill Pickle.  Large, quartered \"spear,\" beer battered, and fried.  So delicious!  I'm usually a cornmeal breading girl, but the beer batter was devine, and it was a really generously portioned appetizer. The burgers were outta this world, honestly.  I got the spicy avocado burger, and I will say, it was not spicy.  I will also say, though, that it was fantastic and I didn't even care.  I might get a different spicy one next time, or that darned PB & E that everyone raves about, which I almost did get this time.  Husband got the one with mushrooms and bleu cheese, and didn't feel that the bleu cheese portion was generous enough, but enjoyed the burger.  I got tots, and they were okay, but not lifechanging.  Pretty basic. Same for husband's fries...only okay.  Ordinarily, I get owly about pedestrian potato products...don't get between me and awesome spuds, for real. But everything else was so good, I'll forgive fries and tots that are okay, but nothing super amazing. I got a second beer later in the meal, and it might have been my favorite thing of the meal.  I don't get to drink beer a lot, lately, as I spend a lot of time nurturing and sustaining a tiny human being with my own body, but got to take a few hours off nursing as a happy birthday present, and left the babe with grandma and some bottles.  So, yay, the rare beerfest! And by beerfest, I mean two drinks!  Exciting! Happy me!  Anyhow, I ended up getting the insane Chocolate Peanut Butter Porter from Horny Goat Brewery in Milwaukee.  Though I'm not always keen on novelty craft beers that are overly precious/too sweet/weird for weirdness' sake, this one was worth the foray into dangerous territory.  A rich, toasty barley, and more of an essence of rich chocolate and peanut butter.  The aroma was like eating a peanut butter cup, but somehow, the brew wasn't cloyingly sweet.  Just satisfying, and I felt like I'd actually had a nice dessert, which I was otherwise too full for.  I would go back for this beer any day. It isn't something I could drink all the time, but it was a great meal finisher. Keep that goat around!"}, {"review_id": "z9uFiHjqyfKzGVrY0zK9sw", "user_id": "AWlitAwFS-0KtCfyCWh0nQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Yep, it's OK.I don't get this this area often, but found myself here because of some reason I cannot remember, but in the end afforded me a reason to try this joint.  It's a bar and that's OK, but if you are thinking it's a restaurant with a bar, you are backward.  Second, the service was slow, we had to wait to get a drink order in - which is odd considering it's, you know, a bar.Ordered the burger - no, not the burger, the EL DIABLO, with it's beefy beefiness and pepper jack, a couple jalapenos, Franks, lettuce, tom and an onion ring.  I know, what the hell was I thinking!  For all that going on, the flavor wasn't as heightened as you might think and the overall impression was regular kind of BBQ burgerish.  I wanted it to get all up in my face, but I don't know, it didn't speak to me.  The fries were, meh.  The beer was not plentiful enough.Given the opportunity, I would not go back here."}, {"review_id": "hJ5Pd81WR1USpgKzy4XHwQ", "user_id": "vsU67ZLb7aTIz5ng7r7GmA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/12/2017", "text": "The food was excellent, but the service could have been better but it still deserves 5 stars based on the food alone.

I ordered a speciality sandwich BBQ Yard Bird. The chicken was really moist and juicy well seasoned and I love pepper jack cheese on anything but wasn't a big fan of the apple smoked bacon. Opted for sweet potato fries and they were marginal. Kind of soggy and had a weird flavor. My husband ordered the big plate of chicken tenders.

With rotating craft beers, awesome bar food and burgers, and a staff that has always been friendly, this is one of my favorite local spots!

He handled the situation fantastically and personally made sure my most recent order was executed perfectly! My family and I have made this a pretty regular spot.

It was perfect after a movie that let out at 9:15, when most restaurants close at 9:00. Our server, Michelle, was wonderful- sweet, attentive, helpful, and never let our drinks get empty. My spicy avocado burger was delicious with perfectly cooked, tender, juicy meat. I don't have burgers very often, so when I do I want them to be extra special- and this one was. I do wish the bun had been warm, though. Unfortunately, the fries were lacking. I think it was just because it was late and I'd gotten the last helping of some that had been made hours previously. They were overcooked and too crispy, with all the potato flavor cooked away. Next time I'll get a different side- love that they have many options."}, {"review_id": "fREOP9Z1pw4Yw62285cEAA", "user_id": "bGEegJ5CPBf111yF3c8rwQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Go here nearly every week love the burgers and the beer selection.

If you're a beer drinker, this place is for you. If you're not, well, this place probably isn't. I had the fried pickles, the Bella burger, and the tots. The pickles had a unique batter, but weren't exactly flavorful. They lacked the certain punch I was looking for. In my opinion, the pickle spears were too big, leaving too much water in the middle when fried. I've had better fried pickle spears. No when really wanted them, nor finished them. And these are people who have lived and traveled the globe - not picky eaters. The Bella burger wasn't bad. Wasn't spectacular. Just average. The beef did have a good flavor and I liked the bun choice. It was a perfectly fine burger, but one that I will eventually forget. Comparable with pretty much any other American style restaurant. The tots were crisp and hot. But just that. No unique flavor. No special sauce. They honestly reminded me of Sonic tots, which, don't get me wrong, are good tots- just not the best tots. The Keg/draught/tap system was intricate and impressive. I would love to go back to sample some beers and ask some questions about all the brews. They definitely have the bragging rights when it comes to a pretty cool beer system. Very modern and techie. Clean bathrooms. Nice service."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/burg-and-barrel-overland-park-3?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
