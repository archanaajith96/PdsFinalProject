Rule No. 2: Make an exception here. Ambience is less than overwhelming, but it's all good after that. Service was quick and friendly. Food also came quickly. Burrito with pork al pastor was excellent. Guacamole on top was scrumptious. The chile relleno was a large poblano stuffed with cheese and accompanied by rice and smooth, tasty refritos. Had choice of corn or flour tortillas. Definitely will come again if I have the chance."}, {"review_id": "aJ-RBgNzcK_PR7mu1sVM2w", "user_id": "N3NgO7mhErW3_8m79qNwaQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2017", "text": "On my through Lincoln and I grabbed my mom for lunch.

Was a little overwhelmed by the menu. Many choices with what proved to be very accurate descriptionsSettled on a couple of tortas and chips and guacamole. I got the Aztec torta, it was large. Grilled like a Cuban sandwich. Filled with meat, cheese and veggies. I would call that sandwich outstanding. The chips and guacamole were great and my friend enjoyed her torta. The building and decorations are not fancy and this is definitely a family run business. Best way to put it 39 of 40 items to go, hope they all are as good as the torta.   Although, there might be a few of the meats that I will probably skip on, just because I don't particularly care for them. Can't wait to try the weekend menudo."}, {"review_id": "Hm1V3lhV8iN5584vCY8mJw", "user_id": "my8dEThz-9testgzPWCX7Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/7/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "i've been going to ST for years, but i'm done. today it took over a half hour to get our food. i inquired at 20 minutes, then again five minutes before it came. when we received the food i asked why it took so long and the reply was not \"i'm sorry, we're shorthanded in the kitchen today\" or anything along those lines, but \"well, we're busy\". you know what? super taco won't be busy with my business again. too many taco joints in lincoln to bother with a snooty waiter. done. period."}, {"review_id": "RKsVP3pOAch6FbeDKzk3eQ", "user_id": "2CUDp4VrCZ6tht3mJ8Hc6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Super taco was dank, recommended by a colleague of mine. Upon first visit I played it safe and got a variety of 4 tacos. Chicken, steak, beef, and pork with pineapple in it. I must say the pork with pineapple in it rocked my socks off and will be back for ten of those in the future. However the tacos are not enormous I recommend getting 3 to 4. Overall dank.

I've been craving Mexican something fierce this week and I thought I'd give Super Taco a go and see if there was anything they could do for my eating habits + ravenous cravings. Our waitress was super kind and patient with me, she basically gave me nachos but since I couldn't have the corn chips, she had all the nacho toppings put in a (flour) taco salad bowl. Success! My husband had regular 'ole nachos. Our nachos had something like the cheese you get with your pretzel at a baseball game and I wish it would have been melted shredded cheese, however given my eating restrictions and the circumstances, I was just super stoked to be eating some good Mexican food."}, {"review_id": "PoC4i0ceeLgf5d_cAS5xKw", "user_id": "FsyBjBDYE2WqGCgFEfSppg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/11/2017", "text": "Loved it great authentic menu.  They were fast and priced fair Iwill return and try many things soon."}, {"review_id": "0oCeLPCpI-lGD68ykTg1fA", "user_id": "WslBIvrC1ezr4VAvPMEyMA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/5/2016", "text": "Not that I am a frequenter of Mexican restaurants in Lincoln, but I will put it out there that if you are looking for authentic, delicious, and reasonably-priced Mexican, Super Taco is possibly the most super choice.  I went balls to the wall and ordered a beef taco, a chicken taco, both with lettuce and cheese, and a chorizo torta to round it out.  The meats were juicy and seasoned well.  My favorite part of the whole meal: they were NOT marinated with onions or peppers.  I especially do not prefer onions so this was huge for me.  Portions were plentiful and I literally made it out completely full for under $10.The ambience is nothing over thrilling but the food is what matters here.  Also, whoever designed their mascot is pure genius.  If that awesome Super Taco superhero does not lure you into this place, the food will.  Muy sabroso!"}, {"review_id": "SYo-DGTdDIZNkRdrEsDO-A", "user_id": "NDg5yGbeEtbrTwrwHIO_gQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/14/2017", "text": "Second time this year I found a restraunt in a strip mall that was outstanding.
