If crust is everything, Munchies was right when they said Supino's crust was off the hook. We got an 18\" Affumicata pizza with prosciutto, roasted garlic, parsley, ricotta, smoked Gouda, and added mushrooms. We also ordered a salad, but they forgot to put it in with our to go order so we didn't get to try it. :( The 2 of us annihilated  that 18\" pizza, which I struggle with gastroperesis and a condition similar to cyclic vomiting syndrome, so normally I cannot eat much at all. The crust was perfect, light and fluffy and chewy and crisp, with toppings dispersed so that each bite was a new flavor profile of familiar combinations from past bites. The toppings were cut very thin, beautifully presented and cutting so thin allowed for the ingredient to cover more of the pizza.Thank you Supino."}, {"review_id": "_b6_fYT1czKhi8KhjF5j2A", "user_id": "7C_p_Jx1uvSxQ1e9N9v9Gw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Their NYC style pizza was pretty good! The dough they use for the crust was perfect, I really enjoyed that. We got a pizza that was half Bismarck and half City Wing Thing; I definitely liked the Bismarck a lot better. Both were tasty though! Service was a little slow considering the fact that we were there when it was pretty quiet, but we weren't in a rush so it was fine. They have a small, mostly local beer selection on draft with a good variety, which is nice. For the prices and the high quality of the pizza, I would definitely come back if I find myself in Detroit again!"}, {"review_id": "py6PZhUbDarsDC85ihb-qA", "user_id": "WpMj8tyXsrE1cC7_QjQl3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "pizza is amazzzing. I'm from jersey and I've been on a mission for the last three years since I've moved here to find awesome pizza. This pizza is the best in Michigan and Detroit area. I've found this one online and also a few co workers from NY had mentioned to try it. I went there and it reminded me of the pizza back home. I highly recommend this place if you're from the East Coast and want a slice of pizza or like NY Style(Real Itallian) . Even when you walk in you can smell the pizzas cooking and it reminds me of the pizzerias back home. I've been back 3 times since. I just wish Supino's would be open more. Its kind of a hike and Ive drove there and there closed on like a Monday... So deff check hours on there actual website before you take a trip there! Also the atmosphere is awesome I love the set up of the resteraunt! Ps. I was watching The Pizza Show a few days ago, and the guy was in Detroit. Guess where he went to get the best Pizza in Detroit?? SUPINOS!!!! :)"}, {"review_id": "4H9SC1h0rhJsnDWLWBj-YQ", "user_id": "QngxwA3Oj6-YDwbyD93sHQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Great atmosphere!!! Staff were extremely friendly. We decided to sit down and try a few pies. Orders the pepperoni and Quattro. If you don't like goat cheese don't get the Quattro. Both were very very good as thin crust is my favorite. However the best part of the pie was the crust. Very flavorful and Perfectly cooked. Wish this was closer to home. Prices were very cheap In my opinion considering the size. Definitely put this on your list!!"}, {"review_id": "U0wAQ9QOeAHxUxA4JamiBw", "user_id": "Ui8XmHK7m0xaPw4Oc1RVYg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Yes! YES! YES! This place!

I came here with my husband and friend on the way back from picking her up from the airport. You walk in and are greeted by a sweet lady, follow her to your table and she gives you menus and a big jug of ice water and small little glasses for each of you. Different but kinda neat!  We looked over the menu and picked the meatballs it was called Polpette and consisted of turkey, lamb and beef meatballs, roasted polenta and marinara sauce. If my hubby would have known they had lamb in them lol he would have freaked!!! They were really good! We ordered an 18\" what they called \"Red Pizza\" (pizza with marinara sauce) we got half pepperoni and half pepperoni and mushroom . The pizza was so big when it came out lol and piping hot!! My friends eyes were huge (she's a bigggg pizza  freak) I really didn't care for such thin thin crust but ate it anyways! The slices were so big! And the taste was pretty good and cooked perfectly! (And in a brick Oven I might add) I love to try new places in different towns and it was all in all a cute little place !"}, {"review_id": "EowStNDCpEbgdRl_An7_fg", "user_id": "nflXJBtMJIw2jxj50Ob2bA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Supino's - it's the pie that everybody in Detroit recommends to anyone who comes to Eastern Market. Delicious pizza at the corner of the entrance to Shed 2. No, they don't do slices to go. And yes, often the service can take a few minutes longer than you may be used to. But the pizza speaks for itself.It's a thin and crispy style crust (if you're looking for deep dish downtown - then head to Giordano's). Pies will run you about $12-16. But the real quality is in the ingredients, especially if you're a meat lovers pie type. The menu doesn't say where the pepperoni and sausage is sourced, but it's objectively better than what you'd expect for the price. Anyway, enjoy your pizza! If you're ordering anything else other than pizza, I don't know why you're there."}, {"review_id": "1D22_IBTW2AmY1SFJxVh0A", "user_id": "SSnvQv03gT-lDb9afwDH2w", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Im soooooo disappointed this WAS my only pizza place.. but our last few pizzas have been Subpar... this one is ridiculous and its the second remake..

I've been here many times when in eastern market, and every time the line was out of the door and I wouldn't feel like waiting. So this particular day there wasn't a line outside so I decided to try just a slice to render some compass of how they do it here. Now they do have different artisanal pizzas here which may be head and shoulders above the basic pepperoni slice so take my review with a grain of salt; but I was not very impressed. The crust was hair thin Italian style which I like, but the bread didn't taste like anything and was actually a little burnt. There was very little sauce and just as much cheese. It was okay but no more impressive flavor-wise than a slice you might get at a gas station or some such place honestly.Staff was really dismissive, didn't see one smiling face in the joint. It also took over 15 minutes to get that slice but they were pretty busy and it was fresh, I wont complain about that. So all in all I'd just say that I definitely wasn't interested enough to come back for anything more substantial. I don't personally blow a gasket over bread with cheese on it anyway so...there's that."}, {"review_id": "DF78lUMnF954USFaUsOt2Q", "user_id": "IzGiWtAU9LGFZQfHbByIpQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "On a very busy Thursday afternoon, we enjoyed great service.

Since the closure and expansion that has happened, this is the first time I have eaten in the restaurant part. I basically do take out because I'm not looking for \"upscale\" pizzeria experience. Our server John was fantastic.  If I had only my experience on his service, I would have given Supino's 5 stars. However, I can't and won't do that. This is the third time I've gotten \"soggy\" pizza from here, and it's tremendously greasy, which means they must have switched over to a cheaper cheese. Whoever is making the crust, is making it entirely too thin. There is no reason why their standard thin crusted pizza can't hold the sauce and cheese that's being put on it. And if you get a pizza with an additional topping like pepperoni or a San Genaro, it's even worse. Also, in the sit down restaurant area. There are 11 light fixtures, four out of the 11 have dead bulbs and all of the light fixtures have tons of dead inside of them. It's unsightly and disgusting especially for a restaurant. All lights should be working and cleaned on a regular basis. I think my time at giving to Supino's my business is coming to an end. Brooklyn pizza in Troy and Birmingham have a better product, cheaper prices and cleaner joints. And if I want to stay local, I will just head on over to Motor City Brewery for amazing pizza."}, {"review_id": "0n-UaY8suhgLRLXop8lYqg", "user_id": "t_GuaZJ5hpULjoB2k94q-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/10/2017", "text": "Not once have I ever had a bad pizza!

UNISEX BATHROOMS---GROSS. She was very confused, it was sad that she doesn't understand, said I didn't understand either and left it at that.

They may even start to cut corners or change the very things that made them successful to begin with. Not this place... If anything they have gotten better with time. The same amazing crust, not to thin so that it's crispy but not too thick and doughy, sheer perfection. The ingredients still purchased from Eastern Market are ultra fresh and delicious. My favorite is a custom made pizza with fresh mozzarella, roasted garlic, spinach and prosciutto.  They have recently expanded their space to next door so the right half of the building is still carry out and the new expansion is table seating with wait staff. They are in the process of getting their liquor license. The wait staff are amazing and friendly Detroiters who love their city and are proud of the pies they serve. I know those crazy long lines on a Saturday afternoon used to be intimidating, but now that they have more room you have no excuses not to try the best pizza in Detroit!  And while you are there, make sure to grab a cannoli. Made fresh daily by Katie. She hand makes the shell and the creamy inside out of fresh ricotta. They are the best cannoli I've ever had....

The slices came out quickly and was extremely hot. I ordered the cheese slice. The crust was thin, just the way I like it! The sauce, crust, and cheese were in perfect proportion.
