I visit the area frequently from Las Vegas,  and chose this restaurant based on some unique dishes and good wines, and I was far from disappointed! My mom and I made a later reservation around 8:30 PM on a Friday night and we were seated right away upon arrival. The lighting is dim and it seems that there are two dining areas. From the second we arrived to the very end, the service was absolutely impeccable. Our server was so knowledgeable about the menu, the wines, and even the ingredients in the nightly specials. When we chose against the duck pate on the charcuterie board they were happy to substitute it with more cheeses. We had one of the specials, the pork tenderloin. However the highlight of the night without a doubt was the mushroom lasagna with gouda cheese. You'd never even realize this was a meatless dish with how hearty it was. I like to explore new restaurants when I'm out of town, but I will absolutely be back every visit to Fayetteville for that dish! I also loved the Cabernet wine flight they offered. For such a beautiful environment with gourmet food, the prices were more than reasonable. If you live in the area, please, go eat here and eat some of this delicious food for me!"}, {"review_id": "rwPZRJjLNpi-Fx9eWMkx2A", "user_id": "eNwOWFVoMn_nzirel2KPpw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "It's Dickson street , So we share the casual, yet diverse atmosphere with some of the best service I've had in NWA... food was simply amazing.. The cheese plate appetizer had a nice selection of cheese with not a lot of meats I prefer, and they didn't mind we opted out of the duck pate, the goat cheese replacement was perfectly paired with the sweet spicy jelly, so yummy! Calamari such a great shareable appetizer, it was crispy, and the sauce was savory deliciousness! The Pork special had flavor great yet was just a tad dry,   waitress did remind us it was cooked well done. The reduction was superb, Green beans & cauliflower were sufficiently camouflaged to be a potato and not show it. The mushroom Lasagna was a such a hit!   The most  hardy for a vegetarian meal!  Pesto base made this dish hold up under pressure! The Waitress knew her menu, and was obviously well versed at fine dining, wine, & keeping us happy!Really impressed with the wine list, there are flights for indecisive, and reasonable prices. We loved the option half bottles, this place reminded me how much I like good wine.  I will return, with the girls for wine, lasagna & more.."}, {"review_id": "7dsADaHHgVUm1dG6CGBtZQ", "user_id": "5n-q5h4xYeJVSNk1TKMMeQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "Very yummy dinner alert!  If you are from Fayetteville or find yourself in Fayetteville, be sure to stop at Bordinos.  Hubby and I had dinner there before a concert and it was the perfect way to start our evening.Started with the Triple Take which was grana pidano cheese, roasted garlic and balsamic served with bread.  Very hard to stop eating although I knew more carbs were coming.I chose the vegetable risotto and it was made extremely well and had a nice amount of veggies.  We shared the mussels in a lemon-white wine sauce and they were freakin' good!  And then hubby had some ricotta/wild boar sausage thing and he loved it as well.Overall, exceptional experience.  Would absolutely come back!"}, {"review_id": "iZpKEHW5mj9y8IXPesetDA", "user_id": "9zj2-vhldejiXQhp4DyjiQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "I never write a negative review based on one dining experience but after 2 dinners and 1 lunch I feel I can say with authority that this place is a huge disappointment. The menu lacks depth and creativity, offering basic fare at fine dining prices....  our glasses went empty, we watched our server pass our drink order at the bar several times before we asked them to bring them to the table, soup salad and entrees all arrived at the same time making for a crowded table, soup was cold and salad was warm, steak was over cooked.

Was able to snag a nice big table in the back corner, perfect size for us. Brunch menu here had a nice variety of choices and tasty cocktails. I had the spicy Bloody Mary, definitely suggest you get. For entrees i had the wild boar biscuits and gravy. The gravy def needed some work. Was lacking salt and overall flavor. The biscuits were decent. A lot of people in the group had some type of Benedict. Was unexpected when our server asked each of them how they wanted their eggs poached I.e. Soft, medium, hard. So people went between soft and medium... they all came out medium. Overall brunch here was ok, service was friendly but did take a bit for the food and drinks to get to the table."}, {"review_id": "pMz136Iimszv2FlJLg7wyQ", "user_id": "_mzPX3ha9HN3LMUF7vSoBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Excellent food as always.

The atmosphere is very high class and the waitress was very attentive but not overly intrusive into conversation. Like the other reviews said, the starter bread was good and it didn't fill you up before the main meal arrived. I got the beef tenderloin rigatoni which was amazing. Not too saucy, perfect portion size and lots of complimentary flavors. My boyfriend got the beef tenderloin entree and asked for medium rare. At a lot of restaurants, it's a hit or miss if you actually get your preferred cook level (unless you ask for straight rare or well done), but his was perfectly cooked and lightly charred on the outside. Great date night restaurant all in all!"}, {"review_id": "8XcxsB5WjNcl4Wyax86GVw", "user_id": "ru3hZE32UGgQOMlBiIK3Pg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "The food is good and they offer unique flavors and dishes. We have been here for Valentine's dinner two years running and it seemed like the quality has decreased some but the prices definitely haven't. This is easily a $100+ meal for two. Our service this time was not very good, it took forever for our server to bring us anything. As soon as we sat down, she prepared us a plate with oil for dipping, but it was about 30 minutes later that we finally asked her to please bring the bread because up to that point, we still only had water and a plate of oil. It was generally at least 15-20 minutes between the times we saw her, even if we asked her to bring something back with her. I mentioned the bad service to a friend and she was able to immediately describe the girl to me because she had had the same experience just a few days before. When she was present, she was nice enough, but I'd rather not have to spend almost 3 hours at dinner because of slow service."}, {"review_id": "dI64ZvPxwdrgiHKRnSgnKQ", "user_id": "am5c0sdhuFOIxERMGsuv_g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/13/2017", "text": "Enjoyed a private party there.

They were then promptly escorted to their seat while I, a customer with same size party and same reservation was left to wait another 10 minutes. While the food was decent I do not think he prices were reasonable. I would not recommend the seafood, it was not fresh for a $30 piece of fish and two mussels.

The food was solid. I had the beef tenderloin entree. The steak was cooked with a good char on the outside and a hot pink center, and the Gorgonzola butter on top was delicious (it complimented all the Cab Frac wine flight very well). The real standout to me was the mashed cauliflower/potatoes- they were delicious-texture and flavor are on point.

Last night was one of the most disappointing dining experiences I've had in Fayetteville. From the get go our waitress seemed annoyed with us, sighing and making kind of rude faces when we asked questions, or when I let her know the 3 of us were celebrating my friend's 21st birthday. I don't know if she just expected us to be bad customers because we are college students, or if she was having a bad day. But it didn't even compare to the standard of service I usually receive with Bordinos. Our drinks were delicious even though it took almost 20 minutes to get them. I ordered the beef tenderloin- I have been wanting to order this for over a year, and was super excited to finally give it a try. I'd heard good things and for $38 had high expectations. When my dish arrived, the potatoes and broccolini were cold, and the tenderloin was just warm, bland, and super rare when I had ordered medium. I'm not picky and I don't like to complain, but it's frustrating as a student that very rarely goes to nicer restaurants for special occasions. This may have been a rare occurrence but I'm not sure that I'll take a chance on it happening again."}, {"review_id": "zws8nFXttVaqrHbGTg5sKg", "user_id": "6RRUyf9vN2OLjbtE2hoYsQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Not impressed.
