The music is never too loud and the atmosphere is just perfect. Crepes are a delicious treat too! Their WiFi can be a bit spotty, but it has never bothered me too much.

Haha.  I was Yelping coffee shops and found one walking distance from my hotel and decided to go there.  After packing up and heading out Yelp had closed so I reopened it, found the coffee shop and headed out.   When I got there the pictures didn't match what I was expecting and I discovered my error.  It was a fortunate one as this was a great little place!I ordered the Cubano iced coffee and the Grinch crepe.  Both were delicious and I recommend them.  The drink was sweetened with brown sugar and. It could have a little stronger coffee flavor, but was delicious anyway.  The crepe was tasty and had delicious ingredients.  The only negative here was the girl taking my money was a little distant.  Seemed like she would have rather been elsewhere. The guy making the crepes was friendly and had a smile though. Overall it was worth a try. If you found this review helpful please click the button at the bottom!

Cultiva has good reviews and is a great little spot that reminded me of a place called Collectivo in Milwaukee, WI. I had an iced latte and my husband had an iced latte with almond milk. We also tried a blueberry danish that was homemade and delicious! I wish they would have had Splenda but they carry Truvia for a sugar substitute. It looks like the crepes and hot cakes are very popular and a frequent local hang out."}, {"review_id": "hJX7mbDkQjayzPNXUYUxIw", "user_id": "D9vUisDgRAgyM75aqWBXMw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/13/2017", "text": "I was very pleased with my order of the scrambled egg crepe The Yeti and a simple dark roast drip coffee. Though the food and drinks were exceptional, the ambiance wasn't great and it was crowded the entire time I was there.Coffee: Cultiva is worth the trip just for a high quality cup of coffee. This was objectively the best cup of coffee I've had so far at Lincoln and it even comes with the added bonus of a free refill. I would highly recommend ordering a simple drip coffee.Food: I've had several crepes in my lifetime, including some from France, their origin, so I know how to judge a quality crepe. I would say that this crepe was decent, and I appreciated the combination of scrambled eggs in a crepe. The crepe itself was alright, but I especially enjoyed the flavors inside the crepe. Ambiance: It was very loud inside and there wasn't much room to spread out, so it seemed pretty crammed the entire time. Granted, it was a Saturday morning, so the crowd was somewhat expected, but it might be a difficult place to get much work done unless you have some good noise-blocking headphones (which I thankfully did).Service: The staff were pretty courteous, but seemed pretty stressed from the large quantity of people constantly in line. As expected, it took a while for my food to be ready, but it wasn't an unreasonably long wait. Overall, I was pleased with the quality of coffee and crepe that I ordered, and would come again for this reason. However, Cultiva is more a place to come to chat with friends or for a nice brunch rather than a quiet place to do work."}, {"review_id": "alt6hMx5HmnUOKPZK27ZSw", "user_id": "QulcOywLHMXh_h4OsdIe7Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/19/2017", "text": "Great coffee shop centrally located with parking in front.

This location (which is the original) has excellent coffee and crepes. Cultiva hangs it's hat on great coffee. They probably have one of the most expensive cups of coffee in town, but you get what you pay for - a high quality and delicious cup of coffee. And the staff is passionate and educated about coffee. Last time I was in the barista gave me some helpful pointers on how to best use my French press.Also, in the last year they rearranged there dining room which has made their space much more usable and accessible."}, {"review_id": "cdD6ntgFsB6mLHUF9sOsYw", "user_id": "9QpVif5JpUXaciCzk-2Lxg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/3/2017", "text": "Double shot and mocha muffin were spot on.

This is not your typical coffee shop...they have lots of food options! They have both sweet and savory crepes. My sister tried a savory with cream cheese and salmon and she was not disappointed! Being gluten free I had the option of omelets or scrambles. I made my own scramble with cream cheese, pesto, and ham, it was fantastic. The portions are perfect, I left full but not uncomfortable. There are multiple locations in Lincoln, one right next to UNL's East Campus. It looks like a great place to stop and study when on that side of town. I am looking forward to making another trip here!"}, {"review_id": "PUHr58GhyvDaAPeWV5fHZg", "user_id": "v7yzz_KW2KPP4_1vWWRIww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/10/2016", "text": "Wonderful place for starting your morning !I am a big fan of this place for 2 reasons;a- it has the best omelets here in Lincoln b- I live 3 blocks away from it. My favorite omelet is the vegetarian and it is really quite filling( I add extra mushroom to it), so usually what I do is I go there are around 11sh and make it as a breakfast/ brunch thing. Their Mocha is amaaaaaaaazing to. Over all it a lovely place to go and experience on weekends in my opinion.So enjoy it guys;)"}, {"review_id": "PjrPpp_kZnY2YYZrLSuKPw", "user_id": "BGNynJGS9uDTy0IBNzOz7g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "Walked here from my hotel on a recent work trip.  I like to chill with a chai tea and get some work done when I try different coffee shops.  Tea was great, but music was blaring and made it hard for me to relax.  Maybe I'm getting old  but I prefer a mellow atmosphere."}, {"review_id": "_oKMZzLiwy2PX4ppE1Wqew", "user_id": "r4KWlmLLaQHVhKfsH_rLQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/16/2016", "text": "Awesome place with a lot of local flavor.I got a sweet crepe- \"The Dutch Boy\" which had cookie butter, raspberry jam, and cinnamon on top.
