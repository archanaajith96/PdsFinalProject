They are not designed to get you in and get you out quick. Their process of making your desired coffee drink takes time. It's worth the wait but you need known going in, it's not a quick process. The decor is very inviting and it's a great place to enjoy a coffee. The food selection, while limited, is very good. The quiche always goes quickly on the weekend. If beer is your fancy, they got it. Locally brewed. It's a nice touch. If you've got the time to sit, talk and enjoy your coffee, this is the place for you."}, {"review_id": "ohq31C3yNq3j2ikyzMmSMQ", "user_id": "tuSz___zqInditWOHWHDeQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Every employee exuded southern charm and hospitality...the chai was amazing, the atmosphere was beyond what one would expect in a little place like this, but it ended up being our absolute new favorite place anywhere!"}, {"review_id": "2tYnM-n0gecIxMLw5jaoQg", "user_id": "9IqnhRbE8MR1LWNBAA6ZJg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Cool and eclectic place.  Good reuse of infrastructure as it was once an auto mechanics garage."}, {"review_id": "lgMgZKoSdFe2D2bVIqh2Xg", "user_id": "e6K4JQZEltqZ6o7uhq2kTQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/28/2017", "text": "This is one of the best repurposed buildings I've ever seen. The building, supposedly an old gas station, is crescent-shaped with white distressed bricks that stands on its own. It almost stands like a monument when crossing one of the prominent downtown intersections. For someone who visits Fort Smith for the first time, you find intact all of the old brick 'Wild West' style buildings from the 19th century and then you are sort of confronted with a modern repurposing of one of these old buildings when you hit the intersection. Inside of it is a lot of old antique 1960s furniture, like tables, the type of stuff you wouldn't find at a casual cafe in Los Angeles. They even have a crazy vine growing halfway in and halfway out the opaque window in the bathroom. The vine blurs into a silhouette as it ascends outside. When we went this past weekend, it took quite a while, nearly 20 minutes, to get two simple cold drinks as there were only two people working. We played an entire chess game on their chessboard before we got our drinks! Since the entire crescent-shaped building was casually busy, they might want to staff more people on the busy weekends because it seems like when three people are in line, they instantly become slammed. The drinks, by the way, are good! The cold brew is lighter tasting than I'm used to. It's not necessarily a bad thing to be deprived of that 'kick' of the long brew when taken straight, but I can see it tasting watery if milk is added to it. They put a lot of effort into really cultivating a cool downtown vibe here. And just for the fact that it has made me quite excited to describe the looks of this place, it also has shifted my impression of downtown Fort Smith of being just a historic city to new vines growing within it."}, {"review_id": "cVoqNgxdlfJiIcUIcBvONQ", "user_id": "6d9DI3FxaRREHsvW0DLDEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "The little place is absolutely amazing!

The downtown iconic nature of the building is so cool. I've spent hours there; working (alone and for meetings), reading, on dates with my wife and even as a family.

Daily, they have fresh baked goodies that are AMAZING. This is an incredible addition to the Fort downtown presence.
