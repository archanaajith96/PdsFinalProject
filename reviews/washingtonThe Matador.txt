Typically it's either for a special occasion of some kind or to start of a night of *ahem* wonderful decisions. Either way, they never disappoint!The food here is pretty fantastic - I love the skillet mushrooms as an appetizer. If you make it in for happy hour, you won't find drink specials but much of their food is brought down to reasonable prices (And then some)! The nachos take a pretty significant price dive during happy hour, and it's a great thing, too! They're delicious.Some of the food here isn't a fantastic value, but the quality of the food is pretty damn good which makes the slightly higher price point a little bit easier to overlook. Their entrees are delicious, but the ratio of meat to rice and beans leaves a bit to be desired. For $18 for a plate of carnitas, I'd like to get a pretty sizeable helping with some rice and beans to go with it, not rice and beans with a side of carnitas. And just a heads up, tortillas are not included with most of the entrees, so prepare to tack those onto your bill as well. The tequila menu is absolutely to die for, and they occasionally have top-shelf specials that make it a bit easier to sample the higher end tequilas at closer to Sparkle Donkey tequila prices, which is nothing to sneeze at!Definitely pay the matador a visit, but be prepared to wait a bit. No reservations and a popular spot can mean that you might have some opportunity to check out the area nearby while you wait to be seated."}, {"review_id": "djtkQ1MuNCfQ3pWHcnrsgA", "user_id": "yykjbOjt8I6zLiMKTWvWdA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Anyone who reads my reviews probably knows I'm a huge fan of tacos. So if you open a joint with tacos on your menu, chances are I'm paying you a visit at some point. That's just how I roll.So a couple things to touch on, for those who may be visiting for the first time:We're talking about downtown Tacoma here. More specifically, we're talking about the North end of Pacific Avenue here. Parking is what it is, and it isn't much. Expect to struggle if you're looking for a parking spot around here on a busy day, or even worse a Friday/Saturday night. The venue itself does not offer parking. There are some lots not too far away for those who. like me, don't mind walking a couple blocks. Who knows, you may get lucky and find street parking.No, they don't do reservations. So time your visit accordingly. Or put your name on the list and go for a walk until it's closer to time.Okay, now that those details are covered, let's get to the good stuff!The decor is funky, interesting and different. It's hard to describe other than an eclectic funky blend of historic building mixed with a strange Mexican vibe and topped off with some modern metal art elements. To me it's a typical Tacoma space; weird, different, funky, eclectic and a touch of bizarre.understand that this space can be loud. My wife complained about the noise level the whole time we were there. If you're looking for intimate, you're in the wrong place. If you're looking for vibrant, well there you are!Now, the food. I stated that I specifically came here for the tacos, but I always have to scope out an option for my dining companion. We started off with the Matador Guacamole and Crispy Brussels Sprouts. The quac was okay, but could probably have used a bit more \"oomph\", while enjoyable, nothing to really write home about. The Brussels were actually very good, bold flavors and perfectly prepared. While I could probably live on tacos alone (I am from Texas after all), the wife needs something else to get through life. So I ordered her the Agave Chicken Sandwich, which she enjoyed. I went with the standard \"Street Tacos\", which come as a selection of 5 different tacos. I found each one of them to be interesting, flavorful and exciting. As my list of taco joints go, even though they don't call themselves a taco joint I will certainly be looking to return here. With a tequila menu that was twice as big as the food menu I'm hoping I can use that to persuade the wife to endure the noise level again soon."}, {"review_id": "uDdOxyda1kc3uZ3Ga05sAA", "user_id": "5uqzKdVvJJDxPdcnYR2Mzw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "The wait can be super long sometimes, and they don't take reservations. It is nice that once you get your name on the list that you can leave and come back when it gets closer to the time you'll be seated. Parking can also be a nightmare just because of their location and all the other bars on Pac Ave that are close by so you'll want to get their early, especially during happy hour. Their margaritas are delicious! Their happy hour nachos are super good, but get the chicken (the beef is kind of weird on the nachos flavor wise). Their waitresses are super nice, and the bartenders are super friendly. The atmosphere is intimate because it's dark and they have real candles lit everywhere but it can be a little loud. Verde chicken burrito was mildly spicy, the pico de galo tasted fresh, and the cilantro sour cream sauce was very refreshing. Their Spanish rice and black beans were kind of blah, and lacked flavor however. I really enjoyed the Chile rubbed shrimp tacos and will definitely be getting those again! The fajitas can be pretty messy since you make them at your table, see photo."}, {"review_id": "91-bXQuJphOfSWS73J8gDQ", "user_id": "_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "I have been pretty much training for happy hour for most of my life. Discounted noms? Excuse to drink before 5? Sign. Me. Up. A friend and I met here last week to share some snackas and enjoy an evening out without those husbands. The restaurant is impeccably decorated with large mirrors, high ceilings, and fascinating decorations. The server was friendly, energetic, and didn't have any problem guiding me towards selections that accommodate my needs as a no choice member of the ihateglutenclub.We decided to order several smaller plates and enjoyed the romaine salad, bacon wrapped jalapenos, a quesadilla made with corn tortillas, some of the cutest little steak street tacos, and some dynamite shrimp. The server was great about double checking with the kitchen to rule out any evil gluten and ensured celiac prep precautions. With every dish being a burst of flavor and complimented by a chili mango margarita, we determined this was a solid place for some serious noms. Happy hour prices made this a great deal and pleasant service laid my gf anxiety to rest."}, {"review_id": "KOAh1Q8fKZa5uLNcUAE5rQ", "user_id": "cAs3AuzqeevE_GyHauZkgw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "Today, we visited the Matador for the 2nd time. We enjoyed ourselves again!It was Monday (President's Day) at about 2:45PM. The place wasn't too busy. It took a while for our server to get to us, and when she did, we had to ask for chips and salsa.My wife ordered the carne asada tacos, and I had the 5 street tacos ($12). Her carne asada was really good; the meat was seasoned excellently. My street tacos were exactly as advertised.Service seemed a little slow for the number of tables occupied; it seemed to take a while for water to get refilled. But this is a minor issue - had service been a little better, I think 5 stars would be in order.We enjoyed the chips and salsa as well.

We went on a Sunday for Happy Hour, which turns out is only for food deals and not drink specials. Our server must have been having a bad day because she was not very affable to our table. I ordered the Chicken Tortilla Soup and the Brussel Sprouts; the soup was served at a lukewarm temperature and lacked flavor/spices and the brussel sprouts were DRENCHED in the oil they were tossed in and were a bit too charred. Towards the end of our meal, we had to ask one of the bussers if she could track down our waitress to get the check because she only checked on us once after we received our food.

I've tried one or two other things from the menu but I love some good nachos, especially since they use real cheese, so I find myself ordering those 99% of the time I come here.

Name a more iconic duo, I'll wait. Located on Pacific Ave where all the poppin' places be at, The Matador is an awesome place to either pregame or end a fun night out in Tacoma. Either way, this tequila bar has delicious margaritas with a LIT (literally because I like sitting in front of the fireplace and get a good buzz going) yet relaxing ambiance. I recommend getting the street tacos; you get braised beef, carnitas, al pastor, chorizo, and shredded chicken all on one plate! Or if it's Happy Hour, you can choose what you want for the low low amigo. Good for groups, service is quick, food is bomb and drinks are better.
