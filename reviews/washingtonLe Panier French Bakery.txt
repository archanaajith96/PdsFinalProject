Simply the best bakery in the area with the freshest baked goods, get there early (like before 8:00) because the lines often form outside the door and the wait can take 30 minutes. I'd recommend the coffee here as well as it was very good, don't bother waiting in another line at the original Starbucks next door unless it's your prerogative to have a coffee from \"the Original\" Starbucks. For savory recommendations I'd offer anything with vegetables (spinach/broccoli were amazing) or if your craving something sweet try the apple, peach, or raspberry tarts).You really can't go wrong pretty much everything we had blew our minds."}, {"review_id": "EMEikyzuXKGddMGyYMi7sQ", "user_id": "5fuKJGv-jHqbabzrH0Mxhw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "While visiting Seattle I happened upon a different bakery that only sells macarons (Lady Yum), and had some of the best macarons of my life. So when I saw Le Panier I knew I had to try their macarons to compare. I'm obsessed with macarons, and good ones are so hard to find.  At Le Panier, a self proclaimed \"very French bakery\", I ordered two pistachio macarons (my favorite flavor) and a chocolate filled chocolate eclair. The macarons were a good consistency, but the pistachio flavor  was as strange...it tasted ok but didn't really taste like pistachio. The eclair was not great. The chocolate cream on the inside did not have a very good flavor. It was all good enough to eat but not really worth the calories in my opinion."}, {"review_id": "YvVX7eQKrcSyHoiUOa8b-A", "user_id": "kN2mY2zCa22X2fIPXpZZhg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "French pastries that will blow your mind!! My main purpose of visiting Seattle was to visit my friend, but another priority of mine was trying out all of the foods that Seattle has to offer. Piroshky Piroshky was definitely on my list, but Le Panier French Bakery should have been on my list as well because it blew my mind! It really is a must try in Seattle. During the weekends, the lines can be quite long, but I wouldn't say as long as Piroshky Piroshky. Must Gets: - Chocolatine - 5/5 My goodness! The perfect pastry! If you love chocolate, marzipan, pastry, this is a definite must get. I fell in love at first bite. It's so flaky and not extremely sweet. It was such a heavenly delight. I would not pass this opportunity up if I'm in Seattle again. - London Fog - 5/5If you're a lover of Earl Grey Tea, I highly recommend this drink. Most Earl Grey's can be a bit overwhelming drank straight from the brew, but not this one! It's extremely light and slightly sweetened. It's well balanced and not overpoweringly scented. I could drinks cups and cups of these every week if I was here. It's a nice way to get your caffeine in if you're not much of a coffee drinker, like me.Another note I'd like to share is they have indoor dining. It's limited seating, but on a Monday morning the crowd isn't massive so you can enjoy your pastry while sipping on your London Fog in a quiet setting. This place really exceeds expectations. It's a tough decision to make, but from my experience at Le Panier, I'd say it stands slightly above the local and tourist favorite, Piroshky Piroshky."}, {"review_id": "Rwcu7qaQ75fexIh8loHnbw", "user_id": "7f6ZDbtiFvVK0Ajhb0fuAA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet. LOVE this place. Everytime I walk through Pike place market I have to stop in here and pick up something. I think I have tried almost everything that they on their menu(except their lunch sandwiches,  but I intend to try that soon) and love it all.Today I picked up a few macrons(chocolate, caramel, lemon, pistachio), a chocolate eclair, palmiers, and a normandie.I loved the normandie and some of the macarons and palmiers I have already had and I am looking forward to enjoying the rest."}, {"review_id": "uZWB9IPGQNfM3ES-MMukww", "user_id": "4ZbCVQZAbW3Reg-xw9Nxag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "I visited Seattle shortly last October and stayed very close to Pike place. I had breakfast at this bakery for 3 days straight and I missed it so much. I tried their almond croissant and chocolate croissant for breakfast, paired with a cup of creamy cappuccino . On the last day, I also got a beef sandwich and a box of macaron to go. The croissant was puffy, with the perfect amount of butter and sugar. For the macaron, the cookies was slightly crunchy while the filling was soft with the right extend of sweetness. My favorite is the rose. The bakery was quite busy in the morning. The staff girl was so sweet and efficient. You don't even have to go in the store to smell the heavenly smell of roasted coffee and authentic french pastry. Located in Pike place where there is high volume of tourists, their pricing is surprisingly affordable at $2.75 per breakfast croissant."}, {"review_id": "ggHENF51aUAvh_r3x3z9yA", "user_id": "5XAhiYaFOAbfrjb5ANhftQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "This is considered as a must visit place for macarons when in Seattle and rightly so.

Cute ambience, convenient, friendly staff, and great food. The amandine was really good, nice almond cream inside a flaky pastry. The brioche framboise was just ok, kinda tasted like a jelly donut. The macarons were to die for though. We tried every flavor but the caramel, chocolate, raspberry, and pistachio were my favorites. Perfect crispy outside and tender inside, with a delicious filling.

I am such a bakery lover and I just stumbled across this bakery when I was walking around Pike Place Market one morning. It was the aroma in the air that caught my nose and led to me this French bakery located right across from Pike Place Market.They had a great selection of beautiful and delicious smelling pastries, that makes you want to buy one of everything! I was tempted too but resisted and got a palmier, croissant and a black coffee.My first bite of both pastries were fantastic. The perfect amount buttery, flakey and the right amount of crunch to every bite. It paired so well with their coffee! It was a perfect start to my morning! I wish there was a location right by me!

One of the popular bakery on pike place market which is always crowded (maybe because of the market being a tourist attraction).If you ever go here the must try items as per my choice are the savory puff pastries(Mushroom,chicken and onion).Also we like all the croissants here .Some very good collection of macroons ($2 each). Only suggestion would be to just focus on the french renowned items .Try not to order any coffee which I personally did not find it great. Otherwise it is all good .

Simple, sweet, and delicious!!! This has to go on my top of my list for french bakeries! If you are in the area, you have to visit this place. There may be a line, but it is well worth it to try out their pastries and London Fog! I am such a sucker for London Fog. For those who don't know what it is, it is a earl grey tea latte meaning it has a earl grey tea with whole milk, sugar, and vanilla extract. It was full of flavor and if you're a tea lover, you have to try their London Fog! All of the same sizes were the same price so I just whole the large one for $3.00! How awesome is that?!?!? My boyfriend got a classic Pain au chocolat which is not my favorite in general but he loved it. I tried the Au jardin which was a garlic bread with tomato and zucchini baked on top. There was so much flavor in that piece and also the last one on the window!! It was so good. Downside was that they were not able to warm up the pastry but nevertheless, it was so good."}, {"review_id": "ZNFYO0h_O5TxBHYKVlOARA", "user_id": "0xyd2D57ptXgAZhxIVPKmQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "I don't do sugar so this is based strictly on their lunch sandwiches.

Easily one of my top 3 French Bakery places on my list! You MUST visit here if you are strolling thru Pike Place Market. I found this place on yelp and i'm so glad i waited in line for their pastry! I ordered pain au chocolat and amandine. IT WAS FREAKING DELICIOUS!  My only regret was not ordering more. (There wasnt a lot of choices left when I went. Must've got there at the tail end of the rush) Although I was super full from eating lunch just half hour ago, I still scarfed down the amandine after i purchased it. It was crispy, flaky with a light glaze of honey on top with hints of almond flavor. After finally getting back to my hotel, i ate the pain au chocolat too. That was actually my husband's but he showed no interest so I ate it. I am SO glad I did lol. A lot of the pain au chocolat's I've had before were very sweet and either a bit burnt or had that slight greasy feel to it. The one at Le Panier was nothing like that. The chocolate filling was smooth and medium sweet, the crust was flaky and golden and each bite you take makes you want to eat more.Even though it has been about 5 months since I visited Le Panier, I can still remember the smell of fresh baked goods when you first walk in their store and the beautiful display of pastry, breads and macaroons. If you love french pastry as much as I do, you will NOT be disappointed (despite the long lines here!) My advise is pick out a couple more baked good than you intend of buying because you will regret that you didnt! I can't wait to go back!!"}, {"review_id": "FkvH0U7J1LoUWIPs7oUL1w", "user_id": "i1aWMluSEy8kX4BZt4R7XQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Such a nice option in Pike place market.
