We went twice! It was so good! The first time, we were seated immediately and had top-notch service. The second time was on a Sunday morning and we had about an hour wait (but it's worth it). We shied away from the Mexican-American dishes (being that we are from California and Arizona) but I thought it was interesting that they offer them.Highly recommend but not if you're in a rush."}, {"review_id": "QI1HU42BKupkcbL2ALD0gg", "user_id": "-coV63UMcJghWgOTDXjHbA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "We stayed at the attached Hampton Hotel and didn't eat here until the last night. My first impression was that the staff was really friendly. They serve breakfast all day, so we took a while to order, jumping back and forth between the options, but the server never showed any signs of impatience as he came by to take out order several times.Once a decision was finally made, we ordered the Fish Tacos (fried cod), the Tuesday Taco Special (chicken), and a Hot to Tot Burrito (eggs, bacon, tots, cheese, avocado, and onion). The kitchen happily prepared the chicken tacos \"deconstructed\" so my daughter could build them herself and avoid the \"it's has something I don't like on it drama\". Everything was really tasty.It was a late dinner, so we also scored 1/2 price donuts to go (after 8:30 pm). Will definitely hit this place up again next time we're in Madison."}, {"review_id": "uu5oS-0i3OIYXlUi3yInjg", "user_id": "KViAfL75-D4FLdH9OUcuPg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/28/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Decent spot. I was not terribly impressed with the huevos rancheros or the chicken and a biscuit dishes. I found the huevos rancheros to be a little lacking in flavor and the chicken to be a little dry.The staff were super friendly. They serve coffee from Colectivo, which I like. It'so pretty great that they serve breakfast all day. This probably would not be my first choice for brunch but it's an okay option near campus or if you are looking for breakfast food in the evening."}, {"review_id": "nOLbUZeUbcXhi4lhiqgGcQ", "user_id": "mpA_MUVXL7gutzrOh7KdHA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Ambiance/service: Really funky atmosphere. Little hipster diner feel to it. Mostly booth seating. The wait staff is all young and fairly attentive. The wait for food has been historically pretty slow. We had a party of 8 and it took 50 minutes for our food to come out.  Food: all the menu items sound to die for but I've only had some luck in ordering things that are actually fantastic . I've had the Thai peanut bowl. It was really watered down and honestly just gross. Then I tried the rice bowl. Maybe it's my own fault for order Asian at a breakfast place but that was not good either. The last time I went I got the hot to tot burrito and that was phenomenal. Their breakfast potatoes are pretty good too, but I like that you can get greens for the same price.  Overall pretty decent food for a decent price."}, {"review_id": "zVNkjrNXsnYgNYi_CTXCxQ", "user_id": "idH0OzpRHWnOL8ALY855dg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "One of the best brunch choices in Madison. Huge serving amount with similar price comparing to other brunch restaurants near state street/capital area. (You will see the entree sizes are way larger than donuts)Toasted with the mostest(avocado toast) is a very healthy brunch. Two thick - cut 8 grain toast secretes with a side of mixed greens. Corn, black bean salsa, quest fresco and cilantro. (Normal menu has red onion on it, but I am not the fun of raw onion). To me, If the grain toast is little softer, it will be better!French-toast also is served as big amount. The coconut  milk-battered challah bread is really good, not too sweet and soft. I love the mix berry, coconut cream and French toast combination.I am not the fun of the donuts, which are too sweet for me. But the heart shape during valentine's period is so cute! I used to try the egg Benedict, which is delicious as well. Plan to try the Fried chicken and donut, fried chicken biscuit  in future"}, {"review_id": "PmVMzZVbV378XwFTZ4yCKQ", "user_id": "e7w_jUmm-g9eKQhEH4Srkg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Was excited to try this place, but was quite disappointed.

We also tried the lemon ricotta pancake. Less of a lemon flavor, more of blueberry compote. The pancake was fluffy and the ricotta whip was delicious. This was huge. We couldn't even finish half of it. Next time- this should be ordered for 2 people together. We also tried their old fashioned donut and ginger bread donut. We must return to try more of their donuts. All in all, we loved the place. Parking is not easy to find but it was worth every effort in getting to it.

I am a big fan of all the FoodFight spots, and this one is one of the best, IMO. I visited here the other night with a friend, on a Tuesday. I didn't realize there was a concert happening at the Kohl Center that evening, so it was crazy downtown. LOTS of traffic, LOTS of people, and LOTS of frustration just trying to get to the restaurant. BSBC is awesome because there is an attached parking garage that you can typically park in and have the ticket validated - however, if the also attached hotel is full, and there is something big going on, the ramp is going to be full. We had to walk a few blocks once we finally found a lot with an open spot. Brrr. Now, every time I have been in to BSBC the service has been stellar. Friendly and attentive staff, quick food delivery. This most recent time was very different. You could tell the staff was under a lot of pressure, and I don't blame them! The place was packed! We still only had a wait time of 15 minutes, though, which isn't bad! Our server was nice enough, but not super friendly or chatty or personable. The food was definitely the shining star of the night! SO YUMMY. We started with the everything pretzel app, it was HUGE! The two sauces it was served with were both very delicious and paired perfectly with the pretzel, despite how very different they were from each other. I had the savory french toast entree. OMG! The hollandaise was perfect. The egg was like the cherry on top. My friend had the pot roast egg sandwich which I will be trying next time I visit, it looked amazing. Will I go back? Absolutely. Will I make sure there are not concerts happening at the Kohl Center next time I go? Absolutely, and you should too. That was a disaster."}, {"review_id": "kTig-YM8St1RSD_e8tZlPQ", "user_id": "uLJ07HGE-SHf7anYwo96jw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/10/2017", "text": "This is a regular stop for us when we're in town visiting Madison. They have quality food at a good price. It's tough to get in most weekend mornings, so pretty much always expect a wait.

I normally like to get a donut while I'm there! For brunch, pretty much everything is a good choice on the menu. The reason for the 4 stars is that I've been disappointed in the food the last few times I've gone-- it's been very good, but less flavorful than before it seems.

The place was packed and we were told there would be a 55 min wait (perhaps state basketball folks flooded in?) but got lucky with two spots that opened up right away at the bar, so we just ate up there. Delicious bottomless Colectivo coffee! We wanted to eat everything on menu but narrowed it down to the Chorizo Chili Bomb Burrito and Farmer's Hash. We couldn't believe first of all, how much food we got!! (Both went home with leftovers) And secondly, how scrumptious it truly was. Sometimes breakfast out can sort of be the same to me, but both dishes were unique and packed with flavor. I'd have to say if my Farmer's Hash would have some sort of sauce or something that would be nice, but then again I'm just a lover of sauce and extra flavors on really everything. I really was drawn to it because of the sweet potatoes because you don't see those in breakfast dishes much! We grabbed a donut to go...which didn't even make it home into the house with us...that too was amazing.  Don't miss this place for brunch - it is a must!!"}, {"review_id": "YIowy3N9Ly75niyIYPM0cA", "user_id": "JG3Dw619w0tRFU4SjZ0Fdg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I'm staying at the Hampton Inn where this restaurant is.

I've gone here a few times over the years and it has consistently been enjoyable! If you choose to come on the weekend, expect a wait. Every time I've came here on a Saturday or Sunday there has been anywhere from a 30 minute to an hour and a half wait. One of the coolest things is that they make their own donuts, and they're very reasonably priced ($1.50 each). This week I tried the espresso cream cheese donut and it was delicious! The first time I ever dined here.. I sat on their patio and had a spicy Bloody Mary .. and let me tell you.. the skewer of refrigerator pickles that come with it are sent from heaven. Sounds silly, but give them a try and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. This week I had the farmers hash and it was phenomenal. It came with a generous portion of Brussels sprouts, parsnips, sweet potatoes, and onions, topped with two eggs over easy and two pieces of sourdough toast. I am a fan of vegetable breakfasts so this did not disappoint! Their menu offers a selection of classic breakfast options as well as unique and healthy options. If you're a French toast fan they have amazing sweet and savory options. Also an FYI.. you get a two hour parking voucher for the Hampton Inn and Suites parking ramp when you dine here!

Ordered the Denver Omelette special with breakfast potatoes and extra ham ($11) and the Oatmeal Creme Brulee with a side of berries ($8).Pros!:-Our server, Ronald, was funny and enthusiastic!-We were big fans of the decor and super-comfy swivel bar chairs.-Denver Omelette had generous amounts of sauteed onions and peppers and plenty of cheese; It was generally pretty darn savory and tasty-Brown sugar shakers on the tables.. Nice touch!-The staff enthusiastically gave us a table along the South West wall and put up the shades to help me get some Vitamin D.-The Oatmeal Creme Brulee delightfully blended the wholesome mouthfeel of fresh-cooked oatmeal with the serotonin-y desertness of creme brulee.Cons (just a few minor cons which might not be cons.):-My potato preferences are pretty run-of-the-mill, but I thought that the breakfast potatoes could have used a bit more cooking time. -Oatmeal Creme Brulee was a bit on the smaller side, thought Girlfriend and I had plenty of food and ended up taking a small box home.-We couldn't buy any of the super-comfy swivel chairs; We asked if they had any old ones they were getting rid of, but nope.Summary: Great place to sit around, look at art and decor and listen to music (5 stars) - The people working there are warm and attentive (5 stars) - The food is pretty tasty too.

It was really delicious, but definitely not as thick as a typical smoothie, and the mixed berry puree was very seedy.The food was incredible. The omelet was wonderfully fluffy as the menu had promised and it had generous amounts of ham, bacon, and cheddar cheese in it. It was also topped with this amazing Vermont white cheddar fondue. The potatoes were fantastic as well; they were just the right amount of crispy and very well-seasoned.
