If you're in DC, you HAVE to try this place! My Recommendations:RESERVATIONS: They don't currently take reservations over the phone. You can make reservations online at: RosesLuxury.com. DRINKS: 1. The Tequilla & Jalapeno infusion drink has a kick!2. The Scotch & Earl Grey drink is fantastic and is served in a tea cup. FOOD: I hear the menu periodically changes. They offer a tasting but we were advised that this only samples a limited number of items. If you have a group, you can sample more of the menu by ordering a la carte and sharing 'family style.'APPS & SALADS:1. Crispy Young Favas2. Lychee Salad3. Oysters & GranitaENTREES: The steak & pastas are INCREDIBLE! You can complement your food with a wine of your choice or the waiter can help.1. Grilled Tomahawk: This is a MUST!!! DELICIOUS!!! Note: Takes about an hour to prepare.2. Farro Reginetti Pasta3. Rigatoni Alla Vodka PastaDESSERTS: We tried almost everything and while they were great, this is one of those places where I'd err towards the side of savory over sweet if you have to budget how much you plan to eat. If not, try these:1. Coconut & Caviar.2. Eggplant dessert. This was very unique so worth a try if you are an eggplant fan.Icing on the cake: Chef Aaron Silverman was there today and sits down with us and shares his Mission Statement with us: \"I want this to be the most enjoyable place to eat and the most enjoyable place to work\"Last note: Have to give a HUGE shout-out to our server: Angelina. She was very knowledgeable about the menu & the service was EXCELLENT :)"}, {"review_id": "b58HA8woU_355ItkHQqaHw", "user_id": "mDBAmEsyxuVTTT70dK-dqA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "BEST MEAL IN DC.

We sat at the bar upstairs, and had a selection of foods. I started with the scotch earl grey cocktail served in a tea cup. We were then served biscuits, so really it felt like an adult tea party, and I loved it. We then had the caviar on coconut ice cream, NOMS, you get salty and sweet, it was a great app. I ordered the oyster granata next, it was super spicy but you get that sea salt brine from the oyster, so it was delicious. We also had the cauliflower salad, which was smoked with some harissa, it was the perfect flavor with my scotch. The house also brought out the grilled cucumber for us to try, which was surprisingly packed with flavor, it was unexpected and welcome. We then ended with the stuffed gnocchi, and the mushroom with the sherry, and blue cheese... well... we inhaled it...Overall, worth the wait.

I was 2nd in line. They open at 5pm. The person in front of me owns a biz where she waits in line for people. Like that's her job. We chatted it up. She told me when we get to hostess/host, there will be tons of seating options. The chef's counter is where it's at. I shared that with the people behind me and they chose it, too. Waiting in line wasn't too horrible. I didn't want to use any of my phone battery cause I wanted to save it for food pics and texting on the way home. I had a full day of museum-ing so I was packing light. Definitely bring a book or free newspaper, if you can. I basically people watched the entire time. Before the restaurant opens, someone will post the paper menu outside. That was the only time anyone left the line - to check it out.Seating was kind of a blur. I just remember them listing a ton of options, but it was kind of loud and chaotic, so I just said \"chef's counter.\"I loved chef's counter seating. You get to see all the dishes prepared so it is basically a choreographed show plus dinner. It's nice to sit there if you're by yourself, too, because it'll keep you very entertained.I got so much food you guys. Obscene level, from what I ordered to dishes the kitchen surprised me with. Before coming, I checked out pics online so I knew what I wanted: pasta with black truffles and the lychee salad. And all the desserts. I was bummed cause the black truffle pasta wasn't on the paper menu posted outside. My waitress greeted me and told me about specials verbally and surprise surprise: the black truffles are a special, so I was like \"that!\" I told her I had not seen it printed, so I WAS going to get the pasta with garlic because I'm obsessed with garlic. (Later they brought me a taster of the garlic pasta to surprise me. How sweet!)While I was waiting for my first dishes, they gave me sourdough crumpets with clotted cream and jam. At least I think they were crumpets. It's hard for me to hear when there's a lot of background noise, so I really depend on paper menus, etc, but this wasn't on the menu. Anyways, carbs. It was so good. I didn't even slice it open or tear it off or eat it politely. I just put all the clotted cream on and a bit of jam and ate it. SO GOOD. One of my favorite moments. I ordered the lychee salad because it sounded exotic and I'm pretty sure it's one of their signature dishes. It was picture perfect and tasted bright and unique. It has a beautiful presentation, but they'll tell you to mess it up and eat it messy. There are lots of different flavors in this one so every bite is different and surprising. This dish is definitely a star. It was one of my favorites. This I would get again and again and again. I've never had black truffles so that was a rich treat. It looked pretty and it was fun to have once. I probably won't get it again though. I want to explore the rest of the menu. Next time I'll get something with a red sauce.I love love love desserts, so I ordered the viet creme brulee and the coconut milk ice cream with burnt coconut and kiwi. I asked for the creme brulee to come out first and alone. Creme brulee is my favorite dessert and I love vietnamese coffee so very much. I was so excited to order this. There was something about this I didn't love-love though. I think if you're telling me it's viet coffee, the coffee taste has to be extreme to the max, which it was not. But if you had told me it was just regular coffee creme brulee, I probably wouldn't have been disappointed. I also feel like it needed a thicker caramelized topping. Now things get weird with my second dessert because I don't just get what I ordered but I get surprised with all the desserts. So I got presented with: coconut milk ice cream topped with caviar, winter citrus tiramisu, and what I ordered: the coconut milk ice cream with burnt coconut and kiwi. I ate the hashtag, #caviar first obvi. I loved it! Coconut is one of my favorite flavors and the mix of cream and sweet and salt are amazing. Now, at this point I am so full, so I tried my best with the other ice cream dessert and asked to take home my tiramisu. I did have the tiramisu the next day and it was the best tiramisu I've ever had.I definitely recommend: lychee salad, any and all of their ice creams, and the tiramisu. The service was freaking spectacular. They did a great job with making me feel special. This review is getting too long, but I could write a book on the customer service and it would all be positive stuff. The staff is definitely amazing here. It was a totally fun dinner! I'll be back for lychee salad and desserts!And crumpets! Or whatever they were... :)"}, {"review_id": "Y6ALp9qEvhAY3rrUwRTS5g", "user_id": "I2bn8Zn6yr83omxoC6_Abg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "I've passed by Rose's dozens of times and seen the long, forlorn lines outside.

I made reservation at 5pm and there was a line when I arrived on a Thursday night. The inside was adorable and nice. Different parts of the restaurant has different features. I sat at the kitchen table. There were a total of eight seats. The good thing is you can see how they prepare each dish. We ordered the following:- lychee salad: I had very high hopes for this dish due to all the reviews. It was definitely innovative and I love the flavor of greens/herbs, but did not give me a \"wow\" - spare ribs: very nicely done - truffle pasta: too salty - whole grilled fish: deboned, so good! I wish they serve this earlier as I am already full after one bite. Some parts are still very salty, compared with other parts, uneven saltingI was disappointed in a couple of things: - After seated, we waited for 20min until our waiter came over. I was very upset. - The chair I sat on (the first one in the row of kitchen tables) was very unstable compared with the rest ones- Our waiter did not check in with us frequently. He checked in with us twice throughout the meal, one after the spare rib, the other after the pasta - The truffle pasta was really salty. Though our waiter said he could ask for a new one but we were already 80% done They did pay attention to water as or water was never half full. I will come back as I still have a gift card but this first time did not make a perfect impression on me, maybe because my expectation was too high.

Pork & Lychee Salad $15 - Overy hyped. Was highly recommended by the waiters. I appreciated all the textures but the flavors was just mediocre.Shrimp Toast $14 - A piece of toast with shrimp and chives.Trenette with Clams $16 - RECOMMEND! This was delicious. The flavors were great and the pasta was perfectly cooked.Whole Dorade $36 - This is an entire fish. It was very tasty. I was just disappointed that it came out last, therefore I was too full to enjoy it in its entirety.Drinks: Tequila/Jalapeno $14, Green tea vodka $14 - interesting flavorsService: Friendly, but very very slow. We were quoted 7:30-8:30p so we showed up at 8pm, but were not seated until close to 9p. Even though we were sitting at the chefs table, getting something took a while.Parking: Metered street parking.Honestly, this was certainly something I had to try coming to DC, but it barely met my expectations.

We were given the option to be seated right away or we can come back at another time. We wanted to be seated right away. Beautiful restaurant without feeling to pretentious. We were seat in the back on the first floor. It was a beautifully lit area. There are greens, natural lighting, string lights, and nice settings.  I would like to one day sit in front of the chefs.I recommend sharing food, because it is a great way to try everything and the plates are pretty large. First thing and only I would highly recommend is Pork Sausage , Habanero & Lychee Salad!!! It may sound weird and strange, but it is an extraordinary and flavorful dish. All the components melded so well but was so distinguishable. It is also a very ascetically colorful dish with the cream, onions, and greens. The do change their menu but this is one that they don't often change. One of the special dish we got was the lobster ceviche which was phenomenal. We also order katsu, carbonara, and a delish shrimp dish. A quick tip, the Katsu/Japanese Fried Chicken is a huge dish! Be nice and share!Also, do not forget the cocktails! We ordered a Hurricane Irma relief cocktail and it tasted was amazing, but I won't doubt the other cocktails to be just as amazing. I MUST go back! I NEED to go back!

This isn't your typical snobby fancy restaurant where you need to wait an hour for you food either, we probably waited only a max of 20 minutes for our plates to come out.

We started of course with the twisted rye bread, which was delicious. The flavor of star anise is a bit strong, so if you're not a fan that could be off putting. We also got the lychee salad. It has an excellent flavor profile and benefits from stirring it all up. I love lychees so I was super pleased. We then share the special which was a long noodle pasta in a butter cream sauce with fresh shaved truffles and the Japanese chicken. Overall, both dishes were very good, but totally not mind blowing.
