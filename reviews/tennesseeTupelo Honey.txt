Myself and two friends came in for Brunch on a Sunday morning before our drive back to Cincinnati and were absolutely starving. Although the restaurant was busy the host easily found us seating and set us up with some complimentary biscuits with jam and butter. Can I just say- yum! They were soft and still warm from the oven. I almost filled up on them!The menu looked so good that we wanted to try a few different dishes. To start we had the Avocado Toast Points and the Pecan Pie French Toast. Avo Toast was pretty damn good and the serving size was perfect for an appetiser between the three of us, I also loved the French Toast. I usually don't like sweet things but this was delectable! For my Main, myself and my boyfriend ordered the Southern Shakshuka bowl. I had no idea what to expect but it was really tasty and very filling. We were able to save some to take home and eat the next day for breakfast!If you are coming here, definitely try and Mimosa with your brunch. They fresh squeeze the orange juice and there was pulp in mine which I loved, they even super size them if you ask.Really loved this restaurant and I wish I had a reason to come back to Knoxville just so I could eat here again!"}, {"review_id": "Jy1GsYsNv8CDX4TFEBAMkg", "user_id": "qVud-u8ImIgJ1hOg_HoKmg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "This was another great dining experience at Tupelo Honey.

However, the last time we went the prices had gone up and the food was blah. The biscuits that they serve were hard as bricks. The food was bland, overcooked and to be honest I have had better. It didn't used to be like this. My husband and both agreed we will not be back."}, {"review_id": "NJsoGzIDOWh954mRq7ekbg", "user_id": "zQTEbn5nWGPypxOf2uRPmg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "I'm torn on how to rate this place. Over all, our experience wasn't too great. This place was packed, we had a wait, it was noisy, our server was hard to find and two out of the three dishes we tried were disappointing. But the one dish we did like, we liked so much that we would definitely go back! The Ribs with Blackberry BBQ Sauce were fantastic!! The meat was very tender and the sauce had the most deliciously unique flavor! There was a little too much off this sauce on the ribs for my taste, but the fries that came as the side were the perfect vehicle to mop it up. We also tried the Pimento Nachos and the Tacos. I thought the fried chicken taco was fine and the BBQ pork taco was a little better. The Nachos were more disappointing because we felt there was barely any pimento cheese on top. In fact, I asked for extra because we ended up with so many naked chips. This extra pimento that comes in quite a small container will cost you $1. At least the biscuits they start you with are complimentary. And you can request butter to go with them at no charge! The blackberry jam they're served with is light, full of actual berries and not overly sweet.I definitely would never visit again on a Saturday night. Dining when things are that busy just isn't our thing. Especially when it seems to have such a hugely negative impact on the service. Our server was frequently was hard to find. Thank goodness the food still came out quick. I would love to return on a week day for lunch when things are less crazy. And maybe simply having another server would solve some problems."}, {"review_id": "sK2zS2meI9cwtWltgcRjAQ", "user_id": "L3uDaUhLFmLqCfoYg7rQ_g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "3= service, cleanness, location.Stopped by for lunch and we were seated immediately. Tupelo is conveniently located in the heart of market place. Stopped by here for quick lunch and we were seated right away. I loved the service (experienced the real southern hospitality) and how often our server checked up on us. The restaurant was clean which is a plus. We order the fried green tomatoes which was highly recommended by other yelpers. It had an interesting/acquired taste. I do not recommend the gumbo. The chicken sandwich and the southern chicken sandwiches were good. Their special lavender fizz iced tea was good but very sweet."}, {"review_id": "IGb9IExXPWGzMKC3kBIXVQ", "user_id": "_CB1KhsRDJFF21XTxP43dw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "Solid 4 star restaurant.  Service was fast....really fast and good! They refilled my water multiple times.  Food was hit or miss....  I love that they gave us complimentary biscuits, that were fresh and warm.  The avocado toast was subpar (I am from LA, that land of Avocado Toast).  The Steak was FANTASTIC!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!Let down...the $20 steak salad.  Great dressing/flavor....ONLY 4 pieces of meat.....really? 4 effing pieces? Not thick pieces, tiny thin pieces.  Definitely worth a go, just don't order the salad and expect to be satisfied."}, {"review_id": "An-1NZfXt1D6yyvZK2MJ0A", "user_id": "DTZu_5aL69W0AJtPS_UK5Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "Tupelo Honey has made a name for itself in Tennessee for their famous biscuits..and now I can see why! The only complaints I have is that the sandwiches we ordered had minimal filling inside. In addition, the filling was just plopped in the middle which meant we had to eat several bites of just plain bread before getting to any of the good stuff. For a bread sandwich, the price seemed a little hefty. Fortunately, their greens and fries made up for the lackluster sandwiches. Overall, their menu is definitely interesting, but the  execution isn't so great."}, {"review_id": "kXH2jpTluZWITsVbxjCiFA", "user_id": "kl_U6BarLWuCqRjKnHBW6w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "After some deliberation among the 4 of us, we settled on Tupelo for lunch. The pineapple tiki bomb for two is what drew us in but sadly after we were seated we found that to be out of stock. Of course, this was the day after St. Patty's so I can't really fault them on it. They offered to make the drink anyway just out of a glass instead of a pineapple but we opted out. Not worth it at that price (in general, really, but the experience is what we were after)We did get a white sangria that had a great taste. Really light and refreshing. The margarita was similar in its refreshment. Light lime, almost sweet rather than sour or alcohol-bite-y... Yeah, we'll go with that. But, it was good and I was a fan.I got the tacos, one pork and one chicken. The chicken was dry, could definitely have used a sauce of some sort. The pork was awesome though. Great savoryness with a nice sauce. My wife got the avocado toast points which were great. Super puffy and lightly toasted with a nice avocado mix layered on top. We also got an order of biscuits which were nice and southern style thick and fresh. Definitely better with the berry compote (which had some full sized berries inside). We also got the mason jar desserts with banana pudding, berry and sage, strawberry cake, and peanut butter and chocolate ganache. The banana pudding was excellent. Light and creamy. The berry and sage had a nice sweetness and tasted very fresh. The strawberry cake had a gentle taste but was dense. Like so thick it was hard to get a little spoonful of it. Finally, the peanut butter was just a tad too sweet with a nice creamy taste. Overall, it was decent. Located with a lot of other possibly great places to eat so I think I would give another glance around before jumping in again. Although, the other place we ate it (Myrtle's) was just okay so maybe the competition isn't as tough as I expected for so many places being jam packed there."}, {"review_id": "ZJbRf2jeqJSVqyC3W6Keeg", "user_id": "W1X-wKcKWM7n-5ejgW8W6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "The wife and I decided to give Tupelo Honey a try since we were already in Market Square on a Friday night and so glad we did.We made a reservation through Open Table since we knew they would be busy and were seated immediately when we arrived. Our server came over quickly and was very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. The wife ordered the shrimp and grits and I ordered the buttermilk chicken with mac and cheese and green beans. Each of us ordered the sweet tea (the official drink of the South.)Let's start with the tea, both of us agreed this was some of the best sweet tea we have had. It was perfectly brewed and sweetened to perfection. The wife loved the shrimp and grits stating the shrimp wasn't overcooked and the grits were very soft and tender. She did not opt for the chorizo but said she would definitely try it next time. My chicken was tender and fried to perfection with the mac and cheese being creamy and not over cooked. I was not a fan of the green beans as they didn't have much seasoning.Do yourself a favor and stop and give it a try."}, {"review_id": "DOx37gKGpDRORYcPj2JCRA", "user_id": "EycZjJS9DH2wNNPa3wbGIQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "OK people go here and eat.

My mother had the Fried Chicken, wasn't very moist (hahaha, moist), and didn't like it very much.We decided not to order anything else, since we didn't care for our entrees.Oh and the biscuits were more like spoon biscuits and tasted of nothing. The jam they came with was nothing to get excited about either, nor was the tupelo honey served with the \"biscuits\". The honey did NOT taste like tupelo, just regular supermarket  u can get for $4 at Walmart.

I don't eat pork chops or pork meat like that so I can't tell you how it taste, but she enjoyed it.  The had good bacon on the chicken sandwich and it was good.I didn't add pictures of the trip in Knoxville TN, but I will post photos going forward.Trust me the food is good and the staff is really nice.
