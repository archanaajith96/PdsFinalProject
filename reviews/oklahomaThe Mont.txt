Yup.Don't take the food here too seriously -- it's bar & grill stuff, but generally very good for what it is.We love the Club Sandwich here, and have had a few of the salads on the menu. (We keep going back to the Club, though. It's always a good stand-by.)I can't imagine coming here without eating outside on the patio. (Yeah, yeah, the interior's fine. I just associate this restaurant/bar with outdoor seating and thus tend to come here in spring, summer, or fall. Weird.)I hear The Cubano here is good, and hope to try it next time I pop in while I'm in Cleveland County."}, {"review_id": "b3vddaLCWIU6feUXkt5HEg", "user_id": "GqJzZau0aejBow8z7ess7g", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Loaded cheese fries gave me food poisoning on 5/6/2018.

The food is great, and like most college towns is very affordable. But you come back for the swirls every time. Best and first swirls in Oklahoma. We were there last night after then OU v. WV game, and even though they were slammed, the service was phenomenal. If you haven't been in a while, give the Mont another try. It's a lot like going home again!"}, {"review_id": "R6MnayWbPwrEmaiP1u2lLA", "user_id": "ts3PXAL80WgUNlsVGOkR4Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "Walked into The Mont and immediately fell in love with the ambiance. There's a fireplace on the far wall and couch seating in one of the corners. On the walls there's scores from every OU football game from every year. Very cool. I didn't go into the bar area or order any drinks and I think I would've been more impressed if that were the case. I was disappointed in the food. We had the fried mushrooms and a grilled chicken sandwich. My boyfriend loved everything and I just left feeling like I wasted calories on a subpar meal. Like a lot of other reviews said, go for the ambiance and the drinks!"}, {"review_id": "ENqn_LnnFkLVU_M4xZX01A", "user_id": "cVBG-OvjCFzf3PLbL0eLfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/23/2017", "text": "First time visiting. Won't be our last. Very awesome atmosphere. Great food. The menu has some very interesting choices. Can't beat being outside under the cover with misting fans either! We sat inside. Manager changed tv to the royals game!!!! Added gratuity for the gesture. The food we split was the Cuban  sandwich....yumm!  We also ordered queso for the  table to share and the salsa really had some great reviews. Overall we can say great service, indoor or outdoor you chose! Great hangout place too chill and relax. Order a sooner swirl if you dare to!We had a great time.

We got a table quickly outside even though there was still an OU game on. Absolutely love the ambiance of this place. Large patio, TVs, fire to warm you up a bit on colder nights, and amazing servers that don't miss a beat even when it's packed. Enjoyed queso and chips (it was good, nothing to write home about) and fried chicken sandwich (again it was good...it was a fried chicken sandwich) but the Swirls oh my goodness the swirls. PERFECT.

After working up an appetite from cheering on the team, we decided to hit up The Mont.I had the Blue Plate Special with chicken tenders, mashed potatoes with gravy, green beans and Texas toast. The food arrived to our table quickly and tasted great. The price was $8.99 which was reasonable.I liked the old-world feel of the interior. I can't wait to go back when it is warmer to check out the outside seating area. Lastly, they're known for their swirl drinks so if it's your first time here you have to try one."}, {"review_id": "HBJgVGK3xYx22QDy4-z3yQ", "user_id": "nJ1WUaxa6BZnyEWy13KZnA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "Nachos made with actual \"cheese\" and not just chips with queso pored over them.

I ordered two appetizers some onion rings which were ok and guacamole appetizer. While they did give me quite an amount the taste was a little off it needed either more lemon or salt which I did go ahead and add more off. I ordered a cheeseburger and fries and that was more than enough for what I needed. I got full pretty quick. The inside if there were loads of people would be very packed the booths were crammed it there were bigger people trying to have a seat in there it would be impossible hence the seating in tables which they did have. They had outdoor seating with mystifiers which I thought was awesome idea but it was too hot for me to even think of eating outside. The dark inside kept it cool. The staff and waitresses were very attentive and kind"}, {"review_id": "aL36o88p0r28bEiCNcgQBQ", "user_id": "Z5j9Xw_G0c7M2b1-iS67wg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/24/2017", "text": "I was on my way to another restaurant but the patio here caught my eye so I stopped in.

The food was delicious and served in a timely fashion. I also enjoyed that on this night specifically we were able to seat ourselves which is nice if you enjoy some elbow room at the table. The margaritas were nicely made and the overall decor of the place was really inviting and appropriately holiday themed! I only wish they had a vegitarian section on their menu as well as a non meat queso alternative because although I was easily able to throw down on any menu item my vegetarian girlfriend was only able to find a single entré that was meat optional without the premium of actually paying for a meat meal then removing it.

If you are ever in the Norman area, it's a must! Their food is pretty good, but everyone goes for the swirls. Their patio is wonderful, and there is nothing more relaxing than hanging out with friends on a sunny day drinking swirls and eating chips on their patio. They also have a neat cube-room for large parties as well, that we always try to book. The bottom line - the Mont is pure happiness.

It's delicious and surprisingly strong (so beware ).  Their Mexican specialties are my favorite food item (and come with chips and salsa for the table as an added bonus). I recommend the green chile burrito.  The patio is great. It can be a bit loud but on a nice day, it can't be beat.
