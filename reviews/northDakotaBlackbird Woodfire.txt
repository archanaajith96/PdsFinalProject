They have such a creative menu, and the wild mushroom pizza is what I always go for. Everything is home made, super fresh and tasty. Ive never had to wait for a table for dinner.Service wise the team is super friendly, especially Nicole who is awesome & always tries to have my party try new things! The only thing that could be improved is to have real glasses for wine (not water glasses..)"}, {"review_id": "9ADJEU99Q7g8uskeySBTzA", "user_id": "ND3aYsyweeLUIQTwN0Di5Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Great pizza!

We were seated immediately and had warm and friendly service. Our server offered some recommendations and indicated that the larger size pizza feeds 1-2 people.  So the pizzas aren't huge.  We decided on the lumberjack. Ohhhh that was gooood! It was almost like a fancy breakfast pizza - maple syrup, bacon, Canadian bacon, fried eggs. The menu offerings weren't terribly abundant (but still plenty) and many of the pizzas had a bechamel white cream sauce vs the traditional tomato based sauce.  I prefer the white sauce so I didn't mind one bit. I believe you can create your own pizza too (with red sauce).  They had a handful of craft beers on tap. Not a ton but the choices seemed to cover most preferences. There were a couple of other pizzas that sounded good so I'm looking forward to my next visit. Prices seemed reasonable for the quality of food you get."}, {"review_id": "Z4ClXgYo3pp0h_t0MJrnEw", "user_id": "SE8AdxJRBKx9aw7IyrMYQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "This is the closest to Napoli pizza you will get in Fargo, which is a compliment!

This place is definitely striving for that and hitting a lot of good ideas and missing at some.  We got two pizzas the granny apple, sausage and cream one and then also the fresh greens, balsamic, tomato, bacon, BLT inspired one.  Out of the two the BLT one was much better but still didn't really meet my expectations for such an expensive pizza.Our favorite part of the meal was probably the strawberry shortcake dessert.  It was really well made - moist, great flavors, fresh - and it hit the spot but wasn't too sweet."}, {"review_id": "iDajjfhISe2YZt3bynRaOQ", "user_id": "FVlkocRlMwrHCOv1u1ZEZQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Advertise a gluten free pizza pot but then tell you there is a lot of cross contamination. Feels like a bait and switch. Could put more effort into it. The pots were very small and not much in them for $10. Regular pizza was very good however and the downtown atmosphere was cool. $53 for 3 with one draft beer. About average I suppose"}, {"review_id": "FRPgSy1exnjrl3iYenSIwQ", "user_id": "4MQMG_6fociYH881cERzHg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/25/2016", "text": "Great find in Fargo.

The crust was delicious, the  toppings were fresh and the pizza was cooked well.
