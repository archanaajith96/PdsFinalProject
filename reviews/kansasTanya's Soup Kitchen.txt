Came here on the recommendation of a colleague - apparently it's a Wichita institution. Really unimposing atmosphere, nice music, nice staff. Came here midweek at 1:30 for late lunch and it was packed! Great place for a comfort bowl of soup and a side sandwich or salad. I got the butternut squash bisque (medium) and a side of potato salad and was stuffed. Both were really good, and I'm very particular about butternut squash soup AND potato salad. I was going to snap a pic but both were too good to stop for the photo opp. Lots of parking in the back too which is a huge plus (again probably just of note for someone who's used to DC parking)."}, {"review_id": "wB5A3Uo4E-_MXE5vZKDRfg", "user_id": "EbUxjXd1Y3-ywUXoOPuoKQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This place is awesome!

When traveling for business it's great to find a local restaurant with hot comforting soups fresh salads and distinct sandwiches. The tomato basil bisque has the perfect ratio of cream to tomato. There's no thickener or carrageenan texture. You can tell it's made in house without additives. It's topped with a generous portion of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Mouthwateringly good. My favorite comfort food. The poor man's vegetable stew is hearty and healthy. It has chunky carrots and onions and peas and celery and potatoes and herbs. Topped with fresh chives. Incredibly tasty and filling. As their menu states the soups are \"made with love everyday\". They have 4 soups on the menu daily. One day I did arrive at 1:30 and 2 of the soups were sold out. Be sure to get there early if you want to have all the choices. The salad dressings are also made by the restaurant. The creamy herb is thick and rich in flavor. It will give a kick to any of the salads. The Gorgonzola is chunky but light in flavor. Both are great unique options.They also have a great selection of original sandwiches. I tried the Croquadille. Cheddar, Swiss, and Parmesan on a ciabatta with mustard and red onions. Cheesy deliciousness. The ciabatta was proportionate to all the cheese and the mustard and red onions gave it a twangy twist. I dipped it in my tomato bisque of course."}, {"review_id": "gh434CGuvgBo00ejN80wVQ", "user_id": "fdqkTVXVfUNSKoFbyHOBAQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "YES YES YES!!!

I always joke around and ask why is it a soup kitchen when the food isn't free. I became a tomato bisque addict after trying it for the first time last year at a charity event. It's too bad that I didn't visit when Tanya was still alive. Believe it or not, but I knew her long ago without realizing she was THE Tanya from Tanya's Soup Kitchen! Anyway, I've tried other stuff such as the curry and enjoyed them all. My favorite, still, is the tomato bisque. Probably the best tomato bisque in the world. I always think about it on rainy days and perhaps every morning when I wake up during the winter months. It makes me sad that their menu changes daily so sometimes you don't get what you want (so call ahead). Nevertheless, their options never disappoint. The restaurant is always packed during lunchtime so I usually get takeout. A sandwich, tomato bisque and a TV show = a good day."}, {"review_id": "Q5kXhYhTYy08CHGlv9qLOQ", "user_id": "Sep9cq9Qdvg6w7i6stuapg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/4/2017", "text": "Soups of all sorts!!!

I've been eating here since day one and have nothing negative to say. The sandwiches are always consistent and on point, and the soup never disappoints. Of course I have my favorites, but I always i'm game to try something new. Some of the cold fruit soups have been on the top of my list... they are perfectly sweet and savory so as not to be too much like a smoothie. One of the best things about the place is the communal/European seating at some of the tables... Almost forces you to meet a new neighbor!

I will definitely be back to try other items and specials.Service was good. Food is a bit pricey. This restaurant gets packed quick and indoor seating is limited.

I'd had always had this local spot on my list of places to try but because I'm not exactly a sandwich and soup kind of girl I had put it off in favor of something a little more hearty. So finally I decided that I needed to give it a shot.I ordered the caprese sandwich with a side of pasta salad. My BF ordered the club sandwich with a side of curry tomato bisque soup. Everything was incredible. The caprese sandwich was fantasic, the tomatoes were fresh, the lettuce was crisp, the mozzarella was prefect, it was incredible. The curry tomato bisque was some of the best I've ever had.
