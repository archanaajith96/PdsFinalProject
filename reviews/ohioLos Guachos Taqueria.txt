Nothing really comes close, and I try to get away with driving somewhere closer to my place downtown to get my Mexican fix, but I'm disappointed every time because I'm never satisfied like I am when I come to Los Guachos. Now, it's not gonna be anything close to the type of tacos you get if you're a LA transplant like me, but I love los Guachos for everything it is, and I would encourage you to profess your love to them to! They deserve it!Also- 0.75 el pastor tacos Mondays after 4pm. And get the Horchata. Trust me."}, {"review_id": "2w1n6UZoBaeEhwGWFR0LCw", "user_id": "7RReTSfunwRcuUiCjmOwEQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "I've been trying to come here for foreverrrr and we finally got to try it out this week!! All of my friends rave about this little place, and I can definitely see why.-Food: we ordered the al pastor, fish, and beef brisket tacos, chips and guacamole. These are some of yummiest tacos that I've had here in Columbus! I highly recommend the al pastor and fish tacos. They're so small but packed with SO much flavor! I also loved the sauce that came with the fish tacos, it had a spicy kick to it. The chips and guac were average.. I probably wouldn't order them again. But it's ok, because instead of stuffing myself with chips, I can get more tacos :)-Pricing: the pricing for everything on the menu is great! Next time I'll be sure to come when the have buy one get one al pastor tacos.-Seating: one of the most annoying things about restaurants is when they don't offer enough seating. Luckily, Los Guachos has plenty of seating!-Staff: the staff was mostly pleasant. They seemed kind of impatient with us when we were trying to decide what we wanted... there wasn't even a line behind us. After taking a minute to browse the menu, it took them a while to come back to the register to take our order.Overall, the tacos were so delicious that I didn't care about the service. I will most definitely be back for more!"}, {"review_id": "7dfk5OndLjOijXqMuBJNPw", "user_id": "tAzLKx149KlaAEEnCYaHzg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Hands down, the best mexican spot in Columbus, and quite possibly the best mexican food i've ever had. This place just does it right. There's probably not much I can say about los Guachos that has not already been said.As far as the ambiance goes, it is humbly decorated with a traditional and authentic appearance. I am a big fan of the oversized wooden chairs.The food is outstanding. You MUST try the al pastor tacos. I have never seen such a beautiful rotisserie pork in my life. the pineapple in the taco just brings it over the edge for me. I have tried their burritos and they are also excellent.The prices are fantastic and they have regular deals during the week such as half priced tacos and $2 Gringas.If you haven't tried los guachos yet and live in the area, you must go, NOW"}, {"review_id": "12iLQhnBenr7oIXgLQ2plg", "user_id": "bO7SaBKym00SMhzlqky5xA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "Visited here passing through town the other day based on a friend's recommendation who is an even bigger proper taco fiend than me.  Boy am I glad I did!  They have a sign outside of their restaurant (little spot in a little strip mall) claiming they serve the best al pastor tacos in the city.  Well, they are the best I have ever had!  They have both the pineapple and pork in the rotisserie as they shave off of it for whatever item you ordered.  I ordered two al pastor tacos ($2 each) and then a gringa which is one of their signature and popular items.  It's basically a bigger taco on a grilled/crispy flour tortilla instead of corn with the tacos.  They pile the pork onto these.  Topped with onions and cilantro.  They also have at the tables big bowls of lime wedges and this dynamite red onion/habanero mixture (HOT) for you to add to your meals if you want.  The green and red salsas at the table in squeeze bottles were outstanding.  The red one is HOT!  I love hibiscus punch/water (jamaica) and they make that also.  Staff is really nice and attentive.  Inside the place has like a little modern yet rustic feel to it.  Cannot wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "Bhb9tcY5Q6ASBWXL7dtZkw", "user_id": "0l3oz_xOFR4Itpc4ahMFWQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "This has always been one of my favorite taco spots, especially because you can't beat their deals. Came for $2 gringas (al pastor on flour tortillas) on Wednesday. Got 2 gringas and a steak taco (also $2) and an horchata. For those of you who don't know, horchata is like a milky drink with spices like cinnamon and vanilla (kind of like a chai almost) and it's amazing. Usually the service is AMAZING but when ordering, the lady at the register seemed to be a little snappy or just annoyed and in a rush (although it was not as busy as usual). But the food made up for it.  The al pastor was amazing as usual. I really love the flour tortilla because it's softer, smoother, and overall you feel like you're getting more food. The steak was also good, very flavorful. The only thing is I wis I would've also gotten a fish taco. Not because I wasn't full, because I WAS, but because their fish tacos are just that good. One of my favorite things about this place is how each table has sauces, limes, and a bowl of pickled peppers and onions. My friend always picks around the habaneros but I welcome them. The pickled onions and peppers add a nice crunch and sweetness while the lime adds that acidity. Writing this review has made my mouth water just thinking about their food. Make sure to head over and grab some! (2 for 1 Al Pastors on Monday's and $2 gringas on Wednesday's!)"}, {"review_id": "62rjFy8QTU6WCGFWmN_zsg", "user_id": "m6uTA5-qbW6OSm3Hy7vlKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "This is the 2nd or 3rd time we've been here.  The great surprise today was that they extended the seating area so there's a lot more seats!  In the past you had to hang around & wait for people to leave.  Today we branched out & ordered nachos with el Pastor (seasoned pork from a big rotisserie).  The nachos were amazing!  Topped with el Pastor, melted cheese, pico de Gallo, beans and pineapple it was big enough for the 5 of us to share (the 8 year old ate this as her meal & the rest of us nibbled on it).  Also had a el Pastor torta, a burrito and tacos.  So fresh & made to order.  Definitely a must try!"}, {"review_id": "piyGyfpmvXv_7fs6iLIJKg", "user_id": "WuyPGkpYLKAdyqOfzV_R1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "Los Gauchos is one of my favorite taco places in Columbus.

It's better than Haas Taqueria on Sawmill. ITS SO GOOD! I love that there are spicy jalapeños and onions at each table to throw on if desired.

Sorry if I'm breaking authenticity rules... IM A FLOUR GAL.Tacos are cheap here and small. I can usually only eat two Condados tacos but here I can scarf down at least 5-6. Come for the Tuesday deal, which is two for $1!

This place wouldn't survive in any major city in the U.S. and it shouldn't be the gold standard in Columbus.The al pastor is the most over-rated pork imaginable. Thinly shaved and lacking any real flavor from either the pork or the pineapple roasting on top of the source and dripping down on the pork. Admittedly most of the best al pastor I've had has been set up the same in taqueria's but this just tasted inferior. And the gringas taco that they add some cheese and the smallest thinnest slice of pineapple I've ever seen then charge you an extra $2 to make it $4 (regular al pastor being $2) is comical. The fish taco the lady at the register said I had to order was simply un-eatable. After growing up on proper baja tacos from the west coast this was nothing more then a fish stick with some shitty sauce and lettuce. The lengua didn't taste braised at all, it wasn't soft and tender like lengua should be, disappointing."}, {"review_id": "kKPKSBEe1WNY4lIr2yAsxA", "user_id": "r5WO8TRsKL5N3A09JSsgRg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/15/2017", "text": "Solid experience at Los Guachos, but nothing that blew me out of the aqua. I'd like to preface this with the fact that I lic pretty close to Mexico in Texas and I grew up pretty close to Ohio in West Virginia. I know southern Mexican food and I know that Mexican tastes like in the North East. This place is a combination of those two things. It's pretty authentic, but also American. You order at a register and have a lot to choose from. They have multiple tacos, quesadillas, tortas, and more. Everything is cooked to order which is the highlight of this restaurant. Food comes fast, but they take no note of when you order. You're food will come up as soon as it is done. There's not a lot left to customer service, but it's not unfriendly. There are condiments on the table including peppers and onions. That might have been my favorite quality in this place. How cool is that? I ordered chips and salsa and it was so cheap. Another win. Overall the food was good and hit a spot. I've had better everything, but this is a solid joint that you'll like."}, {"review_id": "nMSQS-muPizSY0_1ZfUwjA", "user_id": "ygXBRI8hDcIkI82rr8rSbA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/10/2017", "text": "3.5-4 stars:After coming back from the zoo, my friends and I stopped by to grab a quick bite. The place wasn't too crowded, had a wide variety, and the service was friendly and efficient. I ordered two grilled fish tacos and they were well, fine. Maybe I'm just not experienced in Mexican food to determine super good, but I would say they are above chipotle (if that means anything).

I am not a pork eater. My husband is a pork eater. He raved about the Pastor tacos and said that is the only thing he would order here again. I, however, don't eat pork and was thoroughly disappointed with the chicken tacos and torta. There is zero seasoning on the chicken - NONE. The torta and the tacos both lacked serious flavor and were so bad I couldn't finish them. We also got the guacamole which was good but beware it has jalapenos in it and I don't recall seeing that on the menu. I'm a fan of a little spice but the amount in the guac was overkill. The horchata drink is delicious. I really enjoyed it and the cup size was generous. Also, there is a bowl of an onion/pepper mix on every table and it is SUPER spicy. There really should be a warning label on it because I just thought it was a random fajita veggie mix and loaded my taco up. I had to rush to the counter to get more water because my mouth was on fire. Just looking at it, you can't tell its spicy. I won't be back here because I wasn't impressed with the chicken but my husband said he would love to get the pastor tacos again."}, {"review_id": "6pykhPCgf08TKkUQeH9V8A", "user_id": "hL5LNWR7PIAkQkSgpNxA2w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "Los Guachos is hands down my favorite restaurant in the greater Columbus area. Though their renown Al Pastor taco singlehandedly justifies your visit, the thing that continues to impress me is the variety of other affordable and delicious dishes that Los Guachos has available for customers whenever they're feeling something different. Some of my personal favorites are:Fried Fish Tacos ($2.50) - eat them first, while they're still crispy and hot!Que Me Vez (~$10) - al pastor meat sautéed with fajitas on a huge plate, with a stack of your choice of flour or corn tortillas; a good and cheaper alternative to the al pastor when you're not there for the BOGO special on Mondays. Tripe Tacos ($2) - the amazing maillard chunks of intestines with its hit of umami flavor as you chew is amazing. If you can wrap your head around eating intestines, GET IT.Horchata Water ($2) - a beautiful sweet and milky beverage that contrasts and neutralizes the spicy habanero and hot salsa that you can put on your tacos. They unfortunately raised their menu prices by $0.50, but their previous affordability alongside their consistency in pulling out the best tacos in the Midwest, more than justifies the decision."}, {"review_id": "tMni-7WhlGlGjesOFP4W6Q", "user_id": "zN3kkIyZ8IhbZXawvnz6gw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "Really enjoyed the tacos and burritos here!

The one positive point about this review is that the al pastor pork was extremely tasty.  However, the lack of effort put into the beef brisket, chicken and overall presentation of the tacos and burritos that i ordered was dismal at best. Extreme disregard for detail of toppings on tacos led to overuse of cilantro and lack of pineapple as the board clearly states are all on the tacosI will note that the burrito that was ordered was modified. However, the fact that the chicken was dry, unseasoned and the shell itself was falling apart continues the trend of poor attention to detail leading me to believe this is the standard for the food here.Food took nearly 20 minutes to come out, and wasnt even hot. To-Go orders placed after mine were finished and given the customers before my order was completed.Perhaps this was a bad experience, but I wont be returning to determine that."}, {"review_id": "-SF-BebLi8BodsH_OZYStw", "user_id": "QGOtNZfasBwWCuawKjypYA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/24/2017", "text": "This is an excellent taco place!

It svery, very affordable. It's great for families. It's clearly a locale devoted to Mexican cuisine, not a \"Tex-Mex\" spot which I enjoy. The employees are hard working in everything from answering phones to taking and making orders. Best of all, I noticed that it was frequented by students as well as people that actually speak the language casually. A quality I always enjoy in an establishment is a type of cultural approval. I like an Italian restaurant frequented by Italians that speak Italian. It gives the environment a certain level of authenticity The negatives were small, and probabaly have more to do with me than the ownership. Example, they keep a bowl of limes on every table with tongs for people to grab at their leasure. I get that, but I loath seeing exposed food on a table ment for me to eat or use as a garnish lol. Surely we know not everyone is using the tongs lol. This place is sold though, and worth every penny. It also forces you to pace yourself, which we all need don't we lol."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/los-guachos-taqueria-columbus?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
