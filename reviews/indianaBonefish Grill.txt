We made a reservation weeks ago and arrived 10 minutes prior to our reservation for 7 people and we were seated 20 minutes past our reservation time. However we had excellent service and the meal as always was very good. I do wish they had round tables so it would be easier to visit in a large group and that our seated time was a little more prompt but overall I will be back. 43/4 stars is my accurate rating. Ty for making our celebration a nice memorable evening"}, {"review_id": "Lbdk8L95yeqmXgSbO8YYzQ", "user_id": "YaMynA-fw4qQAhSvoHx8GQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Big disappointment.  Our party of 2 stopped in for a late lunch.  They weren't busy at all.  There were only 3 or 4 tables with other patrons.  Service was incredibly SLOW, lackluster and unenthusiastic. Despite an almost empty dining room, it took almost 45 minutes for our meal to arrive.  No apology offered, just a bad attitude.  The \"wagyu\" beef hamburger was very dry and nothing special.  The chicken \"terriyaki\" was a joke.  It had NO terriyaki!  After delivering our food, we only saw our waitress once throughout the course of our meal and that was not to check on us or refill our drinks, rather she plopped down our check and tried to whisk our plates away before we were even done eating.  Overall, we expected better from Bonefish Grill.  We have many great dining choices in Evansville and in the future we won't waste our time or our money at Bonefish Grill."}, {"review_id": "KNe5hmF43n_Bvko7oWoKOw", "user_id": "1XULZKrWA8rLwHlvqCIs5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "I've been here a few times and never have they let me down.  This last outing was with my wife and it was a slow night for them; however, the server was fantastic and the food was amazing.  I had a perfectly cooked steak and some marvelous cocktail shrimp."}, {"review_id": "fwZcs5bbmO_zrVXwJ4x0zw", "user_id": "38TIMc9rr33MgvIodx0irQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/8/2017", "text": "Delicious food, great service, nice atmosphere.  I was with a group of 7 people, and our server did a great job getting everyone's food and drinks correct and out in a reasonable time.  I had the scallop special with mango and coconut sauce over jasmine rice with green beans.  The scallops were perfectly tender and the sauce was an excellent blend of sweet and spicy, but not too sweet or too spicy.  The portion size was just right. We shared bang bang shrimp, seared tuna, and fried coconut shrimp for appetizers, and they were all delicious.  This was my first time at the Evansville Bonefish; I have visited this chain at other cities.  I will be back the next time I need a good seafood fix!"}, {"review_id": "NLxPiar0c5qim8c9y_5a7g", "user_id": "OD3fC_rlUhKO3wb0AtQl0A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "Always great service.

We started off with an appetizer of bacon wrapped scallops (100/100 - I could eat a tub full), Cesar salad, and bread that they bring to the table. When we received our food, the portions looked smaller than what I was expecting.  I ordered the sirloin and crab cake with garlic whipped potatoes and French green beans. My mother ordered the tilapia imperial with jasmine rice and sautéed spinach.  While I said that the portions were small, I was so full after eating! The meat was amazing and the crab cake was divine! I ordered a beer on draft and a Hawaiian martini- which is DELICIOUS.  I could live off of them! We ordered a vanilla cream brûlée and a strawberry shortcake to go.  The CB was good for me never having one before, but the SSC was a sweet biscuit and a bowl of strawberries.  Mom wasn't impressed.Brad was our waiter and he was great, too!"}, {"review_id": "WqW1MMEGF-n4Z05_JmLtEQ", "user_id": "_4W9DX-7fVSENiPYgrCCCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/8/2017", "text": "Went here to celebrate my husband's birthday.

IE there was not very much of it.  I would think it was only about 1-cup worth of soup in that \"bowl\".  The spicy tuna bowl was ok.  The seasame coating on the outside of the tuna needed a little more searing as it seemed a little raw tasting.  The sriracha & thai chili sauce that was provided with the tuna was strange.  It just didn't seem to go well with the fish.  Might I suggest a wasabi aioli?Decent atmosphere, though at about 6:30 (on a weekday), it got real busy really fast!"}, {"review_id": "v9IZK1lGy4hwuT89SJIj_g", "user_id": "8saSWjTl6MkulBmt66R91g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2017", "text": "The best seafood in Evansville.

I was in Evansville for a couple of days and decided to see what Bonefish Grill offered based mostly on it's positive Yelp reviews. It didn't disappoint. It is in a large, slightly (but not exceptionally) upscale strip mall on the major expressway that runs across town. It was crowded and we were told to expect a 30 minute wait. However, we really waited only about fifteen minutes, We were seated and promptly greeted by Kevin, our waiter. Kevin was exceptional. When the tuna I ordered was unavailable he recommended the swordfish, and even told me that it would be on him if I didn't like it. He took excellent care of us, recommending an excellent beer to go with both of our dinners, recommending an amazing pumpkin creme brulee dessert, and checking on us often.  He was quite possibly one of the best waiters I've ever had.The food was excellent. We enjoyed everything. The swordfish was cooked perfectly with just a little crispy sear but still quite moist inside. The pumpkin ravioli was a perfect accompaniment to the swordfish, as was my beer. My wife had the shrimp and the crab corn chowder, both of which she absolutely loved. It was a bit expensive, but quite worth it. I'd definitely return if I am in Evansville again."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/bonefish-grill-evansville?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
