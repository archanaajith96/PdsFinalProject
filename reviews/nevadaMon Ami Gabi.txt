Mon Ami Gabi, (my love Gabi), is a nice place in Vegas to sit down for a dinner on the strip and enjoy the view of the sunset on Sin City from Paris' patio. Classic french style, I snacked on a bagged baguette before deciding what to order. I was with a group of 4, and we ordered a cold seafood platter to share, and shared a \"classic prime\" steak frites. The platter was impressive, featuring oysters, shrimp cocktail, and lobster claws and tails. There were a few sauces and lemon to complement the seafood, and it was well prepared and tasty. The steak was juicy and came with a lot of fries- so it's a reasonable deal given some places on the Strip can be a rip-off. If you're not feeling like a buffet, MAG is a nice place to share a surf and turf that is somewhat budget-friendly."}, {"review_id": "P7b_LWkgRsUKLDl82swv_w", "user_id": "-RApyq06DMBii7ovXtQnfw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "One of the places I recommend for first timers in Vegas. Whether it be breakfast, lunch or dinner, Mon Ami Gabi is really a great place to grab a bite and enjoy the faux-Parisian atmosphere. I've been here a few times, and I think I like the ambiance almost as much as the food... though the food is good too, in case you're wondering. The menu has a decent selection and the staff is super friendly. The blueberry french toast is one of my favorite breakfast items. The Croque Madame is always a good option too. For dinner I often opt for a steak with fries. Honestly most things on the menu are going to be great. I did have the lemon crepe last time which I didn't love (not nearly lemony enough) but they can't all be winners #AMIRITEOverall a good choice for a nice restaurant with a good location and decent pricing on the strip. A big endorsement from me!Stay Cheerful ;)"}, {"review_id": "_lkYcKkJHu-7I19idASjkA", "user_id": "osM4Ssqj-w-JTXGVe7TTuA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Excellent French bistro dining.

There are five sauce options and while delicious, the steak is seasoned so well and quality of meat so great you almost don't need anything to go with it!

We went here for lunch and enjoyed the fresh baguette with whipped room temperature butter, some frangria (the French version of Sangria), mushroom soup, lobster roll, baked salmon, and escargot. We found the portions to be much larger than your typical lunch, but the food taste so good that it made it really easy to eat up! Unfortunately, we were so full that there was absolutely no room for dessert! More about the food...The lobster roll was meaty with very little mayo and filling (yhevway I love it)!!! The salmon was made perfectly, and the soup was creamy full of blended and chopped shitake mushrooms. I must recommend that you try the Frangria with any meal because it's definitely worth it!

I know the strip has a lot of great places to eat but I'm so glad we gave this place a shot . I honestly have not have steak prepared and made to perfection like I did this past Saturday . We started off with having the goat cheese appetizer with extra garlic bread , escargot , the fillet mignon (of course rare, the only way to go), and topped it off with their IPA beer . Everything was amazing !! From the greeting at the door , to paying the check . The pricing per plate is pretty decent and compared to the food not over priced at all . Over all great experience and yes I will be back again once we check into Vegas . A total of four of us ate there and all together we spent a total of 280 , that's including tip . They were very kind at this place . We had reservations at 6:00 pm but did not show up due to being drunk from a pool party . They helped us out and got us another reservation for 8:15 pm the same night . Try this place out , from me tasting everyone's plates and appetizers I'm certain that you won't be disappointed with anything ."}, {"review_id": "pEi8kFEoyc0cShdf_nBq4w", "user_id": "1JlOo8MoX4e67l34aRulrg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Last visit to Las Vegas I was recommended to go here by a chef in Miami regretfully I did not listen. So this visit I made it a point to go first day and I am so glad I did. From the second you enter the restaurant you are warmly embraced even without reservations. I was able to sit outside albeit close to a heater. The service was over the top. After reading the great menu I decide on a vegetable omelet no cheese with a side of berries. It was perfectly made the omelet I would love to know how they prepare them as it isn't like any other I tasted before. I enjoyed the leisuely and relaxing breakfast before a hectic scheduled day. I will definitely return on my next visit to Las Vegas. I am sure their lunch and dinner menu was over the top.The prices were very well priced especially for the quality of the food."}, {"review_id": "5xwKd4fxQ3t_krmuKhjjXw", "user_id": "OcgPf5H6wL2J2d5vKbMEug", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "My favorite part about the dining experience here is the view. We sat on the patio, with the Eiffel Tower right above us and Bellagio's water show just across the street. Needless to say, the ambiance was great. The street can be noisy sometimes, but I don't mind it so much because it's part of the Vegas vibe. On the other hand, there are a couple of ways in which they could improve. First of all, we loved the soup of the day but the onion soup was too salty and had an peculiar taste. Unfortunately, my friend only took a sip and couldn't finish it. Furthermore, I wish they had more options on the menu. While I appreciate the small and exclusive selection, maybe more pasta and dessert options would have improved the experience."}, {"review_id": "1Xe3YKHHK9AIt0PxSojGTw", "user_id": "f_5VRh79aew1cVWUmC1PJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Cute restaurant.

So the setup of the front host stand seems small and stressful. Not too comfortable of a place to wait around in. The hosts don't seem that friendly either. Wish it was different. So the ambiance of this place is very BUSY and a lot of people all around... but it is considered kinda romantic and upscale. The waiter we got was attentive  and sweet but soft spoken so i can barely hear her when she spoke in that loud restaurant. Service all around was good.. can't complain about that at all. Although the table we got was SUPER CLOSE to the next table next to us... which made it super awkward dining there cause it feels like they are listening into our conversations and all... plus they were staring at us the whole time. Although after they left the next table that came in after them kept to themselves and minded their own business. I absolutely hate it when I'm trying to have a romantic time with someone and theres no privacy whatsoever. The restaurant needs to space out their tables a little bit more and not so close.. thats my only major complaint here. Im sure if we got sat at a different table there might have been more space to the next table.. its just the one we were sat at was NOT. they need to improve on this for the future .... So lets talk about the food! we ordered the smoked salmon dish with cream cheese and bread. very yummy... I ordered the bone in filet! cooked medium. So.. the meat was tender but not much flavor!! I wasn't impressed with the flavor of this steak and probably needed some steak sauce for this one to make it taste better. when a steak is cooked good...it won't need any.. but this one needed some sort of kick. We also ordered sautéed spinach and mac and cheese I believe... quite tasty.. The person I was with ordered filet as well. they seem to enjoy it. Oh yeah we ordered drinks too.. we got margaritas..moscow mules..and champagne.. Moscow mule was too sweet so I had them redo it.. it was better but it just means they added simple syrup to it or something! which normally I like mine with just vodka ginger beer and lime juice! I don't like it when bartenders add that sugary stuff! yuck! Anyways.. overall i would come back again.. and hoping to have a better seating! I will probably order the ribeye next time ...maybe there would be more flavor with that kinda steak compared to the bone in filet i got. Ambience is nice tho.."}, {"review_id": "ZuenPGj7MuzOZbUxnkU0pQ", "user_id": "1hGKhu0DWrVZZRhDvQztbw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Vegas is a little hit and miss, right? Especially coming from a reviewer who was there for a bachelorette. Despite all odds, we did do the proper due diligence of preparing in advance and being mindful of our surroundings. We came with a rather large party reserved upfront for an event; while our server was incredible and super amazing, the food was less than to be desired. Of course, we didn't expect timeliness since we were in a party of 12 but it did certainly take awhile to come out.We waited a bit even for our turn at fresh bread, we had to flag our waiter a few times to remind him (but when it did come out, it was amazing).While I wouldn't normally ding a restaurant on lag for bringing food out - I would say that you knew our plates were sitting under a heater since the salad that was on the side was completely wilted and hot as the plate nearly singed my fingers.Given the price point, I wouldn't say go with a big group.
