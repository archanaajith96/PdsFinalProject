Don't forget the eyedropper spicy vinegar for every oyster! Calamari, tender and tasty. Mushrooms over toast points was a truffle delight. Hanger steak had a great grilled taste. Tagliatelle with fennel sausage had a touch of basil and melted in your mouth. Honey tart with buttermilk ice cream topped off the night, sweet, not too sweet and an absolute magic buttery crust!!!!!! OH MAN! I honestly have never been in a restaurant with such fantastically trained staff, so knowledgeable about the food ingredients and how everything is prepared. On our servers recommendation we had the Pinot noire from Germany, yes, Germany and it was DELICIOUS!!! Highly recommend a visit or several visits. It's an experience."}, {"review_id": "lkQHPCxwaUt6r9Rz0tIQ5A", "user_id": "7YLxPlGQruB7TeuPcNNE1A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "I would tell you how good the food was but my mouth has died and gone to heaven! OkHad two cheeses to start. Both we very good. I rarely complain about portion size but these were just a little small.Split 3 appetizers. Rabbit croquettes, celery root and red beets. Celery root was my favorite because it was a new flavor. The red beets were really good but my least favorite because they did not go \"outside the box\"Tagliatelle with sausage and fennel was fantastic. Pasta cooked perfect. My opinion would have been less sausage and more noodle but I know others might disagree. I only say because I rarely get fresh pasta.Chocolate dessert was over the top. A small chocolate pudding plus a scoop of dark chocolate sorbet sprinkled with chocolate !!!!! Incredible. A must try if in Burlington, just bring your BIG wallet!"}, {"review_id": "HnxpdzQmgeuebk3gIcP0LQ", "user_id": "BY6vX8ZnoG7al0B9PiN5Fw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "Holy hell...this was about as Vermont chic as one can get!  We were looking forward to coming to Hen of the Wood for a while during our Burlington weekend away.  We knew it had a lot of regional attention and it happened to be attached to our hotel.  I suggest making a reservation but we went in a few hours before hand and requested that we get a bar seat instead (we're bar people!) but had the table reservation just in case it was bonkers.  We arrived and much to my surprise, we landed spots at the Chef's Counter!  This was great because we got to see and watch the action of the grills, ovens, skillets, and prep work only feet from our table space.  The chefs tend to be in the zone, you don't interact with them, but the vibe of the fast pace cooking and prep is nicely juxtaposed with the dim lighting, natural wood, and cozy fire in the corner of the restaurant.  I would highly suggest getting the rolls...yea, its just bread, but this was an exquisite and fluffy dinner roll with the most delicious local butter!  We got the pork loin and steak for our entrees (I forgot what we got for starters) but they were cooked exactly how we wanted them.  The desserts were incredible.  We got the 3 gelatos they had and I've never had anything like this salted caramel and vanilla gelato.  In summation - make a rezy, but get there before to see if you can land the Chef's Counter (since its first come first served there), get rolls, get gelato...and just go all out.  We spent a ton of $$$ but the experience was totally worth it!"}, {"review_id": "b2-FImtgdL1OZ_SFLpS69A", "user_id": "1AeeVwgiYTcDJuSuB_G2RA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "This place is bomb--peep the pics for the shroom toast, beef tartare, gem lettuce, and the best Parker house rolls this side of the Mississippi"}, {"review_id": "-iUzKjTgG1M-jDhHIAdGPQ", "user_id": "0Pd-LScDP0zLf4ShnV8L0Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/17/2017", "text": "We went to the original Hen of the Wood in Stowe literally a decade before checking out this Burlington location, and before its now popularity. We had to book this reservation several weeks in advance in order secure a regular dinner time. A Saturday night in autumn, the place was expectedly packed to the rim, standing room only in the large bar area. The ambiance was rustic chic, and dark. The issue with many restaurants this popular is that they pack the tables in and unfortunately it does suffer a little bit from that here. The tables were not big and fairly close together. And just from the sheer amount of people, it was fairly loud as well. I don't know if the Stowe location has also become like this, but very different from what I remember there. Anyways for the food, the menu doesn't offer too many choices for each course as to honor the hyper-local and seasonal approach of the restaurant. We weren't super hungry and started with some cheese. The Clothbound Cheddar form Jasper Hill is nutty and complex. And the Mt. Alice from von Trapp is sweet and creamy. We enjoyed both of them so much that we made sure to stop by the Cabot store on the way home and picked both of them up.For entrees, my husband chose the Hanger Steak which was served with green beans and a chimichurri sauce. The steak was definitely cooked perfectly medium rare and quite tender. I had the Striped Bass served with corn and chorizo succotash and shishito peppers. The fish was very good though I cannot call it mindblowing by any means. The succotash however was delicious and made the dish for me.Overall, we had an excellent dinner at Hen of the Wood. You can definitely tell all the ingredients are fresh. I would call it fine comfort food."}, {"review_id": "Pw8Xfkn1ZwgQIpjRTPCiXg", "user_id": "G0c28_TvCko6x-yZI_Zq3g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "They have delicious food, always fresh.

We got a table at the kitchen bar so we saw the dishes assembling. The simple salad of green leaves, blue cheese, candied walnuts was incredibly fresh and flavorful. Then the mushrooms bacon and egg on toast with every ingredient a winner. Halibut main with home made creme fraiche and the potatoes side was almost as good. And a single scoop of super rich butter pecan ice cream. That's enough to leave two people happy and stuffed. The server was cool too, letting us try multiple wines before we picked which one to get a glass of.

I literally didn't want anything on it. Nothing. We almost got up left the dark and cozy bar before ordering - but it was too cold. We settled for 2 cheeses - but I eat these Vt selections at home all the time. The plate was good but not great, needing one more element - fruit, maybe the fennel jam they used to have back in the day... Also the serving was a bit chintzy. Larger portions of the cheese would be nice. Prices are NY/Boston level, after all. Aside from value, my issue is the menu. If you're into vegetables - this is just not your place. If you want plant based food, hit up Honey Road. Those gals know how to make some tasty and interesting veg based dishes. And their choices are abundant. If you want heavy man food and funky proteins, HotW (with their predominantly male staff?) is your place. Not for me. Won't rush back.
