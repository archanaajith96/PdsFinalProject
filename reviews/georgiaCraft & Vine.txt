No question about it! I visited C & V for the first time this past week. Legit, Chase is the reason I'll definitely keep coming back and often! Dude is a freaking amazing mixologist, knowledgeable & friendly. Nice to see someone passionate about their work. Give that dude a raise! ...And I suggest the Craft & Vine mojito (I think that was the official name)!!!! Strawberries, whiskey, crushed ice....HOME RUN! No, but..for real, give Chase a raise . He was cool and the drinks were amazing! 3 th"}, {"review_id": "ICib9xPTpU3fFTnJLYKK4g", "user_id": "HLeAJkhtVLrSDK0_jwncAw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/6/2017", "text": "Stopped by for drinks after eating at Frog Hollow and will be coming back soon!The waiter was very attentive and great a suggesting cocktails. The only thing I was not impressed with is it seemed like the drink I was recommended was not a favorite of the bar tender's to make. Our waiter kept saying how the bar tender was getting annoyed with him for putting the orders in. But it was so yummy I kept ordering! I'm going to announce to all of you yelpers that YOU MUST TRY the Snake Bite! I promise you don't want to miss out. It was an amazing whiskey sour like cocktail with absinthe and a heavenly frothy egg white. You definitely should try it!Can't wait to go back and try some food. This is a great hangout place!"}, {"review_id": "-0T_TYEE5hieDim1MSB_1g", "user_id": "YaW2sv1SCCA61Nsq692P8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Great recommendation from a neighboring bar.

That may sound like nothing but it's our second date night in a year and we spent it here...again. Our server was Will, he was a perfect gentleman and made awesome recommendations. If I'm on the fence about something, I'll refer back to the server and most people will be caught off guard or be really generic. Not Will, he didn't skip a beat and as I mention in my previous review, it speaks to the quality of what you're getting when you come here. I love the food, the atmosphere and everything in between!!"}, {"review_id": "X90cAXV_tJWsrHr7JGuJRw", "user_id": "U4RhkSu57AX67njlVIrqPw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "This is a favorite spot for dinner dates when my husband and I are in Augusta.

The atmosphere of this place, which was their intent, whisks you back to the Prohibition era where you feel like you've just stepped on the set of the Great Gatsby. Whether you are seated immediately or have a short wait, a cocktail list and drink menu will find its way into your hands. Let me just say this; whichever one you pick, it will be delicious. And they will give you the fair warning as well that the drinks are Prohibition strength (read: stronger than normal), so be careful. Also, thanks to a special system you can enjoy a taste-half glass-full glass of top notch wine without having to purchase an entire bottle.     The tapas might be rabbit wings or duck poutine or pork skins, but know they are all fresh and flavorful. When everything is farm-to-table and any sauces, simple syrups, etc. are made in-house you know quality is the only acceptable standard. The main plates and the brick oven pizza make you wish you could just continue eating (which is a option since they are open till midnight/1 am). If, by some miracle you have room for dessert then get ready. When words like \"truffle\" and \"zeppoli\" are options, you know you picked the right place for dinner. They pair well with a locally roasted French Press coffee that comes out on fine china (cream and sugar cubes are a given).*Insider's Tip-There are two happy hours to enjoy here. 5-6:30 pm, 10 pm-close [only open Wed-Sat].-There are no reservations so plan to come and enjoy the cocktails while you wait, if you are part of a group. They have a comfortable area in the front for this."}, {"review_id": "GHJrm6gWsGCF8uYz0pCVFQ", "user_id": "NRGJ4IvauajqqCbhT640cw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/15/2016", "text": "Liked my meal here at Craft & Vine. The elevated gastropub has an interesting cocktail and food menu, certainly the most creative I've seen in the area. Tasted bites of wood fired salted pretzel bites w/ pimiento cheese fondue (the bites were salty good and dip had a ton of flavor), fried eggplant w/ rosemary butter and a honey drizzle (this was a little sweet for me), cauliflower popcorn (again, fried) and a pork cheek hash with egg (rich, as expected). Tasting all of these with a Bee's Pajamas cocktail (gin, honey, angostura and pear bitters) was a nice little meal. I feel as if I scratched the surface on what C&V is capable of, so I'll be sure to head back for return visits (with rabbit wings and pizza!). Bonus: Late night hours and service was on point"}, {"review_id": "QQ6ifRbZ8xSZ34-zET08RQ", "user_id": "zJMYjYMaj7wERK-uH2gfPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/4/2017", "text": "Guess who is kicking themselves for not trying this place for the three years I've been here? Yup, that'd be me. Came here with two friends last night and wanted to try everything off the menu. Not even kidding when I say that. We ended up trying the oysters and the mussels. The dipping sauce with the oysters was perfect. The mussels were delectable in every way possible. The waiter brought extra bread because I just didn't want to give the bowl back. Whoops. Since I'm on a gin kick, I tried the Bee's Pajamas and it was wonderful. I would gladly order it again but I'm afraid I may never order the same thing when I come back and I'm okay with that. The fig & prosciutto flatbread was calling my name so hopefully next time I'm back it's still on the menu. No pictures because the food was eaten very quickly and very much enjoyed."}, {"review_id": "AFnLTyWAKZQisbptj8U5cg", "user_id": "Wjlo5YcDe2Lc7I4WNqooDw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "Wow!

So refreshing to find a decent place in Augusta, with nice ambience and good service.  The food is small plates only, so unless you want pizza, there is not much in way of regular portion. The meat and cheese tray is a must and so is the roasted olives. One warning on the pizza, the meaty is very salty because they use dried meats and not actual regular pizza toppings. We had to send ours back because it was not edible. They made up for it by giving us a feee dessert and taking the pizza off the bill. Overall great place to hang and snack with drinks. A little on the pricey side for drinks."}, {"review_id": "pVYs_S5b0iMq05uG1qNCmA", "user_id": "Io1ILaKfXwA0XUratbsKhQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/14/2017", "text": "Classy place with very hip vibe.

Coconut Truffles: too rich for me. My wife will love these for her next cycle craving.

The food is excellent- the mushroom pizza is my favorite pizza; all while sipping on an excellently crafted old fashioned. If you're looking for a fun environment with food and drinks to make you keep ordering more this is the place to be. And if you're feeling fun, try a Chambong. Better yet get the whole table to do one. They've pretty much got something for everyone. Want an amazing pizza, done. Want charcuterie plate paired with excellent wine (even some high end wines by the glass or even a taste), done. Oysters or mussels, done. Even the beer list doesn't disappoint- local and regional craft beers only on draft.

You're paying full portion prices and getting \"small plate portions\". I will probably return but definitely next time I'll try the cheese plates and just drinks.

Yes please!I was looking for something fancy that would give me a good excuse to wear a suit, so I took my wife to Craft & Vine. I may have looked like the staff being so fancy, but I sure felt like Al Capone. Men need more excuses to wear suits and this little hand-crafted cocktail bar is just the spot.This prohibition style bar serves hospitality in a glass and if you arrive Wed-Sat at 5-6:30pm or 10pm-closing you can save $2 a glass for Happy Hour. Personally, I don't think Al Capone would be in downtown Augusta at midnight so I hit the early bird HH specials.- Hand-crafted cocktails- Large wine list- Gourmet small plates- Fancy & friendly staff- Good for groupsWhile Craft & Vine isn't on the cheap side, the food is worth every penny. You don't have to be a millionaire mobster to eat here, but it'll cost at least $30 per person with drinks and appetizers. The experience though, oh the experience! You'll feel like you're on a Food Network show when your small plates arrive and don't skimp on desert either.I started the night off right with an Old Fashioned ($6 HH) and let me tell you, they don't go cheap on the whiskey. You might want to call an Uber if you're having more than one.After a few sips of whiskey the Cheeseboard and Meat Platter (5 for $25) arrived. For any of you cheese and meat snobs, this is the dish for you. My pallet isn't as crazy about cheese but I could still appreciate the differences in flavor.Next came the Soft Shell Crab special ($10) which was a WHOLE crab that was fried to the point I just ate it with shell and all. The lettuce on the side was pretty blah but that crab was worth ordering a second just for me. Don;t plan on sharing this dish!My favorite bite? The Muscles ($12) were fantastic! They had a roasted garlic cream, herbs, white wine and heirloom tomatoes mixed in. Every bite had layers of flavor and when I ran out of muscles I nearly cried. This dish is notoriously hard to eat in a suit unless you can somehow eat them without getting splatter all over. I ended up doing that napkin as a bib thing, which worked out fine and looked super silly.I finished everything off with some Truffles ($5) which just melted in my mouth! You don't even have to be a chocolate fan to enjoy these bad boys.I tried a few other dishes that friends were having like the pizza and there were no complaints. Really, you can't lose no matter what you order.Stop by Craft & Vine and then enjoy their less expensive counterparts at Frog Hollow or Farmhaus Burger for equally amazing quality."}, {"review_id": "ha_AqUiTFVDT4_rJkm6-Cg", "user_id": "yqW0KHkzp1jUq9kXKo0tXw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/10/2017", "text": "Best spot in Augusta for date night, girls' night, after-work happy hour.
