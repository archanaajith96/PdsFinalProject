Where they really shine? The cheese. Do yourself a favor and get a cheese board, and the formagiee will whisk you away on an educational and delicious tour of cheeses of your choice. I never expected to learn so much from an upscale meal! But seriously, the formagiee that worked with us was so knowledgeable, friendly, and tolerant of our naive questions. I would go back again just for the cheese experience."}, {"review_id": "qI5TjoaKXPIJ08J2pLJnyQ", "user_id": "NWMul2Rh-VHEkSv6Prkitw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "French. Classy. High end. Is the food any good? The short answer is yes, the food is outstanding. I could go on for 2 paragraphs just talking about how great the food is. I strongly encourage you to taste for yourself. So why just 4 stars? It's because of the building. This is a very strange labyrinth like restaurant. There are very narrow walk ways, strangely uneven brick floors, low ceilings and closed off spaces. We were a party of 8 so we sat at a big table, but to get to that table we had to make 3 right turns from the hostess podium to be seated at a table surrounded by three walls. About 30 minutes into service I had to step outside to get some fresh air because of the claustrophobic stuffiness of that room. Two things that almost never happen to me. Maybe it was just me though. Check it out for yourself."}, {"review_id": "tM1wludWiLReMLSpyksFVw", "user_id": "Rd5V3PygUNXYaJI6PRVU9g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "My husband and I had a lovely anniversary dinner here. I would say skip the cocktails and enjoy the wine. The cheese cart looked phenomenal but we opted to try it another day. The duck confit and salmon with lentil dishes were delicious. We finished off the meal with a crème caramel and a port. Please note that these dishes were gluten free. They also served some gluten free bread in addition to the regular bread for dipping in olive oil. Every other dish we observed being delivered to various tables also looked quite good.Newcomers be aware the restaurant is on a walking path/street so it is technically inaccessible by car. It abuts a parking lot that costs $2-3 for dining patrons. You can also park on the street where there is metered and walk through the parking lot. We opted for the parking lot."}, {"review_id": "IMEn13mGY0-3Vot94n8Sdw", "user_id": "oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/2/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "They have a Happy Hour menu!!I stopped in a little before 5pm on a Saturday and sat at the bar with my friend. We split several dishes from the happy hour menu and have no regrets. My favorite was the pork belly poutine and next up would be the homemade gnocchi, mmm! The burger was good too, the flatbread I would pass on next time. I did get the cocktail on special and it was super tasty and refreshing! Prices were $10 or under and the kitchen was kind enough to split everything so that we did not have to at our seats. But maybe even better than the food was the service! The three servers we encountered behind the bar were all just so pleasant and helpful! They seemed like they genuinely liked their jobs and each other. I will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "PN41XOrjIDreTRsZfeJ4TQ", "user_id": "0V0xwKAbN_DN3EL4oHO2_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Well, there were so many flavors and tastes it's hard to focus! From the Chianti to the amazing French onion soup with braised beef, to the apple cake with praline ice cream... lovely!  We closed out our meal with the spectacular cheese tray and sherry. What an experience!  Others at the table tried the artichoke, the cod and the terraine de chef and all was so well prepared. Nice portion sizes, and the staff was accommodating and fun. The cheese tray is a trip around the world and something so unique.

I'm not that familiar with the Cleveland dining scene, but coming from Chicago, L'Albatros would be a welcome addition of heaven in any Chicago neighborhood. Admittedly, I don't venture out for French food as often as other cuisines (mostly out of courtesy to my waistline), but when I do, I have to throw all thoughts of calories out the window and let loose. And that's exactly the best way to enjoy a fantastic French establishment like L'Albatros. I enjoyed L'Albatros with two friends a week ago on a random Thursday night while in town for a couple days. The restaurant ambiance is perfect for a cozy but modern French restaurant. Intimate but not quiet. Quaint but also elegant. There's an open kitchen that you see right upon entering but it's not visible from most tables. There's also a cute bar just before entering the main dining room.  This could easily be a local neighborhood eatery in any French town. We were seated immediately for our reservation and started with a delicious bottle of Sancerre. Our server was extremely helpful in guiding us through the menu, making recommendations, and also politely suggesting we might want to wait and see if we were still hungry after the first 7 items we ordered before adding more.  The menu is massive, so the good news is there is something for everyone. The bad news is you want to try everything. We began the night with escargot, French toast, oysters on a half shell, and the arugula and radicchio salad. Wow. What a start. The oysters were perfect, fresh and with a delicious mignonette. The escargot was buttery and garlicky just as it should be.  They will gladly bring you as much bread as you want to use to dip and soak up all the heavenly garlic butter. Don't be shy. We might have asked for refills at least 3 times. Ok, 4 times. The French Toast was an interesting concept with egg soaked bread topped with mushroom heaven, balsamic, and arugula. I will never be able to eat mushrooms any other way again. The arugula salad was a nice fresh and light contrast to make us feel like we weren't total gluttons. Despite being totally full after the starters, our two entrees came next - the cassoulet and the trout with a side of the crispy breaded cauliflower. All were excellent but heavy (even the trout was a little extra buttery). The cassoulet is super meaty with a variety of animals tossed in a skillet of heavenly flavors. The trout was moist and delicious. And the cauliflower was a perfect side. We easily could have ordered 3 fewer items and have been totally full. (But we needed more food to go with the second bottle of wine...)All in all, it was a wonderful night out for 3 friends who don't see each other often. The restaurant was bumping at 7:30 when we got there and totally empty at 10:15 when we left. But that's expected for a school night. Can't recommend this restaurant enough for anyone looking for a fun night out or a great date spot."}, {"review_id": "gfY_9ndViGju2vRI0v10CQ", "user_id": "0dBZWWZBCWJ-1noLT6k88g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/5/2017", "text": "My husband and I celebrate our anniversary here almost every year.

It was a pretty disappointing dish. The portion was large but the duck meat was stringy and tough. The skin wasn't fully rendered and was sitting in a saucy bed of cabbage and got soggy. None of us finished our dishes. It just wasn't authentic or tasty. I did enjoy the French onion soup, which had inside with hearty chunks of tender beef--that was a tasty surprise.

We went last week with friends for dinner, one of our friends had some left overs and asked they be packed up, she placed the bag on the long shared bench she was sitting it, we didn't realize it till later but the couple at the table next to us also had food together and took hers too (100% sure by accident), once the server over heard us talking about it she went to the kitchen and had a 1/2 order made up on the house to go.Great service, fair pricing, and awesome food, what else could ya want?"}, {"review_id": "ur7B_n8iMJVPvoE7gK6fHQ", "user_id": "eR8fBtTjtFDuEwhxEYlEeg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "My wife and I have gone here on many a date night (and even taken her parents here to show off one of Cleveland's best restaurants)!

In the winter they also have a coat check, which I wasn't expecting and was delighted to have!The food is consistently delicious. I always get the chicken with potatoes and goat cheese and it is always an explosion of flavor. My wife mixes it up - hanger steak, pork two ways, bouillabaisse - she's never ordered a dish she doesn't end up loving! Their foie gras is also excellent and I highly recommend to anyone who wants to try it! And, of course, it comes as no surprise the dessert is amazing!

Bold flavor with melty gooey cheese. One of the best onion soups. One criticism is that it was a tad over salted. A cup was just enough to leave us craving moreThe mussels were fresh and flavorful and pomme frites crispy. The delicious sauce was great for dipping anything. Pork 2 ways: a miss. Pork belly was fatty and should have been rendered longer. The shank was overcooked and dry. The cauliflower, while crispy, was bland. Took a risk with the \"frozen grand marnier soufflé.\"  While we were warned not to expect a warm soufflé, but a cold dessert, it was completely unexpected to have watery vanilla sauce that resembled nothing of a soufflé in taste or texture. It was neither smooth nor fluffy, and unfortunately not frozen either. It tasted more like ice cream left at room temperature to melt and then served; then someone must have took a swig of our grand marnier because the flavor was nowhere in our dessert. It was only suitable in the coffee as a substitute creamer."}, {"review_id": "bnz1jWTz5BEgbDUYhEMLxQ", "user_id": "H3VsV3rm86qipND8Vj56Mw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/9/2017", "text": "Had pleasant brunch at this establishment on the outdoor patio.  Overall, it was a good experience with nicely prepared French fare, attentive service staff, and nice environment.  The back patio was very nice and I would recommend requesting a seat there if you are coming in on a nice day.    The service staff was nice enough to move around the umbrellas to maximize the shade we were getting.  Additionally, they were very accommodating when one of the guests in our party needed to be served ahead of the others.  For drinks, I had the house recommended Cambria Chardonnay which I would highly recommend for those who enjoy a smokier Chardonnay.For appetizers, we shared a the foie gras with chicken liver.  The dish comes with nicely prepared French bread and the spread.  A very generous quantity of the spread is provided.  The flavor was nice and earthy and had good texture, however, would have like a little more flavor in the spread.  The bread was delicious.For the main entree, we ordered some salads, the chicken pizza, and the mussels.  The mussels stole the show - it was loaded up with a bed of French fries over it.  The mussels were very fresh,  had great flavor, and good texture - not dry and overlooked like a lot of other steamed mussels.  The sauce was a bit heavy over the French fries, nice time I will probably order it on the side.  Pizza was pretty good - very light and the chicken was very flavorful.  Overall, a good experience.  Will be back to try out the dinner service."}, {"review_id": "gxf56TjaC7dAqLvYHJ0V3w", "user_id": "VLy6l8L72adD7iTBNqiPXw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/8/2017", "text": "My husband surprised me with an anniversary dinner last night. We've been here on multiple occasions and we've never once had a bad experience. We started with drinks and appetizers. Which were the \"French toast\" and the escargo. The escargo was absolutely amazing and jam packed with flavor. The chunks of garlic and toast made for an awesome crunch. The \"French toast\" was also very good. I'm a huge fan of different textures and the toast hit that on the spot. Between the crispy bread, mushrooms and sauce. It was a sweet yet delectable treat. We did get a bowl of the soup which was a corn chowder. Served chilled. It had an amazing taste. The chives were an awesome touch. However, I didn't realize until that night. I don't like chilled soup. Lol! Its a weird texture. But, if you do, I'd totally recommend you try it. Out main meals were. The Cassoulet and the seared sea scallops. My meal was the scallops. Talk about amazing. The mixture of brussel sprouts, noodles, scallops and the white sauce was absolutely heavenly. Everything was cooked perfectly and seasoned right.I loved the fact the brussel sprouts were shredded, it added an awesome texture. The Cassoulet. You seriously can not go wrong with this dish. Beans, duck, pork belly, sausage and so many other tasty treats in one pan. The flavors blend together making it the most incredible dish on the menu. For our dessert, we had the warm brownie. It was packed with cherries and nuts. Warm and delicious topped with vanilla ice cream. It was an incredible meal. If you haven't been here. I'd highly recommend you go! We can't wait to return!"}, {"review_id": "jj5U4mTQLsvolertV3QUVw", "user_id": "wyODhqTQFfBum-B98JLLHw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "Wonderful French food in a friendly, inviting atmosphere.  Very good service, helpful but not intrusive.I'll be back asap."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/l-albatros-cleveland?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
