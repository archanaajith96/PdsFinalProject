Very good place. I needed reservations even for one but got a nice small table in the main dining room. This place is a combo of being upscale and old world. Every meal starts with a bowl of this really good soup with a clear broth, potatoes, cabbage and little bits of sausage. I started with the appetizer of shrimp, mushrooms and little sausages and then had the Mariscada Salsa Verde which was a pot of seafood in a broth that was fantastic. It comes with a dish of fluffy yellow Spanish rice and these house made chips. Service very good. Prices not terribly high either. I can see why this place has lasted so many decades. I would go here again if possible."}, {"review_id": "Z0TajJP8MQ7530y3ykDvjg", "user_id": "HGg_xPQLh92YTQkzMG60zw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "IMO best food in the Ironbound.

We originally attempted to go to their other location in Mountainside since it's closer to home but they had a 2 hour wait so we decided to take a trip to Newark. After arriving a little before 8:00 I'd say we waited about 15-20 minutes for a table for two. The tables here are rather close together. Unfortunately my chair kept getting bumped from the large table behind us. Anyway, while we were looking over the menu we were served some fresh rolls with butter and then the waiter brought over a terrine with soup that he served us table side. He didn't say what kind of soup it was but it was a nice broth with beans and some greens. For our entrees we selected the jumbo crabmeat stuffed shrimp and a fish dish. I can't recall what type of fish it was. The entrees are accompanied with a side of yellow rice and fresh cut chips. I thought the shrimp was ok, it just lacked seasoning and some fresh lemon. The fish was good. The sides were also nice. Our server was pretty good, they were rather busy so it did take a bit to get our water refilled after asking. It was still a nice dinner."}, {"review_id": "HcMFcyNyXRHVWjTO0kLjQg", "user_id": "aqXY7pN0nIHfyrusGA71pw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2017", "text": "Ken and Jacquie heard this place is pretty solid, so we ventured over after work. Being not from around these parts, I had no idea what to expect. Holy wow, did this place deliver on the rumors. The atmosphere is really old school and a bit stuffy, but the food seriously brightened up the experience.The octopus and squid saute apprizer is freaking out of this world, and the halibut special just blew my socks off. It's definitely one of the best meals I've had in New York (the amazing company helped). Highly highly recommend.

It's not exactly an ideal travel destination but I went there for a very important conference/seminar. With my friend and two other ladies we happened to meet, we ventured to Spanish Tavern for dinner one night. I love the ambiance inside. Dim lights, soft music, courteous staff and the waiters are adorable. They try their best to accommodate the guests. I had the crab topped scallops! Wow! It was so decadent and satisfying!!! So rich, buttery and cheesy. The scallops were perfectly tender and juicy. I barely finished them as it was a large portion. The presentation was so unique...served broiled in a large scallop shell. Melted cheese on top was amazing! Our meal was accompanied by family style Spanish Potatoes (reminiscent of perfect potato chips) and yellow rice. Oh and the meal started with complimentary lentil soup that was delicious! Towards the end of the meal, the crowd picked up so the wait staff seemed busy but when they made it back to our table, they were very attentive. They were happy to let us take separate checks. How convenient! I kid you not...I would go back to Newark just to taste Spanish Tavern yumminess again!"}, {"review_id": "lhp4zkJ7L1jlZIMVBrerXg", "user_id": "8sjHuDfSTxH706B5adG74Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/18/2017", "text": "Great experience with a family feel.Honestly when the restaurant provides rides from the hotel I was a little concerned.However, once in the door I was greeted with a warm welcome.

Legends may often fade with time. The Spanish Tavern is a living thriving and wonderful legend that is as good as it was when I first dined there thirty years ago. Even then it was memorable. In a party of four guest we arrived about 7:30. We were amazed to find the restaurant was jammed on the coldest day of the year so far. For the nostalgia of old diners and  the information for new diners, I will review our visit. The best part of the review is that the food, service, and atmosphere are wonderful AND has not changed in 30 years. The classic Spanish menu was supplemented by a page of daily specials. After we were seated we were immediately served a hardy soup to warm us from the bitter cold. Our appetizers were the best I have had in a long time and the offerings were exactly the same we had eaten 30 years ago. As they say \"don't mess with success\". My fellow diners stuck to the regular memo and were pleased. I ventured to the daily specials. The dish was a pork loin prepared with potatoes and salads. The dish was wonderful. The secret was Gorgonzola cheese in the potatoes and salad. I must note that by the time the server had showed us the dessert offerings we were able to order them as good as they looked. Next time I go I will try to save some room for these Spanish dessert delights.Spanish Tavern is legend again that should please the new generation of diners as well as their forefathers.

Busboy needs polishing.2. Complementary soup was an embarrassment, why even bother with it?3. My steak was undercooked/raw.3. They need to provide better eating utensils if you're eating steak.Detailed review:Overall a great restaurant and food.Their lamb and grilled prawns are amazing!With that said, my recent visit was not up to standards.They served us complementary soup while we waited for our food but it was very watery and disappointing, yes I know it was free but they should of saved themselves the embarrassment. The bus boy who served the soup was also a little clumsy and splashed soup on my bowl which consequently ended up splashing over my eating area, my arms and clothes.Next, when I went to eat the soup I only had a dessert spoon so I had to ask the same bus boy to get me a table spoon which he never did so I had to ask our actual waiter instead. By the time all was said and done, the soup was already cold and didn't even put a dent in it.I ordered their regular bacon wrapped filet mignon MEDIUM RARE... but a large portion of the center was simply RAW and inedible. The outside had a nice crispy char which means their cooking surface was way too hot when they prepared my steak. Very disappointing .My knife was too small but eventually did get a bigger and better steak knife after asking. However when I asked and the waiter said \"let me see what I can find in the kitchen for you\" it was a clear giveaway that they expect their guest to east steak with the preset silverware?  LolGood sangria and wine selection.Their dessert selection is big but sadly not very good.I'd be shocked if they make anything in-house.Overall, this place has decent food and a lot of positives but definitely needs work.Some are no big deal, some (like my undercooked / raw steak) are simply unacceptable."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/spanish-tavern-newark?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
