Inside, it isn't so big, but clean, bright and colorful, with a beautiful mural of what else, donuts! You know how there are so many (cake) donut shops around... you know the drill, choose your own frosting, toppings, watch it get decorated, and devour? Well, it's the exact same concept, except these are MINI! Tiny! It takes 2-3 bites for me, but some people could just devour a whole mini donut at once, no doubt! There are the pre-selected flavors like:SamoaSnickers(There's one that looks JUST LIKE the Simpsons pink icing, Vanilla donut with sprinkles) Oh wait. It's actually called the \"Homer Simpson.\" LolBirthday CakeFrench Toast(So many more.)You can also of course, create your own. Choose your icing/frosting, and then toppings!Prices?

We also created some of our own including chocolate cake, cream cheese and M&M's and then a second with vanilla cake, maple icing, brownie bites and caramel sauce.

You can choose from advertised combinations or create your own. You can order boxes of various sizes. I love these. They are bite sized cake donuts with various toppings. I have a few favorites but whichever you select you can't go wrong. I wasn't sure how they would fare on the flight home but they made it safely. What I loved most is they don't frost the donuts until you make your order.

My favorite thing about this place is that you can literally customize every single donut in a box you get. There are so many opportunities to try all the signature flavors and crazy combinations-in one visit alone. We doubled up on most of ours. The sweet pigs were one of my favorites, who doesn't like crispy bacon on a tiny doughnut?! The samoas were also very yummy. The guy taking our order was very nice and patient with us since it was our first time there.

I was really excited to try this place but left underwhelmed. I ordered the French toast, cookies and cream, and the sweet pig: all safe choices for me. I thought I was setting myself up for an inevitably good experience. The French toast did not have much going for it, and since the doughnut itself lacked texture, the experience was lackluster. Ditto for the cookies and cream. The Oreos were not very crispy, a telltale sign that they are left to sit out too long when they should be sealed in an air-tight container. I find this is a common problem for any place that offers Oreos as a topping.The sweet pig suffered from the same foundational problem: the doughnut. It was soft but not in a pillowy, desirable way. It just kind of gave way when I bit into it, like eating an overcooked noodle. I will say the amount of toppings they give you for such small doughnuts is very generous. The sweet pig was literally dripping bacon. I liked that the bacon was a bit crispier than I've had in other locations. Nothing nauseates me more than biting into a bunch of pig fat. So kudos to MDF on this point. Due to the fact that I didn't like the actual doughnut, I took one bite and handed it off to my friend. It didn't seem worth finishing.The service was very friendly and speedy. No complaints there. And I felt like trying three mini doughnuts for under three dollars was a decent value. I wish they sold them in increments that made more sense. You can get 3, 6, and then it jumps straight to 16. Isn't a dozen standard? I checked the menu but didn't see pricing for single doughnuts. Another positive is that the finished doughnuts all come out looking very pretty. You can also customize your own, if you're feeling adventurous. (Someone ordered the sweet pig with sriracha on top!)Anyway, if I'm craving mini doughnuts, I'll probably head back to Little Doughnut House. The atmosphere was more open and bright, and they serve Buddy Brew, which I prefer over Doughnut brand coffee. Their doughnuts also had a nice vanilla flavor to them and were crispy and warm when served."}, {"review_id": "ll51sscrfUhxXOK17m2fRQ", "user_id": "XkA-GoiXM5Jo70x5C1S5cA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/21/2017", "text": "First of all, I love anything bite sized so I was so excited to try this place. When I first walked in the service was great! The people making the donuts greeted me then Zach at the register made me feel really welcome. I hadn't been there before so I asked his recommendations and he definitely steered me in the right direction. I ordered the camp fire, the sweet pig and a Nutella cinnamon that wasn't on the menu (thanks for the tip zach!). They were all amazing. The sweet pig was my favorite. I wish I could have tried everything but I love that because the donuts are mini there is opportunity to try different flavors! The location doesn't necessarily have a come hang here vibe so I took my donuts to go. I would definitely return, hopefully next time with more people so I could taste more flavors!"}, {"review_id": "6z4OvqEZv7VEJanMJGlnfQ", "user_id": "xznsEuFarn_6p1yBANBLMg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "What a cute idea! I mean who doesn't love mini anything?? Plus you can try a ton of different flavors without feeling bad about eating a ton of donuts. They have a ton of different flavors that you can choose from or options to create your own donut. Once you order, you can watch them add on all of the toppings in front of you! Since everything is made to order, it can take a little bit for the order to be ready if there are a ton of people ordering donuts. One of the flavors that I really liked was the samoa, which was done really well! It almost tasted like I was eating an actual samoa! The donuts themselves taste very fresh too! I also tried one of their iced coffees, just the normal one with a bit of cream and simple syrup, although they had a ton of different flavored syrups to put into the coffee. There was also a hazelnut syrup someone else in my group got that was really good. The coffee was just average and was way too sweet for me (i usually only add a little bit of sugar is any). Especially since my group got a ton of donuts, it would of been nice to just have coffee that wasn't too sweet since the donuts were already so sweet, but that was my fault for not specifying. When I went the place was packed and since there were only a couple of tables, we took everything to go. It's a pretty small place so its better to enjoy your donuts elsewhere instead of feeling rushed. Overall, definitely go for the donuts! It's a fun experience even if they are a little pricy."}, {"review_id": "ViviQxUkv3NkY5P82C8xkA", "user_id": "4gMd6vOxzm9mdgtKidSnlw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "When I moved to Tampa 6 years ago I kept wishing there was a great place to grab donuts......well my wish was granted!!

Even though there may be a long line at times I don't mind very much because it's fun to watch each little treat be created. Having a little bit of a wait gives me time to decide what to order as well, there are tons of options and they are all....and I really mean all..delicious. If I had to pick a favorite it would be the maple bacon one, I mean they put one of my favorite food on top of another one of my favorite foods!These doughnuts are great for every occasion. Perfect for bringing in to work, everyone is always super excited to grab a few flavors. I even stacked them up to make a birthday cake recently and it was a huge hit. They are always devoured immediately and I have learned to hide a few for myself to ensure I get to have one.In short: If you haven't had these donuts yet you haven't lived!"}, {"review_id": "Hg2EeTO3ZFseO_066NK0LQ", "user_id": "jgibjFWtRPncDmJqfKpyMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/29/2017", "text": "Ever go to the doughnut shop and can't decide which flavor to get!?

I've been a couple of times and it never disappoints. It's kind of a small area. They have a few high top tables and a few couches, but for the most part it's a grab and go type of place.

Sweet pig - can adding bacon on anything ever be a bad idea? Yes, this donut is worth the hype. Homer Simpson - strawberry frosting with sprinkles -- a classic - and a very clever name to it. Camp fire - another clever name. Marshmallow drizzle on top of crushed graham crackers and chocolate frosting. All were delicious!
