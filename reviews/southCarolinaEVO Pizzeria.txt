Being the dog tender, I never saw the inside but hear it's cozy. Everyone seems to have their own idea of the definition of a great pizza. My definition is spelled E-V-O. We all had nothing but ooo's and ahhh's for every bite of a variety of pies. Make sure you notice the special of the day! Ours was onion & spicy sausage. Quite likely the best pizza I've eaten. We also loved the speck & mushrooms and the pancetta & tomatoes. There was not one bite left. Be sure to also check out the snack plate. Great start to a fantastic meal. Awesome selection of local beer in bottles or draft. Perfect service from start to finish."}, {"review_id": "EaGXiN6KJfe2pR7o0TCPLQ", "user_id": "QvJNbPn8BlY2A6BoUZ-MoA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Evo Pizzera in Park Circle has some of the best pizza in the area that I have had. Was here this past weekend and we split the arrabbiata & ricotta pizza and the pancetta & tomatoes pizza; both were delicious, and the arrabbiata & ricotta had a kick of spiciness to it. Very delightful. Evo also had quite a few crafts on draft, as well as in the bottle and can; including lots of local crafts. I had few different beers that were all good. Service was great! Not only did our server take great care of us; she made sure our glasses never went empty. Next time I'm craving a wood fired pizza Evo will be my go to."}, {"review_id": "Dzq-3n2Aq06ImBzGuDpMRw", "user_id": "zyab2qsMarU5bGjhRL7syw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "The food at EVO is amazing! We visited a few years ago and decided we should visit again, glad we did. Hubs started with a Palmetto Mango IPA, so good he had 2! We tried the farm salad with bacon and it was delicious!! Perfect ratio of everything. Hubby had the cheese calzone and it was great...I usually don't care for them. I had a pepperoni and extra  mozzarella pizza. The pizza was super rich. I'm not sure if it's normal but the crust was so soggy that liquid just poured off of it and it couldn't be picked up. Normally I would hv sent it back to the kitchen but considering it tasted so good soggy, I ate it anyway. The only reason I cut a star was service. It left a lot to be desired. Simple things like not coming back to the table...at all, having to fetch our own napkins, not refilling drinks... it was bad. EVO is still a place we will consider on our next trip to Charleston."}, {"review_id": "Eg9CaxTrlcHJ6OfewccL7Q", "user_id": "pDrfyO4cVfcYhZq97ii_Ow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "I've been wanting to try EVO for years now, just never find myself in the park circle area. After shopping at the outlets, it was the perfect opportunity to take the quick drive.Didn't have any issues with parking for 2pm on a Saturday which was nice. Was greeted right away by the host and seated. While we were looking over the drink menu the host actually asked if she could get us some water while we decided. I thought that was excellent service! Ordered beers and the waitress brought pint glasses for our cans which was nice as well. Ordered the pistachio pesto pizza 12\" with a side of red sauce. The side of red sauce is an extra dollar which I originally thought was a little pricey but they give you a good amount and it's 100% worth it! The pizza came out hot and fresh and looked amazing! I would order this pizza over and over again. It exceeded my expectations and I totally understand why they get so many 5 star reviews.Overall, it was a great, delicious experience and would recommend this place to anyone in the park circle or outlet area!"}, {"review_id": "tqKFHGpRlLyZuazKvFPZcA", "user_id": "Ku6kM8PmU3dd_ORJggBdNQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Great atmosphere and good pizza.

This also makes for a perfect margherita pizza! The paintings were also very appealing, as I thought the local artist had very smart color choices for their palette, making true originals. Would love to know if the artist had an Instagram. Furthermore, they have this cool initiative where they put out croissants, breads, and cookies from their bakery in the back for personal donations to a monthly changing non-profit. This month was for Charleston's Animal Society.The sugar cookies did vary from day to day, first being soft and then the next day over cooked but both days were still yummy since the batter was sugary goodness. The salad was good, very acidic and characteristic of the south. I will say that the addition of the watermelon radish didn't seem helpful, since a different veggie (like regular radishes) are easier to pick up with a fork and give essentially the same taste."}, {"review_id": "eDT_ebVit8oPEX93wCb2Ww", "user_id": "6H4Zj-c7FqM9mCsXvwaEQw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "I had EVO in my bookmarks since arriving in Charleston last summer.  I do enjoy Napoli style pizza and was intrigued when I saw the unique pizzas they had especially the Pistachio Pesto pizza.  I knew that was what I was going to get before even arriving at the restaurant.  I came for lunch arriving right at noon and despite being pretty busy we were quickly seated.   The server came shortly after we were seated for drink orders and was surprised when I knew already what I wanted for my lunch.  I came on a mission to get the Pistachio Pizza and didn't let the many other selections they have on the menu distract me.  Within 10 minutes my pizza arrived.  It was cooked perfectly with the cheese being melted the way I prefer.  The crust was thin and very crunchy and the taste was unique and delicious.  The cheese and the pistachio flavors came through equally making this a really special treat.     The inside is nicely decorated with a rustic feel.  The restaurant was very clean and the service was very good.  I look forward to my next visit and trying more of the unique pizzas."}, {"review_id": "HX8C_T7MQ9KIyIHWj0A8eg", "user_id": "b9DR1fb4mrpFBZlspKw32Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "I went to Evo Pizzeria with extremely high expectations based on the reviews and articles stating it's the best pizza in SC. I left very disappointed; there was nothing bad about the food but it was nothing special. I personally think even Mellow Mushroom has better pizza than EVO. Upon arrival, there was a few minute wait; the hostess didn't seem to be super happy about working. We ordered the focaccia bread as an appetizer; it was very fresh but lacked any flavor. Three of us ordered the 12\" pork trifecta pizza and the 12\" speck and fennel pizza. I personally liked the speck and fennel better but the others in my group liked the pork trifecta better. The speck and fennel pizza had burnt crust on 1/2 of it. They were good but I don't see myself returning as there are other places with better pizza, especially for the price. Our server was extremely nice and attentive throughout the meal. It's a good place if you are in the area craving thin-crust pizza but I don't recommend going out of your way for it."}, {"review_id": "DnplhRb_Zb_F-_Kk1nfo4Q", "user_id": "F1RAjIuWQSS6hE9LolD8fg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "Pistachio pesto pizza--that's all I'm gonna say! SOO good! Great local spot for casual dining. People usually eat outside with their dogs. We opted to eat inside :) We've sat at the bar a few times and at tables depending on how many in our party. The last time I ate there it was the best yet! I ALWAYS get the pistachio pesto pizza. It is absolutely delicious and unexpected. My husband gets the pork trifecta. This time, the special was a starter of oven roasted olives & garlic. Really good! I got a seasonal summer salad with all kinds of things in it, including bacon, I want to say barley or some sort of wheat that you would not expect in a salad and watermelon radishes. Really good!

I ordered a salad as an appetizer and it was amazing!! Fresh ingredients on both the salad and pizza. The pizza was soooo good, the dough was fresh and you can tell it it was made in a brick oven.

They all sounded amazing but we decided to go with the pistachio pesto and the chicken and collards... they were both absolutely incredible! I think the chicken and collard pizza may be the best pizza I've ever had, it has such amazing flavor, if you like collard greens you've got to try it for sure. While we were still in he middle of eating our pizza last night my husband asked if we could go back to EVO tomorrow for lunch, so clearly he was a big fan as well.

We picked Evo because it has great reviews and it is central, so easy to get to from across the metropolitan Charleston area. I used to be the Communications/PR person for the paper mill and chemical plants around the corner so I'm very familiar with this area. I have a great fondness for the area and the former company, not the corporation that owned the mill, but the people who worked there. What a great place and such a contributor to the community. Anyway, back to Evo. I love how this little part of old North Charleston has evolved...it feels like a little enclave and is reminiscent of the way other communities used to be, like Mt Pleasant and James Island. So happy this area exists. Evo is a perfect representation of what draws people to the area. This is a pizza place, but with a southern twist. I suggest the pimento goat cheese...I didn't know you could improve upon goat cheese or pimento cheese, but this mashup is sublime. Add some pickled green tomatoes, pickles and some crusty toasted bread and you've got a winner. You can't go wrong with the pizzas. We picked a margarita pizza and added soppressata. It was really good! If you're into beer and wine, they had a good selection. The servers are well versed and can make a recommendation based on your tastes."}, {"review_id": "eTylNRdaUC3lgDtk_fM3BA", "user_id": "BYcnq26C1ZToZ_6rvZCnww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Wow, this place is delicious!

Right in the heart of old town North Charleston in Park Circle, this restaurant has recently been deemed best pizza in the state of SC! Evo offers delicious varieties of flatbread style pizza and other options such as hearty salads, tapas style olive appetizers and more. They only serve local craft beers which makes it feel even more like a Charleston institution! Cool atmosphere with a rustic feel and always good service. They have a speciality sandwich that is out of this world although it's rarely on their menu - the duck club! Outrageously good! Make sure you order it if it's on the menu! All of their pizzas are amazing, I usually order a custom pizza and go meat lovers! I work about 5 minutes down the road and always recommend this place to my clients for a great experience.

Because this is as good as pizza gets.   ---   ---   ---Our final meal for our trip to Charleston proved to be a really good one. I had actually visited a couple days prior for a beer, and the beer selection was really solid. It was a Friday night and the atmosphere was buzzing, which was cool to see, because our lunch was on a lazy Sunday afternoon. EVO felt equally appropriate under both scenarios, so in addition to making a mean pizza pie, it's a bit of a swiss army knife for any occasion. But for what people really care about - the pizza? It's bad ass. Did I mention that?I've had brick oven pizza that's absolutely incredible, and I've had it where it leaves a lot to be desired. As a matter of fact, I can think of two places that the pizza was amazing on my first visit, and well below average on my second. Apparently, it's super hard to master the cooking of a pizza in a coal oven. On our particular visit to EVO, they definitely mastered it. We ordered the pork trifecta, thanks to Scotty C's recommendation, and he kept his streak alive of offering perfect advice. I don't know what they put in their pies, but it's some of the best pizza I've ever had."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/evo-pizzeria-north-charleston?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
