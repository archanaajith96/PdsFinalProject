It is a hidden southwest Las Vegas gem, and I am lucky enough to have it right behind my house. Warning: this place gets BUSY! They will have an hour wait on a random weeknight. During happy hour you must make a reservation or good luck getting a table. My only complaint is they typically don't have a lot of servers working so service does get extremely slow during busy hours. I've often had to wait a while to even be greeted by a server or have my food delivered to me. Plan to spend some time at Soho. It looks like a hole in the wall but it's gorgeous inside and a good atmosphere. They have TVs playing sports. It's the only place we can catch Dodger games around here! Also, though the same company I believe, don't mix this up with the sushi burrito place. That's across the street, and this is much better and different, in my opinion. Otherwise, the experience is to die for. The food is absolutely amazing. They even have one of the best lunch specials...so much food for such a good price. But happy hour is definitely my guilty pleasure. A menu full of $5 bites and drinks. The portions are pretty big, shareable among two. I love the carpaccio, the ribs, the rolls, the Brussels sprouts, there's really nothing I don't like on the happy hour menu. But please try the ribs, you won't regret it. Also, my favorite treat is the green tea brulee. It is so good and unique."}, {"review_id": "_v6w57O-qSAN1Un7zKFieQ", "user_id": "E63DvbIQptvI05F63F1Bdg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Great sushi spot off the strip! Always leave full and happy! The location is great because this is a locals only spot!Their menu has a lot of great things and then has some ehh things as well but overall delicious!Any of their sushi is awesome! I love their albacore sushi, yellowtail jalapeño, salmon sushi, and their cucumber salad! I love a good miso black cod and saw it on the menu, so I ordered it. Unfortunately it was not up to my standards but that was the only thing that was up to par. It was very dry (I like it fall apart moist) and it came like in 3 tacos? Weird. But our waiter let us return it and get something else which was VERY sweet.They also open at 11 and have a great lunch menu and \"bento\" lunch options so you get more bang for your buck!!!"}, {"review_id": "_o7Y3J_vdOxJOePeCmhesg", "user_id": "7kM0cE5UfCirNA2it1O2Qg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "AMAZING!Decided to check this place out for their happy hour which was an awesome deal esp the pricing! Went for date night - pretty casual place but very busy! We went around 6:45pm so we caught the HH just in time and opted to sit at the bar. There were so many options to choose from for a HH menu so we were quite surprised. I don't remember all of the things we got but the pics can do the talking! The yellowtail sashimi w/the gold edible flakes was the most memorable and prettiest dish there! There was an older couple next to us who ordered the omakase (sp?) and we thought the gold flakes on some of the nigiri pieces looked so pretty with how they presented the dish! I don't remember the name of the chef at the bar but he was the one who hooked us up with the yellowtail sashimi dish for us since we were first timers - thanks!!! Overall everything we ordered was pretty good, wished we had room for dessert but we'll deff try the next time we decide to go!"}, {"review_id": "kEUqDVwz6gOs_Y8hM2AU5g", "user_id": "oy-K-bNNFy2O9rwKC3dteQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Most people do not expect to find decent sushi in a landlocked city, especially one that is more renowned for things that are...well, not sushi. I was certainly part of that demographic, and was only drawn to Soho by their Happy Hour menu, which boasted over 30 small plates for $5 each, along with over a dozen drink specials.With that many options, I also couldn't help wonder if it was one of those \"quantity over quality\" type of deals, but I had faith in the exceedingly positive Yelp reviews, which were absolutely on point!A few Happy Hour dishes and infused sakes later, the other menu items started to look more and more enticing (who could resist the allure of Hokkaido uni?!). We ended up venturing beyond the HH menu, adding several nigiri sushi, Kumamoto oysters, and the Firefly Squid to our order. I'm all about trying new fish and got to try akamutsu (black sea perch) sushi for the first time!Excellent food at reasonable prices, friendly and attentive service, plus a fantastic happy hour are all hallmarks of the Soho experience. I will definitely be returning on my next sojourn in Vegas.TLDR: One of the best Happy Hours I've had, and the regular menu delivers some pretty solid sushi as well!

Soho does it flawlessly. I'd give 6 out of 5 stars if I could. My guy and I came by on a Saturday for Happy Hour -- offered Monday through Saturday from 3pm to 7pm. We arrived around 4:50pm and didn't have to wait. By the time 5:30pm rolled around, though, there were several groups of guests waiting for a table. Apparently, making a reservation is the way to go around here. Right away, we knew we'd have a great meal. We arrived famished and fell in love with the dozens of options on the Happy Hour menu. Rolls, carpaccios, appetizers, and drinks are all up for grabs. All of the food items are $5 each -- and great sizes! -- and most of the drinks are $5 or $6. A few things to keep in mind -- this is a place to go to if you genuinely like raw fish. A lot of the menu features raw items and creative garnishes, so this might not be the place to try something completely out of your element. Also, expect the sashimi slices in the carpaccios to be small and thin. Fresh, but skinny. Lastly -- I have to say Soho has the best sauces ever. Seriously. You won't find basic ponzu, eel sauce, and spicy mayo junk at Soho. Instead, you'll enjoy the likes of Yuzu mascarpone creme, creamy ponzu, avocado creme, and truffle oil. Here's what we ordered...TROPICAL SAKE, PASSION FRUIT MANGO- $6 for a small-sized carafe. - Sweet and fruity, just how I love it. No strong sake taste. - Cold, alcoholic drink.  - Guava flavor is also available.GINGER HAMACHI- Yellowtail with slices of jalapeno and fried pork rinds. - Never had crispy pork rinds on raw fish, but I loved it. I've been missing out. - Not on the happy hour menu. - One of my favorites of the evening!SALMON CARPACCIO- Features Yuzu mascarpone creme, shallots, and diced tomatoes. - The flavor just works, and I was so weary of cheese and salmon. - Fresh, light taste. - So good, we got it twice. - Another favorite of the evening. ANGUS BEEF TATAKI- Seared steak with shallots, chives, garlic, olive oil, and ponzu. - Tastes a lot like seared tuna tataki. Similar texture, too. - Compared to everything else, this was the least memorable. Everything else we ordered was just so much better. CAJUN ALBACORE SASHIMI- Comes on a bed of daikon radish, soaked in sauce. - Creamy ponzu sauce is unlike anything I've ever had. So rich and flavorful. SALMON AVOCADO CREME- Dressed up with avocado creme, pico de gallo, cilantro, and ponzu. - The avocado is subtle, but offers an excellent sweetness to each bite. - Cute take on ceviche. SALMON AVOCADO ROLL- 8 good-sized pieces. - Basic item, but yummy and filling because of the rice. - Can't go wrong with a classic!SPICY TUNA DIP- Basically, a spicy tuna tartare with taro chips instead of wonton chips. - The spicy tuna is a legitimate tartare mix, not the average spicy tuna that goes in a roll. SO GOOD. INFUSED COLD SAKE, WHITE PEACH- $5 for a small-sized carafe.- Stronger sake taste, but still a nice fruity flavor. - Cold, alcoholic drink. - Lychee flavor is also available. BAKED MUSSELS- 6 large pieces. - Yuzu dynamite sauce with ponzu, scallions, and tobiko. - Great, easy option to share. Overall, an excellent meal. My guy and I agree that this was the best Happy Hour experience we can remember. Bonus -- ample parking, as the restaurant is situated in a plaza. Also, the employees are great and helpful. There's a dozen people working in the open kitchen, busy creating masterpieces and shouting \"Soho!\" at incoming patrons. Whether you're a local or a tourist, come here!!"}, {"review_id": "KW0KHZRLv93ltUbMkG-ILA", "user_id": "bwb5__1-m0qFmIUySceUwA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "We came here on a Saturday night and the service was beyond expectations.

Other than that, no complaints about my dining experience here.Happy hour here is legit! Rolls are 6-8 pieces and they offer sashimi and carpaccio for only $5. Baked mussels: mussels were on the bigger side and I thought they were average. At least they weren't over cooked and super chewy. Cajun albacore sashimi: one of my favorite dishes but it seems like they add daikon? on everything and the sauce was a bit too much. Nonetheless, still a good amount and I usually don't like albacore but I enjoyed this dish.Kalbi ribs: would not order again. It was one rib cut into 4-5 pieces and was a little on the burnt side. Flavor was still good though, but I'd rather buy it at Greenland market and grill it myself.Ika geso: 3 pieces of grilled squid which my friends enjoyed but I didn't have any. Spicy tuna roll: average roll but it was super spicy! My friends can usually handle spicy but they even commented on how it's on the spicier side. Crispy Brussels sprouts: would not order again. The Brussels sprout was practically falling apart so we got more leaves than the actual Brussels sprout. I wasn't a fan of the sauce because it was a bit on the sour side and I felt that the sprouts weren't crispy as we had hoped.Mixed tempura : crispy tempura pieces which came with 2 shrimp tempera and 3 other veggie pieces. The sweet potato piece that I had was still undercooked so it was on the hard side. I probably wouldn't order it again.Salmon carpaccio: another one of my favorites. 5 pieces of salmon with some toppings and arugula on top. Again, they overdid it with the sauce but luckily the sauce wasn't too overpowering or salty. Seafood dynamite roll (with no cream cheese): I think it's a deep fried roll with a ton of daikon and arugula on top. I wasn't a huge fan because I could hardly taste any fish.  Probably will not order again.Salmon avocado roll: average roll. I think their rolls  are a little smaller than usual rolls but it's because they don't pack on a ton of rice. Salmon to rice ratio was perfect and they didn't skimp on the avocado! My friend also tried their uni, 2 big pieces ($10), he said it was one of the best he's had. Great place to come for some quality sushi, especially for happy hour!"}, {"review_id": "K48xmXHoUxL7Jub2Bsqc1w", "user_id": "XEH2VtVx5ZYATKEM4jZOXg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "I had lunch at Soho Japanese Restaurant and i was impressed!

Geez... There was at least 3 tables put together for a huge group! The food is still fresh and amazing. Like I can still order my favorite Golden Ocean Trout. It's great surprise to go back every couple months and realize that they switched the menu up too, which are mostly items on the Happy Hour menu.

I came during happy hour on a Friday night. I sometimes come for the lunch specials tooIf I remember correctly it's Monday to Saturday from 5 to 7 for their happy hour menu. It was basically about 5 bucks a plate. Some varied but the stuff we ordered was in that range. Didn't take a photo of all our food. Since it's happy hour the portion is a tad smaller so we ordered about 5 plates to share. Mix tempura: red bell pepper, two shrimp tempura, onion, and I think a zucchini. This was good. I didn't notice an overly extended amount of batter. Baked muscles: these were good! They had Yuzu sauce or some ponzu sauce in it that made the flavors balance out and it didn't feel as heavy because of the sauce. Crispy brussel sprout: yummmm!! The mixture of textures, nice n crispy, they had some nuts in it for a bite. And the sauce in the middle, not even sure what it was but it was BOMB. Spider roll and spicy salmon roll. I like how they put these little crunchy balls on top of the rolls. I'm not sure how to describe the taste but added crunch. As always fish is fresh! Can't forget that Infused sake! Lychee is my favorite one. Mmmmm. Their lunch specials are pretty good too.

My friend and I had been wanting to come here for a while as we haven't been here for years. I randomly decided to ask her to come with me to dinner one afternoon and here this experience went. Lol Unfortunately, it was a day it rains in Vegas (as we all know, that doesn't happen often). I had got off work from a far hospital at 530ish, but due to the rain, it took a while for both of us to arrive at the restaurant. It was pretty busy at the restaurant and a lot of people waiting. I had asked the hostess what would happen if our wait for a table exceeds the time limit of happy hour (which was the main reason we wanted to come, and had come many times in the past), she had assured us that we will still receive the happy hour pricing, even if it passes the time. Great news as we would have been sad lol. I am not sure when they changed the times, but the happy hour now goes from 0400P - 0700P. Supposedly they take reservations now. Had i known earlier, i would have called. But as stated, it worked out anyway. After waiting a while, we had finally got a table maybe at 0645P. After we were seated, we had the happy hour menus. They seemed to have added some stuff since my last visit. Aside from the food, they offer beers/sake/sangria as cheap as $3 and wines at $5. SOHO Wings includes choice of garlic Parmesan, yuzu miso, or nutty habenero. I had asked for yuzu miso. Not as what i expected. It is mildly sweet with a very light hint of miso. The batter seems a bit \"thick\", not in actual thickness but it not being that light in texture. I'm still on the hunt for the best fried chicken in town, that can match the korean fried chicken in LA or Seoul. XD We had also tried the Firecracker roll because i had remembered there was a happy hour item that had crispy rice. This definitely was not it. Lol The firecracker roll states it includes deep fried, spicy tuna, jalapeno, cream cheese, and sweet onions. Neither of us like cream cheese in our sushi, so we opt'ed out of that. This was literally a deep fried spicy tuna roll topped with sweet onions and jalapeno. Wonder what the crispy rice one which resembles the crispy rice you get from like a dolsot bibimbap or those clay pot rice. Mildly weird with the sweet pickled-like onions on top. Typically our favorites from the old happy hour menu are the tostadas for a dollar and salmon avocado roll. Very simple items but yummy. The tostadas as previously made, were individual tostada chips with a good amount of toppings (salmon, tuna, octopus, or yellowtail). Now, the \"SOHO Tostada\" is a choice of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, or mixed seafood. They used to be simply made, with simple seasoning and ingredients. Tuna was very similar to hawaiian poke. Now, instead of individual topped tostadas, the fish of choice is placed in a small bowl in the middle of a plate with 5 tostada chips surrounding. You do get about the same amount of topping as you used to, if not more, but i feel like they add a lot of things to \"brighten\" it up like pineapples, etc. Still tasty but would have preferred how it used to be. Soho was known to use fresh fish so unsure why all the \"extra\" is needed. Best and simplest item is still the salmon avocado rolls. 8 pieces per order. Simply delicious. Nothing to be said. Fresh fishOverall, glad they extended the happy hour but unfortunately even if I can get off at 4pm, most dont get off till at least 6. But i think happy hour runs into the weekend too, which i dont think they offered before (dont quote me on this, call to confirm....)I used to get this ghost pepper chili sauce the owner/chef used to make. Unsure if this is still available. A previous time i had tried to ask for it and they said they didn't have it or didn't make it anymore. Overall, love their happy hour. Good for dinner or just a snack.
