You won't be disappointed! For two people we got a mini jerk chicken entree, mini curry chicken entree, one double and one aloo pie. Jerk chicken and curry chicken were tender and not dry. Rice and beans were a perfect side to go with the chicken. Wish I had gotten another double because that was *amazing*. Bread is tender and stuffed with curried chickpeas. Food was more than enough for two very hungry people! We actually ended up saving the aloe pie for the next day because we were stuffed. The hot sauces that accompanied the meal are no joke so beware if you're not used to eating scotch bonnet peppers There is limited parking in front of the restaurant but plenty of street parking. Owner and staff are very friendly. You can tell the owner puts his heart and soul into the restaurant! Looks like things are pretty much made to order so it may take longer than your usual take away spot but it is so worth it!"}, {"review_id": "LpnwmrgJA-JbvE33mh1eYw", "user_id": "UAEgIqx3QvMbJm3zgH8Jig", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Decided to try this spot since it's close to work but I'm sorry I did.

This is a small place not a great place to sit and eat i would suggest a place for takeout. Two people were on the counter to take order they were prompt and pleasant. I tried the double which is a roti with chickpea curry filling  which was really good proper spices and taste. They had a proper blend for the chickpea curry this place has many Indian flavors. Stew chicken with white rice and yellow dal as an mini entree for 6.50$ which is reasonable and proper for one person's meal. They have strong odor of used oil at this place I would prefer anyone to order online rather than waiting there. Overall it's a must try place good food low prices."}, {"review_id": "LPV6rZ281pnufuQs9M_UvA", "user_id": "qX0hDoRVni6c1SlvDpnQ3g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/2/2017", "text": "Randomly stopped here to pick up lunch while passing through Connecticut. The place looks like it's mostly for pick because there are only a few tables. Food was surprisingly interesting, huge portion for the roti wraps. We got the jerk shrimp and the veggie roti. I would say getting the smallest roti is better because this thing is very filling and heavy. It was a little difficult driving after eating because we got the \"itus\" after sharing just own roti! Good and interesting food for a decent price. This place also has some Trinidadian snacks available to purchase."}, {"review_id": "T1Vnp-Oody_QjYss3kd_QA", "user_id": "4zvAovIdYtuCOEgCKIex6A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Stop here every time I'm in Bridgeport.  Usually get the goat or chicken curry food is awesome makes you feel like you're on the island so authentic and good.  Definitely take out though it gets so hot in the whole place I couldn't imagine eating there"}, {"review_id": "0-MtYf2gG8oCxDAOY0Acog", "user_id": "1MzJqnbpceC2SmoT64oK3A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/8/2017", "text": "Always enjoy the food!

I've been here only twice after a long time of wanting to try it out. I definitely know I will be back when the craving strikes. First time I had the curry chicken inside the buss up shot and it was perfect. I'm usually meh when it comes to curry chicken but I decided to take a chance and try and I was very pleasantly surprised. Chicken is seasoned perfectly and tender. The potatoes were even better. It was seasoned so well my whole car smelled like food. I love the softness of the buss up shot. The next time I came I tried jerk chicken roti wrap and it was amazingly good. Seasoned perfectly and I like the Potato that they add in it. To be honest when I was eating I was looking for pieces of potato more than the meat and that's surprising. I like the buss up shot better than the regular roti."}, {"review_id": "lLXeSVUoLa45KmQghynlRA", "user_id": "tnI8MbONXQLX5Nt7cffXLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/27/2017", "text": "This place doesn't look like much, but it's perhaps the best roti I've ever had. Get the bussed up shot with your roti. Their homemade hot sauce is pretty great as well -- it's pretty spicy though (habanero-based and spicier than Sriracha). They'll put it on the side if you ask.I was also pleased to see that they have vegetarian Jamaican patties! They were delicious as well."}, {"review_id": "fim82_iX4uG0QOYgKAh-2Q", "user_id": "AY_cjY1bRAD-I_K11dYvOA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/4/2017", "text": "I drove 45 minutes  to pick up my order.

One day I had a strong craving for double. I took to my Yelp family to give me some pointers. I found this place not too far away and decided to give it a try. It was delicious. I have gone several times and have taken my family with me. The drinks are great. We love every meal we have tried. We have enjoyed this cuisine in the best of places including Trinidad and Tobago. I am pleased with my experience and feel blessed to have found this gem."}, {"review_id": "InhyGFNjNg7ZpZGyzsJtgA", "user_id": "QTlwFuYI8W0OKjYuCRkHrA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/15/2017", "text": "I had never had Trinidadian food before, so this was an amazing introduction! There are a lot of Indian influences, which made me very happy, as Indian is one of my favorite cuisines. My husband picked up the order and said that it appears to be a takeout-only operation. We had the doubles and aloo pie appetizers, which were messy, but delicious. Doubles (description from their menu) is a sandwich made with two bar (light and thin fried bread) filled with savory curried chick peas. Aloo pie is a soft fried pastry made from flour and filled with spiced mashed potatoes. Both very flavorful and hearty - the kind of vegetarian food in which you don't miss meat at all. Our entrées were a whole red snapper fried to crispy perfection with a slightly sweet sauce with minced vegetables and a melting-off-the-bones oxtail. Both were served with a cabbage medley. We had one with rice and split-pea dal and the other with Trinidad rice, a sort of fried rice pulao. We also ordered a side of buss up shut roti, a variation on paratha.The service was really nice, too, starting with the phone order and ending with the pick-up. The prices were very reasonable and the portions were extremely generous - we had leftovers that I'm looking forward to having for lunch. Bobby's is a wonderful addition to the Bridgeport food scene and I hope that they prosper for a long time."}, {"review_id": "MmZi_bW3op-MXzTKHKHFxQ", "user_id": "HvzYnpPGvlaYAd7UllJiPg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "8/31/2017", "text": "Just moved to Connecticut from NYC.

It said it will take 2 hrs, I'm like okay, Things in CT work a bit slower then back in NY, I was okay with that. 2 hrs and a half passed so I decided to contact seamless and they told me that they never check their system and they never saw my order. So for that Bobby V's you guys get one star if I could I would give you a 0.

He was born and raised in Trinidad and I fell in love with his native cuisine. we drove down from Maine to try! Unfortunately, we were sadly disappointed. The meat we got on our plate was dry, rice tasted old and under cooked still crunchy. Even one of  my favorite foods the plantains were burnt. Another favorite of ours (we make at home) macaroni pie was 4 dollars, which was a small corner piece. Shrimp Roti was good however, over powered with so much potato and little shrimp. Also they were all out of solo soda :( My husband was no impressed with any of the food just not worth the long trip."}, {"review_id": "SZTAONBwuQzGoX6AAShDiw", "user_id": "P2Fb-2XtwPkQN-guB_AeBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2017", "text": "Followed Yelp and Trip Advisor reviews for the first of what will be many trips back here. Fresh roti wraps, perfect spices and island hospitality right here in Bridgeport. Make sure to try the chutneys and the drinks, like Island Moss, Peanut Butter and almond milk and the Sorrel.
