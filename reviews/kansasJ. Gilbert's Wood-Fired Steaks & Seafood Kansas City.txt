Gibert's is a chain restaurant, but most people probably don't realize this.  It has 4 other locations in somewhat odd places - Washington DC, St. Louis, Columbus, OH, and Connecticut.  It's almost as if they have a rich owner that said, \"I want to build a restaurant in all my favorite cities.\"  Their food and service rivals any other high quality chain steakhouse such as Ruth's Chris, Morton's, Smith and Wollensky, or Del Frisco's - and it's better than The Palm or most Shula's locations.The menu begins and ends with great steaks - prime quality and wood fired.  The flavor of the wood smoke is wonderful and they always nail the whole medium rare / medium thing.  In my experience, when I order medium rare at a restaurant it frequently comes out too rare, and when I order medium it's too well done.  Medium here was perfect for me, with a nice pink center, tender with tons of flavor.With the great steaks on the menu, it's seems strange for me to say my wife's favorite item is an appetizer - the blue cheese chips.  They are homemade potato chips with blue cheese crumbles and a blue cheese sauce with onions either drizzled over the top or served on the side.  She loves it.We often share a Caesar salad, served soaking in dressing which is just the way we like it, but probably not good if you're on a diet.  The complimentary sourdough bread has great \"sour\" taste, firm texture, and is hefty enough for four people to share.  The bread comes with whipped butter and another container of \"smoky butter\" with a few other seasonings mixed in.  The smoky butter is not bad on the bread, but it's absolutely fantastic on the steaks.The sides are also wonderful and some are cooked on the same wood grill as the prime black angus steaks.  The grilled asparagus is particularly good.  The creamed corn seemed to be made from corn that was just scraped off the cobb (lots of kernels were stuck together) which I assume means it was very fresh, at least it certainly tasted that way.   All the desserts are homemade.  We recently had the cheesecake (which they gave us for free because I told them we were celebrating my wife's birthday when we made the reservation) and it was tall and delicious.   Our server was Dave and he was on top of everything during our entire visit, anticipating our needs, filling our glasses, making great suggestions, with a wonderful sense of humor - he was top notch, one of the best servers we've ever had.The dark old-school interior creates a romantic atmosphere, but doesn't feel outdated like many other older steakhouses.  The booths are comfortable and are arranged in such a way that it's very private - it's a great date place or also a good location to take high level corporate clients.  As a Yelper, it's kind of a bummer because there isn't enough light to take very good pictures, at least not with my phone/camera.It's a perfect place to celebrate anniversaries, your sweetheart's birthday, or any other special occasion.  But you don't have to wait for a special occasion because they have a reasonable Prix-Fix menu which includes a soup or salad, entree, and dessert all for one set price, and they also have a few chicken items and Wagyu burgers on the menu.   J. Gilbert's isn't cheap, but if you sign up for their mailing list they'll email coupons to you on a regular basis including an initial coupon for a free entree worth up to $25 which makes their prices much easier on your wallet.  With all the coupons they have sent us, my wife says - we can't afford not to go!"}, {"review_id": "omR-CmcmiwCCwVHwYBR-0g", "user_id": "d4vqfqDzNFvYppXMPjJrow", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "This place doesn't get my top rating, but it is still a worthy place for a great steak!The service was good, the place was clean - plenty of parking and both selection and service was good - price was a bit high!I would surely return to this place!"}, {"review_id": "nvSz679bNw-5fHcvedwtzg", "user_id": "H8k6YdPV6H7w0s9uijNjDw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "J.

Walked in & was greeted by the 2 Hostess & they were very nice & polite. We decided to hit the bar for a drink while we wait for our table. There wasn't a whole lot of cocktails that looked appealing to me so I stuck to my usual Moscow Mule. The lady bartender was great. After we got our drink our table was ready. We were seated & presumed to order. I got the Bourbon Salmon with the wedge salad & creme brûlée on the RW menu. We were given very warm & moist bread which was so soft & yummy! Waiter was nice & polite. Food came out in good timing. The Bourbon Salmon wasn't the best I've tasted but it was still good. Cooked perfect too! The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because The silverware & glassware had watermarks on them. Also, the handle of the copper mug smelled tarnished. Luckily, I carry hand sanitizer everywhere I go. Overall, it was a good first time experience.

Gilbert's, I had heard a ton of great things about their steaks from many of my KC-lifer co-workers.  They had lauded J. Gilbert's as the best steakhouse in town, but \"sshhh, it's a consensus only amongst locals!\" so I had to give it a try.  I've been to a couple other steakhouses here in the KC area, so I know how tough the competition is out here.  Can J. Gilbert's really top them all?Appetizer: Jumbo Crab Cakes.  Just...do it.  Seriously.  They're pricey ($19), but hey, who goes to a steakhouse to save money anyway?  I'm not a big crab cake kinda guy, but these are the best I've ever had.  The cakes are large and filled with flavor, but not overwhelming to the point of getting stuffed.  Easily best cooked seafood appetizer I've had since my time in the Northeast. Oh, and as a side side side note, you get a free loaf of warm, tasty bread and butter, which may suffice as your appetizer.  But seriously, you should really get the crab cakes.Steak: My girlfriend and I both ordered the filet mignon.  I got the 8oz, she got the 6oz.  Both cooked medium.  Now here's where J. Gilbert loses a star.  Mine was ordered medium, but clearly came out medium-well, while her's came out a perfect medium in the center.  Now, I understand cooking steaks is an art and fudge-ups can happen sometimes, and fortunately I can tolerate medium-well steaks since that used to be my go-to, and the steak was full of delicious flavor nonetheless. However, the best steakhouses in town--and anywhere, for that matter--have the meat-cooking down to perfection.  J. Gilbert's steaks are competitive with their meat quality, but they're sub-par in terms of preparation.Sides:  I got the mashed potatoes and asparagus; girlfriend got the baked potato and asparagus.  No complaints from either, they all tasted great. Fair warning though: their baked potato is quite large (see picture below).VERDICT: Great food overall, and a wonderful experience.  I can't call J. Gilbert's the best steakhouse in town, but their crab cake appetizer, solid steaks, and pleasurable dining experience certainly make this restaurant highly recommended.  You may want to \"order down\" on how you want your cow prepared, as they err on the side of over-cooked, but it's an otherwise great date night spot if you don't feel like driving into downtown to dine at its competitors."}, {"review_id": "84i7CxcZYaIbJDK5rv2QpQ", "user_id": "yPtw4a_lVeCCWLC9qK8Haw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "11/27/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This was a rough one. The service was abysmal, but the food issues made the service worse as the night progressed. Service is anecdotal at the best of times, but the food is permanent. If you serve acrid seltzer water and call it a $3 house-made lemonade, or a cherry lemonade which is 20 parts pure grenadine, 1 part lemon, you have a bartending problem. When your 16 oz. KC Strip hasn't been properly salted to account for the thickness of meat, so each bite of your nearly $50 steak loses flavor after the first two chews - and is now simply a bland $50 exercise for your teeth - you have a grill man problem. Send that waste of sub-par beef back with explanations of amateur protein to salt ratios - only to then receive a replacement filet minon with enough salt encrusted upon it to season both the 16 oz. Strip and the 8 oz. filet - you would reveal both a total failure of communication, and either zero understanding for how to properly season protein on the part of chef, or evidence of vindictive collusion by all those involved. I was assured that vindictive collusion is not tolerated.The waitress told me that because of my original complaint, she thought I liked salt a lot. Smh. The salt dried out the exterior of the meat; with no moisture left, the grill man burned the steak badly. It was inedible, with a hot red - near raw - center.This entire celebratory anniversary evening was a snow ball effect of bad food, and the service growingly became worse as our high hopes were dashed. They let us down, and the server flamed an environment of irritation rather than hospitality - even though I consistently sent everything they brought back through either total repulsion, or for lack of passing a proper cost/benefit analysis. If you want $50 for a steak, it had better taste like a $50 steak - and if I can do better with a small grill, some salt, pepper, olive oil, and a $15 steak, you're not doing it right. The Shrimp cocktail was good, but not the best I've had. It looked great upon the ice, but honestly who can't plate a shrimp cocktail?The professionalism of this place is fragile at best, and under duress falters - even in the managerial staff I have come to find. What makes the service industry terrible is the reconciliation of strangers for the exchange of money for services. I brought my interest and the money, and their services failed what I both came to expect regarding our history and the money they feel obliged to request. Plain and simple. I believe that they don't even use the same great aged steak that I regaled to so many wandering patrons over the years.  I was curious as to why such a fabulous restaurant years ago had seemingly joined the ranks of shuffling mediocrity, hoisted upon the grand shoulders of Applebees or Red Robin. I discovered in an October 2nd health inspection report - not a few weeks after my visit - that J. Gilberts had 13 violations - having been corrected the day of, on site, mind you. Some were tedious - albeit necessary - but the overall amount and callousness of a few revealed a possible impetuous disregard for the hallowed craft of food service. I hope that concern for great and consistent food returns to the kitchen of J. Gilberts, because as it stands I should never return. I tasted it once, told the world of \"Kansas City's best Steakhouse,\" and have recently felt betrayed by such a hurried opinion. We shall see."}, {"review_id": "lqRLPYql_E_GlGM26x7Q4w", "user_id": "LBFRoZWno0yhPXop6RZ0Xg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/4/2017", "text": "My husband and I celebrated our 5th anniversary here a couple of weeks ago.  All around, it was a wonderful experience!  I had a small filet (4 oz.

And for this, she suggests J Gilbert's. This would be my first time visiting this establishment. I will say, I've always heard good things about the restaurant. Unfortunately, this night also happened to be one of those rare Kansas City summer nights in which a monsoon was ripping through town. As I mentioned, the rain was coming down awfully hard so the restaurant itself was pretty empty (I reckon flash flood warnings probably aren't good for the dining business). I was the first to arrive because I ubered and while I waited for the rest of the group, I was also eagerly awaiting my server so I could order a cocktail to pass the time. Sadly, no one came. No one came for quite a while actually. I'm pretty certain about 15 minutes went by without any greeting aside from that of one of the bussers. She was very nice and I think she realized no one had come to the table and so I'm sure it was her who went to grab our server. As time went on, the service got a little better but for it being my first time here, I was a bit disappointed. I guess we'll get to the good. The food was great and that's why I felt compelled to give this place 4 stars as opposed to 3. Compliments to the chef. I ordered the filet combo with the scallops and sides of green beans and mushroom risotto. Everything was cooked perfectly. I ordered my steak medium rare and it had the most perfect hint of red. Scallops weren't chewy. For my beverage, I opted for the J Gilbert manhattan. I've been on a bit of a whiskey/bourbon kick and those cherries were just what I needed ease the pain of the rain.Because it was a Saturday night and the rain flooding into the restaurant, perhaps the staff was caught off guard. I'm willing to give the service a pass this time because the food was that good and I'd probably still return.
