She knew I had to do something, I couldn't not do something!  I could tell he was getting ready to leave, so as he got up, I got up and intercepted him to talk with him.  Have you ever tried to have a conversation with one of your idols/heros, or anyone famous?  I imagined many things I would ask any one of the band members over the 35 years I have been a fan, and well let me tell you, it never comes out right, LOL.  I called him by his stage/nick-name \"Hey Lerxt, you getting ready for the show tomorrow?\"  He instantly knew I was a fan, because not just anyone would call him that.  I reached out and we shook hands, and was trying to figure out what to say.  He was grinning from ear to ear, the jokester that he is,  as I was too, and we had some words.  He came over and introduced himself to my wife, and she was just as star struck as I was.  It was truly a moment in time that was both surreal and just awesome for me (and her) to share some words with him.  This was May 7, 2015, almost 3 years later, and while I can barely remember what I ate, I cannot forget this day.  (I had the Salmon BTW).   ..And just like that, he was gone, and we were there in awe.  The person who stayed behind was from Rolling Stone magazine doing an interview.  He told me they were there for like 6 hours drinking and having a good time.  As we were chatting, it was funny, because there was some locals talking at a table near by, about how RUSH is in town, and they weren't going but they were fans, and they had no idea that Alex Lifeson was just right there in front of them.  We laughed about it.  We got our appetizers and entrees.   I'm pretty sure I got the Salmon and we had the calamari appetizer.  What I remember about the meal and the service was that it was top-notch.  My wife and I had a nice discussion about how fate brought us all together, and how we could have chosen any restaurant to eat at, but it was this one etc.  It was truly a special moment.Sorry that this review was more about the experience than the meal, but I will say that this restaurant is truly a great restaurant and the food and service was solid.  It is definitely the kind of place you can go on a special occasion, or with just a group of friends to have a great meal.  I enjoyed craft cocktails, which normally I would just do a Jack on the rocks, and we even had dessert, which typically I don't do, but this was a special night.  If you are looking for a great restaurant in Tulsa, this is the place.  Don't look any further, make a reservation, thank me later."}, {"review_id": "UUsAJkXTBVZRysnAE1hsjA", "user_id": "KePkvm9wE_O03tufXwQiEg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Ok so first off this kitchen can spin out some food reeeeallly fast! The chefs appetizer was pretty good but I can't remember it's name.. it was basically a pickle with some other things... my only complaint was I had a hard crunch of something that could have chipped a tooth..So I tried the stroganoff and the noodles were delicate and the ribeye was melt in your mouth awesome! But the sauce was just missing something . Don't get me wrong I used the bread to eat up as much as I could but I felt it was lacking something.. the wife got king salmon and it was really good and hot which was a nice change. Meaning it literally came off the grill and hit our table... not sitting st a window cooling for 10 minutes like other food chains.We also tried the cheese plate as an app and we weren't a fan of the pimento salmon spread? Or was it hummus? I don't like either but it was kinda fishy. The meats and cheese were good but could have had just a little more.. ver tastey and we loved the Dijon.I can't give this place a 4 because the menu seems to lack options that I would want to eat and the price seems to be a bit steep for what you get. Do give the place a try though and maybe a visit in the summer would change my ranking..??"}, {"review_id": "_dBGLY4TT0iWfsAkfwN8bQ", "user_id": "_OOu-fBcxx9Ycza5SRGRUA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/6/2017", "text": "I have been fortunate enough to eat here on business trips to the Tulsa area. For fine French-centric dining in Tulsa, I can't imagine a better place - my first visit last year was delightful and I thought this place could easily compete in Houston, Dallas or other larger cities.Last week I came here again for a business meal. Since it was Nov. 2nd, they had a special Dia de Muertos (Mexican Day of the Dead) menu so we ordered the carnitas tacos. They had a twist on the ingredient but all I remember is they were fantastic with depth of flavor. The wine list here is outstanding and our server had a good recommendation for my glass of red.I probably should have taken her hint that the Ribeye Stroganoff wasn't her favorite but she did say it was their most popular item. This main entree fell short so it would have been a 3 star review if my previous and rest-of-this-meal experience wasn't so good. The pasta was great texture but the whole dish was under salted including the beef. The ribeye was also over cooked and a bit tough.With Juniper, I say go with their specials and steer clear of typical fare - try something new and expand your horizons."}, {"review_id": "e_59KJ8fDwg7fb8Uve1feg", "user_id": "uryTz1pz9aoASiKiaoshxw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Juniper is always very good. I love that they always have something new on the menu, and the service has always been great. My favorite martini is the Juniper, and I think that's almost as good a reason to go back as the food. They did have a little miss for me with the fried chicken curry dish they did recently, which was akin to chicken fingers on top of a curry of hard-to-pin down flavor provenance. The beef stroganoff was very good, and I've always enjoyed their fish dishes. Overall I always enjoy my meal and the overall vibe of the restaurant. This is great for a date night or a nice dinner with friends."}, {"review_id": "q8pkM3J0gP-EKlm64o49IA", "user_id": "1yg2fxUfTB-qLykvE3FY_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/3/2017", "text": "Fabulous dinner! Started out with a really good Cosmopolitan. They had a great cocktail list but I went with my usual standard-the choices looked really good though! They have house infused vodkas, gins and flavored bitters. Their menu is really unique and changes with the seasons. They even grow their own herbs in the alleyway garden. We were there for a special occasion-my cousin's birthday. We had a table of 12. Our waitress Ashley took great care of us the whole evening. The table shared several appetizers- I especially loved the mushroom fritto-buttermilk fried mushrooms and vegetables with sage aioli and the steamed mussels and escargot. Their fall menu had many great choices. Since we were there on December 30th, we got to order from their 2016 Year in Review Menu-it was a really cute theme, having special dishes in honor of 2016 events, such as the Cubs winning the World series-some kind of hot dog (but upscale) entree. I had the Trump Filet-awesome filet with wonderful fries and an edible gold foil on top! My husband had the ribeye stroganoff and he said it was the best one he has ever had! He is not usually a stroganoff fan but this one was different (even better than the one at Angel's Hollow in Breckenridge, CO-which was hard to beat!). I wish I had tried my cousin's pumpkin risotto-you can get that as either an entree or a side. My cousin loved it! I got the fried brussel sprouts as my side dish-delicious!  The table just split one dessert, we were so full, but it was so good, just had a bite! And I had the french press coffee which was really good. Highly recommend, can't wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "1ih_Rea6i6NEVptoTHSiVQ", "user_id": "-2HBkCef8G6V6W6_eVJtPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/4/2017", "text": "My last experience at Juniper wasn't the best but the one I just had at their Harvest wine dinner erased that from my mind. Course after course of decadent food. Platters and platters of meat perfectly cooked just laid out before you. I loved all of the unique pairings. It wasn't just wine but also beer and a cocktail. I couldn't eat everything but our lovely server was happy to make us all to go boxes and put them in bags for us so that we could have a second crack at this feeling and wonderful dinner. I love that they donated a turkey to the food bank for every Harvest dinner bought. I will definitely check this one out next year and keep my eyes open for other ones they have throughout the seasons."}, {"review_id": "A_OKZBWUUIeO5dmzV8FEtg", "user_id": "TgUWzwPlgufGh3TnGj5gzg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Lovely environment, a little loud at times depending on how many people are there. The food was amazing, the bread was probably one of my favorite parts of the meal! Nice crunchy crust with a soft interior. The service was average, was hoping for more interaction with our server. She seemed as if she didn't really want to be there, I get people have off days and maybe this was on of them.

I think it's been one of of favorite restaurants in Tulsa so far. The ambiance was amazing, our waiter was phenomenal, and we really enjoyed the food. We of course started off with a glass of a rose that was suggested which was good. We also ordered appetizers: fried mushrooms, shrimp lettuce wraps, and the bread with cheese. We were highly impressed with the appetizers and they were promoting delivered to the table after we ordered them. For our entrees: two of us ordered the trout, and my other coworker ordered the sea bass. I typically cannot eat all of my meal, but the brown battered trout was very tasty and the sides complimented the main dish very well. For dessert we ordered the bread pudding and creme brûlée, both of which were very tasty, even though he had to course ourselves to eat it because we were so full for dinner dishes. We will definitely come back to this restaurant if we return to Tulsa."}, {"review_id": "0pLSuWm0xMOd70-hufuAGg", "user_id": "MAOS8SO6GmojdD8JPUYF4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/9/2017", "text": "After a special event, take a chance to share with family one of the most delicious and fancy lunches in Tulsa.  Each plate we ordered was delicious, fantastic flavors, taste and the service terrific."}, {"review_id": "gNKukj5_tfvhgE65a9ajXA", "user_id": "YQAuUaywExz29cNzic3LHg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/31/2017", "text": "Great duck dish and excellent service. Came here for an early dinner and I ordered the duck dish with a side of sauted veggies. The waiter brought a complimentary bread and this honey-berry whipped butter. The bread was tasty (wonderful crispy edge) and the butter was just creamy. The duck was cooked right, neither tough nor gamey. There's about 6 oz of duck meat. I was basing my order off of other duck dish photos from fellow Yelpers and mine looks different (I'll post pic). The tamale was nice and fluffy with stuffed fresh corn inside of it and there are a couple of corn on the knobs on the side. If you are hungry, I suggest order a side dish or an app. The sauted veggies were good but nothing special. The ambiance of this place is great with great service and ample space between the tables so you can chatter away without worrying about your neighbors accidentally evesdrop!
