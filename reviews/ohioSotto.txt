A little too dark to read the menus. Dark is ok but not for everyone. I liked that the pastas were made in house. I had the spaghetti and black pepper which was great. The portion was fair but not too much like NY and NJ Italian restaurants give you. My insalata was fresh and tasty with the mint.

The entrance is below street level. It's a bit dark walking in, as they have lights significantly dimmed. Candles on the steps inside walking down into the restaurant. Seems a bit hazardous, actually, since it's fairly difficult to see. Reservations don't seem to be required, but I would guess is strongly suggested on busy weekend nights, at least. We didn't have a reservation. We walked in around 4:30 and were told all tables were booked until 8:15. They offered us seating at a communal table. Or at the bar.  We sat at the bar. Bartenders were super friendly and explained some menu items we asked about. It's pretty pricey. Expected, as it is fine dining as well as right around the corner from the Aronoff. Ambiance was intimate, with very low lighting. The appetizer trays (meat and cheese) we got were pretty good. Goat cheese and honey bruschetta was burnt. It was still good, but it was burnt. Pasta was average. Expensive, tho, as pasta tends to be although it is one of the cheapest things to make. Cocktails were delicious."}, {"review_id": "P2p7KGWB1XZq_icSkOC5Aw", "user_id": "mPMPn-ZMZ1IOX9kYmwkYwg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "I love this place so much!

You walk down about ten steps to a door with a simple sign and zero windows. It almost appears as if you're going to walk into a cave. The inside of the restaurant is rocky and glowing with a million candles. There's a room in the back where they hand-make noodles and you can watch them doing it. There's also loads of nooks and crannies with intimate tables that couples enjoy authentic Italian food over. We got placed at a two-person table next to a spiral, underground wine cellar that we overlooked- so interesting! Our server was very professional, friendly, and quick. The menus are in Italian but are completely explained by the servers without you even needing to ask. Anything you order will be delicious because, well they hand-make the noodles. You just know it'll be incredible. We shared the pasta bolognese and Garganella pasta dish (had mushrooms, peas, shallots, parmesan, and a creamy sauce). We also ordered the bread appetizer - YUM. They recommend that you order two dishes each - an appetizer and entree because the entrees aren't huge. Honestly, the entree was a good enough size for me (probably resembles what a portion size should be!), although the chopped salad and bruschettas sounded great as well. Definitely call ahead to get reservations - they take them!"}, {"review_id": "DJOIZcrgcvqkyDRECDDl8A", "user_id": "fiScG_wgq8KIDrKAlcGuiA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Without a doubt, Sotto is one of my favorite restaurants in the Cincinnati area.

The cheese board gives a nice selection of 4 cheeses, although I would recommend ordering a side of bread with it if you don't want to just eat it plain. The short rib cappellacci never dissapoints,  although you'll need to get another primi dish or salad if you want it to fill you up.

The best part!? The people at the communal table. People are super friendly so if you are traveling alone on business this is the right place to hang out. Downside? The service is not as fast as in big cities. Sometimes one can just watch the waiter spending 10 minutes explaining the menu at the next table and wonder when one gets to order. The list of italian wines by the glass is quite good. I ordered the super Tuscan from Ciaci Piccolomini and it was excellent. Onto the food. People raved by the black kale Ceasar salad  - nothing black about this dish. Solid but not stellar. The short rib cappelacci was well put together. Al dente on pasta. Perfected executed on the shape of the pasta. And the short rib is not overwhelming - just a bit in the center to give enough gravity and taste to complement the pasta. The best dish is actually the tiramisu, surprisingly. There is a chunk of solid chocolate on the bottom later that intensifies this dish relative to its Nyc cousins. Well done!Nice lit ambience and it smells amazing here.

I've been to this place twice and it is a nice fancy place to have dinner. For the starter, you should definitely order the chicken liver mousse with pistachio (it comes with toast that you can use the spread on). The goat cheese with hazelnut honey is also good as well. For the antipasti, you can order the polenta - pretty good but the texture might get to some people. Primi wise, the short rib cappellacci is pretty good. Portions are small, so you can have several courses. And finally, for dessert, you must get the ricotta donuts - very yummy. They were actually my favorite part out of the entire meal.

This place is located in downtown Cincinnati. The restaurant is underground, which creates a great vibe. It's a darker lit restaurant which allows for a romantic mood. The menu is all Italian menu, with options to have multiple courses. They recommend that you start with an appetizer, we decided to start to garlic bread and also a seasonal cheese plate. Both were great! The bread was $4 and the cheese plate was $18. Next they recommended to get a salad plate. We both got salads, which were to die for! Those were around $8 each. Then we were recommended to get a pasta plate and a meat plate, however we decided to just stick with pasta. The pasta plate was around $18 and had great flavor! If we would have got a meat plate that would have been around $30. Lastly, we had to finish with their famous donuts. They were warm and delicious! They had three different dipping sauces. If you are looking for flavor, atmosphere and service then you won't find anything better than Sotto! I recommend all visitors of Cincinnati to give this place a try.

I have been back to Sotto several times, but I was particularly excited for this visit because I always love it when they bring back their truffle pasta.We started with the chicken liver mousse, which is always a must, and the kale salads. The chicken liver mousse is typically very good, however, it was slightly under seasoned. As for the kale salad, this is something I ALWAYS look forward to at Sotto. In fact, I have previously mentioned that this is the best kale salad I have ever had, however, they recently changed their kale varietal (I was informed it was a \"turbo\" varietal). This kale was rather stemmy and brittle and not as good as the old kale salad. The parmesan on the salad was still phenomenal, but the salad itself was slightly under dressed.For entrees, we ordered the truffle pasta and the cauliflower campanelle. The truffle pasta was a little disappointing this time. It lacked the truffle aroma it used to have. I believe they skimped out on the white truffle in the dish this time. The best thing in this dish was the homemade pasta which is always a hit. The cauliflower campanelle was also a little different this year. It was a little lighter and lacked a sauce that binded the whole dish. It was a lighter dish which was refreshing, but it wasn't as good as it used to be.For dessert, we ordered the pistachio gelato which is always a hit. We also ordered the affogato--which could've used a hotter espresso. The gelato and the espresso were pretty much divided the whole time since the espresso wasn't hot enough and I personally enjoy it when my affogato is a creamy mixture of the two by the very end. The ricotta donuts were always good as well.Service was ok. It is nice since they remember your wine preferences when you reserve through open table. Overall, it was a disappointing visit to one of my favorite restaurants in Cincinnati."}, {"review_id": "_7erSIaIw2h46nGzhKGULg", "user_id": "uIVB_fub0nZWnN_AxPRtCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "as a self-proclaimed foodie living in cincy, it's embarrassing to say i had never been to sotto before my experience there the other night. first off: ambiance-there is nothing like it. you walk down into a basement and find yourself in a place that oozes ambiance. it's dark. cozy. sultry. romantic. a very big space (surprisingly large--venture back to find the restrooms and you'll be shocked to see how far back it goes). we were seated at the \"chef's table\"--essentially bar seating that faces the grill and kitchen prep area. i wouldn't recommend this if you're with a big group, but i ADORED it for just the two of us. it was warm (by the fire), and entertaining. PLUS you get olive oil brushed bruschetta for free.99. werd.kkkk now, the food. what hasn't been said? started off with cheese sampler. came with honey. YUM. strange thing: the server told us AFTER bringing out the tray that 2 of the cheeses shouldn't be consumed \"if expecting\". i feel like that should be mentioned beforehand? not that i am expecting (shudder...), but if someone was, they would have just ordered something that they can't fully enjoy. just an fyi. the next course: pistachio + chicken mousse. YUM. such a good pairing of flavors. then, kale salad with breadcrumbs. a surprising texture, but totally dug it. then, shortrib pasta. can't really praise this dish enough. it's infamous for a reason, folks. the noodles are a nice texture--a bit of a \"bite\" to it, paired with the creamy/satin-y sauce and the savory short rib filling... ugh. dear gawd. the stand out course. finished off the meal with the quail. quail is a bit game-y for my taste. the accompaniments (pearl cous cous) was a nice texture and taste. next time i'll try something else. we opted out of the doughnuts.. i know that's a travesty. everyone praised them.

The dimmed lighting also added the perfect touch to this vibe. Second, the food.....Delicious! Literally everything we ate was amazing. To start, we ordered: -The blue oven tortano bread-The porchetta bruschetta porkWe had to stop eating halfway through because it was very filling, but oh so good! For dinner, we ordered: -The ragù alla bolognese-The gnocchi alla romana-The short rib cappellacciAlthough they were ALL perfect, my favorite was the short rib. They were wrapped in a delicate pasta and laid in a light, but rich sauce that was soooo good! Lastly, for dessert, we ordered: -The ricotta doughnuts w/ three sauceAlthough we were stuffed, our waiter explained we had to try at least one and take the rest home. My goodness! It was like heaven! So moist and so creamy on the inside! CLEARLY my experience was great and I can't wait to go back. Word of advice: Make reservations well in advance....at least a week or so.

I was flooded with memories of Italian eateries tucked away in lower levels of buildings with stones walls found throughout. Follow your nose to the back of the restaurant to see the magic firsthand: made from scratch pasta - all in house. If you order only one thing during your visit, let it be the short rib ravioli. The tender meat, the buttery sauce, the perfected noodle, it was all too good to be true. I didn't want the meal to end. I almost shed a tear with the last bite. Dramatic, I know. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable and attentive. Rumor has it, the dessert doughnuts are also a must.

On a Sunday night, no reservations so I called in and he got me in at the chef's table. It was cold outside, so nice to sit in front of the wood stove with a glass of Grenache.  Sotto got high marks and I was starving, a nice little combo for me. Located below street level, I had to ask the homeless man sitting outside if I was going to the right place. I ordered Ragù alla Bolognese, Short Rib Cappellacci and Ricotta Doughnuts for dessert. Now, I know, hey Mr Piggy, did they roll you out of there?  I mean, no, because portions are a little skinny so you kind of have to double down to get filled up. But, your boy was also very hungry.
