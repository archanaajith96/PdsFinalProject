This bar has a massive amount of craft beer which is awesome if you love beer or if you have a hard time finding a beer that works for you. I always loved going to Tavern and picking a new beer I had never had before just to keep my night interesting.The Pizza. Amazing. For a bar in Allentown, they have got their pizza down. The sauce is sweet which is what I think really makes this pizza amazing. On Wednesday they have dollar slice night which is a popping night! I have heard that their wings are amazing as well. The only downside of this place is the customer service. I have found the staff to be a little rude and unfriendly. To be honest, I don't blame them. They are dealing with college kids 24/ 7 and they have to make sure that everyone who comes after hours is 21 and over. That is hard to do! I would say that some staff members have been nice so I would not put that statement on everyone.This is a great spot to watch sports games, have a chill night with friends, dates, or even a great place to order pizza and take it back to your place. A true gem in Allentown, PA. Next time I am in town it will be the first stop I make!"}, {"review_id": "72yCSlCmlBagmrOyH6Qt1g", "user_id": "UxQh4WtMSWGlNczg-_hicQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/20/2017", "text": "I was in Allentown for a work trip recently.

Short and sweet; this place is amazing. Great beer selection, great food, great people (Steve was our waiter), and all around awesome local atmosphere. 10/10 would go again.

Peruse the coolers lining the dining area walls and choose any bottle you like (let your server or bartender do the honors of opening said bottle). And keep in mind: there are usually larger format bottles in the coolers by the kitchen kind of hidden behind the bar. These are fair game too!! My biggest issue with Liberty St is the cigarette smoking. Gah!! If only they didn't allow smoking inside. The cigarette smoke ruins it for me every time.

We met my aunt and uncle at this little hole in the wall during the Christmas season for a late lunch. My husband and I walked through the door and were surprised by the smoking inside (but hey we're from NJ). Smoking didn't bother our party, but if that isn't for you I may not suggest sitting near the bar area. The place is small, 5 high top tables, 15 seats at the bar and another \"dining\" section up top which had about 20 seats. It is a very intimate setting. Back to the food - bar food - is really our go to anyway so the food was awesome. We had wings and they were flavorful and had a substantial amount of meat to them. My father had a burger and my aunt and uncle had a wrap which they all said were good. The beer selection as I had aluded to earlier is amazing! Wall to wall cases of beer and about 20 beers on tap. They are also on BeerMenus (see previous post) which is awesome and keeps us craft beer junkies up to date.If you are looking for a few great/rare beers or to get some hearty bar food this is the place I would recommend. From what my aunt and father said the owners also own a place in Reading which they really enjoy as well. Check it out if you are in the area, you won't be disappointed!"}, {"review_id": "Z7NT3NQA7CwJ_VGybghrBA", "user_id": "Woc-rLRfDn89RfIcTOJBOA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/6/2017", "text": "I love this place!!!

I started frequenting this small local establishment in 2009, after becoming a permanent  resident to the area. Within two weeks the staff knew my name and knew the types of beer that I drink. It serves as a home base for me and my close friends; we eat, drink, and carry on like it's our own back yard. I've met some of my best friends here. It draws an eclectic mix of people that makes the atmosphere delightful to any that walk on this earth. It was that way in 2009 and in 2017 it holds true. There is no similar watering hole in the area. The pizza is amazing, especially the MacDaddy (try it). The wings are best in the valley as of this moment. The rotating 20 tapped beers are supplemented by a countless selection of bottles.
