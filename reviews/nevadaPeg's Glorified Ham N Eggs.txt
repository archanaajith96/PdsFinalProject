The biscuits were like warm and the gravy was ice cold.My dads loco moco was also room temperature. Honestly I wouldn't recommend. If you're in town go to the Cup Cafe.

The flavor that was packed into the breakfast I had here was out of this world!!!! I stopped by here in a Saturday morning and even though it was full I didn't have to wait long to be seated. I ordered the Chef George's Bene, I added avocado as a recommendation from my server and I am so glad I did. The Benedict is a chorizo patty and a chipotle sauce and is ridiculous in flavor. The avocado was the perfect addition as there is a little spice to this dish. The service was amazing and my food came out so quickly. This is definitely a cool little spot to try for an amazing breakfast."}, {"review_id": "I5VA5GqL8QHkyzsB7lrTcg", "user_id": "8drMKNHWavs2g6uf0pLtvg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "-_- .... maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but I have to say this place wasn't \"out of this world amazingly, delicious,\" for me... sorry y'all- I'm sure their 4.5 Stars out of 1500+ for other reasons... (Unfortunately when we walked in, the place smelt like really bad B.O. per my husband, but I didn't smell it...except since he kept complaining about it, the smell started becoming apparent to me.) When we walked in, we were cheerfully greeted and seated right away. Shortly there after, our server came to take our drink and meal orders. With this said, the WAIT service is on point-they have an amazing wait service staff, where everyone is always smiling and down to help out. *Many Stars for that! For breakfast I tried the Sierra Omelette (peep my picture), this consisted of a spicy chicken filling similar to what you would find in enchiladas or even a chicken tamale. It was a tasty filling, except it didn't pair well with the omelette part-I ended up eating most of the spicy chicken filling and passing on the eggs. Also the huge plate consisted of, homemade pico salsa, hash browns, beans, a cold cabbage salad and a slice of cantaloupe. This dish was huge, big enough to share between 3 people. I feel bad because I barely ate 25% of it, so definitely expect leftovers from this dish. The hubs ordered the California Omelette, which was one of their specials today. His Omelette consisted of at least 4 eggs, bacon, cheese, avocado and sour cream. This too was huge, he normally eats 80%-100% of his meals and this morning he barely ate half. Expect HUGE portions here! Flavor wise, his Omelette was delicious, anything with bacon is always good! I really wanted to give more stars since the high rating of 4.5, but this place earns a solid, honest 3 Stars today. I might give this place another try the next time we drive thru Reno..."}, {"review_id": "6nmhtrmKnPmxDszYTBVvhw", "user_id": "xrlyGclI6WL7KAIVC5hA6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "I was just in Reno for the day, along with my dog, so I searched Yelp for cheap (but good) breakfast w/ outdoor seating. This place seemed to fit the bill! The \"outdoor seating\" turned out to just be one table out front, but at least they had an overhead heater - as it was a rather chilly day.I had a short stack of pancakes + hash browns, and it was pretty tasty for the price. Pancakes were a tad \"chewy\" but still good, and the hash browns were non-oily with a nice crunch. My only minor suggestion is to offer whipped butter, as the hard stuff isn't spreadable enough for food like pancakes.

Everything was delicious & they definitely don't skimp on the portion size!! We even loved their orange juice, which you can tell is freshly squeezed!Service, was beyond excellent!! Our server (didn't catch his name) was AMAZING!

People were crammed together, around tables of diners trying to eat outside. It was crazy, and it made me want to dine there even more. I didn't how long the wait was at this point. This place is clearly the place to be.Word of warning: If you're a party of more than two people, be prepared to wait longer. They have a lot of tables that can seat only two; however, I did watch them move tables around to accommodate more. I wouldn't expect it though. As we waited in the little lobby area, various restaurant employees, including a woman I'm pretty sure is the owner, went outside to call parties. Each pass through they made sure to say hi to anyone new that was waiting, and they did so with a smile. It's a warm and friendly gesture that goes a long way. We were seated a lot faster than I thought we would be. Even though our waitress was extremely busy, she made sure we had coffee and water before finishing up her other business. She was a machine and made sure all of her tables were happy. It was a tough decision, but I ended up ordering the Monte Cristo. The sandwich comes with a side of fruit. The fruit was fresh and consisted of sliced bananas, strawberries, grapes, and melon. The Monte Cristo was amazing. The French toast was cooked beautifully and was incredibly moist. The turkey, ham, and cheeses were all so good together. And the amount of powdered sugar on top was ridiculous, in a good way. It wasn't the biggest Monte Cristo I've ever had, but it was for sure the tastiest.If you're in the area, this place is a must check out."}, {"review_id": "QCEBMkydv0r6fDGkcjBOLw", "user_id": "aUMXnlJmofj6jpZFipAV6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "The line for this place goes out the door!  If you have ever eaten here, you would know why - This place is absolutely delicious."}, {"review_id": "FXye0LsicnqY8qbHwb0BBg", "user_id": "qwaBk9Xn94kiHxFyC_Qxsw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "Oh Peg's, you captured my heart with your fantastic brunch options while we were on vacaaayy!The boy surprised me with this lil' cute brunch place since I wasn't feeling too well after getting beat up the day before on the slopes.

Peg's blew it out of the water with both!The huevos rancheros is a fantastic twist between brunch and latin food with a side of beans, tortillas, eggs, and more. However, the dish doesn't come with meat so we added chorizo for about $5. It didn't come with that much meat (meh). I ordered Chef George's benedict that won me over with their chorizo and chipotle hollandaise sauceeee. Overall, a busy place so get there early!

I have eaten at the North Reno location before, so my expectations were aligned to expect simple diner food, however, I left feeling that perhaps my expectations were a little too high. We had to shimmy past a cart full with dirty dishes upon entering the front door, which made me wonder about the overall cleanliness. I love the original feel of this location, but the carpet seemed to be original as well. I noticed that my shoes were sticking to the carpet on the worn pathway to and from the restroom. Restroom was very clean! We ordered a breakfast burrito and simple scrambled eggs with tomatoes, bacon and hash browns. They hit the mark for large portions! My mom enjoyed her breakfast burrito skillet and could not eat it all. They serve it in a large skillet with beans, pico mix, lettuce, hash browns and slice of cantaloupe.My breakfast was less desirable... I requested crispy bacon and received burnt bacon. I don't mind it a little burnt if the flavor is good. I ended up adding syrup for flavor. My first and second bite of eggs tasted like fish. Not sure if it was from the tomatoes or eggs, but I decided to forgo my eggs. Hash browns were standard and the cantaloupe was super sweet and tasty. The staff was very friendly and efficient. Even though they were slammed for the lunch rush, everything seemed run smoothly. Our waitress was great and I'm certain she would have offered to have my eggs remade if I mentioned the taste. I felt that not requesting something else was the best decision. It seems as if other people really like Pegs based on the overall Yelp rating, but I couldn't find a reason to give more than 3 stars and sorry to say that it won't be my first choice in the future."}, {"review_id": "Mzw5vELfvszACtddDxJYVw", "user_id": "frWrWdOAdHF3vgeZN4n1kA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/11/2017", "text": "Pretty tasty breakfast!  Hubby and I took our nephew on a trip to Reno.  A few of the dealers/bartenders at Harrah's recommended this place.  We later found out that our nephew had been before, but this was our first time.  We were able to sit at the counter right away.  What a great experience.  The waitstaff and cooks worked it!  I couldn't believe how well they all worked together and the amount of food they were able to put out in a short amount of time.  Great job!The food was good.  Hubby had the country fried steak and eggs, nephew had a cheeseburger, and I had the chorizo scramble.  Hubby and I's breakfast came with unlimited toast!  What a great idea!  Both dishes were fantastic and the portions were huge!"}, {"review_id": "3cZZ0qmVMjpv_8EUZe2FKQ", "user_id": "wB0vc78dz-q0zFBatHxloQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Amazing food, service and wow, amazing food!!  Oh did I say that already?  All of our items came out quickly and the rancheros in the skillet was a nice touch.   The sauce on the Benedict was a perfect spice where it was great to mix in with the crispy hash browns.. can't wait to visit again on my next trip!"}, {"review_id": "f07e_fK0KuBNndu7v1QXwQ", "user_id": "SF-_F8FklkGoaqjWPMLu0Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Every time I'm in town, I make sure visit this restaurant; Great food and service.

Crispy coating, tender steak, piping hot, and wonderful gravy (best for dipping... get it on the side, my preference to enjoy all the distinct flavors) Add a couple eggs on the side for good measure. (That's healthy, right?)Other favorites; their top notch Patty Melt, on rye bread of course, with crispy hot fries. The Huevos Rancheros are wonderful, and plentiful, with an authentic Ranchero Sauce.  The delicious Bendedicts are all classic, ordered with \"crispy, please\" English Muffins to keep them from getting soggy. Blueberry Pancakes... yum!     And on and on!The fresh-squeezed orange juice really makes it feel like breakfast at Grandma's (for me, that was a good thing!). And the coffee... keep it coming', thank you!For years, we have come to get to know the staff. Everybody works together like a well oiled machine. The are all very professional, on the ball, and friendly. We are recognized whenever we walk in the door...(\"Norrrrrm!\") and feel right at home.
