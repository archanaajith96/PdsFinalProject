With its cafe vibe and ample seating, I come here at least once a week for a delicious panini or caffeine boost. Even though the food and drinks are amazing, the best part about LOMA is the people, they are honestly the nicest group I have ever encountered at a restaurant. The cashiers and baristas are chatty and thoughtful, and the servers are over the top.LOMA has to-go or sit down options. You order and they call your number or bring it to you if you stay. I typically order the Turkey Slam panini or Twisted Turkey sandwich. They have a wasabi mayo that is unreal. They typically have good soups, salads, and specials as well.This truly is my favorite spot in Wilmington!!"}, {"review_id": "KOvBS7Am45r-OEpAwdvjHg", "user_id": "I7Fmd8WQA0FozWOEZQNdkw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Catching a bus soon I looked up a place to grab breakfast on the go! This place had pretty good reviews so I walked over. I went with the market breakfast sandwich which was scambled eggs, cheddar and came on sourdough. I added bacon since a breakfast sandwich in my opinion should always have some sort of meat! I also ordered an ice mocha latte to go. The prices for the coffee was pretty comparable and with the sandwich was a bit expensive for my taste but when I saw my sandwich it was def worth it! My coffee was okay but the sandwich was huge! I was able to only eat half and saved the rest for later. Sourdough was crispy, scrambled eggs were soft and seasoned well. Cheese was oozing out and the bacon was plentiful and crispy. Yum yum yum. Next time I'll try and order another coffee instead. The inside looked cute too!"}, {"review_id": "jtre2V0USoC7eV14TSMtKQ", "user_id": "Gys4J9fwKIrc2Xl2snOrEA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/30/2017", "text": "I've stopped in LOMA twice and I love it.  The customer services was welcoming and friendly.   I could tell people liked this place because every morning I pass it, there is a line (unlike some of the other coffee shops).  I also appreciate that they sell Elixr coffee (and grounds). I ordered a bagel with cream cheese, tomatoes, and cucumbers.  It was nicely done with not too much cream cheese which I love. The shop is very clean and large, so you have plenty of seat options (and lots of window spots).  ADDED BONUS: This place was a stop on the Underground Railroad Byway. The byway was inspired by the recorded movements and contacts made by Harriet Tubman in Delaware, the route includes sites and pathways associated with Harriet Tubman, as well as sites and pathways associated with other documented Underground Railroad travelers and conductors.  At LOMA you can get your coffee, breakfast, and history on at the same time!"}, {"review_id": "cG4mUlRiLcmwNJKHRajIjg", "user_id": "kpe3qK2WtmyP9nDzjMgs5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "First and foremost the coffee at Loma is delicious.

It has a great hipster-ish vibe, delicious food and friendly employees. My favorite things here are the spicy turkey wrap, cranberry chicken salad and tuna melt. All are relatively healthy, use fresh ingredients and taste great. The drinks here is also a hit - I recommend the mocha iced latte while my coworkers love the snickers smoothie as well as the strawberry banana one. If you're feeling adventurous, be sure to pick up some bottles of kombucha as the perfect touch to your meal as well. There is a decent amount of seating indoors and a small outdoor area outside as well.

I stopped in here for breakfast one morning after being in town for work and decided to grab a simple sausage, egg, and cheese croissant with a coffee. The place has good vibes and has a seating area in the back and they seemed to garner plenty of foot traffic even on a Friday at around 10:30 am. It definitely has a hipster-ish vibe to it but they make it work for themselves. The sandwhich was freshly made and you could tell they had taken the time to butter up the croissant and pan fry it for that right crispiness with also the egg cooked well in a pan. The ingredients seem good quality for breakfast but the only draw was that it did take a \"long time\" for the food to come out. Wasn't too bad but im pretty sure I waited 10 minutes for this sandwich to come out so if you are in a hurry maybe not the best but definitely a nice meal to enjoy if you want it. Will be back for sure if I am back in the area"}, {"review_id": "NIdL0pIyPaVRYAn6g3tCnw", "user_id": "JQ3nDLG1I3IwXcZj495_FQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/9/2017", "text": "This is an excellent little coffee shop.
