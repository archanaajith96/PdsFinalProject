The young man that runs it is super efficient and thorough and ALWAYS friendly and helpful, no matter how busy he is.  Stay in or takeout the food is always delicious.  The PHO is always a win.  Avacado boba tea is by far something I crave all year round and so satisfying after a hearty meal.  Sometimes I even do a takeout order of just that!  Prices are right on point and the balance between taste, price, and food portion keep me coming back again and again.  I can come outta here for $30 for two people stuffed and happy.  I'd rather come here then some other overpriced sandwich or burger joint and pay more than $30 for two people like I usually end up doing.  You will definitely overlook the no frills cramped dining once you get such friendly service and delicious food at a great price.  A definite win."}, {"review_id": "n8uClo2K_ztERQTrVaaWBQ", "user_id": "poYmKGWz7juQ-zetD8POKA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "Really large portions, ultimate sauce options, and quick service!!!

The food comforts and warms the soul with its excellent big portions of homestyle Vietnamese pho and traditional dishes. It's affordable and totally worth the price. The pho may be the best pho I ever had in Massachusetts and this is telling as I have eaten at many Vietnamese restaurants in Dorchester, Boston, Worcester, and surrounding cities. Great and quick customer service! My boyfriend and I were in the area for the Eastern States Exposition and Vinh Chau was a quick 12 minute drive away. He ordered a special pho with all cuts of meats and I ordered the #25 vermicelli. I kept taking sips of his pho because it was so good. It was light, sweet, and tasty. My dish was also delicious. I would highly recommend Vinh Chau if you are in the Springfield area."}, {"review_id": "mvUDJS0hvuu7lvSeHB9MGQ", "user_id": "7tT-b4rWfjwGet5Z5t0dJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "This place is great!I'm a local, and have been meaning to stop in for a while now. I had the opportunity to do so several days ago, and I'm so glad I did. Unfortunately I didn't have time for a sit down meal, so I chose the take out option, and was able to order several things. I  did NOT order pho, on purpose. Why? Because nearly every American I know, if I mention Vietnamese food, all  they can say is \"Pho, pho, pho.\"  Ok, granted, pho is popular, but there are many more  facets to Vietnamese cooking, and I love Vietnamese food.  So I ordered different things. The food is excellent. A soup wizard works here. Seriously. Soup is magic, the broth is so good. I ordered the spicy lemongrass soup. Yup, magic. A beef ribs and rice special was being offered, I tried that too, on the recommendation of  one of the family members of the owner, who happened to be there helping out. It was excellent. An egg noodle dish rounded out the order. Delicious. Prices are reasonable, and portions are large. Everything tasted fresh. This is home cooking at it's best. The restaurant itself is clean, and feels welcoming and warm. I wouldn't say it's \"fancy\", you won't need to go the dinner jacket and tie routine, casual attire is fine. I was wearing  a sweater and jeans and didn't feel out of place. People, the vibe in there is so good!  I like to visit restaurants on the off times, because I'm not a crowd person and I arrived as the last customers from the afternoon rush were leaving. I was able to sit and wait for my order, and chat with the friendly, knowledgeable waiter. These people were so nice to me. I was offered a cup of tea as I waited for my food. I'm a tea person, and the tea is impressive too.  When my order was ready,  someone brought it out, and as I was leaving, a new crowd of hungry customers was already on the way in.  A super positive experience all around, which got better once I arrived at home and was able to eat.Yumma umma,  this food is good. And there was a small dish of pho broth packed in with my order. Amazing broth.  So of course, I'll be getting some pho next time."}, {"review_id": "NbKBBADbGSFaWwI5VgVV8w", "user_id": "xFSLb_pxXta5G4oaRB1ylQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/21/2016", "text": "We've been here around 5 times now since moving to the area in June. We are kind of pho obsessed, so finding our local \"go to\" pho place is always our first major goal upon moving to a new area. This appears to have won it for the Springfield area. This is a \"no frills\" type restaurant. The inside isn't anything fancy, though it is clean, and the outside almost blends in with the surrounding stores as there is little signage. But I don't go to Vietnamese restaurants for the ambience, I go for a massive bowl full of soupy goodness. The service here is always pretty spot on. Very knowledgeable and friendly staff who always are on top of service. Never have any complaints in that department. The food is also quite good. We typically get egg rolls, spring rolls, and rare beef pho. The broth isn't the BEST I've ever had, but it is better than the restaurant across the street that uses way too much anise (I think that's what that flavor is). The appetizer prices are also way better here. The place across the street charges the same price for egg rolls, and you get one less. While I think the apps at both places are $1-$1.50 overpriced, they are still great. They have a great selection of boba drinks here, which is another major plus in my book. Overall I'd definitely recommend this place to get your pho fix, as it is the best in the area."}, {"review_id": "tq95UBDP2mExrM3C3zmwSw", "user_id": "6Nca9opwWrAF9tawc_-d-Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2017", "text": "Typical hole-in-the-wall restaurant with a nondescript exterior, but this place is my best bet for getting pho in the area.  If you want the very best pho in the nearby region, I'd have to recommend Pho 99 in East Hartford (this seems to also be the overwhelming recommendation from all the Vietnamese locals I know in CT).  The old signage they used to have above the door is now gone so the only indications to this restaurant are the neon sign in the window and lettering on the entrance door.  The pho broth shines here with good strong star anise flavor and decent depth and complexity to the broth which is not too salty.  I prefer Vin Chau for pho over the nicer looking Pho Saigon across the street.  One of the things I love about the place is that they serve culantro (yes, that's not a typo and I don't mean CILANTRO) with the veggie plate for the pho (other accompaniments being the bean sprouts, 'Thai' basil, jalapeno, and lime wedges). Culantro is essentially a long broad leaf-like herb that is an amped up version of cilantro.  Only minor complaint would be that they are a little skimpy on the meat/protein (though I guess you can't expect too much for an $8 bowl).The iced-coffee is also fairly good, though it could be a tad bit stronger.  Preparation of the drink is done behind the small bar, so you don't get the little tin coffee contraption at your table to mix your own.Service is friendly and prompt despite the restaurant seeming to have a thriving take-out operation.  The interior is sparsely decorated, but comfortable.  The restaurant had a good mix of repeating locals and newbies the few times I've been there."}, {"review_id": "gvn3frQZSR-8cCP45gEcqg", "user_id": "581NruH_Ns8_FH7jr9wLiQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/12/2016", "text": "I was in here a month ago and forgot to finish my review.  Vinh Chau is a family style restaurant.  There is nothing fancy about it but it is clean, features good Vietnamese food and has an efficient attentive staff.  It is located right at the X with plenty of nearby parking.  I got the Pho special based on a past review and some spring rolls.  Spring rolls were average and the Pho was better than average.  They had lots of different sauces and spices on the table.  I jacked up my Pho with some Sriracha sauce.  It was perfect.  The prices were very affordable.  All in all this was a good experience.  I am not sure its a full 5 star rating, for sure its a 4++.  I am not going to be the one drag down their average.  This is a good place."}, {"review_id": "KOBTK-IcQ4ufTwBvd18_fw", "user_id": "JHkh68SrFUEA8cVDcXqpng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "I'm from New York and dropped by to eat at this place with my family.

I normally get their specialty pho which contains various meats, while my lady gets the vegetable pho. Both are pretty awesome with your standard side plate of mint, bean sprouts, jalapenos, lime wedges, and various sauces to season your pho with. One of my favorite things about this place is the price. We normally walk out of there for under $30 which includes two pho, and a fried Vietnamese roll as an appetizer.  I can personally finish their normal size portion pho in one sitting, but their large is probably about 30% larger so good luck with that. Service/Ambiance: The service is always prompt and very friendly. Sometimes you may be greeted by an older gentleman who speaks with a heavy accent and broken English who will recommend dishes and ways to stay happy (he's quite endearing). The place is clean but sparsely decorated, with nondescript chairs and tables. Food: I haven't really ventured that much from the pho, so I can't really offer an informed perspective, but I will say all the food I've seen come out of the kitchen looks quite appetizing. Bottom Line: If around Forest Park or within 20 minutes of this place be sure to check it out. What it lacks in décor, it makes up for with price, promptness, and taste.Disclaimer: I was trying to see how many times I could use pho without it sounding forced.
