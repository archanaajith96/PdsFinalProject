I suspect anything they make that has red sauce is also good.  The place was clean, and well maintained.  My service was excellent.  There was only one server on duty when I was there but she was running around and taking care of everyone very well. There is plenty of parking in the back of Family, or on the side street, so don't be put off by the Sumner Ave. location.  I would be happy to go back.  I had a good meal."}, {"review_id": "pYiHyTrhdrtZGpx-HQZWHg", "user_id": "OLnJxtd42Us3V26VVey8AQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2017", "text": "Absolutely loved this place! We stopped here after seeing the place was full of people but a table was open. We ordered the mozzarella sticks. Do NOT miss those homemade mozzarella sticks whatever you do. They come with a homemade marinara sauce that is good! The pizza was some of the best I've ever had.

The pizza is just as good though they are not right off the highway so do not get the volume that Red Rose gains from their location. The staple pizza is their pepperoni and peppers tray pizza. Softer crust with fresh vegetables and a distinct sauce. The pizza is consistently good. Their previous location on Dickinson was sometimes hit or miss on quality of pizza. That is not the case with the Sumner Ave location.The husband / wife owners are hard working and friendly. The waitstaff that is not family is ok. They are not the best and not on their game unless owners are there. A little to chatty with themselves and not on top of the customer serving. The other food off their menu is ok, but they shine with their pizza! A great local place!"}, {"review_id": "IitF1C2Sqa3p002xqST2nQ", "user_id": "eU4fg8sCOpaAJ9GpDnnDjA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Went here after moving to town and being in the car for two straight days.

I came here for the pizza on a friend's recommendation and my first experience was good but not great. I grew up in Boston and only like round thin crust Neapolitan style pizza cut in slices. The pizza on my first visit was good but the crust was still a bit too thick and the mushrooms were from a can.  What I didn't realize is that you have to ask for it \" thin crust\" and ask for fresh mushrooms which I did my next visit and the pizza was outstanding. My wife got a small pizza with sausage, roasted red peppers, thin crust/ crispy and in slices and it was outstanding! I wanted to try their entrees and I always order something with red sauce on my first visit to any Italian place with the belief that if they can't make a great red sauce or gravy then they don;t know what they are doing. I got the veal parm with spaghetti and it is the real deal. The veal was sliced thin, fork tender and a generous potion but not paper thin like a lot of places do. The spaghetti was cooked al dente (without having to ask!) and served on the side, not under the veal like other places do to hide the fact that the veal is paper and the homemade marinara was fresh and perfectly seasoned with garlic, basil and I think a dash or Marsala wine to give it a hint of sweetness! The meal can with a soup or salad and I opted for the soup that day which was sausage and spinach in a well balanced and flavorful tomato broth. My lemon martini was $8.00 , tasted great and was a generous size and our stuffed mushrooms with crab meat appetizer was perfect in that there were no peppers or onions in the stuffing to overwhelm the dish. The decor is nothing fancy but tasteful and very clean. I'm giving it 5 stars for the food and 4 stars for the decor only because the food is so good it could be served in a more upscale setting. That said, most or all items are priced under $20 for dinner where you would most likely pay mid to high 20's in more a upscale setting. This is my new Go To place for authentic Italian food served in a casual well appointed and very clean atmosphere in Springfield and the surrounding area."}, {"review_id": "i-mLJDhtamVEeDpaIysCPA", "user_id": "ex28TzGakXJedG2WSLFMlQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2017", "text": "I remember Family Pizza as a kid, always great.

The service was terrific: really attentive but not overbearing, offered to refill my cola when I was only about 1/2 done, boxed my leftovers rather than just giving me a box to do it myself. We had a nice conversation with the hostess as she was sweeping. I had a meatball sub. The meatballs were very yummy and filling. They were good sized and not at all greasy (no one likes greasy balls). The bread wasn't my favorite but the meatballs were more than enough. My wife had a calzone that was, literally, bigger than her head (and that's a literal \"literally\").  She hates roasted red peppers so made sure to ask for fresh and that's exactly what she got, in abundance. We'd also gotten take-out from here a while ago and I got the chicken Parmesan. There was almost enough food for 3 meals and it was delicious. The total bill was just over $20 for two of us and we had leftovers. This is definitely our new favorite local pizza place."}, {"review_id": "fV16qyMxXaQVUYFzgZymew", "user_id": "3r7hY5QiRZju1xzhBQQ9Cw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/16/2016", "text": "The wings extra crispy were great.

Their pizza is way above the average as are the classic Italian American dishes such as Meat Balls and Spaghetti, White clam sauce and linguine and so forth. Their red sauce is extremely good using a little trick I often do at home when I'm making my red sauce.
