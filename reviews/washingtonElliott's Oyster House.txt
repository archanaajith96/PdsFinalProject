While i know this is a small time to wait vs. other walk-ins' 1 hour wait, i find it hard to believe that it took that long to wipe down a small table. Fried oyster appetizer (4/5): Not worth $16. The oysters are large and soft and tender on the inside, but i still don't think that price is justified. Compass point raw oysters (3.5/5): Small, but clean. standard.Humboldt kumamoto raw oysters (3.5/5): Even smaller! Lighter taste than the compass point oysters. I know that the oyster size isn't optimal at this time of year, but after eating two dozen oysters i still felt like i had consumed nothing.Chili Lime prawns (3/5); You'd think that using the word prawn would imply that they would be larger shrimp but instead they were hard to find in my food. my favorite part of this dish was the polenta. I'll gladly eat the polenta on its own next time. So expensive.Grilled scallops (4.5/5): I love grilled scallops and the risotto that came with it was perfectly cooked al dente. i only got to try a few bites before my boyfriend finished the rest of it. Only down part is that it's expensive as well, even for a scallop dish.The waitress was very very kind and thoughtful, however, and made sure that we weren't too bothered by the breeze when we were sat next to an open window, and was smiling and cheery the whole time, which made our experience more enjoyable. tl;dr: get the grilled scallops. expect small oysters when it's not oyster season. expect to pay out your butt. this place has a nice view, yes, but not necessarily the best food and can be an extremely long wait."}, {"review_id": "zZGO_O_S8wXD2wuSc15dEA", "user_id": "pGsf_SFYXDnNUaP6SKjWyg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Such an unfortunate disappointment...was hoping for a decent lunch upon arriving in Seattle.

It was awful. The menu should have said it was a cold sandwich...but apart from that, it wasn't very flavorful at all. Tasted like a grab and go wrap from a grocery store.My wife had the seafood salad (pretty good) and my in-laws had a salmon pasta special (also pretty good)...but neither dish was remarkable in any way. Just terminally average.Server was nice and attentive, if not a bit formal. She offered a complimentary dessert in consideration for my disappointing entree, but we declined.

We sat outside and got seated immediately but there was a wait for inside. We ordered the calamari, tequila mussels and then of course, the oysters!The calamari and mussels were on the happy hour menu for $4 each. The calamari was okay - it was incredibly tiny and tasted more \"zingy\" than anything. The tequila mussels was not my favorite thing in the world. The saucy was a liquid cream that was sour but sweet and the mussels were also incredibly small. Go ahead and skip these because they were a waste of money and were not that good.We also got the drinks - the Moscow mule, the sangria, and the margarita. The margarita tastes the best out of all of them but we had to add in some water but it didn't taste right. The Moscow mule was incredibly strong and disgusting while the sangria tasted like wine mixed with water and nothing else. Save your money and skip the happy hour drinks.The oysters - the star of the show. At $1.50 each, it's not expensive and is moderately priced considering the freshness. The chefs special happy hour oysters is handpicked and you cannot pick what to get. I was expecting some of various sizes but they were all mostly small from chefs choice. Some of them were sweet, some were salty. Some of them had a lot of sand and shells in them. I don't think I'll be returning, it was kind of disappointing. The oysters made up for it by a little but even then, it just isn't enough."}, {"review_id": "8XmcqwSrbXVuc6TkDcwYyw", "user_id": "h9_fjt5vrx2oRocePqepig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "No parking available, unless you're willing to valet your car or pay across the street!

I thought the food was decent and good to try, but not exceptional.We got the calamari and mussels for appetizer which were good. Their oysters were fresh, don't think it's as good as Boston area but each to their own tastebuds. The seafood salad was made with fresh seafood, the dressing was just ok. The halibut was average.

Elliott's has one, so of course I had to go.We made our way down the steep hill from our hotel on a gloomy, rainy Seattle day a few minutes after opening which allowed us to be seated instantly and have our choice of view. We picked a booth which overlooked the lake and was quite peaceful to enjoy even while it was grey outside. This place has some seriously good views of the water if you're able to eat outside or get lucky with seating.Our server was friendly, always kept our drinks full, and was nearby if something was needed. I was set on the melt and my partner ended up ordering the dungeness crab and shrimp dip. When our meals arrived, I quickly noticed that her dip looked exactly like what was on my melt. After tasting both, we're pretty confident that the dip is just spread on toasted bread to make the melt. I wouldn't say the melt was bad, but it just felt kind of lazy and gave off a bad vibe. For a restaurant that has some killer looking fresh seafood pictures on Yelp, it was unexpected.Unfortunately I probably wouldn't go back here, but I'm also not a big raw oyster fan which is probably more their clientele."}, {"review_id": "J4mPs0a0DQeQ9tieJTWGdQ", "user_id": "AbMjnKOwg736fcIu8apuyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "I liked Elliott's Oyster House so much ... I immediately went back (as soon as possible) for another meal. Both were 5-star celebrations of oysters, cocktails, and seafood.It's a house for oysters, so, get a dozen or three to share.

Or, you can just let the oyster shuckers and/or your server pick some for you.Speaking of shucking oysters, those dudes are working their right arms off at Elliott's. I sat at the oyster bar for about an hour before being seated and those shucksters never stopped shucking.

Thought that was a little strange, but I assume it's to better flow their happy hour rush. The oysters were really good and I absolutely enjoyed the pink little salt sauce thing it came with. (Apologies for lack of description) but it went really really well with the oysters. I of course still had to have my Tabasco tho! We started off with a dozen and wanted to order more by the time we finished everything, but you could tell the server was busy so we skipped it. We also ordered 1 calamari and 2 of each of the tacos and sliders. We ate the tacos first, then sliders, and I wish it were the other way because the tacos were THEBOMBDOTCOM. The fish was a great size, the avocado crema was good, ugh. Just everything was perfect. The sliders were good as well, just not as robust as the tacos. And the salmon was a lot more dense than the flaky fish. The calamari came with a good dipping sauce to it, like a twist to your normal sweet chili sauce. I almost wish we ordered the mussels because they too looked great, but by the time we got done with everything, we were ready to go. The service was typical, nothing amazing or over top, just your usual, can I take your order, how is everything check during the meal, how was everything once clearing the plates, and then the bill. The only plus was they were able to charge my phone at the host stand!All in all, I'm really glad I tried this place.

Since we ordered between the 3-4pm, each oyster was $1.50 and then the price increases by $0.50 each hour until 6. I really liked the calamari and the yummy sesame plum sauce it came with. We had Churchpoint oysters, which came with champagne mignonette as a topping in additional to the typical lemon slices. The mignonette took away the usual fishiness you'd expect from eating a raw oyster. The oysters had a good amount of meat and were a decent size. I could tell that they were cleaned pretty well since we didn't taste any with sand. We ordered another dozen right before the 4pm mark but this time, we had the Mirada Bay (?) oysters. They were definitely not as good as the Churchpoint ones and you can taste the ocean more with these. I also didn't think they cleaned these as much but maybe it was just me.
