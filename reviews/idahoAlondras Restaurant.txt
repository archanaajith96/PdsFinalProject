The food was excellent - very fresh and authentic. The papusas and gorditas were excellent, and the kids loved their tacos. It really felt like we were in a family kitchen. I am glad a few more authentic places are coming in apart from the taco trucks. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that the chips and salsa are extra, and the waiter didn't ask us if we wanted any (regardless of cost). There wasn't really any authentic non-alcoholic drinks (horchata, sugarcane juice con limon, etc), and the jaritos were very limited. Just a few tweaks and this place could be the talk of the town!"}, {"review_id": "fbBy_0BPOuuThMdnx2ATPA", "user_id": "2_g_gVzRZh0c9KNBQuJluQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "We had an early dinner here and the food was great, like a home cooked meal.

Forget the strip mall Mexican and the unnamed popular local chains: if you want the real deal Holyfield of tacos, gorditas, flautas, sopas, and pupusas - this is IT. Heck, if you only know what a Taco Bell gordita is, get in your car and drive yourself here immediately for some tasty schoolin'.You can't go wrong with their pozole, daily specials or combo plates such as 2 pupusas with rice and beans. On cold days snatch up the homemade champurrado (a hot chocolaté thickened with corn flour) if you can get it - it's delicious! Excellent prices too.The owners are extremely nice and the atmosphere is family-oriented. You can also find a limited mini-mart (mostly sweets, drinks, some condiments and herbal supplements), and marvel over their current fashion corner (they sell bedazzled jeans, purses, and hats too)."}, {"review_id": "Njhj9-R1Gdm0FWctCJOxYQ", "user_id": "vOGj8U80Fj82yfGEfhVarw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/21/2016", "text": "I had heard so much about this restaurant and really wanted check it out.

Especially in a predominantly white area, there's usually some restaurants that make Taco Bell look better.  But this place was delicious and simple. We decided to try this out knowing it is a small hole in the wall type of restaurant. We walked in and we immediately smelled the food and I knew was going to be good.  The man greeted us and took our order. They have a small selection for thier menu but I did end up with 3 different choices and ended up with the green enchilada dinner.  The man's wife does all the cooking and everything came out promptly. Thier red and green sauce in the bottles were absolutely the best with enough spice to make me sweat... but it was flavorful.  My family enjoyed thier taco combo plate and ordered 2 more single steak tacos.  When we walked in, the restaurant was empty on a Saturday at 545p.m. so we had the place to ourselves.  They close at 7 p.m. on the weekends. I know someone said this wasn't REAL mexican food but this is the best in Nampa if you don't want to drive further out.  They were very open to modifying your meals if you don't like onions, cheese, etc. The wife will make homemade Tamales upon request, chicken or pork or both! When we come back to visit here, we definitely will be coming back again.  Please call before you come to make sure they are open since it's a small family restaurant."}, {"review_id": "9ZgaXd96qkdNvZQwWfx5uA", "user_id": "drq0zOa9zVaWqupAmsmH6w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/28/2016", "text": "Pretty darn good Mexican food.
