They've got some non-vegan options too, but their B.V.E. chickpea burger will always have a special place in my heart. Really interesting drinks and specials.Service can be a bit slow sometimes, so plan to take your time there and make a reservation if you want to go during a popular meal time."}, {"review_id": "_hSmQQblzQaL7Y1NbJzmQg", "user_id": "rMgHovIE-cu9qOdhMuF6HQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/6/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I guess I'm on the down slope of my up and down opinion of Owl House. It's been around awhile and will be because it has a loyal following and is quirky, and great for vegan gluten free options. But if you are a meat eater prepare for disappointment.At 8:30pm on a saturday, out of 1 of the only 2 meat entrees you have, out of the entree I decided to order before I showed up! grrrr..The steak I had to get instead was tough, I mean chainsaw tough and bland. The pasta special was delicious though. But another dish was way spicier than it has been in the past.The point is, you NEVER know whether your food is going to suck or not when you come here, since the menu changes so much, and that not withstanding, a dish probably wont taste the same as the last time you had it.Time to take a break from this place. I can't handle the inconsistency."}, {"review_id": "j-d70W2zFwBVJGiRiQozLQ", "user_id": "B_-ZN03P7XW-U4_H2X_mXw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "The Owl House has been a longtime favorite of mine for brunch and dinner. They have a nice ambiance and excellent food.First tip: Definitely make a reservation. My most recent visit was for dinner tonight, a Sunday, at 6:30. While my friend and I were waiting to be seated, I heard the hostess say on the phone that they were completely booked for anything more than a party of two. They're even busier for brunch.I am not vegan/vegetarian, but I know this place is popular because they have a bunch of great vegan/vegetarian options. My favorite is the BVE Burger, which I ordered tonight, and it can be made with a beef or chickpea patty and mayo or vegan garlic mayo. I opted for beef with the vegan garlic mayo and it was fantastic. It also has onion crunchies and sriracha-strawberry jam and everything comes together for one amazing burger! This is my go-to when I visit, but they always have a changing menu of other great options, too.We split a full order of the house made fries, which are always delicious. They're made with rosemary and black pepper and come with house made ketchup, too. The full portion is huge and we couldn't even finish them all.They also have an extensive cocktail, wine, and beer list.Owl House is a good pick, as long as you can get a table! The food is fantastic and the service is friendly."}, {"review_id": "7AsnE04rYbMwD23grsZNeQ", "user_id": "HT7E_UB7ODd-H121b6BbqA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "After reading these reviews I was excited to eat here, but unfortunately I didn't have a great experience. My salmon was so over cooked that it was rubbery and chewy. I ate one bite and left the rest. One of my dining companions also had it with the same complaint. No one came to check on us until well into a normal meal time. When we asked the waiter about it, he and a fellow server rolled their eyes at us. They didn't charge us for it, but their response was poor.Two other people in our party ordered steak and pork. They seemed satisfied. The drinks were mediocre and overpriced. I wouldn't go back."}, {"review_id": "zNilGUjxl_RaLgjiD4yh1Q", "user_id": "m3dKPTZHN0oVH1O4k4hqgA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "We just celebrated our third anniversary and of course we went back to the Owl House on Marshall Street. Are appetizer always is the cauliflower buffalo wings... oh my God they are absolutely amazing and I'm sorry I couldn't get a picture of them cuz I ate them...lolMy fiance had fried tofu and I had the scallops. Mine was absolutely fantastic, Her's I'm not sure...lol she said it was delicious. I'm not converted yet. LOLBut again I have to say their desserts are to die for. They have a white buttercream frosting that you could not tell it wasn't real and actually it's better than real as you can eat more and not gain weight.. well that's my theory anyway. She had a pumpkin cheesecake that looked amazing... she wouldn't share. LOLBut if you've never eaten at the owl house I absolutely definitely recommended even if you're a carnivore, a vegan or vegetarian it is definitely worth it. Very cozy little house parking's a little difficult you may have to walk down the street a little. But on the way back you can work your dinner off :-)"}, {"review_id": "xqAJQw0y0fcqwx_KtcxALQ", "user_id": "rmnuKOsmBYFAe-9Ux_ly5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "An absolute must anytime I'm in Rochester.The food is incredible, wether vegan or carnivorous.The decor is quirky and whimsical, giving this place an artsy vibe.By far, the best part is the people: staff are laid back, interesting , friendly people.

The drinks are deliciousThe food is fantasticThe ambiance is to die forThe outdoor patio is lovelyWhat is my favorite aspect of the Owl House? Easy... THE STAFF!The servers are some of the best people I've ever been fortunate enough to meet.Zack, Slater, Jessie, Kelly, and Lisa are my favorites.Zack and Slater are best buds and have great chemistry. They're constantly competing over who is more macho. Slater also does this funny thing where he calls Zack \"Preppy. It's fucking hilarious.Zack has great chemistry with Kelly and I definitely hope they end up fucking each other at some point.There is a weak link with the staff, however...I'm not so fond of Screech, the moronic bus boy. He has an interesting fashion sense but lacks intelligence. He seems to alienate himself from the rest of the staff. They look down upon him. He is def the only one NOT getting laid, though you can tell he lusts after Lisa. Good luck with that one, dip shit! Haha! The kitchen staff is great, too. Led by fearless leader and head chef, Barf. I'm pretty sure his name is Barf. It's either Barf or Maggot or something gross like that. He's a wonderful man. In fact, he is a man of god. Barf is also the pastor at my church and known for drinking profusely at Rosen Krown.Any who, this place is great. Will def be cumming back."}, {"review_id": "MZO8OtUPk4puVfY2XEMMNw", "user_id": "nkY11VBQ-LuTBEtXHjfbGg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "LOVED the chickpea burger. also loved that there is more than one vegetarian option.

THE OWL HOUSE!I was seated immediately and greeted with lovely smiles on this cold weather day. I ordered the special Tomato Basil & Chickpea Soup with a Kale Caesar Salad on the side. The food was prepped and served at fast speed. It was actually quite ridiculous, but I sure wasn't complaining. The soup was delicious! It wasn't your classic tomato basil because it had a subtle kick to it. As for the chickpeas, it added some texture to the soup. I think my favorite was the Kale Caesar Salad. The leafy greens looked ultra fresh, the dressing was on point, and the croutons were a nice little addition (only because I really wanted some extra carbs in my diet). I think what made this place so unique is that its vegan/vegetarian friendly, its cute and intimate, and the service is impeccable! It truly was the little things that mattered such as asking if there was anything else that they could do to filling the water immediately and making sure our table was cleared. Personally, I truly enjoyed the unique characteristics of each individual working there. Just from observation, it appears they work really well as a team. The only thing I would comment on is that I do wish their menu was a bit bigger. With such a limited choice (not including the specials), it may make some people feel restricted in what they can choose from. I think everyone should give this place a try! The proportions are sizable for what you are paying for (which is something else I believe is really important)."}, {"review_id": "vKNaNov2lKrfs15WQQUAdg", "user_id": "0A87Wt9nWcYsJx-yTVDULQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "This place never disappoints.  The brunch is bomb, the apps are always on point, and I love how easy it is for Vegan and non vegans to find something delicious.  Also, really love the flow of their staff.  So relaxed, yet professional.  The Vegan nachos are ridic."}, {"review_id": "g7Ni_R0d_1dECJ6OF-Mu4Q", "user_id": "MBPWz1k4UKHj9aTjokYFpA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/16/2017", "text": "This place is a winner.

Finding a parking is a bit challenging especially during the snow period. We picked the second floor for dinner. Since we werent sure which type of wine we want, the waiter offered us to taste 4 different types and then pick our favorite. And we really appreciated this. We got the FALL GUY salar which is super tasty. Its was so rich with feta cheese and walnuts. And the dressing was very nice. The market steak was an 8 oz sirloin, one of the best i have had in rochester. It felt very light, non greasy, healthy and with tons of flavors.  Whereas the fetruccine alfredo i really do not recommend. There was a lot of mushroom in it that was so thick and hard to eat.

I have been wanting to make my own buffalo cauliflower for some time, but figured my first tasting should be by a professional, and not my amateur hands.Enters huge plate of cauliflower smothered and fried with buffalo sauce, and served with cold broccoli slaw. A delicious combo, huge portion (i'd say about 3/4 a head of cauliflower here), and amazingly prepared. I have taken note and look forward to trying myself.The flavors were so powerful I was actually a little disappointed by my chickpea burger with sriracha jam. I couldn't taste the intricacy of the flavor combination, but i still appreciated the fried onion crisps, and melted cheese.All in all, a wonderful meal. Cocktail menu looked great, as well as the non-vegetarian food.

The food runners were also friendly and helpful. Great service here which is always #1 in my opinion. Food: I ordered the foghorn leghorn (mainly for the name) and was not disappointed with its flavor. It was bourbon, apricot, lemon, and mint. I would definitely recommend it for those wanting a light, summery drink. We ordered the cauliflower wings as an appetizer and like other reviews say- GET THEM. you will not be disappointed and meat eaters alike will still rejoice at their delicious buffalo flavor. Also, the best vegan bleu cheese I've ever had. Are you guys making that stuff (Can I have the recipe...PLEASE)? I ordered Krab cakes off of their small plate menu and those were EXCEPTIONAL. Amazing texture, flavor, and appearance. I will say they were a bit rich as my main entree so I would stick to ordering them as an appetizer to share. I had bites of the chickpea patty in a burger which had a great smoky, meaty flavor and the fries were to die for. I would go back for a plate of those alone! Ambience: We went on a Sunday and were seated in the attic and the other patrons were so awkwardly quiet...this has nothing to do with the restaurant but still awkward for me as a diner! Hahahah. Overall, a fantastic choice for vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores looking for a restaurant with a varied menu and expansive drink list."}, {"review_id": "nSM2kaPFn50ERAGmv_OLgA", "user_id": "Qt2kOthm7ONCTHQiI7eaoQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/3/2017", "text": "We were pretty happy to find this vegan friendly place on our way across New York.
