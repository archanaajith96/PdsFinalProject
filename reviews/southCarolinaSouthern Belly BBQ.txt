I always get the plain pulled pork sandwich and it's always really good. They are also really good with working with if something is wrong or not done right. I love the chill vibe inside as well!Customer Service; they are always super friendly every time that I come in. This place is very chill and laid back.Price: $10-15 is the like average range of food so not bad at all"}, {"review_id": "QncaI9htKIzLUTBEyFaXbg", "user_id": "5jJjY5_R06Og56VfjIc66A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Hell's yeah!! As review 1300, this is why I love Yelp - would have never heard of or found this place without you guys!So higher end BBQ in a hole in the wall - love the divey feel and they have the best check in offer ever - free can of ice cold Bud (or was it a PBR) - hey give me a break I just came from Columbia Craft Brewing Co.!!Everyone here is mellow - cool, kitschy atmosphere - kind of dark but you can still read the menu. Bottled and canned beer only but a decent basic selection including some Westbrook.Together we tackled the Django and Avita. The Django had traditional BBQ with grilled jalapenos, red peppers, pepper jack cheese and bacon served on ginormous Texas toast - total flavor bomb (in a good way) for your taste buds. The Avita had Churrasco BBQ with grilled pineapples, Vidalias and red peppers on a French bread roll dripping, nay oozing, with butter. These guys know how to really pair up some great flavor profiles along with their homemade sauces. Sides are simple - either curly fries or a bag of chips - you can switch up and try other sauces if you like.Great concept and great food - just be prepared for a little sticker shock - sandwiches on average are about $12 and up, if you want add ons/double meat. Wasn't completely blown away but still a really cool place to get your grub on!!! The beer is cold and the meat has been rubbed, smoked and loved on!!!"}, {"review_id": "KzvA7dcIONKhE_Dq_kBjwA", "user_id": "2AmmSJ3XHilo0dZuIV6Vow", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "This place was packed when I walked in on a Monday night. As a result, service was pretty slow even though I was able to grab a seat immediately at the bar. The main source of the problem seemed to be that they could only cook 4 sandwiches at a time on the small flattop grill that I could see from my seat.I ordered a couple of beers while I waited and decided on the D'jango. It was delicious! I'm not a huge fan of ordinary barbeque sauce but this was totally different. I was a little bit worried it would be too spicy, especially with the addition of the pepper jack cheese and jalapenos but it had the right level of heat. I would consider it one of the best sandwiches I've had. I just wish it came with better chips than just a store bought bag of Lays."}, {"review_id": "9FI8aYvzNASB3w0rNZPfvA", "user_id": "Qt6YORM8_aIjjSZJBTq0Ig", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/9/2017", "text": "July 2017Came in here with a co-worker for lunch. Small, divey atmosphere that certainly seems more suitable for a Saturday night football game. Looks like it would be a great place to pound some beers. The menu was small but varied with the BBQ sandwiches being the focal point. I ordered the Wookie sized King Kahuna bbq sandwich, which has pineapple on a bbq sandwich. The wookie size doubled the meat. It sounded different and interesting so I ordered it. I was a little disappointed. The bbq was fatty and the pineapple was straight out of a Dole can. How hard is it to buy a real pineapple and cut it up? Made the sandwich come across as cheap. It was very messy and salty and overall just an average sandwich."}, {"review_id": "VCp4ve_SAgdMPC37JW5LEw", "user_id": "o0jh4d1HN-UaFaBb6lZxgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/25/2017", "text": "I came in to eat with Nancy.  I saw  that when you check in, you get a free Budweiser, that started things out on a positive note. We was catching up and didn't even look at the menu so when Ellie, our server,  we couldn't even order.  She remained friendly and didn't seem to mind that we was taking our time to order. We even moved to the bar to watch the remainder of the Bengals and Packers game. I ordered the the Django sandwich with the 7 sauce sampler. The meat was smoked perfectly and wad not over seasoned. I love the peppers that was on the meat and gave the perfect kick to the sandwich. The decor was different but fitted the restaurant, in front of the restaurant,  there was a rosemary plant in the entrance and I love the smell of it.The staff was great and we had great conversation with them. I will definitely come back."}, {"review_id": "4UEGRiRcbvwQ3zPWE_BTFA", "user_id": "8TTQtNAkN8inZRNLb3q-3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Such a welcomed surprise!!!!!!

They have great BBQ, and cold beer! The don't have appetizers or dessert, they serve great BBQ and cold beer, that's their thing ! 4 stars They could do much better with their fries.

The pulled pork here is amazing. Super juicy and tender. We tried a sauce sampler that came with curly fries, and my favorite sauce was the Rebel Red. The Sherman was my second favorite, similar to a hot salsa. I didn't care for the Alabama or Asian inspired sauces (both mayo based), but all the others were really finger-licking good too. I ordered the Grilled Cheese (bacon, cheddar, and pulled pork between two slices of toast with Rebel Red sauce). Swapped out the coleslaw for a few extra curly fries. I savored every bite. High recommend this place. Service was friendly and attentive. Good value. Best BBQ I've had since moving to Columbia."}, {"review_id": "AItQa_2TWZrWraVahV4BQQ", "user_id": "dOxym6d93GacDgqQjL0lCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "I'm a huge fan of traditional Southern BBQ. I'm typically used to the huge buffets with all the trimmings and fixings, but a sandwich is a huge meal at Southern Belly. I was very happily surprised at how much I got for my money at Southern Belly. The only thing that dooms it is it's location off of Harden Street in Five Points puts parking at a premium, but if you can find a parking space within a block or two you'll be in for a BBQ sandwich well worth the aggravation of trying to park."}, {"review_id": "Q4TaNO53LMGzI3Qr8o0vrA", "user_id": "dbk6SBSuJJEcJDnvk-c-Ag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Stopped in on our way to Myrtle Beach.

We were hanging out 5 points and came across this joint. Upon entering U could see it was a relaxed place and everyone seemed to be enjoyin. We decided to sit at the bar and have a few drinks and look at menu. A nice guy leaned over and helped us out on choices, he also bought us a round of dranks!!! Bar service was and conversation was great, I loved the friendly atmosphere! Lots of TV screens for you sports fans.The food came out with great presentation and was nice and hot. I dont eat alot of SC BBQ but it was pretty good, had lots of flavor with a abundance of sauce choices. This is a college town so Im very careful on food choices, I dont just eat anything, even tho I was hesitant at first, kinda hole in the wall...This place didnt disappoint, hopefully we will return in the near future.

I would give the food four stars because my sandwich was tasty and I really enjoyed their homemade sauce. However the service could have been much better and really put a damper on my experience here. One thing that could have helped is a \"seat yourself\" sign at the door. Since this was my first time here I didn't know that and stood at the door for about 5 mins before I had to ask a waitress if I could sit down. After sitting it was another 10 mins before my drink order was taken. Since it was a Saturday during lunch there really should have been more waitresses available in order to provide better service. On a positive note the menu provided several unique bbq sandwiches to choose from and the one I ordered, the King Kahuna was great! I would like to give this place another try on a day where they are not so busy."}, {"review_id": "ilLK3aFRH1KZ-hvozMb7wQ", "user_id": "gK9q-OTSYdllXTkZ2NIQfA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/14/2017", "text": "This place was packed out the night we stopped in.  Their menu is limited and focused almost exclusively on pulled pork sandwich variations. To it's credit, the pulled pork here is very good (it better be, it's basically the only thing on the menu).  I had the one with the melted swiss and white sauce and my son had the one with the melted cheddar and the tomato based sauce.  I liked his sandwich better, but both were good.  I didn't love either of the sauces.  The white sauce didn't have the taste of any other white sauce I've tried and it was much thicker.  The other sauce was very thick as well.  They weren't bad, just not amazing as far as barbeque sauces go.  The prices were ok and the service, while rushed, was decent as well.

We saw the reviews on yelp and decided to go into Columbia to visit this restaurant. The wait time for the staff to get to us was really long. In fairness it is a college town and it was the day before Thanksgiving so there was only one waitress that day.That being said the food came out really quickly. Both of my kids got the grilled cheese, which they did not eat but I thought was really good. My wife and I got the southern belly dipper with the white barbecue sauce. I don't know what they put in that barbecue sauce but it was awesome. Also they gave me a free beer because I checked in with Yelp.The restaurants decor was really hip, and very much a college town restaurant and bar. Menu was somewhat sparse, but that was OK if you knew you wanted to get barbecue.
