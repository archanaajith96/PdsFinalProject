Almost missed it because it looks like a boutique not a restaurant. Cute inside, not very many tables, so I made reservations. I had the limoncello crepe and it was the happiest I've ever been at breakfast time. So much delicious marscapone and berries. Honestly the marshmallow cream was overkill but I ate the whole thing all the same. And it was HUGE.Cappuccino was also really good."}, {"review_id": "T9JTO4lI9ZqE8KFFl6SaMA", "user_id": "haI-qPVLSZQTY8TjhIezRA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This place was worth the drive from New Orleans.

They also have wonderful baked goods and their breads are perfect. The meal portions are only reason not 5 stars. Really great food."}, {"review_id": "oLrFH4o_a40DD9I06c7MDg", "user_id": "sxG8mCAr6aN3nIcOpK3Weg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2017", "text": "This place is so cute! It is tiny but I came with my aunt around 12 and it wasn't that busy. I ordered the crepes Benedict- it was pretty yummy! It's Eggs Benedict on top of a gravy and ham filled crepe. I got the vegetable medley as a side which consisted of roasted tomatoes, red onion, zucchini, squash, and some garlic and it was great too! Good portions and my total was around 11 dollars. They bring out a little booklet where you can sign/draw in it when they give you your check, which I thought was cute. I will be back to try their sweet crepes! :)"}, {"review_id": "1vY5TVp0gFAno0zjW8A0jA", "user_id": "N3iPamjVnleNqh7gpUuH5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "I always try to come to Aviary Cafe when I'm in town and want some sweet treats. You should totally drop by during their happy hours and get the half price sweet crepes. I feel like I can eat two by myself. The mascarpone cheese is so rich in flavor so I usually get Banana Foster. The rich mascarpone goes so well with the sweet and tender banana that will melt right away in your mouth. My other favorite is Chocolate Sunshine just because the combination of fruits and chocolate is just so delightful."}, {"review_id": "8KsiEQjKGOqL6A1MIgiiHQ", "user_id": "SCMIhG_zrrGRh92IHJN3HA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "First visit to Santa Fe.

We had  a fabulous young lady serving us too - didn't hover, didn't ignore, answered our questions thoughtfully and thoroughly, and didn't ramble. We are both big fans of crepes anyway, so we chose to share an entrée, add a side of sweet potato fries, and each order a dessert--that way, we could sample three crepes. Lunch was Crepe Lorraine - I ordered Hollandaise too but it went virtually untouched because the mornay was divine. The order of fries wasn't big, we definitely wanted more. Dessert was Bananas Foster crepes and Lemoncello crepes. Tough call on which was better. Both had the most delicious crème sauce. Neither of us could taste very much lemon, if at all, but the berry puree was so flavorful, it would likely be difficult to distinguish by itself. This restaurant was darling in design and charm. It was all about birds and cages but very unique and fun to look around, including the ladies restroom. Please open an Aviary Café in St. Louis!"}, {"review_id": "mwbTb-oyMtIp6EMATlOx1Q", "user_id": "ZCpQYiyF3Uyds_lqavCoYA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/4/2017", "text": "I love the atmosphere (both inside and out), and the entire menu is delightful.

The food in itself is very very filling and tasty. You get to order and eat a variety of brunch like dishes that can sustain you all day! The only flip side for me was that the food was slightly extra greasy and the wait time for the food to come was a little more than my liking.

Seriously impressed. The restaurant was cozy, comfortable, and clean. The food was absolutely delicous-- the fruit looked and tasted fresh, and the crepes looked just like their website pictures. They were rich and flavorful without being heavy or too salty. The coffee wasn't gourmet, but it was smooth and good. Lauren was our server and she was fantastic-- attentive, friendly, and kept the drinks refilled. Any visit back to the Springfield area will definitely demand a return visit!! Loved, loved, loved the whole experience!!"}, {"review_id": "m9VfTjlW6HewRdwYIR3dXA", "user_id": "_VKyCOvtRfyLzrMDxZev9Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/30/2017", "text": "Been wanting to try this place forever, but it's always packed. Went in for my wife's birthday, and was actually shocked by the price of a \"French pancake.\" Very expensive, and a small selection. I wouldn't recommend this place for dinner; it was more like a breakfast/brunch spot. The service was fantastic, but the food was just too \"nitchy\" for me; and to be honest I wasn't that impressed. I felt both our dishes lacked flavor, and anything rememberable."}, {"review_id": "9BfoFUMPmYcO2Ki_OkGD2w", "user_id": "vEXaeTeMkyMErp1zIi2j4A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/22/2017", "text": "Fantastic brunch in a place with character. ..not your cookie cutter menu or atmosphere."}, {"review_id": "QeQWsIWftgJkSqzJCc3CiA", "user_id": "GWnYL5L0SvD95vdA6Wm7Uw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/3/2017", "text": "Amazing crepes.

The place was small, limited seating. I liked the atmosphere. I ordered the farmer crepes and it was delicious. Light fluffy sweet crepes filled with eggs, cheese and choice of bacon or sausage. I got sausage. Comes with a side of syrup. Yum. I got the vegetable medley as a side and it was also great. We started off with the original pommes frites with garlic aioli as an appetizer and it was wonderful. You can tell fries were hand cut and crispy and the dip was not over powered with garlic. Perfect. My daughter ordered the French toast off the kids menu and she loved it. Everyone we went with enjoyed their food. Brandon was our server and he was great! Great smile and attentive.
