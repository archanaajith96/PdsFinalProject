That means, it is a little slower, but it also means, your meal will be consistently on point. I like my fish sandwiches and Caplinger's rank up there. The batter was perfect while maintaining a juicy interior that leaves you tasting the fish in each morsel. The tarter suave is not your everyday sauce. It offers a hit of sweetness to blind with the salty flavor of the fish itself. Finished off with the pretzel bun. Good stuff. I'll be back."}, {"review_id": "8QnqKtEz-f0rgfLhxVDmyw", "user_id": "KpJWYURQ3PlHUMFZ-qgXNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "If you wish for a fish on your dish,come to Caplinger's 'cos it is delish!I got the house sandwich, the fish o'erspillt the bun (see pic).Very nice.

For lunch today I got a catfish filet sandwich w/chipotle cole slaw and a slice of Keylime pie and it was EVERYTHING! This was my first time trying everything I ordered and I must say I was impressed. The filet was very meaty and breaded well, my only complaint is that it wasn't fried hard enough which is totally my fault for not requesting. They give you more than enough slaw and the chipotle flavor fit perfect."}, {"review_id": "ZnsNJ_NK86KfEezozdhLng", "user_id": "fm-a4M1DqXSLongd5sdKQg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Oh my Goodness!! This place is so awesome for so many reasons! Conveniently located across the street from my Sister's place and right next door to my Best Friend's job meaning I am here WAY TOO OFTEN! I love that everything is fresh and you can get it prepared for you right then and there! They also cater and can custom make seafood boils for you, a fact I did not find out until about my 3 visit! They have such a diverse and inclusive customer base, they have competitive prices (so no it's not good because it's cheap) but they also accept Hoosier Works for families who can't pay out of pocket for delicious, fresh and healthy seafood! I absolutely love it! If you read my reviews you know when it comes to food I am a creature of habit, I don't like to stray away from a good thing once I find it. So when I go I always get the Shrimp Po'Boy with extra pickles. The pickles are bread and butter pickles but they have most complex layer of flavors that I have ever tasted in a pickle, because usually I am not a fan of sweet pickles, but they've changed my mind. On the po'boy comes a nice healthy amount of fried shrimp, lettuce, tomato, pickles (of course) and a delicious sauce who's identity (and ingredients) I still have not yet uncovered. Whatever it is it is absolutely delicious and for now that's good enough for me! Do expect to spend a little time here because they are always busy with customers looking to get seafood, order food or purchase some of their specialty seasoning blends. But the wait is well worth it and the super friendly staff keeps you in great spirits!"}, {"review_id": "9jlNrIN0PSRw8kTy6KG94w", "user_id": "OHmeDGEYVIIcZJEhn4IGmw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "This place [as well as the Whitestown location] is FIRE!

Their raw oysters though! So fresh, and filling. Friendly, knowledgeable and personable staff. Usually pretty busy, but SO worth the wait.

The selection of fresh seafood can't be matched in Indy.  Carry it out, eat it there, or take it home and cook it yourself. My only issue is, you need to be willing to invest in a wait. I normally call in, but sometimes I've had to wait 15 or more minutes to get grub after I waited 15 before arriving. It's always busy due to the quality of food. Hell, sometimes they don't even answer the phone for carry out bc they're too busy.  If they could straighten out the organization and make service more efficient, I'd give this place 5 stars no doubt.

Oh boy was that fish sandwich good. You can get it fried or grilled with lettuce, tomato and red onion with sweet pickles and tartar sauce. It was a huge piece of fish.

Don't come here looking for a quick bite. Almost any time of day, the line is out the door. Because it's that good. And even after you order, you're probably going to wait for a table, and then you're going to wait for your made to order food. But you'll do it, because it's just. that. good. The deli line winds around Cap's seafood counter, full of gorgeous fishes and shrimps. They also sell a variety spices and fry mixes, if you feel like cooking for yourself. By the time you hit the register, you're walking past a tempting cooler of desserts. You'll have time to peruse the menu, and really can't go wrong with anything on there, but may I suggest the Caplinger's Special? If you get the Cap's special dinner basket, you'll get the most beautifully fried fish coated in an amazing spicy breading, pipping hot, fresh out of the fryer. If you opt for the sandwich form, that perfect fish comes on a delicious roll with the traditional fixings. And the sides....... The greens are probably not vegetarian, but definitely amazing. The sweet potatoes are incredible. And you can't hate on the hush puppies. When you're ready for real seafood in Indy, make an afternoon of it, and give Cap's a try. ...And soon this will be your place, too."}, {"review_id": "PIDTS5o3wX5nqu7Q81Imeg", "user_id": "Bw1WuZCdOh8L-g_htuTYDg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "Finally, I tried this spot out! I must say it was totally worth it. Let me just say, I'm a huge seafood lover! Every since my favorite restaurant closed it's doors, finding great fresh seafood when I don't feel like cooking it has been an unfulfilling search. So I decided to give Caplinger's a go. I love the decor of this place and I like that there is no fishy aroma. That's how you can tell you're getting nothing but freshness. They have an array of selections to choose from. I tried the Caplinger's Special (Basa sandwich) and got a order of fried okra. It was delicious! The fish was fried perfectly. The crust was golden and very flavorful. My okra was good even though I like mine fried a bit harder, it was still decent. They definitely won me over as a customer. I'd be visiting again to try their lobster roll. If you're looking for fresh fish to cook at home or have it prepared for you, I definitely recommend giving Caplinger's a try!"}, {"review_id": "Wmb47hEHCaaUvEUREyA2MA", "user_id": "iJnzniiM5pTcD0b5PneTfg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/14/2017", "text": "This is my favorite place for seafood in the whole city.  Their selection is great (even compared with coastal areas), their preparation is great and their music is great (blues).   Their \"Special\" (Basa fish) is very tasty and a huge filet.  A really great value for the money at lunch.  I normally don't care for tuna, but their smoked tuna is awesome.  The seafood pasta is excellent too. Both are available by the pound from the case at the end - no need to stand in the \"prepared food order line\". It looks small, but there is a second seating area. My only complaint is the parking.  They share the small lot with a few other tenants in the strip mall, and all the spots are often full.  But I hope they never move."}, {"review_id": "2BB6q6fylZ8m3E2JasFQvg", "user_id": "Pm7KNGZ1QdFSjhoq0YTkbg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "This was recommended to me by a very good friend of mine.  Im usually hesitant about trying different places, but surprisingly this place was really good.

I got the fried shrimp po boy sandwich and it so so tasty! I think the tarter sauce carried most of the flavor but the shrimp itself was pretty good as well. However, the sandwich was just fried shrimp, tomato, lettuce and tarter sauce. I think it could've used something extra but I was still pretty happy with it. Also, it hurt my stomach a bit, but I'm assuming that was the tarter sauce since I'm not too used to it. I learned the hard way today that Caplinger's is so delicious the line can be quite long. I walked in at 12:30 and walked right out. Instead I ordered online and came back an hour later and picked it up. So I highly recommend ordering online to avoid the long line.

I will start off by letting you know I'm not a big seafood fan, but did try it and will say the Caplinger's special worth their in house tartar sauce it was has them deserving 3 stars (if not more). However, I tried the chicken, the macaroni and cheese, the baked beans and well they were meh. Like shrug your shoulders, already thinking about what to have for dinner meh. Lacking in flavor where you just want there to be so much more. I will say that the market aspect is nice where you can buy fresh, I guess as fresh as it can be in Indiana, seafood as well as other culinary sidekicks for fish. Be prepared to wait and if you sit inside have someone grab a seat while you order because it fills up fast, but if you are looking for something different to try for lunch, stop by!
