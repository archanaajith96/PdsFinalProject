If you're a first time visitor, the chicken and waffles are a must. You can choose to have 4 fried wings, or 2 boneless breasts as a sidekick to the waffle. If you're feeling fancy, spring for the red velvet waffle.. it's pricey but definitely worth it!Kelsay and I normally get the classic C&W's, but we've also sampled the Grilled Chicken Sandwich, the C&W salad, the sweet potato waffle fries, and many of the side items. Literally everything we have tried has been amazing. If you haven't decided to go after reading this review.... JUST DO IT! We wouldn't steer you wrong.We'll be featuring Kiki's on our instagram page @redplatespecial !"}, {"review_id": "ubsUEeME8wSd17VMfgW-mw", "user_id": "hKWL9GLuepc9C_f9enc-bw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "My boyfriend and I came to this restaurant for a second time yesterday evening. We were seated in less than 10 minutes. The food was delicious and came out promptly. We got the sweet potato fries with a cream cheese sauce that was Devine. For the main course, I got the Kiki's soul food plate, but I switched out the wings for chicken breast (with no extra charge) with the mashed potatoes and the Mac n cheese. My boyfriend got the classic chicken and waffles but switch the original waffle for a red velvet one. Both of us enjoyed our meal and our waiter was really good (he's name was Mequis!). He came exactly when we needed him too but not too much to be annoying. I didn't really like the Mac n cheese but I just wanted to try something new here so definitely not the restaurants fault. Overall we had a great experience and can't wait to eat our leftovers the next day!Customer Service: A+ even though it was busy Price: not terrible but plan on spending $20-30 on a meal but you get large portions. Wait Time: less than 15 minutes"}, {"review_id": "TKyrKTEcl4nWQHnBihDQqQ", "user_id": "CHmpNi44ySHrK3Wi7hyybQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Chicken is seasoned and cooked perfectly.

I mean, Columbia has some great restaurants and I love my city, but there just isn't a \"place\". Kiki's is that place.I've never had chicken and waffles before. It was just something I saw on TV and was like...man that'd be cool to have. Too bad I don't go to Atlanta often. Well, I discovered Kiki's and it was basically life changing.My first bite made me smile. Literally. It was so good I smiled. The chicken was perfectly crispy and juicy and it just worked perfectly with a waffle/syrup. It was perfect in a sense. I got the original chicken and waffles with chicken breast. It was amazing. Kiki's is pretty high up for the best fried chicken I've ever had. It was everything I wanted it to be and then some."}, {"review_id": "tLwQLCjqNwXcmZdvyvXgQA", "user_id": "Q98mdmo_U1LtWJeRiOJQfw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "I so wanted to love this place. I had the wings and French toast with a side of Mac n cheese. The French toast was delicious. The wings were hot but lacked any type of seasoning. I actually began pouring syrup on the wings to at least interest my taste buds and that worked out pretty well. The Mac n cheese was very generous in the cheese department which I like...but it was Luke warm. A lot of Luke warm cheese doesn't sit well. Their booths are all wood, not very comfortable to sit at. I went to the restroom during my meal, gone for maybe three minutes, and a server, not my waitress, says it's a good thing you came back I thought you left I was about to throw out your food... I had eaten half a wing and a couple bites of French toast at this point...ok. The waitress bought me a to go tray before I was half way finished with my meal. Nevertheless I won't be returning. Looking through the photos I noticed their prices are steadily rising which unfortunately does not correlate to rising service or product."}, {"review_id": "dcid89P1NMHKXOmd9J35Ig", "user_id": "bsuCAKFQViDNUN4ltCdE3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "The ambience is not too noisy, but a fun place to enjoy your meal.... and for your sports enthusiast lots of tv monitors to watch the games... the service was excellent...on the menu it said no substitutes.. but they were able to sub out fries with my shrimp platter for steamed vegetables.. I'll give that a thumbs up!!!  The shrimp platter was excellent, they were very Crispy, seasoned to perfection the vegetables were firm & delicious...Hubby had the wing platter, I tasted one of his wings, tasted a bit of paprika & garlic seasoning...They have a bar now... awesome!!!Our server Cj, was on time with our meals, and still hot!!'

Love how you can switch out wings for 2 breast. But let me also talk about the service. It was great! Our waitress was nice, offered great options, and check in on us several times. I have seen people talk about service here, and for that matter at other breakfast places. I believe the main issue is what time you going. If you expect great service, try to go when a restaurant opens up. Admittedly, you should always have great service. But people are human. So if you go to the middle of pack brunch hour, you may catch a waiter after dealing with hard to please a guest. The main issue with bad service is understaffed restaurant trying to handle a mad rush of people within a peak 3 hours time frame. NO ONE GOING TO BE HAPPY UNDER THAT SITUATION! Especially if you're not getting tip properly. But if you're going to go to breakfast on Sunday after church, with everyone else in the city at that time frame, be patient! Understand what your waiter is dealing with."}, {"review_id": "hC8IEpbYr-Jz7YJ73fA5Bw", "user_id": "kPgNVSxXnhkyWBkqTcW45g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/23/2017", "text": "So, look! I just rolled in 42 minutes before closing (ravenous and goal-driven) and was treated like royalty! First, Amani is an angel! He took great care of us, offered suggestions, and effortlessly handled our rapid-fire order. We settled on the soul food plate with a half waffle and-- dear God-- it was EV-ER-Y-THING!!! I'm talking...  piping hot, fresh, delicious, and remember, they were closing soon! DO YOU HEAR ME??? ... Sections were closed, chairs were stacked in some parts of the restaurant, and a staff member was already mopping. Despite all of that, we were greeted immediately upon entering, seated promptly, and didn't encounter the dreaded heat lamp warmed, stale (\"Sorry, we're closing soon and don't want to cook fresh food\") chicken and sides. You'd have thought is was the friggin' middle of the day! These guys have it all: Quality food with stellar customer service to seal the deal! For that, I'm a FAN and plan to return before leaving town if I can! (Please Lord, let it be!)  Thank you, Kiki's, for a 5-star dining experience tonight ...

Price are moderate and servings are appropriate with good service. I agree with some, that the wings need a dash more seasoning , plus I will ask for a crisper waffle. Tried the sweet potato and it has really good flavor and despite the butter and brown sugar  it was not overly sweet-good thing. Please note the place is a little in the cut, so pay attention or you will miss it."}, {"review_id": "5whlDQjsGLAmj0KPfEvAjA", "user_id": "CuHoyQRQ9RtffF_u52aesw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "Amazing restaurant!
