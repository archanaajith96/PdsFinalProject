Jalapeño Bucks feels like it's located in the middle of nowhere even though it's literally right off of the 202. As soon as I parked and got out of my car, I knew I was in for a treat. The smells of BBQ filled the air and makes your mouth start to water. You'll most likely have to wait in line, but it's so with it. The menu is fairly simple but has all the \"staples\" of good BBQ. There are burritos, quesadillas, sandwiches and... just meat. I ordered the brisket quesadilla and let me tell you... it was full of greasy brisket goodness! On the side I got their Spanish Rice which, I must say, is a must-have! All of that (along with a bottle of water) cake to about $15. Not bad for good BBQ as far as I'm concerned. Only thing to be aware of... yes the rumors are true... no public restrooms"}, {"review_id": "zWh4D-OwMTOUGR18CCVSDQ", "user_id": "4KtHuBchN4maKtV5JL_m7Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Super good BBQ!!!!We tried the pulled pork sandwiches and they were soooo good!! I love how they leave the BBQ sauce out of the sandwich and let you pick ones on the table yourself. This way you get to actually taste the amazing smoked meat instead of having it drenched in sauce, and then pick the sauce that you actually want. I tried all 4 sauces and then opted to eat it without sauce because the meat tasted that good.The Mexican good options that other people ordered around us looked amazing as well.Minus a star because they don't have public restrooms. We had to drive to the park nearby just to use a restroom afterwards."}, {"review_id": "tUYh3j9ZTf64vHgSxZCBqQ", "user_id": "C3O_9k-4ItnP8b8XaPbojA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "They do not have public restrooms. I had the worst customer experience as a result of this. I brought my family of 5 there for dinner last week and we had just ordered our food when my 4 year old daughter indicated she needed to use the restroom. We went looking for restrooms and saw the sign that said \"No Public Restrooms\". I went to the counter to see if they would make and exception but I only received attitude instead. I then proceeded to ask where the nearest public restroom was located. The cashier said that there is one available on the corner of Val Vista and McKellips. So I left the rest of the family with my daughter in tow to only find more citrus groves on the corner of Val Vista and McKellips. The nearest public restrooms happen to be 4 miles away! On the corner of Val Vista and University. So not only does Jalapeno Bucks not have public restrooms but they do not even know where the nearest public restrooms are. So after an 8 mile round trip risking a toddler accident, I ate my cold brisket sandwich while the rest of the family waited as they were already done, ruining our family dinner.- The Peanut Butter and Jelly Brisket Sandwich is delicious. I love this place, but they need restrooms. How can they operate as restaurant with no public restrooms?"}, {"review_id": "PfiX6Cij6eBCDjpNmCdLFQ", "user_id": "IxC_jYxhtmJD8JqZHfSOOA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "This place is terrific. Had the mango salsa which is superb. I like salsas that are a bit on the sweeter side and it had a perfect blend. Mind you a medium size back of chips is like HUGE. I wish we would have gotten a small. They give you like a brown grocery bag full of chips. Also had the brisket sandwich. The meat was extremely well cooked I loved it. Bread was a little doughey tbh and the beans very average. I heard the Mac salad is terrific and I wish I would have gotten that.

They don't even make exceptions for toddlers who can't hold it and there's nowhere around. It's a far drive so my kiddos have to go EVERY TIME. Plus it's uncomfortable to eat when you need to use the restroom AND nowhere to wash your hands after eating BBQ. Wish they would get a port a potty at the very least. Every time I'm there I hear customers asking for the restroom so not sure why there still isn't any.

When I think Mexican BBQ I think carne asada but this place is so different. It takes a simple and delicious Mexican dish like Green Chile (both in pork and beef) and Red Chile and really makes it great. Then it adds great BBQ like brisket, ribs and pulled pork. Wow! First the BBQ. I have only tried the pulled pork with the coleslaw and it was done very well. The serving is quite big with two options, 1/4lb and 1/2lb. You can always order meat by the pound as well. My favorite part was the BBQ sauce options that they bring out to your table. The BBQ is smoked with a dry rub and you have your option of sauce at your table. This style of BBQ they don't claim to be from any particular region. They call it AZ BBQ! Whatever they do it's great. The sides. They have coleslaw, Mac salad, rice, beans, and you have the option to purchase a bag of chips. The rice and beans were good. Nothing amazing or different but good especially because the star is the Green Chile. The coleslaw is very sweet but complimented the spice form the bbq sauce I chose. I purchased some Mac Salad for my son but it was also sweet. It was like coleslaw with pasta added. Too sweet for my taste but not awful and pairs great with BBQ. Now the Mexican food. The salsa options are there and their chips are warm and salty. Just what you need to accompany the salsa. The Red Chile from the burrito needed a bit of work and it's not what I'm used to. It needs more flavor. The menu said it was spicy but I didn't think so. The Green Chile burrito (I prefer the beef and make sure to add cheese) is spot on. I personally make Green Chile differently but it doesn't mean this isn't any good. It's not spicy but has flavor. The burrito is big and I shared with my husband. The meat on both Chile's is very tender. And the burritos are packed with sauce. The menu is very simple and straight forward but the food is done right. The lines are always long but you get through it fairly quickly. The ambiance is great! You're outside in a grove of orange trees. There's hummingbirds all around. This time of year it's great for eating outside. Please remember that there is ONLY outside seating at this place."}, {"review_id": "J1cErW--G-prj9m8S0HhoA", "user_id": "VcSn4Iv_xuD3VXKENntujQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "OMG...best bbq I have ever had in my life!!!!

The brisket was very tender and paired well with the soft bun. The coleslaw was very sweet and creamy (FYI -it does have onions in it for those who don't like onions). The burnt ends were good but we preferred the brisket over the ends. However, it was late in the day and that might contribute to their dryness. The green chili burrito (with cheese) is a unique combo of flavors. It's VERY liquidy and is hard to eat as a burrito. For me, the cheese overwhelmed the flavor of the meat. It was good but I don't think I'd order it again. The tortilla was freshly made and very tasty. They have 4 sauces, all were good, some with more of a kick. Our favorite was the mud sauce which had a mustard flavor that we both enjoyed."}, {"review_id": "emsDHQ-Q326LnKfpNSvoyA", "user_id": "VC0mAU0Og_bJoWipA9roJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "You can't find better brisket anywhere else in the valley.

For me, the brisket eclipses everything here. It is life-changingly phenomenal, moist, smokey... and will stick in your mind for years, trust me. Be sure to try the other BBQ fare, like the pulled pork, burnt ends, and ribs. But me, I gotta have at some brisket each time. When I go, I tend to get a brisket sandwich with bean and I share a red chili beef quesadilla with whoever's with me. The Mexican food is on par with what's available from local upscale sit-down restaurants. You'll love the various salsas, especially the mango.There's enough here to change it up each visit without feeling in a rut... even if you're like me and have to get some form of brisket EVERY SINGLE TIME you drop by.They had me at Jalapeño. They keep me coming back with great service, food, and the farm-style homey experience.Look for the weathervane.

I grew up in south Tx and Dad smoked a brisket almost every Sunday in my teen years. So I've had my share of brisket. This brisket is very rich in smoke and that's a good thing.

Then it's placed on this buttery, squishy, big dinner roll (like) that has a very light amount of some aioli. Almost no fat on the meat but sooooo juicy.
