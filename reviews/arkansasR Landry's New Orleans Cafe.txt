Got there and they didn't have a table. When they did, it was in the back corner. I get to eat here once per year and couldn't see the menu from my seat... the food is good as always.

Went with a group of six on NYE and we waited maybe 15-20 minutes. They had a live band which is always a good thing! I ordered the Catfish Royale, which was blackened catfish topped with crawfish etouffee..all on a bed of rice. So tasty and they are very generous with portions.

The portions are large, so get ready to eat or take some home for lunch the next day. My husband and I definitely do not mind.

The gumbo was well flavored, but was a pretty small portion. The catfish portion was large and very tasty. The side salad tastes like it was out of a bag and nothing to write home about.

The customer service was amazing from being welcomed coming in to being thanked on our way out. Our server was a lot of fun. I made a special request to a menu item and they made it happen without question. I really enjoyed the meal. A little advice: if they tell you it's a lot of food, believe it! :-) The music was incredible too. I'm hard to please when it comes to restaurants but R Landry's New Orleans Cafe exceeded every expectation!

My dining companion had the red snapper, and he loved it.  I took a bite, and for frozen it was not bad.  It's not fair for me to rate this place compared to a restaurant chain that serves fresh fish, but for the service, and the overall food, I will give it a solid 3 stars.The frozen oysters brought it up to a 3.Stay hungry my friends..."}, {"review_id": "afm-R8usIcRa2TQGooq3Cw", "user_id": "An1GvMubi7LUBn3ZSZqeeA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2017", "text": "We were visiting Fort Smith for a weekend away from home.  This was on a \"best of\" list I ran across somewhere and Cajun hit the right chord with what I was wanting.  The hubby wasn't to sure when we saw a picture of the menu on a yelp review but we decided to give it a try.  Boy are we glad!  I had the Mahi Mahi blackened fish tacos and he got the Red beans and Rice with Andouille sausage.  They were both DELICIOUS!  We got an appetizer of fried green tomatoes (YUMMM). My husband got the fried zucchini as his side also really good.  We sat in the bar and it was very comfortable.  Mickie was the bartender and she is very attentive, it was kind of fun to watch her work as it was busy and she seemed to never stop.  He had two local beers I don't remember the first one but the second was a Core beer called Arkansas Red.  Great experience all the way around and we would go back again."}, {"review_id": "wqNZB8g2ygfxrmlf1tZ8gA", "user_id": "oIgunmdbM1_nCWvxD5Hp-A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/26/2017", "text": "Really liked this place, even though did not think I would.
