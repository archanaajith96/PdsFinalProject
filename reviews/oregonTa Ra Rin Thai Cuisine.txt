My perfect pad thai leans on the saucy side. While this place tends to always be more dry, it normally is still flavorful. However, the last few times I've ordered from here the pad thai was DRY AS CALIFORNIA and as a result EXTREMELY bland. Another bummer for me is that I always ask for my pad thai to be made spicy and whenever it comes out never spicy no matter how much i emphasize that I want it SPICY. Anyway, go for the pad see ew or the pad khee mao here. Those never disappoint. The pots of gold appetizer is also A plus."}, {"review_id": "HHlAMHIwVUZOEpeuMLz5Hw", "user_id": "JmJlcjIG0WxI652UdEtPXw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "A friend recommended this place, and he was right, the food is delish!  Portions were very large, so plan on sharing or having leftovers. Our hands down favorite was the Pad Thai. It was perfectly cooked, and the sauce was tangy, and mildly spicy. We also had yellow curry and Teriyaki chicken.   We were full and happy when we left. Service was attentive and restaurant was clean with a good sized crowd."}, {"review_id": "hW6Wt7xU0cMewrrObXEgtw", "user_id": "bI0lvh1gm7lcI3nOrQTc7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Was in Eugene and craving Thai food. Found this spot and based on the reviews decided to give it a try. Small parking lot at this location . I found street parking across the steer . Meter but was free because after hours. Inside was clean and spacious . Service was friendly. A short wait before I got seated as there were several people in front of me waiting as well. I initially got seated at a booth all to myself , but asked to move to the bar area so I could watch the football game. I was moved without a problem. Bar area is nice. TV behind the bar made it easy to watch the game. Service was quick to get my drink and food order. I decided to go with tofu pad thai. Food was really good and decent portion . Very delicious and filling. Good atmosphere inside . Overall great experience and would recommend anyone craving Thai food in the Eugene area to come here."}, {"review_id": "P3AcHZ-bR786CRSZobUAjw", "user_id": "vfUvHnqXndhTqMEDigY2mA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "Eh, not impressed. Got there around 7, and was immediately seated. That was nice. Had a sufficient amount of time to look at the menu. We ordered pad Thai, Tom Kha, and Pad See Ew. Waited around maybe 20-30 minutes before receiving our food and my ordered came out wrong. The waitress ordered a different noodle instead of the Pad See Ew. She immediately reordered it, and it came out within maybe 10 minutes. The food was decent, but I think overpriced for what it was. The entrees will run you about 17$ each if you include some type of protein in them, and the soup I believe was 13$. Not terribly priced, but for how the restaurant is, I would of expected lower prices. The food was also strongly flavored. Don't get me wrong, I love flavorful dishes, but the soy sauce seasoning within the noodles was overwhelming. The tofu was also soft & quite sticky. When it comes to pad Thai, I definitely prefer my tofu to be pan fried then tossed in sauce. They just cut up raw tofu and sauté it with the noodles."}, {"review_id": "vG1qBah8N4sCWFIdNt3AyA", "user_id": "KrVYG-epnMWhfv1QPV2UFA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Stopped in here for a quick lunch and were quite satisfied.It was busy for lunch but we sat at the bar with no waiting. The service was fast and friendly.  We had the appetizer special of pots of gold which were crab wontons fried in crispy rice paper with a sweet chili dipping sauce.  They were delicious. My fiance and i shared the lunch special of yellow potato curry with chicken.  With the appetizer, we left feeling satisfied.  The curry was good but we would have liked some naan with it.It was a good value for lunch and lool forward to trying more of their extensive menu."}, {"review_id": "NQddq4b-K-E7d8ETWFL4Xw", "user_id": "GxVmoHoJj5eehYEV7J4KRw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Best Thai in town.

A few steps up from satisfactory. Seems fairly standard for a Thai menu. The prices appear to be a bit more than average, especially on appetizers. I make my own salad rolls, and a bucket of real peanut sauce, a batch of about twenty five for what they charge for two.Hugely popular, must be the trending thing these days.

They are under construction so you do have to enter the back way, go through the restaurant to the front to be seated. We arrived at about 9:34 and the restaurant closes at 10. Yes, I understand that we should've known better, but we didn't feel rushed at all. Our server was on point and awesome. I ordered the thai fried rice with chicken and my spouse ordered the tom yum soup. It's a large bowl and worth every $13. There is also a large amount of cabbage in the soup if that's what you like. The rice was delicious but I wanted to save some space for the sticky rice with mango so I took some leftovers. That dessert was definitely a great treat and we'll be back when it's not close to closing time!"}, {"review_id": "nqXl0lhbvzrEiHEol_XJgA", "user_id": "nEnvPEBoZE5pR5700Afw7A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Food is ok.

The food was high quality, but, well, a terrible thing happened. See, I always get Massaman at Thai places; it's my favorite. I always order it with \"no spice,\" because it's always at least a little bit spicy--it's a curry, right? I just don't want them to add a bunch of chili peppers to it, is all. Yes, I know I'm a godless heathen and I'm doing it wrong; that's not the point. The point is, I've done this in Thai restaurants all over the country and gotten a variety of spice ranges from \"good\" to \"tolerable\" to (one time) \"I can't eat this.\" Here, for the first time in my life, I got exactly what I ordered. It was basically a cream sauce with peanuts. There was *no spice* in it. So it's an awkward complaint to make, but it's still an experience that has never happened elsewhere, and I wouldn't want to repeat. :/"}, {"review_id": "LMYFppsv6qJ8LL_7MPRPFg", "user_id": "HNjrLGDRQ5WPFEEX_ypBVg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "Some great Thai food!

What more could you ask for in this little hidden restaurant in Eugene. Our favorite restaurant used to be sweet basil downtown but it closed up a couple of years ago and we been looking for a good Thai place to call her own. This may be the one. The khou Kia was terrific. My husband had the pad Thai and he said it was very good. We had an appetizer of shrimp and onion rings and they were also excellent with the honey sauce. I think the only drawback is that they seated us way back by an exit door and so the people next to us were staring at us to look at the TV in the corner by the bar otherwise great experience"}, {"review_id": "dlOTXUsWCKE-m7c52tvO-A", "user_id": "Rx7t8mnuANYweDPRQLOIAA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "On my list of Thai restaurants in the Eugene/Springfield area, this is so far second on my list.
