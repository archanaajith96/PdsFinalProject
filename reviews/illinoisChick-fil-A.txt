It's a big tender piece of salty, fried chicken, has pickles and a nice soft bun. It's the kind of meal that's delicious but afterwards you feel like taking 10,000 bonus steps from. Also, the employees are way over the top sweet and friendly - they GOTTA be trained that way and I really do appreciate businesses that hire teens and yet train them not to be surly and inattentive. It's remarkably noticeable. The place is spotlessly clean, including the bathrooms. There's a fun looking play space that somehow does not transmit any noise or disturbance, just fun vibes from the kids inside. There are lots of days where they will give you a free sandwich for dressing like a cow or other wacky promotions. What is not to love? I can't help it, I love Chick-fil-A."}, {"review_id": "fpqWjSF_H94dyxdWLtptfQ", "user_id": "MuOD5mRcmcmG_s0ZsBNiIw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "It's awesome when you order food and ask for some chick fil a sauce and you never get it...."}, {"review_id": "EH1hLZcjz21rr8Fy6j0ECQ", "user_id": "AGPpo4py80CKj4R9SQEgaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/14/2017", "text": "This Chick-fil-a is always a pleasure to visit.

Maybe because we go here the most. The staff is always extremely friendly and the food is consistently superior. The original chicken sandwich with extra pickles is my go to.

Decided I want fast food and Chickfila is my go to spot. Always get the spicy chicken sandwich, and always delicious.Walked in, greeted by one of the most friendliest upbeat cashiers I've ever met... His name is Kiva! He is the epitome of a great employee and someone I would want as the face of any customer service business. Thanks for making this meal enjoyable, sir!The restaurant was clean and super quiet, even so with a kids play area attached in the next room. Food comes out almost immediately, so if you want to change the term fast-food to insanely fast-food, you could safely do so with this place. There's also complimentary mouthwash in the bathrooms.5/5, completely recommended!"}, {"review_id": "vzRb4mK66z2NAuTgRkq1Qg", "user_id": "1MK3QjzEd5KTdljKIoh4-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/30/2017", "text": "This is literally the only fast food restaurant I've ever been to that has never messed my order up, even when I had all these unique requests like no ice in the drink or no cherry in the milkshake.

I just tried their breakfast about 2 weeks ago. My first taste was the chicken/egg/cheese biscuit. The biscuit was great. Soft, buttery... The chicken breast...if I could even call it that. I think one of those chicken nuggets made a way to my biscuit instead of that chicken breast you would expect. The chicken/egg/cheese biscuit was hard to understand. The combination of the three did not make for a tasty bite.All in all, I hated it. I was let down but still optimistic. I tried CFA breakfast one more. This time, just the chicken biscuit. Better. The chicken was actually a breast and not a nugget. Biscuit was as delicious as I had remembered. This time... the chicken breast was immersed in salt. The tot hash browns.. immersed in salt. The coffee... Un-speakable. The most bitter excuse of a morning beverage. It was bad. Everything about it was bad. Prior to tasting, I had no doubt in my mind that CFA breakfast would be delicious. Now that I've tasted it, I am certain that I did not enjoy it at all. I'm really disappointed. Maybe it's this location? I am not ok with not enjoying a southern delicacy of a chicken biscuit. Maybe I'll try one more. 3rd time a charm?"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/chick-fil-a-aurora-3?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
