The noodles were also unfortunately over cooked & too soft.  I prefer my noodles to be a bit chewy. Egg rolls were just meh...full of veggies & hardly any meat.  I make these at home often & like it just so...with lots of pork & lump crabmeat.  But, I get it, it would be too costly to make it the way I like it.  On the plus side, it was crispy.  Overall, the staff was nice & they know this place won't satisfy a true Viet food connoisseur.  Ingredients are hard to come by & locals prefer the water downed version.  Would I come back?  Sure.  Have to support ethnic diversity."}, {"review_id": "LW6q1gb-kvUuXjzATGnFgw", "user_id": "YgZYVEonuyYIR7Tdn3T8Bg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "It was a cold and rainy night in Evansville.

I'm glad I ordered the small because it was more than enough. She also recommended the egg rolls which were very tasty and crispy.

When im here yes i order all 3 and it never fails the server always looks at me like oh my goodness thats a lot, are you sure? i can assure you he doesnt ask to be mean or rude. Its probably because I'm barely 5'0 and those are all pretty big plates. Like big enough for at least 4 people. lets break each \"combo\" down shall we12- or a.k.a Phò Đăc biêt (beef noodle soup special) rice noodles in a beef broth and spices thats been simmered all day to perfection. Comes with cuts of brisket, ribeye, and meatball. Menu used to say tripe but last time i was there there was no tripe on mine.34-a.k.a Còm heo,gā Uā Tôm Nu ông (chargrilled lemongrass porkc chicken and shrimp with rice) comes with salad and the infamous vietnamese fish and vinegar sauce. 36-Mi Xāo dăc biêt (special fried noodle combination) fried noodle with seafood and veggie.Let me remind you that all of those are for little tiny me, i mean ill share but when i dont i definitely leave with left overs!Another thing they have that is a must have for me everytime i visit is the pork banh mi (vietnamese sandwich) it has pickled veggies lemongrass chargrilled pork,cilantro, and jalapeno. flavor bomb sandwich!I hope this place never changes. Another great thing is that most of everything on the menu is under $10! skip the food court and come here!"}, {"review_id": "Tf_L99fqp9piQqb4WEZAtg", "user_id": "t_K5dl7xxTIGRWu5OvrvRA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "I had the fried wing appetizer and they were good.

Beef Pho.The large bowl was the perfect size.  Good amount of perfectly cooked noodles and meat.  Good amounts of beansprouts and thai basil, and a wedge of lemon.  Only weird thing was they only gave one piece of jalapeno.  I'm sure that I could have asked for more and got some, but its just strange to me.Anyway the soup base was tasty, and better than most, and much better than what I would have expected in Evansville, Indiana for pho!  There was a slight oil sheen in my soup... most beef pho stock is usually completely clear. That being said, the soup wasn't overly fatty and didn't leave a texture or taste in my mouth, it was just a good, tasty broth.Definitely going to try this place again.  Next baseline Vietnamese item: grilled pork."}, {"review_id": "k7Dwypq5neoXnjWuvnzl-g", "user_id": "UwHDSK__LJYNXQnGoR25Uw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/17/2017", "text": "Delicious and huge portions for the family.  Prices were reasonable.

I actually wasn't a fan of pho before this place, but it's literally phenomenonal. I generally always go for the bigger bowl because it's $1 more, and I feel like I'm getting a deal. Realistically, I think I'm just over eating. Another must have, is Vietnamese coffee. I always get it out in California but hadn't found a place that had a real traditional version of it in Indiana. It takes a while to brew, but it's totally worth it. It's strong and slightly sweet at the same time served over ice. Mmm mmm. Will is the server I see every time I'm here, he's funny and energetic.
