My friend and I came here because we didn't want to go too far from home and saw they had brunch. No big deal and we didn't expect much other than just that; brunch. Holy cow were we surprised. The place has a diner turned modern vibe with classic booths and great wall decor to offset the diner vibe. The place was packed at noon on a Sunday, so we were happy to be seated relatively quickly. We had quite a few questions on the menu, and our server was more than helpful. He clearly knew the ins and outs of every part of the menu which just shows that clearly quality is a big thing here. We started off with some cocktails, and let me just say I can guarantee you will like whatever you order off the cocktail menu. Again, clearly so much thought into this! The curious case tasted like I was back on the beach in San Diego, I can't describe it any other way. We each had a \"teaser\" after that. Extremely small bite of food but the flavor was out of this world. I had the octopus bite, which had an herb aioli with malt vinegar and a hit of spice. WOW. So many flavors without being overwhelming.At this point they had my heart. I could have eaten 10 of those octopus bites!! I was in a snacky mood so I got just fries and aioli with scrambled eggs, while my companion got the smoked salmon Benedict. The horseradish aioli was sublime. I could have bathed in that!! My friend loved her meal as well, which came with some refreshing iceberg on the side. I will 100% be back to this hidden gem of St. Paul. Amazing food, atmosphere, and service. Do not miss out!!"}, {"review_id": "c0afDQmr0AFJmH3reY1i4w", "user_id": "P4ybfs4O3pag3mByHcXuzQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I've been meaning to try this place for a while but just never had the time. So my husband and I had a rare day where we were able to stop in and try the food. Other than one person sitting at the bar, we were the only diners at about 3:45pm on a Sunday.First impressions of the space itself?The neighborhood...sucks (I should know, I live here). Parking is limited to street parking: don't park near corners and crosswalks, fyi. Fortunately, the interior of the restaurant did not reflect the area outside. It was calm and classy in a hipster kind of way... Loved the many mirrors on the walls. The restaurant itself has a small cozy feel to it. Also, they have lots of booth seating, which is a big preference of mine. Music level was a little high.The food/drinks?We ordered: flight of cocktails (Jack's Pool, Mother of Dragons, iPalapa No Mas, Erroneous Negronious, Why Not Minot, Cross Eyed Mary), flight of teasers (Bacon&Egg, East Fried Pride, Octopus Prime, The Blues, Shroomin), Steamed Pork Buns, and Six Ounces to Freedom. I really enjoyed the serving sizes/options--I'm the type who can be rather indecisive, so to have lots of options where I can just have a nibble here and there was great.... plus my eyes are always bigger than my stomach and I have a habit of over-ordering and...I'm bad with leftovers...ok, well enough about me! I'm not big on drinking booze so perhaps my feedback on the flight of cocktails should be ignored. A lot of alcoholic drinks in general taste like...some kind of bathroom cleaner--haha! So that was my impression of the cocktails--sorry. My husband, however, enjoyed the Jack's Pool and Mother of Dragons.Flight of Teasers--what stood out for me was the East Fried Pride (who doesn't love pork belly?) and Octopus Prime. The pork belly was delicious, add a little bit of the mushroom mousse from Shroomin to elevate the taste. The tentacle in Octopus Prime was gently charred and not rubbery at all (and my favorite mollusk). The item I liked least was Shroomin--just a bit too strong, too garlicky, but love the little fried enoki on top.Steamed Pork Buns--basically a piece of pork belly over teeny cubed stone fruit and topped with pickled cucumber, wrapped in a soft steamed bun. Not sure what sauces were in this? Delicious either way.Six Ounces to Freedom--my husband ordered this and I took a bite. It wasn't...really anything? To me, it was bland/nothing special. Service?Was great! Our server was patient and informative.And of course, how was the bathroom!?Disappointingly meh. It was clean and well-lit, but very minimally decorated--which was surprising considering the rest of the restaurant. The hand soap... was that typical pink, watery stuff.Would I go back? Hm, probably not--it was pricey and the food didn't blow me away, but now I can say I've been there. Not a place I'd bring my kids to eat for the same reasons. However, I do support businesses like this that are a great improvement to the area. Would recommend a try!"}, {"review_id": "9C6JH5vus5BRmAKRYHE_Yw", "user_id": "fRdEiGSZEf7cAzBp5pvsBg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "The cucumber pad Thai salad was so good we ordered two! We also split the vegasm and the cauliflower dish. Wow! The vegasm that night was vegan dumplings with a curry froth and a salad...very tasty and filling. The cauliflower dish was excellent, I was surprised at how much good we got. I'd love to go back and try the cocktail flight...the cocktails look great and it would be awesome to sample them.The waiter was really good, very knowledgeable about the food and enthusiastic about explaining the dishes.

Let me count the ways!1. We came in on a weekday for lunch with a big party. It was pretty empty and the server was very attentive.2. Mirrors. How cool are all of the mirrors in the front area. We sat in the back but next time I'm going to sit in front so I can admire them all.3. My four year old loves to talk. I don't know if they normally give out crayons to kids but he was able to get some and scratch paper after hustling the server. Extra points for engaging in convo with my little man.4. I asked for warm water. I expected warm water in a coffee cup like most places. I got it served in the cutest Asian style kettle! Whaaaat?5. Great number of vegan options. I am mostly vegan. My husband more than I. The options are exciting too unlike many places that typically have one veggie burger. We had the spicy vegan noodles and the vegasm. 6. Food was delicious! All flavors were unique and spot on. I felt so satisfied walking out of here."}, {"review_id": "Fqc5alAqwAo4nxVyMdcLqg", "user_id": "U0Ktrfuj-HqtgtoupfsOMg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Tongue In Cheek is an inventive, New American restaurant with a menu categorized by teasers, small plates and large plates.

It was about 5:30 pm.We ended up finding street parking right in front of the doors and we walked right in and knew what we wanted: Six Ounces to Freedom burger, the Roasted Cauliflower large plate, and the Crispy Butternut Squash small plate. I also ordered the non-alcoholic \"Placebo Effect\" drink, which came right away. You ordered it based on the flavor profile, I chose spicy because our waitress said they made a good one. It was awesome. Being a non-drinker, I always struggle to find interesting drinks sans-alcohol. I really enjoyed it. The spicyness actually made it a sipping drink. As for the food, the portions were definitely not huge for the prices. It particular, the small plate squash had barely any actually food on it, but the presentation was beautiful, but I could have a full meal elsewhere for $11 so it's a bit hard to swallow. The large plates were also the same issue. Really yummy, really great to look at, really overpriced. But, the inside of the restaurant is awesome looking, the service was amazingly fast and friendly, and the food was quite tasty.Overall, as long as you know what you're getting into for the prices and have your expectations in line for the trendier, more expensive sort of place and portions, then you'll be quite happy!"}, {"review_id": "j7YTc_bOwZu8whfkn_BOwQ", "user_id": "kvj2brFI_noo_-F9HczL2A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "I had a #vegasm last night at Tongue In Cheek. I was sitting at a table with five other people who were all enjoying their own tasty dinners, and I think each of us was resisting the urge to pick up our plates and lick them clean. We went on a night that was oddly quiet - we were one of about four tables that came in for dinner. After squeezing in a few happy hour drink orders, we were seated and able to get our dinner orders in pretty quickly. The only reason I'm knocking a star off is that it took a really long time for the food to come out after we ordered. It was 40 minutes before the sharing plates started to arrive and another 25 for the main dishes to come out. But you forget about all that when you're in the presence of good company, so it wasn't such a bad thing to wait.As I previously alluded to, the food was divine. I was delighted to find some great vegan options on the menu, like the cucumber pad Thai salad and the seasonal rotating #vegasm.

We need to eat here more often.\" That is what I say every time I walk out of Tongue In Cheek, or at least, that is what my partner tells me. Today I ordered the Daily Vegasm. And it was. The complexity and depth of flavor, especially for a vegan entree, is magnificent! Today's Vegasm definitely stood up to a flavorful and meaty entree, maybe even would put one to shame. Mind you, this here woman is a meat-lover all the day. When you can do vegan that well, that's something to sing about. My partner had the Fried Chicken Steamed Buns and a side of potatoes. Oh, man! I sampled them both, and they were also deee-lish. Service is always wonderful. I enjoy the quirks of the restaurant decor. Love love love the casual atmosphere that allows for dressing way up or dressing way down. This place continues to be my top restaurant of choice, place that I would recommend to others. And it gets better. Do you know their mission? Humanely treated animals, only. Duh.

The beautiful display of mirrors behind the bar along with the glorious artwork makes this place stand out. This is just the decor, too.

I did contain my saliva enough to get reservations with a dear friend of mine and his father.The meals were not only mesmerizing in appearance, but they were through-the-roof in flavor. To add to both charming qualities were the fact that it was part of their brunch deal. Basically, we thought we were getting away with murder considering the price point for what we got.

Nothing that I would jump to write a Yelp review over. Ya know?On my last visit, I had the Braised beef cheek. it was very succulent but I wanted more. Now, I will brag about is the amazing cocktails that I have had there.  The first time I went, the bartender made some concoction that I was delicious. I am not one for mixed drinks but this was good.  (Notice how vague I am with description?)  yeah, he didn't have a name for it and I doubt he could make it again, but it was good!!The last time I went to TIC, they were celebrating an anniversary so they gave everyone a shot of something watermelon. Blah, I didn't like the taste but I drank it and still appreciated the free alcohol.  In short, I am prone to visit this place again for the drinks and not the food per se.

This place just continues to amaze me with their inventive menus and flavors, which change practically every month. I find myself constantly amazed each time I devour a dish made of mostly things I would never want to eat (I'm a picky eater). Honestly, I feel like they could make me like even the foods I despise the most. Their only downside is their desserts, which aren't bad but do not live up to the rest of the menu.-----------------------------------------------------8/8/2016Truly amazing. The food is superb; smaller portions but very very filling. The food is delicious, the cocktails are great, and the service is fantastic. The attention to detail, and the priority they place on servicing you is truly outstanding. As amazing as their dinner is, their brunch is even better!I have to say, I've gone back several times now and ordered something different each time. Everything on their menu has been of the highest quality and even though I've been hesitant of some combinations, the dishes are very complete and work seamlessly together. I know that sounds like something they say on the food network, and I certainly didn't understand that comment until I ate at Tongue in Cheek."}, {"review_id": "rHfG2QgeVrGPeNPxNwrG1A", "user_id": "4bzIdyqdphtdICkst1oyPQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "I actually went here for dinner twice in a week's span. Both times together I had or tried the Bacon & Egg teaser, Gravlox Tortilla, Steamed Pork Buns, and Ramen.The Gravlox was surprisingly tasty and a good combination of texture (crispy tortilla and tender salmon). The Ramen was extremely good when it was hot (first 2-3 minutes). It used a clear light broth and was good salty but not too salty. The noodles were the thinner ramen but it went well with the light broth. The pork belly was good as pork belly usually is.The other two dishes were okay, but not memorable.The service was good especially the first time around our server was very attentive. Good try but not somewhere I would make it a point to go back to as there's nothing that REALLY stood out.
