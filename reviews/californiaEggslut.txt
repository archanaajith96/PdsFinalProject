Egg sandwiches are not just for breakfast any more. They can be for lunch, dinner, snack...any time you want and I'm not complaining. I'd have Eggslut any time, any day because their food is phenomenal! I knew they were awesome but I just didn't really realize it until I had my first ever sausage, egg and cheese sandwich from here.One can wonder what's so special about a sausage, egg and cheese sandwich. You may even think to yourself that you can get this type of sandwich at a local fast food joint but let me tell you Eggslut is different. You'll know it the moment you taste it. The quality is superb and the taste is heavenly. Their sausage, egg and cheese has house-made turkey sausage, cage-free over medium egg, cheddar cheese and honey mustard aioli in a warm brioche bun and is served fresh to order.It's rare I give five stars but Eggslut is very much worth it. Buttery bread, fluffy eggs and savory ingredients made for truly the best egg sandwich I've ever had. I cannot wait to be back here!"}, {"review_id": "hUfdcvogXV-T61uhCRO7_w", "user_id": "SLD0Xsq_UJqVk73RmEVnQw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "THE GOOD:Great food.

Who cares about that when you dragged yourself out of bed, your car or whatever gutter you feel asleep in from the boozy Friday/Saturday with your friends. You want EGGS!!! And not just any eggs. The kind of incredible, edible egg that can only be had by waiting in line so long you miss your grand children's high school graduation. Yet, once your pallet is gifted this fluffy, buttery, mountain of all that is golden and holy...btw I heard the butter they use to cook the eggs is infused with babies laughter true story something about YouTube videos of laughing babies being played while it's churned or maybe... Anywho! I digress once your taste buds get a shot of this all the cramps in your legs from locked knees will fade away, the sun seems to be shining only on you. So go be a slut, let your pride swell, your knees go weak and restore your since of self. Strut your slut down the line of those still deprived off all that is egg and holy. Rejoice you did it!

There was a short line to order that Friday morning, which did not take long to get moving. After going through their options, I decided to go with a turkey sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich.There is bar-style seating along the front of the place, where I found a spot right next to the water dispenser. I got my order quickly, and I found the sandwich to be ok. I expected more flavor from it, so I was pretty disappointed. They did not put much effort into making it, and put too much sauce. I've had better sandwiches.I did not try their signature dish, so I cannot speak for that. But I don't think that I'll be coming back here as I was not too impressed with the experience. Maybe it was a bad morning for them? If so, I hope they don't have another any time soon."}, {"review_id": "S0OVzlNxXuKKvDTSQw2WwA", "user_id": "TO0bPuHD4La4L1xcqd5z9Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "First time trying out Eggslut and it didn't disappoint. Although, it was also nothing to rave about. It was the perfect place to stop to start our morning and the easiest way to get some sort of brunch option with a large group. We we're lucky enough to get a few tables outside. The wait was around 25 minutes to get an iced coffee and breakfast sandwich. I had the BACON, EGG & CHEESE -hardwood smoked bacon, cage-free over medium egg, cheddar cheese and chipotle ketchup in a warm brioche bun $8 and a cold brew coffee which didn't really taste like cold brew to me.

Like literal perfect. I was craving it for a couple weeks after. The slight creamy scrambled eggs, melted cheddar cheese, all held between soft brioche buns. The Slut is also very good and interesting - comes in a small glass jar with mashed potatoes on the bottom and on top of it lies a soft boiled egg that is cooked in the jar served with slices of baguette. Yummmm I tried a bite of my friend's egg salad sandwich and that didn't really stand out to me. But that fairfax.. you'll never forget it. The line is always long but moves fairly fast. Like 10-15 minute wait. And if you stand around you can snatch a seat at the booth. I know this place prizes it's quality and attention to detail because although I don't know why and it could be seen as wasteful, but the girl frying eggs had to throw away three, three different times because she didn't like the way they cracked open on the pan. It was like she had to have it just perfect or it was thrown straight into the trash."}, {"review_id": "L0VxblCBNHhcsWnEoilTkg", "user_id": "f6v7OewBFV93YNZEwPY6TA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Bacon, egg, and cheese on brioche is the way to go here for breakfast!  A bit pricey for the simplicity of the ingredients, but it's earned quite a reputation nonetheless.  Coffee isn't anything special; there are plenty of other great coffee spots in DTLA.  Food here is great for the gram.  The line can get VERY long around prime meal times."}, {"review_id": "V2tJOaSCdLJU9qb_NkIxDA", "user_id": "h9KB57xgLp3WpPZulrQ1jg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Hearing all about the hype and long lines at Eggslut, I had to try this place out for myself! When we got there, the line was ridiculously LONG, but hey, it was expected. Since I was with friends and super excited for this place, the wait didn't seem too bad.I'm so glad that the menu is so simple, so I ended up ordering the Sausage, Egg & Cheese sandwich with added avocados, but I went with the next step up - the biscuit buns! I figured the biscuit buns would make my sandwich more brunch-like since it was early and I was craving brunch. When I finally got my sandwich, it was freaking huge! The biscuit is really really filling, so be prepared if you substitute your buns. It did taste really good with the sausage and egg though, like how a perfect breakfast sandwich should taste like. The egg was cooked perfectly with the runny yolk dripping down my hand as I was trying to stay as mess-free as possible (nice try). Overall, I really enjoyed the sandwich, but it did leave me with an enormous food coma afterwards from all the carbs.I really enjoyed my first time at Eggslut and it's crazy how so many people would wait for this place, even with so many other yummy-looking places around!

We got there early on a Thursday morning (~9 am) and there was a small line about 10 minutes long. I would arrive as early as possible unless you are okay with waiting in line.

PARKING: Because it's in DTLA, there's no doubt that finding parking will be difficult. The quickest way (and most of the time, the best way) to go about it is to park in one of those flat fee parking garages. We found one nearby the Grand Central Market that charged 6 bucks. SERVICE:There was no line when we came within the opening hour, thank goodness! The employees were friendly and had our orders out within 10 minutes. FOOD:1) The \"Slut\" (Coddled Egg w/ Potato Puree): Oh my. So darn simple, but it was so darn tootin' delicious! The baguette slices that were served on the side complemented it well. 2) The Fairfax (Scrambled Egg Sandwich w/ Cheddar, Caramelized Onions, & Sriracha Mayo) : Good, but sort of underwhelming. It could have used some more of that caramelized onion flavor. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and deliciously creamy, but I think the brioche bun was the standout of the whole sandwich -- it was buttery and incredibly soft. The Sriracha mayo was a nice complement. RECOMMEND? YesBut go realll earlyyy on a weekday morning. We were glad that we chose to go on a Weds morning to try it. Although the food was delicious, we both agreed that it wasn't \"epic\" enough to justify the \"normal\" 1 to 2 hour wait. We would've set ourselves up for some disappointment if we chose to wait that long.

There was no line when I went and considering it's a Sunday, I was surprised by this. But now I know why. It's overrated. Sure, the BACON EGG and CHEESE was tasty. Anything with bacon and fried egg always is. Does it warrant $7.67 and your precious time waiting for it to be cooked when you know you can make something like this at home yourself? I think not. I was still hungry after killing my sandwich which in a way, was a good thing. It gave me a chance to explore more of what's in Grand Central Market.

The Fairfax had the fluffiest scrambled eggs with melty cheese and sriracha mayo while the Sausage, Egg, and Cheese had that perfect egg yolk burst you'd want in every breakfast sandwich.
