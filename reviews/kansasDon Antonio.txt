Can't beat the price. 4 tacos filled with a lot of meat for $5.00 and they cooked so quick. They also have meats. Will go back again. I love the green chili salsa. My favorite choices are pork/pastor, pork mock/buche, beef/asada , chicken/pollo.This diner is in the grocery, sometimes it might be a long line but it will get moving fast."}, {"review_id": "G6vKmVF-LsOhFtYY_QmI6g", "user_id": "67CVUHs0rDPShpxgkPAS3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "When around this area, you wont find any better.

Haven't had tacos this good anywhere in the Midwest. We ate asada and carnitas tacos. Perfect!! Salsa's are amazing and fresh. Special of 4 tacos for $5 -outrageous deal! Take home dozen tamales for $13 they are fab, huge and smell like grandmas This isn't a place to go only when in the area this is worth driving for. Thanks to previous Yelpers I made the stop!!"}, {"review_id": "pwucOHD_i1aJGyz3yZPT6A", "user_id": "FMXBbottjIZ5_b783zX1Jg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/10/2017", "text": "Four tacos = $5. That is the everyday price and how can you beat that? Especially when they make the tortillas on site. They also have the condiment bar to spice up said tacos with diced onions, cilantro, pico, and 4 different sauces. The place is a bit cramped and was a little slow the Sunday I was there with only 1 cook taking care of the line. They also will Americanize your tacos with cheese and sour cream, but that costs $2 each and why would you? Keep it traditional and economical!!"}, {"review_id": "ZyjYP--F09lS0N1mvvfuww", "user_id": "2ovaJY4Qjk3v-uqNyr_xgA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "The wife was skeptical at first because it doesn't look like much from the outside.  But as the old adage goes.....don't judge a book by it's cover.  This place is hands down one of the best places I've been for tacos, burritos and tamales. Order at the grill and they whip it up in minutes.  There's a little salsa bar to put on your fixings.  Then dig in.  DELICIOUS!!  And if your in the market for hot fresh tortillas they make them right on the spot.  Nothing like fresh tortillas."}, {"review_id": "AbUvhK2jxKi9uepdZibwHg", "user_id": "S47v3O8NiiDnrZcX1Q4Q_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/29/2017", "text": "Fabulous tacos ... all of the options !!!If you want real tasty food and do not care about the ambiance then this is the place to be!Your satiety value will hit its highest peak with the food you have here and trust me it's real cost effective!

I got the special since that's such an awesome deal, shuffled to the side to the \"toppings bar\" and realized there are no toppings,...only sauces. There was no lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, or sour cream. So I had 4 bare-bones tacos but relished he fact that they were only $5:) The drinks were all glass bottles and in fact, the entire joint looked like you were actually in Mexico?
