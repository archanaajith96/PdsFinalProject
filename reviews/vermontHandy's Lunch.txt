Earl (the owner) accommodated our party of 16 with great service. He even stayed open past his closing time (when he needed to pick his son up from school) to make sure we were all fed. The food was great and the staff had excellent recommendation.

As you walk in you want to find somewhere to sit but then realize you only sit at a bar and are served by one waitress. This is a locals lunch spot I would say that 70 percent of the people that come here are regulars. They care about their food though it really is a diner. My son had pancakes that were upgraded with some corn grits for added texture... he said they tasted better than normal pancakes when he goes out and my other one had a breakfast sandwich (again). I didn't have anything because I am on a whole food diet and something about the word diner doesn't mesh with healthy. The prices are incredibly reasonable. Food was better than expected for the price. The waitress was nice and accommodating, the food came on time and was hot. The only issue was that the owner killed the vibe. He was not accommodating to other customers who came in at noon and wanted breakfast. The cook and the waitress said they would do it but the owner flat out said NO to the waitress -- because he would not talk to the customers.... who were right there?! And then proceeded to throw a sandwich at another customer because he was in a rush. Besides the owners somewhat crabby not so nice attitude (that I witnessed) I liked it here."}, {"review_id": "c5tgfC_yF4ycqjMd4dtivg", "user_id": "SiQ4m9rVYZIys2dn6XhdpA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/19/2017", "text": "Love this place because of it's history and for what it is. It is a great family owned neighborhood breakfast and lunch restaurant which served very good food at a very fair price. Earl is the owner and a very friendly guy who treats everyone like they are his neighbors. This place isn't excellent because it's gourmet, it's excellent because it's absolutely authentic and what every neighborhood could use.

Only a block from Burlington's wonderful waterfront, Handy's is a hyper-local go-to spot for a diverse clientele, from second and third generation locals to international travel groups, to prominent businesspersons, educators, coaches and athletes. Everyone sits at the horseshoe-shaped counter. It's not only for family, it IS family, now in it's third generation of ownership. No pretentious hipster food or attitudes, just good, solid meals and as friendly a crew as you can imagine. They offer take-out, and feature Boar's Head meats and freshly made corned beef hash. Check in on Yelp and get one of Mom's chocolate chip cookies!Don't know if it's a PokeStop, but it is a pretty well placed Ingress portal."}, {"review_id": "ChISECIYLHxb7swT2Up6UQ", "user_id": "CZrxl2Z9snVuyPDTJbFLBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/8/2017", "text": "Great service!

At this point I had no idea the restaurant was an old-school place with a horseshoe counter. I don't know what I was expecting when I trekked my butt here in 90+ degree weather after finding out there was a hour wait at another breakfast spot but I am happy that happened. It's not a fancy spot but it has solid breakfast for prices unheard of at this day and age. Plus, the owner (Earl) and his staff (possibly his children?) were just sweet and so welcoming. And the corned beef hash... It was real corned beef hash that was really good. I wish I saw the black board special prior to ordering my meal but if I ever get to come back definitely going to get the chuck norris! And if you're wondering what the chuck norris is... Ask before ordering :)"}, {"review_id": "SJTsQTrlkYU8X4Ei8cjtmw", "user_id": "W-8nzvd9WQXoEg4---44Wg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2016", "text": "The wait-staff is super sweet and treats outsiders really well.

We had the pleasure of visiting the beautiful Burlington, VT area for a family wedding and searched for a breakfast venue. Thankfully my favorite app (yes that's right, Yelp!) once again did not disappoint. Yelp highlighted this great throwback style diner and we went with confidence. I am always thrilled when my yelp confidence is not only supported, but in fact surpassed. The food was incredible, the staff were so friendly, and the fellow patrons were great as well. Earl the owne is a Gentleman's Gentleman and we really enjoyed talking to him. Watched his debut on the cooking channel and regret not being there for lunch to try that Macho Man sandwich or the Chuck Norris, but we will certainly be back to do just that. This place is a must try.

The owner is a sweetheart, and he walks around periodically greeting diners and gave us a little more history.
