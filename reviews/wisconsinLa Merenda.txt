It has been on my bucket list for ages and we finally went for a work dinner. Everything was so flavorful and fresh and unique and delicious. I had the sangria and the hype is true... It's amazing. Two glasses gave me a great buzz and it was delicious without being too filling. The four of us had 8 tapas to share plus 3 desserts to share and it was a ton of food but we ate every bite. We started with the goat cheese curds which has the most incredible chorizo sauce, I am salivating just thinking about it. We also had the beef empanadas, which were good but maybe a little dry--the sauce was excellent though. The duck and rabbit gnocchi was a huge portion and delicious. The pork belly crepes were also very good. The butter chicken was alright but not very authentic. I would stick with a real Indian restaurant for that. The Argentinian beef was absolutely phenomenal. Small portion for four people, but the beef was incredibly tender and the mashed plantains were a super unique blend of sweet and savory. The special of the day was pork ragu with polenta and it was soo freaking good. Most of these dishes had me rolling my eyes in pleasure. So much thought and skill went into these creations. It's a perfect night out."}, {"review_id": "ombK_ECW_XBK42QP9Vr0ew", "user_id": "Nrss0KsMwwItRHvP2-aveg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "A restaurant unlike any other in the city. La Merenda has a spectacular menu with food from all over the world (can't find that anywhere else in MKE). Went for a great dinner the other evening and sat down right away because they take reservations! Again, not many places do this anymore I've began to notice. Okay now, lets get to the food.We started with the truffle oil potato skins with parmesan - pretty delish. My dinner companion thought they smelled like a nail salon - but I don't think he knows what truffle oil smells like (haha). Then we moved on to the beef empanadas. GET THEM, I only have good things to say, the taste & beef is amazing. I could go on but I'll leave it at that. Then we had the butter chicken, aka curry chicken, and veal potstickers. Very good. The food is rich so prepare for that.

A very nice portion..  After that, the 'Argentinian Style Beef' which were 2 pieces of grilled tenderloin with a bed of mashed plantains, chimichurri and walnuts (who thinks of this stuff!?!)  Super delicious!!.  We decided to go for one more item so the final item was the 'Veal Knockwurst' which was so tender, it melted in my mouth.  It was served on a bed of the most rich cream based sauce and potato dumplings (which reminded me of gnocchi), spinach, and kale. Did I say rich?  Wow, rich and flavorful.One common theme of the dinner for me was I thought about every bite and savored every single bite.  I was impressed with the presentation and flavor.  It was a nice way to share a meal with a friend, not overeat, and try some different dishes and share our love for food.The service couldn't have been better.  Arrived at 6 on the dot on a Friday night and was able to get a table right away (with a heads-up that we had the table until 7:30).  Our server was friendly and cheery.  The pace the food came out was perfect.I will be back again and bring my wife next time we have an opportunity for dinner in Milwaukee.  There are so many items on the menu that I'd like to try.  The only disappointing things were I didn't order a couple of the items I went in planning on ordering... \"The Tres Leches\" cake and a glass of their sangria.  Next time!"}, {"review_id": "QTt41siGa2tSsmGZIsY4JQ", "user_id": "iwL_Kz0WVgTW4BFMohy80w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/7/2017", "text": "We dined as a party of 4 this past Saturday night. I really enjoyed the experience and can see why this place is always busy. I highly suggest a reservation if you're planning on dining on the weekend. Atmosphere - I have to say, their patio was a huge surprise. It was so spacious and well set up, I love sitting outside in summer, so it was perfect. They also have lounge groupings which is great for a drink before or after dinner.Food - Between the 4 of us, we shared 9 small plates. My favorite being the beef empanadas and the duck ravioli. Both were fantastic and to be completely honest, I could have eaten the plates on my own. We also had a couple curry dishes, a meatball dish, and a salad. Be prepared - it's a tapas place, so you only get a few bites per person on each order. Prices - Everything seemed to be between $8-15, which seems reasonable. We had a lot of food and felt it was of value.Service - Our waiter was really great! Very attentive and helpful with suggestions. I appreciate that when there's so much variety."}, {"review_id": "0ue2LRsHR2QLMjAsjYtGzQ", "user_id": "koK6lietyvfZ17KmrdRTrw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/13/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Pulling up to the place it looked a bit sketchy.

It is one of my favorite restaurants in Milwaukee. I have been here with friends, family and even co-workers. I think it is a special place that is perfect for a nice night out or to hold a special event at. My favorite dishes from La Merenda (that are currently on the menu) are the Goat Quesadillas, the Chipotle Pork Tostada and the Pork Crepes. When I went tonight, I did not order any of the \"field\" options (oops)! That being said, I have had salads in the past and they are good -- Especially if you want to introduce something a little lighter/healthier to your tapas list. I ordered the Veal Potstickers tonight but did not love them -- I would skip them if I were you. They came with rice, thankfully, because the sauce was very salty. Sangria is $6 by the glass and most beers are $5 by the bottle. The cocktails range from $8-$12. If you are getting about 4 tapas, and 3 drinks, your bill will be about $70, which is not bad in my opinion for the excellent quality that La Merenda provides. Also -- If you are not usually full from eating tapas, this place will change your mind! The tapas are delicious and filling."}, {"review_id": "3o9gdPZ_eN0w6nRudDXZGw", "user_id": "HCzw1x7OWNGS_Qxfs5-Y-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "A few people recommended this restaurant to me and I felt I should check it out... it did not disappoint! This is a tapas (small shared plates) type restaurant that has many different types of cuisines and a variety of selection. I came with my boyfriend and we were recommended to get 2-3 plates per person which was spot on. We ordered the beef empanadas, veal potstickers, Korean shrimp, rabbit gnocchi, and the halibut ceviche. I enjoyed that everything was so different from the others that each plate was refreshing and interesting. I would order all but the gnocchi again. Flavors were delicious on the gnocchi but the technique was not there. The pasta itself was dense and not fluffy or pillow-like as gnocchi should be.We will definitely be back to try more!

Next round, we agreed on Butter Chicken, Risotto del Giorno, Vegetable Tart and Argentinian Beef. They arrived two at a time over the next 15 minutes or so which worked for us.  The Butter Chicken which came with a small side of rice was average.  Not great, but not bad.  Just lacked the complex flavors of Indian food that we were expecting.  The Risotto del Giorno was actually gluten-free and made from a squash puree.  It was pretty good!  The vegetable tart was also better than average.  It was small (even for a small plate and given the price), but we enjoyed what we had.  The Argentinian Beef was a toss up.  But for one of our companions, it was a winner.  She orders it every single time she dines at La Merenda and raves about it.  By this point, we were getting a little full, but decided to order the Artisan Cheese.  It was then that we were informed that the fryer was back up.  So, we decided to get the Truffled Potato Skins, too.  The cheese plate was pretty decent.  Three different types of cheese in small wedges/squares were displayed along with a small dish of marinated olives, bread and butter.  The potato skins were more like long potato chips; very thin and crispy.  I personally thought the seasoning was a bit salty, but most others really liked them.  My wife and I were done, but the other two wanted dessert.  A tres leches cake and car bomb cake were ordered.  I couldn't resist sampling both.  The tres leches...wow, more like ocho leches.  It was impossibly moist (yes, I hate that word like most of humanity, but how else to describe this?) and slightly coconut-y.  A bit much for me, but very popular at the table overall.  And the car bomb cake was almost as moist and adequately boozy.  Overall, service was a bit slow/oddly-timed, the fryer foiled our initial plans and, we were straw-shamed, but despite that, what we did have was good and we enjoyed our time.  A closing poll was taken at our table to rank our faves.  Winners as follows:  1)  Mushroom Tostadas, 2) Vegetable Tart/Argentinian Beef (depending on who you asked), 3) Risotto, 4) Potato skins, 5) Butter Chicken.  Cheese plate not ranked as it was sort of a \"extra\" and not considered a primary small plate in our elaborate ranking system."}, {"review_id": "pkqCd17P21lUgKMz5YaQGw", "user_id": "QjCY8PKbqqhseUMWAP-pyg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/8/2017", "text": "When it comes to small plates, Milwaukee has a plethora of amazing options, but La Merenda makes magic when it comes to putting out little bites of heaven.I always appreciate a place with good service and our waiter was perfect.

Everything we tried just got better as the night went on. The specialty drinks, tea, and sangria were all top notch and a great way to start. The artisan cheese selection was outstanding as well as the salads. Every bit of spinach was perfectly dressed and adorned with just the right amount of crunchy things to make eating vegetables a pleasurable experience.

I believe it's one of the few places that serve tapas-style in the greater Milwaukee area, and I admire the local farm-to-table concept that they have.The service was not great; the waitress promptly took our drink order, but it took at least 15 minutes for her to bring our drinks to us and take our food order. In most cases, I wouldn't care very much. But since the dining room is relatively small, we could see all the multiple trips to other tables she took before she stopped by ours once. That, plus it seemed like she was the only one doing anything while at least 3 other waiters/waitresses were just twiddling their thumbs at the register.My wife and I wanted to get a good sampling of the menu so we ordered 5 different plates:1) Pork Belly Crepes - didn't blow us away, but it was sadly the best overall dish that we had2) Duck and Rabbit Gnocchi - The gnocchi itself was well done, but difficult to distinguish between what was duck and what was rabbit. The flavors were pretty good, but it was very salty.....which turned out to be a trending theme for the night.3) Shrimp Bindaeduk - The shrimp component of this dish is served cold, which I was not expecting. I think it would make more sense to serve them hot, but that's just my opinion. The 'salad' of daikon, carrots and pac choy had a nice kick to it. The mung bean cake on the bottom was very salty though. The fry on it was somewhat crispy, but mostly soggy....as if the oil that it was fried in was not hot enough so the oil just soaked into the breading. But again, very salty.4) Pulpo Guisado - The octopus was tender; maybe a little more than it should've been. You really have to dissect the dish to find any chorizo in it. The dish reminded me of a chili more than anything else. I don't know if beans were the best choice for this dish since they have the same consistency as the octopus...just seems very one note. Oh, and this one was incredibly salty.5) Osso Buco - I was really looking forward to this one, but I was so disappointed. It's traditionally served with the bone, but they served it shredded like a pot roast on top of a bed of overcooked risotto that was swimming in stock. We could visibly see an outline of the stock around the risotto. We honestly could not finish it due to how salty it was.I've read a few other reviews on here complaining about how salty the food is, so hopefully those and my own experience are just isolated incidences. I really wanted to like this place but the food spoke for itself. I will not be back and have already not recommended La Merenda to others."}, {"review_id": "03nmg46xTieDre35BMy_GA", "user_id": "6Y5-r1fDVyKE4eUkEVd6WQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2017", "text": "Who knew an international tapas place could be this incredible?
