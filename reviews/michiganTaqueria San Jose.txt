If you like Mexican, but it's really the cheese that you love, don't come here. If you like authentic cuisine, and an authentic atmosphere, this is your place.Have you ever heard that you can tell that a place is a gem, simply by looking at how the menu is displayed? Check.Whenever I visit, the clientele is from numerous races, speaking numerous languages, and I imagine, spending from wallets of varying sizes. To me, restaurants like this are extremely hard to find, and are usually gems. No exception here!Undecided on what to order? I've tried nearly everything, and the barbacoa burrito is probably my favorite."}, {"review_id": "nx3VdKcSGTB7FI1hYJzjMg", "user_id": "Q2jND_XbsTCxhEyZZAwoUw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Food is top notch. Fresh ingredients make for great tasting food.  But customer service leaves a lot to be desired. I asked for two of my tacos ordered without cilantro and onion for my very picky child. They didn't come that way. When I got home, I fixed one of them so she could eat with the rest of us and returned the rest. Instead of taking care of me like I described, I had to prove that it was made incorrectly and only got one taco replaced. I also asked for their awesome roasted jalapenos and got none with my order.Needless to say, I will be less likely to come back now that I was treated without the respect a paying customer deserves. I shouldn't have to prove they messed up the transaction to have my order fixed."}, {"review_id": "a2P2xZ3PzL0bDXNwe_ATFA", "user_id": "2QloYxlC6ppRLTfDM4aMYg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "I've had this place bookmarked forever but never got around to trying it since it's quite far from me. I was in Allegan which is kinda half way between us when I decided to drive further and try taqueria San Jose. It definitely exceeded my expectations. Burrito was loaded with high quality not chewy steak. They don't use rice or beans in their burrito so it's really just steak, lettuce, tomato and onions rolled up. I think their tacos is where it's at and I'll definitely be back to get steak tacos.

Next, you have to make the tough decision on what kind of taco to get, all of which comes with fresh cilantro, lime and 2 tortillas. If you're a carnivore, I recommend the goat which has some amazing flavor but watch out for those bones!On a hot day, there is nothing better than the great selection of Jarritos with everything from tamarind to guava. Or, get some of the rice-a-licious horchata!You can dine inside or out. Both have booths but only inside will you find a television with the latest telenovelas and a poster of Pope Francis.

I don't know whether it's because they are under new management or some other reason, but the service has declined greatly. Calling ahead seems to be a chore for them, the service is much slower than even last year, and the food has become sloppy. They used to take more pride in the preparation of their food and the last few times I've been...it's been rough. Try this place if you haven't yet, it is still good food for the money and the salsa roja is the best.

Understated. Authentic. That's what to look for in a taco. And, you can find that here at Taqueria San Jose. I got my usual \"trio\" of meats... Asada, Pastor and Chorizo... 2 each, one in corn, the other in flour. Flavor, texture, portion was on point. Double corn tortillas, grilled just right to be crispy outside, tender inside. The Asada and Pastor was nice and tender, with the right amount of spice... but the Chorizo... (heavy breathing)... it was a tad more spicy than usual. Don't get me wrong, I love \"spice heat\", just an observation as Chorizo goes... LOL!!All three meats were served with onion and cilantro... what more do you need? Oh, yeah... wedges of lime. Speaking of lime, I think the liquid within the limes evaporated... I squeezed them until they were inside-out, and I maybe got three drops each... Not a deal breaker, it's off-season for citrus fruits (February), so, it's to be expected. It gave me a chuckle...The salsas.... Tomato and Tomatillo... both pureed, to the point of being liquefied. They both had good flavor, the Tomato had some heat to it, and the Tomatillo, the heat snuck up from the back end slowly, then it hits. The Tomatillo could have a little more \"tang\", though... there again, off-season.All-in-all, this is an excellent place to grab some Mexican street food the way they're meant to be. Simple. Understated. Authentic. I bet this place is just hopping in the Summer months...SALUD! ;-)"}, {"review_id": "3wS56Z5AFA-oKt-2V23wKw", "user_id": "gALBwV3FhyNyxJo2H5oe9Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/16/2017", "text": "This place is five stars all the way.

For reasons beyond understanding, this is the highest rated Grand Rapids restaurant on Yelp. It's good, but it's not the greatest thing ever.When you roll up, the building itself looks seriously run-down. With Mexican or BBQ joints, that's often a sign of quality. Don't ask me why. If you eat here, you'll likely sit outside. As we did, we were swarmed by bees. Not the most inviting situation.The tacos themselves are pretty awesome. I had barbacoa, asada (steak) and pollo (chicken). Each was simply adorned with cilantro and onions. I splashed on some salsa from the squeeze bottles and that made each taco pop. Without the salsa, they were mostly kind of dry. Chicken was my favorite.If you're looking for a simple, tasty meal, Taqueria San Jose can hit the spot.
