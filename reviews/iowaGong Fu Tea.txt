The staff seem to be dedicated to their work and have a love of teas. I visited twice so far, once in the middle of winter and once on a bright sunny summer day. It was incredibly busy in the winter and much more calm in the summer. I did not buy any bulk tea because I have way too many right now! The price point is a bit high for me, but the teas are of high quality.Today I tried their \"Cloud Nine\" which was their special iced tea of the day. It was wonderfully refreshing on a hot day. Very subtle green tea flavor with a hint of fruitiness. I was also pleasantly surprised by how affordable a cup was- $2.39 which included tax.I would recommend this spot for any tea lover."}, {"review_id": "_IbBcDqyUoiiUNnFYj1KzA", "user_id": "YkAjcWZSUuO2z9bL4sZv2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "I love their rhubarb tea.  Staff are super knowledgeable and helpful in teaching the correct way to make tea at home.  I love to buy friends and family Christmas gifts here as they offer so many different tea varieties!"}, {"review_id": "kQpN9mQXpWhu1yigB0V6nQ", "user_id": "FMXBbottjIZ5_b783zX1Jg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/14/2016", "text": "Driving from KC to Madison I needed some coffee and pull into downtown Des Moines to find a coffee shop. Seeing the tea sign at Gong Fu, I assumed there would also be coffee - wrong. I know nothing about tea; and I haven't drank it unless I'm poured a cup at a Chinese restaurant. With a few questions from the accommodating lady behind the counter she pushed me in the direction to a few teas that she believed I would enjoy based on my response to her questions. I ordered a blackberry current to go but stayed a while to unwind from the drive and enjoy the space. Gong Fu lady, thank you for educating me and giving me a reference point to continue my tea exploration."}, {"review_id": "kKMNilxI_kPS61OAC6VZ1A", "user_id": "N9S0p95RE0ITKwjEU6QTfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/19/2017", "text": "I've been here maybe three times over the past three years and each time it is sensational.

They have such a wide selection that it can be super hard to choose which kind to get! I don't think I've disliked a single one that I've tried, and the packaging tells you how to brew it just right.

What a beautiful shop! I was so impressed with every detail that went into this tea shop. This could've been an overwhelming experience with the wall of jars and the multiple-page tea menu, but the woman at the counter was so wonderful. She told me where to start, how to read the menu, and directed me to the wall that was lit up with jars of all the best-sellers, labeled and easily accessible, so I could sniff and savor at my leisure.After narrowing it down to two teas to take home with me (the lovely green tea, Cherry Blossom, and the decaf, Zen-like Serenity Now), I ordered a Vanilla Chai to go. I can not express how perfect that Chai was, but let's just say that if I lived in Des Moines, this would be my daily vice. Counting the days 'till my next trip to this blissful spot!"}, {"review_id": "skv9Fbt7mQ2XiJq3Z6vspA", "user_id": "FaWCKiJyBhBEWiT2wB4NQQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/17/2017", "text": "Gong Fu Tea can be intimidating to walk into if you don't know about tea, but the service here is amazing, and with just one visit you'll feel like a tea guru!There are a huge variety of teas to choose from (I love to grab a chai before I go to Raygun, Salon Spa W or East Village Spa).I highly recommend just talking to the staff and perusing the menu.

Someone told me that if I went into Gung Fu Tea and told them my ailment, they could recommend some tea for me that should help. You walk in, and it is very intimidating. There is tea everywhere and all kinds of tea  but then you walk up to the counter, and discover that everyone who works there is super friendly and helpful! I told them I had tonsillitis, and needed some tea to help my ailment. The woman behind the counter recommended a lavendar tea (I believe... This is how little I know about tea) and told me how much to get, gave me directions on how to properly steep it and at what temperature, which I could do at home with things I already had for my first love, coffee. Now, understand, I was a bit skeptical, and I still don't know if it was just getting something warm in my throat or the actual type of tea they recommended, but I drank all the tea they gave me while on my actual medicine regime from the doctor, and while I was drinking that tea, my throat felt a million times better. I would recommend going here if you just love tea, or if you believe some stranger on the Internet and want to help soothe that sore throat of yours."}, {"review_id": "Whs1Tog5EKdHKuE_gZnrdg", "user_id": "AHRrG3T1gJpHvtpZ-K0G_g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/4/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Sometimes a business deserves multiple 5 star reviews- as is the case with Gong Fu Tea. My recent visit to this peaceful tea haven in downtown Des Moines' East Village kicked off with a mini lesson in Japanese teas by the owner, Mike. (Thanks for prepping me for my upcoming trip!) I can't help but keep ordering the 22 oz pot of dragon pearl jasmine tea - it's both flavorful and fragrant. The darling sweetener section offers a cherry on top with crystallized ginger, honey and more. Definitely well worth the visit of you find yourself in Des Moines or nearby."}, {"review_id": "2HI7A2Gaf912bUyJ5LnXow", "user_id": "XBlzUVH8_-agvZyDdI6sbg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2017", "text": "Serenity now herbal tea is the best!!

I still remember seeing Gong Fu Tea downtown and reading about how awesome and unique this place is. I always thought to myself, I have to find some time to come here! Well ladies and gentlemen, finally I was able to find that time to come!You can either choose street parking or park in their private lot just south of the building (It's a small driveway, so once you see the building, keep driving South and turn at the driveway/parking lot connected to the building, NOT the big parking lot). There are limited parking spaces!Once inside you definitely feel like you've entered a unique shop. It almost feels like a miniature tea museum of sorts with tea in glass jars on the wall and various tea pots displayed. There were a few tables in the front for comfortable sitting and drinking tea. If you don't know what you're doing for your first time (like me), approach the counter and let them know it's your first time here and ask how the ordering tea process works for drinking here. You could also ask about the purchasing tea leaves process to-go if that's what you're here for. The staff member was very friendly and helpful right off the bat. She showed,us a small menu/pamphlet that showed prices for different ways the tea could be served (hot, iced, to-go, etc). She also gave us a pamphlet that had ALL the tea they carried and stated a good majority of them can be prepared for enjoyment in-store, the others can only be purchased as a loose leaf. The list was HUGE and there were a paragraph description for each, so I just asked her what is the most popular. She stated it was the Ancient Happiness, she gave me a smell of the loose leaf and it smelled amazing! We went with the hot tea Ancient Happiness for our first time.We were informed there was also additional sitting in the back, we saw it was Japanese style seating (I don't know the proper term) with a few flat tables on an elevated ledge where you remove your shoes and sit next to the table. It was very comfortable! The tea came quick and the staff member did a great job serving, the whole process is very quiet, relaxing, and smoothing. The tea tasted great! There was a sweet light peach flavor that I really enjoyed, I am not really a tea drinker, but I had a good experience. We took this time to read more about the various teas they had and now I want to come back and try all their different teas! Also, the prices? Yeah it's far cheaper than anything you'll get at Starbucks that's for sure, great prices! They unfortunately do not serve food, they have a few bags of snacks for sale, but it's just like nuts/dry food. The atmosphere, the tea, the staff, the prices; all these are reasons for you to come and see what they offer!"}, {"review_id": "XCEZxuXVf6al__GCGETMxg", "user_id": "WDhKReZ8YEhDKHiu0bS7WQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/15/2015", "text": "I remember when this place opened, and sadly shortly after that we had to move out of Des Moines. I've been to several states and this place is by far the cheapest, friendliest, and best selection of teas I have found. (unless you're talking about say teavanna but ugh). The quality is top notch and I make a point to stop by when I can. I recommend lapsang souchong for an interesting tea experience or cream assam for something more relaxed. The serenity now is great for those who can't handle caffine. Heck even just going here for the free smells makes it worth it. Oh and make sure you try the snacks they sell also.
