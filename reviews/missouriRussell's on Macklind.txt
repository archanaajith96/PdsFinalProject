Their burger was cooked to perfection. Plenty of restaurants overcook their steaks but not here! Their burgur also came with their house made ketcup which was made with fresh tamatos. The chease spread was so buttery was a nice replacement of chease slice. The burger also came with sides at your choice. We got brussel sprouts which was cooked well with a hint of vineger. I also loved their cakes. Their chocolate cakes were my favorite. Lemon cake was a bit sweet for my taste. They don't have a coffee menu but they can pretty much make anything I ordered and free refill for drip coffee.They have plenty of seatings if you arrive before 6:30 even on Saturday nights. They also have a 2nd floor, a patio and outside seatings. The ambient is classy but not dressy so you can feel comfortable to just grab a coffee and eat desserts at their bar/coffee table. I've def studied here during dinner time lol.Their staffs are always friendly and attentive. The only complaint I have is their shrimp and grits were too saucy which overwhelmed the taste of the dish. But I also loved that they used entire prawns (my came with roes which was a nice surprise).Can't wait to try more on the menu!"}, {"review_id": "nVuv94yrb1RwGgbQDCGDqA", "user_id": "B_FDrkQPfB_s6J7OjYFuQw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Bakery is just so-so.There was too much butter icing on the cupcake we got.Piccoines Id day is better."}, {"review_id": "DguI-DTqz0PS2nHWS_cXvg", "user_id": "gKtvHR-y1tRr94Bm3TpRbA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Russell's is a great local eatery in a great neighborhood in STL. Strong dining options whether you go for brunch or dinner. During the warmer seasons you can also dine outside on the patio. I enjoy going to Russell's because you can always find something new and exciting on their menu, which is great because I sometimes get stuck in the rut of always going with my \"go-to\" dish at restaurants.  I will mention two great choices I've had here - the burger and the cinnamon roll. The burger is one of the more underrated in stl and the cinnamon roll is insanely massive, but also insanely tasty!  It's plenty for a party of 4 to share. Russell's has a few other locations now in the area, but I haven't tried those out, but I'm sure they are solid. If you're in the south city area, Russell's is a great choice!"}, {"review_id": "I8AbLIpLQJoKXzexxgRm5A", "user_id": "hx4_GngWpI4n5_wQx7tmfA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Came in on a last minute choice on a Saturday morning 8am after leaving GF house after she left for some work travel. I was starved and needed good food quick. Being just a couple miles from my apartment this worked out well. It opened right as I got parked so I got seated fast.I had been here before to get some take out backed goods and they were amazing so the menu had to be great too I figure.....it was!I got the BLAT sando on the breakfast menu as the waiter said it was big and filling. It was!The picture does half the justice to how good this thing is. The bacon is outstanding, thick, crisp and delicious. The toast they use is perfect and the combo of items are fresh, tasty and work well together. The fruit cup is also a nice sweet addition to the meal. The service is kind and friendly, the coffee is good and the venue is cozy and welcoming. My kind of breakfast spot for that last minute weekend breakfast craving. Very affordable as well. I'll be back here for sure."}, {"review_id": "NezTeeV8r0p5jzunIewInw", "user_id": "n7Rr7pkdtj1GXBb4Kdp2sQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/20/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I decided on Russels because its between wirk and home. I wanted something light so I ordered the caesar but asked for grilled shrimp on it. When it arrived there were 5 shrimp, heads and shells on cooked in butter. I had to use my hands to peel and dehead each one and only had my lap napkin. The server came over and asked if I needed anything and I said I needed napkins. She brought me several and I still had to go wash my hands before eating. It seems strange to me to cook shrimp in oil or butter with the shell on. It's so messy and mind of ugly with the little legs on. If you are going to do this, let customers know they will be getting very messy."}, {"review_id": "8-Koz_2qHBfgUJOZXf1OlQ", "user_id": "-dgC1iRp_JqBTmn5d1wRhg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "Russell's is a great little cafe in the heart of the Macklind restaurant district. In warmer weather they have a fantastic patio which makes it friendly for locals walking their dogs in the area. I used to go quite often when I lived in the neighborhood but this is the first trip I've made in the past year. Their menu was smaller than what they had in the past but no less delicious. I had the turkey sandwich which is paired with local Billy Goat chips (my fav!). My mom had a pick two option with a colorful salad with fruit and the daily chicken pot pie soup option. They are also known for their incredible dessert selection. However for a neighborhood cafe I find it kind of pricey if you get a sandwich, drink, and dessert. It's totally worth it though. I really like coming here for brunch on the weekends but make sure you have some time it's a pretty popular place."}, {"review_id": "Kk3bGVBDgzgNFJQj2_GwbA", "user_id": "zkQi7B9b-yFbF8k2XSnDHQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/29/2017", "text": "I lived in STL for 5 years and never went here and now I'm very very upset!  This is hands down the best brunch in STL and maybe I have ever had in my life!  From the decorating to the ambiance it is amazing inside and out.  Went to brunch yesterday and was seated immediately which was great.  The table was wobbly and they fixed that super quick.  We had a really great waitress and she was nice and great the entire time.  We ordered lattes and a cinnamon bun with nuts!  OMG do the put crack in the cinnamon bun it was so good!  The server mentioned the special hash of the day and we were both sold!  It had sweet potatoes, Brussel sprouts, onions, mushrooms, cheese and a egg on top!  It was crazy good!  The only down part was they forgot our lattes but after we said something twice the manager brought them out to us and removed them from our bill, so nice!  I am sad this was my first and last time since I live in Florida now.  But I hands down recommend this place as I said I think it's the best I've ever had!!!"}, {"review_id": "69hkRMPI8n7t4Wv61_XvBA", "user_id": "iD0WHyQJQN_ZQASubkLHWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "My boyfriend, Steve brought me here for a romantic dinner and it was perfect. The atmosphere of the place reminds me of being in a cozy cabin. Flowers and candles were on the table. I've been to the Fenton location a couple times and it's nice how they can change the mood of the place so easily.  I ordered a cosmo to start and it was just the right mix, some places are way too heavy on the vodka and it ends up tasting like rubbing alcohol. Steve ordered one of their special drinks, Cranberry Smash. It's bourbon soaked cranberries with vodka and orange bitters, it was such a great winter drink, warming and tasteful that I had to order one for myself too.I like how they rotate their menu for the seasons as well so you can come multiple times and try new dishes. We had the Winter menu and I ordered the lamb shank, which was tender and juicy. The shank had so much meat on it I had another meal for the following day. He ordered the bacon wrapped meatloaf, from previous pictures it looks like this entree is offered throughout the year and if you order you'll know why! I have never actually ordered meatloaf in a restaurant but I tried Steve's and it was amazing! I'm thinking all meatloaves should be wrapped in bacon!Overall, I liked this place a lot and I hope I get the opportunity to come back and try their other seasonal menu items."}, {"review_id": "kyK7je0n8OdQat_jt_DoQA", "user_id": "rx1PCLQEbWp-sxBWB6OKsQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Went to Russell's for lunch and brunch.

Wow I feel dumb for missing out! The food was all just fantastic. Worth making special mention of was the meatloaf that my husband ate while making \"delicious sounds\", and he probably told me 20 times how good it was. Also the gnudi that was offered without the meat, plus wild mushrooms. I thought the offer of a vegetarian modification without even asking for it was smart. So the food was great....and the service?Our server Clint was AMAZING. So friendly and warm, we'd go back just because of him. and that delicious damned food, but anyway. So we get up at some point, between courses, to go stalk the cakes, and the guy back there ALSO AMAZING. and he was waiting tables too. Where do they get these people?So for those unfamiliar, Russell's basically has a full pastry shop in the back. At least a dozen cakes, including several cheesecakes and both regular and gluten free carrot cake, and about a dozen or more other cookies, bars, tarts and gooey butter choices. It all came together to be an EXPERIENCE rather than just a meal out. Lovely atmosphere, great food, exceptional service, and the best date ever(date not included) Can't wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "4kWoUkYTZKB4N7gI2UDqCw", "user_id": "C3Hpsx_eDfeSmxEc1HBzpA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/15/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I know it hasn't been very long for an update, but it has since visits. And today's Sunday brunch was fantastic. We got the Cinnamon Roll which I promised I'd go back for and I got the flatbread which they were out of last time. The cinnamon roll was everything I'd imagined it be an more. They added optional nuts, had a decadent cream cheese icing, and it was big enough to share between four people. The breakfast flatbread was phenom as well. Thick bacon, fried egg, balsamic salad, tomato and cheese. It was cooked all the way through and packed with flavor. Seriously fantastic. Also tried a new hash....A++. And yes, I'll probably replicate it at home again.

Perhaps it's the home-like feeling of eating at Russell's, but it truly feels like you're eating a meal at your dining table with your friends...in the middle of a restaurant.For lunch, I don't know that you'll find a better deal for incredible food in St Louis. The half salad (which is more like a whole salad) and half sandwich combo allows for trying a bit of everything (favorite combo: Farmers Salad/Monterey Turkey Sandwich). Their brunch drinks are delicious as well - great Bloody Mary!For dinner...get the grilled bread to start. It sounds so simple, but the grilled bread is (arguably) life changing.  The Butter Head salad is a great meal if you've filled up on grilled bread/don't want a large entree. But the large plates are where Russell's shines. Bacon-wrapped meatloaf is a favorite of ours, as is the roast chicken (although especially when the roast chicken is replaced by their fried chicken!). The Banh Mi is spicy and tasty, but don't expect a traditional Banh Mi.Make sure to save room for dessert, and explore the bakery counter - you cannot go wrong no matter what you order."}, {"review_id": "qMh7PqbhAlw6lkt6J7EwxQ", "user_id": "vaxt3aJ9U5WdgEo1PNgn_g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "I really, really want to give this place 5 stars, but the service is sssoooo slow.

I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu. One thing we really love is that you can pick two half sandwiches, from the breakfast or lunch side of the menu. I always have a tough time deciding between the two, so it's perfect for me! Our most recent experience was much like a roller coaster. When we got there Sunday around 12:30, we were bummed to find they were only serving their brunch menu. It has much of the same stuff, but you can't combine stuff like the usual menu. I also think the prices are a little jacked up from the usual prices. Brunch is a hot commodity after all! After getting past the disappointment of this (I had already made up my mind beforehand what I planned to order), I settled on the B.L.A.T.E. (Bacon, lettuce, avocado, tomato, and egg on wheat). It didn't disappoint! The fruit is always fresh, as are the rest of the ingredients. Bf had the club and mentioned how great their carved turkey is. Since they were pretty packed, the food took a bit to come out, not too bad though. I guess we looked pretty hungry, because our server brought us some sort of pastry, mentioning that he saw us looking around and maybe this could hold us over till our food came out, which was soon after. We were delighted, as we wouldn't normally order something like that, but it was amazing! The main reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because we had to wait a looooong time to get our check. We had to ask several times. I think what happened is they cleared out the rush and we're focused on getting things cleaned up and such, so he just simply got busy. The table next to us ended up in the same boat, waiting for their check. From all my past experiences (in the industry, too) I would say, don't ever give great food and service, but then make me wait forever to pay and leave. It leaves a bad taste in your mouth just before I'm deciding how much to tip you. We did tip above and beyond and will most certainly go back."}, {"review_id": "1TWpotDOQ1ARlvFjPnUXCA", "user_id": "HrxEA2Y6lGmTKKNbnb9AQQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/14/2017", "text": "We went here for a date night with some of our friends. I was very pleased with the choice. This split level restaurant has a little bit for everyone. Down stairs has a small bakery area to purchase some sweets. There are also several tables downstairs but up stairs you have a very nice bar and some more seats. With larger portions we decided to split a couple of things between the two of us. We had a order of grilled bread, the small plate special: honey and jalapeño chicken wings, and the gnudi. The food was delicious and me waiting more. I could eat the wings all night. The reason it got a 4 star was the place is really tight and everything was squeezed together.

It's a shame that Russel's is a hit and miss type of place. The food is good, but you have to be lucky with your waiter, some are really good and some others not at all. Other big issue: even if you're using the no wait app, you still wait way too long (an hour for us), their kitchen is often backlogged, and they're out of half their menu at noon or 12:30, on Sunday. Seriously ? It happened so many times, not sure why they don't plan better their food supplies. And to finish, I ordered a breakfast croissant, which was really bad this time. The meat had been substituted and I discovered it when I cut it, the croissant was not even appropriately baked...big fail. The owner removed it from my bill and offered me a pastry, which is nice of him but it clearly didn't make it up for my bad experience here. That's sad, I like the food here but too many things went wrong, several times...And I'm now giving a 5 stars review: I went back to Russel's and had a GREAT experience this time ! This time they had bacon, the sandwiches and pastries were delicious, the service was on point and I also had a hot chocolate with whipped cream, I totally recommend !!New spot for me to try today, I've heard of Russel's so many time, everybody was raving about it so I have to admit I had high expectations. Today was a spring day in STL, so we wanted to wear outside. We got there at noon but had to wait 40 mins for a table. Our server was not that great, pretty slow and barely checking on us. They were out of bacon and offered other options instead (but still, bacon is a must-have item for brunch...). One of their option was a hash special, but turned out they were out of it as well.I tried the vegan baked oatmeal, with tart cherry and coconut milk : I totally recommend, very well baked, full of flavor, yum ! And it comes with a side of fruit. I also ordered the roast beef sandwich and enjoyed it. It came with caramelized onions, cheese. What I really liked is that it wasn't filled with  regular slices of roast beef, you could really tell they roasted it in the oven, and put big chunks of beef inside, delicious ! I didn't get to try the cocktails, my friend has a bloody marry and said it was very spicy. I'd like to go back and try other dishes. I would have gave a 5 but the missing items + the service made me lower the grade. Russel's is a very cute spot in SoHa, and it was packed today but I'd like to go back when it's less busy."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/russells-on-macklind-saint-louis?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
