When I first ate at Jdawgs the bang for your buck ratio was great...I believe it was $2.75  for the same $4 dog today. It's still a good meal but not quite as good of a deal. If you add chips and a drink it's $7, that seems a little steep for a hotdog, even a good one."}, {"review_id": "TBToEWnR_11GjKJUL_i7MA", "user_id": "2uXgAglORO1fB05ez0kflA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/12/2017", "text": "I've eaten so many J Dawgs hot dogs since I came to Utah years ago and I'm still not sick of them. There may have been a short time where they happened to cater every event I was at and I ended up with a full bin of these so I had to pump the brakes for a short span, but come on I feel like anyone would want something else after eating 10+ of these in the space of a few days.They aren't the cheapest hot dogs in the world, but they also taste a lot better than your average pack of 99 cent dogs from the store. You can add whatever condiments they have available, which includes their ever-popular J Dawgs Sauce, ketchup, mayo, mustard, sauerkraut, celery salt, banana peppers, pickle spear, etc.None of their locations I've been to are very big, but I don't think it's a very big deal because you're not here to reserve seats for your birthday dinner.

IT'S A GRILLED HOT DOG! But seriously, a polish dog is a polish dog. Their buns are delicious though and their special sauce could have poems and sonnets written about it. It's good on al it's anything. Other than that it's a hot dog place. They do hot dogs very very well and I have never been dissatisfied. A good slogan for them should be JDawgs you'll be surprised how good a hot dog can be. Also, I've eaten that sauce by itself before.

The menu is easy (either beef or polish.) then you can add a drink or chips. It's that simple. The hot dogs are always cooked to perfection and the special sauce is a must.

I am sad the old shack couldn't hold up to all the hype and success cause it was just another feather in the cap for J and his crew. I'm proud of what this has become, having come from Provo and visiting frequently in the early days; and I tend to take some kind of illegitimate credit for their success haha. Maybe that's a little bit of Provo showing through in me.Unfortunately all the token names for those early goers are in the past, but if I run into someone who wants a 5-0, then I would happily give you a handshake, unless hugs are acceptable.Polish w/ mayo, pickle, special sauce.

I stuck with my snobbish philosophy thinking that it wouldn't be worth the money until one fateful day at a BYU football game all the students were given a J-dawg. I was converted instantly. The meat isn't some grocery store bought cheap scraps that leave you wondering if the hot dog was worth the stomach ulcer you might develop. Instead, Jdawgs is like your dream barbecue, with high quality, real meat cooked to perfection, and you can top it with everything they have to offer, including the to-die-for secret sauce, at no extra cost. To sum it up, would I ask Jdawgs to cater for my wedding? Yes. Yes, of course."}, {"review_id": "nJbYqUbLF_ioLDL7mbYy5g", "user_id": "MzzchtN5bQUXyIk1Pn1Kjw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "Best hot dawgs for sure in Utah.

It is a right of passage for people in Provo. I love a good hot dog, especially with great toppings and J-Dawgs delivers! The Hot Dog is a kirkland brand hot dog, the same you would find at Costco (for about half the price with a drink) but what sets J-Dawgs apart is the toppings, bun, and special sauce! This combination makes a J-Dawg a premium dog! The restaurant itself is oddly designed. Immediately when you walk in you are at the counter, which means that when it's busy, the line can easily go out the door. The price is good for what you get!Food = 5, tastes are on point, toppings are delicious, sauce is out of this world!Atmosphere = 3, restaurant layout is a little crampedPrice = 4, fair price for what you getFAP Score = 4Definitely give it a try!"}, {"review_id": "-DbEzRxfJ7Hd6nGGmluWZA", "user_id": "R7a6TO3G3pgCZVM5B0NZFA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/14/2017", "text": "It's a hot dog (1 star) with a good sauce (3 stars) makes for an average of 2 stars.Really, it's just a hot dog.

So I went in to get a polish dog (had everything but pickles, and spicy mustard & lots of special sauce) I stopped by around 1pm, and of course the restaurant was packed as always, but the line was ok, not so long. Their service was very quick though! I didnt feel like I was waiting in a line. Ok let's talk about the sauce now! The spicy mustard is awesome as always, it gives a little kick to the dawg, and their special sauce is so so appetizing! It literally made my sick stomach feel so much better!!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/j-dawgs-provo?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
