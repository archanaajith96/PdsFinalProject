Great building but I'm not a fan of paying their rent. Waaaaay too expensive. The dough/crust is outstanding. This is real pizza cooked hot and fast as it should be. Just too expensive."}, {"review_id": "KMQSe5cwKRrr9oIyMMFWmQ", "user_id": "qtfCCoQfYgsCTgv2H9lIDw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/4/2017", "text": "Eh this place was just alright. Not awful but not something I would go out of my way for in the future. We ordered the wings and they had good flavor, but were not crispy and actually were a little soggy. It was pretty obvious they were pre-cooked then cooked again and sauces up for serving. Flavor was still good though. The ranch that comes with the wings- amazing!! I ate more of the ranch than I did of the wings. The pizza was ok- we did a split to be able to try two different kinds which was a really nice option for them to have. We tried the Thai pizza which was not really Thai. The Rail in Rogers or Mellow Mushroom has better Thai pizza. This one had a more subtle peanut sauce flavor and it wasn't consistent. One bite was strong flavor and the next had nothing. I probably wouldn't get this one again. Oh and it was veggie, so didn't even include chicken or a protein. The other half of the pizza we got was the curly- basically mushrooms and cheese. It was lacking flavor overall, the only thing that you could really taste was an overwhelming amount of Parmesan cheese. Would not recommend this one."}, {"review_id": "CIQT0E2P2EX-bESLhNKFzw", "user_id": "AsUh-UQlJbZGInsV01CflA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2017", "text": "Great selection of beer and offer flights. Huge perk for me since I'm so indecisive. Started with Caesar salad. I would not even call it that as it's nothing like a Caesar salad but it's delicious. It has a kick and a tang. For sure shareable if you are getting pizza too. The Bloomington was incredible. Sausage was crumbled. Very little if any fennel which is good for me. Rosemary was very faint, such a strong herb so they did good. The sweetness of the marmalade balanced it well. We also had cheese and pineapple. It was a little flat on flavor but fresh. I am not sure if the pineapple was canned or fresh. I was too hungry and can't recall. Service wasn't as  great as the food. Server seemed frazzled. I understand bad nights but no one seemed to be helping him through it. Hoping it was just a bad night."}, {"review_id": "H7PWIK_UbuwnHVFlTQBqRQ", "user_id": "1WrXmFKXCI2IJ0pnKAjHdg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "I'm not a big pizza fan , just don't care for red sauce , pepperoni , etc .., this place had alott to offer , specialty drinks great appetizers big bright and clean, close to my house good meeting place"}, {"review_id": "UHt6f-agnykWbE06y7KkaQ", "user_id": "WZZZsGdz7ZcJPjPySdDPlw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "A bit pricey.

The crust on their pizzas are good, fresh, and light -- what you'd expect for a craft pizza joint. We got the three little pigs pizza with bacon, ham, and pork. We felt like it was missing just a little something and sprinkled Parmesan, that I normally don't do on pizzas, did the trick. Love the locally sourced ingredients!We had the kale artichoke dip for appetizer which was tasty. The dip was a little runny but a good flavor. Plenty of buttered, grilled bread to accompany which is nice.The wedge salad was great! The bleu cheese dressing wasn't too sharp, the apples added just the right amount of sweet, and the walnuts added a nice variety of texture.We'll go back again, but living in Springdale/Cave Springs, I don't think we'll make very many special trips just to eat here."}, {"review_id": "f4selZzLgPhQ7U_n-fLT6Q", "user_id": "IzSmK-X9II9HXfARHFlJNw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "This place was a blast for my birthday.

Nothing to write home about. They're obviously a pizza place, but their pizzas are just okay. They lack real flavor and are mediocre - but are always consistent, which is a good thing. I will say their salads are fairly tasty though. The lettuce has always been very fresh and crunchy. The salad dressings are good too - but I do find it very weird that they up charge somewhere around $2 for a tiny cup of ranch dressing... really? I've never seen or heard of any restaurant up charging for a tiny cup of dressing. Also, the service has always been fairly good. A little slow at times, but still friendly staff - which makes a big difference."}, {"review_id": "xDty75IatJFB_0OXUSutZg", "user_id": "VHaUQSMvMOZiBXKlSewGgg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "Visiting from Chicago, pizza is tough to compete with, but this was excellent!

We both were highly disappointed. We both ordered drinks, her Moscow mule was subpar, lacking flavor and was flat tasting. Secondly, here pizza came out first and out of respect, she didn't want to eat until mine got to the table. 10 minutes later, my pizza arrives. 10 minutes. The excuse i got was \"we are slammed back there. I understand 100%, however, i would expect them to be served at the same time. By this time her pizza was cold and also lacking flavor. My pizza was average, nothing to boast about. I don't know if it was an off night, but i remember leaving last time extremely satisfied.

I love wood fired pizza.  I ordered the three little pigs pizza and it's basically a pizza for one person.  The pizza comes a nice crust that has a hint of chewy to it but also has that nice wood fired char as well.  I can't remember what the toppings were but the flavor combo was nice and balanced.  It was a pizza I would definitely come back again for.  The pizza cost $10 and I I ate all of it and probably could have eaten more comfortably so for big eaters it may not be enough but I didn't order any sides because that is extra.  It also seemed like drinks (soda) was a little pricey there as well.  Our server did a good job and there were no problems.  Overall, it's a good pizza place.  I just wished the pizza was bigger because I didn't leave hungry but I sure didn't leave full either."}, {"review_id": "-W_dFbyx-trmkAbxilL_aQ", "user_id": "6iSZU4toOMl9Va7TogEy5A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "Very quick service amazing food we got the Meatball Polenta app with one pizza my side and my husbands side!
