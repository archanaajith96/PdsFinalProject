This place was perfect for a little mid week pick me up. The Jojo with seasoned fries, provolone, and cheese wiz, was one of the best sandwiches I had in a long time, and then dipping the curly fries into my side avocado ranch sent me into fat boy heaven.  This place is it! Somebody needs to call Guy Fieri and let him know about this place. Service was great, they checked on my friend and I frequently throughout our meal and were very nice, which I appreciate. They do have irregular hours so it may be hard to get here if you work during the week, but when I get a chance, I cannot wait to dine here again."}, {"review_id": "SRLxlZSozDoAozWAjGzZTQ", "user_id": "mGRr4CfnlavBOqzlwkjWOA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "I was having my car serviced and asked where to get some food. The techs told me there was a chain sandwich place down the street. Just a few doors down from said chain in the same complex I found this place. I went in here and am extremely glad I did.A long counter runs down the center, with the kitchen on one side and a thin row of booths on the other. I sat at the counter. The staff works quickly and smoothly behind the counter and were super friendly. It is really fun to watch good short order cooks operate.The fries are nothing special, but the bacon cheese burger was very good. At a price point almost exactly that of Five Guys, this place is a substantial upgrade. My biggest quibble was that extra burger toppings cost more, but that is by no means unreasonable. The cheese steaks and chicken cheese steaks looked and smelled outstanding and I intend to go back to try them soon. If you are looking for a good lunch spot that feels cozy, has solid food, and nice folks, try this place![As a note, I can't believe the people at the Car Dealerships didn't know about this place. If I were the owners of this place I would exploit that proximity to a captive and bored audience of people waiting for their cars to be serviced.]"}, {"review_id": "7Tnau7rjV1m73BQ-VlSL8A", "user_id": "_sDLWa-TlAdE3s6ZiTsV-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "I had a chicken cheesesteak made with my choice of sauces and toppings and cheese. I don't like boring or basic recipes that I think I can make at home, and their menu is practical and a little unassuming. But my sandwich tasted great! I mixed their signature house sauce with the avocado ranch, and I kept it simple with onions and peppers. I'm still trying to figure out the seasonings, in the house sauce and on the chicken they cooked, that made such a simple recipe taste so good!The guy at the counter let me try their cheese wiz which was actually much better tasting than what I'm used to. I have a habit of hating on cheese wiz for being gross and fake, but apparently theirs is an actual cheese sauce and not the typical fake spread. So next time I go back I'm gettin \"The Famous Jojo\" that seems to be the most unique item on the menu. Staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient so I can't see any reason to not go there when craving a proper hot cheesy meaty saucy meal!"}, {"review_id": "3TSmLLAwebSgN4h6uDPtKg", "user_id": "4pAKe2UGh3A3-gtSJC1-nw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/22/2017", "text": "I love this small hole in the wall restaurant!! It's a great place to satisfy your Cheesesteak cravings. Every time I've been here, it's been nothing but delicious! The service is welcoming and very quick, even when they are very busy. The menu is very simple, but with plenty of customizations. Honestly, I've tried several different things and you can't go wrong with whatever you choose. I highly recommend the classic Cheesesteak or the Jojo! The portions are filling and their sandwiches are sooo juicy. Their ingredients are fresh and the sauces are homemade. I do wish they were open later than 4:30, but don't let that stop you from paying them a visit. This is my go to lunch spot for a great Philly Cheesesteak! Wayyy better than those tourist trap Cheesesteak places I had while in Philly (yes, I'm talking about Pat's and Geno's)."}, {"review_id": "N1Gz-IcqSJP4HUzZYPzWig", "user_id": "uUAcSRcTgAA1yY_0Zh2Mog", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "This place pretty chill & in the cut, stumbled across this place by a good friend who suggested this was the place to go.

This is a \"straight to the point\" kind of establishment. Their menu speaks for itself and I love that it's basic with not a whole lot going on. Whatever you choose - chicken or steak -  it will taste absolutely delicious. Their fries are fried perfectly, too. Crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. Everything is made to order so you're always going to get hot food, and trust me, I'm still recovering from a burnt tongue and the roof of my mouth as well. I mean, when you're excited about good food you just dive right in!! The best part here is that their prices are super reasonable for what you get. Everyone's friendly and they work quickly. Their avocado ranch is the bomb. Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty.

I was pretty hungry and I was on this side of town. There were a lot of decisions to be made, where and what would I order. I chose to try out a cheesesteak. Not a bad decision. I order the chicken bacon avacado ranch cheesebasket.  Very flavorful. A little on the salty side. I liked how the avacado ranch sauce added a little change from the norm. Of course I tossed a little ketchup into the fray. All n all a good meal. Word to the wise...if you go with the fry basket, go with the half portion. By the way, YOU WILL NEED A FORK.lol"}, {"review_id": "GjT8oZTCqneyESQlN-dHtg", "user_id": "94WT9o_G39sv-mNoz85V4A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/20/2017", "text": "I'm going to write a review that is against the name of the business.

I've driven down Virginia Beach Blvd. often and it happened to be the perfect day to go. Weekday lunch hour, just enough time for me to try this place out.It's on a side plaza down Virginia beach Blvd in between Witchduck Rd. & Independence Blvd. You really can't miss It.It's a small establishment but inviting. The smell from the grill and the  booths and bar seatings give you the full diner experience. From the looks of lunch hour they had quite a full house. But they weren't too busy to give you top notch quality customer service.From the greetings and the helpful tips I was given from the menu. I'd give them 5 stars all the way. It was a order and run kind of day. So I placed my order and was given a seat at the bar to wait while and sip on my glass of water and peppermint as I waited. The order was fast and quick. Especially when you are bumping into Yelper friends, and conversing, the time goes by so much quicker.  Took my order to go but surprisingly it was still hot and I was happy to see that my cheesesteak was still in tack and not mushy upon diving into it at home.Surprisingly the cheesesteak got demolished. My husband was happy and gave it a 4/5. I think it's really good for Virginia beach. I know I can't compare it to the Philly steaks, I've had when I was living out in New Jersey and Philadelphia. But it made the cut knowing there are not many cheesesteak places in the Hampton roads area, this has to be the go to spot.The steaks were good portioned and diced up with mushrooms and onions. I customized mines and loved eating it with the jalapeño slices I got on the side. The pickled vinegar flavor from the jalapeños complimented the cheesesteak so well. Maybe a little more wiz and jalapeños would've made my lunch even more spectacular.I preferably would like it with thin huge cuts of juicy ribeye \"wit wiz & onions\" (as they say in Philly) but of course there is no comparison to the northeast. I have to give them their stars they deserve for overall flavor and customer service 5/5.From reading other reviews and opinions I would've loved to get the Jojo's but I wasn't down for the huge carb load of fries in my cheesesteak. I'll definitely be back to try it and share with someone to take in the Jojo's.This has to be the go to spot for the cheesesteak lovers, it's the \"closest\" you will get to visiting Philly!"}, {"review_id": "TpEjlLmsMChV0jebVWtnRQ", "user_id": "ca6F6P76PrURxHMFqtouaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "This place is stupid good.  If you are in Norfolk and don't come here you are crazy.The cheesesteaks are one of the best I have tasted, all done with ribeye steak.  You can't miss this place."}, {"review_id": "BcOPSxdAd5BE2NOXTu4Dqg", "user_id": "UtjUNq6ipacK9SlCWnAe7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "I have probably driven by this place a million times over the years and never noticed it!

This is definitely a hidden gem in VA beach. It's a great change from the fancy-ish food offered down the road at town center, and is definitely much more affordable! I ordered a regular Philly cheese steak which came with sautéed veggies, provolone cheese, and meat and it was super delicious. It came out hot and PACKED with meat and veggies. My boyfriend ordered the JoJo which is a Philly steak with French fries on the actual sandwich and it was really tasty as well! I preferred the regular Philly cheesesteak with the fries on the side though. My boyfriend and I also shared a basket of curly fries which were fresh and crunchy! We sampled the house sauce courtesy of our waiter and we loved it so much we ordered two cups of it! It's tangy and sweet all at the same time and I definitely recommend ordering it to pair with fries! This is a fairly small place, so make sure you beat the lunch crowd because they became super busy around 12pm!"}, {"review_id": "3UoAA9WBFkpPzoSQFsfgqA", "user_id": "ahxeAMpwoH6C_TzHHsyB5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "You just can't go wrong with this small eatery. If you want a unreal cheesesteak whether it is steak or chicken you won't go wrong here. The only problem is you waddle out of the place stuffed.
