I was originally worried that it would be too noisy, but on a Sunday night, it was perfection-my B/F asked for the quiet table.He is a professional, ​accomplished chef. He's hard to impress but if we could have eaten the plates, we would have. The Vineyard Chowder was just amazing-the broth was to die for and the Ahi Tuna and Panko Crusted Salmon were exceptional. The Waitstaff​ respected​ us and kept their distance yet provided attention as needed.You get what you pay for and this was well worth every penny."}, {"review_id": "qI93i7XTV_ERoUQM3VUzng", "user_id": "wz_78T_6G9rbl0vWRg7DcA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "The food was really good but the service was really not. We showed up early, waiting for a table, and got drinks. The bartender exploded at us when one person didn't tip well, saying he wouldn't serve the rest of us. Eventually he did, and we sat awkwardly as the staff ignored us until we asked again \"hey is our table ready?\" At which point they immediately sat us.Our waiter started with \"I'm leaving at 10,\" before he took our orders. Overall, we felt ignored and unwelcome.

Wonderful, warm and gracious wait staff. We were lucky to have Killani as our server.  Sure I'm s pop telling his name incorrectly so apologies. Would go back in a heartbeat. The restaurant is in what used to be the lobby of the Hotel Vermont. The architecture, ceilings, floors are gorgeous! Kind  of want to stay and eat everything on the menu. Best cocktail - the Pear Gimlet was perfectly balanced. I had two. It was heaven. We had the seafood stew soup, white bean soup, fresh salad was grilledicious chicken on it. The best I've ever had. The blue cheese dressing was the most flavorful I've ever had. The French fries, the best ever."}, {"review_id": "tq1YKodJK0xNCTnDk-89Hg", "user_id": "FC1ZSB9fd4WlDMSAbEjq8Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "The Gryphon is a solid restaurant with a good selection of local beers, and great food. Vermont is known for their beers, so you should definitely see what is on tap!We started off with the pierogi, which were great for sharing. The waiter said that they were famous for their seafood grits, people would drive for miles just to eat it. . I usually don't like grits, but I decide to give it a try. The grits were ok, I decided I still didn't really like this grain. It was also surrounded by a pool of butter, which was good but a little too much. The grits were topped with seafood such as scallops. I don't know, I wasn't really impressed. I was hoping to love the seafood grits but it just seemed like grits sitting in a pool of butter, which didn't appeal to me.I would like to give this place another chance and try the other dishes."}, {"review_id": "MkAR7asAfwVrDDTCfGJzOA", "user_id": "Z1kYlm0X9lUXpTplc8XnmQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Enjoying a maple old fashioned here and sharing a bowl of \"Vineyard Chowder\" with Lena.

I was extremely hungry and didn't want some terrible college town food (no offense). I walked into this spot and knew I made the right choice. The decor was solid and felt like an traditional American bistro. I ordered a delicious beer, the Left Hand Brewing Co. | Milk Stout Nitro (forgot to snap a picture) and the seafood grits in lobster butter. BRUH! Wow. It wasn't too salty, wasn't a \"gritty\" or super \"bumpy\" grits.The service was really good (the place was practically empty) and attentive. Also, very clean linens and tables.

Tried getting into multiple restaurants but the lines were out the door with over an hour wait times. Came upon Gryphon and was able to walk right in. Gryphon is a really cool restaurant located in downtown Burlington. Nice sized bar and and a decent amount of tables scattered around. Definitely good as a general bar or to dine.The menu has some interesting dishes along with some standard bar/brunch food. I started with the seafood chowder which is filled with a variety of seafood. It was delicious. Tested fresh, good broth and overall well prepared. I then had the tuna sandwich which was topped with aioli on ciabatta bread, and a side of cole slaw. Very tasty. Overall great experience here from and food and service standpoint. Even better that there wasn't a long line. Def a good choice."}, {"review_id": "4L3B-tV_uAVMmHBLc0TTbw", "user_id": "XV-jiJ6yb0LXlh4EyEWbqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2017", "text": "If I could give this place 10 Stars, I would!! Out of all of the restaurants I've visited in Burlington, The Gryphon has by far been my FAVORITE experience!I stopped by for brunch this Sunday afternoon around 11am. The building is a short and enjoyable walk from the Courtyard Marriott/Hotel Vermont. I chose this place because other Yelpers had reported that it was a less-busy location for a very delicious Vermont brunch-- and they were right! There was no wait time (most other places around had at least a 10 minute wait) and I was able to get a comfortable seat at the bar. My bar tender was friendly and helpful and made me one of the best Bloody Mary's I have ever had! The Gryphon's Bloody Mary mix is unlike any other I've had- it was perfectly balanced with flavors and of a thicker consistency. AND it was topped with...wait for it...a FRIED GREEN TOMATO!! Yummmmm!!! I couldn't help but take a bite before I snapped a photo, lol!For brunch, I had the California Benedict (the Bloody Mary and meal were a part of the 2017 Restaurant Week special) and it was DEFINITELY the best meal I have had yet in Vermont!!! Everything was perfect, and no words I could use to describe my food could ever do it true justice. Just check out the photos attached to this review-- they say \"a picture is worth a thousand words\" but that still might not even do the greatness of this meal justice.I finished up with a cup of coffee, served steamy hot and with fresh cream and raw sugar! Great way to end my meal before a day of shopping.If you are in Burlington...come to The Gryphon for brunch. It will likely turn into your go-to spot!!"}, {"review_id": "eq3wdtCVQDoHo7ByMMMZ6w", "user_id": "RreNy--tOmXMl1en0wiBOg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "I really enjoyed this place. We went late afternoon on a Wednesday and it turns out Wednesday's are $5 for all their glasses. Yay!  Service was excellent. The restaurant had a lot of windows and a lot of wood- very nice relaxed atmosphere. French onion soup was very good. I had a grilled vegetable sandwich which was quite tasty. The bread was excellent. My daughter had the grilled chicken on ciabatta and was excellent- chicken was cooked well and it had a lot of avocado in it. Next time I think I will order that.

The bartender whipped up the Bloody Mary's right in front of me and what a joy to watch! Heavy on the horseradish (yes please!) and the Worcestershire, garnished with a cucumber slice and two pickled white asparagus spears, these really hit the spot. And they were huge, no complaints here!For food, I went with the fried green tomato eggs benedict and my brunch companion went with the California eggs bene, both opted for the side of home fries in lieu of side salad. Delicious! Mine was served on a buttermilk biscuit in place of the standard English muffin - so good. The potatoes were extra crispy with some tasty onions mixed in. Prices very reasonable, centrally located, interesting decor. All in all a great spot and worth a visit!"}, {"review_id": "BhXKV9YDzzTXyRLUp5pAkg", "user_id": "0fDLSbaSlkQcNElJ40ecMg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "LOVE IT!  Great location, great food and fun atmosphere!!  One of the best Bloody Mary I've ever had!"}, {"review_id": "aGcLH9LSiSeH3key-ftDvg", "user_id": "A4YezivT1kw2wF0TGJgKlw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/16/2017", "text": "I've been to a lot of places in Burlington but this was a newbie for me. SO GOOD. The prices are high but you can go high-low with starters, mid-size entrees, etc. The seafood chowder and starter sized seafood grits were the stars. The starter had 2 huge scallops and 2 huge shrimp on top! The pierogis and mussels were also amazing. We also got the ahi tuna and asparagus - guess what? Still amazing. Higher priced entrees but starters are big and delicious. I think 2 people I was with got entrees. We were a little annoyed because we checked the dessert menu first and our waiter promised us two pieces of key lime cheesecake. And then they were out. He managed to get us one slice but I hate overly zealous promises and then disappointment. The bread pudding was the best dessert. The chocolate mousse was average and the tiramisu was really runny like pudding. But dessert isn't usually the star and the food was perfection so small complaints are fine.Service was very good and our waiter was super nice. They also had $5 drink specials which were good. I also recommend the pomegranate mojito and their small but strong beer list."}, {"review_id": "HTViucHUt-cmriF21C6ySg", "user_id": "lhrleFTsOw91vEUY1s871A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/10/2017", "text": "Our group was looking for a sit down lunch place and came across this on main street. The ambiance was very comfortable with detailed woodwork, a large bar and high, painted ceilings. Really cool interior. The food was solid but the service was sub-par. My ahi tuna salad was excellent in a light, citrus vinaigrette and roasted fingerlings. The prices were a bit steep for lunch as well. Other favorites were the Grilled Vegetable Panini which had a pesto and the Fried Green Tomato sandwich. Portions were very generous.We were the only people in the restaurant during the 12 o'clock lunch period yet our food, mostly sandwiches, took over an hour to serve.
