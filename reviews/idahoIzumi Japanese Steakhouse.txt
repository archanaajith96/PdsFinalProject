It's always what I want but thats been it so far like I like it because it's good and it's consistant.Not today. Today it was AMAZING. I had the spicy tuna gyoza and it blew my mind! Not just was it amazing but it was all these flavors that i never imagined I would like together just making a magical flavor combination in my mouth.I would always fall back on Izumi because they deliver but guys. NOW I will choose it because they're recepies are so good and original!!Also great prices! Affordable foodthat is totally fair for the quality they offer. Definately an option for all price ranges and tastes!"}, {"review_id": "_tHTb1MolHmKfTWU_T4CXQ", "user_id": "NUBUL9hNYmerOJeeDmT6Sw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "I'm only giving 4 stars because I wish they did gluten free soy sauce at least for my sushi . My 18 month old has a wheat and soy sensitivity so the waiter was very careful and courteous to have his grilled shrimp done in the back kitchen. The service was great. They were a bit behind this Saturday night but the waiter and cook at the Hibachi grill apologized countless times. The cook put on quite the show with fire and Sake shots while making some huge flames table side. I got a Mai Thai cocktail from the bar too and it was amazing. The bartender was super sweet and dressed super cute! She was very friendly and helpful.

To start, we didn't get our drinks until the food we ordered from the hibachi was done being cooked for the entire table. Next, my boyfriend and I ordered the shrimp and scallops to share along with fried rice and grilled veggies, the portions were pathetic... after that we ordered three sushi rolls to share with gluten free soy sauce. Both my boyfriend and I eat gluten free and specifically ordered rolls from the \"raw\" selection... NO tempura was listed in the rolls we ordered. We didn't get the soy sauce for our sushi until we were leaving and didn't receive our rolls until our friends were nearly done eating. When we finally got our rolls, one of them wasn't even the one we ordered and the other two were covered and stuffed with tempura. When the waiter finally came back to check on us, we explained the situation with the rolls and asked if we could have them remade to the three we actually ordered without all the tempura. We didn't get our rolls until everyone had paid and were waiting to leave. The amount of time we waited for our waiter to get back to us each time was appalling. We asked to talk to the manager and again.... we were left waiting for the waiter to get back to us. The manager never came. We left with our rolls to go. The following day we opened our bag to get our rolls and to our dismay.... we had the SAME rolls they originally made!!! One completely wrong, and the other two still covered in tempura. We were duped! We called the restaurant to talk to the manager who skipped out on us the night before and once again the manager wouldn't speak with us and never called us back. I WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK HERE."}, {"review_id": "7Xy7Ov0QuCi63zzxuOadww", "user_id": "p8TKsSah6YZHvNp2bbf0rg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "First time and the service was great day shift was amazing grace show we had an amazing time.

Sushi to die for- I started with blackened tuna which was also perfect. As for the others in my group however they got the wok and said their portions were not what they had hoped for. The filet minion was good but they said they felt like they could have all used more. The man who did our wok was awesome! The staff was pretty helpful however I know it was busy and prom night for some schools but please don't try to push people out by making them feel rushed not okay. I would go back as they did awesome with food preparation I think I would just sit at sushi bar thou! Also at no point did they ask if we wanted more drinks or dessert it was just like ok you are done now leave"}, {"review_id": "zVSYSwHBjIR5BZszmFZ5Cw", "user_id": "Ecct9zohQrsp6ZsT7NbY3Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/15/2017", "text": "-I've been here twice now.

I will remark it's little disconcerting to always see a now hiring sign in the window when you go out to a restaurant (seems like they have a lot of staff turnover both times I've been here they were hiring). On that note, our server was new she was lost most of the time. She definitely could have used more training; I asked about their drinks which ones she could recommend she was kind of thrown off. Seems like as a server you'd know at least 3 or 4 drinks what's in them and why you recommend them. We gave her our orders she actually came back had forgotten what one of our group had ordered. The salad and soup distribution was chaotic she didn't know who and hadn't got their soup/salad. The soup was lukewarm dare I say a little cold. She forgot to tell the hibachi chef a person in our group was allergic to salmon which was important since two people in our group ordered it. I asked for teriyaki sauce by the time I got it my chicken and steak were cold. I ordered the steak and chicken which I found to be a little bland not much flavor their two sauces were definite misses(one of them looked like fry sauce wasn't good at all). The hibachi chef to me wasn't that good compared to others I have seen mainly kept it to his regular routine wasn't very impressive to me seen a lot better. Positive he was very accommodating with the gal who was allergic to salmon and cooked the salmon last to avoid any issues. Our meal just for two was around $50 which is a little pricey as well. As far as a nice evening out for sushi or hibachi maybe they were having an off night I recommend trying other hibachi spots ''tis one one isn't one of the better ones right now in the boise/meridian area."}, {"review_id": "NbDLfPM9SWX4-wT_w3CS4A", "user_id": "59i48dJ1Y-7xhG8d4SuHCg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/11/2017", "text": "We really enjoy this place. Great variety, the food is wonderful, the service can be a little slow. We had a waitress we loved but we haven't seen her for awhile. The other wait staff needs to work on getting to tables faster. Also, the sushi bar can back up if you're in the lunch rush. If it does, expect to spend a lot of time waiting for your sushi and sashimi items.Overall, we enjoy the hibachi and other menu items.

They have a very nice, private event/party room for larger groups that seats up to 40. There were 17 in our group and so we filled roughly half of their private party room. I arrived early to ensure our table would be all set to receive our group and they already had the room completely ready for us! I ordered their Blue Hawaiian cocktail, which was pure blue swirling tropical indulgence. My dining companion and I ordered four different sorts of rolls to share. Their fish is wonderfully fresh and every roll we tried, we enjoyed. The hibachi chefs were entertaining and generous with the sake (for realsies...whoa.)! After our meal, several in our party tried sake bombs and for the under 21 crowd, they offered sprite with apple juice bombs. I thought that was a very sweet offering.The ambiance is top notch. The outside doesn't do much to hint at the sleek, modern interior. The dining area is lovely and the bar is situated as a sort of tempting centerpiece. The service throughout the meal was spot on. Our server was able to keep track of all the orders and separate checks well, which is always nice!Overall, a great meal in a lovely setting.Get to it!"}, {"review_id": "mFIIcgYrwS1y0rsvW0u2zg", "user_id": "4tHFLslToqpWz094XooYqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "Had our company Christmas Party here.  Everyone had a good time and enjoyed the food.  Service was good and the chef's were fun at all the tables.We plan on returning!"}, {"review_id": "K5v8o3VpEXxGVtO1ufU3Sw", "user_id": "JcSa3Dw84jFnOlYGXI_Tgg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/4/2017", "text": "Let me start off by saying, I love the decor and set up of this restaurant.  It is just beautiful.  I have been here a couple of times and really enjoyed both of my experiences.Wait staff were very friendly, attentive and cordial.  We ordered several things including a lunch bento box, sushi, crispy peanut chicken, salad, soup and they were all terrific.  I would say the only thing that could have used some improvement was the fried rice.I am really excited this restaurant has opened up.  I am looking forward to trying other items on the menu as well as their hibachi grill seating.  It seems like a great place to bring a bunch of friends and enjoy a wonderful evening of great food and drinks.  I am a fan!"}, {"review_id": "Aw4CYWZ2WVcpc2r_k7hPRA", "user_id": "L7JiQSCTL2ZeL-Mdf7daLw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2017", "text": "In search of sushi in Meridian on a Sunday afternoon, a coupon brought us in the door. I hadn't heard much about this place, but hey, I'm all about giving everyone a chance, especially when it comes to sushi!The layout is unusual...very broken up. It's kind of nice being in a different area of the restaurant from the teppanyaki grill(s) though...it sounded like a party! Service was good, but a little slow. Our server chose to bus a recently vacated table over taking our initial order, which was a little off-putting, but she was attentive and prompt for the remainder of our visit. I was pleasantly surprised by the sushi - not sure why I was expecting to be disappointed, but I'm glad that theory was debunked! Our favorites ended up being:Crazy Bumblebee (lobster tempura, avocado, asparagus, topped with mango, seaweed salad and sweet chili sauce)Firecracker (spicy tuna, spicy yellowtail, avocado, jalapeno, wrapped in pink soy bean paper, topped with salmon, tuna, mango and spicy mayo)My only criticism - the spicy rolls aren't spicy, and with all inland sushi...the price. That's why we normally go for AYCE sushi (Yo Tomo is the winner there, but they're closed on Sunday.) All in all, it's good food and a convenient location, we'll be back! Will probably take the Montana family to the teppanyaki grill when they come to visit - I think my 5-year old nephew will especially like it!"}, {"review_id": "rD4G5zwZvrktaFq2lKRYZw", "user_id": "319BE6h2fBgfWDfLln8R7Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "We had a great experience at Izumi the food was fresh and delicious and the chef was so much fun I highly recommend eating here!"}, {"review_id": "2vY9uENZ6YEKgyYcQlTYZg", "user_id": "3CwMwbY9UgP-qvTDxNs_0g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "6/22/2016", "text": "Reviewing Izumi brings to mind the parable of the three blind men describing an elephant.  Each with unique perspective having been assigned different parts of the pachyderm to examine. So it is at Izumi depending on whether you go for \"Steakhouse\", Teppanyaki entertainment, enormous cocktail bar or traditional Japanese food including sushi.It also will depend on expectations.  Are you looking for suburban American setting with entertainment of Teppanyaki chefs lighting onion 'volcanos', huge menu and a cavernous bar with exotic cocktails (Scorpion Bowl, anyone?).  This is it.  Do you want understated, serene spaces, clean favors and gracious hospitality typical of family owned Japanese restaurants in Asian neighborhoods in some cities?  Izumi will not be for you.Good enough for sushi that  we wouldn't refuse to  return for that if someone suggested it.   But overall I draw this analogy; if you think Matador Mexican restaurant chain owned Casa de Matador at the Village in Meridian is real Mexican food and a cool space, then you'll probably enjoy Izumi as parallel for Japanese food.  If you're not into the concepts of 'flash means flavor' and  'bigger is better' then Izumi may not be as good a fit for you.  The best values are at lunch.  Save room for the ice cream bombe desserts.A PUZZLEWhy do they call the Teppanyaki flat tops \"hibachi\" here?  Hibachi are open grills, typically gas.  Teppanyanki are metal flat tops from which chefs put on shows of flipping food and turning onions into volcanoes or shooting flames from their hats.  Some enjoy the entertainment schtick. Teppanyaki chefs are showmen.  On entering one is asked \"Hibachi or Dining\" (without explanation of what that means) and those answering \"Hibachi\" are escorted to room with several Teppanyaki top tables.  This is NOT hibachi grill. VIBEOwners, who are Chinese investors not Japanese heritage, have done a respectable job of revamping the dark, cavernous interior  they inherited from a previous chain-restaurant tenant.  But the high ceilings, multiple Spanish style chandeliers and four televisions (two tuned to soccer, two to a cooking show) visible from the dramatic cocktail bar that is center of the space seemed odd.  Music on the sound system during lunch was as if for cocktail time in some other venue.  Like a songstress I didn't recognize singing \"Straighten Up and Fly Right\".  Music I like.  But it didn't fit the time of day or venue. The dark, big cocktail bar dominates the center of the space, the sushi bar to right,  another dining room to left and directly in front of the lounge is the Teppanyaki room.MENUThe multi laminated pages menu is so large they present it in a small binder.  Offerings are largely Japanese with some Chinese and Thai food thrown in and with even a nod to the fact that India is part of the Asian continent with at least one Indian selection.  (I wish Asian food restaurants would choose a lane and stay in it.  It is hard enough to get one specialty right, let alone dabble in others.)  It would be impossible to describe the breadth of offerings.  Look at the menu link on their web site and it still just scratches the surface. FOOD / VALUEAs crust is to pizza, rice is to sushi and the sushi rice here was good. The vegetable and fish ingredients were fresh with bright flavors.  The rolls were artfully filled and shaped then sliced in sizes just right to be one bite.  The gari (pickled ginger) tasted as if house made.Tempura was expertly panko coated, perfectly crispy and served hot.  But disappointing in that every tempura item tasted like every other item in the selection and all tasted bland.Desserts are a series of ice cream bombes, not made in house, or fried bananas or fried ice cream.  A coconut ice cream bombe covered with dark chocolate fed two and was worth every calorie. Lunch for two with dessert and no beverages = $24 before tax.HOSPITALITY / SERVICEThe young man who greeted us was pleasant but aloof.  A hostess / manager ignored us but had an extended discussion in Chinese with the folks at the table beside us.  The young woman who waited on us was very sweet but reserved.  Language barriers may play a role in the latter.ACCESSIBILITYAccessible parking in lot.  Level in the door.  All on one level.  No standard height tables in bar or Teppanyaki room thereby segreating out wheelchair users.  Yes, that is illegal under the 1990 passed civil rights law  ADA.  Standard height seating in and at sushi bar and dining room.  Loo is accessible."}, {"review_id": "oRUWPedUmoeQZy9wP0rJ8w", "user_id": "e_T7ssobPcpAJkwD7GaKdw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/11/2017", "text": "Upon walking in, you have to be impressed with the interior design- there aren't many places like this in Boise. It is dark, sleek and very clean. While it LOOKS nice, the set up just doesn't seem functional for a restaurant.The center of the restaurant is a large square bar (which was completely empty) and then there are three compartmentalized rooms with tables. I found this to be incredibly weird being separated from other diners. The people eating hibachi were separated from other diners and in the regular dining section there are 6 tables squished in a corner. There is another room in the back with tables, I'm assuming it is overflow for busy nights.The table set up is very uncomfortable. I get a Hibachi meal at any Japanese steakhouse I visit and Izumi followed the standard : soup, salad, rice, vegetables and the entrée. Their pricing is about the same as other Japanese steakhouses. Food was good, not spectacular, but good.Overall it is a pretty decent place for the style of food that they serve.
