And we parked practically right outside the front door. The building which was once a church, is now a brewery with heavy wooden doors, a grand stairway entrance up from the sidewalk, and overall wonderful ambiance. In the main section downstairs, pews have given way to picnic style tables, but from upstairs, individual tables overlook the main floor. There is also a private group room in the bell tower, and individual soft chairs off to the sides for sitting comfortably and absorbing the fairly loud atmosphere. Sizeable, very cool chandeliers add to the authenticity. And fortunately, the seventies music reminds you that you're not in a museum. You're here for a beer, and that this is a very real, working brewery!"}, {"review_id": "0qAry3YzSNPUm_5g5EUv1g", "user_id": "fc33Oj3NZjMLHm-0aPlxhA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "I just wasn't impressed with this place. My beer was decent but pricey and my food was subpar and very pricey. I've been to far too many brewpubs like this; paint by numbers food, passable beer, and no... personality. Also, I swear all these brewpubs use the same darn hamburger buns. They look pretty but are almost always dry and detract from the meat, which in this case was pretty good and cooked to order. Final verdict, not worth going out of your way for unless your wealthy Uncle is buying.  P.S. the architecture is cool."}, {"review_id": "6_zoivZpc4M3qMEFFFtIHw", "user_id": "mPMPn-ZMZ1IOX9kYmwkYwg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "When you come here you have to do the beer flight.

From the main space - which uses the best components of an old church, to Nellie's taproom below,  you can't help but fall in love with ornate, yet somehow familiar & comfortable space. The menu hinges on their tri-tip steak - a MUST TRY, while you're at it do yourself a favor and get a flight of their house made beers (The Gavel Banger is my personal favorite). TLDR - Taft's is a Cincinnati Landmark. Get the Tri-tip steak, and you'll leave happy."}, {"review_id": "XohIw3WQU6hLUoPNnXUVTQ", "user_id": "GSMBpnEny1cR12yPIwO0Dg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "This review is just a quick recap from a lunch meeting. To anyone who works from home, coworks, or needs to take a business lunch where people are not on top of you - THIS IS A FANTASTIC SPOT. Who knew Taft's Ale House which is usually shoulder to shoulder on the weekends is such a pleasant lunch experience. They have free WiFi and open at 11:30am. They tables are community seating and they also have smaller window tables available. We opted for an intimate table by the window and ordered a steak salad and the famous tri-tip sliders. I've had the tri-tip multiple times now and it hasn't impressed me. I like mine rare and I like the horseradish to sting my nostrils! If you say it has horseradish on it - I want to be able to taste it. This is pretty nonexistent here the past few times I've ordered it. However it is certainly not bad. Everything is fresh, and the beer is fantastic. Our service was also incredible. The server knew to leave us alone just enough to have our meeting but she kept our teas filled etc. I just love that! When your service is so good you don't even know they are there. Will definitely be coming back here for more lunch meetings!"}, {"review_id": "iVzHMobQikNqr6JS-uC8qQ", "user_id": "1uhs0GAskuqKG-ZOMFOokA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "I've been to Taft's several times and always have a great experience. Their tri-tips is the best around. Lastnight I tried the tacos which is now def one of my fav's! They were on point with flavor. My Dad and fiancé got the Big Billy which was good flavor wise but they both said the bun was less than desirable. Didn't do the meat any justice. And of course we always love the beer here. We got 2 of the tri-tips sliders to start. I forgot to take a pic. They are a little pricey at $3.25 per slider and one of ours was barely a bite as it was the end of the sandwich. My recommendation: order the whole sandwich and cut it up if you want to share as appetizer."}, {"review_id": "AU0pwCpWp-k8TsXwtDtTnQ", "user_id": "WoKCLSctS7G2547xKcED-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "Taft's Ale House far exceeded my expectations despite being recommended by several friends.  As soon as my friend and I walked in to the repurposed church, we were amazed by the interior.  It's a great space for a pub.  And if the space itself wasn't inviting, the food and drinks as well as the service were all heavenly.We walked in intending to only get beers.  But the smell of smoking meat was just too irresistible.  We decided to split an order of the loaded tots and some tri-tip sliders.  Long story short: get the tri-tip.  As far as libations, they had over ten beers on tap.  Between the two of us, I think we tried them all.  I continued to be impressed.I would extend the recommendation to check out Taft's Ale House when in Cincinnati.  And if you're a fan of funny logos and t-shirts, bring some extra cash.  Prices are reasonable but half our bill was t-shirts."}, {"review_id": "9YjCkutbVyQ0K5YPzL6Ygg", "user_id": "9561a10vySwKwXC7eU4QgA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I had the Tri-tip steak sandwich.

I hear it was an old renovated church. The ceilings are crazy high and the space is just overall huge.There are multiple bars. One on the main level, one upstairs, and one in the basement..which is probably my favorite one..very cozy down there. The staff is beyond friendly and very knowledgeable and quick to walk you through their offerings and make suggestions as to what would be best for you. I personally witnessed a lady who I assume was the bar manager (I think I overhead her say that) walk a table through their beer menu offering suggestions and bringing over samples of any one they asked to try. They were obviously very impressed by the level of service she provided..as was I as an observer. So yeah, I would say this is my new favorite bar in OTR. I look forward to going back and possibly eating next time (I heard their food is outstanding)."}, {"review_id": "G_0cqK4_W5cUWEvFloehKA", "user_id": "xslJM55PBheb9Sg4old4oQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Went during the day.

Since it was 10pm I expected to wait 30 min for food, but that wasn't the case. My husband and I split the 8oz tri-tips steak. It came with cornbread, mashed potatoes & gravy, and zucchini and squash. I added a Caesar salad and subbed the dressing for honey-basil vinaigrette. It was plenty of food to share for a late night dinner. The interior of this place is really cool- although super loud. It looks like the building used to be a church.

Seriously, this place is too beautiful and awesome to serve food that's just.... \"Alright\"I ordered the Border - a tri tip sandwich with pepper jack, Chipotle sauce and a few other fixins' - I had hoped since tri-tip was their specialty that it would be awesome. Now, I LOVE tri-tip, and back in Indiana where I hail from it is hard to find. I was definitely excited and I so wanted to love the food. Alas, here I am with 2/3's of my sandwich sitting in my hotel fridge uneaten. It just wasn't great, especially the bread. Now the atmosphere is truly incredible, Taft's must have been a Bank or church in a past life because ceiling just aren't built like that for no reason. I truly felt like I was entering a real fancy pants place, so the lackluster food surprised me.

Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. Service was very quick and spot on. We were informed the wings were voted 5th best in Cincy, so we started out with them while enjoying our pints. The flavor was really good, however, the drummies were cold in parts and the wings were warm. They were fully cooked, so I am guessing the kitchen preps them in advance and reheats to keep ticket times fast. This still didn't prevent us from showing our carnivorous side and smashing them. Next we ordered the salmon sandwich (fresh grilled salmon, lettuce, tomato, tarragon aioli) and the border sandwich (thinly sliced Tri-Tip Steak, melted pepper jack, chipotle sauce). The salmon was cooked perfectly and was fabulous, although I wish it came with more fish. The border sandwich was phenomenal in flavor and cooked perfectly as well. The chipotle sauce was mostly along the bottom of the bun, but I pulled the sandwich apart and evenly spread it to ensure every bite of that sandwich had the deliciousness. A few small tweaks and I'd easily give five stars. I would've given a 4.5 star review if yelp would let me!"}, {"review_id": "lVWkbPgxLq4b3sdDQFrcoQ", "user_id": "C711decAu3EI6ATA_oCuJg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/13/2017", "text": "In town for work for a few days and had the most delicious lunch here today. We happened upon it by chance and so glad we did. It's an old German church redone into a tap house and brewery. The work of restoration was so well done- it's gorgeous. The waiter pointed out that more than half the menu includes steak, so you'd be well advised to order something with it. I had this steak salad. It was gorgeous. It was served on a little round plate which was equal parts adorable and annoying because how do you even start eating this without dropping it all over the table? I asked for an extra plate and that worked out perfectly. We didn't try the beer at lunch (cause you know, work) but we still had a wonderful time.The best surprise: our server came over and said that another family paid for our bill. He said he can't say who it was, but I know for sure it had to be the people we talked to for a while at the table. It was a retired couple, the woman had been a school nurse, and their son who lives in Boston. They now live in Texas but used to live in Cincy and all came back for a family reunion. There's always all this crummy stuff in the news, and I just wanted to write about this happening because it's really incredible: SO many great, wonderful, kind and generous people in our world.
