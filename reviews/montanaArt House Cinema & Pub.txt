The seats might not be the comfiest, and the screen may not be the biggest, but I love everything they have going on here. First, they show independent/non-mainstream movies, a niche sorely needed in \"small town\" Billings. Second, they serve beer and wine along with popcorn and candy. Third, it's all going down in a single room. So, it's you and 50(?) other people sharing the experience together. Feels like you're in a secret together or something. Our first experience here was seeing a movie that was filmed in Montana, as recent transplants to MT we were excited to see our new state on the \"big screen\". The second experience was their first ever showing of Rocky Horror Picture Show. I was nervous about whether the audience would be \"fun\", aka participate, but we were not disappointed! Truly memorable evenings.The whole experience is so comfortable and approachable, yet feels artsy and unique without unnecessary pomp. They are a non-profit currently raising funds to expand into the space behind them so they can become a 2 theater destination, and I am in full support! Check them out!"}, {"review_id": "4KYe8ZS0uVk8hRwJTu9C4Q", "user_id": "G0hp3Elm-pNcb9vfUizdtQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "I'll give this place its due for what they are *trying* to do: show independent movies in a setting that invites conversation and community while offering beverages as well. But there are a few places it misses the mark on delivering what is necessary.First, I'll say I was impressed to see a Christie projector. I half expected a home theater projector. But because of the set-up, the screen is a bit high for a viewing angle - not major for a 90-minute film. Where this p-lace falls short is in the audio presentation. The room is highly reflective: cement floors, drywall, and hard-backed seats. The dialogue was at times unintelligible. They need some basic dampening to take out the reverberating high end - even a homemade Safe & Sound panel on the ceiling would help. But it looks like they care more about image than about acoustics.There should be a way to serve beer during the movie. I get that you don't want people to get up and order, then sit down - blocking the screen in the process - but there are likely creative ways around this. I didn't expect to order one beer 30 minutes before showtime, only to find when the movie started they would stop serving.And please: get rid of the metal popcorn bowls. Not one, but TWO were dropped during our viewing. Chatty audience members are bad enough, but when you are trying *this hard* to concentrate on the hard-to-hear audio, the resounding CLANG of a metal bowl is jarring and darn near heart-attack inducing.I have some other quibbles, but they were likely more to do with the audience we had that evening than the venue itself. With their planned expansion, I would expect some of this to be addressed, but until the audio issues are resolved, I wouldn't be a return customer."}, {"review_id": "ncQIJgIRajfe38CxWo28Ow", "user_id": "2YUPCax5cvLAzrGbpUnuwA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/10/2017", "text": "Completely different movie going experience in Billings.

It's located downtown next to a ton of great local restaurants and the interior is very modern and always clean. Concessions are super cheap as well, to the point where you actually want to buy them. It's also the only theater in Billings that encourages you to drink beer at the movies. Art House brings in independent films that are often films nominated for best picture and various other rewards.

The movies they choose are usually highly reviewed indies that do not make it to the big theaters. The decor is class class class. Looks like the roaring 20's great gatsby feel (Art Deco). The projection could be a bit bigger. No fountain drinks and there are zero cupholders. So you are shit out of luck there. Drink on the ground. Can't buy a beer once the movie starts either so come a few early and enjoy the whole experience. The staff!
