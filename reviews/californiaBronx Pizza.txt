Sure fancy pizzas can be good, but sometimes you just want a simple slice that's amazing without relying on peculiar toppings. Service is quick and friendly. Remember it's CASH ONLY.Pepperoni pepper - Just enough spiciness to make it interestingPepperoni spinach mushroom garlic sauce - Smooth but not overly creamy or denseOverall, the best pizza I've had in SD and all for super cheap.

I've been coming here for years. I've gotten whole pies if the order is for a group, otherwise for me the combo consisting of two pizza slices and a drink hits the spot. My go-to pizzas are the Porko (red sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, meatballs, sausage) and the Bronx Deluxe (red sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage, green peppers, black olives, onions, mushrooms, garlic). The slices are huge so the combo is very filling.I've had real New York pizza at all the suggested places in NYC and this comes very close. I enjoy a thinner type of pizza and the crust is nice and crispy without being too hard. It's a solid New York pie in my opinion.The location itself looks like a converted house with booths and tables spread among different rooms. You may be disappointed if you've come here looking for a clean table to sit at, but I guess that makes the whole experience more authentic huh? They have the pies in the window case but then heat the slices up as you put in your order. Then when it's ready you can listen for your order to be called as they shout over the ZZ Top and Metallica music playing in the background. Note that the 2-slice and drink combo is now $6.50 and they also do a 1-slice combo with a salad and a drink for $7. Whole pizzas are $15 - $21 depending on the one you pick. If you go during peak lunch and dinner times or late at night there is bound to be a line for ordering slices or whole pies so plan accordingly.Be warned that some of the pizzas can be quite greasy and salty. I don't come here expecting health food, but the pool of oil that forms around and on the pizza is a little disappointing. Still it's a splurge I enjoy from time to time.It always cracks me up that there's a Domino's Pizza directly across from this place. I like to park in front of it, wave, and then cross the street for some fabulous pizza."}, {"review_id": "ybPAd_0TfTXgExcvYVTetA", "user_id": "j0Uumqev3_W6kMQmSe6Rmw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Got the Porko pizza ... suppose to have meatballs ?

Oh, and if you arrive short of dough (tee hee, tee hee), you will find a Wells Fargo ATM across the street. Got a pizza craving? Bronx is the spot that hits the spot. And I am not even a huge fan of pizza! The dough is on the thinner side -- no greasy pan pizza here, folks -- and the toppings are real. Bursting with color and flavor. You have the option of choosing slices from the counter. The white pizza and basil-topped pizza -- try those. My favorite is sausage and pepperoni. Also, it somehow takes little time to get your special order ready. Never more than about 15 minutes. Seating is ample. You can't tell from the street, but there is a small front room adjacent to where the magic happens. The middle room is open -- be sure to bring a sweater during the winter months because it gets chilly in there. And  the back room is split into two with one section holding booths and another much smaller section holding 2-3 seats. Great team here. Always cordial and kind. Very helpful if you are having a difficult time choosing from the menu items. Not that there are many options. You get pizza and calzones. That's it.  Bring your appetite and please, please, please sprinkle on some of their garlic seasoning before you bite in."}, {"review_id": "mojSc5JP-8CwlrDqgTRPpw", "user_id": "zvQ7B3KZuFOX7pYLsOxhpA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "I liked it!I heard about Bronx Pizza from my friend Maridel a long time ago. I made my way out to Hillcrest for lunch with my co-worker last week to pick up some pizza.It's only $2.25 for a slice of cheese or $2.75 for one with toppings! Can't beat that! The have a combo for $6.50 that comes with 2 slices and a drink!I got the pepperoni & ricotta and also the pepperoni & sausage. I liked the ricotta one better. * Note to self: I can't finish two slices ha haThe front is kind of tight and crammed, a lot of people ordering. They do have a lot of tables inside. I think you can even order from a window outside. The one thing they can improve on is providing takeout boxes. They give you the to-go pizza on a paper plate in a paper lunch bag. Kinda hard to drive with a pizza not secure. They should invest in those single slice boxes or even just a regular to-go box.Overall, good thin NY pizza! I'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "fTC3wyk17S8K8zyXN409AA", "user_id": "5dkShpB3hmAkvOWMIi-KEw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Great crispy thin crust!!! 2 slice special comes with a drink for $6.95.

My daughter and I have been coming here for at least 10+ years, and I have like almost 10 years before that, solo. She's turned 16 now. Counting pre-Yelp and non check-in visits, probably been here 20+ times. At least a couple dudes that once worked here have made a name for themselves and started their own gig. Do you know who? I can tell you if you really want to know..It's no secret this place has the right stuff, from the crust,sauce,cheese and toppings that are true NY thin crust style. Usually the Whitestone, or the Meatball are my choices but not always. Been known to venture out. One question I have is, why haven't you applied for a beer license yet? Pizza and beer is a beautiful thing and although not totally necessary, too many spots offer this and customers are swayed elsewhere. That being said, there is no shortage of demand ever here. It's working so far, why change a good thing? So I guess not necessary because the pizza is that good. Slices can occasionally be inconsistent on size for some reason. Nothing to raise hell about or knock 'em down though. Still great.

Nothing fancy, just good homemade pizza that has amazing crust. I had the pepperoni, cheese, tomato and basil slices. Large and thin they were the perfect mix. A little greasy for my liking but a little dab and they the pizza is close to perfection. Parking is a pain especially during lunch.

I usually pick two slices of whatever I'm feeling. I recommend the pepperoni spinach ricotta, mushroom cheese, supreme (Bronx deluxe), margherita & the white pizza. They heat the slices for a few minutes and call out your order. There's a good amount of seating but it can sometimes get busy. They have a few tables and booths surrounded by Yankees logos, children's are and reminiscent decor.They are always quick and give quality service. Once I was given an extra slice because they thought the one they gave me was small- whaaat?! Awesome for them to even consider that! Great tasting pizza at a fair price !
