It is an outdoor takeout place but also has some diner seating inside. The outside is a bit of an eyesore so if you're not looking on Yelp it's so easy to miss this awesome establishment.I got three tacos- shrimp, fish, and asada. They were so delicious! The ingredients were fresh and it was made so quickly. The three tacos cost me $7.40. what a deal! My favorite was the shrimp. They were cooked perfectly and were so tender....and trust me, the place did not skimp on the shrimp either! The fish was also so tender and lightly fried. I loved that it was so simple: just the protein and a BUNCH of fresh veggies on top.I had a hard time finding the full menu on my phone so I thought I'd do the yelp community a favor and take pics of it. Hope it helps!"}, {"review_id": "vSvyUy1bEwiIXkBLhPM6TA", "user_id": "fnBjvcuZDFe3RBYQWqDDUQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "This place is great! The food is authentic and solid, the prices are reasonable, and there's plenty of parking. Ordering is a bit tricky, you can order takeout from the window outside or the cash register inside. If you sit down inside you can dine in, I came during lunch and dining in was quite the process. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Albuquerque."}, {"review_id": "K3AUFWOI23O08npoB0uMTw", "user_id": "1iF8AZDqmw6P1uCrkQe94A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "Great great little place. It's not cute, definitely a diner but the food is outstanding. Always get the steak tacos and horchata here. We stopped by the day after to get horchata again, it was so good. They serve you large portions of food with refried beans and rice with all servings. I would always come here for super authentic food. The space is small and the servers move around a lot but get everything done super quick. They also have a clean space and clean restroom. I will be back!"}, {"review_id": "h5meQ8aEFBr63vmJOaeJug", "user_id": "gFh-KwZQ7SwuOKcUVvEW3A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Don't be discouraged by the tiny building.  This place is packed with customers.

Driving up you wouldn't expect much from this little restaurant. Walked in to a packed house but found a seat a few minutes later. Ordered from a friendly waitress and waited for  not very long till the chips and salsa came out. The salsa is not hot but it tastes good. The chips were fresh, as good as great chips come. A man with a guitar walks in and plays music for the customers inside which was pretty cool. The food we ordered is brought to us and the portions are good size. I had the #1 combo we shared red chile fries and my better half had an asada torta. Everything was really good, service food and it was pretty cheap too. I'll be back someday to try something else in the menu."}, {"review_id": "7J9g76hbm307od2Ea1BFLA", "user_id": "4fvHEE5Cs9l1l4fQ-WLGjQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "YUM, why haven't I been here before? I ordered the carne asada and ground beef tacos. They had so much meat and toppings that I had to eat them with a fork and knife! Highly recommend the ground beef tacos. Great flavor and had me wanting more! I've had better carne asada tacos other places. The meat was flavorless. I would definitely try the chicken taco or a torta in the next time I'm in."}, {"review_id": "tiWnul5E955uG08wYe_T-g", "user_id": "kAD-q-0581qw1gPZ4vG-Sw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "I've been wanting to come here for years...but would only remember on Sunday. And they're closed on sundays. So, today was the day!! And honestly my expectations were not met. Dreaming of San Diego tacos!!! Overall the food was ok.

So I was hanging out with some friends in the area and I had a sudden craving for tacos. I ended up finding this place on Yelp. Upon walking in, me and my friends were seated promptly by a nice young waitress. I ordered 3 steak tacos to go, since I was full from the goodies that I had gotten a little bit earlier (that is somewhere in another review) But anyways , the tacos came out not too long later and man oh man I was ready to dig in! I asked for all of the typical Carne Asada toppings, onions, Salsa, lettuce, lime on the side and with a douse of Pico De Gallo. I squeezed the lime juice, poured the salsa on& also added a couple douses of hot sauce. I was all set and ready to go.I took the first bite and my eyes lit up! These tacos were booming with flavor, the meat was cooked to perfection, and the portions were on point. I finished that first taco, and then closed the box. I wanted to savor the rest of the meal for later. The service was great, the food was good, and the atmosphere was very homey/hole in the wall. I will be back if I am ever in the area again and am craving tacos. Cheers to good eats!"}, {"review_id": "yQX_tMMQQi2TdzIGaJ7vhg", "user_id": "bvZ85FpReKm4OxUQRtncnw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Super delicious, super well priced, super friendly staff.

The quesadilla is perfectly cheesy with a buttery crust on the tortilla.  So good that you don't want to order anything but Tortilla & cheese. The chips are fresh and homemade. Get guac! The civiche, the tacos - it is all perfection. The diner-style seats in a small intimate space just add to the feeling that this food is perfection straight from mom's kitchen."}, {"review_id": "Aop7TcvOfikbnzAEBQhpZg", "user_id": "YEB1pj90TVwomI97OBqPKQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Carne adovada plate was delicious, tender chunks of pork (nice cut of meat, no fat or gristle) in a flavorful and not spice sauce.  Husband had the 3 tacos plate with ground beef and fish, he thought it was not great (we are San Diego Fish taco fans), but I thought they were good.  We ate every last morsel of food on our plates and portions are big.  So I think that meant we loved it.  There are real Cokes with sugar in 500ml bottles here.  Excellent.  The drink selection was HUGE, there were so many to choose from some of which I've never seen before, nice job on that.  The service was very kind and helpful.  The ladies seemed genuinely happy to be helping us with our choices."}, {"review_id": "kGXioLVRV5aKYWi19AjC7g", "user_id": "VPDl5lC-TNJCdV5OqM9JdQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/19/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Visited here again with two co-workers.  I was bragging about the tacos, and we came extremely early for lunch.  Like 10 AM early.  One of my co-workers had already eaten a Lotaburger burrito for breakfast, so he was out.  My other co-worker, Amos, loves tacos AND hole in the walls.  He was in heaven.  He ordered three tacos and engulfed them.  I asked how he liked them and he said they were extremely good, just like Mexico.  Needless to say, he will be back.I ordered three tacos this time: carne asada, lengua, and fish.  I must say, the lengua was very moist and soft, but the star was the carne asada.  It was perfectly marinated and those wonderful juices mixed with the lime juice was a wonderful symphony.  The fish taco was okay.  So my number one taco, from both visits was easily the carne asada, followed closely by the lengua.  Don't let eating tongue throw you off, it is delicious!"}, {"review_id": "_yVC2VtBgEjq7iDRlToANQ", "user_id": "_zxnaf2Ee8iRS-EBZFsCHw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "Since moving here a few months ago I've been looking for the \"food scene\". Albuquerque has been slow to reveal its good grub gems. Today my friend and I found a great one. Taqueria Mexico is the perfect mix of atmosphere (its a small joint. We were lucky enough to get seats!) and good food. I had the asada and shrimp tacos as well as a chile relleño. I usually skip on the relleño until the third visit or so because it's such a bellweather dish in my opinion. This place was fantastic. The relleño had some good batter but not all batter. The chile still had texture and just enough cheese. I recommend the red chile to go with. The tacos were fantastic; 6\" white corn tortillas filled with more than they could hold. The waitress talked me into trying the Tamarindo. I resisted cause I don't like sweet drinks. I ended up ordering an XL. I cannot wait to try the whole menu!!!"}, {"review_id": "rpdp8HfoBIO8iPfETwCVDQ", "user_id": "FIJNuZ_37ZcejqMvVmfdBA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "Amazing fish tacos.
