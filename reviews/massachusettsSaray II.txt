The restaurant is bigger and friendlier than it appears; the exterior is nondescript and unassuming. Soothing, pleasing music plays in the background as you dine. Second (and for most of utmost importance), the food: Delicious, super tasty and overall beyond my expectations.Mixed cold appetizer: Wow. This was agreat way to wake up the taste buds - spicy, salty sour, creamy, chunky! It's a good way to start the meal. It arrives with a basket of homemade bread that, on its own, is worth every bite.Lahmajun (hot appetizer) - you get two pieces of this scrumptious dish. Can be described as Turkish \"pizza\" and it arrives with a side of vegetables (romaine lettuce. red onions, tomatoes) to top off. Delicious.Arugula Salad: If you like Arugula, you cannot miss this salad. A small size will easily feed 2-3 people as a starter. It doubled as dessert as well because it has either oranges or apples, and the dressing is zippy and sweet. If this salad is available, I order it. I would drive from CT on a cold, snowy or rainy day for this salad alone.Every entree we've ordered has been spectacular and tasty. Whomever is cooking does it with love and care. You taste it in each bite. The Mixed Meat Grill is an excellent introductory meal at Saray to sample their amazing food.Desserts are ample, but the Baklava - for the uninitiated or experienced Turkish food lover - is unspeakable good, especially with a hot tea.Finally, the service: Professional, friendly and helpful if you're not familiar with Turkish food. The service at Saray is a perfect complement to the food and ambiance. Overall an exquisite experience from beginning to end."}, {"review_id": "SRe21GhcaBnAf22VAtVRNA", "user_id": "sWQn1T3HGzVeXyXk_3z73Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "Super tasty.

Location is alright as it is not really anything. I've been couple of times and the food has been consistently good. Turkish food is meditteranean but there are certain items that not everybody likes, esp lamb which they use a lot and can come across as being gamey. But i've liked their food for the most part and would recommend trying them out if in the area esp if you want to try something different. All of their kebabs (meat chunks ) and koftes (minced meat on skewer) are amazing and have different spices on them with very good portion sizes. I've usually gotten either the Adana or the Kofte kebab, sometimes the Shish as well. Cant say to the dining experience as I've only gotten take out."}, {"review_id": "GDBOLHTh0Zg9A49h9m66oA", "user_id": "E-6wnr6c53ShQikbITDz7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/19/2018", "text": "This place makes the best salmon salad I have ever eaten in my life.

(They do not accept American Express)  The quality makes everything well worth it.  Linen napkins and tablecloths. They have great lunch specials for $9.99 before 3pm. Saray was BYOB but recently obtained a liquor license.The desserts?  I ordered a Kunefe which was a filo dough crunchy, honey laden, stuffed with cheese, pistachio on top type of yumminess.  It was $8.50 and enough for about 6 of us to have as a dessert.  The baklava was tasty, but different.  I believe they use pistachios.My favorite part besides the good company?  The Turkish coffee.  Omg, served in the cutest most fufu-rific metal coffee cup.  A cup so cute that you will want to slip it in your purse to keep!  But you really shouldn't because that is stealing.When drinking the coffee, know when to stop!  Or else you will have a mouth of the muddy grounds down the bottom.  Oh, and if you are a lightweight on strong expresso coffee....you may be up until 3am like me.Loved this place!"}, {"review_id": "s9vO3Ed54qFXhaw5sAKZ7w", "user_id": "qcO4E7uFXakPd24e7Bg8bg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/14/2017", "text": "I'm back on Track!

I have been there a lot of times, just was lazy not to write a review for them earlier. To start with, the interior is well decorated with turkish antiques and beautiful carpets. The staff is very friendly. They give you a turkish bread to start with. (which is delicious and good enough to fill you up). For starters- I have had falafel and lahmachun. Their falafel is very different and I would rate it as average. Lahmachun is really awesome, I have never had anything like that before. Then for entrees, I had their mixed grilled kebab platter (beef, chicken and lamb). The meat is cooked well with fine balance of different spices. However, the best thing to eat their is their kunafe. I haven't met anybody who is not a fan of their kunafe. Please eat their kunafe - you owe this to your taste buds."}, {"review_id": "5mVloRF1Tz4HvlRlqcXTrw", "user_id": "wwqh75gRfQbbUyf1QXT3sg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/18/2016", "text": "This was a great little find.

One I came with my husband who did not love it, and it just wasn't his cup of tea. He ordered a wrap and asked twice for no tomatoes and it still came with tomatoes. So he was disappointed. The bread was good. I really liked the lentil soup, it was just a bit bland, needless to say my husband wasn't a fan. I had the lamb skewer and it was delicious. The rice and bulgar were tasty. He waitress was nice, but they had someone in fixing the lights and she seemed preoccupied but we went for lunch and the place was empty. My husband didn't like his fries he said they were soggy and all his food was bland.
