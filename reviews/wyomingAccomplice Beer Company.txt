Even my kids loved all the items (and they usually stick to mac and cheese and fries at other places).  For such a varied menu, they do an excellent job at all of it.  I highly recommend it if you're visiting a brewery but want more than just beer."}, {"review_id": "8mnh3cHKX0Zh-oxHGCe6ug", "user_id": "M4aWuvARUiqY9AEVHZgmzw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "You know, I can't say how much I want to say good things about the Accomplice.  It has everything that I like.  The atmosphere is nice, the menu has a good amount of interesting food to it.  This location also sits inside the old Union Station, which is an amazing space to be in.We were given a table sign, to indicate who we were to the wait staff, this is where it started to go wrong.  It took forever for our wait staff to find us.  We then or in an order for our food.  We had planned on being out of the restaurant in an hour.  It took almost an hour for our food to find us. Some of the food was hot, some of it was cold. The cold food was disappointing because it had good taste.We may try again, but at this point, it's going to be after we have tried other places within Cheyenne."}, {"review_id": "_8CS9F8jSqu6Hok9t2UWqQ", "user_id": "a80LjOqGFtJTCvbXxNJfbA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "What do I look for in an accomplice: 1) on time, 2) communicative, and 3) has great taste. Sadly, Accomplice Beer Company didn't hit those points. We waited an entire hour for our food to come out. And it's bar style food. It should not take an hour to get chicken tenders. So the wait would have been one thing if we knew what was going on, but we didn't see our server since she took our order, and then someone else brought out the food and they apologized for the wait. It would have been nice if after 30 minutes, our original server had come out to explain what the hang up was. There was zero check-in between ordering our food and receiving the food an hour later. Also, the table next to us received a free item for the long wait. We did not. But they had a couple toddlers in the group, so I understand it was way more of an inconvenience to them than it was for us. I'm glad they were at least acknowledged.And when the food came out, I wasn't impressed with the chicken tenders - crunchy coating was just fried, no salty or spicy or even sweet flavors came through. The accompanying sauce was very tasty though, so that added flavor, but without it, they would have been very bland. The kale salad was delicious. And so were the homemade chips. But a side salad and chips is not worth an hour long wait. The beer wasn't all that wonderful either. I've never had a kriek I didn't like until this one. Also, I haven't jumped on the pour your own beer wagon accompanied by the tracking card. But I can see some folks enjoying the experience."}, {"review_id": "o-_v1rr4TBP3oKg8acTX4Q", "user_id": "WzlVBO3QItl3FlYwbPFdBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "If you like beer, even if you don't this is a must see!!

There are many other breweries but this one is really unique because it lets you pour your own beer.

When I woke up in Denver on the morning of the day we visited here, I had no idea we'd end up in Cheyenne. We came on a whim. After walking around and visiting the nearby park for a while, our stomachs were growling and the need for some craft beer had also arisen. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't surprised to see such an awesome brewery in the middle of nowhere. Where I'm from, near Tampa, FL, there is an abundance of breweries on every major intersection, yet none of them is as good as this was. I love the pour it yourself concept. I opted to do a flight, pouring about 5 different 4 oz samples. It was nice to have the freedom to try even an ounce at a time if I wanted. All the beers are brewed in house. All the beers I tried were excellent. The staff was helpful in explaining the concept. The environment was nice - plenty of big screen TVs, corn hole and the train tracks out back and good music too. Now on to the food, we shared the mild wings and the sliders with kale salad and kettle chips. Holy WOWZA! Those sliders were melty, meaty goodness. The wings were perfectly crisp and spicy. The kale salad was unlike anything I've ever had - fresh and delicious. Even my boyfriend, who is a total unrelenting food critic, said that was some of the best food he'd ever had. That says a lot. If I lived in Cheyenne, I'd legit be here all the time. Accomplice brewing is where it's at!!!"}, {"review_id": "F90Lg8neKYz4OD7vrX27bw", "user_id": "hWDybu_KvYLSdEFzGrniTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/13/2017", "text": "Brilliant system for vending beer here. Very, very clever.Okay, so you start at the hostess stand where she swipes your credit/debit card and you're handed a \"house\" card with a chip in it. When you get to the beer taps, you grab a glass (they have the usual styles and sizes) then put the card next to the dispenser. Pull the tap. And exactly like how it works at the gas pumps, your beer is poured into your glass and you're charged for exactly how much you pump. Brilliant. When you're done, you return the card to the front and check out.Beer is great. They brew it on site and there are 14 different styles in the pumps."}, {"review_id": "2KPlGtWwCTOl7IeM4-P0ng", "user_id": "E_GAXhVA1_lVC2aFpMQElA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "I believe that the brewery here before was named Shadows. I was there several years ago and only thought the beer and food was fair. I saw that the name changed and thinking that maybe that also brought on a management change as well. And since it was a brewery that I haven't tried then Accomplice was on my list to stop at when I was in southern Wyoming a few months ago.I didn't try the food here so I can't comment if it is good or bad or in the middle. The brewery taproom itself though is set up where it is self serve. This is a totally new concept to me since all of the breweries in Colorado, Wyoming, Oregon and Washington state are not set up this way. They do have a bar but customers go to an area and are able to taste their various beers that they have on tap before settling down to a pint or a tray of tasters. It was confusing to me at first but not a bad concept really... it isn't totally foreign to me either since I have heard breweries like this through Steve's adventures down in the Southern United States where many of them were self serve. I do give kudos to the beertender lady to help navigate me through my confusion... very nice and patient. As I often am I was on a mini beer tour and had already been to one and had several others on my list to try before the day was through that I only got one beer here. I got their Sol Dance Wheat beer which wasn't bad. The beer was a definite improvement over the previous brewery that was housed here but it isn't quite the type that gets me excited ( experimental and bready beers are what get me excited).Accomplice Beer Company is located in the Union Station building which is pretty cool to have a craft brewery in and if you like trains then you can look out the windows to the south of the taproom and watch them cruise by."}, {"review_id": "dTbjk-Hjd1Hgzejs55KEjA", "user_id": "N4XCB79iJvRUsQGMDOID4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "People are NoT kidding when they say that the kale salad is delicious!

Very innovative if you ask me. I really think there should be more places like this everywhere. In the perfect world hehe. Their Krimson King amber lager is the best in my book. It is a sneaky one though with 7% ABV. Once again a great place to hang out. Good crowd even when busy. Staff is knowledgeable and always with in ear shot and fast.

Sometimes it's hit or miss on the beer; they're almost always out of what I'd like to try and more often than not the lines taste like they've had other beer run through them. The kale salad is fantastic....if you can order it. The past two times I have been there, I tried to order food but they changed their service so that a waiter is suppose to take your order at your table. One time I waited over two hours and no one came to take my order, offer a water, or see if I needed anything. The next time I didn't wait to see how long it would take, I left to go get food. Both times I was with a group of people or I would have left MUCH sooner. Additionally, the place has gotten dirtier and dirtier over the past few months. When we first moved here it was a fun place to try beer if you could get the taps the work. Now I skip it and head to places that shoot for quality service instead of bells and whistles. Really disappointed that this place has gone so far downhill, it's a great location for a downtown bar and grill."}, {"review_id": "Oub0MgWRXBNBXj4w1onHpw", "user_id": "mnyNLRzQ6pMCwkuWkFFVDg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Not one for beer but their kale salad is amazing!

They have 14 rotating taps full of good beers! You order food at the front & they give you a \"beer card.\" You then can use the card at the automated taps to pour yourself as little or as much beer as you'd like! You are simply charged by the ounce. Your current pour price & running tally are displayed on a screen just about the tap as your fill your glass. Really cool & fun! Check this place out!
