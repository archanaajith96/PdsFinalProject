It's the one restaurant i can not wait to dine at. It was my birthday on my first visit and now I'll find any reason to eat here to celebrate.I personally love the tasting menu! Perfect portions and you get to try a bit of everything. My favorite is probably the coconut dessert! Seriously a must try! Service and ambiance are great, it's a 10 min uber ride from Waikiki. On the 3rd floor of the building in an area I surely wouldn't expect such a great dining experience."}, {"review_id": "Kt2MSAiIScvbSa4xY-jYRA", "user_id": "eIa4QJXp5ZNmuFORnuPvDA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "OVERALL: Very professional service, good seafood, though overall a very heavy meal. We were a group in our late 20's/early 30's and were by far the youngest people there, and the restaurant was basically ready to shut down by 10pm (but we never felt any pressure to leave). RESERVATIONS: Made about a month in advance online for a Saturday night at 8:30pm. Note that we were probably the last table seated, and we were definitely the last customers in the restaurant, something we were very cognizant of (we left around 11pm). This restaurant does mostly seem to serve early diners - not quite like those hipster spots that have a happening bar late into the night. THE SERVICE: Very professional. We didn't say anything to the servers but they comp'ed two of our entrees (the people who ordered I believe the Marlin thought it was dry and neither finished the dish - our server must've overheard us). We also got a two free desserts for my friend's bachelorette. As we were leaving, our server also made a nightclub recommendation (again, must've overheard our conversation about going out afterwards). Valet parking was already shut down, so they actually had our car keys ready for us as we were heading out of the restaurant as well.THE COST: $541.30 total (including tip) for dinner for eight, about $67 total per person.MUST-HAVES: Ho Farm Tomato Salad, Kalbi short ribs.THE FOOD:DRINKS* Mojito ($16) - 3.5 starsDepends on if you like sweeter drinks. I liked this fine, but my friend got this replaced with a red wine because it was too sweet for her.SPECIALS* Seafood Dumplings ($10) - 3.5 starsDumpling skin cooked just right, shrimp filling nice and crunchy. * Manicotti ($32) - 4 starsI tried a bite and the braised short rib was great.* Grilled Nairagi, Striped Marlin ($34) - 2.5 starsTwo people got this and both couldn't finish it, it was so dry. Major props to the restaurant for just comping these without us even asking or complaining to them.APPETIZERS* \"Da Bag\" ($15) - 3 starsKind of a random sampling of things. The clams & spinach were a bit bland, the pork good but strange in a seafood dish. This was definitely all about the show of opening up the foil bag and letting out the steam.SALADS* Sweet Land Farm Goat Cheese, Roasted Beet Salad ($15.75) - 4 starsA nice light dish with perfectly cooked beets. * Ho Farm Tomato Salad ($12) - 4.5 starsThe tomatoes were perfectly ripe and deliciously sweet. One friend didn't love the vinaigrette, which was pretty sharp, but I thought this was also a great light dish to include with such a heavy meal!* Chopped Salad ($14.75) - 3 starsOk, not super interesting. The other salads are better!ENTREES* Shrimp/Clams ($38) - 3.5 starsThis was my entree, this was tasty & quite spicy. The snap peas were almost too crunchy. There was actually a TON of shrimp in this, they definitely don't skimp out on the seafood!* Twice Cooked Short Rib, \"Kalbi\" style ($42) - 4 starsVery delicious, tender meat!DESSERT* \"The Coconut\" - 4 starsBeautiful, tasty, and a nice light dessert to fulfill that sweet tooth!"}, {"review_id": "BwlmaQ3wxVyFEm90ccFVpA", "user_id": "YhdVJpd5z0Bs94vAbxRK8w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Whenever I go any where, I am always on the lookout for culinary experiences. Alan Wong's made it to the top of my list to try based on my research.When I walked into this restaurant and got seated, the service was overall slow and disappointing. Most memorably, my glass of Opus One almost went to another table and few finished plates were left on the table throughout the dinner service.Despite the Opus One hiccup, the team member serving me the wine was very put together, eloquent, and was very knowledgable about the wine she was serving me and articulate about the tasting notes.The food, overall, was a better experience. The flavors were good and worked well in context of the dishes. With that, I was left slightly disappointed with dishes overall, but that may be because I am spoiled with the ingenuity that chef's fuse into their dishes at Michelin rated restaurants in the Metro DC area.If you are looking for safe and well balanced dishes, Alan Wong's is a great place to go. Though this restaurant is among the higher tier contenders as far as fine dining, there are other restaurants out there that out shines Alan Wong's for the price they charge."}, {"review_id": "MRSI0pHtIFgFIbG2kCiMFA", "user_id": "pZsVUkMb4yGMGoTRzNS7Ew", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/13/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Our server and rest of the serve staff was very professional and service was perfect!However that being said the food did not impress me much therefore I am giving it a three star. We tried the tasting menu to taste the hype behind Alan Wong's and the food was not bad but was not great but above average. I am basing my rating purely on taste. The dishes were presented nicely but if you look past the frills and were to eat the food blind folded it would not be memorable. One of the most memorable and unique things other than the wonderfully presented dessert was their spicy miso type sauce placed on the tables. I wanted to try the restaurant that as per our waiter Barack Obama likes to go to when in Hawaii, but for the price point the flavor was lacking. I will still encourage people to try it because my husband who has a blander taste palette enjoyed his meal."}, {"review_id": "PIus61UcmK6zkUyM7hhn-w", "user_id": "RTcuhbxDIWFBUN335JPhsw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "We went her last night for Eater Dinner.  Alan Wong's has been around nearly 25 years now.  We were seated promptly and our waiter came to check on us very quickly.  The dinner here is solid.  For apps we got the ahi lumpia and lobster bique that were specials of the day.  We also got the oyster shooter, seafood cakes, and tomato salad.The ahi lumpia was cooked perfectly.  The fish was not overcooked and the lumpia wrapper was crispy and flakey.  It was a really good flavor and worked well with the homemade chili pepper water that was on all the tables.  The lobster bisque has a really nice, rich, and deep flavor.  It came with two pieces of dumplings.  The dumplings really were not needed.  The soup was outstanding.The tomato salad was really interesting and worked with the li hing dressing.  The tomatoes were very fresh and had great texture.  It paired nice with the li hing flavors.The oyster shooter was nice.  But I had better ones at the local sushi restaurants around Honolulu.I did not like the seafood cakes.  It was served very lukewarm.  The interior of the cake was too cold like it was either sitting too long or it wasn't cooked long enough.  Plus, the flavor was a little bland to me.For entrees we got the ginger crusted onaga, rib steak, and island stew.The onaga was moist and cooked perfectly.  The crunch of the corn offered a nice contrasting texture to the soft and moist fish.  The onaga worked well with the ginger.  It is their most frequently ordered dish and I can see why.The steak was average.  It wasn't too tender and was overcooked.  I ordered it medium rare and most parts were cooked between medium and medium well/.  The flavor was average.  But then again you don't go to Alan Wong's to eat steak.  Then we got the island stew that's a play on beef stew that incorporates poi.  The stew gravy was tasty.  But the braised beef was inconsistent.  Some pieces were tender and other were tough and hard to chew.  Finally we ordered dessert.  We got the coconut and the iced mocha which was a new dessert.  The coconut was outstanding.  The shell of the coconut was chocolate and it was filled with coconut sorbet to give the impressions that the sorbet is the actual flesh of the coconut.  There was fresh fruits surrounding the coconut.  This dessert was very nice.The iced mocha was average.  The chocolate was too earthy tasting for me and there was really no drastic flavor notes among the various flavors.  There were too many one notes of flavor.  Overall this was a nice dinner.  We liked many of the dishes.  The service was great and the ambiance was nice."}, {"review_id": "L8Y48kgj3FG5_E-QN4TDDQ", "user_id": "0--tA2UFw38eGhliSXhkoA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "The food and the service is always nothing less than amazing!!  We always get the Chef's menu.  The chilled tomato soup comes with fried cheese and a grilled cheese sandwich.  This dish is super delicious!  Your tastebuds will be dancing, excited for the next dish.  I don't eat meat so they substituted the pig for a yummy mushroom.  Substitution was not a problem with the main dish either.  The fish was perfect.  The shrimp and lobster lasagna was probably my favorite.  I'm not sure how they got it to stay together until my girl hit it lol.  You must try it!  The ambiance is romantic, lightly dimmed and intimate."}, {"review_id": "-m4Apqrx6aNYMEQdllrksg", "user_id": "vL4pIBCRJyNR153iZEJQgQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "I didn't see a big sign in front of the building but we immediately recognized it when we saw a valet guy.

It tastes like all the other stackable tunas I've had in my life. We initially ordered something else on their \"experimental\" menu, but our server told us to go with this..Regret #2 were the beet salads. We ordered both, one with li hing mui dressing and the other with goat cheese. Tasted like all the other beet salads I've had in my life.

GPS is taking us to Moiliili and not Waikiki?! 3rd floor of an office building and no ocean view? $$$$ dollar signs on Yelp? This better be good.Well, in summary: Dessert was FABULOUS. Dinner was DELICIOUS. Service was just OKAY. Interior was a little CRAMPED. As soon as we were seated for our 8pm reservation on a Monday night, it took about 20 minutes before we were serviced. Our server was a little robotic. Lines were memorized with no personal connection. At one point he asked how our dessert was (in passing) when we were still working on our dinner entree. We just replied \"fine\" and giggled afterward. I get it. Plenty of customers to wait on without a minute to waste. But I couldn't help to notice and compare the service to my favorite Yelp $$$ restaurant in Waikiki.DINNER:The \"Menu Tasting\" Pre-Fixe dinner offering was a really great option, but unfortunately our entire table did not agree on that choice. We ended up ordering some of Alan Wong's specialties which were menu items marked with a pineapple icon.-Chopped Ahi Sashi Avocado Salsa Stack Appetizer: fresh and flavorful ingredients stacked on top of crispy won ton, spicy aioli and a plate smeared with wasabi soy. Excellent!-Twice Cooked Short Rib, Soy Braised and Grilled Kalbi Style: topped off with ginger shrimp and kochu jang sauce, the beef was tender and simply amazing. A little salty after the first rib was devoured, but that just prepped my taste buds for dessert.-Pan Steamed Opakapaka, Short Tail Snapper: served with shrimp pork hash, truffled nage, gingered vegetables, and tapioca pearls. I sampled a bite. Good, but not my favorite. My +1 finished it though. Said it was good but wouldn't order it again. He's usually a meat dish guy, so he followed the fish entree with the short rib portion I could not finish.-Ribeye Steak: garlic crimini mushrooms, cipoliini onions, and veal jus. Need I say more? My son ordered his steak medium rare and wiped the plate clean.BTW, dinner begins with complimentary French dinner rolls with butter aioli. A little on the tough side, so I tore the bread apart with my incisors and my little jaw had a workout. #truestoryMoving on. I'm already drooling. Our DESSERT choices were terrific. Especially, \"The Coconut.\" Calling all coconut / chocolate / fruit lovers....order this dessert! It's the one item I remember the most. Haupia gelato formed into the shape of a coconut and covered with a thin layer of dark chocolate and topped off with macadamia nuts. Ugh. Divine. The fresh fruit and mango sauce were a nice addition and very complimentary.Not sure if I'd return anytime soon, but happy and thankful to have dined here with my family.

The restaurant was on the 3rd floor of a tired commercial building. I felt like I was on my way to a job interview with an insurance company. The place was very Ginza where many restaurants are tucked away in office buildings, hence the legion of Japanese tourists with a yen for hip cuisine in attendance here. With the exception of the worn Bamboo Banquettes and the name, there isn't much Asian anything here. The decor has pendant lights dropping from Home Depot acoustic squares. However, like wine, you don't drink the labels and I don't eat the decor. There were tables, booths, a short bar and a Chef's Counter dishing up the regular menu. On the plus side there was no Hula Show or Don Ho loop to compete with. The Vibe: Who goes there? Does Rick Steves do Hawaii? Is there a Japanese wannabe (or Watanabe) Rick Steves? Expect mostly tourists, some regulars and some soon gonna be regulars after they settle into their new retirement crib. The Staff: It's a cruise ship crew of 30 or 40 roaming around being helpful. Mostly efficient college kids on a gap year. It was either this or teaching surfing at the Royal Hawaiian. Sitting at the Chef's Counter there was absolutely no interaction with any one inches away plating my food. Not a smile, frown, eye roll or nod, except from my companion. (As stated you can have everything on the Chef's Counter at a two top). And I thought the line at Momfuku-ko was distant and disinterested. These guys here set the bar higher for ignoring patrons. The Bar Program: Everything was offered on a Tablet. Not good for someone who needs help plugging in a toaster. I managed and ordered a Cherry Blossom which had Kohana Agricole Rum, House made Grenadine, Yuzu, and Luxardo Cherry Liquor. Alas, It was room temp Lavoris. The Food: There is an ala carte menu or a set piece at $89 per person and $134 if you want wine paired with it. The tasting menu was basically Alan Wong's Greatest Hits. It was like eating a Rhino Records Compilation of the Golden Years. The Soup and Sandwich was a throw back to Leave it to Beaver's after school snack. Gazpacho (nee,Tomato Soup) squirted into a Martini glass topped with a lovely Parmesan Frico bridge supporting a tea sandwich of Foie Gras, Kalua Pig and Mozzarella Cheese. The Beaver and I liked it. A quick Bread service was inserted between courses. This had a mini-Boule and a some Focaccia which were both warm and welcome. The Bread came with a Chili Mustard Aioli which was worth a chin drip and a second dish after I mopped up every drop in the first allotment.  Next, you will get a Lobster/Shrimp Lasagna which is a cylinder of shellfish layered over Spinach and Mushrooms and surrounded by an over cooked lasagna noodle collar and all nestled in the same Tomato Soup (nee, Gazpacho) from above. I know, because I watched them squeeze it from the same bottle. Yes, there was a home run. Taht would be the Ginger Crusted Onaga Long Tail Snapper. (Sounds like a character from the Lord of the Rings). This had a beautiful piece of perfectly prepared fish with fresh Ginger grated on top before touring the inside of the Salamander. Add some crisp Asparagus Spears and dots of Plum Duck Sauce, Gochujang, and a reprise of the Chili Mustard Aioli. There it is...going, going...gone. A homer. Next, out comes the twice cooked soy braised gingered Short Rib with an Eggplant Croquette (of which I wanted a bucket). The Short Rib chunk was delicious, rich and served with the same sauces from the Onaga. Well, no waste here apparently. And in the end there was a Waialua Chocolate Crunch Bar (a glorified Twix) with a Rum Truffle nested in a Macadamia Tuile along with a slish of Bittersweet Chocolate Mousse and two Sweet Potato Cookies as an Amuse-Caboose. Was any of it fabulous? Not too much but preferable to picking at the Pig off paper plates at the Hotel Luau Party.        So, I guess let's say that Alan Wong's belongs on the Hawaiian foo foo food list if you insist."}, {"review_id": "9PqJXn5ySYE0Eg3z1FT28Q", "user_id": "97YdD8tkMkUSvGUw6_u4GQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "Solid but predictable fine dining restaurant. If you come here for the later service, the temperature drops precipitously when half of the restaurant empties out. Dress warmly. All of the dishes were solid but none is mind blowing. We had the tasting menu with wine pairing and I liked in particular the wines that complemented the dishes super well. If there are things that you dislike on the tasting menu, don't hesitate to ask for a substitution. Some highlights:Ginger-crusted Onaga / red tailed snapper. Well put together and balanced. Like the ginger crust. Wailua chocolate crunch bar with bittersweet chocolate mousse - like the presentation and texture on the dessert Soup and sandwich - really liked the sandwich with grilled fois gras and kalua pig. Didn't care for the tomato soup. San Francisco had better tomato soup. Lobster lasagna - I skipped shrimp part due to allergy. The dish is a bit on the heavier side with butter as the base of lobster, and the lasagna \"wall\" is a bit hard but overall solid. SKIP:Twice cooked Kalbi - traditional short rib non-Korean style even though it's braised then grilled. The sauce selection was interesting but the dish is not my favorite. A bit too salty. Need polenta or something to balance the saltyness of the short ribChopped ahi sashimi and avocado stack - I like the herbal addition to the dish but the overall dish lacks complexity and balance. Macadamia Chocolate crusted coconut sorbet - too large in size for the last course of a tasting menu substitution. I prefer coconut ice cream to sorbet here. The Chocolate crust lacks Chocolate decadence - would recommend subbing milk chocolate for dark chocolate here. The tasting menu was a bit too much - recommend sharing individual dishes instead to avoid over eating. For wine pairing, I especially liked the Marc Hebrart brut champaign and the Albariño from Pacificio de fefinanes.

They have valet parking, but you can find some free street parking.Definitely comparable to Roy's or Azure's in terms of ambiance and selection."}, {"review_id": "PEX4bmFTIhSMUy_fsDVSnw", "user_id": "-eaEdTvNiuXoUiT-9MLOxA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "The meal and experience here were OK.  I'm not sure what I was expecting.  Maybe because between NY/DC/LA, we are so spoiled for tasting menu options that they start to blend together.  It's pretty easy to spend $100+ per person on food for a creative multi-course meal that will impress you.  I can only surmise that the people who love Alan Wong's in Oahu don't have a lot of options when it comes to fine dining.  That isn't a slight on Oahu, frankly the cheap eats in Oahu are far better than the majority of \"fine dining\" meals I've had.  I did notice that a lot of the diners were locals who seemed to know the staff personally and they seemed to be having a great time as if it was a family style gathering instead of a tasting menu.  I was a bit jealous because our experience was not as good: more clinical than familial when it came to service, and more \"paint-by-numbers\" than Rembrandt when it came to food.  If you are visiting from out of town, I would save your money and go to Fresh Catch or Helena's!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/alan-wongs-restaurant-honolulu?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
