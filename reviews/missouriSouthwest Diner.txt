Quaint little corner diner but don't let that fool you, there is a wait and it's for good reason! The food is delicious! They have a cool outside waiting area called \"The Bus\" yes an actual decked out bus with a bar and coffee inside and seats. We got there around 1:30 and it was packed but we're seated in about ten mins and everyone was very responsive and polite. Let's get to the GRUB! I like to call myself a Elite Judge  of pancakes so of course I had to get them. They have these cornmeal pancakes all I can say is YUM! They appear like your average but the taste and texture are a bit different and a little sweeter. They do sit heavier then your other pancakes so I opted for the short stack (2). The syrup gets soaked directly into them but that's fine with me the more the better!!I do suggest the pancakes and get the turkey bacon it was yummy I ate three pieces and stared at my plate trying to make them re-appear. Mimosas are always a must! They make them just how I like, champagne with a SPLASH of OJ lol. Although it's not served in a cute flute, but a glass cup it still does the job just fine! I will defiantly be back to try more. This is a place for great food that's not going to break the bank and is such a cool atmosphere to catch up with friends."}, {"review_id": "IVg7U2PfdYbiGsw9N5KHDA", "user_id": "AAYvaNRQ0TD_2Lpo-wFOUA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "I'd heard of Southwest Diner many time and driven by a few. A few Sundays ago, I was planning on going to a different diner, but it was closed. I was happy to see that Southwest Diner was open. I thought it was called Southwest because it's on Southwest, but the food actually is a little more southwestern than that at most diners. Clever. I liked the atmosphere. Southwestern theme. And Sunday morning had a fun, excited, varied crowd. The place was nearly full--we were fortunate to not have to wait for a table. There was a line by the time we left. Staff quite nice. I had the homemade black bean burger. Just a little spicy. Hit the spot. My dining companion struggled to decide what to order. She ended up being adventurous with the peanut butter and jelly with thick-cut bacon on French toast. She thoroughly enjoyed not only the novelty of this sandwich, but the taste. I don't know if she's made a PBJ this way since, but I know she was considering it.I hope to go back very soon."}, {"review_id": "SgYeZX6GXI6fCcry3j30Hw", "user_id": "oY302SkuD4wqGGiRuPDwlQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Made it back finally and while I couldn't give the full 5 stars last time, they certainly picked it up this morning.   All the things I loved about this place the first time , excellent fast and friendly service, fun atmosphere, were again on point.  The food was even better this time, not that we didn't enjoy it the first time.  I tried the Lady Day Enchiladas and they were AMAZING!   Don't let the name fool you... I'm a big boy and I barely could eat it all.  Tortillas stacked with eggs, choice of meats (I had their homemade sausage) with all sorts of delicious sauces and cheese and whatnots in it that just made the flavors explode. Topped with their amazing sausage gravy it just doesn't get any better.  Served with their deliciously fluffy potatoes which were seasoned better this time, this was certainly a hit. My friend had the breakfast burrito and as expected could only eat about half.  Their burritos are HUGE and their flavor matches it's size.  He had it topped with half green and half red chili; he preferred the green but it comes down to preference since both are delicious. Even though we arrived just minutes before 10 on a Saturday morning, we were immediately sat at a table which was quite surprising.  Our entire experience was excellent, so nothing else needs to be said other than I can't wait to get back and try more of their menu!"}, {"review_id": "lCy-kySAGvspzd55QKuv1Q", "user_id": "t33fqVVaEbYbKfTo_cA6eg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "We used the waitlist through Yelp to help ease the wait time.

For barely anything at all I got a whole lot of deliciousness on a plate that left me full and content. I'm a huge fan of breakfast burritos so I had to go with the New Mexican Breakfast Burrito with chorizo. This thing was pretty massive and jam packed with flavor. If you like your burritos to pack a punch, this is the breakfast burrito for you because it's packing some heat. I would say it's a little on the spicy side of things, but that was fine with me. There's nothing remotely bland about this burrito and I'm so glad I decided to try it. Probably one of the better breakfast burritos I've ever had and it will be difficult for me to try something different next time I visit. However, I did see some more delicious items on the menu and I look forward to trying them all."}, {"review_id": "lqTKzpH9VEP4z3A8orkMdA", "user_id": "M1fk_IYOyZBKIw6ov8Q9hg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "This looks like a typical corner neighborhood restaurant/bar/diner, named after the street it is on.  And in many respects it is.  But the name is also a double entendre for the style of food.  While the interior has an understated southwest flavor, it's really only the food that is southwestern.  And they do a pretty darn good job at it.  I was there for breakfast, and ordered the New Mexican breakfast burrito, green enchilada style.  It comes with a pretty decent assortment of ingredients (egg, potato green chiles, sausage) , but you can add on extras for $1.50 or $2 each.  I added guacamole and chorizo to mine for extra flavor and heft.  It was quite delicious, with a not-too-heavy layer of green enchilada sauce over the top that didn't drown.  Guacamole added a a rich creamines, while the chorizo gave some of that extra chorizo-y flavor that I like.  Very satisfying, with those green chiles adding zest throughout.  I also ordered a cup of posole, which is sort of a chick pea based red stew.  It had a nice savoriness that went well with the interesting body from the chickpeas."}, {"review_id": "M0jVxv6sQtl1JLpjYdU9FA", "user_id": "5bJKdIYSYwn0ABZAGxbuXA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "10/16/2017", "text": "Now, I know what you'll be thinking towards the middle of this review: \"Great, another southerner that thinks his experience with Tex-Mex cuisine makes him an expert on all things Mexican food.\"Not entirely true, but I'd like to think that my opinion deserves at least some merit, given that 30% of the food I've consumed in my life has been on, in, or under a dang tortilla.Probably a bit of an exaggeration, but you get the gist.I've lived in the Southwest of Texas for most of my life, and I've eaten a lot of its food, so I can tell you...this diner is missing the mark. Even without a comparison based on culinary authenticity, I find myself genuinely surprised by all of the outstanding reviews after my wife & I ate here for the first time this past weekend. There wasn't much flavor to be found on either of our plates...stale flour tortillas, mushy potatoes, and a lukewarm carne adovada that was in desperate of seasoning & spice. Hey, the coffee was good.Before y'all dust off your torches & pitchforks, I'll say this: I will certainly return and give it a proper second chance because the loyal following of Southwest Diner almost demands it - but that doesn't mean that my first impressions were anything short of disappointing."}, {"review_id": "2XRlpBllXtVjQMewsAzDuQ", "user_id": "v9kNOSkmtpwAESHKtcuNjA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/16/2017", "text": "Nice southwest themed diner and pretty good spot for Sunday brunch. Be sure to reserve ahead or use the \"add me to the line\" function Yelp has. There was a 45 min wait at 10:30am last Sunday. We were seated about 35 min into that wait. And the wait is worth it. They have your classic brunch cocktails-- mimosas and bloody Mary's-- as well as other tasty selections like the beer-mosa and Irish coffee. I ordered the Irish coffee and greatly enjoyed it. They use whiskey and whipping cream (served layered and you stir it up).All of their brunch offerings have a southwest theme. Lots of tacos and burritos and tortillas on this menu. I ordered the breakfast burrito and my friend ordered the huevos rancheros. My burrito was delicious and exactly what you expect from a southwest style breakfast burrito! My friend's huevos rancheros looked authentic and she said they were tasty.The decor and the little things really add up here. They keep a solid desert-like colors and decorations all around. They also have glass coke bottles re-purposed as syrup bottles."}, {"review_id": "L1kZ6aymhwvYlrd_P_CWZw", "user_id": "ybpli-aEbrGTtF5CkwzK9Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "GROSS!!!

Southwest Diner you get the honors. My lady stumbled on Southwest Diner and we decided to check it out for breakfast on Sunday morning during our visit in St. Louis. It's essentially a Diner with plenty of typical diner fare with a New Mexico touch. Huge portions and quite a delicious spot to eat...We showed up just shy of the diner opening at 8am and there was already a line just waiting for doors to open. Seating is self serve and then a waiter or waitress will make their way out with waters and a menu. Apparently I heard that the bus that's parked next door serves adult beverages if you happen to have to wait a bit for a table (just a note).Once studying the entire menu, I ended up going for their Southwest Slinger which was a monster of a breakfast featuring two burger patties over home fries with 2 eggs, choice of green or red chile, cheese & of course I opted for the extra homemade sausage gravy to top it off. Best way to describe it... hearty, filling, tasty. I went with the green chiles on mine and it definitely built up a good amount of heat towards the last bites. Definitely half the portion would've been good, but I'm not one to waste and knowing we couldn't take it home since we'd be on the road, I powered through and finished the entire thing. On the other hand my fiancee's breakfast burrito was just as generous in portion and also delicious. Their burritos are served with eggs, cheese, green chiles, and home fries and you can add your choice of meat and top it off with red or green chiles & cheese (enchilada style) for additional.  She went with their homemade sausage to fill and christmas style (both red and green chile sauces) and gotta say it was just as good!Aside from being overly stuff from our meals, I will note that their house coffee it top notch. Not your average diner coffee that's for sure. Our waitress was pleasant and food came out hot 'n fresh. No issue finding parking on the street nearby. All in all, can't really find one thing to complain about here other than we could use somewhere like this in Chicago. =P'Til next time, cheers!232/365"}, {"review_id": "WID7kI3OFFpJE8tVPeHHDw", "user_id": "jLf2BLTDq1tzizy3E7pe9g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/13/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Had to park about a block away, only has street parking.  You can check in ahead of time on yelp as long as you are within 10 miles.

I got one of the specials (which came with the menu on a separate piece of paper). It was called something like \"Lady breakfast\" which for some reason made me think it was going to be lighter in some way. I was so wrong. It was like a crispy tortilla with eggs, cheese, spicy red sauce, chorizo (choice of meat) on top with another crispy tortilla and sausage gravy drizzled over the whole thing. Side of potatoes. *drooling* -Good price for amount of food. I felt like the price was incredibly fair with options between $7-13. -Food was spicy, which for me was a pro, but I know for some people it may be a con. However, I think you could avoid the more spicier options like when choosing your meat. -Good service, fast. Cons: -The only real con I would give this place is that it is a 'diner' atmosphere with tables squeezed a little closer together and no room to wait if you have to for a table. I felt like I was in the way of everyone during a very short 2 minute wait. It seemed like a popular place (because the food was so delicious) that I think there could be a wait occasionally, but while we were there around 9am on a Saturday morning we didn't see anyone wait for long. With the diner atmosphere comes a louder atmosphere and that did bother me at times when trying to converse with my partner and waiter.

I got one of their two current specials (photo attached). If the breakfast's I've had in St. Louis, this one had the most flavor, style, and overall deliciousness! It reminded me of Brother Junipers in Memphis.Service: Service was fast and attentive. I never saw more than two groups waiting at the door and never for long. Our waiter had quite a few tables, but that was not evident. We didn't have to wait on our food. The staff was friendly.Atmosphere: One downside, if it is cold outside and you are in the side of the one room of tables that are closest to the door, you might as well keep your coat on. It was cold every time someone opened the door. I don't mind this, but the tables are closer together so if you're looking for a more intimate get together this might not be the place.Overall, I thought it was fun, yum, and I will definitely be back to try out some other great things on the menu."}, {"review_id": "1tchp5p5sI7AzADebYvNwA", "user_id": "NUPZISs9NqX9cZeI4CEfZA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "You must eat here!!!
