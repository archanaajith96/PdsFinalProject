They had great food and a decent selection of vegetarian options which surprised me considering the area that we are in is steak country. This is one of the only places that was open on Sunday so myself and my coworkers decided to check it out. The atmosphere is pretty cool also it reminds me of a snow mountain lodge. The service was on point as well; our waitress checked in on us frequently and always made sure that we were satisfied.I ordered the Hofbrau original lager,  which is one of their light beer selections. It was delicious and refreshing and had just enough fight at the end of it to make me want more. I also ordered the mac & cheese spatzle and the pretzel stick appetizer. The pretzels were soft and came out smoking hot! They were absolutely delicious and so were the two dipping sauces that they came with which were cheese and Dijon mustard sauce ( as a sidenote both of the sauces are already in plastic cups so ask for lids if you want to take them with you to go). The mac & cheese was fantastic and tasted like it had homemade sauce on it. The pasta was beautifully cooked and I had to keep myself from licking the plate! My coworkers got the veggie spatzle and the cheese soup and both of them raved about their dishes so I can imagine that they were just as good as mine!If I am ever back in the Des Moines area I will definitely check this place out again!"}, {"review_id": "7olHdpVephdPPJfh8elywQ", "user_id": "88AY14XGwGbLAjxsTs1E1Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "I've always loved this place. So many beer options and pretty quick bartenders. The aesthetics of the place is all wood, long tables, very German. I've been to Munich before (not to brag) but they did this one pretty spot on. I don't eat much here but they do actually have good food. The last thing I've had there was the Jagerschnitzel which was okay but I think I like their Wienerschnitzel better. Not very German but their Armadillo Eggs are something to not skip.It's all about the boots though. Have 3 or more folks to challenge yourselves at the boot. If you're okay with each other's germs, it's a drinking game to pass around the boot without letting it touch the table in between. This place is just a great time but weekends can be really packed and you're standing in a very tight crowd trying to get a drink in. Warmer weather they have the patio open so who doesn't like a cold beer outside?"}, {"review_id": "08GPCPXxtsNKdrlnLhF-7Q", "user_id": "x3_dqQofC4AIKgT6uPaDGQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "I would give this place two stars for it's \"German\" food, which wasn't very German at all.  But, if you look past the fact that it's not German at all, then it's a decent pub food assortment.The meat & cheese platter was all american and italian meats and cheeses.  The rouladen \"egg rolls\" were basically a philly cheesesteak in an egg roll.Now all that being said... if you're not looking for German food, but rather looking for some unique twists on American bar food, then it's a good choice.  They do have an impressive menu of German beers, and I could easily spend some time here for the beer alone.  but the food... while unique, isn't very authentic German food."}, {"review_id": "oznk9kAFshfRD4R63SOWjA", "user_id": "UlQT2JpXOTSuWLPl56140g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "You gotta do the boot!

We also ordered a side of german potato salad which was also delicious. They have a lot of beer on draft (and bottled) and there are a bunch of TVs for games.  Unfortunately because of the weather the dish reception for the tv was interrupted but the employees here were very apologetic about it (even though its not their fault).There is a parking garage located right next to the restaurant which made it very convenient for us during the thunderstorm occurring the night we came."}, {"review_id": "RE8KWymzZXp2BNjcnGV2Zg", "user_id": "AAqCWD6MLM2sA8CTJLvZsg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "This is the second time my husband and I have visited this wonderful German restaurant and bar.

The service was a bit slow but they were busy. We had dinner reservations at another restaurant otherwise we would've stayed for the live music and food.

Apparently we aren't allowed to ask for water since it is a huge bother and I guess it also comes with eye rolling on the side. Maybe I was wrong for assuming water was supposed to come with our meals. I understand everyone has bad nights sometimes but it doesn't mean you have to take it out on your customers. I've read other reviews about the same server & customers that had a similar experience we did, so i'm assuming nothing has changed since then.

We sat at the bar and were quickly greeted by a friendly bartender. Not knowing much about German beer, the bartender was very helpful in finding one for me! We ordered the jumbo soft pretzel and were pretty underwhelmed by it. Not a lot of flavor, just a lot of dough. However, were the pretzel fell flat; the rest of the food was fantastic! I had the mac & cheese baden-baden and it was amazingly rich with great flavor. I had to take over half of it home but really enjoyed it. My fiancé had the best of the wurst platter and ate every bite. It was perfect to get a little bit of everything. I will say, this is the type of place that needs a crowd to really feel right. It was nearly empty when we went and it felt awkward. We are excited to go back on a busy evening to experience the lively crowd and energy described in these other reviews!"}, {"review_id": "9DldhpM-6A3dpaRH1JbD0A", "user_id": "ma190_o_ekQAbVaUjZuzLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Awesome Biergarten atmosphere, DELICIOUS German & German-inspired food, and great drinks.  New, undisputed \"Go-to\" for German/Bavarian cuisine!  *Awful Schwarzenegger impression* \"I'll be back\""}, {"review_id": "8u0qMl4zwVmulkikEh5wow", "user_id": "JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "Outstanding German beer selection.  Fine pretzels.  Other than that, Hessen Haus is a pub and nothing more.  Service is slow and the waitress seemed very confused and not knowledgeable on her extensive beer list.  TVs were on weird events like college hockey and wrestling when there was a NFL playoff game on.  Menus dirty and music loud.  Pass with so many better options within a 5 minute walk."}, {"review_id": "LHBLI6MSybAS9HgODftp0Q", "user_id": "DtZjCcj754UvKXO8ZTDc7g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "Great service and decent food.

I remember when DSM had both the Bavarian Inn and Cafe Salzburg (it was in Altoona, but close enough) and since then the pickings have been slim. Fortunately, Hessen Haus has filled that void. Not only do they have German food on their menu, they are about the closest thing to a traditional German Bierhall as we have in Iowa. The biggest thing here is the beer. They've got some of the finest German beers this side of Munich. I was particularly happy to see one of my favorites, Hacker-Pschorr Weisse on tap! I went over the top and ordered a liter. This is a LOT of beer, especially as filling as German beer can be. The beers served at Hessen Haus are not only tasty but fresh. You can order the traditional \"Das Boot\" which is filled with a beer of your choice and comes with drinking rules that must be followed. It can be a really fun activity (which is of course enhanced with each boot you order). The food here is nothing fancy but it's good. I like their Bavarian nachos, with cubed bratwurst and banana peppers. Very tasty! In addition to some yummy sausages, there are a couple of German items on the menu - a jaegerschnitzel and a rind rouladen. I've had both there and I enjoy the rind rouladen the most. It's basically a beef roll filled with onion and butter and rolled thin. Very tasty! Their sides of red cabbage and potato salad complete the dinners.The atmosphere here can be wild on a weekend night, with singing, dancing, drinking and fun times had by all. I would like to see this place during Oktoberfest.Hats off to Hessen Haus... a little taste of Germany right here in Central Iowa!"}, {"review_id": "BqgjZqASey781GDJOsyXVw", "user_id": "PH2UKjwpCZD6JW4evZv50A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/3/2017", "text": "Delious food, great beer, & comfortable atmosphere!

I was going to give it 3 stars, but a half day has gone by and I'm feeling sentimental, so... here's the thing. The Hessen Haus, when it opened, was a miraculous gift to the Midwest. Fresh German beer on draft, fairly authentic food, polka bands playing if you paid attention and showed up at the right time- truly amazing! And there was the 20-something who hosted trivia night on Sundays who WROTE HIS OWN QUESTIONS. And you can't argue that they still have an amazing and ever-increasing number of German draft beers. True, it is frustrating that the apparently print one beer menu for the entire year so half of what is printed might not be available and beers that are on draft are not listed, but truly - I think we can agree it is worth the trouble for the opportunity to drink beer von fass from Cloister Andechs. The food is quite tasty and quite German, although you might have to negotiate if you want a different side than the one listed when you order a main dish. You should be prepared for two things before you enter. 1) there may be baby boomers yelling, no matter what time of day you visit. They will have arrived on bicycles and it will be unclear if they are drunk or hard of hearing or both, but they will be quite loud. 2) the wait staff may appear lost and unable to make eye contact. I asked, and they do not mind at all if you locate your own menu. I advise doing so, because when they do make their way to your table, you will want to take advantage of that moment to place an order while you can. And ask for utensils, ice water and napkins."}, {"review_id": "Cn8hXV9mGgAauny13ri3iA", "user_id": "UYwf-LvQv6KEc79vWkl1aw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Just visiting Des Moines Downtown for a couple days.

Came on a Friday night, super packed, luckily our cousins grabbed a table beforehand. Our server was not the greatest, she barely checked on our table, and we ordered a round of shots... the sever got herself one, but she put it on our tab. I was not okay with that. This place is known for \"DASS BOOT\" its a boot shaped glass that fits 6 beers! I don't know if this can be finished by 1 person but we passed it around and played the  game that was on the back of the menu. The game was super fun and it made us drink the beer much faster than planned. I was not a big beer drinker, I played, but took sips (sorry friends). I ordered a beef stroganoff and it was nothing special. Plain pasta, sauce wasn't very flavorful.

The food is good, and fairly authentic. I find some of my favorites, though, are not authentic dishes, but very tasty. Try the sauerkraut balls they are great.Also, if you are there when the train whistle blows they have shot specials on Jaegermeister and Apfelkorn.Bottom line hit up the Hessen Haus, laugh, eat, make new friends, and say hello to my favorite waitress / bartender.
