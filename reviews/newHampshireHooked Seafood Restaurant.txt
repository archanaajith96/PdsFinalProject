You get the best of both worlds when it comes to food choices- they have two different menus. One menu has seafood and the other one doesn't (this menu is part of the Ignite Bar & Grille) For drinks I ordered off the Ignite Bar & Grille menu- I got the \"Slide to Heaven\" (11$) this drink was just, wow. It had so many combinations of sweet liquors that I expected this drink to not be strong and just have that dessert type taste, nope. I was wrong. Not only was this drink delicious but it was super strong too! You really can't ever find drinks that give you both, this will be my go to drink when I come back here. As for food I ordered off the Hooked Seafood menu and got the Lobster Mac. Everything about this plate was incredible. The presentation, the portion, the texture, the flavor. It was so much food that I could barely finish it all. Don't be fooled by the picture there were TONS of lobster in that dish- it is a deep plate.Lastly the service- our waitress Renee was one of the best waitresses I've come across when dining. She is so full of life, super funny and you can genuinely tell she cares about her customers. Having it be my first time here, she made the experience even more memorable. I am so happy we found this place through yelp! Although, I don't make it out to Manchester often, the experience I had while dining here has made me want to come more frequently!"}, {"review_id": "7ZQ6s9RIF3wA1rsKldRFdA", "user_id": "dkwQVo5_vfS658n9WLwgiw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "One of my favorite seafood restaurant here in NH.

Its a warm atmosphere and the staff is friendly.  We had Mya as a waitress. She was very friendly and easy going.  She immediately brought us glasses of water and asked if there was anything additional we wanted to drink.  She gave us a few minutes and came back with her grin as we put in an order for oysters & muscles.  The muscles were huge compared to other places that Ive had them and almost filled me up.  We just finished our apps as the entrees arrived and what a portion of ahi tuna & haddock did we get.  The Zucchini vegetable medley was delicious, and a little too much on the potato side, but the fish was absolutely amazing.  It would have been nice if the fish size was a tad bigger and a little less mashed potatoes but either way it was absolutely great.  Mya was pleasant the entire time continued to fill our glasses with water without us having to ask and I have not one bad thing to say about this establishment at all.  If you're in the area I highly recommend to go check it out for yourself and enjoy."}, {"review_id": "BM1rYScc2zKKUR60tprNTA", "user_id": "WzGulWsiv77DFmVS1Dad0Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/26/2017", "text": "I had the Blue Point Oysters, which they literary shucked per my order!

We were a group of 9, walking down the street when the most beautiful 'Devil Wears Prada' woman pops out of a door and says \"Are you the party of 7 that called?\" To which I replied \"If it gets us a table, we are!\" At that point Miss Anne gives me a devilish grin and we are instant soulmates.The night was magical for everyone in my team.
