It's pretty unassuming/foreboding from the outside (grey building, jail-like massive fence around it), but inside it has such an awesome vibe with the mood lighting, upscale industrial decor, trendy lounge music, and hipster waiters. The restaurant is not the largest, and there is often a wait (even on a random Wednesday night!), but fortunately, it's easy to pass the time at the bar drinking the delicious cocktails. The mixologists are great and can make all kinds of drinks, even if they're not on the menu. Now, the food. Oh man, the food! Everything I've ever eaten there has been amazing, but if the brussel sprouts were the last dish I'd ever eat, I'd die and go to heaven a very happy lady! They are some of the best I've ever eaten, and I love the sauce and crispy black sesame that it rests on. Yummmm. The portions are pretty big, and meant to be shared (between me and my husband, we order three dishes and are absolutely stuffed by the end). The noodles are delicious, as is the fried chicken. Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything you order. Oh, and the service is fantastic. Never had a bad meal here!"}, {"review_id": "3EAtB6J-K-zqDvLk2q69Mg", "user_id": "BTpJiCqY-EGslHFFtoYrUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "If you are looking to step outside your food comfort zone, look no further than Takoi. When we arrived on a Tuesday at 7, it was an hour wait for 2. Luckily, we were able to snag a couple seats at the full-service bar and only had to wait ~10 minutes. We both ordered drinks, I ordered wine and he ordered a mixed drink. I would not recommend wine, as it was cheap wine with a screwcap for $12 a glass, but the mixed drink was decent. The service at the bar was awesome, all of the bartenders took care of us and split tips so all of the bartenders were asking how we were doing. For apps we ordered the egg roll and brassicas, and let me tell you that egg roll was the best I have ever had. For $7 it is really pricey for 1 small egg roll, so I am not sure I would order again, but man it was good. The brassicas were also very, very good and a better item to split for two. For dinner, I had Khao Soi noodle dish and I was blown away. I do not enjoy coconut milk or curry so I am not sure what even led me to order this dish, but the flavors were so developed and delish. It is a rather large noodle dish, so I think it could easily be split by 2 esp if you order an app or another small item on the menu. I cannot wait to return."}, {"review_id": "ViMxQAAGiglcls_Q90l6LQ", "user_id": "eI-g-8q3MvcG4ROIOcK58A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "I Think I may have found my favorite restaurant in Detroit.

This is for sure the best restaurant in Detroit in my opinion. I did the tasting menu recently and it was fantastic. I cannot say enough about the creativity of the menu and the truly fantastic spectrum of flavors. Furthermore the ambiance is unique, fun and vibrant. It is definitely dark and a bit loud but it is a really fun place to eat. I would 10000% recommend this restaurant. It can be tricky to get a reservation but it is worth the wait. If you want to try everything, I would definitely recommend the tasting menu. I only eat fish (no meat) and there were plenty of options for me. All of the wine/ cocktail pairings were also fantastic.

The flavors were there, but overall I thought the dishes were entirely too salty. Also, the menu does not characterize the khao soi as spicy, but just as a warning, it is. Rice does not come with their curry, which is...weird? Even really upscale places I've been to offer complimentary rice or at the very least naan or roti with their curries. The ambience is cool I suppose and the setup is definitely interesting and unique, but I don't think it's the most practical. The couple of small stools situated at that long center table means there's no place to put one's coat or purse, and even though there's free coat check, there should theoretically be room for a bag or wallet. As for the ambience, I personally found it a little bit too tryhard. I think you can glean a bit of the vibe from a place based on the customers there and the people working there. There were no Asians for the most part save for us, and I think that kind of speaks to what kind of food they serve here. Honestly, at the end of the day, I would rather go for straight-up, no fuss Thai food for a good price that fulfills my expectations."}, {"review_id": "v2lavN6c_KSGnupdpTlIww", "user_id": "jt49xjEjQisu6wTTGn6B3A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/23/2017", "text": "Takoi, in my opinion, is worth the hype.Small plates full of big flavors...spice and everything nice. My husband and I came right at opening (5pm) on a Monday and had no trouble getting a table. Now, it can be upwards of a 2-hour wait at peak time so, while we were eating early, it was worth it to get a seat right away.We dug into several small plates including the Khanom Krock (coconut cream cup) snacks, crispy short ribs (my favorite!), charred corn (with spices, crispy shallots, and scallions), shrimp fried rice, and khao soi (a curried noodle soup). All were spectacular. We're definitely dessert people so we also ordered the banana ice cream and the coconut cream ice cream. Both were outstanding but the former was the real standout for me. The cocktail menu is also very solid and the post-fire renovated space is colorful and modern, just as it used to be before the break-in. Service is splendid. The massive fence around the building is a bit offputting, admittedly, but a.) it does go with the industrial vibe of the restaurant's exterior and b.) after such a damaging fire/robberty I totally understand their desire to protect themselves from future incidents and do not begrudge them that security.

When my lady and I decided to stop in the Friday before Sweetest Day, we figured it would be easy to walk in and wine and dine. No bueno. Corktown was hopping with hungry mammals with a hankering for Thai fusion.Thus, we were seated in the \"Annex Room.\" I initially had literary recollections to Anne Frank, but then I got over it and focused on my main mission: Trying as much food as I could. Small plates are the name of the game; or, \"shareables\" as some Buzzfeed food editor would describe it to sound eloquent and make you feel inferior. Going out to dinner with a woman who is a vegetarian AND has a tree nut allergy sometimes puts me in a bind, but I push through with the vigor of a determined equine on the final lap of the Kentucky Derby.We ordered shrimp fried rice (you can substitute shrimp for naem, AKA pork), corn cob and fried cauliflower. We both agreed: the cauliflower was off the charts...like, Led Zeppelin \"Stairway to Heaven\" off the charts. The sauce, the chili peppers -- I was shoving it into my mouth like I just escaped the famine. Then came the shrimp fried rice, which could have fed four humans and one Alaskan Husky. Then, a half-piece corn cob arrived, smothered in some white mystery sauce (get your mind out of the gutter) and somewhat spicy seasoning. It was awesome and I wish there was more of it.For cocktails she had some gin concoction, while I had a Crimson Rye (whiskey with orange bitters and some other stuff). The drinks were well made; not too stiff but not a Miller 64, either. They ran around $10 each. This place is actually on the pricier side; however, you are supposed to share, OK kids? You get a few plates among 2-3 couples and it's a walk in the park. For two people who drink booze like it's water, you'll spend an easy $50 before tip.I should add that some tables are \"community tables.\" A waitress said two others would be joining us, which I didn't really mind. But when the two others were anal-retentive folks who expressed dismay with the establishment due to the Thai tea not being \"all natural,\" that was the signal for us to leave and head back towards the bat cave. It didn't help that the woman sitting next to me kept elbowing me in the midsection. So, I essentially left with a full stomach, an emptier wallet and bruised ribs.

I'd recommend getting 2 different things for each person. The dishes have a Thai influence, but the menu is very diverse and everything is packed with flavor. The ambiance here is DOPE. White walls, black lights, dark atmosphere. Good place for a night out. They have a full bar and carefully handcrafted drinks. If you're into cognac I recommend the Unknown Pleasures. Only critique: they should keep the doors to the restaurant closed at all times.

Parking is behind the building in an alley or in the front on the street.  But seriously it's so cool inside - unique decor and upscale atmosphere. It's a pretty small space inside with limited seating.  We tried the \"Takoi experience\" which lets the chef make what he wants and it's brought out family style. We had an awesome experience even tho I personally did not try everything (I don't eat seafood), but our party of 8 pretty much cleared the plates that came our way.  I would recommend going this route of sharing  vs ordering a single entree. Be aware if you don't like cilantro or spicy food, your menu choices will be limited.  Even the ice cream was spicy!  The flavors in each dish are very strong - lots of citrus, mint, chili.  Awesome presentation of the food and excellent service!"}, {"review_id": "mbY7T7rarqwX2RPyDgWHXg", "user_id": "YPvfXRsIYVgrenwau4-aFw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "WOAH!

Takoi, recently changed its nice from Katoi, which is Thai for a slur towards transgendered people.The inside of the restaurant felt almost like a club or a very cool and ravenous eating place. There were no reservations available the night I visited Takoi, so I gladly took a seat at the bar where my waitress made me a fantastic 'Winter is Coming' cocktail. The cocktail was refreshing, and just the right amount of sweet with bourbon, pear liquor, and jicama juice. I had their khao soi curried noodles and their crisy spare ribs. I initially wasn't going to get the spare ribs because I had come to Takoi for some Thai food and figured ribs was far from Thai. The spare ribs at Takoi were probably the best ribs I've had in my life, and were made with a honey/caramel sauce and amazing spices. The curried noodles had just the right amount of flavor.Will definitely visit Takoi the next time I'm back in the big D."}, {"review_id": "foK4-HaEAd_SrM5dErnVSg", "user_id": "j_6xoB4R63tcUWJ0cCAFEA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "Went to Takoi a couple of weeks ago on a Friday night.

I'm sure it's hard to keep a metal shipping container at the right temperature. I wish we were still there at 10pm when the DJ started playing, because that would have been fun to see, but we couldn't stick it out for 5 hours :-)For drinks we got a Queen of Siam, which was kind of savory and unexpected flavor combo but was good and the Backed by Sciences which was also good. For food we got the Khao Soi, which had delicious flavor. It was hard to eat because it's noodles and soup in a shareable bowl, but the waitress gave us some tips. Only forks were given as silverware, and a knife would have been helpful for this dish. The Squash Tempura was good as well and had a pretty large portion for the price. Surprisingly after those two dished we were pretty full, but we got dessert anyway. The waitress suggested the Fat Elvis Roll. It was good, but they put a bit too much candied bacon on it.Overall a good experience, I wish we were with a larger group so that we could have tried more things.
