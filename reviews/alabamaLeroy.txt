I've been coming to Montgomery for the past 8 years for my fiancé's UTA weekend for the Air Force and this has been a favorite bar of ours for years. Tabitha is incredible and makes absolutely fantastic drinks. We're from Atlanta and always joke that we would drive the 3 hours just to have Tabitha make us a drink."}, {"review_id": "YJHOIZjgM3s7BFZB3eDMWg", "user_id": "sVy5pmUN2J0sE2AzmgoBvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Cozy, dark, and welcoming.

Good mix of college students, professionals, and retirees - different crowds depending on the time of day. Bartenders know their stock and the mixed drinks are top notch. If you're in Montgomery and you want great craft beer, this is the place.  The atmosphere doesn't get any better. Cozy, old school New Orleans vibe with dimly lit lamps, carved wooden walls and thick red curtains. One of the best places to hang out and enjoy a beer with friends anywhere.  An awesome selection of local, national, and foreign beers on draft. The beers  on tap change every week or so, so you'll always have something new to try.  If the seating inside is too crowded for your taste, they have a great outdoor seating area in the back. This is one of my favorite spots to grab a beer and relax outside."}, {"review_id": "FkPipQOKQb_lc1nQy-XGzw", "user_id": "HI9m5UB77q6g3DzBds0TQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/25/2017", "text": "Oh Montgomery, I knew you had a hipster part of you. I made my way over here after a long hurricane evacuation because I needed more than just a beer. I wanted a sophisticated cocktail and these folks did not disappoint.  I found a spot by the bar and sulked into my cocktail. The staff was great, they really work in such unison. Teamwork is definitely present. The dim lighting on the sign gave it that sultry yet low key vibe. After my frou frou cocktail, I noticed they had an pretty impressive beer list so of course I dove in. I went to a few bars in town and this one was my favorite, hands down. It's located in a cute neighborhood known for its historical factor so I'm not surprised the vibe was also groovy. In the back, there's some picnic tables to drink and chill at. The area is covered in cool signs and stickers. As you make your way back inside, the framed art is definitely something to observe. Good Job, Montgomery."}, {"review_id": "MYA2k6OrXukexawyQ1cx8Q", "user_id": "H_HGZdinikTwFkZnwps86A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/24/2017", "text": "Good drinks, great people, tough (but fun) trivia nights!

There are amber glass chain lights that many will recognize( perhaps from granny's!), a long bar against one wall, chairs on opposite. They had about 15-20 micro beers on tap! Coolers stoked with imports!!! The only thing missing was galiano so I could have a Harvey Wallbanger!!! There is a smoking section out the back door with picnic tables, Chinese lanterns and enough kitchy charm that is part bait shack, part mardi gras!!! This place looks like it should be on a historic register! The bartender was friendly and gave us many samples of draughts that we weren't familiar with until we found the perfet one. They range from darker than guiness to the palest ale.....a selection that has something for everyone. Stop by this dive, have a cocktail and think of the good old days!!!"}, {"review_id": "adCM_kKoCv-oBKbuAiIf_w", "user_id": "sIzgSv-rseE9mtbVh1iGKA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/3/2017", "text": "laid back place.Friendly staff.
