Hubby and I were sat at the bar area because there was no regular tables left, which is totally fine with us. At the bar, you get a view of the cooks cooking your meals so you know that you're getting good quality food. The waitress was quick to ask us what we wanted to drink and to mention specials/favorites on the menu.I was so overwhelmed by the amazing and diverse items on the menu! And what I really appreciated is that they do half orders (I'm a small person and am not able to finish a full American sized portion). Hubby got the spicy creole Benedict, which has lobster and hollndaise sauce, and I got the French Swiss dip sandwich with fries. We also got the cinnamon French toast on the side. Soooo bomb!!If you're military, they will willingly give you a 10% discount as long as you have your military ID.I can't wait to come back here and try other things on the menu!"}, {"review_id": "wJK_AkCVpcjXitfTtAr4gA", "user_id": "907kqSPlCiChQnygYhmQHw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Average to good food. Outrageous prices. Long wait. Cramped and crowded. Neat-o train car. 2.49 stars.We waited about 45 minutes to get sat for breakfast on a Saturday morning. We got there before 9am, which is practically the crack of dawn to one such as myself, but they were already mobbed. They have free hot coffee which was a nice touch, but the food was ultimately not worth half the hassle and stress of the wait, crowds and shite parking.The chicken fried steak itself was ok. Not as good as Chaps, but not bad. Crunchy on the outside, meaty and tender inside. The gravy was bad. Chalky texture and poor taste from an abundance of corn starch or flour. Hash browns were in the top 20% of restaurant hashbrowns. Very nice! They also accommodated my request for extra crispy browns, a hallmark of any decent breakfast joint.Biscuit was also very good. Buttery, and split to maximize surface area for browning. I would come back for the biscuits if the crowding and wait times weren't so awful.Eggs were cooked to spec in some of that godawful, puss-yellow oil blend that penny-pinching restaurants sometimes use.Overall a decent meal, but at $15 for a chicken fried steak and considering the hassle it was not a good value IMO. Total bill was over $50 for two adults and a couple of toddlers."}, {"review_id": "PB4tv1umGkudI0zZjtrMNQ", "user_id": "oO9SCDo0MOY3d7PUURT1AA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "OK, So breakfast is hands down my favorite meal of the day... I'm not sure how I lived in Spokane for the last 5 years, and have never eaten at Franks until just recently...A surefire sign that I was missing out, was a client of mine travelled from Tri Cities, to Spokane... to eat at Franks Diner... What does that tell you?The food was INSANE!!!! So delicious I wanted to lick my plate. I had the chicken fried steak n eggs, when they ask if you want your hashbrowns smothered... YOU DO!!! They add cheese, sauteed onions and gravy, perfectly balanced deliciousness!!Breakfast for two was $30."}, {"review_id": "fU6LQOh9GvDt3diihjAAKw", "user_id": "N5cTSxPNGm012ozk1xA1Xw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Exactly what I needed. A great experience and stupendous service from the host and staff. Inside the train I went. Was greeted and seated with politeness and a smile. Advised my host this was my first visit and he walked me through the house favorites on the menu. Ordered the chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes & gravy with green beans. Came with a grilled biscuit which I added honey butter and apple butter to. Absolutely amazing! To say the least. I really love this place. Located near Gonzaga University it was exceptional to have experienced such well prepared comfort food. I ended the course with a peach cobbler a la mode for dessert. WOW! Beyond delicious. It was fresh and homemade from scratch I must ad. Please stop in and take my advice you won't be disappointed! I Highly recommended this 5 Star establishment. I'll be back again when visiting Spokane, WA.

Even on such a cold day in Spokane, the restaurant has a line of people on the waiting less, while all the booths and seats were filled with people as well.My friends and I were able to get seats after about a 30 minute wait and it was well worth it for the environment.The waitress we had, had been working there for at least 20 years and she was so sweet and on top of things! I was able to try the fried-green tomatos and it was delicious! I only got half a portion but I still had left overs after completing my meal.  The tomatos were soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside, and the gravy on the side was such a bonus. I also was able to try their chocolate milk shakes and wow those were huge and soooo bomb!

We can walk that,\" my colleague said as we considered our options for brunch on an appropriately chilly October morning in Spokane. Frank's promised a kitschy experience so I was  willing to make the trek! And trek we did, thanks to the construction hindering many parts of downtown Spokane. Upon arrival, we were greeted with a 45 minute wait (although we could see empty seats...?) and free coffee + water service in a covered gazebo to tide us during said wait. Given the flock of people also waiting, my colleague and I decided Frank's must be worth the wait.And indeed it was! The food was absolutely delicious and came out quickly (no easy feat for a packed restaurant!). I was trying to be good and order fruit instead of hash browns, but they brought me hash browns instead... I just rolled with it and figured it was meant to be. I especially enjoyed the seasonal pumpkin waffle with creme brûlée sauce as it was not cloyingly sweet and the waffle had the right consistency of not being too hard or too soft. I would be in favor of visiting Frank's again, just so long as I have plenty of time to spare for that wait for seats!"}, {"review_id": "hzjNCdUbzbmZbhDs9nQn1w", "user_id": "ybOO_Tur8XzOloj2orc7Tw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Franks is housed in an old rail car which is reason enough to pay a visit.

Probably not, but I think you get the picture. Imho, there are better places (for both value and quality) within walking distance of Franks. I live close so I'll spend the extra money and go to Frank's on a weekday, but I wouldn't touch this place on a weekend. It's just not worth the effort to wait in line, pay more than I should, and tolerate the average service for a slightly above average product.I don't mean to sound salty, but I figure with everyone on here losing their minds over how great it is, someone needs to bring the expectations back down to earth.

Checked Yelp while hubby checks Google. We both found this place with great reviews, so off we went. It wad well worth it in so many ways. This historic railroad car much like the hotel held 100 years of history. The majority of the fixtures, stain glass and counters were original. The story of this particular car was so interesting, I forgot about the food.Well making up for that was easy enough and Gage was there to help us in our journey through their extensive menu. It was wonderful to see some southern favourites for me. To have fried green tomatoes offered isn't something I'm use to since moving away from home. Cajun specialties, chicken and waffles, you just hope there is a southern heart beating back there in the kitchen. Hubby and I were thrilled with the service and so wonderfully surprised by the quality and portions of our meals. I had the Cajun Seafood Omelet and it was wonderful. No skimping on the crab or lobster. Nice big pieces with a delightful Cajun sauce with enough of a kick to savor. This southern girl would have taken in more heat if that was possible. Hubby had the Works and cleaned the plate. Wish I lived nearby to partake in more they offered. Next time wet visit Spokane, I will be looking for Gage and more from this delicious menu.

I must say, the chicken was so delicious. It was breaded perfectly and super tender. I got my caramel on the side because not a big fan of sweetness. I finished my whole plate and was extremely satisfied with the taste, portion, service, and it's unique atmosphere!!!

Per daughter, \"Potatoes...seemed reheated, too much paprika on them or whatever seasoning they use. Not enough turkey.\"  On the other hand, my small Bistro Vegetarian Omelet was wonderful! They did a nice job of grilling the onions that enhanced the portobello mushroom, spinach, roasted Roma tomato, and cheese on the fluffy omelet. The red pepper pesto sauce topping was also nice. I chose a biscuit (buttermilk?) for my accompaniment that was shared with daughter. It was so perfectly crispy and tender that she ordered a second one for herself. There was no charge to split the Child sized chocolate malted milkshake, which had enough malt to taste  (yum!) but was too sweet. Service was attentive and very friendly.

Eggs Benedict: Had that extra something which made them better than the usual Eggs Benedict. I don't know what it is, but it just tasted better.And there were a lot of extras. Hash browns were very generous, humongous in fact, with lots of extra gravy. I like the omelette came with 4 (?) halves of toast and the chicken fried steak came with 2 grilled biscuits. There was enough extra to have an extra meal the next day.So I would say, pretty good meal and very generous portions. Fast and friendly service.

Parking is very open, so don't worry about having to look for parking like you would for when you're in downtown area. Frank's Diner is located about 10 minutes outside of downtown Spokane next to several car dealerships. I was drawn to the train car diner, which was a cute concept. The wait was quite up there, so we weren't picky about which booth or which corner seat we'd get. After 45 mins, we finally got to our booth. My boyfriend went overboard with the food (as always) with the waffle, bacons, eggs, sausages, and toasts. I only ordered half of Country Egg Benedict and a side of fruits (to make myself feeling less guilty - haha). The service was good. The portion was awesome. Yes, that little egg benedict and fruits filled me out VERY good. The train car made the pathway quite small for the hallway walk, but nobody cared. Everyone was there for the food. We will definitely come back when we're ever visiting Spokane again."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/franks-diner-spokane?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
