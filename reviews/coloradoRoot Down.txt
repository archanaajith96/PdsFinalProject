So fortunate to start off out Denver weekend with one of the best dinners I've had in a long time. Omg seriously the BEST lamb evrrrr. I can't stop thinking about it. The flat iron steak was also delicious. So tender and savory.Omg and don't even get me started on the burrata and prosciutto appetizer.It was seriously the most perfect delicious menu I've ever had! It's like they KNEW ME and what I like! Like just for ME. My mouth is drooling over the thought of the lamb because that was my star for the night. And it came with two generous pieces of lamb which was perfect to share between my boo and I. It was sooo tender and moist and juicy. Perfectly cooked. So good that I'm trying to convince my boyfriend how to make a t-bone lamb just like that so he can cook it for me so that I can have it all the time."}, {"review_id": "UOZM5Ihj73_2amBLPHj_YA", "user_id": "gtfmB4IBpZ670wOtMJBA-Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "While in town for vacation, my girlfriends and I had the pleasure of dining at Root Down for Sunday brunch. We made reservations via OpenTable and were seated promptly. Service here was fantastic even considering how busy they were. Food was above average with a nice mix of gluten-free and vegan items available. We thoroughly enjoyed the bottomless mimosas, which are served in 16 oz pint glasses. I was impressed with the fact that someone was walking around with a pitcher filling every one's drink up. I can't tell you how much I drank but I left tipsy and glad we took an Uber here. Even though we enjoyed our time here I will have to admit that I liked Snooze AM better though you cant go wrong with either.* Take note that if you cant make it to this location they have another one at the Denver Airport (Terminal C)"}, {"review_id": "ZN3rqqZEUwBFRodnpFpLGA", "user_id": "hqqqAYlqqTiIlX5MkpM7-w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "I'm a reviewer who places a higher priority on the \"utility\" of things - i.e. how much I enjoy something or its usability vs. its price. Root Down is known to have some of the best brunches in the city. I do agree, it is incredibly delicious and you're near-guaranteed to like what you've ordered. I won't speak to specific dishes, because my tastes vary, but I will say if you close your eyes and shoot in the dark, you'll like what you're going to get.The staff here is incredibly friendly. The Maitre'D went out of his way to find us seating in the bar area to prevent us having to wait - awesome. The bar tender, Michael, was super nice and shakes our hands and introduced himself. The vibe of Root Down does attract the more 'uppety' yuppies, but they're friendly - it is a more upscale brunch spot.Now back to \"utility\". Root Down is expensive. The dishes are expensive (and gourmet) and the drinks are higher priced (and well-made). I'm a bloody mary connoisseur of sorts, and I know I've had equivalently great drinks at other, cheaper restaurants. If you look around the city you'll find some great, albeit more divey, bars with greater value. Root Down is great, yes, but it's also expensive and when compared to other bars in a city with a growing gastro-culture, you can find brunches at a more reasonable price."}, {"review_id": "HSbNScBp9gDayexMu3Ks7Q", "user_id": "eEGoWrI7e94OMJ9Judd90g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "Talk about a place to start your day off right... this restaurant was amazing from start to finish. I visited this spot with a few friends on a road trip, so we would have 100% participated in the bottomless mimosas, but we had to drive and had a long day ahead of us. A LOT of people were enjoying them around us though and those people sitting at the bar with us were getting their refills very quickly. So, money well spent!!Their veggie burger sliders and Chicken and goat cheese biscuit plates were to die for! The interior has the coolest decorations.

And everything else was represented well with the sprouts, hard boiled egg and tomato.  The cheese spread was also tasty.

The ambiance is hip - we sat in the bar area, where there is some interesting art and dark mood lighting. The lamb sliders, which came with sweet potato fries and two different sauces, were REALLY good. I also tried the beet salad, which was good for what it was, but nothing extraordinary. For dessert we decided on the banana creme brûlée pie, which was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I would go back for the dessert alone. All things considered, however, I think the prices are little steep for what you get. We ended up spending $70 (before tip) for 2 sliders, a small salad, 3 drinks (wine/beer) and dessert.

The aesthetics, the seating, the presentation, the service, and of course...the flavors.When a restaurant has almost 3,000 reviews, I don't think there's much new to say so I will just tell you about what I had and hope that you'll order them when you go.I started with a chai latte which was spiced to perfection and so creamy that I finished it in under 5 minutes. Savoring things is not really my game (unfortunately).My friend and I shared the zucchini bread french toast (small order) which we both devoured. The flavors complemented each other very nicely and the mixture of textures between the soft strawberries, spongy french toast, and crunchiness of the pretzel seeds, made for perfect bites every time.Next was the fried chicken and goat cheese biscuit. Now this is an entree. You will eat every bite of this and need a nap afterwards (in the best way). The fried chicken was the exact amount of crispy and juicy. The biscuit is robust and herby-wonderfulness. And obviously the egg is the most beautiful over easy egg anyone has ever seen. (I did get mine without the gravy so I can't comment on that).This is a meal that you want to eat 1,000 times and will never tire of."}, {"review_id": "RIFve9AGIK3aOeYq4iLt9Q", "user_id": "9Jo6yIMtWtPVwgpyRs8F-Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Root Down is a good new american style restaurant in LoHi Denver. It's the lone restaurant in the section of neighborhood yet to be gentrified by all the new residential developments.Ambiance wise, the restaurant uses a renovated car repair shop for it's location and keeps all the alluring aesthetics with it. By the bar, you'll see three garage doors keeping to the old car shop theme. The restaurant is spacious with modern art and design that is really well thought out.We did not have any reservations during our trip here so we ate at the bar. It was a Saturday nighr and the place was packed 15 minutes after openning. The majority of the crowd were reserved guests. The crowd was good and lively. You had a mix of the all girls night out group, a few double dates, and a lot of couple's night out. Also, parking is a hit or miss but try to come ealier to avoid paying for it or walking a good distance in the cold.In terms of the food, we had the diver scallop for appetizer and the roasted chicken and flat iron steak for our main meals. The food was really good. The ingredients were noticeably fresh and the combination of flavors were really unique and delightful. The servings were small though but really high quality.Overall, I give Root Down a good 4.5 (rounded down to 4 because yelp only offers round numbers). The food was amazing, the ambiance was authentic, and the service was sufficient. If you're in Denver looking for a good date or group date spot, I highly recommend this spot."}, {"review_id": "f6O5ZdvnC90j-NlSj9eG7g", "user_id": "jxr8O4H3ivg630bbrix7aQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "This place is amazing. I wish they had one in San Diego. I kind of forgot what I had here since ure been couple weeks but this place didn't disappoint. Eating here felt like eating at a hole in the wall joint. You can't tell from the outside or because it's so hard to find parking, I probably wouldn't have come here but after reading all the previous yelp review, gave this a try and can honestly say, if I'm ever in Denver, I'm def coming back. I think it was a chicken Benedict dish and this French toast that didn't taste like a French toast but was amazing. It's like the slice just melted on my pallet. The veggies on side my dish was just as good. I'm not a big fan of veggies, but they made it so good, you would think it's gourmet veggies. Either way, hands down an amazing place for breakfast and brunch."}, {"review_id": "MGlPdInSujyZ7Z9U0cH_8g", "user_id": "UVKyKuFbM7mrIyw7ACi5ww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "I think this was my favorite restaurant and meal while in the Denver area. I wish we had it back in Cali!AMBIANCE / DRINKSVery eye-catching and vintage-chic! I loved it! A lot of thought went into the decor of this place and it was fun to hang our here and enjoy our meal. We were early for our 8PM reservation so we were escorted to the bar area which had a huge screen showing the Broncos game. The long communal high table was empty so we took a seat at the end there. What high table do you know with chairs that have backs. So comfy and smart!This seemed like the more fun/active side of the restaurant -- the other side was more quiet and proper.After we got our drinks (beer + fizzy tea drink) a booth opened up so we moved over.STAFFI can't remember our server's name but she was great! Very helpful with the menu and helping us choose what to eat. Very genuinely friendly.FOODAs if the ambiance and service weren't good already, the food was even better. On Sundays they have the 3 course pre-fixe menu but that seemed like way to much food. Their menu has lots of delicious and interesting options, it was hard to decide! We started with the colombian arepas which were fantastic, then shared the Rockfish Tom Kha which had so much good flavor! We saved room for dessert and shared the banana creme brulee pie as the suggestion of our waitress. She did not lead us astray. It was divine and rich and so flavorful."}, {"review_id": "HoYFRiLln-BYshfk2I71-A", "user_id": "lwMRSo8NcI49Kuc8wvPIzQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/30/2017", "text": "Favorite meal while visiting Denver, hands down! This spot is a vegetarian delight with 75% of its menu being organically sourced. Sunday brunch is extremely popular here, so calling ahead or making a reservation through their website would be wise. While ordering, I was promised the best veggie burger I'd ever had, and they served me just that. These sliders were hand made, packed with flavor, texture, and satisfaction. The jalapeno jam and dijon were an amusing pair that perfectly complimented the toasty, little buns! Biggest regret, not springing for the bottomless blood orange mimosas. Everyone around me was enjoying them. The brunch menu had lots of fun surprises like almond pancakes, goat cheese biscuits, avocado crab cakes, and zucchini bread French toast! There is certainly something to please everyone!

The bar has tons of booth seating and the decor in there is really fun, vibrant and retro. I enjoyed the roasted beet salad with lox on the side. Really really nice and fresh. The arugula was perfect. The red and golden beets were outstanding. My friend ordered the Masala tofu scramble but with egg instead of tofu. It reminded us both so much of an Indian egg dish our Moms make. It was absolutely divine!Try out their cocktails! I had the Down The Rabbit Hole which was gin, orange juice, lemon, carrot syrup and thyme. It was all things fall! The service was a tad bit slow hence the 4 stars.
