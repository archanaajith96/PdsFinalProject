Being particularly fond of the hamburger, we found a couple of locations that really looked good. In the interest of full disclosure the first place we went to was closed for renovations. I had actually planned on getting a burger at both places so we were going to go to Dotty's anyhow.Dotty's was busy when we arrived and we have about a 20mn wait. Not bad at all and usually a good sign when a place is busy. We had already done our homework and knew what we wanted to order. I ordered the Pub burger with fries, my wife wanted to save herself for a special dinner and only went with the fried pickles. Our order arrived pretty quickly. I hit my burger right away. While my burger was cooked perfectly, the cheese was not melted. Munster cheese is usually a pretty good cheese to use for melting and this was not melted. My burger was supposed to have bacon and I don't recall seeing any bacon. Maybe it was cut up, just didn't stand out. While my burger was good, I felt it was missing some of the fat and goodness that I crave with a burger. The fries were good and I took every opportunity to dip them in what tasted like homemade ranch dipping sauce that came with my wife's fried pickles. The fried pickles by the way were very good. The pickles tasted homemade. They were crispy and the ranch dipping sauce was a perfect compliment. Dotty's has a lot of burgers and I would totally be up for trying some of their other burgers. Dotty's is an old school place and had I gone to school in Madison, I'd be there a few nights a week and on the weekends for a burger and a beer."}, {"review_id": "wa9uehktcKtjXrDjQq8yRQ", "user_id": "QiluSVQ9047oRgrzBMnMNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "Nice atmosphere. Interesting design throughout. Food is very good, very messy, and certainly worth eating.There's a Pokéstop right inside to keep geeks (like me) and kids entertained. Had the curds, the fries, and the vanilla shake alongside my Southwest burger. Be wary of the mustard dipping sauce, it's got kick.Overall I'd recommend it :)"}, {"review_id": "xIK4qUaMDj0cYngezcfBrw", "user_id": "ukAamtYPdnGfmh5Z5uwfZw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "This place is legit!  The burgers are fresh and perfectly grilled.  Add the cheese curds and a selection of their local beer you can't go wrong!   Kayla is a great bartender too!

The burgers have a great reputation, and I wanted to check them out myself.On arrival, the hostess had us seated in a few short minutes, and she, like all the employees we encountered, was very warm and friendly. The decor is jam-packed with whimsical items to keep your eyes from focusing on any one thing. I doubt you'd have a productive working lunch here if your attention span is anything like mine.I ordered the Heart Throb burger, which had a touch of heat to it. The fries were hot and satisfying. The default cook on burgers is medium, which is a welcome change from the norm. Other orders at my table included a build-a-burger, which turned out great.The burger variety, interesting decor, and friendly staff make for a winning combination here.

Our server was friendly with the kids and spoke knowledgeably about the food and beer. Two huge thumbs up for the burgers!

The server also asked on the sly if we wanted the ice cream sandwiches that comes with the kids meals.

Note that everything is a la cart but if you get a basket of jumbo fries ($3.99), you'll have enough for two plus leftovers.Also, if you don't fancy any snazzy toppings, the Build Your Own Burger is a safe and affordable bet for you.The only reason it doesn't have 5 stars in my book is the service can be spotty sometimes. But that's expected when the median age of the servers are in their 20s. Seating can be hard to come by during special sporting events and the wait can be as long as an hour since the place is far from expansive. If you are in a hurry and sport a seat at the bar, grab it and they'll serve you there. I've had some great service from the bartenders.I have a fond memory of my Home Ec teacher reminiscing about the time she worked there. She said everything is made fresh daily, about how the buns and produces are sourced locally.If you're not into beef, they have an \"Adventurous\" menu with veggie patties, chicken sandwiches, and burgers made with bison, lamb, or turkey.Check their website for specials which COMES WITH fries and a fountain drink."}, {"review_id": "qqr9xI0NomspG9pmSKZ5nA", "user_id": "RmKydJuLcw9CE3fZpvfS6g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Fiancée and I have been on a search for some good burgers lately and have been wanting to try Dotty's for a while now.

I am a regular, my partner requests it to be ready at the bus stop whenever she visits Madison. Still one of the three best burgers in Madison, with Brothers Three and Weary Traveler. Very consistent quality, no disappointments with anything I or my companions have ever ordered. I particularly like the Heartthrob, Grand dad, Toadstool, Bison, Bayou, Melting Pot burger. The salmon salad is great. You MUST order the sample basket. You will not get a table on game day.

Disclaimer: there are no dumplings here, but that's alright! They are the number one burger place for many reasons. My personal favorites are the Melting Pot and the Bayou. These perfectly pair with their deep fried cheese curds and their garlic ranch. If you're feeling adventurous, the Bison burger is the way to go! Awesome service, but if you're the impatient kind, give the Poutine a try while waiting. Pro tip: pair your burgers with a Wisco beer!"}, {"review_id": "UUsJu1b6AKxMPiZThqvqWQ", "user_id": "PJhoeUCSSvWEQvv4AqGQgw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/31/2017", "text": "Really good burgers. I had the Green and Gold. The bacon mayo on there was great. Hubby and I shared an order of cheese curds that were tasty. FYI, burgers do not come with fries except for the special. Good craft beer selection, some wines, and the cocktail menu looked good. Not a huge fan of frosty glasses for craft beer, but it wasn't so bad that there was an iceberg floating in my beer or anything. Atmosphere was great. Oldies playing. Singing in the Rain was on the TV. Cool decor.

We had a group of 9 and one burger was completely forgotten. Two burgers were undercooked. A soup never came. When we told our server that the burger was undercook she took it to have it remade. The manager (I'm assuming) brought it back two minutes later with her phone and turned the flashlight on to show us that the cook on the burger was correct. My friend still asked for it to be recooked because she felt that it was under. The entire table felt that it was rude the way the manager approached that situation. In the end, burgers and other items were comped and free pie was given which was nice but it wasn't enough. We will definitely be taking a break from Dotty's after this experience."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/dotty-dumplings-dowry-madison?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
