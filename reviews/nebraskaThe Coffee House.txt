Coffee is reliable and lattes are made with care. Also on the menu: yogurt parfaits, muffins and croissants with goodies like feta/egg/spinach and Gouda/egg/sausage baked into them.If you need a charge, look under the benches on the east wall of the main room or along the walls on the south and west.Front room is south-facing and sunny, furniture is pleasantly worn. A recent redecorating job made the space brighter in an inviting way. Noise levels are moderate and appropriate for the space."}, {"review_id": "gd_x9wMmn0bj9yEeF8a1kA", "user_id": "aQswdhl2IWN9rQCmzm-9pw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "I drove through Lincoln on my way to Denver from Des Moines. We were looking for a coffee shop with some food to get some nourishment on the way. This place delivered!They have fancy fru fru coffee (V60 pour over, Chemex, french press, aeropress, etc.) and that is exactly my jam. I got a V60 pour over, and put a little cream in it. It was delicious and gave me all the life I needed that morning. My partner got a white mocha, and I'm kind of jealous that I didn't get one too, as soon as I tried it.Meanwhile, they also have cromelettes. I'm not sure if this is a thing anywhere else, as I have never heard of them, but oh my goodness, they were SO GOOD. It's like a croissant style sphere thing stuffed with egg and cheese or meat. It was so warm and had some spices on top that just put it all together in the best fashion. Literally my only complaint about this place is that it took us upwards of 2 full minutes to figure out where the door was. (it's inside)"}, {"review_id": "I9dJT4eEdON2lqgYkB40TQ", "user_id": "aDeaGs9UHAlcMQ-uVPD11g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Good place to hangout in downtown for strong roasted coffee.

I needed a coffee place to crash while I was waiting to meet some friends in Lincoln. The Coffee House was the closest option, and I am glad that it was! LOCATION: You see the other side of the shop as you walk up, however, you enter from the side facing Q street, you might be a little confused. Instead of the shop being on the left, it is on the right. (You walk into a hallway that has a Bison Witches on one side and the Coffee House on the other.) It resembles a bar entrance with the neon flashing lights that read \"coffee house\" and snakes in a U around Bison Witches. ORDERING: The shop has a cute little bar with tons of drink options, festive lights, and lots of pastries to choose from. More than that, they have a free pastry with a Yelp check-in !! yay! The guy behind the counter was SO nice and worked with me to find the exact drink I wanted. DRINK: I chose the Foggy Fall, which is spiced orange cinnamon tea, but I added Almond Milk and only wanted 1/4 of the vanilla syrup. I actually really liked it!! It had delicious flavor, not too sweet, and not too spicy! I love the presentation of the cup and the way they wrap the tea bag around a wooden spoon to set atop the glass. They even have cute little tea dishes for you to put your tea bag on when you are finished!FOOD: For the free pasty, I chose the Apple Gouda stuffed roll. The guy behind the counter mentioned wanting to try it, so I gave it to him instead! He said wasn't able to give me a verdict because he was saving it for later. In my opinion, it looked really good!I bought a savory egg, feta, and spinach puff and it was DELICIOUS! 1. It was actually savory. No sweetness here! YES!2. They put spices on the outside AND on the eggs inside.     a. The spices were rosemary, I think basil, and salt and pepper. Not sure all of the others but I loved them!!3. They had more egg than feta cheese. THANK YOU!VENUE: The wooden and marble tables were fairly clean and there was a lot of window light. It was perfect for me to sit down and get some homework done.RESULT: I will be back and I will recommend it!! LOVE! ***The only two downsides are that they do not have prices for anything posted anywhere and they do not have secure wifi. It is fairly cheap but it is weird not knowing how much you are paying. They have free wifi, which is awesome, but it is always better to be on secure wifi!"}, {"review_id": "5JLxdj6yK_lUyLUR_9Jq3A", "user_id": "R1-HeIc5bxIw-gdldyNCAw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I go there to jack off in the bathrooms.

The place has a nice vibe when u walk in.  It has a rustic coffee house feel, not like a chain.  This atmosphere is very welcoming. The set up of the counter isn't the greatest, as it forms a bottleneck to the back room, but overall people were friendly while waiting to get through. There is a back room that is quite and a nice place to study, even though i sat there for a meeting.  My drink was good and the barista was friendly.  Already have plans to go back with a friend soon"}, {"review_id": "c-GJELWI_b2Ldk20R2s5MQ", "user_id": "D9vUisDgRAgyM75aqWBXMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/7/2017", "text": "What a cute, rustic coffeeshop with great coffee and food!Coffee: I ordered the Silky Jazz dark roast, which wasn't as rich and dark as I expected it to be, but still really high quality coffee. I would like to try some of the other roasts, because it is hard to extract the real flavor of the bean in dark roasts. However, dark roasts hold the risk of becoming overly bitter of charred, but this drink had a nice balance of flavor and depth, though it did have a tiny bit of a bitter aftertaste.Food: I ordered the vegan chocolate raspberry muffin and it was delicious. It seemed freshly baked with an amazing texture and flavor. The raspberry filling was also a great complement and tied the whole dish together.Ambiance: This is a great place to study (there's free wifi!) and it's just a quick walk from UNL. It's also very spacious and doesn't seem overly crowded or crammed. Since this was my first time here, I had a bit of trouble trying to find how to get in, but you just go into the outer door that looks like it's for Bison Witches from P St, then enter the inner door on the right.Price: I thought it was quite reasonably priced. My coffee and muffin costed a total of less than $5, so I was quite pleased with that.Overall, an awesome coffeehouse and I plan to come here several more times this summer!"}, {"review_id": "uZ-2bhiOs-5mAulz9V44tw", "user_id": "gt4Rct_VXJG8Q0lvLqAWAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Cozy with awesome coffee!

I got the chai and my partner got a latte. The chai latte was tasty, but not really a typical chai. However the barista did let me know they were out of their usual ingredients and they used an orange spice tea packet and spicy vanilla syrup. I probably wouldn't want it like that again, though I did enjoy it. My partner like his latte. It was well done and they gave us a good amount for both drinks. Their treats looked good too. I was thinking of getting a flourless monster cookie, but it was touching all the other cookies so I decided against it."}, {"review_id": "uDPIyqRWtvNKesty0sc6ag", "user_id": "ouDR5CnFknY-CTTlHtz5gw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/23/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I want to love the coffee house. I do. It's local, the owner seems kind and dedicated, and it's open early. However, it's changed quite a bit from when I last reviewed it in 2015. They used to have discount day-old pastries which was wonderful. Who doesn't appreciate a discounted pastry? The Mill does this. No longer for the CH. They also have breakfast sandwich croissants. These are amazing sandwiches. Truly lovely. The dough is sometimes undercooked inside but they are otherwise awesome. HOWEVER, they have not had them ready the past three times I've visited!!! I work pretty early and don't have the luxury of waiting until 7:30 to get breakfast. Each time I've been in they have told me that their sandwiches won't be ready for another 15-20 minutes. :( If you want me to buy your over priced delicious dough balls of egg and cheese, please have them ready before I need to leave for work! They have also increased their prices quite a bit. It used to be an affordable luxury-coffee and a day old pastry. Now it's a bigger investment, leading to less frequent visits."}, {"review_id": "dH-1FY6ufdxXbWn35rJvVw", "user_id": "4YMxrqTd7_aLYaUztGtGag", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/25/2017", "text": "On a layover in Lincoln I found this great coffee place.
