Solid 4+ stars. It has a traditional Irish pub feel to the place. The only challenge was trying to find a parking spot in downtown Nashua. They have a decent beer selection. The employees were friendly and helpful. I had the Cottage pie. It was savory, filling, and delicious. Similar to Shepherds pie, but made with ground beef. For sure I would order this again. Memorable enough to write a review about. I am told they are well known for their fish and chips as well. Another reason to come back here on my next visit to NH!  Definitely worth a stop for dinner if you are in the area."}, {"review_id": "ZdrFcz_LyeXyQOj5B9A7Qw", "user_id": "3kXn82dO9CQnjuVUWc0eyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/25/2017", "text": "Five stars just for the $3 mimosas and the $4 Bloody Mary! Plus the food and service was great too....... Now onto the review We found this place thanks to my fellow yelpers!  We we're looking for a place for brunch in the Nashua area and stumbled upon this place and the pix and reviews drew us in. First the location is fantastic! I have never really been in Nashua downtown area. What a cool place. Lots of shops and restaurants and the river you can walk along. There was even a random guy playing a piano outside. Very cool. Back to the restaurant.... So this place is located right on the river with a walkway that runs along it. So you can stand and hang out side by the river or they have a few tables right out there too. We ate inside at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and helpful. I of course had to start with the 3 buck mimosa! Duh!!!! And it was a good size too. Not in a skinny fancy pants stupid champagne flute, but a wine glass. And she didn't skimp on the bubbles either. Just how I like it!!  I'll have more please, More! My husband started out with the 4 buck bloody of course. And that too was really good. A good (possibly) homemade mix. Nice bold flavors and a good amount of heat. Not too watery and not too thick either. A+!   They also have a great beer selection On tap and in bottles. Now onto the grub. We started out with the pulled pork poutine, Brunch poutine. Yum! I go for the xtra crispy fries. It had chunks of pulled smoked pork and lots of oouey gooey cheese. I ordered the breakfast quesadilla. This thing was huge and thick! Full of scrambled eggs and cheese and peppers and all kinds of things that make a great breakfast. The star of my dish was the salsa.  Oh. My. Yumminess! It was a sweet and spicy salsa. (I think I took it all in my to go) my quesadilla was so big I had to take it home. Made a great lunch the next day!! I can't recall what the boys had. All I know is that their plates were licked clean! This place would be my \"cheers\" and yes they would know me by name if I lived closer to it. Cheers people!"}, {"review_id": "nZsQR8IO0ImD7Wf5Gzu_dg", "user_id": "vSkeAej_hOWOSueyOyrZeA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Very solid Irish pub.

Solid spot to go on a Friday or Saturday night for drinks in Nashua. The two times that I have been at night they have had a band playing and drinks are very cheap. I went for brunch with some friends and the brunch was one of the best we have ever had. You can't beat $3 Mimosas and $4 Bloody Mary's. We ordered the brunch poutine, breakfast quesadilla, and corn beef hash cakes which all were amazing.

It definitely a cool feel inside with old trinkets around the bar. There are little areas inside where groups can feel more secluded and the whole feel of the bar is comfortable and cozy. The beer list is pretty average but they definitely have Irish beers on tap which is great, since I have been to Irish bars with only Guinness on tap.As for the food- the fried pickles are probably some of the best I have ever had, and I'm from Texas, the land of fried food, so that says a lot. We also tried the onion rings which were very good and the nachos which were on the thin and crispy homemade potato chips (I'm not a homemade chip person so this was just okay to me). This place has homemade mayo, ketchup and tarter sauce- all of which are excellent. The ketchup is exactly as you would expect homemade to be: more vinegar and flavors, way less sugar than the prepackaged stuff. I ordered the Cottage Pie, which was very good and extremely filling. I was starving and barely was able to eat half. It was made fresh and I was satisfied with my order. Several people in our party had the fish and chips and oh my gawd!!! Hands down the best I've ever had! The fish was so juicy and not super greasy and lightly fried so the breading wasn't overwhelming like most places with fried fish do it. The tater tots are crispy and fresh and the sweet potato fries are amazing as well.I am so happy we stopped here (it was a large group of about 10 people with ages from late 20s to 70s). There were food and drink choices for everyone's taste and the atmosphere was perfect as was the waitstaff. I can't say how much more awesome it gets at night, but I'd love to try it next time I'm in town!"}, {"review_id": "s_gmvm5I3NkKj1Oh20bPMA", "user_id": "Q89AJl_ugOzxBzw-aBIJAQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2017", "text": "I really like this place, but I never go much anymore. The food is great, the drinks are great, everything is reasonably priced. The only problem with this pub is that it can be obnoxiously loud at times, ridiculously crowded others, and the cover charges can be extensive. I think I'm just getting too old for bars like this, maybe. I like a quieter atmosphere, which is no fault of this place, but also why you probably won't catch me here anymore."}, {"review_id": "X-72nknYdX-8Rfr0I0pJGg", "user_id": "-CeX3gsXIUnSPfQHi0WfnA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/6/2017", "text": "Went for happy hour....all vodka drinks were half off.

The only problem with this place is the location on main st which makes the parking slim, not a deal breaker just be ready for a slight walk is all. I would definitely recommend this place!!"}, {"review_id": "ytZr_gxx8k3lSyXRaTc-YA", "user_id": "nqF-K5wgQMIo60PMyyBclQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/28/2017", "text": "Fun atmosphere with good food and service.

The beer list is pretty good, especially if you are in to Shipyard (they have an extensive selection of Shipyard beers, along with other drafts local to the NE region).  They drink menu has some fun cocktails as well but they seem to specialize in Svedka flavored vodkas, as this is one of their happy hour specialists during the week and they have lots of flavors to choose from.  The service has always been good, and I've enjoyed my time there so far.  I haven't gone on a weekend day yet, so I'm not able to comment on the live music or Sunday brunch, but the weekday visits have all been good."}, {"review_id": "VMl7ca4vmxO5x1p1TZ-gUQ", "user_id": "EiT_pSuIb08oRn4CfwfMJg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/9/2016", "text": "The Peddler's Daughter is an authentic Irish pub located on Main Street by the riverside. When you enter, it's unclear where the hostess stand is. As you walk further inward, you'll hear traditional Irish music playing in the background of the bar area.For beverages, we got an iced water, an unsweetened iced tea, and two kinds of Guinness - a Blond American Lager and a classic Irish dry stout. I was surprised that the Guinness's weren't served in Guinness glasses.Instead of getting a large entree, I decided to get a bowl of soup and a salad. I originally ordered the Chicken Noodle Soup, which consisted of grilled chicken, noodles, mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers. I didn't expect it to be spicy to the point I couldn't handle it. It was nice that our server was very accommodating and allowed me to switch for Cream of Potato and Leek Soup, which consisted of light seasoning, potato, leeks, onions, celery, chicken stock, whole milk, half and half, butter, and parsley, topped with chopped spring onions. The Cream of Potato and Leek Soup was delicious - rich and creamy but a bit on the heavy side. The Fall Harvest Salad consisted of baby field greens topped with roasted butternut squash, candied walnuts, and dried cranberries lightly tossed in a light maple dressing. I felt like the salad could have more dressing and that the dressing could have had a strong maple flavor. My mom ordered the Peddler's Beer Battered Fish & Chips Served Traditional Style in Newspaper. She couldn't stand the newspaper so after unraveling the fish n' chips, she set aside the newspaper before digging into the dish. The Peddler's Beer Battered Fish & Chips consisted of lightly beer battered fresh large cod filet, split into four pieces. For an additional $1, We substituted the hand-cut french fries for thick sweet potato fries. It was served with homemade ketchup and lemon tartar sauce. The homemade ketchup tasted like there was a hint of Lea and Perrins worcestershire sauce. We liked how the fish was crispy and lightly battered. My father ordered the Cider Braised Chicken Breast, which consisted of tender cut of chicken breast braised in and local apples roasted in Magners Hard Cider, served over whipped sweet potato and butternut squash, and topped with crispy leeks.My brother ordered the Ginger & Honey Grilled Salmon Filet, which consisted of a tender and smooth fillet of salmon, grilled to perfected and finished with fresh ginger and local honey. It was topped with crispy leeks, roasted sweet potato hash, and sautéed fresh vegetables. The crispy leeks added a nice fare to both of the dishes!I'd definitely return to The Peddler's Daughter in the near future!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-peddlers-daughter-nashua?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
