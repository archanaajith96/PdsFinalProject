Middle was sashimi style fish with some bread.  Bottom was good o' shrimp, oysters, and snow crab.  All of which were delicious, and it was just beginning.I got some Portuguese Stew for main entrée, they had these huge clams in there with some large prawns and a variety of seafood in the stew.  Seasoning was well-balanced.  The bread was a little burnt, but they made good use in soaking up the juice in the stew.Without doubt, this was one of the better restaurants in Nashua, I would definitely recommend at least one meal here when visiting the town.  Service was excellent too."}, {"review_id": "AsZlVAVQ09G7dorESqdm_A", "user_id": "UiO_clG4HoC8SPvtV8rV5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "This place is AMAZING in every way.  We went with a party of 4 and we were all blown away.  The selection is overwhelming and we got a little of everything.  We got some oysters (probably the best I've ever had), the lobster nachos, and the crab cake special to start, all delicious.  Then we ordered the red dragon sushi, the mushroom stuffed flounder (recommended by our awesome waitress Juliana), a scallop and pasta special, and the Tuscan seafood pasta. The flounder and scallops were again amazing, the Tuscan pasta not as flavorful but still good.  The drinks were great.  To top if off our waitress was even able to split our bill up between the two couple including splitting the price of the appetizer!  That was impressive.  Over all 5 stars all around from the ambiance to the service to the food!  We will be back!"}, {"review_id": "aqMOeDi2G5XnUa67LfBMsQ", "user_id": "vSkeAej_hOWOSueyOyrZeA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Lovely dining environment for such a big place.

This place came up, and it was quite tasty. Hit all the marks. Good wine list, great music, intimate vibe. The raw bar sampler delicious, and I've found my new oyster. Try the Cotuit. Delicious!!What makes this place a stand out is the vibe. VERY personable staff.  The bartender, Stephanie, was phenomenal. Everyone seemed to love her, from staff to patrons, and she deserved the accolades. Everyone around her was the same. Nothing seemed rushed, but it was still quick. Hard to find good people, and this place has it in spades. I hardly write service reviews, but this place really deserves the hype.  Go here for great food and even better experience."}, {"review_id": "n4lkbUXDcEaINlHZvrtx-g", "user_id": "WtzzRveWusB8iHP_lunysA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/5/2017", "text": "We normally don't drive into Nashua, NH but our friends raved about Surf so much that we had to try it.  So, we met up with a few friends on a Thursday night and was told that reservation wasn't needed and plus they only make one for party of 7 or more.  I do wished they have a parking lot but they did have street-parking and there is a garage one block behind the restaurant.  After parking, there was no wait and we were seated in a cozy table for four; it was tight squeeze because we ended up ordering way too many dishes.  After a round of yummy cocktails, we got three appetizers: Chourico Braised Mussels, Hot Stone Tuna, Parmesan-Fried Calamari.  I love the Hot Stone Tuna presentation.  It was served on an actual hot stone and the tuna cooked on top of it.  It was a fun way to eat dinner.  I love mussels and getting the Chourico Braised Mussels and dipping the toasted bread in its sauce hits the yummy spot!  The Parmesan Calamari was good too but it wasn't my favorite among the three dishes.  Next we ordered Baked New England Seafood Trio, Sauteed Sea Scallops, Crispy Garlic & Tuna Maki, Spicy Salmon Maki.  All these dishes was so good.  The scallops in both dishes were cooked perfectly.  My GF isn't a big raw fish fan but she found both maki rolls quite yummy.  And the BF raved about the Crispy Garlic & Tuna Maki and wished he ordered more.  Next time, we'll have to try their other maki rolls.TIP: sign up for their rewards program.  Each dollar spent at the restaurant and partner businesses will give you 1 point.  After you build enough points, you'll get a $10 gift certificate toward your next visit."}, {"review_id": "C2ZjnaJHvp6XHKoDWuksWw", "user_id": "LrUtumme-1nvWvW6qmQblw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "We live locally so when we want to stay close to home and have great seafood, we go to Surf.

This was fortuitous as the restaurant was packed.Menu selections favored New England style seafood, but there were some interesting looking fusion approaches, mostly Asian in influence.  We chose two daily specials - we split an order of tempura shrimp with a Korean-ish barbecue sauce and kimchi-ish cucumbers, and we each ordered blackened redfish with a shrimp-topped polenta swimming in a Cajun sauce. My wife (from Massachusetts) and I (from South Carolina) now live in Northern Virginia and have virtually every flavor of ethnic food available.  We were very pleased to find that Surf's kitchen sent out excellent food.  Our shrimp were fried perfectly - the tempura was crisp, and the shrimp inside still moist, tender and tasty.  The sauce and faux kimchi were spot on, complementing and not overwhelming the other flavors. I've lived in Louisiana and was anxious about the redfish, but the blackening seasoning was delicious - not a one-note seasoning you find some places - and the fish was cooked to perfection. The tiny shrimp and polenta serving bed and Cajun sauce were equally scrumptious. I ate every single generously-portioned bite and each was delicious.The others in our party agreed that their food also was superb - dishes ranged from a really good-looking burger, fish tacos filled with fried haddock, to a traditional New England baked haddock, scallops and shrimp dish.  Mixed drinks were equally interesting, and the wine list was reasonably priced (if there is such a thing despite restaurant mark-ups). The desserts looked delicious but nether my wife nor I tried them out - but there were no crumbs on the plates of those who ordered from the sweet-looking sweets display.The staff were very accommodating and attentive, the manager stopped by to make sure we were pleased with the overall experience, and altogether it made for a memorable evening.

Both times I have been I've had to wait over and hour for seating and I've seen people decide to wait as long as an hour and a half to two hours. The food makes it worth the wait. Their clam chowder is buttery and creamy and is by far the best I have ever had. I usually get their baked scallops. Their baked scallops are huge! Well worth what you pay for. The quality of the food is what your paying for and it is worth every cent. The wait times are the only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars. If your in Nashua and looking for a great place to eat then go to Surf.Update 5/20/17I went back with 3 of my friends last night around 5 pm and I didn't have a wait time. I think the night I went just must have been a busy time. Once again the food was excellent and the service was fantastic. My friends were very please with the food and could not stop talking about the food after we left.

Im finding it extremely difficult to appropriately articulate how amazing my experience was! Our server Lori was fantastic from the start. She was very warm and genuine, and gave great suggestions with the menu. I got a spicy Manhattan-bourbon, jalapeño simple syrup, maple, and chocolate bitters. So unique, and oh so tasty! My Girlfriend got a brew from Newberry Port, that also hit the spot. They had a maki special that consisted of grilled scallion, cucumber, avocado, tuna and eel sauce-it was out of this world! We then had our mouth watering fried tomato, bacon salad. Such a simple concept, that was executed wonderfully. The tomato was fried to absolute perfection, and so sweet. We moved on to another maki roll that was avocado, pineapple jalapeño smash, topped with a fried oyster and cilantro micro greens...INCREDIBLE! We then split a warm blueberry crumble, and cappuccino. We only wanted one capp, and Lori brought it to us split (she also did this with our salad because she is awesome!) everything from start to finish was just so on point. You obliviously want your food to be good when you go out to eat, but when when you get top notch service in edition to incredible food, well thats what its all about. I cant wait to to come back to Nashua just so we can return to surf and kindly request Lori! If you find yourself in this lovely city, be smart and make this your dining destination. You will be so happy with your choice. Thank you so much for such and awesome experience! -outdoor seating in front of the restaurant-casual ambience-carefully made cocktails -the FRESHEST sushi - the manager was very present, and  helpful to staff- Did i mention what a joy **Lori** was?!** Also worth mentioning they have another restaurant across the street. I would confidently assumed it is fantastic as well. Lori also works there ;)**"}, {"review_id": "0vKjTkp6oDJKBT6UqKntoQ", "user_id": "vIqv6Ocqb3j5QGF8TsZnEQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "9/16/2017", "text": "Just AverageI was expecting a great dining experience for $50 per person.  In the end it was nothing special at half that price.   I have no problems with the $50 per person - I just expect a great meal and great service at that price.There were 3 of us at the table.   Service was ample and attentive - no issues.   For the appetizers - we had 2 bowls of the smoked haddock chowder and an order of spring rolls.   The smoked haddock was really lame, not much smoke and the chowder was very basic - no flavor layers here.   The Spring Rolls were good.For the entrees - One plate of the massive seafood dinner - all fried.  An order of blackened haddock tacos, and another plate of something I can't remember.   The seafood plate was $39 and hardly worth the money.   Taste was great, especially the calamari,  however the meal was 60% french fries.  Again - a terrible value for a plate of fries with some seafood on it.   The Blackened Haddock tacos were interesting.   The construction was wrong.  The fish goes on the bottom with the garnishes on top.   The fish was really soggy and the blackening spices were really basic - not a lot of flavor nor much heat.   The garnishes were good - however due to the construction of the taco - you had your choice of bites - fish or garnishes.Deserts - looked good but passed.Net - not worth the price.   Many other choices with more memorable food at a lower price point.  I was disappointed."}, {"review_id": "Ia3Gb_eirSOVg4wZ3D7PIA", "user_id": "nhWhf-xOJZvHy7UZx9NPMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/24/2017", "text": "Never any issues and the food is fabulous.
