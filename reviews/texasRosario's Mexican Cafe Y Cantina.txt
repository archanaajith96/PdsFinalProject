Note 1 if you are in River Walk, don't drive or take taxi during the rush hour.  It took us forever to go less than 2 miles. Receptionist was not very attentive and atmosphere is more like cafeteria like but food is legit! Everything is made in house. Portion wasn't big but maybe for some? :) Alexander was our server. Very knowledgeable and attentive. Oh and if you are FLAN lover... must try and ask for regular. It's not on the menu so you have to ask!"}, {"review_id": "RpJNGxIeK2BeHpyPHOLSqw", "user_id": "tGgT9oxuMarUYXz4qqKZGQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "I typically love Rosario's, or at least the main downtown location.  The San Antonio airport location is not good!Today we came with a group of 8.  The chips and salsa were fresh and the salsa was spicy with a kick, sooooo good!We had 2 children with us and when they ordered kid's meals the waiter actually interrogated them on their ages, WTF!  I heard him do this at another table as well, so weird!  I have never had a server at any restaurant do this.I ordered the shrimp tacos.  They are small and there is not much shrimp or avocado. The slaw had too much cilantro, but everything was fresh and the cabbage was good. The tortillas are awesome. Too bad they don't use those at the airport location.The rice was perfectly cooked and served fresh and steamy.Although this wasn't the best visit we will be back because of previous visits."}, {"review_id": "l7ysrI68tHjFcwP3NOlFjg", "user_id": "clLXGPY3c_--AVhnEXl0Ew", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I never had authentic Mexican food before this place! I must say, this was one of the top food places I went to during my short stay in San Antonio. Fast & friendly service, reasonably priced & great food. The restaurant is huge; plenty of tables and seats than the eye can see. They will seat you once everyone in your party has arrived. There is this volumetric flask- like glass container at the center of each table filled with homemade salsa (spicy) that accompanies with the fresh tortillas they refill you. I ordered the spinach enchiladas which was A-MAZING! The creamy sauce covering the enchiladas was perfect to mix with the rice. For dessert, I ordered the coconut flan. It tasted like  any regular flan, no real coconut flavor only on the whipped cream sprinkled with coconut flakes. I did have a piece of the churros which were delicious. I would have enjoyed that over the flan."}, {"review_id": "z0q-nas9A8wxq_sho8w0Xw", "user_id": "nTMDc79EKMPa8lK79qg88g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "love me some good tex mex.  this far into texas there is no excuse not to partake.  rosarios came highly recommended and i was not disappointed!stuff tried:queso dip: velvety and lovely, i would dip shoe leather in here and it would still be tasty.  lengua plate: nice tender tongue meat! sounds funky but really its not. if you like short rib flavor you will like lengua!tripa on sizzling plate: okay, so eating essentially the poop shoot is not for everybody.  the version here is done right.  nice and crispy so you dont get that back end after tastestaff was really nice and place has relaxed vibe.  great place to check out!"}, {"review_id": "fgyHiacxjes4xPallpVGEw", "user_id": "FMKL435snsX-9BF_DZ31gQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Arrived in SAT and pulled up Yelp for the best Tex-Mex restaurant, great reviews and this place did not disappoint.

Margaritas Lover's Heaven: over twenty margaritas flavors to try.  2. Wallet Friendly: everything is less than $15, most entree dishes are less than $103. Happy stomach & heart: no wonder locals love here, food is so yummy & service is superbHere is a list I tried on my first visit: Free chip & smoked salsa is so good. I can't stop eating it. El Tamarindo~ Margarita with Pineapple juice, so good.  Fresh squeezed lime margarita also delicious and goes down too fast ;) Sopa de Tortilla ~ Rich flavorful chicken broth & crispy fried tortilla chips.  Undercurrent of lime.  Perfect comboTacos Nortenos~ with beef is awesome. It's very similar to cheese Quesadilla. Super fresh guacamole.   Lengua~ tender beef tongue (very soft) in tomato sauce. It's a very interesting dish. Definitely good to try if you are an adventurous person and like soft beef. Fish Ceviche ~ it was ok, just because I like shrimp ceviche better. Small was a lot- even for two people. Coconut Flan ~ Oh yes, I did it!!! Despite being stuffed, I decided to order dessert.  It made with coconut milk , omg deliciousLove this neighborhood. It's got many local favorite restaurants all in one block. Definitely good place to eat if you run out of restaurants or empty your wallet after many expensive Riverwalk restaurants."}, {"review_id": "vV1_SpYUqApRfUSzfZfmog", "user_id": "MyQnkCarWIq1jxL8PVuNZg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "I've been in San Antonio for two days and I've eaten here twice!

Their menu is vast and you can find pretty much any menu option available for Tex-Mex including options for Heath conscious, gluten free, and vegetarian customers.Their homemade hot salsa is fresh and comes in what can only be described as a salsa bong which is incredibly memorable.The garden slaw was rather refreshing and paired nicely to the sautéed jalapeño which set my mouth afire and made me cry!Now the bad: the chips are almost like slightly heated supermarket Tostitos chips, not freshly homemade baked tortilla chips that are more crunchy and savory.I ordered the enchiladas Mexicans and the insides were pretty light on the cheese -- didn't even taste it! I was however able to taste the somewhat semi-sweet sauce.All in all, there is nothing wrong with Rosario's , but don't kid yourself in thinking this is the best Tex-Mex that the world has to offer let alone in Texas."}, {"review_id": "Cn3PTdgDYwEmlc5Erd1cog", "user_id": "R8sHBNWREzNUZys0NFFq6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "This was my first stop in San Antonio and it did not dissapoint.

Seriously, this was one of the better Mexi meals I've ever had. We had a long walk from the hotel (and my co-workers mostly bitched about it), I like to walk... We got there and there was about a 25 minute wait on a Thursday night. So we posted up in the bar and had a drink.Before I get to the food, I will say, their cocktails are super legit! My first drink was a swirl margarita, second was a grilled jalapeno pineapple margarita, and third was their bloody mary. All were great, but that grilled jalapeno pineapple margarita was off the hook.I ordered the combo fajitas and an a la carte enchilada. The food was superb, the tortillas fresh and homemade - the meats were outstanding - the enchilada was great and so much better than our typical California sauce. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals, and forgot about the long walk back...4.75 stars!"}, {"review_id": "K1Uh3IJKyrpBy0YEyZ17Mw", "user_id": "f5FDj58CPJE8xOAj31_EVw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "Looking for some great Mexican food on New Years Eve and stumbled upon this place! We were able to check in on Yelp which saved us a lot of time. The parking lot is very small but thankfully we were able to find something rather quickly.Upon entering I noticed the decorations which was really great. Some of the staff had on NYE hats and had beads which was as cute. We waited about 5 minutes before being taken back to the back end of the restaurant which is where they seat the larger parties. (We are usually a party of 5) It took a while for our server to approach us but it was a holiday and very busy so I can see why. We didn't get chips and salsa at first but after about 10 minutes we finally got them and I was so happy cause we we were all very hungry!I have to say the salsa was very good. I'm always on the prowl for some good salsa so that made my day. I ordered the enchiladas and my bf ordered the shrimp nachos along with the chipotle chicken quesadillas. I have to say the quesadilla was one of the most flavorful I've had in a long time. The chicken was cooked perfectly and I was so jealous I hadn't ordered that! The enchiladas were pretty good. My kids enjoyed the rice and beans and it's surely not easy to please them since they're used to their grandmas so that was a plus.Only negative thing I have to say is that I server was not at all friendly and sometimes came off as rude. I loved the food but sometimes when you leave a restaurant feeling like it was just okay because of a server it really takes away from the whole experience."}, {"review_id": "3NO0gUVr4_YM8etQKjhVFg", "user_id": "ONVi0ZNLMoOKSS2oSmKKiA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Another great meal.

The river walk, and downtown are overrun with tourist traps, but Rosario's is one for good reason. Good Tex Mex. the margaritas are fresh & boozy, and you can get normal sized one or Texas sized giant fishbowl ones lol. I love coming here while drinking my way through Southtown or if I'm in the downtown area. For this particular trip I tried the handshaken margarita on the rocks first. Delicious fresh lime juice margarita. I moved on to the frozen mango with chamoy and a tajin rim. Sooooo good! For food, we shared the ceviche and guac. Both good. I prefer my ceviche more citrusy but that's just a personal preference. Service was friendly and quick, especially considering it was first Friday. Overall a great spot to visit. I'm looking forward to coming back to check out their happy hour"}, {"review_id": "hlsvaiUBmoGjluNX9Y08Mg", "user_id": "ChS8cPX5YyTE_qVgXXMn5Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "A new friend suggested this place. She said it was one of her favorites, and I can see why. The host staff was warm and welcoming. The restaurant covers a lot of space so there is a great amount of seating. All size tables, perfect for 2 or 10+!We were seated and both given water, chips, and salsa very quickly. I loved the salsa! The salsa was spicey (but not too hot) and full of flavor. It tasted freshly made and the chips were fantastic. Our water glasses were never fully empty.The menu has a ton of options! It took me 10 minutes to decide because everything looked good! My friend commented that she always gets the shrimp fajitas because she loves them so much. When her food came, I could smell why she always ordered the same thing. Not only does the menu have a great variety, the prices are fantastic!I ordered the crispy beef tacos. My meal was very good, but a little messy. The taco shells fell apart halfway through each taco, so I ended up using my fork for half of the meal. But, it's ok. Because it was so dang good. Full of flavor, everything was fresh (even the tomatoes), and very filling. Our waiter was attentive and friendly. I highly, highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal in the area for a very reasonable price. I told my husband how much I enjoyed it.
