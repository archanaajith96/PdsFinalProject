Anyone that disagrees hasn't had real Texas BBQ (puts all other types of BBQ to shame).The brisket & pulled pork are to die for. So great you don't even need sauce or bread; just meat smoked to perfection. I also love the unlimited toppings bar in the dining room! My one and only complaint is regarding their coleslaw. The original vinegar base was so much better than the cream base they changed to a few months ago. I would LOVE to see them bring it back!Pro Tip #1 : make sure to call before driving there as some days they sell out within an hour of opening! Pro tip #2 : they do discontinue their dinner service during off season (winter months), so it is only 11AM - sold outPro tip #3 : get the moist brisket. you're welcome."}, {"review_id": "84UsRqvvo_IqAFFDeL3X1g", "user_id": "4FB2f8POYPlv-eezUWQZIA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "First off all the only reason this does not have five stars is that they always seem to run out of the good stuff. Now don't take that the wrong way, it's just so popular that if you are late on the draw you will left out. Sampling food is the best here, burnt ends are devastatingly tasty. They melt in your mouth. The brisket is unparalleled. The mustard bbq sauce is second to only one homemade one I've had in the past. This is the best bbq you will find in Springfield. Disregard the thought of even looking elsewhere, if you want bbq this is it!"}, {"review_id": "L5CLg9y47gHoGMjIlTh1qQ", "user_id": "lZbotco47bHU7oE5b3d1DA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Back again as this is marvelous BBQ! !Both my wife and I had burnt end sandwiches.

I did switch up the sausages.  Andouille is where it's at!  Everything was great, but what really makes the sandwich pop is the pork belly.  Man, it's so good!  Most smoke houses don't offer it as a daily item, but CB does it EVERY DAY.  I'm pretty sure that both sandwiches have taken extensive time off my life.  YOLO, my Yeeps!The only drawback for me is the sides, which are limited to non-fried items.  I've never been a bean guy, and I can be a little picky with my sides.  Maybe that's my fault!  However, I got chips with both meals.  Honestly, the sandwich is more than enough, twelve dollars and well worth it.Where was City Butcher when I lived there?  It breaks my heart.  Nevertheless, I will now work it into every trip down there.  It's that good, folks!"}, {"review_id": "4OrWUaiqsK2zpoI0-ME6rw", "user_id": "hpgeh8EYX1i4QTpvE4Fq-g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Good food and easy casual atmosphere.

I got there late, they were #SoldOut of a lot, what I did get was FANTASTIC! I'll be back... on time! I found out about City Butcher from a physician in the Springfield area. It was a glowing review. He even told me that I needed to get there by 11am or they would be sold out of their top selling burnt ends. I was traveling from out of town and wasn't able to arrive until 2pm.City Butcher is located in a strip mall. The exterior, upon arrival, appears to be a very modern upscale eatery. When you enter the building the mood changed to a very cool \"rustic modern\" decor. When I first entered, I noticed the large trough in the middle of the floor which houses the large variety of drinks and craft soda. The next focal point is the menu board that hangs high and, at the late lunch hour, was covered in their infamous Sold Out signs. Below the menu is an area for the merchandise that they sale. You will also notice the cooler that houses the cold sides and the large butcher's block/ sales counter. The decor is very simple but very intentional to the feel that they are going for. So, when I arrived most of the meats were sold out. All they had left was brisket and turkey. I ordered a half pound of the brisket, especially because the focus is on Texas style BBQ where beef is king. The menu does include a great selection of meats including: burnt ends, pork belly and house made sausages. They also have typical sides like slaw, potato salad and bbq beans in addition to several others. I did not get sides on this trip, which gives me more of an excuse to go back. I love that they pack your meat in butcher's paper, which only adds to the rustic feel of this place. As I ordered my food I has the chance to speak with the owners who were very friendly and passionate about the quality of their product. As they sliced me what was described as a premium portion of brisket. The brisket that I ordered was fantastic! When I unwrapped the butcher's paper it revealed these beautifully sliced portions of glistening brisket. The dark exterior of charred black pepper and salt revealed a delicious smoky and deep pepper aroma. A knife was not needed for the brisket as a plastic fork sliced through it like butter. The flavor was on par with some of the great bbq that I've had in Texas. The notes were simple, beef and black pepper, but profound. I personally enjoy the fatty pieces of meat and this was the perfect portion, with a layer of melting fat at the top and a perfectly tender layer of meat below.My short experience here was a good one and the food is fantastic. As mentioned earlier, get there early if you want to ensure that you have a full selection of meat. Upon speaking with the owners I was made aware of the fact that you can call in between 5 and 10am to order your meat for same day pick up. Also, if you miss lunch, you can always go back and go for dinner service that begins at 5pm and ends when they are sold out."}, {"review_id": "dtT_pdRO-6l1p4m3NCIChQ", "user_id": "NjNLutg-V9livkN5Q2ltqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Great food and experience today.

If u r from or not from Springfield, this is a must when you are in the Ozark area. Do you know what I love about the Midwest? They know how to smoke some damn good BBQ and this place is top of the top with locally sourced meats. It was featured as one of the best restaurants in Feast by critics and locals.So - it's BBQ and nothing fancy. You also need to come on the early side b/c stuff does run out. And b/c I love my STL BBQ, this is more Texas based (so no sauce really, but the meat is def. not dry here). The Things to DO:1) Brisket2) Smoked Turkey/pork on a sandwich together is the bomb (The Pig Bird sandwich). And I normally don't or try to avoid pork, but hell no here.3) Burnt endsThe Meh:1) Potato Salads. I don't understand why the midwest doesn't make their Potato Salad w/vinegar. Clearly, my Boston roots are showing. Top place. Good stuff. Nice people.

I arrived around 4pm so by that time they were out of the majority of the meats available for the day. I settled on a pulled pork sandwich with a small side order of baked beans. The pulled pork sandwich was tender and the bun was nice and soft. When I tasted the baked beans they weren't quite what I expected, the baked beans kinda reminded me of a hearty bean stew. The bbq sauces complimented my sandwich but didn't \"wow\" me. Overall, I would say that this barbecue restaurant is in the middle of the pack based off of my personal barbecue dining experiences.
