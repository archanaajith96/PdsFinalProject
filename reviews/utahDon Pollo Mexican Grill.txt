We picked up some chips and salsa. The chicken and pork tamales tasted great. I would suggest adding a bit more \"real\" chicken. The chips almost melt in your mouth. The salsas were great too. We were treaded in a very nice way .It is a drive out there but worth it. Got a dozen chicken and a dozen pork. Just got back and I'm exhausted. This place has proved to be the best. Chips and salsa ar free with purchase!!"}, {"review_id": "E2NxYvqQSocbygyGlaz06Q", "user_id": "WyapEmwAEXOx6DyEtpnKng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "I'm always hesitant to give a place 5 stars. To me it really means something more than that they were good. It means they are special.This place is special. Their chicken is absolutely fantastic, both in the way it is seasoned and the way it is cooked. There is a wonderfully perfect char that along with their excellent seasoning (not too much, not too little) makes this some of the best grilled chicken I've had.The tacos are served with just the meat on the tortillas, there are some grilled onions on the plate that can be added and there raw onion and cilantro, lime and salsa is available at the self-serve salsa bar.On the salsa bar they have a avocado salsa, a red salsa and a dark red roasted salsa. They also have complimentary tortilla chips which I'm willing to assume they make in-house. These are authentic thick chips that were made from, wait for it... tortillas. There is also pickled carrots and jalapeno, there version didn't seem to have any onions and the jalapenos were thinly sliced.So the food is amazing. They pretty much get 5 stars right there. The friendly personable service, the way they make you feel welcome, that is seems that they are enjoying providing you with great food, well, that puts them over the top!"}, {"review_id": "lW_NsTWVqjjs9F2iberjWQ", "user_id": "a8_eEheDanfddPSOEGNLgw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Decided to give this a try after looking for a restaurant that I could not find back home. The burrito is amazing, simple yet abosutley filling.Price was fair, under $10 bucks for a dinner. I'm glad Yelp recommend this place within the first 10 searches because this was a unique dinner and one I look forward to repeating if I'm ever back in Salt Lake City."}, {"review_id": "i1FrZOCZjZckbE3a13wAyA", "user_id": "KdjzmUPdIgcO3Z3hnixlcg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Do you love cheap street tacos like me? Then look no further than Don Pollo. A cool $1.50 per taco which is the same as you'll find anywhere else but throw in actual seating and bottomless chips and a salsa bar. Talk about a deal! The salsa bar was truly the highlight as they had some very good salsas and like I said bottomless chips and I mean bottomless chips... people were filling up grocery bags with chips to take home. Everything is in English and Spanish so if you don't habla el español, you'll be totally fine. I'd advise you to stick with the tacos. Try the radioactive green looking salsa. And avoid the burrito as it's just average. Buen provecho!"}, {"review_id": "Sxg5nBn3qkDyTmDRc5Ihbg", "user_id": "cPyurS8iassF_9iSeFtKhg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "The Tortas are delicious!

Amazing grilled chicken super flavorful and tender juicy meat. Not greasy! Huge chicken & cheese quesadilla! I only ate 1/2 and will save the rest for lunch tomorrow. Yummy rice. Hot fresh cut fries with fry sauce. The place is divey with lots of local Mexicans. This is a good place for a quick bite for lunch or dinner not for a special occasion. You can dress down and be real casual. You get a ton of food for the price."}, {"review_id": "pyfOSKnZFQBmQIqMtHokJw", "user_id": "tAa8pqbeg3fT44XJfVO0vg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "Decided to come here with my family after seeing all the good reviews on yelp. Every single 5 star rating this place has it deserves. They had a special going on that included a whole chicken, rice, beans, pasta salad, 5 al pastor tacos, 6 tamales, and one drink for 40 bucks. We had so much food and had a ton of leftovers for a fantastic price.While you wait for your order they have complimentary seasoned tortilla chips and a salsa bar. Who else does that?The chicken was perfectly seasoned and super juicy. I liked the sides too i thought the rice was tasty and the beans are just cooked pinto beans which I actually prefer over refried. The al pastor tacos were some of the best I've had in Utah. I'll be back for those tacos alone. The tamales were also tasty they have corn, chicken, and pork to choose from and they were all pretty good. The only thing not all of us agreed on was the pasta salad which my family said tasted store bought.I would also recommend ordering the pineapple juice with your meal, it was refreshing and not overly sweet. Refills are only $1.Skip Pollo Loco, Chipotle, or any other restaurant that claims to serve good grilled chicken, or authentic Mexican food, and come here and bring joy to your taste buds."}, {"review_id": "feZ-_ri-FzQU2hZl8l4HKQ", "user_id": "bOl7m4puZIXTL5E-Z4ReBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "I'm so glad I've found this place. I would be willing to drive here any time for really great chicken tacos. This place is hidden behind a racheritos next to a dollar store. It's really great Mexican food and the people there...friendly as can be. If you have a hard time to decide or anything...they will help and be the friendly people they are. When you first walk in, you get hit with the strongest grilled chicken smell. They freshly grill their chicken in front of you on a daily basis. You then notice the counter where you go and order your food. One of the great thing about this place is that they have a salsa bar that's an all you can eat. They will give you a container for the chips and then you go and fill the salsas you want. Their salsas do have a heat to it, just like how salsa should be.I ordered the 4 chicken tacos combo. The tacos was a really decent size and 4 of them was enough for me. The chicken was tender and flavorful, with the green salsa added to it makes it the perfect spicy chicken tacos. The thing that made me know this was very authentic was the side of grilled jalapeño with onions. You don't get this at the Americanized ones. My food came with a drink and I got the Jamaica. It's a red flower sweet tea that is amazing. Totally recommend. I can keep going on about how great this place is, but you'll just need to go check it out yourself."}, {"review_id": "2EvGajS0AEDisFL0JFT7dg", "user_id": "sTq4dfDJ1-WOk6tIT8GB6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "The best mexican food the chicken The tacos al pastor And the free salsa bar can't complain they deserve 5-stars Plus"}, {"review_id": "CCQ-B-wwGzoFgBl_k6BT9w", "user_id": "YDkPnoetCBYvrmAwvVgU1w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Chips and salsa is included.

I wanted some good cheap Mexican food and saw 5 stars for this place so decided to drive 20 minutes to try it. I am super excited that we did. We lived in San Diego for 15 years where great Mexican food was everywhere and Don Pollos is better than anything we ate in SoCal. Plus the cleanliness and service is better than anything you would expect. The place doesn't look like much from the outside. I think it's next to a dollar store and located in a nondescript strip mall. But OMG the food is amazing. While we were waiting for our food we got the complimentary chips and salsa and the chips were outstanding. I don't know what they do but it tastes fresh and crispy without being too greasy. I got the chicken and Hubby got the carne asada burrito. The carne asada is terrific. It's a nice touch theatre they grill the tortilla so it has a great smoky flavor. The chicken is so tender and tasty, not dry and chewy like most places. Everything is phenomenal here!"}, {"review_id": "g0iLnBVD1XvVylS6jghGrA", "user_id": "68Yl7CMT9QrQUxsD8uFQ-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "This spot is more like a dive but the food that is being g served here is crazy good.

I closed my eyes the first time I took a bite and just appreciated the moment that the chorizo hit my tongue with the perfectly crispy tortilla they had melted cheese and the perfect amount of rice and beans. I've tried other places and what I have found is that I can't even taste the meat because all I taste is the beans. Obviously, that would be very disappointing. Don Pollo is a hidden treasure that hardly looks authentic on the outside. It's located in a plaza next to McDonald's. They have fresh salsa, freshly made chips and delicious grilled onions. The horchata is not watered down but also not gritty so in other words, it's perfect. I defiantly plan on being a regular here. Staff were also friendly.
