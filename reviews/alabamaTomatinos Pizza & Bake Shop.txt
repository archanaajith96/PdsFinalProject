The rest of us are not from here.The dough: original, and just good! Toppings: Do NOT suck!Seasonings: 5 StarService: The food alone ranks a 5 star. The service is super worthy of extra credit!The salads, cheese sticks, and pizzas (popular orders  in our group were the Margarita & Meat Supreme) were all worthy from the voices of 4-5 stars.Match that with 6 Star service, and you can't loose  here!"}, {"review_id": "5i3ixzAbUWix3ULj6a_9Cg", "user_id": "dIWD89dHoC_rmnjNw5m3eQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "This is an eclectic little pizza joint that is a lot of fun. One side of the restaurant is mostly tables and the other side actually has a bar that serves coffee and gelato. There is plenty of seating but it fills up fast. We went twice and both times the staff were very helpful and had a great attitude.  The first time we went there were three of us and the second time, close to 14. Both times our servers were amazing! We ordered many different types of pizzas and all were very good. They also have a good selection of beer and wine. And finally we finished up with a good dessert of tiramisu. This is a must for anyone visiting Montgomery and needing to get their pizza fix."}, {"review_id": "0TxyXisuWtylT7gel7ol8w", "user_id": "9hZZrIKtFY1y2UcWa-dEmQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Their food is great; however, good service starts at the top down, and this place clearly does not emphasize service. Very disorganized staff scheduling, seating, and flow of to-go orders. I frequently place to-go orders that are not ready until 10-15 minutes after the quoted time. In addition, they do not abide by their posted hours and will frequently close up shop and leave early with no notification, which can be especially frustrating if you were counting on getting a late dinner there."}, {"review_id": "YchMWkE3OzTav114I8tqkw", "user_id": "tere929rRn8ZyGwY-1TuDg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/30/2017", "text": "After reading some reviews and hearing about how good the pizza was here, I decided stop in and give it a try. The reviews were not wrong. The pizza was amazing and it is arguably some of the best pizza you will find I'm Montgomery. The service was very friendly, but very slow.  The restaurant seemed fairly busy for a Thursday night and the server and kitchen staff were trying their hardest to keep up with the orders.  I am not sure what an average night looks like here, but for the small size it seemed very busy. Overall I enjoyed the food, but the restaurant could benefit from expanding or maybe employing more staff on busier nights. I would definitely come here again for carry out."}, {"review_id": "xJf-1gIpPxt4WMk3CpXA0A", "user_id": "lxuqpIiRM48U61cLuUQ7Zw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/30/2017", "text": "I stopped in here on a Thursday night STARVING!  For starters this place is in a sort of gentrified neighborhood with lots of cute surrounding restaurants.  Upon entering the pizzeria you can say that it is quite crammed, I wouldn't recommend coming in groups larger than 4.  Also there is one server, one cook, and a cashier.  Although, the service can be a little slow the food is on par.To start we ordered cheese sticks for the table.  Now originally I thought these would be mozzarella sticks but I was pleasantly surprised that it was actually delicious cheesey bread.  As for the table we all ordered small specialty pizzas.  Pro tip: the small pizza is definitely enough for 1-2 hungry people.My friend ordered the meat pizza which I favored most.  It had a generous amount of sausage, pepperoni, Canadian bacon, etc.  Basically all of the best pizza meats.  The flavors just kinda went WOW in your mouth.I ordered the Sicilian, it had meatballs, caramelized onions, sun-dried tomatoes, and goat cheese.  This in my opinion came in second place in the pizzas we ordered for the night.  I think that the caramelized onions and sun-dried tomatoes kind of made my toppings soggy :(  Other then the sogginess my pizza was very flavorful and delicious.Last but not least my other friend ordered the funky chicken.  This one had pesto sauce on it, and all of the flavors really came together.  None of us hated it but I think we all wished we ordered the meat pizza.  Overall, I gave this place a 4 out of 5 stars because the food was so damn good!  However, I think that they could benefit from a larger venue with more employees to kind of streamline everyones visit."}, {"review_id": "0VhF-XCHYK_GhHz7ywoRfQ", "user_id": "tjGVkiDzO7pkp_aiKgnJyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "My favorite pizza place in Montgomery! Delicious cheese sticks, the salads were fresh, and their homemade ranch was awesome! We got the margherita pizza and the Sicilian and both were delicious (the sicilian especially)! The iced coffee at the attached coffee shop was amazing as well and so were the cheesecakes! Service was great and the servers were friendly. We sat outside after dinner and drank more coffee and enjoyed the lovely weather!

My only issue is their customer service....i am big on customer service. One time I went after I had ordered on the phone.... got there and the order had not even went in cause the girl didnt know how to input it in the system and had just wrote it down and never told anyone. Waited over 40 mins for a calzone! Unacceptable. Then when i tried to check on the status of my food 1 of the girls barely acknowledged me. Asked if i was waiting on a order...I asked if she could check on it and she walked off to serve guests, said NOTHING to me at all. After this i most likely never come back unless im craving a calzone and ill be sure to call in and wait TWO hours before picking it up."}, {"review_id": "mamnzVh1rCUVrLuoFx69Ag", "user_id": "hcdSacyqF1vJMjJrTB9JCQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/30/2017", "text": "Waited over 20 min for a salad to go. Really good gluten free pizza, but salads menu needs more detail. Just got the garden salad with premium vegetables and I'm trying to figure out how it's not a Greek salad. Olives & capers & pepperoncini-barf., marinated artichoke hearts and some other balsamic marinated unidentifiable vegetable. On top of iceberg onions peppers, roma tomato and broccoli.. Not the standard idea of premium vegetables. To me it's disgusting and will go in the trash. Waste of my lunch money. Also, once tried to order a plain salad with chicken on top. They said they couldn't do it even though chicken is an available pizza topping and a topping on a different salad..

But while we're happy about the new larger location, the pizza quality unfortunately has declined. Tonight we ordered the Greek salad and the Mediterranean pizza. The salad was just some spinach with a few ingredients on top, and disappointing. Then the pizza never came; after at least 20 minutes, our server finally followed up and found out that our pizza had been delivered to someone else. When we finally did receive one, something was missing... couldn't figure out what exactly, it was just bland.

Since we share the same birthday, this trip down is special and we decided to try and find a decent meal to start this birthday trip off right. Ben saw a Dominoes pizza driver and stated pizza would be a great change, oh yes. Domino's, the king of pizza! (Yes, that's sarcasm).  I quickly decided to enter pizza into my trusty Waze GPS App and see what choice we had, for local pizza. Jackpot, Tomatino's pizza was the first choice and one look at their website had us sold.  We went downstairs and asked the hotel clerk if she ever heard of the place and she started it was excellent and she goes there regularly.  She even told us a better way to drive, so we could avoid the hood, but I think she was confused as the I-85 route had is driving through some sketchy areas.  But anyhow, let's get to the review.  Tomatino's has several choices of custom pizza from the traditional Margherita, supreme and down to the Sicilian which we chose. They also have the standard build your own too.  You have 3 sizes to choose from Small, medium and large, which is a great option as we're traveling and don't need a huge pizza for 2 people. The prices are affordable and for $10.50, we got a 6 slice pizza with house baked meatballs, mozzarella, roasted red peppers, carmelized onions and Alabama goat cheese. Let me tell you, this pizza is delicious and the crust has just the right amount of crunch and chew to it. They also offer salads, mozzarella sticks and Calzones.  Being a New Yorker, I just had to try one.  Their Calzones are the usual pizza dough filled with ricotta, mozzarella and parmesan cheese, served with red sauce on the side.  You can also include your choice of toppings to be added to the filling.  We choose the meatballs.  The calzone came and it was nice and golden on the outside with a crispy crust and inside was a delicious mixture of warm and yummy cheeses with sliced meatballs.  Very filling and for $8, you can't go wrong.  Feeds at least 2 people.   The restaurant is near a college area, from what I could see, and the decor is dark, but comfortable.  They have a lot of local ales and outside seating as well. Sorry this review is so long, but I was amazed to find a gem like this , off the beaten path. Oh, and there is this adorable coffee house next door, where we got some treats for later and in the morning.  It's called Louisa's bakery and I'll be reviewing that in the morning.  If your looking for a restaurant to hang out with your friends with some great pizza, salads, Calzones and focaccia sandwiches, this is the place to go!"}, {"review_id": "RQfz2utL50LapM0buCeogA", "user_id": "d_lpeMZNVRU0d-t50BGQ6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/24/2016", "text": "Tomatino's is a breath of fresh air.  First off, they're open Sunday evening, a rarity in Montgomery.  Second, though no less important from my perspective, they have gluten-free crusts available and they are perfectly delicious.  I asked for a gluten-free pizza with roasted garlic, fresh basil, and artichoke hearts and the next thing I knew I was inhaling this aroma and then digging in excitedly but also taking care not to burn myself.  Everything was delicious, my server was friendly and we joked about being from the same state, and I had a great meal here.  I honestly don't have a lot to add - the menu offers many selections for more standard pizzas and then a long list of toppings you can use to build your own.  There are sodas and sweet tea available and the atmosphere is pleasant.  Go here and eat pizza.  You will not regret it."}, {"review_id": "wcQzv6VakKK4K5Nv7vOSSw", "user_id": "X6iKSKzeK_thXXdYkvC2CA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/17/2017", "text": "So sad.
