The ingredients are always fresh and exploding with delicious taste because of the Chef and her team's dedication and passion to make everything a surprise and satisfy even the most unsuspecting patrons!  The atmosphere is unique in its feminine elegance wrapped in earthy comfort.  The woman who greets you at the door is a gentle person who you place your order with and on most nights will stop by your table to check in.  Bloodroot is a Jewel and Noel & Selma, it's creators and Mages of keeping magic going in a world where it seems impossible to maintain such a place as theirs, seeped in time past, yet visits and their food is always a welcomed new experience!!"}, {"review_id": "11jiohaVgA2VYj-PNayzvA", "user_id": "z2n-F-k6RDwFAZmFhjiMwg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "Delicious food, great space and atmosphere.

I'm lactose intolerant and he's vegetarian so we tend to lean more towards vegan/vegetarian options. On our way home from our stay in lake george we quickly googled \"vegan food\" near the Bridgeport Ferry and this place popped it. It immediately caught my eye because of the old bookstore feel. We were pleasantly greeted and taken care of. The woman in the front (who we realized after a little while was Selma, the owner) helped us choose from her vegan menu (the bloodroot burger was DELISH!) and shared some history about the place with us. The history and vibe alone is enough to bring people in but the food is what sold us! We will DEFINITELY be back when we take the ferry again."}, {"review_id": "lgDgRkQ2zHseSa4TGu3rDw", "user_id": "79_z0xqvNYs4CLu3tUQzPQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/24/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We recently moved to BlackRock and can't believe our good fortune to actually live so close we can walk over to BloodRoot. My partner and I love the food and the radical welcome we got from Selma and the staff. The food is delectable, fresh, creative and savory. Thanksgiving was a FEAST! So good I am going to have to lie to my mother and say I missed the \"turkey\" meat....  (NOT!) Each course was as good as the next ---we are going to have to make it a tradition from here on out.

You can taste the love and care that goes into every dish! I have never eaten a bad meal here. I even have one of their cookbooks! Don't skip the Chocolate Devastation Cake or the Soysage (vegan sausage, offered for breakfast/brunch). Also, a slice of any of their breads will blow your mind. I get the feeling their sourdough starter is old enough to vote, and I am HERE FOR IT. The menu and the culinary artistry here rivals any vegetarian and vegan food I have had in NYC, this place is a gem."}, {"review_id": "LBGjY7ybaSw51lwXTJDMew", "user_id": "nDehAtN4x3OInW9wGl93jQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/10/2017", "text": "I'll start by saying I really appreciated the vibe and idea behind the place. I get that it's been open a long time and has a huge following. I pride myself in buying local. I've worked at small, made-to-order and locally sourced breakfast restaurants in my time. So when I'm traveling, I look for them. I can't help but compare, and this one, well not so much. Again, people were lovely, vibe was chill and energy was refreshing. Food was decent, not great, especially for the price. Home fries were cut way to large, causing them to be burnt on the outside and mealy on the inside. For $5.50 per order, that was ridiculous. Nothing comes with the main order, it's all al a cart. For a meal with home fries and toast you're looking at $14 minimum, plus drink price. Best part is you have to get your own drinks, get your food when they call your name. Oh and if you forget your utensils, back up to go get them, oops forgot a napkin, back up to get that. You want ketchup, get up and get it. Oh and when you're done.... bus your own table. HA! So although I'd probably visit if I lived local, I've had much better locally sourced, made to order and I get to relax and talk with my family instead of waiting on them and then paying an astronomical price. I was really craving a hot fudge sundae, but since you pay before getting your food you'd have to stand in line and order again, and it was $10.50!"}, {"review_id": "6zkVoM8knePjy73KhhhulA", "user_id": "DymdF2P_fOpDA1o06F0UpQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/4/2017", "text": "When I first came here, I thought the restaurant must have moved, because I didn't see anything that looked like a restaurant--just a fence.  Then I realized it was there, beyond the fence!  Very mysterious and exclusive feeling in that way, like a speak-easy.  This was one of my favorite restaurant experiences, in part because it was perhaps the weirdest and most unexpected restaurant I have been to.  Such an experience!  I knew it was a feminist book store and vegetarian restaurant and that it had a reputation for deliciousness, but I didn't know it would have a magical garden outside, slips of paper taped up all over the place about feminism and other social justice causes, tons of framed photographs that I didn't have a chance to fully explore, and special rules.  All the women who worked there were so kind and friendly.  It had a very pleasant, activisty, unique, and educational atmosphere.  Lots of things to read and look at.  I loved it.DELICIOUS vegan quiche!Note that it is entirely self-service.  You pay for the food, take your slip over to the kitchen to ask the women there to make the food, pick up the food from the kitchen counter when it's ready, get yourself cups and silverware, and clean up after yourself.  Very egalitarian."}, {"review_id": "VXzfreM29gyZE9FIt70z4Q", "user_id": "2cgPA3y01vYHTfKBwfQkqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2017", "text": "Today i had the best french Mushroom Soup I have ever had at Bloodroot.

I do believe my mother and aunt thought they would loose weight eating Thelma and Noel's sumptuous creations. Bloodroot was my first look an feminist politics. I learned nothing about it in school.

Although I am not a vegetarian, I did not miss the presence of meat on the menu. The vegan Mac and cheese was creamy and delicious. The \"chicken\" tikka masala was perfectly spiced and had a great texture. The oatmeal sunflower seed bread had good flavor and was very enjoyable with the homemade coconut butter. Our favorite dish was the red cabbage slaw, which was light and refreshing. We loved the diversity and welcoming atmosphere at Bloodroot. The attached bookstore and feminist decorations gives it a unique vibe that I've been unable to find in Connecticut thus far. I will definitely be returning to try their outdoor brunch in the summer months!"}, {"review_id": "-m8WyBrGZ8HrMZBJd-vzrw", "user_id": "xwKQkW4ldhCps5MFMNZLuA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/4/2017", "text": "I've tried the chicken salad sandwich for lunch & the jerk chicken and mole chicken for dinner.
