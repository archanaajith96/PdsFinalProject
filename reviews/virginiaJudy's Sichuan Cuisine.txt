We've been here a couple of times before and we enjoyed it. The few times we dined here, we found ourselves ordering way too much food. On our last visit, we tried to limit our food to 2 appetizers and 2 entrees. We ordered the Scallion Pancake and Wonton in Hot Chili Oil for our appetizers. The scallion pancake is light and flaky. It's really good dipped in its dipping sauce or just by itself. The wonton in chili oil is outstanding! It's spicy good and it has little hint of sweetness in the chili oil. We also ordered the Chef's Combo Fried Rice, which has shrimp, beef, chicken & vegetables. It wasn't bad but we've had better fried rice from other Chinese restaurants. Another item we ordered was the Steak in Chili Oil. It's served in this massive bowl. I'm glad we didn't order another entree like we're considering initially because this dish can easily feed at least 4 people. It's meant for a large party. The food is good, our server was nice and friendly and the place is beautiful and neat."}, {"review_id": "OsQkul5HA3XlKq8Eg9L1kQ", "user_id": "Wo1lwrgn2KipXqCgZtMmZw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "For good Sichuan food with an equally unappetizing, detestable glare from the notorious owner, check out Judy's. You will experience juxtapositions like no other. The food, while sufficiently good, can not be eaten without feeling the strange aura and glare of the owner. It's thoroughly bizarre, really!For a pleasant dining experience with comparably good Chinese food, I would much rather recommend Jade Villa or Peter Chang's without hesitation at this point. 4 times, I've been here. And each time, this strange, bizarre, and unnerving ambience the owner brings has been increasingly more bothersome. Until this changes (or rather she stops showing up), I don't plan on returning to dine at Judy's. I'll be looking for updates on the day the owner stops showing up. I ESPECIALLY do not want to be another patron that presents any more reasons for the owner to denigrate and abuse her waitresses."}, {"review_id": "sh4iy4BbM1Fjxv7TaH9XjQ", "user_id": "-639Q2F2Dt3ZW41Dg98yiQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "This restaurant should've been a easy 5 star and I wanted very much to be able to give them a full rating, but I simply cannot due to the rudeness of the owner herself - Judy! Everything from the ambience, our waitress, to the wait time and the food was really great! I couldn't have asked for better. But the owner herself made such a terrible impression on us that it pretty much ruined our entire dinner.When we entered the restaurant, she was slowing strolling around the entrance looking completely bored. I waited for a moment for her to greet us, but she looked at us and did not say a thing. I did not think much of it and proceeded to tell her we are a party of 4 with a baby, but to our surprise, she rolled her eyes at us, got some menus, and slowly walked over to an empty table without ever acknowledging us nor shared a single word or physical gesture, and expected us to follow her there. The restaurant wasn't busy, there were 2 other parties besides us, and she placed us at the only table with giant cracks on it (there were about 8 other perfectly good tables she could've chosen to seat us in that would've accommodate the size of our party). Luckily, our waitress was so sweet to apologize for the table and relocated us to another. Throughout the dinner, we couldn't help but notice that Judy clearly didn't have much to do and was slowly pacing around in the restaurant giving everyone (except her friends) judgemental stares. It was a perfectly good dinner ruined by the host. Judy- If you're reading this, you're lucky you have such a wonderful staff and great chef. Show some respect and humility for your customers (or just people in general). Otherwise, I really hope your staff will realize their worth soon and go work for someone with a good heart and treat people with respect."}, {"review_id": "NvRGI-tg1yzODJy-TTqkNw", "user_id": "l2ikirT5taP3RDGqFmoDQg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "I've always walked passed here when I went to Tida Thai.

I enjoyed the wonton in hot chili oil, the diced chicken was delicious, and the lamb in cumin was delectable. I literally have been looking at the pictures to help me figure out what I'm going to order next. I'm sprung. Portion sizes are great. I was able to have 2-3 leftover meals. The food was fresh and spicy. If you can't handle spice read the description carefully. You'll be like Reuben from Along Came Polly. Service was average. Our server was straight to the point. We weren't \"wooed\" by small talk and niceties. She took our order, brought it out, and refilled our water. I did see Judy. She stopped by the table next to us, and chatted with them. I didn't see her interact with any other tables."}, {"review_id": "j7YTSYNrYWODfcnJECBw8Q", "user_id": "SI4robjsf0wkbdbWa67xiQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Excellent real Chinese restaurant.

This was during the snow storm, so off the bat it was exceeding expectations.*Atmosphere*The place was spacious. A line of booths with open tables filling the floor. The private room is what caught my eye, they seem gracious and inviting of larger parties, with notice of course.*Food* For appetizers we got the A2. Xiao Long Bao (8). Which are soup dumplings with pork. The amount of wontons were more than enough to go around. The dumplings were filled graciously and the vinegar sauce that came with it (which i found ok). But in my opinion it should be dipped with the sauce they give you with A6. Pork Wonton in hot chili oil. Now let me tell you this was probably my favorite part of the meal. The hot chili oil in this dish is different from the oil served with many other dishes. While it still contains a manageable amount of spice the oil served with this dish holds intense flavor! It's a thicker consistency with a noticeable sweetness and even hotter chili! Highly recommend!Entree was the Dry Braised Lamb with potatoes, wood ear mushrooms, bamboo shoots, celery. I am fond of lamb but not when it tastes gamey, so I was cautious. However I was pleased and certainly satisfied with this dish. It was served on a burner and came out hot! I am in love with bamboo shoots so that was a plus for me. The lamb was thoroughly cooked and tender. Hot chili oil is served with it, and I would suggest mixing the hot chili oil on top of everything (if you like it hot). More then enough for two people servings, which ended up getting personally boxed to take home. Of course on a cold snowy day we had to have soup to compliment the meal. We ordered a bowl and was thankfully surprised by the portion. Its just thick and soupy enough to not be runny. The bowl contained a bountiful mixture of vegetables with a distinguishable black pepper taste. It's nice to enjoy a soup throughout the meal to cleanse the palette and I suggest this too! Overall I would recommend and suggest anyone to visit this cozy and inviting establishment. Everything was clean, staff was friendly and attentive, and will definitely be frequenting to try out other dishes on the menu!"}, {"review_id": "L0TpE8IHZRKkFRFIOreMbA", "user_id": "W6YYnGcHDxvwwIXowOuhPQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Been so excited to try this spot because heard good things about it Was greeted by an unfriendly hostess who sat us at a table with a huge crack in it ( see pic) Soup dumplings has zero broth in themMenu didn't have many appealing options We settled on Sesame chicken and a crispy beefBoth just okBeef was tasty but loaded with just onions.

Definitely a memorable place. The food really spoke to me. Since then there have been MANY changes. But, the food still stays true. I really enjoy this place. I've yet to come away form here thinking 1) I'm not full 2)That wasn't spicy enough or 3) My meal wasn't good.Judys always hooks you up with PLENY of food. And spicy? Man. You may think you can handle your spice but these chilis will humble you very quickly. And really, I love all the food from here. Was here last night for a Christmas party and I really enjoyed myself. Food came out in a timely manner and the staff was very attentive. My only gripe would be how the tables are set up. I wish we could have ALL sat at one table instead of being split into two round tops. Then again this makes sense why they have them..because they use the \"sharing\" method here where you put your food on a Lazy Susan and you can spin it around so everyone can get some. For those of us who are only children and do not share well with others (raises hand), be forewarned. I got the Cumin Lamb and the Duck in Beer. Both were good and unique. I think between my two, I liked the Duck in Beer more. Which was a soup. It had big thick cuts of tofu, and nice round balls of duck. Be careful because the duck balls (haha ew) have little bones in them.I had some of my friends Kung Pow Chicken and Id have to say that if you're not feeling spicy food that night then this is a great alternative. Very low key dish. Lots of flavor! But since everything everyone else ordered had tons of spice in it, it was nice to taste a dish without it. Plenty of peanuts and chicken. Very heavy serving. Really happy with this dish!Unfortunately I was unable to snap pictures of our food since everyone started digging in at once.

If you can't handle a little heat, make sure to ask the waitress about alternatives. We've been going here for awhile for celebrations or just to stuff our face. For standard Chinese fare, their lo mein (beef, chicken, etc.) is excellent and filled with flavor. The general tsaos chicken is the best here as well as the chicken was crispy with the sauce. My favorites though are anything Yu-shiang sauce (chicken, eggplant, tofu), fish in hot chili oil, and the twice cooked pork. The portions here are meant for sharing and some tables have a round rolling table to help with that. Will continue to come back here so I can eventually try everything on their menu.
