A little. Hole in the wall? Absolutely! But none of that matters! Once inside, the owners are super friendly, nice, and helpful. Prices are good and the food was.... AH-MAZING!! The dangerous part for me is it's walking distance from my house. I imagine they're going to know my name in no time at all. Everything was so good. The fried plantains. The rice. My sandwich. All perfection! My only complaint (and this will not deter future visits) was that it's a very small place. We ate there and I swear I smelled like hot oil/fried food the rest of the day. Lol That aside, go... Try something new. You won't regret it!"}, {"review_id": "6Nre3xlbPb5OcseAyFg6fA", "user_id": "87spmj6KftbIDAbC2hxWPQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/11/2017", "text": "Pls re-visit how you should be packing your to-go orders.  I was trying to grab my sandwich out of the bag, and the other half dropped into the bag falling apart. they simply rolled the large sandwich in one piece of wax paper that had a cut on it from slicing the sandwich, without folding around the edges or securing it with tape, and shoved it in a paper bag.  The sandwich probably would have tasted as good as what I've had at 90 mile cuban cafe in Chicago, but I had to piece it back together because they didn't package it in a way so that the sandwich they assembled, stayed assembled.  The sandwich was not better than anywhere else I've had a cuban. It's kind of a pricey sandwich for the area, and as anyone who cares about food knows, food is olfactory and visual as well. Sometimes the assumption with \"good\" holes in the wall is that things like ambiance is \"meh\" because their focus is on the food. What makes food great are the details! They're already making their own bread (so i've heard, don't know if this is true/still true), so wrapping a sandwich is easy compared to everything else that goes into making a sandwich.  Show your product a little more love so that that love shows, and allows your product to be the best version of itself."}, {"review_id": "g3wGdyjXK8NeZk9RK-MRDw", "user_id": "_3UDJwk_a83RosPU2oPA5g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/11/2017", "text": "We tried this place due to all the recommendations we had received. It's a small cute little shop and the prices are decent. We both got the basic sub and it was just ok for me. And good to my friends. There aren't any sauces on the sandwiches and they are flat there isn't a lot of filling and pretty bland. The staff is friendly and the area to sit and eat is smallish. It was a little busy on the day we went but I don't see myself going back. To me when I eat a sandwich I want it bursting with flavor and fillings. These didn't do that for me."}, {"review_id": "aQwPd5eos2hGXJHgRMVkxw", "user_id": "q7S0YHoPVvVYNnBLt0otAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/19/2017", "text": "Caliente. Muy delicioso! As a northeastern Indiana native, I finally got to try a Cubano and it honestly lived up to my expectations. Caliente, located in East State Village of Fort Wayne, serves up some good food. I had the Tropi Cubano (pork, ham, bacon, cheese, pineapple, banana pepper, and Mayo) and fried plantains. The sandwich was huge and the plantains complemented the sandwich. The lady who took my order was super friendly. The place is a hole-in-the-wall joint, but it's quaint and comfortable. The colors are bright and festive. I went around 3 PM on a Wednesday, so it was dead, but I can imagine it getting busy. Price-wise, not bad. I heard they're opening a new location downtown as well Overall, highly recommended."}, {"review_id": "CCW37wmpZbLFals4ihrVFw", "user_id": "O2ZCLbv1Dpu7lzIV1ZgxSw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/30/2017", "text": "What a tasty little hole in the wall. I stumbled across this place from a suggestion off of (you guessed it) Yelp!I ordered 2 takeout meals for the BF and I on Sunday when I was far too lazy to cook anything, but didn't want fast food. Man oh man was a floored by these scrumptious sandwiches!We both got the classic Cubano, which come on delicious homemade rolls slathered in mustard, pickles, and I think a butter of some sort. The meats are packed with flavor, and not even remotely dry! He got the salty plantains and I got the sweet. I gave it a 4/5 bc the hours are incorrect on Yelp and their website. I went there 2 Sunday's ago and missed them by 15 mins. Not a big deal, but definitely wanna make sure those are accurate!"}, {"review_id": "dOdL3LZ8jhsXzikZuBMu4A", "user_id": "iN5x4Ns5B3Xg-bVuB4GEFQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/25/2017", "text": "The most amazing sandwich in town, The only place to get a real Cuban sandwich,I have had Cubans in Miami, in little Cuba,And this sandwich served here, is the real deal"}, {"review_id": "zVeCr_B73l-DdkSN_1D0hA", "user_id": "G7srAF3p3Petxro4epft2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/9/2017", "text": "This place is the Best Cuban Sandwich and they are family owned where you feel welcomed.

I am not an expert at Cubans but out of the numerous Cubans I have had this is the best I've ever had.. the sand which is also large which is great for the price. Meat was fresh and bread was crispy on outside soft in the middle. I had the plantains which were good my coworker had the tamale and loved it. Highly recommend this place for lunch. Great option in the area."}, {"review_id": "Z_F9Bm-O7-0DO49V3Y1NHQ", "user_id": "6wYUQmOqRfenNdR8cAAPyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2017", "text": "This is a simple Cuban sandwich shop. In my opinion,  that's the right way to do it. They've got a handful of sandwiches,  I went with the Wey. It's a Cuban with refried beans and guac instead of pickles and mustard. Another reason this place is great- the refried beans are black,  not pinto. Correct for Cuban food. My meal of the sandwich, Cuban coffee (colada) and fried plantains was $10, a discount of .75 over ordering separately. The coffee was excellent as were the plantains. They only knock was that the insides ood the sandwich weren't super hot once the sandwich was done in the press.Overall a far more authentic place then you'd expect in an industrial Midwest town."}, {"review_id": "fjM4iVxS_js6oacJN5FYng", "user_id": "RfKNc33XV0pkW6HCAORgiw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/24/2017", "text": "I went here for lunch today and the food and service were great!
