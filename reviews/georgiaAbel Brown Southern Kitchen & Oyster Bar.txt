I have long denied them access to my palette because of the texture. Now fried, much like calamari, I can enjoy for many a hour. But time has taught me that sometimes you miss out by excluding. And raw oysters are no different. Much like my caffeine source of choice (or is it addiction?) coffee, I know that the region in which they are harvested as well as the time of year influence the flavor. And it didn't make sense that I would dine on every other offering from the sea (from scallops to lobster to crab and beyond) yet deny myself these hor d'oeuvres of the ocean. But I digress. Let me tell you about this place.    We came during the happy hour because it not only includes drinks, but you guessed it...oysters. Now I tiptoed in by order the Rockefeller. Yes they are cooked, but more importantly here is the taste. They (like all selections) come out in half or whole dozen. I wish we had ordered an entire dozen of just these. While awaiting this delightful offering, I had time to case the place. I had already picked up on the low lighting, rustic feel, and oyster bar that all beckoned as soon as you walk in. What I then noticed though was the full bar in one area. It was a work of art. So many bars today are the level boards, maybe a granite countertop, but nothing amazing. Here the woodwork told me someone had put some time (and money) into crafting this bar.    I didn't dive into the cocktails, as I wanted my full attention to be on the shelled delights so I can't speak to those. I have heard they have some good ones though. For me, it was all about Chesapeake Bay. I knew the crabs from there were just the right amount of saltiness. And I was pleased to find the oysters to be the same. I did some as is, some with a dollop of hot sauce, and some with a splash of melted butter. You just have to find what you prefer, but know this. You will find quality oysters here. I look forward to returning soon.-Come here for brunch and for supper. Brunch carries with it a menu until itself. And for supper, throw in at least one order of deviled eggs. You won't regret it."}, {"review_id": "Wkt2T41dupzdZlJgzgENzQ", "user_id": "VHghJKI4tylqZxOzFdqwfg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Really really enjoyed my food here! My fiancé and I came here for my birthday. I was a little surprised to find a nice spot like this in Augusta, as it seems a little rare, but this is definitely one to go to for a nice anniversary dinner! The mood is romantic, with dim lights when you come in, and candles on the tables. Key things to note: everything is made in house down to the ice cream/ they can get packed around masters time, and they prepare accordingly.Our server was very attentive and sweet, however it was super annoying that when we ordered something, she kept repeating the price to us and asking if it was okay. We aren't strangers to eating at nice places, and it's pretty obvious looking at the menu that you aren't coming here for Applebee's prices. We didn't hear them do that to any of the other tables around us, and if people know the price of something was so important for them to know, I think it should be on the menu if that's such a priority. For this here I have them a 3 as I found it offensive.Food: everything was delicious. Try the crab cake, it's simply delicious, and the cowgirl steak was amazing! We also got fried oysters, which were good but a little over breaded, and greasy. We also got a cheese and meat platter, which was beautifully plated. Dessert was bomb!! I wanted to try everything on the menu. We went for the chocolate bar that came with peanut butter ice cream. Just get it for the ice cream, because I haven't had anything else better than that. Apparently they intend to start selling pints! The food was a 5.Price: it's a nice spot, so your dishes will be around 20-45 depending on what you get.Parking: plenty of parking though it's a semi shared lot.Attire: though I saw some people come in casually dressed, the vibe of the restaurant is a dressy/business casual."}, {"review_id": "FLS5OYCcmVoV-zg-_Ouw7A", "user_id": "6nTvtDy4RnltOsPcFRvGdQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Love this place!

We decided to try the lobster roll appetizer and I would absolutely order that again if they had it as a special again and/or put it on the regular menu. The bread that it was served on was delicious. Bread was brought right after our appetizer was taken, which was really nice. My husband went with the black bass special for an entree and I went with the tenderloin au poivre. The mushrooms and frites that my tenderloin was served over were very flavorful. I tried a bite of my husband's dish and it was very good and it was a very good sized portion. We were both too full for a dessert (even though the bread pudding & chocolate bar were calling our names) but maybe next time. Again, I'm really glad we gave this place another try because the experience and service were both much better than last time. We will be back to try more!"}, {"review_id": "pC2w-gtQfEgZtcspHf954w", "user_id": "E0ZmP-6EYVakiAY8x4YSwA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/22/2017", "text": "We think this is the best restaurant in Augusta (although have yet to visit Frog Hollow in downtown). It could hold its own in Atlanta, which is a statement not applicable to most restaurants in Augusta. Abel Brown is a solid 4 in the ATL, 5 in Augusta. Smoked fish charcuterie: good selection of tasty smoked fish. There's a sweet flavored one, which is odd, but I guess makes this dish memorable.
