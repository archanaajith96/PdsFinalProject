Food was not the first thing on my mind. I hadn't had coffee yet that day so Not Just Coffee was the first place I went. The line was long, which to me is a sign that it's good. So, I jumped right in line with the rest of the caffeine junkies. The line went fast and I ordered a cold brew to go. The staff member manning the register was friendly and happily answered a few questions about the difference between nitro cold brew and regular old cold brew. The iced coffee I got was smooth and not too acidic which I appreciate. Honestly, I enjoyed it so much I went back two days later. I needed a coffee fix before I got back on the road home to Ohio. This time around I ordered a latte. I always opt for the milk alternatives and this place had oat milk. I've never been to a coffee shop that offered this so I was intrigued and ultimately got an oat milk latte to go. Oh my, it was delicious. It was extremely smooth and I sucked it down quicker than I normally do. This place was hip, reminded me of a coffee shop I would find at home in Ohio and if I find myself in Charlotte again, I'll know where to go to get my caffeine fix!"}, {"review_id": "800ff9bH3H-XWG38H8GFNQ", "user_id": "oPUgcBu3fdF13pxApv6Ozg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "We've found ourselves in the Uptown area quite often lately, and have been stopping into the 7th Street Public Market for a bite.  Our first stop every time we visit is to Not Just Coffee, located right in the middle of the market.First, their brewed coffee is very high quality.  It's the kind of coffee you just want to sit there and drink, without anything else distracting you.  Definitely not the type you'd throw into a travel mug and sip on your way to work while checking your phone to see who liked the Facebook post of you throwing your fully clothed niece into the pool.  The iced coffee is just as good, and heaven on a hot day.What compelled me to write this review, after about my tenth visit, was the latte I got this past weekend.  It was hands-down the best latte I've ever had.  The espresso was perfect; bright, fruity, packing a punch.  The steamed milk was expertly done, and provided that perfect hint of sweetness to counteract the bitterness of the espresso.  I think I took a contented sigh after every sip, because it was just that good...like, so good I might not even get their brewed coffee anymore.  It was transcendent.The place can get busy quickly so get in line as soon as you can.  The baristas working there all know their stuff, too, expertly creating delicious caffeinated beverages for the tired, cranky people looking for a boost.  I'd stop by here any day of the week."}, {"review_id": "JE-CtnOz1qoMxucSL66RMA", "user_id": "dpzAqLprtex54rXlCU-OTA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Success story one after another, I made it a mission to grab a cup on my 4th visit to 7SPM. Its raining and dreary so the nice, warm atmosphere of Not Just Coffee's booth was very welcoming for someone who's spent most of the morning outside. Time to unwind a bit.Menu is simple and I saw they use Counter Culture beans from Durham, NC (a big plus already!). Service was quick with a smile and they have REAL glasses if you're drinking your morning Joe at the bar.I got the \"regular\" cold brew coffee with room for syrup and cream (I'd estimate 1/2 oz. each). The flavor is what I would expect from Counter Culture but definitely different from a hot coffee. While still more acidic than most Cold Brews I've had, this delivers a bright, almost berry-like body and fared well to the small amount of sweetener I added. I'd dare say I could drink this without cream or sugar! It's mostly a singular note of flavor compared to other local roasters, but they nailed it. Very nice and I see why people rant and rave about NJC now.For the price, you've got to remember that Cold Brew is a whole different animal. It takes significantly longer to brew (12-18 hours) and a lot more bean to produce. I've seen many brews that call for a 1:2 ratio of bean to water. All that bring said, you get 12oz of cold brew for $4. I'd consider this a fair price for the quality. You can find cheaper in grocery stores but you're not going to beat it for as fresh as this is.I've ignored NJC for awhile and I think it's because I was afraid it would either be better OR worse than my favorite shop. I've got to say it's nice to finally change things up. Afterall, Charlotte's got a lot of coffee to offer!"}, {"review_id": "QnMOSkqjWIyCV33Zq8BkXA", "user_id": "EaRd_4nFnPs8Fei-H2ZmVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "What to get: vanilla sugar latteService: 4/5Atmosphere: small 'pop up' stand/counter at an indoor market, trendyWait: 5 mins (Saturday 3PM for 1)Parking: parking garagesThe Experience:Despite it's name, I'd highly recommend their coffee here. I had coffee in multiple cities while traveling, but this would be one of my favorite places during my week long trip.NJC is located in 7th Street Market, which is an indoor marketplace with multiple shops. It's a small, wooden bar with stools that encircle the baristas and their coffee-making magic. There was a consistent line the entire time I was there and there might not always be a spot right at their bar, but there are neighboring tables around.The more coffee drinks I taste, the more I expect it to be somewhat of an art form and crafted with care. NJC does just that. Quality products and well-conceived recipes, I enjoyed my drink easily. I had the vanilla sugar latte and although the picture shows kind of a sad latte art piece, the drink was delicious. I was about to order a second one, but refrained since I'm just visiting around for a taste of the local flavor of each city. I will approve NJC as one of the highlights of Charlotte, so I hope the locals recognize how lucky they are to have such a place :)"}, {"review_id": "tr4IdQMdJ4B9QvLHTNIq1w", "user_id": "6RhRgFFzzDOQPXdYqhOxPQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Stopped here while on a business trip.

Coffee wise - it's Not Just Coffee. Their spot is nice, with a wooden bar & high top bar stools to sit while you wait/watch the magic happen. Or while you sip. They make all their lattes look like art. I've tried different lattes everytime I've been. Their spices (pumpkin-Ish) during the fall was good. I recently had a VSL - vanilla sugar latte. It was perfect! Not too sweet like you'd think. Homemade syrups! The baristas are pure pleasure. They are hip & cool, and super friendly! This location, does have validated parking for 90 mins! It's the parking garage right there with it between 6th & 7th Street. You can enter on either side.

Also, if you keep your eyes open, you can snug a seat at the bar.P.S: try their winter signature drink: The Holy Mole. Come try the Holy Mole!

We. Really like this location not just for the coffee but the constant but easy going vibe of the Market  itself.  Loved the eclectic feel, various offerings and always present but pleasant crowds. As for the coffee - great!  My Carmel Machiatto was creamy, buttery and had just the perfect balance of dark coffee and sweet from the Carmel; no sugar. My husband  told me years ago that you can't truly appreciate coffee at its best until you have a cup with no sugar and a touch of cream. He was right... about that!Even if you just wanted to take a minute to yourself to just sit, you could do that and leave unburdened.  Nice!"}, {"review_id": "ZEZOOy1hh7O7WDvq46O_5A", "user_id": "azpZPrb02xWYI_S0MYfIGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "I love Not Just Coffee even though the name lies since what they offer is just coffee drinks, not food lol. My favorite thing to order is the Mocha because it has just a touch of cocoa without being overly sweet. I also like the vanilla sugar latte and the cortado (if you really need a boost!). Their pour over is also really good and high quality. They use Counter Culture coffee beans, which is an NC based roasting company using single-origin beans. This location inside 7th Street Market is also a pretty cool one because you can browse other shops or stands while you wait for your coffee to brew."}, {"review_id": "gM0Joq3PdNa5eTA6sojbiw", "user_id": "Li1DczC58IL9NcOOWsF9kQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Smoothest Caramel Latté I ever had!

Marathon day was one of the busiest I've seen the 7th Street Market, but was still a great choice for a date. Wait times on Saturday around 10 minutes for a specialty order (other than drip). There is a good amount of seating to accommodate the multiple businesses inside, and we surprisingly were able to find another couple who was willing to share the other half of their table. NJC had a quick process for getting through the line of customers and maintaining correct orders. The seating at the coffee bar is prime but usually full.I have yet to try many of the different coffee creations NJC has to offer, but the medium roast is always a solid choice. Long lines typically indicate popularity and that is the case here.
