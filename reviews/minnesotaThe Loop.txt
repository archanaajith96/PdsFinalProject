Sweet, spicy, and an excellent way to start your meal. The Chopped chicken salad was as good as salads get. The vegetables were fresh, the dressing was creamy. The Avocado melt was an excellent lunchtime option. The bread was perfectly toasted, the avocado was ripe. It was the uncontested winner of the meal."}, {"review_id": "_SAYbWEBN3PiGT-bJFoYDw", "user_id": "WzNH5YDQj4Y274DGsL-iHA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/25/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I think this is my 4th or 5th time at The Loop and my second time in a row with \"ok\" food.  Both my husband and I ordered the Salmon with Crab cake.  After ordering the server asked how I liked my salmon.  I was confused so I asked her what she mean and she replied with \"well-done, medium-well, medium, medium-rare\".  I eat A LOT of salmon and I have never been asked this question before.  I told her I want it cooked the way salmon is usually cooked.  She seemed ok with that answer.  When she brought the dish out it looked great but the salmon was definitely dry.  I'm not a picky eater and I rarely complained so I ate it...all   The crab cake was good and the spinach Cajun cream sauce was really good.I do love the ambiance of this place...it's cool.  I'm not sure it's enough to make me go back unfortunately."}, {"review_id": "y_xn0JI0WkSRj-O63wcjKg", "user_id": "Ln3Un3bRt36JJczUAto5EQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Super cute place loved the patio seating. I only order the buffalo chicken won tons which were amazing and I ordered a ceasar salad which was NOT the ceasar dressing tasted really weird. I had to send it back.

There's a quality assortment of sides and entrees, and the drinks are tasty and creative (read: GoT themed cocktails). Personal favorites are the mac n' cheese, the sweet potato (and regular) fries, the nachos, the chopped salad, the chocolate chippers, and the rocky road brownie sundae. Portions are pretty big and the food errs on the richer / heavier end, so bringing a big group and splitting a bunch of items is the move. They have a Thursday's on First booth in the summer with great sides, and awesome holiday drink specials (cranberry Moscow mules)!"}, {"review_id": "7C3S5HR1jmWy_kcB5KM5aQ", "user_id": "c-Xv9EplYJw__iiOnS5JBQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Delicious food and fantastic service.

It was a Sunday, so they had their brunch menu available and I was shocked at the amount of options available, as well as the low prices. I opted for the veggie tacos which cost $13 and came with black beans and cilantro rice. The tacos were delicious, and so were the sides. Our group also got a variety of drinks (margaritas, mojitos, and tea) and everyone enjoyed them. Service was okay, probably the least pleasing part of the experience but it wasn't terrible! Friendly staff, just not super attentive. All in all, great food, great prices, and adequate service."}, {"review_id": "1e1plUT5k-8gYdUCH-xBCA", "user_id": "FTY-5YX_sMGpyNpZP6Txaw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Cheese Curds,  buffalo roasted cauli were delish apps.

We were greeted and seated rather quickly (it was early in the lunch hour on a Wednesday). The server was prompt in bringing out menu's and waters. The lunch menu was limited, with most meals in the 10-15 dollar range. This is fairly average pricing for lunch in the downtown Rochester area. I decided on the Basic Burger and my wife ordered the Blackened Chicken Salad. My burger came with a side of fries, and my wife's had an option of added bread and butter for another $2. Food came out within 10 minutes of ordering, both meals were presented well. The burger was down right delicious. I am not sure how they make their buns, but it melted in my mouth while eating. The meat was cooked correctly, and the jalapeño cheese spread created a great taste. I also tried my wife's salad, which also had a great combo of flavor. We would have just preferred the dressing on the side. Other than that the food was really good. Impassive overall experience around atmosphere, service, and menu options."}, {"review_id": "onP1wU9WqWfQuABh3L9wUQ", "user_id": "SPmaZWRB_6RqSifoMw4dsg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/20/2017", "text": "The food can be a hit or miss but it has defiantly improved this past year.
