The place was packed, but we quickly made it through the line and were delighted to find there was a 10% off yelp check-in coupon. The staff here are outstanding, walking around and making sure we have everything we need (utensils and sauces). We waited a bit for our food, but it was definitely well worth the wait.2 of my friends ordered the hot wings, the other ordered the chicken with waffles, and I ordered the fish plate. Overall, everything was great, I just have one complaint. The Spanish rice I got as a side, was dried and crispy. I didn't like it, but thought that was just the style. My friend also had a Spanish rice which was a lot more moist and how I imagined it to be (I posted a pic of the two for comparison, mine looks pretty crispy/overcooked). That is really my only complaint.The atmosphere here is very nice. They may have a small menu here, but they definitely do their menu well. Looking forward to coming back in the future to try some of their other dishes!"}, {"review_id": "rW0Mk6iee9kDQhaTI-86zA", "user_id": "cxbNoom5vXFvQZKHKtE_Dg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "HOLY SMOKES!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a must stop if you are in the area, heck-make it a stop if you are within an hour drive. I couldn't believe the menu, the service and the awesome taste of the food. They can make any of their fried food gluten free, they even had gluten free deep fried Oreos the day I went. OMGSH it was pure heaven, why can't a large metropolitan like Kansas City have a place like this? Makes me scratch my head. I ordered the gluten free fried fish with French fries, coleslaw and a side of gluten free deep fried oreos (FYI I have never had a deep fried oreo before, but now I want them all the time). The owner actually took my order, she was awesome! Friendly, responsive, good communicator and happy. I asked her who in her family had the gluten allergy and it was actually her sisters best friend. The only thing I didn't like was the coleslaw, it had pickles which I didn't love. I wish for the life of me it was closer and I had more work trips to Birmingham. Parking is located on the street, you stand in line to place your order, get your drink and find a table. They will deliver the food to your table. Space is small, I went around 1:30PM and there were only about 3 empty tables. Price was reasonable! Anywhere else it would have been double."}, {"review_id": "TA-YV9Mx0WK5SiuZKIbi1g", "user_id": "e6MfKsE55-KXAK6eGp7z5Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "This place must taste like Yo' Mama's house bc it sure as heck didn't taste like my mama's house.

If you aren't counting calories, puuullease go to this place for lunch or try the homemade maple syrup and gluten free chicken and waffles for brunch when they have it every few weeks. Friend brought me here and I got my go to shrimp and grits. Don't judge me. I live in Alabama. I use any excuse to eat cheesy breakfast food. Yum!! So delicious make you want to thank those bible verses written in the walls for such goodness! Sorry, no pic. I ate it all too fast.

It's a fast casual joint that specializes in fried chicken wings. It's a shame when you visit a place that specializes in something, but that something isn't all that special. That's definitely not the case here. Service is fast and consistent. The staff here really go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need to enjoy your meal. You can taste the passion breaded onto the wings here. Portions are also huge, so I recommend sharing when you go. I had an order of their fried chicken wings with the house made hot sauce on the side. Seriously so good. The hot sauce was just the right balance of spicy, sweet, and tangy. I highly recommend Yo' Mama's as yo regular lunch spot."}, {"review_id": "SfjqZbO3LKo44-DbT-qy6Q", "user_id": "lmHJ0Q203WeKfEO1J-jSJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "The chicken sandwich marinated in sweet tea and pickle juice was phenomenal.

Shout out to him for choosing a great place for lunch. The place is small and cute, and the hospitality of the workers here is truly five star. There were a couple of things on the menu that jumped out to me, and we ended up sharing one order of 7 wings, fries, and cole slaw. Best decision ever! When the server brought out the ginormous bowl of wings, I was super relieved I wouldn't be tempted to finish all of this yummy goodness. The wings were huge, the meat was cooked perfectly. The fries were good too, and the cole slaw was refreshingly healthy. I didn't see a trace of mayo! The only thing I would have wished was for them to have a few healthier entrees on the menu like a salad or what Alex suggested and maybe offer baked wings. Hopefully in the future they will!"}, {"review_id": "_vCjAvhqsTl0yLsUbOUXeA", "user_id": "3pD0s1WJv6418a4PF0ByWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "Yo' Mama's is the real deal. I've tried to visit for lunch, but they are always packed. When I learned they are open Thursday  for dinner, I thought it was the perfect time to visit. We arrived shortly after 5:00 and we were the only people in the restaurant, but  by 5:30 there was a nice crowd. It was the first Thursday of the month and they had live music,  which was a \"cherry on top\" of the experience.Their fried chicken is top notch. I ordered the fried chicken plate with fries. It came with 7 wings. The portion was ENORMOUS, definitely enough to share. The fries are fresh cut. I also had a chance to try the waffle (on the chicken and waffles plate). It was dee lish!!! Soft and sweet. The syrup is a mix of some sort of tastiness, not exactly sure what, but I certainly enjoyed it.Though the food is reason enough to visit, I love the vibe of the restaurant.

Okay, so let me begin by congratulating yo mamas meals for being featured in NYT food this past year and anticipating an appearance on the cooking channel this spring! yo mamas meals is located on the illustrious 2nd Ave North, Birmingham's region known for its arts and fine dining. Two shrimp tacos; one fried, one grilled. A heaping bowl and black beans and rice with a side of sour cream and Southwest sauce. The flour tortillas were the perfect texture with both fried and grilled shrimp. So kind to my palette . The beans were seasoned like beans cooked in the South should be. The rice were yummy and sticky; both complimenting the main dish very well! Less calories and lots of flavor.

I had read mixed reviews on this place so I decided to give it a try for myself. Upon entering, I expected a greeting however that was not the case. I literally had to speak to the cashier to begin any conversation. Whenever I'm not wearing a suit and tie as normal I enjoy being relaxed in my sweats. I'm assuming because I was not presented professionally is the reason I was not greeted as the guy behind me was. Their Kool-Aid beverage was surprisingly pretty good. It brought back a childhood taste that I'd been longing for. I ordered the hot wing plate. The wing flavor was impeccable. My only issue with the food is that I asked for my wings to be well done and I received quite the opposite. I'd give this place a second chance if I am to visit Birmingham again because I'm firm on believing that I should give most experiences a second try.
