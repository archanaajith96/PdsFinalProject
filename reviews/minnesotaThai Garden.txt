I've drove by it multiple of times and it didn't occur to me to try this place. I came here with a friend on a whim and I'm glad we discovered this restaurant. Parking is in the back of the building as soon as you turn into the restaurant. We arrived around 5:30 pm; it was a bit slow-- not a lot of people in the restaurant so we were seated right away.  The service was great (Joshua, hopefully I got his name right!) We also got to meet and talk to the chef/ owner of the restaurant. It was awesome to talk to both Joshua and the owner of the restaurant-- to hear their story. The owner not only talked to us, but he talked to the other people (seated right next to us) and asked how their meal was and if there's anything he can do for them. I ordered the fried rice chili pepper (hopefully I got it right!) I was a bit hesitant because there wasn't any pictures, but after reading what was in the dish I decided to take a leap and order it. I was not disappointed! It was so DELICIOUS! The spice level was mild, and it was perfect!!! Next time I'll make it a bit spicier just because I do like  spicy food too. In addition to the fried rice, I order the Thai egg roll (chicken). I expected the egg roll to be a bit bigger but, it's okay. Everything that we've ordered today was amazingly delicious! I would come back again and would recommend you to try this place if you haven't tried it before and looking to try a different restaurant on University."}, {"review_id": "bpUSAVV4Zt6eqpw2ihsI1w", "user_id": "U7UHESx63ig3dVrus2LWBQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Ordered pad kee mao (drunken noodles) and thai kao poon, along with the thai tea and mango sticky rice.Firstly, the drunken noodles. Portion was sufficient, flavor was really good, and presentation was pretty. If anything, the only gripe was the raw bean sprouts. I don't know if the dish is supposed to come with raw ones, but the flavor was a bit strong. I feel like they should have at least soaked in water a bit.Next, the thai kao poon was something new for me. It was a curry soup like dish with noodles. The soup was good but I would have preferred a little more curry or sweetness.The thai tea was the only bad part... it was way sweet, and not the flavor I was hoping for. The color was an interesting pink as well.The mango sticky rice was very flavorful and a saving grace. Just your typical dish but well presented and not too sweet or bland. I'd come again to try other dishes."}, {"review_id": "vp8MWRgCJ8aj8HKhQQoJMw", "user_id": "o3e8EGymK78_4BstT1l_Yg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "This is not authentic Thai food.

They have the perfect broth taste and their prices and portions are super fair. I crave pho from here all the time now that I've discovered it. I've tried their pad Thai and curries as well. They're not the best ever but they are priced well. Thai tea isn't that good here (I've had better) but that's my opinion. Their staff is friendly too. Smaller restaurant but still enough space. Come here for the pho!"}, {"review_id": "howGSbs9g02Geikn-qyOPw", "user_id": "fPUjMtgRHtyx336y6VzcVQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Pretty good Thai food.

Good. Take out. Thank god we discovered this place, because driving to Minneapolis for Pad Thai was getting ridiculous. Full disclosure, I've never actually eaten in, I've only ordered take out. The take out comes in portions that are large, but still make you think \"I could probably eat half of this and save the rest.... right?\" (spoiler: you won't. If you're like me, you'll eat it all.)It's delicious and fresh and comes out piping hot. Watch out for parking, it's kind of a nightmare.

Kinda sweet, which was unique and different from other fried rice (ex: Chinese).Pad See Ew: Lovely, taste really good!

The food is good- but be prepared for really poor service and not a great setting. The first time we went we enjoyed the food but we were freezing the entire time- we were placed in the back room that is a good 10-15 degrees cooler than the main dining room and we only had 4 people. That night we also witnessed a table by us leave before the food came because they had been waiting for so long.We figured since the food was good and we just didn't care for the atmosphere, we would do take out. When I called to order, they told me if I was looking at menus online- 90% of it was incorrect and that there was no online menu. Hey Thai Garden, take a picture of the menu and put it on Yelp- it will help you and anyone who makes the mistake to order from you in the future. The final and last time we ordered from them was tonight. I put an order in at 7:05 and was told it would be 15 minutes. Seems when my bf went to pick it up at 7:25 they had not put the order in- they finally had the order ready at 7:50. He was told \"we were waiting for the egg rolls to get crispy\". Mistakes happen, however, own it and then offer a discount. When my BF asked for this, he was told fine, but it would never happen again- that is absolutely right, you will never need to give us a discount because your lack of customer service lost us as customers. Three dollar egg rolls for free and you felt the need to warn him it would never happen again. You realize this was your mistake, right? This could have been an easy fix"}, {"review_id": "99t2u71T8lgtfhPpgIMvwQ", "user_id": "mEQ6pdXRthDHwYelfO3HTQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Very interesting place.

I'll give it another shot but not anytime soon.Drunken Noodles - 3/5This was a good dish, I was just REALLY disappointed in how scant the noodles were. I had to hunt and dig for the noodles beneath the obnoxious amount of bean sprouts they pile on top. Even then, the noodles were chopped up into smaller pieces. Forget twirling your fork around some tasty flat, wide rice noodles, you'll be lucky if you can even find a piece big enough to stab with your fork. I'd easily rate this a 4/5 but with the stingy portion of noodles, it gets deducted a point.Green Curry - 2.5/5It was overly salted/seasoned and I'm not sure what type of cream/milk they prepare it with, but I couldn't taste it (their menu doesn't list the cream/milk they use). I was expecting coconut milk but couldn't taste any hint of it.Customer Service - 1/5When our waiter came by to ask how the food was, I shared my feelings about the lack of noodles. She told me that was the regular amount they always put in the entree and that since I ordered the dish with extra veggies, the noodles were drowned out by the other items. Fine, whatever. At most places I go, if someone asks how my food is and I had a problem with it, they generally apologize and try to make it right. This was not the case at Thai Garden. A few minutes later the manager/chef/owner came out and asked if I was the one who didn't like my food. I told him what I told the waiter and I thought maybe he might tell me something different or offer an alternative solution. Instead, he doubled-down on what the waiter told me. He then went into a rant about how the cost of making vegan ingredients is so much higher than non-vegan and that I should be happy because the prices would be going up soon. Okay... ? If you're losing money on food, that's not my problem. The prices were very reasonable, if not cheap, so I wouldn't have batted an eye if each dish were a few dollars more."}, {"review_id": "nSf8BP7ESGp36k1tsRvCqQ", "user_id": "b4YWbiq0UTw6LItN9izADA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "The Pho is so good and great prices.

I ordered a Thai salad - thingy sliced steak, fresh cabbage, mouthwatering Thai sweet paste, chili flakes. My hubby ordered Pad Cashew and it was an absolute delight - sautéed broccoli , cauliflower, cabbage, shrimp and of course a ton of cashews.

Affordable, fresh, flavorful Thai food in St Paul conveniently located off the light rail. I had the drunken noodles since the Yelp pictures made medrool along with veggie egg rolls. Egg rolls were a bit greasy, but my main dish was packed with flavor and left enough for a second meal. The leftovers tasted even better than my original meal, which never happens for me! I was super disappointed they ran out of mango sticky rice (one of my favorites), but I guess it's a reason to return. The service was great and the chef even came out to ask how our meal was. I did miss having a bar or alcoholic options, but it was a quick drive to Selby for an after dinner drink. I will be back so many times even though us Minneapolis folk don't love to cross the river.
