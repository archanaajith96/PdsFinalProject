At first, there was some hesitance because they're still doing some work/remodeling outside, and to be honest; the establishment doesn't really look like a restaurant from the outside. At first glance I thought it was a hardware store, but hopefully the outer appearance is being worked on and once it's finished it'll look more inviting. Our reason for coming here is because we were told that this is the new Vinh Chau which I always enjoyed when visiting the New England area but personally, I tasted differences with the food, and I didn't think it was as good. I shall momentarily explain specifically what that means.I'd say the overall new location is about 3 times bigger than the old Vinh chau. Service was excellent, and our waitress was really kind and patient - especially with my excessively undecided aunt that kept changing her menu option every 5 seconds. I was able to get my meatless options and the Vegetarian style pho I ordered was absolutely delicious. The broth was golden and rich tasting, the tofu was lightly fried so it had a slight crunch; really very good, I'd come back for that happily. The summer rolls however, i'd definitely skip that. It was literally just rice noodles, a slab of tofu, and a thai basil leaf wrapped in rice paper - very boring and uneventful and in my opinion doesn't warrant the almost $6 price tag. Everyone else at the table ordered the chicken noodle soup which they said didn't measure up to Vinh Chau's, they still liked it, but again; it just wasn't the same.I was torn between 3 and 4 stars here and I finally decided that because service was so good, I'd give them a 4 but the food was between a 3 and 4. I'd still recommend Soc trang because of its good service, and definitely give that vegetarian soup a try."}, {"review_id": "sem6_ZXNNIoHRF6dOu6QGA", "user_id": "ZbQzbnsvWUmGJFeNeSsr2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "Just discovered this gem when our go to restaurant was closed....I had the egg rolls and a bowl of pho ga, and it was FANTASTIC.

The food ALWAYS arrive quickly and taste delicious at the same time. The short-rib rice dish at Soc Trang is absolutely delicious and a must-try if you think you're ready for other types of Vietnamese food besides the default pho option when you enter a Vietnamese Restaurant.Some cons about the place is that parking is quite difficult because the parking lot in front of the restaurant is quite small, however you are able to park on the side street adjacent to the restaurant. Depending on what type of person you are, the spacey area in the restaurant gives an illusion that there are no other patrons in the restaurant, so it might not be the ideal place to visit during the day if you enjoy eating while surrounded by people. However, it's ideal if you enjoy eating in privacy with your friends, family, or perhaps a date."}, {"review_id": "OnEP6vE80x3xhgAYpRbgUw", "user_id": "9bFaU5zDe927gMqAUXWjBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "Hands down the best Vietnamese restaurant in the area.

Just wow.It's always a treat to find quality, Vietnamese food. For the last 10 years, these folks owned and operated Vinh Chau. With the new space, they now can serve and cater to over 200 guests, host local shows, and thankfully, they brought over the same recipes!I've been here a number of times, and every single time -- Soc Trang really delivers on fresh, delicious and well-made Vietnamese meals. To start, the entire menu is reasonably priced. Spring rolls are plump, pho is on point -- the broth is perfect. A plate of ALL the necessary fresh herbs accompanies your bowl. The bun (vermicelli), rice or egg noodle bowls, beef stews and rice dishes are all just fantastic.Service is friendly, courteous, and prompt. The fruit smoothies and boba teas are good to. Trust me when I say, check out Soc Trang, you won't be disappointed!"}, {"review_id": "c6BzlofJjug_Q_UfQvY3TA", "user_id": "I9aWhiHBZ2GgyHrfDPjUmg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/9/2017", "text": "Not the greatest vietnamese restaurant in Springfield i prefer the other 2(pho saigon, vinh chau)food wasn't great."}, {"review_id": "9MKYPPG3nybqGbo8fh7VRA", "user_id": "Zti-aqj9gq7L9ixeVahfUg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/10/2015", "text": "The pull (and craving of fresh spring rolls) was strong this afternoon so I was luckily to be traveling with my +1 who is always in the mood for some Vietnamese food (especially when Pho is on the menu).Shoutout to Thein N. for his review which steered us to this awesome restaurant.  Although we arrived in between lunch and dinner, and the restaurant was completely empty, we were waited upon by a lovely employee during the duration of our visit to Soc Trang.  After receiving our beverages (Unsweetened iced Vietnamese tea, I think) I started to pursue the expansive, but not overly daunting menu of noodle, rice and hot pot dishes.  Our waitress was sweet and answered all of my questions, and did not even bat an eye when I asked to modify my fresh spring roll order to omit the pork.My first choice was the shredded cabbage salad but they were out - boo - however my second choice - a make your own spring roll dish - caught my eye and I went for it!  My +1 - predictably ordered the beef Pho.In no time both our spring rolls and our main meals were brought to us.  A bit perplexed when all the ingredients were put in front of me, our waitress easily explained the \"how to\" of assemblage and consumption.  There is something to be said about assembling your own dish (hello tacos!) but the ingredients were on point and each bite was burst of excitement to my taste buds.  Perfectly seasoned (and moist) chicken, layered with basil (or mint), steamed rice noodles, cucumbers, bean sprouts, and lettuce were all available to wrap up in rice paper that I learned to gently dip into hot water to soften.  I have always been a bit of an over stuffer but the moisten rice paper took on the load.My meal was perfectly satisfying and a steal at 11.95 and can see why this place gets so many positive reviews.I don't head to Springfield that often but will definately keep this restuarant in my wheelhouse!"}, {"review_id": "DOedgqCHHs-2E6PiQa1_1Q", "user_id": "MSCQhvpwSmH513iyr5n5Lg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/1/2017", "text": "This will now be our go to place for Pho.

Someone at our table didn't get their rice (which we paid for) but I'm not a stickler and didn't feel like harassing our server.
