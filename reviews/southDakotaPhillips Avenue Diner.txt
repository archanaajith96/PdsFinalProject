Seemed to take some liberties with a couple more traditional dishes that didn't really add to the dish. I.e the meat added to the poutine made the already heavy meal much heavier and didn't add anything to the flavor. However, would recommend the stroganoff and the sticky noodle salad! Both were delicious and all the ingredients melded well together to make a complete and satisfying dish."}, {"review_id": "4Rp2RPha2_STSxd9EXdaMw", "user_id": "t9Hr_TZG_ffFUovaACpuOA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Breakfast was good being from out of state looking for a place to eat a good clean place for breakfast."}, {"review_id": "Y1zoZKlesBfUCVztzrI66Q", "user_id": "fM_UsuFAYu2TVUqJiYAKsg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2017", "text": "Real hashbrowns!  They are getting harder and harder to find these days.  This is a classic diner in the heart of downtown Sioux Falls.  Most recent visit was Easter Sunday and we were grateful that they were open.  Typical diner menu, well executed.Only dislike was the iced tea.  Not my fave."}, {"review_id": "fknYLhfns3XxRG4XKkgOkA", "user_id": "zmNtZJGeyuMRcvLBmY0_SA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/17/2016", "text": "Delicious! Who doesn't like a diner? This isn't Denny's and it's not trying too hard. Daily specials like waffles, shakes, and Sunday drink deals. Only saw the breakfast menu but dinner looks extensive with a ton of options. Opted for a burrito since the omelette options seemed lacking. Came out fast and was a great value. Got a small orange juice and it's some of the best juice I've had. Not sure if it was squeezed or food service delivered but it was awesome. Not too sweet or tart. Sat at the counter for that real diner experience. Wait staff were friendly. Kitchen staff jolly. (Worked in many a restaurant and this place has a good customer and internal vibe.) To go orders. Coffee and sweet treats also. Good location and hours of operation. Certainly coming here again for breakfast, lunch, brunch, dinner, or late night eggs and hash browns."}, {"review_id": "CCU7v2-21dKU0ly6AKz-Cw", "user_id": "z0OI4IKDjeq4Td4nJbXdig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "I'm going to give 5 stars because this is my favorite place to frequent while in Sioux Falls (which is a couple of times per month).  However, yesterday, my family didn't have a good experience.  It was a busy Sunday lunch (we get it) and the service was lacking as well as the food.   I had a chicken, bacon and honey mustard wrap that had zero bacon or honey mustard.  Our table of 6 shared TWO waters for the whole table with no refill the time we were there and it took 20 minutes after we were done eating to even get a ticket.  Word of advice: go any other time but Saturday/Sunday brunch.  They have amazing food but apparently have problems, like most places, when slammed."}, {"review_id": "0vZkJ3VphKvPYPbhfQERFw", "user_id": "aalu-4yeIvzZyo0l5xxvOw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "I love coming here for breakfast every time I'm in town.

We came for a weekday lunch and wow this place gets super busy!!My husband had the Reuben and we both really liked it. The Russian dressing on the sandwich was phenomenal. This is a must have sandwich. The mashed potatoes were fine, albeit soupy from too much brown gravy. I had the crispy chicken salad. It was average, although the ranch was a total showstopper. It was the watery, delicious ranch that is the best, and the dressing did not disappoint. The salad itself fell a little flat. Some of the lettuce was a little wilted and the chicken was good, but not super fresh. The service was on point. I felt like the waiter was running totally ragged with a full restaurant, so I wish they would staff more appropriately. Regardless, he was friendly and efficient. All in all, good for a lunch, but not the stand out experience you can have at other places in Sioux Falls."}, {"review_id": "rPRdCOM2PIlcaI26bRgoMA", "user_id": "OAfGfoQ3Tn64Tb18mJslOQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "Enjoyed breakfast at Phillips Diner this morning.

With that said, don't deprive your body - you know you want it. I was surprised to find poutine on the menu here - being in the Midwest and for breakfast, no less. Needless to say, I decided against my usual eggs benny. Crispy potatoes, cheese curds, meat gravy, bacon, diced tomatoes topped with a glistening sunny side-up. The high caloric content is not for the faint of heart but if you come hungry, it will be the most amazing first bite. It is incredibly rich in flavor and texture. Any other option on the menu will be healthier in comparison and, from what I've heard, does not disappoint. But trust me, the breakfast poutine is worth a try - even if it means you'll still be working it off months later. This place seems to be a local favorite and one of the best in Sioux Falls. Plenty of outdoor seating and view is gorgeous on a sunny day. The only negative was pace as we waited 25 mins+ for our food (Saturday ~9:00am). That and the potential weight gain. But no gain no gain, right?"}, {"review_id": "93JR2Xb9KsJRZNU95XTUDA", "user_id": "SHSF2Wj4OmUwygLUfUy8og", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/16/2015", "text": "This was a solid diner in Sioux Falls. I went here for a late brunch around 12:30. The wait was about 25 minutes so my party and I strolled down Phillips street to check out local shops. This place is definitely busy but highly accurate on the wait time. All four of us got different things. Together we had the hot turkey sandwich, breakfast burrito and two kitchen sink burgers. The burgers had fried mac and cheese, meat patties and pork on them. Both my boo and our friend loved it. You get your choice of fries, fruit mix, salad or sweet potato fries. The hot turkey sandwich was pretty standard with turkey gravy and white bread. They also had a beef one that looked pretty good. The breakfast burrito was huge! It came with salsa on top and was stuffed with potatoes, meat, eggs, cheese and other veggies. Everything was really good but being SD not very spicy. We did get two complimentary sundaes for the birthday boys, and I had a special of the month shake. It was a pumpkin pie shake and it was delicious!! Pieces of pie/cookie crust and yummy ice cream with whip cream and a cherry. This diner is super cute with a solid menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner. If you're in Sioux Falls, stop by and eat here."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/phillips-avenue-diner-sioux-falls?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
