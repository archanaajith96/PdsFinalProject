When we walked in we were instantly greeted and told to sit anywhere. The waitress was very sweet, and we felt very welcomed. The kitchen is right in your face. You can see and smell everything. The restaurant iis small and parking is limited. The menu is pretty basic. Nothing crazy or stand out-ish. Just basic diner food. My husband ordered breakfast and I ordered a burger and fries. The breakfast plate was a pretty good sized portion and my husband had no complaints. He said it reminded him of a home cooked meal. My burger was delicious, very tasty. The fries, well seasoned. Overall we had an awesome experience. I would definitely recommend."}, {"review_id": "cwCH6ZCkMg-ertynkrmIRQ", "user_id": "Vjva8LlEib0qRrwP4SKCng", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "As good as it gets for a small breakfast place.

However, what you can expect is in your face, no messing around, straight up diner food. Plain, simple and always good. The biscuits and gravy always hits a home run and their toast (a diner staple) is consistently cook to perfection.

The parking is terrible. Its kind of at an inconvenient location, its cramped inside, there are hardly ever seats readily available......but its literally THE BEST diner in FS.  Even with all the faults Fort Smith seems to flock to this place like its some sort of cult following. Never once have I ever had a bad experience here. And never once have I ever eaten something there that I did not like (But I recommend the Cyclops Burger with the egg over easy) The prices are right. The staff is super friendly (Especially \"Vince The Waiter\") and they are ALWAYS open......I mean ALWAYS.  So if you are out late one night.......Dont go to Dennys.....Dont go to IHOP......Dont go to Waffle House.......Go to Bensons."}, {"review_id": "ktCo6jtP_6iXS8uyK_eD4A", "user_id": "OxWT4R8rbtBzhmwH7qlN_A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "Great food, great service, and I strongly reccomand the \"G.O.T.cha\".

Smith, Arkansas and have a taste for a bite late night or anytime for that matter, make sure that you stop by this hidden gem in town.  A few of my family members and I happened to stop here on Christmas Eve (well after midnight) Christmas morning and decided to go here since it was centrally located to where I was staying as opposed to going across town to go to Denny's.  We walked in and it was pretty full but were able to get seated immediately.  It reminds you of a good old mom and pop diner, so it's not a really big place.  They even have bar space for those who want to sit at the counter.I ended up ordering the Sweet Potato Pancakes as recommended by our waiter and the menu stated it was a Southern Delicacy, so I thought why not give it a try.  Best decision ever!!  These pancakes were so yummy and flavorful that I don't think that I could ever desire a plain pancake again.  It totally changed my taste for them. lol. Seriously, they are good.  I peeped over at some other people's orders and the omelettes looked good, the ham was a ham steak, so you get your money's worth.Our server was so friendly, in fact the whole staff was.  I will definitely stop back through either when I return or am headed out.  Such a delight!"}, {"review_id": "xIBqvlKmN8CTAQuNbcMT0w", "user_id": "wKmF01XhtgFj739gh1JATw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/10/2016", "text": "The best description I've heard of Benson's Grill is, \"typical greasy spoon\".  That really sums it up.  Do you remember the old TV show \"Alice\"?  The show took place in Mel's Diner that was an old truck stop slash diner.  This place is exactly like that.My wife and I pulled into the parking lot, which is no mean feet.  Seriously, did this parking lot use to fit full sized cars before the road was widened or was it built when Model A Fords were all the rage?  It was a fight to get out of the car because the parking spots were so narrow that you couldn't open the door without tipping over the car next to you.After we managed to wedge ourselves out of the car, we headed towards what we thought was the front door.  It was hard to tell through the haze of smoke coming from the three or four people sitting on the bench beside the door.  There was so much smoke that I thought there must be an exhaust vent from the stove right there, or the whole place was on fire.  It was not really the best first impression I've ever gotten from a business.Once inside we looked around and the place looked like something out of the long distant past.  I expected to see men in fedoras sipping a hot cup of Joe while reading the racing forms.  I expected the counter to filled elbow to elbow with young sailors who were trying to make time with their best girl before their shore leave was over.  Instead I saw a whole different group of people.  But then again, now that I think about it, those may have been the same people because everyone in there seemed well worn.  Now, I'm no spring chicken but the youngest customer in the placed had a solid two decades on me (at least).The menu was pretty straightforward.  Just your standard diner fare.  My wife had a biscuit and gravy and I had scrambled eggs, hash browns, and a biscuit and gravy.  You know, the standard stuff.  They were all fine.  It's the same food you'd make at home without throwing in any fancy techniques or spices.Listen, if you want home cooking without having to cook at home then this place is fine.  If you want gourmet food then you may want to move on down the road.  It's as simple as finding a small car, wedging it into the parking lot, taking a deep breath and holding it, running through the cloud of smoke, making your way to a table without bumping another customer and breaking their hip, and enjoying your diner cuisine."}, {"review_id": "UCiTQMrVFAbdcV2m-bBIOg", "user_id": "Oidtv4nPH9Ai_oKDQPMBVw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/6/2016", "text": "Benson grill. I heard that this is a fort smith landmark. When I first entered, my impression is confusion. Why would fort smith make this place \"the\" hangout place. It is just like Waffle House with a different name. Actually, their prices are way more than waffle house.So, with some reservation, I got their biggest burger since I was hungry. I do not remember exactly what that name of it. Big mama or something sexist name like that. After tasting it, I understand the name fully. A mama will keep on eating this until she is big. Good thing, I am not a mama, but I will definitely will keep on eating this.This place is definitely not a Waffle House. This is the place if waffle house decided to improve their food 100X, and I am not even saying that Waffle house is not good.So Fort Smith, you have a great taste.

There are very few places she can eat. Very few places will even try to fix her food. Bensons is not one of those. The staff is good at accommodating her allergies. They are very careful when preparing her food from start to finish. It doesn't matter if they are super busy or very slow. We meet at least twice week here. I know she comes to eat more than that. Her normal order is the #2. It's eggs, hash browns, and toast. I usually order the #3. It is eggs, bacon or sausage, and toast. I would give Bensons a higher rating if I could."}, {"review_id": "p7olOf8_z5oETo2TRNvwGA", "user_id": "MqW49qVpeaxwiRBnQ6FaUQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2017", "text": "Such a great diner!
