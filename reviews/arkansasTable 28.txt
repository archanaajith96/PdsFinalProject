Nice selection of bourbons and whiskeys too. Chef came out when I casually told the bartender I wasn't a fan of the cauliflower ~ really good human being orchestrating the food. Great place. I will be back for more delicious food. HH 4-6:30pm. Doesn't look it from the outside but plenty of seating and great atmosphere within.Highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "pn65JqHB0guBe_SU2-01Hw", "user_id": "Wtqs33i70BpWFzlOlL5hfg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "Went to Table 28 for my the birthday of the wife.  She took her friend with us and we decided to take the advice of a friend and head to this restaurant. I am very pleased we did. I had the ribeye, the wife had scallops and her friend had some chicken dish. My ribeye was cooked perfectly (very rare) was well marbled and had a great flavor. The scallops were seared perfectly and just done well enough to be translucent. I tried a bite and they were fresh and firm. They were actually perfect. The small disappointing moment was at dessert. We each had something different and they were far from remarkable, as a matter of fact, they were not very good at all. That didn't overshadow the perfectly prepared main dishes and the well-prepared sides. The bone marrow app was very good and perfectly prepared and presented. The brussel sprouts were well prepared and mildly salted.The drinks were exceptional so I was told since I was the DD I had soda. Was a very good experience overall, the waiter was stellar and attentiveI would recommend Table 28 for any special event, as a bill $250 for three is a bit much for an everyday dining out experience."}, {"review_id": "ARysIbxLIESIg4V0HuirpA", "user_id": "gVwkZ4bVbYScl6-82p4C2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/26/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This continues to be one of the best restaurants in Little Rock - last night the service was exceptionally perfect.

It's inside the Burgundy Hotel which is a hip/posh hotel or at least trys to be near West Little Rock. We got sat by the hostess then a guy filled our water and we waited for 7 minutes (we almost got up and left). Finally the bartender came over and said our waiter was late and he had to take our order. Classy.Told us the Artichoke was gluten free, how ever not the pita but did bring out some carrot slices instead which didn't pair at all but still was a thoughtful gesture, the artichoke dip itself was very good. I chose the Beef Filet Tenderloin which came with carrot fries and parsnip. It was tasty, nothing super special however was a decent piece of beef. Lady had the Meatloaf and enjoyed hers as well. I'd prob order something different next time since the steak quality for $38 is not justified in the quality of beef that was served. We had a few cocktails, nothing to rave about. I'd come back here after exploring the rest of Little Rock's culinary scene, maybe we went on an off night, however the atmosphere was awesome."}, {"review_id": "ssUXoLSC2q7JECF_xR3XyQ", "user_id": "NyeYkR7ej-7vQDk4HIsZmw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "The food is really great.

We received friendly, attentive yet unobtrusive service. I ordered from the prix fixe menu. Starting with the butter lettuce wedge, the salad arrived dressed wth two dressings, fried onions and tomatoes. It was very flavorful, and a tad heavy on the dressings and other topping.Next up was the calamari schnitzel with whipped potatoes and greens. I was a bit disappointed with this dish, particularly with rubbery-tasting instant mashed potatoes accompanying. That's right. Instant. Mashed. Potatoes. The gooey toffee cake was a pleasant ending to the meal, but not particularly inspired. Reading all the stellar reviews of this place, I think I should have chosen my selection differently, or maybe veered away from prix fixe."}, {"review_id": "FMPJ6cU0MHwMBooDCpr_2A", "user_id": "9cYqUOt-Aa6vowRhPPUgDg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/22/2016", "text": "One of my few 5-star reviews, but Table 28 earned it. I was passing through town and asked some old college classmates to meet me here. I started at the bar while waiting for people to arrive. The bartender, Alex, was excellent; Just the right amount of attention without being overbearing. He takes his cocktails seriously and it shows. I had a Booker's Manhattan and I knew it would be good when he accurately measured ingredients and then stirred (and stirred and stirred). When my guests arrived we moved to the table where we got very good service. Our waiter walked us through the new fall menu, made sure we were good on drinks, then left us to discuss the choices. When we were ready to order, he appeared immediately. I started with the ribeye carpaccio, served with thinly sliced manchego, capers, a spritz of lemon, and crostini. Such a simple dish, but executed perfectly. S started with the tuna poké, which was served in a cocktail glass and had some of the biggest pieces of tuna I've ever seen in a poké. This was served with taro chips and the flavor was sublime. I don't know if the chef used mirin, but it tasted like he did. M had the sweet potato soup, served with cinnamon creme fraiche, to start. It must have been  good because the bowl was empty very quickly. Between courses, I ordered a bottle of Belle Glos Pinot Noir. For dinner, I had the surf and turf, which in this interpretation consisted of perfectly cooked scallops served over a mound of greens and pork belly and surrounded by the biggest butter beans I've ever seen. Here's an example of where the chef stands out. The beans, tasted separately, were phenomenal. When combined with the scallops, greens, and pork belly, both the texture and flavor of the beans added to the overall enjoyment. Definitely not a random afterthought. S had the shrimp scampi served with spaghetti squash. M had the calamari schnitzel, and I'm still trying to figure out how they pounded out and shaped the calamari to look like a regular flat schnitzel. Both dishes looked great and got rave reviews, but I didn't try either one. I was too full for dessert, but both M and S asked for scoops of gelato that were mentioned as components of other desserts. Our waiter had no problem accommodating them. One of the best meals I've had in a long time, and clearly the best in Little Rock."}, {"review_id": "2Ra146lBmThFEqmXOMvtsQ", "user_id": "QSb2-cS3L8R0gJU8TSHZWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/29/2017", "text": "This is probably one of the nicest steak houses in Arkansas and seems to be sort of little known except for a few locals it seems.

Given that Table 28 is filling the space of other restaurants with great reputations, I was expecting a lot from this restaurant. Of course, this type of expectation isn't logical, or necessarily fair, but this location has been magic for past entities. So, I was more than excited to try Table 28.Before diving into details, let me confirm that Table 28 far surpassed my heightened expectations. In short, I think this was one of the very best dining experiences I've had in Little Rock, in quite a few years.So, so many Little Rock restaurants start with a lot of hype and leave so many patrons absolutely deflated (Kemuri and Cashe are two that seem to always get rave reviews, yet always seem to leave me disappointed. Nonetheless, I continue to give both \"another chance\"). Table 28 has what so many of these other restaurants lack...and so much more. I am rarely without words, but I am finding it difficult to adequately articulate just how FINE this dining experience was, for me and a few friends.First, the restaurant is just incredibly comfortable. The minute I walked into the restaurant, it felt welcoming. It just has an ambiance that is warm, relaxed, classy but not intimidating. Second, service is also very professional, thorough, but not pushy. I am ashamed to say that I forgot our servers name, but his lever of service was so impeccably perfect (not at all overbearing) that I will go back to T28, just to get his name!The tableside service of our waiter was precise and much appreciated. It wasn't over done or pretentious, like placing the patron's napkin in the lap...that is a bit much. But, while I handled my own napkin, the service was from the proper side, napkin used while serving wine (to prevent splashing), service never interrupted conversation and conversations with our server were pleasant and informative. The staff (server, Et. al) knew the menu well, knew the food and drink of the restaurant, very well. No one placated our table with mindless platitudes or comments that suggested any unfamiliarity with any item on the menu. Rather, responses were very specific and exhibited a staff that is well trained and versed to represent the menu they serve.And, given how intriguing Table 28's menu is, we had many challenging questions about the fare...along with drink pairings.In short, our experience was first and foremost comfortable. Second, it was exceptionally stimulating and satiated every one of our weighted expectations.Table 28 could very well be THE very best restaurant in this restaurant rich community. I can not wait to return for my next meal!BRAVISSIMO!!!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/table-28-little-rock?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
