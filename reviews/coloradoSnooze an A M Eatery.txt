So here it goes:Hot Cake Diva's pancake of the day review:Berry Zesty. Yes it's zesty if you're into that but the Diva isn't. Not on a pancake. The yogurt added a sourness to it and the dried bananas. Too healthy for my taste. Haha. If you're into this type of concoction then go for it. This guy wasn't. Sorry Snooze.  Still love ya!!!!  I give it a sad face. . The chef Bryce made me a concoction for my side of ham which is amazing!!!  And again props to my Snooze family for the great service they give all who enter their doors.   And military discount on the whole check!!"}, {"review_id": "dAMpPM3E8-kgP7mWdsVocQ", "user_id": "77STTiXFySEFv0wtqc0Exg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I had heard of this place before as we have one locally in CA that I have not been to.  I sent my wife in to put our names in while I drove around looking for a parking spot.  All the designated parking spaces were filled up so I grabbed a spot on the street.  I brought the family here and stepped into a groovy retro diner that has a 60's vibe to it.  There is counter seating available as well as tables and booths.  Music is playing from the speakers above but it is not too loud so that you can still have a conversation.We had about a short 10 minute wait on a weekday.  We sure showed up at the right time because there was a huge line outside when we left.  I ordered a pancake flight with a side of belly bacon, my son ordered a pancake flight, my daughter ordered a B.E.A.T. sandwich and my wife ordered a soup and sandwich combo with the tomato soup.The food took a while but the pancake flights looked amazing.  My pancake flight consisted of pineapple upside-down, Sum'oa cakes and blueberry danish.  They all tasted great.  My belly bacon was not impressive at all.  It was regular bacon, not thick cut and burned to a crisp.  The bacon was the worst part of my meal.  Everyone liked their food and the service was good.  I was interested in the French Toast with mascarpone cream but will have to try that in CA.  This place was expensive but most of the places I visited in Denver were. I enjoyed my meal and will visit the CA location.  3.5 stars!"}, {"review_id": "Ohm4Qad1tyn_BFMkcdnkmA", "user_id": "hMCdGj-5RFcMkCA4bE28Cg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Pretty cool place to start your day! On our last day on a recent trip to Denver, my wife and I ventured with my sister to Snooze near downtown. Coming from NYC where there's a good diner practically around every corner, a place like Snooze (that serves breakfast all day) is a must (and I absolutely love the name).When we arrived for lunch on a Monday afternoon, we found a 25 minute wait. No problem... Snooze gives complimentary water and COFFEE while you wait!! There's also corn hole outside for those wanting to pass the time (if perhaps you've already read all the Yelp reviews for this place and taken a gander at the menu). After about 20 minutes, we received a text that our table was ready (gotta love places that conveniently text you updates).We sat down and were greeted by a friendly server who took our drink orders (I opted for coffee and was definitely pleased: good diner-quality coffee). We also received waters, but for some reason all of our glasses had dish detergent floating in them (kinda gross but could have been dirt I suppose). We let our waitress know and she apologized before bringing us some new glasses (sans dish detergent).I had a lot of trouble deciding on my entree (so many great choices on the menu) but ultimately opted for the Snooze Classic, complete with three farm-fresh cage-free eggs, bacon (can also choose ham, sausage, pulled pork, soyrizo or chorizo), hash browns and toast. Others ordered some similar egg/omelette options (next time I come back I have to try the pancakes... they look insanely delicious).About 15 minutes after ordering, our food came to the table. Everything looked delicious and ready for consumption. The only issue? My sister has a dairy allergy (it was very clearly discussed when ordering) but her meal came out with toast slathered in butter, eggs cooked with butter and hash browns cooked with butter. The staff did the right thing here, though. They apologized profusely (it was perhaps the most sincere apology I've seen at a restaurant), whipped up a fresh order (totally dairy-free) and comped the meal. Mistakes happen... the important thing is how you deliver service recovery... and this staff certainly delivered.Would I visit Snooze on a future visit? Absolutely! It was a great meal and a terrific experience! Everyone was very pleased."}, {"review_id": "34BYwHP8r9mKEJBFvqsWfg", "user_id": "u_-cB2Qt5_3BSiF8znsHqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I'm not a huge breakfast fan but I will happily wait the up to two hours to get a seat at any of their locations. The wait is well worth it, and there will always be a significant wait on the weekends. They don't do reservations but when you show up your name gets put on a list and they'll text you when your table is almost ready. But it's nice that they have water/coffee set up while you wait and sometimes they'll have games like Jenga or corn hole set up outside. The servers are excellent and always very friendly. Would highly recommend the breakfast tacos and mimosas or bloody Mary's! Update: This place is awesome for vegans. The servers are very knowledgeable and willing to make modifications even though they aren't listed on the menu. Anything with eggs can be subbed for tofu scramble and meats can be replaced with their soyrizo. Just ask for no cheese and the substitutions and several items on the menu can easily be made vegan."}, {"review_id": "hglC8d1Y9MZn3iamHY0NbA", "user_id": "GG5s5T1Q9JNf967r7SKnIA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "We've attempted to eat at Snooze a few times and have always been turned off by the 90-minute wait.  However, we decided to give it another shot knowing 1:30 on a Weds afternoon is likely not peak time.  It wasn't and we were seated immediately.My guys ordered some chocolate pancake thing that the waiter described as \"like a Boston Creme Pie\".  Uh...yum!  I ordered their breakfast burrito which, no lie, was as big as my head.  It had egg, potato, black beans, bacon (at my request) and arrived smothered in cheese and green chili.  It was fantastic!  (I only ate 1/3rd of it and brought home some fab leftovers.)The service was very friendly and our meal arrived fairly quickly.Still not sure I'd want to wait 90 minutes to eat here, but otherwise, who can say no to breakfast in the afternoon?  Not this gal."}, {"review_id": "iOQ47rvC7dNANmpEO9FT0w", "user_id": "PFA6aBQ5yGnY8ccNcGde4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "Snooze was the first restaurant I ate at after moving to Denver. I think I have eaten here at least once a week since then. The food is awesome, and I can say that having tried several different options. The Pancake of the Day is cool to try something new and on our last visit it was a savory Potato Pancake with Whipped Chive Sour Cream (delicious). I also really liked the Blueberry Lemon Danish Pancakes. The coffee bar makes excellent Lattes and other coffee drinks. The restaurant does get very busy, especially at peak breakfast/brunch times. The wait times are improved by free coffee and Cornhole games out front for people in line.

I don't necessarily understand the hype of Snooze. Really. I don't. However, I will say the service is always above and beyond. I only come to Snooze when friends and family from out of town come to visit me in Denver. And it's always the one restaurant that everyone has heard of. The most recent excursion to Snooze was this week on a cold and rainy day with my cousin. Our wait was only fifteen minutes, and we ordered immediately. I always get the spud deluxe because I LOVE potatoes (but refuse to cook them at home. I'm addicted). We were brought two free pancakes. Is this a ploy to get high ratings on yelp?  Well, it works.You want a typical brunch wait? Go here.

I ordered the Sandwich I Am, and the Bacon and Eggs cocktail. I subbed the sausage in the sandwich for bacon (bacon is always better). The smoked cheddar hollandaise is the most delicious thing I've had in a long time. Tatiana was our server, and she was a delight! So personable and had perfect timing. She also sent a birthday pancake over (also SO delicious), which was the perfect addition to my savory breakfast. I will definitely be back!!"}, {"review_id": "YEoUvatcZSEdHErkSeXMmQ", "user_id": "itJY0KTKhKPI0DCnythNhA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Stopped in for lunch on the way out of Denver on a recommendation from a friend and was not disappointed. To start the staff was awesome, very inviting and even for a colder day the heated outdoor patio was perfect seating. I got the Eggs Benedict duo with the Bella! Bella! Benny, and the Benny Goldman with the Refried Black Beans as a side and a house made hot chocolate, all for about $16. The beans is where I started and was impressed by the bold fresh taste of them. Then moving on to the Benny's I will say that the duo is probably the best way to go if you want a full experience, they both had delicious yet very distinct flavors. The Benny Goodman was my favorite, it had this robust and in your face flavor that is awesome. The Bella! Bella! Benny was close with a delicious yet much more subtle flavor. It came with a little arugula salad on the side with no dressing which to be honest was a great mop for the remnants of Eggs Benny left behind.The coffee was great that my wife had but the Hot chocolate was the clear winner. Having not as much of a heavy chocolate flavor as normal but still getting everything across. All in all a great experience and would gladly go again!"}, {"review_id": "2jceEYepB7_QjX_spa2S2A", "user_id": "1wczELPSkBBbURwOKBqMGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Very spunky and eclectic neighborhood brunch place in the middle of the Denver University neighborhood.

Free coffee and games if you need some entertainment while you wait for your table. They text you when your table is just about ready. The wait staff are always insanely friendly. But the real thing I want to talk about is the food. I've never been to a place that has such consistently delicious food. Their burritos are \"as big as Detroit,\" as my boyfriend likes to say, the hash browns are crispy and well-made, and the pancakes... oh, the pancakes. So far we've had three pancakes in our two trips here (two of which were on the house), and they've all been perfectly cooked, moist, with incredible texture and toppings. They're truly the best pancakes I've ever had the pleasure of eating. I can't recommend this place enough. If you're a breakfast person, you can't afford to miss this place. Note: they're constantly packed. At 11am on a Thursday morning we had about a fifteen minute wait for a table for two. On the weekends, plan to come well before you get hungry, because the wait can be upwards of an hour."}, {"review_id": "PDOi3E55Vk7stE49pzXiQw", "user_id": "keKb8dtPlij583NmsYg8QQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "A friend of mine who lives in Denver picked me up at my hotel and took me here for breakfast.  Let me just say, this place is ridiculous.  The menu is extensive, I mean confusingly extensive, but the food is completely on point.  My advice is to listen to the waitress and to try a half-and-half deal so you can try more than one type of item from their menu.  I ordered the Chile Verde Benedict and I'm certainly glad I did.  The Green Chili was fantastic, I know its a bit sacrilegious but I wasn't overly impressed with the hash browns.  They were good, but I've certainly had better.  The Bourbon Street Pumpkin Pancakes were extremely tasty.  The pecans on top added a great crunch and the Bourbon pecan jam was sweet and tangy.  Due to the lack of Splenda, I ended up going with Diet Coke, but that was a small price to pay for a fantastic breakfast."}, {"review_id": "PVWEVxCqXph8j_zKrAljSQ", "user_id": "v71kpP24V2kil5s6Wg0ASA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/20/2017", "text": "I haven't gotten a chance to try snooze because the wait is always absurd over the weekends.

The restaurant came recommended to me and when I saw it was a chain I almost didn't go. Thank god I did!!At first we got a free pancake that was made from heaven. It had fresh berries, short bread crumbles,Lavender cream and some other heavenly things.  Wow. Just wow. What we couldn't figure out is if they tell everyone they get a free pancake of the day or if we were just that special. If they do that with everyone to make them feel that way, I love that!For breakfast I did the Benny duo of eggs Benedict which are not typically my thing but holy mackerel they were amazing. I got the Bella Bella with the prosciutto and the Chile verde one. Both were incredible! The only reason I gave 4 stars was because of the hour wait. Don't get me wrong it was worth the Wait butttt that part was no bueno. I almost left to go somewhere else but so glad I didnt!

The sandwich I am is tasty as it comes on a pretzel bun and the cheddar hollandaise is next level awesome! I love the spuds because you can literally build it to your liking and it's super filling!

Let your customers call ahead and get put on the wait list. We should have gone elsewhere once we found out we couldn't make a reservation or call ahead, but we took a chance, and waited an hour on a weekday for two. They at least have a free coffee area while you wait? But while you wait...it's loud. People crowd around. Babies cry. Servers are flustered. Surprisingly, our food came up pretty quickly except was somehow cold. I had the breakfast tacos: cold tortillas, cold potatoes, cold eggs. My companion had the corn beef hash which was salty, greasy, and a small portion. We were seated in the close-in patio which is not half as cool as the actual restaurant decor.Update: After leaving this review a staff member tried to harass me via this platform and I had to report them. Then, a manager also contacted me to offer I come back, on them, to give them another chance. I am not going to take them up on this offer.
