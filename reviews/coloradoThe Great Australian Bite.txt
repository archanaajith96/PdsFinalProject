He drives by for work everyday but, I'm not a super adventurous eater. I was honestly surprised at how delicious it was! We even went back for another pie to share! We ended up with a Beef&Cheese, Original, and chicken Curry. I wanted to run outside and tell all of the high schoolers going to the surrounding locations to come in here instead. That's how good. We decided that we will definitely be using the take and bake option in the future!"}, {"review_id": "l6wg4XyZU2Cr4IaXN3FZ4w", "user_id": "J2hpys67YGGDrGCS-HEJNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "Pleasantly surprised finding this place and learning that they have actual meat pies!!!! Oh how i have longed for a good meat pie! Even though they were not as good as the South African meat pies, still worth the trip! I was slightly disappointed by the chicken curry pie but the sides more than made up for it. The original pie is fantastic! Will be back!"}, {"review_id": "xrpMZrrAS26FiJu6bz4zIg", "user_id": "tbF8J-eHbeEZSxhPX80V2w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "Small little treasure! The location is easy to find, service was top notch and friendly. Display cases were clean and inviting, tables clean and comfy, bathrooms also clean and well kept. The decor was very welcome on a cold Saturday night. Vibrant prints of Australia and animals, gorgeous! Now for the main event, the meat pies, oh my! They had several on offer, they are perfectly golden brown with the right amount of crispiness. Each pie has it's own unique little cut out on it, the owner informed us it was their handy way to tell them apart. We ordered a beef and mushroom and chicken curry pie (recommended by the staff). We also got a sausage roll, mashed potatoes and gravy and my husband got a Fosters on tap. Cutting into the pies was an experience all it's own, very flavorful and enticing. The Beef and Mushroom was the perfect mix of ground beef, mushrooms and onions, my very picky 1 year old loved it. It was also very  good with the mashed potatoes and beef gravy. The sausage roll was so perfectly spiced and amazing, we could have had a meal of just those! The chicken curry was just the right amount of curry flavor added to the traditional chicken pot pie flavors. If you can't tell we were in love with our meals. They were the perfect portions for two adults and a one year old to share. They were friendly and came out to chat with the patrons, they even allowed our little guy to walk around and check things out. He's a flirt and ate up all the attention! We will be back soon!"}, {"review_id": "NQ-Cz2MG9L7O5bwtZpk5fw", "user_id": "noY3yU_h40qeo-hkXGb4CA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/5/2017", "text": "Holy koala this is a delicious restaurant! The owner is so cheerful and helpful, she is a delight to be around. Every dish we tried was superbly made with care and utterly scrumptious! I had this place bookmarked and when I got into the area I had to stop by. I had the curry chicken pie, it was mild and had perfectly cooked pieces of slightly shredded chicken breast in it and a variety of vegetables. The crust was both flakey and crisp and tender and doughy in places! P e r f e c t i o n!I had a side of mushy peas one day and mashed potatoes with gravy on another day, both were really nice. The potatoes seemed like real potatoes and the peas had a creamy and peppery flavor.My bother got the beef and cheese pie. It's filling tasted a lot like sloppy Joe's with American cheese on top...and we were told the beef and tomato was very similar but no cheese. Very unique and delicious comfort food!Now that I have been able to sample the offerings I will be looking for reasons to stop by and think it's worth the drive over here on its own merits! 10/10 would recommend!"}, {"review_id": "fbYIHrSMiWCJjvJRlV8Xkg", "user_id": "8rVXu-EN9iK8zrOxTUia7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Omg, I love this restaurant.

My wife ordered the steak and onion meat pie and I had the original meat pie. We both ordered the mashed potatoes and gravy and a Bundaberg root beer. My original meat pie was a wonderful mix of ground beef and a gravy of tomato and slightly spicy heartiness. The mashed potatoes and gravy were wonderful! My wife was skeptical about the restaurant but she loved her steak and onion pie so much she finished her meal before me! It was a cold windy day this day and the meat pies and potatoes were a perfect cold day food! The owner was very helpful in explaining what each pie was. Hopefully the next time we go I will try the kangaroo meat pie!"}, {"review_id": "lykGE002Gz84OZHbPu40Sw", "user_id": "d6HqHX-L5ooVjlVMqRlJFA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "Australian food is very tasty!

My wife and I came in for lunch today and the lady behind the counter greeted us with a smile and explained everything to us, it was great.  The atmosphere was nice, everything was clean and the menu while not huge has plenty of options and great descriptions of each item. We had the beef and cheese, the original, and the chicken curry pies. The pies were outstanding and the sausage roll was amazing as well. For dessert we had a chocolate caramel slice that tasted great too. We will definitely be back, and can't wait to tell our friends about this hidden gem."}, {"review_id": "_Z5iIWfm5iylBIDkbE78rQ", "user_id": "rtoaj_A3lUra4-zmJWQ5uQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/22/2017", "text": "I was super excited to come here and try the kangaroo pie. When we arrived, the shelf for these pies were empty - kinda disappointing since it was noon and I had imagined they would have a full assortment of options out and ready at that time. The pie choices were pretty limited so I ended up going with the chicken curry pie and mushy peas.First off, the pies are tiny! The big flaky crust on top is somewhat deceiving - the pie tin is actually super small which made the pie mostly crust with a very small portion of actual filling inside. The chicken curry and the the vegetables did have a nice flavor, it just would have been nice to have more. Same goes for the mushy peas. They tasted good, but again, it was a very small scoop for $1.50. Also, the pies all sit in a warming case - as expected, my pie was only warm when I ate it and a little dry. The food was tasty, and different than your run of the mill lunch options, but my group definitely left hungry and disappointed."}, {"review_id": "i7xRVV2s7qHN6AFPwenVgg", "user_id": "yuW95jpipnokAZ97cESZUg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/27/2017", "text": "I had to stop in and try the kangaroo. Oh well that was an fail :( . Due to the restrictions on kangaroo meat thanks didn't have any in stock. But my amazing hostess told me about all the other great pies. So I ended up doing the original meat pie. Omg I'm in love the crust was super crispy and nicely flavored. The meat was seasoned great. I had to try and eat it like an Aussie so I had a side of Ketchup recommend by the hostess. Since I came during opening I was there only one here. The place is really clean. Nice country tunes playing in the background. A must visit if you're looking for some nice comfort food."}, {"review_id": "OKo4jFCUb1hobVWg87zhXw", "user_id": "7dPnpLtowm67k5Czbz5G7A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Food was great and service was friendly.  I got the steak and onion, wife got beef and cheese and the kids got chicken and veggies.  Everything was delicious- and was just enough to fill me up.  Wife tried the mushy peas And she loved them.  For desert we shared a custard pie and the cake.

This is much more than a pot pie! They make everything from scratch daily and it shows in the taste.The crust is wonderful, flaky, and fresh! It has a delectable buttery flavor and it just out of this world. The gravy must be made with some sort of magic because it's truly magnificent. Such a unique experience. The prices are reasonable and one meat pie fills me up. The sides are really inexpensive and tasty if you're extra hungry. They also offer an assortment of candy, desert, and other items from Australia (including Vegemite) which I haven't tried. The staff is really friendly and the restaurant is always clean. Great spot for lunch.Make sure you show up early if you want the kangaroo, because they only make so many per day."}, {"review_id": "MoTblwILnAPRH1al2--PWg", "user_id": "TZ6q9kDzHnOr2liJIs6DXw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "Great food, good service. 3 pies and 2 drinks $27!
