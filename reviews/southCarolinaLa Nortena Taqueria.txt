We got lunch here on a recent Sunday. The place was completely packed but somehow the acoustics were such that the noise wasn't overwhelming? It felt cozy and relaxing. The service was friendly and quick. The menu had a ton of options and a kids section too. I loved trying all the different salsas that come with the complimentary chips. Learn from my erroneous ways- don't wait years to eat here! Let your ingrained FOMO guide you to La Nortena."}, {"review_id": "A5XVSu_R69PRnoCBFnEmFQ", "user_id": "lWOjMHX5qkIa1frJhEy7gw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "My husband loves this place.They give you several salsa options to go with your chips, etc. so you get some variety there.Their menu has a little more variety than other local Mexican places, so that is a nice change.The restaurant seems to be kept decently clean and the staff is usually friendly. As far as the food is concerned, the portions are large and are good price point. Everything we have tried has been freshly made and pretty tasty. It definitely helps that you can get more variety and different options here than at other similar restaurants in the area."}, {"review_id": "a2vLhCXBax9HEcYMNvIgWA", "user_id": "yHff8ZtHP_v2EJ8aFSmkgQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/19/2018", "text": "I went here with a very large work group for a weekday lunch. I was impressed, they handled our group with ease. We had plentiful chips and salsa with lots of refills (yes we were a very hungry group!). Tons of menu options. The meals were all big and offered plenty for the price. I was immensely impressed with my veggie burrito. In fact, I was only able to finish half! It was massive and flavorful and as a vegetarian I had plenty to chose from. The whole group enjoyed their meals and they got our food out quickly despite there being something like twelve people. They were also great about a few of us who had to duck out early. No mishaps, mix ups, or unhappy people. I'd highly recommend them."}, {"review_id": "twMaTJqA1pt300uGRP5Hnw", "user_id": "r2U9MwhLQt1gasp8ts4iAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Best cheese steak burrito in town!

It's not your average Mexican. As expected, the menu is way too big, but once you find your favorite you'll be good to go. I work near by, so this is a common lunch choice. It has been a favorite for years.The staff are always working together and check in often - borderline too often. They are always helpful and consistent in their excellent service.

Fajita salad is great and we love the fajitas that have bacon in them!!5 salsas and nachos are always warm and tasty. This is my local favorite Mexican spot. Management is always in house and employees really seem to enjoy themselves.

In my experience in Charleston I have had some of the worst Mexican food; UNTIL NOW! I just discovered La Nortena and it blew me away. The food was as good if not better than what I have had in Mexico and San Diego. I had been reading reviews about La Nortena for a while and decided to give it a try last night. The restaurant is nice and the service is great here; as soon as we sat down our server came over and took our drink order and gave us a couple of menus. The chips and salsa were great that she brought back, but the sauces that come out with them were awesome; just like you would get at a Mexican restaurant in Mexico. For dinner we ordered the beef chimichanga and a steak & sausage burrito; both were delicious and full of flavor. This place is as close to authentic as you can get in Charleston. Food was great, service was great, drinks were great, restaurant overall was great. This place rocks!"}, {"review_id": "vDbrDx4wdJ8aqZ4nrP_4dQ", "user_id": "BPGPatKUnXDR5UOzJzmvPg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/19/2018", "text": "I moved to South Carolina 6 months ago and during this time I have yet to find authentic Mexican food or tacos for that matter, until today!

The food itself wasn't that impressive. If you want a California burrito, then do it, otherwise save your money and go to Tiki Taco for a bang for your buck, really good food and good service. I think the experience here would've been better if the server didn't seem like we had just pissed him off. He was very short with us, and to be quite frank, he was rude. Some waitresses on the way out seemed to be quite angry too. I honestly am not sure what happened, if we came on a bad day/time or if everyone is just genuinely upset here.

I am in love!!! This place is CONSISTENTLY delicious, AND it's so hard to find a salsa that doesn't have a heavy onion and cilantro taste in Charleston!!!!!!! Not only does their salsa pass the test, they give you four small samples of other salsas that you can try and ask for more of (at no extra charge). I recommend the creamy green one, which tastes like poblano peppers and is really spicy (my favorite). In addition, to add another morsel of information for my onion-hating comrades out there, the chimichanga with steak comes without onions AND the \"salad\" that comes on the plate also has NO onions (or scallions). I died and went to heaven. The price point is worth it for the flavor and quality of food you receive.

I came here based off previous reviews. It was pretty darn good. The serving sizes are huge! Two people in my party had burritos and one had a torda loca. All meals had great flavor and ingredients. The staff was very friendly and very fast. They also give to go drinks which I LOVE! Some cons: the cheese dip/sauce was very thin and lacking some flavor. Rice doesn't come with any burrito when other local places do. The rice over was very \"commercial.\" It was rice I could buy in the store and make. When I eat at a Mexican place I expect some rice that would compare to authentic Mexican home cooking.

Did not expect this.Trying something different from the BBQ scene, coworkers and I went here for lunch. Now, as I am now a resident San Diegoan, I now need to try all the Mexican food. And this joint did not disappoint!On the edge of Hangry, I flew past the tacos (although those are my benchmark) and perused the burritos. The Seafood burrito looked great, so I ordered that... Then came across the Seafood Fajita, which was everything (shrimp, scallops, octopus, squid) AND it came with chicken.Scratch that. Let's do these fajitas.If you follow my reviews, you know I'm a struggling Paleo, but I keep pretty close to the nutrition (i.e., eat the meat & veggies, no grains). The quintessential sizzling skillet arrived at the table on its wooden plank and was still cooking right before me.Loaded with cheese, I knew this was going to be amazing. And it WAS.I tore into the platter, careful not to burn the roof of my mouth (like I have so many times before with deliciously hot food). The melty cheese reminded me of Giordano's deep dish pizza (if you're from Chicago, you know what I'm talking about). I kept going and shoveling but stopped myself, because it is a LARGE portion.So far, I'm impressed with Mexican food down here!"}, {"review_id": "TiDOzmCpdvYdGYFGLGM6Vw", "user_id": "YLpDfqgnFf3JfnAQuV73Tw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/19/2017", "text": "I have eaten at many Mexican restaurants in Charleston. I ate for lunch cause it was closeby and not packed. I really wasn't expecting much just really wanted some tacos Al pastor and this place was a great choice. All the staff was very accommodating and kind. Drinks were filled without running out and trying to hunt down a waiter, salsa and chips were delicious and the Spanish rice is THE best Spanish rice I've had in Charleston. It's fluffy, moist and packs a lot of flavor. The portions are HUGE here but everything was so good I cleaned my entire plate.I really think this place is the most authentic Mexican you can get in North Charleston but that's just me.  I have many other things I want to try so since it's about 5 minutes away I'll be browsing their menu quite often. Btw tacos are worth it especially if you're looking for the traditional type with lengua or tripe..:really mouth watering! You really can't go wrong here."}, {"review_id": "TdaujAhnLdUpzBH0M11bXg", "user_id": "PX9bwc7WgE5Dcdjz-VQWCw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/25/2017", "text": "On business trip trying different places out every day while in town.
