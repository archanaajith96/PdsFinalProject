So you should come here, too. The food at Georges is just as good as the food I had in Paris, and it's always packed, so get a reservation. In some ways, you don't feel like you're in Wichita when you're at Georges. But with excellent Midwestern service that isn't pretentious, it's the perfect combo with world class food. I always get the chicken paillard, my husband gets the steak au poivre, and we like to split the French onion soup. The Parisien cheese dip is also delicious. And the house red wine is quite good."}, {"review_id": "Ckhbsld5rNKxyaSZ-_Y-6g", "user_id": "dEN0lzaATPQOKuu687nAKg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Food is great and staff are very friendly and helpful. I love the design and decor of the place, especially the bar! It really does feel like a Parisian bistro. The food is fundamentally French but well adapted for the mid-western palate.Reservations are recommended, but my husband and I usually don't have a problem finding a seat at the bar within a reasonable amount of time when we don't have a reservation.Favorite dishes are the bouillabaisse, skate fish, and steak frites."}, {"review_id": "O7C_Hlq9UOp7s3iT1mvfhQ", "user_id": "_aCMWUgPipzP7Af-_mG-jg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "My good friend picked this restaurant for her birthday dinner. I called ahead to make reservations for 11 and two kids. At first I wanted a private room but they said it would cost so we just opted for a table for 11. When we got there we were seated immediately and our table was ready. Our waiter was very attentive and very helpful. For starters we ordered the mussels and frittes. The sauce was very garlicky and the mussels was very flavorful. It also came with bread. For dinner I ordered the gran-mere chicken. My friend recommended it and I enjoyed it. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. The potatoes were seasoned perfectly. It also came with asparagus. My husband ordered the lyonnaise pork and he enjoyed it also. Overall the food was great, service was wonderful, and the restaurant was beautifully decorated. I would recommend this place to a friend!"}, {"review_id": "JpQ--f0u804WrV5r9QDtYw", "user_id": "Zy-TvU89UV9J1gG_3SVH5A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Lovely food and service.

This was a the first French bistro we have ever experienced, and was probably the best experience at an establishment that my husband and I have ever experienced. We were seated right away. Even though we were 15 min early. The staff were perfect. Our waiter (I unfortunately can't remember his name to give him credit ) was outstanding! He mentioned the special which was: Hard crusted salmon on cauliflower puree, sauteed squash, and spinach. I (the pickiest water I know) hates cauliflower and squash. The only thing I knew about cauliflower  puree is that the chefs on \"Top Chef\" love to make it all the time! Nevertheless, I went on limb and ordered it anyway. The chef made me a believer of cauliflower puree and sauteed squash that night. I ate the hell out of my dinner, short of licking the plate clean. My husband ordered the 8oz sirloin with asparagus and potatoes. He loved it and said it was the first steak he's ever eaten from a restaurant that didn't require A1! Lol! After dinner we had the Opera cake for desert and that was absolutely delicious!!!Bottom line: BEST EXPERIENCE, top quality for the price you pay. Will definitely return and would definitely recommend!"}, {"review_id": "-TAMfbESsZrh1b2Nwa00dQ", "user_id": "RJxItjD1rAYkhhk82OqA3A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "Absolutely delightful.

I never had seen it before renovations, but it's beautiful now! We got there early before dinner rush/reservations. The calamari appetizer was probably the best I've had, sooo very tender. I had the steak & frites which was delicious!!! Steak was wonderful, perfect cooked and tender. Sauce was nice too! Of course the fries were amazingly! My mom had a scallop dish, oh my- so awesome!! Really nice dinner all around. Dessert I had creme brûlée which was perfect, every bite! Mom had the banana fosters crepe, which I of course had to try. It was great! They really did amazing on the desserts, neither was overly sweet but had that perfect balance. Staff was amazing, of course. Enthusiastic and very helpful! Manager type guy even checked in on us. Our main waiter was wonderful. The whole experience made it a great night. Beautiful, even the patio looks awesome.

The service was great and the food was phenomenal. My friend has the chicken paillard which she really enjoyed. I had the trout which was really great too. The trout was tasty and crisply pan fried. We had calamari which was ok. It was thick slices so not your usual crispy calamari. The drinks were very enjoyable and reasonably priced. We had some fruity martini. The desert is to die for. I had the Banana Nutella crepe which came w ice cream and it was a nice blend. It had right amount of Nutella and made the sweetness just right. The Nutella was not too overwhelming. My friend had the Opera cake which was delightful. It was light with right amount of chocolate and espresso.

So easy! Truly a fine dining establishment. Not the kind that says fine dining and winds up being a glorified cafeteria, but actual fine dining including silverware placement, direction of meat on the plate, clearing the table in unison, etc. The service is, dare I say it, the best in Wichita. Literally every single person would be employee of the month if they worked somewhere else. Ambiance is excellent. This restaurant made me want to head back to Paris. Pristine in every way. Waiting on our food I noticed a server spending time polishing folks and glasses and holding them up to the light. I can't tell you the amount of times I have sent a cup, bowl, spoon back to a kitchen due to hardened bits of food still on it. Or a nice shade of Sephora around the rim of the glass. Definitely not the case here. There was a slew of items ordered at our table including charcuterie, escargot, brie, and poutine. I had the ribeye with potatoes and Brussels hash. DIVINE! You must eat here and try something that scares you (escargot) lol you may be pleasantly surprised.

This review is purely based off my experience of the restaurant and not the food as we never got seated or ended up eating here. We made reservations 2 weeks prior for this past Saturday evening at 6pm for a reasonable table of 12. With everyone arriving on time and walking towards the restaurant entrance, it took me a moment to find the front door. At first look once I got inside, the decor and layout was very classy and nice. It kind of reminds you something you might see off the streets of New York. Expect cozy and classy, as in cozy I mean take your personal bubble and suck half the air out as the table next to you might be in arm's reach. Alright back to our reservation, the hostess told us they are waiting for a party of 12 whom arrived at 4pm to wrap up, so it shouldn't be long for us. Note another large party of similar size was being seated as we walked in. So we went to the bar, grabbed drinks and waited. This is where our evening began to take a turn for the worse, 30 minutes in we were still waiting, so the servers brought us a few appetizers courtesy of George. George also came by to reassure us that the wait should not be too much longer. Looking over I noticed that the table of \"Chatty Kathies\" (you will see why I call them this later) still had a cake to cut and hasn't even received their tabs yet. 45 minutes in a few patrons approached us as they are waiting for their tables to see how much longer until we get seated because there wasn't space for them. -look woman we have been waiting for our table and we had reservations!!!-This just made our experience even more discouraging. 1 hour in and a few rounds of drinks later we're done! As in done waiting and taking our birthday celebration elsewhere. We all tabbed out and began our departure. George stops us and tell us the table is wrapping up so to please stay and he will take care of us asap. Too late George, as we walk out one of the Chatty Kathies approaches my friend and says \"we are leaving now you can have our table\".Not only was the reservation experince terrible but patrons were also terrible! Shame on you Wichita folks, I am from this city and expect better. George you should have set up a new table if you had known the table of Chatty Kathies were still eating and nowhere near finish!!Ok rant completed.UPDATE:George reached out to one of the members of my party extremely apologetic and felt terrible for our experience or lack of. He offered her to invite the 12 of us back out for a dinner ON the house. I was not able to make it back in town for dinner but the ladies did and their dining experience resulted in rave reviews. George and his wife greeted the party upon arrival, ladies were seated on time and drinks, appetizers, meals and service were top notch. A few of their favorites were the Peartinis, calamari, oysters, rib eye, scallops and EVERY SINGLE DESSERT. The girls were grateful for the do-over experience and left a generous tip for the spectacular service. It's unfortunate that our initial experience didn't go so well, but I'm excited to give George's another chance myself. Thank you George for making this up to the girls and being so generous."}, {"review_id": "dnVXvRRiIz_NzRabo_qt6w", "user_id": "JgznXZL1h4uKGPF6i_xwAQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Amazing atmosphere and everything on the menu is top notch.

His impression was enough to sway a visit from me, although I'm not particular to French cuisine. I was thoroughly impressed with Georges. From the food to the company, this is a must try. Anywhere.First, the food. I ordered the escargot appetizer and a beet salad. Both were fantastic, but the escargot was some of the best I've had. Granted, I've never eaten it outside of the USA. However, in that light, I imagine it would be just as good anywhere.I met George, owner and executive chef, who was warm and passionate. The bartender, who's name escapes me, was brilliant; so friendly and upbeat.Lastly, there were two really cool people dining with me, met them here, and one was aspiring to be a chef at this particular spot. You can always tell the vibe of a place by the people you meet there and how you interact with them. I'll probably never be back to Wichita, no offense. However, I might make the special trip for Georges if they're still here.
