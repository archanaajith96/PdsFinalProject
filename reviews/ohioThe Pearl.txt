Did I mention oysters?I agree with other Yelpers who said everything on the menu is good, but your experience here NEEEEDS to start with oysters.  We had the New Orleans style baked oysters and they were excellent. Very very flavorful.  The best part was sopping up the sauce with the French bread until I had a dazed, carb-induced smile on my face :)We also got the braised short rib, which was seriously the most tender cut of meat I've ever had and superbly marinated. I wasn't a huge fan of the sides though (mashed potatoes and glazed root crop - pretty bland).  My friend got the chicken wing confit which was the best plate of chicken wings ever.  If you can imagine a bougie chicken wing plate, this is it, and well worth it.The atmosphere was casual but tasteful.  We sat at the oyster bar (45 min wait for a table!) and struck up a conversation with a couple of local guys who explained how the downtown Columbus food scene was coming up - I have to agree.  I'd say the Pearl is definitely one of the contributing factors to downtown Columbus being as fun as it was."}, {"review_id": "5Ye5XsTAWzMgbYQw_MPK5A", "user_id": "Emn-3MS2rfRJc7MmT4AAcw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Yelp 100 Challenge 2018: 72/100Walking down High Street, this is one of the most popular restaurants. There are plenty of people hovering around the bar area at 7pm after Happy Hour, and more people constantly being lured in by their inviting signs out by the front entrance of the restaurant. I came in by myself and was told that the bar and the oyster bar are both self seating. I sat down by the oyster bar where I found an open spot and was quickly attended to. Don't be mistaken, the oyster bar doesn't mean there's a bartender or a oyster bar guy serving you. You're still served by a regular waiter/waitress. I ordered the tater tots as recommended by the other Yelp reviews, and the parmesan garlic clams. In my opinion, the clams were on the more expensive side but I was willing to give it a try based on how good the reviews were. The tater tots were amazing! They were bigger than bite size, but perfectly seasoned and fried. I liked that its more mushy on the inside than the other ones you have at other restaurants. However, I was a bit disappointed by the clams. They were overseasoned, making it hard to get the taste of the clams. The parmesan made it wayyyy too salty! Other than the clams, I really enjoyed my meal here! I was constantly checked up on and the ambiance was amazing! There are plenty of business meetings going on as well as dates so it's a good place to go for any occassions. The decor in the back of the restaurant was super cute too!I'd be down to give this restaurant another try, probably during Thursdays when they have $2 all oysters!"}, {"review_id": "ptVsXkOlYUpA4vMSV0O23g", "user_id": "11KzEQy1MPaD8iS4yV_Axw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "The food was really good and the beer selection was fantastic.

They get the freshest oysters and have a big variety of types as well as finishes. In addition, their happy hour is KILLER. Half off apps, half off cocktails, $2 oysters, we made a meal out of that! Their jalapeño corn bread dish is probably my favorite appetizer. The devils on horseback were surprisingly good, too. They're bacon-wrapped dates which just melted in your mouth and went perfectly with the sauce they were served with. The raw oysters were delicious and super fresh; I had never tried oysters from British Columbia, they were awesome! The baked oysters were on another level. They are called n'awlins style and buttery and garlicky and full of crispy parmesan goodness.And I can't forget the drinks. While this is not primarily a cocktail bar, they put a lot of work and attention to detail into their drinks. My favorite is the ramos gin fizz, so light and fluffy and tangy. We also got a bloody Mary which was good, not the best I've ever had though. It was awfully thick, it did have good flavor though. The service here is great, the atmosphere is even better. They have an awesome brunch and great dinner entrées. I think your best option is to go during happy hour and load up on apps and drinks. The price is seriously right. Everything pictured in my photos was under $60 including the tip. I think that's super reasonable for everything we got, especially fresh oysters in the Midwest. Overall, I highly recommend The Pearl.Pro tip: find a cute passage in the book they bring you, write a nice message to impress your company. (They give you your receipt in an old novel with a pen, expecting you to write a little message.

I had never been to The Pearl before, but our experience was incredible. The food was fantastic, and the environment was perfect for our group. We were seated immediately (we had a reservation) in the back corner with several tables pushed together. Even with a large group of 10 or so people, we received prompt service throughout the meal.We started by ordering some appetizers for the table - the Lamb Meatballs and more oysters than I could count. I'm not an expert on oysters, but these were definitely some of the best I've had (albeit fairly expensive). The Lamb Meatballs were a good choice as well.For the main course, I went with the classic Steak, which included a 14oz strip steak, broccoli, and a baked potato. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium-rare, of course), and tasted delicious. I was too full to order dessert, but others in my group ordered various pies and had good things to say about them - I'll have to try one next time I go!"}, {"review_id": "YxWvezpeR_9_QHt5sog2RA", "user_id": "8ye6-7YYMsp0YizCLyrxcA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "I've heard countless positive reviews of The Pearl - it seems that this is one of the most talked about restaurants in the Short North. Needless to say, anticipation was high when I finally came here on a Sunday night for a birthday celebration with my parents.Overall, The Pearl did not disappoint. It was the perfect venue for a special night out with my family. The atmosphere reminded me of my time in Cape Cod last summer - it's nautical, but not in a tacky way. The dim lighting, candles, and wood accents add a warmth that kind of makes you want to stay all evening. I was enticed by the cocktail menu and regret to say that I did not order one of the signature drinks - I stuck with a glass of Pinot Noir, but fully intend to come back soon to try one of the house cocktails. They all sounded amazing!We started our meal with fresh oysters on the half shell. To be honest I haven't had too many oysters in my life and didn't know what to expect, but I could tell these were top notch. Absolutely delicious! For my main dish I ordered the seafood special which was barramundi (an Asian sea bass). Not only was the fish cooked to perfection but it also came with a few of my favorite accompaniments, such as an avocado salad. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.I have to say that for a small restaurant, our waitress was a little sparse with service. There were a couple times that we were left waiting. However, she made up for this by bringing us a free order of the jalapeño corn spoon bread, which was unbelievably amazing. I wouldn't necessarily think to put honey all over my corn bread, but let me tell you - it works. As if all of this wasn't enough, we finished our meal with a slice of The Pearl's famous brown sugar pie. It was so rich and delicious. I can't think of any better way to end a meal!Overall, I can look past slightly slower service for a delicious dinner with incredible atmosphere, and The Pearl provides both. At the end of the day, this is a place where you shouldn't be rushing - you should be enjoying a leisurely dinner with friends, something we don't do all too often in America it seems. If you haven't been here yet and you're a seafood fan, give it a try - it's worth the hype."}, {"review_id": "H5Qdwa-6XQJ8797HlfCZMA", "user_id": "f0yhk6JGL_AGduBdPt1JLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "This place was very popular on a Saturday night- for a reason. Everything about this restaurant is awesome, from the atmosphere, to the drinks, to the food. I had a Moscow Mule which features local Watershed vodka and comes in a cute copper mug bearing the name of the restaurant. You can apparently buy the mug as well. This was a great drink.The two of us shared the old fashioned deviled eggs because we saw them go by when we first sat down, and the display was so unique we just had to order them as well. I had never had deviled eggs before so I was a bit nervous, but these were delicious. It comes with 4 eggs, so I would definitely order something else for an appetizer in addition if you have a party larger than 2-4. For dinner, we had the shrimp and grits, and the fish and chips. Just wow. The grits are made with Gouda cheese and are simply mouth-watering. I had to order the fish and chips for the same reason I ordered the deviled eggs- I saw a plate go by and they looked too good to pass up! The malt vinegar fries were addictive and the fish was light and fresh.I'm definitely glad we had a reservation, because there were a lot of people waiting. The service was great here, and of course the restaurant itself is in a great location in the Short North. I will definitely be coming back!"}, {"review_id": "bxk2ugqyRxSMMLv41f-2Vw", "user_id": "SbdPAMSFczxj9USeV_zYsA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/28/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Wow, it's been 4 years since the last time I've been here and honestly not much has changed for the most part. Starting from the appetizer: The wings and devil eggs are still good. Lamb meatball was good with the tart tomato sauce. The squid on the other hand was a bit salty imo. Entree, we had the hanger steak which wasn't as good as 4 years ago because it was kind of tough to chew. Kimchee fried rice is still spicy. Chicken and biscuit was great, I especially liked the cinnamon bun. The cod was so-so for me.

Seriously. They carry two of my favorite items. Deviled Eggs and Seafood. I never make reservations and almost always sit at the Raw Bar (towards the kitchen), high-top seating near the windows or main bar (seats 7, if that). They have the most \"out there\" plating for the Deviled Eggs. They come 4 to an order. One placed on the tail feathers of a chicken, while the other 3 sit along a wooden board that holds a white metal chicken on the back of it. There's no skimping on filling either. They fill those suckers good. The atmosphere has a mixture of casual meets class. I know, it doesn't make sense. It's elegant, yet comfortable.

When a date suggested we go there for dinner, I was totally down to give it a try. It was a Sunday evening around seven at night and we were seated right away. We were lucky to score a table in the back corner where we both got a booth seat. No fighting over the booth seat this time around! Our server came over right away and explained the evening's specials and brought over some water. I really liked the dim lighting and the music that was playing. It was slightly romantic but in more of a casual way... but not too casual. I hope that makes sense to my fellow Yelpers. We ordered a bottle of red wine and talked for like an hour. It was perfect. Like our server knew we were on a date, haha. After a while he came back and took our ordered. My date got the special, which was a walleye dish and I ordered the ricotta dumplings. Everything came out super quickly so I really appreciated the wait between the bottle of wine and our food. The ricotta dumplings came with roasted acorn squash, ricotta salata, crispy kale, and toasted walnuts. The dumplings were so moist and absolutely delicious. I also loved the crunch of the walnuts. The crispy kale was hardly there, just a small sprinkling over the top. Overall, I really enjoyed it. I was told the walleye dish was fantastic as well. For dessert we split the house pie, which was a brown sugar pie I believe. We added a scoop of ice cream and oh my goodness, I'm so glad we did! It was amazing but also super rich. We didn't quite finish the entire thing. Cheers to The Pearl for a wonderful evening full of great wine and delicious foods. It was the perfect spot for a date night and I'll definitely be back to try some other things off the menu. And that pie! Can't forget that tasty pie."}, {"review_id": "-A-FnksMzCyvsatahpOwpA", "user_id": "hbispjYDOk4K_7EkgaSDng", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "I live one block from The Pearl and have only been here twice. I went for the first time about three years ago on a summer night. We had an excellent table right by the windows which were wide open so we got to sit there and enjoy the weather and peoplewatch. It was fantastic. Absolute 5/5 for atmosphere. I wasn't crazy about anything on the menu. I asked the server for his opinion and he recommended the Hanger Steak. I honestly didn't really like it (and I love steak and burgers so that's not good). I felt like it was a tad too spicy for my palate which made it unenjoyable (kind of frustrating since I asked the server if it was spicy and he said no.) To top it off, I got sick that night (not related to the food) so after being nauseous and whatnot I was never crazy about going back. But that was over three years ago and it is long overdue to give The Pearl a second chance! I had heard great things about their brunch so my friend and I went there while she was in town from Cali. Again, I absolutely loved the atmosphere. It's sophisticated, elegant  and a touch of hipster. What I loved was that my friend and I were sat in a booth and even though it was super busy and there was music playing, I could have a very simple conversation with her at normal volume. I swear I feel like any time I go to some of the High St restaurants I feel like I'm having to scream across the table because of loud music, clamoring plates, etc. Anyways I once again asked the server for recommendations (risky move given my last experience). He told me that the chicken and waffles were the number one choice by other customers followed by the Short Rib Poutine. I turned to Yelp to review pics and settled on the chicken and waffles although the poutine looked good as well! The chicken and waffles were great!! I know this sounds crazy but I've never actually had chicken & waffles before (hopefully admitting that doesn't get me kicked off of Yelp!). I always thought that the two flavors wouldn't mix well but I was obviously wrong. The chicken here had great flavor and a light coating mixed with various spices. It comes with blueberry syrup but I opted for regular maple syrup which was great. The waffle was light and fluffy; the perfect size as well! I was able to eat everything and feel comfortably full---the perfect amount of food! I would definitely like to go back to try the poutine for brunch and the fish and chips for lunch or dinner sometime. The atmosphere cannot be beat and I'm quickly finding that there are many great entree options to test out. I'll be back soon!"}, {"review_id": "qQM3_jg73aPF7z0EuzMQtw", "user_id": "c0uIYXfInsCHPZEovnSLYw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/15/2017", "text": "Consistently a great experience.I have ragged on this place so much for being an Oyster bar - in the middle of the MidWest.

She also made sure to let us know that most dishes are cooked to order so we could make modifications. They have a great selection of traditional pub food that is more high end (it *is* Cameron Mitchell). They do specialize in seafood, but my family isn't too keen on that (growing up in the Midwest). My brother really enjoys their clam chowder, though! I had the ricotta dumplings. It as a light, vegetarian dish that was unique, delicious, and filling. I would order it again. I also tried the pot-o-pickles. The batter used is unique in that it's similar to what is used on the fried fish in fish and chips. A lot more heavy than what I'm used to with the cornmeal breeding but still delicious. The atmosphere is also excellent. It's equal parts traditional pub and trendy, gilded decor.
