I ordered the T-Rose Biscuit which consisted of a portabella mushroom, egg, asparagus, swiss, mushroom gravy, green onion garnish, along with a side of Red Quinoa Potato Hash Browns. For vegetarians, this dish is my top pick! As a person who regularly bakes homemade buttermilk biscuits (the way my grandma taught me), I can truly appreciate what they do in the kitchen. I also believe in making gravy from scratch and they totally nailed it!

I went through a very serious biscuit phase in college, where I was baking them with alarming frequency. Every concoction I could think of, from standard biscuits and gravy to sandwich biscuits, and everything in between. Then a trip to the PNW a few years ago landed me at a biscuit dinner and my love was renewed.A fact you should also know about me: limes are my life. I love them. I put lime on everything. Have you ever had lime on watermelon? It's other-worldly. Squeeze some on fruit salad, on tacos (duh), on raspberry ice cream... there's nothing that lime can't improve. Have you ever had those lil' finger limes? They're like little individual lime pods inside of a finger shaped mini lime skin. Every time I think about them I get immensely happy. I can't seem to find them anywhere, but I'm not giving up hope just yet.Anyways, when these two things got married--biscuits and limes--I knew I was in for a treat. On a cold spring morning I bopped in on the tail end of brunch and sat down for a try.I made the safe order--the expected one. A raspberry limeade and The Hoss. Yes, there are many more things on the menu, but when you walk into daddy biscuit's house, you do as daddy biscuit says: you get the things they're known for. Actually, I think a mint limeade is the more mainstream beverage, but I got to try a little and as much as I loved it, I think it's edge out by the tart and fruity additions made by raspberries.The Hoss is a dream on a biscuit. Fried chicken, bacon, fried egg, gravy, cheesy goo; all stuffed between a biscuit. And let's not forget that the biscuits are the stars here, with their flaky but still so moist texture.I only waited a few minutes to be seated and the food came out wicked fast, so they're definitely turning tables quick. However, I've heard the wait can be a little daunting. I wish more restaurants would use Yelp's NoWait feature (sorry for the shameless plug) but really it's a dream and makes sense for popular spots like this.I'm a total fan of weekend brunch spots. Whether it's pancakes in a mountain diner, or biscuits in the city, we should be trying one every single weekend, exploring, and living our best life. I'd be back here a lot for those biscuits."}, {"review_id": "LlMPzIJoIjoTkHvg4wLMKw", "user_id": "Izigq3SiKVrU3p6bG7xgPg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Holy. Cow. I was not expecting to love this place as much as I did. It's a very small venue with minimal parking off a busy street in Salt Lake. We walked in and the host situation is a bit awkward, but we made it to our table. My boyfriend got sad when he found out there was no soda, but he's kind of a baby because this place serves the most delicious lemonade and limeades and they're all fresh!!!! I got the ginger lemonade, he got the raspberry, and my friend got the mint. I ended up switching my boyfriend because his had lots of texture and he hates pulp/texture/seeds in his drinks, but I'm cool with it. We both ordered lunch biscuit sandwiches. The biscuits were perfection and the fried chicken was also cooked so perfectly. I was shocked. I got the hashbrown and omg they were amazing. No need to salt or pepper them because the flavor was there. I paired it with the house made hot sauce and my tastebuds were doing some happy dancing. My boyfriend got the chips with the house made nontraditional salsa and it was super good too!To top it all off, I got a cookie for checking in. Yay for this place! It's my new Salt Lake fave."}, {"review_id": "6gW7a07FG1voQvPrXq_TLA", "user_id": "6AkJNVcCoA19wQNKoTQZnw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "They do not joke around regarding portion size here.

In other reviews I read the cane sugar is still grainy and that is true - there was a fair amount in the bottom. Salted caramel banana cookie was delish. Tasted like banana bread with caramel buttercream icing. Icing was a little grainy too, but not a real big issue.

The fried chicken was so juicy and tender with a fantastic crisp. My only complaint if that the gravy had so many onions that it was overwhelming. It is basically a creamy onion gravy. We also got the blueberry bread pudding. Yummo!The true winner though, the orange raspberry limeade. So good and refreshing, and pretty to boot!  The cucumber honeydew limeade was also quite good.

Cooked well, but i didn't taste any seasoning on the chicken, or the crust. Very bland.The lime-aids are pretty spectacular. The only weird thing is the sugar doesn't dissolve that well. All the drinks were tart for the first half, and then we saw all the sugar that settled to the bottom. The customer service was great. Our waitress was awesome by giving us recommends, checking in frequently, and telling us that yelp check-ins recieve a free caramel frosted, banana cookie.

The chickens was prepared well and the egg over cooked by seconds (what can you do)I got the potatoes as well. They were better than most hash browns but I wasn't over the moon about them. I would like to give a special shout out to the homemade hot sauce. It's a simple but noticeable touch that makes a big difference and shows that they care about the product.

I don't have problem writing a 5-Star Review for a place like Sweet Lake Biscuit & Limeade.  Our overall experience was a good as it gets. The restaurant small and very busy.  Expect a wait if you plan on dining here on a weekend morning.  We were lucky and didn't have to wait.  But within 5 minutes of being seated, the line started.  Service was excellent from start to finish.  Every server was personable and checked on us a handful of times.  Our drinks and my coffee were always kept full.  I dined here with Terri R.  She got the Hoss, which they're known for.  This dish is created with one of their famous biscuits, a fried chicken breast, a fried egg, bacon, cheddar, and a ton of sausage gravy.  If this is your first time, then get this dish.  The flaky biscuit & fried chicken mixed with some bacon, an egg, and gravy is too legit to quit. I got the Conspiracy Cakes, which is their whole wheat pancakes with bacon & eggs.  I also added a fried chicken breast just because I can.  My dish came with 3 plate-sized pancakes. The pancakes were so fluffy and good that butter & syrup isn't needed.  To be honest, I wanted a dish with one of their famous biscuits in it.  But I knew that Terri R. wouldn't finish her meal.  Being the good guy that I am, I helped her clean her plate.

As a pastry chef, I like to think I've eaten some great food...but that Eggs Benedict topped them all. And don't even get me started on the lemonade!

I walked into Sweet Lake Biscuits and Limeade thinking I'd walk out with a 5-Star review. I really wish I was giving it a 5-star review because it was a cute little location and the food was great! (Scroll to the bottom if you want to read only about the food)However (for starters) the parking situation was a little hard. We had to park down the street which wasn't a big problem but, with a baby in tow, it would have been nice to find a closer spot (maybe it's just that we weren't lucky today). We walked in and were seated. My first impression of our server was, \"he's really nice!\" He got us drinks and we told him we had checked in and wanted to claim our offer that we found in Yelp. He said he'd be right back with our cookies. He didn't come back until the end of the meal and we had to remind him. My initial impression of the server was quickly changed when he didn't check in on us -- not once. I didn't get a refill on my drink the whole meal and when we had to ask them to bring out the chips and salsa that came with our meal, we had to ask a different server. A little confusing, especially since it wasn't super busy. Which leads me to my next let-down. The sandwiches that my brother and I ordered both came with chips and salsa. Usually, chips and salsa came out before the meal or at least WITH the meal. However, they did not and we had to flag down another server and ask for them to bring our our chips after we were about half way through our sandwiches. What's up with that?The other servers and attendants were not overly friendly, kind or helpful and honestly this makes a huge difference when you're trying a new place.The food however was really unique and very delicious. I ordered The Cubano and my brother ordered The Pokey Joe. For a joint that could put off strong vegan-vibes, they did not skimp on the meat! A huge bonus. The bread on my Cubano was fantastic and the meat and sauce was flavorful. My brothers Pokey Joe was bomb. The slaw was a hit and the biscuit the sandwich came on was a unique twist on the traditional pulled-pork sandwich. It was a casual lunch experience and I was impressed with the food but because of the service, I will not be going here again.ALSO, the cookie our server finally brought us, was unwrapped when we received it.
