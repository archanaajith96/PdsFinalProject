Sorry about my language, but if you love seafood like I do you will love this place it will be your number one. I forgot about red lobster and crabs shack house. Go here instead. I always have the lobster roll. It is so good like mouth watering good. You'll probably end up buying another. As my meal I always have the crab lags or snow crabs the big ones. With garlic sauce. Words cannot describe how good it is once you take out the meat and you put it your mouth. It's great! They also have other sauce like old bay! Which my boyfriend prefers. He loves it. He usually crawfish or crab legs or shrimp. I also get sweet potato fries with their yummy garlic aioli dip. This place is a ten for me. I'm a regular."}, {"review_id": "HpqLxh1L42QekpwR8NbY9A", "user_id": "xVLnwFIi3tcCbsisCCXVog", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Raw oysters were deliciousHostess and waitress were snippy.

A 5 minute walk from the Grove St path station.A BYOB place that keeps prices reasonable. If you like seafood and casual dining, this is a very good place to start. For starters we ordered the JB fries. Served up with a lemon Aioli & a good amount of crabmeat.Entrees that were shared, the Mrs had a lb. of mussels in a garlic butter sauce. Also, shrimp with the BeClaws sauce. Didn't think that it was going to be enough but the shrimp & mussels were huge in size. A pro tip if you order the shrimp, peel back the bag and dip them in. So very tasty that way.Save room for dessert. We split a cup of the banana pudding with vanilla wafers. While trying Vietnamese coffee for the first time, sweetened with condensed milk. As always enjoy."}, {"review_id": "sm4OEQNtHDNxSskE9bI4HQ", "user_id": "4gZblRcX9AabwHQigTm9Aw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "10/10. No complaints whatsoever.I do, however, want to preface this by saying I have only had takeout from here, as I don't want to deal with the long wait.I will usually order a pound of shrimp and a pound of snow crab legs, both in the signature sauce. It's PLENTY for two people. The pricing is really fair and I don't know where I could find a better recipe for that sauce.~Pro tip~ Make this your last stop of the night!!! You will come out of this meal smelling like a giant piece of garlic if you order any of the sauces with garlic!! It's so worth it though.I could eat food from here everyday....and I'd die happy.Again, 10/10!!"}, {"review_id": "LzrlW-Uo0BwKJ-VVEL4N9w", "user_id": "B2ab_Xh8uP9wRsHLXBJQhQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Just went to this restaurant on Saturday!

Visited from Oakland, CA and stayed in Jersey. This place isn't far from where we stayed - Dharma Home Suites. We ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of crab - both with \"Just BeClaws Sauce.\" Amazing! Super flavorful and came out hot. If you don't want to bother with peeling your shrimp, they offer to peel it for you for $5 extra. Reasonable.  We also ordered the crab fries. The best crab fries I've ever had - you MUST order these when you come here. They weren't too crabby, too fishy, or too soggy. Perfect texture. The portion sufficed for 2 as an appetizer. I enjoyed having eaten here. They play good music, too. I was swaying in my seat while I was eating. Blasphemous, but totally worth it."}, {"review_id": "B777mRlBuqlwADDUeqamPA", "user_id": "uks3OtzYYgo7uaGyzX29EA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "There is absolutely nothing I can possibly say about Just BeClaws that will make it anything less than 5 stars. Walked right in an hour after the doors opened on a Sunday afternoon and there was no wait. BYOB is a major plus & there is no additional fee for bringing your own bottles. For apps we ordered the JB Fries (basically crab meat loaded fries.. DELICIOUS) & the fried oysters. For the entrees we ordered a lb of clams, shrimp and mussels with the Just BeClaws sauce (medium heat) which were seriously finger licking good!

But I waited!The place was super clean and the service was awesome. I think it's BYOB which is even better. I tried the infamous crab fries and they were awesome.

The place was fairly empty. They serve all drinks, even water, in fountain cups, which is a bit weird and environmentally unfriendly. It kind of have the take-out vibe, which is strange for what they serve. I have been to similar places in the city such as the Boiled and Clawdaddy. We got the justBeClaw sauce for our shellfish. Wings with garlic parmesan: this was quite bad. The sauce was just weird. The wings themselves were ok, but too much breading.JustBeclaw sauce with egg noodles: best food of the night. The noodle just grab the sauce, which was deliciousShrimp: they weren't fresh. They felt frozen or has been sitting around dead for a while. The shrimps weren't crisp, they have lost flavor as wellSnow crab: weren't fresh. The meat just breaks apart when you peel them. Tl;Dr I won't come again. The sauce was good, but the stars of the restaurant, which are seafood, were disappointing. They just weren't fresh."}, {"review_id": "1U7w896x-LA1k6m_RHoJyA", "user_id": "-tFOFnCUW84XOoCsD_ct6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "Great cajun seafood place with good selection of appetizers.

Great atmosphere, friendly staff. The fact it's BYOB is great. The prices are fair, but considering how much you save on drinks because you can bring your own makes up for it a lot.            I've been there twice and both times were great. I've tried the shrimp, king crab, calamari, lobster roll, crab fries, and wings. The wings weren't anything out of this world but they were good. I had high hopes for the lobster roll but It didn't meet my expectations. It kind of tasted like they had prepackaged lobster meet and stuffed a roll and drizzled a little bitter on it. It wasn't my favorite. Everything else was amazing though. The crab fries were delicious. The shrimp and crab come in bags. I ordered both with their \"Just BeClaws\" sauce and it was great. They also have an option to toss a side in the bag. I recommend the noodles.      Definitely going back"}, {"review_id": "owY68WTnuLqAdvura4bWzg", "user_id": "FbUmbyI6ISLyoM18C4ES7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/4/2017", "text": "Went here for my mom's birthday with my parents/boyfriend and we LOVED it. My parents are big on seafood and ordered the lobster, king crab, snow crabs, and shrimp (a pound each) and were so full by the end of the meal. We probably could have chosen 2 or 3 instead of 4 different things. If you're itching for an app, get the JB cheese fries. It's literally crab meat and cheese on fries and that in itself can be filling. We also ordered the crab cakes, and no surprise - they were great.This is the type of place where you can't be afraid to get dirty and peel/crack your seafood. They give you gloves and utensils to make your life easier but the sauce in the bags can get everywhere. It's all worth it though, promise!"}, {"review_id": "eOTY4u0V9YpvGSp3zVNYLQ", "user_id": "kOhbOmZo9Q_BmLOFBXpY0w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "So I loveeeeee my seafood !

So good!The fries alone are worth the trip into jersey city. It's a very relaxed atmosphere, there's usually a wait later on in the day but it's jersey city, just grab a drink at a nearby bar.

They are never shellfish with their serving sizes, even the crab fries are fit for a King! Maybe you tend to wine about beer selection... be delighted to find them BYOB!  In a pinch there even is a liquor store around the corner on Coles Street!  Occasionally a table on a weekend evening is like waiting for the tides to come in...if that is the case; get a buzzer and sidestep over to The Pet Shop(bar) around the corner.  The notifications are shore to reach you sitting in the front!  Even with how busy they are, I have never met a salty member of their waitstaff.  With these prices, even the Po'Boy's can afford a seat at the table!So if you are looking for a crabsolutely bubbly evening...

I came here on a weekday so there was no wait. My bf and I ordered the crab fries, garlic parm chicken wings and a lb of shrimp w/ the Just Beclaws sauce. The crab fries were alright.. I didn't think the crab was super fresh but it was still a good appetizer to share. The garlic parm wings had a REALLY strong rosemary aftertaste that I was not a fan of. I only ate one and was pretty turned off by the taste and didn't bother to eat anymore.The most disappointing part of the meal was the shrimp. While the Just Beclaws sauce was good, the shrimp did not taste fresh AT ALL. I'm not sure if it was just a bad batch.. but the shrimp was definitely not on par with the shrimp from The Boiling Crab or The Boil.Server was friendly though!

Sometimes a long wait! You might want to consider coming when they first open to avoid long wait times. Honestly, I think it's worth the wait. I may be biased because I love seafood, but this place is the best. The food is delicious and fresh. They serve food in bags and buckets. Expect to get a little dirty, but don't fret they supply gloves and bibs. Sometimes I freestyle and don't use the gloves, only to suffer later from stinky crab fingers. Again, it is worth it! I have tried the king crab, Alaskan crab, lobster, and shrimp. Every bite just as sweet as the next and perfectly cooked to perfection. They have items like French fries, but why waste time on that? If that's what your into then go for it. I have always had exceptional servers with great personalities, one time he forgot my gloves but now I just finding excuses. Conveniently located in downtown JC, if your local I would make a point to check this place out."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/just-beclaws-jersey-city?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
