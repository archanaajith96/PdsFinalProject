You the best!We ordered basically the entire menu and were over the moon and not disappointed with ANYTHING we ate. I even had the cinnamon roll 2 days later and it was sooooo good!My favorite thing about this place was the quality for the price and the portion size. All fantastic and I will now dream of their chunky thick bacon until I am able to be reunited with that heavenly cut of meat."}, {"review_id": "HxTOeEBhpdvRMv7JIWv4RA", "user_id": "Gxoiwa0VBcjHua8djLaDSA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "So far BEST place off the strip for breakfast-very good food-outstanding service-delicious coffee!!!Can't put into words the level of courteously and attention you get here from the staff from start to the finish!!

But Mr Mamas delivers again . Upon first walking in you will notice a friendly atmosphere that is very diner like and you will be greeted by extremely nice employees, they even open the door for you. This place is hopping all the time so be prepared for a little wait but the food is well worth itSo I ordered the chicken fried steak with hash browns, eggs, and a biscuit and it was the only meal I ate today lol. It was truly enough food for 2 people and it only cost $13 which was well worth it. The chicken fried steak come with a homemade gravy that has sausage and bacon in it and let me tell you it's amazing, the texture and taste are spot on. So after ordering we received our food within like 5 minutes which was insane and almost made me wonder if it was fresh but after tasting I knew it was just made so kudos to the kitchen for the prompt service . This place checks all categories for a breakfast joint- fantastic food, huge portions, great value, fast service, lots of options , and it's clean with a friendly staff.I must say the only thing I would change is that I can tell they are trying to turn customers so after we ate we were kinda rushed along in a nice way so they can get the next person in. I completely understand where they are coming from , however , sometimes after I channel my inner fat boy I like to sit for a few minutes until after my I-'tis manifests lol"}, {"review_id": "Oamq11V_CAAZgC_gSrUEww", "user_id": "NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "WOW.Post workout vibes with all the carbs. Rolled in and didn't have to wait long on a Saturday morning around 8:15am. The restaurant was packed but we were the first on the waitlist and the hostess was so kind. We initially were a party of four but a friend decided to join last minute and although we added a bit more time to our wait, we were assured that it wouldn't be an issue and we were sat in about fifteen minutes.The menu has a little bit of everything. I was pulled towards the burrito but the corned beef hash is what won me over. It's not shredded corned beef, which is my favorite, but the hash was crumbled and packed with salty and rich flavor. The hashbrowns were wildly crispy and my over medium eggs were yolky and divine. I opted for their swirled rye and made perfect bites on the buttery toast. My table shared two of their cinnamon rolls and OH. MY. GOD. They were gooey and rich, covered in frosting with every bite. There was a gentleman walking around and he offered to take a photo of our group saying, \"You need a family photo.\" He stood up on a chair in a busy restaurant to take several photos of us on my phone. He worked there and was just doing a nice thing. It caught me by surprise and was definitely appreciated. Oh, and the coffee was good. A lot of breakfast spots overlook their roasted bean treat but Mr Mamas did it right. Really looking forward to going back again."}, {"review_id": "DAXITugSZW5LSpFxJ6BjCg", "user_id": "kTMGDx-6K-F5PEPnKbekRg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Make sure you get here early to avoid the wait! (Though it's worth the wait)I've been here twice with my girlfriend, this place has not come close to disappointing us.  Both times we were greeted and served by very helpful people at the restaurant.  There's even a nice gentleman who walks around and asks if you'd like him to take a photo for you (with your own cell phone).  The second time we went here we got seated in a corner behind the cash register.. and even then we still got excellent service!Now to the food.. the home fries are delicious!  If your food comes with an option of hash browns or home fries, get the home fries!  They are so good.. lightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with some sort of seasoning that makes it taste delicious.  I ordered my usual steak and eggs and my girlfriend ordered her eggs benedict.  Everything was on point.  My steak had so much flavor from the outer edges all the way to the center.  My girlfriend's eggs benedict was savory in every bite.  I'm only disappointed that we couldn't bring any leftovers home.. because we ate it all!We'll be back again!"}, {"review_id": "1nG66W28-N_KZaOBYADNBw", "user_id": "sDmLuolKwjDGK6AJxoJ89w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Simple well executed breakfast food with extraordinarily high attention to detail.

The sign has two burly guys dresses cooks but do not be frightened! They can cook! I went with the strawberry pancakes-strawberries inside and on top. Husband got the strawberry French toast. We shared hash browns with onions and peppers. As if this meal couldn't get any better, they offered flavored creamer for their delicious coffee. The bacon was crisp and not fatty. He got his eggs the way he liked them, soft scrambled, which doesn't happen often. There was no reason not to wait! You will not be disappointed. Service was fast and the food was hot.

It is crowded pretty much anytime it is open. However, the food is well worth the wait. It is made fresh to order and takes so little time to come out fresh that I couldn't believe it. We had our food maybe 5 minutes after we ordered it, and it was perfectly prepared. Everything was fantastic. We all ordered the pancakes and others got the hash or eggs and everything was delicious. Prices are very reasonable for brunch or breakfast. As someone who is a Waffle House fanatic, this could replace it in my breakfast favorites category.

The service was amazing.  It was so refreshing to have a place with great tasting food and great service.  The breakfast comes in large portions for a great price as well.  My son ordered the mama short stack and couldn't finish it.  The pancakes are the size of the whole plate.  I got the Mamas French toast with strawberries and whip cream and it was so filling.  Overall i would recommend this to anyone.  Thank you Jose for the great service as well!!"}, {"review_id": "_SfohTKagoelB3iIm1LtNg", "user_id": "157f7Zlzx9GPbd7z0bg6tg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Loved this place!

The hash brown came out nice and crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. To top it off, it was perfectly seasoned. Service - the staff is very accommodating and polite.

The food was AMAZING, but I definitely was not a fan of the customer service. I would suggest getting there early because you will have to wait. The line was out the door and everyone was just hanging out up front waiting to be called in. The wait for the food is definitely worth it. The place itself is nothing fancy. Super casual feel, definitely do not need to dress up. If anything wear comfy clothes because the portions are really big. I ordered the Mama's Breakfast burrito and It is to die for. I pushed myself to eat both half because it was THAT good. The only reason I am not giving Mr. Mama's a 5 (which they deserve for their food) is because of their customer service. I would give them a 2.5/3. I understand that they are busy and they need to make sure people are going in and out efficiently, but I saw multiple instances where they did not treat customers very well. Personally, after being served our burrito our waited came back in about 5 mins to ask how the food was (which was nice), but it wasn't even another 10 mins before they brought the check. I was not even done with the first half of my burrito. They did say that their was no rush, but it felt like they were telling us that we needed to hurry and leave so they could serve other people. Again, the food is AMAZING and I will definitely be going back. But their customer service is lacking."}, {"review_id": "56duWsqTazBBeuQhyvo8_g", "user_id": "2YiBYO8n32upYTJnpWgqLg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "Been half dozen times, to me 4-4.5 star. I think it is over hyped but I like this place a lot so rating little high myself. I'm pretty sure I can update this review to 5 stars later because the managers care, read the reviews, respond, and hopefully will try to improve. The service is great, 5 stars! You're quickly seated and brought drinks. Take orders real fast and come back around to check in and offer ice tea refills often. The owner/s seem like great people from the little we've spoke. They're always working, when owners are there often and care the business does good! The owners opened the door for me with smiles and hand shakes today. The server came around often, tended to few special requests, nice and interactive, and been their years. Even the cashier lady asked how I was mid meal 2 of the visits at least. It's very great to see they train all employees to work together. Overall the food is pretty good but left much to be desired sadly to say. After reading the reviews you just expect more of a wow factor.They're good about cooking eggs just how you ask and special requests are nicely addressed. Food has good presentation and just right portions so you do not need to get to go containers often, nothing real huge and wasteful which I like. Ice tea is perfect. 5 starBiggest problem is the soup, never changes and is so boring and confusing. Chicken noodle is just okay, could be way better. The other soup is just a broth, no tiny chunks even! It's tasty and could be good if they added stuff to chew on, changed them daily, made fresh with lots of care. This would be an easy important fix. 2 starI think most of the menu is overall bland and could be improved. I hope they will take these criticism and actually do that maybe so I'm being picky in thorough. The menu has only simple offerings with not enough flavor, take more shots and try to truly earn the hype. Potatoes were okay but for the hype you'd expect fresh cut amazing with lots of extra flavor but they charge .50c more to get tiny amount of onions and peppers tossed over the average home fries. I've had so many amazing breakfast taters that I know they could improve this easy and hope they do. 2 starBenedict was cooked good and muffin was soft and easy to cut but could be bit better. Sauce was little odd and came with too much, thankfully they have their own plate so it doesn't get on other things. It was pretty good, cooked well, olives were good, but with little touch up it could be better and earn the hype. 4.2 starBreakfast burrito was small and didn't come with potatoes I believe, maybe they changed it but if not they need to. They give little too much potatoes in other meals but none on the side on the burrito because it has them in the burrito. It's already small, this is not good value and not worth the hype. 2.5 starsSo to recap I'd say service is 5 star, but food is a frustrating 3 at best.Managers willingness to be there to work means they're likely to improve. They'll read and respond to this review which is great to see. Problem is they don't need too improve so worried they won't. I mean they haven't for years, same soup and menu, boring decor. Had the soup been changed today or potatoes I'd of have 5 star but no changes. Please take a shot mamas and truly try to earn the hype and a real 5 star! I'd love to update the review and will be back."}, {"review_id": "Bl2ewqQFmNqmpHK4LLJBzQ", "user_id": "qQOZ-F4XbPAi90SlPdpxqg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We came in again today, they said the  wait was close to 30 we got seated sooner.

Food was standard diner food, good portion sizes to cost, and did I mention so quick! Loved that the side fruit wasn't just melon with pineapple, but all berries.
