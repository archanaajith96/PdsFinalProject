The room was ready on time, the A/V equipment worked without a hitch, and service was efficient with our large group. There was a sampling of appetizers served buffet-style, and everything that I tried was delicious, albeit a bit heavy, but it is pub food after all. The cheese steak \"spring rolls,\" fried chicken sliders, and the sweet potato fries with bourbon sauce were knockouts.A significant complain that needs to be addressed was that there was no air conditioning in this sealed off room on a 90+ degree day. It was absolutely boiling in there. We were so uncomfortable and soaked in sweat that guests kept going into the restrooms or on the porch to cool down."}, {"review_id": "JU2Pvj9CLkngagjSEppiLw", "user_id": "Bk3FIBR8ujP97RNT2E856g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "First time I came here, I wasn't very exited, as when I listened \"brewery\" my thought was more a bar/pub than a restaurant, but that feeling didn't  last long, this is a very descent restaurant, with a huge variety of dishes for almost every wish, the menu manages to have all sort of sandwiches, burgers, sea food, stake cuts, beef, chicken, vegetarian, soups, salads, appetizer and even great desserts...Yeah, I know that when you hear that, the feeling may be too much may not be good, well I tell you...If you are watching calories, try the \"Teriyaki chicken\" that is outstanding taste and very nicely balance food, while If you are starving and looking for fun! You might ask for one of their big burgers or fish tacos deliciously served...I am a personal fan of tuna steak and they Red tuna salad is formidable!Now been all this said, this is a Brewery, on top of all this variety food...your are still able to select from a huge variety of beers, their brewed beer is outstanding and if you don't know what to ask for, as probably all of us when we first visited, ask for a sampler you can taste them all and you can't go wrong (I confess I get 2 samplers always) but my personal favorite is the stout ...Great environment, service is very good, sometimes not consistent, but the food and the environment makes is worth it!Last If the weather is good ask to be seated outside and enjoy the wonderful view of the riverfront which I love ..."}, {"review_id": "B2Gs8Y_BoAoEIvEJiHL8Wg", "user_id": "bZMxUi40CBuXA5gD3_sPgg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "This location is an original location but still has a long way to go in terms of customer service.

The food is always spot on (but not spectacular but very good). The service is normally great. They brew their own beer which is as fun to show off as it is to drink. We've been eating here consistently for 4 years and the menu changes but always delivers. They always feature Kennet mushrooms (I usually fall for this and love it). Our go to menu items are hamburger, fish and chips (!!!!!!!!!), salads, mushroom anything, Brussels, fish specials, shrimp voodoo, and other fried goodness (when they have the goat cheese get it!). But we never come for the pizza however--HOWEVER, we needed pizza and beer recently and it shocked us. So delicious! If you haven't tried the pizza for a while, do it! Plus, Emily the bar tender hooked us up with buffalo sauce (bc I can eat that stuff on everything). Best buff sauce I've ever had. We sat at the bar and had a perfect night. Thanks to Emily who helped us pick beer and pizza."}, {"review_id": "79h3aKZBi3LQ2vQI0XNj9A", "user_id": "XNcXFYK-QEKrKOuf8fQ5ug", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/22/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Stopped in again with the family two weeks ago.

The wait was around 45 minutes so I asked the hostess to text me when my table was ready and we went for a walk by the water as the sun was setting while we waited for our table. Gorgeous views!Our waitress, Kristin, was super friendly! I got the 4 flight of beer to start. She recommended a few beers to me. I loved the Cannibal the most. It was deliiissshhhh! My boyfriend ordered the tomato basil soup as an appetizer and it was pretty darn good! They also bring bread around to each table. I didn't care so much for the bread. I got the BBQ chicken pizza. I asked them to substitute the green peppers for spinach, which they did, and it was sooooo good! You can not go wrong with the pizza here. They have some great menu options.

We had some nice pieces of haddock in our fish and chips. The jagerschnitzel had a nice sauce and I even ate the green beans. Cheesesteak egg rolls were fun and good; and if you like sherry in your lobster bisque, you're gonna love the Iron Hill bisque.The atmosphere is lively and classy.

This chain brewpub has a pretty extensive beer menu with multiple seasonals, and I of course choose the habenero honey pale ale. It has a nice kick not only of spice, but a spicy tang from the honey as well, making a great combination. The best part about this location is the back patio which overlooks the river including a ferry boat dock. It's a cool way to spend part of an afternoon."}, {"review_id": "V8LuhX_nT-_bJzX2b2xuew", "user_id": "0kPfZz9R1_0f7vYSXglF8Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/3/2017", "text": "One of my favorite places for house beer.

However, the service & beer were just okay on our trip here. There's a convenient parking lot out front that gets crowded with Joe's Crab Shack guests, but there's still ample space! When you walk in, you arrive at a host stand where you can reserve a table or get a spot at the upstairs/downstairs bar, but all tables are thru the host stand. We grabbed a pager & meandered upstairs for drinks. Maaaaan was it noisy up there! We stood at the bar & had a beer, but it took 5mins to get a taste of an IPA that was weaker than a pale ale. The other IPAs were all just okay- none too hoppy like you'd expect (esp out of a DIPA). The wings were decent but nothing fabulous, just regular frozen wings. Despite the mediocre beer & service, I did like that there were bathrooms conveniently located upstairs!All in all, Iron Hill is a decent choice for craft beer in the Wilmington Riverfront district. Service could improve but you're paying for location & they definitely deliver on that!"}, {"review_id": "TK2hcr3K1UKu375oh8eo4w", "user_id": "mtj0jBbWx0BVo5sSF3sEMg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "I like this place a lot.

This is perplexing.  Most of the time, the issue is the lack of attentiveness.  When an ordered item is forgotten, the customer should not have to flag down another server to fix the issue.  I can't help but notice the servers going MIA.  While Iron Hill has always had such a great selection of menu items, the quality doesn't seem to be there at this location.  On my last two visits the same pizza tasted totally different each time. Also, the baja fish taco was pretty disappointing. The quality was Long John Silverish, so I barely touched it. $8 for a single taco, that was uneaten, good times.  Two stars go to their delicious nachos.
