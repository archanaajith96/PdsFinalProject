Came after 1 PM on a beautiful Sunday and was greeted at the door. Very spacious and wait staff was very friendly and helpful.I'm a huge eggs benny fan and indulged in the lobster crab cake benedict. Decided to have grits as my side. Everything was really good, super savory, and tasty! It was a heavy dish so I made sure to take a nap afterwards! Would definitely be back if in the area!"}, {"review_id": "UxhyMQl3AC0LXdm9a872vA", "user_id": "YpbcO5c2DZ8pQqv9wwD-3g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "Nice spot to have a bite on the patio on a pretty day.  My food experiences have been mixed.  Lunch and dinner have been mostly satisfying.  My last experience with breakfast pretty much ended my breakfast visits.  After a rather long wait my eggs finally arrived.  They were ordered over easy and came to the table with the yokes fully cooked.  I indicated that they were not as ordered and asked for them to be returned.  Soon the manager came to the table to find out what was wrong I showed him the over cooked eggs and he informed me that was how over easy were to be cooked and that is how he instructed his chiefs to cook over easy.  I have been eating over easy most of my 50 years and always over easy is fully cooked whites with soft or runny yokes.  Every restaurant in the area cooks them the same except Café 4.I do love the everything muffin.  I think that is the name.  They are cooked in the in house bakery."}, {"review_id": "-I89kJJ44qRiUx4zEeIDSw", "user_id": "bAmK1OzZpDkKeN_az63sMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "You can never go wrong at Cafe 4. A wonderful spot for brunch, lunch, birthday dinners, parties, this place does it all. I've been here countless times and have always left happy with the quality of food, service, and ambiance.

One of those restaurants is Cafe 4 which was nice place for brunch.   Please note,  going here you need to set your expectations to nice, but open restaurant, and good for a family or group of friends.  Its a little loud,  but tolerable, and the food is really very well priced for the quality and taste.  Lets talk food...They have three presentations of Eggs Benedict.   Jax had the Southern style Benedict, which used a white sausage based white gravy instead of hollandaise sauce. It was rockin' awesome. Extremely good southern breakfast overtones, but not too heavy.  The poached eggs were done the perfectly. Jax highly recommends it to anyone with a southern boy hunger.  Dori had the Lobster Crab-cake Benedict, which did have classic Hollandaise on it.    The Lobster Crab Cakes were very meaty an excellent quality.  The eggs were perfect and grits well made to accompany a perfect breakfast meal.  I had the Smoked Salmon Toast,  which was surprise of the morning as I really do not  like cream cheese.  The dill cream cheese was light and very rich with taste.  I highly recommend it.  My sister had the Fish Tocas.   Her response was \"wow\" they popped with taste and was nicely balanced with the other contents of the taco, see the pic of the menu for detail. My Mom got the beef short-rib, grilled cheese sandwich.   This one gets,  George's \"kickass\" meal of the day...even though the sweet potato fries were under cooked and a little bland.   The sandwich was just plain awesome...   if you like grilled cheese sandwiches and short ribs, it's the meal for you.  I could not give the place a 5 star rating,  due to the fact they sat us at table 64,  which was right in front of an exit door,  that had a bad seal.   It was 24 degrees F outside and the minor arctic blast of air coming through the door was too cold to not mention it.   I say go for it,  but make reservations!!"}, {"review_id": "Ph44fHnf-aWVmX8wR-XLNw", "user_id": "xmd0E7DU-8jkebCq92WkQQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "parmesan fries is fantastincbest flat bread ever,poached eggs were delicious and juicy"}, {"review_id": "d2qYkpcVEwXpJ-hrBhweKw", "user_id": "dM99uG1jXy_3XI4ohNbYRw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/8/2017", "text": "This was a great spot in Knoxville.

Most people were here for happy hours and group dinners. Though later in the evening I saw a lot more date crowd. This restaurant doesn't have a cozy feel to it, so I wouldn't come here for a intimate event or first date. Outdoor seating makes this place even better during evenings.Drinks: They don't have happy hour special for drinks, more for food. The bartender recommended me Paloma and Airplane for drinks. Both were great. Paloma was a bit better thanks to the special grapefruit juice they use. Drinks were a bit on the expensive side.Food: We has truffle fries and bruschetta for starters, both were great. For entre, I had linguini vegetable pasta with shrimp. The entre came with FOUR pieces of shrimp (picture attached). I think 4 pieces of shrimp for $6 is a bit steep. This chef needs to go back to school.Service: The bartender was great, but the waitstaff basically doesn't care for their job. The restaurant wasn't busy, but food wise their recommendation \"everything is great\". When I asked about four pieces of shrimp, he had nothing to say. I think they can do better on service."}, {"review_id": "S6ryTGRscqSmZpJlLPlLpQ", "user_id": "TTKMlF_E76ig49PJaiKTpA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Some girlfriends and I stopped in for an early dinner and had a great experience at Cafe 4.  We had the pimento cheese as an appetizer which was SO YUMMY. I think all of us could have kept eating just that. For our mains myself and one friend had the shrimp and grits, and the other had a salmon salad. The shrimp and grits was delicious. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the portion size was just right. The grits had great flavor, and I looooooved the sauce. Everyone at my table really enjoyed their dinner and our server was friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back. When you go, definitely start with the pimento cheese!"}, {"review_id": "dCWTtQfwKrv31bonYPn1gg", "user_id": "eP_a_frXpAZu3ZMVkPgbkQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/17/2017", "text": "Absolutely lovely interior. It's soothing and somewhat romantic (great date night spot), and the dinner and brunch menus are both on point. The ingredients in and execution of the dishes leaves little to be desired, however, the food can be under seasoned. I would like to see better drink specials. If the food absolutely WOWED me, or if Cafe 4 weren't located in such a competitive area, drink prices wouldn't cross my mind. As it stands now though, there's nothing compelling me to choose brunch here over somewhere else. Simple as that. The service is great, but wait time on food could also be improved. My four star choice is mostly based on the overall experience. There's salt and pepper on the table which takes care of the under seasoning. I left happy and content."}, {"review_id": "yHNCusMWFTfJ4k6IzqceHw", "user_id": "Xj1v-i432n_9jgzYUIxf_Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Slow service....   not great food and long wait for a table!!  Bistro by the Bijou is such a Better Brunch and better service!!"}, {"review_id": "i_SIktRX6J_YD4v0xtKeqw", "user_id": "JyCDgmJG4u1LwM-tbPcuCg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "Delicious food..

Back when I was in college, I used to come here all of the time for their truffle fries and possibly jalapeño chicken mac and cheese? I only guess because when I went during lunch, they didn't have the mac and cheese on there. Which was disappointing and their menu got way smaller. I ordered a black bean burger and a side of spring mix. My friend ordered chicken and waffles. Another friend ordered the large truffle fries and a punch bowl of mimosa. The black bean burger was really good and was nicely cooked. It was a little crispy which is what I like. The truffle fries were good but I remembered them being a lot better. I also wasn't able to eat too much of it because the taste just wasn't the same to me. The punch bowl of mimosa, it came in a cool looking bowl and had a giant frozen ice cube that had orange, blackberry, and blueberries in it. It was supposed to melt I believe to infuse the fruit with the mimosa but it never did. And I don't think they give you exactly that much mimosa. I think the bowl tricks you a little bit. And it's def not worth the cost, its $22. Even if it was bottomless mimosa, $22 is a little high. At least where I'm from it is. The chicken and waffles was decent. But again, wasn't anything special. Overall, the experience was okay. It was my go to experience from college days that I think i might need to keep it in the past."}, {"review_id": "42Ls3Tbq8rKqbfumOUrX5A", "user_id": "6nhmEtC5RnyqaWO27PAfPg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/23/2017", "text": "We went here to celebrate my daughter's first week of school and because we heard they had macarons.

My daughter loved her chicken and waffles and said she wants to go back for them again. The prices are a little higher than we normally spend to eat out but we will be saving this as a great place to celebrate special moments.

We got the lobster flatbread for an appetizer and could t get enough of it. Then for a main course I got the maple bacon salmon. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the maple bacon glaze was amazing. The only reason I gave a 4 instead of 5 is because the sides were a little greasy. The crispy Brussel sprouts were a little too greasy for my taste.

I've eaten here several times now with small and large groups, but it's never my idea; because everything I've had here is fine, but nothing to set it apart from other downtown options.  Don't get me wrong, it's better than the Downton Grill & Brewery and less expensive than the Oliver Royale, and it'll suit a variety of tastes with its standard menu and pleasant staff. And that's about it. The hamburger is good. I had the chili dog lunch special recently. Also good. The mac and cheese is fine. The coffee at the counter in the mornings is okay. The pastries are good.So, if you want somewhere downtown and local to take your less adventurous friends or family, this is a good place to eat.
