You are not alone. Yes, the steak is delicious...but this carb queen's main motivation for coming here is the rolls and honey butter. There, I've said it.Second to the rolls, however, is their steak. I ordered an 8 oz sirloin with mashed potatoes and a caesar salad on the side. I ordered my steak medium and that's exactly how it came out - a pretty pink center and perfectly cooked outside. I loved the mashed potatoes and will definitely order these again (like I mentioned earlier, CARBS). The caesar salad was good, but I would probably opt for a mixed greens salad instead next time. Overall, I was stuffed at the end of this meal AND still had a good amount to take home with me for the next day.I really like the atmosphere in here. It's exactly what you would expect that vibe of somewhere called \"Texas Roadhouse\" to be--loud country music, western decor, and just an overall friendly and relaxed vibe. A wonderful dining out experience with good food in an atmosphere that doesn't make you feel ashamed for accidentally putting your elbows on the table or reclining in your booth after stuffing your face with rolls. Service was also friendly and timely (we did come here at like 9:30 at night, so it was probably past their diner rush). Overall, awesome experience! This might become a frequent stop for me...just not too frequent because you know, those rolls."}, {"review_id": "UTQ9ARTug0XpD7uQXJKrOw", "user_id": "Tp8lK4TWERIJA-5dNnardA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/4/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "So, I have gone back to TRH several more times & I have decided that it's finally time to update my review. The food quality has gotten better.  The last few times we have been our order has been:Me: 10oz ribeye steak, baked potato with butter & sour cream, & side salad with blue cheese, extra croutons, & shredded cheese on the side. Hubby: full rack of pork ribs, French fries, & side salad with blue cheese.  I am obsessed with the blue cheese dressing! It's seriously delicious & I find myself craving it.   I have even gone online and looked for a copycat recipe! Lol. The ribeye has been pretty tasty, but it's still uber thin. My husband really loves the ribs and at only $18.99, you can't beat the price.  TRH has now become a regular spot for date night dinners.  The food has been good & consistent and my hubby and I can eat for under $40 pre tip. TRH does get very busy, so I highly recommend using their call ahead seating to avoid a lengthy wait time. The last time we went it was an almost 2 hour wait (but we called agreed)."}, {"review_id": "3zubgHqbRF8T6a0W5-OVcA", "user_id": "MANz899MD-Xcg38GBIeQUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Excellent food at a very reasonable price.

That's the image that comes to me when I hear that name.Although the roadhouse has a small selection of ribs and pulled pork, this is mostly a steakhouse with chicken and even catfish.You'd think the roadhouse might be a buffet restaurant with all the free rolls and buckets of peanuts. Instead, it means they hand out a lot of styrofoam (can't you join the 21st century and offer a more environmentally friendly container? They're out there) to-go shells for people to take leftovers home. I typically choose the ribeye steak: lots of flavor and a little bit of fat on the side. There's three sizes, 10 to 16 ounces. Choose the small after reading the paragraph above about leftovers.Everyone knows that chile with an \"e\" doesn't have stinking beans in in and the roadhouse understands that. Otherwise, it isn't chile. It's one of the better restaurant chiles I've found.

Right off the bat, the value is real good here, but can get a little \"spendy\" for some of the premium options/ alcoholic beverages. I always order the 16OZ USDA Choice Sirloin steak with mashed potatoes and fresh vegetables, and unless I'm REAL hungry, I always bring some of the steak back home for dinner.You come here for the steaks, and the steaks here are real good. I've had some steaks from other \"chain\" restaurants in the area, and I always come back here because these really do taste the best. Seasoned well, no need for any A1 sauce. I'd highly recommend adding mushrooms & Jack Cheese on top of your steak, IMO it's totally worth it. You get unlimited rolls, which are very tasty, and you can always take some home with your leftovers. They always have some sort of IPA beer on deck, which I always order.I've visited this location multiple times, always had great service. I had a real good time last time, Greg was my waiter and I enjoyed him serving us so much that I had to come on here and place a review. If you're lucky enough to get him, you'll have a real good time here. Very attentive and just good & positive vibe from him.If this is your first time here, this is what you order: 16OZ USDA Choice Sirloin (medium well) topped off with Jack Cheese & Mushrooms, mashed potatoes, and fresh vegetables. This is the REAL DEAL, trust me. I included the picture to this review, it was a biblical meal. Order a large beer and just kick back and chill. Lots of TVs, mainly around the bar area, to watch sports.Overall, 5 stars EASY. Great value, great tasting food. If I HAD to mention a negative, I'd just point out that the serving size for the mashed potatoes / vegetables is just a tad undersized. If they had just a little bigger servings for the potatoes & vegetables this place would be unreal. Also, could get a little loud at times, and some tables have minimal lighting, but still a good environment."}, {"review_id": "M3FYcqWQmj1lRqZxE_d_Pw", "user_id": "EfGPXR9zev0DGybF-YJmig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "although this place is a chain and we did have to wait for an hour to be seated, the food cannot be beat! sat at the bar while we waited and got a skinny margarita with the $2 extra shot made by tiffany- one of the best margaritas I have ever had! and it's under 200 calories?! seriously too good.I ordered the smothered chicken with cheese, a sweet potato, and a side salad...you can't beat all that food for $11.99!my husband got the bone in ribeye- wow! and you can pick your own steak if you want to as well- they have a meat display when you walk in. he opted to let them pick it. it was absolutely cooked perfectly and so flavorful. he also got a salad and some loaded mashed potatoes.our server janelle was friendly and prompt- actually, every single employee in there was super friendly and accommodating. you can't beat that!this was a really great meal and we left so full and happy- we will definitely be back! it's worth the wait!"}, {"review_id": "zmGUumPD_YfeUU8lhRtLlA", "user_id": "BFhnCUmSo-Seq4-jnzUfsw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Great meat and potatoes type place.  Everything I have tried has been excellent.  Open late.  Friendly staff."}, {"review_id": "wb5T2oxH79RlnHXPj0fUFw", "user_id": "YEo1VT-xGVnF5A0C6LleOg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "The food is always okay but the service this last visit was just completely unprofessional and horrible.

Also, I dont have much disposable income.* So what am I doing back here again? They don't need my review; they do great business. Saturday dinners are incredibly busy. Unless you like waiting an hour or more, try doing lunch instead.* A sports fan could get comfortable here with all the animal heads, trophies (like knick-knacks, fancy awards), television screens with various team sports going on, buckets of peanuts, neon signs, and alcoholic beverages. None of that is attractive to me; it sometimes creeps me out. * Its all about the food. I used to chow down on a whole rack of pork ribs and steak fries at places like this. If I was 25 years younger I still would. Today I ordered the small prime rib, which turned out to be a full blown meal with two sides and a basket of bread & butter. Melt in my mouth, and no horseradish thank you.* Service was snappy, friendly, and everyone working here seemed happy - even the gal who dropped a butter cup face down onto the carpet.

Call Ahead Seating is a joke.On the positive side, I had the salmon...it was cooked to perfection. My husband had steak and ribs and ended up taking half of the ribs home.  The rolls with the cinnamon butter are to die for...my daughter and I have a gluten intolerance, and we suffer the consequences because we cannot pass up those rolls!  My step dad loves the peanuts...lots and lots of peanuts.  There is something for everyone on the menu.  Our server (couldnt hear her name) was phenomenal.

I don't think I've ever been the Bro-house without ordering the deep fried onion treat. I've even ordered one as dessert after having one as an appetizer. Fresh onions battered and deep fried are as American as heart disease & morbid obesity, and you're goddamn right I'm okay with that. This trip's meal also included a plate of grilled shrimp over a bed of seasoned rice(always great) while my table mate decided to get a half slab of ribs and an order of chicken critters(side note: if I'm spending my good boy points for some chicky tendies, I'm coming for Texas Roadhouse, and quickly) Those critters are scrumptious!
