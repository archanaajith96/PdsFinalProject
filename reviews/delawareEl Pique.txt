Yes it's that good!All of their meats are spiced just right and no two taste the same!"}, {"review_id": "piI7KJjjUJvA0g5z8sQiJg", "user_id": "6xrSdPn4kTpPuq_4cq2q0g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/8/2017", "text": "Whew lord!This place has the best authentic tacos I've ever tasted!

Each time I'm there I'm surrounded by the delicious smell by all the different kinds of meat!!!! If you're there after 11am there's a good chance all tables will be full and I've been there a few times when the line has been out of the door.My favorites remain : Tacos, the Stew (lambless for me) and the made to order churro. Mind blowingly delicious. Ps....the verde sauce is best consumed by chugging!Keep doing your thing El Pique, I will love you f-o-r-e-v-e-r !"}, {"review_id": "dKp88QDwse9bmd1_BL05XA", "user_id": "Kz4-pm0IS_UplI6Ii6PEfg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Excellent service!

I stuck with chicken once again but promised to push myself and try some of the proteins I've never had before such as the beef tongue and tripe. However, I got the salsa verde this time which was amazing and also the Consome.I absolutely love lamb so I anxiously awaited trying this. The broth was flavorful, aromatic and full of big tender hunks of lamb that really gives the Consome it's satisfying depth. My only gripe being that I found it a bit oily. By the time I finished I felt as though my lips had been slathered with Chapstick, a lambby chapstick. This will not deter my from getting it again. I can easily see curling up with this on a cold winters night."}, {"review_id": "HrEUucHnRLcOnhjuPK2OXg", "user_id": "Hg2VCUdBm-R_UVbJOt38DQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "I usually don't like Mexican food, but this place is awesome.

If you're Mexican or a foodie that loves authentic comida mexicana, you have to try El Pique because they never disappoint.

Want legit tacos? This is your spot. It looks crappy from the outside but you'll find every table full once you walk in! It's a tiny place with like 6 tables. My first visit I had 3 of the 4 vegetarian taco options. Queso Blanco, potato, and bean. You pick the \"style\" meaning lettuce, onion, tomato etc on top. They come out quick on Awesome authentic corn tortillas. The queso was my fave of the 3. Bonus-- super cheap. My date also had tacos and also the soup, which, from looking around, I think everyone orders. I had to indulge and try a fresh made churro before leaving. OMFG THIS THING. don't miss out. They are literally fresh made when you order. It was magical.
