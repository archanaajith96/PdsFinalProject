Very pleasant and accommodating people. Good start (and end -- they checked in on us as we were leaving).Our waitress was weird, no nice way to put it. That's unfortunate for her chosen profession, but it was stranger still because she had to read the entire menu to us. More off-putting, it took much longer than it should have for her to come to our table than necessary. We tried to use that time squinting at another chalk menu (the servers carry a chalk menu to each table; why? I don't know... too cheap to print daily menus or stellar environmentalists), but it wouldn't have mattered because the waitress read the whole thing off to us (which was even weirder than it sounds because she was so strange). Anyways, we both chose the Plato Poca Cosa (chef chooses 3 options) and were told we'd get 6 different dishes.It took a while for our food to come out. It seemed especially long since the place was very slow and it was lunch. But, I must say that the dishes were very good. Most of the plate was salad, but the three other main portions were smallish. It was nice to try a range of Mexican dishes. One complaint was that each of our plates came with Masa -- it seemed like a cheap way of giving us 3 options for each place, especially so since we both got it (though there were different sauces on each). The \"vibrant\" salad was basically lettuce with some sliced cucumber (shredded beet on one). I don't know, the combination of the weird server with a pricey ($20 each) lunch with smallish portions overshadowed the very tasty food. I'm not saying I'd never go back, but with so many options in town it would have to be at the insistence of a future companion."}, {"review_id": "_EEAaFDM1u3PAJR_4USUNQ", "user_id": "70lE1kOeVGdWCSfLJOeT1g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Mediocre at best. We sat for about 10 minutes before we received a verbal overview of the chalkboard menu. I prefer to read my own menu and have a minute or two to think through my choices. Feels awkward. I ordered a margarita and although it was tasty, it was served in a small martini glass filled with ice and an orange and lime wedge. After about five sips, it was gone. My husband's dirty martini tasted predominantly of \"watered down olive juice.\"Our meals were $18 each and about three quarters of each plate was filled with salad (dry). There is vinaigrette on the table that you use to dress your salad. That would be ok except the remaining quarter of our plates had stewed beef and tomatoes on it. There's little room to cut up and dress a salad without covering it in beef juice. We were never asked if we liked our meal, if we needed another drink, or if there was anything else we might like before they brought our check. If you've seen Date Night, this place may remind you of The Claw. Had high expectations based on other reviews and was really disappointed in our $70 lunch.Also, they don't accept American Express (just letting you know in case that's the only card you carry), and they won't give separate checks at a table (the table behind us received that news as they were asking for their checks)."}, {"review_id": "V9SO61ts1QCbQX2GDLVuVA", "user_id": "zWC1npRbmWO2bZRt2fYgfw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/8/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Spendy! I had dinner last night with a group of friends. We were celebrating and treating one of our friends to dinner. So let me start off the review with my portion of the bill was $58!! Whaaat?!?! I wasn't prepared for that! I still haven't recovered. My dinner was a tasty barbacoa($24) but more than half the plate is filled with salad. Be prepared to spend $22 or more for your dinner, as there is nothing less expensive. My friend ordered a pitcher of margaritas (not the house margarita but a step up). I only wish I had known the pitcher would cost $90!!! Holy shizzle!!! $90!!! I didn't think the margarita was anything special... and wish we would've gotten house. Dessert was ordered by a few people and the grand total of the bill was $400+ for 7 people (included gratuity). How could I have possibly guessed that I would owe $58 for my plate and contributing to one person's dinner/dessert. Well... if I had known $90 for the margarita pitcher, I might've guessed. Wink. Service was meh. My water glass was never refilled. So if you're celebrating or just feel like you have too many bills in your wallet, this could be your place! I would definitely put it in the \"treat yourself\" category."}, {"review_id": "V6IC4b-TyS1pXTUM640EEQ", "user_id": "eA8WqJj_15lWURDwE6DsKQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "When we decided to keep the anniversary weekend in Tucson, I immediately reached out to some friends for recommendations. One put Cafe Poca Cosa at the top of his list. Now if you're coming here expecting the typical Sonoran style fare (heavy on cheese, red sauces) - You will be sorely disappointed. Instead, you'll experience Mexican culinary delights from other regions in Mexico. The menu also changes twice a day, which your server will present to you on a chalk board. These guys are known for the Plata Poca Cosa. Essentially a random chef's pick of three of the available entrees. No two Plata Poca Cosas are the same.Incredible Birria, melt in your mouth Pollo in a cocoa rich Mole, and a Tamale Pie. Every table gets rice, beans, corn tortillas and a beautiful salad. And don't miss that En Fuego Margarita. You think you're getting citrus with a hint of spice, but watch out - The fire builds with every sip! This was a culinary experience we won't be forgetting anytime soon. Thanks again, Brad H.!Reservations recommended."}, {"review_id": "MrJomT9tJpL4fPaWF1Qt0g", "user_id": "q2CY_EE8wgqm6WAQoTLp3A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "This experience I had was very interesting. I went with a large group of people, and I feel like I have to base everything off categories here. Based on these categories, I came down to my two star review.Hostesses: first impression of the place, very kind, welcoming, attentive. Had no problems with them, especially when the owner was assisting with seating and organizing guests.The Bar: I wanted to try something different. I thought to myself, what if they used 'pickle' juice instead of 'olive' juice for a martini. My question was, \"would you be able to make a pickle martini?\" The bartender responded in a distasteful tone, \"this isn't that kind of bar.\" I felt very unwelcomed after that. Waiters/ Chefs: Noses so high in the air, you'd think a string was pulling them up. No substitutions, no care for your dietary restrictions, it's basically like going to my nanas house and eating whatever she makes for me without a say except I may choose the type of protein I'm interested in. They explain the menu and you order promptly after that. They brag about their drinks. I'd rather see what other people say than what the business thinks of itself.Bill: It took us almost half an hour to figure out how to split the check. We didn't come to a restaurant to do math homework. Just eat and have a good time. The check split by 11 was a nightmare and the staff were less than willing to offer help. They would come by and ask, \"is it done yet?\"Service: Will never come again for this type of service here. Such mean people, especially when I accidentally walked into the kitchen instead of the bathroom. They acted as if I was causing trouble when I was only misguided. Customer service needs are not valued.Food: like what Isabella said, not similar to Guadalajara grill, El Minuto, or any other Mexican restaurant you may think of around Tucson. Your meat may be hiding under all the fruit and salad that comes with it. It makes every plate look the same. Not impressed by their daily changing menu especially if it's just by removing or adding one or two ingredients. If I were to offer changes, I'd suggest respecting all customers, more unique presentation to each plate, accommodating to requests, and this place doesn't need a deep fryer or guacamole. They need to unwind and relax a bit. They're too serious and complacent and those are not attractive attributes for a place I'm paying to eat."}, {"review_id": "2WviqDco-XqH1rK45Xyzpw", "user_id": "64YW18QJ6R1Dn-Qd9x9ClA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Came for a lunch with a group of people (we had a reservation).

The concept of gourmet Mexican food has not had much traction in the United States due to many factors, but their chef takes many traditional dishes and presents them with a unique upscale flair. The restaurant is located underneath one of the city parking garages in downtown Tucson along Pennington right next to the main staircase and elevators.The interior is very modern, elegant, and very dark. You could really get away with a lot of stuff under the table here, but most diners are too busy above the table with the excellent food. They have the requisite chips and salsa, but they are only average and mainly a distraction. Cafe Poca Cosa has a full and popular bar with many high end margaritas and other cocktails.Unless you have a strong preference, just order the Poca Cosa Platter. This is a chef's choice meal with three options that are done on a whim. The portions are huge and enough to share between two people. My platter included grilled steak, chili relleno with mole, and sweet corn tamale with a cabbage salad and rice and beans. Everything was excellent except for the black beans which seemed a little off.Prices are very reasonable given the quality and presentation. Service is as expected for a high end restaurant. This is a great place to impress your date or even more difficult, a Yelper! Do not expect a taco and enchilada combination plate at Cafe Poca Cosa. Open your mind to the flavors and styles of Mexico and place your night in the hands of the talented chef."}, {"review_id": "dfy8eG3DnDZjsFu4lSJzuQ", "user_id": "xOPe9gI4orkG2d6M-y8eUw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "11/9/2017", "text": "Thought this place was overhyped and overpriced (especially at lunch).

Looks can be deceiving, though. First, the waiter sure took his time to introduce himself and take our drink orders. Then he took forever to get them to us (three beers and two shots). Then (not the waiter's fault) there was no paper menu like you'd find at a fine restaurant, but it was written on a blackboard that the waiter had to bring from table to table. Between getting seated and finally ordering food, I'd say the process took 40-45 minutes.According to their site: \"This fun, spontaneous approach to dining encourages guests to sample old favorites, and to discover new ones.\"Right...waiting for the menu is \"fun\".I realize the menu changes very often, but how hard is it to print out a menu with descriptions and slide it into a holder? On a busy night like we went (in addition to the drinks taking forever), we didn't get to see the menu until 30 minutes after we arrived because there is only one blackboard per waiter. Then once you see it, you feel pressured to make a quick decision since the guy has to bring it to other tables. The menu includes the name of the meal and your waiter will describe what it is to you. If you have a large table, this isn't ideal for anyone. To whoever thought of this blackboard menu idea: it's the worst idea I've ever seen in action at a restaurant. Stop being cheap, you're a fine dining establishment. Print your damn menus. Just when I started feeling bad for our waiter, his attitude turned into what I recognized as an entitled brat. We actually called him out for it and he kept smirking while he apologized. Anyway, now to the food. I guess it's gourmet mexican food? Halfway through the meal, we all realized we would've been much more satisfied if we went to a hole-in-the-wall mexican restaurant instead. The meal was presented in a very aesthetically pleasing way, but its content didn't differ much from your average Mexican restaurant's.Overall, this place relies on its glitzy looks rather than offering a satisfying experience. The bar was nice but the restaurant was a complete disappointment."}, {"review_id": "XDfTV0zgFRRHH4GAC8zy6Q", "user_id": "wGxcpS2-N80Zn3Ns0per1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "A quaint Tucson favorite in downtown with new innovative menus twice daily.  A must try..."}, {"review_id": "3tihCmI6ldIYSl_yFbOgJA", "user_id": "QMMYDp8aR5veQ3GXiXrigA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Used to be my favorite go to place.  Now it is to jam packed and noisy.  Hard to hold a conversation and I feel like I am sharing dinner with the people next to me.  That said, the food is great!"}, {"review_id": "OeqqxZWL6bvFyKn7V0-4MQ", "user_id": "6pmc3Yt8yNCyP1K9K1C0pQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "While traveling through Tucson with my wife, we had lunch here, based on a recommendation from the book \"Road food\".  At first, I was put off by how stylish / fancy the place looked.
