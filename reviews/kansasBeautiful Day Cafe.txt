What a gem.I came here with my mom twice in three days and we seriously consdiered a third :). Their breakfast is nutso-good, my mom is omni and I'm vegan and we both loved it. I had the vegan breakfast bowl and it was just perfect - not too salty, just the right amount. We also had the french toast and my mom couldn't believe it could be so good without dairy! Lunch was fantastic soup - I'm particularly fond of their potato leek soup and curry soup. My mom even got a bowl to go for the next day. They also have really interesting sugar-free homemade iced teas and kombucha on tap. Can't wait to come back here!!"}, {"review_id": "-GUxY9szNdppj0YMf1Ek8A", "user_id": "u2Lza3sTObVUceCZQXqxWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "There's a very real reason that Beautiful Day Cafe is recommended as the Best Breakfast in Wichita right now - they are serving up the best breakfasts in Wichita right now, for real. Disclaimer: I am a breakfast freak. If I can't have Alaskan King Crab dipped in drawn butter, I want breakfast. I can almost never get crab, so I eat a lot of breakfasts. I feel imminently qualified to pass judgement on the people and places that cook (or ruin) my eggs. That said....I love this place. The vibe is super duuuuuper chill and not too bright and not too dark. The rotating art work is reflective of the Pioneer spirit that got it's fingerprints all over Wichita and I'd be lying if I didn't admit to getting a little of that \"I just walked into Grandma's kitchen\" feeling when I stood back and looked at the menu. It's also the only place in town that has ALL the Vegan and Vegetarian options. There's Kambucha (and refillable growlers) and sprouts, locally-sourced dairy, meat, bread, vegetables and whatnot (used in the kitchen AND some available for purchase in the fridge) and about as much tree-hugging, granola love as a girl could ask for in Kansas.Also worth noting: They offer a Senior's Menu. Seriously and for real! I live for this stuff. Thankfully, I'm finally old enough to know that my brain says \"I want a breakfast burrito the size of a skateboard!\" and my stomach knows that I'm really just gonna eat about 20% of that, then tote it around in my purse for 4 hours till it lands a home on the bottom shelf in the Fridge of Abandoned Take Home. My buddy for this food date was a hesitant Vegan who had only tried his own skills at home after becoming a YouTube Scholar and he was blown away by some kinda Tofu egg thang he got and devoured. He confirmed his commitment to the animal-less life by accepting a dish-washing job JUST so he could be in that kitchen and learn how to do this Vegan thing. At the end of the meal: I was full and happy and the people from Santa Fe sitting to our Left were blown away by their meal that they never expected to find in Kansas.Just.sayin.IF you're hungry AND you care about what you put in your body: Go here. Bon Apetit."}, {"review_id": "f4edYMCgeaZUNKu9mOjfAw", "user_id": "IWEt20kVdih7CQBGrxnb7Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/17/2017", "text": "Finding a plant based restaurant is difficult when the world seems to love Applebee's with piles of meat with every meal. Found this place through Yelp, and it was all I hoped for and more. Great variety, delicious, and most important actually healthy and good for you in the process. Love the atmosphere as well, adds to the overall experience. Only downside is the limited seating as the misses is short and her legs dangle with the high bar chairs. But certainly worth the wait if all the four tops are taken.

I had tap mint and strawberry kombucha, sweet potato curry soup, and their take on a turkey Reuben. The sandwich was my least favorite thing, but it was a healthy sandwich, whereas a traditional Reuben would have caused me to skip dinner. LOL The other items, including the simple side salad I had with the Reuben, were all excellent. A few notes... this is a pricey place... my lunch was about $20. If you are a Whole Foods shopper, this won't surprise you... it's the same \"granola\" feel. It's a small place... large families and groups may not be comfortable here. This is a quick serve set-up... there is no full-fledged table service."}, {"review_id": "hSis7uoL9Z8qXZZIfWiP6w", "user_id": "wRvmQa0IVFawvQHcxLkJ-w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/15/2017", "text": "I found this place after scouring yelp for places to eat on a business trip to Wichita - almost got lazy and ordered room service, SO glad I didn't!Great, small granola diner. Open 7:30-2:30 Monday through Thursday. Has a good sized parking lot, which is always appreciated. The first thing I saw when I walked in was their local kombucha on tap - immediately knew I had made the right call. Along with many varieties of kombucha, they also have a variety of teas and coffees as well as juice and smoothies. The menu has so many options spanning gluten free, vegan and good ol fashioned comfort food. It took my almost ten mins to actually decide on what I wanted. I got the sweet potato curry soup, beet salad, jalape√±o quesadillas and two eggs with hash browns and bacon (don't judge, I had a full day of working from the hotel room ahead). They also give you free hummus on Wednesday's - wasn't blown away by it. Everything else was quite good though! Staff is super nice, it looks to be family run which is always."}, {"review_id": "_z45WNfQ8nJaE4KTka5QfA", "user_id": "Ux5g2U155ZNPAufVneLBZA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I wish i could give them a higher rating Unfortunately for the price of these items I do not feel like we're getting our bang for our buck.

The cafe is small, cutely decorated and has a chill vibe. I had the veggie burger and a side of curry soup. Let's just be honest about hand made veggie burgers -- they rarely ever hold the shape of burger and more often than not closely resemble \"sloppy joes.\" So why we call them burgers and serve them on a bun is beyond me. This burger was no exception, sloppy squirting out all over the place when bitten. The flavor wasn't obvious - so overall I'd say try something else. But the soup, TRY the soup!!! It was delicious. My hubs had a quesadilla and said it was well flavored and not greasy. Lots of great options at this cafe!!! If I'm ever back in Wichita I'll give them another try."}, {"review_id": "SZJnwT2Pi7Y1zL-uPHxFTA", "user_id": "VuqRVsNS1m1rMj7xqRDL3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "The service is outstanding the food is the best.

I immediately appreciated the atmosphere; definitely a hippy kind of vibe. They have plenty of options for the vegetarian/gluten-free folks out there, which I think is pretty cool. My boyfriend is very much a meat and potatoes type of person, but they had options for him as well. We had gotten coffee, and they have all different kinds of fixings for it: milk, cream, almond milk, sugar, and different sugar substitutes. I was pretty stoked they had a couple different kinds of water, too... When we had gone, they had cucumber/mint available which happens to be one of my favorites. I had ordered the veggie burrito, and he had ordered eggs and hashbrowns with bacon. My burrito was a little on the dry side, but otherwise just fine... the salsa was one of the best parts. He seemed satisfied with his breakfast, no different really from any other breakfast joint. It's a little on the pricey side (I believe it was 22 for the two entrees and two coffees), but if you want to feel good about supporting local businesses, especially those that cater to the alternative lifestyle, it's definitely worth a try."}, {"review_id": "RNqZuzlpbrhOmsdYMUhWKw", "user_id": "9txO4_yIT_Q_m3yPy4fH1w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/8/2017", "text": "The best part about this place is by far and away the atmosphere. I mean it was so cute! Very organic and earthy which is always great especially in a city like Wichita where places like this are just now becoming prevalent. I ordered the burrito, and it was good but lacked flavor. I feel that if I had ordered the pancakes or maybe even biscuits and gravy I would have had more luck. I would definitely like to go back and try other options!The little corner to the left when you walk in is so fun with all the different mugs and water and goodies. I think it's a special thing that a place like this came from almost nothing so their story is cool and their garden is even cooler!"}, {"review_id": "QTkfJRsWFLHZmBpZBfMuvw", "user_id": "GUfalQxi4DwaKi_oVfiSYw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Amazing food! Great atmosphere with great local items...but, sadly, I have had 2 experiences that have been rather slow. One time it took probably around 35min to get out food and there weren't but maybe 2 other tables with customers there.

Everything seems to be very healthy and they do have vegan options. Mind you, I love meat and never had a vegan burger before. I thought it'd be interesting to give it a try so that's what I ordered. It wasn't really my thing, to be honest. But looking back at it, there wasn't anything else on the menu that was appetizing to me. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure a lot of people would disagree.
