Wonderful place. Delicious food cooked perfectly to taste. Tried chicken satay, coconut prawn, and yellow chicken curry. They were fresh, cooked perfectly and so good. Sticky mango rice was not up to my expectation but was okay. I think they microwave the precooked sticky rice, it was half cooked. Overall a great place to have delicious food. The restaurant category shows food truck, which confused us and took sometime for us to find the place. This is an actual restaurant. Wonderful place and friendly staffs. Highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "_agutgRnSGKGm_R85nPIGg", "user_id": "YeCUG6vZLq8pOKbZfDCBEA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "I have been searching for over a year for a good Thai restaurant in Salem since moving from SoCal.

I can't decide which curry/soup is my favorite as they are all fabulous! Recently tried the blue green curry and practically licked the bowl clean-yum! Also, love the ginger lemongrass tea.

They have new items on the menu and some of the same as the truck.. It's all a yummy food. But, the Gai Wings are out of this world. Little grilled chicken wings sent from the food gods. They come with a sweet spicy sauce on a bed of lettuce surrounded by cucumbers SO darn Good. Get them! Seriously walk in sit down and order these wings I'm seriously serious.

Worth the wait. The owner cares about the food that is prepared for you. Amazing and good quality. Going to eat there weekly. ***** new update *****The test of time always is a good gage on a place to eat. I seem to be averaging 3-4 times a month right now eating here. Always good. Consistent quality and customer service. Thanks Guys. Can you open a second location in my driveway please?****** another update 2-7-2018****Tried out their new location. They have a new sit down full service location. It was just as good as the big blue trailer location. Service was excellent. They were training new employees and with a large crowd still were able to get our food out! To top it off we haven't been there for over a month and the owner noticed a shaved my beard... i don't even notice my wife's new hair cut and I see her every day. It Just can't get any better."}, {"review_id": "3xDdyaEswJnM8EmPnH8ITQ", "user_id": "NBbnmRooyhovGo9iGZ1mhA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/12/2017", "text": "Great food, friendly staff, and decent prices. My boyfriend and I came here to grab to-go orders on a Sunday and there was a flea market going on. We easily found parking on the street so it was not a big issue. I tried the peanut curry with chicken and it was delicious! It really hit my comfort zone and I was super happy at the end. There were a lot of vegetables and chicken in it and I was pretty full with the portion size. I wish it was a little bit more spicy, but that's just my preference. My bf tried the super best combo and he thought he was great. The ribs tasted amazing as well as the grilled pork. The papaya salad was BOMB. They were great and made it spicier for us (even though I thought everything could be a little bit more spicy). We also tried the potstickers, but they were nothing special to me. They were fully fried and I like them pan-fried on one side.They have a very limited menu and which they seem work really hard to put out the best quality. Will definitely come back again to try other things on their menu."}, {"review_id": "xinckID_gyFQ8z2OEshrFw", "user_id": "FwEpgGQRpHdxVVj6ueCkrA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "So this is a review for their opening day at their restaurant which I believe was on February 28th.  I can't remember everything we had but we did have the super best combo, Thai sausage, Gai Wings, A salad and Pot stickers. Overall I would give the food a 4 but definitely has potential for higher ratings.Service was just OK so a 3 but it was their opening day and they had some toilet problems.  So considering that and I put more weight on the food than service, it would be closer to 4 than a 3.  Rounding up it I would give it a 4."}, {"review_id": "3m9l7odo_-_MJFV84fjwxw", "user_id": "lnyeFdUGd-zOOtKcM-XwOA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/21/2017", "text": "I just tried this place for the first time, and I was a little hesitant because I don't usually eat from food trucks.
