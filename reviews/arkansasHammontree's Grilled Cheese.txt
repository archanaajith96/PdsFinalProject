My husband and I went there expecting it to be pretty good...and our expectations were definitely exceeded. I got The Scarlett Cheddar sandwich and paired it with the tomato soup. The perfect duo! And my husband got The Cheebacca sandwich, which was super flavorful! We also got the loaded sweet potato fry appetizer, and it was just as amazing as everything else. All in all, everything was so tasty! It's really too bad we don't live in the area, otherwise it would be a regular lunch favorite of ours! Definitely one of our favorite food places in our trip."}, {"review_id": "mzHh_sfgUtDVjmZ-MnywZA", "user_id": "LYDb1-rtaOZiLn7kEU1lew", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Having visited both Hammontree's locations, I prefer the Fayetteville spot. In general, the service is friendlier and more attentive. Our party of 6 popped in for a late lunch (4:00), and it was still packed. We waited ~30 minutes for a table, and were eventually seated at a booth near the back of the restaurant. It was a super tight squeeze but we made it work. My dad ordered an Irish coffee at the bar before we were seated, which I found out cost $12!! Thinking it had to be a mistake, we mentioned it to our server who confirmed that it was, in fact, an error, and the true cost was $7-8. He apologized profusely and comped the ones we ordered at the table. Onto the food - we opted for a variety of sandwiches, two hot dogs, one salad, and an order of sweet potato fries. The fries were an ample portion - hot, fresh and crispy. My sandwich (Chewbacca) was the perfect ratio of meat to cheesy, gooey goodness. They don't skimp on the filling, which is a huge plus. Our server, while friendly, disappeared at length several times which stretched the duration of our visit to a near unreasonable length (almost 2 hours). That being said, the quality of the food made up for it. There are few things more comforting than a grilled cheese sandwich on a cold day (this was late December). I would recommend coming at off-peak times to avoid the long wait, but that doesn't appear to exist. Ample lot and street parking!"}, {"review_id": "cHAlMtV2VZYULN_MUWwpqw", "user_id": "ngmAsPWmGMiduEgQEPkHhA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "This is by and far my favorite casual restaurant in Fayetteville. I've never had a negative experience here. I eat lunch here at least once a month. I've been a loyal customer for 3 years now. I've never once had a messed up meal or been displeased with the quality of the food. I'm usually a plain-Jane who enjoys a simple grilled ham and cheese sandwich, but their Cheebacca sandwich won me over instantly. I've never met a single person who didn't like to eat here.The atmosphere is casual, which makes it one of my favorite places to meet friends and coworkers for lunch. Weather permitting, their patio is my favorite place to sit. The downtown atmosphere is pleasant without being so busy that you can't focus on a conversation with your party. The parking is plentiful, and free before 2 o'clock. I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}, {"review_id": "sjFXSS2NbR3z98Wb4FF6sw", "user_id": "5nyy3fZESFumVIUenA9xkw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "After a long day driving from Shreveport to Little Rock now to Fayetteville we decided to come here to Hammontree's for an easy dinner of grilled cheese and tomato soup - the birds are chirping and it's a lovely night for us to decompress..."}, {"review_id": "x_xn2j_GT17ZvJ4qDNfWiw", "user_id": "UOih-yIgy2UaL3h8qG-kMA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "Stopped in here after reading the reviews on yelp and I wasn't disappointed. It appeared to be really busy but we got a table for the 4 of us within 10 minutes. The service was friendly enough but the server was very soft spoken but that's my biggest complaint about service! My husband ordered the Pig Sooie and I ordered the Honkie. We also ordered fried artichoke hearts which were INSANELY GOOD. My sandwich was supposed to come with smoked mayo and I didn't detect anything smoked about it. But the sandwich was still delicious. My husband ordered a sandwich that was supposed to come on thick cut jalapeño cornbread but it came on sourdough which was disappointing. The sandwiches come with chips, which isn't listed on the menu, so that was a nice surprise. The sandwiches range between $7-$9 which is a great price. They have beers on tap too. I liked this place, even though some of the options weren't available or communicated to us. I was very happy with what we got."}, {"review_id": "t6Bx8M10ir6opnmOGaPNvQ", "user_id": "dfm69NWJMqvLbQBKlaFd7w", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "The only upside to Hammontree's is the service. We had a hour wait and were told and even by the Yelp reviews that this was a must. Upon being seated we were greeted and brought our drinks quickly. We ordered the artichoke appetizers they were tasteless unless you submerged them in the dill sauce. The grilled cheese sandwiches were bland. I ordered one of the most requested grilled cheese and was disappointing.

Served very cold and it was not at all sweet as you might expect. It was somewhat strong on alcohol content although not sure what % was..Ordered the Bacon-Gouda sweet potato fries (7.75) which come with melted cheese, bacon, green onions served with avocado ranch dip. Extra dip will set you back $0.50...Very difficult to choose from the many choices. Ordered the Pig Sooie grilled sandwich. (8.25)BBQ pulled pork, caramelized onions, House cheese, jalepenos, and Sharp Cheddar on a jalepeno cornbread. SCRUMPTIOUS! Wasn't the cornbread I was expecting but wonderful choice and definitely had a strong kick in spice/ heat from peppers.

Hammontree's does it right. They have such a unique menu of sandwiches that you just can't recreate at home. And if you're taking your gluten-free bestie, they have a great selection of fun hot dogs as well as their SOUPS. Man, their soups. They're simple but the perfect addition to your plate. The service has never let me down and if you're at the Fayetteville location, look up because they have a giant pterodactyl hanging from the ceiling, which makes for some wonderful lunch/dinner conversation. My go to order - you can't go wrong with the Jack To The Future and a side of their tomato basil."}, {"review_id": "oovrv7pRE9TR3hxaa_EN1Q", "user_id": "WVFRm-ByPJsJLSfcMYC38Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Stopped in here for a late lunch, looking for something different.  Didn't have real high expectations... guess a should have.  Can't wait to come back to try something else on the menu!!  We had the Pig Sooie and a Build-your-Own --- and both were WAY better than we expected.  The atmosphere was real laid-back, the way we like it.  The servers were quite quirky... again, the way we like it.   The only negative that I could possibly think of is the size of the place; with limited seating, be prepared to wait a little, especially if it's a typical busy time."}, {"review_id": "p7odO_BlTyIEprqH2LRGpw", "user_id": "YhTQFj8dZOl_APgWAQ4VGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/23/2017", "text": "What do I even say about Hammontrees? It's been one of my favorite places in Fayetteville since it opened, and now that I live back in Oklahoma I make a point of stopping here every time I come through NWA (and I try not to come through on Sundays so I don't miss my chance). The food is incredible, and a great way to make all your friends happy--have someone that's hungover? Great place to eat. Have a vegetarian like me? I'm in love. You seriously can't go wrong.My go to is the half sandwich-half soup, with a special built myself cheesey goodness sandwich and the blackbean tortilla soup, which I could seriously eat every day. I also love the mix of local/regional beers and craft things I haven't tried before--there are always good drink options.Seriously people, go to Hammontrees!"}, {"review_id": "yCLvbDwzfoYyeOJTUHbCeg", "user_id": "azsJBbndMt74uTbSjaC_ZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/8/2017", "text": "Oh my goodness!
