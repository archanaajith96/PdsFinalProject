The good is great, the people are friendly is the eat-in service is incredibly fast! I always get the gyro pita and it's always bigger than I'm expecting. It's packed full of flavor and I never leave dissatisfied! Perfect quick food after work, post drunk food, or just a bite with friends on a casual night!The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that on my last visit, I had the falafel, and it was a bit dry. No amount of sauce would help. =("}, {"review_id": "UPYFIAbE77OrKLqaXa8y-Q", "user_id": "bMI2T02s60_SybKiNH-DDw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "This place is an excellent choice for the unapologetic meatarians and the militant vegans in your friend circle (I told you - food brings everyone together.)They have the best baba ganoush in town and it is not close. The texture is silky smooth and the flavour is a subtle combination of nutty-eggplanty-garlicky. The hummus is good too but the baba is stellar. Their soups, salads, and rice (!!) are all on point. You really can't go wrong. Their yellow lentil soup is vegetarian (probably vegan?) and is great with the rice. The falafels are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. You want those too.The manakeesh is my kind of \"pizza\" - less (or no) cheese, more flavour. Try the za'atar one for a light + tart flatbread that is coincidentally vegan.I usually go with the mashawi platter that has a great selection of their made to order kebabs (chicken, steak, shaped ground beef), a bracingly acidic Greek salad and hummus (that I always sub out for baba for an upcharge...because I am worth it) - with extra garlic sauce. Alternating bites of the juicy meat, crisp + tart salad, and silky/nutty baba will have you coming back for more.Also, can we take a minute to celebrate the garlic sauce? It is unapologetically garlicky and gives zero f**ks about anyone's need for subtlety. I love it and would like to carry a portable container of it to use with everything.Oh, and how could I forget their housemade pita? Forget the keto thing for this meal. Skip your next chain pizza mistake and double down on this pita. Fluffy and warm - I use it to scoop up everything I can here (every dip, salad, falafel, kebab, garlic sauce, etc.)The shawarma can be a bit of a crapshoot. My tip: Look at the swivelling spits of meat and pick the one that is not down to its last legs. (I understand the challenges of serving shawarma in Rochester where you don't have the guaranteed volume to keep the glistening meat fresh by serving it constantly.) Nevertheless I am always hopeful they will get the customers necessary to nail the shawarma thing eventually.The service is fast casual style. You order at the counter and take a table number. They bring you the food. They bus the tables when you are done. The owner is genuinely friendly and invested in making sure you love your food.Seriously, Cedar is it for Rochester's Lebanese food scene. Get there with a group of friends and order everything."}, {"review_id": "-Sv9pDf2co7CVLzZycToiw", "user_id": "JVVjAYPY2r2BUWd9RjfLkw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "For an inexpensive dinner with a generous helping of food, this is the spot. This is not a restaurant where there server comes to your table, you order from the menu above and get a number where the staff brings out the food to your table when it is ready. I ordered the falafel which was light and airy with a crispy edge and soft center. The gyro was packed with a healthy helping of lamb. Very casual atmosphere. Staff was friendly and the food came out in little time. Only issue, which is not the restaurant's fault, but mine own was that I grabbed what I thought was milk from the choices of drinks. Ended up with a yogurt drink instead. Again, my fault, but when grabbing for drinks, my recommendation is to read the label."}, {"review_id": "Qr2iQoAtyDK4GZ3FIYTobg", "user_id": "IeWHypMzaosVCFe2_-VXWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/22/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "UPDATED from 4 to 5 stars!!I got the shawarma plate with chicken and beef shawarma. It also came with a Greek salad and hummus. The hummus was incredible. Chicken shawarma was very moist, soft, flavorful, delicious. It had some sort of a white spicy - like horseradish - sauce on it, I'm not sure if I liked it. The steak shawarma reminded me of Chinese-type steak meat. Kinda tough, grainy, and not much flavor. It had a tahini sauce on it or something. Greek salad was good, standard. Dressing was great. The inside is really nice, I like how I can watch the shawarma being cooked and my meal being prepared. They provide super quick service. Very friendly, great service. I will definitely be back. I had to update my review from 4 stars to 5. Their food is just amazing. I hear their pitas are the best because they are fresh made in store (you can watch them cook from the front counter). The staff are amazing, too."}, {"review_id": "nH1voFCfa0sK-kvcglHs0w", "user_id": "gOG1sjv4ojL-txt3NG5qFg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "Ehhhh, I've heard amazing things, so maybe we just hit up Cedars on an off night? Stopped by to grab dinner for my boyfriend and myself on a Friday night. It was super busy, with a fairly long queue to order, but the line went quickly. I ordered a chicken shawarma plate (which I was told by a coworker comes with rice) and falafel. My order was out pretty fast, and everyone working there was super nice. I grabbed some plastic cutlery on my way out and headed to my boyfriend's work (he was working late). First of all, the falafel was amazing. Crispy on the outside and light, fluffy, perfectly seasoned heaven on the inside. We loved it and it was definitely the best part of the meal. The chicken shawarma plate didn't come with rice, which, okay, whatever, maybe I misheard. There was a very nice, standard salad, and some nice hummus. It was fine.But the chicken was burnt... like black, burnt to a crisp (see photo). And it was drizzled with a super garlicky sauce that was almost too strong for us to eat... just super disappointing and we couldn't eat it. Not sure if we'll be back for anything but the falafel, but we'll see."}, {"review_id": "xJ2Q86cN_xtUTZ4cmTP4zA", "user_id": "l91OHfTqmmYPbelgEkTSgw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "One of the best mediterranean dining experiences i've ever had.

It is the perfect balance of creamy and savoury and not at all bitter. Perfection with the fresh flat bread. They do vegetarian beautifully here. So much that their veggie rice is tasty enough that it can be enjoyed alone.Their pitas are very affordable and with generous fillings, though the chicken I had was on the dry side. In all honestly, the vegetarian plates and menu items is what shines for me. The manakeesh with eggs and lebanese sausage is tasty, but it lacks on the juicy side. This one was a bit dry for me and left me yearning for something else. Also, points deducted for the lack of packaging. Instead of a pizza take out bag or box, it was put on a picnic plate and placed in a plastic take out bag...uncovered and unwrapped. I will stick with what I like on my return visits :-)"}, {"review_id": "tDED2Z2WRHpUewcHmoZL_Q", "user_id": "nT7NV1ECZ8uL2FArFm0SFw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/1/2017", "text": "The owner used to be at Sinbad's on mount hope Ave.Delicious salads and shawarma!!!

Our friends recommended this place, having heard some good things about it, and we decided to do takeout.This place is popular and pretty busy, but the guys working there are working HARD! They move so fast and put together stuff so quickly that their hands are almost a blur. They also have time to be warm and friendly. It's really awesome to watch them bake the pita on the special oven they have, a fun entertainment while you wait for your food.So we ordered a LOT of takeout: several shawarma plates, labneh, baba ganouj, and they ended up giving us an entire separate bag of just pita.  We took it all back to the house and had an enormous feast. Everything was really incredibly yummy! All our shawarma plates were loaded with veggies, rice, hummus, meats, and all of it was fresh and flavorful. The prices are also hard to beat!And that pita. SO GOOD. I totally want to go back here next time I'm in Rochester.

The inside is really clean with booths and tables for dining in. Grab some menus in front of the cashier, it has more options than the blackboard menu hanging above the kitchen. Place your order at the counter, take a number, and the food is brought to your table. I had the beef/lamb and chicken shawarma combo plate. It comes with the meats, hummus, a huge fluffy pita bread and your choice of rice or salad. I chose the rice. The chicken was more flavorful than I expected but quite dry. The beef/lamb was the total winner between the meats. It had a smokey flavor and the texture of the meat is not too tough. The rice (I got the yellow type) was seasoned well. The hummus was a bit plain for me, you do get a lot of it though....The pita bread was so fluffy and soft, I'd love to buy just a pack of them.The best part of the plate was the pickles! They are light and tangy and oh so yummies. My boyfriend had the kebbe plate. It also came with hummus and rice and a pita bread. I loved the flavor of the meat. The spices were excellent and the texture was awesome. We also tried the eggs and sausage manakeesh. It's kinda like a small pizza, and for $4 you get a lot of it! The manakeesh was quite plain though. To spice it up a bit we added hot sauce. It helped the flavor a lot and I ended up really liking it. Overall a pretty good meal. I do prefer the meats at El Basha more though. Cedar's pita bread however is a definite winner :)"}, {"review_id": "1DIzxkLGr1LpERqmwsQTqA", "user_id": "7ztAjvMS3BXfr0pSpV-AUA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/6/2017", "text": "This place is an excellent addition to the Monroe Ave strip. The only reason I'm docking a star is because the wait for our food was extremely long. About half an hour. The management was very apologetic but since the place is advertised as fast causal, we were not expecting to wait that long. The good: they make their pitas fresh. It's amazing. Seriously. The hummus was delicious, we got the gyro and chicken shawarma pita pockets and it was very filling (and very cheap). The baklava was heavenly. They're definitely doing something right.
