Seriously Cobble Hill has the most amazing food and atmosphere. The menu is absolutely exquisite. Each time I've visited it's been a completely different culinary experience. There's really no reason to go anywhere else for that special dinner.  I've lived and dined all over the world and Cobble Hill continues to shine bright in my eyes."}, {"review_id": "sZBCPVcDnPMvApifpbfHlA", "user_id": "WSF-GQyvTp4-HNz_B1P0HQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Simply phenomenal. Everything about this place, the ambiance, the staff, the food, it all just feels so above and beyond. Vintage artwork decorates the beautiful brick walls. Minimal lighting paired with candlelit tables create an intimate space despite the high ceilings. The service is always outstanding. A hostess quickly seats you and a member of the waitstaff soon visits to provide any clarifications about the menu. The menu has been different each time I've visited as it is dependent on what is available from the local farms. We last visited during Cedar Rapids restaurant week and were blown away (as usual). We were treated to Parisian gnocchi and beech mushrooms smothered in mushroom butter and smoked almonds. The dish was delightfully light and tangy. I really wish I had the ability to make such delicate gnocchi (they were basically potato marshmallows). Cuban mojo pork shoulder set on a light bed of black beans and herb salad made up the second course. Oh and lightly fried plantains to top it off! To finish the meal, we had Cobble Hill's AMAZING macrons with carmal gelato. The only negative thing I'd say is this was my first macrons experience and I don't think I'll ever top it."}, {"review_id": "WTMGKcVmfkniExehqX4heA", "user_id": "arcfRYBPNpDCr2tTkf6K4w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Our favorite restaurant experience to date in Cedar Rapids. Foodie's delight, the way food should be done. From the chef's starter - a lovely surprise bite to begin the meal, to starters (gnocchi, charcuterie board) to a broccoli purée bisque, entrees (we had salmon & flatiron steak), to dessert (raspberries & chocolate), our party of 4 ate the whole experience up and left more than satisfied. Great service & beverage selection as well. Well done Cobble Hill!"}, {"review_id": "9pbb4xRMmOu9iHC-2s3Lcw", "user_id": "grqNZxGn8asrVFGZp2rkZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Visiting COE College for my son and decided to stop by here for dinner.  Found this place courtesy of YELP.  The reviews did not disappoint.  Their farm to table concept is very impressive. Started with the mussel and fried skate appetizers and they were amazing! Per my husband... one of the best mussel dish he has had ever! For the main dishes, we had the duck breast and flat iron steak.  Both were amazing! Cooked perfectly, tender and very flavored.  As for dessert, the dark chocolate cake with raspberry sorbet and hazelnut eclair (tonight's dessert of the day) were the perfect way to end an amazing meal!  Coming from Southern CA where the food scene is fierce,   Cobble Hill can compete with the best of them.

Maybe the best in Cedar Rapids. Farm fresh and locally sourced. Rapidally rotating menu based on what's available and in season. They do it right here. My absolute favorite dish was the Peking duck. In fact it was one of the best dishes I've ever had anywhere. Tender, perfectly cooked, and matched well with that smoky sweet hoison sauce. And I loved their creativity in bringing free tasters from the kitchen. One of them was maybe the best little cooked fresh tomato I've ever had. They also have local craft beers on tap, which is always attractive to me."}, {"review_id": "a_Mnp9wTucwQgHJOz_RlGw", "user_id": "Ry2eEdDFbB3jCd-puLq0bg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/15/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Cobble baby, Cobble baby, Cobble baby, Cobble, yeah.This one of the fancier restaurants in Cedar Rapids, looks like something out of the big city put in Iowa's second biggest city. For starters I had the pomegranate lemonade that was so good and had a metal straw, if you haven't had one it makes the drink that much colder. I then had the split pea soup, very good soup that has a rich flavor. For my entree I had the short ribs that comes with parsnip puree, port braised red cabbage, crispy shallots, apple-parsley horseradish salad. All of it was delicious but the portions are very small for $26, the quality is there but they could give a little more.For desert I tried the apple brioche donuts accompanied with chai ice cream, milk caramel jam, compressed sliced apples. This dish was amazing, but for $8 only 4 small donut holes come with it. This is a great restaurant overall, worth a try if your in town and want a nice dinner."}, {"review_id": "75E8B0XAOOrLkVOfkwM5LA", "user_id": "q9iPzoPRYQCABTFg3n2wEQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/23/2017", "text": "Negroni, sazerack, manhatten, oh my!! Where do I start? I have stopped in to this lovely little restaurant a few times and just haven't had a chance to write a review yet. I normally take clients here when I'm in town, but this trip was different. It was a Thursday night and I didn't have anyone to attend to, I was truest looking forward to heading out on my own. I decided that since I wanted to have a few drinks and possibly a bite that it was in best interest to sit at the bar. I was very fortunate to have, what I believe was, the bar manager as my mixologist and server. She was amazing from start to finish! I began my experience with a negroni and cucumber gazpacho. The gazpacho is delivered as it should be, dry, and the broth is poured over the ingredients after each is explained. It was absolutely to die for! After another cocktail or two I decided to move on to a main dish. I was told before hand that they were out of the roasted lamb and it had been replaced by the same preparation only with scallops as the protein, being that I am originally from Maine I was very excited to give this a try!! The preparation was with sweet pea purée, potato chive croquette, lemon, pistachio, and it was everything that I expected it to be and more! After a few bartender recommended cocktails I decided that it was time to call an Uber and find  my way back to my hotel.The experience was fantastic, as I expected it to be, the conversation was captivating, it's great being in the company of other foodies, and with her husband being a chef, she had many fantastic recommendations in other cities around the US, which I will inevitably visit thanks to her, and overall it was a relaxing evening out. I appreciate the opportunity to be able to support local establishments that really make their patrons feel appreciated.

I settled on a duck breast which was prepared very well and was very tasty. My coworker had the pork belly which was also delicious.

Staff is wonderful. They generously offered samples of the drinks on special to try before ordering. The food... beautifully plated with nice flavors.Locally sourced ingredients usually call for higher prices, but the quality and portions did not balance that out. The menu used accurate but pretentious descriptions of the entrees. Our group ordered pho and cannelloni. The cannelloni was meat free and just not enough to fill anyone up. The meat in the pho was so full of stringy fat that it could not be chewed. Ruined the appetite. For a table of 5 with drinks the bill ran just under $200 before gratuity."}, {"review_id": "DULyCh0u7V7qKf693kfX2Q", "user_id": "cX-PsH1edGvBg0RvK-0c2g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/21/2017", "text": "Fancy!  High class deliciousness.Do you enjoy fancier places? This would be one to go to. First, highly recommend calling for a reservation. Our night could been thrown off if we had not lucked out. We went almost right after opening on a Saturday night. The hostess asked if we had a reservation and we held our breath as we said no. She let us know that they mainly work from reservations but obviously had lots of room and ushered us right in. *Phew*We had read that it was a nicer place and had dressed up for an event after dinner so we didn't give it away that we were not used to this much fancy... well not right away anyway. The waitress was very patience with us as we had a lot of questions on what we were looking at on the menus. The menus change from time to time. She also gave us the specials of the night. We knew we were over our heads when we tried to figure out the menus. After even more questions we finally decided on our meals. Hubby decided to get a beer and talked me into a happy hour drink. It was a martini and it was very good. I think it was an old fashion. We had time to look around at the nice interior. Set up very well and at the far end of the restaurant the kitchen was out in the open where you can see everything that they are doing. I liked that.Before the meal she brought us a little mini something on a plate. It was a little cracker, with a nice jelly and a mint leaf on top. We giggled a little but the flavor was very yummy to remember. We did splurge and get oysters on a half shell. We learned that you can get 2 types of oysters. The east coast and the west coast. I snickered as this was over my head and again had to have her explain. One is brinier than the other. We got a small order and I was pleasantly surprised that we could have this good of tasting sea food in the central IA. My meal was the special which was penne pasta with duck. This was a decent serving in a nice big bowl. If they had not told me it was duck, I don't think i would have ever known. The meat was good and think sliced almost shredded. The perfect size for me. Hubby was a bit hungry and ordered the Korean style Short Ribs. This is when we could tell how fancy it was here. Just more than we are used to. The plate that was brought out was huge...the meal however, was only on about  1/3 of that plate if that. On/with the ribs is was brussels sprout kimchi, lemongrass-beef jus, scallion rice, fried oyster, peanut.(per the menu) It was very tasty as well, just smaller portion than used to and very pretty, plus no bones, but that is the style of the Korean ribs.Although Hubby was still a bit hungry when we left, our pretty penny was well spent I thought. It was a great experience. The ambience and the people very friendly and willing to help. I recommend getting in your reservation, putting on your fancy pants, and taking that special someone out for a fancy night out if you are in town."}, {"review_id": "ZmbjrsD_n0Q3shoZ-l9mbQ", "user_id": "0kO7hJr9Gpxx4cWAIIwr-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/19/2017", "text": "As soon as I walked in I felt it was going to be a great experience and I wasn't wrong!

After reading that the chef was a James beard award winner - it sounded like just the place.First impressions upon entering, tall dark brick walls with subdued lighting, heavy wooden tables, well spaced between them, a small but ample bar area with a great cocktail program. A farm to table chalk board as you enter, lists all the local ingredients on the menu for the evening. The hostess greeted us and seated us immediately, and our server showed up shortly after (she never introduced herself to my knowledge - even asked my wife afterwards and she could not recall either) asked us about our drinks and suggested we order everything at the same time (a convenience for her perhaps?) Starting with the east/west oysters on the half shell - the east coast N*38 were large succulent and a bit on the salty side and quite tasty, the west coast Compass Points were small, compact and loaded with flavor, served with sweet pickled onions and the house made hot sauce (presented in amber dropper bottles) was a great combination (fiery hot full flavored but not over the top hot). Perhaps the best part of my meal.I ordered the local brewery; a Chocolate Stout from Lions Bridge Brewing - it was a great stout, full bodied, rich and thick with a nice head and deep chocolate undertones. My wife decided on a house special cocktail \"Apples on the Bow?\" a combination of apple reduction and dark rum topped with a sweet gingered apple cube - she said it was very tasty and had well balanced flavor profiles.My appetizer I went for the Chinese Five Spice Pork belly (a skewer of three small pieces pork belly over a medley consisting of shaved daikon, ginger pickled mushrooms, and charred scallions) it was very flavorful and could have been amazing but, the pork belly was way over cooked, dry and hard to cut through. A good dish but nowhere 5 star great.The father-in-law chose the Sautéed Calamari with green papaya salad, crispy shallots, nuoc Cham and cilantro, he said it was very good and quite tasty and the best part of his meal. My wife decided to try the fried Arancini (a combination of fresh mozzarella puff, pickled red onion, baby spinach and house cured salami) for an appetizer - it was a nice crisp, fried puff ball exterior with a creamy cheese center mixture, the onions, spinach and salami served on the side. She said it was very good and my sample tasting agreed. My wife and father-in-law both decided on the roasted Lamb loin with herb spätzle, Chinese broccoli, black garlic purée, laughing bird shrimp and orange, the presentation was very nice, but both said that the protein was overcooked and hard to cut. Not what you expect from a loin cut.I went for the Berkshire Pork loin with a medley of sea island peas, sugar snap peas, candied rhubarb, and fresh watercress garnish. Berkshire pork is known for its great marbling and similarity to fine marbled beef. Unfortunately this was not the case, the flavors were sort of there and it looked like a regular cut of pork loin, and sadly again very tough to cut, not what I was expecting or hoping for. It was a let down.After the disappointing entrees we did not order dessert.Again, with all the high reviews we were expecting a great memorable meal and got just okay, not bad by any means but @ 200$ for dinner for three - we expected better entrees at the 25-29$ price point they were asking. Would we return? Maybe, but again most likely not. A stand out - Kyle (the expediter/back runner) went above and beyond and a thank you.3 stars - good not great.00385"}, {"review_id": "FN2guTx1ZgIWTJXiWCop5Q", "user_id": "sjR8f4rrm7YoVzegrTOFyQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "We started with an amuse bouche, which was good, followed by the charcuterie, which was also good.  The charcuterie had a decent variety of selections with a very savory lamb meatball and a very subtle pate.  The butternut squash selection was strong, but my family was sharing and one of us liked it enough to finish it.  We ordered two braised lambs and a Hereford pork.  The positives, each was cooked perfectly. The lamb was juicy and well braised.   The negatives were that the lamb included 4 kebabs of lamb, two small potatoes, olives and a generous portion of lettuce.  My wife and I both thought it was not enough for a full entree.  In addition, we were informed the preparation included Moroccan spices and an au jus, but having had Moroccan food I can say there was no flavor of any spice even remotely Moroccan.  In fact, the lamb and the pork lacked any descernible seasonings.  Overall, having seen the reviews and ratings we expected a satsifying flavorful meal and got well cooked food that was overpriced, under seasoned, and underportioned.  Service was friendly and fairly attentive,  although parking was abysmal.  Dinner for three with the app came to a little over $110.00 and was not worth it."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/cobble-hill-cedar-rapids-2?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
