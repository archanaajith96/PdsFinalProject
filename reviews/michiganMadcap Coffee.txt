Has an East Coast vibe and the staff is fantastic. Certain Espresso is for dine in only. Pretty busy for a Saturday at 4pm. Even with it being busy I was in and out in under 10 minutes. I ordered the Latte to go and will definitely recommend this coffee spot. I like the all black to go cups. Cool place all around and inexpensive."}, {"review_id": "l2Te_XmN-HdmrNZ-NSObqw", "user_id": "opdbggrufvUGH8gP9wHL8w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "After years and years of hearing about an amazing little coffee shop in Grand Rapids, Michigan from people all over the country, I finally got to visit and give them a try. I liked every bit of my experience, and here's why this roaster and cafe is so great:1) The pour-over coffee: I got a flight, which included three very generous portions of each of their featured coffees (probably 20-24 oz of coffee in total!). All three were amazing, and I would recommend this option to anyone who visits for the first time (or just wants to drink a lot of coffee!) This came with a flyer that explained all about the farms where the coffee was grown and the farmers that helped grow it...a nice touch. 2) The espresso: I got an americano, and it was one of the best americanos I have ever had. Perfectly portioned espresso to water ratio and a very sweet and chocolaty flavor made it really great. 3) The service: super nice and attentive: they explained all about the coffee and how they were brewing it. Really cool.4) The space: Lots of different seating options, from counters on the windows and at the coffee bar, to tables, to comfy chairs. Lots of outlets too! Clean bathrooms too.5) The wifi: fast and free!All in all, a great coffee experience!"}, {"review_id": "11GbPjWHhrqs5qrIb8CuUw", "user_id": "6IYHNjQbmjAlWi3U14EgzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Very cool atmosphere, got that hipster vibe on lock!

I've even seen Madcap beans sold at Hi-Collar, a coffee shop in New York, to much surprise.Why only three stars? They don't serve almond milk, due to the claim that it is environmentally unfriendly. This would appear to be a respectable decision, were it not for the fact that dairy appears to be significantly less friendly than almond milk. While almond milk production is rumored to be water-intensive, at 23 gallons of water per gallon of milk, dairy is produced with an even higher rate use at 30 gallons of water per gallon of milk. Coffee itself is said to require 37 gallons of water for a single cup of coffee. I'm going to assume that Madcap purchases responsibly-produced milk, free of hormones, antibiotics, etc., but cows still produce methane, with the environmental effects that follow. And what about other non-dairy options? In place of almonds, they might consider hemp or macadamia - at a minimum (although my least favorite), oat. At present, they offer only coconut, which rarely pairs very well with espresso. I'm impressed with the decision to not serve almond milk based on environmental ethics, but am afraid it's more trendy than structurally sound. I'd be happy to be presented with facts to the contrary.On the last day of our trip, we swung by Rowster. I was happy to find that they offer almond milk, but even happier to find that theirs is made in-house. If you prefer your espresso drinks with almond milk, I'd highly recommend paying them a visit."}, {"review_id": "dh_bgUc7aoTL5NvSxSPS5A", "user_id": "lu5KOgcNEKJViITBDUqSuQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "I'm a huge fan of Madcap Coffee. Their dedication to the space and transparency about the product is so enjoyable. The coffee is expensive, but you'll always know where it came from and when it was roasted. I typically brew using a French press and can definitely see, smell, and taste a difference based on how recently the coffee was roasted.I also appreciate that Madcap serves a proper macchiato (even if it is unfortunate that certain chain coffee shops have distorted this to the point that Madcap baristas need to ask about it). The tea is also excellent. In short, Madcap is one of my favorite places in town to hang out, have a meeting, or enjoy a luxurious brew."}, {"review_id": "LagkuSfxux2tr9JuphiODw", "user_id": "twkITmR14WGMvzA2sqaR2Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Walked from my hotel to grab a good local cup of coffee. The location of this place is great. Right downtown, easy to get to, and a great view. The two guys working were very polite. I ordered the mocha. It had a great flavor and was smooth. The atmosphere seemed very relaxed and I was bummed I couldn't sit down to enjoy my drink. My only negative would be the price of the drink for the quantity. I would say it was a little on the small side but you're definitely paying for quality.

I just don't frequent this location enough because I don't work downtown or find myself downtown too often during the daytime. Working from home and I am hankering for a coffee shop to work at, I don't pick this place because parking isn't easy. Sorry, but it is the truth. If parking were better, I would come WAY more often. Glad they have the Fulton Street location now because I find myself there a lot more now!Every time I do come in here though I always appreciate the knowledge and friendliness of the baristas. They always know the answers to my questions and provide very knowledgeable answers at that. I always see people working in here and I can definitely see why. I would definitely walk here and work while staring out the window as people walk by. They have great windows for that!Their coffee selection is always outstanding. Many options to choose from and many delicious options to choose at that!"}, {"review_id": "tFJyKuEUg2hm7FSgw-i8vg", "user_id": "R0rngHOUs_m7Yhx5ts50gA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "Grand Rapids classic. Madcap truly reformed the coffee experience in Grand Rapids. So if you're visiting GR and are downtown then you should come here. They know how to roast and prepare a good coffee bean. I'd recommend their pour over or just buying a bag of their coffee to take home. They don't really offer many specialty beverages - they stick to the classics, but they do the classics well. Sometimes their coffee can be cold though."}, {"review_id": "CMel5bXTU17CCwloReDGWg", "user_id": "XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2017", "text": "Hit up Madcap on my way out of Grand Rapids based on the recommendation of a friend.

Yes! PLEASE! The coffee flight was a great way for me to taste a variety of their coffees on my first visit.It has the familiar simple open atmosphere serving their own beans in pour-over brewed coffee.  I also ordered a latte for my companion and snuck a taste and it was on par with the best lattes I've had at coffee shops in Chicago, Indianapolis, Portland, Denver, Seattle, DC, NYC, Australia, etc.! To be honest, I had no expectations of coffee in Grand Rapids until I noticed a shop in my home town selling/using their beans!

It's very bitter. But that could just be how that method makes drinks taste. I'm just saying, not my cup of coffee :PI tried the espresso on the last visit, I ordered a cappuccino. Price was $3.75. It was adorable. The barista takes the time to make a design with the steamed milk, today it was a heart.

Very similar aesthetic, but the quality is light-years behind. I'm glad Madcap has been working to elevate the coffee culture in GR for nearly a decade, but I just don't think the quality comes close to matching the hype."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/madcap-coffee-grand-rapids?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
