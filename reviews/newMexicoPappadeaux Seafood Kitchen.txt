I will definitely be back.It is Louisiana style seafood with a few local New Mexico twists thrown in. I started with the Oysters Pappadeaux. Amazing. Had the Santa Fe Ale. My style beer, amazing. Main course was the Naked Haddock with substituted Red Beans and Rice. Simply phenomenal. At this point the manager came over and introduced himself and offered us a complimentary dessert for myself and my wife. We tried the creme brulee and preline bread pudding topped with ice cream. This was so rich and no less than perfect. The chef's attention to detail was incredible down to the powdered sugar on the dessert. If I hadn't looked outside to see the Sandia mountains, I would swear I was in New Orleans. Great food, and this is coming from someone skeptical to eat seafood in the middle of the dessert. You owe it to yourself to at least try it if you are sitting on the fence."}, {"review_id": "ZUZ3_x6oiNCWO0zjlGbFfA", "user_id": "ZmZZnouTlXPkORi-U1bI6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "I always have such an enjoyable experience when sitting at the bar.

We also had a few mixed drinks that were made perfectly. Best pasta I ever had. Amazing food and superior customer service. Tell the bartenders I got andouilled that night. Ha!*Stopped by in mid January and had a fabulous experience and good conversation with the female bartender that afternoon as well.

The food was amazing. It was the poor service. A service level I don't expect from a normally 5 star restaurant. Let me explain. First I called ahead and made a reservation which I'm have gotten on a Friday night which I'm sure is a busy night. I arrived a little early but was seated right at my reservation time. After being seated it didn't take long for the server to come over to take drink orders. She brought drinks and said she would be back to take our order. She disappeared for literally like 15min. When she returned so took our food order and said she would be back with bread. That didn't happen till 15min later. Finally appetizers arrived and food arrived. My wife ordered extra shrimp and tomatoes which didn't come out. Server said she would check on it and came back with 1 shrimp and extra tomatoes after she was halfway done with the meal. The server was extremely friendly and professional however the slow service was still unacceptable. You would expect an organization like this is prepared for a busy night and server staff would help each other out. On this night they failed to this one important job. I have been to this restaurant (in different cities) before and have never had such a bad level of service. So my review strictly applies to this location. I spoke to the manager and she was gracious and apologized but my review remains until I see different. I will try again but no time soon."}, {"review_id": "WwZZK9jx533WHUgjDItTkA", "user_id": "jnJf26dkmW6vowC4eh70PQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Happy Hour time can be a blast with friends. But, what if your solo? I was on me own (waiting for someone to finish her girlfriend party nearby). I decided to frequent the bar at Pappadeaux. When I arrived at 5:30 pm the bar was pretty much empty. A warm welcome greeted me. Soon the bar filled up. I had lively conversations with the bartenders and new friendly strangers sitting next to me. But, the star was the \"Happy Hour\" boiled shrimp (8 large succulent shrimp in a nice slightly hot sauce), with a boiled skin on small potato and a half a cob of corn. The food was delicious and more than hit the spot. Washing it down with a pint of La Cumbre Beer. My initial loneliness, now \"Elevated\". I now have an excellent solo party spot..:).

Our server was great and knowledgeable and was able to accommodate all our needs too.I got the chilean sea bass with a side salad. This was a pretty hefty dish, and I ate it all....was way too full afterwards but yummy! The parmesan crab sauce was amazing too. This made the dish pretty unhealthy, but oh well. The sea bass was super tender and juicy with every bite. I also got a taste of the fried alligator, which was a crowd favorite.

So I won't waste too much time retreading the same dishes and just tell you that once again, Pappadeaux never ceases to amaze us with their consistent recipes and execution. What made this particular location on point though, was the service.On this night, we were graced with the presence of the head waiter. The result of which...was some of the best service we've had in a long while. This guy had charisma, cordiality, and you could tell he really likes his job. He also knew a lot about the menu which I found helpful when I had a question about the Maine lobster dish. Ultimately, I ended up sticking with my usual go-to: the Caribbean lobster tail. However, I decided to try a new side dish, as well as a new appetizer. So we'll discuss those.First, we have the lump crab cake appetizer. The wife and I split just the one, since usually you're taking a big risk ordering crab cakes outside of Maryland. Seriously, it's almost always a hit or miss with crab cakes because every restaurant has their own way of making them. Sometimes it doesn't always work. Here? It...*sorta* worked, for the most part. It was good, but not quite perfect. Whilst I loved the taste and flavor of the crab meat itself combined with the cream sauce it comes with, there were two things I found slightly odd about this appetizer.1.) The presentation of the dish: this thing gets delivered to us inexplicably covered in ultra-thin potato sticks. So much so that you cannot see the crab cake itself. I would have taken a picture, but it would have been pointless. The whole thing looked like someone took a can of potato sticks and dumped them onto a plate. Seriously, what was the point of that??2.) This crab cake is pan seared with bread crumbs, which I normally don't mind. Except the outside coating seemed extra thick to me for some reason. It's almost like the whole thing was deep fried. But luckily it didn't take any flavor away from the crab meat inside, so I'm gonna give this dish a 7 out of 10; bizarre presentation notwithstanding.Second new thing I decided to try tonight was something called the \"Papparelle Pasta\". Obviously, I took a picture of this because it's kinda tricky to describe. Even the waiter had a tough time accurately describing the dish. Because I don't think it quite tasted the way I expected. It's served in a white wine sauce with tomatoes, mushrooms, parmesan cheese and egg noodles (first time I've eaten noodles of this shape, too). So I was bit surprised at how shockingly bland this was. It was also tough to finish (which I didn't) because the portion size looked like it was meant for two people.Anyway, we still had a terrific dinner! I'd give the service a 9, the main course an 8, and the new pasta side a 6. Ergo, the law of averages demand that I grant this Pappadeaux located in the land of enchantment: 4 charismatic head waiters out of 5."}, {"review_id": "EmSatdkzeW1ciFI4EqeOFQ", "user_id": "RsIBwaU0srby1ANQAjFjqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "Pappadeauxs has never let me down!

Outside of making the 3-4 hour drive to ABQ, the closest I've been to a Pappadeaux is in the airport, but apparently I always fly to early because they're never open. So as you can imagine when we were in the area this past weekend, there was no way my husband was going to let me pass up on this opportunity.I was a little hesitant to actually go in once we were in the parking lot because their parking lot was filled to the brim, but what I found was a restaurant that is deceivingly large (with a great sized patio might I add). No wait to be seated whatsoever.With quite a large restaurant comes a large staff. We ended up being seated near the kitchen which I didn't totally love because all of the staff congregates there while waiting to serve their next table. That being said, our waitress was phenomenal and I remember thinking \"I could be friends with this girl.\" She was pleasant, fast, friendly, and somehow down to Earth. I should've got her name because I would've totally given her a shout out in this review, but if that is any indication on the rest of the staff I think you'll be in good hands regardless of who your server is.Let me start this next part by saying, we ordered too much. They serve complimentary bread and butter that would've been just fine as our started since we're only two people and I tend to overdo it on bread, but we also ordered the lump crab and spinach dip (which also comes with bread) as well as a cup of the lobster bisque for each of us. The spinach dip was my favorite part of the meal (not to say everything else wasn't good). Creamy and tasty and the garlic bread was perfect... I also overdid it with the spinach dip. The lobster bisque was good, but I'd describe it as perfectly ordinary. For myself I ordered the shrimp creole and grits which was pretty spicy in a good way. The grits were perfectly cooked and it was all in a creamy tomato-y sauce.Overall, I enjoyed my experience and I thought the food was tasty. It is pretty pricey so you'll spend a pretty penny, but with everything we ordered and drinks I was expecting our bill to be $100+ before the tip and was surprised when it was $89... so not as pricey as it seems, but I felt like there were a lot of $20+ dishes so be prepared either way."}, {"review_id": "b5TjwRS_1UJ5_TU9RylJeA", "user_id": "HKU3nGHLjcyLvGKVm05EaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "I got to eat some true \"MUD BUGS\"...
