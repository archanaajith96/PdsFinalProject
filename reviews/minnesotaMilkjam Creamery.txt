My go to ice cream shop!I love their ever-changing menu of flavors (they have a few classics that stay in the menu as well). Allows me to try something new every time I stop by. They have such unique flavors. Ive never been disappointed by their selection. It's a little expensive but It's really good & I think it's worth it. The staff are always nice & welcoming. They always allow you to sample however many flavors you want. They always have featured sundaes which are always great. They have jam buns, which is like an ice cream sandwich made with a glaze donut (from glamdoll donuts) & your favorite flavor of Milkjam ice cream. They have a few table and chairs & when it's nice outside they have limited outdoor seating as well. They have a small parking lot around the side otherwise there's plenty of street parking."}, {"review_id": "nLsI-QjLWlm9gi2obHB1tQ", "user_id": "kbyxFChwMzukTasy9lRHTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Best ice cream parlor in the twin cities.Milkjam has everything going for it: cool unique flavors; trendy interior design; nice location within walking distance of uptown; and above all, insanely delicious ice cream!

My boyfriend and i ordered a scoop of PB vs Everybody and Ridin' Duuurty in an icecream sandwich. PB vs Everybody had a strange flavor that I couldn't pinpoint and I couldn't taste the banana (a flavor which usually overpowers all other flavors). Both icecreams were very icy rather than creamy and the cookies on the iceream sandwich were hurt your teeth hard.Total bill was $10 which seems expensive for what it is. Maybe we caught them on a bad day, but Milkjam seems a bit overrated to me."}, {"review_id": "UcgcjA3fwFpvx2P1zfNCvw", "user_id": "iRwVOc-Q1DW1tT0MuTK4kQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "Ice cream is a must when I go visit anywhere. Heard good things from some friends about this place so I decided to stop by. I tried the thai tea and black, which both captivated me. Thus, I asked the guy helping me out if I could get one of each of the flavors. I guess he wasn't really paying attention to me, or was just trying to take my money, and he goes oh you mean all of them? I looked on the menu and \"all of them\" is a scoop of each flavor available which is 58 dollars. BOY YOU TRIPPIN. He seemed like he wanted to get out of the there, not really wanting to do his job. For a single scoop and a double scoop, it totaled out to be a little over 11 dollars. Both flavors were delicious - Thai tea was as expected, and the black, which was described as cocoa, tasted like the cookies of oreos. These were the only two flavors that really caught my eye, would come back and would want to try some other flavors that weren't available when I was there."}, {"review_id": "J5FZNV6MOB30txfEtJgRrw", "user_id": "b8RHCCHJJyXDUitnL2Qi5A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "This was an amazing spot for ice cream! I sampled so many of the fun flavors and decided to order their namesake- Milkjam. This ice cream consists of caramelized goat, cow and condensed milks and is so delicious. I also sampled their Ridin' Duuurty (oreo milk w/ oreo chunks and salted peanut butter), Hard Knock Life 2.0 (dark chocolate w/ salted chocolate fudge, whoppers and brownies), Black (the darkest coco) and Poppin Bottles (champagne sorbet w/ sprinkles). I would say the first two would be my favorite if they didn't have the 'salted' component. The Black was a little too much for me and the Poppin Bottles was actually a little too much of the champagne taste than I would want. The workers were all so sweet and patient as I tried all of the flavors and knew so much about them. There is some seating inside that we enjoyed but I would say it's not a sit-down spot for a large group. I'm not sure if they have a parking lot, but we managed to get a free street spot right in front of the store!"}, {"review_id": "M64B-G6NU5RDSyVfp0dc7g", "user_id": "ErWPjeuK5uKHLmtz4BM9ng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "Awesome ice cream spot in Minneapolis!

They've got some seating inside (not a ton, but that's how ice cream places tend to be), and it's connected to World Street Kitchen if you're craving something savory.

They are both awesome, honestly it all comes down to what flavors are in the cases, but Izzy's is winning for me right now because they have way more flavors that captivate me. That said, Milkjam is awesome. I find their flavors to be really inventive, which matters a lot to me when I'm paying to go eat out somewhere. I want an experience, not just something I can buy or make. Price wise, this place is spendy as comparable to other places like Izzy's. Expect around $6 for a scoop or two (off of memory). Before you pick a flavor, try all the ones that appeal and pick your favorite. They will let you try anything and everything, so don't rush in blindly and pay for something eh. So far, I've tried these flavors (I know I've forgotten one): malted sweet cream w/ caramel delights & brown butter caramel | This one is really good, it's a good twist on a more classic flavor (out of their offerings). I love a good, smooth sweet cream and this one is and the caramel and such inside of it just add a nice luxurious sweetness. It was a good one. the darkest coco | While this one is one of their big \"ooooh, cool\" flavors, I'm not enthused by it. When I tried it I remembered thinking it would be good WITH something. Like with a fruit flavor or something to cut just the chocolate."}, {"review_id": "TJHoM1-c3UX38vDWOihNYA", "user_id": "nGUlidGU5eZ6jjUPS15pvA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/8/2017", "text": "The best kind of sandwiches are ice cream sandwiches.

Moving to Minneapolis was no different, and Milkjam was in fact the first one I tried in the Twin Cities. Honestly, it's solid, but not life-altering by many means.Yes, they have tons of different flavors. Since their flavors change daily, you'll have to either call ahead or visit their location frequently to get your favorites. It gourmet, weird, and different types of flavors, and they generally get it right. For the price, you get an half decent - sized scoop of ice cream, and waffle cones are additional if you are a fan of those.You can absolutely expect a line in the summer, but a late night winter adventure won't keep you waiting long. You can also buy pints that are prepacked.I will say that if you are vegan, this is an awesome place to get ice cream-as they have quite a bit of vegan options.Flavors I've tried I really like:Ridin' DuuurtyHard Knock Life"}, {"review_id": "bCwWeK0XLsY9ppjDRsBNpw", "user_id": "KJMfNFcIqllU7UOjkAyufg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/22/2017", "text": "I absolutely love this place!

I've had a lot of cereal flavored ice creams from Afters, PieHole, etc. but Milk Jam's is hands down the best! I was a confused when I saw orange coriander listed as an ingredient but it was so good! The ice cream was super creamy and had a caramel-like sweetness with a hint of orange and lots of fruity pebbles! My favorite cereal I liked that it was still crunchy and not soggy at all! The Thai tea is on point! Very sweet from condensed milk. If you don't have a sweet tooth I would not recommend either flavor for you! But I loved them both!

I had high expectations, and this review reflects that. Any old ordinary ice cream shop would get 5 stars, but this shop promised me more. Short version: I liked what I got, but I wasn't blown away. The jam bun is also impossible to eat (see photo) - and not in like a 'whoa this is fun way!' But in like an 'arg all of the ingredients are falling apart' way.Longer version: I went when there was no line (suckers!), I tasted a few. The flavors are good, but just not a creamy as I expected. This was especially true of the milkjam - made with three delicious milks! It wasn't smooth, like I expected. My boyfriend got the jam bun, and was first very excited by the warm donut... but then as he would try to bite, all of the ice cream would shoot out the other side and then drip drip city. Easy fix - he will never order it again - but it was kind of disappointing at the time.I realize this review is nit picky, but I did expect to be blown away, and put Milkjam in my personal annals of greatest ice creams - it's not making it there, unfortunately.
