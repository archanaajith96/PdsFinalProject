And when they opened believe me... I was there, with my family. My kids LOVE sushi, and ramen. So needless to say, they were super excited too.Unfortunately, we were all very dissapointed. the food was far from even being mediocre. It takes ALOT for me to rate a restaurant 1 star, this might be my second 1 star review. The sushi all tasted like it was soaked in lemon, or a car freshener. All of it... The ramen was less to be desired, the ramen burger didn't compiment itself, it was just a bad experience. The waitress was super friendly, and did a great job, the decor of the location was great, very contemporary."}, {"review_id": "phB4QUv2q4Pk7nZ8CL4RVA", "user_id": "TRh_Jot1Pt2AmHnz6Al3SA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Great atmosphere, kind staff and food service just pushed this restaurant, with phenomenal food, to five stars. Not just that it was located within steps of my Lusso Hotel, finding true Ramen and Udon in Spokane was a surprise. The food was very very good. Perfect noodles a s broth accompanied by fresh vegetables and tofu made me think I might actually be in San Francisco for a minute. The beer list is short and they were having keg troubles but, the beer available on tap was good as well. I recommended this place to a local friend who hasn't been yet. And, I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an amazing bowl of ramen."}, {"review_id": "3fM25VyAGmiqR8QNZG6w_w", "user_id": "_Rp-FLM-w573_GuAE0L_vg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "321 Wkbulmubhbbhctu AverzsgtjiuSpokane, WA  BYU's last week maybe you can change the oon"}, {"review_id": "SzFt1u6rQeWQUH1lvMD-Ow", "user_id": "PQ1BXJ-xkLpbEDdPnoJq3g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "Prior to arriving in Spokane, my boss mentioned that Nudo Ramen House was worth trying during my trip. It was also conveniently located across from my hotel. With this said, my coworker and I came here for lunch on my first day to warm up our bodies with some ramen. The restaurant was clean and hip with large comic strips acting as wall decors. I liked the concept. For food, I ordered the $9 lunch special with shoyu ramen and sweet sticky rice cake skewer. Honestly, I don't know if it's because I'm so spoiled by all the authentic ramen restaurants in LA that Nudo Ramen House just cannot compare. Ramen broth tasted like concentrated ramen base from a Japanese market. It was really salty from all the soy sauce and had no flavor depth at all. The beansprouts that were used to garnish the ramen were also uncooked so the raw flavor of the vegetable was really overpowering with every mouthful. Noodles were average and egg was just hardboiled and dumped into the soup. I was expecting the typical ramen egg with runny, golden yolk, but it wasn't. As for the skewer, it was four pieces of Korean rice cake found in dukbokki, drenched in condensed milk and seasoned with sesame seeds. The rice cakes hardened and was difficult to chew after a while. Overall, I was a little disappointed with my experience because all the reviews seemed very promising. I probably will not be coming back if I ever visit Spokane again."}, {"review_id": "CWyCfHSx0vb0NaTjEbOjUQ", "user_id": "TXGcMHvxVMwElYxh9T02Hg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Stopped in last night and had some drinks and great apps/small plates of Japanese/Pan Asian foods.  Loved that the seaweed salad was a hearty portion for $5, you usually get 1/4 the amount in other restaurants.    Of course, what draws people here is not the appetizers, it's the ramen.  And this place doesn't disappoint.  Great flavors, lots of choices, even a vegan option, which is tough to do with so many meat-based broths.  Great location and modern decor round out this solid option for eating in downtown Spokane."}, {"review_id": "6tvgxOlZrgk0WAjXhGL7PQ", "user_id": "auf78JSTlMA9eFNspnt1Xw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Although this restaurant was very chic, the food could be better! Their calamari was a little bland and could use more salt. My mom ordered the tonkatsu ramen and I ordered the spicy miso ramen (it has pork but i substituted beef instead). We both weren't big fans of the meat in both our bowls. It wasn't really the traditional Japanese meat in ramen.

I've been here twice now and have not been disappointed either time. The atmosphere is just so unique that it is an experience in its own. I've had the edamame, the calamari, the beef sliders, the coconut shrimp, and the kobe beef spicy ramen. The only think I wasn't as much of a fan of was the coconut shrimp only because it was a bit sweeter than I was hoping. The ramen I had wasn't overly spicy and but the meat is so tender and delicious! The noodles are fabulous also! I am obsessed with their beef sliders though! So so delicious. What I really love about this place though is that my fiancé and I can have a downtown Spokane date night of an appetizer, two entrees, and two drinks for 35-40 bucks after tax and tip. That, my friend, is usually hard to find at any restaurant, let alone any downtown/central location. The service we have had is just average - nothing over the top, but still good. It definitely doesn't keep me away or keep me from going back! I also personally love the modern and funky decor and atmosphere. It makes for a really cool experience. Until next time NUDO!"}, {"review_id": "4WixHKlQcTYRn_0Wh6c4ig", "user_id": "BgjOhDY0IGXOVAUepMyZoA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/25/2017", "text": "This is the best fusion Japanese inspired ramen place ever! From the artsy pop art decor that's inside to their polite staff. They have some great options of ramen for the meat eaters, spicy level as well as some bowl dishes. Their tan tan chicken is for sure a favorite! Their in house made sesame sauce is so good! Nice and spicy and coordinated together!I I've also tried their ramen burger which is delicious, little messy but so creatively delicious!Such a convenient area as well!

Nudo serves up some tasty fusion food in a hip, but not too hip, space. We got the ramen with spicy beef, and the noodles were legit and delicious. The string beans were also good, but a little syrupy. The pork rice bowl was less impressive, but the portions were huge. The space was cool, but a little drafty, and our food came out haphazardly. I think it's in the 3.5-star range, but I'll round up, and I'd definitely give it another try."}, {"review_id": "sQkNYMdxVbz3gCMN_L-NSg", "user_id": "jJRa9AmS8CNuSge8HP7KVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Good stuff.

You only need to be a little bit adventurous at Nudo, and the menu really helps people to experience a little bit of everything. I love the Pork Tonkotsu (made with some delicious broth), but I've also heard raves about their fried rice (10-12 dollars and you get enough for 3 meals - seriously!).

They have Roy Lichtenstein inspired artwork in the restaurant which is great to view. The community bench in the middle is a great way to meet new people as well. We started off with fried gyoza which was delicious. I thought it was going to be deep fried but i believe its actually pan-fried which is even better in my opinion. I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl. It came with rice, a ton of chicken teriyaki with broccoli and carrots. This meal definitely filled me up! I even used the gyoza sauce for the broccoli and it was a nice mixture - tasted great!  My husband ordered Tan Tan Men ramen bowl. It was advertised as spicy and he said it was a little spicy not too much. He absolutely loved it and would order it again.  To finish off we got the mochi ice cream since we have never had it before. We tried the green tea and chocolate flavors. We thoroughly enjoyed the ice cream and it was very refreshing. I noticed a lot of people coming in had reservations- although we did not. We got seated right away when we arrived. I dont know if they get packed on the weekends which is why people may do reservations."}, {"review_id": "8Dcsz6O-9hc9On9eBYfC7w", "user_id": "AeLoJnNm1v5MyIg99Gc2sg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Tried 5 dishes, really liked 3 of them:2 appetizers, pork and chicken fried nuggets(?)

The food was so good! Reasonably priced too! We had the chow mein, tan tan, and spring rolls. Spring rolls were cooked just right, soft and flavorful in the middle, with a nice crunch on the outside. The sauce they were pairs with was fantastic. The chow mein was amazing, the noodles carried so much flavor. It's nice that they give you the option for mild, medium, or hot spice to this dish as well. My husband had the tan tan, it was spicy! Left his nose running, but packed full of good flavor. We really enjoyed the food! We were slightly disappointed with the service though. It took over 20 minutes to get our order in, even though we were seated quickly.  It was a fairly busy Saturday night, so we take it with a grain of salt. However, the service seemed to be lacking more as the place emptied this night. We waited almost 30 minutes after we had both finished our food, drinks, etc before we got the check. No one even asked if we wanted a refill on waters or seemed to notice really. We had to ask for our check once we were finally able to get someone's attention. The decor of this place is also very original and we enjoyed that aspect of it. The parking on a Saturday night wasn't ideal, but they are located about 2 blocks from the mall parking, and that was the most convenient parking. We plan to come back, but maybe on a week night or for lunch when they're not as busy! lol"}, {"review_id": "nZKZLE9GE9mfSF2rne7f3Q", "user_id": "9wNJNYqzbEGAMl5n3MvCWA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "This place was fantastic.
