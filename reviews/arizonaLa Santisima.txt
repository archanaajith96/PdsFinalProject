With high expectations, La Santisima was the first restaurant I visited after I landed.Saw some reviews saying that the wait is usually insane, so I went for a late lunch at around 2:30pm, and it was pretty empty. There were still parties leaving and coming. The inside has beautiful art, and great Mexican restaurant vibe. My server handed me the menus and came back shortly for my drinks along with some nachos. There was a whole list of margaritas to choose from, so I asked him to bring me the best seller. Near the back of the restaurant is a sauce/dip station where you can go customize your own personal dip for nachos according to your preference, or you can get each sauce individually. There were at least 14 different ones to choose from, and I never tried most of them!Server came back with my margarita, and helped me finalize my main, something that he said he loves as well. That's great, now my expectation is even higher. The margarita is B O M B. The first sip made me go whoa and my super cool server chuckled. He came over and told me he has made at least 5 of them today! Food came faster than I expected, in under 10 minutes. It looked massive, could probably feed 2. At that point I was close to drooling and the excitement on my face probably gave it away - my server asked if I wanted a picture with the food!! LOL how awesome is that. Took pictures with the food and I dived in. First bite and I was in heaven.....This is what I call perfect Mexican food. The green sauce was perfection, I could literally eat anything with it. Rice and meat were cooked just right, and I ate about a quarter of the food in less than 2 minutes. My server checked up on me while I was in the middle of stuffing my face, and he mentioned that I came on a good day. Usually theres a line up throughout the day.I was only able to finish half of my food, really want to go back and try the Quesa that my server was raving about!"}, {"review_id": "h_6-eUycbY37_5O-u7NopQ", "user_id": "qWxxJ1YnAX33FhsSIDSJ-Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "This place is just like a trip to Mexico City.

It smells. We had the hostess tell us multiple times are server was coming then she would end up helping us. The waters are not natural. The meat was probably microwaved or re-heated.

The service was abysmal, the place is so dark you can't see, it smells bad, and the lighting consists of some spotlights tacked onto the ceiling that shine right into your eyes if you are unlucky enough to sit at a bad table. I ordered my usual tacos and the cheese shells were burned, the tortilla chips were oily, and the meat quality was tough and chewy. The prices have also skyrocketed! My love affair with this place is officially over. Sorry."}, {"review_id": "WOKyOC1_N6QzCH3TMoPN3Q", "user_id": "YvV9mn0BjbNgZ3qOn0Yv-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "The taco selection is amazing! Sure, I'll wait in a long line on taco Tuesday just to get my hands on the mix & match deal served with rice and beans. You can also swap out one of the two and get two rice or two beans. They also have a salsa bar and additional items you can top on your tacos, etc. NOM! If you're coming on a weekday (during noon time), I'd suggest you to grab a menu a overlook it while you're in line because the menu is huge and it gives you second thoughts on what you're ordering. There's also a water dispenser with cups near the register when you're waiting in line. Five stars because...- Tasty tacos.- HUGE menu.- Vegan/Gluten free options (the section is pretty big).- Friendly and excellent customer service.- Salsa bar was clean and filled."}, {"review_id": "d5S0OukyLqnX0mPgvmg12A", "user_id": "btAlBOOI7g75OL3prjWxuQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Outstanding food.  Very creative and unique ingredients.  Worth the hype.  Would prefer if they had table service during lunch."}, {"review_id": "D_oGnd_k7u4Atsf4n8Ys8Q", "user_id": "dkRcmyuiaLy4QhDRKpzi4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "Amazing experience!

You used to be one of my favorite Mexican restaurants but the last few times weren't great and my recent visit made me not want to ever come back. I came to dine and service was awful and took forever to get us water. No kidding - it took about 15-20 minutes. I finally placed my order of the shrimp taco, chicken tinga taco and the steak taco. Our food didn't arrive until another half an hour. The restaurant wasn't even busy!! Our food arrives but we weren't given silverware so we sat there looking at our food for another 5-10 min. The shrimp taco was ok, the steak taco dry and I had enough that I didn't want the other taco. I'm so disappointed. Oh well, bye La Santisima."}, {"review_id": "RJNS_TTeMAD2H7kQ7q-Txg", "user_id": "YMS-7j6gtsUCxwli4dAhmg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "Decided to stop by as we made our way though Phoenix along our road trip. Was very excited and had my hopes up for a delicious Mexican meal. Decided on their taco combination plate which is a order of 3 tacos along with beans and rice. Salsa bar was pretty good as we're their chips. Unfortunately their rice was awful, was overcooked and microwaved to a large glob of paste. Honestly it was unappetizing to have it on my plate as it made me think that the rest of the meal was also microwaved. Made a comment to the waiter as I felt it could be a point of improvement. He received the criticism well. Don't think this restaurant is deserving of a four star based on my experience."}, {"review_id": "U48vTZmgL-k1hJvJqzOiwA", "user_id": "VIhK3s1EC4gJUUD_JiGoVQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "We order the steak taco, chicken chipotle and two shark tacos.

First off, it happened to be Taco Tuesday when I went so that meant $2 for all street tacos. Secondly, they have an unlimited salsa bar with ALL kinds of salsa (everything from traditional salsas like pico de gallo to interesting dips like peanut butter salsa). Thirdly, to top it off, margaritas are $4 all-day everyday...whaaaat?? These deals are almost too good to be true.My boyfriend and I decided to order and share all five street tacos plus the \"gourmet\" baby shark taco. Each taco packed bold flavors in it - the al pastor was possibly the best spicy pork taco I've had (loved the pineapple bits in the avocado salsa!), the brisket in the chilango suadero was incredibly juicy, and the chicken tinga with pickled onions made a perfect combo. The star of the show though were the shark tacos. The fried fish had a light crispy beer batter, and each bite had delicious, tender, flaky baby shark in it. So good.The only taco I probably wouldn't order again was the chicken asado. Not that it tasted bad by any means, but after eating all the other tacos, the flavors in this one were rather underwhelming.Good service and great food. Absolutely will be back next time I'm visiting Phoenix."}, {"review_id": "Y4rIBIXkkfnbjwr_PMMTFA", "user_id": "JCtxxQLvWVjYEG2nD726kw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "Best gourmet tacos in Phoenix.  Don't worry, even though the tacos are nice you don't need a tie to dig in!"}, {"review_id": "8vHfhBQ7TskdpyNSX5aNVA", "user_id": "D-kHnEoD81SA42_gqh45yQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "The Salsa Bar! Holy moly! I wish I took a picture, it was huge. I was enamored by the strawberry salsa (tried to replicate at home to no avail). The food was served on clay plates, nice touch, and it was pretty tasty. I recommend this place every time someone asks me of a Mexican restaurant that will blow their expectations away. I do warn, there can be extremely long waits, like at least an hour wait if you're lucky....hence my 4 star review. Now I do know that they were working on opening more dining space, but at the time they also lacked staff. I will try out soon to update this review, but overall it is a great experience."}, {"review_id": "t3dQEFBDDT1xzNCme2zoqw", "user_id": "UpfWpus2nyplsrSha8VCxw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Food was excellent, salsa bar was amazing.  The neighborhood is a little sketchy,  I was approached for money by a small family.  Still worth the trip.

Next time I'm back I'll have to try them- but my burrito was so good I will probably just get it again.Salsas GALORE at the salsa bar.

In fact, I noticed the signed Diners, Drive-Ins, and Drives memorabilia hanging near the front entrance of the restaurant. There is actually another La Santisima location at Glendale, AZ and one of my friends mistakenly drove to the Glendale location due to miscommunication. Our waiter was someone who just started the job a day ago and he said a lot of people ordered guacamole - I took his advice and it was definitely a great recommendation.Menu: I have tried plenty of street tacos in Los Angeles, but oh boy the La Santisima's menu completely overwhelmed me. There are just so many regional tacos (Yucatán, Oaxaca, Ensenada, Mexico City, Sonora, Baja Sur, Guadalajara City, etc) to choose from! In addition to tacos, the menu also includes lonches (pretty much like torta), burritos, quesadillas, and botanas / sopas / caldos / ensalada.Salsa Bar: 14 different options such as pecan salsa, peanut salsa, cilantro salsa, Cabo salsa, Mexicans salsa, pico de gallo, etc. Each table gets a basket of complimentary chips and extra chip will cost $2.70. HOWEVER, you will also get another basket of complimentary chips if you do order a side of guacamole.***[Mix & Match Plates (3 tacos with rice & beans) for $13.98 (extra charge if you choose any tacos from the La Santisima Gran Reserva Tacos) - all tacos had two layers of corn tortilla][Taco 1] La Santisima Specialty (toasted Oaxaca cheese, mushrooms, poblano pepper, onion, spinach, fresh garlic grilled with olive oil, special salsa cilantro served with your selection of meat - steak; extra $0.99 for plate): Excellent and flavorful steak with crazy toppings - this was the best one out of the three I tried. (4.75/5)[Taco 2] Mayan Cochinita Pibil (12-hour slow cooked roasted pork shoulder until fork tender marinated with Achiote Mayan rojo, Mexican herbs, wrapped in a banana leave topped with pickle onions; extra $0.51 for plate): It was one of the Yelp recommendations, but I thought this pork shoulder taco tasted just okay. This was my least favorite taco out of the three. (3.5/5)[Taco 3] Baja Sur Baby Shark (Corn tortilla filled with beer battered wild baby shark cazon, cabbage, salsa cilantro & mayo; extra $0.51 for plate): Well seasoned and tender fish taco. I liked La Santisima Specialty just a little bit more, but I will not shy away from ordering this taco. (4.5/5)[Rice & Beans]: Rice tasted slightly sweet and bean had a slight spicy kick. Both were very good. (5/5)Guacamole (aguacate, cilantro, chile serrano, onion, tomato, mango, jicama, cranberries; half for $6.99): It also came with a basket of complimentary chips. One of the slightly sweeter guacamole that I have tried and I really like it. (5/5)Horchata (Family recipe fruits and pecans; $4.50): Talk about a huge bottle! A very unique horchata with strawberry and a hint of cinnamon. It was a very solid horchata and just slightly sweet for my taste. (4.25/5)***Recommendations: Don't eat too much chips and get hook on salsa bar or guacamole because you will not have enough room to finish your tacos. Tacos aren't exactly cheap here, but this is really the taco shop for foodies in general."}, {"review_id": "MDTbNIrQGlMhMsgzqSMWzg", "user_id": "G1h1gHD9q31P4b-sIBoz6w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/11/2017", "text": "I was very glad to stop here.

Then the tacos arrived, and they were pretty good, accompanied with rice and beans. This is not a typical Mexican restaurant, it is what they call Tex-Mex cuisine, but good nonetheless.We also had margaritas, agua de jamaica and calabazitas (eggplant)."}, {"review_id": "feYub-cZHltJKcJhneVWkQ", "user_id": "LHGEfycYu0VqsNE8vxzbXA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "This place is straight up 5 Star, great food, great staff and great experience.
