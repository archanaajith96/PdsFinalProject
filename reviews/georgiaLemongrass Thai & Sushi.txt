I ordered the SS10 which is this (taken directly from their website) : SS10. *Sushi and Sashimi Combo  - (14) sushi, (14) sashimi, tuna roll, california roll (42 pieces total). Sushi Entrees always come with a soup or salad. I paid $53 for this. I did NOT receive soup or salad and this comes with the order. Not to mention the servings used to be a lot bigger. They used to come in a giant square take out box, now they come in a small circle box. This is discouraging as I only get these for special occasions and for special people. I don't think I will be ordering from here gain until they get their act together.  My order taker was Anna."}, {"review_id": "6AWQfd9qBcWXR0DVZxvH4g", "user_id": "erOPVFHMF7dzJg_zHrXp8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "BEST Thai food I've ever had!

The owner greeted us and accommodated our ten people party. Our waitress was very nice and helped us out with the menu. The menu was VERY diverse(which I love) and had an extensive variety of vegetarian, vegan, and meat based meals. I ordered the Mussamon Curry with a 3 out of 5 heat level, my wife ordered the Red Curry with tofu, and my brother(in the military, and gave us a military discount) ordered the Pineapple Fried Rice which was served in half a pineapple!! Very cool. Everything was delicious and when I'm back in Georgia in a couple weeks I plan on going back!"}, {"review_id": "jz8dztI4KgFafBmimRZSxw", "user_id": "21uFzw0u_Ry-OYG6LIpnDw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Everything from our waitress Boo, to the appetizer, to the entree and the dessert we're phenomenal...!!!

Actually, we stopped by while we were still in a hotel, before we had even gotten the keys to our apartment!I'm not mad at Lemongrass. However, I've eaten here a couple of times now, and I will say that I'm still more of a fan of the Thai and sushi places I frequented back in El Paso. Their food is fresh 8/10 times, and their service is good most of the time. I will say, one thing that irked me is when I inquire as to a local beer I saw on their menu, and ask what it is like, I'm not hoping to be told what color the can is! Their rolls are large, and the noodle dishes (pad thai, etc.) are fairly decent portions. Beware of their delivery charge, though-- the first time we ordered delivery we were quoted a $7 fee, the next time, it was $11. If it's worth it just depends on how hungry you are, I suppose. Overall, Lemongrass is ok. Not my favorite in town, but not bad either."}, {"review_id": "3ltd06rl4NWCqwDjp8_csg", "user_id": "J23x-Y2E6URxCfbNKCxh8A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "We decided to try this place on a Saturday evening. They were pretty busy but the service was still good. Our server was very attentive and sweet. She kept our drinks refilled and removed the dirty plates quickly. The appetizers we had (seaweed salad & fried dumplings) were ok. They didn't disappoint but they didn't impress either. My husbands Panang Beef Curry was excellent but they do skimp on the beef; it was mostly vegetables. But the flavor was great. My sashimi & sushi roll (red snapper, octopus and conch sashimi and Alisa roll) were not good at all. It didn't seem fresh and the roll had no flavor. The roll alone was $16 so I'd hoped to enjoy it; which I did not. We had the Xango dessert but we requested coconut ice cream instead of the vanilla ice cream that it comes with. We were charged an additional $3.00 for the upgrade, this which is fine I guess because the coconut ice cream was excellent. The rest of the desert was just ok.So even though the sushi was a huge disappointment; we will return to try their other Thai dishes. Maybe their sushi is just not their thing."}, {"review_id": "-wT6eRCo4oE7f0cUwhxBdQ", "user_id": "QI9lHh0bO6ZuO-g7jUMueQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Visiting from PA and didn't know what to expect.  We were pleasantly surprised with the excellent quality of the food and wait staff.  We had the love boat for 2.

Place is large, clean, and staffed appropriately. The food was definitely good. I had the ginger tofu,Thai hot and it was pretty darn good.

The food and customer service was absolutely amazing! I was greeted and seated by the gentleman host before then being greeted by my waiter Nerissa who did a fabulous job of making sure I had a delightful dinner with very prompt service. I started with the Miso Soup, which is actually larger in volume then I've been served at other establishments, it was very flavorful and they weren't skimpy at all with the tofu chucks which I love. Up next was the Broadway Sushi roll which consisted of a deep fried smoked salmon, crab avocado, cream cheese, cucumber and eel sauce. It was simply delicious. Right as I was gearing towards the end of my roll, my main entree arrived. The Roasted Duck Curry with a side of steamed white rice. This dish was remarkably! I ordered the half because I didn't want to over do it seeing that I had ordered the sushi roll and man was the portion still huge! They definitely make sure you receive your money's worth! The Duck Curry had pineapple chucks (my favorite), string peas, green peppers, carrots and plenty of the curry broth that elevated the flavor. And the Duck was cooked to perfection. With it being a Thai restaurant and a popular Thai dish... you have the option to make the spice level between a 1 and 5. I played it safe with a level 1 knowing how hot things can get with Thai food, and it came out perfect! The spice wasn't overbearing the flavor of the curry and the dish was breathtaking. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience At Lemongrass and I definitely plan to visit again before leaving the area."}, {"review_id": "XMfynUoejgz_x3f--rPFww", "user_id": "XjwoDMMSxwfG5m9PbOCG9g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/13/2017", "text": "Service was great, food came out fast, drinks were always filled, plates were cleared in a very timely manner, and the food was good too.
