Sorry for no pics, it was pretty dark in there. We tried a bevy of the phenomenal craft cocktails to start. I had the margarita which was so good. I'm very particular when it comes to margy's and this one passed the test. It was the right balance all around and just the perfect amount of sweetness (too sweet is the worst!). Since I was driving, I cut myself off after one drink but took a couple little sips of everyone's drinks to taste them. The drink menu was so extensive that I cant remember exactly what everyone had, but everything was excellent. For food, I had the mussels, the root vegetable salad, lamb ribs and a trout special. . My wife and I split each dish as usual and were very impressed with each one. The mussels were meaty and cooked perfectly. I was drinking the broth with a spoon after we quickly finished off the mussels. The salad was nice, light and refreshing. Not overly large. A couple mussels...couple bites of salad. Beautiful. The lamb ribs were awesome. The sauce was sweet, hot and tangy. I was trying to douce the rib in as much sauce as I could. Had a nice asian flair. The trout was great too. Moist and cooked really well. Thoroughly enjoyed everything. As for our friends, one had the burger which looked excellent to the eye. She ordered it well done unfortunately though since thats what Canadians do, ugh. She was full from the two (not one, but two) orders of bruschetta she had as an app, so i took the liberty of crushing all of her fries. So good as was the bruschetta which i had a bite of. Another one of our friends got the gnocchi. They were light n fluffy with an excellent sauce. The food menu is not overwhelming (and I believe changes consistently) which makes it easy to order. We were very impressed with everything. Really cool spot in Detroit. Definitely go check it out, if you can find it..."}, {"review_id": "EkMsAWicDOdTHOx9dQkeJw", "user_id": "nflXJBtMJIw2jxj50Ob2bA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "A street alley access only cocktail lounge in the coolest (and let's be honest, only) alley to hang out in Detroit. It's called the Belt, just north of Greektown and on the east side of Woodward. Tons of hipstery artwork lining the alley walls with a proportional number of hipsters posing in front of them, take that however you'd like.The lounge itself is very comfortable, bar and table seating. Food and drink prices, somewhat high but you are rewarded in quality. Think $11-15 drinks. Their drink menu is extensive and spirit based, my favorite was their whiskey selection. They also do some neat ongoing event where you can buy older and partial bottles of different liquors you wouldn't normally try and purchase at cost. Just tells me they're invest in Detroit community, which is always a plus. Enjoy your cocktails!Also, the dude next to me claimed the steak was the best he's had in Detroit, and he looked like quite a steak eater."}, {"review_id": "b8VQwjPsuMX8xDkea14ZXg", "user_id": "ek-gBZqpT6Q5-rLmZOpJyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "We only came here for drinks but I wished we had ordered food here because everything looked so good!This place was a hidden gem and pretty exclusive. It was a little hard to find this place. We got in and it was PACKED at like 10pm. Our server talked me into getting a gin drink (which I never ever drink gin) I think it was called snake in the grass? It had lime, celery bitters, and muddled mustard greens. I actually loved it! All the flavors mixed and complimented each other. I also had the midleton cup which has Irish whiskey, mandarin all spice, lemon, ginger, and cucumber. This was my favorite but then again I'm a whiskey girl!"}, {"review_id": "wW28lTbg6uwiOl7W3vut2w", "user_id": "wjko_JEkgwydWiT-aIjKIg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Trendy, hippy ambiance.

It's hidden in this alley, called, the belt which is a popular graffiti alley way with some bars. Standby is a well hidden area with a lantern at the front which is the main signal that it's there. It's quiet from the outside but when you go through those curtains and into the bar, it's loud with a nice dark/dim ambiance. My cocktail for the night was their Benton's Old Fashioned. It's smoky, savory, salty but has all the proper components of an original Old Fashioned. It contains bacon infused bourbon and grade B maple to give it some sweetness. For $12 this was well worth it.

In the Motor City today with my daughter visiting the 2018 North American Auto Show! And of course the follow up is great food and drink. Tonight, The Standby was our choice. Located in The Alley in Downtown Detroit, an artsy urban renovation district. I ordered the chicken wings and my daughter ordered the burger and fries! I must say in the world of Wingdom, the size, the flavor and overall taste of the wings was existential! 11 out of 10. Are you kidding me? Wow! You have got to try these wings!My daughter reviewed the burger as being very tasty, very juicy, medium well with a side of non- greasy fries. Great experience at this restaurant with a very cool vibe!

Place is ever urban chic, can be super load but feels swanky and has that 'speakeasy' vibe inside. Very much takes me back to similar places in Chicago, albeit those are 20 times the size as little old Standby, and doesn't feel like Detroit at all.   Food can be exceptionally pricey for 'decent' flavor and small portions; the wings were something special however. Whatever the 'brine' like sauce on the side offered a balancing tang to the spiced up dry rub on the wing. Had a lovely caramelized skin while being big and meaty.I would pregame here before dinner elsewhere or flip that for post meal drink/social time."}, {"review_id": "9pYWrqEH40rMWLHggibiPQ", "user_id": "2vFrtkBF6uy10ksMQT-o5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "In a dark alley between two parking garages, you almost miss the entrance to Standby. It's just two heavy curtains that lead you from the cold of winter in Detroit to a cozy and raucous spot to grab a drink and a bite to eat. I visited recently on a trip to Detroit, and of the many hidden bars in the city, I really liked this one. Apparently everybody else did too, because Standby meant standing room only that evening! Despite the crowd, I loved the festive vibe of it all. My friend and I ordered drinks at the bar, and several waitstaff were circulating with glasses of water -- a must in the dry winter when consuming a drink. We could have ordered food as well, but both the lack of seating that evening and a looming dinner kept us from grabbing some nibbles. The ceilings are low in a cozy way, the waitstaff is eclectic but friendly, and with its location tucked under the garage, it feels like a secret place to grab a drink. Well, the secret's out now, and I hope that you'll enjoy your trip to Standby as much as I did!"}, {"review_id": "rEh8C84sMisCijKqbxN7Qw", "user_id": "5YlTaJXfbPVM3zRwQsvl1A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "Not really a large menu but has a nice depth to it. I stayed safe and went with the fish and chips and the Gnocchi. Fish was classic cod and had a nice flaky crust with house cut fries. Gnocchi was soft had nice flavor. Portions were a little small for the price but I would much rather have a smaller portion of quality food over a trough of a casino buffet. Restaurant has a nice ambiance and vibe. More of an industrial look and a extensive drinks menu.

The pineapple (aka \"The Fibonacci\")  is amazing, a perfect amount of spice in the punch. The glassware and displays are perfect.

We cameHere to eat so when we sat down and looked at the menu we were sort of disappointed they barely had any menu items this is definitely more of a bar than a restaurant, but this is what we end up with when we let marty pick the place . The drink menu looked amazing but that's not what I wanted so I ordered the fish and chips($22) and everyone else ordered the burger and fries($14). Food came after a little wait and I was so hungry so I dove right in to find that the breading on the fish literally slid off of the filet as soon as my fork touched it, the cod itself was cooked fine but the breading was mushy soggy and wet=inedible, everyone else was very happy with their burgers but I guess I ordered the wrong thing from there.

It's an attractively furnished space, neither delving too far into the raw industrial chic that makes the Detroit restaurant world go round, nor too far into the realm of reclaimed wood, nor too clean-- sort of a Goldilocks of balanced design and lighting. It feels like a sort of intermediary spot, neither neighborhoody nor aggressively trendy. Appears to be heavily populated by the Quicken scene.Got some wings and some fries. The wings were good, but wings are wings are wings (as a wing fiend slash connoisseur, of course), and the variances in quality across restaurants is marginal compared to the substantial variances in per-wing price. I appreciated the dipping sauce, but at a culinary level, it seems odd to have a super thin, vinegary sauce for something that is not absorptive (like a spring roll or egg roll). The fries were great. You can get a very limited selection of beers served in very small glasses for $6, and cocktails are expensive. Enjoyed the experience in some way, but not really itching to go back."}, {"review_id": "MhLBBzhvlU1DMbpQzzxKFw", "user_id": "AyCmU_AJSBVRjQs9qnucig", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Drinks were superb!
