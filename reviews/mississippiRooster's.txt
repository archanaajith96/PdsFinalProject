I walked over to Basils to get a pasta salad with chicken, but they were closed, so I went around the corner to Roosters and ended up getting their house salad with a substitute of the hot chicken, as I was now craving salad with chicken.  Having raised several kids, one of my least favorite foods is fried chicken - spent way too much time at Chick-fil-A for 15 years. But, oh my, this chicken was awesome. Flash forward to today and I was back in the neighborhood needing lunch. I called Roosters to place an order for the salad and was put on hold ... five minutes later still on hold and by then I was there so I walked in. I waited behind another party. When it was my turn the guy said \"hold on a minute I need to answer this call\" picked up the phone to take the call. Kind of bummed at this point as my call was never answered and then I had to wait while someone else's call was. Hence the star deduction.Anyway, I sucked it up and ended up ordering the hot chicken sliders because I decided I'd probably get less fat and calories in those than a salad with comeback.  15 minutes later the food came out -  I ate about half a slider and then the rest of the chicken off of both of them. And oh, the chicken, was just as good as the first time. I don't know what they do to make the crispy, crunchy crust but it's exceptional. Despite that iffy service and long wait, I'm sure I will find my way back here. I've never been impressed with Nashville hot chicken including that in Nashville but  Roosters has this one on point, so if you like the stuff give it a try"}, {"review_id": "ltPa21tTIF8HI3v0_gyqRg", "user_id": "csF_fJb-0_piKSBLMb-Ijg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Finally! I've been trying to find some real southern food in Jackson for a while. I live near NOLA and travel to Jackson for work frequently. Since it's not that big of a distance I thought the food would still be up to par. Alas, I've been disappointed because it just wasn't what I really craved, yano? Until now! Red beans: bomb. Mashed potatoes: bomb. And also, REAL potatoes. Salad: nothing special, but it's a salad. I wanted to try so many other things, but I anticipate coming back so I'll get to them eventually. Also, they're hella cheap. Will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "XdIDCZnonMGYWBdgF4aAaA", "user_id": "u64p3GEoMDps1KRPUG4wTQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/7/2017", "text": "Met a friend in town to try this place out for lunch and I wasn't disappointed.

I missed the lunch rush I'm sure as there were only 2 tables finishing up their meals when I walked in.After weighing out my options, I went with the fried chicken sandwich and a side of curly fries with a fountain drink. It was right around $10 total.I left STUFFED - couldn't finish the huge order of fries. The chicken sandwich was great - and massive. It was a nice size piece of chicken breast, fried to perfection. The bun was the jalapeno bun, but it doesn't really have a kick to it at all. It's a cool vibe in there, super casual, and the menu has what you'd expect - some good comfort food. I'll stop in again next time for a burger!SUPER nice cashier. I probably mention this in every single Jackson review, but man, folks are so nice!

The three star rating comes just because there are some really good burgers in Jackson so if you want a 4 or 5 star one, there are a lot of good options (Cool Al's and Lou's are tops!).Good selection of burgers at a good price. A few salads, basic entrees and a chicken sandwich round it out. They are very reasonably priced and can cook to order and basically do whenever you need. The ingredients are high quality and the bun selection is even pretty good.Service is fine, but I often find it VERY slow, even when they aren't that busy (granted, Cool Al's, the best burger in town, is legendarily slow). It is located in the Fondren Corner building, which is great, but gets busy at lunch and has poor bathrooms.It is a solid burger, but it isn't going to delight and amaze you. Worth checking out.Do pick up some banana pudding - that is crucial."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/roosters-jackson?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
