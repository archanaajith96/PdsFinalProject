Just over the bridge so checked out what was downtown. There were a few different options that looked appealing but figured since I was in the Willamette Valley, I should find a craft beer gastropub :) There were a few online but Falling sky had a substantial more reviews and still maintained a 4 star rating. Thought that gave it enough cache to check out. The one think you need to realize is that Apple directions are kinda off. The pub is in the alley and they actually have free parking there which is sweet. Walking in, the chalk board had a nice wide range of beers to choose from. as I'm \"hopped out of beer; sacrilege I know haha :), decided to start with a \"Ready to Mingle, Belgium Single\".  It was quite delicious and reasonably priced (and low alcohol content so a few could possibly be imbibed). The Belgian was quite crisp and refreshing. For my meal, I went with the Back Alley Burger which consists of grass fed beef, pub sauce, pickled onions, and greens on a normal bun. I splurged adding smoked cheddar ($1.25 additional) since the company was buying! The burger is supposed to come out medium rare but I'd give it medium but was very happy with that result as it was still ridiculous juicy and the pickled onions accentuated the taste to make it a very good burger. Borderline top 10 burger I've had but that's a tough nut to crack as my fat butt has had burgers all over the world :) still would highly recommend with the fries as a side. Fries were a bit on the crispy side for what I like but just enough salt to make them a good compliment to the burger. It wasn't too crowded but still took a bit long to get the burger but with a sweet, albeit smaller, outside patio, it was a great place to enjoy the adult beverages and wait for the burger.After the plate was cleared, decided I would have a nightcap pint of \"Fallen sky, juniper rye\" mainly due to the name. Had hints of sweetness but there was a bit of aftertaste that I wasn't a fan of (I also prefer wine to be completely honest so my beer reviews should be held with a grain of salt).Great introduction to Eugene and looking forward to what I can find tomorrow."}, {"review_id": "azfctPK5c3i0aY7lDvh19g", "user_id": "4CkIGvzYPUGacw1gn9BBDg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "Really hipster brewery closeish to the University of Oregon. They had really good beer options that they brew themselves - my friend and I tried a bunch and enjoyed all of them. Also had one of their burgers. The meat was nice and juicy and I liked the brioche bun it was served with. The fries could've been crispier as some of the bigger pieces were a little soggy.

Not bad, but not what our diner wanted.The field burger and the pork sandwich were good, the hand cut fries were excellent - twice cooked which is a must for them to be cooked through and crunchy.Vegetarian daughter is a connoisseur of meatless patties, and she didn't rave about this one.Sticky wings are beautiful. Big meaty drumsticks that are frenched and covered in thick sticky sauce. Yum.The pretzel sticks were disappointing, not dark and chewy with salt, more like breadsticks dusted with parmesan (?). The beer cheese was bland, but the mustard was very good."}, {"review_id": "lun2jLawytjk2mDvmI5sMg", "user_id": "rlCxUGF2CYsvDC1QOvKi6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Funnily enough, I cannot vouch for their beers because I haven't tried it both times I was here during my week visit, but my boyfriend raved about their burgers (which I did have a bite of and I agree with him).  I can't say that I recommend their sarsaparilla soda (I believe).  It tasted weird like a a tea made of misc. dried herbs.  It was not palatable to me and I couldn't finish it.  We plan to visit again when we are back in the area!"}, {"review_id": "B1oG6DdfY40tZgY6X8Ggzw", "user_id": "lKVrn4Jdh2Joc7WzpPBhdA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "We got in here right before it was super busy i.e. no line.  We ordered at the counter, grabbed our number and sat down.  I ordered the shrimp and grits with sausage and stewed tomatoes.It took about 20 minutes as there was a previous rush that they were catching up on.  Only problem? When I got my shrimp/grits the shrimp was not there.  So, I got to wait another 10 minutes for them to fix that. In the meantime, most unfortunately for us, we had a show to get to. Once I got my food the 2nd time I basically had to scarf it down so not so enjoyable. On top of that, the shrimp were not that great, medium sized, and not broiled, basically boiled and buried under the tomatoes.  I don't recommend unless you like boiled shrimp with your grits.Hubby had a pulled pork sandwich but it was not quite warm, almost like it was microwaved so it was warm in some spots and not in others?  The IPA was great and so was my Cooper Mountain pinot noir. Kind of a disappointing visit."}, {"review_id": "LGb5yqqK3hg8iIyBjXAnow", "user_id": "Se23p2kgy48dz2Vkah_KIw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I really like the beer options here. The beer tenders are always really nice and accommodating when I want to taste something new that they have on tap. They also have cocktails here but mentioned that a lot of people don't even realize it! I've had their fries here before and while I list the rustic side to them I wish they were a little crispier. Other than that this is a fun place to hang out. It's nice and open so on a cold night it doesn't feel too crowded when everyone is inside. Their whole menu sounds really good and I know my friends liked the sliders. They do sit in an alley so it can be a little tricky if you don't know where you are going but it's not that hard to find. They have kombucha here as well if you don't drink beer and still want to come hang out here with friends.

Falling Sky is one of those places I want to love, but am a little disappointed by every time I eat there. Their beer is the real focal point (go figure, it's in the name after all) but it's set up as a restaurant not a bar. It's one of those places where they have great intentions with high quality, local ingredients but clearly no one here did cooking school and most dishes are kind of bland. Their burgers and pulled pork sandwiches are good, but bland. Their weekend brunch eggs Benedict sauce is ok but - you guessed it - bland. All in all Falling Sky is a great place to hang with friends over good beer, the food being an extra, not the focus."}, {"review_id": "7fHlBO6l9U2bF-Afjh_2pw", "user_id": "TZMlNVbBka39K4kLV68pNw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I got a flight of four and a bratwurst burger.

Some bars thrive on subpar pub / bar fare with good beer, but these guys are offering quality food in a place that is built to handle all kinds of parties / crowds.The communal style tables are a nice touch, though it can be challenging to locate a seat during their busiest times (which not so coincidentally happen to be on the weekends). The facility is beyond spacious with high ceilings and a real industrial feel. There is a long counter in the front with the menu and a rotating list of seasonal beer selections. For any beer novice, their $8 flight of various beers should help one figure out if they enjoy a seasonal ale or a highly tart IPA. Other standouts include the Big Leg Ella, Morning After Pilsner, Tardy Laser, and Oregon Lager. They also offer Oregon wines, cocktails and a killer lemonade as well, though beer is what they do best.Washing it all down with some quality grub never hurts. They have a pretty outstanding selection of vegetarian items as well as really solid soup and salads. One of their big draws is their burgers, which are juicy, succulent and come in a variety of toppings. I am a huge fan of the Ultimate Club, a meat heavy burger at nearly $15 pop, is their most expensive burger item on the menu. I'm also a fan of the Back Alley Burger ($13.50) and the Lamb Burger ($14) is no joke.What impressed me the most was not their fun selection of local beers or their awesome service, but their version of cheese fries. Their Poutine ($8) reminds me of any quality rendition up north, with chunks of cheese curds accompanied by a thick veggie friendly brown gravy. Finally, their Pastrami Cheese Fries ($10) is truly next level. The smokiness is evident in the pastrami, and the beer cheese curds really give it an added notch of pungency. I eat it with delight and would happily devour an entire plate for myself.I know there are probably a bunch of gastropub / pub-n-grub type places all over the city, but one that I'm ready to endorse is Falling Sky. Be careful with the narrow parking lot and definitely come hungry with good company. 4.5 stars."}, {"review_id": "22JWHp6__ybOqdxelZz9vw", "user_id": "OUOVSwsufhfF0xaLQLyBhg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Good beer, decent food, great location, you can usually find seating.
