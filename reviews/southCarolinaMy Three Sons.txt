Every single plate was AMAZING!This is not a fancy place, and located at the rail road tracks, but if you want a real soul food experience this is the place to be.  We tried Nigels last night  and food was good but it doesn't compare to My Three Sons. Thank you for the great food and service. We will be back next time we're in town."}, {"review_id": "HGa4hsXyXfEMB7coklIgKQ", "user_id": "ScOE-e-IH9xg9TaUfNAyFw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/13/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "UPDATED! My Daughter and I went here for lunch today.  We opted to dine in  and ordered A traditional soul food dinner consisting of fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, collard greens, cabbage and we added the SEAFOOD Rice. Most of the soul food restaurants I have visited  are no frills places that serve mostly in a cafeteria style which is awesome because you get to see and pick & choose whatever you'd like. My Three sons was busy  at lunch time when we went but the line moved pretty quickly. From the time we ordered until the time we ate it took all of 10 minutes. It was a pleasant experience which we will definitely repeat. The chicken and Fish were fried to perfection, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The macaroni was creamy, cheesey and baked like grandma's. The greens were well seasoned, and topped off with some turkey meat for extra flavor- not over cooked and just right. Definitely our go to place for a home cooked meal without the fuss of a big chain restaurant. My First encounter with this restaurant, I had Lunch catered for my favorite Charleston County School District Child Development Teachers at Mary Ford Elementary from My Three Sons upon recommendation from a colleague. I got a menu from Online, this family owned restaurant  prides itself with Southern Homemade specialties. It offers everything from Appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches, meats, seafood, and desserts. I really didn't know what to expect but from the teachers praises it had to be good. I ordered 5 different flavors of the Dale's Wings and Things Drumettes. I ordered the Lemon Pepper, Honey Mustard, BBQ, Teriyaki and Sugar Bourbon. Each of the flavors were taste bud favorites which we all could not get enough of. The wings were cooked to perfection and the sauce covered them without overpowering the flavor of the cooked chicken. DELICIOUS! I also ordered a few platters of the Seafood Rice which was made with Shrimp, Scallops and crab meat. The rice was as authentic to Gullah Seafood Rice as you could ever get. It was colorful, grainy ( not mushy or sticky), and packed with veggies (onions,green bell peppers, red bell peppers, tomatoes) and seafood.   The rice was extremely tasty, super nutritious, and not to mention especially pleasing to the eye. It's a must have each time I order from here. I also ordered the mixed salad platters made with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and sliced carrots. Nothing was wilted, everything was colorful & beautiful, crunchy, and flavorful as if just picked from a garden. I had a wonderful experience from Ordering the food on the phone to the delivery and set up a few days later. The price was extremely reasonable for the quality of food received. It was all Simple & delicious southern food that tugged at my heart and brought back memories of home cooked meals. I strongly recommend this restaurant and I definable will go back for the rutabagas and spareribs.

When I get the chance, I like to visit places that aren't trending. You know, the mom and pop places that serve their local neighborhoods. The location is a two store stripe mall, one side MTS and the other a convenience store. The building sits just beside active railroad tracks. The surrounding area looked a bit run down but sometimes that's exactly were you find the real food. When you enter there is a buffet set up you can order from. I asked if I could order off menu and was seated after they asked if it was for there or to go. I had the combo. Shrimp and crab cake with a side of fried okra and salad.  I was served two pieces of cornbread that was delightfully moist. Shrimp - nicely seasoned and tender. Six of them but they were large. I tend to lean towards lighter breading but theirs was nice and crunchy. Okra - tasted nice but was lukewarm. Crab cake - it was well seasoned and I liked the flavor but it was a bit dense. I could only eat half. I'm guessing about a 60/40 ratio of breading to crab. Salad - simple greens, cucumbers and tomatoes. Hey it's a side salad so expected. Service - that was a mixed bag. My server wasn't overly friendly but took good care of me. I asked for cocktail sauce and received tartare sauce. Oh well. I'm thinking she was perhaps new. While dining, I was asked by another person if I needed anything and if everything was alright. A bit later a gentleman came by to check on all the diners. They do care about their customers. Ambience - ordinary for this type of restaurant. I do want to mention the door alarm. Ding dong upon entry and exit. That was a bit annoying because they had a steady stream of people picking up to go orders so at times it sounded like an arcade in there. Three stars could be a personal preference issue. For me, it was just alright. My pretax total was $14.99 so it is a fair deal. Not the best neighborhood eatery I've been to but certainly not the worse."}, {"review_id": "CGujfoRzDKyiC-BMz3aGLw", "user_id": "akgHS3a9NFQ6DFEeAA891w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/27/2017", "text": "I agree with some reviews herein. The parking situation was not great. I ended up making my own spot partially on the sidewalk.  After I ate I walked along the building to try to figure out why there sooo many cars. I couldn't figure it out. First let me state that I am a New Englander who likes southern cooking and I don't care what a place looks like as long as the food is good. This place was a \"typical\" southern style place that I have eaten at many times. The food is prepared out back in the kitchen and it comes up front in large metal tins that sit behind the glass cafeteria style. There isn't a menu per se as you see everything that have right in front of you. Grab a tray and let the lady behind the counter know what you want. This first room had trays the food and some benches, presumably for take-out customers waiting on something and the cash register. It also had 2 doors, One leading to the kitchen where 4 or 5 people were hard at work. The other leading to a large air conditioned dining room. Everything was clean and well managed albeit older and a combination of restaurant and yard sale furniture.  Again book - cover, don't judge. As I said earlier I like this kind of food and the decor will not distract from the food. The reason I give this place 3 (almost 2) instead of 4 stars is the food was ok. It was not bad and also not great. I had fried chicken, Mac and cheese, green beans and red rice.  The star of the show should be the chicken. It was crispy but did not have a lot of flavor. The beans tasted good, the Mac and cheese was ok and the red rice was filler. I wanted to like this place like so many of the others I have visited down south before I got Yelp. Too bad it wasn't."}, {"review_id": "azM9RNyNxj0YY2S76In6Zw", "user_id": "2i0A5OoKyiwskqvnkGq7cA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/26/2016", "text": "Yes, My Three Sons, 5 stars. I was in town for work and found myself in the Park Circle neighborhood wanting real southern food. Walking up, the doors were locked. Another interested patron, Mike, saw my experience and we were both confused as people were inside. We tried again and Antwan explains they're hosting a private event later. Mike asked if he had anything as he came all the way from Chicago (Mike and I bonded over this and being Yelpers).Hearing our disappointment and our different journeys, he went goes inside and informs us there is turkey wing, okra soup, and mac and cheese. He can do a two sides dish. Yes, please! We go inside, chat with the polite staff as they prepare for the event. Antwan comes out with the trays, carefully wraps cornbread, and packages up the takeout. He gives us a copy of their story since we were out-of-towners. I thank him immensely and head back to the hotel to eat.AMAZING! Okra soup was a perfect balance and hearty. Mac and cheese was delicious. I got a piece baked on the edge, great if you like that cheesey base. Now, I have to admit, when Antwan mentioned turkey, I was going to pass.  Usually I find turkey tough and gamey. Not here! It was juicey and flavorful. The meat came off so easy. I didn't have a knife, so to find turkey that tender was an added plus. I was quite full and decided to save the cornbread for the morning. I heated it up and had it with coffee...more cornbread, please! It has a hint of sweetness and didn't have that mill like texture as most--just soft and delicious. Go here! Food is awesome. Antwan was super accommodating and friendly. He certainly didn't have to do what he did. It definitely shows he cares about customers. If I find myself in town again, I'll make sure to go and get the seafood rice. It looks so good and if my meal was any indication, I need to get back ASAP!"}, {"review_id": "DpTh24sGDilcXPSBI79r9g", "user_id": "YacIWZfi0sxBEbpJtA7VTg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Ha.  fun and different.  we were visiting from Washington State and decided to try some southern food with our family of 7.  Appearance is not great but the people and the food were.  Cafeteria style or order off the menu.  boys all went cafeteria style but said it was the best cafeteria they'd had.   food is yummy, a bit fried yes, but that's southern food.  well worth a visit."}, {"review_id": "DC9vEYocbmNKrpZOghqPfQ", "user_id": "HEB0nn9Hi5occxoGZR8pXA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "YELP led me to this restaurant.

This is a mom and pop spot with classic soul food. I tried the fried chicken, mac n cheese, Lima beans, and rice. I basically eat this whenever I can, which is why I fail at being boney. Anywhoo, the fried chicken was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. The lima beans were a little salty but still delicious over the rice. It would have been 5 stars but for the mac. It was a little dry, didn't have enough cheese, and had a bunch of nutmeg in it which is not my fave. The sweet tea was liquid diabetes, so unless you want to kick your blood sugar up to Wilfred Brimley levels (die-beetus), maybe get something else to sip on. That being said, I would come back.
