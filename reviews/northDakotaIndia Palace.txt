By far, India Palace has the best customer service I've had in Fargo at any restaurant! Hands down. I stoped in for lunch. I've only been to one other Indian food place and that was in Duluth MN. This by far was superior. I elected to try vegetable samosa for an appetizer. This was two friend mashed potato balls and had peas in it. There was a green mint sauce and a red sauce. I perfected the red sauce simply because I'm not a fan of mint but both were good. I had the chicken Rogan Josh for the entree. This was amazing. I choose to have it spicy and you can choose the level of heat. Mild, medium, spicy or extra spicy. Spicy was just the perfect amount of heat where you feel it but it doesn't over power the flavors of the sauce. The sauce was a red sauce, tomato based that coated the chicken. The chicken was tender. I also tried the Tandoori Bread and elected the Alu Naan which had a potato spread inside it prior to frying. The bread was amazing dipped in the red sauce. The waiter brought out a small bowl of rice pudding with roasted pistachios as a thank you. It was great. I had a cup of warm tea to finish off the meal. It was spiced and tasted identical to a hot chocolate. I asked if it contained chocolate and was surprised that it did not. It was a black tea with cinnamon, milk and a few other spices. Overall the entire lunch was amazing. I would highly recommend this establishment to any first time, wanting to try something new person or a quick lunch stop. I look forward to my next visit. You can also go online to see the menu, order to go and they deliver but there is a third party that does the delivery so it's a little more to have it delivered."}, {"review_id": "uPhuxqVmCfwDr61HBR5cOA", "user_id": "CYzzSxciPpVm96-9iUYIKg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "The food was great, the staff very friendly, and the restaurant was rather large compared to some of the restaurants/cafes in the same stretch of the strip mall.

You stumble into Fargo like a pissed-off bear about to ransack a campsite. With no hope and even less energy, you decide to take a chance on North Dakotan Indian food.One hour later single tear rolls down your cheek. You realize that there IS a god because he just raptured your tastebuds. Can food compare ever again? Probably not, but you know now that there is hope for mankind as you slip off to sweet dreams of Paneer... But on a more serious note we have some very stringent dietary needs, including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, tasty, and reasonably priced ;) Our needs were met and then some, and when I thanked the staff for the great meal they were the icing on the cake of awesomeness.

Just look at his nasty responses to other reviews. Perhaps he should focus on the quality of his cooking and less on insulting reviewers and other local restaurants. Oddly enough, I was coming back to add a comment that the staff were pleasant and courteous.A solid two stars, aka \"Meh. I've experienced better,\" for the buffet. I can't comment on made-to-order entrees.Having not been back to Fargo in a while, I stopped in to the buffet today to see how this place compared to my memories of a nearby Indian restaurant that started my obsession with Indian/Pakistani/Persian food 11 or 12 years ago. The buffet consisted of a small selection of options you typically find at an Americanized north Indian restaurant - chicken tikka masala, pakoras, saag paneer, tandoori chicken, an aloo dish - as well as goat curry, kadhi pakora, and vegetable biryani.Naan - average, not terrible but I'd skip it on a return visit to leave room for the other items.Pakoras - fried veggie fritters -  were alright, but not very crunchy. I think this was a side effect of them sitting out too long.Kadhi Pakora - a spiced yogurt soup with pakoras - not bad, but the pakoras were soggy and the seasoning was a bit bland. I'd hope for it to be more sour or with more mustard flavor. It would be much better if the pakoras weren't left to sit in the kadhi, but were side by side so you could mix them in just before eating.Vegetable biryani - a rice dish flavored strongly with spices with a gravy spread out to lightly coat the rice and containing vegetables. This one was extremely disappointing. The only vegetable were peas and the biryani itself pretty much flavorless. Biryanis usually have a good spice to them as they contain saffron, cloves, pepper, cardamom, coriander, ginger, onion, mint, etc. This one basically tasted like oily and over-watered rice. Chicken tikka and chicken curry - in both cases the chicken was tough and had a texture similar to freezer-burned chicken. It either wasn't cooked well (i.e. cooked slow) or came frozen. I'd hoped the tikka to have a slightly more sour tasted as well, owing to it being a yogurt and lemon dish. They reminded me too much of store-bought curry packs combined with my own inability to properly cook chicken on a stove top.Tandoori chicken -  chicken marinated in cayenne and yogurt and roasted in a clay oven. The tandoori chicken was tender and flavorful. I usually like a crispier skin, but this is about as good as it gets on a buffet line.Goat curry - probably my favorite of the options. It has a more rich and spicy flavor to it - I assume because they assume the goat will be opted for more by those looking for a more authentic meal than locals. I'd guess this to be true since this one had clearly been undisturbed for a while whereas the chicken tikka and others were more cleared-out.Saag paneer - a rich creamed spinach dish with cottage cheese - was ok. They used a shredded cheese which I often like if it has more of a tough texture to it. In this case, there wasn't enough cheese or dense enough consistency to the cheese to give it an enjoyable chew. The flavor was pretty typical, and I ate this one up.Chai tea - aromatic spiced tea, often with milk and sugar added for sweetness. The tea was OK, but it was already sweetened to the point of being disappointing. I'd rather see more of the aromatic spiciness with some sugar off to the side to sweeten to one's liking. The reduced spices and increased sweetness is probably favored by most local palettes, so give it a try."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/india-palace-fargo?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
