The ARTICHOKE FRITES over frisee, with Green Goddess dressing, bacon and a poached egg were amazing and the main course of FILET MIGNON with truffle compound butter, red wine demi-glace, crème fraiche mashed potatoes and sautéed greens was just as good.Add a mixed green salad and a couple of craft beers and the result was wishing I was home to be able to cut my losses with this food battle and continue it the next day. Instead I forged ahead leaving not too much behind and still somehow managed to make it back to my room in the attached Proximity Hotel without too much discomfort from overeating."}, {"review_id": "oigZVsQ3q25DZxtuPEYAqQ", "user_id": "cc4R-LcGdiF7zzoK0glj6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "I really enjoyed my dining experience here. Tucked away in a painted brick building adjoined to the proximity hotel this nice place offers all kinds of delectable treats at a pretty affordable fare. We had the brussel spout entree which was fantastic (nice mixed of sauted brussel sprouts with bacon and other goodness), a medium rare steak which was truly medium rare and great frites. Throw in the profiteroles and called it a night. I truly felt like I was back in Europe. The waiters were not pushy and let you take your time. They also had a great wine list for just about every palette. They also have some outdoor patio dining space that is great as the weather gets warmer."}, {"review_id": "nTGHVligYWRLfH11-sj51A", "user_id": "bAG7y3qbpTv3hzIpx4Wf2g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "Print Works Bistro is the higher end sister restaurant of Lucky 32 Southern Kitchen, and is located at the Proximity Hotel, the only green and LEED certified hotel in Greensboro. Although I do not foresee staying at the Proximity in the near future (I will continue to stay at the chain hotels - I love my loyalty rewards points too much - judge away, y'all!), I do find myself returning to the Bistro for two things: the service and the desserts. The service here exemplifies Southern hospitality. The host and the servers are warm and genial without being intrusive or affectatious. Reasonable requests are accommodated (I got the brussel sprouts without the bacon vinaigrette and the beignets with the chocolate sauce on the side), and service is solicitous and attentive. My three favorite desserts are the financier, the beignets, and the salted caramel creme brulee, in that order. The financier is made with hazelnut, rather than almond flour, and is served warm with a scoop of lemon creme fraiche ice cream and raspberry coulis. It is a fantastic combination of flavors and textures, with the perfect balance of the sweet and the tart. The warm beignets are filled with creme anglais and are usually topped with a hot chocolate sauce. I usually request the chocolate sauce on the side, and then completely ignore it. I do love the rich taste of the chocolate sauce, but it tends to completely eclipse the taste of the beignets and the creme anglais; it takes over, and all you can taste is chocolate. I can see some of my friends saying \"you say that like it's a bad thing\". The taste of chocolate is never a bad thing, but when I want to only taste chocolate, I eat chocolate; I don't eat another dessert after drowning the taste of that other dessert in chocolate. At Print Works, I really want to taste the beignets, so the chocolate must stay on the side."}, {"review_id": "MO2_Yy2TzQREul2XVuHVnA", "user_id": "JdSEsOFfmeFjX-SDiSa10Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "I enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Print Works Bistro! This restaurant is located on the side of The Proximity Hotel, which may leave your Uber driver confused. The restaurant is beautiful with upscale decor and is bright and airy.

We did not have reservations and were able to be seated around 11 am. The restaurant is huge and well decorated. We both started off with mimosas. It was nice, because they give you the orange juice and champagne separately so you really get 2 mimosas for the price. I had the PWB Benedict and my friend had the salmon benedict. The eggs benedict was delicious! Definitely one of the best benedicts I have had. The hollandaise was perfect! The potatoes were also nice and crispy and seasoned well.

The calamari started us off. It was larger rectangular finger pieces fried to a battered perfection and served with a red cocktail sauce and white (lemony rouille) sauce. I followed with their modestly price house salad with the oil and vinegar. The salad was a plethora of different lettuces, tomatoes, watermelon radish cut to look like nasturtium flowers. It was both very attractive and tasty with the generous helping of crisp greens. Chris had the pork chop served with crème fraîche mashed potatoes and ratatouille. The  ratatouille while tasty was a bit watery. My wife tried the Bistro meatloaf in a Diane sauce. She said it was a lot of food. My daughter and I both had the steamed Prince Edward Island Mussels in a wine and herb sauce. These small mussels are the tastiest of mussels I can say I prefer them small.I was alone in having dessert, which was a decorated Crème Fraiche Cheesecake with a citrusy shortbread crust on black berry sauce. It was good, beautifully presentation but I feel they could improbve the texture if they tried.Service was first rate. The wine list was studious and International: French, Spanish, Italian, California all well represented. The bar had no Russian vodka and could not make a Gibson, as they had no cocktail onions. I settled for an American Vodka but it was not comparable.Overall, the evening was delightful. The crowd was all well dressed with the exception of one individual who looked and dressed like a gang member right out of the projects. The restaurant has a quiet elegance. There are floor to ceiling drapes to set off areas but the ceiling is like exposed Quonset hut of painted tin. The chairs are upholstered.I like it here. I would hope they would expand their standard offerings. They need a couple of choices of steak. This is a talented crew I think they can handle better potatoes. And ratatouille? Hell most people can't even spell that (I had to look it up.)"}, {"review_id": "qh584aJINjbit4WzYtbrzA", "user_id": "5y4wtrqLtCc195_jt_4C6A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Print works is a great option for brunch lunch or dinner.  We usually frequent dinner on a Wednesday when it's half price wine night with live music and  the mussels special.   The menu rotates w the season so it's always fresh, so It may not be useful to list all the things I've eaten, but I will say the duck hash at brunch was fantastic, as is the burger.   Even the meatloaf is amazing.   The French fries are pretty great too, and I've even had some notable salads there.

This is my go to Sunday brunch spot. I decided to try the crispy chicken Schitnzel (sorry if my spelling is wrong) and replaced a side with the truffled fries. The chicken was cooked perfectly, crispy indeed! The inside of the chicken was fairly tender, the outer edges had the hint of being smoked Which to me is the sweet spot. I wish the whole thing was like that. The garnishes looked nice but I really didn't use them at all because the taste of the chicken was great on it's own. The credit should go to the seasoning. The one thing I would avoid though is the streak frites, the cut of meat isn't the best nor is the portion. Taste pretty good though but not going to win over my heart anytime soon. For desert I recommend the macaroon espresso vanilla ice cream.

Our waitress was very nice, professional, and knowledgeable about the menu items which isn't always the case.  She was prompt in refilling our glasses and getting us more of that yummy salted butter we all know and love. We had one of the flatbreads for an appetizer. The dough was perfectly cooked; crispy enough to give a nice crunch but mailable enough to still have a fold to it. The corn actually worked on the flatbread and the sauce was intriguing. I had the Lemon Shrimp Risotto. The risotto was cooked perfectly as were the numerous shrimp in the dish. The chunks of salty bacon/pancetta were a nice addition. What the dish lacked was the acid factor.  To be called and \"lemon shrimp risotto\" you would assume that acid in the dish wouldn't be an issue. In fact, I think they actually forgot the lemon part.  After squeezing the life out of 4 or 5 anemic lemon wedges, the taste of the dish was spot on and delicious."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/print-works-bistro-greensboro?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
