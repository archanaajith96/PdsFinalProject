Either you love this kind of place, or.....you will not like it. Our little family freaking loved it. My little guys ordered their \"Pork N Bitch\" and their \"Easy Bitch\" and they were very proud of themselves. (mom of the year over here...heyyyy) The ladies working the counter were super awesome to them! (stickers! yes!)The line was long for a Monday morning, but the food def. lived up to the buzz. First of all, the Seattle Fog (with orange peel) was a delicious treat! Ordered extra hot for the light rain while we waited outside. I would say our food came out in about 25 minutes. But it was totally worth the wait. We grabbed a table outside, watched people, then devoured our bitchin' biscuits! Everything was AMAZING. My husband tried the Louisiana Hot Link of top of his biscuits and he said it was spicy and amazing! The over easy eggs on the \"Easy Bitch\" were cooked to perfection. We would 100% plan on going back to Biscuit Bitch next time we are in town! Thanks for the memories!"}, {"review_id": "0Ymcxz8a2Vc2rhE4dTKIvg", "user_id": "_KDforIDsQS6bIaJi0_V0g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "We woke up hangry.

We got here around 10:15, and the line was pretty long for a week day. It was beautiful outside, so it wasn't too bad. The wait is long to order and kind of long to get your food (but the staff and kitchen are small, and the meals are worth the wait). The drinks come out fast, as one person is assigned to just them I think. There isn't a lot of seating, so I would strategically have someone in your party get a table while you order for both of you or you'll be taking it to go. I got it the Orange infused mocha, as it was something I had never seen before. It was delicious and didn't come out painstakingly hot like most coffees at breakfast places, so I was able to enjoy it right away. It did get pretty rich though when added to my ridiculous breakfast decision. I tried the Easy Bitch, which is a biscuit smothered in TONS of gravy and then two over easy eggs. It may have been too much, but I still ate every last bite (vacation! Adventure!). The gravy smothers everything else too much and the biscuit was a little crunchier than I prefer, but since I usually don't let my food touch and I still left nothing behind says something. I would come here for sure if you're on vacation, but wouldn't come here too often or you're gonna weigh 300 pounds."}, {"review_id": "IOkmmfqfaqt60VrRzL3lVQ", "user_id": "YIHEsaceMbt4wUb-ojTn5w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Visited here on my first morning in Seattle. I was suppper hungry, and came here around 9:30AM, which ended up being a surprisingly good time to come to Biscuit Bitch, as the line was fairly short, but right after we ordered, the like got really long, really quickly and started to wrap around the door. There were a lot of different ways that they served the biscuit, but decided on the original biscuit sandwich with gravy on the side with spicy sausage. The sausage, as they did warn me, was reaalllly spicy, and definitely needed the gravy to dip and eat with. The biscuit was probably my favorite part. Everything you want in a biscuit, it was right there on my plate. Buttery, flaky, crunchy, soft inside, absolutely wonderful biscuit. I would like to next time try the biscuit with the grits topped with jalapeños, but definitely try the original to start if you're looking for a good, simple breakfast!"}, {"review_id": "DRRAYCadxszj6gzAewPmyQ", "user_id": "kqXi8a1nLNHkWgiv5m-dsA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "It's an experience.

An all-female rap playlist played loudly over the speaker system which made the wait easy to get through. The people who took my order addressed me as \"sweetie\" but in the cute and not condescending way, and were really friendly but also threw a couple curse words around amongst themselves when trying to get food out the door. It was fun to watch (and not offensive or excessive if you're worried about that).For food, I got the Hot Mess Bitch which comes w/ gravy and grits, scrambled eggs, and a hot link. It came out piping hot and I liked how the gravy mixed in with the grits to give it some more flavor. I also think that my plate came with two biscuits which is sooo much food.

They have a variety of biscuits here with different toppings and sauces. I decided to go with the vegetarian mushroom gravy and it was good.  The biscuit was soft, flaky and light.

The wait here is way too long.  Feels even longer if you're waiting outside in 30 degree weather!! Be prepared to wait outside as the seats inside are very limited. Ordered two items on the menu: -Smokin' Hot Bitch- Comes with biscuit and gravy, eggs and garlic grits smothered in cheese. Favorite part of this dish was the hot link and jalapenos. It can get very soggy if it's not eaten right away. Worth $12 bucks? Probably not. -Bitchwich with spam and bacon- The biscuit was super fluffy and buttery.

In terms of price, I think they're fairly even.In terms of the wait, Egg Slut (at least the one in DTLA) constantly has a 30+ minute wait.  Biscuit Bitch is open for more hours during the day and, if you go early enough, you go straight to the front.Overall, biscuits and offensive words seem to go hand-in-hand."}, {"review_id": "TP9PcC98ltCkFSWBBJWMvg", "user_id": "HQplnVRragMarOzQ8sYQeg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Ahhh Biscuit Bitch, how I miss thee!!

The first thing I noticed was the loud music playing, which I hands down loved, though some people may not like it (especially in the morning). As we crept closer and closer to the order station, I probably changed my order like 5x in my head. Everything on the menu sounded amazing! I went with the Pork n' Bitch and added 2 eggs, and my boyfriend ordered the Hot Mess Bitch. I was a bit saddened when I tried to omit the cheese from my order since I am lactose intolerant, and the lady told me they don't remove anything on the weekends. (Whaaaat???)Nonetheless, I really really REALLY enjoyed the food. The biscuit was SOOOO good. It was fluffy and in my opinion, melt in your mouth good.
