The person who took our order was super nice, and our order came out very quickly. The first thing I noticed were that the portions were very large (spoiler alert: part of my sandwich came home with me)My sandwich was DELICIOUS. I loved the sauce and veggies, and the falafel was the best I have ever had. So delicious!  My date also loved his gyro. He said it was, by far, the best gyro he has had in Knoxville.  We also split a baklava which was SO good (better than the homemade baklava I have had in the past!).  I totally understand now why everyone loves this place. The food is delicious and reasonably priced, it comes out quickly, and did I mention it is DELICIOUS?  Two thumbs up; we will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "nWo1lqJ12qzJwgJiRIFCIg", "user_id": "t7bC1nWSeCrwBpFsAAvASg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Yassin's is wonderful. I can only speak to their catering but, I already love this place. My boss ordered catering from Yassin's for a party. It was absolutely fantastic! When I picked it up, Yassin was there to personally inspect the order to ensure quality and correctness. He had a giant smile the entire time and I couldn't help but, feel very welcomed and happy to be there. It sounds crazy but, I also felt the same feelings while eating the food. As mentioned before, I'm not sure what the dishes were but, everything was delicious! I'm so glad I was introduced to Yassin and his Falafel House. I will definitely be returning!"}, {"review_id": "2kcGPFZ7WQlOEM0HpqYHFQ", "user_id": "tVATdRmknnYn5FxsSuAcNQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "I can't believe I waited so long to try Yassin's. The menu is simple, but oh so good. The gyros are the best in the city and the falafel cannot be beat. You can choose from a number of proteins (or vegetarian) in either a wrap, a plate or a salad. The portions are large for the minuscule price. Also the turnaround time from placing your order to getting your food is literal minutes! I'm so excited to see his success within the community and am proud of the fact that he now has a second brick and mortar location. I will be back, and will bring friends!"}, {"review_id": "3au_AN3A9JPWnfg_5wRzvQ", "user_id": "X3EM1m5mmUasl08lpe92Fw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "This little gem is delicious and delightful spot is one of Knoxville's finest. My mom has been vegan for years, before it became popular and I have been transitioning for a while. I wanted to stop and eat something and who doesn't love Falafel. Of course I checked out some yelp reviews and online reviews and we decided to come here. I love that this is a small mom and pop shop. I'm all about supporting small business. It was very neat clean with a minimalist decor. You would think that the decor would be more Mediterranean but it's not. It feels more like a college campus spot. We both got the Falafel sandwich and some sides . OMG it was so good. I loved the fluffy pita, and also got the hummus and babaganush. The baba gnush could have been a little better but the star of the show was the falafel. It is a must stop and dine when in Knoxville."}, {"review_id": "SDsT8PCMAevXXtgNo43BSA", "user_id": "dR5kTRZNYD7QcUXL-vDd0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "Yassin's warm smile lets you know you're welcome at his restaurant and hints at the happiness that is cooked right into every bite of the delicious food. The falafel, the chicken, even the fries. And the baklava!!! It's perfect. Yassin's is a coupe blocks from any other restaurant downtown, but walk those extra steps.

I paid for a whole day parking there so I just walked over to Yassin's. The reviews were great so I decided to check it out. The place was a decent size but sparsely decorated. Cheap looking tables and chairs scattered about. It was a beautiful day outside so I dined al fresco. I ordered the hummus and the chicken shawarma sandwich. The hummus was okay but different than what I have had. It was more of a syrupy consistency than a peanut butter consistency. It was good but not great. I ordered the chicken shawarma with tzatziki instead of the spicy garlic sauce, but about halfway through I realized they used the garlic sauce. I wasn't a fan. If they get my order right next time, I expect it will taste better. I will probably give them another try, but will skip the hummus."}, {"review_id": "eJEfPKB3rz-9uR1ENydQEQ", "user_id": "emxA0x1EKSYjSwpvi9X7mA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "First time here and will be back.   I ordered the sampler which comes with Falafel on a salad, hummus, and baba ganoush.   The falafel was cooked perfectly and seasoned very well.  The hummus and baba ganoush were both prepared perfectly.   I highly recommend them if you like Mediterranean food as you will likely not find any better in town."}, {"review_id": "2uDHDZnw7odQsAqksNPHJA", "user_id": "iipaDtoA1zHFkbAF3Gn5Rg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/30/2017", "text": "I am so glad I stopped in and tried Yassin's Falafel. It was amazing. Great place in downtown Knoxville. I had the falafel sampler plate that came with hummus and baba and it was $12. There were 3 falafels over a lettuce salad topped with tahini sauce. I got it \"spicy\" but it wasn't actually spicy at all."}, {"review_id": "ii6eZSGsh0I_yAyceTvdUQ", "user_id": "wF4mXjciW6wXphnHh7QDFA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/1/2017", "text": "I'm obsessed with falafel. I would eat it every day if I could! So, whenever I move or visit a new area, it's one of the first things I seek out. During a recent trip to ABQ I thought I found the best falafel of my life. Nope, Yassin's has now taken that crown. Omg it's good! I've tried both the spicy falafel sandwich and the spicy falafel platter. Both amazing! The sandwich is pure perfection with the  right amount of toppings and sauce. The seasoned fries were delicious too! But the platter is my absolute favorite. They have some of the best dips I've ever had! The hummus is authentic and creamy with paprika and fresh olive oil. My husband hates baba ganoush and he really enjoyed Yassin's! I loved it too! The falafel was served on top of a delicious salad with the most amazing dressing. If I could make one improvement I would say the pita served with the platter could be heated so that it isn't as chewy/tough. It's the same bread used with the sandwiches but it's less tough because it's warm. In addition to the food, I really like the vibe in the restaurant. The staff are very friendly and the music is AMAZING! During my dinner I got to hear The Cure, Radiohead, New Order, Depeche Mode, A-HA, Tears for Fears. :D"}, {"review_id": "tHU8t4XdRZJKmJLAccItzg", "user_id": "lLeFj2QHzVhPtepX6GDkqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Every time I visit Knoxville I must make time for lunch at Yassin's! The food is fresh and delicious. Albeit a bit different than other Mediterranean places. You can choose a wrap, salad, or a plate, and you won't go wrong with any choice. I typically get the chicken salad: marinated and grilled strips of chicken over shredded romaine lettuce with chopped tomatoes, onion, garbanzo beans, green olives, and chopped green pickle, which was odd at first but it works. There is a delicious garlic sauce on the side. Do not forget to try the baba ganoush- it is smooth smoky, lemony goodness! I'd venture to call it the best I've ever had, and I try baba every where I go. The falafel are outstanding - fluffy and not oily."}, {"review_id": "S6aM3elcyOhBXygXrWNhsw", "user_id": "fwsHXl_d7V0obAM1TnHbkA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "The spicy falafel salad was nice and fresh.  The falafel itself was perfectly spiced with red pepper but very, very heavy handed with the salt.  The vegetables in the salad were very fresh making for a nice compliment to the spice and helped wash down the salt.  Super friendly staff and very quick turnaround from the time I placed my order."}, {"review_id": "WhwK6WGFYYoU1dZ7oRyw4A", "user_id": "j9Z1dcoZrwn8Ul9JTnjjug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2017", "text": "Finally. This place has been on my list for the longest, and I finally got the chance to check it out after we saw Yassin featured by Square we definitely wanted to support the local business amid all the hiatus that is going on in the world. Walking in, there was a hell of a line. And knowing what long lines means, it could be an over-hyped restaurant, or it's just that good. This place...is definitely the latter.Yassin's located downtown, on the corner of Walnut and Church street. It's simplistic. I think that's the word that just sums everything up. There's a counter, where you place your order, and if you're on the go you take your order when it comes up and go. Otherwise, if you're staying there to eat then just grab and a table and you're good. The food. I came here twice. I ordered a Gyro both times. And, I have to say both times was good. I also ordered a Falafel and a Falafel Plate. I would recommend to order it spicy, as it's not really quite spicy, but more of a pepper spiciness. However, for the falafel keep in mind of the spicy option as that was actually really delicious prepared that way. I don't think that the falafel plate was worth it, however, the warps as far as the gyro and falafel were all wins for me. I didn't really try out the chicken, as well, I think if I'm going to a Falafel house, I should get their falafel. There aren't a lot of options, which isn't bad and I actually like because for indecisive customers it's easier.Anyways... this place has some solid Falafels. If you're ever in the area, I would recommend this place if you want a quick bite (if they're not packed)."}, {"review_id": "6BlnKruUAaa2slyCi_O0IQ", "user_id": "gMGezWvvF5luSuqdib91bg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Best Falafel platter ever, the quality of food and oils used is very tasty and I'm amazed hope they open in NJ or NY"}, {"review_id": "wyXICT5gDchqEguV26MmlQ", "user_id": "6TZS5ndCI8ICfvFpm55-TQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Finally got to try this place out.
