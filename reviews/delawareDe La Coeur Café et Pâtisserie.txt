This place is charming and the service equally so!Parking may be an issue, according to others, but I've been fortunate enough to find a spot when I stop by.It's worth the hassle.

This time around I had an omelet with tomato, ham and gruyere cheese side of potatoes, and my guest had a breakfast bowl with potatoes, topped with mushrooms, garlic, goat cheese drizzled with balsamic vinegar. Great friendly service that was quick and warm. Outside seating available and great selections of coffees, cappuccino and lattes just to mention a few. Fresh squeezed juice also an option. Really  great looking savory and sweet pastries, croissants and breads. The place has a real European feel. A little out of my way but will definitely revisit and dig in deeper."}, {"review_id": "lAPWSYvTyQ3R9byVHb5M9g", "user_id": "GA3k9h23aOijLB3DvKNvvw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Good food and ok service. It's tiny inside with only a few tables which is ok, but we were worried with meeting friends from Philly if we would even get a table. We got a table and were excited for the coffee menu. Unfortunately the coffee was just ok. But where else can you choose crepes, tartes, and quiche? The French toast was delish. Would have like more options with Brie other than a sandwich. Servers became a bit rude if you hang out too long - I guess they want to turn the table - just not what you think of when you imagine a French cafe. Will go again probably but not with more than one other person."}, {"review_id": "gYFbusyR3OwOY3bvDDGOkQ", "user_id": "FbNXujzkyC97Zp2vouY5Cw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "I went to the concord pike location. I was shocked by how cute it was inside--you'd have no idea you were in a strip mall with a Chucky Cheese as a neighbor.  I needed a break from the office and this delivered perfectly. The gals making coffee and serving up sweets were especially great. My latte was fluffy and hot. I try to make it a special occasion when I have coffee in the afternoon, and the latte made it a special occasion. Plus I enjoyed my coffee break with (oops) 3 macrons. I got salted Carmel chocolate. 3 for $5! A deal! Now, they weren't the absolute best macrons I've had but they were pretty damn delish. I can't wait to try more of their pastry! I have my eye set on the flaky, perfectly brown chocolate croissant. I'm afraid since my work is so close, there might accidentally, need to be more and more special occasion!"}, {"review_id": "kRL-c4onpGmVVQk9WX4mgw", "user_id": "PdYmhoq_ZZXjEr8YC6KxXA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Turkey, mozzarella, tomato, pesto panini  was a little bland to me.  Came with some kind of quinoa side that was awful.  Had higher hopes based on reviews.  For $10 would have preferred more turkey and skip the quinoa.  You be the judge pic attached"}, {"review_id": "K_qwu2ofl_ta5g8dEugp1Q", "user_id": "tJm8LpX0IohFgaMoldBtRQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "My family frequently come here and it is a very welcoming environment.

It's a tiny little cafe with like 5 tables and it's impossible to not be in someone else's way at some point. But that's alright! We came in for brunch. I had the breakfast sandwich -- a simple thing of egg, cheddar(fancy cheddar),  spinach subbed for arugula, and some sort of amazing spread. Put all of this on a fresh baguette and call it a day. Honestly anything on that baguette would have been a 5 star meal. Served with some delicate bfast potatoes to seal the carb deal. My date had a different  sandwich from the menu also on baguette (by request). Also delicious. The menu is small- they only have what they have but what they have, they do really really well. Breakfast and lunch items only. Last but not least, the service was great!! Very friendly and accommodating. I can't wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "F3v7y25NH4mZjIRG60ILbQ", "user_id": "NgwIPxghRnbB98M5S_LA_g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "This Café is all around phenomenal. From the moment my coworkers and I walked in we felt welcomed. We were immediately greeted and seated. Although they have tight quarters, we were very comfortable. Our sever was quick to tend to us and met our every need. The menu was right on the wall as soon as you walk in and the water was already on the table cold and ready to be poured. I ordered an omelette with meat and cheese and it was delicious, didn't favor the cherry tomatoes in it but I was able to eliminate them lol The roasted potatoes that come with it were cooked to perfection! My beverage was the Hot Chocolate that was ever so decadent  If you're looking to have great service and great food in an even greater environment this is the place."}, {"review_id": "2hPh-9wNyWzzXhLiz0zdrg", "user_id": "DDBM1aIU5t9JfwjwQRk1Sg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/11/2016", "text": "Baguette, Baguette, Baguette.  Whatever you decide to order, make sure it's on a Baguette.

Love it. It definitely felt like I was in a friends home more than a restaurant.I ordered the baguette with pork, minus the pork, lol.Caramelized onions, tomatoes, spinach, a scrumptious aioli, and I forget the name, but it was so so so so, good.My gf ordered the breakfast baguette and loved it.

(It is full service once you seat yourself and we sat outside)The food: They have a limited menu with four or five options which I believe keeps changing, I could be wrong. You have to go to the chalkboard menu and then order. I ordered the crepes which were pretty dried up and had minimal amounts of fruit but tasted okay. Will I go here again? Maybe not.
