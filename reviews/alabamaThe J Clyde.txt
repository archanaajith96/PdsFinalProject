Clyde for a drink, but after last week's experience with the hot rock, it's now one of my favorite spots to go for a meal! Their burgers are phenomenal, but my new favorite treat is the filet cooked at my table to my own preference! For $20, I got a choice filet with three different butters, seasoned fries, and a side salad.  The experience of cooking the steak myself was a lot of fun, but the quality of the food was amazing.  One of the best steaks I've had in Birmingham.  On picturesque Cobb Lane, the J. Clyde is one of my favorite spots in Birmingham to go."}, {"review_id": "I_czHY0Du3Wd6X5VNDc76g", "user_id": "V_yDb-sO60p2w7hPxV5P5A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Place has a good selection of beer, from our local Avondale nitro porter and Mississippi Fire Ant to some beautiful Belgian lambics and Chimay Blue Trappist. They also have some beer that is a complete trash, so if you don't know what you're ordering, it may be a good idea to ask for a sample.The food, on the other hand, wasn't quite fantastic. We have ordered two plates of beer cheese spread and two angry cajun pizzas. Cheese was very average, I can't even recall its taste. Pizzas were good while hot, but became inedible after cooled down. Also, one guy from our party has ordered BLT sandwich - it was simply bad.But despite the issues with the food, I'd still recommend this place. Many other pubs would have similar food with much poorer selection of beverages, and J Clyde isn't advertised as a restaurant.Service was reasonably good and fast, my only major complaint is that they brought 2 pizzas together while we asked them to wait with the second one."}, {"review_id": "KjdqRltB3wBRiK4aTe6Nsg", "user_id": "bjyQX9lAXcasudCYQM-WQg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "This place has the BEST atmosphere of ANY pub I've ever been to. The people were really friendly, and the bar menu is incredibly extensive. The food menu is your typical bar food list, with the exception of a few really neat items you won't find anywhere else, like a Mac n cheese bun for a burger, or the \"hot rock\" you can cook your own food on! The only reason I didn't award a full four stars to this wonderful place is because it's pretty pricy. A patty melt and 6oz of beer cost me $25. The meal didn't change my life enough to cost as much as it did."}, {"review_id": "XuHj1PCrhLbIGw592tdZrA", "user_id": "5BeD8K-TbdsFU_gvB9dEnw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Absolutely the most hipster nasty place ever.  If you want granola appetizers and Kurt Kobain Jr wanna be bartenders, this is for you."}, {"review_id": "JornbAlQHcQGV1kY-Hz-Mg", "user_id": "3pD0s1WJv6418a4PF0ByWw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/23/2017", "text": "Tucked on a quiet cobblestone street in 5 Points, J Clyde has an ideal location. They offer outside seating on the front sidewalk, as well as a large patio in the back. There are also some great inside options that allow you to enjoy the authentic pub feel.The beer selection is incredible, likely one of the best in Birmingham. With multiple options on draft, as well as bottled, there is something for every palate. If you're not a beer drinker, there are also wine and craft cocktail choices.The menu highlights pub-style food. Fish and chips, burgers, and pizza are the staples. I've had the J Clyde Burger and the Gus Burger, both of which are tasty. The burgers come with a side and you can't go wrong with the fries or sweet potato fries. Tonight I got to try a bite of the mac n cheese; it was creamy and flavorful. The fish and chips are also a great choice, made fresh and perfectly crisp. Plus, if you are a fan of malt vinegar, it's fun to know they make it in house. The servers are always friendly, but, on nights like tonight, when they are under-staffed, it makes for a bit of a wait. In addition, although the beer list is extensive, tonight they were out of two of the four options we attempted to order. However, there are no shortage of options for plan b, so it wasn't that big of a deal.Overall, if you are looking for a unique, comfortable spot with flavorful food and great beer in Birmingham, J Clyde is a contender."}, {"review_id": "UwJfp3xLSX8g4__hYwV8IQ", "user_id": "blqCOWpDFRVdKeja4qF0nw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/22/2017", "text": "I can't even count how many times I have been to this place but I'll just say it is awesome. If you are looking for one of the best (if not, THE best) craft beer areas in Birmingham, this is it. They have a front outside patio as well as a back outside patio and decent seating inside. The inside makes you feel like you are in a true pub setting and they are located off of the famous cobblestone street, Cobb Lane. The food doesn't disappoint either. One of my absolute favorites is the J Clyde burger, which has a fried green tomato and delicious remoulade sauce. The chicken fingers are some of the best as well. The staff has always been very attentive and courteous, and I can't remember a time when our order was messed up or even slow when they were busy. They are always knowledgeable on the best drink recommendations and you can't go wrong. I will continue coming back!"}, {"review_id": "81xJjTtqdYQK2cHotqFDJA", "user_id": "bTNFTIzw1s6bx8a-9IqEYA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/24/2017", "text": "I love love love The J Clyde! Definitely one of my favorite spots in Birmingham. It has a great outdoor seating area for warm days (they put heaters and plastic walls up in the winter...can still be a tad chilly, though) and a very cozy atmosphere inside.The beer selection is incredible and the staff is always quick with a suggestion if you can't decide what you want. I also like that they do a lot of special events with breweries (small-batch brews, swag giveaways, etc.). The food is also really good. I've tried most everything on their menu and my favorites are the chicken fingers and the steak & eggs (two opposite ends of the spectrum, I know, but I think that's very telling of the quality of food). Be sure to get the sweet potato fries with whatever you order!"}, {"review_id": "G4I4ZCJVLbibs6130OahCA", "user_id": "PrioZ6UL7liEWQRmNtgq6w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/21/2016", "text": "Super cozy, laid back hangout spot in Birmingham. My group of friends and I stopped in for late night drinks, so we didn't eat anything, but the atmosphere, service, beer selection and prices really make this place worthy of a four right off the bat.An awesome thing about this place is that on Tuesdays they have half off all Birmingham, AL beers. I thought that was a really cool way to highlight local beers and support local breweries. Besides the awesome 1/2 off deal we walked in to, there was a solid beer selection labeled by tastes and flavors so it's pretty easy to find your section and where your favorite beers will be.While we were hanging out, they brought out food for other tables and it smelled SO good. I'd definitely go back, not only for the beer selection but to try out some of their food as well."}, {"review_id": "ilCsVq_PbqsyTe6QZzFhQQ", "user_id": "OL_5UMmm1vXopJavuOT-rQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "8/26/2017", "text": "SCAM ALERT!!!

Parking is easy and you can sit inside or on the patio and enjoy the cooler weather. If you are hungry, want a drink and don't know where to go past 10pm in a weeknight night, this is the place.

My wife and I came to the J. Clyde for a low key date night. We love the vibe on Cobb Lane as well as the rather sprawling layout of the old building. My wife ordered the filet on the hot rock and it was a very fine cut of meat especially for the price ($19). Cooking it ourself was a fun adventure and it tasted great. I ordered the veggie burger and was pleasantly surprised that it was perfectly seasoned with tons of flavor. I enjoyed chatting the beer selection with the bartender and loved the beer I ended up with. We will continue to make the J.

The place was half full, not busy at all. Service was not up to par considering this place was running slow at the time. Menu is completely different than the last visit and we were bummed. I am assuming a new chef? Anyway it went from expecting scallops and greens with shrimp and grits to chicken fingers and burgers. Wow!We made due and ordered. My husband got the fish and chip with sweet potato fries, I ordered the chicken fingers tossed in red Asian pepper sauce served with pasta salad and a side of ranch. Also ordered saurkraut balls for appetizer. Food came out pretty quick. Husbands fish looked and tasted to come strait from Gordons frozen fish filets, fries were good. My chicken fingers were actually tasty but came with a side of ranch that was warm and smelled of food poisoning waiting to happen, pasta salad was horrible. It was just cooked noodles with some feta thrown on top. Finally half way through dinner they brought our appetizer. The saurkraut balls on top of the coleslaw was the best thing of the whole night. Since I had checked into this place on Yelp, I received a 10% off coupon which the waiter didn't seem to be pleased and said she would have to find a manager. The 3 stars is for a great beer selection and a pretty chilled place. If you are looking to come hang out and unwind and have some tasty beers, this is definitely a nice spot. We just wont be coming back for food. I really hate the menu change but maybe they were going for more of a bar type atmosphere with typical food?"}, {"review_id": "EvVYL9vILFWz6wjn1Wc18Q", "user_id": "X6xX0ZMFaTzELQ_2AtB3Yw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/1/2017", "text": "Good ole J Clyde. Great pub style bar and restaurant tucked away down a cobblestone road that takes you back in time. One of the only places in Birmingham that remind me of the true London pubs I frequented while overseas. Indoor and outdoor dining, with a large back deck area that is great most of the year. They even have outdoor heaters in the winter! They have a pub style menu with fare including a cheese plate, wings, burgers, and some different items like kimchi tacos and sauerkraut balls. I highly recommend those sauerkraut balls! The pizza is always good as is the fried chicken. They offer fresh locally grown vegetables seasonally. The Clyde is known for their extensive beer list and it does not disappoint. Whether you're looking for an IPA, a local brown, or a bottled sour, they will definitely please any palate. This is one place I actually don't mind dining at alone. The interior is just so cozy and I can almost always sneak into a solo spot at the bar."}, {"review_id": "x2m1Iq5qK8BozeQxAqhaXA", "user_id": "mKCOv04oTSI7izSlLPM39g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "8/28/2017", "text": "The J Clyde use to be the spot to go.. I've lived in Birmingham the past 10 years and have always brought all of my out of town guests here for the amazing beer variety, chicken fingers, and Mac and cheese!!! I mean I would dream of those chicken fingers and got all my friends hooked! They were plump, fried to perfection, tender, and had the most flavorful sauces! Something must have changed over the past year because the chicken fingers have gotten hard/charred and skinny, the Mac and cheese dry, and their beer list lacking local favorites. I've given j Clyde many tries hoping I was showing up on an off day but the past 2 times, in addition to below par food, the service was rude and I hate to say that I do not see myself returning any time soon.

I've actually never found a drink here that I've actually liked here, which is disappointing because it's what they are known for. They may be great for guys to have drinks, but I need something sweeter. Their cocktail selection isn't huge.The waiters and bartenders here are great, and I've never had a huge wait time. They have an outdoor screened in patio that they keep nice and warm during the winter, so space is luckily never an issue for them.

Then this is your spot. The very epicenter of the free the hops movement which brought good beer to the state of Alabama. There must be hundreds of options here when it comes to choosing your brew. Good specials, preset flights or build your own. If it's a beer, they probably have it. If you need to impress a beer snob, then take them here, if you just need to get some beer for a non beer snob, still take them here. Nice seating in front, sprawling patio out back, and good amounts of indoor seating as well. Laid back, easygoing yet efficient servers, and an attention to quality that makes the place stand out. The food isn't too bad either...actually, it's pretty good. The burgers speak for themselves, large, fresh, delicious and creatively conceived. Get one with an egg on it if you want. They cut their own fries, they make their own sauerkraut balls, the mac and cheese is dense and cheesy and can soak up some beer if need be. They have a cheese plate, they have steak and eggs. They have hand breaded chicken strips and fish and chips. Everything I've ever had here was obviously thought out and done right, and it's always been delicious. This time around I went with the cheese plate and the steak and eggs. Not gonna be the steak you get at a big steakhouse, but not a bad one at all. Most all the food is significantly better than you would expect to get at a bar. Fair prices, good quality, and nice atmosphere. The kind of place where you could get drunk with your friends on a Friday night, or where you could take your mom for lunch. If you haven't been, get down there right now. If you have, then go back. This is the kind of local business that's easy to support. You'd be hard pressed to find a better beer selection anywhere I've ever been, and again, the food certainly won't disappoint."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-j-clyde-birmingham?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
