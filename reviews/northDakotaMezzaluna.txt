I think I speak for a lot of people when I say that many would not expect much from a restaurant in such a small, isolated town in North Dakota, but as it turns out, Mezzaluna delivers tasty high quality dishes that are on par with highly respected restaurants in much larger cities. If you are passing through Fargo, you owe it to yourself to give this place a try. Here's what we loved about our experience:1) The drinks: we had an assortment of cocktails, and while I totally forgot the names of any of them (which is ok, because the happy hour drinks seem to change frequently), they were all really, really good. At around $7 each, they were also a great value. 2) The food: everything we had was amazing. I will start out with the \"bruschetta,\" which should really be labeled as a charcuterie plate, as that's how it's presented (quite few different meats and assorted roasted/picked veggies, plus some bread)...whatever it's called on the menu, it's absolutely amazing. We also really enjoyed the walleye tacos  (also super yummy), the seared tuna (a smaller dish but also really tasty), and the happy hour burger + sweet potato tots (absolutely HUGE for $7.50). 3) The service: very attentive without being overbearing. Food and drinks came super quickly.4) The atmosphere: really nice (a great place for a date...and be sure to dress up at least in business casual attire to fit in) and comfy. 5) The prices: I don't even think our entire bill came to $60 with tax and tip, which we were absolutely floored about considering we walked out super full, a bit tipsy, and really happy. All in all, a great value.  Happy hour is 5-6pm Tuesday-Saturday (yes, it's Friday and Saturday too!). Give it a try!"}, {"review_id": "WHqLj4r1QczHsN-uitbbYg", "user_id": "h-qPbIVRFi7r_0fDWnnKJg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Rack of Lamb is really good. The amount of herb used was mild but it was just right.8 pieces of rib in my order, more than enough for one person.I ordered medium and it was perfectly cooked. Char grill flavor intensity matched the sauce reduction. $36 might be expensive but considering the quantity and quality, it is a very good deal."}, {"review_id": "8nKlR_-nfQjfBY_YOh_lkA", "user_id": "Cyng8a7LsvXZdWk7bYrr9Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "My wife and I stopped into Mezzaluna on New Year's Eve. This was my first visit to Mezzaluna and my wife's second. We had a reservation and arrived five minutes prior to the reservation. There was no issues or delays getting us seated on time. The host was courteous and polite. Our waitress arrived within five minutes. We ordered the wrapped shrimp while deciding what to have for dinner and they were really good. They arrived on a bed of risotto. It reminded me of an upscale shrimp and grits. We decided to order two additional appetizers and I got the feeling the waitress wanted us to order an entree. She became less attentive and never asked how the appetizers were when they arrived. She instead focused On the table of four next to us. My wife had the crab cakes and they came nicely decorated and were tasty. I selected the walleye tacos. They came out in a pair and looked great. There was a sweet slaw placed on top of the fried walleye. The walleye was a very tiny portion and over fried. The tortilla shell was simply a shell. I expected it to be warm but this wasn't the case. Over the tacos may have been a 3 on a 5 scale. I decided to order the oysters which came out on a bowl of ice. The Champaign sauce was a miss for me but I'm not a huge fan of Champaign. The waitress came back and took our plates and in the process spilled the sauce from the oysters on my pants and my wife's scarf. I was surprised there was no apology and luckily the sauce didn't stain.Overall, it was ok. Definitely a higher end establishment. The dinner menu looked pretty good. We had a couple cocktails and left. I'm not sold on the establishment yet."}, {"review_id": "1aV03YoZ7LsqvcK5FRrwmw", "user_id": "1DhKvepHRNKs3aUw6NSOKg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "Mezzaluna is probably the nicest/priciest fine dining restaurant in the fargo area, and people do have high expectations when going. Ive gone a fee times and will confirm that the food is very good, although some dishes are smaller than you'd think. The menu is varied, with lots of options for all tastes. We've had the rack of lamb, the glazed salmon, bison meatloaf and beef sirloin with shrimps which were all really tasty. Servers are very knowledgeable and will make sure you have a good experience. However, note that it gets busy, and during rush hours on weekend it will take a while to get your food (sometimes over an hour) and it will come out barely warm. Id suggest going during the week to avoid having to send your plate back. It's worth trying for sure, just make sure to go at a time when you'll enjoy the full great experience."}, {"review_id": "n91JI7PZx0k1XZX182gVNg", "user_id": "3KKX7dkGUoQm9u-_ND3jQQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Passing thru Fargo wanted to enjoy nice celebratory dinner. Menu online was enticing, secured our reservation, 1/2 hour later than desired time, popular place! Parked right out front, we were shown to the Ariel oyster shell booth. I doubt our male companion felt like we did, but we were excited to be at one of the best seats in the house. Service was on par with fine dining expectations. Everything was quite perfect, attention to detail. Even when our side of beautiful saffron risotto was delayed, arriving just as we were joking about it. It appeared with apologies, advising it would be removed from bill. We had an amazing meal that will always be remembered."}, {"review_id": "CWXc1_ezvf7rk5nwXlhAKg", "user_id": "k1RchlSyGQc20bFBPNzUNA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Salmon dish was fantastic! The rice, meso glaze, and everything else complimented the flavors of each other really nicely. The vibe was really cool, and service was great. Only reason it's not 5 stars is because I believe the cocktail (old fashioned) could use some work. I believe the old fashioned is a staple of any good cocktail bar, and although it was good, I would change some things about the way it's crafted. Overall had a great experience and would recommend to anyone coming to Fargo."}, {"review_id": "ZMt0H1nNULYnWuleeESqLA", "user_id": "Zpl3GNP_9MAXZQhWCvtasQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Great serves.   The steak and shrimp was excellent.    I loved the olive pesto with the bruschetta.   This is our new favorite.  Thanks for being casual in dress.   ."}, {"review_id": "pTK0x7B4KOZiOTKURlnKRg", "user_id": "FD63lOJby8IVuBXLP25ZlA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "This is Fargo's best dining option. I sat at the bar most recently, wanna say the bar tender was Max. Young guy with a passion for his job. He really liked describing the specials and took extra time and care on each cocktail he mixed. On this night (a particularly cold one) I was in the mood for comfort food. I went with the Mac and Cheese and tomato soup. It was a great flavor combo. The Mac had nice melty cheese, panko crumbs for texture, and BIG chunks of bacon for meatiness. My only gripe and reason for star deduction was the use of flat noodles in the Mac. I prefer a penne or corkscrew. Something that has a texture. I scored a free dessert via Yelp. Bar tender recommended the tiramisu. It was fantastic. And after having a beer I was jealous of all the clever cocktails I saw being served. I went with an Irish coffee to double down on the dessert. AWESOME drink and only $7. The whipped topping made before my eyes made it worth while. The fresh shaved nutmeg was crazy. If you've got one restaurant to hit on your expense account while in Fargo, go here."}, {"review_id": "NXNEjW2h6yTfVOcTfsxdpw", "user_id": "6JFPn3cHzHpG-uN8lvQ4lQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2017", "text": "One of the more pleasant surprises from my first trip to Fargo was the plethora of good restaurants and the variety of great food. Don't get me wrong. I have lived in and traveled through small towns, and understand that there are great restaurants and hidden treasures all across the land. But my experience has been that these are usually the exception to the rule. That some of our country's most \"out of the way\" places typically fair poorly when it comes to freshness, variety, quality of produce, or ethnic cuisines. And while this may or may not still be true, Fargo stood out because everywhere we went stepped up and delivered. And that impression began at Mezzaluna.After checking into my hotel (the HoDo, also awesome), I checked out the downtown restaurant scene and found the Mezzaluna Yelp review. But what sold me was when I asked the front desk at my hotel for a recommendation, and Mezzaluna was the first thing they said. \"That's it,\" I said to my travel companions, and off we went. And boy were we pleased.This place is in the renovated portion of a downtown building with a bar in the middle separating the venue into two haves for dining. And while the name might suggest otherwise, Mezzaluna is a contemporary American place with a menu of meats and pastas, some seafood, and a lot of potatoes and veggies. Pretty standard fair, but well executed and flavorful. We started with craft cocktails that we're well made and quite large. We enjoyed a shrimp appetizer (which was outstanding), had a pasta carbonara and a 12 oz. ribeye, followed by a terrific creme brulee.Not a lot that was unexpected beyond the terrific selection, presentation, and execution. And the hospitality made for a very nice welcome to this fun little town. If I'm inFargo again, I will certainly be back."}, {"review_id": "r3Bzu65C8d7qz7msDymjnQ", "user_id": "95g3yPAqHAsTkeqJa1hfTQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "Outstanding service from the time we arrived through our departure.

We had great service and the atmosphere was great, but the food was very underwhelming. I ordered the Filet Mignon and was unimpressed by the quality of the meat. The flavors were great together, but the steak was a bit overcooked for my liking and didn't have the texture that you expect from a tenderloin. The wine menu is extensive and we had a fabulous bottle that the server recommended, but the food didn't match the service and drinks.
