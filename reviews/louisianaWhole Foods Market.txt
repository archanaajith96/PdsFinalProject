All I know is that this Whole Foods has better breakfast than the Metairie location, although that isn't saying much. I would argue that Starbucks has better breakfast sandwitches: better flavor and the nutrition is comparable. Starbucks is about the same price, and sometimes cheaper.The food selection here seems to be the same as the one in Metairie, though this one seems even cleaner. The only reasons I still come to Whole Foods for breakfast are customer service and the ability to purchase a frozen lunch before I go to work. Otherwise, I'd be at Starbucks."}, {"review_id": "dYNug6BqV50FNKoqWnkEZg", "user_id": "iJ97UrvPlGNttp44qsJ-4A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "An expansive enough grocery store, but it managed to be a bit weak on some of the things that I wanted. Mind you, what I wanted were specialized items like non-dairy protein shakes and bean-based snack foods, but if you're going to WF, that's what you expect. Additionally, if they had toothbrushes I didn't see any, and I ended up getting them elsewhere. They also had few registers and staff for a store of this size; I would be concerned about peak times.That having been said, overall, it's the same as most of its branded brethren, a large super-premium grocery store which now has an Amazon locker (and who knows what's coming)."}, {"review_id": "TefQ3YqdW5m1y756Y-BFig", "user_id": "PIE78y5uvjyKAI_gCDGw-g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/9/2017", "text": "The staff is overall very friendly and will point you in the right direction for things. I do always enjoy my interactions with the people checking you out. They are personable and fun! The hot bar is usually a bit overarm, so i tend to avoid it unless desperate.

It's the store that first introduced me to natural healthy eating, so it holds a special place in my heart and stomach!  It's always like a mini vacation when I go in there and really have time to shop. Sometimes I even get a coffee!  I love their Allegro brand coffee! Although known for being quite pricey, I find that their 365 brand is fairly reasonable. I've always found the employees there very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable!  Also, there bakery makes some awesome cakes and sweets!!  I'm sure they're still not superhealthy but at least there natural!  Keep up the good work Whole Foods!

These are the main things I usually get here: fresh kale, refrigerated probiotic, refrigerated almond milk espresso, whole rotisserie chickens, Spirulina powder, make-up and grain-free chips. I think I buy more fresh kale than anybody I know, so I need a lot of it and it needs to be the freshest of the freshest. Yes, I love my kale and Whole Foods always seems to have an abundance of it and I thank them for that. Their cooked, whole, rotisserie chickens are wonderful and I love the buy 2, get $4 off. Such an awesome source of protein and the flavor doesn't taste like anything junky is injected into it. Whole Foods has an awesome \"Whole Body\" section complete with make-up and other health and beauty products. I spend a lot of time in those aisles. Thankfully, they have low to high price ranges, so most budgets could be accommodated. When Whole Foods has sales, they have sales and it's on a lot of their high-quality products. If you have certain dietary restrictions (such as gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, etc.), you will find a lot of great stuff here. And if you can't find something? Ask a sales associate. I have to say that my favorite part of store has to be the bakery and their hot foods/grill area in the back. There is always some yummy brisket back there and their desserts are just heavenly. Before, they used to have a gelato section, but that is long gone and has been replaced with more seating. Their coffee bar has expanded into a coffee & juice bar + there is a cheese bar now! Love it! When I first moved to Baton Rouge 8 years ago, my eyes lit up when I saw a Whole Foods in town. It really brought back the comforts of being home in California, since they are everywhere there. I'll definitely always be back, especially when I know some of the bright, shining faces that grace their store daily."}, {"review_id": "fqdlFi76359yf8WcMACWJw", "user_id": "biTt11Hsumf8eT2vkZPdtw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/28/2016", "text": "Imagine you want an opinion on a recipe, you would probably ask your mother. If you needed advice on how to change your oil, you would ask your father. If you wanted a suggestion on where to eat or what to do, it is no brainer you would log into Yelp like any awesome Yelper! LolSo if you wanted to know which brand of coconut water, you would ask your trusty Asians. Why? Because we know our coconuts. Here is a free tip: ALWAYS buy the young coconuts when you travel to exotic islands/Asia/Carribeans.  They are so much sweeter than the big ones.  Free tip #2: you can drink it room temperature, but if you like it cold...many touristy places have them on ice. However, DO NOT put ice in it. It will change the flavor.Harmless Coconut water from Harmless Harvest is definitely not the cheapest ($3.99-$5.49/bottle), but the taste is amazing. Don't let the pink color throw you off...it is because it is unprocessed. Seriously. Go get one and thank me later.This location is very clean and the staffs are amazingly helpful. This is a great place to find organic products.

Since it was King Cake season I had to bring one to a Super Bowl party for everyone to try. So I grab a King Cake that's labeled \"Raspberry Cream Cheese\" but when we cut into it a couple of hours later at the party it's just the regular plain kind. (Which isn't very good by the way, it's too dry.) So I called Whole Foods and told them what happened and they told me to come back & swap it out. Luckily I wasn't too far from them so I went and Karl from guest services was awesome! He told me to grab another one & to cut it to make sure it was Raspberry Cream Cheese. When I went to grab another one I noticed that the Raspberry filled ones weighed like 3 times more than the plain ones and you could also see the Raspberry filling oozing out. I guess I should've paid more attention to the actual King Cake and not just the label on the box and I would've saved myself a trip. Well I'm glad I paid more attention this time because ALL the plain King Cakes were mislabeled.(That sucks for whoever made that mistake.) I brought the King Cake back to Karl and not only did he swap it out but he put the credit back on my credit card which I really wasn't expecting. Really good customer service!

But after YEARS of dealing with the Mothers day crowd they STILL CANNOT GET IT RIGHT. Pros1. Really there is only one pro which is that they beef up their staff at the flower station.Cons1. Every staff person at the flower station is working on flower arrangements. WHHHHYYYYYYY??? I'm a pro at buying flowers  from whole foods. I want mine wrapped in tissue so I can go. Flower arrangements in a vase take up a substantial amount of time. There should be at least one person dedicated to just wrapping flowers. Leading me to#2.2. Why don't you have a do it yourself wrapping station like almost every other wholefoods???At the Metairie store,  on mothers day,  they got it set up for you to do it yourself. Super fast,  super easy,  it frees staff from having to help you so they can focus on replenishing flowers,  helping other customers,  and doing those time consuming arrangements! I just don't get it!!!Yall aren't new to this. Yall know what's coming down the pipe line. Why yall act brand new every year????3. Staff attitude. Sooooooooo, this I totally  don't understand. And I swear,  this is the same staff every year looks like. They are frustrated,  they are overwhelmed,  and they are over repeating themselves. So arrange stations!!! First,  they have pre-ordered flower arrangements prominently displayed up front....whhhhyyyyyyy? Yall know customers are going to think they are for sale! So staff is mad that they keep having to tell folks that they are preordered....well, stick those in the back!!! And assign somebody to deal with the pre-orders,  like,  oh, I don't know,  someone at the customer service desk....who was straight chilling this morning sipping on a juice!Move the damn grapefruit stand over and put a person there with some flowers and tissue  paper and let them wrap flowers....all.day. This will ease tension!4. Do better.
