My wife and I went here after seeing the amazing reviews, but after trying it, I don't understand why. I got the meat sampler:- tri-tip: cold and there's no taste. We tried adding salt & pepper, but that meat was helpless. - ribs: edible but cold.- pulled pork: cold & tasteless. Even the BBQ sauces were awful! The only good thing about the restaurant is the friendly staff. I rarely turn away food, but I left with an empty stomach."}, {"review_id": "3VrGKXSUzxzADoAD2Uvmiw", "user_id": "u-LRHqN_PBHgD7vNKauQbQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "Anyone who rated more than 2 stars has never been to Rib Shack in Eagle. My visit tonight at BBQ4Life was my first. The food was barely warm and was definitely very cold by the time I was half way through. They only have 1 style of BBQ sauce on the table but sell several more flavors that were on display. The seating is on wood picnic tables like you use at a park. When I'm surging on higher priced BBQ, that's not what I would expect. There were several checks at our table. (Came with friends) And they ran our card on our friend's meal that was 1.5 times more expensive.I was hoping for a better experience."}, {"review_id": "djJskjb_lhA_lR9ya1URlQ", "user_id": "zID5RNhmlFeoME6xzc7Pyg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "What a great place with a lot of options.

It's a good spot but I won't be rushing back. I had the \"half meat sampler\" plate. All the meats were good but all the food was marginally warm which is a big factor for me with BBQ food. I wasn't a fan personally of the potato salad and next time would just get fries. The desserts bring this place back up to 4 stars for me. I'd go back just for desserts. Really enjoyed the bread pudding a la mode and the lemon bar.

A few blocks from our air bnb we drove past this place and knew we had to try it.Upon entering you are shortly greeted by friendly and happy waitresses. The place isn't too big but it's cozy and definitely has that ma and pa feel! There are booths for tables and wooden park style benches with a table adding to the overall aesthetic of the place.Their food was amazingly delicious! I had the pulled pork sandwich and their vegan potato salad. The bbq had so much flavor and literally melted in your mouth. The vegan potato salad was tasty as well perfectly seasoned and as good as a fair winning potato salad. My daughter has their veggie Mac n cheese which I of course had a few bites of. I love that they had an option to make something for my little one a little healthier and delicious.If we ever go back to Boise this place is definitely on our list to return to!

It isn't what I thought about when I think about a BBQ place... but it works for the place. The aroma when you first walk in is the BBQ pit. Which is always a nice aroma. Staff:Friendly. Our waitress was helpful, and answered questions we had about the menu. She was always promo with refilling our drinks. They bussed the tables right away. Food: It was quick to come out.  The cooks did not skimp on the cheese, meat, or jalapeño. The large portion is big enough for four people. The big foot sandwich was okay. In my humble opinion it lacked seasoning, and was skimpy with meat. The mac daddy on the other hand was DELISH!!! I would highly recommend it.

I tried the bratwurst and was so full when I finished the first half that I took the rest home. Per usual my partner and I both chose mac n cheese as our sides and I got to eat most of it so I was very happy. The mac and cheese is not the most flavorful or the best ever but it is a great side and it serves the purpose of balancing out the salty-sweet combination of the bbq sauce and meats. He got the half and half (half pulled pork half tri-tip) sandwich and loved it. When we left he was already talking about how excited he was to eat his leftovers later that night. Their new items look really tasty and we will definitely be returning to see what other tasty improvements that have! As far as ambiance goes I really love it. I especially love that the tables are picnic style."}, {"review_id": "8m4ibQUOGw91PTiIV1uf7g", "user_id": "va5t0cAI0aGJH5BRk-YnKg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Okay, I haven't been in here yet, so I will update when I taste the food.

Smelled absolutely amazing.....smoky and meaty.  Perused the menu and I decided on the Meat Sampler.  Comes with Tri-tip, half a rack of ribs and pulled pork.  Came with 2 sides.  I picked the country beans and the Cole slaw.  Okay.....I'm excited!         Okay.....order in.....and we wait.  We wait.  We talk....we wait.  We wait some more. My beer runs dry and we wait some more.  I would say we waited about 40-45 minutes till the food came out.  Waitress tells us it's coming right up. We wait a little more.  Viola it FINALLY shows up. Oh damn that's a big plate.  Can't wait to dig in.      What to eat first? I try the ribs......chewy.  Not tender.  Flavor is good and smoke is present and they are meaty.  Not done well though.  Seemed underdone.  Damn. Pulled pork is okay.  Not much flavor but tender and smoky.  Mine is better.  Tri-tip.....now I'm a Californian and Tri-tip is our JAM.....I make it all the time and it rocks......this.....not so much.  First it's way underdone.  Second it's chewy and tough.  Third...it's COLD.  Sooo disappointing.  I take my BBQ seriously as I make my own rubs, sauces, and cook things to perfection when i cook.  This meal, while big, just wasn't good.  The country beans were like country carrots with a bean here and there....no flavor.  The Cole slaw was meh.  Again mine is better.  So disappointed. Can't even tell ya.        I will be sticking to my regular BBQ place in Eagle, Idaho....they know how to do BBQ.  Sorry guys....I tried.  It's a no from me."}, {"review_id": "9P2C8Dd9RD0jLICKRAjhSw", "user_id": "VXy6eNN0Cl2cx_zX15KRtw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "This is a three star BBQ place.

This time I went with a group of friends and decided to foray into their vast sandwich selection. I was torn between the two sides of bbq beans and Mac and cheese. So I decided to venture out there try something new and unique the Bigfoot sandwich: pulled pork, Mac and cheese served on thick Hawaiian toast. I used the chivers bbq sauce on the table alternating between the original and the spicy apple bbq sauce. I found the sandwich to be absolutely delicious!! The flavor profile of the Mac and cheese combined with the smoked pull pork in addition to the chivers bbq sauce was very tasty. The toasted Hawaiian bread was the perfect pairing for the sandwich (thick and was able to absorb all the flavors without becoming soggy, falling apart). Their smoked meats are killer; the smell alone when you walk already had you salivating. The smoked pulled pork, ribs, and Tori-tip are rich in bbq/smoky flavor. They definitely know to put our delicious bbq..if you are looking for delicious local bbq place head on over to the bench try these guys out!!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/bbq4life-boise?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
