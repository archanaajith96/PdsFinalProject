But equally as cool as it can't be controlled...Other than that - all of the food was wonderful.

Firstly, we waited over 45 minutes before we even got food! How? Chatting and exercising patience I guess. Initially, a young woman came to take our order (hubby wasn't set, but we told her what we wanted for drinks and app). Not sure how long it took for drinks, but at least 10 minutes, then another 5 or so before a guy came back to take the rest of our order. We finished our drinks and watched as other people who came in after us were already being served. We did wonder, but flagging someone down wasn't that easy. I'm not sure how (since we were in the path to the kitchen) no one noticed that we didn't have any food on our table. It's not like the place is that big, and there can't be more than 15 tables. I did finally flag the guy down to inquire why it was taking so long, and I knew, that he knew, that they had screwed up.Finally got the app (crispy seafood calamari), which was delightful in every way, but then our food arrived within 5 minutes or so, which was not optimal. Also, our entrees came out about 5 minutes apart. I got the Rice noodle bowl with shaking beef and egg role, which was not my first choice. My original instinct was to go for the Pho; seemed logical. My second choice was shaking beef, even though I rarely order beef, but then I saw the noodle dish with shaking beef and thought that was a good compromise. Note to self: listen to instincts. The egg roll was cut up into pieces and sitting on top, and the beef, which was supposed to be \"seared until a smoky crunch forms\", was not that at all. In fact, it was slightly under and much of it gristly. Lastly, and not that it mattered, there were no peanuts either (as stated on menu). Husband had the Lemongrass chicken, which was tender, rich in flavor and of course made me regret my choice. :(The staff was apologetic, and we weren't angry, but certainly a bit miffed. They did offer us a free drink (a little too late honestly), and I know they were genuinely concerned about the error, but they need to get it together. They seem like very sweet people, eager to please, but the owner tried too hard to explain and justify the mishap, which in some cases only makes it worse. Don't blame, just acknowledge that it was a collective error, miscommunication or whatever and move on. We're human; we understand.Despite this, I would be willing to return and give it another try. It wasn't a deal breaker, but I have to admit that we were somewhat disappointed by the experience."}, {"review_id": "6QsyLBWvqJ7cgK-WlswvVQ", "user_id": "bwhrVU1AM-FfkfSsiKvqWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "This place has great delicious Pho!

Their food quality and customer services have always been great and I absolutely loved it. The reason I am giving them a two stars this time is because I did not appreciate the way the owner (not the waitress) handled my situation.Long story short, I ordered an Avocado Chicken Salad which is listed as half off (only on Saturdays) and supposedly to be $4.50 (this is what the menu says and all their wall/ TV menu says). When I got my check, they charged $5.00 for that. So I asked the waitress where that extra 50 cents came from. Okay, she said it is \"probably\" the menu is not updated and that she would let the owner know and take that 50cents off. I accepted that rationale, but I still insisted to talk with the owner regarding this matter because a customer's word is stronger than a worker's word ten million times and I did not want the waitress to get into trouble from that. When the owner came over, she did not apologize for their mistake and SHE WAS QUESTIONING MY MATHEMATICAL INTELLIGENCE. She was like \"50% off $10 is $5\". Like neh, I know how to do my math and I taught calculus at a college. And here is the thing, I don't care if it's 50 cents or 5 cents. If it's different from what the menu says, then it is you breaching a written contract. The problem here is you cannot read the price you listed on your own menu and you are not apologizing for your mistake and you are not admitting your fault and you are blaming the mistake on the customers and questioning their intelligence on their mathematical skills. If all the customers did not check their receipt before paying, this extra 50 cents per order could turn out to be thousandsssssss of dollars every year. I practically could have filed a lawsuit against you instead of letting you know, Pho Latern.Again, I am totally happy with the waitresses and the food quality BUT NOT the way how the owner handled this situation. (The lady owner, not the guy owner)"}, {"review_id": "t5guxlp8f3vnLKNNcR8-Sg", "user_id": "Ob8oJI3ioEQ1LDRMk6QuGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "We've got seafood platter, mussel, phoritto and beef noodle soup...!

As for food the dumplings were great. The Thai ice tea bubble tea was a let down. I love Thai ice tea and definitely love bubble tea, but it was not sweet at all. My combination Pho was okay, I've had better in NYC. Really wanted to like this place but to be freezing trying to eat soup and still not warm up was not okay.

We arrived on a Tuesday evening and were impressed with the decor and general aesthetics. As we proceeded to look over the menu, it was getting apparant that the place was getting slammed with customers and to go orders. We ordered 2 appetizers, the mussels and fried seafood(calamari). The mussels were in a thai curry sauce. A good portion with a mild curry flavor and a bit of heat. We all wished we had something to sop up the sauce with. The fried seafood came with a sweet and sour ginger sauce and steamed buns. Delicious! Our main courses were Chicken Pad Thai, Shaking Beef and Pad Kee Mao with crispy fish. I enjoyed the Pad Thai, which was pretty traditional, although it didnt have the peanuts that usually comes as a garnish with most Pad Thai. I found myself missing them. The Pad Kee Mao was my favorite. The crispy fish was somewhat overcooked but the flavor was awesone. The Beef was the only issue we had at the table. It was very tough and hard to chew. I think the day we visited was even a surprise to the staff. The restaurant got slammed with customers and to go orders all at once and they were overwhelmed. They only had one server, and the hostess had to jump in to serve as well. At one point I had to fill our waters at the table(which I had no problem doing.) Overall, I think the food was good enough for me to give this place another shot and hope they dont get slammed."}, {"review_id": "5lqZdzM4A42tfItXJdv2uQ", "user_id": "r0eG2nt4e2ggxB34Q4qN8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "The food is absolutely amazing!!

I'm definitely a fan of their pho, tea leaf salad and avocado salad. I could eat that everyday. It's been neat to watch their transformation from a Vietnamese grocer with food options to a full-fledged restaurant.On a day when my wife and I can't seem to get out of the house, Pho Lantern is my preferred restaurant to get delivery from. My order usually ends up being the avocado salad (sometimes with the crispy fish add on), and a few orders of Pho. They are usually packaged pretty well and I'm a fan of the broth.Definitely recommend giving this place a try after their remodel!

That was super helpful. Food was ready for pickup as soon as I got there. I got the grilled pork sandwich and added avocado. For $5 this is a great menu option. The sandwich is a good size, so if you're splitting apps, I'd recommend one of their Vietnamese sandwiches. Got the Phoritto with beef broth. this was my first Phoritto so I don't have much of a comparison. I would have liked more rice noodles inside. There is a generous helping of broth that comes with it, and overall I did like the concept. However, it's not crammed with flavor. But, still worth a try. We got the udon noodle soup with seafood. Good amount of shrimp, calamari, scallops, crab, and as well as vegetables. Great broth too. I wasn't an overall fan of this with udon though. Maybe a different noodle. Lastly, shared the small spicy seafood tofu soup. For a small, this was a generous portion. I'm not sure which white fish was in it but the broth was good, although not too spicy. The tofu was thin, so didn't have much of a firm texture but held up. I'd go back. I still haven't tried the actual pho from here, or the avocado salads which are usually my favorite."}, {"review_id": "7XxTQPFqnc6MgfpeiMIz9A", "user_id": "oVoucnaIIcg42Z28oOGgYA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "Don't be deceived by the super shady exterior.

After our first pad Thai night Pho Lantern is out second stop. I had no clue this was the old Niagara Seafood however I also admit I was never there. Parking appears to be only on the street and walking up the exterior is very unassuming however walking in they done a cute job with the place. The counter is immediately to your right upon walking in, someone will seat you. Check out the adorable koi image on the window facing the door, across from there and acting as a wall in the dining room is a mermaid glass wall. Additionally there is a stone tile with a variety of salt aquariums for your viewing pleasure. The chairs are comfy enough and the tables set apart just enough to give some intimacy to your conversation, well I know I couldn't really hear the tables around us but I don't know if they could hear us. We decided to split a few dishes since we didn't want to do a repeat of our previous experience and order 3 pad Thais that ended up being disappointing. Additionally if you check-in on Yelp you can get a free soda. For our meals we ordered the special of the night, the muscle appetizer which I enjoyed due to the coconut sauce, to me I could taste the hint of coconut and a little heat but neither was over powering, my only wish was some sort of bread soak up some of the juices and slices vegetables. Additionally we ordered the crispy fish selecting the calamari, served with buns we made little calamari sandwiches. I really enjoyed the crunch of the breading with the ginger/garlic/sweet chili sauce. Our main courses we spilt the a pad thai; heat level 2, a shaking beef and a third dish I can't remember.  My only disappointment was the shaking beef, described as having a smokey crunch the beef was actually to dry and hard to chew but the sauce it was served it was tasty. I also recommend to toss your pad Thai before dining as the sauce really sinks to the bottom so although we thought heat level 2 was really light we had a tad more of a punch once we got towards the bottom. My main disappointment was the level of service. We went on a Tuesday night which we didn't expect to be busy however after we arrived they got packed and after Urvish T talked to the one employee he found out apparently they were closed last week for vacation so apparently everyone must have been trying to get their fix and because of that I'm giving it a pass. The food was well enough to convince me to come back or order for delivery from."}, {"review_id": "e7JZmt_zdVjt6YM2RV9KWQ", "user_id": "kC9fLYJKquW90cxuqH1bCg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/21/2017", "text": "I just ate at this place and I immediately felt the need to review them! Definitely a must-go-to restaurant if you're looking for Vietnamese or Thai cuisine. I'm visiting family and I was craving some Thai or pho  (basically I needed some noodles in my life) so I found this place on Yelp. This is definitely one of those places that you would never just find, as it looks like a typical, West side, corner store from the outside. But as soon as I walked in, it was packed with people and everyone looked very happy to be there.  A little about the service... everyone was definitely doing their part. No worker stood around, not even for a moment. I mean, it was pretty busy in the restaurant, and I could tell they were also accommodating many takeout orders, but they handled it! So when I say \"busy\", I mean all tables full and as soon as a table got up, other people came in to sit down. I noticed at one point there was a group that had to wait a few minutes for a table, and what looked like the manager, kept telling them just a moment. I mean, you just don't get service like that! I loved it! And when we paid I told her how much I really enjoyed this place and I'd definitely recommend it to my in town family... and of course the Yelp community!Ok, on to the good stuff... FOOD! I love pho, and as an LA resident and all-things-self-proclaimed-Asian-food connoisseur, I think I'm an ok judge of pho and as a vegan... even better (because I usually only have that one option). First thing I noticed, the labeling on the menu. Everything is labeled if it is vegan, vegetarian, or gluten free. They even have a vegetarian menu on the back with a bunch of vegan options!  We ordered egg rolls (which were vegan) and veggie pho. Both are worth going back for.  So go there!!"}, {"review_id": "czhMYhd5WAMRSvhIw8DO1g", "user_id": "BXoHP2Z2saaWp5Qotb68dw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/29/2017", "text": "I order the Pho Combination XXL, Thai Red Curry Beef, and Calamari Crispy Seafood with Ginger and Garlic.
