Plus I had a hard time grasping how a place in Mexican town would have such high remarks for bbq chicken.  In one word now having gone, GO!!Ive been to Slows, the Woodshop in Clarkston, Bad Brads, etc. you name it. The bbq chicken here is flat out superior to any of those by a country mile. I really didnt care for the dinner parts of the meal (soup, rice) but who cares the main atraction is whats its all about. My family is already excited that I plan on bringing carry out home this week as they missed out."}, {"review_id": "y9YmpkPlBt047xvoz9J-7A", "user_id": "YCAK3_gGJjzdkAAv1BuLKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Let's be honest with ourselves, when ordering any type of food that requires a selection of meat, chicken is the most common choice. Most restaurants are well aware of this and as a result put zero effort into the taste of their chicken knowing full well that chicken will be selected regardless. But this place has the BEST CHICKEN EVER. Like wow, their seasoning or marinade is soooo good. My friends mom got two chicken dinners for 6 people and it was very very good."}, {"review_id": "8dmHz7z9rr6qT3gqmPJ1kQ", "user_id": "Xnqbsqex72_KYsOk4AbqDg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "I finally made it here. The big bad taqueria with a reputation as high as the sky. Everybody knows and praises this place. From urbanites to suburbanites, this is the place to be. Or so the say.Let's start with the drinks, ordered a tecate. I usually like mine with lime and a salt rimmed glass to pour it in. I notice when they served it,, they've already squeezed a generous amount of lime juice in the mug. Did the pour, did the drink... it was pretty good! A little more limey than I prefer, but pretty good none the less.I ordered the cevice which came on a tostada. That was delish AF. Then. Then the 3 taco main event was really amazing as well. I had the lengua, birria and pastor, \"con todo por favor.\" That's how I do it and that is how I eat it.I had a great time eating and shooting the breeze with my husband here. Would I be coming back?? Heck yea!! I do want to try their barbeque options. I heard It's the bomb diggity!Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!"}, {"review_id": "3D0ISVvq6WvxFKX45AoZHw", "user_id": "WKXMC2qbfRqtMochnffcEA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "OMFG the BBQ chicken is a hyperbolic dream!  I never thought I would get so excited about chicken but the BBQ chicken here is quite literally the tastiest chicken I have ever eaten.  My friend and I couldn't stop eating it!!!  Moist, tender, and chock full of addictive subtly spicy flavor.  If Taqueria El Ray was on my way home from work I would probably stop in weekly for an $11 whole bird to feed the family.  But as it stands, I'll simply need to go back whenever convenient.Other items we tried:Ceviche Tostada - This was the other best item we ate.  Was a thick layer of perfectly flavored shrimp ceviche and was very filling for $2.Chorizo Tacos - Very good!  No complaints.  Generous portion of some pretty decent chorizo.Steak Burrito - My buddy had this and wasn't overly impressed.  Said it was good, but nothing special.Margaritas (rocks w/ salt rim) - Very tasty but light on the boozeCantaritos - Delicious fruit juice & tequila drink served in a clay mug with a tajin spice rim.  Addictive as fork, would drink again and again and again.  Perfect accompaniment to the BBQ Chicken!  You want to order one of these.  Or three.Chips & Salsa - On the house!  Nice crisp house-made chips and perfectly medium-spiced salsaBonus:  Our waitress was super friendly and helpful and even though she warned us it was going to be an hour to get our chicken it probably only took around 25 minutes.  Great atmosphere.  Would absolutely return!"}, {"review_id": "oYeah_NJBsbXP0SWbDVsIA", "user_id": "miLaQMfWVTM0KEuyZWG9Zg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "Best bbq chicken plus you can't beat that u get rice and beans w/ it!Tacos are amazing !

Veggie burrito here- EVER! I payed an extra $0.50 for cheese in my burrito and gobbled up the whole thing. The refried beans, lettuce, tomato, etc. in it were very fresh and filling. It had a great price for the size of the burrito, which was quite large. I hate it with the red chili hot sauce, which wasn't to spicy. Me and my friend ate the whole basket of chips and salsa, and I had a alcohol free sangria. Very yummy, I'm totally coming back here again.

I ended up taking sum BBQ chicken and ribs to try at home the chicken was ok a bit dry but the ribs were better, did enjoy the bbq sauce alot!

Yes, definitely bring cash because they are a cash only establishment. Tacos are $1.50 each, which isn't too bad. They are a little small, so bf and I ate 4 each (he could eat more). We got the chorizo, bistec, pastor, tripas (fried stomach). Unfortunately they didn't have their cabeza or lengua, but bf has said they were really good too. All the meats here are cooked really well and super flavorful. This is probably the first place where I liked their chorizo because it wasn't too overwhelmingly salty. Their bistec was SO JUICY. The beef was sitting in it's own juices (which made for a very messy taco) but SO GOOD. The tripas were good too - the fried aspect giving it a nice crunch texture. Pastor - can't beat the flavor (although it was slightly overcooked and drier when we had it). Loved all 3 sauces that came with the tacos and loved that they gave a bowl of radish and lime wedges. Would have loveddd to try lengua and cabeza and their bbq chicken which bf says is really good/ they're well known for.

The meat was nicely cooked, and even the corn tortilla was good. Now I will tell you, their service wasn't all that great. the restroom aren't very clean. and the restaurant can come off as 'dirty'.
