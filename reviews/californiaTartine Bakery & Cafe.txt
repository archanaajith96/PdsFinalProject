It's a pretty small sized cafe and aside from baked goods, they have a small bar as well! I came with a friend on Sunday afternoon and we had about a twenty minute wait ahead of us. We both got the bread pudding which was delicious and so so decadent -- my favorite part was most definitely the strawberries! I also got an iced coffee to go. Nothing special but I definitely needed a caffeine kick. The hard part about Tartine is that to keep the line moving, they'll ask you what you want to order before you've seen all the pastries in their glory. If you just order straight off the menu though, it's much easier. The price is as to be expected for a popular bakery in the Mission. Expensive but worth it for the novelty of their desserts. Ultimately this would be a place I'd stop by for a treat every once in awhile. Also keep in mind that if you're dining in; it's fairly crowded and slightly uncomfortable inside during a rush. There are tables outside in the fresh SF air that seemed much much more appealing to me!"}, {"review_id": "IeEoXMXAgperImOF5kWfSw", "user_id": "EF6PWDaLH8hzC5pp9Xk7KA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Came here while doing a short Saturday SF tour. There was quite a line, we waited about 30-40 mins.My friend ordered the hazelnut tart. I ordered the banana cream tart along with the morning bun. We took them home to try since we were still full. My friend says that the hazelnut tart was a bit too rich for her.I, on the other hand, thought that the banana cream tart was GREAT! The tart crust was super flakey and coated with a layer of hazelnut chocolate yet not too buttery/ oily, it matches perfectly with the banana cream. I warmed up the morning bun the next day for breakfast. Again super flakey and not too buttery. Strong cinnamon flavor with a bit of orange zest if I am correct. I would come back again for round 2 on the banana cream tart!"}, {"review_id": "ytbLaqttFUQnsCCiq9ZHog", "user_id": "fLash3in3K3_P4-jtLsKnQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Super cute bakery in the Mission with adorable pastries, cookies and delicious baguette!

To be fair, it's a very FAMOUS bougie San Francisco hipster bakery and cafe what with the number of awards and books they have out. The two cents I'm throwing into this well-known pot is that the flavors (for both the bread as well as pastries) tend to lean more towards a European profile and make. This was mostly brought to my attention by a German friend from Spain. If you have any experience living away from home or moving between or across countries, you'll probably understand how even the same dishes are skewed to fit the taste of the locals, and that it's those small things that you end up missing. For me, it was the lack of fresh, cheap, and available fruit in Indiana. In my friend's case, it's the bread. To be fair, German bread is pretty special even by European standards.When she came to the US to study, one of her major complaints (one that she claims is agreed upon by a lot of European-international students, it seems) is that American bread is generally either too sweet, too bland, or has the texture of a dish sponge. That's why her visit to Tartine was a combination of special and a relief in how familiar the taste was to her. If traveling to SF wasn't such a pain and the bread wasn't so pricey, she'd get bread from there regularly. As it is, she considers getting bread from there an occasional treat.It's the same with my brother. The thing is, he HATES sourdough bread. He's had it before at multiple other local bakeries, but he can't stand the taste. Then apparently eating Tartine's sourdough was a revelation of \"holy SHIT, THIS is what sourdough is suppose to taste like?!\". So now the only time we can get him to eat sourdough now is if we get a loaf of it from Tartine. Actually, the last time my mom and brother went up to SF, they visited Tartine and my brother ate the two loaves of sourdough that got in the hour it took for them to drive home.(And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why I torment my brother. Because he is a bread-hog.)That both Tartine's bread and pastries tend to be less sweet than the baked goods of an average American bakery is something I noticed as well. Of the pastries I tried, their lemon tart is more tart than sweet, the chocolate souffle cake was rich with a bitterness to balance out the sweetness (I was actually able to eat all of it, which happens rarely even with my sweet tooth), and the almond rocher was ultimately more of a nutty flavor. So I guess that's a thing to note when you to try Tartine's stuff.Truthfully, a lot of why I'm giving Tartine four stars is because my family loves it so much and we somehow always manage to get into the store JUST as they're putting out a new tray of what we want. Considering the lines are always around 45 to 75 minutes long, it's a small miracle each effin' time. All things said, it's pretty satisfying to get a few loaves of their baguettes and sesame loaves. My mother is in love with their croissants, which are just IN GENERAL popular items among the AMC (Asian Mommy Committee, THAT GROUP of gossiping Asian moms and aunties). Actually, mother dearest is pretty determined to try out every type of croissant they have. Meanwhile, my dad's not allowed to eat carbs, so his opinions count for nothing hereTartine Bakery and Cafe is designed to be a neighborhood, hole-in-the-wall place. Unfortunately, they're too popular. It's probably safe to say at his point that it's quite the tourist trap on the weekends. They have a number of tables and chairs inside, but it gets very crowded and cramped among all the parties squeezed together for a seat while trying to keep out of the way of the winding line. I noticed it was pretty noisy as well. Not quite ideal place to set up shop for work or for a sit down chat with friends/family. If anything, you might want to try the Tartine Manufactory, which is more of a sit-down restaurant with the bread and a more extensive menu for a sit-down meal.I can't say for how it is on the weekDAY though, but supposedly it's much less crowded. Apparently one of the my local AMC members and her family managed to get there with the early crowd BEFORE the large Saturday line started by getting there just before Tartine's opening time and waiting for the doors to open. For sure though, they have an 45 minute to an hour long line anywhere between 11AM and 3PM on Saturday AND Sunday. Additionally, there's only really street parking around, and we've circled entire surrounding blocks until we get lucky.If you end up going, you're probably going to have to deal with the lines. And, in all honesty, good luck! You might want to try talking to the people in line with you. Most people we ended up waiting with were pretty  amiable, and we all kinda bonded over the mutual excitement and exasperation with the lines. It might make the wait easier."}, {"review_id": "hkxThdzDse3jngnKfYfnHQ", "user_id": "fepLYIihV-Z1lD7l1Z9GLg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "Every seasoned Yelper dreads when this happens.

The banana cream pie crust tasted bitter/burned so I didn't eat it. I ate the bananas and the whipped cream. The lemon bar was all tang, no sweet and \"wet\" not a thick gel like you'd expect from a great tangy but sweet lemon bar. I took a bite and threw this away. The chocolate chip cookie was bad. It was so thin, hard,  and tasted burned! I love a crispy cookie - but not one so tough I feel like my teeth will shatter trying to bite into it.The morning bun was mediocre at best.

I can only speak for the morning bun and quiche as my croissant is tucked away in my to-go luggage for the time being, but I'd say this spot is a cut above NYC bakeries and on par with some of the better ones in Paris. (As evidenced by my earlier encounter at their Manufactory, it's more interesting that they can go head-to-head with great German breakmakers. A far more intriguing category in my opinion.)The quiche filling was fluffy in the extreme but I found the crust a little dry.

When I arrived with a friend around 3pm on a Saturday we waited for around 15-20 mins before ordering.On today's visit we ordered a lemon cream tart and banana cream tart.The lemon cream tart had a delicious sweet and tangy filling that was beyond satisfying. I'm a huge fan of citrus flavors and loved that this filling packed a refreshing punch, and didn't taste artificial at all. The crust was a little hard, but very buttery and paired well with the sweet/tart inside.I personally really dislike bananas, so I'll have to go off my friend's review of the banana cream tart. She said that she loved the rich flavor of the filling, and how the cream allowed the banana flavor to shine through. The baked goods are definitely quality items and worth the try if you're in the area!

After a few Irish coffees at the BV we decided to Uber over. Expect to wait in line. It's a tiny little corner store with the line going down the block. I almost never give 5 stars and this place earned it...I own a few of their cookbooks, which are not for beginners. They are however quite informative and beautiful. So even if you don't use them they look great on your shelf.We bought two pastries, a croissant and a savory scone. The croissant was everything I look for and more. Moist flaky and buttery. Quite possibly the best croissant I've ever had! My wife says the ones we got in Hawaii at the kona coffee shop were better but she's nuts!The scone was good. Better than average but with the croissant doing the happy dance in my mouth it was a tough act to follow. Cappuccinos were bomb. The seem to have a legit coffee program going on as well.I also really liked the doodle art in the bathroom!I bought a baguette to take with me and didn't get into until later that night.

Server behind the counter was rushed but still respectful.The short review is that the tarts are truly terrific and worth the wait for trying them out once. I really liked the frangipane tart. It has a great balance of sweetness and crunchiness that is hard to come by in other tarts. The roasted coconut tart was sweet without being too sweet.
