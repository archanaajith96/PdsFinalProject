What more could you ask for from a place serving up different variations of classic Peruvian dishes? Order yourself a crispy Milanesa Sandwich or a juicy Chicharrón sandwich at the counter and then swing by the drinks and grab a yourself a classic Chicha Morada. Don't know what these things are? ¡No problemo! Each item on the menu has detailed descriptions and some are even shown in photos. After recently spending a number of weeks in Peru myself, this was the place to reignite those memories.Do yourself a favor and check out food from a part of the world you've probably never tried!"}, {"review_id": "PR334i513bSZFdUV5ckgkg", "user_id": "ds-C9AXGATTmvsCEWCqmZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "I stopped here on my way to the library after work one cold weekday evening.It's a small place in a strip mall, but has some seating inside. The guy at the counter explained a few things on the menu which was helpful. They have several super authentic Peruvian items, some of which are rotated based on what day it is.I opted for a large butifarra sandwich with the side salad. My sandwich was really two smaller sandwiches, but still a very large portion. The side salad was amazing, it was quinoa with a bunch of very finely chopped veggies and had a nice flavor to it, I would order the salad by itself. The sandwich was amazing as well! The meat was tender, the rest of the toppings worked really well together, and the flavors were very different, but in the best way possible. Extremely surprised at how great and unique SanguChe is. I really can't think of anywhere like it, maybe Cafecito in the city, but still not entirely the same thing and this might be better than Cafecito. The only drawback is the price, it is a little on the expensive side especially for lunch, but if you're looking for something really flavorful and unique on the far west end of Naperville, I would highly recommend SanguChe.Will be back!"}, {"review_id": "RcaWINqsbgl2-JkBOq5cRg", "user_id": "p4Z-oZv8zJdeyNDXa1HsuQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "We come from the city just to have lunch here and it is beyond worth it! First I have had everything on the menu and it's all amazing but my rank is 1. Chicharron 2. Milanesa 3. Aji de gallina. The Chiha Morada are meat stuffed potato balls and amazing. Empanada are one of my favorite. They also make a great side salad for lunch. Super unique taste that deserves a better review than I will be able to give! Can also go health and have the sandwich served on the side and drop the bread. Quinoa side also needs some love! Try it!And as for the picture... we get to excited by the time we get here to get before pics sooo sorry about that"}, {"review_id": "Ika8vxycscSo2oNvNIVmNg", "user_id": "B9FpbRp4rgldjAw2BwLGcg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "What could I possibly add that close to 300 people have not said already?Great quality products.Hand crafted by the owner.Sandwiches only.Nothing fancy about the dining room.The napkins are flimsy."}, {"review_id": "puMc3OiR1naqR6Asujk8JA", "user_id": "Feeru_eQ-52TnZn8DNhmjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Ethnic food in Naperville finally!!

Aurora near the Train Station.  It's an open restaurant with a food prep and counter area for ordering.  Not fancy, but clean.  You're not sure if it's self serve or not, and it is and isn't.  One thing for sure is their staff is super friendly and helpful.  What is Peruvian food? Here's the restaurants take on the question from their website:\"Peruvian food is only some of the BEST food on the planet. We may be slightly biased, but check this out: Peru is one of the most bio-diverse countries in the world. It has 84 of the 103 ecosystems on our planet.That means that the Peruvian pantry is choc full of a variety of foods coming from the rainforests, mountains, the lowlands and abundant fisheries.With such an exotic mix of ingredients to choose from, now add several layers of cultures and their recipes developed over 100s of years - the Inca Natives, the Spanish Conquistadors, the European Immigrants, the African Slaves, the Chinese and Japanese Refugees.With a mix of delicious foods and influences from around the world, Peruvian food offers a very unique blend of flavors and combinations that we've committed to share with you.\"We'll probably agree that we each have our own view points, eh?  I had the \"Seco de Carne\", which is slices of pot roasted beef slowly stewed in garlic, onion, bell pepper, peas, carrots and cilantro. Served on a French Roll with garden veggie aioli, scallions, and a bit of fried yuca for crunch.  So, when THEY say \"french fries\" it's yuca fries.  Yuca is a root vegetable similar to the potato except Yuca has a waxier skin,  Yuca is widely used in South and Central America.  This sandwich was out of this world! Just my cup of Coca.  I asked the staff about the sauce which they described as a \"sweet chili sauce\", and Virginia's Lomo Saltado had the same sauce.  We opted for salad instead of more fries, and this is not your garden variety looking salad.  It;s a small bowl of Quinoa, beans and other vegetables, chilled...the perfect match for my sandwich.  Great food, exceptional service.  The restaurant already had great reviews, and now we know why?  We'll be back soon."}, {"review_id": "c5R-PSHIxEJ2jLSA-MOTvA", "user_id": "P90tsjXtgIIcmhslu8CWsg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Had the pollo Ambulante sandwich  & owner suggested I go with the Yucca fries which I don't regret for a second!

Atmosphere: i love the authentic Peruvian music playing and place looks like it could get pretty cool during lunch time and on weekends.Decor: the pictures on the wall are awesome and makes feel at home. It makes you want to see a place like this succeed. A little more update to the place would elevate it to the next level. For example, better looking water and chica morada fountain, USB outlets to charge, and higher quality printout pictures. Menu board is awesome and its always great to see the kitchen at work while you visit a place. Napkins can be better as they are very cheap. Also real dishes and utensils would be better to the environment.Food: Lomo saltado sandwich took me to places I have never been before. It looks like it may be too much heavy but let me tell you the lightly toasted warm bread makes a HUGE difference vs other sandwich restaurants. The fries are homemade while the sauce, onions, and beef are packed with the right amount flavor. Fresh chicha morada was good, but maybe it needed a tad more lime to hit the spot. I still drank every drop. The chicken empanada came fresh out of the oven so timing couldnt have been better. If you have ever had empanadas before then you know you always feel robbed after you bite into it and notice empty holes inside the empanada. Not this one, every section inside the empanada was filled with onions, chicken, egg, and right amount of texture. Quinoa salad side doesnt look that appetizing but let me tell you it was delicious. It had the right amount of citrus flavors mixed in which made me want to lick every single part of the bowl. The beans from Plato Del Jefe were so good that I also ate it all and wanted more. The home made spicy red sauce was better than any hot sauce out there but not something for your not so every day spicy food lovers as it could be too much. The alfajor was tasty but I have had better. It needed a little more majablanco and powder sugar. Service: Ceasar(Owner) was extremely friendly and very approachable. I was surprised he brought the food to my table which was great service. His story on how he started makes you want to keep coming to SanguChe to see him succeed. His Peruvian sandwich concept is great but makes this place a five star place is the amount of flavor each of his dishes have. You can tell there is passion into his food. Best Peruvian food in the United States. I will make sure to come back to this place when I am back in Chicago area."}, {"review_id": "aKFL8UqSH88jyXQzyBjxnw", "user_id": "u8RuD48X5tTuXQYzGusjVg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "Omg, what a great hidden gem in Naperville!
