Even better than Sushi Sasa. It's expensive and so, so worth it. Their sashimi is top notch and server was well versed on everything in the menu. They have sake flights and Japanese whiskey flights. Their sushi dinner menu includes a basic salad that my friends only picked at - the fish had all of our attention!Decor is gorgeous, bathrooms are elegant (but I will mention that their sink faucets are rather phallic and feels like it's spewing right at you). The street that it's on is adorable and lots of fairy lights surround the area."}, {"review_id": "vXfLv10k18cy1u8yfgsqxQ", "user_id": "X1CXkpWUd0hsOSkbgQEExQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I used to love this place. I still like the food, but we had really poor service last time I went, which truly changed Sushi Den in my opinion. We felt like we were inconveniencing our server when we asked for water, food, and the check, although we were quite certain that none of those would have arrived if we hadn't begged for them. I had planned on ordering a drink, but was never given the opportunity. The bright side to this is that I saved money, but a drink would have been nice. The past few times I've been they were out of several sushi rolls. Some menus were updated and others were not. When you're a nice restaurant and you're out of something for several months, it's probably time to update the menus. Apart from the poor service and old menus, the food was good, but I don't think we'll be back for a while."}, {"review_id": "L7ZUOSomA_g_x_R9lYSAzw", "user_id": "62FP9jWP1J9KzRa2yp4i1g", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Very disappointed with food quality. I went for happy hour and sat at table. I had sushi including popular miso black cod. Sushi was very low quality and it was worst than takeout from supermarkets. Miso black cod was undercooked. Raw fish was not fresh at all seaweed (nori) was all soggy. I been to many sushi restaurants but this was most disappointing place I ever been to. Sushi bar maybe better option but I have sat at table at  other sushi restaurants and sushi was much fresher. I think review here is all bloated or perhaps it maybe they ran out of fresh fishes or serve low quality during happy hour. I am definitely not going to trust Yelp for its review.Lesson learned- never order all dishes at one time. Order one dish you like,  and if food is bad, just walk out. Not worth it to waste your money and time. And avoid large establishment especially for sushi restaurant, food tends to be soggy and less fresh if not served quickly."}, {"review_id": "Tlh3181wwKdX51wR2zZjSQ", "user_id": "9bZLIEwZsUP262-3bOEsnA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Sushi in Colorado? We're probably all thinking the same thing. Is it fresh?The answer is yes! The locals all said that there's no where better to grab sushi than from Sushi Den. It's a little expensive and can get crazy crowded, but it's the best. Well, they were right about everything. My mom and I came in right as they were opening. This is definitely the best time to come. They don't take reservations so it is all walk in. By the time we left, there was a long wait. During the colder my months, you don't want to get stuck outside without a reservation so I highly recommend coming early! We ordered a bunch of different dishes. I tried a few rolls along with some appetizers like gyoza. My mom decided to do the omakase. You can give some of your preferences to the chef and he'll continue to prepare plates for you until you say stop. I tried some of the things that came out for her including sashimi dishes and a deliciously soft cooked butterfish. I have to say that one of my favorite things that came out was the tsukemono. It was made in house and was so good. I always love the pickled garlics and it was just so fresh and tasty! I'm used to getting the packaged ones that are sitting in the pickling for a long time, so this was very refreshing. We had a really great experience here and truly enjoyed the food! It was good. The sushi chefs were from Japan and you could tell that the fish was fresh and of high quality."}, {"review_id": "8R9pMrl7ZinxwYS32FG6Yg", "user_id": "RKPkxOYQlM0BjhM-H6_vAw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Super fun, hip sushi restaurant with an excellent selection of fresh sushi each day from both local and Japanese markets. I was impressed with my sushi chef who was happy to serve me a couple pieces at a time, versus sending a deluge of fish which would throw off the rice temp, etc. I was also impressed they have fresh wasabi, which they grated on demand.I opted for a selection of sashimi and nigiri that was fresh in that day. Here's a run down. I snapped photos of most items. I enjoyed that my sushi chef paced the items with aplomb and added a garnish here or there. They're served edomae style so the wasabi and soy sauce (or yuzu) is already applied. Leave it to the chef!- They serve you a complimentary cucumber salad with your wasabi. (Heads up the standard wasabi is quite poor quality, I'd recommending upgrading)- Edamame - good, freshly salted. Served warm- Toro from Croatia + Aoyagi clam from Boston - loved this compelling sashimi opener. The clam was a real winner with a nice texture and freshness to it- Hamachi kama - Awesome kama from Japan. I like that they serve it traditionally with the radish and ponzu dipping sauce. Grilled perfectly with a fleshly, soft interior and crisp outer portion. Bonus hijiki salad to cleanse the palate- King Salmon nigiri from New Zealand - I'm American so I love a good salmon. This is where I noticed they have a warm, soft pillowy rice. Not very vinegary. They serve a touch of wasabi on the underside of the fish, which is classic- Ankimo nigiri from Boston - very good steamed ankimo. I enjoyed the nigiri presentation with grated ginger and onion- Hotate (scallop) from Boston - outstanding, still alive upon serving- Kanpachi from Hawaii - very in vogue right now- Ikura and Hokkaido Uni - uni was good, maybe not mind blowing and the ikura was just okay. I opted for this even though it was not on the specials menu, which was maybe a bad sign- Kurodai from Greece - interesting selection. I'm unused to so many fish from Eastern European waters but it worked and the dressing brought it up a notch. I had initially opted for aji from Japan but they were out- Aburi Toro - they're really into grilled nigiri. They use a real grill, which I prefer to the blow-torch method which otherwise can leave a butane aftertaste. I forgot to mention this piece is mindblowing- Aburi Salmon Toro - Chef's choice. Smart one. A fan favorite here with good reason- Unagi with eel sauce and house-made Tamago - Unagi was well sauced and buttery, and the tamago was well done if not the most sophisticated. It was sweet without being overly so. Nicely layered but not quite as complex as I like- I opted for one more bit a negi-toro handroll with scallions. This is served rather large for me, but was nonetheless outstanding due to the quality of the fish and the crisp nori- My chef served a complimentary orange, which hit the spot for me who likes to err on the healthy sideSo, overall, an excellent time. Largeish portions for a Japanese restaurant, but that seems to be a Denver thing. Everything was well paced and service was adequate if not quite present enough. There's a ton of potential to be 5 stars, but since I'm an aficionado I have to dock a star for a few things. My plates were often left un-cleared, which became slightly embarrassing at times. The standard wasabi needs to be upgraded. A few of the items were not all star, so compared to the super high end, this is very good, but as an overall experience it's excellent."}, {"review_id": "f1jF5v-zDSexnUZJ_FwmvQ", "user_id": "O-ljHSMS2LTaN_Tg9kJGmQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "We ate here for a Chef's table dinner a couple of weeks ago, and this was one of the most fantastic and cultured culinary experiences I've had thus far in Denver! If you're looking for a spot to celebrate an anniversary, a special occasion, or just need a nice night out with amazing food, then this is your event.There are between 6-10 seats for each chef's table seating (they happen monthly), and the chef whips up delicious and artfully done sushi right in front of you.

Crisp tempura, fresh fish, and sticky rice added up to a top notch quality dining experience. It's definitely the best sushi I've had in Denver so far and I'd be surprised if any other restaurant can top this one. Now on to the drinks! If you enjoy sake at all, I am politely ordering you to order the sake flight. Three completely different sakes, three completely different flavor profiles and one super satisfied me. You too, can feel this way if you choose to order the flight. If there's a wait before getting a table, I also recommend spending some time at the bar. They have a very nice rose that's worth splitting a bottle. That being said, service was a little bit wonky. Our server didn't write down our order and forgot half of it. He came back to ask what it was again but then forgot part of the other half he thought he remembered. There's definitely room for improvement there. All in all, be prepared to wait for your table but once you get there, you'll get the goods delivered."}, {"review_id": "VZ2hngViS-msXWpyzGTCog", "user_id": "37zVzs_gnw3jgHVACGI-NA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Fantastic sushi. Some of the best I've ever had. Honestly, I was skeptical to \"waste\" a meal in Denver on sushi when I live in Seattle. Boy am I glad I did. The only thing I didn't love were the Sriracha-Garlic Shrimp. They were nothing to write home about... and the potatoes that came with it were strange. The rolls were fantastic and large. But the main attraction was the sushi. The fresh fish flown in daily from Japan was out of this world. The selections change nightly, but it was a great mix of delicious classics and super unique fishes I had to google. The top part of the menu had a section of raw fish with different marinades. Every single one of those options were unique and tasty. (We came with a group and ordered a handful). Anyways- if you're a sushi fan, hit up Sushi Den ASAP. :)"}, {"review_id": "1R0pHpoy6wfo6dh8cl7QSA", "user_id": "zu73-hVFiSSFMbze5Pjk7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Delicious sushi.

There's really no other place like it. Everything is always great in quality but the price is there to justify it as well. I would typically recommend this place for sushi lovers, but I have noticed that they're starting to cater to a wider... more Americanized audience of sushi eaters. If all you're interested in are vegetarian options or California roll-like sushi, I highly recommend going elsewhere so that you don't waste your money here. However, if you're looking for fresh cuts of wild toro shipped in around the world the morning of, then this is your place.In general, great place to go for high quality sushi, but only if you actually know what you're ordering/interested in more authentic sushi.

If I'm feeling the other end of the spectrum, I'll get a bunch of nigiri: tuna and salmon. That's it. Just give me the fish. For dessert the obvious choice is the pineapple upside down cake with lychee ice cream. Ask your server to sub lychee for vanilla. Don't park directly in front of the restaurant where the valet is.
