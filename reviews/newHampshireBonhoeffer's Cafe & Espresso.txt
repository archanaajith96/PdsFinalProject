The atmosphere is wonderful and the giant fireplace gives off a cozy warm and welcoming feeling. The food is reasonably priced as I have gone to other places where it is much more expensive. My favorite part of all this though was their crepes! What a pleasant surprise to find that they had one of my favorite foods! I did not buy any coffee but from their website it seems that the profits go to different causes such as stopping human trafficking. This is another wonderful thing. I will most definitely be making this one of my regular spots now!"}, {"review_id": "SfO2AWRUdiH3iimZE8AvSQ", "user_id": "pUBAIMoRTWRMxKh-ys4Beg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I love the interior especially the fireplace! The tea and coffee selection is wonderful! The crepes were delicious and flavorful. We tried a breakfast burrito and a lemon with blueberry crepe. We also split a bagel with cream cheese. No complaints about this place and I will be back.

The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, the open space and leather arm chairs was the refuge I desperately needed!Simple things, espresso shot (not too much caffeine, I needed to go to bed and rest) with a wild berry smoothie and apple bread.Eating this simple meal and drinking, I could relax and reflect, and just soak in the milieu of this café. It was a welcome reprieve. Coffee is delicious by the way."}, {"review_id": "_Fo4G25NBHTIp2PaU-Iqjg", "user_id": "8pU7Mv3d9D0pbjrNkYzBpg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/4/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Cozy. Close. Crepes. High mill ceilings with a massive hearth/fireplace. Delicious hand-made crepes, quiches, & caffeinated concoctions. Hansel and Gretel nibbling away at gingerbread cookies in the corner. What nearby musically-inclined, uber-barista'd Riverwalk lacks in space and breakfast variety Bonhoeffers delivers in spades. Parking's a pain and seating largely of the barstool variety, but there's simply no better place to sip a warm coffee than this ski lodge-esque community coffee house with a distinctly German twist right off downtown Nashua's Main Street strip. Note: big sofa chair space is not large but lots of tables keep things accessible even in busy lunch rushes. Come for the coffee + crepes, stay for the  fire + ambiance."}, {"review_id": "GLJu6D5T2IHDDmwN-Rns1A", "user_id": "PckAOuqKWnIB4HbztMUOeQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/13/2017", "text": "This is a great place to stop for a cappuccino and pastry in the morning.

It's my number one favorite café, I love all the staff. I would recommend this coffee shop to everyone, especially if you love espresso.

Another plus, they have affogato (ice cream topped with expresso). Perfect combo for a coffee and dessert lover.  Try this place. You won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "Bwmpm442BvjV6iOEz14RZg", "user_id": "MHPD66HZ634zT3PiFUt3cQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/9/2017", "text": "Cup of love.

I have been there twice now and both times, everything has come out sporadically. I originally found this place through the Find Me Gluten Free app. They do offer GF bagels and they have GF quiche. Both times I have been here, the counterperson seems very uneducated regarding gluten allergy. She never advised me on other GF products or asked if I had an actual allergy so I had to ask her if each item I was ordering contained any gluten byproducts. We ordered a few things, including bagels, the spinach quiche, two lattes, and my husband got a cinnamon roll crepe. It took longer for the drinks to come out than the bagels and crepe so we ended up finishing our food before we even got drinks. Overall, the food was pretty good but the gluten free bagels seemed under toasted. I like the aesthetic of the place because it's a cute place to hang out. But if you are in any kind of rush, I would avoid it."}, {"review_id": "hdhriVmSHLY0gtYATl-12Q", "user_id": "FxDd259kv0UyB7nVtUnirg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/3/2016", "text": "Great menu and space with a friendly staff.  Wish they were open on Sundays!"}, {"review_id": "dL1FewgzEY46Z3bMSeM2ZQ", "user_id": "mgnnjy75cidkraM7rv0FtQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/30/2017", "text": "The food is good, the coffee is good, it has a great atmosphere.

A handful of professionals divided into pairs and singles nibbled on pastries and engaged in conversation. It was still early and the barista softly greeted me with a smile.

I had the Banana Foster crepes and my mom got the Strawberries and Creme crepes. They were both delicious, we really liked the taste of the crepe itself it was fresh and flavorful. The reason I'm only giving them two stars is because the staff was just not friendly at all.  At first I thought it was probably because I walked in with my 18 month son and most people there seemed to be working remotely so they probably thought my son would disturb the other customers, but then I noticed they all seemed to be in a horrible mood, I did not see them smile once or greet anyone. We picked up our plates to put them in the cart like they ask to do and one of the workers was standing next to it making us feel like we were in her way when we were actually doing them a favor. Next time I'll go to the Riverwalk cafe which has a more friendly and courteous staff and better atmosphere."}, {"review_id": "q2TrS8jwEcd10TA9dl2Uzw", "user_id": "mGYuXLuDuSig3hRO_3Db9w", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/29/2016", "text": "I'm sad.  I liked this place.  It has good food, excellent coffee, and with one exception, fine service.  However, I no longer feel comfortable here.The problem is one apparently senior member of the team who dealt poorly with a request I made when I was in a hurry.  She wouldn't meet my needs or specify any way to do so within a reasonable timeframe.I'm a long-time, frequent customer and a good tipper, and while I don't expect to buy goodwill that way, it'd be nice if an absence of passive ill will were purchasable at some published price.I'll miss their crepes, their fireplace, their armchairs, and most of all the good people on their staff...but until that one problem person is gone, I don't want to go there."}, {"review_id": "CFzV1XlTj65MCo8ui6dMHQ", "user_id": "ORxpN62Xjm_T2yAhge2Hdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2017", "text": "1.
