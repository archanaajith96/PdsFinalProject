We got there at 9:30 on Thursday morning, so they had their weekday breakfast menu  available. The weekday breakfast menu is a lot smaller than the weekend brunch menu. It only has a few options, but they were all yummy.The house made granola is super yummy. It has sesame seeds which was an unexpected flavor, but I liked it. I had them substitute the yogurt for almond milk, and the granola had fresh blueberries and strawberries in it as well. The ham and cheese croissant was alright. The cheddar cheese was a little too sharp for my taste. Also, definitely order it with an egg inside because it was a little boring by itself. The scramble of the day was spinach, chèvre, and bacon. It was super good, but it was a pretty small serving (I would guess just two small eggs). It came with their delicious toasted baguette and homemade fresh strawberry jam."}, {"review_id": "h7ne-_a7idlZJ_NL_APFgA", "user_id": "7FpIGmlgLiFLbLf3V_A21g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Visited once and wouldn't go back.

A little more on the pricey side but for sure worth it! Love to stop by and have a coffee and a snack or Caesar salad with chicken!

From the moment you walk inside to order, to the second you take your first bite. When it's warm you can sit inside or out and it feels like you are truly in a french bistro. They have free wifi and don't care how long you sit there. They have food, coffee and gelato. We were there both times we were in town and I had the chop salad both times. It is truly the best chop salad I have ever had. Perfect portion, priced decently and oh so delicious. I wish this place would follow me around."}, {"review_id": "rsHhM5e91izLP3cXMo9AaA", "user_id": "dKCEIzXWKjQoorZ4R6PBvg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/4/2017", "text": "Ok this is not what I was expecting! I wish we had not had breakfast at the hotel because the food looked amazing. Next time we are in town we are hitting them up for brunch for sure. What we did get was excellent. My husband had cold brew. I had a mocha. It was hands down the best I have ever had. They make the chocolate syrup in house with cocoa powder and it shows in the flavor. It was chocolatey without being cloyingly sweet and killing the espresso flavor. I also like that they give you a choice of different espressos. I saw this at Black Coffee Roasters too. I would think that being from Seattle I would see places that give an option for which espresso to use, but this is new to me. Overall great experience."}, {"review_id": "C8bMW0RuY0iKR1qZsM5LoQ", "user_id": "0XHnik9Qpj68dYCp76fR3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/25/2017", "text": "Is this real life?! Am I in Missoula, MT or Italy?! Every dining experience here I am blown away by. Fresh, beautiful, cohesive ingredients that come together in a symphony of flavor. Yeah I just wrote that, because that's how I feel with every bite.*Cue the eye rollers.*Menu is continuously changing which I love because you know, options are always welcomed. Not only do I love lunch and dinner here but we came for their Valentine's Day Prix Fix meal.Now we never do Prix Fix dinners for good reason. It's overpriced, it sometimes lacks creativity and it's always super small bites. But Caffe Dolce came through with a delicious meal and beautiful evening out. We felt for the portions it was a tad overpriced, but when you breakdown the ingredients used and the presentation of each dish it was totally worth it. Did I mention the wine pairings were on point?! I could keep going pouring my heart out for Caffe Dolce but just take my word for it and go. Go now. Enjoy an evening of good food and good wine.

Love the Italian gelato bar. Their food is great actually, pastas and mains are always worth the price. Where this place suffers is service and wine prices.I've been into Caffe Dolce a few times, but the last two times we have had a waitress who knew very little about the menu (different waitress each time), when asked to describe a dish she couldn't. Both times I've ordered a glass of expensive wine and been given a 2-3oz pour for $15+. Both times I have had to ask for a full pour, which is really embarrassing to ask at a restaurant without sounding cheap (the second time I just switched to a beer to avoid getting another low pour). But when you pay that much for a glass of wine, you should be treated to a full glass. I think in the future I will bring my own wine in and pay corkage, or buy a full bottle off the menu (rates more reasonable)."}, {"review_id": "0OGMfgvxRs1hMC4ce6IZ-g", "user_id": "5lN5Ubgp9h67ozlXgyYjiw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/19/2017", "text": "Angry blue haired tattoo waitress could have broke a smile as I paid $18 for a sandwich and juice.

My girlfriend is gluten free and loved their veggie sandwich, I even liked the gluten free bread. Excellent coffee. Top notch Americano. The lamb burger was stellar! Lots of pork, which I don't eat so it lost a star there because almost the entire menu has bacon, which other people will love I'm sure.  The decor is amazing! Beautiful Italian mosaic work on the floor.  Really high ceiling, with painting on it like you're in an old chapel.  It can get really busy and hard to get a table.  Not an inexpensive place to eat, but quality is worth paying for.  They have a neat room full of old ceramic dish ware where you can eat, not what I'd want in my house, but a novel and enjoyable aesthetic to eat around."}, {"review_id": "PKu_iIDGqzKgcnQdUPeAHw", "user_id": "R0iRcw42q7FYuz1ABdfe7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/10/2017", "text": "Cool space, friendly service.

Especially if you are there for dinner. I think I had the best pasta and pizza there, and the next two times I went back there, the pizza was room temperature and rock hard...and so was the pasta that had been so perfect before. The breakfast (egg sandwiches) there are also hit and miss, but the salads and sandwiches and soups are the best bet at Cafe Dolce. Their in house pastries are out of this world: the pistachio layer cake, the chocolate mousse, and the custard berry tart are all wonderful, just like their gelato selections like strachiatella and seasonal Dixon melon. The mall location has good pastries from Petit Autre bakery as well."}, {"review_id": "LHPFc9QMHkx5_gcnhryoUw", "user_id": "5c9qNzpKvn2-7Mh2Mizi4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2017", "text": "This place is pure class!
