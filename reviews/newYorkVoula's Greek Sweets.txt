This is one of my go to spots for vegan brunch! There's nowhere else like it in the Roc. Consistently great service and food. My weekly check-ins support it! Hahaha. I got one of their combos including vegan gyro meat and was a complete pleasure to the senses. Service: I ordered take out but the front of house staff was friendly and attentive and I was able to order and get my food within 15 minutes which is awesome. Food: I ordered their Horiatiki salad ($9), spanakopita ($6), and baklava ($3.50). Everything was delicious! The salad was a mixture of chopped cucumber, tomato, onions, olives, and huge chunks of delicious feta. I think the price is high for what it is but it is delicious and a nice size. The spanakopita was incredibly flavorful and flaky with a nice fresh flavor. It was filling without being heavy. I ended my meal with the baklava which was TO DIE FOR and you must order that if you go. Ambience: While I waited for my food I could see patrons enjoying their meal in their quaint dining area tastefully decorated with Greek flags and tchotchkes. Very cute inside! I love going here for fresh tasting vegan/vegetarian Mediterranean food."}, {"review_id": "Y1D63GiMCfit3smh4m6bnw", "user_id": "rMgHovIE-cu9qOdhMuF6HQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "I've lived in Rochester for years and years and it's shameful it's taken me so long to try Voulas's. Maybe it's the obscure location in an alley, or the no meat thing...I've just never been motivated to come here.I've been missing out...brunch here on Sunday was amazing...so so good. We showed up primetime I guess around 1pm and the place was packed, waited 15mins for a table. But it was worth it. I went with the Gythios plate and I am a skeptic about eggs and lentils together no more. The lentils are so savory and earthy and steeped in flavor that they more then compensate for salty bacon/sausage/typical bfast meats.  The lemon potatoes were great, if not a bit salty, and the crostini was crisp and fresh tasting. Also tried their daily special a pizza with broccoli rabe, eggs, and some other stuff. Didn't care for it as much as the gythios, but still good nonetheless.Don't think about leaving with out picking up dessert to go from the case. The cookies I got were bakery fresh, and almost everything they serve is made in house. The staff/hostess/waitresses were all so warm and had genuine smiles. Yes a genuine smile on a food server...crazy!Only thing I wish I'd known: it is tiny...8 tables at most and the waiting area is cramped if your'e waiting for a table. The crowd lightened up later in the afternoon, but if you are the impatient type and not open to waiting in a cramped space for a table for brunch, Id go here during off peak hours and not with a huge crowd"}, {"review_id": "5ipR0gHVeI6lTWl-ZLAYiw", "user_id": "Te2F4roniraVwRI6ZJjysA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/15/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Great food, staff, service....first choice, when going out.

I've been eating there for a few years. But I'm pretty disappointed with my experience the other day. I came in just after a lunch rush for a take out order and the staff was playing catch-up, which I understand. What I don't understand is why I had to wait 40 minutes for a pizza and lemon potatoes. Having dined there many times ordering the pizza I know it doesn't take 40 minutes to make. When asking the server how much longer I needed to wait, she said 3 minutes. No apology or explanation for the unnecessary long wait. If people who ordered their food after me got their food before me, that's messed up... I'm definitely coming back because I love Voula's. I just hope next time I don't leave unhappy for a small mistake someone easily could've remedied"}, {"review_id": "cKZ-_OsnyG-MkjktFRqlcg", "user_id": "tQFuvLo0mxhwzzI8xDdSqQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "What an awesome hidden gem! I have been to so many restaurants on Monroe and had no idea that Voula's was right there, tucked back in an alley. The food was wonderful for the price and patrons seem to enjoy the bright and eclectic atmosphere. I had their spanakopita with a salad, tzaziki, and the lemon potatoes. I also took some baklava to go! I wasn't expecting much from the potatoes, as they are definitely not one of my preferred sides, however these were amazing!!! The spanakopita was good. My friend and I had some coffee and almond milk, as well. The service was prompt and it was nice that they can make so many things vegan/vegetarian."}, {"review_id": "cyR1zTg0eCbgAdyoTHbxlQ", "user_id": "wnFT19UHrlwTqx4U0WJyCg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/6/2017", "text": "Maybe I've read too many reviews, because I expected to be totally blown away by Voula's. It was good but not spectacular. The ambiance was charming, with cafe style seating and mismatched plates and cups. It's small and the parking is limited (avoid going with a group unless you want to wait). Parties of two were getting in quickly on a Sunday, but our party of four waited a while. The staff was friendly and provided us with coffee and menus while we waited. The lentil soup was good, but I thought it was over spiced - and I normally enjoy spicy! The lemon potatoes lived up to the hype and were more to my liking. I tried some of my husband's spanakopita, which was delicious, as was the Blueberry Saligaria pastry. I'd like to come back to try their pizza special or one of the other brunch options, like the French toast. This would be a unique place to take out of towners for lunch, or to stop in just for dessert. Portions are filling and I ended up taking most of my potatoes home. Props to Voula's for a sustainable cardboard takeout container!My biggest issue was that they had no sugar substitute for my coffee. Come on, really? I can get over bringing stevia with me to mom and pop diners, but I feel like a hip restaurant like this should have the option, especially as many vegans and vegetarians are health conscious and may want to (or need to) limit their sugar intake.I also wish I had paid attention to reviews that advised that they only take cash for tips. The four of us scrounged our wallets for dollar bills to come up with a tip, so that'll be something to try to keep in mind for next time."}, {"review_id": "8Xrn1eEq0Gy3bqDb_B8N5A", "user_id": "ehb7SPb41mD31zrU8_3zkA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/8/2017", "text": "Third time going to this place and I can't say enough.

I HATE citrus in my savory foods but theae potatoes? ... A MUST. they're so different and have a great bite to them. a much appreciated weird combo. Service has always been great.

We got some sweets to go (kok, blueberry pastry and some apricot cookies). Price was great and the service was extremely friendly. Tips: This place has no meat on the menu so for vegan and veg friends will leave with very happy bellies! For meat eaters, the portions are hearty and yummy! They have vegan meat subs if you are craving something. Another tip, they only take tips in cash so make sure if you're paying with a card you have some cash!Enjoy :)"}, {"review_id": "R6oox7cBO3xRsxrYLeYZnQ", "user_id": "wQJyFcK4PW-vFgXP4fgFhA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Great vegan options in Rochester! Greek is one of my favorite cuisines, but it can be difficult to find authentic restaurants that also offer vegan options. Voula's has all of the essential Greek favorites and offers vegan options for many. I started with the 3 spreads plate, unfortunately they were out of hummus which was one of the 3 vegan options so instead I doubled up on the eggplant spread and tried the skordalia (super garlicky & yummy vegan alternative to tzatziki). For my entree I got the vegan spanikopita (try it!) and dolmades (I forgot to ask for the vegan option, so it came with tzatziki).  My girlfriend got the regular spanikopita which she also said was delish as well as the lemon potatoes which were good but much more herby than lemony.  We grabbed a few sweets to go but haven't had a chance to try them yet - they do look decadent however. Overall this was a great place for a vegan and a non- vegan to both have a delicious brunch."}, {"review_id": "JOz7hixEmcfBzpQ35-I6mA", "user_id": "jfhBxiqqP0wtEan0L8ikkg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/17/2017", "text": "My first impression of a vegetarian and vegan Greek place that has a full menu and an extensive bakery would be that it may just be doing a little too much to be great across the board, but I can't find a crack in the exceptional quality!

I particularly enjoy the galaktoboureko.A quick note: Although cards are accepted, the vendor system doesn't allow for tipping on one's card, so I always try to bring some cash to fill the jar when dining in.

We had a wonderful dining experience. The food was outstanding! I tried the spanakopita special, which included potatoes, a salad, and a Greeky thing that I don't recall the name of that was also delicious. I can't say enough good things about those potatoes! They were phenomenal- seasoned to perfection and cooked perfectly. They made for a delicious party in my mouth. The spanakopita was also fantastic! My salad was very fresh too.The service was a little slow, but they were very crowded! We still got our food in a reasonable amount of time. I loved the decor and the ambiance of Volua's- it felt very homey and welcoming. There's plenty to look at! It's quite cute and quaint. I also grabbed a dessert to go- kok- and it was light and delicious. It didn't feel overly indulgent, but it was still a nice, sweet treat to go.

Rochester New York?I know probably not. Berkeley Ca..okay, Santa Cruz Ca...sure...but Rochester??Rochester has a myriad selection of vegan and vegetarian restaurants. Thank God no more yelpers going to a steak house who are vegan and giving a one star ( you know what I mean)Voula's Greek Sweets is a wonderful cute little cafe that serves simple yet tasty vegan and vegetarian food. Their Kafteri breakfast egg sandwich is soo good:  two eggs, kafteri sauce, fresh dill and parsley on lagana bread....it is very unique and a perfect blend of tastes and textures.The three spread combo with warm lagana bread is also a great vegan choice. I had it with their lemon potatoes which are simple and flavorful. Roasted brown with a hint of lemon...Before we left we picked up a bunch of their baked goods and they were all awesome. KoK...funny name awesome pastry: chocolate coated sponge cake filled with Bavarian cream. think of a healthy hostess chocolate cupcake....but oh so much better!!!Chocolatina...wow a chocolate layer cake dipped in chocolate...you gotta like chocolate but it is wonderfulGalaktoboureko. Try pronouncing that...just point it's easier. It is a custard filled phyllo pastry that is flaky and rich.I had read that Voula's husband  had been killed a few years ago, in a car accident, and I felt so sad for her but I have the highest regard for her reopening and making everyone that dines here so happy.
