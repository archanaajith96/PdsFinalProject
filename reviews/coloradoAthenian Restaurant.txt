We just moved here a few weeks ago and were searching for a good Greek restaurant - we have found our new favorite restaurant.The atmosphere was authentic; the wait staff was attentive and friendly; the food was FANTASTIC. We will definitely be back. We shared a plate of spanikopita - amazing. I had the avgolemono (lemon/orzo/chicken soup) with the pastitsio platter - amazing. And my husband had the Greek salad with the gyro plate - incredible. I come from a Greek family and this restaurant is like being back in my YiaYia's kitchen."}, {"review_id": "1EXHgq2BS6oXpccz7oVe9g", "user_id": "X4c2EsJ2ioDV0CeiQL6iOQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Found this hidden gem in the middle of a parking lot. Such a cute place! The decorations and atmosphere are authentic Greek and the food is amazing! The portion sizes are great for the price you pay. I ordered the pastitsio with gyro meat on the side and I could only finish half and I saved the rest for dinner that evening. So good!

The service was prompt, friendly and attentive.  Everyone was very pleasant.I ordered the spanikopita plate.  It came with a house salad, which was very nice.  I also came with pita bread and very good Tzaziki.  Very creamy with a nice cucumber flavor.  As far as the main meal, the spanikopita was very good.  It came with 2 dolmades (yummy) and a very generous portion of pita meat.  The flavors were all great and I'd order everything again.For dessert, I chose some authentic Baklava, which they make here.  I definitely recommend coming here and will return."}, {"review_id": "MVipW9CNL8OIBGyngBZ7oA", "user_id": "9XkpizE6dAqTmnyQ_eKLfA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/16/2017", "text": "I actually ordered this to my hotel room for delivery.  Through Yelp!  It was my first food delivery that was done by an Uber driver too!  The food was great.  Very tasty and large portions!  I had more than enough for dinner and left overs for the next night too!I order the gyro plate.  It came with rice, veggies, gyro, pita and taziki sauce (sp?).  It was, as mentioned, delicious.I would definitely order from them again."}, {"review_id": "FUarrc-KUhaGcdJ1t05QZA", "user_id": "MnuYxioHrvu4atYu1_5-Qg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "I love Greek food and this place is one of the best that I have visited while living here in Colorado.

I got the Greek Chicken Kabob salad ($11.50 for a huge salad), which I huge and has a ton of fresh veggies and dolmas. I've also gotten one of the mixed plates (don't remember the name) with lamb which was wonderful. Both times I've ordered the dolma appetizer($9.50 for 8), these are the real deal, hand made, dolmas and they are perfect with a little lemon!!! The pita is fresh and lightly crispy. The portions are large and the service is great. If you come before 3pm they serve breakfast and non-Greek options in addition to their normal menu. The wine is about $6 per glass. Bottom line...get the dolmas. They're the best I've had next to my Palestinian best friends.

Greek food is terrific & may we recommend the saganaki (flaming cheese).  1st person - I've tried almost everything on the menu & haven't got a complaint.  My fav is greek steak with vegetables or one of their platters which is plenty for 3 people.  2nd person - chicken kabob plate if not sharing a platter.  We recently went for breakfast.  Never a wait like other places & the green chile (talk about spicy).  The country fried steak is wonderful.  Omelet dishes come with choice of bread, pancakes.  I tried pancakes; way too much for me.  Price wise - yes it may cost a few $$ but you get what you pay for is our motto.  The food & service is great.
