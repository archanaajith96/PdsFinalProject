The lady who runs the place is really sweet and basically becomes your adoptive mom. She offered us free samples of everything on the menu, and was very nice and cordial to us. Her son made excellent falafel and gyro sandwiches for us. I'm in Lincoln for a work trip but I'm definitely putting this on my list of places to visit whenever I come back. I love supporting local businesses and this business deserves all the praises it can get. Thank you for amazing food and excellent service!"}, {"review_id": "em6gkJ7va22a7lL0xNmmug", "user_id": "sD_PMkINbCiPT7dlK3Mx_g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Food is divine. Asiago Chicken is amazing. This is a unique dining experience to say the least. Food is served from a make shift counter. It's nice to see and sample each dish but I wonder if food is kept at proper temperature and for how long. Everyone who looks over the food could reach right in, it's just odd for us midwestern germophobes. Friendly and welcoming for sure. Made with heart and care, absolutely."}, {"review_id": "G7jj-N2Sv8aQxXnDDrb-oQ", "user_id": "b3w9-zaDZ524De59lVf8_Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "**Thats what I got for $38 dollars!!!  It was my first time there, the lady in charge wasnt clear about her system (she couldnt answer my questions like if the food was sold by weight or by item).  She realized that I was getting frustrated and instead of helping me, she got a little defensive.  It was a very bad situation. At the end I just wanted to pay and get out. The big surprise was the price!

You are encouraged to try everything, order anything, stay and chat. The food is only rivaled by the service and dedication of the owner. And now the price of the baklava. Which is $3 for each tiny diamond. Wowza. Makes me almost miss those farmers market days. Also, they accept card but really seem to prefer cash, small bills in particular."}, {"review_id": "eJ0Wxq_5GrU0PLZ9m_Kk5Q", "user_id": "fhi8K-yYlcCpWt2MRBYPgA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/7/2017", "text": "Wow! I'm in love with Daffodil Mediterranean. I first experienced the sweets at the downtown Farmer's Market. I loved how the owner, Narges, makes you feel like you've known her for years every time you step up for you free sample of Baklava. She welcomes you into her space like a grandmother would and then fills your tummy with yummy delights. It took me far too long to make it to their actual restaurant but it won't be nearly as long before I return. Narges is there to welcome you and she takes time to explain what's on the menu. Then, as you stare at the yummy dishes completely unsure if you should bet on this one or that, she hands you a little sampler plate of goodies to help you decide. And, if there something else you want to try she is more than happy to serve you up a little spoonful on your sampler plate.I settled for meatballs mixed with berries and chicken asiago and a side of saffron rice. If you select two entrees you pay just $2 extra. Both of my dishes were outstanding! The meatballs were sweet and the chicken asiago was cheesy, but since it's a hard cheese it wasn't melted and stringy it was melted and kind of chunky. That's a terrible explanation for such a wonderful dish!My friend had the last sweet scoop of the pomegranate walnut chicken and also had a stuffed sweet red pepper with saffron rice. Also very delicious, especially the pomegranate chicken.  Between all our dishes, the thing that stood out most is the variety of flavor. Sweet, spicy, meaty, just delicious!We both cleared out plates and were so full we didn't even have room for dessert, which I know from experience is AMAZING. Best baklava I've ever had.  I believe you can order a limited number of items not on the buffet but I'm not entirely sure. It's a little confusing when you come in but Narges takes over and makes it easy. You can purchase drinks or there is water available. There isn't a lot of seating. It's very small and intimate and almost feels like you're at a family dinner. Prices are a little high but you get a lot of homemade, fresh, Persian food with outstanding service. It's worth every bite and every penny. We will be back again and again!!"}, {"review_id": "q7ibxZImIfmhgeZnTq9EMQ", "user_id": "cwueZl7VqnEiuY-c8CWaLQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/20/2017", "text": "I haven't been this excited to write a review in a while..this place is truly a gem! It's so homie and the woman that owns it takes so much pride in her cooking. It's obvious she's passionate about what she does and loves and appreciates her customers.She let us sample a bunch of items from the buffet before settling on what we wanted for our meal. Simply put, everything was amazing. My personal favorite was the potato salad, but the rice, chicken, meatballs...seriously, everything!Before leaving, we got a few desserts to eat at home - the baklava and honey cake were both incredible.It's so refreshing to find a place like this, owned by such humble, passionate people.

Walking in for our first time we weren't sure what to expect. But the incredibly nice lady whom is very grandmotherly describes each dish and allows you to sample before you choose.
