I'd definitely recommend getting a reservation if you plan on going. We had one, but the table wasn't quite ready yet; not a problem, we found seats at the bar and enjoyed a cocktail while we waited. The cocktails were spot on and within 10 minutes or so We were shown to our table.Now this is a small plates place so the idea is to order multiple per person and share them. I'm a meat-eater myself, but I went here with a vegan friend so was a little concerned I might not enjoy it as much. To my delight the vegan dishes (warm brussel sprouts, grilled cauliflower bulgogi, and sautéed fiddlehead ferns) were absolutely amazing! I did insist on one meat dish and ordered the chicken-fried quail; I was happy with it, but it was just less amazing than the other dishes.Another wonderful part of our experience was our server. She was also a vegan, so was able to give a lot of helpful tips and steer us in the right direction on what to order. I rarely order dessert, but she was talked us into it and I'm glad she did. She recommended a chocolate cake type dish (I forget what she called it). We certainly didn't *need* more food, the 4 small plates were plenty, but it was a tasty treat to close out a wonderful evening."}, {"review_id": "TagjucWqyxM7HmLFa80bGw", "user_id": "jL-qSB8CAKrAdF6fKJNCxQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Great cocktails, eclectic worldly menu, relaxed vibe.  Doesn't get much better than this!Cocktails are imaginative and well made.  The food is generally small plates made for sharing and features interesting combinations of good stuff.  There are about 25 items to choose from and each one has multiple components.  The kitchen is like a \"concentration\" game - so many containers!  Half the menu is vegetarian too.  The food veers to the side of overcomplicated but I appreciate the effort!Here's an example: The quail dish is two halves of a bird, each stuffed with cornbread and chorizo stuffing, and then chicken-fried, served over cheddar grits, red chili honey butter, and pickled okra.  The fried bird was delicious, with the stuffing adding bulk to the small half-bird, and that red chili honey butter was soooo gooood, just give me some of that with some bread and I would be happy.  The grits were a good idea but they were lumpy and not very cheesy and tasted premade.Everything we tried had components that were super tasty and others that weren't.  But this is a place that takes chances and if that's something that appeals to you, you will definitely enjoy it."}, {"review_id": "6-GFQMLEFbf1qRfSSlEF2w", "user_id": "7F7W-p8KT4skU0Hxtr4Abw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Listen, I hate small plates. But if you're going to do small plates, go to Odd Duck. It's where it's at. And go on payday or save up because if you'd like the option of trying many dishes, it's going to cost a pretty penny. This place is also heaven for vegetarians and people who are gluten-free. They really cater to all kinds of eaters! And guess what?! Even if you aren't a vegetarian their vegetable menu is worth the try! We opted to try a dish from this section; the Cauliflower Bulgogi. It was absolutely delicious and a great starter. This particular menu had an appetizer section of cheese, charcuterie and snacks. We decided to skip all of these as it did not seem worth it to us. We aren't rich people and so we wanted our money to go to delicious entrees. Scallops were cooked to absolute perfection. The flavor of the dish was on point with the greens and potato pancake. Although the potato pancake on its own was neither here nor there. The steak skewer was delicious! The chicken fried stuffed Quail was probably my least favorite dish, but still good. I had never had Quail before! It was nice to try something so different. It came with a chipotle sauce I could have done without. For dessert we opted for the vegan chocolate cake. Vegans are eating delicious desserts if they bake like that! I'm not the biggest fan of chocolate cake, but this was quite good. They change their menu, although I'm not sure how often this happens. I would say not to expect the same menu another reviewer has written about. I'll still post a pic of the menu and food so you can get an idea of the kinds of food they serve. This place is a lot like Kindred, but so much better. Better food, better drinks, better flavors, better execution. They really know what they're doing at Odd Duck. You'll absolutely need to make reservations, however we came on a Friday. I called right when they opened and they had two spots for 2 people left, which was lucky. So you might be able to get in day of, but if you're going on a whim, you'd better expect a wait. They do leave the bar seating for walk-ins. I hear sitting at the bar is a lot of fun. For drinks, we decided to try their specialty cocktails. We have reached the day and age where people are trying to get really creative with drink ingredients. I personally just prefer simple drinks. I'm not a fan of all these fanciful cocktails. However where Kindred absolutely failed, Odd Duck completely nailed; we loved our cocktails. We got the Beet Daiquiri and Bombay Sapphire, both were deliciousOur waitress was so soft spoken, but eloquent and kind. We enjoyed her. Im not quite sure when we'll be back, but we'll definitely try to find our way back here again."}, {"review_id": "4lmTD3EovvXVVqbGs45rhQ", "user_id": "zp68lKUI2aJ9-IURUQq5pw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Amazing! Love tapas where everyone can share. All the dishes we sampled were excellent. Our group of 3 had 6 entrees, 2 snacks and a desert. We were definitely full but it was so hard to decide what to get! Started with the beet pickled eggs and fennel citrus roasted olives. LOVED the olives. Our 2 favorite entrees were the Charred octopus and the Fiddlehead ferns. But seriously, everything we had I would eat again. The cocktails were very delicious too. Our waitress was very helpful and knowledgeable as some of the ingredients we were not familiar with. I will definitely be returning!"}, {"review_id": "ZLX_2PslDBH8hLIW1CpkFA", "user_id": "7uhT5AhKuIbi7aKHwag5sA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Odd Duck.... duh. Go! The food is phenomenal, the drinks are on point. I see that you might not want to go based on if you are pickier eater, but hey, give it a try. I personally love to randomly pick things when I go here even if the combinations don't sound typical/something that I know. Guaranteed that it will be good! Good place for dates, friends, family, out-of-towners.

I'm glad I called ahead of time to get a reservation as they only had a few reservations available and when we arrive the wait time was  long for those without reservations. Our server was very friendly in helping us decide how many plates and what to get. We ordered everything at once at her suggestion and the plates came out individually at a good pace. Every single one of our choices was fabulous. My favorites were the charred octopus and steak skewers, but I understand that the menu changes regularly. The atmosphere was very fun, but not child friendly in my opinion. They have an outside patio when days are warmer. I look forward to coming back on a nicer day for more great food to check that out.

So many people have recommended this place as their favorite place in Milwaukee for a nice night out. (Recommend making a reservation-- it's so popular!) The atmosphere is very relaxed. The servers are friendly and knowledgeable. The menu changes often and made up of small plates. We were recommended to get 2 per person.We started off with a cheese board. (Love cheese, so much.) Progressed to splitting the beef short rib carnitas, which were amazing. So many different textures-- tender meat, crispy tortillas, sweet corn, and spice from the salsa verde and poblano. This was my husband's favorite. It was absolutely perfect. Next, we tried the pan seared walleye-- savory, paired well with the potato galette, and the vanilla turnip puree. Ventured next into vegetarian territory with the sweet corn pancake. This was delicious. Enough salt from the cheese, sweetness from the corn. We finished the night with the flourless chocolate cake. I love salty and sweet, so this was perfect.The beer, wine and cocktail menu is so varied. Stuck with the beers this night but there's just so many options. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a delightful night out."}, {"review_id": "xL0Nq-sZEW-KesZpTGOdaw", "user_id": "a41IoxVZ05aGm8i1RtdTAA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Everything I've eaten has always been fabulous.

The dishes also really range in flavor profiles and come from different ethnic influences. And not to forget, they have an impressive wine list and a number of clever and inventive cocktails.

He seemed to think based on perhaps our age or appearance that we weren't going to spend the usual amount most would/couldn't afford it or wouldn't tip well. I think we probably surprised him by the end. That was really the only off putting part of our experience here.
