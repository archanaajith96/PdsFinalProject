The parking is a bit tight for my full sized truck but not too tight. The atmosphere is simple and clean. They did have a college football game playing while I was there.I felt like the flavors could've been more developed but it was all good. The egg rolls were crispy and tasty. I also had the Vermicelli with beef which is a cold pasta salad with lettuce and veggies. I didn't realize this when I ordered it but I did enjoy it. I added some of a bowl of sauce they served with us which seemed like a type of sweet and sour sauce. That helped give the meal some added flavor. We also had one of their spicy dishes with rice and pork or beef (don't recall) and that had the best flavors. I'd order that one again."}, {"review_id": "cfcLvNAOT3hHCPBU_LDV5g", "user_id": "FHtEgjmC0qzEShf61d544A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "As a long time patron, I can say without hesitation that this is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Cedar Rapids! The variety of authentic Vietnamese cuisine is always made fresh and delicious. There is never a wait here and you can walk right in and get a seat. The restaurant is family run, and they treat their customers with genuine hospitality. I recommend the spring rolls as an appetizer, and a bowl of the Pho as an entree. Whether eating with a fork, a spoon, or chopsticks, Phong Lan always hits the spot."}, {"review_id": "X1E-P5HESG7pX0A_E7nXvw", "user_id": "2gbczzpuvYQMbxgOI8ZtRg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Yay!

They open at 11 and arriving at 11:30 I was seated quickly. The digs here are very humble, and super reminiscence of a mom and pop type place. Plenty of Asian inspired artwork and statues on the walls set the stage for what was the delicious experience.The menu seemed to showcase plenty of different dishes, however I came for the Pho! There were seven or eight different types of the soup including the standards like chicken and meat ball, as well as a seafood themed dish but they seemed pretty excited about. The standard accoutrements are at your table and included fish sauce, hoisin sauce, and sriracha.The soup is served in a standard large ball and comes in one size. It's not big enough to bathe a small animal in, but it would be large enough for a small fish to comfortably hang out in for a while. The broth was good, but had a little bit different flavor than I'm used to. It almost taste it a little seafood and I wonder if it had remnants of the seafood soup that they had been talking about. It was nothing overpowering, and not something that would keep me from coming back. The noodles were plentiful, the standard sides of bean sprouts, basil leaves and a lime or included not everywhere includes the sides so they get points for having the standards! I had the beef and meatball soup and it was tasty! Good amount of meat, but not so much that it seems like you're eating broth that numerous animals are also enjoying.Each bowl ran about 8:50, and was totally worth it for the price. I also enjoy the delightful cup of tea which was something like $0.95.This is a really solid place to enjoy some delicious pho! The serving sizes are excellent, and not too big. The meat and noodles are done very nicely and the ambiance is absolutely what I hope for when I go to a place like this. If you're a fan of Vietnamese noodle soup, you owe it to yourself to check this place out!"}, {"review_id": "y8xLI9jhni-7AwgpRBOM0g", "user_id": "Z1ZnBk1Zwm7q_frMMIBjRQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/1/2017", "text": "Off the beaten path and many may not think to stop by at this place to eat.

The broth is so delicious, you would be hard pressed to find such a flavorful pho in Iowa. I also got 2 spring rolls which were good and the perfect appetizer but the pho stole the show.

In fact, I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most underrated restaurants in town. The decor is nothing special, but the food makes up for the lack of atmosphere. I've had several dishes at Phong Lan, my favorite being the S17 (red curry chicken with potato, celery, and onion), but tonight I tried out their vermicelli with eggrolls and shredded pork. It was excellent. Eggrolls were crisp and tasty and soaked up the flavors in the bowl. The vermicelli and veggies added a pleasant contrast in texture.  For an appetizer, we had spring rolls and a Vietnamese crepe. The spring rolls, as always, were delicious. They're fresh, light, and make you want to lick the plate clean. At first glance, the crepe seemed a bit sketchy; it looked like an omelet with a botched plastic surgery. But, to my surprise, it was undeniably tasty. One of the best parts of the dining experience was the service. As always, it was impeccable The food came out quickly and our waiter was diligent and kind. He even took some time to talk to us about the Vietnamese crepe and how they serve it in Vietnam.Phong Lan is the classic case of \"never judge a book by its cover\". From the outside it looks bleak and strange, most likely incapable of turning out any decent food. But if you take a leap of faith and try it, I can promise you'll leave feeling satisfied. Note: This is all coming from someone who's eating at a grand total of 3 Vietnamese places in his life, so pardon my lack of expertise."}, {"review_id": "0rqhUpahG5fA1U5iW0_9aw", "user_id": "H7YVaxQtLIiOvy0-Xu1soA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/28/2016", "text": "Stopped by for dinner with some friends on a Thursday night since we were in the area. Usually if we are in Cedar Rapids we go to Pho Mai because it's closer for us driving from Iowa City, but I'm glad we tried Phong Lan. It was pretty empty when we went but it took a while to get our orders taken. However, once we placed our orders the food was out in literally 5 minutes. Between our party of four we ordered spring rolls, banh xeo, pho dac biet, bun cha gio, hu tieu, and a rice dish. I really enjoyed the banh xeo! It is EASILY the best one I have had in Iowa. Good ratio of sprouts to meat unlike others I've had and the crepe part was cooked perfectly. I only wish there was a little more lettuce served with it. I also like the broth of the pho here. I prefer a savory broth over a sweeter one, and the broth here was pretty on point. It's a little fattier that what I would make myself, but I think it's better than most of the other places that serve pho in the area. They also serve the pho with thai chilis instead of jalapenos which is nice. I think they could serve it with a few more vegetables, but it wasn't a huge deal.They have a big menu compared to some of the Vietnamese places in the area, and the nice thing is that it's actually Vietnamese food and not the weird fusion of Vietnamese and American-Chinese that you see at a lot of places.The only real issue is I think the prices for the amount of food you get is a LITTLE high, but in a city with only 2 Vietnamese restaurants, I can't really complain. The pho dac biet was about $9 for an okay size bowl and the bun cha gio was $8 and some change. The banh xeo was kind of small for $6.50, but like I said it was so good that I would get it again. If I'm in the area again, I'll definitely stop by and try something else (really want to try the bun bo hue and bo luc lac) on the menu. This is my new go-to Vietnamese place in CR! !"}, {"review_id": "PzOwL0vuqNEPFRJ0jrLBQw", "user_id": "FFM5evizuAQWge3LjKCyZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2016", "text": "Spectacular Pho and Vermicelli and even better service!  Seriously come here every single time I'm back in town."}, {"review_id": "T0a2_51u-B0iRkoexSzQPA", "user_id": "fM3e2bfikV_P6wZTTPQGMQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "11/14/2017", "text": "They gave incomplete orders charged extra and when I called they said it was my fault for not telling them that I wanted bean sprouts in the soup.   Bean sprout a d coriander are basic things in a pho.   What idiots"}, {"review_id": "bcj9nThgPTi21vDeG-JqqA", "user_id": "CXfPl8ufOosWCdUMGFQZQw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/22/2016", "text": "My husband and I decided to order take-out of soups- beef noodle pho and hot & sour.
