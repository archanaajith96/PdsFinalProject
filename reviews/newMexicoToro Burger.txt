I normally don't like having heavy conversation when I go out to ear, but the waiter was super likable.I had the Toro burger, it was so damn good. I am glad I did not BYOB my burger.I am glad I fought the urge to leave when I pulled in the parking lot. The owners are missing this unpolished gem. This could be the best burger joint in Rio Rancho/Albuquerque, no joke.I am considering delivery from Grub hub as  I see Toro Burger offers it.-Daniel"}, {"review_id": "WWe-ZLHuoJcj94H-4MDUtA", "user_id": "SU5swelEjsEjrssNnevitQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Saw the 5 star rating and truly wondered whether this place would live up to all the hype. Stopped by and have to say , this place deserves 5 stars.Ordered a beverage and looked at menu. Decided to go with the Salmon burger special and got the sweet tater tots.Both were very good but that is not the reason for the 5 stars. The bartender ( James ) is over the top. Funny and knowledgable he makes this place shine.Once beer taps get installed this place will be even better , although 5 stars is as high as it goes.Keep up the good work."}, {"review_id": "JQ8o6264j30m8hqOBg6vcA", "user_id": "Godgdyqq1NDesABm-cJdhA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "James was our server bartender and he gave us excellent service. This establishment is lucky to have him. He was attentive but not too intrusive, and gave us a lowdown on the burgers and the beers.We had the Toro Burger and the Mo'Better and we were both pleased. Both burgers were delicious, they're accompanying toppings and condiments blending excellently with the meat. The twice fried fries were pleasing as well. We also enjoyed the beers that were suggested to us.

I am impressed and happy to find a restaurant that makes their own ground steak patties, fresh cut fries, sauces, pickles, etc.  That is hard to find these days... I would call these burgers legit Gourmet with an average burger price. They were delicious along with the fries and sweet potato tots. I ate 1/4 leftover burger the next day and it was SO GOOD!

Though it's not an easy place to locate since their sign isn't easy to see from street level. It is located inside the Inn at Rio Rancho, classy lobby and welcoming. The hamburgers were amazing, flavourful, and unique. The lunchador burger was cleverly constructed and a well thought dish - just like a lunchador fighter - it was packed with unsuspected, sneaky punches that knock your tastebuds out of the water. The pickled jalapeño added the slightly sweet with a touch of citric to cut right through the fatty layers. The top and bottom buns were toasted to prevent the moister from making the buns soggy.Most of their stuff is house made, the patty was well cooked, juicy and well flavoured. Can't wait to come back and try all of the burgers they have to offer.  Truly a hidden gem of Rio Rancho."}, {"review_id": "HaS8kKNlLXt5cjkz-CSAqg", "user_id": "GjuJHc9dRFAz2ZBen1s5tg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "We visited this place a few weeks ago it's a cute dive type place.  It was nice and quiet when we went in, which I love.

The restaurant is located inside the Inn at Rio Rancho (formerly the Howard Johnson hotel) in Rio Rancho. You enter through the hotel lobby. This restaurant had very comfortable seating with some tables and chairs and some 1/2 booth / 1/2 chair combos. There's a nice fireplace for some ambience also. The restaurant was spacious and spotlessly clean. There is a bar area at the far end of the restaurant and 1 TV up on the wall.The burgers are made there of 3 different cuts of steak that they grind daily. The fries are hand cut, double fried for crispness and tossed with sea salt. The onion things are slivered onions with a somewhat spicy breading. I think red chile powder is in the breading. Hubby had the Toro burger which has Hatch green chile, housemade bacon, a cheese blend and chipotle aoli. He really enjoyed it and had the onion things as his side. I had the basic grilled cheese which was served on sourdough and had the fries as my side. It was a good grilled cheese and the fries were awesome.The restaurant does not have a web page and somewhere on Google they said is a menu, but it's an old one. They don't have a website, but do have a Facebook page. The Facebook page has the current menu which I've added to the information for this restaurant. facebook.com/toroburgerb…Service was excellent. James served us and he was absolutely on top of everything. We never had an empty glass and he kept us updated as to when we could expect our food to come out. Give this place a shot. I think you will really like it. Our dinner, including 2 soft drinks was just under $20, all in all, a very reasonably priced dinner.Updated: 7/24/17 This has become one of our regular stops. They have a great, housemade veggie patty for vegetarians. My husband's favorite has quickly become the Big Porky, which is a pork tenderloin sandwich that is so large it hangs off the bun. He gets it with the chipotle bbq sauce and loves it!"}, {"review_id": "HOHkMr_nwkfHSXTu7ljLvQ", "user_id": "8CavSloZJVSVAAh8GqSAvg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/18/2017", "text": "SO and I visited toro burger bar on a Thursday night at 6.

We got the chicken tenders for my 2  year old and they were good also. My husband got the Toro burger with the beef Patty and it was pretty good as well.

My burger was fresh beef, which is hard to find in a restaurant, usually it's some frozen nasty patty. My burger ( The Toro of course) was cooked to perfection. The fries were awesome too!! Last but not least was their homemade Ice cream sandwich. Simply amazing and I was so happy that we had decided to walk through the door!!

Ok so I needed to capture the attention of everyone reading reviews to tell you that this is an EXCELLENT burger. I'm normally not the type to use all CAPS letters in my reviews, but this deserved the extra emphasis. So I ordered the Luchador burger to go, I called it in. The burger was cooked exactly to my liking, and you could taste every ingredient piled high on these 2 buns (potato buns!! My fave!!). I had to squish mine down to take an actual bite, it's huge!! You can clearly see and taste the handmade love and work they put into their food. Not quite sure who I spoke with, but he seemed passionate about helping us, giving us advice and tips that we ordered the 2 main popular burgers. He seemed confident and eager to get us back in. Which I guarantee you I will be back and I am going to try to get the word out there about this place to others that haven't tried this place. I promise you that you are in for great food if you haven't been here yet. I had the onion things as a side, it's an extra buck but it's more than worth it. Huge portions of sides and the burger itself. Their homemade pickled jalapeños were stacked high on my burger and the taste is oh so good! Be prepared, they are spicy! I believe the prices are lower than you would expect for the quality, uniqueness and even quantity of the food. I would've happily spent even $3 more than what I had to for my burger. It's got a 5 star rating for a reason!!!"}, {"review_id": "0xdK5a559S7hn0oske9RsQ", "user_id": "WwjzieYdokcmkLyWYPuamQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/26/2017", "text": "I ate here for the first time because the yelp reviews were so good.  I was a little skeptical but it turns out I was not disappointed!  I had the Diablo (medium) and it was delicious!

We have always passed by it, but never stopped to check it out. I'm glad we did, because the food was fantastic! James was our server and he gave us the low down on what items were good to try off the menu. They offer a different burger every month. For the month of April, they were offering a \"Brunch Burger\". It had bacon, hash brown & a sunny side up egg as well. That burger was a good size portion enough to feed two people. We also tried the \"Not A BLT Burger\", which had bacon in it. All burgers we ordered came with a side of fries that still had the skin on them. Served crispy and able to hold its own on the platter. We also tried the ground beef tacos, excellent flavor with just the right amount of heat. Served with sour cream and salsa. Lastly, we tried the Turkey Sandwich, that had turkey meat, pepper jack, green chili on toasted sourdough bread. All the meals were very flavorful and good sized portions. If you're ever in the mood for tasty burgers in the Rio Rancho area give this place a try. We're definitely coming back to try other menu items."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/toro-burger-rio-rancho?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
