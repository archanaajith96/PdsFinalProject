They offer chicken and pork tamales, and there is a limit of six tamales per customer. Needless to say, I always order six and eat either three or four and take the leftovers home for a midnight snack. The tamales are delicious but my wife enjoy one fish taco and two tamales. She claims they don't taste as good when warmed up later at home for a snack!!They also bring never ending chips and salsa, which are also delightful. Our waitress was excellent, as always when we come here!  We intend to keep coming back often!!"}, {"review_id": "gJQpjZ1aZH8DPLAzKLdShQ", "user_id": "PJcABPX0DpCKvOL1S4X9lA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Came here for dinner on a recommendation. Place was pretty busy when I arrived and the crowd appeared to be all smiles both directions. I got my seat and although busy I waited almost 10 minutes before I got a menu. After I ordered a drink and food,another lengthy wait occured. My chips and salsa arrived and it was good. Later my drink order was retaken since it was forgotten.My food and drink finally arrived. The margarita s are served in a 1/3 size mason jar with a grip. The alcohol content was low even for a house blend. I expected more for $6. My food...the tacos were kid sized and the burrito was bland with no kick or juices. The sizes of the items were also small in comparison to other establishments. It was an average descent meal but did not live up to the hype."}, {"review_id": "umXVL6Knz_-sbQDEPx8sJg", "user_id": "2KfMecCRNpHKyW4uzGv44w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Returned again, for the 5th time! Highly suggest getting the gorditas! Easily the best and truest Mexican food in Springfield. I got the chimichanga, steak taco, and shredded beef burrito. All had very tender and moist ingredients. The portion sizes were very fair and the sides were pretty standard in all regards. The salsa was good but is arguably less flavorful then el puente. Service was the best I've had. Overall a 5 star experience today"}, {"review_id": "rXkY-ERbp96xX3UeIL8-aA", "user_id": "uxglfTgdaR5hAwxrz1HDhQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "Very good, perhaps the best I've had in Springfield so far, but less amazing than I was hoping for.I ended up not being blown away by the Guisado de Barbacoa that I ordered, though the homemade from masa corn tortillas that accompanied it were a neat touch.I will definitely return and try some other items on the menu that piqued my interest a little more (this particular dish was a favorite of my server's).Portions good and prices very good."}, {"review_id": "hSDhqUuZjTdEPUbe94suuA", "user_id": "6S0-Wu3jRXQZN94Bw54m2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "First time here.  Service and food were great!  One of the better Mexican places in Springfield.  Guacamole was nice and chunky and really fresh.  Server was very knowledgeable about the food, ingredients and how it was prepared which helped determine what I would be able to eat with my allergy to red meat."}, {"review_id": "QE0EEnvfq3zg-7SI91HYyg", "user_id": "LzBhuoH9RfspY7ukwJ7qzA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "6/9/2017", "text": "Food was good but not great.

It's supposed to be made with fresh cactus, not jarred ones. Taco Tuesday is overrated. A few sprinkles of meat with a bunch of lettuce and a little bit of cheese summed my tacos up. Yes the salsa tasted canned and the tortillas are bland with no flavor. Overrated. Authentic, absolutely not.

Family owned and managed and they bring several dishes to the area not found in other Mexican Restaurants.   Their beef tacos are excellent and chicken quesadilla's are a full meal.    They try to make what you want so they accommodated me with a smaller quesadilla that allowed me to eat a taco with it.  Very customer focused and ready to help!   Prices are very reasonable and food was quick. We enjoyed and will return often.   I like the phrase from another reviewer, this place is a diamond in the rough.   Enjoy"}, {"review_id": "OWjU0ri2GmngdKGRSXLDow", "user_id": "xIaXpiPqcMAPLDGPUvgQ_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Favorite Mexican restaurant in Springfield!

My wife and I both love Mexican cuisine and Tortilleria Perches is now our favorite Mexican restaurant.My wife and I were pleasantly surprised with just how fresh the ingredients were. From the salsa and chips to the exceptionally seasons meats, you can tell the owners care about the food they serve. We both ordered burritos, and we couldn't help but say each time we eat the tortilla how fresh and perfect it was.

The waitress apologized and replaced it.  My burrito was \"ok\", nothing special and while it was only $9; it was full of meat.  The plate also had some rice and brown slush; which I can only assume came from some mess hall kitchen leftover, a bucket or leftover drippings from a can of beans.   If you saw National Lampoon's Vegas Vacation: It was \"brown\" from the casino buffet. It was so nasty looking and the consistency of slush; that I had to look away during the entire meal.  Speaking of entire meal; it would have been nice to be asked if we wanted more chips, maybe a refill on my iced tea: NOTHING, no service!  I don't mind paying double for burrito, just to get one properly prepared and served on a plate: you know like you expect in a decent Mexican restaurant. I am not sure how they got all these stars, this is by far one of the worst restaurants I have visited.  When traveling through the area, we will seek other options."}, {"review_id": "y7h9pAHYRcX6eJsYmt-xqw", "user_id": "nuTjzeXqW8dxDJfy3m6RLg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "Ironically our daughter found this little gem when visiting from California.

The Perches are one of the most notable exceptions to that rule: a phenomenally tasty, remarkably inexpensive venue that offers a truly unique take on the genre of food it purports to offer. While Springfield is home to Mexican restaurants aplenty, the Perches distinguish themselves with Mexican barbecue done so well it transcends description, truly setting this place apart from its peers.
