One person in our party needed to avoid grain (corn) and the staff was ready with suggestions for substitution.  For starters we had the \"not to missed\" Hawaiian Nachos with lightly spiced raw tuna on their crisp house made lahvosh. It was a large serving with plenty for 3 people. For entrees there was seared Twisted Sister Salmon fillet, sear Yellow Fin Ahi , Prairie Fire Flank steak (with espresso-cayenne spice rub), and the Wailea Stew. All had wonderful flavor profiles, and were visually appealing.Why only three stars? The Stew and Salmon fillet came out cool; the stew was nearly cold - perhaps they were waiting on the flank steak. Without fuss, the servings were replaced.  An unfortunate bump in an otherwise very enjoyable meal.  Slightly pricey with most entrees at $25, the overall quality compensates."}, {"review_id": "UKXxQH0s2MvqL-MfCijX-g", "user_id": "TBrmMc5zRgmYs_IGGJ5d5A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "If you're a lover of amazing wine or great beer you need to stop by the Twisted Cork they have a selection puts them at the top of the restaurant group's in Omaha.   Add to that great food and you have a 5 star location, if you haven't been here you definitely need to check it out, if you have you know what I'm talking about,"}, {"review_id": "ZzvFX1a2VksQsy4p-41bKQ", "user_id": "4aby2q3uyeiJUsBbtuEu7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Love the atmosphere.

We were passing through Omaha on a road trip, and we figured it'd be nice to splurge a little bit after a long drive. As it turns out, it was even better than we imagined. I am not exaggerating when I say that the prairie fire flank steak was the best steak I've ever eaten. I guess that makes sense as an East Coast kid, but I'm still amazed at how good it was! Not to mention, the service was tip top and the wine was good too. If I ever find myself back in Omaha, I'm definitely gonna try to go to Twisted Cork!"}, {"review_id": "XWp_1iimxe6NWfVHnIE6JQ", "user_id": "wRq1DSWOjv0BUnSoCM1HwQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "It was alright, I got the tacos which I wouldn't order again.

We made a reservation, but I don't think it's necessary. It's kinda in a random spot, surrounded by a law firm and office suites, but it's easy to snag parking in the lot, which is nice. Chose the honey citrus salad, wild shrimp, and citrus bar. Salad was good, but nothing amazing. Kind of wish I went with the roasted peach instead. Shrimp was cooked perfectly, and the herb butter sauce was delicious. I actually liked the salad it came with more than my starter one - the dressing was bomb and I liked the crunch that the little bits of ramen noodle gave it. The jasmine rice was a little mushy. Citrus bar was yummy, although I couldn't taste the grapefruit or orange in it - kinda just tasted like a really sweet lemon bar, although the consistency was more soft and custardy than your standard lemon bar.Other things from the restaurant week menu I sampled from my friends were the gazpacho, steak, ahi cakes, and bistro spun vanilla bean ice cream. First time trying gazpacho, it was almost like a salsa. Not bad flavor-wise, but I like my soups warm. Steak was rather small, but it was a beautiful medium rare, and my friend really enjoyed the sauce it came with. The ahi cakes were just okay, and I didn't really like the miso-sesame dressing on the salad it came with. I think I liked my shrimp the best out of all the entree choices. The vanilla bean ice cream was delicious!Service was good, our waitress was quick to refill our waters and checked up on us thoughout our the meal. Food came out pretty quickly as well. This place is worth a try for $30. I liked how there's a bit of a Hawaii theme going on. First thing I noticed was the sign on the front door saying \"E komo mai\" which is Hawaiian for welcome."}, {"review_id": "vmB9ZtoplOosQnckMAZrQQ", "user_id": "3K031IamxMLTdDCgjRFwmA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "Wild fresh fish in Omaha at extremely reasonable prices.

It's pretty pricey for dinner. For an appetizer, we ordered the lavash. Definitely recommend! It has a lot of flavor and isn't too filling because it's a cracker with toppings. For dinner, ordered the salmon with kale sautéed in coconut oil with mixed sweet corn. It was extremely delicious. Our server was very attentive and answered all her questions!

With this order, they give you two tacos and unseasoned rice to mop of the juices and toppings that inevitably spill from your tacos. I could have easily eaten four tacos. They were that good! My friend ordered the corn soup and declared it hearty with a hint of spiciness. I definitely want to return for the fun decor and to try other dishes on the menu. I removed a star because, during the lunch rush, the sheer number of conversations and the acoustics of the restaurant combined for a loud experience.

Cold wet February Saturday and there were not many people out and about.

The bacon jam on the burger was unbelievable. I also had their signature old fashioned, great drink. MAKE SURE AND BUY A 6 PACK FOR THE KITCHEN STAFF!

The owners of this restaurant are from the Pacific Northwest (I think Seattle), and the quality of the ingredients and the preparation really shows it.  It was really unusual to find a restaurant of this quality in the Midwest, and even compared to most quality restaurants in places like Colorado or California or Arizona, it was really terrific. They spend a lot of time getting natural/organic meats and other ingredients, and it really shows in the quality of the food. We visited for lunch and tried the salmon tacos and the chicken teriyaki.  I spent a good bit of time trying to decide what to get (and ended up just getting what the server recommended), but in the end, I don't think it  mattered.  This is the sort of place where everything is good, because they put so much care and thought into what they are doing. I suppose prices were a little expensive compared to most places in Omaha for lunch, but considering the quality of the ingredients, I thought that it was pretty reasonable. Even though the restaurant is just in a strip mall, we enjoyed sitting outside to eat.  The air quality indoors seemed okay to me though too.The music was a touch loud for my taste, but it wasn't that bad.I just wish there were more places in the Midwest like this.  Like in Galena, IL, which is a pretty upscale vacation destination for people from Chicago but has no good restaurants at all, for instance. A+.  I will make a point of returning when driving through Omaha (which I do a couple of times a year)."}, {"review_id": "FVAZ4MTLilOT5wyjtGj3yw", "user_id": "4QGfZc15B9Fn2lSOz4f_KA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/18/2017", "text": "**Restaurant Week Menu Review**-Appetizer: Honey citrus salad (mixed mixed greens, beets, Gorgonzola, pickled onions, grapefruit-honey vinaigrette) 2/5-Entrees: Piedmontese flat iron steak (pasture fed, Twisted Cork butcher rub, asparagus, apple smashed potatoes) 5/5-Dessert: Citrus Bar (grapefruit, orange, lemon, shortbread crust) 3/5-Total: $30 before tax and tipI came here with four of my friends for Restaurant Week and this place did not disappoint. I was very satisfied with my 5/5 steak that was cooked to a perfect medium rare. It was plump and juicy to eat and the apple mashed potatoes paired nicely with it's flavor. I don't generally like putting butter or additional spreads on top of my steak but the herb filled butter that sat on top of it actually made a good addition that added something special to it. I gave the dessert dish a 3/5 because it tasted more like a lemon bar as I could not taste any orange or grapefruit in it and the consistency was also a little on the mushy side. The salad was nothing special but the other appetizer dishes didn't sound too appealing either (cucumber, basil, and tomato gazpacho or honey roasted peaches). But overall, the entree really made up for all the things that the dessert and appetizer lacked. The service also made the dining experience enjoyable with regular check-ups from our waitress and water cups that were almost never left empty. After dining here for their Restaurant Week special I am interested in coming back for a sample of what their regular menu has in store."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/twisted-cork-bistro-omaha-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
