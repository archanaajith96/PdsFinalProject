It was breezy outside so I chose an outside table after ordering inside (I tried paying at the same time but she instructed me to just sit). I ordered tofu pho (I always order beef and just wasn't in the mood), egg rolls and Thai tea over ice. The pho was great and the egg rolls were hot and fresh. All the toppings for the pho were fresh as well. The Thai tea was a bit heavy on the cream side so I asked for a bit more black tea and that helped. The outside seating area was nice and a plus even though its caddy corner to a street with thru traffic I liked it better than inside which seemed hectic and loud (it's very cafeteria style inside). Food was great, service was minimal. I tried asking for a server passing by for the bill and a Togo container and was told to go inside (when I arrived it seemed if I was not \"Togo\" they wanted me sat at a table ordering) that part was confusing and frustrating. I will be back for the food, and bare the service."}, {"review_id": "MVurNefZeY6V1CU5BSQk7g", "user_id": "RnPosmsZyoq2qe8oOyh-kw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "So I've been here twice, both times it was pretty busy (esp during lunch! Holy Moley!)So first time I tried the boba tea and the Vietnamese coffee. The coffee was splendid and the boba tea was good too! So the next time I came it was lunch time during the week, wow was t packed! Barely anywhere to sit but the staff and everyone have such a grasp that is flowed super quickly! I was actually astonished at how efficient they where. Right next to the register was a ton of fresh spring rolls wrapped in packages to go, very easy.I saw 50% of people getting pho, and the rest banh mi's and some other dishes. I decided to go for the pork banh mi. The bread was really crunchy and the pork had a lot of flavor (bbq pork) but there was so much fat on the pork that I honestly couldn't eat it. I had a friend recommend this place but I think I just got the fatty meat (of course just my luck).A friend of mine also tried the egg roll vermicelli and it was very tasty!! Great place, fresh food, 4*!"}, {"review_id": "N6618eIDvkvOwV__AVsJLQ", "user_id": "hNVtdKHZ_qFnw_kjhBaQxg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "Finally an authentic Vietnamese restaurant that is up to par! Delicious food, great portions. I also love that they have prepackaged meals you can take to go. I had the grilled pork Bahn Mi and my gf had their pork fried rice. The prices are incredibly cheap for the portions and the quality. Her fried rice came with big pieces of grilled pork; not teeny tiny cut up pieces. Our waitress wasn't very friendly/pleasant but the service was fast. Decor is simple (kind of reminds me of most furniture you see at a Chinese takeaway). Do yourself a favor and come eat here."}, {"review_id": "k3XMaVXzbP41mHYIYoq4xQ", "user_id": "jB9P3KKPENhK0a2U7wWcmg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "I have been going to this place since it opened so maybe almost 4 years and I've only dined in once. The parking is a bit congested so it can be frustrating at times. Their hours are 8-5pm everyday which is nice because you never have to guess if they're opened or not... (except certain holidays). They have a take out menu to keep and they also cater which I have yet to try. They have a variety of other items on their menu, it's pretty straight forward and normal for a small deli/dine in restaurant. They also offer other pre-items like a variety of spring rolls to choose from, hot buns, black mean sesame balls, Chinese donuts, sweet bean deserts, and more. Weekends, they do offer other dishes that aren't offered during the week like duck bamboo soup, confer & beef stew. Their pho is okay for my liking the one time I did dine in. I really like their grilled pork sandwiches. By far, they have the best banh mi sandwiches in Tampa. Their grilled pork is perfect in flavored and the consistency is spot on. Since they opened, the only difference I've noticed with the banh mi is they changed their sizing in bread but personally, it's all about what's inside. It's a great grab and go lunch for only $3.00. Super tasty for an affordable price. My second favorite item on the menu is their grilled pork with vermicelli noodles without peanuts. Just like the sandwich but with noodles! It's delicious and the proportion for the price is great for $6.50. It's more of a staple item for me when coming here and the young guy knows my order because I always request no peanuts... I have had better and so I will reserve my thoughts on that. Maybe I'll just have to try it again to give my full thoughts. So, as much as I like this place... the restaurant is small with about maybe 15 small tables on the inside, which they have expanded to offer seating on the outside. So you have options of indoor or outdoor seating, but it gets so overly crowded and loud during lunch time so I avoid it all together. Sometimes I hear people yelling over each other and that's not really pleasant for me. Like most vietnamese restaurants, I feel like I get 1 second to look at the menu before getting asked what I want. As a vietnamese person myself, I am familiar with the types of dishes they serve but I feel bad for my BF because he gets so flustered and rushed to order something that it's usually not what he intended. And last but not least, first impression & customer service is so important to me... with that said, I would like to see the employees have a more personable and inviting approach rather than a so robotic \"hi what do you want... your total is\". That is my reason behind the 4 star... but of course it's all about the food right? Enjoy!"}, {"review_id": "LH7GoxfZpifLIo8LH4ae3g", "user_id": "ZvqquNxMFVP3gLSCenVEow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I've visited twice now as I have finally gotten there before they close!

We did chicken banh me the first time and the pork the 2nd.  The pork was by far the better choice.  2 fresh rolls, 2 banh mi sandwiches, and the vermicelli salad was 20!

(Definitely did not feel weak or tired after this broth!) There's so much meat in here! Maybe I'm too used getting cheap out by viet restaurants in Orlando but this place gives you more than one chunk of meatballs! I had like 4 or 5 big chunks of meatballs here! (Big size meatballs!)They don't give the cheap parts or skim down the meats!The noodles are made just right and gives you a good portion.Viet coffee is pretty cheap too; 2! Pretty good coffee. I noticed my other friends' bowls (chicken pho, tofu pho, beef stew with egg noodles, and pho with rare medium slice beef/pho tai) have a pretty good amount of the meat portion and noodles! There's a lot of food already made on the side near the register. Pick them up (and pay) when you get hungry later on :) This place definitely gives you more value than what you paid for!

The Grilled Pork over rice was just ok. It's more like thin slices of Chinese BBQ and it wasn't that good. Pieces were too thin, over cooked or grilled and dried out. Also have the Spring Rolls which were done already and they just brought it over wrapped in plastic. I believe people just come over and pick them up and run. It was decent, average with shrimp and pork inside. The bubble tea was horrible! Sorry but the Apple Tea was blended and wasn't cold. They just added ice to cool it down and so not for me. I asked the waitress numerous times if it was milk based or tea based and couldn't get an answer from her. We went around quite a few times and decided to take a gamble. Well it was left on the table when we left. Lots of Asians here eating so it must be good. For me, I may have ordered the wrong thing so maybe pho is their specialty.

This place is always bustling anytime I go - it's popularity goes to show how great it is. Because it's so busy, you may need to park in the grassy lot nearby (you'll most likely see other cars parked there as well). My go-to items is the Grilled Pork Bahn Mi and the Avocado Smoothie Boba. Bahn Mi is a sandwich on a French roll with meat, fresh cilantro, fresh jalapeños, and pickled daikon and carrots. There bread is the freshest I've had! And they put the perfect ratio of sandwich fillings - just enough savory meat, fresh veggies, spicy jalapeño, and pickled bite. One Sandwich is definitely enough to fill a very hungry person, half a sandwich for a small/medium meal. All for about $4.00! The perfect pairing to cool the heat from the jalapeño is the Avocado Smoothie Boba. Essentially it's a blend of fresh avocado, ice, and a mix of some kind of dairy and sweetener. The result is a creamy, cool, unique flavor profile that complements the strong flavors of the Bahn Mi. It's a perfect pairing!"}, {"review_id": "DKX-c5cIXSvm_wp2wDk-XA", "user_id": "TDQuFUn2r9_AWnzTj-Mh8Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/18/2017", "text": "In terms of all the pho restaurants I've tried in Tampa Bay, hands down 5 stars for food taste and value. Ive  been aching to try this place for soooo long!!! Omg it's been a good 2 years now I kid you not! Why did it  take me so long? Well for one I already had a pho spot down the street from me that I've been dining at 4 years now, that consistently makes great quality pho, and has FRESH SQUEEZED real lime juice limeade I so love. Saigon is only open until 5pm. Especially  on the weekends, the place is packed to the max during the ideal lunch  hours of noon to 1:30. I only have a hour lunch break  and the commute alone would be 30 minutes so I've never wanted to risk it for lunch. But this past week I've been under the weather , and  all I wanted to eat was soup. My usual  go to place, Pho An Hoa is closed Wednesdays. Desperate I decided to try Saigon but strategically planned to go for a very late lunch at 2:15, which is unusual for me. My coworkers who always frequent Saigon  warned me about the intense lunch rush! One  would say you need to get there and be seated by 11:30 the latest or  I'd have to opt for grab and go at the checkout line. I thought if I had the pho to go for the 1st time I would not think the quality was great. When we got there at 2:15 the restaurant had maybe 5 tables seated. Our food came out in 5 mins!  I got the steak pho for 6 dollars (trust me the size is more than plenty), and the pork banh mi sandwich (3 dollars). Let me just say you know a menu item is so damn good when you're coworker tells you to order her 3 to go! My coworker I went with, ordered 1 and decided to get a 2nd to go!  He order his with the egg on top and when he was eating it I was drooling and had order regret to not have added a runny egg. There was a right amount of pickled veggies went so perfect with the sweetness of the thin sliced pork! I even ate mine leftover and still thought it was amazing! Haven't had a banh mi in years! Pho is the best I've had. Broth was so deep and flavorful. Not too oily and the cuts of beef were lean and free of tendon. But let me tell you, those rice noodles we're the best I've had hands down! They seemed thinner than what I usually eat  but not too thin and smooth yet chewy. There was a bit of language barrier between us and our server, English was very broken, so we had a bit of trouble trying to understand her and get our order right. The limeade was a bit of a disappointment as it did not taste like fresh squeezed limes were used. Tasted artificial and I needed to add a little water to it to tone down the artificial tasting tartness. Did they use a lemonade powder mix or something? My coworker really liked his taro smoothie with bubba. I took a grab n go shrimp spring roll and pork spring roll for later. My boyfriend tried it and said it was pretty good. The pork he said was a little sweet for him. I can tell from looking at it the same style of pork in the banh mi is used in the spring rolls which Is a plus for me! Usually the pork in spring rolls are pretty plain at other places. I ordered 1 pork banh mi, small steak pho, limeade, and two spring rolls and my total was only 16 dollars!"}, {"review_id": "8ySwFKI-OpmDxm9d8nFpag", "user_id": "uKKlENg7gUHID4OLbzMuGQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "First impression-filthy!
