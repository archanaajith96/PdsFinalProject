To make life easier for you, just park at Cogan's or close by and realize that if you are standing on Colley facing Cogan's, it's to the left. If you see a 4' fence, that's the entrance.When you go in, you'll notice that it embroiders the idea of small town/home feel. The sandwiches here are  awesome. If you want a solid good meal with good service and little complication - this is your place.If I lived closer or went to school at ODU, I could see myself becoming a frequent customer since it's so tasty and reasonable. I love the idea of keeping it simple, wholesome, completed with great service.If you're in the area and if this is your mood, go here!

I started out looking for something we had not tried before on Yelp.  After looking at the reviews and the menu Sam's Texas Sub Shop was the clear winner.  So we set out for what we hope will be a tasty lunch.So walking in the place is warm and friendly we look over the colorful chalk board on the wall to make our sandwich choices.  I went with the Black and Blu while me friend had The Beast.  We were both extremely happy with the choices we made.  The Brisket on the Black and Blu had just enough spice and was a nice lean cut not fatty at all.  Blu Cheese added a great flavor.  The Beast my friend had was reported as great and we both really had an enjoyable time here.  The staff working seemed friendly enough and it seems they have quite a few regulars because the others that came in while we were there all chatted like they are old friends not just customers.  Over all this was worth the drive from Virginia Beach just to have something new and we hope to return again."}, {"review_id": "aByl7HoMclx0Yi1qRn13dg", "user_id": "hSxebSgCdrfNdgMClObDEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Wonderful little shop on Colley.

The food is amazing right along with the staff!!! My favorite sandwhich is the Black and Blue (I personally add provolone cheese, green and sweet peppers). It gives It that extra kicker  one other thing is I do not like meat balls but, for some reason their meat ball sandwhich is amazing also thats a must try!

Toasted bread, high quality cuts of meat, especially the brisket. They have a good selection of sandwiches, but not so many that's its overwhelming and difficult to make a choice. The portions are large, so be aware that you may only need a 1/2 sub. Everyday they have an 8.99$ full sub, side and drink combo. The brisket, if it's your 1st trip is a must. YOU. MUST. ORDER. BRISKET. They have several brisket on bread offerings. This is a Texas, sub shop after all. On your second trip, get whatever your little heart desires, except the chilli, that's not where they make their money. The meatball sub is outa this region good.The owners are the employees and this place is small business all day, if you're into that sort of thing."}, {"review_id": "sFM_L3VT2qgkJ-zM_q9dZA", "user_id": "ztJACmoETv0wa2Dzh6NSsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "Great subs, great staff, great atmosphere!

It's a very cute restaurant with pictures all around showcasing people with Sam's shirts on in different places. It has a home-y vibe and the staff was really friendly. I came here for a quick lunch with Raymond and it was quick, yummy, and fresh! I ordered the special of the day - a foot long Carolina BBQ sub with the coleslaw on the side and chips. Raymond made his own customized sub with brisket, lettuce, BBQ sauce, and provolone cheese. Our food came out hot and were really good portion sizes. My sub came with vinegar on the side, but I enjoyed it with their signature BBQ sauce and their slaw added a nice, fresh crunch to my sub. As for Raymond's sub, he was quiet for a good ten minutes because he was just devouring it! Even though I only ate half of the sub and was stuffed, I couldn't resist getting their gigantic chocolate chip cookie and their multilayered brownie. I have such a big sweet tooth and the desserts were the bomb.com. My favorite was the cookie - it was soft and a great mixture of different chocolates in every bite. The brownie was good, but there was a lot going on. It had Oreos, peanut butter cookies, and a sort of graham cracker crust on the bottom - sweetness overload for me! We will definitely be stopping by here in the future to try their other subs! If you're craving a good, filling sandwich and some yummy dessert for later, please do yourself a favor and try this place!"}, {"review_id": "Ozhan3n5ou4ZeISW46EM6g", "user_id": "8X3rXph2N_nhTb8iQ_xMMA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/12/2017", "text": "This place is really good.

Sure it's easy to make. A bunch of meats, vegetables, condiments, and bread. A trained monkey can make one. But only a true artist and lover of food can transform a simple sub sandwich into a meal that you crave.It's a little hard to find, but if you walk right up to Cogan's North and lean to the left you'll see it.  Not a lot of room to sit, but they also have a small outdoor area in front where you can chow down on a nice day.  Once you walk in you are always quickly greeted and treated like you're a regular.We shared the Meatball and Beast subs.  The meatballs are huge.  The Meatball sub is heavy.  If you left it wrapped up and had to defend yourself from an attacker with it, you could deliver some decent damage with it.  Lovingly blanketed with cheese and sauce, it is almost guaranteed to make you take a nap after you eat it.  The same goes for the Beast.  It's a great combo of beef, bacon, and cheese with horseradish mayo.  All the subs are about $8-$10 and very reasonably priced for the amount of food you receive.Like I said, these subs are craveable.  I try to go here a couple of times a month.  If do the same, get a sub card and you get a free sub after your 10th purchase.  I think I'm due for my freebie after my next visit.Big heavy sub sandwiches at a great price.  Hell yeah."}, {"review_id": "U0xdTOTYeYjdqqXk9mNu1g", "user_id": "C5Um6BVkg2krza8Caj6aSg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/10/2017", "text": "I enjoyed it.  The owners are super nice.  Place is a good sandwich shop.  We had the Black & Blue & the Southwest with their made there macaroni & potato salads.  The sides were great.  I didn't enjoy the sandwiches as much as everyone else seems to.  The Black & Blue was good...   I think I just have too much smoked brisket though and so had that flavor in mind...  it was good, just not as good as I expected.  The Southwest tasted fresh and was good, but not exceptional.  The chicken lacked flavor with ours.  It might just have been an off day for them...   even with the sandwiches being good without being exceptional I'd still go back.  They do serve beer, wine,and fresh squeezed Mimosas...   which I missed when I was there."}, {"review_id": "UzpslnipeUoShIYvp0ZiMg", "user_id": "MBvFUtbIb8Ur_BtNCwLCeQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/23/2017", "text": "This place is little and cute.  The food is really yummy.  The southwest sandwich was good,  but the Homemade BBQ was incredible.  And the traditional Italian,  which is my son's favorite anywhere we go, was spot on.  The macaroni salad is good and has a vinegar-y tang.  The potato salad was excellent and tasted a tiny bit like curry.
