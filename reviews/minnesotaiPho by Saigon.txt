What it does not have is good pho. Or at least that was my feeling before eating at iPho. Pho is always going to have some level of personal preference to it. For example my fiance likes a sweeter broth and doesn't mind the taste of anise being front and center in a broth. I prefer a less muddy broth that is flavored more with bones and the natural fattiness that comes from a long slow braise and that is exactly what I found here. Some jalapenos amd maybe a squeeze of lime is all I ever use to dress this up. * If you are a fan of tendon and tripe be sure to ask for extra in the P1 as it is scarce otherwise*The other kicker here are the Bahn Mi sandwiches. They consistently run out so get there early. I think there is a buy 4 get 1 free deal but don't quote me on that. The staff is always friendly and quick. A solid go to in town and by far my favorite pho in the state."}, {"review_id": "SkQA5bv78mzogA1B7241gQ", "user_id": "FCgNAvNpFG3GCC0UqJl82w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "My favourite place to get pho. Fast customer service, yummy American Viet(kinda) food at such a great price. Even their regular size is big enough for two! Makes great for lunch the next day. You know they are an awesome place when they separate the noodle from the broth in your leftover pho!

It's actually a pretty large restaurant that serves Pho and your typical accompanying Vietnamese dishes like Banh Mi, egg rolls, etc.On the day we ordered the specialty pho, spring rolls, and egg and rice noodle soup. I only tried the broth of the pho, but it was pretty decent, decently flavored! Savory, but maybe too salty for my tastes. My own dish was the rice and egg noodle soup, which I liked. The broth was a little different, less salty, light, a bit aromatic with the greens, but not 'WOW' or standout... :( The egg noodles were not bad and I liked the combination the restaurant and menu offered. The spring rolls were a little bit of a disappointment though,  as they weren't very tasty, seemed to have too much noodles, and the meat inside wasn't well-flavored (maybe even a little dry). The spring roll wrap also seemed to be a bit overdone and too soft and sticky.The service was extremely quick though not great/attentive (they didn't ask or provide water refills) though that's something I expect from a 'fast food' type Asian restaurant. Overall not bad, but definitely there's better places to eat Pho in the Twin Cities you can find if you look around."}, {"review_id": "_Qg4oqzkbD_1C0v9tMBNBQ", "user_id": "XUhmgUzVTesVF6gkclEx3g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "You would think that a place called iPho would have amazing pho, and thankfully, this place didn't disappoint! I ordered Pho Sài Gòn Ðc Bit, which is the Saigon Special Pho in regular, but I swear that two people could split that bowl easily. The soup was delectable, not too sweet and not too bland, with the right amount of nuanced flavor that kept me slurping spoonful after spoonful. There were plenty of other goodies included - beef flank, brisket, tripe, tendon, and meat balls, and of course, a full plate of thai basil, bean sprouts, jalapeños, and lime wedges for your adding pleasure.In addition, we ordered some banh mi to take home, and opted to try two different sandwiches, Bánh Mì Tht and Bánh Mì Đc Bit. Both were okay, but nothing to write home about. The price was great - can't beat \"buy 3 get 1 free\", but stick to the pho if you're visiting here for a dine-in experience. The service was quick and speedy, with multiple servers checking in on us, and there were plenty of tables to seat the Friday night crowd. There is a small parking lot on the side of the restaurant, and the wait is never too long. If you're feeling a great meal for a good price, make iPho your next stop."}, {"review_id": "WYRqFsGi5sn37aaVD47BDA", "user_id": "BPa__Zs1cfH0OQc2m1Avcw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "They make it easy to become a regular.

This place was my go to when I was in college. My roommates and I always ended up here the day after a night out. Plus there's a parking lot, yessss!The staff is awesome here! Once seated, the waiter is attentive and friendly, quick to drop by and grab your order which I appreciate. The pho comes out quick and is pretty good, but can occasionally be on the salty side. I judge a pho broth by the clarity of it and while theirs isn't super clear, it's pretty flavorful! The only thing I am not a huge fan of is that they cut their meatballs into thin slices. The regular size is decently sized, I tried to emulate Mulan and defeat my hunger with the x-large size and was sadly defeated.I love that they have a banh mi counter! Super easy to grab on my lunch break at work and also great food to bring to the airport! At $3.50 for banh mi, you can't go wrong.Overall, iPho is a great place to eat. I definitely recommend trying it!"}, {"review_id": "GlcR2K2m0Ifc4Gms4YRX1Q", "user_id": "W81O9S-6bovV62apUNHQvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/5/2017", "text": "The pho here is as real as you can get. This may be my favorite pho place in Minneapolis, and I believe it's rather underrated. The service is incredibly quick and friendly. I was craving pho before my flight and was nervous I'd be late. However, we received our dishes in less than 5 minutes and I scarfed it down because it was so tasty. I got their brisket and flank pho and finished every bite. The servings are huge and cheap. I would say that the pho compares to the pho I ate in Vietnam. The atmosphere was similar as well."}, {"review_id": "SfUIcwLsyhJaSHw-t6YLHQ", "user_id": "xixX3_Ai9ujo33xq1_Dugg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/5/2017", "text": "Home of the 10 POUND PHO Challenge. 45 Minutes to complete, if you lose it's $20.. which is still a great deal for the amount of food.It's essentially three of their largest \"jumbo\" bowls.The pho here is their specialty so they can make this in seconds so the food service time are super fast!The menu items are all really good bang for the buck.

Pho is okay. Small portion, not a lot of meat.  Flavor is okay, nothing special or worth remembering.The only thing I really remember about this place were the banh mi sandwiches...buy three, get one free.  It's a deal.  But they weren't that good.  I've never had a worthy banh mi sandwich since I've had the ones they used to serve at Asian Village in Fresno in the 1990's.  Like some kind of secret recipe was lost or something. It's like no one knows how to make a banh mi sandwich anymore.  SMH.Anyways the  banh mi, I didn't like, because they were not slathered in the sauce, mayo or whatever condiments people usually put in there.  They were DRY.  Like, with no condiments.  So that kind of spoiled my hopes.   I took them home and my SIL says she likes it when they don't put the sauce on.  HUHHHHhhhh?  I guess some people like it plain?"}, {"review_id": "ISPloIcs9xvmnwOSfJ95mg", "user_id": "LCsS8gusfGNWnnU4ZyLPCg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/2/2017", "text": "I've had tastier pho (I like Saigon Palace and Wok in the Park for different reasons), but you should probably try this place. The chicken pho I had was heavy on the noodles and had chunky, pre-cooked chicken pieces that didn't taste that good. We also had some wontons which had a less than ideal cheese-to-crisp ratio, but I liked the sauce it came with. But you get a LOT OF FOOD for a very, very low price. And my friends really liked what they got, which included a chicken noodle salad which really looked great. And my friend who'd been there before knowingly got the \"kid size\" pho which looked like it would satisfy all but the hungriest slurpers of pho. If you're thinking, \"if they don't charge very much for their food, then it must not be very good,\" then you will be pleasantly surprised if you do the right thing and give this place a try.The service deserves a very special mention. iPho has a bustle to it because they do very brisk business in take-out. In particular, despite the name of the restaurant, they seem to have popular banh-mi sandwiches, because they have a separate line for that. (I should probably point out that my friend who has been here before ordered some take-out to enjoy later in the weekend.) But as busy as this place was, everyone was being attended to with urgency, professionalism, and charisma. Our food came shockingly quickly, and they were very, very much on top of checking on us throughout our visit. Our server did seem to prefer ordering by number, for what it's worth.I am definitely going to return here, but note that they are closed on Mondays, only open until 7 on Sundays, and until 8 the rest of the week."}, {"review_id": "Mu3T3mGwCruhMTezfzI-TQ", "user_id": "pwlBAIyKyA5m7nMf3WGbnQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "I love their grilled pork spring rolls and banh mi sandwiches!

The bread at iPho is suuuper flakey! I would take bites and some of the crunchy crust crumbs would fly across to the other side of the table! I like this kind of texture but if you don't like crumbs, I'd stay away from this place.After eating I ended up leaving my bag at the restaurant and after realizing it, I went back and they had it waiting for me behind the counter.
