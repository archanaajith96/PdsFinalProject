It's been far too long since we've seen each other. I visited Bru a few years back when it first made it's way to Mass Ave, but somehow cannot remember much about my food. Bad sign. However, I had the chance to stop in again before a show and was very satisfied. Bru is located right on the corner of N. Alabama and Mass Ave, right next to the Starbucks. When the weather makes its mind up, sitting outside to dine would be a perfect choice. It's a little weird to get into the restaurant when you walk up, as the front door is actually around on the side of the building past the outdoor seating. Minor details, however. During my visit, we did not wait long to be seated - maybe about 15 minutes. They can text you when your table is ready so you're not stuck waiting if you'd like to go and explore for a bit. I personally didn't like being smushed in a corner by the front door, but I was on a schedule so I couldn't complain much. It seems like the place is always packed when I go. It was pretty packed for a Sunday evening. Our server was a pretty cool guy. He was very helpful as far as recommending drinks and food options and I was grateful for that. The menu is good, with \"chef\" burger options as well as classic options and beef burger alternatives. I decided to go with the Bru Burger, which has tallegio cheese and tomato jam as some of the non standard options. Immediately, our server informed me about the taste of tallegio cheese and I was glad he did. I wasn't in the mood to be explorative that day so ended up with Swiss instead. When I tell you that this burger was so tasty, I mean it! So flavorful, hot, juicy and worth the calories! I ate every last bit. The house made ketchup I was not really a fan of, but I did try it. Fries were excellent. I consider myself a fry connoisseur and these were up to par. Oh, and did I mention the peach margarita? Yummmmm!"}, {"review_id": "33aEH2LM_k1c11c74MB7gA", "user_id": "Cy0UWt36ec2haPOoo-A_iQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "My girlfriends and I came here for lunch on a Sunday, we waited about 20 minutes which wasn't bad.

The place was busy, but they had plenty of room at the bar. The location is great and the ambience in the restaurant​ was great too. A good bustle that you'd expect from a popular restaurant.  I'd heard good things about their burgers (of course!) and wanted to try something unique. The bartender made a quick recommendation with the Provencal burger and I was sold. It took about 10 minutes for the burger to get to me from the time I put in the order and it tasted yum!! Not like a... oh this tastes nice kind of a yum. More like a... It's been 5 hours since I had that burger and I'm still thinking about it kind of a yum. In one word, I'd say that this experience was memorable. The price was decent for a yummy burger. I'd go back. P.s.: When you order the burger, you only get a burger - no sides. The bartender let me know when I put in the order, but I just didn't want you to be surprised."}, {"review_id": "5TMbfpHR5GWOpb89nEDk6g", "user_id": "7dpsoMjrsPhUh8zg_2C4BA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "I've been here a few times now, all good experiences. The staff is friendly & attentive, as you'd expect from any Cunningham restaurant. And the food is pretty tasty, nothing to shout about but definitely a nice, casual and affordable meal out. Honestly I think the homemade ketchup is my favorite thing I've tasted from Bru. VERY good, but I'm a sucker for homemade condiments. Get that name-brand ketchup bottle off my table, please. K, thanks. :)  Anyways.. back to it. My last visit I tried the Portobello Sandwich with onion rings. O-rings are GIANT, definitely try them when you go. And be prepared to walk away with a belly ache because you'll want to eat the whole plate. I've also tasted the bbq chicken nachos (A+) and the snack burger (yum). Oh! And how can I forget the milkshakes? Classic and creamy delicious. Get a milkshake to go, you won't regret it."}, {"review_id": "WO2QPscFCQgGgWtlO0a6qQ", "user_id": "Q9bPSt15Y1aQNFq0wegf5A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "This place can get pretty busy... this is largely because it is usually rated as one of the best burger joints in Indianapolis.   There is a pretty good beer selection.   But what you really want to hear about are the burgers.  I had the lamb burger--not very traditional, I know.   But if you like lamb, you'll enjoy this burger.  It's not gamey--as can happen with restaurants that don't know how to buy and prepare lamb, and it's not dry.  The tzastziki  sauce was a little heavy, but it served its purpose adding a tangy contrast to the meat.   The bun was a little heavy IMO.  The onion rings were hand breaded and not too oily."}, {"review_id": "sYvI6Sd-bJDUsPN3nda1vA", "user_id": "p7ad3fpUlkZ6hfyM51JaaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "One of my favorite places on Mass Ave, and coming from a vegetarian, that says something! Great atmosphere, consistently good service, and superb food. It honestly doesn't get better than that. I've tried the veggie burger (my fav!) and several salads. All have been very good and satisfying.  I'd say prices are reasonable for downtown and in summer, it's worth the wait to sit outdoor on the patio. Be aware though there will most likely ALWAYS been a wait to sit out there! Do it! Even though the restaurant is large, it is normally pretty packed. Each time I have been, we have been lucky to be seated pretty quickly but I know with larger groups, sometimes the wait can be long on weekends and holidays.As always, with any place on Mass Ave, be prepared parking may be a challenge.

I went in with really high expectations so maybe that was my downfall. I got their turkey burger that is Indian inspired. I felt the curry to be far too overpowering and lost sight of the natural flavors of the turkey. I even really like Indian food, it was just too eccentric for me.I also, tried my boyfriend'd burger. He had the classic Bru Burger. And this is where I think I am the exception to the rule. The burger tasted like a farm.... I think most people attribute that flavor to freshness or a farm to fork experience. However, it is not for me. Also, I thought the menu items to be a bit pricey since they don't include a side at all. I know it sounds like I'm slamming on them here (which I'm not trying to do) I am just personally not a fan."}, {"review_id": "nFkB4lXtm0qlHlTqnM4ONQ", "user_id": "qm6WVOID2j4qJ_M-BrrgHg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/10/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Decided to give Bru Burger another shot.  Absolutely never coming back.  I've never had such a terrible evening.  The wait for a table is absolutely ridiculous, ended up having to hangout in the hallways of the building connecting because this place is so overcrowded.  They don't take reservations (which is ridiculous to start with and could ease up on the congestion) and their rules on half of your party being there BEFORE you put your name on the 2 hour long wait list is beyond the worst.Food-cold and bland.

It's not a bad place to get a burger at all, but there are other spots that offer higher quality food for the same price.I was there with some coworkers and the place was very busy. We ended up having to split up into two different tables so that we wouldn't have to wait. Not a huge deal. That's what happens at peak lunch hours!Our server was generally good once she got to the table the first time. Being greeted took a bit longer then I would have liked, but it is what it is. Like I said, they were busy and after this she did very well.I got the Garlic Three Cheese Burger and fries. The burger had a good amount of flavor and I loved the whole cloves of garlic on it. The cheese however was no where near melted which really messed with the texture of the burger. The fries were just meh. They were a bit cold and grainy inside so I didn't really enjoy them that much. I did really love the homemade ketchup! That made the fries worthwhile!Overall, I will not be in a hurry to get back here.

You would think being greeted with a smile by everyone you encounter working at an establishment should be the standard, but it's not necessarily the case everywhere you go. Hands down every time I have walked into Bru I have been greeted with a warm, friendly smile. The food is great. There is something for everyone. I find myself coming here a lot during lunch for one of my favorite salads, the Valencia. SO good!  But obviously they are known for their burgers.

Ended up at Bru Burger Bar on a Friday night at 7:00 or so. Place was packed but after a short 20 minute wait or so we were fortunate enough to be seated in a section attended to by the very friendly Ms. Sierra.Sierra, for starters, was completely on top of taking care of everyone in our section and had our drinks to us before we could even begin to work our way through the menu. Plenty of specialty burgers and sandwiches to choose from here to match anyone's tastes. We opted for the Bru Burger and the Double Bacon Burger (see pics) with sides of fries and onion rings.  Even though the place was super busy, they had our food to us in a respectable amount of time. Sierra kept checking back with us to see if our drinks needed refilled and I had mine topped off at least once without me even noticing she had came by.Both burgers were fantastic and we could not decide whether the fries or the onion rings were better as they were both unbelievably good. Sierra checked back with us a couple of times throughout the meal, ensured we had everything we needed, and was quick to bring some extra sauce for my coworkers burger When he asked for some additional on the side.Phalo, the manager, made a point of saying hello to us on our way out and asking how everything was. From where I was sitting I was able to see that he did this with every customer.All in all a great experience.  Thank you for that Bru Burger management and staff !i"}, {"review_id": "QEqOpvz3SvOBU-VhVg1-Xg", "user_id": "aRdO2gkzbDDyun1JUyuT4Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "You will most likely have a wait.

They have good burgers, great fries, good salad (a little small). I got shrimp on top and it could of been cooked a little longer. We got in and out in thirty minutes. The hostess was more on top of our table than our waiter. My husband ordered the burger without a bun and it came with a bun, which isn't a huge deal but makes me nervous to bring someone with allergies because a simple request can cause big problems. The burgers do not come with fries, you need to order separate, but worth it. The nachos are great. I would recommend those as an appetizer.

For a place that specializes in burgers, I expected more finesse and attention to detail from my visits here. The ground beef seemed to lack seasoning. When I ordered the garlic three cheese burger, the cheeses never melted and instead were three separate solid layers. I also expected to taste more garlic. Prior to that I'd ordered the bourbon burger, which was ok (bacon makes everything better). Much to my dismay, I also learned that their french fries aren't made in-house and frozen prior to being served.All in all, if you're really in the mood for a burger and you're on Mass Ave, check them out.
