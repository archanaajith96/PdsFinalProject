With crispy, fried wonton chips, grilled summer veggies, and salty-sweet Asian spices, these nachos easily became the most mouth-watering appetizer I've ever shoved into my body.Our server was friendly and attentive, the beer selection included favorites from local breweries, and even though we lost MISERABLY at weekly trivia, I still find myself mustering up enough courage to return to Me & Billy. It's that good."}, {"review_id": "jcl7tKI3ET1q4H8k662NQg", "user_id": "mcLrVGlNKO6NUbXhbIHtFQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "What a cute place! We got seated immediately by a friendly hostess, we were greeted by the server quickly, we ordered with a few questions that were answered and then we waited and waited for our food. The cook time was the only reason we didn't give 5 stars. It was a pleasant atmosphere so we weren't majorly upset about it. And when the food got to the table it was wonderful! We ate a cheeseburger with house made fries and the kid chicken strips with a house salad. We ordered the almost banana cream pie too! The owner (Billy) came around to make sure you left with a positive experience. We will definitely return!   A side tip from my point of view only is that the city water here does not taste good if you are not from this area. Bring a bottled water or for sure order a beverage."}, {"review_id": "U1qZvCflxcWvKmKpYm87ag", "user_id": "RBCmYQMD6DfMGV68t2VXfw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "My favorite spot in Davenport! As others have said, the inside décor is very elegant and welcoming. The staff takes that a step further and are professional and accommodating. The food doesn't disappoint either. The Bison Burger is my go-to and they have several appealing sides to pick from.Good tap beer selection as well as a variety of signature cocktails. This is the place to go if you're looking for something more than just a typical meal out. The owners are very friendly and you'll regularly see them conversing with the guests and doing whatever to make the experience memorable"}, {"review_id": "hJjl9y8_fpwNg7nbNtiWlw", "user_id": "KvZDkmhyptcfxGfKAqLpZA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "Came here for lunch and it was decorated for St. Patrick's Day. The inside is very casual. We started with the cheese curds and you could tell right away they weren't generic frozen bought cheese curds. They were crispy and the cheese was great. Our waitress was awesome very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered the Bison Burger cooked medium rare. The burger was tasty. Had a hint of gaminess which I don't mind. The only thing I was was for the fries to be a bit crispier. Even the owner came by to ask us how our food was. Everyone seemed very nice.

Additionally, the bartenders, wait staff, and hostess were very friendly and welcoming. The atmosphere is really cool. The reason for the 3/5 stars stems from receiving an undercooked medium bison burger. I ate almost half hoping I hit a more redder spot than normal, but had to quit once I noticed how rare it was from the red juice (blood). I cook bison burgers frequently and know it appears redder than beef, but I know red juice is rare.I will give this place another go as I loved the bison burger's taste until I had to quit, next time I'm going medium-well."}, {"review_id": "kyoDtDcTow1b02fnsRzB4w", "user_id": "kr_7EGtrbvnXZ0yieK92YQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Excellent food here.

On a Wednesday evening, there were large groups celebrating a graduation, couples on dates, and groups of friends partaking in half price beer specials and trivia night that started at 8 p.m.We opted to start with the watermelon salad ($10) which was heavy on watermelon chunks and light on arugula. While the granola added an interesting flavor twist, I felt it unnecessary as I'm not a huge granola fan often preferring savory to sweet. However, the feta cheese crumbles added a nice creamy element that I would welcome again. Would it be weird to start eating my watermelon at home with feta crumbles? Mayhaps.On the recommendation of our waitress, we ordered the shrimp and grits ($18). Cheesy grits, topped with the corn-kale concoction served with cooked-to-perfection shrimp with a maple syrup drizzle. This entree is the best thing I've eaten this year. While well presented, it's the kind of eat-it-out-of-a-bowl-in-my-PJs-on-the-couch meals you would crave if you wanted to eat your feelings. I imagine the burgers were also good, judging by the other folks in the establishment who ordered burgers, but I secretly questioned their choice knowing that what I was eating was so flippin' good.Located on the corner with a small outdoor patio area, the people watching provides entertainment that will distract you from the sadness that overtakes you as a result of the empty plate. Service is a bit casual, so on the slower side, but we probably need more of these moments where we can just be and not rush off to the next thing."}, {"review_id": "w0drBiEQQYTPZ1ntQrt7oA", "user_id": "1b7unEatImzCkPLGqYoGBg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Hands down the best place I've been to in the Quad Cities.  I had the Beef Short Rib last week and it was damn good!  I couldn't get enough of it!  Stopped by there tonight and had the Dirty Bird and was wowed again!  Great atmosphere with a decent selection of some local brews on tap.  I hear this is one of the best places to get a burger too so I may have to stop by before heading home later this week."}, {"review_id": "E8xTlXyOruejVA6vTWkXwg", "user_id": "LTc3a0PxnbAJoy-5E-HF7A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/13/2017", "text": "Billy and I had a great time Midwest hospitality on point on this side of the Mississippi-- (Iowa)Confirmed: The Dirty Bird does NOT have liver in the gravy."}, {"review_id": "fpwmE54dNUxeba5pYxJOOw", "user_id": "Ao2VYIw9AMKOTiCUwe_T9A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2017", "text": "Had a nice meal at Me & Billy.  Loved the bar and the restaurant atmosphere.  Tons of good window seats along the sidewalk in this corner business.  Nice place to eat, drink and people watch!  I had a great burger, done perfectly with a nice 'over easy' egg on top.  Usually I'm not really a big dessert guy, but for some reason I tried one this night, and I was glad I did!  It was  some type of chocolate cake and it was great."}, {"review_id": "FgEfftZjz_8UM8CJpf68fg", "user_id": "EeQHrDosMk-ZJ_6_5PazCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I have gone back to me and Billy a lot more times since writing my first review in 2014 and they have improved so much! I think I may have been a bit quick to review a new restaurant, whereas nowadays I always give it a few months!A few faves of mine- the shrimp and grits, the pork nachos, their burgers.... delicious! They also have a great selection of cocktails, wine, and draft beer- something for everyone!I've attended a few parties in their private room and they're always beautifully executed with delicious food! The bbq bourbon meatballs and the cheese plate were my fave! No Colby jack on this bad boy, we're talking Brie, goat cheese, Boursin.... THE WORKS! Additionally I had been planning to come here for my boyfriends mothers birthday which happened to be smack dab in the middle of a \"Whole 30\". That basically means abstaining from all delicious foods. I typically wouldn't go out to eat but can't ALWAYS avoid it... I hate being \"that\" person I messaged Me & Billy the morning of the dinner with my restrictions and an entree and salad I was thinking of ordering. I asked if there were any hidden ingredients and if I'd be sticking to my plan with that order. They messaged back that same day with suggestions and didn't make me feel like the psycho I am for asking. We ended up not going because his mom and Dad both got sick- but now I know I can come back anytime during the rest of my Whole30 and actually order something!Give this place a try!"}, {"review_id": "L3Ud-ieiLsnqbY3MvZyjNQ", "user_id": "INUCyRXn9NM3qffNLl372A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "Stopped into Me & Billy for lunch last week and being that I partner with restaurants implementing an automated cooking oil management system, I had to try the pork tenderloin...Not good for my waist I know but I always eat something fried...it's my job and allows me valued insight to a restaurant's oil management habits while enjoying a meal to boot.  As I told Mary, the owner, when I was done eating, I don't typically write Yelp reviews but I had to leave a review for this experience.  The tenderloin was thicker than your average pounded out loin and had a perfectly seasoned and fried crispy breading to die for served between a pretzel bun.  I love tenderloins and am not an expert by any means but this one was my favorite and will be a lunch staple any time I'm visiting the Quads for business.   If you're in the Quads and haven't tried the tenderloin from Me & Billy, do yourself a favor and do so.  You wont be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "VAki_ppUpEEIYKfmoiRwxg", "user_id": "VAecd3y2donBRwti3criOg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "This is my go to place anytime for lunch or dinner.

The ONLY reason I'm giving one star is because of the hostess. There was a middle aged woman with glasses sitting at the front.

Me & Billy is for sure one of the better restaurants in our area!I had a hard time choosing what to pick off of the menu and eventually selected the Salmon Sammie. It was an excellent combination of flavors. Somebody else in my party ordered Pommes Frites as an appetizer and they were delicious - as far as the flavor and creativity of the toppings goes. I was not a huge fan of the french fries by themselves. They seemed a little chewy.  Our waitress, Rayven, was awesome. She was nice and did a really great job balancing attentiveness and leaving-us-alone-ivness. The interior is...blah, though they tried to hide it under cover of darkness.
