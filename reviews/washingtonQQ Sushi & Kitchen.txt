My husband and I celebrated our eleventh wedding anniversary here last Saturday afternoon for lunch, at the recommendation of a friend. The food is incredible, fresh, and innovative. We tried three rolls and a jalapeno appetizer. Fortunately, the amazing food quality and presentation matched the service we received.The manager, Nick, greeted us right away with a complimentary two-piece starter and a brief overview of the restaurant. He later overheard us debating wine selection and jumped in to offer helpful suggestions. He also described a few of QQ's most loved rolls, all of which we tried and thoroughly enjoyed. Just as we thought we experienced one of the best lunches since moving here from Vegas, Nick brought out a white chocolate rasberry cheesecake for our special day.If you have ever left a meal immeasurably satisfied, you will understand how we felt last Saturday leaving QQ.  Thank you, Nick, for a memorable anniversary lunch"}, {"review_id": "PZbJiemQAbVM0plIk59Z-Q", "user_id": "We-sExSarFuGBe2Q6iEmGw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Third time here. 1st time when they opened it sucked but I can't remember details. 2nd time by force. Third time was hope? Desperation? Yelp peer pressure? Dinning alone is actually One of my favorite things the only downside is that sometimes service sucks! This service didn't suck but it was a bit delayed. Now lets talk about the food. Pearl roll- sounds good! Big, no rice wrapped in cucumber so that all the good stuff falls out, smothered in a sauce to the point all you taste is sauce. Avacado boat- a classic of american sushi. Served on a bed of.... dried out beet strings, or shredded maroon crayon wrappers? So there is some crab salad like stuff on half an avacado that is still in its peel. Not sure if that peel is washed or not. Also avacado quality control is compromised by this as was illistrated by the big brown bruise on the bottom of mine. Now the crab topping is a lot and warmer than expected and falls nicely into the said maroon wrappers in a way that much is wasted or co mingled. I wanted a wine but getting a recomendation beyond \"people order it\" was a challenge."}, {"review_id": "wrIVJyVDa2BAcRRsajZF5Q", "user_id": "4lumoOpL45h88rRS1K35yQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "I recently move to Spokane about a year and half and go so I've been on the hunt for a good spot. Where I come from sushi is the jam and no where I've been has come close to compare to it. So to say the least I have pretty high standards.‍The location is pretty convenient with lots of parking but inside is pretty tight so don't expect to have a lot of room around you.. you'll most likely hear the people next to you conversations. If that's not a big deal then great cuz you'll enjoy the food! I've had a handful of things here including the rainbow roll, spicy salmon, spicy tuna, California, TNT, lobster roll and a few others. I gotta say the salmon roll is still the best one out of all of them and that's because they don't skim on the fish. They roll has some huge chunks of salmon, it's fresh and filling. I've tried the tuna rolls a few times and I just can't get on board (but I love spicy tuna rolls). For some reason the tuna doesn't seem fresh to me. Overall the place is good, it's an easy spot to find, pretty small place but it's somewhere I go back. I'm still trying out new sushi spots to find my go to no matter what but I will say Ginger on the south hill is pretty freakin good. Although I recently heard they have a new sous chef that is not that great so I'll have to go soon and check it out again.*ps they have great lunch specials!! I got a general tso plate with was a good amount of food and my husband got the cashew chicken plate for 6 bucks per plate!!I wish I could do half stars but I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5"}, {"review_id": "P-A59iuVpy8u3GlVyJSFdA", "user_id": "cQsKWvh25RH4Ic4qInSd0w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "AMAZING.  The servers rock, the food is to die for.

Fresh, flavorful, and fast. No matter what you get here it'll be delicious. I'm a huge fan of their California rolls. They're $4 and they're huge! They have a special \"Gonzaga\" roll that is out of this world. Their crunch and dragon rolls are also amazing. QQ will be the best sushi you'll have. It's a super small restaurant but they get you in and out in a timely manner, and they don't jip you in their take out options. Highly recommend for some of the best and cheapest sushi you'll ever have!"}, {"review_id": "4e8239REvH2Nxjaug7CqNw", "user_id": "9oLrA52INIQbC1wOzs8n_Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I'm giving this place 3 stars because the servers nasty attitude tainted the experience. My friend and I were excited to eat here having never been. The food was pretty good but the server- a male with short dark hair in his mid to late 20s was blatantly rude as soon as he came to our table and then argumentative with my friend who asked about the cold air blasting on us. Good food is important but having staff who can at least fake friendliness goes a long way.

This place was REALLY good. The sushi was so fresh. We split the big boat amongst four hungry men and it filled us up! We started with the edamame and gyoza, which were all good. But that sushi was delicious, some of the best I've ever had. That's saying a lot because I'm from Hawaii and studied abroad in Japan. The place is quite small so you'll probably have to wait but it's so worth it! Price was very reasonable considering the quality of the products, not to mention the sashimi was so thick you had to take 2+ bites of it! It was almost overwhelming.

I've tried most of sushi restaurants in Spokane and nothing could beat QQ sushi in terms of price and taste. The only downside is that this restaurant is TINY and the waiting time can be long. So don't come in starving thinking that you will get your food right away! They own a private parking lot so parking isn't so bad. Located in north Spokane area which is sorta far from my place so I never tried this place until now. And I am glad I did! I got \"Aloha\" roll and it was very refreshing and pretty (it's so PINK!). :3 I also liked their special roll called mexicali (definitely recommend you to try it out if you like fried sushi. It can be spicy though because it got jalapeno on top). I think any rolls at QQ is a safe bet-- I tried my friends' and all of them turned out to be pretty great! Their chirashi bowl also looked pretty bomb so maybe I will try that next time I visit. They always give out a free complimentary appetizer. If you didn't get it, ask for it! The service was a bit slow b/c there are so many customers waiting. But price was great. Most rolls range from ($10~$15) which is a lot cheaper than other sushi restaurants. I am very excited to go back~ :D"}, {"review_id": "WJaBofNFsDc1x5-5Q9GFHQ", "user_id": "mJIkd5ysMHfYxXV6G0ub8A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "By far the BEST sushi in town. Moving from Southern California I was worried about finding a great sushi spot. In the past I've tried Toro Sushi & Wasabi Bistro and I was greatly disappointed. QQ Sushi was my final attempt at having sushi in this town and I'm so happy I did! The owner gets his shipments of high quality fresh fish twice a week and he will refuse anything that doesn't meet his standards. The entire staff provides excellent customer service everytime I dine here. They have very reasonable prices and are very generous with their portions. I recommend QQ Sushi to all my friends & family and have yet to have anyone be disappointed. If you LOVE quality sushi then QQ Sushi will satisfy your cravings without a doubt.

I have written a super positive review of this place in the past but it quickly went downhill. The last two times that I have been to QQ I have had the worse customer service. The waiter never comes back after giving us our food we even have had to go up to them with our glasses of water/soda to get refilled and even to request the check after sitting with empty plates for over 10 minutes. Also, the last time I ate here there was food debris in my water and I was very disgusted after noticing it because I had taken a huge gulp. With all this being said I still think the sushi is amazing but I just can not go back and enjoy a meal no matter how amazing this sushi is when the service is just that terrible."}, {"review_id": "Wb_0_yq2bdSMc2lVgRSdWg", "user_id": "N1gw9ITPG0TpoUytmcbnPA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "This is probably the first negative review I've written. I've been to QQ several times and ordered to-go several times so this is a long awaited review and tonight was the last time I will order from here. Every time I've called in an order it's for the same thing- a handful of simple avocado rolls. Every time they say it'll be about 10-15 minutes and it never is so I show up around the 20-25 min mark and it still isn't ready. Tonight was the worst. We waited an hour and fifteen minutes from the time we called in the order. The waitress even told me half an hour into my wait that the chef hadn't even started making the rolls. We never really received an apology or anything and ended up just asking for our money back as we had been sitting in the car with our toddler. We left and went to Nudo. Much better service."}, {"review_id": "NOqTUxirtcXniJ-pPdaWsw", "user_id": "melU_POxvMP_iORWQyFVCg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2017", "text": "This place is super small. The ventilation could be better, service was great, and the food was even better! Portions are much larger than other sushi places and I didn't leave feeling like I could eat again.. (which is generally how I feel after I eat sushi).Got a bento box, which was amazing and large for $14. The calamari was cut from calamari steaks and was delicious! Looks more like fries.The bow chicka wow wow was the right thing per my bf. In the photo it is missing a roll because he couldn't help himself. Only $10.Overall I'll definitely be back. We came at 4pm and didn't have to wait but by 5 people were waiting outside.
