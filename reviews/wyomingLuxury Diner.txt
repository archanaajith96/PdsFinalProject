Had been a few years ago and the food was awesome then. I was not disappointed. Still the same quality and quantity and very tasty. I had breakfast. The spinach and feta omelette with hash browns and a half order of biscuits and gravy. Homemade, fresh and hot. Yummy. I'll be back again. Stop by and have some great food In a cool little joint in Cheyenne."}, {"review_id": "Dw6lKBJ2Va-h8gdLPJY91g", "user_id": "KXjgU8PLm05BKVkkpIrYFA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "was an old train carcheap eats kinda placeget the sante fe breakfast burrito"}, {"review_id": "rf3nIiIAWBWt2dTc2TeIxg", "user_id": "LXAzFj-z2x_yr6kLFFrINg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "Cheap eats, huge portions, friendly service. Another mainstay of my high school days, this is a winner in my books.On my most recent visit, we had a giant breakfast sandwich served with breakfast potatoes, a half order of biscuits and gravy (which was more than enough for one person), and two coffees....for 14 dollars.

All the servers are real sweet and it's not pricy. My pancakes were fluffy and had very large tasty blueberries. My husband really liked his green chile burrito. *Update* I went back and had a great BLT and some fried pickles. Again, everyone was super sweet. There are a lot of people here from around town so you really get a feel for how kind the people of Cheyenne are.

I opted for the \"Santa Fe\" breakfast burrito with chorizo. What arrived for my brunch meal was about two pounds of scrambled eggs, chorizo, potatoes, chili sauce, salsa and shredded cheese. Tasty stuff and plenty of it.It's a comfortable restaurant that is definitely clean.They do have wifi but the password had recently changed and my waitress did not know the new password."}, {"review_id": "FzI-3RxnHJjNy8zbSbWEXA", "user_id": "uu1z1A7XmcBHqCifCBOSLg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Such a cute little place!!  Food was delicious and service was even better!!  If I'm ever traveling through this area again I will come back!!"}, {"review_id": "OKqUhQ2Xj4T0TSk7q7Y_nA", "user_id": "ynnVSXYoog06YVjSAu_CMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Delicious hamburgers and fries and onion rings in an adorable old train car.

I ordered an omelette, biscuits and gravy, and corned beef hash. My first bite of hash was tough like gristle. Unfortunately all of the hash was full of big chunks of gristle-like corned beef mixed with what seemed like mashed potatoes. Canned corned beef hash would have been better. They even re-cooked it for me and it was even worse. The biscuits tasted burnt and the sausage gravy was flavorless. The eggs of the omelette were overcooked (this is coming from someone who likes her eggs dead). My waitress did not offer to take anything off the bill after I politely complained. This place does not deserve the 4 stars it has."}, {"review_id": "i3N5VgJRzcBH0I1sKAuJ7g", "user_id": "LH58Mxf-rIaagLITy0dY5Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/22/2017", "text": "We made it into the diner on our last day of our Eclipse adventure. The owner and staff were still smiling, AUTHENTIC and friendly, even after dealing with some squawking, hangry tourists who left in a tizzy. (Wyoming doubled its population over the past few days!)The food was FRESH and truly delicious. (They serve local, hormone-free meats.) Service was ON POINT. The decor was as charming as it gets. The diner is located in this neighborhood of cool, old motels, so if you like old neon signs drive through in the evening. It's gorgeous.We WILL be back.Thank you for the wonderful breakfast/lunch!"}, {"review_id": "sEWrP7lTjyJXztZBMGlHkg", "user_id": "wjoq7Qpwze-NHkxdo-EqhQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "I loved the potatoes, and the  service!!

I sat under a pink neon sign of \"Luxury Diner* and it cast a pink hue in the room. I arrived when it opened at 6am. It was dark outside. I ordered a grilled breakfast sandwich with bacon and a half order of biscuits and gravy. I was advised by the waitress that it was a heap O mess O food. She said the portions were large. Whoa. So I ordered a half order of biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon. Coffee was good. H2o was good. A steady stream of locals kept arriving. Cheyenne is a smallish town compared to Denver. The people are friendly.The potatoes were super good, flavored awesomely with onions and green peppers. There were huge chunks of potato. The biscuits and gravy were unfortunately not very good. The biscuits tasted very doughy. The gravy was almost tasteless and very thick. I had to pepper it up. The bacon was 4 slices of crisp bacony goodness.Overall a great experience. I would return to try something else. Check it out.

Holy crap.. I had a cheeseburger.. It's the delicious juicy flat top crispy griddle burger.. I live maybe 45 minutes from here and I'm going to be making trips just to eat a burger.. I left out the fries.. Get them with green chili and cheese.. The fries are wedges and they are fried just right so they are crispy not just thick potato.. Then grab a 2.5lb cinnamon roll on the way out.. This was so delicious.. I failed to mention in my two previous reviews that the service is always pleasant and those ladies in there busy their butts and so super sweet!!
