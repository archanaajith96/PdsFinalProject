The menu isn't extensive, but I truly enjoy that! Much, much easier to enjoy what they specialize in! I specifically was craving biscuits and gravy and it did not disappoint! The serving was much larger than expected when the waitress told us \"it's just one biscuit\" - I went ahead and ordered a side of home fries, equally delish and also a sweet tea! Will definitely be back! Great service, great pricing and delicious food!"}, {"review_id": "aZG1MRquuESerQBObeRzpQ", "user_id": "quDu_Z0-i9TCYvdHRnULEw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/9/2017", "text": "Oooooh, I am going to have to Three Star this place although it has a plethora of five stars which actually drew me in.I did not mind the wait, I understood. The place is quite small and it was a Saturday so I expected a bit of a wait. Since it was just me, I got a single seat at the counter. I was fine with my seating location but I wasn't fine with what I noticed while sitting at that counter.Well before I continue with my counter experience, I will say that the food was very good! For what it was, a fried chicken biscuit with a side of white cheddar grits, I definitely enjoyed it. I would give the food a solid four star because the biscuit was fluffy and perfect. The chicken was crispy and was given a generous helping. It was definitely above average.So why I have to stand my ground and give it a three star was the unfriendly attitude of the staff. Okay I know it was busy and very cold outside, but at least one of these gals could have broken out in a smile. Actually, one broke out in a smile when she realized she didn't hand me my water after several minutes. What got to me were the remarks that others who would be talking to each other and busy eating would not notice. I wasn't eavesdropping but it was loud enough for me to hear. \"Who are those people at the door?\"...\"I don't know\"... \"That's riiight, close that door people!\". There was a lot of eye rolling from behind the counter as well. I honestly do not know how people could not notice a cafe full of workers who do not smile. I have been to a lot of busy restaraunts and servers still smile and are friendly! It does happen! I'm sorry... not sorry. I am going to have to three star this place. I don't like attitudes."}, {"review_id": "dq_-epxmTnQ3xkCOazkunA", "user_id": "aotAs0qpPephPZz_QSqmtA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Holy biscuits. My friend and I came here on a Friday afternoon and ordered the chicken coop and the fried chicken and sweet biscuits with a side of the wilbur. I didn't personally eat the chicken coop but it looked delicious- definitely what I'll order the next time I'm in the area. The fried chicken and sweet biscuits was great- perfect mix of sweet and salty. There was sooo much chicken and it was prepared beautifully- perfectly crispy and wonderfully seasoned. The biscuits were giant and the bacon jam on top was very good. The only critique I have of it was that the soggy bacon floating in the jam just looked a little unappetizing. That and something about serving packaged maple syrup feels cheap and takes away from the experience. The wilbur was the perfect finish to the meal and completely satiated my craving for something sweet and salty."}, {"review_id": "oOQqtA5EHZ703WT84GH_5g", "user_id": "cJzhXg6xOtG38Ur-Uqr29g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Our new favorite breakfast/brunch place!

The location was great in relation to our hotel and it seemed centrally located to a lot of other restaurants and shops in the area.  The restaurant is a little small and it seemed a lot of larger groups like to eat here so prepare to wait for a table."}, {"review_id": "VytAYKVkdPj4_bVnlyc9wg", "user_id": "XV3Y5a0WzRJK8rMMInWAcw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "Best fried chicken biscuit I have ever had!

Brick walls, original wood flooring, exposed venting - just fantastic. The menu prices were very affordable with a nice twist on different dishes - huge portions!

When one said to the other about the app Yelp and this place that sounded like a mom and pop stop. I was excited about eating some \"real food\". Then before we knew it. BAM! Both of our lives would change drastically that day. We stumbled upon this chicken spot and although I made some changes to my food regime because I want to become a pescatarian for the upcoming new year I decided to live a little and postpone that thought momentarily for at least one more week . We were greeted by a \"hello\" and to a \"please help yourself to where ever you feel most comfortable\". We sat down and Alesha came over and got our drink orders first. We told her it was our first time so she was even moreso pleasant as she went over the menu with us.Soon after our order she brought out piping hot Biscuit Beignets. First off, obviously we all have our thoughts of what Heaven must be like and I could not imagine the after life without these fluffy puffs of magic! The beignets are light, small powdered squares of pure happiness in your mouth. You would probably cry yourself to sleep if you didn't try it but all of your friends did and of course they wouldn't share because it has nothing to do with your 20+ years of friendship but just your bad choices when it comes to ordering food .Chicken Coop.. I was amazed that the serving was delightfully bountiful! They were not stingy with ensuring that I had more than enough to stuff my face with all this yumminess. The food made me feel like this is what I was living for in life. Other must haves.. The white cheddar grits and don't forget the french toast! The french toast is the daddy version of the beignets. If you truly want some home cooked breakfast without all the grease... TRY THIS SPOT!This is truly a hidden gem!"}, {"review_id": "1XzqJPHcuXw8HkyZD0W2FA", "user_id": "542A2-iVW7uaeFdlwJA4ig", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2017", "text": "If you like chicken and biscuits this may be a good place for you to try. Small restaurant so just beware there will be some waiting time. I got there Saturday morning and there were about 6 people ahead of us but got seated pretty quickly but it was at the bar which I didn't mind. We got some fresh brewed coffee and I ordered the 2 egg breakfast (scrambled eggs, potatoes, biscuit and 3 pieces bacon) and my husband ordered fried chicken and sweet biscuit. We were already on our 2nd cup of coffee by the time we got our food so it took awhile... guess they were busy that day but it's all good.  The scrambled eggs had this buttery taste to them, bacon and potatoes were crispy, the biscuits were huge and pretty good. It had a little crunch at the top but I didn't like the butter they gave on the side for it. The butter was too hard so it was a bit difficult to spread it on the biscuit. I tried my husbands fried chicken and sweet biscuit. It's pretty much fried biscuits and fried chicken. It has some type of sweet sauce over it similar to maple syrup. It pretty much taste like french toast but it's biscuit and chicken. It's a bit too sweet for my taste and I don't think I would want to eat just that as my main plate but my husband enjoyed it. The portion was a bit too small for him so he ended up taking some of my food since I couldn't finish it all. Overall, I enjoyed my food and went home really full afterwards."}, {"review_id": "7UbQBtzBsdkKot4nbZqlHw", "user_id": "hzFdLZO6PcpG4ZLqYYRwMg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/5/2017", "text": "This is the best plucking chicken and biscuits you will ever have in town!  If you like fried or grilled Chicken, this is the place to satisfy you.  With various options of eggs, chicken, and carbs, you can't go wrong in this southern style breakfast joint.  The service is quick, it's not 5 stars but the food is always a treat.  On the weekends, brunch is the most busy so make sure you call in to check wait times or busy levels.  You won't be disappointed here."}, {"review_id": "cQiCre75ye-WS7AX1QI93w", "user_id": "ZfNnHjwmANWrU8GSYwWLUQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/4/2017", "text": "Be prepared to wait, but nothing too long. The restaurant itself isn't very big so it can get a little congested. The service was good and the prices reasonable. I ordered the CHICKEN COOP it was MORE than what I thought it would be based upon the pictures I'd seen in terms of portion; in my opinion that's a two person meal. I did alter the order a bit the egg comes over easy I opted for the egg to be scrambled. I needed a touch of hot sauce to jazz it up. The gravy that comes with it was average restaurant gravy. I think I went with the thought of \"home cooking\" but thats not the case. The biscuits seemed like the kind you would buy out of the frozen food section to pop in the oven along with the pre shredded cheese... nothing wrong with it again I just went with another assumption.  Overall it was a pleasant experience with friendly staff and prompt service."}, {"review_id": "f2nuyt6r7_5HAz6B-u7I_g", "user_id": "X_mu7iOWpkfkxuzqTiTDyQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/18/2017", "text": "Being from the south, I love a fried chicken and I love biscuits- so when they're put together I'm in heaven. I had heard really good things about this place, so I was excited to try it. I got one of their speciality chicken biscuits with pimento cheese, bacon, and jalapeño jelly and the table shared an order of their biscuit beignets. The biscuits themselves were really good, as was the fried chicken. The flavor combination of the sandwich was kind of odd to me, and I felt like it needed a lot more of the jalapeño jelly to balance out the saltiness of the other ingredients. I also got a side of potato salad and I personally thought that the potatoes were a little too al dente and I didn't like the addition of bacon. I also didn't really care for the beignets, because they were kind of greasy and weren't very flavorful. I would definitely go back, but next time I'll just get a basic chicken biscuit."}, {"review_id": "_G8VPiuj9KPn49kxTFBKZg", "user_id": "eM-B-mTHLHvEDwmNuLtRMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Amazing biscuits!  This is a favorite for me and my kids to go on a Saturday morning."}, {"review_id": "E3r-_apJIfXM42jFd_x8iw", "user_id": "AdnsnCINXuM5nfizx5e2Yg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Excellent food and service.  No problem substituting items on my order.
