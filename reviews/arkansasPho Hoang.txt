We had Pho last night and found this little restaurant. Surprising amazing ad authentic. We both order number one Pho noodle thinking we will just settle for it cuz we finally get some hot soup instead of burgers again. Hot soup pho noodles are so great. With addition, we also order the dry noodles to share. Yum yum and left with very satisfied tummies. Highly recommended if you are in town for any reason."}, {"review_id": "uhpmx3nunY6QWUjXG8U86Q", "user_id": "kYTSdWfmLjTtY0ZQGXcThA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "We've been coming here for a long time. We enjoy their pho but it seems like they are under new management. The owner directly told a customer she didn't like hmong people and they were ugly. This is the first time I have heard something like this and I won't be coming back. The pho broth has become extremely salty. And the bubba tea is too sweet."}, {"review_id": "liEouVrz05AV8Fk59KSDOg", "user_id": "Cs1cOr8uWlLZ2jPGqV_Lag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/16/2017", "text": "Best pho in town!

I ordered my regular, Pho Ga (chicken). Which surprisingly was not on the menu. But out of all other pho places, this has to be the very best! It has its own unique flavor and nothing like I've tasted anywhere else! The chicken was so good! It has been grilled before putting in the broth! Which made it excellent! Although it was very westernized, I would definitely be back! We also ordered their bubble tea! Which was amazing. They didn't have my favorite, passion fruit, but it was still amazing. If you're in the are and are looking to try something new, COME HERE!"}, {"review_id": "sQlcKGX4TqyAgA7NGTgKsg", "user_id": "vVQ9n6dOT2w4GYW9OaUe_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2017", "text": "Best Pho in town, hands down!!!

The food has always been delicious for me, and the size of the location is intimate and comforting.But I have one major complaint: it has been lacking in the hygiene department. Half the time I eat here with another person, that other person has something wrong with their dish, like a hair in it.

They certainly get strong margins on their sales.Nonetheless, the food is very good and pretty authentic in my experience. Excellent fresh spring rolls with peanut sauce. Good pho, solid fried rice and egg rolls; along with tasty vermicelli dishes. If you don't mind splurging, try the bubble tea... it has a great flavor. But around ~$3.50 it is a little hard to justify.Service is usually efficient, relatively friendly, and accommodating."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-hoang-fort-smith?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
