I love meat, and Jimmy's didn't disappoint with their very ample selection of deli meats. I ended up getting the Italian stallion sandwich, 6 in., for $5. Such a deal for the amount of food you got - the portions are huge. It took me a decent amount of time to figure out how to fit the sandwich in my mouth, it was so stuffed with meat and cheese. The bread was perfectly toasted, and the peppers (??) on the top added the perfect amount of zing. Parking is annoying, but definitely worth the headache for Jimmy's!"}, {"review_id": "q4NwQW-uFthRpW7PGas3Ug", "user_id": "G6iPJLyRP-t2sjncGppnQQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/22/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I like this place, but I feel that something is changing.

When I envision a market in the heart of Europe I envision this place. You have a little slice of heaven in the strangest part of town. A little bit of fresh -yet essential produce, cheeses/dairy, pastas, San Marzano tomatoes (upon other Italian brands), an abundance of wine (some at a steal of a deal, I bought an avg $37 Chianti for $15), sweets, in house jams/jellies/dressings/pickled items/etc, deli (where you can even order sandwiches - see my pics below) - AND YOU CAN DO ALL OF THIS WHILE DRINKING A $4 GLASS IF WINE?! I will for sure be back! Sidenote: the $4 wine was delicious! Along those same price lines, all of the items are VERY reasonably priced for what you are getting!That being said, parking can be a tad challenging but so well worth it. Pro tip: sign up for their email list because they have wine tastings, dinner/wine pairings, specialty cheeses and meats come in and do much more. Such a great place to drop in if you are local or wanting to feed you Italian passion!"}, {"review_id": "KEI7-H2FvjepcZqQwHONPA", "user_id": "Hi10sGSZNxQH3NLyWSZ1oA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "If you say Gibbler, I say KIMMYIf you get fat then, I stay SLIMMYIf you go running, I get SWIMMYBut if you want a sandwich, go to JIMMYIf you killed Kenny, I killed TIMMYIf you like Dylan, I like JIMIIf you can Swalla, I can SHIMMYBut if you want a sandwich, go to JIMMYIf you come out here, do it on a WHIMMYIf the light's too bright, make it more DIMMYYou want more Britney?

Because these are the very best deli sandwiches I've had outside NE USA. Bari in Chicago and Glorioso in Milwaukee are the only others close. Up in NJ, the best delis in the world reside, but Jimmy's is not too far behind, and I can't give it a better compliment than that.And as Demi Lovato famously said of the Vietnam war:What's wrong with givingWhat's wrong with givingWhat's wrong with giving complimentsAhaha.Chicago: This Italian deli was probably the nicest food treat that I've had in Dallas, other than Meerut - my fave Indo-Pak place in the country. I have no idea what it's doing down here in Dallas, but my guess is that the owners came from Chicago, because the sandwiches taste like the ones up there, and there's a lot of mentions and memorabilia from CHI in here.Old Italia: All the flags of all the Serie A sides... some of the best Italian decor I've seen anywhere. The real stuff, not the tourist crap, like Colosseum pictures and Gondolas. Lol. Soccer banners hanging, and some of these clubs literally do not even get their flags hung up in Italy itself. It's pretty crazy and cool. They have a flag of Juventus, but you can't have everything.Dressing: Very vinegary salad dressing right on the wiches (much like Chicago Italian), so you may want to consider getting that on the side. You can also ask for whichever condiments you want, on the sandwich. Why does that offend you?As the late, great Demi Lovato once said...What's wrong with gettingWhat's wrong with gettingWhat's wrong with getting condiments?Ahaha.Repeat: I've been here 4 times in my 3 most recent trips to DFW. I will absolutely be back here for a sandwich when next in Dallas. Parking was OK when I came.Downside: As George Orwell would say, some are more amazing than others. Muffaletta is dry and forgettable, and as for the tuna - wtf. 80% bread and that which wasn't bread didn't taste good. There just wasn't enough stuff on it. Felt like a bit of a rip-off and a big disappointment. Like your bf last night.Middle ground: The Proscuitto doesn't do it for me, I have insanely high prosciutto standards, because of NJ delis putting fresh warm gooey mozzarella on theirs, I'm very spoiled. But Barbie was really impressed by it.Italian bread: Insist on Italian bread, it's amazing. The white rolls are big, round and bland (like my ex), predictable, wheras the Italian rolls make the difference. Because Italians do it better. Louise Ciccone told me.Stallone: The real star of the show so far is the Italian Stallion. Not just the best sandwich in Dallas, but one of the best I've had anywhere. Perfectly made, and I can't wait to go back and try different Italian bread sandwiches to see if they're as good. If you haven't been here before, order the Italian Stallion as your starting point.Bevvies: Amazing selection of imported European soda/wine as well as some North American stuff as well. Many drinks that I've never even seen before, that I didn't know existed. You could spend hundreds trying all the imported sodas, and thousands trying the wines.Politik: The guy making sandwiches was awesome, talking to me about how the government and the rich don't care about the victims of Katrina and Harvey. We had a nice conspiratorial philosophical discussion while fiddling with our tin foil hats.Front: Service is fine, and they have a few dirty little tables to sit & eat, and it feels just like a deli should feel. Panhandler issues in & out, but it's also a really nice area, so go figure. The owner doesn't seem too friendly, but then neither does my father so that's life.Jimmy's is that it's massively highly rated by a lot of people on Yelp, close to a very hipster area (Deep Ellum), so I expected it to absolutely suck (that's how it goes). I know the best Italian delis in the country, I'm spoiled. But the reviews are right! It was a huge surprise that this is so good. One of my fave delis anywhere, and top 5 eateries in Dallas, but only if you order one of the really good sandwiches, rather than one of the mediocre or bad ones.So get the Italian Stallion.Just like Sharon Stone did in that spectacular scene in \"The Specialist.\""}, {"review_id": "14bZCi3zTRKHqXXhZ3sv-Q", "user_id": "d4EF2Zzw8rvkAOwuEiZs_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Yes!

A perfect picnic meal or appetizer for a party.  Don't forget to pick up a wine or two - they've got a great selection of Italian wines!Parking is SUCH a pain in the behind, but for the most part it's worth the stress.  Can't get any more authentic & satisfying than Jimmy's!"}, {"review_id": "eV520scusWk-XLmpE4SF1w", "user_id": "76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/20/2017", "text": "On the Dallas Eater 38 List (as of 09/2017).AMAZING sandwiches can be found at Jimmy's Food Store!! I finally made the trek out here from Irving on the weekend, and called my order in ahead of time. It took them 15 minute to make my sandwich when I called around 11am on a Saturday. I tried their Hot Italian Sub (6\", $6.99, yelp.com/user_local_phot…), which was SO SO good. It was also incredibly messy to eat, but I would definitely get this sandwich again, and highly recommend it for any sub lover. The italian sausage definitely had some heat to them, the tomato sauce was super flavorful, and it was packed with melted cheesiness goodness. I will definitely be back to Jimmy's for this sub again, and to try their other sandwiches!

Call in your order before you go because there is almost always a decent wait during lunchtime.2. If there are no seats in the front, check the back room, which is much more spacious and conducive to larger groups3. Instead of getting a glass of wine each, just get a bottle and have them open it for you in store4.

The meats are fresh, and they have every Italian cooking ingredient one could need to make fresh Italian fare from their home. They also make amazing sandwiches....as some would say \"the best sandwich of their life\" when talking about The Italian Stallion.

Our friend circled around several times before we finally got a spot. Made the short walk and when we entered we were amazed at all the cool stuff they had. Literally a corner store with groceries and a food center in the back. You can buy pizza dough, fresh made sausages, cheese, meatballs and a variety of Italian goodies.The interior was small and packed with people. We all heard great things about this place and only came to check it out since it was not too far from our lunch spot. After wandering the store and going down each aisle we finished at the food center. We decided to share a sandwich because it was too hard to resist. There were so many items on the menu that sounded delicious but eventually we ordered the Meatball Sandwich because everyone kept ordering it. Lots of people in line also recommended it. The sandwich was so good and probably would have taste better if we weren't so stuffed from lunch only 30 mins prior. The meatballs were tender, juicy and full of flavor. Now we know why they've been in business for so long.
