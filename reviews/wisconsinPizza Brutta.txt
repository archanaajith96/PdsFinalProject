Service is generally pretty fast, as the format is that you order at the counter and the staff brings out the pizza to you.The check-in feature is pretty neat for the free flatbread.  Probably wouldn't pay for the flatbread, but it was a nice appetizer that just doesn't compare to how good the pizzas are.The cremini pizza is my go-to; the combination of mushrooms is super savory, and the white sauce isn't overpowering. Mushrooms and caramelized onions are my weakness, put them together with cheese, and then ooh boy what a wonderful combination. I get this almost every time that I come; it's too good to stay away if you're a mushroom fiend.I tried the diavola too, which was such a contrast from the cremini. The spiciness of the pepperoni with fresh mozzarella was a lighter taste, but both were absolutely delicious!  My only qualm is that multiple times that I've visited is that, sometimes, because the dough is hand rolled out, the middle can sometimes be super thin and get a little soggy, that that by no means keeps me from coming back.One pizza is more than enough for one person, but I would definitely recommend bringing a friend and splitting two because there are so many wonderful combinations to try!"}, {"review_id": "NCtzTzcRiq_Kr_WgJMBViQ", "user_id": "aclgHhEvR1_-MjDGwnsr8A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "I enjoyed the wood-fired Marinara pizza yesterday. I added cherry tomatoes and red onions, but probably should have added mushrooms and red peppers for a bit more substance.It may have been the only vegan option other than building your own, but most vegan pizza options at other pizza restaurants aren't what I enjoy/expect in a pizza."}, {"review_id": "DunhqUr7RIvoobKzxJL6GQ", "user_id": "KwZX2vkUDjCMbmbA44wzCw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "Checked in and got a free flatbread, which was pretty good :) I wouldn't recommend necessarily ordering it on its own but for free, it was definitely worth it. Pizza is decent and fresh, service is fast. Ordered the Rosso Verde pizza on recommendation of whoever took our order, and would recommend this choice. While not the best wood-fired pizza I've ever had, it is one of the best slices I've had in Madison and it kept well over the next couple of days."}, {"review_id": "fBZHRjt0_x-TEnHX826qYw", "user_id": "iEy2zChmzGTdv9n0t_jEPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "This is a great place to stop when in the Monroe St neighborhood. The fresh, wood-fired pizzas are delicious and there are a variety of fun combos and plain for the kids. Plus they don't mind adding or subtracting an item or two from their stated menu styles. You order at the counter and then grab a seat.  Seats are at a premium on weekends at lunch and dinner time and those are pretty popular times during the week as well.One pizza can be shared but I would be a salad to fill out the meal or order one yourself and save the rest for another day.  If you aren't into in pizza, their salads are worth stopping in for as they have some yummy options (like the one with walnuts gorgonzola).  They are pre-dressed so if you like to add your own dressing, ask for it on the side as the portions are liberal."}, {"review_id": "4WjEYjHj0dqrahX9vDQXEg", "user_id": "TMV18_Nn_medcn8lp-balA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "I love the oldness of the space of Pizza Brutta and that the kitchen is open and the staff is so welcoming and appreciative.

This is good casual dining, order at the counter, get a number, grab a booth, wait for your pizza to be hand-delivered. Oh!! And you'll be thanked for coming in when you leave!

You can see all of the fresh ingredients going on your pizza and you see it cooked in the oven. Every time I've gone here people in the group have gotten a wide range of different pizzas, and everyone said their pizza was just fantastic!

Before we went to another event, a friend and I stopped in to get a good base down. I was a little surprised by the 'stand in line' ordering. Very much an assembly line for ordering, preparing the food and wood fire grilling. My Pimento pizza was ordered and to the table in 5-6 minutes. They only have a couple of beers and wine available. I wish the selection for drinks was larger. The pizza was great. I love the chewy crust, the sweet tomato base and that goat cheese. Don't get me started on how tasty it all was. The simplicity, yet complex flavors of this pizza. Delish! Just the right amount of toppings too. I did snag a piece of the market pizza of the day. That was great too. But, that pimento pizza. It's made for dreams."}, {"review_id": "CWZ-I2ypIrh8uwRNpRjTgw", "user_id": "srFZ0_Q7ktL5USL63yzrHQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/25/2017", "text": "GET THE CAPRESE FLATBREAD APPETIZER!!! GET IT!!!If someone only gets to glance at my review the one thing I want them to away is that, therefore I am stating it first and in all caps. But really... it is amazing. They roast their tomatoes so they are warm and just starting to brown on the outside. Their basil leaves are diced up and made into this spread with olive oil I believe. Served on a warm flat bread and delicious mozzarella. An awesome take on the traditional caprese salad.The pizzas that I have triedMiele- this means honey which it does have but I would say this pizza is actually quite spicy with calabrian chilies on it, which I enjoy but just a note if you are thinking it will be sweet because of the honey. Dolce E Piccante- I don't think they put pineapples on their pizzas in Italy but I'm glad they do here! I enjoy ham and pineapple pizza and love that they kick it up a notch with basil. Proscuitto arugula- I was probably most excited for this pizza but it was the one I liked the lease. It wasn't bad, I felt like the others just had more stand out flavors. Pesto- Delicious because of their amazing pesto. I can be picky when it comes to pesto. This one is delicious. Also has mushrooms on it.Nutella- Nutella is always amazing, and it is quite yummy when served on their flatbread. I just wish maybe there was another topping on this? Marshmallows? Cookie pieces? A drizzle of chocolate? Anyways to conclude my review...GET THE CAPRESE FLATBREAD!"}, {"review_id": "Aw6-vOEO7wuleGGiAO_hag", "user_id": "HRDJ4mOyU4lqOIzqHHTEWA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Love the individual pizzas for our fussy family.

My cousin even slipped in her vegan ways to enjoy a cheesy slice at Pizza Brutta. Now I'm not saying you have to compromise your food values for this place, but it's a quant Madison classic and to not try it is a travesty. My only qualm is that it's so freaky fresh that you almost need a fork if you don't want the thin middle to fall apart. From ordering at the counter to your belly, you're looking at about a 10-15 minute wait. Can be a dressed up or dressed down kind of eatery for sure. I would bring a date or my *vegan cousin here any time!"}, {"review_id": "LB2Vwp_1tF_5vCU8ZanMcQ", "user_id": "kzz4lKJl5b-Kqs6f_H7u3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Pizza Brutta, ti amo. The bestest thin crust pizza with fabulous ingredients and fast service. I always go for the Rossoverde because the prosciutto and arugula are soooo dense with flavor! The sauce, cheese  and toppings are perf every time. Decide how much you're gonna eat before you come, because it's easy to gulf these pies down.

It is easily the best wood-fired pizza I've had in Madison and the interior is cute too! My mom and I regularly share the Beet Salad which consists of mixed greens, honey balsamic vinaigrette, roasted beets, pistachios, and goat cheese which we swap out for feta. Then we split a classic Margherita pizza and our tummies are happy! We also enjoy our lunches with a tall glass of lemon water. The drinks are self-serve and I appreciate that they provide lemons for you to add and that the water glasses are of substantial size and material (I have a weird obsession with quality glassware... and some places give you water glasses that are significantly smaller than if you had ordered a soda)! Stay awesome Pizza Brutta, I'll see you soon!"}, {"review_id": "3EPUpq7MpDF7AAifDJD_3g", "user_id": "1vAfoDtuEglqhExhNSK4Jw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/20/2017", "text": "If you like Neapolitan, wood fired pizza, and are in Madison, this place is legit.This place serves up the Neapolitan to meet this pizza enthusiasts expectations.
