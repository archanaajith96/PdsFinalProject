I went here with my friends last week. I had been here once before with my hubby, for dinner, and wasn't very impressed, but this time changed all that. Firstly, I was there right at 11. We made a reservation, and I'm glad, because it was packed before we left. My friends were a little behind, so I ordered some calamari to snack on. While I waited, I enjoyed the scenery. The restaurant is very bright and open with lots of big windows. The decor is an interesting mix of clean lined traditional, farmhouse, and touches of industrial to modernize it. The effect was homey, but chic. Our server and other staff we interacted with were professionally friendly and efficient, which I always enjoy.My friends arrived and our calamari came shortly after. It was one of the best I'd ever had, light and crisp with tender meat, served with flavorful sauces and a lovely green salad on the side with a refreshing berry vinaigrette. It was so good, my friend ordered a second plate. Then we ordered our meals. I had the salmon salad, with dressing on the side, and my friends ordered the shrimp and grits and chicken fried steak. I'm glad I ordered the onion dressing on the side as I didn't love it, so I ordered a lemon vinaigrette instead that paired beautifully with my meal. The salmon was superb. Perfect texture and flavor and the other parts of the salad were harmonious and delicious. My friends meals were equally scrumptious,  especially the shrimp and cheesy grits. We actually added a little goat cheese from my salad to her grits and it was heavenly!The prices were a little high, but fair for the quality of food. We left with happy bellies, very thankful for our visit. If you are looking for fine dining food, with a more casual atmosphere, this is your place."}, {"review_id": "UNVFp-e_oERqooFG2FlLCg", "user_id": "bTKvZww6jUwrn6QroV6KQg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Cheever's is one of those small restaurants that really focuses on serving great food rather than trying to serve the masses. You will pay a higher price than most restaurants but the focus on details and quality really shines through here. They serve everything from chicken, to steaks, and salads but where they really shine is their seafood! Always fresh and very well prepared! While the main courses are amazing, the dessert menu is where you will truly fall in love! The chocolate and carrot cakes are to great to pass up! You won't be disappointed to say the least!"}, {"review_id": "ArKg1wTTw4EG5EZ7HjKBRg", "user_id": "A84BDSbdQPdqtvS_DHx62Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Love is an understatement for this local establishment. It's some of the best of what OKC has to offer. This is my Cheever's love list:* the complimentary dinner rolls/butter is pure bliss* the chicken fried steak is the best I've ever had-ever* the halibut halibut halibut; yes, to the halibut * the cocktail program offers some yummy concoctions* the shrimp & grits are where it's at* daily specials are always delicious; so seriously consider them* reliably good food; great to bring out-of-towners here if you're looking to impress your guests* they ask you if you are celebrating a special occasion and make it great if you are* desserts are always shareable for the table as they are humongous * the decor is tastefully classic, comfortable and intimate * they provide you with rolls to-go if you have leftovers to take home and they aren't judge-y about it* ask for a to-go tea, if you should so desireI could go on, but you probably catch my drift-there's so much to love here. Tip #1 : I like to order the chicken fried steak sometimes for brunch and usually if you ask for them to sub the gravy that's on the dinner version of the dish, they are happy to oblige. Tip #2 : Be sure to arrive with advanced reservations. If you don't you may be able to grab a seat or two at the bar which is full service, first come, first served. You can get a resy on their website and it's easy. You can usually get same day reservations if you look in the AM for that evening, but on busier days you may want a day or two in advance.

First time here in OKC and figured this place was we'll rated so worth visit. And it is. Especially if you're looking to just gently feed your hunger. This is a very nice location about 1.5miles from my hotel. The food is reasonably priced but portion size is a little less than satisfactory. I ordered one of the specials today which was their Swedish Meatballs over rice. Now the meatball presentation (see pics) appears to be 6 meatballs however upon eating I noticed it to be only 4. They drop a dollop of sauce in 6 circular spaces. Sadly 2 of which are faux. The drinks are reasonable at around 9ish bucks per drink but a little more alcohol would be nice.  Four people two satisfactory meals. Two meals that were so-so. The two meals that were unimpressive where both specials so I would suggest to steer clear of the specials. All in all I can see this being a nice spot if you're looking to just have literally a bite to eat. Fairly average at best. Good service though so that's always a plus."}, {"review_id": "MFA7_Ia3l-5XUQm4eon44w", "user_id": "GH1SEW5iTdE8pkJjGG35ww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "My go to brunch spot.

Took my own advice and made a reservation and although we got there 15 mins early, they seated us as soon as they could which was nice.I ordered the chicken fried steak and my husband got the shrimp and grits. It was an extra $1.50 to add a egg to the chicken fried steak dish. It did not disappoint! The portion size left me satisfied but wasn't so big that I had leftovers. The potatoes where crisp, the gravy was savory and yes just yes! I preferred the chicken fried steak to my husband's shrimp and grits.For dessert, and thanks to a yelp review, we ordered the half sized Pecan Ball ice cream dessert. Half size was more than enough for two to share and was $7. Our bill came to $43 before tip.

I've actually had it bookmarked for awhile. The evening started \"sub-par.\". We made reservations on open table, yet were seated in the very back, left of the bar, next to a drafty kitchen door.  We had to scoot by people just to get to the table.  Not good.  Also, took 45 minutes to get our food and the place wasn't even packed. Not acceptable.  This would be the only reasons I don't go out of my way to return unless I'm in the area. Food brought this up to 4 stars bc it was that good!   But not enough to earn the elusive 5 star.  First, warm rolls and a cool evening. Second, Juan's Quest Chihuahua... Thick, gooey cheese with pico, avocado, salsa Verde and black beans.  Superb. For our entrees my wife ordered the highly touted chicken fried steak with jalepeno creme sauce and fire roasted vegetables.  Really big and filling, with seasoned crispy breading. I ordered the molasses chicken breast w/ jalepeno au gratin potatoes and greens.  Greens were good, not too salty and the potatoes reminded me of something my grandmother would make. The molasses chicken was piping hot, juicy, with the perfect blend of charred finish with a sweet glaze. Highly recommend!At this point we were about to burst but couldnt leave without ordering the carrot cake, so we ordered it to go.  When we got home, we looked at it and tried it.  Maybe the best carrot cake ive had to date! Moist and large enough for a family! ....almost forgot about the drinks... Both great.     If you're a bourbon or scotch drinker I would recommend the bandit.  It's made with a splash of scotch, Buffalo Trace bourbon, honey and lemon."}, {"review_id": "9TLQViHk0q5wrOpmoAFivw", "user_id": "eafWEvwyHtbwPMSn8Elimw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "You might find Cheever's when you're looking for a decent breakfast in OKC.

We loved our chicken fried steak and shrimp and grits even more. Both were among the best of these dishes we've ever had anywhere. If you're looking at the menu right now, go with either of those.

It's always something I look forward to- herby, soft, and the amount of salt in the homemade butter is perfect. I also tend to order a cinnamon roll (not sorry), and it's always warm; the frosting is a little sweet but I think it works. For the main course, I've always either gone for the chicken fried steak (monstrous!) or the biscuits and gravy. Both always exceed expectations. As far as cocktails go, they're worth the price tag (and I love a strong brunch cocktail/mimosa). I'd recommend this brunch spot to anyone.

Whew.. I went here 31 Dec for dinner after the Thunder game for the first time.. I always wanted to try this spot out, off of the Yelp reviews and finally got a chance to.. I would recommend calling to make reservations or using the OpenTable app, like many of the reviews mention..For the appetizer I got \"JUAN'S QUESO CHIHUAHUA\" My friends when I tell you this was one of the best appetizers I have ever had... I am not lying! It came out in a mini cask iron skillet, sizzling with melted gooey cheese.. The flavors in this dish were bursting all throughout my mouth.. You get, hot, cool, tangy,. My mouth was like, \"what's going on?\" Unbelievable!They also serve complimentary rolls.. Mayne!!! Them joints came out tender, and very warm to the touch.. Also, you get a side of salted butter to lather the rolls which was a nice compliment.. The rolls were on point!! (Melt in your mouth action)For the Dinner I elected for the \"MOLASSES ROAST CHICKEN BREAST\"Man!!! Another hit... I elected to substitute the \"collard greens\", because the waiter said it was made or had bacon in it (I don't eat beef or pork) with \"FIRE-ROASTED VEGETABLES\" and I kept the \"cheddar-green onion grits\".. I will not mark them down on the grits, because I personally don't like grits, but I wanted to experience the Cheever experience as advertised as much as possible on the menu that came with the entree..(I tried some of the grits, and didn't like as expected) I'll get another side next time...The chicken was fantastic! It came out moist, hot, succulent, and very flavorful.. The molasses was charred on the chicken, with a slight gooey sticky sweet coating on the chicken..  Everything from the appetizer to the dinner, came out pipping hot and fresh!! I was very impressed, because you know how sometimes you go to restaurants and the food comes out \"warm\" or \"luke warm\" like it's been sitting under a heat lamp, or they warmed it up in a microwave? Not here, everything came out very hot and fresh!!Dessert??? Yes Sirrrrrrrr! I elected for the \"GIANT CARROT CAKE\"WOW! This was the best carrot cake that I have ever had, and I am not exaggerating! It was huge, sweet, and very moist! whew...This spot, is 5 stars all day!! Everything was delicious, I will be back for sure... This jawns will now be added to my \"heavy restaurant rotation\" list.."}, {"review_id": "44uJgvfauvkF9tHQcioS_w", "user_id": "0EMmUaKBfAQ_MFBJHkQv5g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/20/2017", "text": "First visit to Cheever's, and the brunch was delicious. We didn't have a reservation, and there was definitely a wait, but it wasn't as long as we were quoted. We sat in the bar area, which was a little tight. There were several things on the menu we wanted to try, but we ended up going with the chicken and pepper jack strudel, the cowgirl Benedict and a citrus and pistachio waffle which was on special. The strudel was different than we were expecting. Pretty much just a pile of diced chicken and paper jack cheese, but it tasted great! The benedict was very good; my friend orders it every time she's at Cheever's for brunch. The waffle was also very good, but I wish I would have tried the enchilada, which was my second choice.
