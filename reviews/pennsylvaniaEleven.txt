This was my first time at Eleven and I think it will not be my last! We started out with an appetizer of spicy tuna tartare with drinks from their specialty cocktail menu. My husband had their manhattan and I had their Moscow Mule which i switched out the vodka for hendricks gin with no problem. Both drinks and the appetizer were delicious. We also experienced the bread person that comes around and the sea salt focaccia  is worth every single carb/calorie. Our waiter, Brian I think was his name, did an excellent job spacing out our courses to finish our drinks and app/bread before our entrees were served. I had the Elysian Fields Farm Lamb Loin with mushrooms, asparagus, and tons of flavor. So delicious and melted in my mouth!!! My husband went for the seafood tasting. The crab cake was the largest I've seen with large chunks of crab, the scallop was perfectly medium rare and melted in your mouth like butter, there was also halibut and grits that were also excellent. We each had a house wine, chosen by our waiter,  that paired with our meal these were roughly $10-13/glass and both delicious!For dessert we each had creme brulee that came with fresh rasberries, a french macaroon, and a little chocolate badge with 'Happy Anniversary' on it. We each had a glass of champagne for toasting. :) All in all an excellent experience. The inside of the restaurant is beautiful. I was told by a friend when I asked about dress code was that I would find people in jeans with heels all the way up to floor length gowns. This was actually very true as i saw both and everything in between.  We will definitely be back in the future!"}, {"review_id": "uSNo9psW4G7VLJv6T25luw", "user_id": "asbO7KLh00WrheXa2-IjDQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/5/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Eleven is good and I want to like it even more. I'm going to come back and review after a few additional visits. I typically order appetizers at the bar (group food) that are very good. However, this place smells like sewer gas as soon as you walk in. I'm not giving up yet!***Updated May 2018If you're vegan, prepare to eat salad. There's not much on the menu for you, but the chef is willing to accommodate. I love salad so this doesn't bother me. If you're gluten free and vegan...eat before you go as you won't even be able to pick at bread. The salad portion isn't very large and I suggest requesting extra veggies."}, {"review_id": "iOA9ufOHR4fhk1aF_IwGMQ", "user_id": "oAkiKNAfRSbVKJ--oCB_iw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I love it here for brunch so much!!!!Parking: valet, the lot across the street (price can range depending on if there are events or not) garage on the block behind is a flat $6 on weekendsTip: sign up for the big burrito group mailings to get a packet of coupons in the winter AND to get one for $30 off an entree on your birthday!  Reservations: highly recommended. Use opentable and earn points towards dining certificates Brunch is a prix fixe menu with a cocktail or juice, starter and entree. I had an insanely delicious and spicy Bloody Mary to sip/chug during my meal. A complementary basket of mini muffins and croissants was brought out with some hibiscus jam and apple cinnamon butter.  For the starter, I went with the deconstructed salmon everything bagel. Scallion cream cheese, diced egg, red onion and capers were available to smear on a perfectly toasted everything bagel. I had the prosciutto onion and cheddar omelette with fingerling potatoes and a side of bacon for my entree. The potatoes and bacon were crispy and perfect! The omelette didn't have as much prosciutto as I would like but it was so flavorful and filling!Head to the bar for some post brunch cockstails and ask for Brian!Update:Finally got down here for dinner:HH: 4-6 $7 drinks and bar snacks We shared the calamari that has this spicy sauce and the crispy fingerling potatoes with cheese curds. Both were fried to perfection, not over done at all. The calamari wasn't chewy at all and the cheese curds were gooey. And holy moly that garlic aioli!I had the mushroom and onion soup as well. It came with a pea pesto that was out of this world. I shamelessly licked the bowl clean using a piece of the house made focaccia bread. My entree was the medium cooked hanger steak topped with flaked sea salt. It came with a potato croquette and some roasted cauliflower. Had to get dessert of course so I went with the dark chocolate cake!"}, {"review_id": "IV-T3BlV2s-Ittr8A8o-cg", "user_id": "mH5frU-FkhEkQ1ITa_fm5Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Meh...I wish it lived up to it's reputation and price point.

Between the two of us we had a Bloody Mary and a Sage 75. The short rib hash and the avocado toast for apps. And the steak and egg, as well as the burger for entrees. I can say that each dish was excellent in taste and well executed. The short rib hash in particular was delicious and perfectly composed, sized and delivered. The poached egg on top was perfect as well. The hanger (hangar?) steak was really really good. The drinks were delicious and the service was very nice as well.

Second course - Ricotta cavatelli /  fava bean, pistachio, mint, rabbit sausage, goat cheese.  This was ON POINT!   Third course - Sea scallops / carrot puree, roasted carrots, black barley, Aleppo pepper oil, crispy caper.  Great texture and flavor but I do not enjoy scallops. Fourth course - Elysian Fields Farm Lamb /white asparagus, english peas, morel mushrooms, spring onion, salsa Verde, crispy garlic.  There was a heavy hand on the salt on this dish, but that is the only complaint. Dessert - Strawberry Shortcake.  My client loved this!  For me, it was too sweet but this is not a dessert that i would order if I was given a choice.  I would roll with my client's reaction on this one.  Overall, an excellent spot.  Gorgeous interior. great cocktails offerings, and wine list, including wines by the glass.  The Tempranillo was delicious!  Would come back in a heartbeat.  Thank you for the hospitality."}, {"review_id": "Bg3IoP0GgrcIVF3VwTSQBA", "user_id": "ZyhRsnKcATB6hcRRykQKeQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "For $30, this is an unbeatable brunch deal. You choose an appetizer, an entree, and a cocktail or fresh juice. Come hungry or don't come at all, because the \"appetizer\" itself is like a normal sized brunch entree at other establishments. They also give you a free, really really amazing basket of fresh baked goodies- still thinking about the scones. Highly recommend the smoked salmon and oysters for the appetizer, and the steak and eggs (very generous portion, steak cooked well, and loved the \"fried\" egg- almost a Scottish egg) for entree.Reservations were easy to make for a larger party of five on opentable. The vibe here is sophisticated but not stuffy. Love the spacious circular booths and very high ceilings.

The entrance was unassuming but the place was much larger than I expected.  wine cellar looked really nice and the positioning above the dining area was really creative.  The wine list was generally limited with a selection that was overpriced - except for a couple of gems...  Food was a set menu and consisted of several dishes.  I had a series of sushi style bites to start. The tuna tartare on toast was very fresh and had a nice ponzu dressing. The fried unagi in a blanket (I think it was as it was accompanied by the traditional bbq sauce) was a little too salty and the other sushi was very tasty.  The salad was very fresh and the greens excellent. dressing was light and was a great interlude before the salmon. The salmon was cooked perfectly and was really sushi quality.  Accompaniments were light and the whole taste and texture was well put together.  The only thing I would improve on is the balsamic - I expected some more than a drizzle on the side.  It would have been a perfect dish with a little more.  The negative item for me is that the service was generally slow. it took a while to get the wine, open it and serve it.  It also took a while for one person on our table to get their food - for every course.  The restaurant was not that busy so I am not sure what the issue was.  Will go back"}, {"review_id": "-kJzV7UzJ-8dfR__iHNZDQ", "user_id": "h4MPk8UK1OwhFlWECVw7SQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "Fantastic location for a prix fixe Brunch - pick a cocktail or juice, an appetizer, and an entree for $29. I started off with the Newton's apple cocktail which reminded me a mojito with an apple kick. Super delicious, I may have to learn how to make this on my own. For the appetizer, I picked the grilled sticky which is a grilled cinnamon bun in the shape of french toast, with an amazing bacon butterscotch reduction drizzled on top. This hefty appetizer was absolutely out of this world and it was hard to stop myself from devouring the whole thing, especially since my goat cheese and mushroom omelette was coming up next. The omelette came with a side of crispy fingerling potatoes mixed with fried shallots and a bit of spicy seasoning and bacon. These were probably some of the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had, and the black pepper bacon was really something else. The omelette was packed with goat cheese (always a plus in my books) and cooked to perfection. Overall an incredibly delicious place for brunch with a lot of variety and options.

We chose Eleven because we both had Big Burrito restaurant group coupons, and Eleven's menu sounded enticing.Lately I'm in the habit of going in to try restaurants during the dead period around 2-3 PM for late lunch... The benefit is that places are usually slow and there's no issue finding a table. The downside is, many places are short-staffed during this time, and this is the exact issue we had on our visit.There was just one waiter for the 'tavern' side. Although he was very gracious and polite, he had to juggle 3 tables, the bar, and a gin vendor all at once. It took a while to order dessert because he was talking gin!But now, to the meal:Cocktails were a must. I ordered a \"Newton's Apple\". It was alright. The apple pieces within were a bit brown and soft... not disgustingly so, just enough to be disappointing. My friend's \"Starry Night\" was much better; I'd absolutely recommend that drink.I ordered the Lobster Roll with a side salad. The salad took up a full half of the plate and was beautiful and colorful, loaded with arugula... My favorite! The lobster roll was stuffed full of a generous portion of lobster. Although it wasn't anything revolutionary, there are some things that are just so exquisite in their usual form. Lobster rolls are one of those things.My friend got the Eleven Burger (a veal sandwich). It too was jam-packed with so much meat. He got a Cesar side salad; again, quite a generous portion.We ordered a dessert to split: the Crème Fraîche Brûlée. (I triple-checked their menu to make sure I got all those little accents right, FYI). It came with a Raspberry Almond Macaron, which was preety good, and fresh raspberries, which were Wonderful. Nothing about a restaurant impresses me more than very fresh, perfectly ripe raspberries... Nothing is better. The Crème Brûlée itself was fluffy goodness under a crisp, warm blanket of wonderful caramelized sugar.After dessert, the waiter surprised us with a special treat: Truffles filled with a Banana Cinnamon mixture and a chocolate sign that read \"Happy Birthday\"! I loved the combination, and the waiter even ran back and grabbed me two more! My pal wasn't as fond of the truffles, but Banana Cinnamon is a bold combination that isn't really for everyone.In conclusion, even though at times it was a little wait before we could get something ordered, the experience here was very pleasant and it felt like the staff here put a lot of effort into making things special."}, {"review_id": "c6e-fNW_vEvxaQ9kzU6OHQ", "user_id": "XVTqV_zHUWC6BOfOsq3nRg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "This was the first time my two girlfriends and I stopped in for brunch on a Sunday morning.

Fresh biscuits and jam come to the table as well. We all loved the biscuits! Yum!! I went with the cinnamon roll and eggs Benedict, with a mimosa as my cocktail. Everything was delicious!
