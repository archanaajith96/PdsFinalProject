Left another local restaurant after aggressively poor service and trusted a local who directed us here. The outdoor patio feels like a secret garden oasis and then entire staff made us feel welcome. Both the charming bartenders made the wait feel like chatting with friends and were very handsome to boot. Our server was incredibly patient and helpful with dietary needs and ensured the safety of a guest by going to the chef and making sure a severe allergy wouldn't be triggered. After 12 years in the service industry I was so impressed. Finally- the food. Goodness gracious was the food amazing. Cheesy oyster bake. Double cut pork chop. The salmon. Oh my the salmon. Go. Now if you can. Eat everything. And tip well."}, {"review_id": "JAB_PBFoP8MEBKG4SVnKTQ", "user_id": "XeJsdwfhAjtvUaYP1oA5AA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "This was our dinner location after a fun day at the Jazz Fest. What a great meal and the outdoor courtyard dining area is just as nice. Knowing all restaurants would be busy because of the NBA games and Jazz Fest going on that weekend, we made all of our dinner reservations weeks in advance. That was a nice feeling to know we had that all out of the way and not having to wait on a waiting list.　Cafe Amelie is a quaint, well managed, clean restaurant right in the heart of the French Quarter district. The service was prompt and the meal preparation was spot on. The cocktails were also very well made as most are in NOLA.　Definitely a place that I would highly suggest and we would/will return to next time. P.S. The Brussels Sprouts a la planca was a fabulous starter choice!"}, {"review_id": "MO-YgP6eb03KqlaYcArbbw", "user_id": "rmHikSz-CJIlqo3AJBHBsw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Good food, beautiful patio.

Once entered into the gated entrance in the wall and stepping into this lovely courtyard, instantly you want to just hold your partners hand, it's that romantic. Floors of stone sections (possibly slate or granite), raise garden beds of moss covered red brick, lots of lush plants/trees (trimmed but done to seem natural and wild), iron wall sconces and benches, a very large fountain, the surrounding buildings were all either red brick or gray buildings with white windows and the tables were spread all around the open courtyard but none right on top of each other (a plus in keeping the atmosphere) and all accented with torch lamps.It's also worth mentioning that the restaurant does have an indoor dining area inside of the historic Carriage House.  * * * DRINKS * * * Of course they will make what you want but they do have a Seasonal Cocktail Menu with twists on local favorites and some of there own creativity.  I started off with their ROYAL STREET SAZERAC; actually it was my first Sazerac I ever had so with that said, I liked but not loved. But that was easily fixed with round two with a DEEP EDDY MULE (grapefruit mule); simply put, \"excellent\". My girl enjoyed a couple drinks as well. I have no idea what round what was because she was indecisive so the server asked her regular drinks and suggested a drink based on that.  Whatever it was she fully enjoyed; so much that she ordered the same for round two.* * * FOOD * * * Complimentary bread and butter was brought to the table while we chose an appetizer to share. The decision was tough as the Starter section of the menu was superb; we passed on the SHRIMP 'N GRITS (corn & andouille maque choux) and went for the AMELIE OYSTERS (creamed spinach and artichoke) which was suggested by our server and we saw pictures prior so we knew not to expect oysters on the half-shell cooked with the creamed spinach and artichoke.  Instead it's served more like a traditional spinach and artichoke dip except it was oysters mixed in; and it was served with toasted crostini... excellent dish. Marisol ended up ordering their PASTA SPECIAL consisting of ziti pasta with a spicy sauce accompanied by tomatoes, spinach, fresh mozzarella, thin shaved parmesan and delicious andouille sausage.I went with their popular COCHON DE LAIT SANDWICH (marinated pork with pickles and mayo on fresh ciabatta); a decision I did not regret.* * * WHEN IN THE BIG EASY * * * New Orleans is home to plenty of bars with drinks that are always associated with New Orleans like Sazerac, Ramos Fizz, French 75, Vieux Carré, Milk Punch and others... And the same goes with some dishes like Po' Boys, Crawfish Étouffée, Jambalaya, Seafood Gumbo, Beignets, Muffuletta and others.  But when looking for a place to have a meal in an amazing setting, with service being on par with the best and menu choices that have plenty of uniqueness and backed up with great taste, then Café Amelie is the place to be."}, {"review_id": "vPTW1f7UsHEtKjk3C8hObg", "user_id": "u7f0FYgEBko6BVJzCrFfdg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "This was my first time eating at Cafe Amelie. I have previously been here twice to try and eat both of which had very long waits of 2 hours. I highly recommend that you make a reservation before going in order to keep from having a long wait. They do not take same day reservations so call a day or two before you plan on going there. Unfortunately for us, it was rainy so the courtyard was closed. The inside part of the restaurant is nice, but very small and you can be very close to the tables around you. The ceiling inside is neat.I got the Amelie to drink which was very good. For a starter I got the shrimp and grits. It had a great Cajun flavor and was very tasty. The corn sauce on it was really good. I also got he chicken and waffles for my entree. It was a very nice portion and I wasn't able to finish it. The gravy threat came with it was great.

The ambiance was really nice since it feels like you're away from the hustle and bustle of the French Quarter, and the service was also good, but I didn't think the food was anything special.Our party of five each tried a different plate, including the roasted chicken, pork chop, pasta special, and salmon. Each were decent, but I wouldn't say they were anything special. Maybe I'm just spoiled by the great food already available in Los Angeles, but I didn't think this place deserved the number of high reviews it currently has. Anyway, I guess if you're looking for something different than the tourist type restaurants that mostly serve oysters, crawfish, etc, this is a good place to go, but I think as it currently sits, it's a bit overrated."}, {"review_id": "6B82dpbj-D_Zs4CNX5Scng", "user_id": "QfoIC-oZaHqjFRK9ng3Ynw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Great little spot for ladies brunch.

I tried the goat and beet salad and the crawfish pasta.The salad was fantastic, though it's hard to mess up a simple salad. The beets were roasted to perfection and it was served with a healthy heap of goat cheese, walnuts and aged balsamic. $12The crawfish salad was very rich- maybe a little too rich for me, but my boyfriend loved it. He was almost licking the plate towards the end. The cream sauce is heavy, cheesy and tomatoey.

The corn and andouille masque choux (the sauce on top) was delicious as well. Ugh...I want more but I live sooooo far from it. The Cajun country poutine was yummy too! It consisted of oven fries, mozzarella and slow cooked pulled pork with sauce from the pork. It was sooooo good! Highly recommend!We also got their daily special a pasta dish. That was good too, but nothing compared to the shrimp and grits and Cajun country poutine. This restaurant is located in a very charming old New Orleans house and courtyard. It had lots of character.

Very knowledgeable about the menu selections, both drinks & food.  He suggested a cocktail called Junta Superior.  It was one of those \"spicy\" drinks which normally I hate, but I figured I'd try it since he suggested it.  It was delicious!! With 2 of my favorite things (pineapple & habanero), I guess it was set up for success.  For the starter... we tried the Cajun Country Poutine.  You don't even understand the levels of amazing flavor this had.  I mean!!!!!!! I could only wish I was at home eating it so that I could devour it as opposed to having to eat with a little class . It was made with roasted fingerlings, mozzarella and cochon.By the way... at this time Michael was still very awesome!!For the meal... I had the double cut pork chop w/ corn maque choux served over creamy grits & green beans.  LISTEN!!!!!!! The picture I attach will speak to how AMAAAAAAAAZING this meal was.  Again... I would rather have been at home so I wouldn't have to eat with class.  That will go down as one of the top 5 meals that I have ever had.  Grits are so easy to mess up.  These were full of flavor & cooked to perfection.  Not runny, not grainy and not too stiff.  The corn maque choux... my goodness... and the pork chop... double cut?! Could easily be over cooked, but it wasn't.  It was PERFECTION!!! Again, refer to the picture.  This meal was so good that I'm absolutely going to try to recreate it as I do love to cook.The evening ended with a delicious doberge cake! It wasn't overly sweet, it was just right.  Everything about this night at Café Amelie was simply amazing.THANK YOU CAFÉ AMELIE & THANK YOU MICHAEL for an awesome start to my 40th year of life"}, {"review_id": "ZkwyQKCMZIpxAcptZjodpw", "user_id": "DcxcoEhjGI7s9GBR-EbbOg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "This is a neat place. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. The menu has lots of locally sources tastes. For starters, I'd recommend:- Poutine: Pleasant flavor. Pretty salty but good contrast with the Cajun spiced chicken in it. - Shrimp & grits: the shrimp are jumbo and juicy. The grits are mixed with cheese (and some sweetness from sugar)- Gumbo: not the absolute best gumbo I've ever had but still very good. The sausage especially had great flavor. For main dishes, check out- Ahi Tuna: succulent, tender, just the right amount of spice. Highly recommended. - Salmon: the horseradish sauce really knocks it out of the park. So yummy. - Lamb meatloaf: nice home style flavor. Great sauce as well.

Junta Superior $12 \"Fortaleza blanco tequila, ancho verde chili liqueur, lillet, lime, pineapple habanero syrup\":  Delicious!  It is as you would imagine with so many ingredients suggesting spice and heat.  Definitely has a kick but this spicy lemon drink is perfectly balanced, though that heat totally builds after sip after sip.  Loved it!  9/102. Glass of Kessler $93. Chicken and Andouille Gumbo $8:  Ultra salty, but otherwise thick and flavorful.  I also liked the big pieces of andouille sausage.  7/104. Cajun Country Poutine $10 \"oven fries, mozzarella and cochon\":  I think this was actually better than the real Canadian poutine we had in Canada!  Now... unfortunately some of the fries were significantly burnt.  But there was tons of flavor packed in.  The chicken was very dry though and again, it was ultra salty.  7/105. Oven Roasted Double-Cut Pork Chop $27 \"over creamy old mill grits and green beans\":  Well, I think if you follow my reviews you know what I am about to say:..... that's right.  It was DRY DRY DRY.  Why the F do chefs not test their pork chop recipes???  I really don't get it.  It ain't that hard.  When my gf makes it at home it's perfect.  These are pros right?  Get this--I even told the waiter to make sure it ain't dry!  He said it'll be cooked medium, but clearly it was super well done!  It was a shame cause it had great flavor and the grits were yummy.  Sadly... 3/106. Shrimp Cafe Pasta Special $26:  The pasta was overcooked, but still acceptable.  The sauce was spicy, kinda like a Cajun marinara.  The shrimp was just okay.  6/107. Rekorderlig Strawberry Lime Cider $5 \"Sweden, 12 oz can 4.5% ABV\":  Like a wine cooler heavy on strawberry.  Very smooth.  I'd say for what it is... 8/108. Illy Decaf Americano $49. Carlos VII Amontillado Sherry $9:  Very much like PX.  Plenty of raisins, but tastes light.  Very viscous with a very strong caramel taste.  Actually goes well with the super sweet cake, bringing out the citrus notes.  9/1010. Doberge Cake $10 \"thin cake layers with dessert pudding\":  GODDAM.  Out of this world!  Loads of almond flavor in the crust.  Tons of caramel flavor.  And that salt on top just finishes it all perfectly.  The best kind of sin!  10/10I loved eating in the gardens.  Unfortunately the food wasn't as great as the surroundings.  But still, if you want a special dinner without spending too much to get those love juices flowing, this would be a good choice.4/5#neworleans #frenchquarters #american #cajun"}, {"review_id": "kydEKd2yNA4-hcB_ON1pvw", "user_id": "wWJxjwbDFNbU0pb740LvJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "My favorite dinner spot in NOLA yet!
