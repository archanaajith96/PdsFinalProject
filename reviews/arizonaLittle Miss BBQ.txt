We arrived at 0910 (doors open at 11) on a Saturday morning. There were already people sitting in line waiting for the doors to open. The Pitmaster's father was handing out tickets to save our spot in line. All the staff were very inviting and friendly. We even got free samples of the sausage while we waited in line. The line moved quickly and we were able to get a table inside (seating is limited inside). Outside they have about 10 tables and misters lining the roof to keep you nice and fresh. Now the MEAT! All I can say is WOW. I was definitely impressed. The brisket was very juicy, tender, and full of flavor. Paired perfectly with the house BBQ sauce. The pork rib meat was falling off the bone. Overall, it was worth the wait and will definitely be going back whenever I'm in PHX!"}, {"review_id": "r4F-nU2kBeS2P6zjApSeOA", "user_id": "yyH5S9mMOADRehpTzqlO1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "If there were more stars for a review I would rate them with it.

Wow! Wow!  This place has a well deserved 5 star rating! I travel to Phoenix a couple of times a year and a couple of years ago I missed out on trying this place because my impatient ass didn't want to wait in the line,  but never again will I make that mistake.  I will wait as long as I have to for BBQ as good as this.   Waiting in line:  it looks long but it goes by quick and they are constantly updating the menu if they run out of things( they cover it with tape if they sell out) so  when you get to the front no surprises and it also helps with having your order ready when you get to the front.  while you wait.  they have some chairs for you to sit on and plenty of water to stay hydrated.  They have line rules.  like it's okay to save a spot in line for 1 or 2 people, but not a whole group which I loved!  and they have in the planters rocks for you to stack if you get bored. If you stack more than 13 you get a free pecan pie (personal size).you get to the front of the line and they actually let you sample the meats.  and their meat portions are great too.  they day I went they had pastrami and turkey which I love both but had never had BBQ-ed so I was iffy about them, but they were both freaking A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  so tender, juicy & flavorful.  Just plain melt in your mouth delicious.  I thought brisket was what I wanted and I did get that but got the pastrami as my second meat on my 2 meat plate and a side of turkey too- it was that good!   Got my plate with 2 sides and all the (free)  fixins just ask for them if you want them  (bread,onions, pickles, & jalapenos) I took it all outside and enjoyed it with all three of their sauces - also crazy delish! There wasn't a single thing that I didn't love at Little Miss BBQ and on top of that they have the sweetest friendliest staff.  I had an excellent experience.  The food and customer service are equally great.  If I could give them 10 stars I would.  They're the Best!"}, {"review_id": "_JswqPXVZ9eQiQJ0lIWzCg", "user_id": "t1HdYXIzIuooNDXC09iiBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Yes this place has the best bbq in Arizona if you're willing to put in the wait! The story goes, some guy who used to work at Franklins, probably the most famous barbeque joint in Austin, TX came to Arizona and decided to bring a little bit of Texas with him.  And I gotta say, this place does not disappoint! I definitely end up spending a lot more than I actually plan on spending, but it's the anticipation and wait that makes you do that. You literally will have to wait 1-2 hrs if you get there right at 11am. Definitely get the beef ribs if they're serving them. The sliced brisket is so juicy and melts in your mouth. I highly recommend getting the fattier kind. The pork ribs are good as well along with some sausages. They're super smoked tasting, and would be sooo good in a sandwich. I never bother with pulled pork and chopped brisket because I feel it'll taste the same anywhere I go. As for the sides, you HAVE to get jalapeño grits!!!! End it with a homemade personal pecan pie, it's super delicious! So I will say, the reason why the line is so long because once you get inside the shop, there's only one guy cutting the meats for you and weighs it, they really take their time to cut you the freshest and best pieces of meat. And can you imagine if a guy in front of you orders like 10 lbs of meat! That's why it takes so long! And yes the wait sometimes is brutal, sometimes even demoralizing and you just wanna go home. So is it worth it? It depends on your mood, you definitely can't go here on your lunch break, cause it's definitely gonna take more than an hour. But yes, the quality of the meat is #1! There's no other place in Arizona that has that good of meat! However I do rate on my whole entire experience not just on the food, and I would say I kinda like Joe BBQ more for the overall experience, not having to wait in such a long line, and the additional things they serve. But all in all, I still would highly recommend coming here if you're in the mood for some bbq. Tips:1) they open at 11, if you don't wanna wait a long time, get there an hour earlier, bring your headphones, bring a book, bring a chair, bring something!2) whatever you plan on spending, double it just in case, for some reason I always end up spending over $1003) share with friends, it's a lot better 4) get the beef ribs, pork ribs, sliced fatty brisket, and sausage, skip the rest5) if you want sides, get the jalapeño grits! It's the bomb 6) there's 3 kinda of sauce, ask for them all, they're very accommodating7) there's pickles and jalapeños and stuff for free if you like that stuff"}, {"review_id": "OHJdN8SpHsJCuUmnricuZg", "user_id": "_jqTa-3-fqmBxnkANJHtFw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "To think that we almost didn't come here was absolute blasphemy.When we drove into town from California on Saturday, we called them and were told it would be a two hour wait. We were too hungry to wait that long and didn't know that this place is closed on Sundays and Mondays. We were leaving Arizona on Tuesday afternoon and we just had to squeeze this place in because of all the great things we've heard about it. I'm so so so glad we made room to come here.They are open Tuesday through Saturday 11am-4pm or until they run out (which I'm sure has happened before). There's an okay-sized parking lot but trust me when I say it will fill up extremely quickly. We came at 9:30am and there were only three cars in the parking lot and a couple people waiting in line. A lot of people started coming at 10am (an hour before they open) and by 10:15am the parking lot was full and there is a line around the parking lot.The cool thing is they have chairs for you to sit on while you wait, a cover for shade, and water to stay hydrated. Even better was that when we were in line, we got to sample their sausage which was a delicious tease. And now onto the best part...We ordered two plates with two sides. Our first plate was brisket with coleslaw and potato salad, and our second plate was pork ribs with coleslaw and jalapeno cheddar grits. We wanted to try the beef ribs but were told they only serve them on Saturdays. The brisket just melts in your mouth. It's so tender you don't even need a knife to cut through it.

I'd suggest bringing something to do cause the line can take time. When the time is right, James will come out and give the whole line a pep rally over the deliciousness that will be in your possession. He gets the crowd ready and someone will come out to offer everyone samples. I'm not sure if that's an everyday thing but lord a bite of their sausage was good. Each plate comes with two sides so we got the pork rib and brisket. We got the jalapeno grits, potato salad, and slaw for sides. The icing on the cake was their pecan pie. Their brisket was so good, probably the best I've had so far. It was beyond melt in your mouth. Their ribs didn't look huge or super beefy but it was when you bit into it. I'm usually not a grits person but the spicy kick made it taste so much better. Their pecan pie is also very delicious but it was a lot to eat after that huge meal we had.

Little Miss BBQ has always scared me. I've read the reviews and heard all the buzz. But when you take into account their limited hours and long lines, it's not the kind of place that you can just pop into on a whim for a quick bite. And it's certainly not the kind of place that you can just visit on your lunch break during the work week. No, going to LMBBQ is a full-blown event that one must mentally prepare for.Since both my girlfriend and I had some vacation time from work, we decided to finally make a day out of it. I warned her beforehand that we had to get there before opening, or else we'd be waiting around and risk the restaurant running out of meat. She didn't believe me. Hell, I'm not even sure I believed it - until I drove up 30 minutes before opening and saw a crowd of people lined up at 10:30 in the morning on a Wednesday. A Wednesday for Christ's sake! We've been put on some pretty lengthy waitlists in the past, as well as toughed it out with long lines, but it's definitely rare to see something like this in Phoenix. Despite getting there before opening, we still waited a little over two hours in order to get inside. In many ways, it reminded me of being at a theme park and waiting in line for a rollercoaster - further enhanced by the enthusiastic man with the megaphone psyching up customers before opening their doors. While waiting, we were given samples of their sausage, as well as \"meat updates\" about what they were running out of. Here I was, thinking that since we got that before opening, we wouldn't run into these issues. Unfortunately, within an hour, the fatty brisket was gone, with the lean brisket being eliminated shortly afterwards. Apparently, people are known to buy large quantities of meat and then freeze it for future use. Thanks to the whole \"meat market\" approach some customers take, I'm stuck with pulled pork and chopped brisket. Bloody hell! It's funny because, once you get inside, you'd have absolutely no idea of just how packed the outside of the restaurant is. It feels just like going into any other tiny little BBQ joint where you order at the counter. People were friendly and things ran very smoothly. No trouble with seating, which was one of my biggest fears.So, I guess the question is: Does this BBQ really live up to all the hype?It's good. Very good, in fact! Both the chopped brisket and pulled pork I ordered were both extremely moist and tender to the point where they will damn-near melt in your mouth. Flavor and high quality were definitely present in everything, including the extra sausage I ordered for myself. Hell, even the cheddar-jalapeno grits and beans were well executed - a recurring problem most BBQ joints have by skimping on side quality. But throughout the whole meal, my girlfriend and I kept asking ourselves: Is this really all that better than what can be obtained at other reputable places in Phoenix?Honestly, I don't know. It's very difficult to say. Everyone raves about the fatty brisket and the fact that I didn't get to try it makes me feel like I might have been missing out on what this place is most known for. Unfortunately, it's unlikely that we'll be able to find the time to set aside several hours of our day in order to eat here anytime soon, so I might have to wait until they finally open up their second location. Allegedly, this will be a more traditional restaurant that will hopefully be a little easier to get into, as well as offering an expanded menu.On a side note, their smoked pecan pie was spectacular!Overall, I feel that Little Miss BBQ is excellent. And I definitely can see why people like it. No, it's not the best I've ever tried, as those types of places usually require venturing out of Arizona. But as for Phoenix? Well, it's a worthy contender, but I think I'll reserve my full opinion for when I have the opportunity to finally try that damned fatty brisket that somehow managed to elude me. It won't happen again, I promise you that!Highly recommended - provided you have about three or more hours to spare in the middle of your day."}, {"review_id": "gsG5DXPbdNW9pUxmZz0-Gg", "user_id": "vL-7Z3rtMYLbY-L7Xd0JAw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "What a gem-if you are anywhere nearby and like good BBQ -you've got to try this place.Located in an industrial area near the airport this place is the picture postcard for a tiny bbq joint.  Expect a line and a wait-note they open at 11 (Tue-Sat only) and close at 4 or whenever they run out of food. So plan for a nice big lunch.We high-tailed it over directly from the airport after landing and arrived around 12:45 and there was still a line and a helpful employee providing updates (orally) on what was Running out.  Even though their smokers are the size of steam engines, they do run out of food.  The line moved rather slowly (depends on what those ahead are ordering)-maybe 20 minutes for us.They serve all the classic bbq goodies but brisket is their top seller.  The pulled pork, sausages and smoked turkey were also tempting my taste buds but I opted for the classic brisket sandwich with one side (nice tangy coleslaw). They also have their own sauces-regular, mustard and \"spicy\" (which wasn't TOO spicy-very nice).  The sandwiches were loaded with tender succulent brisket cut by hand to order (hence the wait) and piled high.  Melted in my mouth.  Side dish options include coleslaw (great), beans, grits and potato salad.There are a few tables inside and a covered patio around back but lots of folks were getting things to go.  There also is a small parking lot and we got a spot without a problem.A must try for anyone who want great bbq but go early for best selection.Highly recommended"}, {"review_id": "1reH9FXZzTfM242MoJsxpg", "user_id": "UnDZKN0LbEYZ7YUO37fWaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "The bbq is out of this world delicious and the staff couldn't be nicer.

I got the two meat plate: Brisket, turkey, jalapeno cheddar grits and ranch style beans.  There are complimentary fixings available such as white bread, onions, pickles, and their amazing sauces (homemade, spicy, and honey mustard).  There were excellent flavors all around.  I think this has been said already... but BELIEVE THE HYPE!  The food was amazing and I didn't eat again until hours and hours later.  Just take the advice: get there early!  I don't know how consistent it is, but I noticed that the line seemed to be at its shortest around the 12:30 - 1:00 time block.  Truly incredible."}, {"review_id": "on3ns2vIm1-RhxeeUaKfbw", "user_id": "DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Update 2/10/2018G.O.A.T.Today I did my usual drive-by sampler.  I will wrap some in Saran Wrap and butcher paper and freeze.Today my sampler1.
