They have their own parking lot, serve brunch, a wide range of coffee selections like a cafe, a bar, a full service restaurant, AND THE SERVICE IS AMAZING. I walked out of The Half Door a couple blocks down after being ignored by staff who wouldn't even take our order. I didn't want to go too far and Tisane was close by. What a complete 180; we were seated by a nice gentleman who told us who our server would be. She came by right away and asked us what we would like to drink. Our waitress, Cassie, was attentive, kind, and delightful to interact with. We ordered the Texas Red Eye and the Southern Belle. Both were delicious. But I loved the Texas Red Eye. The sauce on it was different and new; it was delicious. I dipped my potatoes and my boyfriends biscuit from his southern belle dish. From the first glance, it doesn't look like a lot of food. But we were stuffed. The price is really good for brunch compared to other local brunch places in the area. I also took a look at their dinner menu and it looks amazing. Judging by how good my brunch experience was, I know dinner will be just as amazing or better."}, {"review_id": "O958z7A6PxeYdInPvTG1uw", "user_id": "GTGqLImmRJ-gxkpN8T8CUQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/24/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I legitimately hate to have to do this. My partner and I went into Tisane on Sunday and we were just sorely disappointed. Or maybe he was indifferent but I was totally disappointed. We walked in, albeit late for brunch but they were still serving. They took some time to seat us which didn't make much sense initially. It made more sense if you watched what was going on with the staff. It seemed like 2pm on a Sunday was prime time for some flirting with your significant other who either also worked there or who happened to seated in your area. I'm glad they have a good time at work but it was at the expense of the service to their customers. After finally being seated our waitress came over and we both ordered Little Havana's. My partner asked for a third egg. A few minutes later someone from the kitchen came out and said they were out of the pork so we got bacon instead. Last time we were there before it was done. This time they were out. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ When our food came, he had four eggs and I had three. And not one of my yolks was runny in the slightest. All three were essentially hard boiled except one was a little soft in the middle. He had one of four that was runny. And they were out of the sweet potato home fries. I was missing the runny yolk but the dish itself was still ok. Overall I was really frustrated with them. I hope that if we go back we get better service and better food."}, {"review_id": "QlnRqAwyANS_KOiS4XIgmg", "user_id": "MIJ6XeneTBYa7LiRDlTs8Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Overall: Kind of disappointingCame here for a late lunch to avoid parking troubles. Parking will definitely be a challenge during peak hours. But even during off hours, the restaurant is extremely loud.We ordered calamari, lo mien, espresso steak, and chocolate fondue. Calamari was pretty good and we enjoyed the flavor (not the crispy kind). Lo mien was very average. Espresso steak - steak was not bad but mashed potatoes were on the bland side and tasted more like it was made from a box. And finally, the most disappointing part was the fondue. The fondue took the longest to arrive. It wasn't even hot...or warm... The fondue was lukewarm, as if it was being melted by candlelight (refer to photo)."}, {"review_id": "7Z9XDiOPHBKz5myEL8n-8A", "user_id": "EBozJrcKS2uiGXkIc-dUsg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "Oh I used to love Tisane brunch, but yesterday was just disappointing. I feel like they must have been out of spices or something because the food was flavorless. We came around 1pm (brunch is served until 3) and they were sold out of the Cinnadaze (seriously looked amazing), had 1 Little Havana left and were out of the gravy that accompanies the Southern Belle. That being said, our server did let us know about the limitations up front and suggested a substitution for the gravy. I was super excited about the scramble of the day which was tofu, tomatoes, and feta. Again, it didn't taste well-seasoned, so I ended up putting a lot of hot sauce on it. The biggest disappointment was the Bloody Mary. It basically tasted like tomato juice watered down with pickle juice. There was no kick! The Cajun spiced Bloody Mary should have been spicy according to the menu, but it tasted like water (which made me think there probably wasn't any vodka in it). What I will say is this, the service is friendly and efficient, and the coffee is awesome! The prices are great for brunch- but probably at the expense of quality."}, {"review_id": "_BEg0t7PEFArMkP7RIP2tg", "user_id": "EfCuN2O6LHmxUleYT1_JeQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Great spot for dinner. Packed on a Friday night. Got seats after a short wait. For drinks, we got the flower Pom and your mom, liked the former better. The latter was good though more on the sour side and bit strong. Got the steak crostini and the sesame salmon for food. The steak crostini was delicious. Salmon was good though the lo mein was bit salty.

I ordered a Sesame Salmon which is quite good but could use more flavor and a side salad (which was delicious and came in generous portion). He ordered Buffalo Chicken Steak which was too salty for him and he wasn't able to eat it at all, he also ordered Steak Crostini which he finished all and said it was pretty good. That night he ordered the Espresso Steak which again he could only eat half of it since the meat was a pretty bad cut. We also ordered the BBQ Chicken Spring Rolls which were okay. Warning that the Far East Nachos comes in massive portion, it was too much food and tasted bland. Server should have informed us that the portion is that much when we placed our order. The Wings Trio was also just-okay with the hoisin buffalo sauce, general tso's, and thai curry. He did like his General Tso's chicken but the broccoli was overcooked and mushy. Highlight of the meal was the Peanut Butter Fondue, oh my God I died and went to heaven - multiple foodgasm.Cocktails are definitely Tisane's strength. We ordered Supple Row (which basically is just Screwdriver), Memoirs of Geisha (really love the sake in this one), and Chocolate Covered Strawberry Martini (love this one as well!); and off their Happy Hour menu we ordered Savannah (he loves this one), Floral Forward (not our favorite but still good), Creamsicle (which definitely is a booze version of orange creamsicle), Pom Mango (good and fruity), Mai Tai (quite good), Voodoo Child (very similar to Chocolate Covered Strawberry but minus the strawberry and a bit of coffee flavor), but the clear winner was Punchy Dragon - I ordered 4 glasses of the Punchy Dragon and would come back for this cocktail and the fondue alone.The girl who first saw us who was at the cash register by the entrance had a really sour face when greeting us, she looked so miserable being there... almost made me want to walk back out of that place, thinking we would have to deal with a sour face during our entire time there if she would be our waiter. Thankfully, our waiters on both visits were fast and friendly. Our hotel was out of power due to the storm and we asked their favor to charge our phones at the back which they were happy to do so. And during the happy hour, the bar area was packed (as well as the dining was also pretty full). We sat at the bar and could see that the guests are all regulars and they've known the bartenders and all the employees for quite a while. It's a really nice atmosphere!In conclusion, Tisane is great for hanging out and have a good time and serve killer cocktails and great for snacking, but a bit lacking for entree meals. We'll come back for more of their martinis and their amazing fondue!"}, {"review_id": "hj66cPjBwUIJNgtjJqiSYw", "user_id": "fpJenf7KXCh-jGmyr4QWGw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/11/2018", "text": "I've had very great experiences at tisane. The food is so tasty and I love the intimate environment. A few months ago I visited with a friend. We decided to split a turkey burger because we really stopped in for a drink but wanted a little bite. Since the server knew we'd be splitting the entree, they served us each our half of portion on separate plates. That was a nice touch that I appreciated. There appetizers are amazing with a selection for everyone. This place can get pretty packed and has a DJ certain nights. VERY FUN! Also. This girl loves a martini and their martini selection left me drooling. My fav is the purple haze!

I do have some concerns aside from these things, though. We arrived around 4pm on a Tuesday. Parking was nonexistent. They have a lot that they share with a laundry mat, and parking spaces have signs assigned to both Tisane and the laundry mat. All of the spaces (maybe 10-12?) assigned to Tisane were taken. I drove around and around, across the street, down the street trying to find on street parking. I finally found a spot that was questionable, as there was a sign there but the lettering was worn off - so it very well may have beenA no parking area. This kind of parking hassle just kind of sours the initial experience. Inside, it's quaint and eclectic. We grabbed a table by the front patio entrance which was a bad idea - people were continually going in and out of this door to smoke. Even with the doors shut the cigarette smoke was strong and the draft was even stronger. Not a good seating location. We asked for happy hour menus and were told to hang on. We literally hung on for about 15 minutes before I got up and asked another server for them. I was told they print new HH menus every Tuesday and they were not ready yet (by this point it was about 4:25, on a Tuesday, and HH started at 4). I asked, \"would our server know the specials?\" To which the girl behind the tea/coffee counter replied \"No. we have new specials every Tuesday. You're just going to have to wait for the menus to be printed\" yikes, okay. Finally got the menu and we were pleasantly surprised. A nice list of martinis and apps, all for $5. We ordered one of each appetizer and they were delicious. The calamari was amazing. The martinis were good - a little on the sweet side but still very tasty. We also ordered a cheese fondue tray. It was pretty good! My favorite accompaniment was he grilled artichokes and the crispy wontons. Overall, the experience started off negatively with the service and the parking but the food and drink redeemed this place."}, {"review_id": "W-7oImClQaNDz0kIVWDB_w", "user_id": "f8gNFGMwiG3DP15GE1oYAw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Disappointing trip to Tisane.

Very nice, modern coffee/tea house with some really unique brunch options. I ordered a Honey Vanilla Latte. **Warning!** Their lattes are huge. A normal latte comes with two shots of espresso. A double comes with 4! Needless to say, I was living dangerously that day and went with the quad shot double latte. In order to try and quell the raging caffeine storm circulating through my body, I ordered the Havana from the brunch menu. It's like a Cuban version of eggs benny, with three poached eggs over a bed of sweet potatoes and sliced pork, topped with a lovely hollandaise. Parking is a little bit tight at Tisane, but you can park in the plaza across the street if necessary. Check out Tisane and live boldly with a quad shot latte and some delicious food."}, {"review_id": "cfAyP3Qkh5u0FP2EfkMBrQ", "user_id": "OVF9mZMBUEFPY2I-lLzkgA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/13/2017", "text": "I have been going to Tisane since before I left CT, which was over a decade ago!

However, the drinks were unique and well made, the food looked as awesome as it tasted, and when we did get service it was very friendly, professional and pleasant. So much so that when I reminded our waitress of the macchiato I ordered that never came, she rushed it out and took it off the bill. Thanks very much for that. All in all we had a great time.

The drinks are reasonably priced, the DJ was fabulous, and by the end of the night the dance floor was electric.
