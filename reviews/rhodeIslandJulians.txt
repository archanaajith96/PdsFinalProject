We've been here a few times, it's always busy, always fresh and always new things on the specials menu to offer.Love the vegan options as well! Today is the tofu scramble with beats corn and roasted pub Llano peppers. It was delicious.My husband ordered the veggie egg wrap and it was also wonderful. The hash today was awesome as usual and everything came out steaming hot and fresh from the kitchen.Great specialty cocktails awesome!Always busy loud restaurant as it is very small. So if you're looking for a quiet brunch on a Sunday morning, this is not your spot but the food is great atmosphere's lively and it's a definite go to spot in the area."}, {"review_id": "i0Ft8RB9TXK0u3-wf3xZuQ", "user_id": "LkYXWBIupp915Tsft8xb2Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "It seems like Julian's is packed on the weekends and we were lucky to snag a table when we came on a Saturday night. The owner(?) greeted us and he was super friendly. Quickly seated and flipped through the menu, there's a good amount of options for meat and veggie eaters. Since I was DD, I didn't order drinks, but my fellow diners said their drinks were good. In fact, two ordered another round because it was so good.FOOD! - General Gao's cauliflower: I usually stay away from anything labelled \"General Gao's\", call me a Chinese food snob. It was fried crispy cauliflower, drenched in a dark brown sauce. It was sweet and salty, very savory and I kept wanting more. The sauce was made with hoisin sauce, ginger, maybe some soy. Not the orange sauce you'd expect, still very good. Would order again. - Special burger, replace burger with seitan: the burger came with blue cheese, jalapenos, bacon. I've never had seitan, the texture was a little rubbery/chewy, kind of like a fish cake. It did not go well with the blue cheese and the burger needed more sauce (it was dry). Overall not a fan, but I'd be interested to try the other dishes with seitan or maybe a regular burger with no blue cheese. - Short rib sandwich: my partner ordered this and he finished it, but found the sandwich to be soggy because it was drenched in the broth. I mean, who likes to eat soggy bread? The short rib was tender, but needed some more salt and seasoning. - Fries: very crispy and just the right size! Decor was nice and servers were attentive. FYI - reservations only for parties of 5 or bigger. At Julian's, any meat can be replaced with seitan. A solid choice if you are looking for a vegetarian-friendly restaurant. Oh, they also have a big pez collection and cartoon playing in the bathroom!"}, {"review_id": "9P_Yl4pqfUzyMcNyuPVVrw", "user_id": "ebly71grTOrr_1x13pseHQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "I have heard a lot of great things about Julian's so I gave it a try.

I've been here a couple of times since my last review and have since then come to love this place (just for brunch :)) Love all of their Benedicts', esp their Desperado benedict. Half size is plenty. Also love their thee weeping toreador omelet. The jedi mind trick is alright, as is their sausage hash. Their home fries def have a bit of curry/spice flavor to them and is different from most places. Portion sizes are quite big usually. For drinks, their bloody mary is alright, haven't had a really good one there as such. They do have a long list of mimosas and good selection of craft beers otherwise. Overall, great place for brunch. Come early. Service has usually been good."}, {"review_id": "gTmC9ymp4AOMzqJ_JYkuiw", "user_id": "UQ3mNnkmZpD5Ynd_XCzi2w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "It's good. That's really all I can say about this place. There's nothing wrong with it, but there's a lot of hype and I've never really figured out why. It's very hip, the decor is very cool (which I give points for); the staff is always adequate (except one time I went the waiter didn't know a SINGLE thing on the menu it was like he was seeing it for the first time), but the food is pretty good.I think it's OK, a little over-priced for what it is. They do have some good veggie options - but that's not so special in these days. I guess its worth checking out but it doesn't really live up to its reputation."}, {"review_id": "f2jjKT8Plbxtro4qIp3S5w", "user_id": "SRofdaubnNoLx6wiqS4kBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Just got into Providence and the concierge suggested Julian's.

The only downside, it was busy...which was fun...but it was pretty noisy.

You are what boozy brunch dreams are made of! As first timers--and new to the East Coast--I can honestly say that your short rib hash with dijon hollandaise sauce was pure delectable magic, and your Kimchi bowl with thick cut bacon will keep me coming back like the brunch crazed addict that I am. Tons of great mimosa options to fulfill your heart's desire--pomegranate, mango, pineapple and more!!

I was here almost every weekend. I moved to Vegas for a few years and came back recently. I knew when my parents came to visit I had to come here. My mom loved the menu and the unique specials. My parents aren't vegan but they eat it for me when we go out. They loved both their meals and that made me so happy. Their sausage tempeh is unreal. It has such a great flavor to it. However my vegan banana French toast came out with bacon in the French toast somehow. I know they use separate grills so I don't know how that happens. I almost ate a bite of it when I saw it and got so upset. I gave it to my mom to eat because I was done with it at that point. She gave me her tofu scramble which was sweet. The server asked how everything was and I was very honest. The staff was sweet and empathetic. I was just honestly grossed out by it. I want to come back and get it again honestly because the bites I had were great. I just hope they can avoid these situations that normally would scare off a guest. I know the potential and skills of this place to trust myself to come back again. Just hope it's a better food experience.Server staff 100%. Thank you!"}, {"review_id": "s03tCP7097vl0G_c8zj6Lg", "user_id": "L9FXfeo7YhQH9EQlAre8Nw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/6/2017", "text": "Great staff, mediocre food. We waited about 30 minutes before being seated on a Sunday brunch. Maybe it is because I heard great things about this place.. but it felt like the food here was quantity over quality. We had the Egg Benedict classic (half) and the avocado (half), winger, and pancakes with walnuts to share. The Egg Benedict was served on very thick Italian bread which was definitely too much. It was hard to cut up any part of the bread and you would have to really work to take a bite of the bread, eggs, and toppings at once. I ended up taking the bread off my plate and eating just the poached eggs with the bacon/avocado. The presentation of food was overwhelming and it felt like people making the food was not very mindful of the actual part of eating.I would say the winger is better labeled hang-over food. It was extremely greasy and not something you would normally eat for a breakfast/brunch.In regards to the pancakes with walnuts? Don't do it.. The pancake was not fully cooked and powdery. We normally don't complain about our food even if it is bad, but we ended up letting the waiter know. He kindly took it off our bill, which we appreciated. Overall, I don't think I'll be back. The restaurant was also extremely loud and you would need to really lean into each other to if you wanted to talk without raising your voice."}, {"review_id": "LpdGErCf7i2_992B8A1JvA", "user_id": "JlloB24xkeN2DW_f8jS9mQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/18/2017", "text": "This place is totally worth the hype, and the wait you may have to endure.We came before 9 on a Saturday and were able to put out names in. It's a tight squeeze waiting inside. We watched as more and more people came in to put their name in, each time a little longer of a wait was told. While you wait you can enjoy a drink, and if it's a nice day out you can enjoy that drink outside not crammed inside waiting.After about 20 minutes we were seated. I ordered a an original mimosa and my husband ordered a mango mimosa. Absolutely delicious! For our meals I ordered the Florentine Benedict (half order) with the hash browns and in addition ordered the sweet potato hash on the side. Absolutely amazing! My husband got the steak and mushroom omelet and he loved it! We both couldn't finish and are excited about our leftovers!Great atmosphere, pleasant staff, amazing food and drinks.

Seemed like seating was nearly anarchy with seating too small of a group at the only places to fit 4+ which made the 40 mins estimate take much much longer. Still they were nice and apologetic so just know its going to be a bit.Took their recommendation to get the bloody mary. Boy did that have a kick! Its a great sipper that I would order again. My salmon and caper omelette (I forget the real name) was yummy with plenty of fish. I think they overdid the capers which should be a supporting flavor rather than peppering them in as if they were tomatoes. The boursin cheese smoothed out the flavor so I still recommend it.Great dinner options too, so if the Sunday morning wait is a deterrent, try it another night."}, {"review_id": "8nB70bZ2OXhT5KkfNJnyxQ", "user_id": "b_TVcfvfmMd532KG9vwMYA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "The wait alone is really part of the experience!

Seriously. You are missing out if you haven't. Everything from the coffee to the mimosas to the eggs Benedict makes it the perfect, most satisfying brunch experience you can have. The avocado Benedict had a literal WHOLE avocado. I feel like I am always complaining about the stinginess of restaurants when they use avocados in dishes. This alone made me fall in love with the place. Yes, you will probably be waiting 45 minutes to get a table but, guess what? You can order drinks and coffee and sit outside while you wait. It makes the wait totally bearable and fly by. Not only for brunch though, this place is great for some late night food and drinks. I love the open windows and atmosphere when the weather is nice. The service is always awesome, even when they are at full capacity, we never have felt like we have to go out of our way to get the attention of the server. The menu is huge and as a vegetarian, I love that I feel like they are catering to me. Parking is definitely annoying around here but never impossible.

The first time I had the Desperado Eggs benedict and couldn't wait to go back and have that again.  For the Desperado, I only get the half size which is huge. They also serve great Mimosas. I do suggest to get here early, it gets busy quick. The first time we came it was about a 45 minute wait. Since it was cold we waited in the car right in front of the entrance door. The guy actually came to the car when we were up to be seated, which I thought was very nice. The second time we came right when they opened and within 30 minutes it was packed. The service for the most part is good. The second visit we did has a few issues. We pretty much had to ask for everything. ex, can we get cream for the coffee, then wait.... It wasnt enough so had to ask for more and wait. By this time the coffee was cold. Also we were given milk and not cream. There were no spoons, so instead of asking and waiting we used our knives. Can we have ketchup....and wait. Can we have jelly and wait..... We also ordered a side of pancakes and they were not brought out with our orders. So I had to ask on of the servers about it and was told they would bring them right out and take it off the bill. At least they were nice enough to do that. But we didnt get the pancakes until we were done eating and now full. So we had a few bites, we dont like reheated breakfast food so didnt take anything to go."}, {"review_id": "Elt_zPTtGYaxhSabdaSJkA", "user_id": "TQlFMdfbypxOukJMP9wRHA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Great fluffy pancakes.
