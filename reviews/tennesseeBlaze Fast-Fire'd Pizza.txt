Don't bother with the nasty buffet pizza places.

I dont think I made it THAT obvious that it was my first time,lol) I answered yes...so she walked me through the process. I ordered thin crust and chose The Vine pizza which had fresh mozzarella,tomatoes, and basil.... Best part...  they have a bar full of veggies you can add or pack on ya pizza... Oh wait thats not the best part... The best part is  that the final step is that your pizza is thrown in a Blazing oven... Haha see what I did there.

Pick your sauce, cheeses (always multiple lol), toppings, and optional drizzle...regardless of your choices, the price stays the same. The combinations are basically limitless, but I like to stay in my Greek/Mediterranean comfort zone. The most dazzling element of Blaze is the oven. It's an honest to goodness screaming hot pizza oven, and it makes all the difference. The finished product is perfectly textured and slightly charred. It's insanely good. Another huge plus here? The customer service. As busy as they get during lunch, employees and management alike do their best to get your order out as quickly as possible. Pro tip: when you order online, you skip the line. Check in the at the register, and they cook your already assembled pizzas once you arrive. This way, they're just as fresh! Oh, and you must try the agua Frescas/blood orange lemonade.

I would rank Blaze over any of the delivery pizza places in the area but at the end of the day they are still fast food. I usually order ahead online so when I get there I can walk straight to the cashier and have them fire my order. The drink selection is nice as they have more than the typical soda selections by Coke and Pepsi. Off of food alone I would rate them 4 Stars however my most recent experience with their service has pushed them to a 5. I ordered online before picking up my kids from school and had every intention on taking the food home to eat. My toddler got hangry so I changed my order to in house dining after they had begun to box them up. We ate and boxed up the leftovers to go and made the mistake of letting the elder child hold their pizza which was promptly dropped on the floor. The manager came over and gave us not only a coupon for free pizza during a future visit, he also offered to replace the dropped pizza on the spot which we graciously declined."}, {"review_id": "CgHFKHpmEJTTILxZboKbdQ", "user_id": "zA2g1ZZ2W6DLSy7Jbc6AqQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "The pizza is very good and the employees are very pleasant!

It makes me drool. I love the beet aruguala salad. Great price as well!I usually get the White Top and the hubs gets the Meat Eater. Nice thin simple crust with great flavor. They don't over do them. Honestly you can't go wrong. It's a good size for just yourself and take some slices home if you want. We don't...we always smash it! HaLove the set up. The staff is always super rad and on it! They call your name when your food is ready and I love they always ask if you have been there before so if not they can tell you how it works. I lovvvvve the in-house made drinks. I get a mint agave water something and he gets the prickly pear something! Soooooo yummies!Check it out!

First time trying a Blaze pizza and was impressed from the moment I walked in the door! Friendly staff, they stopped to explain their ordering process and walked me through building my own pizza. Nothing fancy, I ordered a pineapple and Canadian ham pizza with classic sauce, mozzarella, a little sea salt and oregano on a thick crust. All I can say is that I normally post pics, but with a long and exhausting travel day from Baltimore, I Hoovered it!! Sorry.  It was delicious!! Stop in and try this place! There's plenty of parking because it's in a shopping center and plenty of seating too. I was in and out in 10 minutes on a Wednesday at 5:45. AND they sell beer!!

They use a wide variety of fresh ingredients.  Want a spinach, artichoke garlic with fresh mozzarella?  No problem.  A meat pie with over 10 different choices? No worries.  You can get it here.For me the crust makes the pizza.  They use a thin crust that reminded of my days in Rome.  Put that thin crust into a 800° F oven and you have a great crispy crust.Price is not bad for the quality at around $9.  Give it a try."}, {"review_id": "pz1L1Baep-u2UYfwAw-C5w", "user_id": "oAf9OkoaeE252ijLydHUqA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/7/2016", "text": "Great pizza, thin crust (my favorite), free toppings (wait what?!), inexpensive (under $10), friendly service -- and they don't accept tips! Their service level wow'd me the most - super welcoming, explained how their pizza building process works, offering to add other toppings along the way ... I wanted to tip but their receipt didn't have a tip line and they didn't have a tip jar. Enjoying their pizza made the lunch even more tip-worthy so we tried to tip them afterwards - they wouldn't accept it. They said just spread the good word. Seriously. And no kidding, everyone looked happy to work there :) If you're like me, sometimes it's hard to know what pizza toppings to get - I recommend choosing one of their specialty pizzas as a starting point. All the pizzas are $7.95 and you can add/substitute toppings at no additional cost. Agree w/ the other reviewers' comparison to Chipotle- they add toppings in front of you and it's easy to customize. Dough is made from scratch, and it takes just 180 seconds in the oven. Get your drinks, set up your table and by then your pizza is probably ready. Ordered 2 pizzas for 3 people - 6 slices per pizza, plenty for us, and we had a couple slices for leftovers. BBQ CHKN PIZZA - $7.95Grilled chicken, mozzarella, red onion, banana peppers, skipped the gorgonzola, added roasted garlic, artichoke and roasted red peppers. No sauce - just BBQ sauce drizzled at the end. But again you can change out the sauce if you want. Yum.LINK IN PIZZA - $7.95Italian sausage (very good), roasted red peppers, sauteed onions, mozzarella, red sauce - added spinach, mushrooms and pineapple. Also yum. Parents loved it - they'll definitely be back. Me too when I'm in town."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/blaze-fast-fired-pizza-knoxville?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
