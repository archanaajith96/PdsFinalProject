Glad we Yelped while here in Mobile and found the \"sweet spot\". I had a pulled pork sammich, my wife had the chicken salad and we both got Mac & Cheese for the sides. We also got an order of the local smoked sausage.I can summarize it all.... delicious! The place was busy yet we received our order right away. The staff was super friendly and helpful. It seems like a really family oriented place and the Mobile weather was just right for outdoor eating. Definitely will be on our stop next trip through."}, {"review_id": "X-kWKc_oLecp6WCkAD8EwA", "user_id": "L2yWXQmhFLQ0U4L5X8thGg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "Do you want a great pulled pork sandwich?

I have never left hungry and neither will you, they also sell meat and sides by the pound and quantity for your next tailgate or party.  Its no wonder that they have come running onto the Mobile restaurant scene and win Nappies as well as impress all those who dine here!  Meat Boss is simply the boss."}, {"review_id": "exeSn_aoaru9GFQjo2uSHw", "user_id": "NnYg5enyiFnwvnIeJqptzw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Great place with excellent friendly service.

I've kept hearing from my customers to check this place out. I ordered the beef brisket with sweet BBQ sauce that was sandwiched between sourdough bread. I did the lunch combo and opt in for two sides and a water so I chose the potato salad and conecuh sausage. I took my first bite and all I wanted to do was keep eating. The brisket was very tender and the BBQ sauce is very flavorful. One of the best BBQ sandwiches I've tasted in Mobile so far. Now I see what the buzz is about. Parking can be pretty challenging due to the popularity of this place during lunch time.

For the one (actually an adult) who does not like BBQ.Baby Back Ribs - we got a whole rack sliced. The ribs were very meaty and well-seasoned with a nice smoke ring but the meat was not very tender.  I guess they were not of the best quality. Also, the meat was a bit dry.Pulled Chicken - I was blown away by how flavorful this meat was. It was not dry but was well seasoned and very tender.  Everyone loved it.  It is particularly good with the thick and classic sweet and spicy sauce.  Others liked it with the white sauce, which is basically seasoned mayonnaise, but I thought that the white sauce was boring.Chopped Brisket - this was the best meat that we had. Super tender bits of brisket have bits of bark mixed in.  I particularly liked this with the spicy Carolina sauce, which had a similar but slightly tangy flavor than the sweet and spicy sauce. Mac and Cheese - shell pasta is tossed with a creamy white cheddar sauce.  I thought this was very good because it was so creamy, but some complained that the pasta pieces were too big and it did not have a very cheesy flavor.Asian Slaw - a vinegar-soy slaw with shredded green and red cabbage, grated carrots and ramen noodles. I really liked this slaw because it was sweet and tangy.Classic Slaw - a traditional mayonnaise based dressing with celery seed over shredded green cabbage and grated carrots. It was tasty but was really enhanced by adding a little Spicy Carolina Sauce to give it a little extra umph.We had a very good lunch and the staff was super friendly (e.g., they don't have plates for eating the meats in house, but they cut up some of their regular meal boxes to be pseudo plates for us).  Overall, it was not spectacular, because I have had much better BBQ in Los Angeles and you should not be required to eat sauce with the meat (it was necessary here because nothing was juicy without it)."}, {"review_id": "EFq7cP_74h9T3jy9860Zng", "user_id": "XXDgvskDimCG3u95nglKBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/13/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "If there was an eleventh commandment, it would be \"Thou shalt not put BBQ sauce on ribs.\"   I mean, who does that?  People who don't know how to smoke ribs, that's who.  Ribs are like steak; if they're properly cooked, you don't need sauce. Much to my (pleasant) surprise, when I asked the cashier if I could get our ribs dry, she told me that's the only way they come and you can get sauce on the side if you want.  Between that and the perfect smoke ring, this is the only place I've found in lower Alabama that does ribs any justice. These are low and slow, no doubt!  In addition to that half rack of ribs my hubs and I split, we each also got a BBQ sandwich. Of course I'm talking about pulled pork. I like mine with slaw on it, and believe it or not, I love the Alabama white BBQ sauce. The hubs just puts regular sauce on his.  I had the bread pudding and the hubs had mac and cheese and Conecuh as his sides. The sandwiches were pretty big and we enjoyed them and the sides. Our total order was only $34, which is super reasonable for everything we ordered. I love the new set-up of the place.  You now order in the same room where you eat, and they still have that cute little pet friendly porch out front with the picnic tables.  The restaurant is really cute and comfortable and there's a little tv in the dining area.  The restrooms are clean.  I still stand my my opinion that this is the best BBQ restaurant on the coast, and it only surpassed by the one and only Marcus H.  The dry rub isn't flavorful and they don't pull the membrane off the bottom of the ribs.  Other than that, they're perfect. If you're here from Memphis, trust me when I say this is the only BBQ joint that will actually hold up to your standards."}, {"review_id": "YJVzCxJtPYNQyGWYJkU7qw", "user_id": "kGBvpuwkfZqVt61CPw2_vg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "We've only been here for breakfast, but wow, is it good.
