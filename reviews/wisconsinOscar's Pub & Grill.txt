We were spending the afternoon in Milwaukee yesterday with no idea where to eat, but a burger seemed like it would hit the spot, so we made our way over to Oscar's. The parking lot was pretty full at 3:30, so that seemed like a good sign! We waited just a few minutes to be seated, it was hoppin'. First up, a Lakefront amber lager and some cheese nuggets, which were melty-hot and delicious. I believe I chose The Gringo burger, which had two cheese and bacon on it. It was a great burger! I was pleasantly surprised that the fries were sprinkled with a bit of Parmesan.  You got a lot of food for a reasonable price! Three of us had burgers, beers and the appetizer for about $40 before tip. Now about half way through our meal the power went out! We were grateful we already had our food, but it it didn't seem to slow down the kitchen staff. The staff and patrons were taking it in stride and everyone was still having a good time! Luckily we had enough cash to take care of our bill; I think our sweet waitress was thankful, since they were waiting for the Square to arrive for credit card payments.Thanks for a great first visit, Wisconsin, even if you were rainy, snowy and sleety!"}, {"review_id": "qu19HjmotJPo3MDBj7xiGg", "user_id": "lZxk8HakhbggIEg9RoLGjw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "One of the best burgers I have had in Milwaukee! I did go with the \"Big O\" per other reviews and what comes on it. The server did recommend me pairing my burger with a Louies Demise lager. My order came out accurate and pretty quick. The burger was a pretty big burger I felt for the price. The beef was cooked to perfection and tasted great. The plate also featured some hand cut French fries (seasoned with grated cheese), a pickle, and house made guacamole.

Many will swear by it.I've tried The Big O - Angus burger with chipotle jack cheese, smoked Gouda, bacon, chorizo, fried onions, jalapeno with guacamole on the side. That burger is a behemoth and AIN'T MESSIN' AROUND. I definitely had to cut it in half and it was the typical \"how-do-I-attack-this-thing-while-still-seemingly-remaining-ladylike.\" News flash - you can't. Just go for it.The Big Foot has a great cheese mixture - crumbled blue & boursin (which was different and interesting) and the Big Hongo is really good for anyone who likes a mushroom/Swiss-style burger. I've been hitting up this place after the Winter's Farmers Market at the Domes, since it's all of 5 mins away and usually opens at 11 which is when I'm leaving with all my Farmer's Market goodies anyways. Overall: Great prices and great beer list. I like my burger bun a little more toasted, but often I remove the top anyways because I don't want all the bread. The service has been a little shoddy at times, but Oscar's is honestly worth the visit and the burger."}, {"review_id": "TQjIu4sHMrizr3aBiEyIww", "user_id": "0hDy_Y29b_Np4CidP_aylQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/18/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "When it comes to the best burger joint in Milwaukee... for me it's Oscars.I've had some rough visits in the past with staff and customer service, but overall I can't deny how great this place is. When someone asks me the best burger, I can't deny the facts!What else I also really love is their Bloody Mary!!! Great flavor and excellent toppings. The bacon is perfectly baked. Love the fresh mozz ball. If you haven't had, try one! They have this fun beer chaser, too. It's like the question mark lollipop... who knows what you might get!I learned on my last visit that they are opening a new location! I'm happy for Oscar, my (limited) interactions with him have been nothing but positive!! I've planned an event there and he was so accommodating!Last time I went outside my box and tried The Big Aloha.

Topped with parmesan or a different seasoning...whatever it is...it's perfect! I've tried the Big Foot with 8 oz. Premium Black Angus Burger, Crumbled Blue & Boursin Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato & Onion.  I love this burger!  It's juicy, cooked to perfection and has just the right amount of cheese.  I've always tried the Big Hongo with 8 oz. Premium Black Angus Burger, Swiss Cheese, Sautéed Mushrooms.  I usually add tomato and lettuce to this one since I like a bit of crunch.  Both are equally delicious.  There is a full bar with a huge draft beer listing.  The drinks are priced just right as well.  At times, the service may seem slow, but in my experience, it's only because it can get jam-packed.  The servers have always done the best they can.  On a day or night when it's not completely packed, its great!

Bonus? They're a solid option for a Friday night fish fry as well. Oscar's serves pub grub in its most unpretentious, delicious, and occasionally messy (maybe it's just me...but those burgers can get a bit messy...not complaining, though. They're amazing). My favorite burger is The Big Foot (black angus burger topped with crumbled bleu and boursin). It's big, juicy, and decadently delicious. My main dining companions favorite is The Big O burger (black angus burger, chipotle jack, smoked gouda, bacon, chorizo, fried onions, jalapeños, and guac). He's a man of few words, but he can seriously wax poetic about that burger.They can get a bit busy and they don't take reservations, so there can sometimes be a bit of a wait (worth it). The service is always kind and completely spot on. If I lived nearby, this would be my go-to for an after work beer. As it is, it's still a frequent stop. On nice afternoon/evenings, they have a wonderful patio space in back to enjoy.Oh! And, totally kid friendly. We frequently bring the kiddo and he seriously digs the eats as well.

You can't beat Oscar's for their burgers and the value. They are consistently good. They listen when you share how you want it cooked and it is a great sized burger. I usually go with the Big Gringo Burger and it hasn't failed me yet.It should be noted, you don't go here for ambiance... it's a total bar feel and they usually have whatever sports games are on to watch.

How did I live in Milwaukee for 18 months and not come across your threshold of deliciousness??
