We hadn't planned dinner, so after having a few snacks on the boat, we decided to find something more romantic for dinner and found Leunig's! Since it was later (after 9) and during the week, the restaurant wasn't too packed and we got nice seating with a window. Because of this time, we were also able to order off the $20 Bistro menu, which comes with soup or salad, and a discounted wine. Service was great, food was delicious, and the ambiance was very romantic, but not too fancy."}, {"review_id": "xXQnJyzmrCFJTl7YKxkhKQ", "user_id": "uN1P_lDMj-0o6ndh4XKGfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "We just had a lovely Saturday evening at Leunig's upstairs bar.

Leunig's is slightly upscale French inspired food but you can still go with a hat and a hoodie. They have a small space upstairs, sometimes with just appetizers and sometimes the full menu. Good cocktails and small but good beer list.Make a reservation online. The duck frites are the best appetizer. The peanut butter pie is the best dessert."}, {"review_id": "4dB2rTl9aNYNqtba4mupJg", "user_id": "KORkYMXizDTeM9mM8eYZNw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "I was in town for a conference and we were starving when we came to Leunig's for lunch.

The side salad was also delicious and perfectly paired with the entree. Service was extremely pleasant and quick.

Located in the main section on Church Street, the bistro has both indoor and outdoor patio seating. The interior is decorated with colorful paneling dark woods and, large period paintings/photographs...although a bit drafty. and dark wood is reminiscent of another period.Service was prompt and knowledgeable about various items on the menu, which was helpful. I ordered the Salade Nicoise which has ahi, avocado ad  a light vinaigrette. Very good and surprisingly filling. The items seem a bit overpriced for lunch; for example $15 Mac and cheese and meatloaf specials. Would like to try the open faced sandwich came loaded with cheese, meat and a basil. The French onion soup was also very popular with a balance of cheese and broth."}, {"review_id": "gsoOaqtfz0FwhJpd43PH6g", "user_id": "2EYLhT0mlKiB-OHu20mYtg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "My son attends Vermont University and I often visit him, and I have grown a attachment to Vermont, especially Burlington.  Traveling from New York City, I always make sure to have breakfast with my son, Alex, at Leunig's.  Once inside the atmosphere and service makes the dining experience special....thank you Leunig's."}, {"review_id": "vax2Ke4a8S5jc-rIxmf8iA", "user_id": "FcBDHJQEJ_n0RV4hZsJu9A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "7/4/2017", "text": "I've never been to Europe but my bff has. She took me to Leunig's as soon as I landed in Burlington and told me it is very authentic. I'm a country bumpkin from KY so some of the authentic Euro touches were less impressive to me :) for instance, it was raining/muggy that day so I would have loved some AC; I like ice in my water; and I like soft, chewy bread - not tooth-breaking hard! But c'est la vie!We decided to skip the early bird, multi-course dinner specials and instead had soup, Prosecco and split hors d'oeuvre. My friend had gazpacho and I had French onion soup. My French onion was delicious but again it was muggy outside and the AC wasn't on indoors - I was a sweating mess and I got too hot to finish my soup. We split duck confit poutine, curried coconut mussels and pimiento lobster dip. My friend did the ordering, as I guess she was afraid (with good reason) that I would just order sliders and truffle fries.The poutine was very rich, greasy and quickly got unappetizingly soggy. I think I learned then and there that I don't like duck, and the textures just didn't work for me. Again, it was just soggy cheese fries with greasy meat to me. The mussels were our favorite part of the meal, the broth was delicious but begged for some SOFT bread to soak up the goodness, not that \"authentic\" impenetrable hard bread. We were too full from everything to barely touch the lobster dip, but had I known (or just had reading comprehension skills that day) that it was actually a cold cheese already mixed with lobster then I would have definitely passed. Again the hillbilly side of me was expecting a bubbling hot, loaded-with-lobster -chunks, cream cheesy dip and that cold, stiff spread was not tempting to me at all. Our total bill was about $100. My friend even seemed kind of crestfallen by the food and said she and her husband really only come for the atmosphere. Leunig's wasn't terrible and I didn't leave feeling angry or ripped off or anything but it definitely isn't making my top favorite travel sites and I wouldn't want to come back."}, {"review_id": "jEkfeqrf53J7QpHKF9pR2g", "user_id": "ZaTw1ebM8cbcWSQN6-ynew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/6/2017", "text": "Wowzers! What an awesome ending to a great trip! This was the \"last supper\" of the girls trip I was on and I had had some seafood, but hadn't been blown away until this meal! Boy, did we really save the best for last!We started with some delicious, light Pinot Grigio. It was fresh, crispy and exactly what we were craving! They had a nice wine list and other great options outside the wine scene as well. After ordering they do bring you some bread to nibble on while you wait for your food. Nothing out of this world, just some plain extra bread action with a side of butter.My mom and I decided that we weren't in \"starving\" mode so we would split an appetizer and main dish. I picked the spinach and artichoke dip with crustinis to start out the meal. There were lots of other appeasing appetizers, but for some reason I just wanted some of my go-to \"comfort food.\" Honestly I was just expecting the premade-generic-warmed up spinach dip that most restaurants serve, but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived at the table. You could tell it was homemade! An entire artichoke (or two) was perfectly pulled apart, cooked and mixed with spinach, cheese and other ingredients to make the most spectacular spinach and artichoke dip I've ever had in my life! I'm still drooling over it days later!! So obviously that's a MUST on the menu to start your meal out. For our main course my mom picked the Pineapple Glazed Scallops.... and yes they were as good as they sound! Fresh scallops in a glaze of pineapple, coconut & rum, accompanied by a bed of sautéed spinach and cinnamon spiced plantain patties! Absolutely Delectable!! I don't even know what else to say about it, as it was just absolutely phenomenal!Friends we were with got the oyster appetizer that was a sample of oysters... raw oysters, oysters Rockefeller and fried oysters. For the main course they got the steak and fries. They enjoyed it, but I don't think it was their favorite meal of the trip... guess they just ordered the wrong thing at the wrong time because I'm still drooling over everything I ate!!I'm not sure what the atmosphere was on the inside, as we were seated out on the patio. The inside was much larger than it looks at first glance. Dim and intimate. The patio was large and roomie and even had a little stage area for live music. There were sets, so the music was only going part of the time we were there. It was lovely music, but it could have been a little softer. At times it was hard to carry on conversation because it was so loud and we were on the other side of the patio. All in all, I think it added to and made for a nice ambiance!They do take reservations, but walk ups as well. If you don't have reservations though, be prepared to wait!! It'll be worth it though, I promise!"}, {"review_id": "DdCYSNvxbiOfJBNq2u7NKQ", "user_id": "AKZwYugxzvNJd_c9uirJ6w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Leunig's is a lovely restaurant that combines exquisitely prepared food with an ambiance that strongly evokes a Parisian cafe.  We started with the onion soup gratinee before our entrees of beef bourguignon and pork flat iron roulade.  Everything was delicious but we were ill-prepared for how filling the meals would be and took much of our meals home (I could have stopped after the onion soup!).  Our server was also fantastic with the right combination of formality and personality to complete the illusion of being in Paris.  You will pay a bit more for the experience but for a treat, it's worth it!"}, {"review_id": "SqfvDURGq-ss8nZomKjE7Q", "user_id": "36csViAqVU_CDkFNN3ySOw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "What a great little bistro!

They offered a 3 course dinner for $40 per person. As for the Restaurant Week menu, here's is what we ordered:APPETIZERFoie Gras Terrine - Rich, flavorful, and the pickled vegetables balanced out the richness of the terrine. This dish was good, however it lacked imagination. Foie Gras \"Mille Feuile\" - Ick...weird flavor combo with the peanut butter and white chocolate...not my favoriteENTRÉEBeef Wellington - Tenderloin was slightly overcooked, I would have preferred it to be more medium rare. Also, they didn't sear the meat before putting it in the puff pastry so the meat looked gray. Mashed potatoes and asparagus were nicely cooked.Duck Cassoulet Pasta - I liked that the pasta was hand-made. However, the pasta was slightly under cooked, clumped together, and the confit duck leg was slightly dry. This dish had a lot of protein in it (duck confit and foie gras bratwurst) which made this a very heavy dish.DESSERTMaple Crème Brûlée - Good maple flavor but too sweetPoached Pear Clafoutis - I enjoyed the pears, they were not overly sweet.We also ordered off their regular menu and got the Duck Confit Poutine, which is the only dish  I'd recommend. This dish was tasty and I might come back just to eat this dish.Our overall experience was fairly mediocre. Food was only okay, overpriced, and presentation was dated. Service was meh.....our server disappeared and didn't check on us until it was almost time to ask for the check."}, {"review_id": "8cIztDU_uLs5s4Xg6PXa2A", "user_id": "rfi46REh-vNi-GmzNIHmxQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/19/2017", "text": "Maybe one of the best french bistros I've ever been and have eaten at.
