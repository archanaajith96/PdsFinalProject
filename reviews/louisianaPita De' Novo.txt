I've been here twice and the quality of food and service is excellent! It's always busy here so if you're in a rush you should order ahead. You order as soon as you enter then wait for your food to be freshly made.I get the chicken shwarma salad and it's the best! Very flavorful with lettuce, onions, olives, feta cheese and tomatoes. Hint: if you order in a to go box, you get a bigger portion! The babaganoush is really scrumptious. Smoky eggplant flavor that pairs well with chicken shwarma let simple pita. Yummmm.This restaurant is family friendly and I've seen groups from 2 to 10 inside so it is very accommodating!"}, {"review_id": "oi4QLIAQrS8N2Bv_n3yFJA", "user_id": "V_A7kcx3St3WQmfWT8kFTg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Love this place!

Pita de Novo seemed to have a fast food vibe similar to the likes of Chipotle. Go in, head to the counter where you see how they make food, order then pay. I had a beef gyro sandwich. I was really underwhelmed with the taste. I was expecting a lot due to the rave. My gyro did not have a good protein to bread ratio. The meat did not pack on Mediterranean spices, and a bit on the greasy side. The bread was warm and tasted not too sweet. I also had babba ganoush, which tasted pretty good and had the right amount of garlic and tartness of the lemon. Not sure if I'll be a regular!"}, {"review_id": "QDCVJnNj-AnPpHSLYay6zg", "user_id": "6f1NI_GoOCK5KkXF5U2JMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "This is not only my favorite Greek restaurant in the area but also one of my favorite restaurants period.  I generally order pick up, and it's ready in five minutes.  The chicken shawarma is always spot on.  I highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "W5FTVFTHeyR3VRVxnvPlYQ", "user_id": "UyEAiZX98HtHeMplF9NgyQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "A small place.

Whether dining in or carrying out, the food is fresh and the service is friendly. I never have to wait too long to feast on the yummy food here. Prices are affordable and the portions are generous too!All thanks to my lovely Yelp bff, Picha's recommendation, my most favorite thing to get is the chicken shawarma plate (~ $10), which comes with your choice of 2 sides and warm pita bread (I always end up ordering extra pita bread). I prefer the chicken as opposed to the lamb or beef because it is more flavorful and moist. For sides, I prefer the hummus, Grecian dip and tahini salad as well. I don't know what it is about that addictive Grecian dip, but I can eat it with everything! The Greek salad is HUGE and is a nice change if you're looking for lighter food fare. Btw, the Greek salad is extra tasty and delicious with Grecian dip! With all the dining options along Youree, you should try Pita de Novo the next time you're unsure of what or where to eat. You'll become a fan like me and keep coming back. They should rename themselves Pita de OH WOW!!!"}, {"review_id": "i7MuATBDhPmI5zsasZIwXg", "user_id": "eIu6Dax_mxOQKXo147ClnQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/26/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I love this place.. very great food and service.

If you haven't yet tried them, do yourself a huge favor and go. You will want to take a couple extra meals with you to enjoy later. Their serving portions are generous and their prices are very reasonable, especially for the high quality of the food they serve.I think I've tried everything on their menu now and everything is delicious. The only negative I can possibly say about them is that I find the beef shwarma to have a bit of gristle texture to it. At most places I consider the chicken shwarma to be dry. No so here, moist, rich in flavor, and sooo good. I've never cared for the grape leaf veggie wraps anywhere else but they even make them delicious. I could eat my weight in the gyro meat and fried eggplant if only they would allow me free rein behind the counter. They don't have a huge menu selection but they have enough to keep you satisfied and it allows them the ability to serve their selections with absolute perfection. I wouldn't change a thing!The pretty young lady who takes the orders as well as assists with plating the orders is like a bright ray of sunshine. She's always super upbeat and friendly and is very eager to help describe or explain any menu items. She is great at remembering return customers too. We appreciate and love you Sara! The cook is also very nice."}, {"review_id": "_AQ8RVvRwtqdXHgr00_USA", "user_id": "XGBLpKPpYyzMi3AewM4hmA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/20/2015", "text": "When I have a bad mood or when I have a good mood --- I go Pita De Novo.
