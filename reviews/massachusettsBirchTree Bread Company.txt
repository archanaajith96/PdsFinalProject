This is the place for you....looking for a place to catch up with friends for an hour? This is the place for you. Birch Tree Bread Company is such an awesome location to enjoy a sandwich, cup or coffee or a pint of a Worcester brew. I'm in Worcester about three days a week for work and their delicious breakfast sandwich and jolting iced coffee has established them as my operations base in Worcester. Best menu bites are the breakfast sandwich and country toast, though I doubt you can go wrong with any of the other options. Most yelp reviews I read seem to agree with this. Some people complain about the wait in their reviews and I'll admit it can get busy and a bit slow, but if you are planning on spending half an hour or longer, it is a great spot. Their wifi is really good too, a lot of places see a dip in speed when many users are on the network but Birch Tree's wifi seems to always allow me to get my work done."}, {"review_id": "OLSGYxZpXOjLubSMX0Arvg", "user_id": "eg2AWasmuu7ZhpZfRVom2w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Visiting BirchTree is an experience that everyone should try at least once. They are located in an awesome older building that has been renovated and are surrounded by other great Green Street eateries. Stepping inside BirchTree is like walking into a farmhouse store. There are many options for seating, whether it be at the bar (they serve alcohol!), at a booth or table, or on couches. I recommend giving yourself some time the first time you try BirchTree. They are often very busy and the food takes some time to come out. If it is coffee/tea you are looking for, they have a Grab and Go line that is often faster than the regular line. The food here is phenomenal. My favorite is the Country Bread toast. The jam and butter combination is so sweet and delicious. I have never had it, but everyone I know raves about the breakfast sandwich as well."}, {"review_id": "bagDWSbVlY7qdhkDxgwk9w", "user_id": "8Zzqjxgiwv-ipUcv2uR1Vg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "BirchTree is probably one of the coolest places to visit. You'll have to try Brittany's toast! It changes often but I'm sure whatever it is, it'll be delicious. Any of their toast really. My favorite tea is the lavender London fog with almond milk. I like it iced but it seems to be served hot in the colder months so I can't get it iced still for some reason. It's super busy on the weekends and not enough tables for everyone so I don't recommend coming here if you have a big party and don't like a lot of noise."}, {"review_id": "KY9BhW17k_gJmfLJVB6FGQ", "user_id": "Lb-VF6PEU9p3rZqGOVFMKQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Delicious!!!!

I didn't expect this place to be as good as it was. Food, presentation and ambiance are all top notch here. In addition the staff were very friendly.

First of all you have to love the old mill feeling in the building...brick walls old wood flooring and exposed pipes. A nice industrial feel.We ordered our breakfast sandwiches and coffees (really wanted to try the almond croissants because that is one of my favorite things, but they weren't ready yet), we found a nice booth in front of the windows and near the 'stage' where 2 gentlemen played some nice music (including Christmas carols). We had a delicious breakfast sandwich with our coffees while we watched the snow falling outside and listening to the music (pretty perfect). My partner went back to see if the almond croissants were ready and came back with one to share. As I said almond croissants are my favorite and these did not disappoint!!! Definitely made it to the top of my list along with my other favorite place (except the other place takes hours to get to)!!!Next time we'll try one of their pizza nights!!!"}, {"review_id": "9HBztEeaIT07a8aOLbsWGQ", "user_id": "HNjv4ujDiRTlEfMEoImSrQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "If you're looking for sandwiches, salads or a carb filled meal this is your place. The food is always tasty and the atmosphere is always active. They often have live music which is enjoyable. But if you go during rush hour the wait in line to order can be long and seating can take a while to obtain.

And more bread. BirchTree has a emphasis on delicious, different breads...focaccia, breads stuffed with olives, challah, sourdough. And they're GOOD at it. I ordered the herb and olive toast, which was slathered with whipped feta and olive oil. It was luxurious and inexpensive. It paired perfectly with a vegetable soup (which was also served with bread). It was heart warming. There is a ton of space to spread out and work on your laptop, or read a book, or talk to a friend. It's also located in an old mill building with shops to pop into.

Environment/Staff: I find it difficult to order drinks/coffee because I can never find their menu flavors anywhere. I'll ask the staff what kind of flavors they have for lattes/coffee...and they say \"basically everything\" and maybe list 1-3. That's nice and all, but I like physically see what they have to offer instead of picking one at the top of my head. I've also asked for flavors that they don't have, so hmmm. Anyways, the staff are pretty pleasant and try to be fast/efficient. The environment is rustic and chill (a place where people go to so hw or have casual meetings).Coffee/Drinks: I usually get some sort of latte (chai ). Honestly, one of the best flavors/consistency. Can't be denied.Turkey Bacon Sandwich: The first time I ate this, it tasted like heaven, especially with the jam they put inside. The only complaint I had would be how hard the crust was. It hurt my jaw...it was so hard. But other than that, flavor and ingredients were basically perfect. I love the side of apples it came with. The second time I ordered it, it didn't taste as good for some reason. It also didn't come with the apple slices this time, it came with something else."}, {"review_id": "yYdHWzPZlkqI0NUpQ_HhyQ", "user_id": "bsMGQruRQGgQZK4KA9Q4Aw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/15/2017", "text": "I ended up at BirchTree not once, but TWICE during my 24 hour stint in Worcester! The first day, I popped in for lunch. They offer a variety of sandwiches, salads, toasts, and daily specials including a sweet and savory bread pudding, quiche, soups and more! I was feeling healthy-ish so ordered the roasted corn and black bean salad special and a cookie (I did say healthy-ISH). After all, I couldn't resist how good they looked! While it was hard to not go for the peanut butter chocolate chip, the toasted walnut and fig sounded too unique to pass up. It was delicious! The salad was good as well. Tasted very fresh and pretty filling. Now, the next morning is when things got interesting... I was starving so went for the breakfast sandwich: ham, sharp cheddar, a fried egg and, the best part, it was all on a bacon fat brioche bun! That's right: BACON FAT BRIOCHE BUN. I really appreciated hot sauces being at the ready which I doused on top. True story: this was one of my favorite breakfast sandwiches ever. It was super filling and oh so worth it. To sip, I tried coffee in the morning and iced tea for the afternoon. They offered four varieties of iced teas which came in hearty portions. I opted for green tea and it was perfecto. I was surprised to see they have an impressive selection of craft beer, as well as some wine. The space is very big so perfect to meet with friends, do some work, and more. Thursday morning while I was there, there was a children's music performer that made for quite the crowd. I would give it four stars but each day, I didn't find the staff to be too friendly or helpful since I was new to the space. They're definitely busy so I understand, but a little friendliness can go a long way.Pro Tip: There's a parking lot around back (off of Harding) that's free but can fill up! No matter where you park, you have to enter through the Crompton Collective and find your way to BirchTree."}, {"review_id": "oJlMZYR0dhrkCXmYcaCdtQ", "user_id": "2D5XncIn9E-SdgUFkk3_Og", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Starting off, the bread samples at the counter were amazing.
