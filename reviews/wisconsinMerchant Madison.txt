I had friends from out of town with me. They had originally requested DLUX for the bottomless mimosas, but when we asked for a table they said it was a TWO HOUR WAIT. Nope.  We walked down to Merchant and were seated immediately! I am SO GLAD we came here instead. I hadn't been to Merchant for brunch yet, but I have a feeling I will be back sooner than later! Our server was great! He was friendly and personable. I ordered the Eggs Benny for my meal. It was delicious. The Hollandaise sauce was honestly some of the best Hollandaise I think I have ever had. Really great flavor and it was the perfect texture. Creamy and light in color. So good. The ham was really good as well. The meal came with mixed greens which provided a nice light and fresh flavor that paired well with the richness of the Eggs Benny. Others at the table tried the breakfast burrito and the 2 eggs breakfast. Everyone in the group seemed to really enjoy their meals. 10/10 recommend!"}, {"review_id": "HGbsK6KuxOPB5vL5OL9_gQ", "user_id": "Bz_BFTwA6h4KgrRvK3c84g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/26/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Very dark. And kind of close awkward seating. Which is less of an issue than the price and quality. With the exception of the cocktails which are amazing and only moderately overpriced... everything else is pretty meh. If the food was 20-40% less this would be an easy 4 Star place. But it's not. 21$ for corned beef and cabbage on St Pats day better be amazing. It was not. It was about 2\" thick and very tough. Perhaps that's \"authentic\" but I was expecting something much different. Like the other 20 dishes of corned beef and cabbage I've had in my life... And one of my biggest pet peeves - one person brought water, one person took our order, a different 3rd person brought the food over, a forth person took my card and brought a box... soooo, who exactly am I tipping? And for what?! Certainly not the engaging discussion or personality. To top it off, the hostess mentioned we were still in on happy hour. Which equates to 2$ off a drink or 8$ for our stay. Hardly complaint worthy, but didn't get it, and by that time we just wanted to leave. So my 8$ worth of advice? Maybe try some of the nearly infinite other dining options Madison has to offer. Or maybe sit at the not-as-awkward bar and have a cocktail. Which range from 9-13$ ish for the most part. Unless of course you manage to find someone that knows it's Happy Hour. But again, 2$ X 4 isn't what let me down... it's the food and the service, and the incredibly awkward seating. Parting thought: when squeezing my average 6' 200lb mass out of a space that hardly accepts my 36\" waist, do I drag my \"front\" or my \"rear\" across the top of the table next to ours? Well I guess, I we interacted with our dining partners considerably more than the staff, perhaps that makes us close enough for a \"front\" side table drag... Update: so it's nice the management cares enough to comment on these reviews. But that can't change my previous experience, or anyone else's. And I'd be a fool to ask for a dish to be replaced in this or any other restaurant. There is no way that can end good in any way, for anyone. \"Sorry dining friends of the evening, our stay will be extended however long it takes to get my second dish that I sure hope doesn't have 'extra' things in it. No no, please continue eating while I sit here awkwardly waiting.\" The better thing to do would be assess the seating situation. Sit at your tables and wonder if people would feel comfortable dining there. Compare your prices to what is offered very near your business. I don't need special treatment. I want what you offer to be something I want to go to, that everyone wants to go to because it's awesome. Not a dark, expensive, mishmash of tables where the servers are as elusive as the comfort. That just can't work and I'll never be able to recommend it. The four cocktails that weren't priced right, were the main attraction and that's really it. No amount of talking about it will change that. So that's what it is. A review of an experience that was less than optimal. You only get one shot at a first impression and what not."}, {"review_id": "6S43J5qmiBwyUlPidakSgA", "user_id": "T5cMFPe0oGMhoSatXzb7gw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "First time here, and it was just okay...I was disappointed they only had the brunch menu available and it was almost mid afternoon, so I wasn't looking for what I ended up ordering.I had the breakfast burrito, and it was okay.  It was more cheddar queso flavor and lacked the spiciness I hopped for.  Service was decent overall.  With that said, I'll consider trying here again at some point."}, {"review_id": "mD1O4pLqH-dbte6hAuzo3w", "user_id": "NZUosyHUyOHOFJRbPdLYng", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "The food itself was good enough (mussels, scallops, tenderloin), but not for the price. And while I was totally digging the music, it's way too loud for a 5:00 dinner crowd on Saturday. We could barely have a conversation without screaming across the table. Everything took foooreeeeevvvver. Even drinks at 5:00 when there was nearly no one else in the joint, took entirely too long. Our whole dinner experience took 2 1/2 hours, and we rushed her at the end for the bill because we had to be somewhere else. Insane.They like to conveniently leave ingredients off the menu. We ordered a charcuterie board which came with almonds. Not a big deal unless you're allergic. Never mentioned on the menu. Mussels state they are in a white wine sauce. Once it came out, it's a very obvious cream/dairy based sauce, which if known, would've influenced the choice.I'm not sure what all the hype is about. This was our first, and last time here."}, {"review_id": "pXFUuMDMY4Ltv8EKaI8xHA", "user_id": "hx4_GngWpI4n5_wQx7tmfA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "Heard all kinds of goodness about this place for cocktails and drinks for happy hour so I simply had to go check this place out.....as if I needed a reason to check out the capitol square!Glad I did (even if it was solo.....again) I had a good time checking this place out. Rustic tavern feel, busting socialization going on at the bar. 830pm on a Thursday night and cold as hell out....did not keep the Madisonians from getting a good drink on!I got a whiskey sour ($10) and ordered up the chicken breast entree($26). My pics are not the best as the place is dimly lit for lighting but I actually liked that. Candles at your table set the scene well. Live music was going on during my stay as well, bit loud for the size of the place IMO but still good vibes.My drink came out quick and I loved it. Not a whiskey guy really but they made it work well here.My entree was awesome. A super tasty sage risotto with butternut squash base with maybe the most tender piece of apple cider glazed chicken breast I have ever had. Topped with cherry-apple chutney to make for the perfect balance of sweet and tartness. Portions are on the small side IMO but the quality is lacking nothing. You pay a premium for the exclusively locally sourced farm-to-table aspect of this venue. Service is pretty quick, accurate and tentative. Great place for drinks as everyone says but also a good place for sub grub if paying a little more is OK with you."}, {"review_id": "aRmAHAUrpjtL9h1qUooZyA", "user_id": "qp-z1copnYQq7NPubYlNLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "Came to Merchant Madison for a birthday dinner and it did not disappoint. The atmosphere in the restaurant is super intimate and romantic at night. Our waitress was incredibly attentive and also oh-so-nice. I hate that I can't remember her name, but she really made our dining experience perfect.First of all, the Ploughman's Charcuterie Board is hands-down the best I have ever encountered. The selection is so well curated and every item is delicious individually or together. For the entree, I ordered the moules frites and my companion got the tagliatelle, which were also fantastic. We ordered the chocolate cherry mousse for dessert, and it is amazing. Towards the end of the night, they dimmed the lights and started playing 90s hip hop.Honestly, everything was perfect.

The inside decor is dark but very inviting. The wall behind the hostess table is flanked with bottles of wine and the bar sits along the back wall. All of the food is locally sourced and has a new American cuisine vibe - rustic with a lot of flavor. Having been here a number of times, I thought I'd share some of my favorite items. If you're in the mood for an appetizer, the cheese curds are really good. They are lightly breaded and seasoned perfectly. The steak frites are also good. Since their menu changes frequently, I'll usually order the special being offered or go with the tried and true roast chicken or a fresh ground burger. They have a great happy hour, which is the perfect time to get a drink and a bite without the rush of the dinner crowd."}, {"review_id": "JRJkC9emKk2w1zBwslY0nQ", "user_id": "ZuVIbvRKwpL0d2DIHVAs3w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/26/2017", "text": "Merchant was hands down a solid choice for brunch in Madison. We were in Wisconsin's capital for a wedding the night before and wanted to hit up brunch with the crew that morning. As busy as brunch can be pretty much anywhere we landed a table for 10 easily. The place was semi-dead when we arrived as we came around 9:30 am. Merchant picked right up though and left me feeling very happy we landed the table we had. What I have to appreciate about this place was the service. We had a waiter and he was very attentive and informative. Whether it be about food options or the drinks on the menu, he was solid. He was so solid at cash out he even told us about the automatic 20% gratuity added to our bill. That to me is solid as it gets. The food well it was good. I enjoyed a salmon cake benedict and it was every bite of scrumptious. My wife had eggs, toast and sausage. A basic breakfast and really nothing to complain about. Our drinks were great. Really tasty coffee, a solid Bloody Mary and even some killer dark stout brews. I'm not sure if Merchant would be my go to spot for brunch but it sure hit the spot that day. I would try them for an afternoon lunch or dinner any day though. That bar was solid and I enjoyed the beers in particular. There is a reason Merchant has four solid stars and it shows! Good job!

We had a reservation and were seated right away on a Sunday evening. When we first arrived, our server was very attentive and made sure that we had the drinks that we wanted. I ordered the bartender's choice and was given a bourbon drink. I am not a huge bourbon drinker but it was pretty delicious (and strong). The drink menu itself was very cool because all of the different drinks listed had a sort-of story behind them. This was fun to read at the table and look at all of the different names. We did not order any appetizers but I got some mixed greens with blue cheese to start. This was delicious but hard to screw up. It is easy to tell that all of their ingredients are farm fresh. I ordered the teriyaki salmon which came with rice and broccolini. I am a huge fan of all of these things but Merchant Mason just did not deliver. The broccolini was overcooked, burnt in some places. The salmon was very very dry, it would not even flake off. The rice was good but nothing outstanding. The saving grace of this dish was the butternut squash puree that was served with it. My cousin ordered a dumpling soup which had an Asian twist. It was delicious and I had major food envy. My mom ordered a burger which, in her opinion, was meh. My cousin and aunt ordered the quinoa bowl (our server said this was very popular) but they said it was way too salty. The restaurant itself is very cool. They have a little alcohol shop so you can purchase what was in your drink which I thought was a nice touch. The atmosphere is very trendy and I loved the space. The reason that it is only getting 3 stars is because of the food. For the price, the food did not meet our standards. Really cool restaurant and if I lived closer, I would give it another try."}, {"review_id": "pa114a-a8WzgdS02cOy1ZA", "user_id": "WeHffRGwXVuqdQyOxsAg0Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/21/2017", "text": "The food here is spot on. I'd always thought of this place as the spot you go to at the end of the night to dance your buzz off, but after going on a whim for Restaurant Week, I now know the truth: This place serves great effing food.Tuesdays are my favorite day to come. It's \"Date Night,\" and for $40 you and a plus-one can enjoy two featured entrees, a bottle of wine, and dessert. You can't beat that deal with a stick. The fun part (unless you hate surprises) is the fact that the featured entree and dessert are the chefs' choice. They're trying out new dishes that haven't made it to the menu yet.Make no mistake -- this is no fly-by-night operation, and these dishes are damn good. Last time I went, we split an appetizer (elotes: Mexican street corn. Holy chit.) and enjoyed some pork belly entrees followed by Dark Chocolate and Cherry Custard. We were both VERY happy campers. And I scored major points with my hot date for the suggestion (it must've clinched the deal cuz we're still dating lol).Another standout thing about this place? The liquor menu. It is, quite literally, a book. I'm not a huge wine person, so I opted for the mystery drink option. Choose your spirit (I chose Irish whiskey), and for the base price of the spirit chosen +$4, the bartender will mix you up something lovely. Mine came back in a lovely tumbler-ful melding with Chartreuse, orange oil and some other citrusy/herbal bitters. It was heavenly.The wait staff are SUPER awesome. They're friendly, patient when explaining the meal, how stuff works, etc, and they're also the perfect balance of not-hovering-but-right-there-when-you-need-something. Kudos to the crew!And let's not forget the dinner and dessert chefs -- I dunno who they are, but I wanna shake their hands -- they do a beautiful job.A couple practical bits:1. Bathroom: clean one-holers that are out-of-the-way and private.2. Parking: park in the garage across the street (next to the Great Dane).

The weather was perfect so we sat in their outside section. We were the only people with a pup there, but the staff was accommodating - they brought her a bowl of water and checked in on us (her), so I assume they're used to it.We ordered a couple of drinks to start - a rose for me, and my boyfriend had their bloody Mary. It was honestly one of the better bloody Marys I've had, even in a state that's well known for their over-the-top bloodys. They didn't go overboard with the garnishes, but there was a perfect balance of booze and spice and it wasn't too heavy. I would absolutely order that the next time we're in for brunch.For brunch, I had their french toast. It was absolutely enormous, covered in ricotta and berries and was delightful. I wish it came with some sort of a side to break up all the carbs, but man was it good. I'm not one to take pictures of my food, but I couldn't resist with this one.Merchant is pricey for Wisconsin, but right in line with more upscale dining in Madison. We each had a drink and an entree and got out of there for about $60 including tip.
