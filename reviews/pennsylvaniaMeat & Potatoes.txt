Not many places were open for dinner and after walking aimlessly around downtown Pittsburgh for an hour we literally stumbled upon this place. We walked in scanned the menu quickly and were seated right after. The drink options/specials were reasonably priced at $7 to $9 and the ambiance was great. All the hostess and waiters seemed welcoming. The food. The food. The food. Unfortunately, the menu item I ordered isn't listed on M&P's website. It doesn't seem like they've updated since 2017 but I can say that my dish was I believe a lamb chop with either quinoa or couscous. There were a variety of vegetables and sauces and the flavors were SO GOOD. The flavor I cannot speak enough about. I really did savor every bite. My brother ordered the pappardelle and said although the pasta was a little bit more on the dente side of al dente, it was still very delicious. This is for sure a place I'd return to for another speical occassion."}, {"review_id": "ytS0eKxEtn6cbPpUGHNH5g", "user_id": "txu_KwZOGYG6O3yYHjztbg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Meat & Potatoes was definitely the best meal I had while visiting Pittsburgh! Loved the ambiance of the restaurant, definitely a great place to go for date night or to celebrate a special occasion.Cocktails (4/5): We all enjoyed our drinks and the prices weren't too bad either.Caesar Salad (5/5): highly recommend ordering, it was amazing! The crunchy pork rinds and crispy pig ears complimented the salad perfectly and the addition of the egg was also unique.Roasted Duck Breast (4/5): really enjoyed the duck, it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. However, I don't eat polenta so I asked to sub a side potato dish instead which the server said I could, but did not inform me that there would be an additional $4 charge for this. Would have been nice to know.45 oz Ribeye for Two (3.5/5): the first ribeye they brought out was rare so we had to send it back. I found it odd that the bone marrow wasn't served with any toast or bread because it was really oily eating it by itself. Chimichurri and horse radish sauces were decent. Truffle Fries (5/5): great fries, loved the aioli.Overall a great spot for dinner downtown. Will be back the next time I come to Pittsburgh."}, {"review_id": "BP0VbftJ_SywcJYd2ySe4A", "user_id": "GwvH_Al6kqVmX8_gB607TQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I thought this was a fine place--the room is lovely, the food is well presented, there is a lot of energy while still not so noisy you can't have a good conversation, solid professional service.One of my girls picked out Meat and Potatoes when I was visiting, and this was a great choice.  Six of us had a great table, round and good for conversation, in a corner of the room with a nice view of the restaurant; the bar looked like a nice place to sit for a casual meal.  The duck breast was outstanding and looked nice on the plate, others had the chicken and the meatloaf and a couple other things and everyone was very happy.(One odd note that has now recurred in Pittsburgh; it seems like every time we ask a waiter 'we have a vegetarian dining tonight, any suggestions for how to work around the menu?', the first thing our waitress asked back is, 'so do you eat fish?'  This is the second time this happened!  I mean, it's no big deal, but still odd.  I'd understand eggs or cheese, people want to clarify between vegetarian and vegan and that's not clear, but a fish is not a vegetable!)."}, {"review_id": "OnC86tlsd3tH1dYhQCkbBQ", "user_id": "mH5frU-FkhEkQ1ITa_fm5Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "I've had 2 great experiences here.

I came here with colleagues while I was in town for a convention. The service was spot on and the food was DELICIOUS!! I highly recommend eating at Meat &Potatoes if you visit or live in Pittsburgh.What we had* Meatloaf - Slap your Grandmom twice if she tries to get a taste. This dish was amazing! 5 stars* Pork Chop - Huge! Definitely will have leftovers. The pork chop was juicy and tender. 5 stars* Three Little Pigs Sandwich - When we saw the size of this sandwich we were like WHOA! The sandwich was big enough for 2 people to eat. And the fact that it had bacon, Pork Milanese and ham made the sandwich that much more amazing! 5 stars* French Toast Dessert- This was a let down!

I gave it 4 stars because of the service. It was mediocre, nothing special. We sat down at 7:30 and had our meals by 7:42. I couldn't believe it was so fast. I must say the bartender was awesome...a true mixologist! Bar service was better than what we had at the table. We had the fried Brussels for an appetizer. They were delicious and the perfect size. I got the pappardelle pasta with bolognese sauce which I enjoyed. The pork was amazing and very tender. A huge portion too for $18, you can't beat that. My boyfriend had the flat iron. He loved it!

However they have way more than just Meat & Potatoes. But if you do opt for any of their food involving meat & potatoes, you are in for a treat! On a snowy weekday night it was full but not busy around 9:00pm. I was able to seat immediately at the bar area which I'm sure I took the last available one. This place is not very large, nor is it good for big parties. 2-4 will probably be as big as this place can accommodate for the most part.The bartender recommended the Wagyu Flat Iron which I got. Both the steak and potatoes were not dry and cooked to my liking. I also got the Root to Berry. It is a pretty fruity cocktail which is what I was craving as I waited for my food.

Our bloody mary's were just...alright.  Our service was...meh.I love the atmosphere of Meat and Potatoes. It is not a huge space but they do utilize it well and make the most out of it with the seating. I definitely recommend a reservation no matter what you're coming here for, otherwise there will be a wait.  It is bright and they had a DJ spinning real vinyls which was cool. It was very relaxed and vibe-y and their menu, though limited to brunch, is extensive in the sense that you can order breakfast or more lunch-type of items.We started with the truffle fries and bloody marys. I got the bacon infused vodka for mine and my date had the horseradish vodka.  We braved the crowd to go to the bar to do the add-ins.  Mine was okay - not the best and not the worst.  The truffle fries were to die for.  I ordered the huevos rancheros for my meal and my date had the brisket hash.  The food came out piping hot and the flavor was really good.  The huevos rancheros were insanely spicy. Too intense for me almost. Our waiter was not really  engaging us at all. He showed up when he had to, took our orders and brought out the food. It wasn't bad service, but it wasn't that good either. Which is disappointing, because M&P is a really nice place and the end bill reflects the atmosphere and the quality of food, so I wish the overall service/experience matched.  Regardless, I'd come here again because their menu is interesting and you know you're going to eat a satisfying meal."}, {"review_id": "nT0jtwNAiOSIpLyazvLzDw", "user_id": "r4Yy6gPRABrNLb9QrEfcnw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "We started off with me trying to book this online and my bf calling in and trying to book it.

We order the giant steak everyone is getting, along with Brussels sprouts, fries, and pate. The pate is pretty delicious. The fries are good too, the bone marrow should have been toasted more and the large steak has a ton of fat and is burnt... We also never get the Brussels sprouts. That's fine, we ate a lot and got full. We ask for the check. The Brussels sprouts that we never got to us are on there. Uh, ok so you're not going to give them to us but charge us for them?

The restaurant is little hard to find and do whatever in your power to find it and your pallet will thank you. I showed up for dinner on Monday night around 7 pm and the place was packed. Grab a seat at the bar and grabbed few beers from the happy hour menu. Both beers very very interesting and I must admit I chose them based on their name (porkslap pale ale and raging bitch Belgium ale). The bartender working that night was very knowledgeable about the bar and food menu and helped me made my dinner selection. Potato gnocchi with dirty duck ragu is what I have chosen and I couldn't been happier. The plate came out perfect, gnocchi were mixed with duck and braised in the most delicious and flavorful juices. The center of the plate was dressed with a soft boiled egg made perfectly. I  have enjoyed every single bite and if it was socially acceptable I would lick the plate. Overall I always have great meals when I am in Pittsburgh but this one stood a mile above the rest including the bartender man who shows up with the most positive attitude."}, {"review_id": "B1jJXIjXu6maLC6O9CZQzg", "user_id": "SfkCNaq_JLYkutheYo_sIg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "ERMAHGAWD. Really, thats all I can say. This place was UNBELIEVABLE. To this day, I continue to say this is the best meal I have EVER had. I LOVE the atmosphere, is it upscale? Yes, is it a bar? Yes! Thats the best part, I would feel comfortable in jeans and a polo, just as much as I would in a full suit. No one here is discriminated from this dress code. The beer selection was great, but know whats even better is their drink selection. You know you've found a good place when you ask the bartender what you should get, and he asks what you're feeling. At that point you let him do his magic, and you sit back and relax. Is it a little pricier? Of course, but did I mention this is probably my favorite food I have ever had? Because it was, the best meal I have ever had. The fiance ordered the fried pickles, and the dipping sauce AND pickles were both incredible. I got conned into ordering their fried tatters (French fries, and he really had to force me to order them *not*) and I also ordered the mammoth pork thingy. I say thingy because calling it a pork chop does NOT do it justice. Think... Consistency of a steak, taste of heaven, with some BBQ flare in there as well. The collard greens were not something I enjoyed but thats because I am just not a fan of them. The pork was honestly just incredible. The french fries (I forgot to write about these earlier) were ALSO perfect. Truffle oil, and an incredible Garlic Aoli that I wanted to be buried in a vat of.

This was #1 in Pittsburgh, so I went!Appearance: I drove RIGHT by this place once because I couldn't see the signs in the windows for it. Lol. It's a surprisingly small, quaint, cozy gastropub tucked into the first floor of which looks to be an office building that you have to walk through a lobby to get to. The big windows at the back of the restaurant unfortunately face the side of another building, but the 2 giant ones at the front give you a decent view of the street. It's all street parking, so good luck with that.Atmosphere: I LOVED it here! OMG! The giant, high ceilings, the interesting light fixtures, the staff uniforms and the freaking mirrors that curved with the walls were awesome. It was hype in there! Loud, but a good loud, like people were having fun loud, but you could still talk to the person next to you or more importantly, the bartender! I enjoyed that the bar was the center piece of the whole establishment and everything basically was designed around it! It just made so much sense.Service: Blake took amazing care of me. Great conversationalist, made good recommendations and he made me feel so welcomed there. He was attentive and amazingly friendly which just made my experience that much better.Food: I started with their Hot Cider which comes with a shot of Crown Royal Apple. It was absolutely delicious. I could barely taste the alcohol... so I added more, quite a bit more. Lol. Blake raved about the Smoked Wings here, so I just HAD to try them. 12 for $14.00 in a place like this, so I thought it was a great deal and OMG. They were AMAZING. I'd pay regular price for these all day long. They're smoked for like 630 hours, tossed in their whiskey buffalo sauce, fried, then tossed in that sauce again. They come out in a skillet on a wooden plank topped with green onions with your choice of sauce. Huge wings. Like, when I tell you I was going to eat these then move right on to the main course, these wings stopped me dead in my tracks. I had to force the last 2 down and was so glad I ordered them.Value: Looking at the menu there was a bit of sticker shock. Meatloaf for $25.00, Roasted Chicken for $25.00 and their famous 45 oz. Ribeye al la carte for $75.00. Things were a bit pricey, but for what I paid for MY meal (partly why I went with cheaper options) I felt it was a great value. Perhaps if I'm feelin' spendy, I'll splurge on one of the more expensive entrees.In conclusion, this is totally somewhere you have to come check out. I had a great time here all by myself sitting at the bar and just hanging out.

The lamb, salad, and sprouts were amazing. The risotto was flavorful, but was a little undercooked for my liking. The potatoes were well seasoned, but were huge.

Their bar was also super packed, but I let the bartender know I was looking to grab a seat and ordered a drink in the meanwhile. As soon as someone was paying their check the bartender gave me a heads up and I was able to settle in. I ordered a Bloody Mary because that's what I'm into these days. They have a DIY BM bar - first you choose your liquor and you get handed a glass, with a decent pour of said liquor. I went with chipotle pepper vodka, cause who doesn't love an extra kick. Then you head over to this assembly line where you dress your BM with different meats, cheeses and vegetables and then top off your liquor with the BM mix. I wish I was better at this whole dressing thing, but it is clearly not a strong point of mine. However, it was an experience and I was slightly buzzed after just one glass. It was STRONG. Since I was there for brunch, I ordered the Brisket Hash. Everything about it was to die for. The eggs were properly poached, it had the right amount of truffle oil, and the potatoes were delicious. I wish the serving size was slightly bigger but it was still everything I wished it would be. I would definitely come back to try out some more of their menu.
