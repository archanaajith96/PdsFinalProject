My husband ordered Mubarak plate which has a big amount of gyro, chicken with kofte and kibbeh. You can easily share this plate. I ordered the triple meat calzone.. extremely delicious! It was stuffed with cheese & meat...really filling.Also one of our favorites on the menu is the yogurt plate. It is one of a kind!Bottom line..Great food, good service & reasonable prices."}, {"review_id": "s99G5LG7oQ2eO1b2Gru1Wg", "user_id": "WZr11FW_6o4A-Jn6TX6UqQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "Layla's is a simple family run mediterranean style affair with gyro, lamb, chicken and pizzas with limited toppings. They do a fine hummus and tzatziki, chicken is often overcooked, but beyond that very little on the menu will steer you wrong. No alcohol is served there, they do have fresh baklava to make up for that.  They do a nice coffee and tea service.  One visit I did try their goat, something they do on certain days-it was excellent. They put a very nice quality mozzarella on their pizzas and in the calzones. The Mubarak plate is a good one to share and try a little of everything on your first visit. If you just want a gyro and fries, you will be happy with theirs.Prices are reasonable and portions are large. This is not a fancy restaurant. They do, however, have great service and the kitchen is open, which I find fun."}, {"review_id": "OOgBwktGri1PwE6gywEbKQ", "user_id": "KcfTZ2MtmveFi36NVGyTUQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "It's always a treat to come back to my old neighborhood and grab a gyro from Layla's. The food is always on point and it's nice to just pull up a chair cafe style and enjoy a meal with friends and family. One tiny letdown was that it was late and I think my server was really tired because he wasn't as attentive as I am used to though I admit, I've been away for a long while. But I love this place so I'll just give him a pass this time. I'll definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "BEyPfswm6Mh6MzFpELqBvA", "user_id": "Z_8clYC-IkqrfHcTCjzAiA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/15/2017", "text": "This is for the Layla's on Cantrell which doesn't have a YELP after being there for over a year or so what the guy told me, hopefully there owned by the same place? If not msg me will remove.However this hidden gem I just found by driving by and going wow where did that come from. Decided to turn around and pull it, wasn't that busy. Simple chill cafe nothing fancy but does the job with food quality and taste. Was pretty decent and I'll def be back soon to try a different dish. Mostly everything is gluten free besides all the bread but tasty!"}, {"review_id": "0wDpQbknLcco1LT7prkKFw", "user_id": "447GNvdzC-vUMyd1j9vCqg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "Food was really good and interesting.

Layla's is amazing.  I tried the baba ganoush and the gyro sandwich.   The baba ganoush was good but... the sandwich was write home yelp-worthy.  I have not had a shwarma sandwich this delicious for years, maybe not since Papa Christos in Los Angeles!  Hats off to the friendly owner who hooked it up with awesome food and welcoming kindness.  Little Rock, you lucky dogs you!"}, {"review_id": "DxAw8ll3I1TfcqlNjy3ziQ", "user_id": "OkaCoFXe3Rdcp0Gy48HMYQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "I must say, Layla's might just be my current favorite restaurant in Little Rock. It's the type of place I'd never say no to, the food is always something I'd be in the mood for. I've been here several times and look forward to each return. The yogurt plate is my favorite dish but the calzones are also very good. The hummus is delicious as is the babaghanoush which I especially like. The service is also always top notch. I always feel like a guest rather than just another customer, and that really helps make the experience special. Be warned if going at lunch that the restaurant is kind of small and is very popular so finding an open table may be difficult then. I've never had trouble getting a table at dinner."}, {"review_id": "chuzPlspw8kskiCAEgRT1A", "user_id": "pfEFht_c-Y5gkFeIzJCYag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I have loved Layla's for years & am always happy with their food and service. The beef/lamb gyros are favorites and I usually order the gyro plate to go, with extra pitas and extra taziki sauce. There's so much meat  with this plate that my husband and I get 4 meals out of it.

It's was great! Don't let the building fool you. It's not a very busy place. The inside is clean, plenty of seating. Even has a patio.

The gyro sandwiches are relatively cheap! And they give you so much meat. The meat is also so tender~ I also got 2 falafel's on the side. 1 piece of falafel was .25! Good deal! The food came out relatively quick as well even though that they were getting busy! The inside of restaurant isn't that big so seating can get limited.

I've tried most of their menu, the shwarma, the halal, the gyros, the kibbeh, the mubarak plate, even the pizza...Always good. My wife once ordered a big old load of lamb from them for a party, and when I got there, the guy takes me to where there's a cold stored lamb and asks how much leg we want cut. I said, \"hold on there. Let me double check this.\" and I called my wife. She wanted cooked halal meat, and they were very understanding and helpful. They cooked the halal meat for us right away and in the nick of time. So, the takeaway is that they've got super fresh meat!

Ordered the Murbarak plate, Greek Calzone, Baba Ganoush, and falafel to go for Mother's Day. Picked it up during lunch time, the place was fully PACKED! Despite being so busy, the staff always had a warm, welcoming smile. Murbarak is a good way to sample the various kinds of meat they offer if you can't decide what exactly you want, or, if you are like us, just want everything. The falafel had a strong minty flavor to it, different from the falafels I've had before. I am ok with that, though my husband doesn't quite care for mint. The portion for the calzone was nice and large, however the cheese inside was still in large shredded chunks, needs to be warmed up more for it to be melted. All in all, still a good experience. We're definitely coming back for more."}, {"review_id": "s5byV6obRxlkz17_93MEwg", "user_id": "VkLW8hEEa6ut6spVMhSppQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/12/2017", "text": "Food is delicious, well cooked and spiced.
