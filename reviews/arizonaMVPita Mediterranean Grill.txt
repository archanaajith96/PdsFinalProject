Awesome family owned vibe. They will remember you and your order. The food is excellent. I highly recommend the Kefta and lamb. Actually it's all good. This is in my weekly rotation and I'd eat there everyday if I allowed myself.The atmosphere is really laid back. Great spot for lunch or dinner. I also love to call in my orders for pickup. Overall a must try.Side note: They have been awarded best burger several times so you can bring your picky eater friends.

The gyros meat was tender, flavorful  and cut off the spit. The chicken shawarma is chicken breast and a great blend of  spices.  Tasted great but not cut off the spit like in very traditional places(baiz mkt). Baba ganoush  was smoky and delicious.  Excellent hummus.  Highly recommend if you're looking for a Chicago style pita joint that offers fries, dogs and burgers too."}, {"review_id": "pavwrBcLzwcgGg89XnVyRw", "user_id": "yHQHHWKX0V4k3DUnl2QLNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "The food here is nothing short of amazing!

Tucked away on Power, MVPita is the real MVP (most valuable place). It's authentic, fresh and homey. Once you walk in, they've got a big welcoming sign that reads \"hummus where the heart is\". And that's right. Their homemade hummus is like no other. Smooth, silky with hints of cilantro, it's the best I've had so far in Arizona. They've also got a spicy version of it that's got just the right amount of kick. I wasn't too hungry that day and ordered a few falafels, but boy was I impressed! They came out perfectly crusted, warm and soft on the inside. I often find falafels dry and salty but these were just the right consistency and taste. The spices also gave it a unique richness that I seldom find in ordinary falafels. MVPita definitely lives up to its name."}, {"review_id": "tMkRnrQ-xyNhSMY6RudaUw", "user_id": "lWwlPEbkR-yUt057Oc_wjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/7/2017", "text": "Super cheap, super good service, great meats and a free baklava...what else do you want?! lol.The Gyro is only $3.99 on Monday and Tuesday.

The food was adequate--I'd say the kefta kabob, gyro, and MVP fries were the best of the choices. I wouldn't do the chicken again as it had way too much salt and lemon. as for he spicy hummus, it was tasty but not authentic at all whatsoever. I also had the baklava which was pretty subpar but not the worst I've ever had...If you're going for authenticity, this is not the place, but they do provide a relatively satisfying meal. Even with sharing, I was really full so you get a good bang for your buck, but maybe not the most authentic Middle Eastern meal. In other words, it's deff quite a few steps up barely edible but a good few steps down for nomsnoms delicioso! Other than the food--they have nice/quick customer service, ample seating, and a parking lot."}, {"review_id": "upTHRZDgdeWZmLrufk4d8w", "user_id": "7CKD8kfo64pqSaWEv-Gb-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Great Pitas and a family feel!

It's obvious that they use the same purveyor for foodstuffs as many others pita/gyro places in the valley . . . and that's not a bad thing, however, it really doesn't do much to set you apart from the crowd. What MVPita does have are generous portions and friendly customer service.  I've been there when it was completely empty at noon on a weekday and when it was fairly busy during weekend lunch or dinnertime and each time the staff is friendly and congenial - jovial even.  However, the service is not overly attentive nor is the food prepared or served in a quick manner.  Granted, it is a Quickserve restaurant in which you walk to the counter, place your order and then the food is delivered to your table, so I really don't expect a lot, but it does take a bit longer to get your food than it should.  Another oddity: there seems to be a disconnect from the friendly staff and the delivery of your meal to the table.  It's a hands off affair in which there seems to be an indifferent attitude towards the taste and quality of the food served or the need for anything that might complement the meal further.  Read; there is no follow from the friendly staff about the taste, freshness, or preparation of your food; if you need something or have a request or issue, go back to the counter and ask - friendliness then becomes procedural. The Decor inside is nothing special, and somehow seems a bit cold despite having warm and inviting colors and textures such as dark woods and earth tones.  I find that the lighting is a bit harsh and abrupt (perhaps lower wattage bulbs, less reflective surfaces or better aiming?) and then there's that odd room at the front of the dining room with nothing in it that seems like the naughty corner . . . I always want to ask what it is used for, but I don't because I feel like I am the only one who doesn't get the joke or understand its function.  But I digress, as this is a casual quick service establishment not meant to be intimate or spend more than a minimal amount of time inside. Drink fountain choices are limited in quantity, and are of the Coca Cola variety.  I'm also sad to see that there is no fresh brewed iced tea despite the ample counter space for it.  Although the main food offerings are sufficient in flavor and size, I find that the side dishes are prepared with less love and affection than the main dishes.  This is evident in the falafel which can often be a bit dry and overdone, the Dolmas which share a dryness in the rice contained within, and the French fries which could, and should, be freshly prepared to order and not just kept warm - sadly, this was consistent on multiple visits. My overall advice, if you're in the area and have a hankering for Mediterranean, MVPita will do, but don't have high expectations as I find the food, preparation and atmosphere just average . . . with the exception of friendly, talkative staff that helps to slightly elevate an a-ok experience and is perhaps the reason for the slightly elevated ratings found here on Yelp.
