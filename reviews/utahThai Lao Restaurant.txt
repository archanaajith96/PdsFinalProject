My husband and I had a quick lunch here and were pleasantly surprised. On a Thursday at noon there was no wait and we seated ourselves. Although the lunch menu is small we had trouble choosing because everything looked great. I chose the massaman curry and it was fantastic!! If you like heat you can customize the spice level. I got a 1 and it was sweet with fantastic flavor. My husband got the #8 with a level 5 and it was great as well. Balanced flavor and perfect portions. Quick service, great food and an overall fantastic experience."}, {"review_id": "4xEBDMCM59MXfEA1DP5ylQ", "user_id": "9CkyzeXFiOXkx_2HjsAq1w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/24/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Excellent food! Everything we order was great. Especially loved the spring rolls (not the ones that are deep fried).I wish I would have gotten a receipt so I could list the foods we ordered but we ordered a lot.I'm confused on doing another review. At the time we ate the first review is accurate. We did have some minor issues with the nuts but this time I made it clear.I DID GET CONFUSED WITH TGE MENU SO ITOOK PICS OF THE DINNER MENU. They do have a much menu.ALL OF THE YELP PEOPLE SUPPORT THIS PLACE. I would love to see them grow and keep the same quality.Not sure if updating means to delete the previous Review or what. The food was great tonight. Just give more rice for take out. Thanks for texting me the menu. My friend who picked up the food said you were vewell we got the spring rolls but only got the plum sauce. Not 2 plum saves jusich easNOT ENOUGHFOR 2 let alone 4 people. Things were average"}, {"review_id": "8_b1d6S-anX2IOEywHk29Q", "user_id": "VWv1hF_7WBaayXGcTuYQgA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I don't know why this is becoming so popular to not be open without warning.

A small family owned restaurant tucked away in a sleepy strip mall, with amazing service, reasonable prices, and phenomenal food!We came in not expecting much, given the food experiences we've had in SLC so far and were blown away. We had the Tom Yum, Papaya salad, Panang curry, and fried Pomfret. Each dish was exquisitely prepared and had the perfect mix of sour, sweet, salty, and spicy. The prices and portions were really reasonable, as was the spice level. Most of the places in SLC can't seem to take out word on \"we want it spicy\" as the local population doesn't seem to be fond of spice..but this place..it was different. We asked for a 6 out of 10, and were pleased to actually get a 6!We'll be back soon and often - to try what's not on the menu!"}, {"review_id": "K2o8ACLBK8uQqZhzOOdjKw", "user_id": "uw1b5dus-9eoex7WK6MCqg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/10/2017", "text": "This would be \"a hole in the wall\" restaurant; a \"hidden gem\".I ate at a Thai restaurant in California that served Pho and when I came back to Utah I had to find a place that served this soup. Found this hidden gem tucked in West Valley :)If you have not tried Pho you have to stop in and at least try it and know what this soup is all about. It is a broth soup with rice noodles and bean sprouts and you can have your choice of tofu, meat or veggies. The spring rolls are to die for as well. They also have this Thai coffee... wow! If you want something different from Chinese food please stop in and try this! you won't regret it"}, {"review_id": "GRymn5GMjxBGkVTVOmeJPA", "user_id": "9b9rf6-Va0XSTFDi3vNblg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/11/2018", "text": "Best service!

It was my first time visiting here, and had a great experience. The place is not fancy at all, but very clean and tidy. The owner is really nice and friendly and insured that we were enjoying the food. The price is also very reasonable compared to other Thai restaurants in Salt Lake which is another plus!

The man and woman are very friendly. The place was empty and an hour from closing so I guess I should have ordered to go. But I like to see how people are and I'm glad I did. I'm guessing they are a husband and wife team. I didn't get their names. But she does the cooking and man is she a good cook. He does the serving and talking. Super nice to talk to them both. I ordered the 17 on the wall lol because I love veggies and pineapple fried rice. Yes it was just me don't judge lol. Now the beef and veggie stir fry over flat noodle was good but I wanted a little spice to it. I added a little too much lol and that was only half a spoon ful of the dry peppers and a little bit of the juice from some little peppers. Holy cow spicy! Lol the man said little too much spice lol when he added the pepper juice lol. Loved the fresh vegetables in this dish and the steak and noodles and egg. The pineapple fried rice was great just missing the cashews. I love the cashews and the raisins and wished the pineapple was fresh. I always order chicken with this dish because it goes so well with the curry added to the rice. Definately all in all really good. A little bummed they didn't have take out menus. But I still suggest coming in and having some food and a good chat with these two people. He will give you recommendations on sea food and spicy. Tell him the girl from Las Vegas sent ya."}, {"review_id": "zspMIplR1Lkl1uQjpnNzvA", "user_id": "vXI8v91wT0SJ-oiX7iPGkg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/2/2017", "text": "Decided to stop by here since we were in the mood for Thai food and it was on the way to our plans for the evening. It's a small restaurant, tucked into a mini shopping center. The restaurant is very clean, with excellent service, and extremely friendly owners. They carry your typical Thai restaurant menu, but with a twist- they also sell Laotian food too. I ordered a yellow curry, 1 spiciness and my spouse ordered the red curry, 2 spiciness. Their curries are EXCELLENT. I'd definitely rank the yellow curry on my top 3 list for SLC (Mano Thai Diner & Shanghai Cafe are the other 2). The only downside and this is totally dependent on personal preference, but it is spicy. The 1 spiciness was a bit much, but tolerable, for someone that doesn't do too many spicy foods. The 2 was really spicy, but good for someone looking for a real kick. Just don't too big of a spoonful of curry the first go around, otherwise the spice might leave you coughing from the kick. Give this place a try, you'll definitely enjoy it...and if you don't, you can certainly appreciate the excellent customer service."}, {"review_id": "uvaWkZqkZAmp4Z2aWSHo1A", "user_id": "B2F7f8NdlBUESv8cskE-jw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/14/2016", "text": "Thai Lao is the place if you are looking for food from the Laotian region.  They are just on the strip mall next to Lollicup in WVC off Redwood Rd.  The space was about mid-size, and can fit a small size party there.  They have a fairly white color theme and Laotian décor there.They have Thai and Vietnamese as well, but those are more of a complimentary dishes.  We got wide variety of dishes there, we started with some fried banana, a crispy rice appetizer with beef in it, some papaya salad, and tempura shrimp.  We got some Beef Larb with Tripes, Massaman Curry, Lao Chicken Udon with blood pudding, and Lao Vermicelli.  The Laotian dishes we ordered like Larb, the udon, and the vermicelli were all really good.  The Thai dishes were a bit lacking in flavors.  I would just stick with Laotian dishes when coming here again.Strange thing about this place is that sometime they close without prior notices.  So be sure to have a backup plan or test your luck when you visit them.  Service was quite Asian-ish, but nice enough..."}, {"review_id": "OMhuNxeOnNc5PcJt10i1Fw", "user_id": "pXPYGdzuI-VUo3KweOI-_g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "I hesitate a bit giving this little place 5 stars because it is usually not very busy and the better the review the more people might show up.  But this place is a gem.

Also the papaya salad Laos style and spicy hot. As us Lao people say Baw paet Baw Sap (if it's not spicy it's not good). Also don't forget the chicken satay too. The fried rice was also yummy and the portions at this place is great. The variety of items on the menu from Thai and Lao was great along with the price.
