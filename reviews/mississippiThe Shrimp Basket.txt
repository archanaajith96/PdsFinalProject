Been stopping here, on and off, whenever flying in/out of the airport for a few years. Staff is always friendly, food arrives quickly to the table and always tastes great!Today's lunch was shrimp & grits for him and fried shrimp basket with a side of red beans & rice for me. Both were equally delish! The Bloody Mary had just enough spice without being over bearing. My Mermaid's tale was a bit bitter, adding a small amount of sprite made it better. We will be returning during our next visit."}, {"review_id": "L4BrZaNuVL7lJAVs4Ry9Jw", "user_id": "mTk3C-WDxYVfgsUHC0dcnQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "The food is good but the service is lacking.  Today the waitress was filing her taxes through H&R block and her table had to ask for her several times.  All the girls love being on their cell phones and Facebook.  Let's get professional and put the cell phones down and concentrate on the customers.Last night I ate there and one of the kitchen staff was facetiming some girl at the bar telling her how he makes money and he is a rapper.  The bartender had a hacking cough and was good enough to cough on everything within 2 feet of her."}, {"review_id": "m4Mlg7ZZSBSZKqx8BUlBPA", "user_id": "Bjf5GdJdK8eXEYCy8yQCzg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/15/2017", "text": "The Shrimp Basket in Perdido Key, FL is the taste of my childhood, and the standard at which I judge other locations. This location although not quite up to par with their Florida location, always satisfies the craving for what I consider some of the best fried seafood on the gulf coast. My main issue here is the batter of the shrimp always seems \"gummy\" and falls off the shrimp when you're pinching off the tails- not something I've encountered at any of their other restaurants. Will it stop me for eating here? Heck no. Just not as enjoyable a taste and crunch. Our go to order: fried crab claws and the orig shrimp basket (sometimes w fries, sometimes w double shrimp slaw bc it's the best)"}, {"review_id": "aOOWa4LjiyVWZ6OFqtfuRA", "user_id": "v7uI0ymarNvvsaK0-Od-Ig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Stopped in for a quick bite on the way to the airport.  Service was fast and the food was great.  Gumbo and shrimp/oyster combo P.o.

It's just not really my cup of tea. One night after buying new shoes from the nearby Nike Outlet the kids were hollering about being hungry. Apparently they get cranky when they haven't eaten so I knew I needed to get them fed ASAP. The Shrimp Basket was very close so off we went. I didn't know this before sitting down, but this is part of a large chain of restaurants. I'm not sure where they're based, but they have several locations in Alabama. Everyone knows that people from Alabama have different ideas than folks from Mississippi or Louisiana when it comes to seafood. That was very evident here. It's not that the food was bad because it wasn't. It was just dffererent. The gumbo was just ok. The shrimp on my poboy was fried well, but the bread was soft and doughy. That may pass as a poboy in rolltideville, but it ruins the sandwich. Maybe a shrimp platter would've been a better bet. Service was very friendly and we wanted for nothing despite it being near closing and a huge party being seated. I'm not sure if I'll be back, but you might like it."}, {"review_id": "rFRziETY5eYpvgw9fL_2AA", "user_id": "PwxvKtwObykS2MeWJpfveQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "So if you're ever driving on I-10 to east or west and you go through Gulfport it's a definite place that you should stop. A little place called The Shrimp Basket Phelan eat shrimp for $15 all you can eat new potatoes and corn and coleslaw. All I can say is a little bit older a lot of butter and old boy. Our server kept the shrimp coming quickly freshly steamed had a great flavor no issues. My companions had a po boy and grilled shrimp both were equally awesome kind of hard to mess up the ocean roaches"}, {"review_id": "VBcF6TWEyvsAOPFgXyQYuQ", "user_id": "SwhbYXoqUSpJaYkjhM8P0Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "A more expensive version of Captain D's.

Not so good: $15.99 crab claws were way over fried and inedible. We tried to find some in the basket but finally gave up and sent back almost half uneaten. Seems this is an issue as I read another review like this one.The manager took off $6.98 so we basically paid $9 for inedible food. Collard greens side, new taters and hush puppies are standard tasting side fare.We visit a lot of their locations and would likely stop in here again.
