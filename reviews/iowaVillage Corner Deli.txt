This spot lives up to all the wonderful reviews and 5 stars! It's located close to Rock Island (10 min drive) but totally worth it. Arrived and there was a line but it moved quickly. Looked at the menu before I got to the register and order the Monte Cristo with a side of soup which was Buffalo chicken wing. The sandwich was amazing and piping hot! Tons of meat and a nice French toast type of bread. This is a HOT sandwich which is a plus for me. Who knew something so simple can be so delicious. The Buffalo soup had a mild kick to it and tasted great. Btw, the food comes out FAST. I'll definitely be coming back here more times before I head back to Maryland. If you're ever around Rock Island, you have to give this place a try. Trust me and trust the other reviewers.. You won't be disappointed!"}, {"review_id": "0Gyt7NHX3AIEb75_LzsOIA", "user_id": "PWerrsk0iVcjCGsQ6Uuy6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "Hidden gem. This place is just awesome.

I was just expecting something closer to the traditional chili I'm used to.  The place is small downstairs but they have an upstairs with tables. It's in a cool little neighborhood that has some shops and other places to eat.  I'd eat here again for sure!"}, {"review_id": "7iG4vvOh0PbVU_xGYqExpA", "user_id": "MN6vTCeRKWU44M7xwhQc7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2017", "text": "This place absolutely lives up to their 5 star rating!Walked into Village Corner Deli and was immediately greeted and handed a menu. My dining companion decided on the Turkey Reuben and I opted for the turkey pesto. My sandwich was packed with turkey, provolone, lettuce, and tomato. It had a layer of pesto mayo and was nestled inside a warm cibatta roll. The roll was just warm enough that the provolone softened but the rest of the ingredients remained deli cool.The sandwich may not sound all that astounding, but it was made with such superior and utterly fresh ingredients that took it to a magnificent level of deliciousness. I also had a bite of my dining companions turkey rueben, which is one of their few hot sandwiches. It was also astronomically delicious. They work quickly. There was very little time between ordering our sandwiches and being served. It's a order at the counter and they'll deliver to your table sort of set up. They also offer a variety of sides, bottled water/soda, fountain drinks, and hot soup. Their prices are reasonable, their food is amazing, and their service is efficient and kind--get to it!"}, {"review_id": "U-MJT6M1UpAucz6hehRktw", "user_id": "lrZ2YxAs98comameoanP1Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "I road trip a lot.

If ever I've been to a place that deserves to be on Dinners, Drive-Inn's and Drives this is the place It's truly a dive in the most endearing way.  It's always a plus when the owner is the first face you see when you walk in the door. Who would have more passion and who better to make a recommendation?  So when he recommend the Smoked Turkey Rueben, now anything with turkey I'd usually shy away from but his passion for it I had to try it.  It contained smoked turkey, smoked gouda, coleslaw and Thousand Island dressing, served hot on toasted multigrain bread. It was absolutely amazing on of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  I must be one heck of a nice guy because I shared it with my oldest daughter. It wasn't a complete loss as she gave me half of her regular Ruben which was delicious in it's self. I was able to try the  Don Correleone with Genoa salami, prosciutto, pepperoni, hot capicola, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, banana peppers and garlic mayo on sourdough bread along with the Tomato bisque soup.  The menu seems endless, not sure which sandwich I'd try next  It's not often I include the address and website villagecornerdeli.net in a review but I want to remove any excuses for you no to try the Village Corner Deli."}, {"review_id": "1ZtYv5e5jBYEcl4Medk-jQ", "user_id": "SaJlZTLG2rn9ntjhTyqMDw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "Damn good sammiches.

I know what you're thinking-sadness....five star review....I just don't get it. Let me help you understand. I am so sad because I discovered this slice of heaven, and I live 5 and a half hours away from it. It was so good. It was love. And now we are forced to be in a long distance relationship together, and I hate it. Anyway, I was on a birthday scavenger hunt for my best friend's birthday and our first stop was Village Corner Deli for lunch. I ordered the Philly and I have never had such a wonderful Philly in my life....and this girl has been known to order a Philly or two in her day. The meat was awesome, and had just the perfect amount of cheese, pepper and onions. The bread was so so good. My whole lunch eating party couldn't stop talking about how good their sandwiches were all day. The place is small and the service was friendly. We accidentally showed up right at closing and the guys working were still super friendly and accommodating to us. They cleaned up, but didn't rush us at all and even engaged in conversation with us on our way out. This little deli is wonderful. I want to try one of each of their sandwiches."}, {"review_id": "rNbpLDMqvLuf6Do067ZsUg", "user_id": "irGIYIOTWpWlwnVd7SdT7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "Made the drive from Dubuque just for lunch, wasn't disappointed.  Excellent sandwiches and service.  Will definitely be a frequent summer spot for us, especially during River Bandits baseball season!  Thank you for the hospitality.  Recommend highly for right priced and delicious food."}, {"review_id": "GkVFNdtYZnZKHVC5gzzA7g", "user_id": "buWc6cG3OIDodd3mXAqSoA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Terrific Reubens, both New York and Turkey!

Seriously super good, very affordable and certainly filling.  I got the Philadelphian on gluten free bread.  it was very good and since the gluten free bread is a little smaller they make two sandwiches for you for the price of one. Now for a person who has to be gluten free and doesn't get sandwiches often that was awesome! My husband got the Cuban and he loved his sandwich too!

We were pretty stoked to find this place.It's a very unassuming spot in Downtown Davenport. They've got quite the array of sandwiches, very few of which are boring. The first question that you must ask yourself when you come here is have you ever had a sandwich with egg dipped multigrain bread? Read: have you ever had a sandwich on French toast? We hadn't either until we came here and we very much enjoyed it! This creativity is what really got them a 5-star bump in our minds.We enjoyed a Monte Cristo which was the aforementioned sandwich with French toast. The turkey, bacon and cheese all warmed up and sitting in between the French toast was absolute Magic. It was like everything was just getting a hug from the bread. We also had the Philadelphian which included roast beef comma peppers and onions along with some delicious cheese all the top grilled sourdough. We always appreciate taking a classic and making it even more delicious. I believe they make all their bread here and it definitely shows, as the stuff was really really good.My wife appreciate it that they serve kettle chips and our kids appreciated that they had cookies for dessert. All in all, this place was a big win and an easy place to get in and out of when we had sleepy kiddos and hungry Mama and Papa bears!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/village-corner-deli-davenport?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
