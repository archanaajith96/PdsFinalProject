The first time was for dinner I had the chicken with waffles. I loved it. The fried chicken was crispy yet moist the waffles were good.Today we had lunch I had the brisket sandwich with homemade BBQ chips and slaw.I have to say I was disappointed in the brisket it wasnt tender like I had hoped. The homemade BBQ chips were salty and had a nice peppery kick. I ordered a side of the cornbread and honey butter. Nice size pieces of corn bread that tasted so good. Just wished it came with a bigger cup or several of the small cups of honey butter. Overall good meals and I would visit them again."}, {"review_id": "JTAS94mhTlgXNRW8cV0IVg", "user_id": "sLJrrc7Ucaz-m1Gv3PBZWg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "Went here for dinner with my children. The food was delish, the decor and atmosphere is what one would expect from this type of place. Jazz music is the theme. Live bands on select nights.

Love them so much I even used them to host my high school reunion. My absolute favorite dish is the Jambalaya. This dish is so good, I once ordered it for catering of a private event and even the vegans were eating it (seriously lol). The cornbread is amazing. I also love the fried chicken and mac and cheese dish. The gumbo is one of my favorites although I haven't had it since I was pregnant and the heartburn almost took me out. Great vibe as they often have live music. Outdoor seating for the good weather day.

I Took my gf out on a date here.My girlfriends food came served with a contaminant lodged in between it.  I'm not sure how the chef AND our server missed the huge piece of paper in her burger. We spoke to the manager, and she returns with a 10$ gift card. After being served a burger with a possibly contaminated large piece of paper, we DID NOT want to return to their business, so the gift-card was pointless. In addition, the owner nonchalantly gave us a gift card that didn't even amount to the price meal that was ordered. She did not take into consideration that she wasted our time, and the fact that my girlfriend left their business hungry. The owner had a very snooty attitude and barely attempted to rectify the situation. She decided to give us a box of cornbread and a 10$ gift card, to be used again at their business. Needless to say, we are not returning. Avoid this place"}, {"review_id": "wVv7Im3J4Sbm1d2jm1ItEw", "user_id": "fpJenf7KXCh-jGmyr4QWGw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "So let me share my recent experiences. Dined at the bar: Stopped in for a quick dinner he got the chicken and waffles and was in love. I got the salmon and was very happy with it. The drinks were strong but not tasty. The service did take a while, but the place was also very packed. I believe the server made his best effort to take care of us.  Dinner Party : Celebrating a couples birthday with family. They allowed us to reserve an area to make it private for our big party which was great. We had a mixture of appetizers, entrees, and some opted to go with the Taste of Hartford three course menu. The jambalaya was not as great.... but there were not complaints on anything else. They had a live band this night, which was a nice touch since we were celebrating. Catering: For a small birthday celebration, I ordered two trays of chicken wings and macaroni and cheese. I decided to go with this option as this location is convenient for me to pick up from and the prices compared to other places for what i was looking for did not compare. This was certainly my best option as we all know catering can get quite expensive and this was not a big celebration, so I didn't want to break the bank. The wings were so good and my friends really loved the mac and cheese. I personally hated the mac and cheese and wouldn't order it again, but all of my friends could not get enough of it. They ate it all. Online ordering for catering: Five stars for this part of my experience, it was super easy to browse their catering options. They offer per person pricing and also allow you to order big portions instead(which is what I did for about 12 people). Placing the order online is super simple. Pick up: I showed up a few minutes late to pick up the food and had to wait about 5-10 minutes for it be ready. But they packaged it very well in sturdy boxes and placed it in my car for me, so this was a positive experience. Overall, I think Black eyed sallys is a nice place for dinner and catering as they have great options and a very simple ordering process."}, {"review_id": "0T_lVcyjj3jgTm9y_eSjVQ", "user_id": "jW4OIJuAsFUxykK1P7qOoQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "After several years, I have to add that their ribs are the best I have had in CT!

Upon entering- it was very warm. They had some fans going but I was definitely feelin' the high temps throughout our time there. Not super pleasant.As soon as the band started playing- we knew we were in the right place. Jazz Monday on point! The ambience was perfect- glowing purple stage, light chatter amongst the guests. Everyone was having a good time.Our waitress was great! Despite a full house- she checked in with us regularly. The real issue here was the food. Everything was underwhelming & needed some serious seasoning.Fried okra and pickles were OK. Crispy wings-burnt.Brisket mac n cheese- bland.Cheesy grits- bland. (so bland!)Shrimp- pretty tasty.Corn bread- good.We were disappointed to find out that you couldn't order a side of fried chicken. It was basically fried chicken and waffles or nothin'.

I ordered the catfish which I thought was fried catfish . Idk what kind of catfish they've seen look like baked tilapia but that's not it at all ! The fried chicken was tasteless for seasoning .

When I go to a place for BBQ, I usually look for simplicity and excellent, tender, smoked meat. We chose to sit outside because the majority of the restaurant was reserved for live music on Friday. That being said, we were a little forgotten once we had our food. Now the real thing that was disappointing was the food itself.

Service was good, but that's where the great positives stop.We got the Brisket Mac and Cheese and Pork Plate as per the suggestions of my fellow Yelp Community, and we felt a bit cheated by the whole ordeal. The sausage was good, the rice and beans fine, but the pork ribs and pulled pork just mediocre. Usually you'd want them to hold their own, but these required sauce to even make them palatable. The pork ribs didn't fall off the bone and lacked any real bite - they had an off-putting smokiness to them that's not the normal BBQ smokiness. The pulled pork was fine, but again, lacked any real punch. The Brisket Mac and Cheese was also lackluster, in that any flavour inherent in the meat was drowned out by the liquid cheesiness of the plate. The mac and cheese portion was fine but it didn't have any real structure or integrity to it and felt like velveeta. I really wish I could like it more like others have, but I can't find myself lying to you all for that purpose."}, {"review_id": "tuw7PcpBOPQPqvkrrNrZYw", "user_id": "zT_dLz3z-NIz6GzZaD2dcg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "7/6/2017", "text": "Southerners! Avoid Heartache by Avoiding Eating HereAny southerner with half a wit would know better than to expect authentic southern food in Connecticut, but it's been a long while since I've been back home, so when I saw a restaurant claiming to be southern, I got nostalgic. Ambiance and wait staff were as sweet as the tea in Kentucky (not the tea in this establishment). The greeters could use some work as I stood for quite some time unacknowledged by two, one of which stepped right in front of me and rudely turned her back invading my personal space.  The welcome is the most important feature to southern ambiance. The food disappointed with every plate. Food in the south is more than just food. It's history and tradition.  Food is the unifying cornerstone of southern culture. So when you mess up the food, you mess up southern soul. The food was the most disappointing experience of the visit which defeats the purpose of a southern restaurant. Coca-cola products on are not on the menu. In the south we call all soft drinks \"coke\" because coca-cola is the drink of choice. Sweet TeaSweet tea has three ingredients: Water, sugar, tea. Sugar is added while the tea is still hot. Do not yankee-fy it by adding any other ingredient.  When your taste buds expect southern sweet tea, but get Connecticut tea, the reaction is similar to expecting fresh milk and getting spoiled.  You have warn your guests that the \"sweet tea\" is not the iconic southern trademark their taste buds are anticipating. OkraWhen they brought out the okra my heart sunk at just the sight of it. With southern food, you can taste the love in every bite. This chef didn't care enough to slice the vegetable which made the fried okra soggy. It needed sauce to power through eating them. You don't fry a whole pickle and serve it, so why would you do it for okra? Here was the social media response when I asked southerners if they'd ever had whole fried okra:Tennessee: \"Never. I would have been surprised had these arrived at my table.\"Missouri: Who does that??? To which a Texan replied, \"Lazy fryers\"Alabama:  Aww hell nawVirginia: That's weirdNorth Carolina: Wow. That's crazy92 year old Kentuckian: I've never had it like that before. Mine's have always been sliced. I don't think would like it that way. Sounds like you need to find a new restaurant. Cajun Deviled EggsStandard church picnic fare. Nothing Cajun about them. Add cayenne throughout. Not just a sprinkle of paprika. Blackened SalmonSalmon isn't particularly a southern staple (unless it's breaded and fried) so I knew I wouldn't have unmet expectations in ordering it as I would with smoked, bbq'd, pulled-pork. The Salmon, mashed potatoes, and green beans were the most satisfying part of the meal. Delicious.As Dolly Parton and Beyonce once explained, people work hard at their jobs and pay good money to see them. It's their job to be professional and give their guests their money's worth. I spent over $55 for one meal and left disappointed. You cannot call this a southern restaurant--- It doesn't nourish the soul but starves it.  You can call it country food. Or Farm food. But it is far from southern food."}, {"review_id": "R_OYWSVuu_klQyihPoS00w", "user_id": "53BRbGBZlvXuAcmKccFazQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "I've had two experiences at this establishment.
