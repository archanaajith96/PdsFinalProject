Fast forward another 20 minutes and the waitress finally came back to take our orders (soup and pizza). So all in all, upwards of 40 minutes just to take our orders. After ordering, it seemed like an eternity to get our soups and pizza. Oddly, they brought our pizza out first. I was expecting them to serve us the soup as an appetizer to enjoy before the pizza came out- so it was a little off the mark to get everything in reverse order. They must only have 1 cook working back there because I could tell other patrons were getting frustrated as well. Alas, here's the review of the food itself.The bratwurst and sourkraut soup was good. The flip-a-delphia pizza (basically a Philly cheese steak-inspired pizza) was also good but probably not worth the $18 asking price. It was just able to feed my wife and I even though it was advertised as \"family sized\". The green peppers were underdone and the pizza itself was slightly luke warm but the taste was pleasant. The fried onions on top were a good addition to the pizza and gave it a little extra crunch.To sum it up, we won't be rushing back here anytime soon. The service was lacking; I feel they need another worker helping customers. 2 employees alone can't handle the evening dinner influx of people or else they need to be more attentive. We weren't the only customers feeling like they were being overlooked. And finally, the food was good but probably not worth the asking price."}, {"review_id": "Na9irpeXFrP1MiOj7Sw-bA", "user_id": "45AlGcrvbaFqK1zkmBVpKg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "After several Hundred miles driving then miles of hiking, Thirsty Belgium was a great stop.

At the recommendation of a friend we decided to meet up for an afternoon drink. Upon entering, I realized how awesome this place really is. Everyone in the restaurant seemed happy to be there (including the employees). Such a great atmosphere, pull tabs available, music volume just right, and great crowds of people. Each drink is served in glass to match the beer type. I haven't seen this in Rochester, so that was really cool. Menu very well priced, Belgian Waffles on Sundays (yum). I was also informed this location is a Packer bar during NFL Sundays. I'm not a Packer fan but it seems to draw good crowd. Highly recommended!"}, {"review_id": "42bFDHLeSb36tBK16IBvsg", "user_id": "mPm0JJxk_rWDpA8RJKU6_w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Really liked the ambience and service at this place!

Really enjoyed the servers who were a lot of fun and knowledgeable about the different beer, spirit and food options. We started with the sausage platter just because it was different. The sausages were pretty good but I wasn't overly impressed with the smoked hard boiled egg. We both had the Thai chicken soup to start and that was delicious. I had the Beet and goat cheese salad for my main course and that was decent. My coworker had the toastie sandwich which is kind of a grown up version of a grilled cheese with some unique ingredients.  That was really tasty.  Good food, excellent service and terrific selection of Belgian beers. Would go back for sure!"}, {"review_id": "yWOVbIeRhkgZ-ac-kjT4Tw", "user_id": "EjzUbdaVaoFw3zCp0T2rjw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/12/2017", "text": "I was a little peeved that the hubz always chooses some pub for food (when it is his turn to choose). Boy, am I glad he brought us here!The food is amazingly food. Definitely not a regular pub, more than lives up to the gastropub title!The lobster bisque was about as good as the $$$$ Pescara restaurant at the Double Tree. The pear and pecan salad was delightful with the recommended vinaigrette dressing. I thoroughly enjoyed everything here!
