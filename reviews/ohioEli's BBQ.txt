And it was. After not seeing people for a few miles of our drive, we pulled up and suddenly found all of them at Eli's. It's a non-assuming place with a cute pig sign out front. You walk in and order a pulled pork or chicken sandwich, or a hot dog (or meat without a bun). Then come the sides: mac & cheese and jalapeño cornbread sounded the best. You can choose to eat inside, OR they have a huge, outdoor structure with clear, plastic sides and indoor heating lamps for people to eat. There's hay on the ground inside of it and lots of picnic tables. You can BYOB and there's lots of colored twinkle lights and games you can play. What a cool hangout spot! Our food was incredible - both of us said it was the best bbq pulled pork sandwich we've ever had. Man, I can't wait to return, especially on a summer's day."}, {"review_id": "t8mHiUBEe--a-_bfMSdsHg", "user_id": "VbwtabHH47kmn79f-H_KvA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Ribs (5/5) definitely what I'd recommend since how many ribs you want makes up about half their menu.

This place has really stepped up their game from the small inside area with picnic tables they used to have!The value for what you get here is amazing. I usually get the pulled pork sandwich (sometimes the turkey) with grits and corn bread on the side ($10.25). The pulled pork sandwich comes with a tiny order of cole slaw on the side already too. My husband always gets 4 pork ribs with mac n cheese and baked beans ($15). It's a lot of food for two people, but we almost always finish it because everything is so delicious. Their meats are better than their sides, but I love it all. And the best part, it's BYOB!Also, I've used Eli's for catering and they were super easy to work with and their prices were reasonable. I recommend you check them out for your next birthday party or event. Not the best BBQ I've ever had, but certainly the best in town.

It's located in a weird industrial type area and is easy to miss. Look for the pig on their signage!Parking is just fine as we found a spot right in front. We came just past 1 on a Tuesday and there were two others eating here, probably on their lunch break. You walk through the front room to a smaller room where you place your order. They've upped prices as I noticed that some of the menus here on Yelp are outdated. 2 sides adds $4 to your bill. My two friends and I all got pulled pork sandwiches with some of the same or different sides. We got different mixes of baked beans, cornbread, slaw, and cheesy grits. Food came fast! Soooooo good. Seasoned well and sauced well. Wow! The beans and cornbread also had some heat but were still soooo good! My friend didn't love the grits. They were much cheesier than she anticipated. They butter the bread which made it really appetizing to eat even on its own!Warning though, they don't have tap water here. You'd have to buy bottled water or perhaps bring your own. The guy said he discourages tap because it's gotta come from either the bathroom or the mop sink. Gross! Probably the area of town that they're located in that doesn't allow for clean water to drink?The front room felt a little cold. Not sure if they just didn't have the heat on but i was shivering!

My group's consensus was that the ribs were very good, but the tips were less memorable. As the token vegetarian in the group, I did a thorough exploration of the sides menu. I really appreciated that their menu had a table listing which items were vegetarian (and which items met other dietary/allergen restrictions). The jalapeño cheddar grits were spicy and amazing - I'd come back just for that! The mac and cheese was also well-liked.Service was pretty good. The wait was long, but they accurately warned us how long it would take. We were lucky to get the last table inside, so we didn't have to sit in the tent outside. Another thing to note is that the place is BYOB."}, {"review_id": "jC1HW0MbK85Xs2dz3QwjsQ", "user_id": "WeBNJNOChW83SklHbwKiQg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Excellent pulled pork sandwich! Bbq sauce was delicious as well. The baked beans were nice and slightly spicy from what I think was chili powder. Nice complement to the bbq sauce. I am one that thinks the meat is a delivery vessel for the sauce. However this meat was well done. Or done well actually. The brine was evident in the flavorful pieces of pork and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Some of the best bbq in the Midwest. Absolutely love going to eat in or just picking it up to-go. My bf swears by the rib tips, pro tip: order the full platter rather than just the smaller order. The meat seems to be much more tender when you do the full plate. I get the all-beef hotdogs fully loaded. Fully loaded = bacon bits and coleslaw, absolutely amazing. There's plenty of seating outdoors, they have a big tent during winter time with heaters and bathrooms out there. Highly recommend getting as much bbq sauce as you can, it's amazing. I got my bf a bottle that they were selling around Christmas time, highly recommend buying a bottle if you can find some! There's parking in front of the restaurant or on the side streets and around back. The wait is never too long and they give you a buzzer. Warning: it's really popping during warmer weather so wait time is likely to be longer. It's BYOB so bring some brews, an appetite and get ready to enjoy a delicious bbq meal."}, {"review_id": "5x1oK2JbuYE5g5Um8EhlwQ", "user_id": "EOajY1L3ole3gLTCZ2xw1g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/18/2017", "text": "Got the rib tips. The portion is massive. However, I wasn't impressed with the execution of the ribs. The ribs were somewhat tough and definitely not falling off the bone. Significant connective tissue and tendons remained unbroken on the bone. There was a well-seasoned rub on the ribs with a slightly sweet complexity. This was enjoyable.

Hands-down, the best barbecue in Cincinnati. I had heard people talk about how tasty this restaurant was, and I finally made the trek down to Riverside to check it out. I was not disappointed! When you drive by the restaurant, it looks like a hole in the wall... But the food is amazing! In fact, they have a cool area outside under a wooden shelter with lights and picnic tables for you to enjoy their barbecue. Last night, but even had a food truck available for dessert. I like that this restaurant is just there to serve delicious food. It's not fancy because it doesn't need to be. If you order the food to go, it comes and just a normal container and a plastic bag. Know that you order your food a la cart. You order your main dish and then your sides. If you order two sides, they give you a special deal. They have several options for canned soda, and it looks like they tried to support local brands in Cincinnnati, as well as your normal sodas.You can sit inside the restaurant or outside. I cannot wait to go back. Make sure you get the Mac and cheese and the corn bread! It's hands down delicious.

The pulled pork is tender, FULL of flavor and served on a nice buttery toasted bun. Every bite melts in your mouth.  In my opinion, it doesn't need the BBQ sauce, but what a nice bonus bc the sauce is amazing! Sweet with a little smokey kick. You can pair the sandwich with any of their sides. My personal favorite is the jalapeño cheesy grits.  They're creamy and spicy and I crave them like crazy.  I'm also a fan of the baked beans and mac and cheese, but honestly, you can't go wrong with any of the sides here. Eli's has grown into a hometown favorite, not only for their food, but for their laid back, outdoorsy atmosphere. If you visit on the weekend, be prepared to wait.  You can BYOB and relax outside and enjoy the nice weather with friends and family and it's also very kid friendly with lots of areas for them to run around and play. Always an A+ experience when I visit Eli's!"}, {"review_id": "6VTrkk_0URmgxwPed-VD1Q", "user_id": "sgaPBwvKOjfdUFiygfNc5Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Eli's is incredibly delicious.

I came here for the first time on Friday night with some friends. I am not a huge fan of BBQ, but I will give anywhere a chance that lets me sit outside and BYOB. When you arrive, you go inside to order from their friendly staff. They have a separate counter for carryout which is very efficient. Once you order/pay, you get a buzzer and can go right outside to get a table. They have a new awning with picnic tables under it which is very cute/convenient. There were bathrooms outside also but they haven't opened yet. The only negatives were: it took a long time to get our food, however, they did tell us it would be about an hour and I was drinking my own beer, so no problem there. They also only had a one person bathroom inside that had about 8 people in line at all times; once the bathrooms outside open it will be way better. I ended up getting a plain hot dog and mac and cheese for about $6 and it was amazing. One of the best mac and cheeses I have ever had. I will be back here on a nice afternoon.
