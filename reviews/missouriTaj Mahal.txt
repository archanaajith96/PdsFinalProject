In quality and service they are like the Caesar's Palace of their cuisine. 5 stars. This place is fantastic over the past 4 years I've enjoyed not only fantastic food but the service to go with it, and consistent quality. If you love this style of food, treat yourself and enjoy what they will prepare for you. Their prices are ridiculously low. Trust me you will be thrilled with your experience. Thank you Taj Mahal."}, {"review_id": "kmFLjXozcJB-6sNoPfdGxA", "user_id": "GkRDHvuMz316iGSGqhc6rg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "I love their Indian cuisine.

The dishes are flavorful and consistently delicious. The staff is friendly and attentive.

We just returned from Seattle and were skeptical, but the food was fantastic! The Channa Daal was the best I've ever had! Better than the best Indian food restaurant in London and Seattle.

Lots of vegetarian options on the buffet for me (more than average), but still plenty of meat for my husband. Do yourself a favor and order Mango Lassi (for anyone who hasn't had one, it's a drink) for dessert. I appreciate that they offer a Saturday buffet, too. Clean. Music at a good (quiet) volume. Staff present but unobtrusive - they clear dirty plates quickly and keep water glasses refilled at regular intervals. Bathrooms very clean, well-stocked, deodorized, and warm (I'm here in the winter)."}, {"review_id": "EPBXdzo0PYCxVnfLEQiL_A", "user_id": "u27CmVGHETApxZm5j1M44A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/25/2017", "text": "I was craving Indian food so I decided to give this place a try. I ended up ordering take out and got the chicken samosa appetizer, the chicken tikka masala medium spicy and some garlic naan. Well the service was quick. Came in and got my food immediately. People were friendly. The food smelt good when I was on the way home but honestly, it was a disappointment. The samosa was very oily and bland. It looked like it was refried a couple times. The chicken tikka masala was not spicy at all and also bland. The naan was overpowering with basically raw garlic, I felt nauseous after taking a couple bites. I've had better. I may give this place another try, maybe their buffet just to try different things."}, {"review_id": "Vbhne8ZqNgMiXamV03bC1w", "user_id": "04bh3uWa7ukClC7R23dTpw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "We love the food and the family that runs the restaurant is always friendly and welcoming.

This place came out of the wood work a couple years back in the Springfield community, and it is quickly gaining its right to be a staple point in our town.The food here is always fresh, both when it is cooked to order, and on the buffet. You will be hard pressed to find an indian food place that offers such a great price on their lunch buffet. Almost every indian food restaurant to me is a little over priced but at lunch time this place is perfect. I could come here every single afternoon! I love their Butter Chicken, and the Chicken Tikka Masala, with the plain nan, and their Vegetable Korma is good as well. The portions on the cooked to order menu are huge and you will definitely be taking some home.On a side note: I think there is a lot of stigma about how indian food is super hot, well just a piece of advice. When you order off the menu you can select your spiciness here so don't knock it till you try it!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/taj-mahal-springfield?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
