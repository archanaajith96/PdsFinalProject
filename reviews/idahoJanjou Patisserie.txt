I made it a point to stop in and get at least a croissant. Walked out with not only a croissant but a few more tasty treats as well. I can't say enough about the croissant. Flakey, buttery, crispy, delicious.... When ordering the other tarts and treats I asked for a 'regular' eclair. I was quickly told that once I taste it I will, 'Find it anything but regular!' I feel as though I came across as offensive but that wasn't my intention! (In my ignorance, I didn't know if the Opera was a type of eclair!) And he was right. The eclair was really tasty, too. The chocolate filling was silky smooth and the chocolate and nuts on top were beautifully crispy.The lemon and mixed fruit tarts were amazing as well. They were both made with the exact perfect blend of fruit! I truly appreciate the dedication and work that each of these hand crafted treats take. I don't even mind paying more for such a well made product. That being said, I was a little jolted that I was not thanked for coming in and before my transaction was completed the owner began taking the order for the gentleman behind me. A smile and thank you would have been nice. I will be back. Oh, yes, I will be back. There are so many more breads, treats, and tarts to try!"}, {"review_id": "UoQzsx8Q5jIhuOLHUuwlxA", "user_id": "Y-fPeP9dmciMYg83esNSWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Everything about this place is lovely. The employees are kind, it has great natural lighting, it has a clean/modern feel to it, the pastries are wonderful, and the coffee actually tastes like coffee!Pastries: I've come here twice now, and both times I've had a butter croissant. I am not exaggerating when I say it is the best I've ever had. This treat is beautiful to look at, but it's taste surpasses its visual appeal. On the outside of this croissant is an every-so-thin layer of crispy perfection. As soon as you break past this you'll sink your teeth into a buttery, soft, and perfectly chewy bite of heaven. Every last bite was wonderful. I was even tempted to try to gather the flakes that fell onto my plate, but I restrained myself.Coffee: You know when coffee has that bold, rich, but not-too-overwhelming flavor? The kind that when it hits your palate and moves up to your nose is so satisfying that you hesitate to put your cup back down? That is their coffee. They serve a specialty coffee roaster, \"Lizzy's Fresh Coffee\". Hats off to Lizzy, she knows what she is doing. But no cup of coffee is complete until a barista crafts it into something wonderful, and that is just what the gal here did. The americano I made was lovely. I added in a splash of cream and dash of raw sugar (as per usual), although it may not have needed it at all.Vibes: It's easy to focus in here. There was a decent crowd when I arrived and it ebbed and flowed throughout the three hours I was here. It's quiet enough to focus in on work, or a conversation, but not so quiet that you can hear a pin drop. Overall, it has a lovely vibe to it and is great for either hammering out some work, or meeting up with friends for a slightly ritzy coffee date."}, {"review_id": "-u84zURKDd_5_A3QtfZmXA", "user_id": "r3ZX7P4CH2yBri7uqQpEtw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "After savoring every delicate and colorful bite, I notice the James Beard semi finalist award on the wall.

And long story short, they have some pretty amazing baked goods.Tried the Laurel tart today (pictured above). Described as shortbread crust, almond cream, valrhona white chocolate chantilly infused with tonka bean, lime and fresh raspberry. And it was so damn good. Loved the lime, (I'm a sucker for citrus anything) and the tart/crust was delicious! Probably my favorite tart of their's so far.Backstory: I've tried several of their tarts over the past couple years. My sister-in-law works there and will always bring a variety of pastries for everyone to share when my wife's family has get togethers. It's pretty awesome!I will say, when I go here (and am not just getting the yummy things Alex brings to events) it's because I am craving a croissant. My preferred is a prosciutto and gruyere croissant, and basically, it is delectable. Sometimes I will get a piece of the leek and goat cheese quiche if I'm feeling fancy. It's really so tasty, especially if you enjoy a good quiche. And that's me-I love quiche.If you haven't been in already, go give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "3T8Ek5Q5xGd9EHU8XsUM9g", "user_id": "RGJ3UrTouNKj-tzW5Awwxg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/18/2017", "text": "I'm going to start this off with a little background... My family is French. Majority lives in France. Some of my favorite memories are in France. I'd like to think that growing up in a French environment and spending time in France has given me a good idea of how French food should taste and even be made. This bakery has some of the best pastries I've had. And that's a compliment since I've eaten some amazing croissants in France. Their croissants are flaky & buttery. They're delicious. I love their other pastries, quiche and coffee. It's the perfect place for delicious pastries. Each one of those pastries take time to make and it's very obvious they care about their work. It's reflective in the prices. Knowing the amount of work it takes to make one croissant justifies the pricey menu. You can't expect it to be as cheap as getting a donut. Amazing place!"}, {"review_id": "_SjhBXp07ZpK38c13pQEnA", "user_id": "MN6vTCeRKWU44M7xwhQc7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2017", "text": "In a word? Divine.Located in a strip mall on State Street, Janjou Patisserie serves up beautifully delectable pastries, tarts, and cookies. Came here with a friend, after enjoying lunch at the nearby Cloud 9, for some coffee and a sweet treat. My friend ordered their mixed berry tart, which looked practically too beautiful to eat covered in plump raspberries and dusted in powdered sugar. I opted for their Milky Way Tart, appropriately named as the level of heavenly deliciousness reaches real and actual galactic proportions. Layers of salted caramel and Valrhona milk chocolate ganache nestled in a crunchy chocolate almond crust--it's groan worthy. The shop itself is crisp, clean, and cozy. They have a few tables for enjoying your pastry and coffee in house (as well as a front walk patio for outdoor dining). They don't really carry supply enough to offer more than a piece or two per person, but with 72 hours notice will make you an entire tart to take home. With 24 hours notice, you can purchase a quiche to take home. Both are tempting prospects.But, really? This is the sort of place to go with a friend and leisure over coffee, pastries, and conversation.

It is a bit expensive but they use high quality ingredients so its understandable. Definitely recommend -  this isn't your typical American pastry cafe with mass production of mediocre quality goods where it's about how quickly they can get you in and out the door - it's a place where you can do that if you need to but it's such a great experience when you can go in, relax and take your time to enjoy each bite or each sip.
