You are a middle eastern restaurant, how do you run out of lamb at any given time? They don't even use lamb to make kofte kebab, they use beef. While yes, beef kebab is good (without the sauce they use), kofte kebab should consist of half lamb. But lamb is more expensive so they are cutting corners to increase their profit, which decreases their rating. And they pour sauce over kebab, which I have never seen in my whole life of eating middle eastern cuisine. When I eat kebab, I don't want anything on it that will mask flavor of kebab, assuming it was prepared properly and tastes good on its own. I forgot they do that, so I had to ask them to remove sauce. The hummous was salty so it just sat there. But on positive note, salad, rice and babaganoush were all really good, as was friendliness of staff and cleanliness of restaurant."}, {"review_id": "S3XymiKJQgdWejfEEqV9Bw", "user_id": "7niQ50opD9MjfDU8A4S_7g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/26/2017", "text": "Casual (think cafeteria decor) Middle Eastern restaurant up a flight of steps in a largely residential block. The service was fast and friendly and the portions generous. Although we appreciated the fresh vegetables personally we wouldn't have heated the meat and rice stuffed grape leaves and I prefer a thinner batter on kibbee and a slightly longer cooking time for the beans in a foul, but those are personal tastes and overall we liked the flavors and would return if we find ourselves in the neighborhood. We were lucky to find a parking spot in a nearby block, but it could be an issue, especially on a weekday."}, {"review_id": "k069FwNB3qQIg9Y6zM2ksQ", "user_id": "p43uSmRrLuLsoKlpPuslPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "I love this place.

I also this past year had my boyfriends bday here and it was so worth it. The food is great. I usually get the breakfast, which comes with fresh pita,  and plates of tomatoes, cucumber, feta cheese, I believe a type of goat cheese, zatar (which is a spice that you can literally put on just about anything) apricot jam, pickled egg plant, and eggs all for $20 and feeds about 5 ppl. Other items like the fried cauliflower, garlic chips, and salads are also amazing. The people are so friendly and the food is always consistent which is why I continue to come back. I've brought friends and family here and now they make sure to stop by if they are in the area to grab some food.

Like you can load up on apps and still get an entree. You will go home with leftovers and EAT them.-good hummus -plentiful pita-pretty much anything is good there!-service is super attentive and their coffee is great Cons:-parking. Ya might have to walk.-seating. Can be hard to get -it has changed owners but that really isn't a con. It's not the exact SAME, but it's pretty close and still pretty good. I've been here both before and after the ownership change. Yeah it was outstanding with the old owners, but it's still delicious with the new.  Go off the main eating hours so you are sure to get a seat. Go before dinner hour to get better parking.

The place is simple & small but the dishes are bursting with flavor. It's one of those mom and pop shops that guarantee a very satisfying home cooked meal. My extended family own and operate restaurants that serve middle eastern food for decades so I'm very critical when consuming middle eastern food at restaurants but I can tell you this is the absolute best. Here's what we ordered:Fried kibbee: ground beaf w/cracked wheat stuffed with pine nuts, onions, and more ground meat fried and in a ball shape----absolutely heavenly and not greasy (which is really hard to achieve since it's fried) Veggie fried kibbee: same as above but instead of the meat it's made of potato----absolutely delicious and a perfect vegetarian dish. Kibbee Kras: also ground beef w/cracked wheat with the pine nuts,onion, meat filling but this one is GRILLED-and NOOO it's not the same the fried one it has a more smokey taste to it and it's A M A Z I N G. Hummus: pureed chickpeas with tahini sauce (sesame based) and the perfect balance of garlic and lemon juice---- A MUST HAVE DISH-as simple as it is, so many places get this dish wrong either with it's content ratio or consistency. DAMASCUS NAILED IT. Babaghanouj: grilled eggplant with tahini sauce, some garlic, lemon juice --PERFECT and deliciousFattoush: romaine lettuce base, cucumbers, green onions, tomatoes, toasted pita bread, sumac herb (red herb that has a sour taste) salt, vinegar--where I'm from we usually make this potent pomegranate sauce but this was a new twist for me and I LOVED IT. Tabbouleh: finely chopped parsley, onions, tomatoes, cracked wheat, lemon juice & oil oil---PERFECT because so many places don't chop the parsley this fine. Moussaka: eggplant topped with chick peas and onions, baked in tomato sauce--this was absolutely delicious Falafel :Ground chick peas,spices, deep fried & topped with tahini sauce, tomatoes, parsley and lettuce---so many places get this wrong and make it dry but Damascus were on point with this dishShish Kabob, Lamb Kabob, Kefta Kabob were all tender and juicy and grilled to perfection. Bottomline, if you're looking for crème de la crème middle eastern food, DAMASCUS is where you need to be."}, {"review_id": "VFSK0MRkBQIClVo5Lo7VYQ", "user_id": "c3RW7ydGJF8VkmPQHhhAOA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/19/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Can't say enough good things about this place from the incredibly authentic food to the wonderful servers.

Also, I picked up a piece of regular baklava, chocolate baklava, and kanafi - all three were massive and delicious. There was left over dessert because the portions were so generous.

We got here right about 5pm, which is about when we like to eat... It was empty. After a warm greeting, we got to sit anywhere we wanted. Not crazy hungry... we opted for some hummus, tabouli, grilled and fried Kibbee appetizers and their lamb supreme entree that we shared. The hummus was good (we make a pretty decent hummus at home since it is pretty easy to make) the tabouli was very good and the Kibbees were something neither my wife or I have ever had. One of the waitresses liked the fried kibbee and the other liked the grilled kibbee. Obviously so as to not offend anyone, we ordered both. Both were excellent (crushed wheat and ground beef stuffed with sauteed onions and pine nuts) but I preferred the grilled. (and it was a bit healthier than the fried) The lamb chunks were done perfectly and very tasty. Served with rice and grilled onion and green pepper. I would have preferred some spicy peppers like I usually get in the Middle Eastern restaurants I like to frequent at home... but then I wasn't home and the entree was delicious, so no complaints. The service was excellent also and I guess our waitress liked us because she brought us a complimentary piece of baklava even though we didn't order dessert. Like everything else in this restaurant it was delicious. As we left, several large parties started swarming in for an evening of great Syrian food. I don't know if we'll be back this way anytime soon, but if you're in the area and are in the mood for Middle Eastern cuisine, this is a 'must stop.'"}, {"review_id": "xxW77kigMtdBtKLK2DHn1w", "user_id": "pHRc1gWuu7s7N-EKykbxCA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/20/2017", "text": "I've been going here for years.

At Damascus, my husband and I had the best and most authentic Middle Eastern food I've eaten outside the Middle East (and trust me, I've tried a lot; this is one of my most beloved of cuisines). We were fortunate to be able to try their Kibbe Nayyeh on a Friday night (usually it's only served Saturday or by special order) and it brought back memories of a fabulous meal in Istanbul (the Turkish version is chi kofte). Everything we tasted was exceptional: fresh, well prepared, authentic. You can taste the love in the preparation. It's BYOB which makes this eatery an even bigger bargain, and the service is fabulous. I think we left a 25% tip! Please seek this homey restaurant out when visiting the Lehigh Valley.
