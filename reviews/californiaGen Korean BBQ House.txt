We came here on a Monday evening, so we were seated fairly quickly--not to mention the restaurant was more than half empty too. We placed our first 4 orders and the table next to us (who were seated about ten minutes AFTER) got all their plates to their table pretty quickly, with no problem, while we kept having to ask where our food was. Once we finally got our orders, we had to do some more waiting because they forgot to turn on our grill and give us our sauces. The servers here barely checked on us despite it NOT being busy whatsoever. Overall, everything was extremely unorganized and the experience was very unpleasant. We were seated for almost an hour (the limit here is 2 hours) and we only received 3 out of the 4 dishes we ordered when we initially sat down, while the table next to us kept getting everything they ordered while ALSO placing their next orders. Another thing I found extremely alarming was the fact that the server would occasionally walk around table to table to ask if the plate he was holding was what anyone ordered. How does that even happen? It was ridiculous! It got to the point where I wanted to get up and leave. I'd understand if it was a weekend and if it was packed, but it wasn't. I've eaten here where servers give outstanding service despite actually being extremely busy on a weekend, so there really shouldn't be any excuses. The fact that our server barely acknowledged us and constantly kept forgetting our orders on a SLOW day is just upsetting to say the least. Management wasn't much help or at all accommodating either.To top it all off, our server mistakenly gave us the bill of the table next to us. It was shocking to see that their bill (which had six people, along with alcoholic drinks) came out a lot LOWER than our actual bill. It's completely ridiculous and honestly offensive that they received a discounted meal and much better service than we did. Don't come here unless you want to spend way more time waiting on your food than actually eating it."}, {"review_id": "f-pKG1EsO4dq3z9nKJZU-w", "user_id": "JW-3kniIVczV1nQPkCXlLg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/8/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "TL:DR   - Extremely understaffed and slow service   - very salty meat, some like meats like the thinly sliced brisket barely had fat and was therefore chewy.   - avoid marinated meats if you want to avoid your grill burning quickly.   - The Garlic Pork Belly and beef tongue are good.-------------------------Came here with my friends at 8:30pm and it was packed. The wait was 45 minutes but that's expected for Gen. I have been to Gen many times in the Bay Area and in SoCal and my experience here was one of my least favorites. I have been to this location in the past and know the service is slow, but my most recent experience here was worse. When they sat us down, they only had the Kim Chi and pepper banchan, no sauces, no potatoes, no seaweed. They brought our meat to the table, but it took us 15 minutes just to wave down the waiter to start our grill. Mind that we only have a 2-hour eating limit. We ordered our second round of meat and I requested for the rice paper. 3 meat rounds later, they forgot to bring it, so I reordered it and they said they ran out! We had a couple rounds and they would always forget to bring some meats out. I feel so sorry for the waiters her! they are always running around and overworked. I can't blame them for forgetting orders. However, on our 5th round or so, I had tried waving down a waiter for over 8 minutes. Our grill desperately needed a change because it was burnt and smoking like crazy, my party was very hungry still since the portions per order are very small. When I waved a guy down and was requesting for the next order of meat, grill change, and the banchan that they keep forgetting to bring out, he let out a big sigh and rolled his eyes as I was saying the order. I was just saying it in a normal tone but he had such an attitude. I guess SoCal Korean bbq changed me. AYCE Kbbq is a cool, hip, and still a relatively popular concept in this area. However, the quality and service are unmatched to the places in SoCal. This is my 3rd bad experience at this location. I recommend that you guys go to the less popular places like Beque or Yakiniq. Their options are way more limited but you will leave a happier person. I will not be returning."}, {"review_id": "0u43MEV6tHyY1dMO-kCXxQ", "user_id": "OMoBzr4FhDkk7yV8zYtmiw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "The anticipation of the grill can be grueling at times, the seemingly endless wait for seats, but I'm still a fan.

I had been waiting to try a self service bbq establishment with people who actually knew what they're doing, and this was my first opportunity.Firstly, the wait can be considerably long if you come during peak hours...which include pretty much every day for dinner, lunch and dinner on weekends, and even lunch time on Fridays. Plan accordingly, and make sure your entire party is present when your table becomes available.I was advised not to choose any chicken, because it can be difficult to know when chicken is fully cooked (especially after a few shots of soju). We opted for just pork and beef, but they also offer tofu and seafood.They have quite a few flavor options for the soju, and the two I've tried have been DELICIOUS! The green apple and lychee are must-trys. These babies are strong, and one order can certainly serve two people well.All of the flavored meats are mouth-watering. Sure, it's difficult to sit through your food being cooked in front of you when you're hungry, but if you just resist the urge to grab it off the hot plate, it'll be worth it! Prices are slightly less for the AYCE lunch, but there are also less items on the menu. Note: there is no lunch discount on weekends.Most people I know know about this restaurant, but I would certainly recommend a stop by here to anyone who enjoys Korean BBQ."}, {"review_id": "0cqP6p2bSActyK1CJ4MhPw", "user_id": "Hj9gGdI2Iz5gmsorFVYyow", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Gen Korean BBQ in San Jose is an excellent choice if you are looking for all-you-can-eat KBBQ and don't mind an extensive wait. I sat in the waiting area for over 1 hour and 45 mins, kept looking at the waitlist screen, noticed my name was not moving for awhile...then went to inquire about my wait. The hostess said they called me awhile ago, which is funny because I was sitting in the wait area the whole time. It might have been a little loud inside plus the wait area in swarming with people inside and out. After an exhausting wait, we were ready to eat.For $25, you get an extensive selection of meats, veggies, and other Korean dishes to choose from. You order from your waiter/waitress and he/she brings out the order in small portions. Although they only put in 4-5 orders in at a time, it is unlimited.Some of my favorites were #4 - Premium Chadol - premium angus brisket, #10 - Gen Korean yangyum Galbi - marinated bone in short rib (this was the BEST!), and #18 - Woo Beasal - premium short plate beef belly. Other items that were good or okay were #19 - Woosul - premium beef center cut beef tongue, #32 - the assorted vegetables (though I wish there was a bigger selection of vegetables. It is very limited), and #35 - Soondooboo soup (it was okay).I was not too crazy about #7 - beef bulgogi - marinated prime chuck roll cut, but my friend liked it. Our service was mediocre. The food was very slow to come out at first, but it picked up as the evening went on. I've been to other Gen KBBQ restaurants where the service was over the top, but here, the service was just basic. Overall, Gen Korean BBQ is one of my favorite Nor Cal (even though it's from So Cal) AYCE KBBQ restaurants. I would definitely recommend Gen if you love meats, but definitely not if you are looking for a good variety of vegetables. Just be prepared to wait awhile to be seated."}, {"review_id": "KB3NEnNLBtDnA2UfFhHHlw", "user_id": "Jc4CdqYIm0NLxs9f_sMgeA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Some of the meats are better than the others.

This location did not disappoint at all. Dinner time wait was only 10-15 minutes on a weekend. You'll immediately walk into a blue light lit restaurant accompanied by a playlist that consisted of Good Kid, M.A.A.D City and tons of trance music which just so happens to pair well with that guaranteed food coma! It's AYCE here, so be sure to wear those stretchy pants or jeans with some room to unbutton ( but if you're more into jeggings, those will work too) Although there were a few employees assigned to our table, the man worth mentioning here would be, Vu. He was downright amaaazing and did not disappoint. They have a long list of various meats but the hawaiian steak, and kalbi were my favorites. the beef bulgogi was a bit too salty for my liking. They offer appetizers as a part of the ayce. I ordered the popcorn chicken and calamari. the popcorn chicken was super crunchy and good. The calamari on the other hand, was cold , and rock hard. It tasted like it was previously frozen too.

In many ways, I really just don't like the idea of PAYING to cook my food...getting oil, grease, and meat juice splashed up on me as it's cooking.But ya know...the appealing thing of this is that if we cook it, there is MOAR to be had. Ok, greedy me can hang with that concept.Came here for lunch and while it was late and could be considered an early bird special for the old folk, the guy working was super sweet and let us have the dinner portion for the lunch time fee. Drinks and sides could have been brought out more quickly. I learned I had to order another drink re-fill when the previous request was dropped off at the table. The sides are good, but in small portions.I enjoyed the shrimp and the bulgogi the most. Had the pork belly and while it was good, it was a reminder as to why I'm not a huge fan of pork in general.The parking lot can be a bit of hot mess and well...it's what happens when you give my peeps a drivers licence.

Selection and price remains the same, which is a big draw and continues to make it popular.Location:This location is in North San Jose, near Berryessa. You park in the parking lot, and it can get a little hard to find parking during peak hours.Wait:We went on a Tuesday Night, and got a table for two in under ten minutes. I've heard others have had to wait super long though. Maybe on weekends this is the case.Banchan:Compared to the Gen Locations in SoCal, their portions of sides (banchans) are smaller; literally like a bite or two per side. And they only give you the different pickled stuff and kimchi. I guess if you want stuff like the potato salad, you have to ask for it. Sauces are provided: the sweet soy sauce-y thing, with the sesame oil and salt. If you want rice paper, and round radish slices, you must request for it.Meat:Portions of meat are also on the smaller side. When you order pork belly Samgyupsal, they'll give you one strip. Brisket, which is called premium chodal, comes on a small plate too.I guess this is their way of minimizing waste, but hey considering its all-you-can-eat, it's not a huge deal. You can order up to 4 items at a time. For dinner, This includes both meats and non-meat items like japchae noodles, dwenjangjjigae fermented bean past soup, and soondubu. The dwenjang was meh. Skip it. Meats in general were pretty good. Spicy pork bulgogi is a good one. They replace your grill often, as the oil and bits will char up really fast. Pricing:$25.99 for Dinner. 37 items to choose from. About 32$ after tax and tip.$15.99 for Lunch. 28 items to choose from. Noise:Can get noisy in there, as the music is medium to loud. Feels like a club with all the darkness and blue lights. But I was still able to sit down and carry a conversation with a friend."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/gen-korean-bbq-house-san-jose?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
