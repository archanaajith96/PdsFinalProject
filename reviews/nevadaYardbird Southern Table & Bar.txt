The issue I persistently have with chicken is that it is not usually well seasoned. But the chicken at this place was wonderfully well seasoned. I mean even the bits closest to the bone are just as well seasoned as the surface meat. So every bite was absolutely delicious! It was very tender and moist  and not overly greasy. I come from the South and I have not had better fried chicken!I ordered their Blue plate. I was doubtful about spiced watermelon with chicken. (I mean watermelon on a main dish with chicken?!?). But once I had it, it totally made sense! The sweetness and juiciness of watermelon goes delightfully with the fried chicken; it kinda acts as a palette cleanser and takes away any feeling of greasiness. Totally yum! Honestly, I think I'd always try fried chicken with watermelon after this. Don't be put off by this unusual combo! The spiced watermelon isn't overly spiced. I tasted salt, pepper and cilantro. It's very refreshing.Only issue: portion sizes are little small compared to the usual American size portions. But it was a treat!"}, {"review_id": "_vvT5Gm1XK01awkox0nfZw", "user_id": "LII6VfhAvxtGcjZooiIkDQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "I went here on a Thursday night and had a pretty good experience. The waiter knew the menu inside and out, as well as the cocktails and what items were the best on the menu. Obviously food in Vegas is very overpriced but it was yummy!Try the chicken biscuits as an appetizer - it only comes with 2 so make sure you get at least two orders. I got the wedge salad with shrimp but the shrimp were way overcooked. Try the bone marrow as an appetizer as well!They were all out of a shrimp macaroni and cheese, which was the special of the day, so that was unfortunate. Literally a few minutes before that the waiter announced that they had that on the menu and then he had to come back and tell us that they ran out so he should've been a little more prepared. It is nice to have a good restaurant inside your hotel but I bet you can find a better place that's cheaper to go to."}, {"review_id": "D_t7EWbOnSn1L764fOol8g", "user_id": "pa8zvcFxnj6jFtywlxKf_g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Always on the look out for brand new places to eat, especially Southern food. We came around noon on a Sunday afternoon. We got lucky only waiting for 15 minutes. If you have a bigger party  expect to wait 45 minutes or more. Try coming during the beginning or middle of the week. The inside: dim, more intimate, and family style sit down restaurant. A lot of seating from the bar to table tops, and booth style seating. Atmosphere of workers were also welcoming and helpful, especially to first timers.On the menu: they are known for their chicken, hence the name. They have odds n ends, small plates, sides, desserts, salads, biscuits, and chicken specials. Looking at the menu, my fiance and I ordered: the famous chicken n waffle n watermelon combo, lewelyns fried chicken, collard greens, cornbread, and the mac n cheese w/brisket. To soak it down w/their special sweet tea.The taste and the wait: lets just say this place by far passes all the places I have eaten at. The chicken was perfectly cooked, evenly seasoned, and extremely juicy. Add their special in house hot sauce and BAM heaven in your mouth. Waffles were fluffy, add the special bourbon syrup to it...again LOVED it. Watermelon, added sweetness to the end of the entire meal. The cornbread, on point. Not dry, spicy since they have jalapenos in it and moist (even after having leftovers, it was off the chain). Collard greens, spicy, juicy, and perfectly seasoned. Last the mac n cheese w/brisket, who can say no to that?? As matter of fact hats off to the chef (s) back in the kitchen. They made all the food with love. Only reason why one star was taken was due to cold food. Everything else has come down to almost perfect service.

The Mac n' Cheese most definitely lived up to the hype!!! It's a small serving (like a side dish) so don't plan on getting one to share- you won't want to share it with anyone (LOL)!!!We also had the fried green tomato BLT, cauliflower mashed potatoes, shrimp and grits, fried chicken, & biscuits. Everything was delicious! But do NOT miss the fried green tomato BLT- it was to die for!When people complain that it's pricey I'll confirm that yes, it's not cheap- don't come here with the kiddos if you're not prepared to drop about $175/$200 for food/drinks/tip for a party of 5. But for our family it was definitely worth every penny. It wasn't just a meal, it was an amazing experience!

The atmosphere had dimmed lighting which is perfect for food and conversation.

The Mac & Cheese did not make you full to the point where you don't want to eat. The consistency of the cheese was perfect, each bite was creamy in your mouth.

That being said. It is a little on the pricier side of things. Arrived at around 6 p.m. for a 615 reservation and We were immediately greeted and seated. Our server Courtney was awesome. Really can't say enough about her. She knew the menu. She suggested things based off of our comments and questions. And more importantly, she was overly attentive. For service like that i would return alone. To eat I had the honey buttermilk biscuits, Mac N Cheese, and the Shrimp & Grits(highlight).  The biscuits were cooked perfectly. Flaky and extremely soft. Also it came with 4 full size biscuits which was/is nice for sharing. The Mac N Cheese was my least fav dish of the night. It wasn't bad I honestly just expected more from it. Especially for the price and size(small dish). The Shrimp & Grits must be laced with crack because following the first bite I was hooked. As I'm writing this review I'm literally yearning for more Shrimp & Grits....order this! I had two mixed drinks that I can't recall; both were recommended by Courtney and she nailed it.  All and all a great time here and I will definitely come back however for the price i will have to be fully committed to spending big coin.

Hotel propaganda and Yelp steered us toward Yardbird, even though they told us over the phone that they were \"fully committed\" and we'd probably have to sit in the lounge area. When we arrived at the restaurant, the hosts offered to put us on the waitlist for a table, which was a nice surprise. But we were hungry, so we grabbed a sofa in the lounge area and ordered food there. A table actually opened up not long after we sat down, but we had more friends join us, so we stayed at the couches were there was plenty of space.To drink, I had the blackberry bourbon lemonade, which was exceptional. Strong, refreshing, and well-balanced. For food, I ordered the fried chicken and a side of cool ranch cucumber salad. Let me just say that the chicken was amazing. I've never had fried chicken that tasted quite like this, as the seasonings were very unique. But it worked well, and the chicken was exceptionally juicy and crispy. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it. Definitely one of the best chicken dishes I've had in my life. The tongs provided to help with breaking down the chicken were a game-changer. The cucumber salad was disappointing. It was pretty bland, and reminded me more of eating applesauce than of cool ranch dressing. I got this because the waitress recommended it, but looking back, any of the other sides probably would've tasted better.Service here was great. Since we were seating in the lounge area and not the main dining area, we weren't expecting full service. But our waitress was super attentive and helpful. We ordered a lot of food, and she was quite skilled at arranging all the plates to fit on the tiny cocktail tables. I was taken aback by how pricy the chicken was, especially considering it doesn't come with anything on the side. It's definitely enough food to share, but sharing limits the amount of dishes you get to try. Be prepared to spend about $50 for an appetizer, chicken, and side.

Waffles were awesome with their bourbon maple sauce. Watermelon was for me an unexpected great addition to the sweatness of the maple sauce and adding some freshness to the dish. The unexpected highlight of our dinner was the mac and cheese. Very cheesy but not in a cheese whiz kind of way. Chewy and satisfying.

The ambiance is dimly-lit and trendy casual with plenty of lounge-style seating. Very country chic. There are some things to keep in mind. We came with a large party (over 10) without any reservations and had to split our party in two and sit in the lounge or else wait a pretty long time. So, if you plan on coming with a lot of people, definitely try to make a reservation. Also, a lot of the menu items include pork or are cooked in pork fat (like the chicken). This turned out to be a problem, because it's not always explicitly stated on the menu. If you don't eat pork, be sure to advise your server. When our server, Steve, was made aware of this, he went above and beyond to make things right, which was very much appreciated!

Lol . Yardbird was packed on a Saturday night! They said they were \"fully committed\" in seating so reservations are likely preferable. They also have a sofa area or the bar where they serve full menu, so those are first come first serve. We didn't wanna be seated at a sofa and be hunched over while we ate, so we opted for the bar! The woman serving us was no nonsense. Obviously she was doing other tasks but we felt kinda rushed as she served on us. I'm not knocking any stars for that though. The food was good! We decided on the burger ($18) and the short ribs ($32). The prices were norm for Vegas but I think a near $20 for a burger is ...c'mon. Lol . We really enjoyed both though.

My server, Christina R., was the definition of Southern Hospitality. She was so vibrant, social, and full of energy. Christina really made my experience at Yardbird very exceptional. I felt bad that she got scolded by her manager/general manager because I kept wanting the centerpiece in the background of my pictures. I was a bit annoyed when the servers kept taking it away from my table before my food arrived. Luckily, I had an awesome server in Christina who was able to smooth it out with upper management and allowed me to shoot my Chicken N' Waffles N' Watermelon. I had no idea the centerpiece was used as a marker to make sure the table was tended to. That's a cool trick I learned about how they train their staff at Yardbird. As for the food, you definitely need to get the Fried Chicken N' Waffles N' Watermelon if this is your first time dining here. This is the second time I've had this dish and I cannot stop raving about the spiced watermelon to my friends. It's one of the best things I've ever had while in Vegas. The chill from the watermelon and spices they dip it in give it this combination of sweetness with a kick at the end. You definitely have to try this. As for the Fried Chicken, it's pretty damn good. I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had, but it's in my top 5. The breading is crispy and the breast meat is nice and moist. It definitely checks off a lot of boxes when I'm judging fried chicken. And that Bourbon Maple Syrup! Be careful, because you definitely can taste the bourbon in it, but it really goes well with those thick waffles.  Overall, I had a great experience at Yardbird. I've been here twice and I'm  already thinking about coming back here on my next visit to Vegas. I hear the Shrimp N' Grits is phenomenal, so I think I already know what I'm getting next time. If you can't decide where to eat on Restaurant Row in the Venetian, definitely go to Yardbird for great service and comfort food."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/yardbird-southern-table-and-bar-las-vegas?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
