Owing to the odd hour, there was no wait at all. We ordered two pizzas, a margherita and a Rosa. Both were cooked appropriately, with the correct amount of char. The dough crisp on the exterior yet chewy on the inside, with a wheat, nutty sweetness. Salted perfectly as well. Really just an incredible specimen. The margherita's sauce was, in my opinion, a little too raw/fresh tasting, though otherwise it had no obvious defects, and was made from quality tomatoes. The cheese was quite good, and some browning improved the flavor. The basil was standard but fresh and flavorful and entirely appropriate. 4.5 Stars. Both pizzas shared the same crust, so I need not describe it again. The Rosa was interesting mix of flavors, and quite good at that. The rosemary really tied the whole thing together without being overpowering. Additionally, the local IPA I had was clean and hoppy.And lastly, the service was excellent. Would love to return next time I'm in Phoenix."}, {"review_id": "lAHOtmhwFxb9wFQYXdMz4g", "user_id": "pX8BY8NVbla6Uzg3QIOe-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "I'm a vegan now and if I were to eat cheese any day of the year, I'd hop on a plane and make a beeline for Pizzeria Bianco and I'd immediately order the following: - Caprese salad - heirloom tomatoes so fresh you can still taste the sun.

(I'm from the midwest) and it was Pizzeria Bianco. I've been know to eat some crazy toppings on my pizza and was warned this was pretty basic. Once I arrived I was impressed by the set up. Bar Bianco next door complete with appetizers, the outdoor seating complete with games to play and the fact that our table was ready before the appetizer was ready so they just delivered it next door to us.  The setting inside transported you away from a busy downtown area to another place in time. We tried the antipasto with roasted vegetables, sopressata, and cheese. It was delicious especially the roasted beets.  When we looked at the menu it was clear, the selection was simple only 6 pizza's to choose from. My first selection was the WISEGUY wood-roasted onion,house smoked mozzarella, fennel sausage. Why? Because it was the most out there ingredient wise. It was excellent the slightly charred crispy crust and the combination of the onion and fennel sausage was excellent. Then I made the mistake of trying both the Sonny Boy and the Margarita pizzas, it does not matter what was on them other than the red sauce. I'd eat that red sauce off the sidewalk. I've always heard if you are going to a simple dish you'd better do it well and Pizzeria Bianco did. Chicago and New York are known for pizza but I've never had a better slice than I did in Phoenix.Pizzeria Bianco, back to basics pizza done right."}, {"review_id": "HgxlaN_wNJqo0dIeRuYI_Q", "user_id": "PcvbBOCOcs6_suRDH7TSTg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Came here on a warm Tuesday afternoon. Checked in at valet which was about $5 minus tip. The wait time for the bar was about 10 minutes. We spent the 10 minutes waiting at the bar across from PB. Service was fast and friendly. Drink options are Coca-Cola products, alcoholic beverages, teas and coffees. I ordered the Wise Guy which is fennel sausage and large grilled onions. It was melt in your mouth delicious. Wife ordered the Margherita and loved it. She said it was better than Grimaldi's and she loves that place.

We also had the market salad that was so dry, we had to ask for additional dressing.For our main course, we did a 1/2 and 1/2 of Margherita and Rosa. While I love wood fired pizzas, this goes down as the worse. Not only was the pizza too thin, but the Margherita was very bland with very little cheese and the Rosa was missing the red onions and rosemary. We were so hungry that we didn't bother to complain, but I do know that I will not be coming back.

Not quite literally but it felt like he took a step back, got something for another table and came right back to us. For starters, we went with the spiedini which ended up being more of a salady thing.  It was tasty nonetheless.  But it made me crave more proscuitto!Then we got two pizzas.  (Note:  The selection was surprisingly small...I think about 6-7 pizzas?).  We decided on the Sonny Boy and the Biancoverde.  I LOVE the suggestion the guy gave us when he served up the pies - let the Sonny Boy cool a little but eat the Biancoverde hot.  Verdict?  The pizzas were good. Not out of this world good but glad we came good.  I did have a problem with how burnt our pizzas were, to the point that it was bitter to eat certain slices, especially the Sonny Boy.  I'm familiar with wood fired pizzas and they don't have to be that burnt to be authentic or tasty.Final note: Their bread service is fantastic.  It was all I could do not to eat the entire basket before our pizza came.Anyway, glad we tried it!"}, {"review_id": "ytxp7XPGEn-CX_2gQqgwZA", "user_id": "YheNXybPpKEp5B3mcnYaRA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Seriously worth the hype! Try not to fill up on the delicious bread and olive oil they bring out because this pizza was better than pizza I ate at that UNESCO heritage pizza place in Naples, Italy. Seriously. The thin crust is just right, the thin sauce isn't too thin or runny, and the toppings are all local or made in-house. I went on a Sunday afternoon with no reservation and my party of 3 only waited 10 minutes. They told us to expect a 30 minute wait and sent us to the bar next door, but they're probably just trying to get you to buy a $10 drink, I say skip it and sit on the benches for free. Also, there's a mandatory $5 valet fee (but it's totally worth it to eat here!)."}, {"review_id": "4uoMKitH_dDyG72yDERtHQ", "user_id": "IgDW1-6pNqp_TKWSaYccGg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "I'm so embarrassed that it took me so long to come to Pizzeria Bianco... And I lived for a whole year within walking distance of it! My boyfriend's dad insisted we go when he came to visit for the weekend (since he loved it last time when he visited a year ago), and I'm so so glad we did. The house salad was fresh but nothing special. I will say that the olives were the least objectionable green olives I've ever had. Now to the pizza... it was SO GOOD. And I'm not even really a pizza person. It was crunchy and chewy all at the same time. I got the Wise Guy, s/o got the Margherita, and his dad got the Sonny Boy. All of these pizzas were delectable. I thought mine was the best. Although I'm not typically a white pizza (no tomato sauce) kind of person, I thought that the lack of sauce gave my pizza a greater depth of flavor. I got to enjoy the fired taste of the crust, the sweetness of the onions, and the magic of the fennel sausage.

They have valet parking for $5. They send you a text with a link that tells you your place in line so you can walk around while you wait.I always prefer thinner crust over thicker crust but there's also a chance that the pizza crust burns if it's even cooked a little bit longer. Our pizzas were a bit burnt but it wasn't too bad.WISEGUY ($19) - One of their most popular pizzas. It does not have sauce in it which makes it really interesting. I love the crunchiness of the onion and then the random sausage when I bite into it. I think I would've preferred if the sausage and onion pieces were smaller and more spread out so I can take a little bit of each in every bite. It's a different kind of pizza than you're probably used to. 4/5SONNY BOY ($19) - Another issue about thinner pizzas is that with sauce the pizza itself may be soggy. That's how it was like with this so it was a little flimsy to grab. It was still really good though since I love meat. 4/5Overall, a good place to stop by and grab a pizza as it's close to a lot of attractions like the Arizona Science Center and Heritage Square."}, {"review_id": "m8dvqLRryjo0Obz2PWYVAQ", "user_id": "_5cskuF6D4V9ipUFO6PQKQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "We got here around 1PM on a Saturday afternoon.

We walked around the whole block because it was the Heritage Square and our wait being a little less than half an hour, thank the pizza gods!! I got the wiseguy and the bf got the sonny boy. The sever will tell but note that the wiseguy does NOT have sauce. I still liked it better than the sonny boy because for me it was a little too saucy. The taste of the sausage was prominent in each bite. I really wished that they cut the onions in smaller pieces so that I could have it in every bite rather than one long string that is gone way too soon. All in all, I'd recommend it if you've got a hankering for pizza.

Given flight options for a return trip from an Ironman competition in Cabo San Lucas, I chose a five hour layover in Phoenix to be able to knock this one off of the list.I opted to sit at the bar and was treated to a hypnotic view of the innards of their famous wood fire oven. As a first timer, I thought it was only fitting to go for the classic margherita pizza. The crust is probably the most perfectly crisp that I've ever had in a neapolitan, and the basil was perfectly sweet (as proper basil should be). Did I finish an entire pizza in one sitting? You bet.So, is it the best pizza in the country? Having been to both Pizzeria Beddia in Philadelphia and now here, I can still honestly say that Pizzeria Beddia ruined pizza for me, and that Bianco is second to it for my palate (although they're two very different styles of pizza). I've yet to go to Tony's in SF or Difara's in NYC, but I'll be going to the former next month and the latter hopefully next year. Until then, Beddia still reigns king in my book."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-bianco-phoenix?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
