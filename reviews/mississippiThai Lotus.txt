In , they took 15 minutes to bring out my water with lemon and coffee. I tried to order egg rolls and apparently they were out?? Which struck me as very odd because you would think that restaurants would always be equipped with their most popular appetizer? The food was alright.  I ordered the meatball pho. The broth was delicious and the portion was good. I am giving it 2 stars mainly because of the delay in service and lack of friendliness. The food was decent but I will not be coming back to this place."}, {"review_id": "ef2xyw7LWMKOPirWE42w9w", "user_id": "ks31SVO_aQyeM6hO5sbl4Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Barely any chicken in $13.95 Pad See Ew.

I visited this restaurant when I first arrived in Gulfport and I was really excited about having found a Thai restaurant. I want to give this place zero stars, but this app won't let me continue unless I provide a rating. This was my experience: I entered this hole-in-the wall and sat in one of the booths. I won't comment on service because in my experience you get what you get in places like this. I ordered the chicken green curry which was on their lunch menu and a Sprite. While I waited I observed the server bringing some dishes to the people next to me. Before he served them the food, however, he grabbed a spoon and scooped something out of one of the bowls and put it in a paper napkin. I was curious, but I didn't investigate. In retrospect, I should have. Red flag # 1. When my food arrived, I noticed that my green curry looked...well...artificial in color, like a neon green. Red flag #2. I don't shy away from food so I decided to give it a shot. The flavor was good, despite the strange color. And here is where things go south: I stirred the curry a little bit and noticed an odd ingredient I had not seen in curry before. I scooped it out with the spoon and realized that it was a human hair!  Red flag #3 and done! I brought this up to the server and he was very apologetic and said they would make a new one. I didn't want to chance another surprise, so I politely said I would pay for the Sprite and be on my way. The owner (I think) stopped by and was also apologetic and said she would make another dish for me. I politely said no thank you and that I would gladly pay for the Sprite and be on my way. She said that I could have the Sprite for free. I walked out of there with my mouth burning from the curry and nauseous. I won't be going to this place ever again. It's a real shame."}, {"review_id": "-CqBD79PdbrMdKvNZnvidQ", "user_id": "tu95-0iX4AxoFh5TtfAHgA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/20/2016", "text": "As others have said, the food is amazing, but the service not so much.I ordered the Pad Thai and Thai Iced tea while my girlfriend had a beef broth soup with shrimp. I enjoyed the meal greatly, and the beef broth soup was wonderful, as far as soups can go.The inside was nothing worth writing about. No one showed us to our seats, the staff sat in the eating area with customers and folded napkins and on at least three occasions played loud games on their phone. Half the time we were waited on by a chef rather than the waiter, who was not busy -there were all of three tables filled, including ours. This is all not to say it was a bad experience. The food was really great, and not overpriced. I definitely see myself ordering from them in the future - just those orders will be for take out, not dine in."}, {"review_id": "NseV-UDgqbwIgPZfgqvnNw", "user_id": "1L_ndOLgUhfR-ewud_-3jQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/7/2015", "text": "Thai Lotus has the best food on the coast! Easily my favorite place to eat. Service is great, I love the server (Nha) he keeps you laughing in between your meal. Anne is so sweet, she would do anything just to make sure you are having a wonderful experience. They all remember what meals you like and how you like it. If you like extra lime or extra sauce with your entree it won't be long until you find yourself not having to ask for it.  The Pho is made fresh and especially careful. You will notice that the broth has no fat or fat oils in it, unlike many do at other restaurants. Maybe that's why some people may find it a little different tasting, because it is a healthier made soup. Some dishes I would recommend are the spring rolls, chicken satay, fried rice with steak cubes (comes with homemade sweet soy sauce), Pho Dac Biet, Special Thai Salad, Singapore noodles, pad see ew, and panang curry (pineapples!)."}, {"review_id": "jjdY4QmWTw9BkE3uboGz_A", "user_id": "bu6PNC8tsd8433h1qGZ0hA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/3/2017", "text": "We've been to this restaurant many times.

Today the service was just plain awful. There's one guy running around trying to serve everybody and not doing a very good job of it.
