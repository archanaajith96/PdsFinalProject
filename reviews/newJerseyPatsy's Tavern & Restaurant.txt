We grew up in Pateson and never knew about this palce. Sure, we have old school places like Ralph piccolo's on Uinion Ave but nothing like this Pizza place with a full bar. Ths place is old. The bathroom is tiny and you can pee in a trough filled with ice.  The old wood siding and Christmas lights reminds me where a noir movie. There are really small benches from abck in the day where America's obesity rate was not as high. That's why me and my buddies opted to sit at a large table. Carlos who was working the abr introduced himself and welcomed us. He said more and more new people are trying this place. Mainly due to show I assume. He suggested we get the mussels and a pizza. You can dip your pizza on the mussel sauce. Rookie mistake.We shared a large pie with sausage and onion and a baked ziti with meatballs. The ziti also came with bread and a side salad (iceberg lettuce and onions). The ziti tasted very homemade. Not a chef's inspired deconstructed crap food network and hipsters are doing now. My friend kept saying 'I usually don't like pizza this is different and I like'. He kept muttering that phrase for a good 5mins and even to one of the waitress, The pizza has a very crispy dough which created a handle. The slice was dropping a little becasue of the toppings. I liked the pizza as well because it wasn't as greasy pizza usually is.  Cash only.

I Won't Let You Go!The neighborhood is holding on, as the previous generation's Italians move out and the ruffians move in. And the bar is never open past 10pm, which seems sensible. It's family run, with the restaurant area operating on and off throughout history. Now headed by 2 brothers of their third generation, it's a relic, a throwback, and a destination. They do a 2-step cooking method for pies, first in a pan for 12 minutes, then in the original 1931 oven to finish it off. It basically fries the dough in the pan, then bakes the rise. It's the same way they cook at Star Tavern, which leads to an overly crispy and scrumptious crust. It's beauty on a disc.This brings up a factoid I learned from Scott of Scott's Pizza Tours... After prohibition, many drinking establishments opened up, and because it was a highly Italian region, pizza seemed like a natural thing to accompany beer. It's one of the best things to come out of that terrible time in our nation's history.Patsy's crust is extremely memorable. The char on the crust rolls all the way over and into the pie. Lots of times I talk about the coastline of a pie, likening the area where the cheese and sauce meet the end crust to where the water hits the sand on a beach. This one was like the wave barreling onto the beach, curling over the end back into the cheese and sauce. It's a polarizing slice, and I love it for that.And to answer your question about the name, Patsy's: no relation.Opened: 1931Distinction: Notes: Save room for Guernsey Ice Cream (134 19th Ave)"}, {"review_id": "ZQZiTb5LRVjbEtzxLFtnIw", "user_id": "QIheGr-6hcm-H-2d8G_dqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/13/2017", "text": "Absolutely the best top 3 best pizza in nj maybe the best with out question the crispiest I ever have in my life all the way to the last bite chatted with owner Steve an true gentleman I would refer anyone in the world to go and try a pie."}, {"review_id": "CFqLxtbgWnqt5zitKdXxzA", "user_id": "gXJiKViIYeyWVKKtQJV1Lg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/17/2017", "text": "Love this place.  It's truly a hidden gem.

Reason is because my father's been going there since my grandparents first took him when he was 7 in 1942. Little has changed since then, decor wise. They never bothered to renovate anything at all. Same dingy old tiny booths, same cheap beer signs and grungy curtains. And while some may take exception with this, it provides with a degree of comfort that no other restaurant seems to have. The pizza and all of their food is consistently excellent, service attentive and birch beer, rich and creamy. I remember playing basketball in the back with Steve and Gary when we were kids while Ralph and Marilyn manned the kitchen. Now it's the sons'  turn and it's always great to see them. Patsy's is home for me. I remember being 9 or 10 years old in the back seat of my father's Oldsmobile arguing with my sister about where to go. I always wanted Patsy's, she preferred Chinese and I usually won. Ha, ha Jennifer.  The fortunate thing for anyone reading this its that it's never too late to start a tradition, especially where family's concerned. Sure, the neighborhood is questionable, but you'll be fine and go enjoy what my family and I have for many, many years.

Last night 5 of us went to Patsy's for a family member's bday. I hadn't been there in probably 15 years so I didn't remember the food.We started off with the rice balls, mozzarella sticks, and sauteed broccoli rabe with garlic. Rice balls are a must! They are huge! I split one with one of my family members. The mozzarella sticks were crispy and not soggy and the broccoli rabe was very flavorful. It wasn't served bitter like at most places. As others stated, the bread is not served warm, but we didn't care. We are not that picky.We ordered a large plain pizza (all I had was pizza) and the other 4 ordered dinners in addition to the pizza. Probably the best pizza I have had. I like pizza well done and this was super crispy. You know when you normally hold up a slice, it will droop down and it will leak oil? Not Patsy's pizza. No drooping, not oily and so crunchy. I loved it! Most of my family members brought the rest of their dinner home. Our waitress, Carolina (I think that was her name) was awesome. Very friendly and outgoing and fit right in with us. She even brought out a cup of ice cream with whipped cream and a candle for my relative and everyone sang happy birthday.From the outside it looks like a dive bar and when you step inside, it's just an old world Italian place that has been there probably about 40+ years. Good food, good staff, good time.1 Negative - They don't accept credit or debit.
