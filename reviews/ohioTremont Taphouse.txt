The bar was pretty full so we grabbed a booth. The draft selection is impressive, including the house brews (Butcher & Brewer). We ordered the house brew kolsch and farmhouse ales (I loved the farmhouse ale!). They also have a rotating daily $4 brew. We shared some small plates for lunch, including the calamari (based on a review on here), poutine, and pierogi. All of which were delicious and more food than i needed for lunch. A very cool atmosphere and friendly staff. They had easy parking and what looks like a nice patio; we'll be back in the warm weather!"}, {"review_id": "sNxuYh2YWGdSL0IFe7Zgow", "user_id": "F0Hkb9Ghelcr0EwUwjllxw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "I had never been here for brunch before and am so happy my friends decided that we'd check it out! We got there around 10:30 and it wasn't that busy from what I could see (they have the bar area and then an upstairs, which I never saw). I was immediately sat and was greeted by our very friendly server. Since we were there before 11 on a Sunday, we weren't able to get the Bloody Mary's but they DID have mimosas readily available. One thing to note: their mimosas are made with a cider and OJ, not champagne...still very delicious! Also, one of the girls I was with did end up getting the Bloody Mary after 11 and said it was spicy! It's also made with the Effen Cucumber vodka. Onto the food: SO GOOD. I opted for one of the omelettes: goat cheese, wild mushrooms and fresh herbs with a side of the potato hash (really just diced roasted delicious potatoes). One of my friends got the buttermilk pancakes (came with a bowl of fruit) and a side of the Butcher and Brewer bacon. The other got the eggs benedict, which also came with the potato hash. We all loved our meals and thought it was one of the better ones that we've been to."}, {"review_id": "yvadBtmsnpf1aa2pvKx4sw", "user_id": "euOQNSt5T4pfy6LaZn-XSA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/1/2017", "text": "The calamari is the best in cleveland!!  You would never expect it from a bar, but this stuff is amazing!I've had it several times and its always well cooked (not chewy), perfectly crispy with amazing breading, and topped with an amazing sauce!  Can't be beat!Also, the beer selection is great, salads are fresh and everything else I have seen has always been raved about.  Gotta try the burgers too!  Top it with an over easy egg!  YUM!This isn't just your average bar with average bar food!  Great drinks and great food at reasonable prices, and the staff is ALWAYS friendly!  Definitely a great place just outside all the hustle and bustle of professor ave in tremont!"}, {"review_id": "vwS0fGZjvstfNF2bWMpeiw", "user_id": "haT-IuuJcLbpTuG_tqwn_w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "We were looking for somewhere special for my husband to untap his 500th beer on Untapped, and we certainly found the spot! Staff is very beer-knowledgeable, and the beer list is probably the most extensive one in Cleveland. Since the breakthrough 500th beer, we visited again and sat downstairs, enjoying the nachos as an appetizer before ordering dinner elsewhere. All in all, a fun and local place to try new beers or enjoy some classy craft favorites."}, {"review_id": "rIrF8C1SCOLG84YYgD1xYA", "user_id": "5SYD87gd4-7f4YHs1UZaYA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "We had dinner here on a Tuesday night. For a small kitchen staff they put out a variety of food. I had the salmon BLT, all to order. Very good. My friends had the portabello pasta (veg) and the Irish the tacos.

The food is really good as well. What's an amazing thing that Tremont Taphouse has that no one else can really offer then the area? Well there's two things: parking lot and large patio. They use the patio to their advantage by being dog friendly and hosting 'yappy hours' for your pooch on the patio. The last time I was there they had a dog meetup/fundraiser for Huskys. Tremont wins in my book already.In addition to those perks the food is also amazing. Each month/week they have a featured pizza and grilled cheese. The last time I went I got the Pierogis and was not disappointed. Sautéed and fried to perfection covered in a sour cream sauce with grilled onions! Yum! The beer list is always revolving with it's seasonal changes as well.Everyone who works there is super nice and attentive. Always willing to help out and make sure your experience is the best.  Give Taphouse a try, I'm sure you won't be disappointed!"}, {"review_id": "TYUYMMb01HX11wZ1UDiqeA", "user_id": "gwFpSEGAQHEiv9rYyh_1kA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Outstanding. I had the house salad and a side of Mac and cheese, both were full of flavor and well executed. The salad was simple but truly one of the best salads I've had. Mac had the perfect amount of cheese and had a really great texture, not too thick, not grainy like some can get and definitely not dry. Overall really happy with everything.

Another tremont happy hour. Not happy hour prices but the burger was delicious. Anyone can make a manhattan and pour a beer.

Great food and an amazing beer selection with really good vibes to watch sports on TV . The only part I didn't like was the happy hour wasn't a great deal.
