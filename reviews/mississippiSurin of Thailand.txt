One of my favorite place to eat in Jackson. It's very close to university of Mississippi medical center. Ample parking. Large menu to pick from. Price is $$. Fast service. Satay well marinated. Large portion of Karbala chicken, three people could share. Like Tiger cry , the sauce is awesome. Bring your appetite. You will not be disappointed. Today I tried mixed seafood, great! I had mixed seafood today, love it"}, {"review_id": "v-d_1dOamYZQ0FmoCgKlTw", "user_id": "gHDsdNl0XKrMnitprNnIuA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "This was my first time visiting Surin and we visited at lunch time. They were very accommodating because I didn't know that they closed at 2.. This will probably be my new favorite restaurant!Name of Restaurant:  Surin of ThailandOverall rating (1-5, 5 being highest):  5Atmosphere: 5Upon arriving in the parking lot it didnt look like much was going on. I actually almost missed it because the sign needs to be a tad larger, especially in print.I didn't expect it to be as nice as it was especially with the other Thai restaurants I've visited in the area.  The decor is modern and although not really Asian-y it was Asian-esque if that makes any sense..lol. I hate all public restrooms so this part is important to me. In short, they have clean, well-stocked restrooms (at least on the ladies side). My most favorite part is the step attachment on the bottom of the door = you don't have to open the door with your hand. \"Look Ma. No hands!!\" Lol. Service: 5Omar was great. Very prompy, kept table clean and checked on us regularly. I'll ask for him again next time. For some reason they don't put non-alcoholic drink options on the menu so I assume they don't serve Thai tea or coffee. I never bothered to ask..it was just something I noticed.Food: 4Appetizers:Chicken Satay: The chicken was very tender and I always love the pickled cucumbers. The peanut sauce was made just right with a good peanut and tangy ratio.Namosod: OMG, if you love pork lettuce wraps filling, you'll love this. However its served with cabbage leaves. The crunch of the fresh cabbage with the pork filling is so divine. It's such a large serving that it could easily be eaten as a meal. It appears spicy with the visible red peppers but it's mild...but then again I love spicy so my tolerance is high. It has actual peanuts as am FYI. Thai Coconut Soup: it is served with the lunch special. It had bits of tofu and two mushrooms. The broth was flavorful with a hint of coconut. I could drink the whole pot if they'd let me.Main Course: Quick Note: After almost finishing my entire lunch visit, I noticed that the entire time something was lacking and I had figured it out -- the dishes lacked that signature Thai basil aroma and flavors. There wasn't any really present. I requested a side of fresh Thai basil and it made a world of difference in all of my food. Chicken Noodle Bowl: If you love coconut in entrees you'll love this. The chicken strips were  tender and is very very sauccyyyyy. It looks like soup when it first arrives. Just a tad spicy kick to give it a fragrant aroma. Nom nom nom.  I ate the leftovers for breakfast so it was even more delicious. Lots of noodles left over.Spicy Beef Salad: This was my most exciting meal that I was looking forward to but also the most disappointing. The dish lacked the kaffir or regular lime flavors. It really wasn't what my taste buds expected. A little mint or my fave, basil, would have also made it delicious.  Although it says it's spicy..it wasn't really that spicy to me. Will you dine there again? Definitely"}, {"review_id": "w452t4tOPa8U-Edy0VrNyA", "user_id": "n2MQ7KzkRf73NBSNleQoyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I ordered lunch with a group from work last week and it was SO GOOD. We used the Waitr group order option which allowed us each to pay and tip separately for one delivery fee. I ordered the spicy green curry dish, but had to request to swap the shrimp with chicken since there was no existing option for that combo. It was delicious! It was so fresh and had the perfect amount of spice.

Let me start off by saying the food was pretty good. We both had a few of their maki rolls as an appetizer, I had pad Thai, and she had vegetable stir fry. All the food met expectations, could've been slightly better to meet their higher class ambience. The service could've been much better. Our server was nice, but communicated very poorly. I had to ask him to repeat himself several times because he was talking so fast. Then we weren't informed that our Groupon would not cover the happy hour discounts for sushi until after we ordered. After we received our check and used our Groupon, another person  walked up and asked to see my phone tomake sure the Groupon was used. I told him our server just used it, but this person insisted on looking at my phone to make sure it was redeemed. As if i wasn't being honest. It was slightly frustrating, but was alright in the end. Overall, it was just an okay experience, so I'm not sure if I'll return."}, {"review_id": "olTBSfghUKdpcF7HwFnr4w", "user_id": "-V8pi8gXQBof891VkIyZug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2017", "text": "For starters a cup of Thai coconut soup.

I came in for my birthday lunch with my Dad. He had the red duck curry and I had the pork dish. I know he loves the duck curry, because it's his second time ordering it. Personally, it's a little sweet for my taste. Our waitress was very friendly. I like the pork dish (can't remember the name). I had ordered the yummy yummy roll as an appetizer. The timing was off, and it didn't come out until after we had our food. The food did come out really fast though. And the lunch portion was still more than enough. I love that they give you some cucumber and seaweed salad with the sushi roll. Our waitress also brought us some extra rice. I'll keep going back. It's good food and a great location."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/surin-of-thailand-jackson?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
