We went there after the Lions game so there was a pretty good crowd there so we sat at the bar. Our waiter was super nice and very tentative. The inside was so cool. I think it would be perfect for a little date night but I would literally go for any occasion without reason lol! They have an endless selection of beer and wine and the prices were more than reasonable.Now let's get to the food....holy hell...hands down THE BEST FOOD IN DETROIT. Possibly the world lol. I highly recommend trying the Barret sandwich. You won't regret it. And the pulled pork chili was bomb! Just go. Do it. It's the best!"}, {"review_id": "C82qpO0StCPh-RknBxDyUg", "user_id": "ZtvjGRltONe4N3MePpyWrA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "It's like a little gem in the forest that is corktown detroit. You'd never really know but the outside that there is an I credible sandwich place inside. The place is broken up into maybe three houses or areas. There is a bar style and window style seating upon entry. Then you will be walked thru the kitchen area which is more of a deli stand. There is NO fryer here, which is rather refreshing. In the back area our group of 7 was seated. It's definitely not the best place to go with large groups. It was popping during lunch time. Even though there is an extensive menu of options, I created by own lavash wrap with a variety of grilled veggies. Our group shared this insanely delicious waffle that was on special. Good solid spot for a consistently good meal. Classic."}, {"review_id": "kWoIHQwQkFBW7xoN3JzLcA", "user_id": "Ha3jHuU_XrlUmdpJm4QZUA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "A friend recommended this place, I am no longer friends with this friend. Kidding. However I was thoroughly disappointed. To start we ordered soup, and the pretzels with beer cheese. Both the creamy chicken asparagus and the chicken noodle soups were great. The beer cheese and pretzels...not so good. The pretzels could've easily been purchased at Meijer's and the beer cheese was served cold. That's I guess how it's supposed to be. I just was not a fan. I ordered the half Pressly sandwich and bowl of chicken noodle soup. I got the sandwich without coleslaw and thousands island on wheat. It came out with thousand island, coleslaw and on rye. Once I got the right sandwich, It was delicious. Just disappointed with the beer cheese and pretzels and service. Won't be back. It's a fun quirky restaurant, and I was hopeful, yet disappointed.Update! Greg the owner reached out after my experience and wanted a chance to make it right. However, I'm back in California and completely respect that. Thanks Greg, that goes a long way in my book, so I've updated my star rating to a 4 star. I'm sure my second visit would've been better. Again, the sandwich and soup were good, I just didn't care for the pretzels and service! Hope you have a good experience."}, {"review_id": "apHkAiVFh8CesJOoXeBGzQ", "user_id": "KrQWRX52RtRA66gF1zrW8A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "I've eaten here four times and enjoyed it each time.The food is prepared well, the buns are great and the service is always very, very good.

It's very easy to get to and lots of street parking located all around. There's usually not a wait unless it's sacred \"Lobster Week\", then you probably already know you're in for a long wait. They have lots of veggie options so that's always a plus! I love having options to choose from but then again who doesn't. Most of their sandwiches are very delish like their veggie Reuben and the \"Tempeh of Doom\" sandwich. It's this huge tasty tempeh creation with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and a avocado spread. I like to add mustard to it, to spice it up a little bit but it's huge and delicious and I've never been able to finish the whole sandwich in one sitting. Yea, it's that big haha!"}, {"review_id": "xa5bArYBoEosEvH8tBGMYA", "user_id": "reOsjVoPYkAQyVVau2crFg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "We sat at the bar, since there was a 15 minute wait for a table. I sat by the pillar and made the best of it. I settled on the tempeh Reuben since I have craving it all week, sounded right up my alley. I also ordered the Redskin potato salad, a favorite of mine here. My boyfriend was a newbie and ordered the southwest wrap sandwich and chips and salsa. He also ordered a porter beer. It was a Java porter, he didn't like it and it wasn't his thing. He was a little disappointed in the chips and salsa. The chips tasted like it came out of the bag and the salsa tasted like it came out of a jar. My tempeh was okay, the best part of my sandwich was the gf bread and the kraut and dressing. My BF said his Southwest wrap was just OK."}, {"review_id": "2GlHzNjO3Xm9Du9nUqavdg", "user_id": "lVIkzkJJQqdp3h2bG_0dhQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "I was excited to try Mudgie's after seeing all of the great reviews and mentions on several Detroit lists for best restaurants in the area. Despite service and food being good, it just wasn't my cup of tea.I found the food overpriced for what we ended up getting. After tip, we spent $45 on a couple sandwiches and a bowl of soup. I was also expected my sandwich to be served warm/hot, but instead of got the opposite. It also took a long time to get our bill as the restaurant started to get busy.I built my own sandwich with chicken, bacon, sharp cheddar, and buttemrilk ranch on a whole wheat flatbread (which, to Mudgie's, is actually a wrap). It had a nice kick to it which I'm guessing came from the chicken.Again, the food is good, the service was nice, but I won't be back due to the price compared to what is served."}, {"review_id": "En5iwDZS-zWUow_tD7gSvA", "user_id": "ChVzzjR8Q_hOwHXbLjGZ6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "For starters for a getting sandwiches and soup our bill was quite high, but we enjoyed or food very much.  The soup was delicious, and i wasnt expecting to love it so much.  I did a build your own wrap and it was again delicious and will likely continue to do build your own sandwiches as there are no substitions on their signature sandwiches.  Loved the vibe of the place though and the service was good.  I thought it took a little longer then expected for just sandwiches.  Next time we go I will likely try to do a meal deal option, I saw that you could do a half sandwich and a cup of soup, so hopefully that will reduce the bill some"}, {"review_id": "d3g1ucvBdfdnj2-rc3zp4Q", "user_id": "oj5TSQ1EH9hJvWRRLfJGmg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/18/2017", "text": "One of the staples in Corktown if you ask me.

The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because our service was terrible. This place has such a cute vibe to it, specifically on their patio which even has a tiki bar. There are quite a variety of deli selections & it is really hard to choose a sandwich. I went with the \"Jerk\" sandwich, which was amazing! Roasted chicken, pepper jack cheese, onions, lettuce & jerk mayo served warm on an onion roll. It was unbelievable! All sandwiches come with a pickle but I really didn't care for it. I love that this place makes everything from scratch & it definitely shows. Highly recommend as a lunch spot if you're downtown or near the Wayne State University campus.

We had to drive from DIA as it is a ways away. Parking on street was plentiful and free. The building is an old neighborhood grocery store and they have photo of the original owners hanging in the restaurant. The restaurant is now an assembly of several prior buildings and has a lot of character. We all ordered different sandwiches and everything was excellent. I really like a pastrami and corned beef mixed together and they accommodated it perfectly. We shared a few sides as well as some Better Made chips. It is a little noisy and somewhat tight but we left very very happy we had made the stop. Dana our waitress was excellent and knowing we were first timers went through the extensive menu.

Had no trouble seating our large group but less than 20 min later it got packed. Food took over 35 minutes to come out (a lot of the smaller tables got served even though they came after us). Everyone's meals looked delectable but my orzo salad was too bland. It was a special menu item (seems like they switch it weekly) for only $4. I also got the Tempeh of Doom. Pretty big portion that I happily took home. Little dry. Wish they gave more of the roasted red pepper sauce but delicious none the less. Can't wait for the patio to open (very vague timing of when it would open...'a couple days after it gets warmer' but that's Michigan for ya). Next time I'll stick with their more flavorful options like the smoked salmon reuben. The atmosphere inside was a bit indie, playing rage against the machine and then red hot chili peppers. Can get pretty noisy too."}, {"review_id": "vV8RY6CHaT2GcQCi1p73HA", "user_id": "A4kmdtFI4L9NUQGl7ybO3A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/19/2017", "text": "Mudgie's provides a great place to sit on a patio in warm weather, have a good beer or cocktail, and enjoy some of the best sandwiches Detroit has to offer.
