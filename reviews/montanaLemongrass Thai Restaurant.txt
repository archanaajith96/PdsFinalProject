And I'm from Seattle, where there is no end of quality Asian fare of all types and varieties. Also I'm Asian myself for what it's worth...But stopped here while in town for business. After a long drive north from southern WY, yelp led me here,  the only appealing place near my hotel (a nice new HIE)No lie. Likley the best drunken noodles I've ever had. Ever. Fresh, fresh basil and peppers, perfectly cooked noodles, unbelievably flavorful sauce. Fried tofu as my protein,  perfectly cooked,  crisp.Mango sweet rice 'cause why not. Delicious.Truly worth every $"}, {"review_id": "e2PrnXI2ChUUU7uBUo54vw", "user_id": "EQAsIwOtxV9RAUtaV9vm2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/21/2017", "text": "I *love* Lemongrass Thai Restaurant. My family and I typically order the massaman curry, pineapple fried rice, pad thai and mango sticky rice. A few weeks ago, I tried the tom kha gai soup (which was awesome) and the green curry (very flavorful but really spicy!). I've tried other Thai restaurants in the Billings area but this one is the best. I crave their massaman curry. The service is also really good. I can't believe how well the server multitasks while being extremely warm and friendly (she must be the daughter of the owner). She's very efficient. We've never had a bad experience here. If we have out-of-town guests, this is where we would take them. It's one of our favorite places to eat!"}, {"review_id": "1IzIP4mSsXbwbptcgn5iIQ", "user_id": "8lCKHndlvFisCn97RsKb5w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/19/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "True Thai food that is season and cooked to perfection.

I have to say, those who had less than a stellar experience must've been in the Twilight Zone, because our experience was great!First, when you walk in, you are welcomed by the smell of lemongrass and Thai spices! Already off to a good start!We were seated promptly, and my husband ordered a Thai iced tea, and based off the suggestion of another reviewer, I had the ginger tea (iced). Heaven! The Thai iced tea is what you would expect--thick, sweet, and spicy. The ginger tea had a great bite and was not overly sweet. Although it is probably only for true ginger lovers.We got an appetizer of the fried spring rolls. They were exactly what you'd expect, and are probably a frozen product from a distributor, but they were still good!I got the Tom Kha soup for my meal, which is my favorite in any Thai restaurant (I mean, I will order it if it's 100 out!). This one was a little different than the ones I've had before--it was thick and creamy from loads of coconut milk, and it was PACKED with mushrooms, onions, lemongrass, and chicken. Many of the other ones I've had are very brothy with not a lot of the good stuff in there. Also, it had the perfect amount of heat, even though it's not sold as a spicy dish (they didn't ask about my spice level like they do at most Thai places, and I didn't say, but I didn't need to). I had leftovers, which made me super excited!My husband ordered a lunch special (contrary to another review, they did give us a lunch menu), and the name of the dish escapes me now, but it was chicken with peppers and onions. He asked for it extra hot, and he was not disappointed! His frequent complaint about our local Thai joint is that their \"5\" is too mild. He said this place got it just right, and that he could still taste the flavors of the food in spite of the heat!Our server was super nice! Although it got pretty crowded and she was the only one on the floor, we never had to wait for a refill!Regarding price...we are from Spokane, WA, and found the prices to be average compared to our local Thai restaurants. The egg rolls were about $9 (for 3), my soup was $15, his entree was $13, and our drinks were like $2-3 each, even though they're specialty drinks. Perhaps those who thought it was expensive don't have another frame of reference. We will definitely be back if we come back to town!"}, {"review_id": "aO41S1NnbCfqYrp-sosCWQ", "user_id": "zuE_e7dj6fR1ZKqujBlfKg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/13/2017", "text": "The food is so GOOD! I'd love to give it 5 stars and was hesitant to give it four because of the horrible service here. I've been here four times, hoping to give it more chances. Every time I visit, the service is poor! Excellent food. Priced slightly higher than other Thai spots, food is superior though in my opinion. Delicious Pad See Ew and Drunken Noodles. Nice and clean, lots of space. I hope the owner brings in a server who can offer friendly, attentive and happy customer service."}, {"review_id": "i9ofm2MHyvfkrmQKuVQJiQ", "user_id": "BdAB1yosGmxU6IwV37sPmw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2016", "text": "Love this place.Customer service could be the best in town and it's all done by one gal. Of which I can't remember her name. But seriously pro!!Mom makes food in the back, daughter up front, other staff work to support these two. They're amazing. They run a tight ship and if you are at all dissatisfied--of which I have never been--you just mention what you need and it's taken care of. I really enjoy the Panang Beef, the massaman, and some sort of basil Thai dish. Lovely vegetables, fresh and great quality. Atmosphere welcoming and nice. Can be a quick in and out, or can linger over dinner. We've also gotten the Crab Rangoon and the Coconut Tom Yum soup I believe and it's awesome. The Thai tea is excellent as well.  Prices may have increased, but I don't care. It's too good. My mouth salivates as I think about all the tasty, wholesome dishes to be eaten here---I better go eat some lunch!!"}, {"review_id": "nC2tBay17q3AS5hQn-3Fjg", "user_id": "158DGIdKshGubbIgscx05Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/28/2017", "text": "Went once but it was great, I'll go again.

In town on business, read the reviews and this place didn't disappoint. It was a Tuesday and I was a \"table for 1\" and I still had about a 10 min wait but didn't mind because the chairs they have are possibly the most comfortable chairs you'll ever sit in. In fact I feel bad for those who don't have to wait, that's how comfy they are. Now on to the food. I had the fresh spring rolls and when they came out the girl apologized because she made them a little too big.... As in too much of the goodness inside. Who does that!?Also got the Panaang Curry, it was incredible. Perfect amount for one person, only thing I would have done is spice it up a bit. She told me it was prepared medium heat, some Thai medium is very spicy so I elected to stick with it.... Next time I'll take it up a bit.

We had tom yum soup with shrimp, panang curry with chicken, drunken noodle with pork. The shrimp were large and good quality.  The food was quite spicy, but we were warned. We like it that way so it was great.  The dishes had plenty of lemon grass and kaffir lime leaves where appropriate, something often missing from Americanized Thai food to save money.  Everything was delicious and the service was super friendly and welcoming even though we were the last table of the evening.  I have no complaints about our dining experience.
