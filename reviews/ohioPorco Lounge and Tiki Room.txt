The decor is that of a tiki bar and I love to come here as a date spot or a small gathering with friends. I use it more as a venue for drinks before or after dinner. Each time I've come to Porco's it has been pretty crowded and often rather loud, so keep that in mind. I've never had their food. They have a small menu but I've come a handful of time for the real selling point, their drinks! Each of their cocktails I've had runs about $10-13 and the tab will run up quick. Fortunately, their drinks can be really strong and they're all really tasty. Some even have a limit on how many you can get in a night. My favorite drink, the Zombie, only allows two per person. Luckily I only need one to start feeling it! Their drinks often come with fruit garnishes, umbrellas, or dry ice for a smoky effect. It really makes the experience that much more awesome."}, {"review_id": "otnGpV7SiTUbp9QutlqLYA", "user_id": "CP-NXrlvfw3ndwvjfwIY0w", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/3/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "WHERE IN THE BLOODY HELL ARE THE NACHOS. My previous drinks review still stands. Though I wrote it based on my 2015-2016 relationship with them. Sadly my year long hiatus resulted in a facelift unbeknownst to me.In reference to my most recent trip a week ago: Though I don't like the changes to the happy hour drink menu... they still are delicious strong and unique drinks.But for the love of God bring back the nachos... and your funky hole in the wall, secret Cleveland tiki room ambiance. The changes made it all too mediocre. Fine, get rid of the creepy hallway with the wine cork screen and make a waiting area for all the hipsters and cool rich 50+ crowd... but the waitress had the audacity to say \"with the renovation it would be a shame to serve people some chips with cheese thrown on it, we now have a full kitchen and chef\"How dare you. We tried 3 meatball dishes and the personal pizza square. It was so uneventful. The Nachos were graded top in the city! We literally came for the nachos. Please for the love of God bring them back,  your meatballs are idiotic."}, {"review_id": "ZycqFesCRZRLA1oofOlN0g", "user_id": "mOv9mR5JYbWjvB8o9b7NUA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "Porco Lounge is such a fun experience! Who doesn't love getting a drink served to you as it is smoking? So cool! Not only do most of the drinks smoke, but they also are served with mint leaves and a slice of fruit (or whatever accent suites your drink) and they all come with a fun plastic character (monkey, mermaid, etc.) which you can see in my picture!All of the drink names are unique. I got a \"Suffering Bastard\" which is basically their equivalent of a Moscow Mule. Each drink has different tiers depending on how much alcohol they put in it. So the next tier after the \"Suffering Bastard\" is the \"Dead Bastard.\"Because all of the drinks have exotic names and don't sound like familiar, the staff asks you what you normally order to drink and suggests drinks that are similar. Thats how I ended up with the Suffering Bastard and I was very pleased with it!! The drinks are pretty pricey (all at least $10) but they are pretty big and definitely will get you feeling some type of way- ha!I have not had food there, but there are lots of tables and booths to sit and eat. From my experience, the drinks are definitely what draws the crowd but I've heard good things about the food. Upon pulling up to Porco it does not look like a very inviting place, but I would definitely recommend going there for a unique and fun experience!"}, {"review_id": "P9uqlDKR2CVuj7JIPQr8jw", "user_id": "Nag61x7xZMRvVtXDw9ADjQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Freezing your ass off in our miserable Cleveland winters? Come to Porco and get a tropical drink that will (hopefully) bring back memories of warmer times.Atmosphere definitely gives off the tiki room vibe, but it is a small place! I saw many reserved tables and felt stupid not making one myself when I saw how packed it was at 6pm. Even then, we still got a table after 10 minutes. In warmer months they also have what looks to be a nice patio.Drinks here are DELICIOUS and fun. I was overwhelmed at the menu and the server suggested I get the Fog Cutter, which turned out to be delicious. Prices for drinks are going to be a bit higher here ($11-15 range) but you are paying for the novelty. Also... these drinks are STRONG so you will get your money's worth!Porco also offers small plates, mainly \"build your own balls\" meatballs and some other light snacks, which you'll need because the drinks will hit you fast."}, {"review_id": "NCGXqLeNf2nfgfK8R7TpvA", "user_id": "0HPh7XAC3E6Avo00vbx0iQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/27/2017", "text": "I came here on a Friday with a few friends for drinks. We had a great time overall. This place is a tiki bar and seems to take the theme quite seriously. Strong cup game.As far as the drinks I tried, I had the painkiller 3 and some other drink that I honesty can't remember. What I do remember, though, is that the drinks here were STRONG. And I don't mean strong like get you drunk (although they do that, yes.), but rather strong to the point where they're actually kind of unpleasant to drink. The alcohol taste overwhelms your senses in the strongest drinks here, so I would recommend in most cases, since some drinks have many \"levels\", getting the second highest level at maximum unless your sole purpose of coming is t obliterate yourself to the point of not being able to stand up.With all that said, I thought everything else about this place was great. I had a pickle plate as a small plate, which was lovely, and the staff were friendly. I'll probably come back, but I'll also probably choose my drinks more wisely next time!"}, {"review_id": "qa257O_ntcDudAWhWyXe6A", "user_id": "c30ou-QjV6vcjsFWeCMNTQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/22/2017", "text": "Porco's is definitely an awesome addition to the Ohio City area. While it's not in the main strip of bars and breweries such and Market Garden, TownHall, and NanoBrew, it's absolutely worth a stop! I came here a while back for drinks with some friends, but did not try any of the food (although I do hear they have some pretty awesome nachos). My friends and I decided to share a big bowl of a drink that I'm pretty sure had every liquor imaginable in it. It was very strong, but still tasty and (almost too) easy to drink. We stopped by later in the night, so the place was packed. However, I really want to try to come earlier to get a table and spend more time trying the different drinks they have to offer, as well as the food."}, {"review_id": "OkNTnAqz8rg3cHZ2hLg2sg", "user_id": "E546Hg-ecSD37DFMmZzq7A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "I wanted to write a lengthy, exciting review but then I started my second drunk and logic went out the window.

This is one of my favorite spots to acquire this in Cleveland. I passed by this unassuming place when I first moved to Cleveland and thought nothing of it. But when I finally took a trip inside it was a present surprise. The drink selection is very extensive and the overall theme itself inside the bar takes you to another location. Might be one of the top theme bars I've been too. One hint of advice, this place gets very busy on the weekend so getting there early is never a bad idea. Also it stays open pretty late so having to wait to get in isn't necessarily a bad choice either. Excellent Bar, food isn't bad, and theme overall makes this a high choice on my list of Cleveland spots for a quick drink or a night cap."}, {"review_id": "Tl5n_idFILRJ0v_QMaAVgQ", "user_id": "0geOCH93KVUzWI07QNVBrg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/21/2017", "text": "Had a brief visit (1 round) with buddies as we hopped around Cleveland last Saturday night.  Small parking lot but we took Uber.  There was a wait for tables (apparently this is a popular spot) but we scored 3 seats at the bar.  Had Mai tais which were $9 each.  Drink was well-made and potent.  Service took a bit but it was a crowded bar.  Also sampled 2 appetizers which were shareable and tasty.  Good environment for groups."}, {"review_id": "7CJ5V39IBj-jUsWg4s-hgg", "user_id": "AH3OZj4glpss6xXpOEHF7Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/11/2017", "text": "I finally made it to Porcos!!!!  I've heard such great things about the unique drinks and tropical decor at this place and it did not disappoint.  I stopped in after work on a Wednesday night, so I had no issue finding a parking spot in their tiny lot or finding a table to sit at inside.  The service was great.  When I mentioned I was newbie, I got the complete drink menu run down.  My powerful yet well balanced drink came out smoking in an awesomely themed glass.  I was good after one.  I have to go back again to taste the other fun looking drinks on the menu."}, {"review_id": "v0krT1Vk8JG5e0dtWpV9Ag", "user_id": "hgcqbQ9br5Rn5WoFl3mEjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "As soon as you step you'll feel like you've gone on a vacation.   The atmosphere and staff are fun and the drinks are delicious.   Bring your friends and get ready for a night to remember.   My drink favorite is the Zombie.  Enjoy."}, {"review_id": "axNxVHr0zgLo_CLREFrODQ", "user_id": "3Z_wV-XA30zrEPPE7FojQQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "This is definitely a unique experience.  It was packed in there so we had one drink and stood in an area that they had a server.  It's pretty much standing room only so I am not sure what the experience would be if you could get a seat.  However I feel like having a seat could be dangerous because the drinks are very strong.  The menus overwhelming so I ordered a zombie which had a two drink maximum and was apparently the strongest drink on the menu.  We ordered from the bar because we didn't see a server and had four drinks.  They are intricate cocktails so be prepared to be patient for a minute.  Also know the parking lots a mad house.  Keep in mind we went at around 9p on Saturday so not sure if it's crazy every night of the week.  I cant wait to go back in the summer!"}, {"review_id": "0S2vteXxpXsZKLniaoaj8g", "user_id": "NlAgGEmoFP9T-6WLjYM26A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/6/2017", "text": "Pros: Nice decor, good drinks, they use all their own, house-made syrups and mixers and the drinks are good!Cons: Small space, long waits, drinks take a while to prepare, limited food options, not great for groups over 4.My recommendation: Give it a try.

You want a unique, Caribbean, tiki inspired adventure than this is the place. It's sweet and fruity drinks only, with a lot of rum. We had a group of 10, it took an hour to get seated on a Friday night, and there was a line waiting out the door for seating. Service was spotty. A lot of our drinks had to be re ordered multiple times because they were forgotten about. We ordered food and the menu was weird AF. Meatballs, pizza bread, and pickles is about the extent of the menu but we were hungry so we ordered. Nothin was spectacular. Our drinks were moderately strong but no one was belligerently wasted which was good. This is a once in awhile adventure I think. Our bill was extremely high too... not sure it was worth it.
