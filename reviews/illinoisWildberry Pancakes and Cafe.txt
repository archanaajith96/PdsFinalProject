I ordered the eggs Benedict (duh) instead of the titular pancakes but left very satisfied! They give you options of what you want for a side for the benedict and chose ham. Turns out, they don't just give you a slice of ham, but they give you a BLOCK of ham! Jk, maybe not a block but it's a thick piece of ham. Very tasty! The chai tea is also very good here. My friends got pancakes and crepes from here and they looked and tasted delicious - the food not my friends. It's located blocks away from the Cultural Center and Millennium Park too! So after you're done eating, you can enjoy some of the Chicago sites! Isn't that great?Pro tip: make sure you make a reservation like a week in advance. There's a ton of seating inside and a small outdoor area, but if you don't make a reservation on a weekend you could be waiting there for 1-2 hours for a table."}, {"review_id": "4IawkF8Vk1qJzUgzMufV-g", "user_id": "BZtafoOqXIxTvUgkoEpBJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "I'm sooooooo glad I got to eat here before I left Chicago. I came for a mini vacation and wanted to eat here from day one but, the wait was always long. I walked from my hotel here on my last day exploring and thank goodness the wait was only 10 minutes. I used the Yelp app to put my name down, table for one please!!! It still took about 30 minutes before I actually got seated but, since I got to put my name down on Yelp I was still walking to Wildberry. Came checked in with the host and was seated in about 10 minutes!!! The place was crowded for a Monday morning!  Along with the food and great service I can see why this place always has a significant wait! WORTH IT!As I sat down my server told me she would be right with me. No problem!!! I was debating between an omelette or a skillet and asked her for her opinion. She told me definitely get the skillet.. I GOT THE Butcher Block skillet and it was meaty just the way I like it! I drenched it with my usual condiment..Tabasco and pepper and my mouth was livin!!!I love this breakfast place!

My husband and I are early birds so we arrived about 7:30am and then the restaurant quickly filled up.Service was prompt and friendly and all of our food was tasty. The portions were large so neither of us were able to finish out breakfasts. My husband had the famous Wildberry Pancakes which were huge, beautiful and sweet.  They were drizzled with what I would describe as a strawberry cream cheese frosting.  The pancakes had blueberries cooked in them and were accompanied by a mound of beautiful, fresh berries.I always crave a sweet breakfast but I feel like I need a savory and filling protein breakfast.  What I appreciate about Wildberry is that you can get a side of pancakes with your savory breakfast instead of toast! I loaded my omelette within ham and veggies and thoroughly enjoyed the taste and the protein kept me feeling full for hours.  The omelette cafe with fruit fruit, and drumroll, two buttermilk pancakes.  Hooray for the flexibility to get a sweet and savory breakfast combo in a comfortable atmosphere!I can"}, {"review_id": "hbxvn6XwI00MhuemMHaLzw", "user_id": "zHBcbmU_lLiVkRmVuZy7jQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Typically when I see a place with a TON of reviews it makes me not want to go there. Wildberry is right by Cloud Gate (let's be real, it's the bean) and was only three blocks from my hotel. It was a no-brainer to try it out. Wildberry was so busy, which had to be a great sign! I did another thing I don't normally do: I got what everyone else suggested, the berry bliss pancakes. Holy moly y'all, these are the BEST pancakes I've ever had. Loaded with berries, jam, and berry marscapone cheese. The marscapone totally balanced out the sweetness of the pancakes, and they were so good that I went back two mornings later and got them again, haha. I also wanted to try a skillet, so I got the butcher's block one, but I traded in some of the meat for onions and peppers. This thing was MASSIVE! It was delicious, but it was so big that I suggested they start doing a half portion for people who want to try other things too. The bf got the omelette with fig, havarti cheese, and bacon. He was hesitant until it was as big as his face! It was filled with cheese and he said it was the best omelette he's ever had. The next time I went back I got the berry bliss pancakes, sausage patties, and hash browns. I thought a la carte breakfast would be smaller, but it was still a ton of food! Wildberry is a 10/10.

Heard this place from a friend for breakfast. I came here around 9:15am on a Wednesday - my first stop in Chitown. The line was not long at all (5-10min). For some reason the setting of this Wildberry reminded me of Cheesecake Factory. Anyways, I ordered a Oreo-la-la waffle (wished that there is a description on menu). It is pretty sweet since there is an ice cream on top which I didn't except. I would say a good place for hangout or gathering, not really for real good food. Is the waffle worth 13$, not really.

For breakfast, my friend and I got the espanola omelette and Napa valley fig omelette. It comes with fruit or hash browns and toast or pancakes. I recommend the hash browns! It was nice and crispy! I got the pancakes and upgraded to a specialty pancake for $2 extra dollars - worth it! I got the signature berry bliss pancakes, really tasty and good portion! I prefer the espanola over the Napa valley fig because it comes with this delicious salsa on the side and avocado on the inside! The napa valley fig was good as well, but less ingredients and it has a sweet & salty flavor if you like that combo, due to the figs. Overall, we were stuffed and couldn't believe the portion size for the price. I definitely recommend coming early to avoid the wait. They are friendly and efficient here!

If you mean \"reminds you of a toaster strudel\" in that kind of MIND BLOWN way, then yeah, I feel ya.  I thought it had a taste of delicious mixed berries and birthday cake batter.  Best pancakes I've had?  Taste wise?  Up there.  Fluffiness?  not so much, but don't let that deter you...they were hella delicious.Southern gravy eggs Benedict -  can't remember the name of this one.  The Southerner maybe?  Idk.  It was really really good.  The sausage patty was delicious and the gravy was a little darker with what seemed to be a lot of pepper in it.  I'm a gravy man from the south and the Benny lived up to its name.  Gravy was on point and I was not disappointed.  However, this item was not one to leave you full.  Not me anyway.  Super delish tho."}, {"review_id": "yfJiFm6pq-OX65i9Hw6eyA", "user_id": "iR54aSd1mCRvdnr84t_VRA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "I've only been to Chicago twice and for some reason, both times I have eaten here for breakfast before heading home.

If you are a corn beef person, you'll love their hash here. They don't skimp out of the meat and the hash browns are perfectly brown and crispy! The pancakes are also moist and fluffy!

We all got 1 order of the signature berry bliss pancake (4 bigger sized pancakes piled on top of each other), 1 order of the Fresca omelet with a side of a sub speciality pancake of chocolate chip banana (2 smaller sized pancakes). Out of all that we ordered, pancakes were definitely the better option. It's fluffy, filling and good.

These people take pancakes very seriously. The service was extremely friendly and inviting. The place is big, clean, and inviting.

I ordered a mexican style skillet which was very good but then I also got their signature pancake plate which was WAY over the top for a weekday. I mean this in a good way but I didn't dare try to finish it. They stack this up with fruit and crème and all things decadent that can go sensibly on a pancake and make that a meal in itself.I'd recommend this for a good breakfast with traditional options and also to anybody with a sweet tooth wanting fine dessert quality pancakes served with care and presentation in mind.

I'm not sure why I didn't care for it before. It might've been that I was turned off by super hyped places. We also didn't know better before so would actually wait for 1-1.5 hours. I loathe waiting. If a restaurant doesn't take reservations, I generally avoid. HOWEVER, my fiancé found out about the \"no wait\" app and Wildberry is a participant!!! We'll put our name on the list the moment we wake up. By the time we're on our way to the restaurant, we're only a few spots away. Love their extensive menu. I've tried a host of items. The wraps are the most disappointing. The crepes are depressing. My fiancé loves their brisket hash and my favorites are the Mexicana skillet and BLT sandwich. Man, I love myself a good BLT and they pack them with lots of crunchy bacon here. You can ask to substitute for a side of pancakes instead of the usual sides. Those are the ultimate prize. Their pancakes are absolutely delicious and I wholeheartedly believe THE BEST in the city. That's why you come eat at Wildberry. My favorites are the cinnamon and the signature berry bliss. House coffee is free refill and made exactly to my liking - bold and strong. I'm awake instantly after one sip. Service is always efficient. The servers are super nice and knowledgeable about the menu and understand how the place runs.

I still enjoyed my hot chocolate that came in a large cup.I ordered the Espanola, with cheddar cheese, without the chorizo but with hash browns. Mommy ordered the Garden Omelette with toast. First off, the portions are huge, so that alone may have contributed to my immediate sense of fullness. Personally, I thought that hers definitely tasted better than mine. There was something about the melted cheese in the hot skillet and mix of veggies that was just more flavorful.In addition, we also ordered the Special blackberry and key lime pie pancakes and fell in love.

They give you big chucks of ham that were over and inch thick. COME HUNGRY!!! They are extremely generous with their servings. The eggs were perfectly poached. My husband had the eggs Benedict with the sausage gravy and biscuits, it was really well done. The gravy was the perfect consistency and the biscuits were buttery and light. Now upon reading all the reviews it was suggested that we try the *Berry Bliss pancakes*, lets not forget that this place is called Wildberry PANCAKES after all. TRY THEM!!! Our waitress was really fantastic and when we asked about them she said because we both had entrees already she could do a short stack of these pancakes. They were fabulous! Just rich and fluffy with the tartness of the berry sauces mixed with the vanilla formed the perfect combination of flavors. If you come here I recommend you try these. You wont be disappointed.
