I don't know if it was the best meal of my life, but it definitely is in the conversation (on a short list that includes other top places, such as Osteria Francescana, Eleven Madison Park, and Momofuku Ko).First off, the food is incredible -- there's a lot of other stuff going on, but if there was no theater to it, it would still be world class food. I'm not sure what my favorite was (there are a lot of candidates, from the parsnip soup with lemon and caviar that we started with, to the black artichoke balls, to the squab that was hidden under coal), but just about every bite was incredible, and we all left extremely full.The theater is a huge part of it, though, as is the environment in general, which, to my surprise was not stuffy at all -- the staff there was funny and really down to earth, if not quite casual. That, combined with what felt like basically perfect pacing, really added to the experience. (As did the theatrics, which I won't give away here.)In all, an amazing experience that was truly worth the incredibly high price tag."}, {"review_id": "UvDJwn51Yh-tEZ_KmO1VwQ", "user_id": "ZhK2xIa4f73JZfua7IP8vA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "A truly unique dining experience.  Go early.Would advise booking a reservation as early in the day as possible (5pm) and showing up even earlier since a salient part of the Alinea experience is the surprise of what's coming next; after all, the menu is a word search!Being the first table served in a particular section avoids having the big reveals (smoke! fire! foam! trickery!) spoiled by presentations to the neighbors at the next table.  Further, as many effects are atmosphere-building (consider smoldering juniper sprigs, citrus aromatics), showing up late precludes the olfactory build-up (compare to the omekase sushi experience) that earlier diners enjoy.Overall, even the 10-14 course Salon menu is a lot of food.  Starve yourself prior and walk over from CTA Red Line to make room."}, {"review_id": "HWDvmBqQJ32buy09KnKDUQ", "user_id": "2Z3x9jT8lA8pmsdm6unHMQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "It's good, but certainly not \"the best in the nation\".

I love Alinea. However, the restaurant seems to no longer place the diner first. One of the amazing things about Michelin 3-star restaurants is how personalized and accommodating the experience can be. Alinea no longer seems to be one of those places.I needed a table for six for a particular night. I logged on right as they went on sale but because Alinea only offers one table for six (that isn't the $3k kitchen table) I was not able to get it. I reserved two tables (one of 4, one for 2) at the same time in the same section of the restaurant for that night. After emailing Alinea, I was shocked that they not only refused to move the tables next to one another, but went out of their way to ensure the tables would not even be in the same room. Remember this is a restaurant that changes the entire table configuration in the gallery over the course of one meal- this is not an impossible ask of them. Their response: \"it is the policy set in place by the Chef and Owner that we are not able to accommodate requests to seat duplicate tables near one another. Movement and interaction between separate tables has proven to be disruptive to the flow of service for our team as well as the other diners. Your two tables will be seated in separate dining rooms.\" For full disclosure they did offer me the opportunity to book the $3,000 kitchen table, but that would double the cost of an already expensive meal. When policy starts to win out over reasonable customer requests, a restaurant such as Alinea has lost direction. Alinea should look at the definition of its own name, a new direction,  and start in a new direction of once again trying to delight the diner."}, {"review_id": "wF1M__h5vV4rYcE4eAMCLA", "user_id": "SNAjkVZK-J7FzQMDfNLD6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "One of the best modern dining experiences ever.I was lucky enough to get tickets as my friend and I are from out of town and did not want to miss the opportunity to dine at Alinea.

It just wasn't enough food. I don't mind bites. In fact I love bites. But the main entree, a protein, was, no joke, one inch square. It just came off as cheap, despite all the pomp and circumstance of a floating edible balloon and smoking dry ice. If you are visiting Alinea, only go if you can afford the largest tasting menu PLUS the wine tasting. Otherwise it's just a waste of money and you'll find yourself paying for a second dinner elsewhere that day. Some of the courses just weren't good on their own without the wine pairing. Not to say some of the food wasn't pretty great, but honestly nothing really blew me away. Maybe the caviar dish. It's more an olfactory experience. I was just too offended by the one inch protein. I understand if you're having a lot of bites I don't want a 4 oz protein, but Jesus at least make it three inches. I think the restaurant should get rid of the lower cost dinner if they're going to provide this experience  - (because why should you be full after paying a paltry $250?) it's not worthy of Alinea, just offensive that you are treating the \"masses\" this way. In my visit of some of the best restaurants in the world, Eleven Madison Park, Per Se, Le Bernardin, Borago, The Ledbury, the French Laundry, Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, Pujol, Alinea's salon menu is definitely the worst of the bunch.

Was it worth the trip? Yes, definitely. Is it worth a trip? Yes.... but I wish I was a millionaire because travel and hotel costs are pricey. If I lived in the state, definitely worth it the experience! I rate the experience if I were a millionaire a solid 8/10. Attention to detail: 10/10: everybody wished me happy birthday from the concierge to the waiters' and waitress'! Wow! Not only that but I even received a candle at the end. But aside from thinking the night was all about me.. every dish was made precisely to consistent perfection, or was it? Multiple small details in my dish were different to my partners (different amounts of miso, dots of decor, lighting) and I read somewhere that Grant's job is to make sure your dish is exactly the same as your neighbors no matter what. So if that's the case things were different- but I do think the experience was the same for mainly everybody. Order of food/tables: 2/10: Since tables were close I spoke often to my neighbors, great right? Wrong! It made it hard to not notice what they were eating and doing..therefore eliminating the element and experience of surprise or awe. Luckily, I noticed being distracted and focused on my partner's face after the third dish for the rest of the dishes. I was therefore amused by 2-4 dishes. My partner was extremely distracted and unfortunately noticed all the dishes ahead of time. I know space is limited but I wish we all had cubicles or thin walls up! The pro to seeing other tables with similar dishes was being able to reminisce about what I ate and enjoyed seeing- like seeing four seasons. Variety: 10/10: enjoyed the dessert flavors, savory and sweet dishes and even the palate clearers. I especially liked the field trip to the kitchen to get some non/alcoholic drinks and delicious bread with a view of Grant! Story telling: 10/10: amazing! They all are really witty and great -not only at telling you what ingredients were used but also telling you how to eat certain things in a funny manner. See if you can find the one who calls herself the 'oracle'! Overall, I would not come back until I'm a millionaire. But I did thoroughly enjoy myself here for my first 3 star mich restaurant. I look forward to try some more in the US!

Looking back, did my experience live up to my expectations? Not entirely, but I had a fun time nevertheless.Overall, I will say that the tasting menu at Alinea was not the tastiest that I've had in Chicago; however, I must praise the creativity that went into each dish's presentation. I was looking forward to the tabletop dessert that I had seen in the episode, but it seems that that particular dish has been retired from the menu. Alinea's menu is constantly changing and it may vary even slightly from one week to the next. I appreciate the innovation that goes behind each dish.I had a fun time dining here. I have had many people ask me if it was worth it for the price. Honestly, it depends what you are looking for--although each of the dishes were not necessarily the most delicious things I have ever eaten, I liked the artistry and creativity of how they were presented.

On the one hand, it was the fanciest and coolest dinner experience I've ever had. On the other hand, I can't really justify the ratio of price to enjoyment of food, even though the atmosphere and experience were stellar. A lot of my friends would consider me a foodie and while I can be a bit of a food snob when it comes to certain things (boba, dim sum, ramen haha), I'm not as hardcore a foodie as my spouse. He's the real reason we came here and paid a crap ton of money on one meal. Granted, it was an amazing show and presentation and experience, but I wouldn't have chosen to eat here if it wasn't for Alinea being on Kevin's bucket list. This was the fanciest dinner I've ever been to and it was kind of nice to be pampered like that for a few hours! They changed out my linen napkin every time I got up to use the restroom (which was quite a few times during the 3 hour meal since I'm pregnant) and they explained every dish in detail. One or two of the servers noticed that I'm left handed and set the utensils accordingly. The dishes were inventive, interesting, playful, whimsical, fun, creative, and beautiful! But personally, I just sometimes didn't like how all of the flavors tasted together. My favorite meal that we had in Chicago during our Thanksgiving trip was actually at Girl and the Goat (and it was under $100, waaay cheaper than Alinea). I won't bore you with the details of all the 10 or so courses they served, but I'm sure if you're a hardcore foodie like my spouse, you won't want to read it anyway so you can experience everything for the first time without knowing what's coming. Anyway, my ramble is done: 5 star experience, 4 star food, 4 stars overall because it was too much money (in my opinion) for the amount of enjoyment I got from the food."}, {"review_id": "rWZrBpJS2sBgmychKkbY8g", "user_id": "qLkoQ76HanLXlHFTImXMsQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "I came here to celebrate match day with my family in the kitchen at 9:30.  Kitchen table seats 6 people.

Knowing that there are 2 tiers of reservation above this one, I didn't really expect the experience to be as magical as it was in the Netflix Chefs Table show, I was wrong.On the table awaiting for our arrival, was a bowl of oranges with this pleasant aroma and a word search containing the courses for the night. You would find words like coal, ink, rock etc. that did not look like food that was going to be served. The only word I knew for sure was part of the courses was balloon because my friend told me about it earlier. This made me really curious about the courses, and it gets you really excited for the experience.Courses began to be served shortly and aesthetically speaking, they all looked very unique and creative. The courses tasted well as well but that should be the case for any restaurant of this caliber, but several courses went above and beyond, and tasted really really good even when compared to some of the other 3 star restaurants in the country.Nothing goes to waste. Everything on the table has a purpose as we had this bucket of burning salt to heat one of our courses, and later we discovered that there was something cooking inside of the salt. All expectations are out the window with the experience, and you should just sit back, relax and enjoy this one of a kind meal.We even got to visit the kitchen in the middle of the meal, and one of the courses was offered there. I did not expect this to be part of The Salon reservation. It was a pleasant surprise to get to see Chef Grant and Chef Mike in person.After the meal when they give back your coat, you will find your coat warmed. This subtle detail really shows that Alinea puts thought into every step of the dining experience, including those that happen before and after the meal. (This may seem common but wasn't the case for the three other 3 star Michelin restaurants I've had)Overall this was an outstanding experience with friendly waiters who offered great service. The courses looked good, tasted good, and combined with the variety of aromas coming from different accessories of the courses, you get to experience a very multi dimensional meal where all your senses are stimulated.I would definitely want to visit again sometime and try to gather enough friends to make a reservation at The Alinea Kitchen Table. (I believe you need 6)I know my English is all over the place but hopefully it's comprehensible. Also I watched the Netflix show after the meal, and Chef Grant really is someone that strives to curate a unique experience for his customers. He demonstrates the difference between people who are satisfied with current and past successes and the ones that constantly seeks to innovate and improve, and this is what makes his restaurant one of the best. Plus the fact that he almost lost his ability to taste due to cancer near his tongue area, and that he'd rather die than to not be able to continue to live as a chef.

We could only get the salon menu but we were still excited.  We had watched the 'Chef's Table' documentary on Alinea and was prepared to be wowed. Unfortunately, we came after the restaurant remodeled and...I was pretty disappointed. Now, the food was very creative, some dishes were unforgettable, but for a meal that cost us nearly A GRAND, I was left wanting more. From what I've read and what friends have claimed, the previous Alinea was magical. Every course was a show, a mystery, and a surprise. Each course WAS entertaining and filled with gimmicks (the illusion of a wall when you enter, fires at the table, dessert was basically edible art, watch the documentary for more). This is what we were expecting, and let's face it, we love the gimmicks and wanted the show! However, after the remodel, it seems that the chef has tried to focus \"more on the food\". Sadly, there was no show. Just really expensive, but delicious food. The service for such a high end restaurant was really quite poor. Our waiter must have been in training to say the least, because he seemed uncomfortable and awkward. He stuttered with each course description and seemed to not know what was going on. Also, after seating and welcoming us, the first thing the waiter says is \"there is an additional course of white truffle something (I couldn't understand the waiter) that the chef has added to the menu. If you would like to try it. It's an additional $200 a person.\" Obviously we HAD to get it, but starting the meal that way was also very off-putting. They should really just increase the base price and include the special courses for everyone instead of starting the meal with a \"surprise, you have to pay more if you actually want the full meal.\" Anyway, that white truffle dish ended up being AMAZING. Again, Overall,Food=5 starsService=2 stars WOW factor=2 stars If you have a couple thousand dollars to spend, the food is definitely out of this world.

You still get to see Grant and the kitchen and pay a fraction of the cost (though I would definitely like the opportunity to sit kitchen-side if I had $$$$).
