No.Should I compare them? Yes.There are hints that this place would be just like those famous places, but it is not. Generally unseasoned like the Philly steak I know...check. The equivalent of a whiz witout,...check. Philadelphia feel? Check.What's missing? The bread. It just did not hold up to the same standard as a Philadelphia cheese steak.However... On its own, it is perfectly acceptable. It is s good place to go and eat, customer service was great, and the food was quality. This isn't fast food, but quality did quickly. Try it.

Stopped here on the way to Mount Rushmore based on the reviews. I've had my share of Philly sandwiches in Philly and elsewhere. This was the grossest food ever. It came out and the bread was soggy from the minute I opened it. The meat smelled as if it were bad and overall I just could not eat this sandwich. I had to send it back and ask for my money back. This was after a mix up where they gave me the wrong order completely. I felt for the poor girl working the counter, but honestly it was terrible. She had no manager on site and no way to solve a problem on her own. She'd been there a week so I can hardly blame her."}, {"review_id": "vW9jGwZfYl_va9MneBlmSw", "user_id": "_pkwfwQx9--_sueH4yJ6hg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2017", "text": "Cheesesteak was incredible.

That Colt though.  That's my desert island sandwich for sure."}, {"review_id": "aG_Ti7fHeteJfV5ULPuwqg", "user_id": "QgKr96wdl2RYom0r7uX4yw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/6/2017", "text": "I would have posted a picture of the food but it was so good I couldn't put it down.
