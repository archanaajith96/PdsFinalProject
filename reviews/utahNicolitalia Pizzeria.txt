I have been here three times now and every time the pizza is amazing. Their thin crust is so flavorful. I think they said they do a slow rise of 48 hours and you can totally taste it. Tonight we got cheese and then we split a pizza: ranch, chicken and bacon on one side and bbq sauce, chicken and red onions on the other. Both were winners!I forgot to mention, the staff are all really great as well AND you can also buy the dough and ingredients so you can have homemade pizza that tastes awesome."}, {"review_id": "_rWHepjE9l8opGbJ1m9-sQ", "user_id": "dKr0Gg077trG3e0R24THdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Never going to Slab again.The pizza here was thin but not too thin.

Like tears of joy!  We went in and ate, the greek salad and a small Italian Stallion did not disappoint!

The staff was super friendly and the pizza I got was very unique and surprisingly delicious! I ordered the pesto chicken pizza which had a lot of greens on it. One topping was broccoli, which I wouldn't have thought to ever put on a pizza, but all I can say is YUM! I loved the thin crust and how the pizza had just the right amount of ingredients.  After a slice or two it left me feeling good and not super gross and greasy. I am looking forward to trying out something else on the menu."}, {"review_id": "ZPOjGAVmDnuylGzacs1ztw", "user_id": "tKEFJN0XrlC-9O4aKDH5aQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Always great pizza and a fun environment for the family. My kids love the Meatza pizza. I am a fan of the North End. My wife loves the salads with house dressing. Everyone can find the perfect drink on the Coke FreeStyles. And Dessert! The dessert pizzas change often and are always a nice way to finish off the meal. My boys love the bites with the oreo topping.

Anything really Boston about it is gone. Now its just a expensive average pizza.  There sauce used to have a bite now its just there and they used to have an amazing deep dish thats gone now.  The ild deep dish was crustless and thick now its thin and mostly crust a far cry from what it used to be.  I actually breaks my heart to see a place that used to be in the running for the best in the state,  now its meh. Its not bad its just no where near where it was.  I don't think I'll be back hopefully they get there mojo back but it feels like the passion is gone from this place."}, {"review_id": "3dEMXqHhmRGbItp8UEEg9w", "user_id": "JFGSh9tm9F1e4uVA26fOBg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "PIZZA BY THE SLICE reviewLoved the Pizza by the Slice.  Good price, Great taste, and extra crunchy."}, {"review_id": "CNVD1fgtu9YWRcNLWXZAwA", "user_id": "BRjGy-XEh9SI4Yoc8zgZ5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/7/2017", "text": "NEW location, same great food.

The BEST cannoli!! Even an oreo cannoli!! Their garlic knots are to die for....their pizza is perfection.....so many different combos....Today I brought in a group of 4...we had a large order. They threw in a pepperoni pizza simply because we had to wait longer than they felt was warranted.

I think it's a south American guy that owns it now. I've been buying this pizza for years now and the drop in quality didn't happen until they ownership changed. They ALWAYS skimp on the tomato sauce now. They try to cover it up by adding a ton more cheese, so essentially it's like a soggy cheese cracker. The pizza is usually under cooked and when you order it extra crispy, they usually don't listen to the customer. In conclusion, there's isn't much of a difference between Nicolitalia and run-of-the-mill Pizza Hut these days.

Pasta came to mind. After searching on Yelp my friend and I found this place.Upon entering it smelled pretty good. Being originally from the East Coast I was a bit worried about trying the pizza. That is what my friend ordered. I ended up going with pasta with marinara sauce. They have combos here so you can get one of these combos with a main dish, a salad and a drink. All very reasonably priced. Most hover around the $8 mark.When the food came out I was quite happy with the way mine looked. The pasta and sauce were quite tasty and the hot bread that came along on the side was very good as well. It was exactly the meal I was looking for.My friend said the pizza was not very good. We both know Utah is not famous for their pizza.If you are looking for affordable Italian style food and you are in the area you might give this place a shot."}, {"review_id": "9dvAF8dLkmtAF5ZrU-MOgg", "user_id": "hCmKAisNG2OhAqL_ERqjcQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Now my favorite pizza joint in the UC. I can't get enough of their deep dish margherita, and the house dressing is like crack.  If you want a chewy crust with a cheesy, olive-oil flavored sauce and just the right amount of seasoned tomatoes, get the deep dish margh.
