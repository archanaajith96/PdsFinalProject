The drinks are always consistently delicious (I always get their iced green latte or macchiato, and their black royal chai), their food is always great as well! I mostly get their all about fire roll! - I highly recommend if you like spicy tuna! The bibimbap is not quite like an authentic one but their version of it is still tasty! Their service is also full of friendly staff all the time who are polite and personable! The place is super cozy and my go-to place when I used to study there and now I go there to just relax and chat!"}, {"review_id": "E0AbRUiZYta_M_XLPRtq6g", "user_id": "jHst6wiAixCgc02BxxcpyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "I enjoy a lot of the more hipster atmospheres and this definitely fits the bill. I recommend taking your studies, books, laptop, whatever with you and taking a nice little break while drinking tea.Their rose tea is one of my favorites. The buds they use for it colors the tea to a slight pink and it smells wonderful! Just overall aesthetically pleasing.So far though for the price of the food, I don't think it's all that worth it. The bulgogi/or bibimbap bowl I had wasn't amazing. They did their own little spin on it and that's fine but definitely wouldn't call it what they had, just felt more like a regular salad bowl with some meat in it and rice. I have yet to try their other items on the food menu though as I mostly come for tea, so hopefully I'll find something I like a bit more."}, {"review_id": "MWgd39c5Ft_XSxgAdfV80A", "user_id": "tGqqNenOcKnBCLaASxkayg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Love everything this place.

Had stopped by late afternoon for some cake and tea. Upon entering, there were about 3-4 dirty tables, which remained uncleaned for the duration we were there. While we were perusing the menu the staff was on their phone, and continued to be until we got their attention. We had gotten the Misakuru (Cereal) Latte, All about 5 Cha, and a raspberry lemon cake, The tea was great and prepared beautifully (As depicted). The Misakuru Latte, was interesting- traditionally, Misakuru, or Misugaru is a mixture of grain finely cut into a powder- this Latte was extremely gritty and was way too thick as far as consistency. The cake was pretty and definitely Instagram worthy. However, when we cut into it the middle was a big frozen so we had to let it thaw. Still tasty though.In all, my experience at this All about Cha location was underwhelming. I know this place gets a lot of traffic among locals, but I still wish as a newer customer the service and cleanliness of this location was better."}, {"review_id": "xNxnIO3-G9G6BdHP2yQAFg", "user_id": "z6t9DCU6GyhhRlc7-hr78A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "First time here was delightful! Very nice place. Lots of room. Quiet. Service was perfect and helpful. I got the fruit crepes with a large black coffee. Soooo good! The most perfect crepes I've had. They had the perfect amount of fruit and whip on the side and the texture was, again, delightful. Definitely loved the atmosphere. It was warm and inviting. I liked that they had a stevia option instead of just regular sugar or Splenda. They also had a half and half option for coffee instead of all those other sugary options. This is a perfect place to go and have some quiet time. I can't wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "U2ucSSY6l-PH0JBfT6v4oA", "user_id": "s3U0QDgbVsD_gnmtfTqZgg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Great tea, but in need of some upkeep. We came in for tea around tea time. I sampled the house blend, which was quite yummy, and split a dessert with my partner. The dessert was good, but I was not floored. My first \"huh?\" Moment: I was  a little alarmed by the macarons. The barista herself said they were not great, and at $7 for a row (not sold individually) we couldn't justify it. What got me is that the rows looked exactly (down to the color arrangement) like the multipacks of thaw-and-serve macarons you can find at Trader Joe's, with the tray cut in half. I'm glad we didn't go for them. Charging $7 for a half tray of macarons when you can buy the box for $4.99 is beyond me. The service was lacking. The employees were standing behind the counter chatting and texting. Facilities were also in need of attention. The tea was good enough for me to overlook, so I might be back, but I'll stick to the patio."}, {"review_id": "uZv2O4npMppO-b9HxTFoPg", "user_id": "filR0kQf8cNJGkLP7tCBFg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/10/2017", "text": "This is the western avenue edition of this local korea styled tea and coffee chain.Like most everything else in the area it's located in yes, a strip mall complete with it's own parking lot. This lot is shared with a half dozen other small businesses and at times you may be parking in a corner opposite the front entrance. No biggie though.So as far as all about cha goes it's a pretty safe bet for great tea and awesome(if limited) speciality coffee's. The tea selection is epic, the food choices are great if slightly expensive, there is a lot of comfy seating, the wi fi is free and blazing fast and it's a lot more casual then you'd expect given the location. The service is of the order at counter get metal stand and order will be brought out model.As far as this specific location goes it's slightly larger than the edmond location with a very different layout. There is a row of booths along one wall, separated from the larger dining area by the order counter and a small but very pleasing patio for outside seating. The booths offer a fair amount of privacy for working or studying or whatever. The larger dining area has some family style seating. While the tea and coffee offering are very consistently very good, I'm not too impressed with the food at times. Maybe it's just me but the sushi seems a little overblown.Coffee/tea and a sweet will run less then ten bucks, eating lunch here will knock the tab up to fifteen or so.At any rate all about cha pretty much always has great tea, decadent mocha's and such like in a very comfortable environment.  This one is no exception."}, {"review_id": "CNile2hq0GuiKva5OqIGSw", "user_id": "HvnmD-BxErz1fdLuyUw13A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Delicious!

Why deal with the awful Nichols Hills Starbucks when you click support a local business with better coffee?! I love all their selections of coffee, lattes and tea and that they carry non dairy options. I had an almond milk cappuccino and the omelette with sausage and veggies. The omelette was packed with veggies which I loved and came with a side of fruit. My husband had a regular coffee and the waffle with a side of fruit. He said his waffle was delicious but wished it had a little been a little more toasty but overall it was still delicious, soft and fluffy. I have only had breakfast and coffee here but can't wait to go back for lunch and dinner! It's also a great spot for dessert as they carry homemade desserts and even pie junkie pie!"}, {"review_id": "WtPD9TandOH-tHiLK-8fGQ", "user_id": "1XKxxvXWut9xtIywjbvctQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/9/2017", "text": "I have a new goal: to usurp the title of Duke of All About Cha (AAC) from Jeff M. The only problem is that usually every time I'm at this location, it's with Jeff M.What a predicament...Anyway, AAC has the ability to do one thing that so many other coffee shops in Oklahoma City can't. Stay open past 9. If ever we need to meet up as a group in the evening, we never need to think twice about where to go. AAC is always a good suggestion.Aside from hours that work for us, their selection of foodstuffs is great! As far as I know, this AAC is the only one that serves Pie Junkie Pies, which places it a bit higher than all the other AAC locations. Get the Drunken Turtle and some coffee-type beverage (one that isn't too sweet since the pie already takes care of that). They go so well with each other! I've never had their lunch or dinner items so I can't speak on how good or bad it is, but I'm willing to bet that they're pretty good. If you're wanting dinner, make sure you place your order before 9 since that's when their kitchen closes. I can't say that I've ever had a bad experience here. If they keep doing what they're already doing, I'll keep coming back. Heck, if I don't keep coming back, how will I become the Duke?"}, {"review_id": "JuLXVVbDNvIoTQOuLK9Gqw", "user_id": "PCH-dLK8Fd_EaDaTiEAU9g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/20/2017", "text": "I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE! If you like somewhere nice and relaxing, enjoy all about cha with a few of your good friends to catch up or to study. The noise level here is quite average. Sometimes it can be loud depending on how busy they are. But, usually,this little cafe shop slows down later afternoon/evening where many students are able to study and focus on their work while enjoying a bit of the coffees and teas here. Some of my favorite drinks are the goguma (original or green tea)!! This is a must try! It comes as a hot drink. Great for the wintertime! Btw, it's a sweet potato drink?! Like whuuuuut. Who knew something so weird can turn into something so fabulous! If you like something cold, I absolutely love their macchiatos (coffee or green tea). They have different varieties with mocha as well as w caramel toppings. I am totally in love! PS. The price range for the drinks are around Starbucks prices.THEY ALSO HAVE KITCHEN FOOD HERE! so if you are feeling a bit hungry, they serve wraps, croissants, breakfast items, salads, sushi and more!(Sushi here is alright. I don't think, personally,  that it's worth for the price. It's quite expensive and I can find better quality at sushi neko or tokyo for around the same range) MUST TRY: - bulgogi wrap- ALL OF THE SALADS ARE DELICIOUS AND FREAKING HUGE! Just saying!

They're both nicely furnished, with wide open spacing, and are generally good places for groups/study time. Plus, they both have Pie Junkie slices. If I had to pick one location over the other, I would probably pick this one because it's not all the way in downtown and I don't have to pay for parking. Great desserts, great drinks, and great Pie Junkie slices. I'd recommend going here for an after-lunch/dinner dessert if you're in the Classen Curve area. Additionally, the bathroom doors lock properly (always a plus)! The staff are always very personable here and have good suggestions if you're not sure what you're wanting.Still can't recommend getting actual food from there, but All About's desserts and drinks more than make up for it. I especially like how they garnish my dessert plate with chocolate/caramel designs. 99% of the time, they're super pretty. 1% of the time, they're hilarious looking. Get the Drunken Turtle Pie or a sleeve of Macarons (or both, why not?). Then get a regular sized brew coffee. Then rest easy knowing that you make good life choices."}, {"review_id": "uLvpg_Q9JMNwhFp3BeV2Ow", "user_id": "MIJ6XeneTBYa7LiRDlTs8Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/13/2017", "text": "I don't know how it normally is since I am not from OK, but we came on a Friday night at 7PM and it was pretty much empty.
