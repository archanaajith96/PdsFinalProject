I honestly wasn't expecting much, but since Seattle is known for coffee and Starbucks I was like why not and I was pleasantly surprised.DRINKS: They have a wide selection of drinks that a normal Starbucks wouldn't have. My favorite was the Emerald City Mule. It was like a mocktail and they used coffee in it instead of alcohol. Even on a cold day, I enjoyed it. It was refreshing and the flavors mixed together really nicely.LOCATION: It's definitely further away from the main tourist places like Pike Place and the Space Needle and stuff, but it's still only like a 15 minute walk towards Pike Place. Our AirBnb was only like a 2 minute walk to Starbucks so it was like our stop before walking to Pike Place.The best part about this Starbucks isn't the drinks, the food or the location. It was everything else inside it. It's huge! When we walked in, we lowkey just stood there and stared at everything. It's at least 6 times the size of a normal Starbucks. There's the main area with just a selection of drinks and pastries (from Milan btw). Then to the right there's a full bar where you can order drinks with or without alcohol. To the right of that is the full kitchen. In the back, there's like a machine where they package the coffee beans and all that. There's even a cute little library/conference room. And the souvenir section is huge. My friends and I stayed here for almost 2 hours and then we came back that same night."}, {"review_id": "wgy91ljKsy_4jKYm7m8GKA", "user_id": "Ri7UooWSutGLSuzdS2osAQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Ooooh... shiny. No, it really is. There's copper all over the place, and it's all bright a delightful. Of course, this isn't a run-of-the-mill Starbucks. It's a veritable theme park of gratuitous coffeeness (that's not a word, but kind of sums it up).The times I've gone there, it was always jammed with tourists and gawkers, and it has a sort of carnival atmosphere. One thing to keep in mind is that the swankiness doesn't come cheap. Prices reflect the seemingly holy experience of expensive coffee. I knew this going in, and that's all part of it, so don't be surprised when you hit the register. It's a fun experience, and one of those things to do so you can say \"I was there, man.\""}, {"review_id": "77dVLrg9FHgDVJqzVMH2-g", "user_id": "CxryWv315_JpmB61yvH68g", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "This is as far away as you can get from the deck of a whaling ship.

If you're there with a group, I would suggest finding a table while the other person buys the food. We got there around 1030am on a weekday and it was packed. 2. They dont have a food menu but they do have coffee menu. Walk around and figure out what you want to eat.3. When you enter, most of the food and bar are on the right, coffee on the left. Merchandise up front. 4. There's a self guided tour, map is on the middle table as soon as you enter. 5. Lunch is served at 11am. They switch from pastries to pasta,pizza, etc. They didn't kick us out even when it was busy. Service was good. The servers at the food station were all very friendly and patient. So sit, relax, enjoy your coffee and food.:) both the bfast and lunch were delicious."}, {"review_id": "3WAJ1oduNJ0iJmJWzRw_Wg", "user_id": "tuD4f7RtaCuLn32jLiGTGw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Still awesome.  I tried something new and had them brew some coffee using some flasks.  It takes a lot longer but it is worth the experience to watch the coffee theatre.  Also alcoholic beverages were available at 10 am in the morning and you could drink it anywhere within the Roastery.  They were busy today but it allowed me to take my time with my coffee.  Settling up was quick and easy using the Starbucks card on my phone.

Which are on point with their aesthetic and they are extremely pretty. I am so happy they added some female barista team members. They look cute and hella pretty. I am extremely jealous of their long luscious hairs and their beautiful charm. Will go straight for a female barista.Anyways, I have to write my update review on this place, since this weekend has been amazing with Starbucks Reserve every morning. Dropped by every morning for a coffee to bring to the convention, and it was needed because convention hours are too early for me.They were quick and fast even though they are always busy. It seems like they have gotten it down for the take outs, which is a good thing. They offer Agave, dairy free milks (Almond, soy), and simple syrup all the time at the side. I don't see honey, which is a good thing.Their bakery, which they added since the last time I was here is DELICIOUS. They have a breakfast/lunch menu and then they change it around 4:00pm daily.Breakfast/lunch they have these cute little sandwiches and they look SOOO delicious, I haven't had a chance to eat them yet. And at dinner they have pasta and pizza all made in house and fresh daily. Their bread they make fresh daily as well and it just looks so appetizing.Must come back again soon to try their food. Maybe in the summer? idk. lets see where this year will take me~!"}, {"review_id": "ocO3qbobQTeHu0fvHfWsNQ", "user_id": "BFUuCHCs1DJxZwri5PTB4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Came here because we are in Seattle !!Don't miss it, what an experience. Yes, it is Starbucks but boy, check out the coffee bean machines, and just the mid century modern atmosphere, and just crowd watching. Not to mention the food that they sell here, you can't get it at any other Starbucks. Plus, if you have your coffee here, they serve it in this black Starbucks reserve mug.

But, damn, this is a cool Starbucks / coffee shop / tourist attraction to visit. Not only don't you have to deal with the drama of not knowing that \"tall\" means \"small\" if you don't regularly go to a Starbucks, but you get the very cool ambiance, the Starbucks greets that have a million times more flair than the greeters at other stores... that have greeters. And, service, at least the service we had, was out of this world. I mean, the dude that served us our tasting flight with chocolate ($15 + $13 or vv) and ice cream with coffee ($14) took a ton of time just chatting with us like we were the only customers there. Granted, maybe he was only assigned that one little section of counter, but it was the VIP experience all the way. I almost wanted to exchange numbers with him so we could get together for coffee later. He even offered to exchange our ice cream thing when my friend said she didn't love it (but apparently that's a Starbucks policy in general I was unaware of, along my knowledge of \"tall\"). Bottom line: A pretty penny, but you get the white-glove experience. Even if you order nada, take a gander in this cool ambiance."}, {"review_id": "6EryNoVIjgeg5Zga8y325A", "user_id": "Iq-9jCp219AEcbtjy-ZyNQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "My husband was so excited to visit this roaster store.

People searching for the following:Child-friendly: Not at all. There are 2 high chairs and 1 was broken. I think Starbucks can do better than that. Food: why can't you order it on the lower-level sit-down area? It has nothing to do with \"soiling the coffee aroma\"--you can eat in the lower-level sit-down area, but you have to walk across the store order, pay, and bring food back. Service: It's a tourist spot--don't expect great service. But if you do get great service and pay with the Starbucks app, there's no way to adequately tip for a large order.

My hubs and I came in on whim and a barista directed us where to go. The back bar is where you wanna go if you want to do a \"taster.\" We got three flavors of coffee to try done in the clover press method. I was surprised that we both liked the lighter roast coffee because we're both usually medium to dark roast coffee drinkers. The barista gave us a couple of recommendations on what kinds of desserts to get to pair - We got them and really liked the fact that the chocolate enhanced the flavors of the coffee. The middle part of the building is the \"retail\" portion - They have a lot of cool gadgets and coffee memorabilia and you can also buy the artisanal blends there.

So yes, you can get it without the whiskey if you must, but I haven't tried it without.There is plenty of different Starbucks goodies you can buy.  Including a Starbucks apron with the leather details for $160ish.  So I looked and didn't buy anything.  You can see how they make different types of coffees, there is food, which we didn't have any of, but the flatbreads looked good.  You can even do a coffee flight.  Definitely better for a visit than the original Starbucks in Pikes Place Market."}, {"review_id": "Y078EE9kv6OBnCzKC0mGcQ", "user_id": "WKfkkrtE6pFEQQ7AEc7zrw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "First time here.

Their pasta dishes (we ordered the Rigatoni and the Risotto) were also TOP NOTCH. It's definitely on the expensive side, as the dishes were fairly small, but it was an experience.
