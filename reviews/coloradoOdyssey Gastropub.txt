However; there's no way we will ever be returning to this My opinion is that there is something wrong in your kitchen. My daughter's short bread was burnt, the bacon on the BLT tasted as though it was microwaved before it was placed on the sandwich and it was so hot in the establishment that my husband and I were sweating so bad, sweat was dripping into our eyes.  The mayo aioli was warm (warm/hot mayo is never good), and the servers had no idea what was going on.  The bartender smelt like severe BO, probably because it was so hot,  but not something that anyone wants to smell where they plan on eat. It took us 15 minutes to get water and an additional 15 to get drinks.  Lastly, when we arrived, the table next to us was complaining about their order being incorrect.  It looked as though there was plastic in her food."}, {"review_id": "xOZsYenZ32gkm3f5byVTsA", "user_id": "wrZ81OY3ss8YpWSa4HgIYQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Thanks to Yelp I was able to score this spot on a recent trip to the Springs. We had been adventuring all day and were hungry and wanting some beer. We popped in on a Friday right as HH was starting! What a great find!! The hubby had the Flip IPA and I had the Blue Nose Brown. Both great and only $6 for a giant 24oz mug!! We also tried the chicken wings. $5.50 for 6 of them. They were a good starter for the price. The ranch was too dill heavy for my tastes, but still enjoyed them. My son opted for the burger and fries from the HH menu. At $7 this was a great deal and he enjoyed it. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich. I got it fried. Although it was messy, it was delicious. The waffle fries were good also. My husband got the chicken and waffles and said they were delicious. Good flavor. We would definitely come back here, especially for HH. Our service was super friendly and on point."}, {"review_id": "o3NjPkq3mYo2kWlT4_oqng", "user_id": "O_sG89BXizpf9jb1-us4kw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "We stopped by at this place on this weekend and not impressed at all. Good location! Nice to hang out place(for just some drinks & bar foods)! It was not very welcoming though! The bartender came out and take our orders(not friendly). One of the server brought the foods to our table (not friendly)! We ordered Sake marinated Salmon & BBQ plate. He asked how did we want the salmon cook? Ok I don't know if anyone prefers their salmon \"Rare\"? \"The sake marinated salmon\" sounds fancy but very disappointing! Pretty much plain noddle with alittle bit of vege. Salmon was small, no flavor, just plain! Not even looking attractive! The BBQ plate looks good but too sweet and fatty with thick, chunky bone !"}, {"review_id": "mlfF0pPvBNfxsIYuxGgezg", "user_id": "bKUTEYOCycGwuC-OO24iZw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "I really like Odyssey.

All restaurants sometimes make mistakes; sometimes run out of things or something else, your job as a patron is to inform them or their manager if they don't address the situation.  However Odyssey is a five start location because they work for perfection every visit.  Our example of their attention is early on we ordered a French Rose wine, we asked for a sample and they came back with a half of a glass.  Our server told us this was the last of this wine and we were more than welcome to enjoy it but need to select another option.  Our server quickly noticed our minor disappointment and called over the manager.   The manager explained that they were changing out their wine list on Monday and offered a couple of suggestions.  He offered us another sample of a white wine and it was good.  This is what makes a five star establishment at a consistent level. Warning, don't come as a walk in expecting to find a seat immediately during peak times.  However, if you do encounter a wait time, it is well worth it."}, {"review_id": "rKIizf_0vdf4MqXiAQvg9A", "user_id": "fEpGooV1MPAW0IJW3Er-9Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Super fun evening, service was excellent!

My first experience was waiting for a table with a friend with several other small parties. We were the first ones there and the others filed in after us. The manager decided to let those waiting order something to drink by handing out menus. He would give menus to our people on our left and our right, but completely skipped us. I had to ask if I can see a menu because we did not get one, he didn't say anything and just handed me one rudely. Tonight my husband and I came in and there was a \"seat yourself\" sign, so we sat at the bar. We got one drink and let the bartender know we decided to sit at a table to eat, so we cashed out and moved to the table behind us. We sat there for 15 minutes and we were completely ignored. One server took two steps toward us and saw our drinks, then walked away assuming we had already been helped. I looked around to get anyones attention for a few minutes, but we decided to finally leave. If there was not a \"seat yourself sign I would have not just taken a table. I should not have to chase down someone to tell them we want to eat.

I specifically came for the chicken and waffles based on reviews. They didnt disappoint although I will say they are not the best Ive had (nor even the best in Colorado). However, I have super high standards for chicken and waffles. But they were very good. Chicken was seasoned well and crispy. Waffles were sweet and fluffy. Served with strawberries, blueberries, guajillo butter and maple syrup. The butter was a good additive and overall they were a good balance of sweet and savory. My husband got the po boy sandwich and it was good. He got it with fried catfish. I tried it and it was indeed very good. The service was a little lacking but it was just one guy tending a group at the bar and a few other tables so understandable. We were there around 2 in the afternoon for reference. The atmosphere was fun and modern. Had an industrial vibe. We didnt come for drinks, nor get any drinks so I cant comment on that. Parking is meteted on the street but theres a small lot behind the building where we parked for free. Overall it was a good experience and we will be back. There were quite a few other things on the menu that looked good that I want to try!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/odyssey-gastropub-colorado-springs?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
