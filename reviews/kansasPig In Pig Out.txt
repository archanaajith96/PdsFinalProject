Came just on the yelp review.  the place smelled great and had ambience. To our surprise about ready to close no more ribs so we  ordered 3 of the 2 meat plates told them to use leftovers, brisket & pork. It is fabulous. A real find. You will drive to get here yet worth it. Love both sauces even the heat is mild & sorry you guys I like the mild."}, {"review_id": "3YB7tGYW8ung7Cw4MkcTlg", "user_id": "qCiwUAy_TOZ-rh5qk8HxGw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/20/2017", "text": "I have a new favorite Wichita BBQ spot. Walking in this place produces a Pavlovian response that may be better than porn. Pulled pork was excellent. Brisket was perfect - which is rare. Because brisket is the mark of good BBQ. The beans were good - not incredible, but good. And their sauce is uniquely delicious.

After B & C Barbecue. This place has descent ribs, good links, flavorful briskets, fast service and welcoming people. Since BC BBQ is only open for 3 hours a day this will be my go to when in Wichita. Next will be Bite me BBQ then I will reorder the the rankings.

We came in about an hour before closing. I am not surprised that they were out of ribs; if you go to any BBQ joint late in the day you know they're going to be out of stuff. But both the meats and the sides weren't very warm.So go here at lunch and you'll probably have a better meal than I did. My colleague found himself apologizing for taking me there because if you're there too close to closing time, they're not at their best.EDIT: the folks at Pig In Pig Out reached out to apologize and to say they intend to serve people good stuff no matter what time you come in. I'm adding a star for that. And while it's probably going to be awhile before I come back to town, I will give them another shot. They seemed to genuinely appreciate the feedback."}, {"review_id": "R9c1LXyaxROnVLeIsjJb5w", "user_id": "rlDDkE6G-nMO-z0hNqekzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Latitudinally speaking, Wichita is north of Austin, Memphis, and the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel HIlls Triangle, but it's also south of Kansas City and St. Louis. Somewhere along I-35 between Joe's KC Barbecue and Franklin's Barbecue (or Arthur Bryant and Stubb's, if you'd prefer) the passion for great barbecue fizzles a bit. That's not to say Wichita isn't a town that loves their smoked meat, just as there are countless other cities south of the Mason-Dixon that are peppered with their own smattering of shacks and shanties with twirls of smoke lazily drifting towards the sky at all hours of the day, but it's not something that defines us. Wichita's barbecue scene is largely dominated by local chains, though every year there are another few individuals who try to make their way into the conversation. One of the oldest and most well-regarded barbecue restaurants in the city, Pig In Pig Out, started in a small restaurant on south Hydraulic across from Linwood Park in 1995, moved to 13th Street in 2004, and has been doing nothing but churning out competition-level meats the entire time.PIPO's pulled pork is the gold standard against which all Wichita 'cue is measured, and it comes down to a matter of fat and seasoning, both of which are provided in ample amounts. Too often at visits to other restaurants the pork is served too lean, which causes a dry and chewy texture. The skin and fat is also where all of the seasoning is applied, so by keeping some with the rest of the pork on my plate I get a pulled pork that's flavorful and moist enough to not need any of the sweet Kansas City-style barbecue sauce that's  on the table. Served by itself or with a few pickles in a buttered bun, it's as good as it gets.Pulled pork aside, the other competition winner, judging by all of the ribbons on the wall, is the ribs, and it's easy to see why: a sharply-seasoned golden brown crust, crispy from caramelization and the Maillard reaction, rendered fat that melts as soon as it meets the heat of your mouth, and tender meat that doesn't fall off the bone (which is frowned upon in competition barbecue circles), but pulls cleanly away once you bite into it. There's absolutely no flaws to be found in the ribs, and if they're available, you should get them.I've come to accept that fatty brisket can't seem to escape the state lines of Texas, but PIPO's version is fall-apart tender with more moisture than I would have expected and just a little bit of chew in the back of the mouth. Turkey is treated exceptionally well here: smoky, seasoned well, and pillowy soft. The homemade red hots have a nice snap when you bite into them, an interior that's not too mealy, and a little spicy kick on the back end.The selection of sides is pretty standard, with a few exceptions. The macaroni and cheese is a surprising standout, again besting similar ilk at competing restaurants. The difference is in the thickness of the rich cheese sauce and the way it clings to the pasta without pooling at the bottom of the plate. Not overcooking the noodles helps, too, though the use of penne here is sub-optimal due to the size of the pasta's holes. If you're looking to overload on cheese the corn casserole is surprisingly a better option; taking a cheese-based sauce and swapping noodles for vegetables makes it feel healthier, though only in very relative terms.  Even a bag of Wichita's own MSG- and sugar-rich barbecue Art and Mary's chips work better here than you might expect. The best barbecue is served with a little down-to-earth ambiance, and it's here where PIPO makes the difference. Their location at the intersection of several different working class neighborhoods (as well as easy I-135 access) ensures a wide variety of clientele - a recent visit saw businessmen, construction workers, and high schoolers filling up the dining room. In that same dining room on many days there will be a man and a guitar singing the blues. Sitting in the small wooden chairs and taking all of this in while eating the food, you don't need the dozens of ribbons hanging on the walls to tell you that this is the best barbecue in Wichita."}, {"review_id": "Yy-0hHNG8lTCVjS_Xbf_1Q", "user_id": "xMgikYHGTtD5uFsoWpeUiQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/16/2017", "text": "My all time favorite BBQ.

I ordered the three meat plate (sadly no ribs) with brisket, hot link, and pulled pork. Since I will be eating here every time I come to Wichita for work, it might be good that the ribs were out so I could try the other meats. The brisket and pulled pork were so tender and had the perfect amount of smoke. The hot link was spicy and incredibly tasty. Tough to tell which meat I enjoyed the most. There are two choices of BBQ sauce on the table - I liked the one in the red bottle the best. Mac and cheese and beans for the side item were delicious. And who can complain about a good slice of Texas toast?  This place definitely sits comfortably in the top 3 of BBQ places across the nation!"}, {"review_id": "mhi2aGoCCgBGbk6J2CVv0Q", "user_id": "HaJlrVjGl5e22bT4U8zd2w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/9/2017", "text": "This is some of the best bbq I have ever had.

The last 3-4 times I've gone, it has been extremely disappointing. Maybe it's because the last few times I've gone it's been during non-peak times of the day, but to me that's not an excuse. The food was barely warm, the mac 'n cheese was VERY runny, and the cobbler was room temperature. To top it off, the place was filthy. The tables were dirty, the condiment bottles were greasy and disgusting, and the floor was sticky.

I didn't know what to order so I got the 1/4 pound pulled pork sandwich, with a hot link, and potato salad. Since it was my first time here they threw in a rib for free I must say I haven't finger licking good food in a long time. I had a dry rub rib that would have been ruin with any sauce, and the buttered bun that went well with pulled pork, and then potato salad taste just like if my mother made it.If you're down on 13th street please stop by and give these guys a try...
