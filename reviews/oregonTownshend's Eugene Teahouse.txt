Such an excellent selection of teas and everyone is so helpful! I love their variety of chais and oolong teas the most. Also, it's a super chill atmosphere to be in when you're with friends, or just need a place to do some work or read a book. Wish we had one closer than a 5 hour flight , but luckily whenever I run out in between trips I can order online :)"}, {"review_id": "DzKE_AJyUYGlDZOrGgtP3Q", "user_id": "8n6_-W8fwE6j-oSM_lDr6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Amazing tea house in downtown Eugene.  We stopped in on a rainy Friday night right before closing.  The staff was super chill -- they let us take time to explore the extensive selection of teas and didn't rush us through the ordering.  The space is great: traditional table-and-chair seating along with sofas and coffee tables and easy chairs.  Just a wonderful, relaxed vibe throughout."}, {"review_id": "if7-tTVubKXIa2Yy7zKslg", "user_id": "gbak6CfHdEp7qMcBgncInA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/20/2017", "text": "Very cute little tea shop with TONS of teas to choose from. The menu was actually a little overwhelming, but I had the woman working recommend one for me. I told her I like sweet but not overly sweet and she recommended the Mango Mist. It was an excellent iced tea that I got half sweetened. I really appreciated how friendly she was, especially as a first time visitor. This was a perfect spot to get tea and chat with friends. I will for sure be back to try some other flavors!"}, {"review_id": "Snc2v1VtRpjInhqwGJJmGw", "user_id": "Kzc-g02gyJSCVKuFMacUhg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/9/2017", "text": "This place had such good deals and Thai ice tea that I went back two days in a row. Everything was way cheaper than Starbucks and pretty much every similar drink in California. They don't even charge more for boba or extra soy milk, and they have plenty of alternative milk choices for those avoiding dairy.Seems like a cool place to kick back for a while. There are comfy sofas, and you don't have to wait at the counter to collect your drink. Instead you take a number and have a seat. Overall it reminds one of a large living room.The employees are knowledgeable and friendly. My only issue: The drinks aren't sweet enough IMO. I had to add a ton of honey and simple syrup to bring it up to my taste. This is probably a practical way to serve them as everyone is different when it comes to sugar, but maybe they could offer different sweetness levels as they do at most boba shops."}, {"review_id": "PcUncociMM6A051-yGG25g", "user_id": "vfUvHnqXndhTqMEDigY2mA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "For someone who has grown up in San Jose aka, boba shops around every corner, this place was a major letdown. I've tried my fair share of boba shops in the Eugene area, and Townshend was just meh. The milk tea tasted quite powdery, and the boba was hard. I would rather just stick to drinking their normal hot/cold teas. Besides the tea, the environment of the shop is nice. Definitely a place for college students to go and study!"}, {"review_id": "JEzKDaxrjKz8G5pVRIG9TA", "user_id": "TBfVzrRtP48lN-Cbj4oWcA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "I am really not a big fan of tea but I was invited to meet here today and so I agreed.

To be honest, I'll probably keep returning. I just have to say (and I do mean this from a genuine heart), why is the customer service here always subpar? I feel like everyone is miserable to be working here. I've yet to experience someone greeting me in a happy manner. It's awkward and tepid, which makes me feel out of place and unwelcome. I want so badly to love this little gem of a place, but I struggle with the weird vibes from people. I get customer service is hard. I did it for years, and i still do it in healthcare. I just want a smile and a warm welcome. I'm kind and I tip well, so that doesn't seem like too much to ask.  I'll keep returning and hoping... cheers."}, {"review_id": "K5vjgh-nAsRrMPyhMSeLgw", "user_id": "_5f0aOXWuPUJWg1FiCxt3Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/23/2016", "text": "A friend suggested we go here because he has been before and said that it was worth going to.

But names aside, this ultra modern spot has some of the best variety of teas the city has to offer and a spacious setting for folks looking to lounge or work.What a glorious interior. Spacious with high ceilings, solid decor, and big windows for a solid street view. Seating is easy with their various two seaters, comfy couches, and lounge chairs to add to the relaxing vibe. WiFi signal is strong, the bathrooms are clean, and the music is perfect for the ambiance. People are super nice here. Their team is courteous and polite, all while super efficient when it comes to making the drinks. There is always a crowd here almost during any time of the day, so a little patience comes a long way if one is looking to stay and sip as many folks are strictly come and go.Their tea selection is particularly impressive. I appreciate that they have their tea leaves on display for folks to make an educated decision on what to order. Whether it's hot or cold or even powder based (?) bubble tea, they seem to have all the tea bases covered. There is also a limited selection of pastries for those who want to snack and teaware (kettles, pots, cups, leaves, etc.) for purchase.For folks who are looking for a change from the coffee life, Townshend's is a tea-riffic alternative."}, {"review_id": "DRVYqI52NdJwpipw3_soWQ", "user_id": "be9kgcNETOfozSaRQG3x3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/7/2017", "text": "Delicious!

Eugene happened to be a good somewhat halfway point with plenty of options. Tea was the perfect pick since it was the late afternoon and we didn't want to be too wired from a coffee.My husband has been on a kombucha spree as of late and was excited to see they had several options on tap. I went a different route with some bubble tea. I've never had the option to build my own bubble tea - sure I've picked flavors, iced / hot, and boba / jelly. Now I can pick my tea too? Sure, why not. It was slightly confusing at first but it tasted good and hit the spot. We were still awake when we completed the drive and were able to sleep soundly that night. Overall a win. 4 stars."}, {"review_id": "1Cjdad0UAAn0Q4FQlEmsIA", "user_id": "QGY0yPTlyKCxkqBCGSamDw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2017", "text": "I have always always loved this place, their Matcha Latte with rice milk never disappointed me all these years. Will I venture out and try something else? Yes, someday, but for now, matcha will do.I have had too many visits here to recount everyone, but I would like to share my last one: Came in here on a very busy day, there was a long line and people were sharing the couches, which is not something I see very often. My companion and I each ordered a cup to go, because we had somewhere to be after. As a loyal Townshend customer, I understood the brewing time takes longer and I am more than happy to wait longer for my drink. But this time, it took well more than 15 minutes. After seeing how another customer who was here later than us has gotten her drink, we went up and asked about our order... Surprise, they missed our order. Talk about perfect timing. NOT. We were definitely frustrated, it was another 10 minutes of waiting for us, altogether, we have waited for half an hour for two cups of tea. I finally went up again and ask about our drinks, just in time for one of the employees to hand me our drinks, along with two vouchers for a free drink. It was a rare occasion when I had issues with the service - staff members are usually friendly and efficient. I certainly appreciate the way they had apologized for our experiences in forms of free drinks. Needless to say, there's more Townshend for me in my future!"}, {"review_id": "3HG8lB21xuHx9on1V0ZSOA", "user_id": "ZbE5dC5AidDGyXaGaJ_9yA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/20/2017", "text": "Fun little hangout spot to grab a bit of tea and chat with some friends.

I came here to get some studying done in the afternoon, and I had been to one of the Portland locations before, but had not tried the boba. I got the matcha milk tea with pearls and it was delicious, the pearls were soft and chewy and sweet, the tea itself was not too sweet, and it was reasonably priced at $3.75 for 16oz, $4.75 for 24. There are some couches and some little tables and lots of people were hanging out or studying using the free wifi. Great spot with delicious chai lattes and bubble tea!Update-came here again to study on a Sunday afternoon and got original milk tea with peach flavor and pearls and it was also good! A tad bit on the sweet side, but the peach flavor is nice and strong."}, {"review_id": "nlXFRKAvGpzzxntEcZc6tw", "user_id": "NvgLT6vY-S0tfLtFhbUzUQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/5/2017", "text": "Perfect place for a vegan bubble tea!Their Thai iced tea is sweet but not too sweet, and despite the fact that coconut milk is usually thin, this one was perfectly creamy.
