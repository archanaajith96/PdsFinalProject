Luckily, it wasn't like either of those for me.I sat at the bar and was serviced pretty quickly. Roberto, the bartender, was great! He was friendly and attentive.I had the pimento cheese appetizer, the classic cheeseburger and the bourbon blueberry smash. Everything was terrific, especially the burger.The decor here is also very trendy, cozy and modern.All in all I enjoyed this establishment and will definitely come back!"}, {"review_id": "cA0qubeOY8V_pevPerFNmw", "user_id": "skFw-hYJHT3Po0oE-WLbEA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "I heard raves about Northstar and it did not let me down!  Northstar is probably the nicest \"fast casual\" ordering style restaurant I have ever been to. Place your order at the counter and your food will be brought to you. Otherwise, it feels like a trendy, upscale cafe. I was with a large group. It was nice that we were able to pay separately but our food was put on one number so it would arrive together.  I ordered a carrot juice and a Buddha Bowl with Tofu. The Bowl has lots of \"bright vegetables\", brown rice, as well as the tofu, with a peanut sauce. Besides being healthy, the dish was delicious! Other items ordered at our table included the Townsfair Salad and the Pizza.  Everyone enjoyed their items. I loved the healthy but flavorful choices on the menu, but I did think it was a bit limited. Northstar does what they do really well, but I would love to see some more choices on the menu.  Yes am sure I will return on my next visit to Easton!"}, {"review_id": "HBU3Scl7nNCzDi-b23OCUg", "user_id": "AoFRi-4XknffP3RajTk7pg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "I'll say up front that the only lost star goes to prices.  I just have trouble spending as much, if not more, on breakfast than I would on eating dinner out. Now, onto the good stuff.  I was able to get parking in the Barnes & Noble lot as my meet up was at 10 AM, the same time the bookstore opens.  There were 5 of us - one had fortunately grabbed a table (booth).  The line was LONG, but moved rather quickly. When I get up to the register along with one of my friends, all I wanted to my coffee.  I said as much and handed over my credit card ($3 for coffee) - but the cashier said that she couldn't charge me if I was just getting a drink.  #WINNER!She handed me a nice, large, heated mug.  It felt good in my hands as it was cold outside.  The beverages (soda, coffee) were self- serve.  They had 3 regular coffee blends and one decaf.  I went for the decaf - and ended up refilling it 2 times.The last time I was there, I was feeling adventurous and ordered the Organic Carrot Juice.  I had never tried carrot juice before.  $5 experiment.  I was able to drink it all - quite possibly for the sole reason that I had paid $5 for it - but I will NEVER drink carrot juice again.  I'm guessing their juice was fine - my pallet just did not appreciate it.My friends got pancakes, a frittata, and sweet potato hash.  They all thoroughly enjoyed their plates, the costs of which ranged from $11.50 - 14.00 I think.We stayed about 2 hours and the place was packed the entire time.  Clearly a popular breakfast and lunch spot at Easton.Will I return?  Maybe - if my group of friends wants to come back, I enjoy their company and will follow them most anywhere."}, {"review_id": "vKTvCTXMDsZVhn_cIWDX_A", "user_id": "tCB2hKtG7ta6L341vF6LJg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "I was here a few days before Christmas.  It was snowing.  There was a fire burning in the outside fireplace.  Did the Malhame Brothers think about the carbon offsets for THAT?I jest.  I guess that's covered by the general mea culpa on the website:\"We realize that we are not able to have a totally sustainable and harmless business, and we have an obligation to mitigate the damage that we cause.\"Again, I jest.  But I think I might try that sort of walk around mea culpa for myself.  \"I realize that I am not totally sustainable, in fact I've probably burned down a few square miles of the Amazon by myself and am largely to blame for the Pork Bellies Futures crash of 1999 and I'm not totally harmless, like, really, don't sneak up on me, I have a carry conceal license for a reason, but I do have an obligation to mitigate the damage I might cause.\"  So as long as I say I FEEL BAD for using up so many resources and donate money to worthy causes, I'm good to go, right? I almost ordered a black bean burger because the pressure was palpable to hurry up and order once the dude at the door shoved a menu into my hand.  Volume dining, stand in line, know my order, act like I've been here before and know what do do.  Except if I don't because I'm maybe an old or dimwitted person--or just don't plain follow traffic patterns well.  Any or all of those fit me.  I was ready to order the Northstar Burger until my sister pointed out that it was MEATLESS.  Not only is it meatless, its anti-meat--black beans, brown rice, and beets.  That seems like a bad day in the chemistry lab to me.  With her gentle guidance, I found the Classic Cheeseburger.  I like that word Classic.  It infers antiquity and Doric columns and all of that staid, boringness of eating a burger my grandparents fought wars over.  Yep, that's the one I wanted.The children found tables for our group on the second level.  I like climbing stairs like I like migraines and getting stung by jellyfish--but once I got there and got over not having a soda station up top, which I found to be somewhat unfair, I enjoyed being out of the way and being able to look down onto socially conscious people gnoshing on their blackbean burgers and kale pancakes or whatever the special was.  Rarely, do I get a chance to do THAT. My burger came and put an end to all of that snarky What Am I Doing Here stuff.  Perfectly cooked.  Covered in sharp cheddar.  The onions were a tad sharper than I'm used to, so I leveled them right off the bun.  The other small revelation was the spunky breakfast potatoes.  Tasty, spicy and a welcome offset to my perfect, classic cheeseburger.  I think there might be something to their emphasis on organic meats.  The meat is sourced from the Niman Ranch and when you scoot over and take a look at that, you will find hogs in little hog hotels, munching on pad thai and swilling La Croix before being led to the Big Burger In The Sky building.  Works for me.  Christmas shopping in the snow, eating lunch at the Northstar Cafe--say--I might could call this place the Star of Bethlehem Cafe, right?"}, {"review_id": "o6wjzSklqvqcUBoQxj070A", "user_id": "o5dI2Ozw_IgYsoH6x9RPOQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "A quick stop on a Sunday morning for a drink and bite to tide us over.

I will start by saying this when I moved to Columbus in 2014 this was the first place I tried for brunch. Ummm I liked it but I prefer lunch/dinner. When I tried their lunch menu I was like ding, ding, ding, ding we have a winner. My favorite meal is the grill fish sandwich. I absolutely love it and never feel guilty eating it. I recently moved back home to Atlanta (Yayyyy) and Northstar is one place I miss. So of course when I go back I stop by.

It opened one in Easton some time ago. This has pretty much the same menu as the others. It has many healthy and local items. This one isn't as busy as the first location, which is the best thing. I had the Buddha Bowl. It's about $11, which is kind of much but it has lots of stuff packed into it. The tofu is seasoned nicely and it's surrounded by fresh vegetables. It is a filling meal. The rest of the menu features items familiar to the other locations and a few that are only for there. If you go to Easton and want to eat something, try Northstar.

Metal and wood tones everywhere. The open air, brightly lit space is extremely cozy and just damn right awesome, imo. This first visit was meant to meet Anna H. for their annual free veggie burger on Earth Day. Unfortunately, long story short, that wasn't going to start till 3pm. Bummer. We went ahead and had brunch here, anyway. Yes, I habitually seem to always get the same darn dish when stopping by a Northstar in the earlier half of a day: Mushroom Frittata. I failed to branch out, and went with the same dish here. I wasn't sure if it could be done, but went ahead and asked if I could get it with egg whites only. Sure, no problem!The homemade biscuit was still warm, of course fluffy, when dishes were brought to our table. Their homemade (blackberry?) jam smeared on? If I was on a carbs diet, whelp, this sucker would chuck me up to the utopian state. Frittata was good, even with no yolk. Man, the melted cheese on the entree is heavenly. The side of potatoes were over seasoned, but not enough to speak up. Overall, this is a great Northstar to add to their repertoire. The second-floor seating looks awesome, note to self for next time.

It's my second time coming here and it seriously gets better each time. So good, that I ordered the same thing both times. I love everything about this place - the service is awesome and the indoor/outdoor seating is super cozy and unique (in a good way). I got the Northstar burger. Oh man, I don't have anything bad to say about it. I love that it's full of flavor and is big enough to spill over onto your plate, so you can eat more after you've devoured your burger. Not only that, but the sauce flavor pulls the whole burger together and brings all of its flavors to life. SO good. The side salad - also delicious. I wish there were more croutons in it because I just can't get enough! My fiancé got the soup, which was a cashew cauliflower, and the Townsfair salad. He and I loved both. If you like cauliflower, you'll love the soup. He also raved about the salad and managed to finish the whole thing. We were both super stuffed. Also, the wedge of bread that came with was the perfect amount to dip in the soup. It was soft and fresh, but had good substance. I cannot wait to come back here. Maybe, just maybe, I'll order something else next time :)."}, {"review_id": "kg5-R_vzZFcCD16pzq94NA", "user_id": "zqZ7G8WsXY_bSrcAJC_HkA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/21/2017", "text": "I came here for brunch.

Many people I come with love their burgers-- I prefer the chopped salad for lunch. Portions are generous and prices are $$Location:It's within the Easton shopping center, so pretty ease to get to. There is parking right next to the building that is free and parking on the road is paid by meters. Tables are good size, I don't feel like I'm eating on top of the person next to me.
