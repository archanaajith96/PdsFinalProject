I came here a lot while I was pregnant and wanted their nachos and bread pudding all the time. And now, with our little one, we come here often for their new brunch service. All that to say - the food here is good. The beer is varied enough that even if you don't think you like beer, you'll probably find a beer here that you will like. It's that kind of place.  They are also very baby friendly - big tables, large enough space for strollers and/or car-seats, and they don't mind if you nurse your baby. And! they have changing tables - eclectic ones, but changing tables nonetheless. A family favorite."}, {"review_id": "SgaH_qW45-NqvF4Nr0zsaA", "user_id": "A1iCriMhJUlXLAXttC_MFw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Located on the north end of the Corktown area, in a formally run down section that is becoming trendy, at a slow pace. Outside they have their own parking lot, and a patio next to a boxcar. Inside is a large open bar room and bar/serving tanks. A nice selection of beers, including those they don't usually make available. Good food, in particular the pasties and fried risotto balls. The pretzels are also made fresh, and are both soft and flaky.The staff was polite and knowledgeable. Only the bar area has service, so people sitting at tables must go up to the end of the bar. By the time we left there was a line.

We opted to sit at the bar after being informed that it was full service.  Good thing we did as it got packed and you had to step up to get orders.  They have a deck that will be great in the summer and lots of seating inside.  Service was friendly.  Food is not quick and seems made to order.  (It's good- but not sure what you should get if you are starving.) Flights and tastes available by type (prices vary).  Wide array of beers from IPAs, kolsch, Pilsner, weissen, sours.  I particularly enjoyed the blood orange and Berliner Weiss (minus extra juice that was supposed to make it \"moscato-ey\".) For food we opted to try pretzels, fried risotto balls (seasonal- asparagus and veg), and the seasonal pasty (just made that day!!!) the pasty was Mediterranean with a tasty Tzatziki sauce.  Pretzels made to order and flaky and light.  The cheese was pretty mild and in this case I preferred the mustard. Risotto balls very tasty, a bit tastier with hot sauce minus the pesto sauce. The pasty, you get two smaller ones and we shared.  Lastly- tried the bread pudding dessert with a whiskey sauce and caramel corn.  Very good, huge serving, couldn't finish!"}, {"review_id": "kCXistMQNaGi4ZISH31NGQ", "user_id": "XP5hqB6A9rvXlH_LHtzUgA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "Stopped here before a Pistons game and it was pretty packed. We were very fortunate to have been able to find a table. It is also a very kid and family friendly place which is always a plus. We ordered a flight of beer and they were all very tasty. I've been to about over 100 breweries and I choose not to review them on yelp. This place I chose to because of...well...their food! Although their beer was good; the tacos we ordered definitely hit the spot. We ordered their pretzels for my son, my wife ordered a grilled shrimp taco and a grilled fish taco. I ordered mine both with fried shrimp. I will admit the grilled shrimp was my favorite one. They come with a side of chips and pico de Gallo. The tacos themselves had Pina mango salsa cabbage and chipotle cream. Mamma way were they delicious. I always hit Lafayette when I'm in town and now I just added another spot."}, {"review_id": "MsUBqBrUqFGpRkxFY03HwA", "user_id": "qvLkSdGQ0gNu5Pa9XhBX6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Great food and very creative, you can see the brewery right there.

They brew really, really small batches and thus, their menu changes constantly. This time around (I'm not sure if it's a consistent offering), along with regular beers, they had a beer slushie. It was made with a peach-flavored beer and had to have more peach added--it was so good and perfect for a sunny day! It tasted mostly like a peach slushie, with just a hint of hoppy beer. Regarding their normal beer, they offer regular pint size servings for you can build-your-own flight. It is cool that you can do that, but it is also overpriced for the amount you get--it's $2-$3 per 4 oz poor. Their typical flight holder has five slots, so that could ring you up to $15 for 20 oz of beer. A suggested (and discounted) prepared flight would be nice.We also tried their strawberry rhubarb bread pudding. It was soft, sweet, and had some crusty goodness. Only thing is we had no idea where the rhubarb went...it was all just strawberry. We split it between two, but it could definitely feed four after having a meal. They have a bunch of 2+ player games that you can bower while hanging out, which is fun. They have their own parking lot, but there is plenty of nearby street parking as well. There was a little bit of a line when we arrived, but it moves fairly quickly."}, {"review_id": "XKIN8WbTRDgiQFvI8OQcPA", "user_id": "zWGj3oOA_X8QPho_l5BRKg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "I dig this place.

Had to try it, LOVED IT.  We did a flight with;Dicksmasher (imperial stout with anise)Low End Theory (imperial blank IPA with carmel)Harold (deep golden season with citrus)Anton's Animals (sour berline style kettle with raspberry)Punxsutawney (pale ale)Pepparkakor (dark saison with molasses and ginger)All of the beers were excellent.  I am not a fan of sours and I liked it quite a bit.  I can't pick a favorite, they were all that good.  What I love most about Batch is the sheer variety and quality of their beers.  There is something for everyone and everything is excellent.  Great for groups!See you soon!!!"}, {"review_id": "JcAjR_5NB_BA_Rs0fI565A", "user_id": "mVNy0fvboAEg0CkqTjQncA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Best bread pudding EVAH! and changes flavor every so often.

It is the magical unicorn of a sandwich and will have you feeling the hot breeze of being on the beach in Cuba (or at least Miami) coupled with a soft hint of cigar smoke and rum in the air, while watching Hemingway write The old man and the sea. My favorite sandwich in metro detroit. But much like trying in vain to catch a snipe on a camping trip, good luck in your lesson in futility. The WORST thing about it is that they seem to rarely have it... Cuba-NO. I've recently only been able to acquire it once out of my last 7 visits.  They sell out. Stand at the door upon opening. Camp out overnight perhaps. 5 stars for everything. 4 stars just out of shear frustration.

I ordered a flight along with the chorizo dip and fish tacos. My dining companions ordered the pretzels, veggie sandwich, and Caesar salad. Everything was quick, hot if it needed to be, and incredibly fresh. Things were seasoned well and very reasonably priced. The communal dining experience is really cool, as is the open concept where you can see all the brewing equipment. They also have a lovely outdoor dining space. I wouldn't hesitate to dine at Batch again. Although I feel their beer could use some improvement (in this case, mainly the temperature because I felt our beers were served a bit too warm), I think they've got a great thing going. I appreciate they offer a variety of different styles, and that their taps aren't completely dominated by big ABV and fad-driven, super hoppy beers.
