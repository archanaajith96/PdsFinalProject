Really really good burgers. Ring of fire burger is apparently super spicy but delicious. I ordered fungus amongus and it was really tasty. The burger patty was juicy and was cooked just about right. We ordered salad to go with and it was not a \"side\" salad but more of a full plate. Service was fast and our waitress was super helpful. Almost definitely worth the visit! Looking forward to next ski season so we can go back."}, {"review_id": "Em-zZqe6bO8GMyPiaUyLTw", "user_id": "rIJKpZAY7MZ4HAtGJ97QqA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Just had a super piss poor experience.We stopped by venue because we know their reputation for good food. We had about 75 minutes before we had to catch a movie, so we thought we had time stop by. When we arrived, we were seated, so we thought this was a good sign.I ordered chips and salsa and a friend ordered their bacon cheeseburger. More than a half hour later, no chips and salsa had arrived. And the waitress comes to inform us that it'll be another 20 minutes for the food to be served.How is that possible? Fifty minutes total. The server says they need to change over the kitchen from the brunch menu to the afternoon menu. But how is it possible that chips and salsa were delayed?We ask for our check because we have a movie to catch. And at the last second, after paying for the food and getting up to leave she throws down the chips and salsa. Really? Really? You couldn't had done that a half hour ago?Talk about poor management and service."}, {"review_id": "NjAOC-IwAUt5_DTCJmHZnQ", "user_id": "xdwb2VvRvyDoxNqOrmNvgg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "A few people suggested we try this place out if we were in the mood for a burger so we did. It was fine but I gotta say it wasn't great. The interior looks like any dive bar you can find in America and the person that sat us refused to consider taking us out to the much more pleasant patio even after we asked for it. Luckily someone else was able to put us out there and it was definitely the better choice. My friend ordered the Celestial Burger which was your pretty-standard barbecue bacon cheese burger and I got the Nutter Butter Burger because I like peanut butter and had never tried such a thing. Both burgers were a bit overcooked to our tastes and mine had too much peanut butter to be enjoyed (even though I would say the whole peanut butter thing was better than expected). We did discover a new summer cocktail we'd never heard - Dead Man's Boots with tequila and bourbon - of which we took to making in our hotel room for the rest of the trip."}, {"review_id": "peuvoHufFNAdw5z6Cb2fMg", "user_id": "3V_PnPYtmu-mLTE0n0Bv4A", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Overhyped and definitely not recommended.

Nasty people.D for the crowd - full of bros who like to yell, f* this sh* every other sentence.C for the burger - not bad, not memorable, not worth a second tripF for the beer - there is a chalkboard outside with so-called \"beer specials.\" When I asked the server to recap them, he told me they just put it out there for advertising but don't actually have them on tap. False advertising alert! What they have is what's on the permanent menu. A very limited selection of draft and mostly bottles."}, {"review_id": "-ozUflaAPOq_qiAe4sC8Iw", "user_id": "z-pVGf6neIiGMLOg4XomLg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "This restaurant has AMAZING  burgers! It is a must try restaurant in Salt Lake City if you are visiting the city. I enjoyed my burger which was the PigPen with a side of Rosemary-Garlic Fries. The burger was full of juicy beef patty, smoked bacon, grilled ham, caramelized onions, cheese and their Lucky 13 sauce top along with lots of fresh veggies. The fries were awesome too! My husband really indulged on his Ring of Fire burger with roasted Jalapeño and roasted Habanero! It was full of heat and juicy goodness. He also got the fried pickles which also was great. There were no disappointments here! Just a note...This place is very strict with the age limit so make sure you have your ID ready to show off.

He has more details than I'll put in the story so feel free to check his review out. Here are my problems.1. I tried to order off the lunch menu and was told I could only order Brunch (totally fine)2. Our waitress is completely MIA but shows up every 20 minutes to get us another beer/mimosa. 3. After 90 minutes (busy so I expected delays) our waitress says that she forgot to put in our brunch order and we need to order again... this time off the lunch menu. Even at this point I'm not too upset, I kinda wanted a burger anyway. She admits to the mistake so I'm chill. 4. Here is my BIG problem. Realizing that she screwed up and thinking we were going to tip her poorly, she completely shuts down and starts ignoring us (more than she was). She says she can't move our table ahead of other tickets even though we had been there for 2 hours at that point. 5. She gives up on the table and at hour 3, our food shows up. It's not like I remembered it and there taste isn't there like usual.I understand when mistakes happen and I'm very patient. My issue is that there was no effort to make things better, no rush on the food, a half hearted apology and then she became a ghost. We didn't complain to management, that's not my style. We were polite but we will not return. Too bad because I did enjoy this place."}, {"review_id": "HErRuIizpPz34tnMI_Jx4g", "user_id": "ex-JV8nrRucznn78wJxbng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This place is awesome! 21 +, with fresh fruit cocktails and outside sitting.

We came in for brunch and arrived early, about 11 a.m which was before our party, to get a few drinks at the bar. Everything went smoothly got a Bloody Maria (Bloody Mary with tequila) which was great had a nice spice and good seasoning to it along with a few bottled beers. Party arrives 20 minutes later and everything went downhill fast. We sat at the \"party table\" which is basically a large shared table with another group which is fine. We ordered drinks and brunch. Unfortunately our drinks took forever to get to us the entire day. Which sucks compared to the bar which was almost instant. Also my second bloody maria came out totally bland and tasted like watered down tomato juice. Fast forward 1.5 hours filled with countless 10-20 minute wait times to get the drinks we ordered let alone finding our waitress to order them. Our waitress comes over and admits to screwing up and not putting in our order which she apologizes for and offers us free fries and chips to make amends. Thats all good people make mistakes. However, we now had to re order from the lunch menu since brunch had passed. So we all order our burgers where it just gets even better. I asked to get their Benny burger with the sauce on the side. ( A foot tall burger they offer as part of a challenge.) But im told they cant make any alterations to thoose burgers because its hard on the kitchen.... okay... which makes absolutely no sense especially for a bar thay is known for their burgers to make such a subtle adjustment.... anyway i say screw it  and get the fungus amongus burger. (also none of us were asked on how we'd like the burger cooked so we got well done for everyone.)Food finally arrives 3 long hours after our initial arrival so no ones happy. You'd think even with the screw up you'd put the order in on a rush or something so you dont have customers crossing a 3 freaking hour wait... Anyway on to the food .... Free fries and chips are underwhelming the sauce to dip them in was the best part. The burgers (fungus, pastrami, and loaded grilled cheese) all are under seasoned and tasted bland (again huge let down for a place known for their burgers). All in all on 4 visits here i haven't been impressed with the brunch or burgers and doubt I'll return."}, {"review_id": "HtT0LgGgTuM4Y7tmxO5amw", "user_id": "ybnRkTWKjh8crMelTT6CtA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "I have heard that this is the BEST burger joint in SLC from MULTIPLE people.

But really, these fries are amazing!!! Best burger? Yeah sure. But best fries?? Definitely!!!!Now for the burger. I'm usually quite the fire eater so I went with the Ring of Fire. It comes with jalapenos AND habaneros. The waitress asked if I wanted them on the side and I said nahh. Mistakes were made. Usually jalapenos aren't very hot, but these roasted ones were incredibly hot! Plus with the habaneros, I was definitely struggling. Took a while longer to finish the burger, but I survived. Worth it, the burger was SO delicious, and it burns so good!

I ordered the Ring of Fire burger which was super juicy and had the perfect amount of hear provided by the jalapeños and roasted habaneros in the burger. Their fried pickles and rosemary garlic fries were also delicious and added to our experience. We also drowned our food with shots of their Dia de Muertos which was sweet, tangy and tasty.

If we both had that garlic coursing through our veins it's no big deal. But if it's just me?  Yeah... that option isn't on the table.  So I chose the Fungus Amongus.  I ordered it at 3:08.  3 songs later it arrived in all its glory.  It was cooked perfectly medium.  PERFECTLY.  7 ounces of perfectly beefy beef beefiness.Tons of fries - really tasty.  When that burger comes, forget the small talk and devour the carcas so that soft toasted bun doesn't get soggy.  Yeah, that's right.  It's greasy.  You're eating a half pound of cow.  Your hands are gonna get shiny.  Your only problem may be finding a way to squeeze it into your pie hole without dislocating your jaws like an anaconda eating a kangaroo.For you dainty folk, there are lighter sandwich options.  Do they serve vegetarians?  OF COURSE.  What do you think cows are?  (Sorry, I couldn't help it) Actually, they do have a veggie burger and a chipotle black bean burger for those of you who discriminate against food that once had legs.  But hey, I try not to judge.Can't wait to come back with my wife so we can get our garlic on in Celestial proportions."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/lucky-13-salt-lake-city?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
