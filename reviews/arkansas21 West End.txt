I felt compelled to write a review as we did not experience good service we experienced phenomenal service.\"!! #Ryankilledit This restaurant was a spectacular choice (hubby did good) as OUR server Ryan rose above the usual robotic service that unfortunately one see's so often in higher end establishments. Restaurants should train their staff to be more natural as genuine dispositions are always sooo much more pleasant. Not to mention easier on the server, honesty works! #honestyisRAREtheseDAYSRyan's recommendations were spot on, easy to decide when the server is so transparent. Ryan, was attentive without being contrived or overly intrusive, Ryan was in all sense of the word an AUTHENTIC guy that personalized & catapulted our experience to the 10th Power! We will always recall Ryan's personality, dog owners have a way of connecting through our pets that most don't! The food was spectacular! Cocktails were pretty tasty! The architecture in this place is special, great photo opportunity! The mood lightening really set the tone, swanky feel although a very relaxed ambiance. I must admit the exterior surroundings made me a little skeptical ...once we entered the building it was pretty cool."}, {"review_id": "8ARsIfusxv7bT9bYBxS_PA", "user_id": "0zeV-jc98oKllocyY15jfA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Excellent restaurant.

This city of 85,000, on the Arkansas-Oklahoma border, grew up as a military outpost in the early 1800s. While in the area on business, 21 West End surprised us with its tastefully sophisticated atmosphere and unique menu offerings.  We expected friendly service here in the Deep South and we got it in spades from our gregarious server X who provided a great tour of the menu and the restaurant in general.  Based on the food, service, ambience and overall dining experience, I'm sure that 21 West End would thrive in our country's biggest markets like NYC, Chicago or the City of Angels. While enjoying a bottle of a 2012 Italian Barbera, our group of 4 split two orders of Cream Cheese Crab Cakes which were everything the Yelp reviews said they would be...light,delicate and very tasty with their signature chipotle lime aioli sauce. A few in our group enjoyed Spinach Salads prior to ordering our entrees which included an order of Blackened Salmon, a pair of Rosemary Roasted Chicken Breasts and a plate of their highly touted Cognac Pork Tenderloin.  I can personally vouch for the great cut of pork topped with their signature cognac Demi-glacé and caramelized pears served w/ roasted potatoes and chef's veggies...highly recommended. The whole 21-Town experience was over the moon...5 big ones."}, {"review_id": "9VGk-1kULoyhRw_ia65b9g", "user_id": "n7DbiZWzxiUmWcJU2s3s9A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Superb! My wife and I have eaten at this establishment on multiple occasions and every meal is stellar. Ambiance is calm, trendy, and conducive to a delicious meal. Whether it is their filet, pasta dish, or chicken you will not be disappointed. And don't forget about the creme brûlée it is out of this world. Their cocktail list is next to none...they have countless flavors of Martinis, their service staff is always friendly and attentive.

He offered us a gift card to return to 21 West End, and since we may not be visiting Arkansas soon, I asked if he could send it to the friend from AR that dined with us that night, and he happily complied.It's always lovely to see such great customer care and service. Things happen, people get busy and forgetful, and it's always understandable, especially when management take the time to really make their customers happy one way or another."}, {"review_id": "rddxyykZHyY_na0YSgYtzg", "user_id": "4_RON0t8pK6ijJnCZjUdtg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Omg .. i am from Ohio and had only 2 days in town.  I am so glad i found this amazing restaurant.  I had the filet meatballs app.  Which was fantastic.. barely had room for stuffed salmon which was even better!  Great staff, great wines n great ambiance !"}, {"review_id": "KpulS0NLLEs1sMZ2-i43BQ", "user_id": "ToI78gevUEJmMH3axdhUHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/7/2017", "text": "If you're in downtown Fort Smith Arkansas you need to eat here.

Thinking that downtown would be bustling on a Friday night I headed out with a recommendation from the hotel staff. Luckily the place they recommended closed early and I found 21 West End, instead!I stopped in for a late dinner, about 45 minutes before they closed, and I was NOT disappointed. I came in a side door and wound my way down some wooden stairs to the basement of the building and immediately I was reminded of a speakeasy. Staff was buzzing about finishing some holiday parties in other rooms as I approached the hostess stand.I enjoyed the cream cheese crab cake appetizer and blackened salmon. The crab cakes had a nice crust that didn't taste like they were fried. They were done just right with a soft flavorful center.The blackened Salmon was excellent. It was cooked just right and flaked as the fork went into the generous full portion, probably an 8-ounce filet. The vegetables including the potatoes, squash, and peppers were grilled to perfection.For dessert the staff recommended the creme brûlée. It too was very well done with a lightly caramelized sugary top and creamy custard.I don't typically leave reviews, but the food, atmosphere and ambiance, and staff made the restaurant one that I wanted to share. Definitely a place I'll come back to next time I'm in Fort Smith."}, {"review_id": "G8tvKFxzdyXBSFg0oCZrUA", "user_id": "sZ5RS1DsYCeO7KRaGbTVRw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/13/2017", "text": "A-FREAKING-MAZING!!!

We searched online for a great place to eat, and we definitely found it.We loved the atmosphere. Quiet, dark, and relaxing, with the perfect live music that didn't interfere with conversation. It's in a basement, which adds to the intimate ambiance.We started off with appetizers; Wellington Cigars, beef and mushroom duxelles hand rolled in a flaky phyllo dough. Served crisp with a snifter of sauce au poivre for the guys, and the special, a fried feta and cream cheese polenta with cranberry, portobello ragu, and a vodka rosa cream. Appetizers were amazing; I don't think a morsel was left on either plate. The polenta was outstanding -- the cranberry was a sweet accompaniment to the polenta.Entrees were equally as good. I cannot remember the last time I ordered pork in a restaurant; it's just not a favorite of mine. But I was tempted by the Cognac Pork Loin and absolutely loved it -- roasted pork tenderloin topped a cognac demi-glace and caramelized pears served with roasted potatoes and chef's vegetables. They had me at caramelized pears, I have to admit.Everyone enjoyed their entrees, and my daughter ordered the vanilla bean creme brulee, which I had a small taste of. Delicious and perfectly prepared.If you're in Fort Smith, go here. It's worth the trip. We were so pleasantly surprised to find such inventive food in northwest Arkansas.
