They have ample seating inside and out on the covered patio, and there's typically a food truck parked at the curb. Speed of service depends on how busy they are and during peak hours they are BUSY!  That's because of the beer. As I mentioned before, they make my favorite IPA, but their Malpais Stout is also one of my husband's favorite stouts. If you lean more towards a wheat beer, you can't go wrong with Slice of Hefen. All in all, La Cumbre is one of our favorite breweries. We rarely actually go there to have a beer because they are usually really busy, but I love that we can each get a 1/2 growler of our favorite beer to go at one location. Score!  Go to La Cumbre. Try the beer. I bet they will become a favorite!"}, {"review_id": "5K27CytlzZaqR9mqXr6c0A", "user_id": "ThVV7YYJPe6PtKjEfhf7ZA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "What's not to like about La Cumbre?My wife and I visit Albuquerque about once a year and while we love to try new places (especially breweries) La Cumbre is the one \"can't miss\" spot we return to each time.The staff is helpful and friendly, the interior is welcoming and the patio is great when the weather is nice.  With neat art and a variety of games, it's a relaxing place to enjoy a few tasty beers.  As a big plus they allow dogs both inside and out.They generally have a food truck out front and the pizza we had was outstanding.Without fail, every beer I've had from La Cumbre is top notch.  I'm partial to their Elevated IPA and Malpais Stout.  Since we don't get La Cumbre in Austin (yet?) I bring home a four pack of each."}, {"review_id": "8Gx8mTVCwevdpp475f99_w", "user_id": "xW54GTfLUtxmfbPpf11oDA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "The beer is fresh and new rotating styles on a regular basis.

I look forward to the different styles from the firkin and casks.

If you don't appreciate the smooth citrus aroma and balanced bitterness of this beer then I am sorry for you because you probably don't have the ipa gene. But you are in luck because the tap room always has some specials that will more than wet your whistle. The \"beer\" beer is another favorite when I am looking for a non bitter flavor. Overall the tap room is ok, moderately comfortable with a generally loud ambiance. But the beers, oh the beers. Usually there is a food truck out front so you shan't go hungry. All in all if you are at home and are looking for a place to hang and meet some fellow beer drinkers, this is a great place."}, {"review_id": "0CebPyiYQHmaIUaKkjroGg", "user_id": "QIy3iLXjBUBqRzwd2lnWGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/23/2017", "text": "LA CUMBREEEEEEE!!!They have delicious and amazing beers here! My gf has been to La Cumbre before, but this was my first time coming here and I was pleasantly surprised! The service here is fast. Just go up to the bar area and order whatever drinks you want. They have plenty of seats on the first floor including the patio area and they also have several tables upstairs that can fit plenty of people as well. During our visit they also have a food truck outside that was making sandwiches and it looked like pizza too. // BEERS //A Slice of Hefen: The perfect hefeweizen with hints of banana and cloves. Wheat beers are my favorite and this one is probably one of the best that I've had! It was so good I even bought some to take back to California with me! Elevated IPA: I'm not a huge fan of IPAs, but this one was pretty good in comparison to most other IPAs that I've tried. Elevated IPA has won many awards which is probably why this one is one of the more popular beers in the area. We bought some to take back to California as well and my friends that love IPAs said this was one of the best ones that they've tried! Overall, La Cumbre Brewing Company has great beers and a chill vibe. I wish they sold the beer back in California, but for now I'll savor the beers that I brought back with me. I will definitely be back to La Cumbre the next time I'm in Albuquerque!"}, {"review_id": "NEOI6NGrMMvGazFe9s6x1g", "user_id": "_NrV63wbwm-RKbZiq1P3EA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/6/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Ok here is my embarrassing I royally messed up updated review. This beer is amazing they are doing so many good things and experimenting with new items. You also just get the clientele that just loves beer and understands it. Not the typical I'll take the double white because it will get me wasted crowd (sorry marble still love you). Saturday's they do tours around 2pm I believe. We were having some beer out in the sun when one of their team members asked if we wanted to go along. Well hell yeah we do! It was so nice to see how much they care and their creativity and lastly love for brewing good beer. Their upstairs still stinks, sorry maybe not let dogs up there I know I love doggies too but they pee every where. I think I'm up to 22 check ins so obviously I love them deeply. From their standard menu try the pilsner refreshing and light. For heavy do the elevated IPA honestly one of the best IPAs in the nation. Trust me there's articles out there.

We were winding our day of seeing the sights in Albuquerque and wanted to relax and grab something light to eat.  I had researched this place for its quality of beer and that they often had good food trucks and thought this would be a good place.  The beer is very good, I had a flight of their top rated beers including: their top rated Elevated IPA ( a lofty 3.99 out of 5), Malpais stout, Red Ryeot, Project Dank, a Citrus IPA and Slice of Hefen.  These are way above the average you expect in most NM breweries. We also ordered from the food truck that is parked outside. We split the pork tenderloin that was marinated in the brewery's Fievre D'Abricot an apricot saison my wife order for her beverage. The sandwich had arugula and an apricot chutney that made it very good.  We also had their truffle parmesan fries which were exceptional. Beverages and Food - 5 stars - Hard to beat at most breweries. Service - 3-4 stars - Adequate nothing special from the Brewery the food truck does come find you!Atmosphere- 4 stars - Very comfortable and relaxed with people enjoying the inside and outside areas.  I have been to better that have games and larger spaces, tours, and etc. Price - 5 stars - I had a flight of six 4 oz beers for $12.  Considering the number and quality of the beer this would be hard to beat.  The food truck would be 4-5 star rating as well. Definitely a place I would frequent if only I lived here..."}, {"review_id": "d13MUUhRtqmn5PMJp96Ibg", "user_id": "wJ-lAqXvk-bp1joQ5aqGSA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2017", "text": "La Cumbre. What can I say besides I heart you. With all the breweries sprouting up throughout the duke city La Cumbre has long been a favorite of mine. I started indulging in their brews back in 2011 or perhaps it was 2010? My memory evades me. Anyway, over the years I have had many a great times here. I love the atmosphere and the of course the brews. The food trucks are always a pleasure too! I am pretty open to all the beers but I do gravitate to the ipa's and stouts. Those are my favs. At La Cumbre, I am an avid drinker of the Elevated and Project Dank. Both award winning beers as you may or may not know. They always quench my thirst! As with most any brewery in this town, you can expect them to be filled to capacity during the usual type of watering hole mingling hours but make a trip if you haven't already and get a flight to try all the treats. Bring some friends too. The more the merrier of course. There's more seating too since the front VIP parking area was converted to patio seating.
