The staff were friendly and actually Cuban, both of which were plusses. I took the gentleman who rung me up to be the owner. He really interacted with the customers and legitimately seemed to be excited to have us trying Cuban food and share his cultural heritage with us.I ordered the chicken lunch bowl. It was really tasty. Freshly grilled chicken with a delicious fried plantain on beens and rice. The flavors mixed well and were both vibrant without being too busy. I couldn't ask for better."}, {"review_id": "4GKbJ9-jzA0ds8p5Q2cfKA", "user_id": "uGL_eDiArn0Xbsv_elev2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "The owner was there so I asked him, \"What should I get?\" \"Everything! But if you can't eat everything, the Pan con Lechon (Thin cut of steak, caramelized onions, potato sticks, lettuce, tomato, and mayo).\" I thought he would have said \"The Cuban,\" as it was in the name and all... but he said, the \"Pan Con Lechon\" is better than any Cuban. He was right. I'm not always a pork fan and the port was marinated with savoriness. The dipping sauce (similar to an ai jus) gave the sandwich the perfect blind of a crunchy panini bread with moist flavorful pork and juice. Advice, when the owner recommends something in the restaurant, one ought to listen."}, {"review_id": "ZRc_7yH-q8ohwTNHM7Yoqw", "user_id": "rfDqKDpd1_B-VlkPDfHsqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "Yum yum. This is a cute little place located in the heart of broad ripple. We came about an hour before closing. We got 2 regular Cuban sandwich's and the rice, bean, pork mixture. The staff was friendly. The restaurant is clean and I love the decor. The food was really good. The sandwich was so filling I had to take the other half home. I could have went w the mini.

I've had Cuban style sandwiches at restaurants and they, while tasty, were nothing like the sandwich I gobbled up at Taste of Havana. The bread was perfect - thin and soft on the inside. There was so much meat (ham and roasted pork) and a thick slice of Swiss cheese with pickles and mustard. I ordered the middle size and after splitting a couple of pastries I still had 1/2 to take home. If that's not enough to make you want to go there, the service should be! The gentleman who took our order was a hoot and made us feel like regulars. He even brought out a delicious sweet, meat filled pastry! We also had a guava pastry - it was flaky and had almoa gummy like filling. It turns out I'm not a big fan of guava but I would definitely get one of the other kinds!"}, {"review_id": "dFdfoGCn6rmCfuCiDWyqsw", "user_id": "3f4por26XhZw6SpGehCjaw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Excellent restaurant, great food and friendly staff.  Sandwiches are made when you order.  Plenty of tables with great décor.  Definitely recommend going!"}, {"review_id": "tHNVLnDdqsOqgkfP7GuH5A", "user_id": "I-JKKX7PHHd_z9nNMkH6kg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "My first time visiting and it was wonderful! I've been meaning to come here and came with a small group to enjoy lunch. As my first time, I ordered the classic Cuban sandwich in the mini size.

The moment you walk in, it feels like you've traveled few hundred miles to Cuba. Phenomenal ambiance, comfortable furniture, and a delightful owner. We both ordered Cuban sandwiches and sweet plantains. Their regular sandwich is properly big. Meat was fresh and tender. Their bread is very crunchy and fragrant. Absolutely spot on!Sweet plantains were amazing. Caramelized to perfection and oh-so flavorful. I wanted to try one of their soups, but I'm glad I've tried these first. Overall, highly recommend. An honest, good representation of what a Cuban sandwich is supposed to be. They also serve complimentary shots of Cuban coffee, but we didn't get those."}, {"review_id": "RBqsumFB3_PtXSSXPIZyqQ", "user_id": "fyVUnNBhIhfTd7X0BqnU8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Delicious Cuban food! We had the Cuban lunch bowl, both the chicken and pork were flavorful and would have again. The maduros were sweet and made just right, we even ordered another order.

My mother, who hails from Cuba, and I were hungry and I told her about the Cuban Place in Broad Ripple I had seen before and wanted to go check out. We were warmly welcomed by George the owner and quickly got to chatting about Cuba, food the way it used to be before the Cuban revolution, etc. We knew immediately when he started explaining how he prepared his food and his attention to details that it was going to be good. And it did not disappoint!We ordered a bunch of food to bring home and sample and share with family. The Cuban Sandwich is authentic and legit. Very generous portions and the right ratios of the meats to bread and condiments. The Media Noche was wonderful, but a little smaller, which George told us about up front.  And the Pan con Bistec (steak) was delicious.We also sampled several of the pastelitos and they were all amazing. We saved some for the next couple mornings and they stayed fresh and tasty with our morning coffees.I will be back on my very next visit to Indy. You dont need to travel to Miami to get quality Cuban sandwiches...just go visit George!"}, {"review_id": "CIbiSmsJdqwmSWZzV0p1Kg", "user_id": "GZIjnqSq-w1f2lEsq2ut9Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "A friend and I went before a concert.

The mood is vibrant and fun and the service is always great. There is something special about feeling like you are getting food from a beloved uncle who lives what he serves you. I've only ever got the Cuban. It's generously sized and the bread is soooooo yummy. I convinced my skeptical Cuban friend to come and she had three media Noche. She said she felt like she was at home again. The yellow rice is simple and flavorful and they bring you a shout of Cuban coffee near the end of your meal. It's really something special and I highly recommend it. I will suggest bringing a jacket if you get cold easily.

This sandwich not only has chicken with hot melty cheese, but chorizo! For only $10 (comes with a side) you can't pass up this delicious opportunity. (Only detractor: the sides aren't super flavorful, and a lot of the warm ones taste like they have been sitting in a pot for a few days.. I normally just get chips as the side if I'm making it a meal +/- $3.25)There is plenty of indoor seating and you order at a counter. It's usually not too busy and the food always comes out within 5-10 minutes. If you're feeling adventurous, try one of the delicious pastries.

Now the decor, warm and inviting; this placeIs colorfully laced and decked out in art pieces with a Cuban flare. Now that I kept you waiting, the food, oh my sooo incredibly good. I just left Miami where I had an abundance of Cuban food and when my husband suggested coming here I was thinking it is not going to compare. I was right, those Miami restaurants have nothing on this place! The food is sooo delicious that I can say Havana is truly here in Indy. As far as food goes, no need to go to Miami because we have the best of Cuba right here."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/taste-of-havana-cuban-sandwiches-indianapolis-2?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
