Hard to find authentic food from other countries in Missoula, or Montana in general.However, if you go for their traditional American hipster food, you'll be more than happy! I'm so glad I've found this place. Every time another restaurant in Missoula disappoints, Burns St Bistro is always there to remind that good food exists in this town.Keep it up guys!PS.

The restaurant is deservedly popular and you'll be gambling on being able to snag a table otherwise. Also, hone up on your parallel parking skills! The food is excellent! I love the Chef's creativity and almost daily, rotating menu (check FB for their specials in advance). You can taste the locally sourced ingredients in every dish. Plus, I know this can be a heated topic, however this place wins #1 veggie browns for me! The restaurant's ambience is incredibly relaxed and casual. Just sit back and enjoy a cup of coffee (or mimosa), people watch, and have some great eats!"}, {"review_id": "i5ZZHDbYiC-G_2mw0qkKjQ", "user_id": "Gmin15HavkPbFoweHMlW_w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/11/2017", "text": "Last year I came here for breakfast before I flew home and it was pretty great.Yesterday I was back in town and we went for lunch.

The food and coffee is as exceptional as it was before, but the people... I wish I could give six stars to the staff of Burns St. Bistro, they totally turned around a bad morning with their kindness, service, and generosity. We're based in GA, visit Alberta occasionally,  but will go out of our way to visit here again!---All I want when I order biscuits and gravy is a good house made gravy that looks like it actually started as sausage in a pan, and a good light biscuit...BOY DID I GET IT!One of the best biscuits and gravy I've had, and I've ordered it across the south! The bacon is amazing, it's like they found a way to convert pork into candy. Eggs were cooked perfectly. Portions were very generous, especially for the price!I'm not normally a coffee drinker but the coffee here was so good I made an exception.The food is exceptional, staff was friendly, the patio seating was very relaxed and with a nice breeze was very comfortable. Highly recommended!"}, {"review_id": "pV8_zPQzwD7rsbdNnmpvKA", "user_id": "sK-LX58sby4_3rKHehke2Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/18/2016", "text": "Burns St Bistro is right next door to a co-op.  That should set the tone of your dining experience to a T.  It's very laid back atmosphere with plenty of seating.  I was here for a business trip so I sat by my lonesome, however, a plastic flamingo in the garden section bordering Burns kept me company.  I shall name him Fred.I ended up getting the ramen with pork belly.  I didn't really know what to expect with this dish.  All I know is that I saw the words \"kimchi\" on the menu board and went, \"I want that one.\" Mind you this is after 2-3 weeks of no kimchi.  The depravity... The ramen reminds me of a cold Korean noodle dish called neng myun - basically cold buckwheat noodles in an icy broth.  However, this ramen had no broth.  Instead it had a cold broth-esque coating.  There was a really nice heat to the dish from the kimchi but I wish they had added bigger chunks to the dish.  Maybe that's just the Korean side of me speaking.  I have mixed feelings about the ramen noodles from a ramen packet being used.  Sure it's cost effective and simple but I felt like using buckwheat noodles would have really made the dish a star.  Maybe even glass noodles.  I was craving something with more texture to it.The pork belly was just straight up katsu.  I was hoping for some chashu-like pork belly but beggars can't be choosers and they did put tonkatsu on the menu which I had understood as \"we're going to put chashu pork belly on top like we do with classic style Japanese ramen\", not donkatsu.  I was really confused by what I was going to receive.Overall, Burns St Bistro is definitely a little gem in the middle of Missoula.  I'd definitely come back for one of their heartier dishes they seem to be known for."}, {"review_id": "YAk1KFIBBfK5euW8m6wLgw", "user_id": "hFB9PM1R2tECWfBUCggS3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "The food is amazing.

I order the bubs burger ( I think that was thE name) it had this creamy gooey cheese mix that was more like a condiment but was very tasty. The burger was juicy and the fries were really good. It was a little ok the expensive side but the size of it was pretty well worth it. The cappuccino was good and so was the cookie.

Hit and miss.Service used to be good and kind, now simply terrible and that is unacceptable, in Missoula especially. I have never been asked to leave a restaurant in my life because the place was full. We ordered a full brinch for three people (over 75$ of merchandise). We took about 50mins to finish (and that includes the ~20 mins it took to get the food out)Here is a novel concept - if you have too many customers, manage them better, have  a waiting list, dont be greedy. Since I am better treated at a Wendy's or McD, your menu is suddenly ridiculously overpriced. I have spent much energy promoting bsb when you first started out.
