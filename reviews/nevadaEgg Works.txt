It's one of our go-to breakfast spots. The weekends get pretty crowded, but it's worth the wait. Their banana muffins are super good, my son LOVES them. Also love the fact that they serve rice. Being from Hawaii, I love having rice with my bacon. They're really generous with their portions as well.

I usually change up my order but two items that are a definite must have every time I go: banana muffin and the breakfast potatoes. The banana muffin is free if you check into Yelp (& the servers are aware of it!) and it's great. The texture is great and you can taste the flavor evenly through. The breakfast potatoes have a seasoning that just helps balance out the meal. I have never been disappointed with the potatoes!I recently got the banana bread french toast, which was amazing. Just like the muffin, the texture is perfect for a french toast breakfast item and the flavor is consistent all the way through.The weekends get super busy here, so I suggest coming early if you're not into waiting!"}, {"review_id": "qcDcbvnXDpCVAoDesKpsXQ", "user_id": "9NEIOZaaUcodlqHU2fwEvA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Awesome breakfast place.

Usually go here after church on Sundays and it's always packed but we usually get sat in 20 mins. I absolutely love their banana nut muffin! I've ordered several benedicts and omlettes and all have been pretty delicious ... but then again I love breakfast! They have a large menu to choose from and I love that you can make save calories with any order by substituting for egg whites, fruit, extra protein, or cottage cheese.

Banana muffin is really good especially if you pair it with coffee (i believe it contains walnut, just a heads up if you have a nut allergy). My son loves their spaghetti (kids meal comes with a drink). I usually get their country fried steak. But I've tried their country benny which is delicious! I've also tried the Sunrise mountain, which in my opinion, lacked flavor. Maybe because I ordered it with ham instead of bacon or sausage? Idk. But it was missing something, so I had to put a lot of Tabasco (I still liked it, but maybe will go for a diff. Meat next time). The staff are always nice and friendly! Always welcoming and never rush us!"}, {"review_id": "izT3zuf3TaneGCSNh-dnFw", "user_id": "GHoBAN6v5zprtUeOi4iicg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "They aren't known for big portions, but I think their portions are big. At least for the skillets. I love ordering the country skillet with a cup of coffee. And if my husband and I aren't starving, the skillet is perfect for the both of us.

Not only is the food delicious and good priced, the service was amazing from our friendly server Heather. I totally recommend this place to everyone and anyone wanting to eat breakfast. Today i had the crazy chicken omelette and their signature potatoes. The crazy chicken omelette has chicken, avocado, mushrooms and cheese. It's delicious for us non-pork eating people. The service here is very efficient as well. Seating is quick and service is even quicker. When you're finished eating, you simply pay at the cashier located in the front, thereby freeing up tables quicker for others to sit."}, {"review_id": "5nXs3wXHilVYzWlmySWnpA", "user_id": "T-bbNiVDbGVxxdbQX52KTA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/30/2017", "text": "Love this place.  We visit Henderson every year and stay with our friends...this has been a staple for breakfast over the years.  The service is always great as well as the food.The corned beef hash is great, as is the Santa Cruz skillet, but my go-to is usually the Crazy Chicken Omelette.Their seasoned potatoes are really good, and I'm not usually a fan of the cube-like potatos.My hubby's fave is the 5-way Cincy Chili which (in case you don't know) is chili on spaghetti, then add cheese, onion, etc.  The chili is not normal Tex-Mex chili...it is a chili sauce and is a bit sweet, so I'm not a fan, but he LOVES it!They also sell their own bloody mary mix, which I have got to buy and try one of these trips."}, {"review_id": "oa47HoSJVcXblnVk75L-7w", "user_id": "YNA6bV_yHQ9Sn9Fich8rIQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Always a great experience here. Friendly servers and service. Good comes out fast. We usually try to get here by 9 or 930a otherwise there is a wait. Arrived at aboit 915a and only waited less than 10mins. Left at 10a and ensure enough there was a crowd of ppl outside waiting. Our server today was Nicole and she was wonderful.I recommend that it you get any of the loco moco dishes (3 types to choose from), you should ask for the gravy or chili on the side.

First thing, it is cool to see the toy train goes around the restaurant. Keeps you entertained while waiting for your name to be called. During our visit, we tried their regular egg burrito, avocado omelet, chicken fried steak, and beef burrito. They were all delicious and yummy. I jokingly made a comment about the sauce tasting like Taco Bell but was told by my companion that it might taste like Taco Bell but it is fresh. The portions are big, I can stay a two person can split it and still be full. They give a lot of potatoes on each of our plates. We did not finish it all. Also, their banana nut muffin is great! I could come to this place and just eat that!

We happened to find this spot after a soccer tournament near by. Next time I end up in Vegas I will intentionally make it a point to come in for some more. I ordered the veggie benny and... WOW! The hollandaise sauce was delicious the egg was perfectly cooked the whole thing was just absolutely phenomenal. The portion size was huge! The potatoes are absolutely delicious as well. I like the metal card things that they have that can be flipped over if you require service. We didn't need to use them since our server was attentive. The kid had the stuffed french toast an d though it was \"so good\".The one downfall,  I never really care for the whole line up at the end of your meal to pay. Especially in a place like this that has a lot of people, because you end up waiting in line for a while just to pay your tab. As I said, next time I visit Vegas, I'm taking the 20 minute trip just to eat breakfast here."}, {"review_id": "8JAUlLfcGtIUUqbL0xGIoA", "user_id": "RMcjs8VBbPz0QIHdWcrKfA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Hardy and delicious breakfast and brunch food.

There was a gentleman who asked me for my info right away and then there was a young man seating people named Tyler. Tyler had two people walk in that he knows and immediately asked them if they wanted to sit outside to get seated quickly. My fiancé, my daughter (in a stroller) and I were also waiting to be seated outside. My fiancé stood up and asked him to make sure he still had us on the list and he said, yes. Then, he welcomed his friends again as if he didn't know who they were. It's one thing to wait because of business, I understand that.
