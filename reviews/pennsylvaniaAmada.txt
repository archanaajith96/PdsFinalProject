You get selections from a diverse menu, can easily order more if needed, and the dining tends to be relaxed.The tapas at Amada come out slowly- an advantage to me, because you can really spend time tasting just a couple dishes at a time. Coupled with an interesting cocktail offering, and a very well curated Spanish wine list (which is almost always a better value than standard lists) the result is a very pleasurable meal.My wife and I ordered dishes with artichoke and Parmesan, some flatbread, and cheeses- (served with paper thin apples and fig preserves). All good.But the stand out were the lamb meatballs with a delicious smoky flavor that had us both opening our eyes in surprise at the same time. The clams in chorizo broth were a bit spicy for my wife but I loved them.My wife likes a sangria INce in a while and they had three versions on offer. I stared with a bourbon cocktail that I liked - thankfully not that cloying sweetness of many bourbon drinks.We both agreed that this was a great way to dine, and wished we had more places near us that offered this variety and quality."}, {"review_id": "d0DmuQqMpLYRLbQqRYTYEg", "user_id": "UN6MXJuhyGcX7LTj4-b7FA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "While I have had many pleasant happy hour experiences at Amada, I was there yesterday for brunch and it was quite a disappointment. Enough to make me feel like this review was in order. A friend made our reservation through Open Table and arrived before I did. When I got to Amada, the hostess was unwelcoming and seemed like it was a Herculean effort to see if my friend had arrived. I was glad my friend saw me come in and gestured me over to her table, otherwise I might still be standing at the hostess station.The brunch menu has changed since my first very enjoyable brunch here 3 years ago, and not for the better. There is a $27 prix fixe menu or one can order a la carte. CC, my companion, chose the prix fixe and I went with the latter.A bread basket that came with my friend's prix fixe was brought to the table. It contained a croissant and 2 other bread items and while it was ensconced in a napkin, all three of the breads/pastries were cold. Items on toast (and hard, mean, sharp pieces of toast that are painful to eat) appear quite a bit on the menu now. I ordered the avocado toast ($9) (yes, sue me for that) and got 3 pieces of the vicious, oily toasted bread with maybe a tablespoon of avocado spread across all 3 pieces. The avocado was fresh and tasted fine and the tomato escabeche that was spread on the bread was tasty but I scraped everything off to eat separately because the bread was so hard. I guess it was grilled but it was grilled for too long.My second item was the Revuelto ($15) which the menu listed as soft scrambled eggs, shrimp, wild mushrooms and black truffle toast. I got a plate of warm-ish, watery eggs, no mushrooms in sight, 3 tepid, pathetic, half raw shrimp and 3 very thin slices of the very hard toast that I set aside. The items on the menu that stated they came with 'baby greens' showed up with ONE piece of arugala as a garnish. I'd ordered a Campari and soda that was good (and hard to ruin) but the server never asked if I wanted a second drink and when he did come by to check on the table, his question was cursory rather than really interested. Water glasses were replenished regularly but the energy of the restaurant was very low and it felt everyone was on auto-pilot. The place was not busy, which surprised me for a beautiful Saturday. It's possible the construction and street closure on 2nd St. due to the fire at The Little Lion could be part of it, but I don't think that's the only reason.We were not offered tea or coffee with or after the meal and while CC, my dining pal, wanted dessert, she opted to have it elsewhere.When we left, the Ice Princess hostess did not acknowledge us in any way, not even to say a phony \"thanks for coming, have a nice day.\" I think this was my final, sad visit to Amada. Too bad."}, {"review_id": "xlqY3HLF4SJ8ZGXV3FuFyw", "user_id": "2S_TNGTL1gDTDu3T2GYuXQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We went to Amada this past Saturday night for our first wedding anniversary and had a great experience. The staff provided us with complimentary champagne (and noticed I was pregnant but left the second glass for my husband and quickly fulfilled my request for a virgin mojito), did not rush us, and provided excellent service. The food was delicious as always. We ate a TON. The bacon wrapped dates are always a must, as is the octopus. The manchego with truffle honey was delicious as always. By now, we have sampled most of the menu and have yet to be disappointed with any dish. A great experience at Amada, again."}, {"review_id": "QviYHXN9dJEWdUJ03Isdkg", "user_id": "oR5az_eNCnfN7e49H3ONhg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "Much to my satisfaction, my dining partner made a reservation at this place last night. Just when I think I'm on top of all the best places in philly, I'm hit in the face with the realization that I don't know shit. Reservation was obtained but not required at 6:15 on a Monday evening in late January. There is no happy hour in the dining area but perhaps it is present at the bar (there is suggested by the \"happy hour\" menu on the website). Ambiance is dope, wall of lanterns is actually a good instagram photo op.  Drink menu is enticing. Multiple sangria variations, drink menu, gin and tonic variations menu, beers and wines. Not just 3 beers either, there's quite a fair number. We sat talking for a while bc I'm outrageously interesting. I had my drink selection cued up since about 15 seconds after my ass hit the seat but I had to wait a minute for my companion to make his selection. I can't find the drink menu but if I remember correctly the name was something with hugs. It contained tequila (obviously), grapefruit juice, and some other stuff. It was tasty, perfect combo of sweet and tart. My companion ordered one of the gin and tonics served in a large wine-type glass with huge ice cubes and tonic to self pour. I later ordered one of the sangrias which was flavorful and stuffed to the brim with fruit pieces that I used to supplement my dinner. For food this is a tapas place. I used to be against this shit bc I'm keen on a large, hearty, mountain of food but this is pretty common occurrence in philly I have noticed and I rather enjoy tasting a bunch of different shit. We ordered a few things, all from the vegetables portion of the menu d/t my vegetarianism. Can someone please inform the menu-making person that \"trout\" is not vegetarian and that part should rather be moved to the \"pescados and carnes\" section. First to arrive was the amada's empanada, dough stuffed with spinach, artichoke, and manchego cheese. Delicious. Only two are given though, wtf?! I want moar.I forgot to mention, after ordering food they give you this delicious chunky orange/red dip with paper thin and crispy bread things. So fucking good I actually scooped that shit into my mouth with a spoon when we ran out of bread.Second was the queso de cabra, goat cheese dollop surrounded by a DELICIOUSSSSSSSSSSS tomato sauce and 4 little slices of toasted broad. FOUR slices of bread? For real? How on earth are we supposed to scoop up all that delicious dip with four grape-sized italian bread slices? Absolutely spectacular. We also got the colifor with cauliflower and some delicious white sauce and a whoel bunch of other spices. Garbanzos con espinacas: chickpeas, some roasted, some not depending on their location within the bowl, intertwined with some spinach leaves. Tasty as well but probably my least favorite, delicious nonetheless. Ultimately this meal was spectacular. I look forward to returning."}, {"review_id": "KN4zzTKjsJwUslhE0HYKjQ", "user_id": "xh3a5vuXjT21KCpPzgJQ4w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "I decided to take advantage of 2018 Center City District Restaurant week and chose to come to Amada for lunch. Overall, I was pretty pleased with my experience. I was happily full but not overly stuffed at the end of my meal. I got to taste test my husband's food as well (LOL, i always steal his food). So here we go!-Ensalada Verde 5/5(Green Salad, Asparagus, Favas, Avocado, Green Beans) Damn this salad was GOOD! It was fresh, delicious, and flavorful. Seriously! It was my favorite dish out of everything i ate here. Never thought I'd say that a salad was my favorite dish. -Croquetas de Jamon  5/5(Ham Croquettes, Romesco Caldo Gallego Chorizo, Smoked Ham with White Beans, And Potato Espuma)Guys, these are amazing! They don't look special upon first glance, but they are delicious! The smoke jam flavor totally comes through and the sauce that is paired with croquettes complement it so well! Get it -Gambas a la plancha 3/5This was a beautiful and simple dish. I love shrimp and to see nice, grilled pieces of shrimp made me salivate instantly. Unfortunately, to me, the seasoning was a little too salty for my taste. When I added more lemon juice to the shrimp, it definitely improved the flavor and felt less salty. So word of advice, squeeze that lemon! -Patatas Bravas 5/5 Get this! No, they're not JUST fries. They look like fries but are a million times better. These had an amazing smoky flavor that just elevated this to the next level. Get this. -Bocadillo de Serranito 3/5(Slow Roasted Pork Sandwich, Serrano Ham, Hard Boiled Egg, Shishito Peppers)I was so excited to try this dish and it wasn't my favorite. The flavor was a little overwhelming and it was super greasy and fatty. Because of how heavy this dish was, I found the flavors to be a bit cloying. -Bocadillo de Pavo 4/5(Herb Roasted Turkey Sandwich, Roasted Peppers, Romesco Aioli)This was better than the bocadillo de serranito (according to both me and my husband). -Tocinillo de Cielo 3/5This was the dessert. I don't quite know how to explain it. You can see it in my picture. It was good, but something in it made it less enjoyable. I think there was pastry soaked in a sweet liqueur/liquid of some sort. The flavors were a little strong and it took away from the enjoyment of the dish as a whole. Overall, Amada is pretty good. The ambiance is quite nice as it has an industrial feel to the decor. The food is also pretty good. I would definitely come back!"}, {"review_id": "hTobtVKVhz2Dsw1KRKsIUw", "user_id": "c_Ap6RsFcZpqWN9QM-qIlQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "Restaurant week review: first time here, and I'll definitely be back not during restaurant week. We started with the hugs tequila drink and the sangria, which were both great. We were seated about a half hour late, but it worked out because the last person in our party was running a little late.The food came out as it was prepared, which is typical, and the waitress warned us. Everything we had was delicious, but we think we liked he flatbreads the best. The grilled seafood was very flavorful. Everyone loved the garlic shrimp, which were cooked perfectly. Olives were a hit as well. Desserts were great too. While everything was tapa sized, we didn't leave hungry. We were very content without being stuffed like you are at some places. The interior was very cool with old fashioned lamps. The bar is incredibly tall.

But the best one was, surprisingly, the salad. It was just super fresh and perfect. For entrees, we got the 'Crab Stuffed Pepper', 'Wild Mushroom Rice', Chicken with the Fried Egg and this Sausage Flatbread. They were all very good but my favorite was the Mushroom Rice. Very flavorful! Lastly for dessert, we had the Hazelnut Puff Pastry and the Egg Cream Custard dessert. They were good as well but definitely our least favorite course. We had to wait an hour for a table but that's our fault for not reserving a table on a Friday night. The service was quick and we got to sit right in front of the kitchen so we could watch everything which was so fun!

The restaurant has a very extensive tapas menu, so anyone can find something that they would like. These tapas did not take me to Spain but they got me pretty close. The pulpo and the croquetas are must haves. During out visit, we ate at the bart and the male bartenders were very attentive. The food came out pretty fast in different waves. Also, the restaurant has a very generous tapas happy hour menu that contains multiple items for around $5 bucks. Note: the tapas portions are small, which are typical at these types of restaurants, so do mot expect to be stuffed from two-three plates.

It's a little pricey but I spoke to him and he helped me picked out a Mixto board for the meat and 1 cheese, the manchego cheese with lavender.

I'm super excited to say that the food did not disappoint and lived up to my hyped up expectations. The menu was a prix fixe selection of tapas and the dishes were meant to be shared. We each ordered different plates because we wanted to try some of everything and honestly this is a method that I would recommend. Upon walking into the restaurant, you experience a cozy, sophisticated atmosphere and are immediately greeted by friendly staff (Also, the smell of truffles fills the room, so we were already excited!). Our waiter, Edwin, was excellent and gave us great recommendations. The restaurant week menu gives you the option to choose two appetizers, two entrees, and one dessert. I highly recommend getting the manchego cheese plate because the lavender truffle honey is to die for!! We loved it so much we bought two jars when our waiter told a they sell it in-house! Other stand-out dishes include the coliflor (get this) and the ham croquettes. Overall, from the attentiveness of the staff, to the pacing of the meal, to the delicious dishes that were served (especially during a hectic week like restaurant week), I was really happy with my experience at Amada."}, {"review_id": "w763a3GZHTPviUfsPPd-2w", "user_id": "mKXjxcjG6iAee9DjjIFd3Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "I have been to Amada a few times both in small groups (2-4) and then twice with a large group (6+). The space itself is relatively large, they have two rooms and can generally (read below!) accommodate larger groups. The Food (9/10)The tapas are great for sharing and always delicious. My favorite are the patatas bravas. The mains are good too, I recommend ordering the paella if you have a group of 4 or more, its huge but so worth it. The only reason the food isn't a 10/10 is that it really isn't anything stand out. It is certainly tasty but nothing that is by far and away better than other Spanish restaurants serving similar style cuisine. Service (5/10)I have been here a  handful of times, one two separate occasions I was made to wait over an hour to be seated (I had a reservation both times). The first time it wasn't too big of a deal as it was only 4 of us and we were happy to wait at the bar (even though a table should have been ready since we had a reservation). The last time we went there was a different story, we were a group of 8 that I called ahead about (1 month in advance). Then followed up with (3 days prior and the night of), then upon arriving we were made to wait awkwardly at the small doorway for an hour while we waited for a table to become available. We were unable to find space at the bar and on top of all of that we were treated as though we were an inconvenience,  even though I had followed up and called multiple times to ensure the restaurant was prepared. It was rude and did sour the evening a bit. All in all I would probably only recommend going if you wouldn't mind waiting even when you have a reservation and only in small groups. If I do go back, it will not be in a group."}, {"review_id": "fwD8lAijIKPxXGvjv_YFfA", "user_id": "TBtZ0m-FG22_tjaZRVOauQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "Amada is my favorite restaurant in Philadelphia. We ordered 4 tapas for the table. This is a decent number for a party of two. If you have more numbers in your group, you'll have the luxury and the opportunity to try more tapas. The more the merrier! Patatas Bravas or the spicy potatoes were excellent, both in terms of taste and execution. The albondigas or lamb meatballs are simply sensational. This is a must try at Amada. I'd also recommend the crab stuffed peppers. This is an innovative tapa with strong flavor and taste.We tried the chocolate tart for dessert. Taste and texture were top notch - soft and creamy with a burst of flavor. The cafe con leche here is a fantastic coffee option after dinner although it is a little overpriced at $7.50 I'm a huge fan of Jose Garces' restaurants in the area.

If money is not an issue, this is a good place to try. Otherwise, make sure you stick to a few great menu items or you will be disappointed. I'll start with the items I thought were very good. I really enjoyed the Albondigas (Lamb Meatballs,Shaved Manchego), Ensalda de Jamon (Serrano Ham & Fig Salad,Cabrales, Spiced Almonds), Alcachofas y Setas (Artichokes,Wild Mushrooms, Black Truffles Manchego Flatbread) Gambas al Ajillo(Garlic Shrimp), and Alcachofas a la Parmesana(Parmesan Artichokes), The Manchego Pasamontes(Truffled Lavender Honey) was unique, but the portion was very small.  The Patatas Bravas (Spicy Potatoes) were bland. The Chorizo was very chewy, and all I tasted was salt. The Scallops were average at best, and you get two scallops cut in half (so four pieces) for $26. Definitely not worth it.

A few little asparagus. Didn't notice the avocado and favas if they were there.- Spanish octopus- slices of tentacle were nicely cooked and flavored with paprika- recommend- Goat cheese with fig and cherry jam- good sized slice of cheese was tasty with the jam and pretty green apple slices. I preferred without the slices of dry bread- Roasted cauliflower- my fave dish of the evening- there were some sort of pickled and sweet flavors all mixed together. The result was delish!- Artichokes- was a little disappointed with this, three small slices of artichoke in a creamy Parmesan sauce. Not my fave, esp for $11.Drinks were meh. I'm not sure my gin and tonic actually had any gin. And my sister's wine was a light pour. Maybe better value if you go with a bottle, or just stick to the food.
