Not from around here but this restaurant matched all my nutritional standards. Service was excellent even while they were understaffed. Local ingredients and delicious entrees. Had the pickled beet salad and an omelette with local sausage and home made sourdough bread and honey butter and strawberry jam. Don't usually eat those items but how could I pass it up when they're made in house minus all of the crap that conventional products use to kill us.If you care about what you eat, where it comes from  and your own health and well being, then you've gotta make a stop (or several) to this place!"}, {"review_id": "4F70JMbuBcpVJTvKlrPqfg", "user_id": "E0CuMu3vrOOQljoto8XYgw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "I love the concept of sourcing locally as much as possible, as well as the restaurant itself, however I still find it will take a lot more for me to return.When we arrived, we were told to sit anyway. We picked a table inside by the door. We waited over 10 minutes for anyone to greet us. Finally, someone said they would be right with us. She brought us waters almost 10 minutes later. My husband wanted a bloody mary, but she spilled the last batch or something. Fine.He ordered the Arkansas breakfast with sausage and I had the benedict with ham and kale with a side of potatoes. My meal was delicious! Eggs were cooked perfectly, kale was great, and biscuits were fluffy. His meal, although good too, wasn't anything out of the ordinary.The food did take a little bit to get to us as well. In fact, when we arrived close to closing, everyone just looked like they had been waiting and waiting. Also, we tried to come here once before with a group of 8 but ended up leaving because the wait was over an hour and the restaurant is not ideal for large groups, especially if it's cold outside.So although not bad in terms of food, it will take a lot more for me to want to return, especially when there are breakfast/brunch places a lot better."}, {"review_id": "W06rhQZYDcan4Db0qAb5aQ", "user_id": "DlNH4d3UQxJ2A8iHbO8_JQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Do not and I mean do not order the chicken fried steak here. The $19 chicken fried steak dinner comes with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The steak was cube steak and it was TOUGH as leather and super small. The mash potatoes were just okay. The potatoes were homemade mixed with buttermilk. They lacked butter, salt, and pepper. The gravy was also made in house which is a lot better then a gravy packet. My complaint is the cost of the baffling over priced, super small, extra chewy chicken fried steak. It's completely criminal how much they charge for rubbery meat and potatoes. They were out of broccoli so they subbed in honey glazed  carrots. They were also out of chicken tenders so my son ordered pancakes with bacon. He liked the pancakes which is good because breakfast is their staple and that is the only reason why I would give it a second chance. Our service was really good but a little on the slow side getting our food and drink orders in. Our waitress was kind and helpful for any menu questions we had."}, {"review_id": "jErrwCYQn0K4w9xS8Ya2XQ", "user_id": "WZZZsGdz7ZcJPjPySdDPlw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "The ambience on the patio is nice. I have been here once or twice. I love that everything is locally grown. I think overall the recipes could be perfected a bit. My partner had The Breakfast Burger, it was delectable. The herbed greens were perfect. Added tomato would be delicious on the burger. I had the beet salad. The pecans were crunchy and fresh and the beets were chopped prettily. The greens again, were amazing. I would have preferred the olive oil to be offered on the side as there was quite a lot of oil and I would've preferred a little bit less. It was delicious, nonetheless. We also had loose leaf tea with crystalized honey. It was DELICIOUS and well worth the $4.00. I would recommend the tea as it comes in an adorable kettle with teacups."}, {"review_id": "WE8gJXEtPhv7RDML4N-k7A", "user_id": "5n-q5h4xYeJVSNk1TKMMeQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "During a quick overnight visit to Fayetteville, hubby and I stopped here for breakfast before heading home.  It was very busy with a ton of people waiting, which I knew bode well for the food.I ordered the Biscuits & Gravy as it's soooo hard not to.  One of my favorite breakfast things, and the Farmer's Table version was pretty good!  Slightly spicier than normal, but very savory and filling.  The potatoes were also spicy and in chunks.  I prefer shredded hashbrowns if I'm getting potatoes, but overall they were pretty tasty.Hubby got the sweet potato pancakes which were huge and very fluffy.

Good: most of the food. It is very good. They seemed to have changed their sweet potato pancake recipe, though, which is a real bummer because I liked it before and am definitely not a fan of the current pancakes. Personal preference, though.  We also waited for 90 minutes for a table, and 30 minutes more for food, largely unattended, and I would say the food isn't worth that wait. I know it's a busy joint, but the waitstaff just isn't attentive at all; we got our own water refills after trying to get our waitresses attention multiple times, and our food came out missing parts and with sides given to the wrong people.Like I said, the food is good, and I might go again, but not at peak hours. Unfortunate that their craveable sweet potato pancakes are no longer the same."}, {"review_id": "buv02Cq6ZyIe6uujeceWLg", "user_id": "Yk-ePElFQsosd-WJXtbQWg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "The food here was very good!

We waited in 20+ minute intervals for drink refills, orders, food delivery, etc. Our waitress kept walking by our table and seldom managed to check on us. She asked me to move seats when we first sat down because I was \"in her way\" (we were seated outside and I was freezing so I wanted to be a spot with sun, but sure - waitstaff before the customer). To end the day she couldn't get the bill straight and mixed up our party's receipts so she had to redo those (adding on another 15 minutes) and dropped another table's credit cards all over the place no doubt mixing up their bills. The meal was absolutely the best breakfast we have had in NWA but from the service alone we will absolutely not be going back. Avoid the headache."}, {"review_id": "MLF2wagxJlEWKVnI-gaM1Q", "user_id": "_2feJi_7VPNi6XixxE9ZOw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Very homie environment, staff was pleasant! I love the farm to table concept and I liked that they include information at the table about where they source their ingredients. I ordered the breakfast burrito and the execution left a lot to be desired. The eggs were over cooked, the tortilla was very dry and the cheese was all somehow at the bottom and it tasted unpleasant. I didn't finish my food and I was hungry. I may try again but if you're looking for great execution prelude every time ."}, {"review_id": "U8OCnkikSnF4LGMnU6KtvQ", "user_id": "nVcDYhYwsgOTYi_TrW7plg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Love the concept, but not the execution.
