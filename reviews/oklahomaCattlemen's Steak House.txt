Attention is regularly paid to your table so you are never left wanting.But that salad dressing!!! It is everything I remembered. It's too decadent to swim in it- but I have given it thought.

I'm neither. I prefer to choke the proverbial chickens. And do stuff with the literal ones too. But let's move on.I like to cuddle mens, but there's none of that at this Cowboy-friendly steakhouse which is legendary because of television and reputation.I found Cattleman's Steakhouse to be really overrated. It gets a glowing five stars for the service, as they gave me food when they were close to closing time and that made me really happy cuz I have wanted to try this place for a long time.If you love the food here, you and I may have extremely different tastes. DDD (as usual) is putting the blandest and most disappointing places on the map, for the most part. I wonder how they choo$e their $pot$ for the $how.The server was one of the nicest guys I've had in a long time. So to speak. He was an older gentleman and we talked about traveling and about the world in general. He's a really good guy. He helped me pick out a good sirloin and while I enjoyed it I can't say that I would recommend coming here to others.I don't really like steak very much to begin with but since this place was billed as the mother of all steaks and the ultimate steak I thought I'd give it a try. The taste is okay and it was really juicy which I appreciated.The sides were just okay. There wasn't much going on with the baked potato (dry af like your older sis) and all the fixings and the salad didn't really do it for me either - especially the creamy dressing. The famous rolls just taste sugary and I'm not sure what the big deal is. Oh America. What's the deal.I do really like Homestyle American food when it's done a certain way (Nancy's Home Cooking! Soul Food places!) but all of this seems pretty tasteless and made me feel like I don't really like the cuisine very much. People go crazy for it so what do I know. Certainly the service is some of the best I've had anywhere.My other problem with it is the price. My steak was pretty tiny and ended up being around $20. I don't understand what justifies that but okay. The famous coconut cream pie didn't taste great at all and the slices that I got over in Plaza at the Yelppopular Pie Place or whatever the place is called, were significantly better. Also I think this place is definitely for Republicans because I got some of the most interesting stares walking into the place. Like, what the f*** are you doing here hippie. Then again I was dressed in a muscle shirt and I do have long hair LOL. No boots and hat in sight over here.It'd score 2 if not for the wonderful service.These mens should stick to their cattle. I'll meanwhile have a bowl of Rice Krispies instead.

Was brought here for the 'fries', but I've had them before and went with a different snip off the bull.First, this is a neat part of town. This is the way an old western town should look, but with more 60s and 70s pickups parked on the street. The restaurant seems to pretty busy at dinner time. It's a Wednesday night and there were still some people waiting for dinner. Its pretty loud inside, so if you have audio sensitive guests this might be a stressful place. At times it's hard to hold a conversation at your table.The food... I had the 'thick' cut sirloin. To me this is the way a steak should be cut. I don't care for thin 1/2\" steaks. It started with a salad and I went with the house dressing since there seems to be more pictures of that instead of the STEAK at a STEAKhouse. Meh. It was salad dressing. The meal showed up. The proper steak came on a plate with a medium sized baked potato and what was more like au jus than steak juice. That was a little odd but ok. No offer of steak sauce (not that I ever use it) so they must be proud of their steaks. It was good. Solid. Slightly under cooked from my order, but good anyway. Not an amazing mind blowing steak, but certainly a good steak.The twist. My colleague ordered the petite fillet with some peppercorn sauce and mac n cheese. The mac looked soooooo good although I don't recall her eating it. I do recall two things about her meal though. The peppercorn sauce looked like it was thickened with corn starch. It's the way it looks kinda gelatinous. Not appealing looking, but I think she thought it tasted ok. And her steak was undercooked. The server happily took it back for more cook time, but it didn't really look like it was any different. For the trouble she got a dessert on the house. I say this in that our waitress was empowered to make this decision. There was no asking for a manager. No courtesy \"sorry\" and move on. This employee was given the flexibility and power to make good on a situation. THAT is what I liked most about dinner here.The dessert. Apple pie and ice cream. How amazing could that be? It could be more if the pie was hot and melting your ice cream into a sweet river of deliciousness, but nay. Just pie and ice cream.As an out of towner, if I were back in town again, would I come here? Yes, I want to try the chicken fried dinner.

They had an interesting flavor and somewhat resembled a flat chicken nugget. Nonetheless, they were good. The steak was huge and flavorful. The bacon wrap was a great touch and helped add to the flavor. Add two beers and my bill came to $40. You can't touch a good steak in Massachusetts for less than $50 and everything is A la carte.

It was one of the subjects that I enjoyed studying in high school since it was just memorization. I didn't have to think too hard and the content was usually pretty interesting. Cattleman's Steakhouse has been in Oklahoma City for over 100 years now and they're not shy about letting you know about it. It's pretty obvious that they're proud of their history, so I was walking in already liking the place.  Cattleman's claim to fame, or it has been the entire time I've lived in Oklahoma, is their \"Presidential Choice T-bone Steak\". This steak has received attention and praise from foodies and TV shows like 'Man vs. Food' and 'Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives' so naturally I'm going to want to give it a go.  The meal started off with Cattleman's House Salad, which wasn't too bad. The dressing that it comes with it is pretty good. Actually, I should say the salad that comes with the dressing is pretty good. Maybe consider asking for the dressing on the side since they'll fill the bowl with so much. All that being said, the salad and crouton combination was delicious. I didn't have too much of it though since I wanted to save room for the main course.  The T-bone that I got was big. This was easily the biggest steak I've eaten. Looking at the picture of the steak I think it might've been closer to a porterhouse than a T-bone, but now we're just arguing semantics. One thing's for sure, they know how to cook a steak. I asked for a medium and Cattleman's delivered a perfect medium. The steak was tender and moist, but a little on the bland side. I like to have a bit of that seared crust on my steak, but they pour Au jus on after cooking it so it kind of negates that. It might also have to do with the wet-aging they said they do on 'Man vs. Food'. Heck, I don't really know. I'm no professional carnivore.  Don't get me wrong, Cattleman's makes a fine steak. I just don't know if it justifies the ~$40 price tag. Next time I come back, I'll probably try one of their other cuts."}, {"review_id": "__rk23ofKb0wp3QES_qWyg", "user_id": "fecDYNPM9WsbZy0FZ4wfrA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/28/2017", "text": "I love me a good steak. After hearing from a coworker that Cattlemen's has one of the best steaks in Oklahoma, I had to give it a try.This is located in Stockyard City, a place I never even knew existed. Definitely looks old and historic so that alone made the visit pretty cool.Jess M. and I came wanting to try the best Cattlemen's had to offer so we went with the Presidential T-bone. Apparently it's the steak that President Bush preferred when he would dine in when he was in OKC, and Cattlemen's definitely wants you to know that.This thing is fairly expensive (I believe the highest priced item on the menu) but hey, it's not like we're eating like this every week. The meal started off with a salad with some seasoning on top. Actually let me rephrase, we got ranch dressing with some salad and seasoning. They put so much dressing and I wish we could have just put what we wanted. I read some other reviews and saw similar complaints. There were rolls with butter as well but I wanted to save room for the main meal. So when the steak finally came, we were pretty excited. It looked juicy, had beautiful grill marks, etc. It looked like they had just killed the cow, tossed a chunk over the fire, and put it on a plate. (which is quite accurate since the cows are close by)I wasn't overly impressed with the taste. I believe they do have an aging process but it's not the steak I'm used to. Not a bad thing but wasn't my favorite. It's a very natural, charcoal taste and it's cooked the way that many meat connoisseurs might like it, so keep that in mind when visiting. Very juicy but needed a little bit of salt and butter for my liking. The T-bone consists of the strip sirloin and filet. I think the filet was the very juicy side while the sirloin was a little bit more tough. Overall, I felt like I had to give this place a 3. The price is high and you can get some incredible steaks elsewhere from other places in the city. The salad was lacking and was a disappointing way to start. I might come back but after trying another amazing steak for a couple bucks less from a different restaurant recently, I don't know if I'll be back here for a steak craving."}, {"review_id": "1veiPsN2skoKrtOW1rHGag", "user_id": "ToQssz8kaGx9_5RvAyg_ZA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "We were in the area for business, and colleagues selected this restaurant.  We arrived early, and were surprised at the crowd - a good sign.

I opted for the biscuit with gravy and the biscuit was perfectly fluffy on the inside with a crunchy exterior. The eggs were cooked to order, and the ham was a healthy portion. Together it was perfectly seasoned but alone, the ham was a little salty. The hash browns were very crunchy but I really didn't pay attention to them because everything else was so good. I also shared a cinnamon roll with the hubs that was warm and gooey, covered with melty icing. We couldn't finish it but it will be a good afternoon snack. I've had dinner here several times but not recently. The steaks are good, but if they are really busy, sometimes it's hard to get a perfectly cooked rare side of medium rare steak.

No fancy steak place just lots of seating and friendly service.Parking can be a bit tricky if you are from out of town or new so drive carefully around to find a spot or go around the block to park in their back parking lot.We came on a Sunday night at 6pm. Just the two of us so we were able to get in right away. I heard groups were waiting between 35-45 minutes.Like I said, nothing fancy so we were seated in a booth which had another table pretty near. However we could still have a private conversation and the table party didn't interfere with our dining experience.Prices I believe are typical for a steak place and since I knew I would be getting a filet mignon I didn't even bother to look at the rest of the menu, but it seemed extensive.The salad was very plain with just lettuce and one tiny tomato. I should have asked for the dressing on the side because it was a bit much for the size of salad.My filet came perfectly cooked (medium rare). I've never had bacon wrapped steak so I'm not sure if this is typical but the bacon was soggy (not sure if that's the correct description but the bacon wasn't firm).  The baked potato was nicely baked with absolutely nothing on it. They gave me butter and sour cream and I seasoned it with salt and pepper.The rolls with dinner were large, soft and delicious! I only ate half because of the rest of the meal but I could have easily eaten more of them.When we ordered our meal my husband told the server he was a diabetic and requested options instead of potatoes (he got veggies which he said were very good).
