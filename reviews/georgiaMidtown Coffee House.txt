What a gem of a find, the folks here are absolutely the best at customer service which is a missing element in CA for many places of business. Where we are from, most people are obtuse \"A\" holes and have zero hospitality. My wife and my son GF Maleeya, spent several hours talking and drinking coffee and tea and also ate something later during our short visit. Time flew by and we just left. You guys rock keep up the fantastic work ethic, its the secret sauce to your business success!Thank you, sincerely your new friends from Sacramento, CANot all of us are pricks, CA does have some cool people.

As you can see, the presentation isn't appealing with that glob of chicken sandwich meat. The kale was surely soft and dressing was poured enough. I'd suggest that MCH to tear that chicken up and not make it obvious that it's sandwich meat held and plopped over. They never asked if I needed water or replenish the water from my tea kettle. If they give you the kettle, you'd think they'd check if you need more water. But, that's just my suggestions."}, {"review_id": "kJnV3Yawa4BKCOXLtz8sQA", "user_id": "viOGE8EWRCuUKdW6VJyNSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/20/2017", "text": "What a lovely coffee shop and cafe!! Great first impression!I got the spinach, egg and feta panini for breakfast. It was perfect! So delicious and only $4.25. I didn't get anything to drink but everyone around me loved what they got! The environment is great for reading or working quietly but also a great place to meet with a friend and chat! The staff is incredible. The girl who helped me at the counter was very patient while I was being indecisive. She was helpful and very pleasant when I didn't know what I wanted. She also checked in on me after I got my food. Overall, Midtown Coffee House is a wonderful environment with good food and drinks. I will definitely go back next time I'm in Columbus!!"}, {"review_id": "ut5no7pyx1cpaaoUNSFn0A", "user_id": "DLGIMwIcTt8Z8WBbSTwBwQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "This place is awesome because it is the only place in town that I've found that offers both espresso drinks and the various forms of non-espresso coffee.

I have never been to Columbus before and this was my first stop where their motto is \"drink the coffee, do the good\". The environment is southern charm, with a rustic spin. I sat on an old headboard turned bench and the cushion was a stuffed coffee sack. My kale salad was light, fresh, and the bacon and Asian dressing gave it a savory flavor. I ordered their featured coffee of the day which was jut $4 and came in a cute Mason jar. The \"Haze\" had hazelnut and cannon with white mocha! I hope my travels bring me back to Columbus to spend more time in this intentional place!"}, {"review_id": "fDBbVv_0cb2hrF8vPkM4IA", "user_id": "teJhmB5DsIpAuqG1wrUVDw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/7/2016", "text": "Great coffee shop in a nice little quaint plaza. Went early in the morning so it was not that busy. Young lady barista was friendly and made my great tasting double shot espresso. Also ordered yogurt and BLT crossaint sandwich. Food was just okay, nothing special. Wished they offer granola or fresh fruit with the yogurt. The BLT crossaint was served on a cold crossaint - for breakfast sandwich, I'd prefer a warm/toasted.I was pleasantly surprised by their coffee and I will be definitely coming back to try their lunch menu & other coffee beverages soon!"}, {"review_id": "FRGecdv2SqPqFNzjGyU5dw", "user_id": "bDTirPzfGCPNy6euy5U1-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "This is probably my favorite local coffee house in the area!

Lunch sandwiches were iffy - I had the grown up grilled cheese. It has great potential but the cheese was a bit hard and didn't have that gooey cheesy texture I was hoping for. But it could be your cup of tea. :) The ambiance, friendly service, sustainably and ethically sourced beans and overall great tasting espresso drinks are totally worth coming back over and over!"}, {"review_id": "HyuZfSfJYdjBEId2sgan1Q", "user_id": "t1T8LU4nyTUVr8KMkSCIWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "This is, by far, the best coffee I've ever had in the Columbus, GA area.

I think it came about to be about $7. The tea was delightful! I like drinking my tea without any sweetener to get the true taste. They give you a timer for your tea, depending how strong you like it. Very good. The red velvet went pretty quick lol. Also great. It has a really nice vibe here and lots of board games. Played a whole game of scrabble. The person running the cash register was nice and very attentive.

But the people will be the reason to keep going back. At first I wasn't sure if I would like it. I'm always skeptical my first time at a coffee shop. (I've been disappointed too many times)I always judge by the espresso to know if I'll be back. Well, this is the best quality espresso I have found in town. So I obviously went back. On my 3rd time there I think I got a chemex as well. I've been trying to mix it up a little bit here and there. So far, I love everything there. I'll often spend all day there. The food is good. I try to stay away from the sweeter things. But the cinnamon rolls get me every time. They are so delicious. All the consumable items are amazing, but it's not why I keep going back. The people are what keep me there all day. I enjoy talking with them and always excited to be back on the weekends."}, {"review_id": "uctvZB1EZdFlbN4uZUI1ZQ", "user_id": "83faZcCExuPT11e2m8yS-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "We ordered a chicken salad croissant, a cinnamon roll, a turkey sandwich and hot herb tea, and all was delicious.  The atmosphere is warm, welcoming and beautiful.  We played a board game and enjoyed the attention to detail involved in making this unique business work."}, {"review_id": "bZXoJvP-jk-IZkfmvHip6w", "user_id": "9iCwwnE_yEWZm46w2VUtyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/5/2017", "text": "The best cafe in Columbus.
