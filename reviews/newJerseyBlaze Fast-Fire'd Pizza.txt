Today I a chance to finally try it! Oh boy.. What a delicious pie did I just create for us! As we got in line, one of the employees walked down the whole line and restaurant and gave every one of us a free cup to grab a drink.. priced at 2.25 each and said \"it's on us, it's hot outside\" Indeed it was about 90 degrees. They won me already!  Not everyone does this... We ordered a regular crust (thin) pie with garlic pesto on the border and regular red sauce as a base. We added mozzarella and Parmesan as our cheeses, ham and bacon as proteins and black olive, jalapeños, artichokes, onions, roasted garlic, cherry tomatoes and banana peppers! Initially I thought it was too much and also when I had my first bite. Two bites after I was in heaven. What a delicious combination! The vegetables were very fresh, and the ham they use is a roasted ham that tasted like real meat and bit boring lunch meat. The prices?! Omg! Very cheap! 1 topping is about $7, 2 toppings aprox $8. And the one we got... with as many toppings as you like.. $8.65!! What a steal! And it gets filled both me and my friend!"}, {"review_id": "FCo_tYvFsSDiSOgNFZJakQ", "user_id": "IwqXIkXQd-JNw3ZqpCcZCA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "For my 100th review, I choose Blaze in Newark to review. Yes, for my 100th review! Which tells you how I feel about Blaze! I believe the only Blaze pizza I have yet to visit is the one in Clark. I have to say of ALL the Blaze chains in NJ the NEWARK location is the most dedicated team of hard working people I have encountered.  I've read a few of these negative reviews and let me just say this, food service is hard. Very hard. People are picky, evil, mean, demanding and sometimes down right impossible. I frequent Blaze because, damn, I LOVE pizza. Particularly,  this style of pizza. I'm pretty much a self labeled Pizza Snob. The last Blaze location I visited was the Livingston branch. It was a Living effin nightmare. I had bragged all day about Blaze to my coworker and convinced her to come with me on lunch to try it. I had explained the experience so she knew what to expect. Little did I know, I didn't know what to expect. It was horrid. I was personally embarrassed by the sloppiness of this location. Sauces mixed in together. No gloves while adding on toppings or cheese. Crap all over the floor. It was mortifying. I couldn't apologize for the terror my co worker experienced as I convinced her not to call the Dept. Of health on them.I had to make this up. I'm a foodie. A food reviewer working on her own food blog and recipe site. I was NOT going out like this in her eyes!! I told her the experience in Newark is ALWAYS awesome. Even when the line is around the corner and the wait is almost an hour because of how packed it is, it is still AWESOME.  It is always fresh and way cleaner then the other locations. I credit the smooth sailing to the shift manager D-Money or Deion. He's always on top of his game. SB-Pretty mellow guy for the situations I've seen him in. I literally, on my last visit, had a irritating couple in front of me. What is the spinach for? What type of tomatoes? What's the oregano taste like? How many calories in the sea salt? Could you remove the oregano AFTER we said yes, put it on. I wanted to drop kick them both. Just being pure assholes. He kept his cool as he addressed them. I think I would have been noticeably irritated with them. #RantOverAnywho, My coworker said there was a huge difference in service, quality and cleanliness. She said she agrees that this location was the best vibe, taste and service. They smiled, they laughed,  the had PERSONALITY which fits the BLAZE  brand. She loved their fresh lemonades and I was ecstatic to include their Coconut Agua in my cup. I think all in all, the staff is awesome. I've gotten energy and smiles out of them on their 10th hour of fulfilling demands and being on their feet. I'm not excusing any attitudes but I will say this, sometimes,  you get what you give. I've never been nice to any of that staff and gotten mean or attitude out of them. I think their team is dedicated to the brand. Making it a fun experience is what matters most. They always put in the effort. I love this crew!"}, {"review_id": "xIyMJG7ZRqo53MEADBEDig", "user_id": "ZqDv43lkw5Yu3yBUHNs2-g", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "This place needs a lot of work. I think they need a whole new staff starting with manger and shift leads and employees. I am visiting Newark from California and the POOR service that i received was totally unacceptable. From the off duty mangers coming in trying to run shifts they aren't working. To the off duty tram members waiting around for a  meeting. Filling up there own bottles of soda. not a good representation of the Blaze way.  This was by far this was the worse experience i received at a blaze pizza. I wish i could give a negative rating"}, {"review_id": "LsYzgxDoDHUcrSUy_xRmYw", "user_id": "42OZU0r2JZ5Q-PWa3_F2jg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "I love the pizza here and have been coming since the location opened.

The line at any given time can have 10 people in it and the wait will literally be about 40 minutes. I recommend ordering online and picking up because it's way faster than standing in line.

I live for blaze Pizzzaaaaaaaaaa!! So after staring a new job in Newark I've been so anxious to find some of my go to spots. I can now finally say I have my pizza spot!!  The setup here is like most of the trendy higher end fast food places  ( i.e. Chipotle). And just like Chipotle it's different options you choose from to personalize your pizza. Starting with the type of dough than sauce than the actual toppings ( cheese, veggies, meats). For a beginner like myself I was glad to see they had some signature pies to base mine off of because I was a little overwhelmed at first glance.I was meeting my mother for lunch and she's been here before so she knew she was going to get the white top and I decided on the meat lover. Both extremely good but in different ways. The white top was an Alfredo sauce with bacon on top and than arugula! The meat lover was the red sauce ( I didn't realize there was a spicy red till after ) mozzarella, pepperoni, Italian sausage and red onions!!It's about 8 bucks per person which isn't bad because it a great size personal pie !! I paired it with their blood orange lemonade AHMAZIMG!! And I saw the desserts which looked heavenly the Brownie and the S'more Pie ! I was too stuffed to even try it but next time!! All around Phenomenal experience there 5 stars baby !!

Special gem is their flavored/infused teas. So yum! Also, if you really want to be efficient not wasting one moment of your lunchtime-- download the app (; I literally had to put myself on probation. Otherwise I'd be eating pizza every day!

Secondly I'm highly upset at the fact that I have been a Blaze customer for a very longtime  now and I turned Vegan while still staying a loyal customer to you guys & yet sadly I was misinformed for several months at this location. I usually would put the pesto sauce on my crust when making my pizza but I wasn't told until recently that it has cheese in it, mind you I have been making Vegan Pies here for at least 7 months now and no employee had told me. Please educate the employees to avoid mistake like this in the future.

It's conveniently located near NJPAC, Prudential Center, and Penn Station. On a warm day, you could grab your pie and head across the street to Military Park. I typically start with one of their 8 pie ideas and then customize it. Tonights order: art lover (artichokes, mozzarella, ricotta, chopped garlic, red sauce dollops) with no ricotta, add roasted garlic, garlic pesto around crust, and drizzled with pesto when out of the oven. Soooo delicious! The pie is $8.25 and lasts me two (small) meals. The Blaze experience takes about 5 minutes if there isn't a line. With a line, it's maybe 7 minutes from start to finish. When you pay, ask for a drink and fill your cup with the blood orange lemonade. Make sure you pay with the app and earn flames towards a reward!While Blaze is pretty perfect in my eyes, I wish there was some consistency when it comes to the pride their employees take while building my pizza. I want them to build my pie the same way that they would build their own...with love. I am almost always happy, but I've had two occasions where my pie was thrown together. P.S. - They recently added salad."}, {"review_id": "pA9PPxRJ6xyTfd7spVJWiQ", "user_id": "kArTuWjGVEHXDvXcEvYh-w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/5/2017", "text": "Customize your fresh made brick oven pizza for $9....you can't ask for anything better in life. This chain is just amazing with fresh ingredients, large variety, customization - which basically means we are at fault to be GLUTTONS!! Each time I visit the pizza ingredients always change and it is absolutely delicious every single time. Great lunch spot but honestly this location gets SWAMPED at lunch time from all the local businesses like Prudential, Rutgers, etc.. So definitely come during off peak hours! Also when you are deciding the ingredients you won't be rushed. Highly highly recommend this chain!!! So fresh and delicious - you have to at least try it. It is perfect for vegetarians AND meat lovers. Additionally, Its great to share a pizza with someone especially if you have a lot of ingredients - the pizza ends up beings SOOO big and filling. So I highly recommend bringing a friend to share!Enjoy!"}, {"review_id": "doqc4RzgGQi34ynVOetNLg", "user_id": "-B3orHP1H8Q0vfpbjtJyvw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "1. Horrible customer service. HORRIBLE. Each employee that works there is visibly miserable. The worst is the guy at the end of the line that takes your payment and cuts the pizza before putting it in the box. He was so angry for no reason, slamming pizzas down on the counter and had a nasty attitude every time the customer asked for something. I can't believe they let someone so nasty work behind the counter and actually talk to customers. Also, they move extremely slow.2. Pizza was horrible. I got the BBQ Chicken pizza and it lacked flavor in every way possible. There was no flavor at all from the onions and cheese they threw on the pie. There was barley any chicken. Then the guy at the end threw on BBQ sauce and that's basically what you tasted: pizza dough and BBQ sauce. I don't get what the hype is over this place, I've tried a few different pizzas and they've been pretty bland so far.
