Proceeds went to charity. I haven't been there before, but I think we'll be back. We had a great time! The food was awesome! Super good potato salad, delicious and cool deconstructed bibimpbap board, great cured meats, and flavorful Asian-inspired wings. The flow of the event was great, and I really like the decor and space inside. It's warm and inviting without feeling crowded. The hostess was really nice and friendly too. Great service. The drinks were all really good too! I think one of my bartenders was from there, but I can't remember. If so, all the drinks were good. We went with two friends, and it's one of their favorite restaurants. We can see why; can't wait to check out the full menu some day. I hope they have another event like this in the future!"}, {"review_id": "gfJqRqlPhwbZ1byY4kjRkQ", "user_id": "OZNGn3B1oeD6q8MShZxxcw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "I'm a fan of Heritage Tavern. I'm a sucker for the trendy/cozy/casual/sleek atmosphere, and the waitstaff is always pleasant. I've visited Heritage three or four times for brunch and once for dinner. I walked out happy each time.I've had the veggie eggs benedict and veggie omelet for brunch visits. The benedict was fine. The eggs were cooked just how I like them, perhaps a little too soft for others. The veggies were lacking. There were a few pieces of spinach and some tomatoes. Overall it tasted fine.I was a big fan of the veggie omelet and inhaled it in about five minutes. It was full of root vegetables including carrots, parsnips and some other vegetables I didn't take the time to observe. The egg omelet itself was delightfully fluffy and not at all overcooked like you may get with some novice omelets. I cannot remember what I got for dinner, there were many drinks involved and my meal in general is just this vague recollection of deliciousness. It was some kind of polenta dish. I can say with confidence that the drinks are very good.I don't think this place is for everyone. My friend was a big curmudgeon about the decor, edison light bulbs, the fact that he had to ask for salt and pepper, and then that the salt was served in a cute little glass swan. It's definitely on the hipster/trendy side, I would call it a stereotypical Madison destination. I'll definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "oj94Sq_H_Tjkgs2iyMotaw", "user_id": "kh_FXguZJv4lQ1BFSMA08g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "First time dining here. Based on Chad's review, this was on our list. As usual he was spot on!  Thx Chad. Good wine and beer selection. Food is the star though. We shared three dishes:  freaking amazing deviled eggs. Very creative and omg taste. Also tried cheese curds. Also top notch. Star of the show was the schnitzel. One of the most flavorful pieces of pork ever!  Loved every bite. Only negative for us was server seemed to think we had never dined out before and explained what spaetzle was, and pointed way to close to our food for our comfort. Some may like that style but it was off-putting for me. I believe its better to ask \"have you ever had x, Y or Z\" before rather than assume your customer is a pendejo. Other than that we really enjoyed out meal. Place is upscale so dress accordingly."}, {"review_id": "7WZPgTte0JItJxQK5mi9-A", "user_id": "9brb3jp3oZVIlL5jt4ilCA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Stellar Brunch review coming through!Must get the Bloody here! I could arguably say it's one, if not the best in Madison. Great flavor, bacon is thick and magically still has this crisp to it even when soaking in the bloody. Entree awards goes to Smoked Whitefish, Crab, and Bacon Cake, Hazelnut French Toast if you have a sweet tooth, and the Heritage Tavern Benedict (great twist to a classic with frying the eggs and giving a kick to the hollandaise sauce).Other Honorable mentions to consider is the Old Fashioned Ham and Cheese Omelet and Truffled Egg Gratin (could use a little more truffle).Save your stomach to complete your meal with the doughnuts & espresso-coffee ganache. Great pair and the slightly bitter ganache levels out the sugary sweet doughnuts. All-in-all delish and recommend!"}, {"review_id": "3lIRHbZJlQoNPoZgf4g3gg", "user_id": "w7RP1MZad3YO7Vjgp3s3Dg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/29/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Updating my review as this is my 4th time here. Chef Dan , thank you for the great food and hospitality. You did me wrong!! Everything was delicious as always and service by Laura was impeccable. Truly enjoyed the food, especially the grouper and tomahawk special. Th foie gras that night was spectacular, both with the pork belly as our appetizer and with the tomahawk special. My guests truly enjoyed their experience. Thank you also for the comp dish as well. That was a nice surprise and we truly appreciate and enjoyed it. I will definitely be a regular here now as I come every month to Madison for business and I stay at AC hotel which is located conveniently from your resto. Thank you again and see you very soon. Trust!!!!"}, {"review_id": "zsqtDu1zudcVs9a19OAYXg", "user_id": "0RmBe3_3nXLE6bGiC8FvGA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/9/2017", "text": "I love places that play with the whole tapas concept. You get to try several dishes without breaking the bank or wasting the food if it wasn't to your palette! This place kinda falls in the middle with a good portion of dishes tapas style and the rest typical dinner sized.Ambiance : Modern and has all the right elements for a fine dining joint. But nothing stands out as it plays safe, which is fine. The place where we sat had a long couch lined up against the wall , split up to accommodate several tables, but you could easily get the vibe of a community dinner if you sat in the front middle :).Service : Decent, not bad not great. Our server/s took a little longer than expected to kick things off but eventually got the dishes on time. They never bothered to ask how did we find the food/dishes. We were though informed about each dish before being served.Food : We decided to avoid the larger plates and play around sampling the smaller ones. We ordered Crisp Pork Belly & Black Fin Tuna, Tempura Bacon-Wrapped Cheese Curds, Lobster Mushroom and Foie gras (Forgot the actual name) and for dessert Rhubarb CrispThe pork belly dish had 3 actors - the pork belly, foie gras and tuna. All three are champions of subtle flavor so although this dish was very tasty, it missed a \"punch or dynamic\" element to balance it. The cheese curds were our favorite! The combination of bland cheese and salty bacon was spot on! And the trio of dips had a fermented fish sauce which elevated this \"stick\" food to a whole another level!! A must try if you come here!!The Lobster mushroom dish was our least favorite. The mushrooms were a bit too earthy and hard for our taste. Not to mention the raw flavor did not go well with the otherwise excellent foie gras. And I wasn't a big fan of the sandwich toast bed even though it did absorb the sauce like a sponge to help the flavor when you ate it all together.Lastly, the dessert was another star for us. We love Elderflower. We love rhubarb. Pair them together and you get sweet dreams!! YummmNot perfect, with room for improvement (lobster mushroom no no) but a certainly one of the better joints in the city!"}, {"review_id": "y8fev5-GnTzfbAOSYhytTg", "user_id": "jR2X4zeOaKB1InyCjDfIUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Neverending surprises!...

We had a little time to kill before the show at the Overture. There was plenty of seating at the bar and in the dining room when we arrived. There were a few different groups of customers in the bar area. Some in suits and business attire and some just casually hanging out and socializing. They have a nice selection of wines and tap beers on special. I opted for a stout and it was pretty good. I was surprised that it did not come in a pint glass though. I understand that some of the higher alcohol beers will come in a variety of smaller portion glasses. But, this was a basic stout and still came in a smaller pour. The restaurant was not very busy, but our tacos took quite a while to show up after we ordered. The two corn tortilla tacos came with a salsa verde on the side. The pork left a greasy aftertaste and the taco seemed pretty flavorless without the salsa verde lathered on top. I definitely have had better pork tacos in Madison (and cheaper too!). I would come back to try their veggie tacos or a variety of other items I saw listed on the menu. After seeing quite a few cocktails being made, I will definitely be back to sample a couple of those too."}, {"review_id": "HeTEl0KfkPElGG52lTbg1w", "user_id": "WEO4AW75i86EiMEfH0mRfw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "Outstanding breakfast.

Heritage Tavern has a unique ambiance and lovely atmosphere. Cocktails are inventive and delicious. Service is top notch. But the food is the main attraction as it should be. My squash lobster soup was to die for, tempura cheese curds wrapped in bacon with truffle dip were the best ones we've had in Wisconsin (yes,even better than at Craftsman and Old fashioned). My octopus was good but I was not blown away. Pork belly with tuna belly and foie gras was the craziest surf and turf we've ever seen on a menu and was simply an explosion of taste. And finally porchetta ended up impressing my spoiled European husband to the point of him admitting that it was the best dish he has ever had anywhere!

That was very thoughtful.They had a Yorkshire pudding on special. Theirs featured pulled pork and was almost too salty to eat. I would've liked to know that there was pork in it...I'm not vegetarian but I usually try to avoid pork and I wasn't expecting meat inside of the pastry. I left the crust at the bottom because it was swimming in enough oil/butter to make Paula Deen weep for joy. I'm a foodie...I cook with ghee and butter and oil, but this much liquid fat pooling at the bottom of my dish was pretty gross to look at. I wouldn't order their Yorkshire​ pudding ever again. And their pork was just way too salty. I felt kinda gross after eating it, like I needed a kale & cucumber salad to feel 'clean' again.The tiny cast-iron ramekin it was baked in was adorbs, and now I want a set of them. I'm sure I can make way better Yorkshire puddings at home.I had the Peanut oil Fried white fish and it was very good. Hubs had the pistachio-crusted grouper. We tried each other's​ dishes and were very pleased.Chocolate Espresso Opera cake for dessert, along with a cappucino. Wine was good too!Service was great.

I've seen photos of Heritage Taverns food all over Instagram and was very excited to try it! So I called to make a reservation for Saturday morning. Upon walking in I was blown away by the decor. It is super cute in there.. from the holiday themed entry way to the antler beer taps. The hostess seated us right away, but it took at least 7 minutes for our server to address us (wasn't too busy), which is always kind of frustrating when they walk past you five times and don't acknowledge you or say \"I'll be with you shortly\". He was very friendly once he finally came over, and gave me a sample of their Bloody Mary mix to try. I ordered the beef sirloin, frites, and eggs. The sirloin seemed decent quality, but the rest of the dish was pretty lackluster. Nothing really had much flavor.. the fries seemed bland, and didn't seem like an appropriate pairing with the rest of the dish. The fried poached egg was over-cooked, and the hollandaise lacked any flavor profile as well. It seemed strange because the presentation was beautiful, but the meal was overly pretty bland. My friends felt the same way about their dishes (lobster scramble and tavern Benedict) It could be that this restaurant is aiming for an overly simplistic menu but I wasn't blown away. All in all, this place has a great atmosphere and other things on their menu intrigue me, but it wouldn't be my first recommendation."}, {"review_id": "qdFsuBTcJPEpaMiSAcbctA", "user_id": "ufpJzsNnX3CRuyIimgl4BA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "Recently dined here for brunch with some friends and was disappointed. I ordered the old fashioned ham cinnamon roll and that was the highlight of the meal. We ordered the lobster scramble, beef sirloin, frites and eggs and the classic benedict. Presentation was beautiful but all the food was very bland and unsatisfying, even their homemade ketchup. No real flavor. Very cute space. Simplistic, natural vibe.
