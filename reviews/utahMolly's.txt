After first stepping in here, for lunch on Friday, I knew I had found the right place!The smell, is amazing! I was taken back by how clean everything is!!! The employees are constantly checking on the customers, to make sure they have everything they need, and they are quick to clear out the tables.Honestly: I don't think there has ever been a restaurant where I felt that it was as clean, had friendly customers, and this excellent food!!!Okay, let me get in to what I ordered: I ordered their ribs... Honestly, I'm lost for words with how wonderful it is! The meat, TRULY is the best I've ever had... I have been to 20 different places, and tried their ribs, but if isn't even remotely close to how amazing they were at Molly's!The food is AMAZING, customer service is amazing, and the prices are remarkable.I urge you all to check this place out, on a Friday, and try their ribs... You'll probably cry, but it'll be tears of happiness"}, {"review_id": "deLxo0G9VPA6B_Xi3MsHLg", "user_id": "3Iw4cxfU-KxP4JRFeoebpA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "If you're craving a home cooked meal, go to Molly's. It'll feel like you just got dished by a best friend's mom. I usually get their pulled pork sandwich and a couple sides but their entrees are great too. The hours are a bit odd but they're also a catering service so I think that's why.

The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly. I liked the cafeteria style of food. You choose your meat, side, and bread. The brisket was delicious and I loved the tortellini salad. The dishes change most days. The lemonade was sweet and refreshing as well. There were flowers on all the tables and the place was full of people having a good time. Check the times they're open because it is not all day. Lunch goes from 12-2 and then they don't open again until dinner.

I love that you have complete control of what you eat. You pick your entree and you choose the sides. I had the pomegranate chicken with tomato soup and a pear salad. I was very satisfied with allMy choices, however the salad was on the small side. We went for a family girls night and everyone enjoyed their meal! A hit amongst the whole table was the chocolate cake we all shared. It was delicious! The one draw back to my meal was this: although I chose my sides, I feel like it's a bit odd to serve a chicken dish without some sort of standard accompanied base like rice, pasta, quinoa or couscous. They had lots of choices for potatoes as a side but I think chicken should come with some sort or mandatory side. Is that silly? My chicken looked bare on the plate by itself smothered in sauce that would have paired nicely over some sort of base.You'll also always want to check the hours of Molly's and make sure no one has scheduled it for a private party.Overall, delicious, great service and will be eating here again."}, {"review_id": "ocsHjGGjautyCHE80M5TTg", "user_id": "8erGerll2tPmp_ztSqJl8A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/31/2017", "text": "Molly's is a must try.

Molly's is cost efficient and tastes just like mom's cooking. If mom would have been a better cook. So my other mormon friend's mom. I have tried everything on the menu except for the salads and there hasn't been anything I wouldn't order again.Did I forget to mention how affordable this place is? Nothing is overpriced and everything is so rich and creamy and flavorful. I cannot eat the portions they give in one sitting and it could be easily shared by two people... maybe three if you aren't an over eater... odds are you are.Now let me give the one knock against them. Their hours are horrible. Great for their employees because they probably work a normal 8-5 (prep cooking, serving, and clean up). For anyone who is trying to go to this place... don't plan on a pop in working. Now that I don't live as close, it is likely I won't ever go again which makes me sad, but when you have those kind of hours... some people get screwed. But I am sure they're doing just fine.THE VERDICT: You will feel so warm and comfy here. You will be like hey grandma thanks for cooking... unless you have my grandma who is not great at cooking. Remember the hours suck... but if you can ever find a time to go... you better go or else... grandma will come after you and she will find you!"}, {"review_id": "yEkKEfSaRNA-BBNzTosHIg", "user_id": "EeUuoZlPb2kuLKTijqWyqg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "This place is great, and the food is amazing!

But at first I thought I had stumbled into a retirement home. That's on me though, because I was eating dinner at 4:30.It's set up as a cafeteria style restaurant which put me off at first until I tried the food. It tasted like visiting grandmas house for Sunday dinner; classic meat, potatoes, and veggies made with love and capped off with the perfect Shirley's roll.I've had Marvellous Catering before, but having the food fresh out of the kitchen proved to be an excellent decision."}, {"review_id": "-d4z3EOQ_ynd889DeWdURw", "user_id": "FXlyGZnig8KdNoeSr6gNWQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/22/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I probably eat here once a month and have never had a bad meal.

Boy was I wrong. This is Sunday dinner my mom made many years ago. That's both good and bad. The vegetables are cooked for as many hours as the meat with the braised meat. So, the veg is mushy. However, that's what mom did, and it tastes OK. The salad and dressing was first class. The mashed potatoes are just what I grew up with. It's \"real\" gravy. It uses the same shortcuts mom did. It's obviously thickened with cornstarch, or similar, rather than making a roux. I'm really OK with all that. The clientele when I was there was slanted to the older side life.They exceed what they are tell you they are going to do. Everyone was friendly. The place is clean.We are constantly looking for a place that isn't a chain and serves food my 88 year old parents find comfortable. This place has it in spades, and will enter regular rotation when taking them out. It will also be regular for me when I don't want to cook and don't want fast food. Molly's could easily be mediocre cafeteria food. Instead it's quality comfort food."}, {"review_id": "M8JWW429110WGoyGiCW-OA", "user_id": "yXqkmGm_KMz0-jPVbytyLA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2017", "text": "Best homestyle American cooking in Utah, a+ quality and taste every time I've been, it is kind of a cafeteria style serving just be aware, I only wish they were open more regularlly"}, {"review_id": "0TQn0tOy59-IsPFB6w-0tQ", "user_id": "1S6SBFyXV4awbjLG3Y4AXg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/21/2017", "text": "My boss introduced me to this cafe and it has fulfilled my quest for a real home-styled restaurant. I am very fond of the brisket but always choose the French Chicken with the creamy gravy. Sides change on a regular basis, but the mashed potatoes are a good fit with the chicken; my other side selections vary from either the house salad, chicken noodle soup, or the green beans. I love the white role to dip into the extra gravy.
