You can see a few of the pictures I've post, but I just want to mention what a vast improvement it made. The flooring is a factory finished 3/4\"  (thick) solid white oak that brightens the entire place. The movement of the counters to the sides makes the space feel so much more open. You now enter through the right door and exit through the left, which also leads you to the new spot to place your order. Now I will tell you that if you're a regular, you pay when you order. It used to be pay when you finished, but that's too much. You know what you want.      Some of the antiques are still for sale, but intermixed is work by a nearby pottery place. There is local honey and that great handmade mustard still available as well as some Hildebrandt's swag (cups, shirts). The front stage area has been removed and two tables put in its place so now you can sit near the sidewalk, without being outside. *Insider's Tip-Get dessert. Even if you don't think you want it, you do. I had a slice of Bailey's pound cake and...wow. Dense, moist, and the aroma alone (not to mention the flavor) had me smiling. Whatever Luanne had baked up, get ya some."}, {"review_id": "zLvK5ZrPm3OpQUDGLHQ9FQ", "user_id": "iipaDtoA1zHFkbAF3Gn5Rg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Had lunch here on a Saturday with the fam after the Augusta farmers market. Pros: tasty food, plenty of seating, friendly service, and 10% off with a Yelp Check in! Delicious German potato salad. Cons: portion sizes were on the small side. I was starving and ordered the pork chop sandwich. The sandwich had a small thin piece of pork chop. They do say on the menu that they don't want you to fill up on bread and to order extra meat if you want a lot. I recommend ordering the extra. Overall I recommend it...gotta love a local place!"}, {"review_id": "AFPeqeH4Mj8Bcr12JLckiw", "user_id": "_d-HC7_GyWEEgjevFgE1VQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Boy what a swell authentic  German restaurant. So nastalgic and family oriented. It was like stepping back in time for me. I first came here in the late 70s. They still taste great and deliver great service. The menu is basic with German favorites such as German potato salad, pickled dill cucumbers(freshly made). They still have a real deli meat counter. Everything is freshly made. No long wait. The building has wood floors and very high ceilings. 1800 style. The people who work her are friendly and ready to assist. The Hilderbrants daughter ms. Lou Ann is still here running things the way her family always did. She comes out and speak to customers thanking them for patronage. She gave me a little history and even let me take a picture. If you want to step back in time and enjoy pleasant atmosphere and good food, Hilderbrants is still here for us."}, {"review_id": "zqwzzsNowtCGU2O-ug0Onw", "user_id": "VV3DJa2FllO_k4IOknyN-Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Food was delicious (and reminded me of my time in Germany!). The only downside is that I had asked if the sodas were included in the regular combo, but after looking at my receipt they had charged me $0.50 more. Something minor, but I wouldn't have left a tip if I had known. Otherwise the store was very quaint and a hidden gem of Augusta. Wish I had more time to look around the store."}, {"review_id": "iCUodvkBxlFc0lefrUpoQg", "user_id": "TPNeU81MN_o4kOo2jy4thw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/18/2017", "text": "Hildebrandt's is located in a old building in downtown Augusta. Part flea market/antique store and deli/restaurant. You will need to find street parking because I did not see any parking lot. We came on a Saturday for lunch. As you enter the restaurant you see an old store counter and loads of photos, and bric-a-brac making you feel like you entered a flea market by mistake, but you are greeted by smiling people who give you a menu and wait while you make up your mind. The menu is part German cuisine and just deli type sandwiches. I ordered a veggie sandwich with a pasta salad side and my friend ordered a hamburger. After you order they guide you to the back of the restaurant to get your drink at a self service table. Plenty of seating at various old chairs and tables. While everything was old and maybe a little battered, it was all very clean. After a while someone brings your food to your table. We both enjoyed both our plates, the pasta salad was excellent. As you're eating you can't help checking out ALL the stuff surrounding the tables. They also sell some of the items and Hildebrant t-shirts. When you are finished you take your ticket up to the counter and pay, I think our lunch was under 15 dollars. It was a great experience, good food, friendly service and cheap. It is something to see if you find yourself in downtown Augusta."}, {"review_id": "Hyb3tUkx0qqP2zDXp1cb-Q", "user_id": "DutVKv2_Orvh9qG1uUOgsg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/3/2017", "text": "After going to Cafe 209 and ended up leaving because they got my order wrong, I figured I try to find the place since I saw on my maps it was 295 feet away from me. Turned to be a great place to visit and get food at. I took a look around and I truly liked what the place looked like. The woman at the cash register approached me and asked if I needed any help and I told her that I was looking around and was going to order something. She kindly lend me a menu and I asked her a couple of questions about the hot dogs there. She told me they were all beef since I don't eat pork and happily rung me up when I ordered the sausage overload with chocolate brownie. It only cost $7:29 much better than cafe 209 and very excellent mannerisms and service. I'm glad I was able to find this place. I highly recommend this place."}, {"review_id": "O4Kq87dkh3aT_CsopQm_1g", "user_id": "QdwqY3MY4zW4RosA1ZTcpQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "From the super friendly service, cutesy decor, great location, to the amazing food Hildebrandt's is a must for a great lunch!

I fear for the day it closes as they have the best Rueben in town. It's almost impossible to find family run restaurants like this anymore. We go there often, have the shirts, and buy sausages and bratwursts to take with us! A great unique place to take out of town guests.

We looked no further than here. There was ample, free parking which is a huge plus. I will say that I suspect we may have just gotten lucky to park where we did. It was about 1120 in the morning - prior to the lunch rush. I was pleased when we walked in because as advertised - it felt like an old feed store. We were greeted warmly by the staff as soon as we walked in. Another plus. Good customer service is becoming increasingly harder to find. My wife ordered the club with German potato salad and I ordered the traditional Rueben with German potato salad. Another plus in ordering is you have multiple options as to how they make your sandwich (rye, wheat, white, etc). The man who took our order excitedly told us there were two remaining pieces of homemade Coca Cola Cake. There was no hesitating. They were ours! We finished ordering and sat down at tables like grandma and grandpa had in their houses - table clothes and all. The entire place had a feel of the late 1800's. I was waiting for the sheriff to ride up on his horse outside. While we waited for our lunch - we ate our dessert and it was amazing!  'Nuff said there. Lunch came and before I could finish my small, warm, perfectly authentic German potato salad, my wife had devoured her club. My Reuben didn't stand a chance either. Overall, this is a great place to eat and I cannot wait to go back. Next time I'll bring guests."}, {"review_id": "eru4g8Qh2WKgWAWB6fIS6w", "user_id": "DZOohb3nx_rbyQnNjT2tfw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Kind of a different atmosphere but very friendly staff and very good food.

I was in Augusta for the day and it seemed like Hildebrandt's reigns supreme as far as lunch options go. I walked in and ordered a pastrami ruben, since well it seemed like the thing to do! The woman manning the counter who was also the owner was super friendly. I explained how it was my first time and she helped show me the ropes a bit as far as where the drinks were and waiting on your order. I went with the german potato salad as my side, again because it seemed like the thing to do! Both items did not disappoint, it was a super satisfying, delicious, and affordable lunch. There is a ton of cool history to the place and the owner was explaining to me how the front part use to be a market her grandfather ran. When that model started to change they began focusing mostly on the deli. Really neat and delicious family run shop, they can tell they really care that you have a great experience there!"}, {"review_id": "yO4z64HwSsNrM5-Zd6kjGg", "user_id": "9e-9eQw-sRt3dS84KGu4HQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/4/2017", "text": "Great setting great folks.   Food was good to especially the German potato salad.  Even the train wanted in, came by when we were ordering.
