I have never had a bad slice here, bad experience, bad beer, bad company. Everyone is great there, the front staff is knowledgeable and perky, and the kitchen must be having a great time because you'll hear them cracking jokes or singing. The pizza is incredible, the crust is chewy, the ingredients are fresh. This place rocks!  The wife and my favorite pizza is the Chuck Norris. Their pepperoni is bomb too and they have some funky ones that are great as well like the Alpha Omega. Great place to get amazing food, great beer or local sodas and enjoy the scenery."}, {"review_id": "L3Q3OpiUxanoOT8ECP6cJA", "user_id": "Cp9QxfJtHkVFa3e3b168-A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "One of my favorite pizza places in he Treasure Valley!I have loved every different combination of pizza I've had from Messenger.  I have ordered it by the slice or by the pie.  I like their breadsticks and their breads.  The garlic cheese breadsticks are my favorite, but I like the pesto ones as well.I also like that the ingredients used are responsible and as natural as possible."}, {"review_id": "njmpRe7eogNGLdEvsY-yeg", "user_id": "nuESv6JeYhIpidfpLI8O8w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/7/2017", "text": "Atmosphere:The environment is very hip. The lighting, decor is funky. Very modern, and if you've ever been to California it would totally fit the Berkeley Vibe. Staff:She was very busy!  The cashier was going 100x miles per minute. She was answering phones, taking phone orders, refilling the salad bar, and bussing tables. Wheew! Make me sleepy watching her. Prices:Pretty reasonable. Food:First and foremost I'm a pizza carnivore. I have incredibly high expectations for pizza. We shared pepperoni and sausage pizza.  The slices are HUGE, New York style. The fresh ingredients are always a nice refresher. They are also known for their fresh / unique ingredients. Could of used more sauce. Not the BEST nor Worse I've ever had. Somewhere in between. Parking / Venue:It's downtown Nampa, so parking is a bit limited. Enough access for wheelchair. Specialities / what \"they\" are known for: Huge pizza and huge drink selection Star rating:3 out of 5 stars. More importantly Would we ever go back? Ehh! It's kinda a long drive for average pizza. Again, I'm a pizza snob."}, {"review_id": "73G6FfMhnk_VqT5IAP9SaQ", "user_id": "P-llxhScdegNv4IXQdGZbQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "This has got to be mine and my husbands favorite pizza joint ever!

Has that eclectic hipster vibe going on which is perfect for hanging with friends, eating pizza, and drinking some brews. They have a nice selection of craft beers. My only reason for the 3 stars is the main event...the pizza. Yes, the visual stimulation of the large slices is pretty cool when you first look at it but the taste is mediocre at best. It was actually a little disappointing because it had great potential with all that it had going for them. It could've been a one day fluke so I'm definitely gonna give this place another try in hopes the pizza is better."}, {"review_id": "-XEZPbZQO7J6TegsVVF3Mg", "user_id": "emyF6YJc40GnFET3qByLkg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Good pizza, good prices, my husband loves the salad bar but I live that you can get unique pizza by the slice.

I live in upstate NY and you would think I had access to loads of tasty pizza. Not so. Messengers pizza is a spot I always hit when I visit my family. The crust is perfect, with those amazing crusty bubbles on the crust. They don't skimp on size and toppings. I found it a bit pricey to get a large pizza and one side salad, no drinks, for $32 but I'm willing to pay more for good, home made food. Definitely check this joint out. Also has a nice eclectic vibe but is still comfortable."}, {"review_id": "uApBnEr7ETK91anLJI4SuA", "user_id": "j-S8HA2HMZD2yuTMpax-Lw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2017", "text": "I can't believe I've never reviewed Messenger! I love this place. I was once addicted to their slices, then I was addicted to their salad bar. I'm still addicted to their crack-filled Goddess dressing (Disclaimer: there is no actual crack in their dressing, but I cannot stop eating it. Additional disclaimer: I have never smoked crack) - especially poured over their fresh greens, beets and raisins. It's sounds weird but it's delicious - trust me. My latest addiction has to do with the addition of their wraps many moons ago. Just writing this review is making me crave their hummus and veggie wrap, which comes with chips and a cookie. For all the positives, there are two cons: 1. it gets incredibly busy and loud, and 2. the bathroom situation could be better. Still, when I move away from Nampa, Messenger will be at the top of the list of eateries I will miss!I better go get a hummus and veggie wrap now. You know, for old time's sake!"}, {"review_id": "cxzH5JQxo--Sg9aXl8jzVA", "user_id": "MS5JP-Tuzl8Kch4h1XtbZw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2017", "text": "This place is Awesome from lanterns hanging from the ceilings, to boho decor and mismatched seating. The pizzas are huge, which is why being able to have the option of buying by the slice is a win, especially as it gives you the chance to try more than one kind of pizza. The pizzas have unusual toppings, and basic ones so each family member can have the choice to be adventurous or not. The salads are great and the option for beers and cider on tap made for fun tastings.Having lived all over the US, this would rank high on my  fav pizza places from the food to the atmosphere, it is also a draw to drive to Nampa and enjoy the old town feel and cute, random stores. I would highly recommend this place and encourage you to stand in the line, which moves fast, to enjoy a date night, group hang or family night out with the kids.  A definite win for Nampa!"}, {"review_id": "tG_ZTzV36IR0l58xzm8lbw", "user_id": "iCYGGAiVNZpPkVONIcK7bQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/27/2017", "text": "We pulled into Nampa later and didn't feel like eating at a chain restaurant.

It's definitely your best bet in Nampa for Pizza by the slice. They have specialty pizzas as well, they are pretty tasty as well. The pizza is thin like NY style pizza. Tried the natural soda-not for me- Dr Pepper all the way! I wish they'd put a garlic shaker out if they haven't already. 4 stars since it's not quite NY style but it's still really good pizza."}, {"review_id": "eK3-80T2OmtlbktcuEQxhg", "user_id": "TMXUQO7Pcu1-qRLXS3cIBA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "7/19/2017", "text": "The vibe and setting in here is very chill and relaxing.  They also have some comfy chairs in a few spots. I would say go just to hang out. However, I can't speak well of the pizza. The dough is good, but the pizza hardly has any sauce on it at all. They serve slices, but no cheese. So what happens if you are a plain Jane or just in the mood for a good ol fashioned regular slice of pizza? You are out of luck. You can choose from crazy combos. That's it. I'm all for keeping it interesting, but I do feel any pizza place should serve cheese and pepperoni as options as they are a staple in the pizza world. I've gone here twice, to give it a chance, but my thoughts remain the same. I also tried a small cheese and bacon pizza but the B-12 bacon was like sickeningly sweet. I wasn't a fan."}, {"review_id": "SFdJktod3FgN78QMQS07eA", "user_id": "WIB-6x2zZXa3vgR-tyTvhQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/18/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Nampa Idaho has a few good secrets and this is one of them.

Immediately upon entrance, there's a blackboard with their current wine list which features exclusively local wines. They also have a variety of craft beer on tap as well as bottles/cans. Their name bills them as a brewery, but I didn't notice any of their beers on tap? Not sure if I just missed them or not. They also have BuckSnort (local, Boise soda makers) ginger beer, orange cream soda, and root beer on tap.Given that BuckSnort makes some of the most perfectly rendered ginger beer around--I went for that (which is served beer style, in a pint glass--no ice--perfection!). My dining companion and I ordered their Red Velvet Nun pizza. It was a deliciously simple combo of olive oil, fresh mozzarella, basil, and tomatoes on a sourdough crust (your crust options are original, wheat, sourdough, or gluten free). Both my dining companion and I were impressed with the flavor of the crust as well as the olive oil. The pizza was simply scrumptious. The service is a bit slow, but was to be expected given they were pretty busy inside as well as having a constant stream of people picking up to-go orders. The atmosphere can best be described (for Boise peeps) as a sort of combo between Flying Pie and Pie Hole--hipster, chill, and just a little bit funky.For those that are dairy intolerant, they do offer goat cheese. I noticed the people in front of me ordered a pizza, specifying that they are dairy intolerant, and the cashier made certain to speak directly to those making the pizza to ensure that no other cheese, other than goat cheese, made it on their pizza.Overall, a great meal in a cool atmosphere!Get to it!"}, {"review_id": "SN8ZncKOctDqelAs5_TrbQ", "user_id": "OitnaEfbVen_v9h2SM77RA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/15/2017", "text": "This place has been recommended to us a few times and we finally had the time to try it.  It is one of my favorite pizza places in the valley now.

We also got Blue Sky Root Beer to go with it. It was so delicious we are the whole pizza - just the two of us.

The cheesy garlic bread sticks were yummy. The edges were pretty burnt and hard though. I have been craving a good pesto roll and saw theirs in the case. When I got it the roll was cold and had cherry tomatoes and artichokes in it. I could not even taste the pesto. I was extremely disappointed. It was only $3 but 98% went into the garbage. The atmosphere was nice. I wished the salad bar was not $6 for the basics (they may have been closing it) because there was only a few things in it."}, {"review_id": "a5fHrdw4L6FC-vMkju5GJQ", "user_id": "vAA0EvCqnLQXw2POejVztQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/11/2017", "text": "THE BEST PIZZA AT THE BEST PRICE!!!Great selection of beer and seriously, you can't beat their lunch specials!!!"}, {"review_id": "TL3yqeGceTHncE_I0c2Q1Q", "user_id": "Sr5Ndb9XdbRX3zr8U20rDw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/8/2017", "text": "Hubby and I are about as pizza snobbish as you get. We grew up in Europe with the amazing wood stove cooked pizzas, and we LOVE Messenger's. We can't get over the HUGE pizzas here, the thin, bubbly crust, and the fabulous pesto. My favorite pizza here is the Drunken Goat but it has to be ordered seperately from the readily available slices in the warmer. The pizzas here are typically a pepperoni, a pesto pizza and a Jalapeño Popper pizza (which is my second favorite). The pesto sticks are amazing. I have heard rave reviews of the salad bar, too, which is not really my thing but if that's your thing, more power to you. When we come for dinner, we always get a beer and we have not had one bad beer here. There is a variety of light to dark beers, tap and bottled, and always at least one local beer. They also serve sandwiches made with their own bread and rolls. I have never tried one but knowing how amazing the pizza crust is, I'd bet money that they are the bomb. They also offer a GF pizza, which I have tried, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you love cornmeal grittiness. It's pretty dry and crumbly. I have heard boasts that their regular flour is so \"clean\" that people with Gluten Sensitivity can eat it with no reactions. I can't provide references so don't quote me on that, though. The bathrooms are a little shady, you have to ask for a key and it's in another part of the building. So if you get easily freaked out by weird bathrooms, might want to go somewhere else before coming. I have heard rumors that they will open a bakery this year and I CANNOT WAIT."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/messenger-pizza-nampa?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
