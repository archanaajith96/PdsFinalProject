Ever. Most recently, the hit of the dinner was the enormous $12.00 fried fish sandwich and the smoked muscle toast.  The muscle toast was pricey for the size, $13.00 for one piece, but damn it was good.  The lobster roll was on point, the best in town.I just love Eventide.  It continues to be, after all these years, the best restaurant in the area for a nice meal, NOT on a budget.Pro tips from the local: 1.  Get on the waitlist and then go across the street to Tomaso's Canteen for a beer and a shot, maybe even a taco.2.  Try to go either late night or early before the dinner rush.3.  Get a lobster roll.  Every time.4.  Don't be afraid to wait for outdoor seating on a nice night.5.  Park off India street and walk over."}, {"review_id": "aPdUZKATOF2ogb-aLmSXIw", "user_id": "lhSB440bIdPGPnHO2YaXfA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "We went on a Saturday night, around 6pm, and the wait was 2 hours.So we picked the standing spots. You would not want to stay long for a fancy dinner when you are standing right next to the bathroom, that was why we just went straight to the point, oysters and clams.Got half dozen oysters ( $16 ) and 6 Little Neck Clam ( $9 )2 Pemaquid, 2 Norumberga , 2 Otter Cover, all from Damariscotta.Basically tried almost all of the sauce, red wine mignonette, pickled red onion ice, tabasco ice, lemon black pepper ice.The ice idea is amazing, would go for only pickled red onion ice probably next time. The oysters themselves were refreshing, creamy and meaty ! Really love them.The clams were not as good though.Eventide is good for what it is famous for but I was expecting a lower price if we are so close to the source of the supply. Not sure how the market works in that sense. Will definitely try the one in Fenway next time."}, {"review_id": "b_vE6eczEt4oBLZhHU4oIw", "user_id": "HqMWEEsYIXoFhdDIX1NtrA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I feel like people want to hate on Eventide because it's chef-y and non traditional but that doesn't mean it's bad or not worth any hype. Some things are more expensive but some things are reasonable - like the lobster roll. Came here 10 minutes before opening Sunday at 11am. My husband and I were seated right at the bar and didn't have to wait. But by the time we left, it was packed (inside and out) so I suggest coming early. They don't take reservations. For lunch we shared - A large French press. Effective, tasty and fancy but expensive for being $12 and no to go cups so you can finish what you paid for. The famed brown butter lobster roll in a Chinese balloon bun. Is it better in a traditional toasted hot dog bun? Yes. Was this bad? Not at all. The bao soaked up the butter well, and the lobster meat was flavorful succulent and for sure buttery. The fried oysters - the oysters themselves were a bit small but it was well fried, and came with a yum Korean spice sauce, and pickles. A delicious fried fish sandwich. Well fried, good pickles, not too heavy, some kind of very fresh white flaky fish was used. The incentive clam chowder which has real seafood meat in it. More broth than thick cream which I liked. There was also a strong nori flavor which was interesting. Got a half dozen of local Maine oysters on the shell. I don't remember the exact names but they weren't from far away (West Bath, Darinscotta etc).  I had the server select for me and one paid was clean tasting, going upon in oceanic flavor. But nothing as briny as what we have in NY-CT. Service was quick, a bit all business but that was fine for us. Some of the brunch items looked really good like the everything bagel crossaint with stuffed whitefish filling. They have brunch items in addition to lunch  and plenty of craft cocktails. I'm glad we came. $80 ish for lunch though FYI."}, {"review_id": "n_wu0TNlANRuBOWy2TkMGA", "user_id": "pJ5aZ4CWj5Tqex8WA6xQ_A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "If you plan in coming to this place, the you should expect a wait time since both times we came has been very busy. The food was great, all the raw seafood was delicious and so so fresh. It just slide into my belly! I felt so full afterwards but it definitely wasnt a heavy meal to where I want to pass out afterwards. Our server (she did t give us her name) was quirky and informative of all the questions we were asking. She was even putting up with my husband, who was clearly drunk, and talking way too much. I ignored him and ate since I wasnt going to wait and share with him of all he wanted was to talk to other people there. Everything was decently priced and portions were worth it. I do wish this place was bigger though, it's such a great place to eat out at but it is on the smaller side. Our first wait time was estimated at an hour (saturday night) and then the second wait time was half an hour. I suppose if you do go, go on a weekday instead of a weekend. Another thing was the parking issue, we drove around looking for street parking and it seemed like forever. Over all I'd definitely go here and again and I do recommend this place to other who aren't afraid of ingesting raw seafood."}, {"review_id": "1EBSKyXi7CSwCtOmprpe3A", "user_id": "bVRwy8knBJkhBiSlffFzXA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Amazing. Absolutely a must have if you're in Portland, ME. I came here with my sister on a whim since we were looking for restaurants nearby and noticed that this place had 2k+ reviews with 4.5 stars!!We ordered Oysters on the Half Shell, New England Clam Chowder, and the showstopper, the New England Clam Bake. The Clam Chowder was delicious - definitely not your typical clam chowder that's super creamy, but it was much lighter with tons of flavor. The New England Clam Bake is a 'must-have' if you want your fill of seafood - it comes with steamers, mussels, lobster, potatoes, pork belly, and an egg. For two people, we were absolutely stuffed after eating this hearty meal. Service was super attentive and the food was delicious. I'd come back here every weekend if I lived in the area!"}, {"review_id": "Gf_Dgb-AK2gAfAUiDL8YUA", "user_id": "u7tbCCWV8g9IaOG3uORnyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Definitely one of the best tasting meals we had on our vacation.  Eventide does high end seafood right with good service, nice presentation and excellent quality.  We were visiting Portland ME for the day and Yelped up this great restaurant. Being in the mood for some raw oysters we order a dozen oysters to start that came served on ice with a large serving of their black pepper ice and cocktail sauce.  They were excellent with the pepper ice being a great garnish for the oysters.   We could not resist sharing a brown butter lobster roll a house special (and the best lobster roll we had on our trip). We then had the steamed seafood combo which consisted of a half of a lobster, a dozen and a half mussels and the same quantity of steamers.  Our waiter was really great at helping us order and giving us tips on how best to eat the food we ordered.  I was a great meal and the only suggestion I would have to improve the experience is for the restaurant to consider serving a complimentary cracker or artisan bread when ordering with maybe a small seafood dip or olive oil. This would be a great starter while ordering and ensure customers do not go away feeling hungry as a number of reviewers have commented on and be done at little cost. Food - 5 - Great presentation and quality. Atmosphere 4.5  - Clean nautical feel with varieties of  oysters displayed on trays in front of the bar.  Service-5 - Very informative and help with customers want to try new seafoods and how to Best enjoy them!Price - 4  - They are expensive, the quality is top notch but portions are small. See note on starter above, which would put them a notch higher.

Oysters are fresh and delicious, and the staff are super knowledgeable when it comes to ordering them. The lobster roll, while VERY flavorful and unique, is small. And I wish the lobster were in bigger chunks instead of chopped up. But it really is a must-try. I really liked the nori dressing on the salad too, and our oyster shooters. Those were the highlights. Tourist trap? Yes, definitely.

My friends and I never really understood the hype behind lobster rolls before since we're from Philly but oh my god, Eventide's lobster rolls literally taste like heaven. It was so soft and buttery and the buns were perfect. It was so good we ate here twice during our 2 day stay in Maine. Luckily we didn't have to wait long for both visits but lines tend to be very long on a regular basis. We also tried the clam bake (these sell out fast), oysters, and clam chowder. All were delicious - we loved the clam bake and basket island oysters. If we ever go back to Maine it would be for Eventide."}, {"review_id": "AzQorekzGTTStmD_4TsaiA", "user_id": "ZZeqTlp6L8liPtArB0W--g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Eventide lived up to all the hype I had heard and read about it. We stopped in mid-afternoon about two and a half hours before our dinner reservation and decided to have a very light late lunch. Our server was attentive and helpful. I asked her if she could pick a couple of the best local oysters, and they were delicious! They were so fresh, and the accouterments complemented them well. I chose the house made cocktail sauce and the kimchi ice. I had never heard of or had kimchi ice with my oysters, but they gave them a refreshing kick. My boyfriend had their famous brown butter lobster roll, and MY GOD was it delicious. The only downside? The size to price ratio. Everything else about it was so SO good. The lobster was sweet, and the brown butter made it even better. The roll was so soft and doughy in the best way possible. Almost like a bao bun! Also, while we were waiting for our seats, a server walked by us with an ice cream sandwich...if it's on the menu, get it when you go! It was the perfect way to end our meal at Eventide. We will absolutely be back the next time we're in Portland!"}, {"review_id": "NrKsuUUJ1-OHo1Lg3ttF5w", "user_id": "PeIFSmI0I1ILYjUjjUSZdA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "I really wanted to love this place. Especially because the reviews are out of this world and it was my first meal in Portland. We came around 8pm and still had to wait for a table- no big deal. The service was good but i felt like the food was WAY overpriced for what you get. We shared the homemade chips, which were good and I liked the dipping sauce. We shared the crab bun, which was literally 4 bites. It was tiny, came with no sides and was 12 dollars. We also shared the Casco Bat Pollock. I thought the pollock was over Fried.

Very small. But filling all the same and decadent, drenched in brown butter. But yeah... for 15 bucks... I want it to seem like it's been prepared.

It's a Brown Butter Lobster Roll that half the size of a classic roll for way more money. What a huge disappointment these were. The lobster was to warm and the bun was all wrong.

We are particular about our \"Chowdah\" and our \"lobsta rolls\" so when I came to visit Maine, I had to stop in here for some. It was nice walking in and seeing fresh seafood sitting on ice right there at the bar, front and center. The seating options are small because the place isn't big but we didn't mind sitting at the bar area with views outside to people watch. We started with the homemade chips, which were good. We got the New England clam chowder that had really generous portions of clams. Then came the lobster roll with the brown butter sauce. It was delicious! My disappointment was that it was small, yes, they have generous portions of lobster in it, but it was still VERY small for what you're paying for. The fish sandwich was really good, perfectly cooked and crispy. The place is pricey, but it's seafood so it's to be expected. However, service is a little lacking and the ratio of price to portion of food isn't great, which is why it lost a star."}, {"review_id": "86FBviUHZQXHjyjG_CsJRg", "user_id": "-rDHIgi5Ic3kNTEeqQxi6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Came here recommended by friends to check out the oysters.

The lobster roll is the best I have ever had. The steamed bun is incredible and gives you the perfect bread to lobster ratio in every bite. Not only is the lobster roll amazing, but everything else I tried did not let me down. Oyster crudo, brussel sprouts, fresh oysters to name a few. You can tell this restaurant takes pride in the fresh, melt in your mouth food they create. Visiting from Phoenix, I wanted fresh seafood and a lobster roll while in Maine. We found this place on Google and gave it a try. The Asian influence found throughout their food is inspiring and makes you wonder what the daily specials will be the next day, as they always change.

I wouldn't call it an asian spin so much as a contemporary take. The lobster roll is SO good, easily the top thing, as are the oysters (duh....think lots of accoutrements). The chicken sandwich is delicious and one of the larger items on the menu so if you're really hungry that's a great option.The only downfall is that the plates are all on the smaller side- which is fine- and everything is priced for the Portland tourist crowd, so don't come here if you're starving and trying to be frugal. Even if you get a app and a lobster roll, you'll probably leave with plenty of room for gelato.One thing I haven't seen on the menu in a while that was SO good was the chickpea fries....yum! Lots of great seafood focused specials, so don't overlook the specials board.
