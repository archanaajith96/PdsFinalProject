Pho bowl was tiny size compare to what i usally get but it got me full. Broth needed alittle more kick to it when it first came out. I ordered the pho dac biet and a boba drink which i think they defrost the boba in microwave making it taste like wierd. Not complete condiments had to ask for some chilli oil and sugar! Ice coffee was alittle sour too. But overall for the area i guess it worked out for a bowl of pho."}, {"review_id": "_pgzE8P5v8KMZHKDOFJ_WQ", "user_id": "nYbS84e5i3OMEB4Z5Q4lsQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "Had a delicious lunch today, shrimp spring rolls and the shrimp pho noodle bowl.

Pho Vinh Long not only features great food (try the spring rolls and the #16 pho. It's to die for!) But the people who work there are equally as amazing. They've always been attentive and kind, almost like you're being treated like family.

This is the second family to run this restaurant in the past 8 years and they completely understand their product and their market. We eat there regularly. The pho is consistent and delicious. I often see people, whom I think are first-timers, come in and order some of the Chinese dishes on the menu and I'm sad for them. Although those dishes are competent, this is a pho shop. Go there and eat the pho. If you don't know or understand pho, and yet you are internet savvy enough to read a Yelp review, then go to YouTube and see some videos on how to eat pho, then go eat delicious pho!There is only one other place to get pho in town (and only on Sundays), and they are different and both delicious, so please eat some delicious soup when you are in South Charleston!"}, {"review_id": "1XVJlofBODuyZhl_xRpJIA", "user_id": "Tl-06XRb853CKgKJ71XoMA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/4/2017", "text": "I really liked this place the previous times I was here, but I think this visit was probably the last. As soon as I walked in, I noticed a very unpleasant smell. Like dirty diapers or something. I ignored it to the best of my ability, but it really threw off my appetite. I ordered a bowl of pho that was supposed to have different forms of beef in it, but all I found was the brisket. Not a big deal, but it was a little bit disappointing. Then when I tried to order a boba smoothie, the waiter laughed at me and said \"We don't have that.\" It's on the menu, but okay... I'm giving three stars because the pho was decent. I'll probably go to the Vietnamese sandwich place across the street next time, though."}, {"review_id": "zeoDkRPSzAn2EDE1h-orrQ", "user_id": "HGhJWtc_dTjkUi-tYtSVlw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/20/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Loved it!  Chicken with Lemongrass was spicy, but not crazy spicy.  Wife ordered Shrimp Fried Rice.  Will come back."}, {"review_id": "YkbtojGYdLG2yBafaCZyUw", "user_id": "cYJSerVWEs3MLaTsC0unFA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/20/2017", "text": "This is some of the best Pho I've ever had.

The food is always amazing, as is the service. This is my go to restaurant when I feel down. I can always count on this place to bring my spirits up. The pho is so good, I seriously cannot get enough. I get it at least once a week. If you're a young adult like I am and you have the worst hangover, let me tell you, pho is the cure. I am so happy I found this place living in such a culturally increasing city. I definitely recommend anyone to go here. The prices are reasonable and they will treat you like family.
