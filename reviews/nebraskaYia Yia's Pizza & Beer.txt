The pizza is good. Thin crust, the right amount of sauce, but in my opinion the crust was too tough. Difficult to get a knife through. I ordered by the slice.I got a side salad. It was very small and came with cranberries and red onions. This is something I wish I knew before I ordered ranch dressing. The pizza is also served with a giant chunk of bread...for some reason. Not necessary and if you don't like wasting bread, you should ask to not have it included. I'd come back, but try other things. The staff is great, very friendly."}, {"review_id": "WSH7wsvHvNgvyjocbZpEZw", "user_id": "OmWAEefrFJzpHwtYT-AeLQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/17/2017", "text": "We've heard of this place, but have never stopped by until now. We were the oldest couple in the place. Pretty trendy, but that's fine. We just went to try the pizza. Ordering is at the bar. They have a full menu of pizza and beer. Wine is available, but your options depend on what bottle is open already. We stuck with beer this time as that menu is extreme. There is outside seating available, but it has plenty of seating inside. We had the meat pizza. Thin crust, good sauce, plus plenty of toppings. If you're downtown and hungry for pizza, stop by. It's worth it."}, {"review_id": "SgJeR8nBCvkuSBo-aqVi7w", "user_id": "HLbdgd4K6OU4F755FEw7Pw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Definitely a hidden gem, this place is awesome.

We needed a place close to the Nebraska History Museum and this came highly recommended. Three people shared a large Equator (cheese pizza). Lunch for three for $19.90. The crust was thin and that was right for us. The sauce was not sweet. Perfect. The cheese was the perfect amount for the size of pizza. We will return and recommend this pizza place  to others.I forgot to mention the bread that comes with your meal.  It's good too.

First off, the environment is unlike most restaurants and that OK with me. The staff are always pleasant and helpful. And the food is very good.

Since I am not from the area, I thought Yelping to find a decent pizza place would be a good idea. I came across Yia Yia's and what peaked my attention was the photo that came up. (props to whomever took that! It looks delicious) Went in and saw that they have a \"Quick meal\" type of deal where you grab a slice and you are out the door in less than 5 minutes....Seriously...I was skeptical at first but ordered my pizza and BAM! It was out in about 5. They also said that they change the quick slice daily, so if you are hankering for a slice daily then this is the place to go to for a quick bite. I really did like the idea that they have this because when you are a workaholic like I am and DETEST searching for coins to feed the meter, this is a great way to get in and out all for a dime to the meter! Now to the pizza...Thin crust...how I LOVE thee. The pesto chicken pizza slice was a warm welcome.  It had flavor and is a good sized slice (if you are extra hungry grab two slices) but this plus the salad was sufficient for lunch. For sure coming back and possibly NOT just for a quick bite but for an actual sit down."}, {"review_id": "JNdBmEnezI1lJirK_UHLtQ", "user_id": "ZntQFu085ebYWAZWULpPQg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "7/23/2015", "text": "I did not think that the food in this place lived up to the hype. I ordered a 12 inch pie (make your own) with cheese and pepperoni since I wanted something a bit more basic (I've been fine dining for most of the week). Mistake. The pizza was so bland. I also ordered the garlic bread and it was just OK absolutely nothing special and wouldn't order again. The atmosphere is decent. The guy announcing when your order was ready was a hoot. Bathrooms had cool decor with different types of beer cartons stapled to the walls. I would give it another try and get one of the \"world\" slices, but the make your own option was a definite disappointment."}, {"review_id": "dRvMHmq1Y4xqjeEsQLgwHA", "user_id": "mRsL_RuE9HaU8iayFcqJBw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/27/2016", "text": "What a fun restaurant/bar.

Alas, I must confess, I am not impressed. Tonight's slice consisting of pesto, mozzarella, onion, pineapple, & jalapeño was tasteless. You ask, \"How could that combination possibly be tasteless?!\"  I don't know but the chili flakes helped. Oh god and to boot it .. was .. dry...  so so very dry. I saw the pesto green color but got none of the tasty, juicy benefits. Cardboardy and bland. On to the Caesar. I'm not a person needing much dressing on a salad but again DRY. And not a nice crunchy romaine, but that impossible to fork greens mix. Lastly. What is with the giant slice of bread which accompanies?! What the **** would anyone need nor want a chunky piece of plain bread next to their slice of pizza? Saving grace? Beer selection!

I worked at a downtown restaurant, and on football Saturdays, after the game, we would always go to Yia Yia's for a slice and a beer. Or two or three... It was a place of peace for us... great beers, good pizza, amazing breads, red pesto, and interesting toppings for meat eaters and vegetarians alike.
