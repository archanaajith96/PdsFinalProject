A friend took me and my boyfriend here for a meetup, and we've gone back to Toros since. One of the things about Turkish cuisine is that it's known for its meat-based dishes. However, it's possible to eat vegetarian and you can do this at Toros. Â What we did was order a bunch of appetizers, bowls of Ezogelin (red lentil soup) for each person, and we rounded off the meal with some Turkish Coffee. Below are the apps that we order usually - - Coban Salata (Sheperd Salad) - ask for Feta- Babagannush- Lebni- Hummus- Patlican Soslu (Eggplant Sauce)- Acili Ezme (Spicy Vegetable Salad)- Yalanci Dolma (Stuffed Grape Leaves)- Ispanakli Borek (Spinach Pie)You'll be in store for an amazing meal in an intimate and welcoming atmosphere at Toros. Highly recommended!"}, {"review_id": "k7Bob9mbjYBEwCCbb9ubXQ", "user_id": "ZRFzuTwpYlrqNBK1rbjDAA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/15/2017", "text": "This Tukish restaurant is a hit and miss with some items. They have great service but the food isn't that amazing. My husband ordered the chicken in yogurt and the yogurt was overpowering the dish way too much. I ordered the lamb gyro plate which was also okay just the regular doner you could get anywhere. The main dishes are too overpriced for the portion sizes they give you. The bread came out burnt. The waiter took my husband's plate away even though he was still eating. Service was good overall they apologized and brought the plate back."}, {"review_id": "x7wnvqW9ydIm2QrFiRnnlA", "user_id": "y3G4nVgvCBv_OlLLMyrsfA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/5/2017", "text": "This place was real yummy. Came here with a friend abruptly and we're seated immediately. I let my Turkish friend do all the ordering as I'll pretty much eat anything you put in front of me. All the food was hot and came out fast. A lot of flavor to every dish. The Hummus was especially good."}, {"review_id": "RY0DeTiGsk4-ACf8wLcB1Q", "user_id": "35rySIxtTAXBU-0MUpeCng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/29/2017", "text": "The food was delicious and the service was excellent. We had the mixed platter and loved everything that comes with it. We just felt the lamb shish was maybe undercooked, but honestly this was the first time we ever had shish so not sure if that's how it's made. They severed bread and salad as a complement. The bread was very fresh and soft. It was our first time and we will surely come again to try other varieties."}, {"review_id": "BSHw0W4DReKQ1aUhg3U4Ag", "user_id": "5GcUL8YbqoJB9CSpuO8cQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/16/2017", "text": "Always outstanding food.

I do have a complain about this location, first of all, I was received in the restaurant by an arrogant and unwelcoming waitress. The first thing that came out of her mouth was: \" Do you have a reservation ?!\" , we replied no , so she proceeded to say we would have to share with people or we would have to get a table sitting next to each other.

I ordered Chicken Kabob and the Shepard's Salad. My God - so simple, yet so delicious. The service was great. Our waitress was kind and attentive. The noise level was quiet and it was a casual ambiance. It appeared to be a family business, and the patrons looked like regulars. Definitely a homey-style restaurant I would like to visit again.

But the quality of food and service has gone down consistently . Some of the waitresses are so nice , while others are just straight up rude and try to rush out . I have been getting the Turkish breakfast for many years . It has had small changes through the course of time but the contents have generally stayed the same . The only major change has been the price , it went from a five dollar breakfast to a nine dollar breakfast which is perfectly fine if there were some substantial changes or an upgrade in the quality of the food but there is none, same plate for four more dollars. I still get it every now and then when I'm opting for a healthier breakfast but I gotta say I'm more disappointed than pleased , especially this morning . I ordered spinach borek and a breakfast . I asked for no salami but instead another piece of feta . Once I get back to my office to eat I noticed that they gave me an tiny extra piece of feta, and charged me $4.00 for it making my breakfast a total of $13.00 and some change . Money is never an issue with food , but I am no dummy I know what food costs . I also got the spinach borek which was borderline un-edible , since the bottom was burnt to a crisp . I think I'll stick with the hazel st Toros. They are a lot nicer and the food is always good."}, {"review_id": "MHZeqa78oTfDLjyAp86sZw", "user_id": "qx3pNF4j47ipyxcMnU7HIA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2017", "text": "Ordered a pick up.

The quality used to be better but has been on a decline. This is one of the oldest Turkish restaurants in the area. I think that is why it has been popular. The food is served in decent portions. Most dishes are bland. The soup and salad are lacking seasoning. Kebabs are not marinated well. Presentation of the dishes are nothing notable compared to some better restaurants in the area. The prices are reasonable but still not worth the visit. The food looks better than it actually tastes."}, {"review_id": "hGe668G3XJcIma4Os0OwpA", "user_id": "tKKxJ5Lkow8BtMpG6VXsxQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "8/14/2017", "text": "I was really excited to come to toros since I had heard so much about it from friends but was utterly disappointed today when I ate there.

I fell in love with this place. The home-cooked style buffet reminds me of home. The service was great, I remember seeing an lady behind the counter in the kitchen cooking, she reminded me of my grandmother, she had such a welcoming smile on her face, I still remember that after all these years. I haven't seen her in a while but unfortunately I haven't been back here in a while. The space, decor, and lighting is very warm and inviting. I will come back here and I recommend this location to everyone. The one on Hazel sucks so come to Paterson.
