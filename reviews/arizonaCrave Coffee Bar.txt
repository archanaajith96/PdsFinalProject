No, but really. My boyfriend was shocked when we entered that there were actually lots of people inside \"because it feels like we are out in the boonies.\" LOL.We wanted to do the drive-through, but unfortunately, it was really unclear if you order at the menu board (we couldn't find a mic..) or drive straight to the window to order. It was confusing, so we just parked and went inside.The decor is really cute. If I went to college near here, I'd love to just hang out here - everything seems really clean and tidy. And decorated. The place wasn't loud, but it wasn't silent. A comfortable volume for getting work done.I ordered a skinny chocolate biscotti frap, and let me tell you, I destroyed it in seconds. It was actually REALLY good.I was drawn here originally because their menu offered a lot of \"skinny\" and low-calorie options, which was really nice! I'd love to go to places like Dutch Brothers more often, but since their beverages are more like full-on desserts as opposed to COFFEE, I never do.But Crave seems like a great answer to that problem. They have fun drinks that can still be made \"skinny\" (I haaaate that term).They also have some pastries on display, but I didn't get the chance to try any. They looked really good though!5 stars, but I do wish they were more clear about how to order from the drive-through... It just confused me a lot."}, {"review_id": "zBxBAB9ioJd7EyGxDBIeYw", "user_id": "DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "If you are craving coffee Crave Coffee Bar would be a great place to get your caffeine fix. The interior is sleek, modern, and spacious. I came here for one reason. They had a drink called a marocchino which I had never tried before. It's a lovely layered concoction of espresso, frothy milk, with your choice of caramel or chocolate. I went with the traditional chocolate. The drink is served hot, in a small glass. It was a beautiful presentation and the frothy milk helped balance out the strong espresso. The chocolate added some depth and sweetness to round out the drink.The pastry selections looked too good to pass up so I also had a plum crosta. The pastry was light, flaky, and I liked the balance of tart with sweet flavor in the plum filling.Service was friendly enough, and the drink was made in just a few short minutes."}, {"review_id": "wRYao6s3Wq5k1ujIJehtdQ", "user_id": "lVoP7VFNKCIyW59cuouPPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "Im here for work. But since back home, I looked up coffee places around me and Crave Coffee bar was bookmarked as a place for me to go to. Once I got there, the menu was on the wall, and there is one breakfast sandwich... and it is so freaking good. I ordered the way it was shown on the wall, and I said \"give me the way it's supposed to be. And I want coffee\" They serve Turkish coffee, but you cannot take it to go. Só I ordered a latte, and it is so good. I'll definitely be back for the Turkish coffee though."}, {"review_id": "Jh7ZSRRdFkgPOYJNy6xInQ", "user_id": "2HA_Ub0s2qACtlOkrTe1DQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "One of my go to places to study in Tucson.  It is super spacious with several different seatimg arrangements and lots of nooks and crannies to hide in.  The seats can be a little hard if you sit a long time :PBesides the ambience,  the drinks and food are great and the service is always super friendly and welcoming. They serve sandwiches, pastries, and fresh made crepes! I really liked the goat cheese spinach crepe, although wish the filling was warm. I haven't had the coffee but the chai and tea selection is pretty good.

Parking is super easy and there are spots available right in front of the building. Entering Crave, you'll notice how open and large this coffee bar is. I noticed they had a lot of different drink options and I ended up ordering off of their \"takes a little longer\" menu. I got the nitro cold brew and it was served almost immediately! I think this place is a great meeting space and has lots of room to sit. Unfortunately, I wouldn't return here to study as it is just too loud. I had headphones in and couldn't hear my sound due to the noise around me. I was impressed with my cold brew and will return to try some of their other drinks."}, {"review_id": "qJ6j6Gb-0lda7YZ8uGYETA", "user_id": "aU9Onn8eHwUcz-d-Tj0Qtg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Super awesome place! I've always driven by this place but I've never gone in until today. The inside is really spacious, quiet, and comfortable. There were a lot of people in there studying/working but it was still quiet and there was a lot of room to sit. I had the hot chocolate and tiramisu which was delicious. I haven't had tiramisu in awhile but this was definitely really good. This place also serves affogatos and not very many places in Tucson do this. I didn't have the affogato but I'll definitely be returning to try it. The services is really fast and there isn't an overwhelming smell of coffee there either like some coffee shops. I'll definitely be going back."}, {"review_id": "qL4w7FQTWoj8akvE5dz8qg", "user_id": "y_v2Z7w0cF-8Idtb5BnakQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/14/2017", "text": "I am a big fan of Crave Coffee Bar, especially after their remodel.I frequent this establishment for their coffee, friendly service, and delicious food options. There is a lot of seating offered, especially if you're lucky enough to get the spots with the large tables in the back by the TV. It's a great place to study at or to meet up with friends and family to chat over some good coffee.Be sure to look online for what their hours are because they close early than their other weekdays on Mondays. They also have a drive-thru, so if you're crunched on time or don't feel like stopping in, that's an option for you, too. If you're spending a long time there, they also have board games in the back you can borrow to play with your friends and several spots have a good amount of outlets. If you're prone to getting chilly, I highly recommend bringing a light jacket or sweater. They keep the place a little colder than other coffee shops I've been to.As for their coffee and food, you can't go wrong with anything off their menu. They have the classic coffee menu, with some nice added iced and blended drink combinations. They offer non-fat, soy, sugar-free, etc. If you're in the mood for some food, they sell homemade desserts and pastries. They also recently started making crepes, both savory and sweet. There's something for everyone!"}, {"review_id": "1Bfyn17OUjMTTe9AFTFONQ", "user_id": "NQ3Fy0YenkhF7THMq1_Ccg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "My new favorite coffee shop. They have lots of coffee options from regular brews to teas to frappes. I got a hot caramel macchiato and it was amazing. I also got a chocolate chip muffin and it was pretty good. The drinks and food are reasonably priced. I love the atmosphere there too. It's the most studious coffee shop atmosphere I've ever been in. There is lots of room and many tables for studying and relaxing.

I loved my green tea latte and our Snickers pie and cheesecake were pretty good and we concentrated until close. I love the decor and the open, chill vibe.

While traveling I always try to find local small business cafes with quality coffee, and quick (vegetarian friendly) breakfast on the go. This place provides all of the above, and was also adorable and had lots of room to sit. They even had succulents hanging on the wall; how adorable is that? I had the breakfast sandwich minus the turkey. It was fresh, healthy, well seasoned, and the perfect amount of food. They even served it with grapes and fresh peanuts. I also had an almond milk latte, which was AMAZING. I had to stop myself from chugging it, so that I could enjoy it longer.

Anything one could ask for when planning a long day studying.  Food: -black and white mocha: pretty noms-chocolate cake: HOLY MOLY it was sooo good. Dark and decadant. Mmmm Mmmm baby-tiramisu: bombdiggity as wellWhy did I subtract one star? The mocha tasted a little watered down when I was there (although the flavor was still there).

One of my favorite things to do back home is it try different locally-owned coffee and tea shops.  I knew I was visiting Tucson and that I would have to try Crave. Unfortunately, my hopes were too high. What drew me to this particular Cafe, were the stunning Yelp reviews and the pictures of their delicious caramel macchiato! So obviously I had to order the caramel macchiato.... so dissappointing...mine was very average, very bland.... for once in my life I can say that I would have preferred the  Starbucks version! Nothing about the cafe really inspired me to want to go back. I can say the Wi-Fi is very fast and thete is a very warm and homie down-to-earth vibe about it, which is nice. If you just want a plain cup of coffee and a nice place to do your work or just relax with friends.
