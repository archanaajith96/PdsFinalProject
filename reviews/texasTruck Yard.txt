It's also good to note that the Truck Yard is very family and kid friendly, as every time I have came to visit there are always a few families about. Almost the whole bar is outside so there are dogs aplenty. On the weekends they usually have a band playing live music. The bar is definitely most well known for their mix drinks which are on tap. Yes, you heard me. The drinks are pre-mixed and are poured from a tap. I have dabbled in quite a few of their mix drink options but my favorite still remains the Peachy Keen. Beware, 2-3 of these drinks and you won't be feeling sober. The alcohol is quite generous. All in all, this is a great place to go whether you are with friends, family, a date etc.."}, {"review_id": "XBhTtzQi8ZiqK0I6vpqclw", "user_id": "he6777_VweHntxuVu9SR7w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "It gets very busy on nice days on the weekend. Valet is complementary. This is a dog friendly place that has inside and outside seating areas. For food there is a taco truck and a cheesesteak place. I didn't try anything to eat but the cheesesteak looked really good. It took about 15 minutes to get a drink. We then headed outside where the live music was. If you come with a large group get there early to get a table. If it rained the night before the ground will be muddy. Kids are allowed in till a certain time 9pm I believe. I wouldn't recommend bringing a child there due to how crowded it gets and there is nothing for them to do. This is a great place for live music, day drinking,  and siting outside in the sun."}, {"review_id": "EwnqSJOck258jllUuOozuw", "user_id": "ayAi8t0aoYqlb_XbFtTrkA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "First time here and it was so cool! I love how it's opened for everyone to mingle, and food trucks come out for a variety of foods! I choose a cheesesteak from inside the bar area it was super flavorful I tried the steak mushroom and cheese whiz with some jalapeño chips!

It's basically a backyard bar and different food trucks come there every day. Thus, you never know what kind of food you will get! But, that's fun. The food trucks I've been to have been great. The bartenders are super nice. There is a stage for a band and it's a super chill, fun atmosphere. Come after work in your work clothes, or go home and put on some relax clothes- it doesn't matter. The age group seems to be 30s and 40s here. Dogs are encouraged to come!

The vibe is super chill and the drinks are cheap and strong (try the trash can punch). Love hanging out here with friends or loved ones and just chilling. Very unassuming and laid back atmosphere. The food trucks are great (Not Just Q's chicken and brisket are bomb- the brisket was so tender it kept falling apart as I tried to pick it up). Also, their cheesesteaks. Hot damn, this was a good sandwich. Got the monster size with cheese wiz and all the veggies. Craving another right now.

I want to copy & paste to Virginia. Such good vibes. Good ole' country music playing and unique sitting area. Very dog friendly! Don't come if you don't like dogs.

Perfect place to hang out and kick it with your friends! I ordered the old fashioned in a bottle and I didn't like it - the taste was off. On top of that, it was $10. For my next drink, I tried some kind of porter/stout in a can (I forgot the name) but didn't like that either and couldn't even finish all of it. Maybe I just didn't order the right drinks.

We ordered the Philly cheesesteak w/ provolone and it was one of the best I've had. The steak was cooked really well and the ranch tasted just like jalapeño ranch which was delicious. Every cheesesteak comes with free chips so make sure you grab some (flavors include jalapeño, bbq, salt& vinegar). We also ordered drinks and they were made really well. I ordered an Amaretto sour & a mojito and it came out to around $12 which is relatively cheaper than most places around the area. Lastly, I love the vibe of the area. It's a great place to hang out with family or friends and it's pet friendly as well!

Creatively designed with unique seating. The food variety is ever changing since the food trucks come to this location. However, the cheesesteaks stays local and is worth coming to get that on its own. It is nice to go when you didn't take the time to see what trucks are there as they post it onlIne when you know if all else fails the cheesesteak is a winner. The place stays busy on weekend nights. So be prepared to hunt for a seat. The house margaritas are strong for a house margarita because often they are the weaker drinks especially when pre-made.  One of the bar tender has a blah personality but we won't let his personality issues damper the night nor hold it against the review rating (but still worth mentioning).
