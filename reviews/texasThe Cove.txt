Went this past Sunday evening and it was perfect weather to sit outside amd enjoy the live music going on inside the bar area. My fiance always gets the shrimp tacos. I've tried the refried bean burger which is really good. But I also enjoy their bean and cheese nachos. I'm a cheese lover and they don't hold back on the cheese.   It comes with a crema and jalapenos. Mmm! And they always top off each plate with a heart shaped chip. I was sad to learn they don't have Mexican coke on fountain anymore. If you love beer, they have tons to choose from."}, {"review_id": "L6jOPgEbisRi6KSWfc8Y0A", "user_id": "j-AUw0mDgmbJGP2IKoXBVg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "The cove is such a great place to hangout that I knew I had to come here on such a nice day. It was beautiful outside and the live music was everything I needed to make the day even more beautiful! For some reason, I thought burgers came with fries, so what you see pictured below is only the burger. I ordered the Texas burger. It was topped with refried beans, tortilla chips, and salsa. I loved the mixture of these three toppings. The refried beans added to the already-savory burger, the tortilla chips added a necessary crunch, and the salsa added just the right amount of spice. I wished the burger had a little more char and a little more flavor. The patty wasn't as juicy as I would have liked and I wished it was seasoned better. I enjoyed that the cove was grass-fed and organic, the atmosphere was chill and relaxed, and the food was delicious."}, {"review_id": "iXC-68Mhzm_Wm_UVw479Dw", "user_id": "xlIXjy0uWzzSVdKYCmLJUA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Fun, casual, and friendly atmosphere. Great beer selection at their bar, which is separate from the restaurant. I like their concept of focusing on high quality, healthy ingredients.The food was average at best. I had the \"'09 Burger\". The patty was basically room temperature, which explains how the food came out so fast. And the patty seemed to have little or no seasoning.I also ordered the zucchini special side item available. Was very tasty. But like the burger came out room temperature. Also, it was only served with a fork but was big chunks that needed slicing up."}, {"review_id": "C6JyS0M_kXzemBRORGbwAw", "user_id": "E1kvyo0e6LXX7NxHnp1Mjg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Very cozy spot in the San ! They have live performances, I believe every week, and are also equipped to cater to vegan, non vegans, and animals lol jk but they probably do. I honestly enjoyed my visit at The Cove. The jazz music and organic wine was sublime. The food was good and the employees are kind as well! I wish I captured the brand of the wine, it was good! I give a well deserved four stars due to food, ambience, and hospitality. The downside would be appeal. It's not a complete turn off, but it is located next to their own (I believe) car wash. It had a dark and out of place look next to the Cove which has its own lively inside and outside area. Just my opinion."}, {"review_id": "xOgPjobZ1kCoZRWTfc-MJg", "user_id": "hCJdF4CiahirC_U-GvzELg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "The Cove never fails me. I love the outdoor seating, the varied menu, delish drinks, live music, and friendly/ aware employees. Not only does this joint sell great burgers but also radiates positive energy which really adds love to the flavor of the food. If you're visiting San Antonio this is a place to come to with friends or family, and if you are a local then you need to make this a regular eatery!!"}, {"review_id": "b3f7tC0nfOBTRZWeFx1oEQ", "user_id": "AJDQpPfrrVwpTNGWVrGb9Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Great spot to catch some live music and some really tasty grub. I enjoy their nachos and their Captain Jack burger (tasty brisket) and even gluten free buns that do not taste like cardboard, thankfully.Often when I'm here it's jazz, but tonight it's a bit of a mix of different styles. The name of the group is The Gr8 band.Apparently the guitarist tonight wrote the Saved by the Bell intro...that takes me back. He also tap dances so yeah...a tap dancing guitar player...what a show!Indoor has such a great classic casual style and a great large outdoor area with bonfires and a play area for kiddos and fur babies."}, {"review_id": "4ikl4MGNuZQOAQpfHdZh2g", "user_id": "Trxse5nkXBQP4e_oVXX7UQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "We were excited to try out The Cove as lots of people had recommended it to us but I have to say I'm not sure what all the hype is about. Maybe we didn't go on the right day or order the right items but we found it to be just mediocre. Parents were in town and we thought we'd try it out since my mom is Gluten free. We ordered a variety of items including bacon cheddar burgers, Naked Burger without the bun and Bleu Cheese Bison Burger with a side of fries and hash. The food was good but it wasn't great.  There wasn't any music at the time we were there and it was too cold to sit outside...perhaps these two factors contributed to our \"just okay\" experience.Though I have to say that the line was out the door and probably a good 20+ people when we left so obviously they are doing something right...we just need to give them a chance to let us get the full experience next time.They do have a nice variety of options including vegetarian and gluten free items."}, {"review_id": "rcfUsQdTMAW1MM1W5oTrZw", "user_id": "IZJXnKA9CMiTy1RN489ihA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/13/2017", "text": "The cove was exactly what we were looking for! Hands down, the sweet potato fries were to die for! So good, i wasn't wild about the siracha mayo to dip, but i didn't think it needed it. I love the concept that all their products are locally grown! The burgers were great, and i actually did like that i had a vegetarian option. The ambiance was great! It was a bit cold when we went but they had heaters outside, we'd definitely go back and this is definitely a place we'd bring out of town guests to (especially ones with kids)."}, {"review_id": "PEeCYmyBmInto5M0XgXEEw", "user_id": "oRWjMH3MGa1ZErtbNfZ4pA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/5/2017", "text": "This is definitely one of the first places in San Antonio that stepped-up to raise the bar by offering fresh organic produce,grown right here in Texas.Not to mention The Cove has definitely got to win the \"all in one\"award as far as family eateries go. It consists of a restaurant,a washateria,bar,playground,car wash,dog wash and music venue with a tiny little dog park that is currently undergoing construction.I would definitely like to see anyone name a place that can beat that..Not happening...Seriously,the only thing it's missing is a convenience store attached.This place has everything.Burgers are very delicious.Tried several different burger varieties on the menu and they are all very good.The vegan bacon-cheeseburger has always been one of my favorites vegan patties in the city.Everything is local,grain fed beef,chicken etc.Lots of vegan options as well here and gluten-free.Fish tacos are always delicious.The nachos too.The sauces that come with the order are excellent too.Cilantro &  Pesto Aioli and Chipotle Mayo.The sweet potato fries and the traditional fries are both excellent.I recommend you try the Chipotle Mayo on them it's very good that way.I like it on the fish tacos as well..It can get packed here and the parking is decent but can get a little wild during peak hours.If your in a rush you may want to just call your order in.Bike racks are also available here to park.Just so you understand prior to arrival.You need to go inside to place your order,then you will get drink cups and be given a number.A employee will bring you your trays out but you should pick up your napkins etc inside by the Stubborn Soda unit that is directly to your left after paying for your food etc.Consider not using a straw.They cannot be recycled and they are already a ecological nuisance that harms sea turtles and other wildlife."}, {"review_id": "nzl7ENrSygEGAoxI9j1jhw", "user_id": "m_gAkI2spr3uw0SG9-RliA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I love the vibe at The Cove.

Paid $10 for a bacon cheese burger that didn't even come with fries. Ordered my daughter some bean and cheese nachos and told them no sourcream or jalapenos since they were for a kid. When the food runner brought them out they had everything I said I didnt want on them. Told the food runner and she said \"Well do you want me to take them back? It'll take a while and they're just going to pick the stuff off them anyways.\" I said \"no I want new ones without all the stuff I said in the first place\".Hummus was painfully dry. Fish tacos were horrible. When I opened up the foil and tried to lift the taco to take a bite, it fell apart and my dog ended up eating the fish. And the chips were a bit stale. I paid $58 total for our entire order and we left still hungry. To top ot all off the cashier gave me the wrong change. Shorted me a few dollars which I noticed after I was rushed to the side so she can continue taking orders. I tried to complain and they called me a liar. 1st and last visit.

Plenty of out door seating from picnic tables to patio tables. Indoor has family style long tables with chairs so people can watch the live music. They are child and dog friendly providing a dog park and jungle gym. The menu is provided burgers, nachos and fish tacos. They provide organic hamburgers. My disappointment is the prices it was 11 dollars for the naked burger which is a patty with sautéed spinach.

Unpopular opinion, I know. I've never been to The Cove but have always heard about it from co-workers and friends. When the opportunity to visit for a co-worker's going away party presented itself I willingly jumped at the occasion. When we arrived, we immediately went to the bar outside, in the back. Hey, it was happy hour so why not partake? My friend ordered a whiskey and coke and the bartender quickly informed us that The Cove doesn't serve hard liquor. Just wine and beer. I guess I understand that considering the parent to child ratio, you don't want moms and dads getting too turnt up. Not only could we not get liquor, we couldn't get \"regular\" beer - just Texas beer at that particular bar. We made our way inside. I liked the inside space and saw that a band was setting up. Unfortunately, we didn't stay long enough to order food. I get the quirky appeal of the Cove considering it's a car wash, laundromat, and restaurant. Parking for us was a hassle (we parked in front of the laundromat) and the space was tiny. Maybe, I'll give it another try just for the food but we'll see!"}, {"review_id": "knwIW6cE-oKMdMJ4LwK-Sw", "user_id": "u1fXYQHSFgwbpKl9zjkQ2g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Been coming to The Cove for YEARS!

The food was really good but at 5:30 the line was out the door and it was almost impossible to find a place to sit for our family of 6. We finally found a vacated table but it still had cups and food from the previous tenants. We slid the mess over and took our spot. The food arrived quickly and was correct for the most part (I requested my dressing on the side and it was not). The kids played for a bit after dinner but it was so packed they had been hesitant to get out there. We aren't big fans of restaurants where you stand in line to order then go find your seats so I'm not sure if we would go back again but the food was good and it wasn't very expensive."}, {"review_id": "E3-M_2RvqhCmSpsLiCyj4A", "user_id": "8UlgRYvbvosrIU3iiqeDKQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/29/2017", "text": "Came here for lunch on a Thursday.
