Cold inside because the door was opening and closing so often, but good overall experience and they offered to turn on the heater proactivly. Eggs Benedict was so good!Since the wait line was long and even inside was cold it only gets a 4 star but I'll be back again.Thanks Studio One Case!

This place is pretty small, but they turned tables over quickly which minimized the wait. A friend told us that their specialty is the challah French toast. I tried it. I ordered the original version, with fruit compote and Romanoff sauce. The presentation was surprising. I was expecting the Romanoff sauce to be piled high, but It as not. It also looked as if it would be sickly sweet with the amount of compote provided. It was not. The Romanoff sauce was very tasty. The sour cream cut the sweetness of the whipped cream. The compore tasted like fruit, not like sugar or a jelly sauce. The challah bread was fresh, light, and fluffy. My order came with eggs and bacon. I asked for crispy bacon and this was perfect. No annoying glob of fat on the end. The eggs were eggs. Nothing special, and a little on the cold side. Of course we had 6 at our table, so the eggs probably sat for a minute as the rest of the order as assembled. If you're in Eugene, I'd suggest that you give this place a try. Great service, and a laid back atmosphere, with good quality food."}, {"review_id": "-Dp7wMohWXs5YHCsEWcKHQ", "user_id": "TyIF6VLAX3XUmHJzPGMWtw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/1/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The wait was longer because there was a Ducks game.

It's small, busy, but has great food. Summer is the time to go, since they have outdoor seating, why wouldn't you choose to eat outside on a nice sunny day. The omelettes are by far my favorite, but I love that they serve sweet potato fries instead of regular house fries, seriously revolutionary. The staff is nice and check on you often.

For me 3 stars usually means I enjoyed it, but I wasn't wowed by it. That's exactly the case here. My husband and I were in the mood for brunch so we picked this place because my husband heard good things and they have mimosas (that sold me). I think they are a little overpriced, especially being a place that college students seem to frequent. It is a small place, not fancy, but I enjoyed the small diner feel and decor. My meal was fine. I had the croissant breakfast sandwich. I might get something else if we return. My husband liked his omelette although he though it was weird that they used pizza style Italian sausage in it. I tasted one bite of pancake and it was good. The best thing I tasted was the home fries! SO yummy and crispy. Overall we had a nice brunch.

Eat and go people, at a leisurely yet appropriate rate, of course.  When I finally sat we ordered zorro's pride (eggs on a polenta cake, salsa, and sour cream, and came with rice and beans), and eggs, ham, spinach and home fries covered with hollandaise.  Both were delicious, but not phenomenal.  A decent meal, however, possibly not worth the eait"}, {"review_id": "0xWrbqcO7vFst8JYs3OxTQ", "user_id": "At3-y3n3OEfNlNEg9A1GMA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Cool setting, home style environment.

Then, the coffee is flavored water, you better add some salts into. The Benedict egg is good shape as a carb cake, it must used special pan instead of normal way, but the chef should the the right temperature for keep the white part be solid instead of liquid. The sauce is plain as coffee, why not put more eggs instead of water? The green veg on plate is to dry. The only special idea is the tomato under the egg, but the raw tomato should be better quality. 1 buy coffee bean from goat or Starbucks. 2 hiring a better chef. you don't deserve be compare to marche or glen wood.

I had a 'make you're own' omelet. They don't have any menu omelets so, all are 'build your own.'  My ingredients were onions, jack cheese, sausage, and avocado slices (they just list guacamole but you can get avocado slices if you ask).  Absolutely delicious. I was so impressed with the flavor and freshness of the ingredients I asked about the sausage and they said it, and their bacon, are locally sourced!  The county hash browns/potatoes - exactly the way I like them (and I normally don't); nice and crispy and great flavor. I thought it was a nice touch that the chef serves each meal. Makes me think a chef would care a little more about their food that way. Anyway, a small hidden place (converted home) popular with the local neighbors that you too can enjoy by finding it the way I did!"}, {"review_id": "232_a9oFERfEb01Qq62ohQ", "user_id": "PyiQy7xI9WVkWEbaltUc-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "So amazing!
