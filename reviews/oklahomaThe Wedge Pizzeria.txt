I had a salad and personal pizza Canadian Bacon and onions. Delicious. The crust was perfect. Not chewy or burnt as you get sometimes with a wood fired oven. There was a hint of smoke in the crust that just adds to the flavor. IMHO, the best pizza in town. Oh!

I love the atmosphere here. Inside it has great lighting, outside there is a great patio. The service is always wonderful. They are always within sight and never overbearing. The prices are definitely a little higher than I want to pay for pizza on average, so I don't come too often. It's been a while, but they generally do have a few specials that are definitely worth it:Monday Night with a Keep It Local card - bogo!Monday - Friday Lunch special - personal pizza with a half salad. I think it's $8. Free flatbread (with Keep It Local card)$5 breakfast! (They can also make it to-go)The lunch special was definitely worth it. I went with the salad and the pizza listed on the special board: brussel sprout salad - delicious - and I think it was the pork philly. I wasn't crazy about it, but it wasn't bad. I have found a new love for arugula because of The Wedge. I generally order the Napoli with the Prosciutto E Formaggi being my second fav. I have also tried the prosciutto wrapped pears and enjoyed them. I do think the pears should be cut into 6ths, but I have a small mouth. I wasn't fond of the Truffle Shuffle, but I plan to venture out and try the Vedge and the Margherita."}, {"review_id": "Af_XmpQqcBiJZkBWr5qeig", "user_id": "Y791kIlgjZxgHCYl4qb74w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "This is one of the best lunch specials in the city!  You can get a personal pizza or calzone and a salad for $8!  I meannnnn if that isn't reason enough to visit then I dont know what else would be!My hubs and I started with the meatballs which were tender but delicious.  They give you 3 very good size meatballs that would be great to share with a group.  I ordered the Brussels sprouts salad which was very good and fresh plus a make your own lunch special of mozzarella, pepperoni and jalapeño.  It was pretty tasty even though I wish I had known the jalapeños were fresh instead of pickled.  My husband ordered the caesar and the margarita pizza.  He really enjoyed the caesar and but his pizza was a little bit underdone, next time he will ask for extra crispy since that is his favorite!  For dessert we shared the strawberry cake, which my husband loved because he has a major sweet tooth but it was WAYYYY too sweet for me.  All in all, I love this local OKC establishment and will definitely be back for lunch to try new combos of the lunch special and breakfast!"}, {"review_id": "nAPBJHL39Y5V__wBLWJR8w", "user_id": "fYaiBMYHEh94DaqGzFfSoQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/19/2017", "text": "Wow, I had a great experience here for dinner. My boyfriend had a pizza craving and it really seemed like the Wedge was our best bet for a good meal. Note: if you check in on Yelp you get 10% off your meal! Also, we didn't try it for breakfast but it seems like they have a great breakfast deal where you choose a food and beverage for $5. It's very intimate, this isn't the place to bring more than four people in your party. However, that meant the service was really great! We both ordered personal pizza-sized Brisket pizzas (which were $8 each since the price isn't on the menu) and a coke. I ordered my brisket pizza with marinara instead of the garlic cream sauce and without cheese and it was soooooooo good. I had never thought about how amazing the combination of brisket, poblano peppers, and grilled onions could be. It was honestly so good and unique, you have to try it!I noticed they also offered craft beer (at great prices), ice cream and sorbet so if I was an OKC local, I would absolutely be a regular here."}, {"review_id": "weBp34lcn2xExz8SX-gZfw", "user_id": "k0qip8EKFasSFDc5U13ZIg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/18/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I've been to the Wedge a few times now. It's one of those places I think you forget about, because it's kind of out of the way of most major stuff. It's a single, standalone building, but the best part is, it has its very own parking lot (and I have never had trouble finding a space).The restaurant itself is quite small, and very intimate. If you're facing the oven, you can see all the pizzas being cooked. On this occasion however, I was facing the windows, watching a massive storm roll in! It was the perfect night to be indoors. I ordered a BYO Pizza using Roasted Garlic, Mozzarella, Prosciutto, and Arugula. At the suggestion of our waiter, I added the balsamic on the table (he was right, perfect addition). The only thing I didn't love was the roasted garlic, which was strange, considering how much I love roasted garlic. I would definitely get a different sauce next time, as it wasn't what I expected. I ordered a slice of strawberry cake for dessert, which was bright pink and very good. We waited a bit longer for the storm to end, and headed out. It was a lovely evening, and very enjoyable meal. Hopefully one of these visits I'll actually be able to enjoy the patio!"}, {"review_id": "0ZPbioGvXBDhoWHnGBaOlQ", "user_id": "QnW0yro7yoWQyzTtYA9Q-Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Very, very dirty place. The menus were dirtier than the bathroom and kitchen, that's saying something. Service is barely meh at best. Two different waiters took our order. Second one insisted the other guy was missing so he better take it again. I was surprised by a fairly limited beer and wine menus and a non existent cocktail menus. The restaurant is very loud and cramped and it wasn't even that busy at the time. The food. Pizza severely lacked salt and I can deal with that. That's what salt shakers are for. The big problem was the soggy and  barely warm crust . The upside is that they didn't charge me for my glass of wine. A glass of wine that was served in a whisky glass by the way haha, but that's just funny."}, {"review_id": "iLxkdVVjCvB-dlikcI6KDw", "user_id": "W-UQ-hYx5OW2y628f_Oz7Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Last night we went to the Wedge Pizzeria on N.

It's is not like other places. You can taste the homemade tradition in every pie. For pies, I'm a fan of the Italian Stallion and the Truffle Shuffle with a good Italian bira; such as a Peroni, because, why not. When I go, I usually get the Wedge Flatbread for an appetizer. Ask for the pesto to dip the bread, it's a little extra but totally worth it. There is a patio out back with a covered area or an open sky. For those with kids, there is a great enclosed playground off to the back of the patio area. You can see the kids playing and it's far enough away to have a conversation and not get interrupted too much. For desert I recommend an Italian Soda or the gelato."}, {"review_id": "xM53IdqW87yt6qh_S7dAEg", "user_id": "GVIhloheUhuu7N5QyOgx5A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/19/2017", "text": "I might catch some flak for this review, but The Wedge, in my opinion, is just an a-ok pizza place these days. A few years back it could be considered one of the best, if not the best pizza places in the city, but with all of the new pizza shops opening up, it seems The Wedge just hasn't been able to keep up. Saying The Wedge is just a-ok is by no means a knock on the place, but there are just a bunch of other options I think of before The Wedge. With that said... if someone wants to eat here, I'll never say no, but I won't usually go out of my way to eat here either. I will admit, however, that the Prosciutto e Formaggi pizza is still one of my favorites around town though.While I love how quaint this location is, it's a total bummer their bar is limited to only beer and wine. I suppose if you're not much of a drinker, this isn't a big deal, but if you don't drink beer and don't really like wine, then... well... you get it. (I will fully admit that last comment sounded a little uppity, but I still wanted to make it.)So, to sum up... The Wedge is good... just isn't my go-to spot for pizza anymore."}, {"review_id": "SyS_2Au_r-Nm60T0XBveLA", "user_id": "Pjk0cNsCF8i7ssrzuc0G5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/9/2017", "text": "My experience with pizza in Oklahoma City is very limited. If I do decide to cut the norm and actually go sit down somewhere for pizza usually my first stop is Empire or Upper Crust. I wasn't on that side of town, I didn't feel like going to that side of town, and the wedge was across the street. So en route to the wedge we stopped. I didn't know what to expect, I've only seen it from the outside so when I walked in and saw that it was the most quaint rustic homey environment I was TOO impressed. Me and my friend decided to sit outside in the \"backyard\" and I was stumped again. They have an ACTUAL playground in the back patio!After the shock of the playground in the back, and reigning in my inner child we sat down and looked at the menu.  The menu boasted pizzas of all different kinds. There were pizzas that were loaded with fresh ingredients, some meat lovers, and even a vegan option. Me and my friend decided to do two personal pizzas and we just split those. My option was the brisket pizza (mozzarella, peppers, brisket, jalapenos I think? )and hers was the Italian sausage and fennel pizza. Our waiter came, took our order, whisked away, and (it felt like minutes) he came back with hot steamy cheese gooey I should feel guilty about it but I never will pizzas. QUICK PAUSE: I didn't even know I liked fennel until I took a bite of that pizza. THAT WAS THE BEST BITE....ever. I'm actually craving it now that I'm writing about it. My brisket pizza was great and somehow my friend ended up liking my pizza more than her own, and vice versa. FOR 8 BUCKS a person?! I was pleasantly surprised!! I love restaurants who can give me the quick and easy fuss free just plain old good food experience and I believe the wedge did that. I will go back.... Definitely.....For sure...
