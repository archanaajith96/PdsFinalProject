The chicken here is really tasty, and every side I tried was delicious. I'm going to be so dissapointed when I'm back home and can't go back to Cajun's. Some standout sides were the biscuits and mashed potatoes. The biscuits were perfectly flaky and buttery, the mashed potatoes were buttery and very smooth. If I had one complaint, it was that the fried fish was almost too salty. Other than that, I was beyond satisfied with the food at Cajun's."}, {"review_id": "ms5JM3bIBXzRcUUnB6my7Q", "user_id": "gHtqoc_VbUdCB58jzjXizg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Well, we were kind of on the fence to try the place but, we made it in, first off they do not take debit or credit cards. But they do have an atm right there. But luckily I had some money on me from this morning, the staff was very nice, the tables were very clean the food was buffet style and they had everything from mashed potatoes, collard greens, green beans, black eye peas, corn bread, scratch made biscuits, dinner rolls, and most important of all THE FRIED CHICKEN!!! They have spicy, mild, Catfish, and fried chicken liver. Lots of other sides and their deserts may very but what we had was brownies, apple pie, and vanilla ice cream. Yum yum yum!!!"}, {"review_id": "ngxfLZSchql-73m1-0XH_Q", "user_id": "9oXT99Pa2HhhWdS8yoXOBA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "Haven't had a chance to try the entire buffet but it was packed for lunch time. It's not Popeyes but they do a pretty good chicken. U can do Buffett, a Buffett to go, or just order some chicken. I must say the buffet was tempting based on appearance. Ordered 3pac, which was 3 thighs and a biscuit for $3.99; a pretty good deal I think. The skin on the chicken was crispy; a lil greasy but hey it's chicken."}, {"review_id": "uHjnWFecRt5zUgZFzzvzFg", "user_id": "26BRT0-E8XX9-Hher7Evzg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "OMG this place was so good.  Everything was so fresh and the staff was friendly.  The only thing they need is lemonade and strawberry soda.  Well worth the $8.99.  Oh cash only but there is an ATM on site."}, {"review_id": "KmTnuk_gTrBRPb_LW5xcZQ", "user_id": "uhEcJI4WE02ExhsuXtg3YQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/22/2017", "text": "Very unhealthy food choice......but then again it's SO DAMN GOOD!!!

Cajuns was almost the perfect match. However, it had a fast food Hartz Chicken restaurant ambiance. It's self serve buffet was just okay. Well, the cabbage w/bacon was actually 100% homemade and delicious! The fried chicken livers were crunchy and fresh, but could have used some seasoning. As for the chicken, it was beautifully fried, but it lacked flavor. I actually selected their 'spicy' chicken and it was null and void of any spice. My husband tried the red beans w/sausage over rice with cornbread and said it was pretty good. As for the limited cobbler desserts and other veggies on the buffet, we decided to bypass as they did not appeal to our preferences. Overall, Cajuns is very affordable at only $8.99 for the buffet. However, if you're a tourist looking for the real deal southern soul food, this is far from it."}, {"review_id": "bgN1izO6acBMWeS3-iF4ig", "user_id": "AR7Cy8j8xEgHy6ip-rJS-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/17/2016", "text": "I wish I had never been introduced to Cajun's fabulous fried chicken. I've been for the lunch rush...the dinner rush...there's always a packed house at this divey little chicken shack. This is like walking into your grandmas house for Sunday dinner, once you open the door the delicious smells make you feel right at home. They have everything a southern soul food craving belly desires, I won't detail them as the sides and proteins have been thoroughly covered in other reviews. Favorites: the catfish, spicy chicken, cabbage, black eyed peas, turnips, taters and gravy. The sweet tea is always on point, as are the dinner rolls. PRO TIP: The turnip greens basically demand their own bowl. You will need cornbread for this endeavor, it is sacrilege to skip either at Cajun's. The cornbread is also amazing with the cabbage. All I needed was sliced garden tomatoes to bring me back to childhood (sad I didn't see any on the salad bar). The only thing I would like to change would be the serving plates. The small round ones aren't nearly robust enough for a savage appetite, or even if you wanna try a bit of everything. Foam school lunch trays are where its at y'all, maybe I'll suggest it next time I'm there. Post Script: Treated my dad to the fabulousness yesterday. After finishing his considerably large meal, he exclaimed that he could live nowhere near Cajun's, he would be 500 pounds and still trying to fit in the booths. And we didn't even try the desserts. Second tip: Soft serve on tap. Southern pepper sauce stays on the tables- I suggest adding a bit to your greens or over your chicken. Perfection."}, {"review_id": "Q893hZZ-09sEh472xFK43A", "user_id": "Mjt4ZFZz7agcXzHmz1M2mw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/7/2017", "text": "One of the best all-you-care-to-eat buffets if you're a fried chicken fan. Brownies and ice cream for dessert. The fried fish is decent, but not what I'm there for. Lots of variety on the vegetable side of things. Baked beans, red beans and rice, corn, other stuff.  All good. Always busy and hard to get a seat sometimes, especially at lunch.

I absolutely love this place! Sure it gets a little cramped during peak times, but the food is incredible! Everything prepared and seasoned well! And the chicken!! I love the spicy - has a nice kick, but you can still taste the chicken itself! Some of the best sweet tea out there and a great little dessert bar! My only wish is that they would have baked chicken - even one day a week would be wonderful!

I must say, it's not what you might think. I thought it was some cheap little fried chicken place. Noooo! This is a Southern Comfort Food Buffet! I have no idea what they put in their food but it is incredible! Everything is cooked and seasoned PERFECTLY. The chicken livers, fried catfish, steamed cabbage and jambalaya were awesome! Thier brownies can only be described as heavenly!They have a huge selection, all of which is hot, fresh and FANTASTIC. For under $9 bucks a person you cannot go wrong.The ONLY reason I'm not giving a full 5/5 stars is because they do not accept credit/debit cards. They do have an ATM but it charges you $2.50... C'mon now you guys, your food is excellent, please get with the times as EVERYONE is using debit and credit and tiny little businesses can get those little smart phone plug in's or ipad's to accept a card payment. It's not tough and will help your customers tremendously. On my way back through I was going to stop again at this place but didn't have much time and realized I didn't have the cash on me, so regretfully I had to keep driving. Please please please fix that one issue folks, because your service and food is incredible."}, {"review_id": "Cho-4m3VSrNDtZbbu7P1dQ", "user_id": "MeY3PjF0ugHUM4gy9gDgbw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/3/2017", "text": "This is my favorite restaurant.
