Being from North Carolina, we know all about great BBQ, and this place is TOP NOTCH! Don't let the exterior of the building fool you. As soon as you pull up and open the car doors you can smell the smoked meat, and you know you're at the right place.The sampler plate is a great way to try all the smoked meats and makes a large meal for one or can be shared by two light eaters. I ordered the half rack of ribs with smoked Mac and cheese and baked beans. The ribs were tender and meaty with awesome smoky flavor. The sweet and tangy sauce perfectly complemented the ribs. The Mac and cheese is rich and creamy, and the baked beans had a thick savory and sweet taste. For dessert, the blackberry cobbler topped off the meal, and had us bursting at the seams and leaving satisfied. I would recommend this place to any BBQ lover, no matter where you're from!"}, {"review_id": "GABMeu0Vc_iCnKfF9i0TSA", "user_id": "v3QcSyIpV9r8Mw_AXkqo4w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Family visit to Rollin Smoke BBQOur family was visiting Charleston, and we looked up a place close to where we were. We're from New Jersey and didn't have a clue where we should eat, and there were 19 of us! We took a chance on Rollin Smoke and we were so glad we did! The bbq was amazing!!!! Since there were so many of us, we all tried something different and shared (because you get huge portions). Everything we had was so delicious, frog legs, brisket, chicken, pulled pork, Amish potato salad, cole slaw, sausage and the smoked baked beans (everyone raved about them!). One of our party was a vegetarian, but there were so many sides to pick from too. This is a hidden jewel in Charleston, West Virginia. It is some really awesome bbq! We can't say enough about how good the food was!"}, {"review_id": "pC1be6Cjd2TuaHBJJjFtmw", "user_id": "rOaYvAjuROiEgU_y4TPZEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/20/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Incredible ribs and BBQ.

The mac and cheese was dried out and tasted like it was spoiled. The blackberry cobbler was just like the one I get frozen out at Sams.

If you looking for good southern BBQ this is it. There is limited parking, not a place for a tour bus but if you don't mind parking where the grass is grown up this is the place. Daily specials for 6 or 7$ and it definitely beats chain fast food. So get on over and have some BBQ."}, {"review_id": "thk5tTGbxlrexAmhJD5qFQ", "user_id": "Z5vgqy7-l1Jxv109-okHmQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/15/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I have always liked the food at Rollin Smoke BBQ and we have had them cater several events. I have given them good reviews in the past. However at our TU chapter's banquet the other night, I was very disappointed with what they served. The pulled pork was average and there could have been much more on the sandwich. The brisket served to me, which is what I always recommend, was much less than a half of a very thin slice and that was one third fat.  The baked beans were good, though half thin liquid, The other two sides were not very good at all. The highlight of the meal that was served was the very small piece of blackberry cobbler. Again, They could have done much better and I am very disappointed in what they served."}, {"review_id": "-Zd5lgpD_qguCpJQeioIhw", "user_id": "s0uQt8r1GQt3Hr0sG6iWyA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/29/2017", "text": "Off the main road the curb appeal was awesome.  They were nice and the food was good.  Great smoke flavor and the sauce was tasty.  Ive been everywhere for BBQ so I can give it 5 stars, as it was not the best.  But.....   Worth it.."}, {"review_id": "onLa0W59T1K0KqabnRKqSA", "user_id": "ib6yTMcMYPdKBJQQOFDjig", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/24/2017", "text": "We were traveling through the area and consulted Yelp on a good BBQ place. Rollin Smoke was rated 4.5 stars.  Beware this place is not really in Charleston but quite a ways out of town in an unincorporated community.Rollin Smoke has no enclosed dining area, just a deck overlooking a river. Might be delightful in the summer. Not so much in mid April and 60 degrees with a light wind. As to the food. The Texas Brisket was plentiful and tender but lacked a strong BBQ flavor. The red potato salad was quite tasty.The pricing seemed high given the location and overall food quality."}, {"review_id": "7ufnuBlPNXnw-3hABTK-cA", "user_id": "DcFd084dJR4Ze4eCtTfb2w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/7/2017", "text": "wow!! a bit off the beaten path but that is part of the charm. It's small w/ maybe room for 2 doz guests.  The portions of pulled pork were huge & so good. My husband had the brisket sandwich & it melted in his mouth. 17 yo son was adventurous & had the smoked cornish hens. well there's a1st time for everything!  We had the mac n cheese, cheesy hash brown casserole (beats Cracker Barrel's !), The drinks are bottled so no refills but still ok at $1ea. I wanted something sweet so we got a pint of Hershey;'s brand bourbon salted carmel ice cream (something like that). soo good. Tip: it's a better deal to do it this way vs 2 one scoop orders. 2 of us split the container. Husband had the blackberry cobbler. Smallish portion but said it was tasty.  We like little locally owned joints like this. it did not disappoint! Also, they have 2 locations plus own a food truck.

Thought out of the blue that I would give the place a try. So, I place my order for several different items to get an overall pic of the place. My order consisted of 4 pounds of smoke pork and 2 pounds of Smoke Chicken with the BBQ sauce on the side for each, along with 4 lg sides of cheesy potatoe casserole and 2 lg baked beans. So to say the least I was feeding the family. When I got home and was putting the spread out I quickly found out that there were problems. There was no BBQ sauce at all, and they had bag up the casserole in individual containers; which was fine but put the bake beans in a flimsy round container with a paper lid and to top it off they put the 4 heavy casseroles on top so beans where spilling out everywhere. Needless to say I was not happy, and quickly called the establishment. For a first time impression is was horrible!!!  They offered to make it right, and I give them all he respect for that. And, even spoke to Carl the owner! Which was very nice about the situation, and I got the impression hat he was not happy either. As for the BBQ I can say that it was as good as the young man said it was, and even mentioned once I tasted I would be back because I never got it!!!For me this was bust and would not recommend it! Sad, because when you have a mom and pop business your locals are what keeps you going. To bad I can support this mom and pop business!!Yelp and Facebook people my opinion don't go!"}, {"review_id": "obZSYH4hWjiZKJojoIwuzA", "user_id": "8y9bkTtM77kDehE-mewhsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/8/2017", "text": "Had the Brisket and the wife had the pulled pork, we had cheesy potatoe casserole and the green bean casserole.

Boy, this place is good. So good, in fact, that I'm considering making the West Virginia route to Illinois the only route I'll ever take, just because it brings us near Charlestown, WV, where the wizards at Rolling Stone do their barbeque magic. I'm no expert in BBQ but growing up in Virginia means that I'm no stranger either,  by any measure of the word. This place is bomb! Very friendly staff and man, that BBQ was even friendlier to my palate. We had the mixed platter and it did not disappoint. Moist and almost decadent brisket. Smokey and delicious chicken. Pulled pork was great too.My only advice - come here for their meat. Its what they do. The other stuff (sides, etc) is good too, but why fill yourself with other food when they've clearly put hours into their meat?"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/rollin-smoke-bbq-charleston?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
