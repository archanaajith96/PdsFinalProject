I met a few friends here for dinner on a Friday night. They don't take reservations, but getting a table was not an issue at all. We arrived a few minutes after 7pm. The atmosphere is casual.I ordered the salmon burger done medium with a side of Mac and cheese. The rest of my party ordered salads. We had the jalapeño cornbread and Brussels sprouts as shared sides. The cornbread is not spicy. It is the perfect blend of sweet. The Brussels sprouts were done just right and the flavor was great. The portion sizes are pretty large. I struggled to finish my meal and I never have that problem. A couple of us had the strawberry crush. It's a nice light summer drink. I am looking forward to dining here again."}, {"review_id": "5fiJ7syBrHBfecBpO-2leA", "user_id": "5ZsYpjXjj8HqzM02vIMffg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Do you like mac and cheese? If the answer is yes, say no more. Dreams do come true.However, my boyfriend and I both got the grain bowl and it was halfway decent (btw it was a cold dish, which we didn't know). We took it home and it tasted so much better when we heated it up. We looked over and saw that people got burgers and onion rings and wish we had gotten them. Also, instead of mints, they give out starbursts which is actually really cute plus! Summary: If you're trying to be healthy, don't come here. If you want mouth watering mac and cheese, come here!!!"}, {"review_id": "T6kHAxuP_GbHnh3vtXRx_A", "user_id": "IpsjqYPp3cGqTEnzsEv4iQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Came in with good expectations and left disappointed. We (3 people) came in around 830pm after an intense gym session. We were hungry and want to drop dollars on some good Texas BBQ. This place was nearby with good reviews so we decided to check it out. Due to the popularity, we were expecting a wait time. Surprisingly we only waited about 3 mins before being seated.To start our night, we ordered the brisket sliders, accompanied with a glass of wine. For the main course, we all ordered the wagyu steak. We couldn't wait to eat! However, the waiter wasn't attentive, we had to stop him to make our order. They said everything is bigger in Texas, but definitely not at this place with their food. The portions are smaller. However, the brisket slider was good. The wagyu steak was only alright. What really made us upset was that our waiter Matthew did not check on us once, nor asked us how our steak was cooked. He had a very apathy attitude which made us wanting to walk out. The bill was 140 total. We probably won't return."}, {"review_id": "rqBFqGQLcvD5MCs45VVYkw", "user_id": "gmT8b1TIBSdbt-tncoMiTQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "We had a good time here for Sunday brunch. We opted for the bar seating and avoided the wait.  So right off the bat, having a full service bar with 2-3 bartenders was nice!!!!  The fact that the bartender knew what a Rusty Nail was and made it without the aid of a book or phone had my attention, quickly!  The lady bartender was really cool and gave great suggestions for my wife. Wife had the chicken sandwich and kept trying to get me to taste it because it was good  and I've just started my \"no fried foods\" eating regimen.  I had the salmon burger and loved the fact that they had a few non-fried side options!  I wound up with the fruit cup and it was so good. They were very attentive and made sure we didn't have to ask for anything.  The food was great and the wife -by suggestion of the bartender- fell in love with the butter cake (I got the cinnamon ice cream!!!!). Even the patrons were cool and friendly.  We would definitely go back."}, {"review_id": "gC9j0N-xeAL4Zzz-XRY63A", "user_id": "VVxDe3-2NdjFPRj1z8Fpgg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "Healthy options. Fresh food. Well cooked. I like it. I stopped in for lunch with some colleagues. The environment is casual like many of the restaurants in the Knox/Henderson area. My server was knowledgeable, friendly and prompt. What I like about this place is that they have options if you're looking to eat a little more heavy/greasy and also options if you're looking to eat a little more clean. Their salads are super good. The drink menu is pretty legit as well, so if you appreciate a good cocktail, The Porch is still a solid option. The following is based 100% on my own judgement:  I would recommend this place for a casual date, lunch with coworkers or even a quick bite/drink with friends. My personal opinion, leave the kiddies at home. This place gives me adult vibes, not the toddler screaming in a corner vibe. Overall, I'd return. Thumbs up!"}, {"review_id": "2R1ycRoxGYiNZl9qmVjZOQ", "user_id": "XYf63xwuYgWaqFuTLzxhNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Great lunch/brunch spot!!For starters, would recommend the Pimiento Cheese Dip or the Burrata & Toast -- both are perfect to share and the toast is amazing!! The Buttermilk Fried Chicken Cobb salad is the BEST. The chicken taste just like Chick-fil-a (perfect Sunday fix) and it's a pretty big salad with a lot of chicken. The Salmon Burger is my new favorite -- not dry at all or fishy, and perfectly crispy on the outside. So good it has inspired me to try to recreate it. And the Brussels Sprouts!!!!! So cheesy and packed with flavor -- definitely not healthy sprouts but if you like Brussels, would 10/10 get these. I still dream about them. Always recommend sitting on the porch -- intimate feel even on a busy street. The inside of the restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the bar seating is a perfect spot if there's a long wait."}, {"review_id": "zNxvqpTGz1rrQe9HXjpEYA", "user_id": "H7ft8Ap3zBPXEJYVKtKNyw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/14/2017", "text": "I've been waiting to write this review for about a week but I think now I'm ready.First thing, I found this place on yelp of course since I was in the area with my boyfriend and cousin and we wanted a great place for brunch. With over 1k reviews I knew this place was going to be great. When we arrived they offered complimentary valet which was nice since area has 0 parking available. When entered the restaurant we were quickly seated and met with our waiter. The initial experience was starting off wonderful so I know you're wondering why I'm giving this place a 1 star review..keep reading..Our waiter who was great served us quickly. We all had their mimosas which were $5 during brunch (great deal). I ordered the croque madame, my boyfriend had one of their burgers with an egg over easy, and my cousin had the shrimp and grits. When I tell you this food tasted amazing It really did. We all left with our belly's full and a little buzzed from the mimosas.Now about two hours after we ate and I got home and thats where It all got shitty. I didn't eat anything before or after The Porch so I knew they were the cause of this. I spent roughly 32 hours hanging out in my bathroom vomiting every hour or so because I got food poisoning from this place. I have never felt so much pain in my life until that day. I had a fever of 102. I had to go to the doctor bc I was so dehydrated and I kept throwing up. The doctors chalked It up to possible salmonella poisoning. Horrible way to spend the weekend.Sadly I was really excited about coming here and had a horrible after experience because of something I ate there"}, {"review_id": "dGsaAlFFXKm686hWz7VOHw", "user_id": "bfXBrqCVXw-3tyDAOzqBuA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Food is great and the atmosphere is lovely the staff is wonderful too I come often"}, {"review_id": "Q2KxE4x9hv_oQKQrLVIgew", "user_id": "BDBd7Yep1Nj1OSn4hcZ6PA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "AMAZING !!!!!!!!

We ordered the spinach artichoke dip, incredible. One of my friends scarfed that thing down before we got two dips- and by friend, I mean.. me. Bloop. I ordered the pimento cheese dip for us as well. Wonderful combo with the ham and arugula, but the char on the bread tasted bleh- toasted pita bread or toast without the flame char would be much better. I also had the blood orange margarita, the room was spinning and faces were a blur in the few seconds I downed my drink like a dummy. It was so good! For dinner, we had the salmon burger, two porch salads and a crab cake salad. All of us were full and feeling good. Good night at the porch, very good indeed!"}, {"review_id": "N0DALRhNhn345_CNdMvu0Q", "user_id": "Rx-yuTcHTBZ8cJWQPTu9IA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "I came here last weekend while I was in town visiting.

Not only did this restaurant have friendly hosts and waiters, but it also had delicious food and drinks. I'm not one to eat the same foods when going to restaurants, but I would definitely go back for their Mac and Cheese as well as their jalapeño cornbread. The wait was approximately 20 minutes on a Friday night, but the bar had open seating. The patient and personable bartender made the wait enjoyable. The signature cocktail drinks were great, but personally wouldn't go back to get again (I got the Blood Orange Margarita & Pecan Old Fasioned). Our waiter was awesome! He frequently checked up on us and was always positive giving us great recommendations. The hummus plate (appetizer) had a lot of slices of pita, which was perfect in proportion to the amount of hummus. The Mac and Cheese had the perfect amount of cheesiness. The cornbread had just the right amount of moisture coupled with the light honey butter on top, making it one of the best side dishes I've ever had."}, {"review_id": "4xk56SSzR6Ni_DSZjlkatw", "user_id": "03jhQqje2OTrmtfs99lP9A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "One of my favorite date night spots with my bf.

Lively atmosphere and outdoor patio, with an enticing drink list.For lunch on this weekday, I chose the salmon burger with fresh fruit on the side. The whole wheat bun worked with the huge patty, as did the flavorful sauce. This area seems to be hopping, with lots of restaurant competition along the street. Friendly service too.
