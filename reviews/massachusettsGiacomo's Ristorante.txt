Is it worth the wait? Are you crazy?!.... yes, it is THAT good. yes, it's worth it so shut up and just get to the back of the line already. And YES call me crazy cause I love Giacomo's!  I keep on coming back here because the food here is superb and the prices are fairly reasonable. The calamari is undoubtedly THE best calamari I have ever tried. Fried to perfection, they add in fried peppers so that the dish has a nice spice/kick to it. I highly recommend the lobster ravioli--the sauce is so velvety and super flavorful and they are really generous with the lobster. You also can't go wrong with their linguine where you get to select your choice of seafood(s) and a sauce that satisfies your palate.  I can see why many people might have hesitations on coming here because of the long wait, cramped space, and quick turn-around of customers, but Giacomo's isn't deemed a North end staple for no good reason!! So trust me, come to Giacomo's because the food will speak for itself and put your initial doubts to shame."}, {"review_id": "oJmPnmLxx5QiM7hSzRldsg", "user_id": "8h1r7mXd-H225yDgc4EMPg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "We came here on a Monday night and were pleased to find only four groups ahead of us in line. The wait was relatively short- maybe about 15 minutes and there's plenty of people watching to entertain yourself while you wait. We were seated at a table for two that very closely abutted another table for two- so much that it almost felt like we dining with two others. It's pretty cramped in here. However, it was not overly loud, which was nice and we could easily converse. We ordered a bottle of wine and we each got the linguine with half a lobster, mussels and clams in the Giacomo's lobster sauce. So delicious and very reasonably priced at around $20 per plate. Note that they are cash only, so make sure to have cash on hand. The food was absolutely amazing- so fresh and delicious and served piping hot. My only complaint was that our server was kind of abrupt. He basically told me that no he wasn't giving me any more parmesan cheese on top of the pasta when I indicated I wanted more. He also threw down our water, wine and meals- nothing delicate about the placement of the glasses or dishes here. Moreover, when my companion got up to use the bathroom, both our server and another server tried to clear the plate away. Our server even argued with me about it. The food came out really quick though, so no complaints about the speed of the service. You do feel kind of rushed to eat and leave because there's a line of people waiting, but the food is really good quality and a great price. Very cool North End experience. Highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "bZ_XBteck-ChkxW26TCh5w", "user_id": "E228mDCTynPcyNdIXtsSYA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "The hype is real with giacomos as you see quickly when you see the line stretch down the corner as soon as you approach the restaurant.

The are very efficient and fast but can only do so much with the size of the restaurant. The food was excellent. Not the best I have ever had but right up there. We got a bunch of stuff and shared it. We started with calamari and mozzarella sticks. Both were pretty good. The mozzarella sticks come soaked in a tomato sauce. After that, we got chicken parmigiana and a seafood pasta. Both were cooked extremely well and the ingredients were good. One thing I really liked about this place was our waiter gave real suggestions. My friend mentioned something he wanted and the waiter said, \" nah, you want to try this if it's your first time.\"  I hate when waiters just say \" everything is good.\"  Service was excellent. If you are looking to sit down and take your time during a meal this is probably not the place to go during busy hours. They also only accept cash. Prices are very reasonable.

The small fried calamari here is probably the equivalent of a large at other places, it was definitely more than enough for two people, as we had some leftovers to take home! The fried calamari has includes some fried peppers too, which gives it a nice sour/spicy kick every few bites. The calamari is always fried perfectly, the breading is always crispy and the calamari itself has a tender bite.  Just found out today that there's a sauce for the mussels that isn't listed on the menu: spicy lobster sauce! It is a slightly spicy tomato-based red sauce that has seafood flavor. No surprise that it went well with the mussels, that were very fresh and well cooked. Other sauces that are good include red sauce and the diavolo sauce. I usually get one of the seafood pastas as my entrée, and the seafood has always been very fresh, and I really like the red sauce! Tried the special for the first time today: pepper pasta with baby shrimp, spinach, mussels with a creamy mushroom sauce. There was a very smoky flavor to it which reminded me of bacon or smoked foods. The mussels in the pasta dish was a lot saltier and smokier, which makes me think that it was smoked. While I liked how this dish tasted, I probably will not be getting it again because it is heavy/creamy dish, and I was struggling to eat it after the first couple of bites. For dessert, our server strongly recommended the fried apple cheesecake. But I decided to get the tiramisu instead. Besides being a little too sweet for my liking, the tiramisu was delicious! It was also very suitable for takeout, which I did because I was so full from dinner but still wanted dessert. It has a substantial amount of coffee flavor, and you can tell that the cream contained cheese and not just whipped cream.Our server was very friendly and attentive, and she also gave recommendations! Great service overall!"}, {"review_id": "UQhWq2QXO8jWFYGoiCmEVA", "user_id": "tNq35k92WAkSLSqeof03hg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "The lines are known to be epic for Giacomo's. It opens at 4:30. I ate there on a Thursday. I got there around 5 and the place was already packed. I got the last open table. I also walked by the restaurant on a Friday night. I noticed a couple was already camping out at 4 to beat the lines. At 5, the line was already out the door. The food lived up to its reputation. For my appetizer, I ordered the fried calamari. The calamari was fresh and tender. It was breaded lightly, which I thought was the perfect balance between calamari and breading. It had a nice crunch to it. The appetizer also included jalapenos and red peppers. They were also breaded and fried. However, they were spicy and had a strong kick to them, which is not my preference. The marinara sauce was excellent. For me entree, I ordered the butternut squash ravioli. The pasta dough was perfect. The butternut squash was not too sweet. I actually prefer it a little more sweet, more like yams. The balance between the amount of pasta dough and the squash was well proportioned though. The sauce was good and added to the dish. Nevertheless, it was nothing extraordinary. The fra diavolo sauce is what Giacomo's is known for, which is something for patrons to keep in mind. In addition, I saw a couple of tables that ordered the zuppa di pesce. They were massive plates of linguine that included 1/2 lobster, mussels, scallops, shrimp, scallops, and calamari. If you enjoy pasta and seafood, it is definitely a dish for you. It is supposed to be for 2 people but it looked like it can definitely feed 3.The lines are long because the food is great and the restaurant is small. It was definitely a tiny, intimate space. The service was rapid fire fast. The food arrives quickly and you will feel hurried by the waitstaff. The waitress was ready to grab my plate as soon as I finished my last bite then gave my check in the same motion. It is understandable because they want to churn tables. Nevertheless, the always in a rush New Yorker in me enjoyed and appreciated it. I get annoyed with having to flag down inattentive staff for my check so I preferred the alternative. Regardless, there are generally long waits for Giacomo's and it is not a great spot for a group that wants to lounge and enjoy each other's company. If you go, understand that your primary mission is to eat great food.If you are visiting and planning a trip to Boston and looking for recommendations (especially food), feel free to message me for my itinerary.

There's usually a decent line outside the restaurant so expect to wait. The line moved pretty fast this past weekend (50 degrees in January what??), but we did get skipped by a few smaller groups because our whole party of 6 weren't all present. They only seat you once your whole party is there. We arrived at 6PM and only waited for about 40 mins which is not the norm. Prices are good for delish fresh seafood and pasta. We got a bottle of red and fried calamari to share. The fried calamari super hot and fried fresh. Very tasty! It was the first time for my group and everyone loved their pastas! I got the Salmon and sun-dried tomatoes with lobster cream fettuccine. Loved everything about the entree. Large pieces of salmon in a pool of yummy creamy sauce. Pasta was perfect! There was lots of sauce which was perfect for dipping the complimentary bread. I also tried the Swordfish and Tuna in Pesto Fettuccine which was also very tasty! Also lots of sauce and large pieces of fresh fish. Service was quick and speedy (without being rude or feeling rushed). It was nice to get your food so fast after waiting awhile outside.

As out-of-towner, my friend and I were dying to go here but were weary of the long wait time. We planned to come on Monday around 3-4pm before they opened to beat the line. We kept an eye on the line by having a drink and waiting at the bar at a next-door restaurant. The plan ended up working and we were within the first batch of people in the restaurant. We started with the calamari and the Caesar salad. I'm not sure how a Caesar salad can be THAT good, but it was absolutely delicious. Whatever they put in the dressing was pure magic. We definitely didn't have the appetite to split the Zuppa di Pesce, but we did get the Frutti di Mare, which is almost the exact same dish without the lobster (sad!). We both went with the red sauce, and we were in love! The service was extremely quick, but I suppose it had to be knowing how many people wait to eat here.

Yep, the weather sucks but what it means is that there was NO WAIT to get in. Seriously, it's sometimes two hours. Today? Five minutes.We got a burrata to share and it was excellent. Good sized portion (about the size of your fist) and topped with fresh basil and drizzled with a sweet balsamic. And then we also got a large platter of calamari. Big portion, very fresh and crisp with just a little bit of heat going on. Tasty stuff.This time, I chose the shrimp and scallops off the menu. Topped with the Giacomo sauce, which is a spicy red sauce that has a bit of cream in there, on top of a big pile of fresh made linguine. A big portion with lots of flavor and lots of sauce for their store-made bread to scoop up. Maybe there could have been more seafood in here, but it was still a good portion for $21.Service was excellent.

I think we only waited about 20 minutes before there was a table for 2 open. There were two groups of more ahead of us but we were seated. We had to get the house special! Hard to resist a full lobster, scallops, calamari, shrimp, and mussels all in a Giacomo's sauce (the house red sauce with cream). We had the bottle of wine added and left dinner $100 lighter. The Chianti was pretty good and was $5 when you got the special.  The plate was pretty big but we managed to eat it all!! We also had started with the fried mozz.

Don't bother if you have to wait more than a few minutes. Was Giacomo's good? Sure. Will I return? Nah. Look - for those of you with tons of time to spare to stand in a crazy long line in the outside to eat super okay Italian food, then this place is for you! But me? No. I'll go to one of the many other places on or around Hanover street. Was the food good here? Sure. Was it great? Lol no. The only reason we even ate here was because we heard the north end is notoriously quiet on Sundays during lent and thought Giacomo's just might have a short enough line for us to finally try it. Well it was only a couple people long and we decided we had to know - is it worth the hype? I think you know my answer. We ordered the burrata as an appetizer as well as the butternut squash ravioli. The burrata was quite nice, I will say. The ravioli on the other had - so so sweet. I think the butternut squash along with the mascarpone sauce was a little too much. The dish was begging for some balance to juxtapose against the two sweet elements. For dinner I got the veal Parmesan. It comes with a side of pasta. I asked what house made pastas were available (I was even willing to pay an up charge) and I was told that I could not get the home made pasta with the veal parm. I had to have the stuff from a box. For being an Italian restaurant on Hanover street that always has a line more than an hour long, I was fairly surprised at the lack of home made pasta options. And then to be told I can't order it...what? If I wanted the homemade pasta, I had to order the special. Which had shrimp and lobster...I have a shellfish allergy so that wasn't actually an option for me. As it is, the veal parm was good. I think maybe I would have preferred the chicken tho. The side of pasta was boxed pasta doused in Red sauce. Shrug. My husband ordered the homemade pasta dish with the lobster and shrimp. I couldn't try it but he said the shellfish was great. He was not a fan of the homemade pasta. My husband will likely return for the two person seafood special, however the menu options are so so limited for me due to my allergy and I found the food to just be okay overall. The plus sides were that the service was excellent and quick. It was also really great that we could have the bottle of wine we ordered with dinner corked to take with us after we finished our meal. Also, cash only so we know what that means."}, {"review_id": "fUGZ7cErLlcSiQ-xljN6Kg", "user_id": "K4SkGkLNJk1_OXa3hqiEDg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Amazing Italian restaurant that makes you feel like you are in eating at a family owned restaurant in Italy.

It was like being at my Italian buddy's house for a home cooked meal. Donna (sorry if I misspelled) was on top of it!

It was as if they knew what people would order from the appetizer menu, because the food came out right away. The food truly was phenomenal! I haven't been this excited since Disneyland. They took the ordinary and made it extraordinary. What I liked even better was that we never felt rushed.

A few people were in line, as I was told to expect, but table wait time wasn't even 5 minutes. Quickly got a seat, and the bread arrived. Being a trained pastry chef/baker, this bread was perfect. Light, slightly chewy, and a perfect color. Blended with their olive oil, salt, and red pepper, this started the meal off nicely. So good that I ordered Garlic Bread, as an app.The prices blew me away. Frutta di Mare (Lobster, Shrimp, Scallops, Calamari, Mussels, and Oysters) with Fra Diavolo was EXCELLENT. For $20 (this would've been $50 plus at my current home in Dallas), it was a steal. The Garlic Bread sopped up that sauce nicely. Small space, but excellent food and service.

We ordered the house special for two which is linguine pasta tossed with sauce of your choice and all the yummy seafood (including a full lobster) for $60 bucks. You can add a bottle of wine for additional $15 or $20 bucks. We also ordered a fried calamari (love the option of small or large app size) and the marinara sauce was amazing. Everything was tasty so no complaints.So going back to the original question... yes it was worth the wait and experience for the first time. The line outside definitely draws more attention and novelty to the experience. Since the North End have an abundant of great Italian restaurants, I would venture out to try others too. If you don't enjoy being super close or sharing tables with others, this is not the place for you. It's also not a place to leisurely eat and chat all night since the restaurant tries to turnover tables quickly.
