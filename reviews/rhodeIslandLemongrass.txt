At minimum.  The food, prices, decor, service and overall cleanliness are always spot on.  They do not specialize in any one Asian cuisine but  they do execute a lot of them well.  Surprisingly, the standard Chinese American items like the boneless spare ribs and crab Rangoon are the items I find less than average.  The spare ribs are sometimes dry and fatty and the crab Rangoon are not always crispy.  That being said, I have enjoyed delightfully crispy Rangoons and not-so-fatty spare ribs here but I feel like you have to nail those items down if you're in the Asian fusion game.Everything else I've had is fantastically consistent. The nime chow is probably in my top five fave list of nine chow ever.  The wrappers are tender, never chewy.  A sure sign that they are making these shrimp filled yummies to order. The won ton soup is a must... The wrappers are delicate and tender giving the lightly spiced pork filling a gentle hug as they swim alongside crisp pea pods in a nicely seasoned broth. Yum.Walnut shrimp is my fave... Candied walnuts atop lightly fried jumbo shrimp with a lightly sweet sauce.  Throw in some basil fried rice and you are heading for shrimp nirvana... Tiny shrimp with fresh basil, pineapple and white rice... Trust me.Then let's talk service... Always terrific. They are attentive and prompt without feeling like you're getting the rush out the door. The owner is present walking the dining rooms and front of the house keeping the gears moving.Like clock work. And that's why I keep going back."}, {"review_id": "EppWSUk3jKJYyGn4jVMAyA", "user_id": "TwgQb6iTLcBSs4hzErTRag", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/7/2017", "text": "When I lived in Warwick, this was my go to Asian restaurant. They had a major renovation which came out pretty nice; the place also expanded. There's a huge parking lot out front and back. During peak hours, this place can take up to 30 minutes to wait; they give you a buzzer.I've had their sushi which was pretty good. I've had their Chinese food which was okay. And I've had their Thai food which was good; I usually order their pad Thai and for an appetizer I like to get their crab Rangoons. The service was okay; not the best but not the worst. Another favorite is their house fried rice.It's a very Americanized Chinese establishment. They have a pretty huge bar and I like their scorpion bowls. I like to go there during lunch since it's not too busy. Check it out for mediocre Chinese food; at least they have other options since the menu was pretty big."}, {"review_id": "eck1CMvy9h8VODH6JS-dFA", "user_id": "H9ZFxBToN995-02N5vW1tQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "11/30/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Upon a recent visit, service was nonexistent.

Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible but it just isn't what it used to be. I always have to check to-go orders for the correct items. The food is NEVER consistent. It's like they just whip together whatever is closest to the recipe that day. It's also way saltier than usual. Last night I found a hair in my fried rice... I get it, mistakes happen... and it's a first for me there. But it turned me off even more than I originally was. Not to mention I asked for sticky wing sauce on the side and they gave me a container with maybe a half ladle of sauce and charged $2 for it. I wasn't going to write an updated review but after reading my first one I realized I don't feel the same way anymore. I think it's time to take a break, Lemongrass"}, {"review_id": "D5dG1BbrRqOer2_JQo22Xg", "user_id": "xJvZAMZS4j7_WJr4rwq_Xw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Lemongrass is very close to my house. After last year when we moved here we had to try the all the local cuisine out. I absolutely love this place. It has great sushi, classic \"takeout\" food for my husband and few less known dishes are outstanding. The service has always been excellent. They don't hover or come over too often but they also don't check on you too few a times. The only thing I wish they did was delivery. Hahah. I highly recommend this for locals and visitors alike!"}, {"review_id": "jbdJHOeruH-YtkjTehaq_g", "user_id": "uMWdMHeZS8cSSLj_Si8Yqg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Great place for that Asian food fix that comes upon me, often. The sushi is good, lunch specials with the usual fried rice and soup choice.. but the best ever is the crispy fish. It only comes as an entree but it's well worth it. You'll eat almost all of it guaranteed. Try the Thai Iced Tea too.

Upon walking in, we were very impressed with the modern decor and all the color changing lights they had throughout the restaurant. We were seated promptly, and the service was great. I never would have known about this place had I not posted a forum on here asking who had the best Nime Chow in the area. We started with Nime Chow (which was excellent) & the Ocean State Sushi Roll (8 pcs. Alaskan king crab, avocado, cucumber inside, w/ pepper tuna outside & mango sauce).  For dinner, I decided on Shrimp Pad Thai (6 huge shrimp) and my husband had Spicy Shrimp w/ Lemongrass and Basil Fried Rice w/ Shrimp.  Everything was pretty good; however, we both felt the sushi was a bit of a challenge to keep from falling apart.  Also, during our visit tonight, we noticed they had signs posted stating as of 8/21/17 they will no longer be open on Mondays."}, {"review_id": "ba6_QWSIceq4oBoCChMTMw", "user_id": "QKJWf22yAbYLPi-cBI5LuQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Love coming here!

This most recent visit let me down some because I know how good it can be. The crispy wings lacked flavor and this is one of those items that keep me coming back. Sometimes they are encrusted with this salty goodness and this order seemed to lack seasoning. They were still good, but I was still a bit disappointed in them.I also got a wonton soup which is served with pea pods and green onion... both soooo delicious in that broth. Finally, I got the sizzling plate. It was so hot that I could hear it sizzling from across the restaurant. It was absolutely delicious however it was 80% onions and barely any meat. A bit of a let down since the proportions were so off. To wash it all down, we both got a Thai iced tea.. it took an exceptionally long time to get since she said they had to brew it fresh. It came with cream and simple syrup on the side which was unusual since normally it comes all mixed together for you. Once it was fixed to my liking it was delicious! Hit or miss on the level of deliciousness but compared to many others, this place keeps me coming back."}, {"review_id": "Ir5XB_2uUVPJeZ2x3yMYqg", "user_id": "rr5zzVWVu0u-P5P1rHIV-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Time to update this review! I last went in 2013, and I stopped by this time when in town for lunch, on a Saturday. I ordered the beef with peppers, and it came with onions and green and red peppers. The combination plate also comes with fried rice (lunch combos are available Mondays through Fridays only), but no soup. My cousin ordered a small hot and sour soup, though, along with some sushi, and the soup was huge! And also tasty (I tried a bit). The fried rice was very delicious, as was my meal. My mom got the chicken with lemongrass, and it was more of a Thai dish, and a bit too spicy for me, but also tasty. Service was quick and efficient, as well. My aunt lives 5 minutes, if that, from Lemongrass, so I'll probably be back in the future next time I'm in RI."}, {"review_id": "m3vDShqfIZhRHFLvRuVwrg", "user_id": "99uLxo57_duD6WyjwDZSlg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "The sushi here is really good.

So, the order was correct and ready fast.  I tried the avocado salad, miso soup, veggie roll, and veggie vietnamese roll.  Avo salad was just a bunch of sliced avo and some cucumber underneath.  The veggie roll was as expected, 6 pieces, pretty straight forward. The miso soup was super standard & fine but they didn't give me a spoon! The veggie vietnamese roll thing was good but i have had better. I order some version of this thing every chance I get... rice paper w/ yummy veggies inside--yes please.  Anyway this one was alright but really long on the noodles inside and light on the veggies. So, pretty meh.  and the sauce it came with was sort of weird. It was good, but not great. the fortune cookies were good!"}, {"review_id": "0NtMBWEosQfgOjR3Y7WnDw", "user_id": "2CR76yhW9lyZEBtfFfrULA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/3/2016", "text": "I love Lemongrass.

They are a little different from other Chinese restaurants because I find that they make a lot of their food fresh and per order - especially the fried rice. It is not a lump of rice with soy sauce like many others. They also dress their dishes beautifully with flowers and carved vegetables. Their Gen Tso chicken is so good, fried dumplings are scrumptious, crab rangoons are crispy with lots of filling and their spring rolls are tasty. I have also tried their soups - oh man! Large, full of flavor and tons of different items to choose from. They are huge! The drinks from the bar are really delicious and pack plenty of punch like they should. I have had to send only 1 item back and they immediately fixed it and made sure it was done correctly. I look forward to going back."}, {"review_id": "eyojRVfUf0MdRPymQAcqWw", "user_id": "OMVO93zxKypF2rnY7aHAEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/20/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I still love Lemongrass, and while I no longer live in the Warwick area, my husband and I continue to make the drive.
