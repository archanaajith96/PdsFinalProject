If you are from the southeastern Michigan area I am sure that you already know about and love Loui's. They have been a staple in the Hazel Park area for as long as I can remember and their food is delicious. If you are from a different area and close enough for the drive, I am sure you have plenty of good pizza nearby but it is definitely worth the drive. You will not be disappointed.If you love Antipasto salad, they have the best! Make sure you only order a small because it will feed two people easily. If you love the Hawaiian pizza, they have the best.  In case pizza is not your thing they have many other wonderful dishes. They are all huge. The Mostaccioli is fantastic and so was the spaghetti and meatballs.Enjoy"}, {"review_id": "V3fPs0mrCQk6uiy1B1ojNg", "user_id": "4XXjDyqBhiu0dA-ZPW4Cig", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Really good pizza! Deep dish style. Great service. First time here, the Waitress was attentive and helpful. Our food came out pretty quickly and definitely fresh. The crust on our pizza was really crispy which was amazing. Really enjoyed it. Also, you only get one free refill! Like seriously?? Which restaurant does that? Horrible. 2 main issues were- 1. The menu. The menu is really outdated. There's many things that aren't on the menu that luckily we saw other people order and we asked about it, or else we wouldn't of known. Example- Cheese bread or BBQ pizza. The bbq pizza, which they stickered onto the menu and only some menus. There were 3 menus already at our table, 2 of them didn't show the new pizza. So you can tell the menus were really old.  There's no appetizers on the menu but they do have some... We got the Italian cheese bread (which we saw a waiter walk by with) it was amazing! The place has a full bar and can make many drinks but they don't have drink menu or anything, except for a small section that states \"we make frozen drinks\" and the small table menu shows a few beers they got. Really wished the updated there menu with more details of what they had to offer. 2nd issue- the most annoying buzzer which you herd throughout the restaurant letting the waitresses know the next food order was up. It was rang 5-6 times! I am sure everyone herd the buzzer go off the first 3 times  and didn't need to be rang so many times. And it was every time an order was ready. So you can just tell how many times we herd it while eating."}, {"review_id": "l18eCMnFx0urgrsZEqB4yg", "user_id": "u9f_zYxIuQ_K1Jc-UN-QBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I just loved this place. Went for dinner with a friends, a party of 6. We were greeted and seated after only waiting for a few minutes. The place isn't fancy, but full of charm and hospitality. We had to order the Chianti bottle so we could decorate it and hang it on the wall. A very cool tradition they have that adds tons of character to the decor.For food we ordered the Antipasto Salad, Tortellini Soup, Meatballs, of course Pizza (Meat Lovers and a Bacon) and the bread basket. Every single thing we ordered was exceptional. The salad was fresh and loaded with salami, ham, mozzarella, tomatoes and delicious dressing. Meatballs were tender and light with a deep flavored sauce. The soup tasted like homemade broth with tender tortellini with perhaps chicken and ricotta inside. So good. The pizza, of course the pizza. Cheesy with crispy edges, tasty crust and drizzled with a sweet and zesty sauce. All the meats were a great addition to the pizza perfection. The bread basket is just sliced Italian bread (grandmother style), so note to self that it isn't anything fancy. Service was good, we had a very nice and attentive waitress and the owner was walking around checking on everyone throughout the meal. We'll be regulars at this place. I will be back soon to try some pasta. Can't wait."}, {"review_id": "xwXHzk7kirPcc4FXh7e61A", "user_id": "QngxwA3Oj6-YDwbyD93sHQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Isn't the easiest place to find because it looks like an old bowling alley which says lounge on the outside. But once you walk in it is heaven!! Cozy and rough which i like. Look around and wicker wine bottles are everyone hanging from the ceiling. Our waitress was awesome and was surprised when we ordered a pitcher of wine and beer. The place is noisy so having several drinks and getting vocal is ok ( I think).We order a large pizza with pepperoni on one side and pineapple on the other. Took a bit to come out but once it did it made my bad week disappear. Perfect amount of cheese and topping and the sauce was to die for. And those signature cheesy burnt crust was the best I have ever had.  I ate my whole half with no problem because it was so amazing. After crying that my food was gone our waitress gave us a bucket of markers to draw on our wicker wine bottle to hang up. Honestly the experience was amazing!!! We will be back many many times.

You can feel it when you walk inside: The wooden walls are covered with decorations; Chianti bottles are hanging from the ceiling, with messages on the bottles written directly by patrons. (I wondered how long the bottles had been a fixture of the place, and when I told my dad I ate there, the first thing he asked was if the Chianti bottles were still a thing. They must still be hanging them, too, because next to our table was a bottle with \"BERNIE 2016\" written on it.)When you get past the nostalgia, you dig into the food -- and by food, I mean pizza. GET THE PIZZA. First, I'd start off with the antipasto salad, whose dressing in my opinion beats my other favorite antipasto from Jet's. A small salad is big enough for 3-4 people.Then, dive into the pizza. A large is 8 slices of pretty good sized dough, lathered in sauce and any toppings you desire. After some salad and two slices, most people would probably be full. I squeezed in a third slice because when in Rome... and then I had the last slice for lunch the next day.Prices aren't too bad and the servers are kind. It's hard to find that old school ambiance anymore in this day and age, so I hope this place stays open forever and never changes. That's the charm after all."}, {"review_id": "t4UmAwkv09nRuBlaS66ZQA", "user_id": "rPW-xXQZqGuHtg2cEeD64Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "This place exceeded our expectations. Everything was fresh and authentic from the antipasto salad with house dressing to the tomato sauce on the deep dish pizza. The pizza offered a perfectly crisp bottom with the right amount of sauce and all the cheese. We also really enjoyed the garlic cheese bread. Between the two of us, we shared an individual salad, a small pizza, and small order of bread. Not only did we leave full, we left with plenty of leftovers. Our server was great and shared our excitement for our first visit.

My group and I ended up going that route and it was a lot of fine. Definitely get the Greek salad and cheesy bread sticks to start the meal. Any of the pizza selections were great we made our own.

I actually ran into a buzzfeed video and saw that Loui's was a top recommendation! After doing some research, we went on a cold, snowy day and it was still open!We started off with the salad because it was recommended, however, I didn't think it was that great. A little too much meat and cheese in the salad for my taste. We ordered a large pizza with peppers and onions and it was so delicious! The pizza crust was amazing, especially the corner pieces. You can really taste the carmelization from the specific pans they use. The pizza has a nice thick crust, with an overload of gooey cheese. They have a base layer of cheese, then also have mozzarella? Cube cheeses included. I thought they could have used a little more sauce since I like saucy pizza but honestly that wasn't even worth complaining about. Definitely a champ in its own category of Detroit style pizza!"}, {"review_id": "hV8BTiyWltlFVL3JctFlig", "user_id": "QvF97KE8W7vOEUbu6VtGqA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/19/2018", "text": "So I'm really not sure why I've never been here.

This was by far the best pizza I have had in the area or quite possibly ever. The service was great and I loved the vibe of the restaurant. It was busy, family oriented, and had a homey-dive feel to it. First we ordered a small antipasto salad to share. Definitely enough salad for two. The salad was fresh and the dressing was delicious. Then we ordered the large pizza with pepperoni, green pepper, and mushroom. The crust is what really set apart this pizza from other pizza I have had. It's crisp and buttery with a cheese flavor baked into the crust. The pizza was the perfect amount of thickness. I can't wait to go back!

Piping hot 'Detroit Style' (actually East Side style because I never saw it growing up on the west side of Detroit), crusty, cheesy, square pizza. With homemade dough and sauce and tons of melty mozzerella cheese. Pepperonis that turn into cups of deliciousness. Only one annoying TV (I hate TVs in restaurants!) but it's a small one and the sound was low or off. Chianti bottles, signed by cutomers, line the mirrored walls. It was holiday time, so there were a million lights strung on them, reflecting infinitely.The homemade chicken broth soup with handmade beef filled tortellini seemed to last and last.
