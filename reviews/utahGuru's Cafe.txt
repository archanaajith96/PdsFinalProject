Although, the nachos are seriously lacking beans, who's are listed in the ingredients, but there's only like ten single beans. 3 times I've been given the wrong food to go so I didn't know until it was too late. I don't know how they get it wrong so often when they are entering it into a computer? The guy repeats it and everything. And for the prices I'm paying it is pretty disappointing to get the wrong thing."}, {"review_id": "c43zjE3Egz99xycI0H0BUg", "user_id": "9-pcVBvRxeaMs6rLDOTh-Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "Okay I'm not exaggerating when I say this place has amazing potato fries. Like if I could marry fries... these would be the fries I'd hitch myself too forever and ever.Their servings on fries is also what makes this place GREAT! I mean the half size is plenty for two people...but I wouldn't share them. ALL MINE *que evil laughter*I also really like the options available and that breakfast foods are served all day. (breakfast food is the best)\\What I've tried here is the curry quesadilla, the nachos, and friesCurry Quesadilla - really good it contains tons of veggies and cheesy goodness. I would highly recommend it. It tastes like summer.The nachos- HUGE portions. I loved the chips and plenty of queso (I only wish they would distribute the toppings throughout the nacho rather than just on top)Sweet potato fries - BUY THEM"}, {"review_id": "rfqkRB9zrImTBG66nLeIkA", "user_id": "3gH0H0YALxx3f7JAAgsYXQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "Guru's has a fairly extensive menu and they seem to do a great job with all of it. My girlfriend ordered a pasta--delicious. We shared sweet potato fries--yummy! I got a chicken quesadilla--also fantastic! Another positive thing is the portion sizes. They are huge and a great value for the money. Two people could easily share a full-size pasta and a half-size is almost too much for one. The neighboring table had sandwiches and I don't think anyone finished. Service was great and very friendly. I ran into a bit of an issue when I tried to redeem the Yelp Check-in offer. The server at the bakery didn't seem to know anything about a free cookie and when he asked a manager the report was simple \"We're out.\" Other than the cookie, I'd suggest they improve the ordering process a bit. You order at the counter but the menus are traditional bound restaurant menus so you have to procure a menu and then decide quickly all while trying to stay in line/let people ahead who know their order and it's just a bit messy. But...I'd still come back probably. The food was good.

I really like the decor; it's fresh and it feels welcoming. I also like you can see into their open kitchen. They have good menu choices without feeling they have too much variety. I ended up doing a steak wrap with their Sweet potato fries. Everything tasted fresh and very good. My co-workers, who got salads and other wraps all really liked their choices too.

They do not use any deep fried foods that I know of which makes it a great option when you don't want to be weighed down after lunch.The only \"complaint\" I have for Guru's is the system they have for ordering is slightly chaotic. They have 2 registers where their employees are very nice and friendly, however the line is not organized. It slightly snakes around tables and they only have a handful of menus that are passed around before you order. Yes, they have screens instead of menus above the register, yet they don't display the menu on it. They have a sequence of pictures that cycle through of food and events, but less than 10% of their menu is shown without the price.Other than me being picky about that, I have yet to order something I did not like. I went to school around the block from here and went a few times a week. So I do feel justified and confident their menu is superb. The sweet potato fries are the fan favorite, rightfully so. My personal favorite is the black and blue wrap or the chicken quesadilla. They use whole chicken breasts cubed on the quesadilla and its fantastic.Overall, solid choice for a healthy lunch and they are gluten free!"}, {"review_id": "SGH09V45T27AS67VlazKgA", "user_id": "HGrhjUIho7TFtA7axxlKXw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "I wont come back to this place again.

They're thin, crispy, and super addicting. The food is good, but nothing you'll write home, or rave about. Their ordering experience is different, which is a nice way to shake things up. You'll stand in line, and order like a deli, but they offer a lot of non deli selections. It's casual, and has a great ambiance.Here's what they could work on: Speed. I don't expect fast food, but the line can take sooo long! After waiting for 10+ minutes (with only a few people in front of you, you'll wait about the same or more for your food.

It seems like they drastically changed it over the last year and not in a good way.Their sweet potato fries used to be ultra seasoned with all sorts of flavor and their unique fry sauce was just the bonus. The last two times the fries were undercooked and under seasoned. Perhaps it depends on who is making them? Or perhaps they are trying to make them more healthy? They still have a couple of good dishes but the formerly legendary fries were the major draw for me and those glory days seem to have disappeared forever."}, {"review_id": "yoF3o-R2lZfMzYu7C5GaVQ", "user_id": "unlFWRc-laZeTB4Vqr2QKA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "I love Guru's!
