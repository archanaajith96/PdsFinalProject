I was in Seattle this past week for work and a friend of mine recommended we go here for dinner. I'm so happy she did because I loved everything about this place.  We went on a Thursday after happy hour and as to be expected, there was about a 20 minute wait. The expected wait time was spot on and we got a text when our table was ready. As I walked in I couldn't help but be mesmerized by the ambience of this place. It's antiquated yet hipster feeling and - kid you not - has trapeze ropes hanging from the ceiling. The decorations inside are a site themselves.Onto the more important stuff... the food and drinks were simply outstanding. There's an impressive wine and beer menu but they also offer superbly crafted seasonal cocktails. I was very happy with my vodka spritzer and side car choices (here, mixing alcohol isn't a bad idea). The freshly baked bread and artisanal olive oil was addicting as hell, but I still ate every last bite of my entree - one that must be a house specialty - their clams and linguine. They do a unique twist on this by adding what I believe is prosciutto. The whole dish has a nice spicy finish that perfectly complements the obviously fresh shellfish that I absolutely can never say no to when visiting the West Coast. The salad and \"boobie cake\" (chocolate ganache with a raspberry on top ) that I had were delectable as well, all in all making this one incredible meal. Everything else on the menu looked amazing too. I can't wait to visit Seattle again and will probably succumb to my creature of habit ways because it will be hard to try something new with The Pink Door in vicinity!"}, {"review_id": "neibEcBRcWFWIkLyu74xyQ", "user_id": "5fuKJGv-jHqbabzrH0Mxhw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "After having some less than stellar food while in Seattle, I was dying to try this place because of all the positive reviews. I made a reservation for lunch on Monday (5/7/18) after not being able to get one for dinner. I was surprised to walk upon the restaurant and find no signage outside. I'm shocked anyone can ever find the place. We were seated outside, which would've been nice had our table not been completely in the sun with no shade; an umbrella would've been nice at that time of day . I ordered the pappardelle with bolognese sauce, as recommended by my waitress. It was a little overpriced just for pasta and sauce, and it wasn't a very large portion, but it was excellent so I can forgive that. We also ordered spaghetti with marinara sauce (no meatballs), and the spaghetti was just a bit undercooked. I noticed other tables with a bread basket, but we were never given any bread. Maybe they were charged for it? I'm not sure, but I'm used to getting complimentary bread in Italian restaurants. Overall, I loved my pasta, but the spaghetti was just ok. I do think it's worth trying out if you're visiting Seattle."}, {"review_id": "OlqBAXFBn_-ypLYx0J9kYQ", "user_id": "ZR-nqJJESbxYsEdn49MiOQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/8/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. I'm so sad and upset that I even have to write this review. After having one of the best meals of my life, I returned here for my 10 year anniversary with my boyfriend, who actually ended up proposing to me the same day which made the dinner even more special. If I wanted to be nit-picky, I'd say the bartender was kind of rude to us when we asked if we could order drinks while waiting for our table. Everything was going great at first until we ordered our second round of drinks halfway through our meal (Tito's martini extra extra extra dirty) where the waiter repeated our drink order back to us and then walked away mid sentence, we finished our meal and followed up on the drinks where the waiter told us that he decided to slow down our service, we had probably at this point been waiting to over 20 mins for our drinks. At no time did he ever say to us that he wasn't going to put our drinks in and had no reason or explanation as to why he decided not to after taking our order. We spoke with the owner and she said that \"our policy is very conservative and we don't know what you had before coming here and a martini is 2 drinks so you were ordering 4 drinks\". I can understand if that is their policy in regards to their alcohol consumption as my family owns a restaurant and I've waited tables and bartended for many years but again neither of us were drunk and we had ubered to the restaurant. Secondly, it'd be different if we were only drinking but we were there for almost 2 hours and ate $80+ worth of food. Thirdly, that's also something he should have said to us when we originally ordered our drinks, that conversation should have been had then and there. Fourthly, if you feel that 2 martinis is an excessive amount of alcohol for someone to be consuming, you probably shouldn't be serving them to begin with. I'm honestly all around just disgusted with how we were treated and they ruined something that was supposed to be such a special day/night and dinner. I'm disappointed with the service, lack of communication, and the way it was handled. I'll always remember that my 10 year anniversary and engagement dinner was ruined by the Pink Door. Needless to say, I spent the rest of the night in tears, my fiancé spent it frustrated in our hotel room (when we should have been continuing our night and celebrating) Also if you're wondering why they have almost no negative reviews - it's because all the one star reviews go to the \"not recommended\" reviews for some reason."}, {"review_id": "WkOIgpWDR4e-6KplFAYB_Q", "user_id": "-m8nSwgfmQzsctaZ2lVhrA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I was in Seattle on business, lo and behold, on Restaurant Week of all times of the year!  It didn't take long for someone to recommend The Pink Door, followed immediately by \"but good luck getting a reservation\".  Sadly, they weren't kidding -- when we called, their first opening was well over a week out.   While we almost gave up, we found ourselves at Pike's Place Market late one night mid-week and decided to swing by and see if they could squeeze us in....and, SERENDIPITY, we got in!  Sadly, it wasn't a night where they had the trapeze show, but that just gives me yet another reason to go back.  Word to the wise, The Pink Door is NOT easy to find; the entrance through the alley we essentially found by accident. Restaurant Week is a miracle to behold -- a 3 course dinner for $33 for high-end food is miraculous!  And at a place with the reputation, quality, and spectacle as The Pink Door, it didn't disappoint!  I got the Celery & Pear Bisque, The Lasagna Pink Door, and the Apple Cake w/ Caramel Sauce.  The bisque was one of the most interesting dishes that I have ever tasted, before or since.  The combination of sweetness, crispness, and richness was amazing!  And holy lord -- I am one of the biggest carnivores that you will ever meet, and the vegetarian Lasagna Pink Door (fresh spinach pasta layered with besciamella, pesto and topped with marinara sauce) was extraordinary!  I was legitimately sad when it was gone, and I didn't miss the meat at all.  The Apple Cake was good, but was a little dry.  I found myself wishing that it came a la mode, but no such luck.I am conflicted, but my main detractor from 5 Stars is the very same reason that I can even write this review in the first place:  they basically pulled a two-person table out from a 4-top and shoehorned us in between two other tables.  Needless to say, not exactly spacious or comfortable, but hey, they got us in.  The Pink Door's reputation is well-deserved; highly recommend!"}, {"review_id": "8En7d8g6jE08lrR7Fp5B3g", "user_id": "B35JKW8Mrk11S0Y1XEcZOg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "I made an easy lunch reservation a day before for Pink Door  after finding out that they were reservations only.

Lasagna isn't something I usually order, but after reading the countless reviews outlining how delicious it was, and less reviews for my normal go to Linguine alle Vongole... (though funny enough, a few of the newer more recent reviews talk about how perfect it was.. ah well, the lasagna was probably just meant to be! :)) I'm usually a lot more health conscious and would never go for lasagna being as it is usually very greasy and rich, but seeing it was my last full day in Seattle, I said, why not? I'm so glad I decided to try it out. I also ordered a plate of the Brussel sprouts to get some greens, and it was pretty delicious as well. I ate it quickly, but the star was the lasagna.The atmosphere of the place is a bit hidden, where, if you're walking on Post Alley, you'll notice a pink door and when you open it, it opens up to the restaurant where then you'll walk down a set of stairs and marvel at the interesting decor of the place. They have entertainers there it seems on weeknights which is certainly unique. The paintings on the wall and the light decorations are memorable.Other dishes ordered was the seared ahi (I think?) that was a special of the day, but apparently it was disappointing (not bad, just not as memorable as say, my lasagna), and the cheese board deluxe which apparently did hit all the right notes with a huge cracker laid on top.The server was extremely helpful and patient as well as quick. Everything was great. Only reason for the 4 stars was I feel like the prices are a bit overpriced, but overall it was a great experience for a mid late afternoon lunch.

I asked him for his recommendations for pasta dishes and he said that the bolognese, lasagna, and risotto is what they're know for. I've had bolognese at a lot of different restaurants recently and risotto sounded a bit heavy and so I went with the lasagna. IT WAS BOMB. Seriously can't go wrong with it. Trust me. I usually expect meat in my lasagna, but it did not disappoint! The creamy cheese layered between beautifully cooked spinach wavy noodles, smothered in a comforting red sauce. Every bite was perfect. SAVE THE COMPLIMENTARY BREAD FOR THIS; you're going to want to dip it in the rich saucy goodness. ;)We also ordered a lighter pasta, the clam linguine. I really loved this dish! The clams were cooked perfectly and the sauce was buttery in a light, yet comforting way. Pretty good sized chunks of pancetta cleverly sprinkled throughout the pasta added another dimension to the pasta. I think I found my favorite Italian restaurant!

It starts from the minute you enter via the pink door in the alley. You walk down a small flight of stairs to the hostess station where you hopefully have a reservation but if not, no worries, a seat at the bar will open up eventually. We got seats at the bar after a fifteen minute wait on a weeknight. Not bad. The whole place is lit by candlelight and lamps turned down low, bathing everything in a cozy, intimate pink glow. There was an excellent jazz/cabaret band playing right next to the bar.Let's get to the food. It's really good. I had the lasagna and the boyfriend had rigatoni with bolognese sauce. It was so good he told our bartender and server that he doesn't usually like Italian restaurant food but he loved dinner and pretty much cleaned his plate. Both tasted hearty, homey, and the sauce had definitely simmered for hours on the stove. We had some fun cocktails here, too. The flavors were nice and clean and the bartenders were willing to get a little crazy and indulge us - I'm pretty sure I asked her to make something with St. Germaine and tequila - it was great.Overall, The Pink Door feels a little magical and otherworldly.

We also were able to catch the last aerial show of the evening, which was nice.We wanted to start with some bread so we ordered the La Fettunta as a starter. It wasn't bad, but we saw other tables get bread before their meals came out, so I think they give some complimentary. That would've been nice to know before we ordered the bread, lol.I ordered the Linguine Alle Vongole. There were a lot of clams and the pieces of pancetta went really well with the dish. The pasta was also cooked perfectly. Definitely recommend getting this dish!The bf ordered the Cioppino Pink Door. There was a lot of seafood and the broth was full of flavor. As much as I enjoyed my entree, I wish I ordered his, lol. We dipped the bread in the broth and finished everything. Must order!For drinks I had a red sangria and the bf ordered the ginger beer.

When we came back, there was a sign on the door that they were no longer taking reservations as their list was full, so we had walked in just in time. We saw lots of people turning away, which indicated just how popular this place is. The restaurant is dark and lit with warm lights and candles, which makes for a great date night. There is entertainment also, with a dancer that does a show in the middle of the restaurant- fantastic! And FYI, photography is banned of the performance so just sit back and enjoy!Complimentary bread is brought to the table, with great olive oil to dip with. We ordered the Mafalda con sugo di coniglio and Linguine alle Vongole. Both dishes were fantastic. They were seasoned just right and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.

To be honest, I never really wanted to come here because I'm not a big fan of Italian restaurants. Some might not agree with me, but I just think that pasta is pasta. There's not much variation and only the original dishes are extremely better than any fusion thing you can do.Anyways, to the review! We originally wanted to book a reservation at 6pm on Sunday, but quickly found out we couldn't because they had a show so we decided to book the next closest time which was 4:30pm. We were greeted coming down the stairs onto the main level, and the hostess walked us over to our table. This is where it got a little uncomfortable for us. I asked the hostess what's good here, and she gave me the usual answer at first, \"Everything.\" So then I asked her what she would choose if she was picking something for dinner, and she said the lasagna because it's been around for years and it's one of the dishes that made them popular. Then our waiter comes over and basically rudely interrupts and basically pushes her away and says \"And I'll take it from here because I'll take care of you. I have better recommendations for your meal tonight.\" The first word that came through my head was, \"WTF?\" Ok, maybe not a word but it is three letters. Anyways, he then recommends the seasonal stuff since it's not available all the time, and of course his favorite dish and the one he highly recommended was the dish with the letters MKP on it. After that I decided not to go with any of his recommendations and stuck with what the hostess recommended and go the lasagna. My other two friends decided to try the \"seasonal\" stuff he recommended and I can tell you right now, GET THE LASAGNA. It's the BOMB for how simple it is and I know why the hostess decided to tell me that's her go-to dish. Our hostess was real nice and gave me the perfect recommendation, and the food was soso, so I would normally give 4 stars. If it wasn't for that I would have given them a 1 star because of how bad the waiter was. He was extremely bossy and condescending and rude. And I know it wasn't just to us because a girl at the table behind us got the same treatment because he questioned her food choice and she flat out said, \"I think I know what I want.\" Pink Door is a great place for tourists for an Italian Seattle style meal. You'll get some quirkiness with the decor and can find it a little adventurous, but in the end it's just plain Italian food to me. Make sure to make reservations because they do get packed around 6pm on the weekends or come early to get a spot."}, {"review_id": "oQSEjk5vJAnQlNaS9dtMIQ", "user_id": "V-jiTqYCFl0Tdxg8cmx1NQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Popped in this unassuming spot down Post Alley as my first restaurant to try in Seattle and, in short, it was fantastic.

Like, I have memories of what I wrote in this review. AND IT DOES NOT EXIST. I repeat--I never wrote a review. I'm shook. So, I guess now I need to remedy this, considering I loved my lunch at The Pink Door! I think my man and I approached this visit in the best way possible. We chose to try The Pink Door for a Saturday lunch date! We skipped the crowds a chaos of a weekend night out. Instead we were seated right away and basked in the sunlight at a gorgeous table facing the water. It was the perfect way to first experience this iconic Seattle spot. As far as our lunch went, we treated it like dinner. Haha. That's right! Drinks and appetizers were needed. And I was just kicking myself trying to remember what cocktail I had to drink. But I honestly think I stuck with sparkling wine of some kind. My man, on the other hand, ordered some kind of refreshing cocktail that I definitely can't remember. However, it didn't last long and I remember hearing all about how great it was. We started with the piatto di prosciutto, which translated to a big ass plate of prosciutto. Yaaaassss Queen! We smashed this appetizer (not the actual plate, but all the foodz) as we waited for our main courses. When my main course arrived I was so damn excited. It took me a while to choose, but I finally decided on the pappardelle al ragu bolognese. And holy moly am I glad I did. First of all, pappardelle is one of my favorite pastas. There is just something about how the sauce clings--like it's made to hold the perfect amount. And this dish was no different. The pasta itself tasted fresh and perfectly cooked. The sauce was somehow light and rich at the same damn time. The meat was tender and the flavors in the sauce were perfectly balanced, allowing the pasta itself to shine. My man got the risotto, which I believe might change on a regular basis. It was also delicious, but my pasta was the star of the show. On top of all this delicious food, our service was quite nice. There wasn't anything that stood out as over-the-top-amazing about it. But since it wasn't their weekend dinner rush, the service was thoughtful and calm. I can't wait to come back and tackle more of this menu, you guys. I'm not sure if I'll ever venture in on a weekend evening. But don't be surprised if you see me there for lunch. Oh!

The prosciutto is served cold along with a soft cheese that tasted like fresh mozzarella but softer and creamier.  This is excellent on top of the complimentary bread basket.Mama's meatballs:  These were good and you can tell that they are made using premium fresh ingredients.  However, I didn't think they were worth the $12 price.  I'm not a big meat eater so I could have skipped it.Carrot flan:  The name of this dish isn't carrot flan- it's a carrot-something-in-French.  The waitress explained to us that this dish is shaped like a carrot flan but it's savory.  The carrot is purreed and mixed in with some sort of cheese (ricotta?) and served with a green pesto sauce.  This dish was amazing!  It sounds super weird but the sweet and savory carrot flavor paired so well with the creamy ricotta.  I think this was my favorite dish of the night.  Highly recommended.Truffle risotto:  This is the dish that made me fall in love with The Pink Door.  It's so creamy and flavorful yet not too filling.  It is served with a raw egg that you mix into the dish.  The truffle flavor is mild but you occasionally come across real shavings of truffle in the dish.  The plate may look small but be warned that you will not be able to finish it by yourself.  You'll definitely want to split it with someone.Overall, I loved returning to The Pink Door and I can't wait to come back again.  It's definitely one of my favorite places to visit while I'm in the Seattle."}, {"review_id": "6sxdoErE40DPpwpd3uYOtQ", "user_id": "EKypdddvMmFaGamfzXKbEA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "No Columbia and REI gear in here!
