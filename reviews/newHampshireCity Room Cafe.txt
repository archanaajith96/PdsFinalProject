Bright, charming, and warm atmosphere. I had come in on a Friday, and there are a group of regulars that come in. They provided an entertaining conversation. If you want to know the latest gossip in town, this seems to be the place to find it.The server was very sweet, genuine, attentive, and was chatty with all the regular patrons. It was nice to observe. To be honest, I had only really seen that kind of interaction at one other place, and that was a little hole-in-the wall diner back home in Lynn (Little River Inn). It warmed the heart, reminding of childhood memories eating here.Standard breakfast fare available with a lunch menu. But something I don't see a whole lot of? Crêpes! What you think I'm gonna get? The veggie crêpe with a side of hash was the perfect portion, reasonably priced. Coffee was also very good."}, {"review_id": "KlWp69Wc3c6gbQ9kNPXngA", "user_id": "7emzDbpCnwltrO9AG-g68A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Friendly staff with a friendly environment.  Food is aways good try the omlettes are good along with kielbasa."}, {"review_id": "1j1s3qSjAIcgdUH9LDKJRQ", "user_id": "QbYWNN1icDS1qS-D43JbZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/7/2017", "text": "Such a cute cafe.

There is a wait, so be prepared for that. Lucky for us, the wait wasn't long for two!Food: Fresh Fruit Crepes- Light and sweet with blueberries, strawberries and bananas. So satisfying! Irish Benedict- Eggs, corned beef, on an english muffin. And the cheese, it was a little on the flavorless side but together with everything, it wasn't bad. Both served with home fries which was well-seasoned and fantastic.Overall Service: Friendly and attentive!"}, {"review_id": "DrcjCXck2J4fdF-80dCpEA", "user_id": "PckAOuqKWnIB4HbztMUOeQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/30/2017", "text": "This is one of our \" go to....\" places for breakfast in the Nashua area. Most of the customers are locals or locals entertaining out-of-town guests. It's small and sometimes requires a wait to get seated. Once seated the service and food are very good. It is worth checking out the specials board for interesting dishes. This place serves traditional New England breakfast fare such as eggs your way, bacon, sausage, pancakes, muffins, waffles. hash browns, etc. We have never had a bad breakfast there.

The waitstaff was friendly and inviting; and the setting was almost that of an intimate café in some far off country. The food was delicious, if not a bit small. Also the inability to get refills on certain things was a tad annoying. Considering the location it is understandable that there is little to no parking, but this might deter people from going at all."}, {"review_id": "IyVHL5MzPM9KbSeUmwWyrQ", "user_id": "7eMBSqSM5rJMvXeOkfbkog", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "So far is my favorite place to go out for breakfast . Their food is not greasy and it feels good after you eat it. Their plates are perfect  portion. The pancakes make sure you order maple syrup it's an extra minimal charge. Want a great omelette?  This is your place you can also create your own. I have invited around 10 people there and they loved the food. It's cozy and you feel you are at home. Better than some of the ones that are always crowded .  Their food I have always enjoyed just wish they were open for dinner because their food is really delicious. Go and Enjoy a great breakfast for the best price around."}, {"review_id": "dKYV0WXmt2MlpheLvghaaQ", "user_id": "gM9BiBJUnyboTpUcbY8qkw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2017", "text": "Saw this restaurant/diner on Yelp and it sounded very good.  Decided to go and we found that the good reviews didn't do it justice.  It's located in downtown Nashua, just off Main St.  While the restaurant is small in size, the aesthetic is very appealing - wood and brick throughout, with paintings and industrial artwork on the walls.  Very comfortable atmosphere.We were greeted by our server, Rebecca, who immediately made us feel welcome.  She was not the type who was over-the-top fake friendly.  She actually made us feel like her friends.  One of the best servers we've had anywhere.  We talked to her quite a bit in between taking care of her other customers.  Kudos, Rebecca, on a fabulous job!  We'll be sure to look for you next time.The coffee was good, not bitter like some of the cheap coffee some diners throw at you.  And when the food came out, we loved it.  I had the Reuben omelette.  It was well cooked, had good flavor and I've not seen it on a menu elsewhere.  My girlfriend had the Irish Benedict, which she said was one of the best she's had anywhere.  Very good portions and at a good price.  There were a lot of other menu items that looked good as well.  It was hard to decide.  Since we were there for breakfast, we only looked really at that part of the menu.  Had some traditional offerings, but also some stuff you don't see everywhere, hence why I went with the Reuben.We will most definitely be going back.  When we were finishing it up, we both said how nice it is to find a gem when we're just looking for a good place to eat.  Funny how we were thinking the same thing at the same time.  But we both clearly felt that a gem is what we've found here.  Takeaways from this reviewer: Go try this place out.  Good food, good price, great server.  We think you'll be happy you tried it out."}, {"review_id": "RjcZDVFT7F_jn2Kry-cl-w", "user_id": "54P0vkHVjGLP9EbzjbBJmw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/13/2017", "text": "I would definitely recommend this place the food is good and the service is even better.

We went in during the weekday lunch time and decided on breakfast. The breakfast was nice. We ordered 2 eggs for each person, with bacon, home fries, and toast on the side, and it arrived just like that, so it's hard to say we were jipped on portion sizes when we ordered a specific number of eggs. I just wished for more bacon and home fries than I got and that's not something we specified the number of.The place could be a nice romantic spot or quiet spot for people to eat, but it is small, so not ideal for large groups. Street parking was metered, so bring coins. There was local at for sales on the wall, along with family portraits. All of this makes for a hidden treat to escape the Main Street hustle and bustle on a side road in downtown Nashua.

City Room Cafe is definitely one of those hidden gems!  On a chilly St Patrick's Day morning my boyfriend and I found ourselves craving a good breakfast in a comfortable environment.  Rather than go to the diners were more familiar with we searched yelp for something new and found City Room Cafe which was only about a 5 minute drive from our house.We headed on over and found the City Room Cafe tucked away on a little side street downtown.  We were disappointed to find that parking for the restaurant was less than ideal.  There is the option of metered street parking (lined with snow banks in the winter) or a parking garage about a block or so away.  Luckily I was able to dig up some quarters and we snagged a spot just a few doors down from the cafe.  I'm happy to report the parking was the one and only downside to our entire experience.Entering the restaurant we were instantly greeted with a cheery hello and a warm and inviting atmosphere.  Brick walls, bright but not glaring lighting, wood floors and artwork for sale by local artists combine together to make it feel extremely welcoming and relaxing.I ordered decaf coffee (for once it didn't taste watered down!) and my boyfriend had regular.  Both of us were delighted to find the coffee not bitter and it was strong but not so much so that you felt like your hair would fall out or something because of it.  I got the Irish Benedict and my boyfriend got one of the specials, a Rueben Omelette.  When our food came I tentatively went to break the yoke on one of my eggs and I prepared to be disappointed as usual that one of my poached eggs was going to be overdone.  However, the yoke broke and ran right down the sides like it should have and I happily began to devour one of the most delicious Irish Benedicts (and breakfasts) I've ever had.  I also sampled my boyfriend's omelette and was pleased to find it almost equally as good.  We also both agreed that the home fries were the best we've had of all the diners we've tried in the area as for once they weren't undercooked, greasy and they actually had seasoning on them!Lastly, our waitress, Rebecca, was a total doll!  Funny, personable, accommodating and chatty but not so much so that you were silently wishing her to leave so you could actually have a conversation with the person you were with.  If anything, we probably kept her talking with our incessant questions about various things but she was extremely gracious and patient.  She even took the time to ask our names so she could try to rememberd us in the future.  A nice gesture that seemed very genuine and sincere as we observed her greeting several patrons by their names when they came in to eat.All in all, it was one of the most pleasant dining experiences my boyfriend and I have had since moving to Nashua.  It isn't fancy but it also isn't your typical greasy diner.  We can't wait to go back when it's warmer and outdoor seating is available."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/city-room-cafe-nashua?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
