Usually, my bf is a meat eater, I have been on/off eating meat, but he said to me, \"If the food tastes like this all the time then I think I could go vegan.\" Enough said!

Thanks, Yelpers, for recommending Shandal's so highly. Not an ounce of disappointment in the quality and taste of this home-cooked island-tinged vegan fare. We each got \"small\" plates which meant 4 dense, heaping ladlesful of our selections. There's just no going wrong here at Shandal's. Though it's a humble exterior and it's not an elegant dine-in experience (there are 2 cozy tables for 2 but mostly a takeout), it's not to be missed."}, {"review_id": "B__BNpWrURdTJv4v8pIatw", "user_id": "kbdAw33jsvr9VA9W_0X1Mg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "We came to visit from New York City.

Wow was it delishes. I'm not vegan but I was out running errands in Bridgeport and decided to check it out Found it on my Bazing app then read the reviews and boy were they right on. The flavors are amazing. The vegetables were fresh and colorful. The tofu and veggie chicken were fantastic. I bought the $10 take out which gives you large serving spoonfuls of 6 different dishes. He has an $8 which gives you 4 choices. There were a lot of different dishes to chose from. Since I had never been there before Shandal explained the dishes to me. I picked one dish and let him pick out the rest. He is a really nice and soft spoken guy and he cooks everything himself. I had more than enough for lunch and dinner. I will definitely return sooner than later."}, {"review_id": "ct0Ct4dr-JLj2kLvEBvrEQ", "user_id": "YcS2AMsD6j0uOPnrc-sX8g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/22/2017", "text": "Shandal is now my favorite vegetarian spot; or shall I say vegan as the charming owner told me. This is a small take out with 2 tables. As you enter please  spend few second to look at the color of the walls and you will  immediatelly get transported to the magic world of the Antilles and its unique food flavors. The spicy faves are amazing.  If you are a meat lover and you need constant stimulation of your umumi receptors you won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "n1rND5EdnQO-yxoQ2vzxtw", "user_id": "6yl3qti2FQMGhVzefA8ZDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/5/2017", "text": "Delicious, healthy Ital food. Couldn't replicate it even if I tried! Shandal was very kind, and offered an explanation of the offerings that day. Note that everything is actually vegan, not vegetarian.Between three of us, we ordered a few of the four portioned meals (you can choose from four or six/small or large), and mix and matched a bean purée, tofu stews and barbecues, pastas, vegetable stew, plantain, and more. The spicy dish that afternoon was potato. My only wishes were for more spicy dishes and for the platters to be eco-conscious as well (they were served in styrofoam containers, even for meals to stay).All was delicious, and we left full but light on our toes--not weighed down. Shandal's is a must!"}, {"review_id": "a3oQfE7Vzzu99ML1y9-5aQ", "user_id": "yLiJjO6CyCFDR2SKIIvH4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "Shandal's food is a must have! On my way to Waterbury from NJ I typed in vegan restaurants and was directed to this gem. Upon entering I was greeted by Shandal. The hospitality was heart warming and reminded me of how my grandma would treat our guest. There were a lot of options from curry, to rice and peas, to rasta pasta. I asked about popular options and he said he couldn't name any as each of his customers have different go to's. I selected 4 dishes and sat in my car to taste. Let me just say I walked back in and placed another order so that I could have for later. Shandal's food is comfort food. The restaurant is small and doesn't offer much seating however the food is worth the visit."}, {"review_id": "MKgL6vrPLHYngCeuLD8nEw", "user_id": "DUZoffTfpi3msKLQBs0Zjg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/20/2017", "text": "Love the food, service and hospitality.

Very easy to find with many options and the owner/cook provided good pleasant service. They offer 4 items for $8 or 6 items for $10. Since it was my first time I decided to try 6 items : lima beans, bbq tofu, rasta pasta, stewed tofu, and two others I can't remember. The food tasted okay. The tastiest dish was the bbq tofu. The others were lacking something I can't really put my finger on. Ater having so many great options in the Washington, DC metro area, in my opinion it didn't really live up to that standard. It's okay if you live in the area and want to eat out vegan."}, {"review_id": "tooK8YTKm2DFjjbMURQ_bA", "user_id": "bCUXFROe47-XnoLTj_nXaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/19/2017", "text": "Great food.
