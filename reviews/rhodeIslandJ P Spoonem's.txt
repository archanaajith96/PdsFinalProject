This is definitely their specialty, so if you're going to try anything, try one of those.I got the Pesto Benny - poached eggs atop Italien toast, pesto sauce and parmesan cheese. Every part of this was delicious. The toast was nice and thick, the cheese was high quality (not that shakey cheese you buy at the store) and there was a generous serving of hollandaise sauce to top it all off. Came with a ton of home fries and a small cup of sliced watermelon. Is this the healthiest breakfast in the world? No. Is it something to indulge in when you come from out of town? Absolutely.Side note - we asked for a grilled blueberry muffin with butter (a typical ask that my girlfriend makes when we go out to brunch) and I have to say that this muffin was a solid 9/10. The blueberries were whole and fresh - it tasted like they baked the muffin this morning!Definitely recommend getting in a bit early, because the wait can get somewhat long. Everything was delicious!"}, {"review_id": "vazWsheAzFwjU21zX9p0AQ", "user_id": "r4PrM1JfEwfRuLDfQuvo8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Love this little gem restaurant......

This place gets crowded, so pick your time wisely (I'm not sure whether they take reservations). We aren't usually too picky, so a spot at the counter is perfectly fine with us. The food is delicious - I absolutely love the breakfast potatoes here. They're the perfect combo of starchy potato with a crunch, and they taste best drowned in red hot. :PTry one of their benedicts, the hash, or go full on and get some pancakes! I like the Cajun bene since it has a bit more spice to it, but I'm not completely sold on the everything bagel it comes with...still tasty, just a bit difficult to eat without making a mess."}, {"review_id": "0JWobpAuCfFdw7eqEJlqcw", "user_id": "EbGjrHDrbVlSiN8z3gB8Eg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/2/2017", "text": "Went to JP Spoonem's today for breakfast and I was impressed by the charm that the little diner had. The place was old but clean and the service was on top notch. Parking is on the street and the menu prices are relatively affordable. I got a Western omelet and it tasted amazing!  Portion sizes were medium-large considering the prices. I believe I got the omelet, a large serving of potatoes, and 2 pieces of toast for about $9.50. Love this place and would come back the next time I stop in Cranston!"}, {"review_id": "xFwXlz_0ZgkI95NuM-Zmmw", "user_id": "L9FXfeo7YhQH9EQlAre8Nw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/10/2017", "text": "JP Spoonem is somewhere I spontaneously decided to try out. I usually yelp restaurants before I go but this breakfast place was so close to where I live and it is so packed with people all the time. I figured the food has to be good and I was not wrong! Their menu is pretty extensive with something for everyone.I went with a large group of people and had the awesome opportunity to try out a variety of things from their menu. In my personal opinion, the Bulls Eye dish was delicious and creative. A french toast with eggs in the middle! My dad really enjoyed this dish and my dad can be quite the critic when it comes to food. We also had the classic benny, pancake special, portobello benny, and the southside benny. They all tasted pretty good!One thing to be aware is that the service is a slowerthan normal, especially during peak breakfast times (for obvious reasons). And they don't take credit cards. Be sure to take cash! I didn't know the first time I went so I had to withdraw money from the ATM along with the fee they charge.. They do have an ATM inside the store though. Something to keep in mind! I think what makes this place great is the very reasonable price and the cozy feelings it gave me. I won't lie it is nothing fancy but that is the beauty of it. Very honest and hearty breakfast to enjoy on a lazy morning!  I will be back for more."}, {"review_id": "rlR3aFPC-7wtr2vBM1Q5UA", "user_id": "EfCuN2O6LHmxUleYT1_JeQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/20/2017", "text": "Simple, good breakfast/brunch food. Diner sort of interiors although quaint in its own way. The place is not really that big although there are some seats outside as well. Cash only place although there is an ATM inside. No alcoholic beverages. Price range is $. They have a good selection of items on the menu and daily specials. Service can be somewhat slow on the weekends but not too bad. Got the Cajun eggs Benedict which were pretty good. Overall good place to brunch/have breakfast.

It kind of looks like a small, local diner but the food was amazing. At first when we entered there was a line but plenty of seating available at the bar, so we sat there because we were starving. I kind of preferred that since it wrapped around the center of the restaurant and made it easier for the two of us to talk.Our server was so sweet and I told her I was debating between the Bull's Eye or Black Bean and Roasted Corn Hash with Eggs...she helped me decide on the latter and it was such a great choice. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the whole wheat toast and homefries were crispy just the way I wanted them...I was surprised it didn't feel that heavy or greasy! I wish I could come regularly but this may be my only trip to Providence...such a memorable meal. Highly recommended, and if you're not sure of what to get or you're allergic to something or particular about how you want something cooked, just let them know!"}, {"review_id": "x2LIl6NzMb2ElIBGtygxiw", "user_id": "R8_de5TonZGcMztAAQMWwQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Everything exceeded expectations.

So I found myself in Rhode Island with no local knowledge and I decide to yelp, and found a gem. The breakfast food and server attitude were both stellar. Two quick notes:1. I think an ATM is inside but try to bring cash only cuz no credit/debit cards accepted 2. Don't expect ambiance, it's not present. This is like an old diner, NO frillsSo I'm happy to report the food was just amazing: colleague had the best eggs benedict and breakfast potatoes he claimed he's ever eaten, and I had some French Toast that literally redefines the phrase French Toast. It was some Polynesian French Toast or something like that, with fruit and stuffed ricotta, just amazing. They probably have 50-60 breakfast items. Best advice is look at all the many Yelper photos, check out the food and presentation for yourself.This is a real find, special food and such nice employees! I felt like I was in Minnesota, the people were that sweet."}, {"review_id": "ykTvPDwmrNlPX6_rxZ0xAQ", "user_id": "MPAM1lBWOKqfPOVrab40GA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/23/2017", "text": "My one complaint here is that they only take cash. They do have an ATM inside that charges a fee for using it. So I might not be back just because of that since I usually am not one to keep cash on me.

It's also really small inside so there will probably be a wait on weekend mornings and there isn't much room to stand inside while waiting."}, {"review_id": "HkEgzGdojJNGnRQXTKWsKA", "user_id": "8aGfMiRWiL0IpL5ySeoL3A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "If I ever am on death row and wanted breakfast for my last meal the only question would be what to order off the menu. The stuffed French toast was the reason I first came here and the reason I will forever come back. The corned beef hash does not lie when it says it the number 1 in Rhode Island. It is the reason I don't want to order it anywhere else so I am not disappointed. The johnny cake platter is amazing. And their list of different benedict options is enough to make choosing one of the most difficult decisions I will ever make.

Three of us went on this past Labor Day (so holiday crowd on a weekday), and were very plesantly surprised.The portions were filling -- not huge generic American diner fare, but not tiny boutiquey plates either. The food was sized right for three guys who make their own meals, and tasted good. The Hollandaise sauce was right in the perfect spot between too creamy and too runny, with several Benedict-style options to choose. There were five types of french toast, my brother chose the thin style, which was pieces of white bread soaked, spiced, and cooked to expectation and served with plenty of butter.

I ordered the Cajun Benedict which was unbelievably good. It came with spicy chorizo, Cajun hollandaise,  poached eggs, all over your choice of bread. I also got the loaded home fries which were great but I regret not asking for them well-done (recommend doing this if you like your potatoes crispy). Our waitress was lovely and attentive - our coffee mugs were promptly filled up every time they got close to empty. We let her know in the beginning of the meal that we were in a slight rush and she was very accommodating. The prices surprised me a little, somewhat on the expensive side for such a casual diner-feeling restaurant.
