Super authentic tasting and wasn't overkill on the cheeses. Light enough that one person could finish the whole thing. We finished it off with a slice of one of their gelato cakes.  Amazing meal in Evansville."}, {"review_id": "miw2J4-9bzu4G2iZ3UKijA", "user_id": "ompkeN8VlSdhbQcDY2B9Rw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "My wife and I stopped by Pangea for lunch the other day. She had a pork sandwich with broccolirab. I had the Thai curry soup noodles with pork chunks.The staff was fabulous, service quick, but a little stingy with the napkins.Not serious complaints, but a couple of suggestions. The hoagie bun was a ciabatta type thing that apparently had been pre-sliced and left to sit out exposed to kitchen air, because both the interior and exterior surfaces were dry and hardened. Not the best texture. And while the yellow curry broth with veggies, noodles, and cilantro was very tasty, it would benefit by lime wedges and a Thai basil leaf or two, which should accompany such a dish, especially considering the menu price.The gelato is awesome. The room temperature could've been more cozy, as witnessed by many patrons dining in their winter gear. But this is common in Evansville where the ambiant temperature in most local restaurants seem to be controlled in favor of the kitchen and wait staff.However, I am eager to return as the food and service is excellent."}, {"review_id": "CP9MLbvQpWpEzS9UffdN7A", "user_id": "MRx1AZo_Sw-cctdqKxUgFw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "The hipsters of Evansville hang here.

I've tried lots of spots while visiting this weekend and this is for sure the only spot worth going to, considerable Evansville doesn't have too many great foodie spots. I absolutely loved everything about this place. Cute market with an espresso bar and gelaterie/desserts. I got the roasted vegetables with chicken added. Let me just say that I will for sure crave this specific meal again in the future. The bowl had Brussel sprouts, carrots, butternut squash and this sweet soy sauce (I asked for it on the side). Absolutely incredible. Pretty big portion, I took half to go. The staff was super friendly and immediately welcoming as soon as we walked in. I also got an americano from the espresso bar and I'd say they had quality coffee. Lovely place with a comfortable ambience."}, {"review_id": "6aRdlXakbFEk9J1nkHvMbg", "user_id": "pCAPueQynM70bSTPNy9c_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "Ummmm ALERT!  FOOD PORN!had an amazing lunch and sampled from a few of the areas - Siam Detroit pizza which was delicious and unique.

We really like them!My husband loves pizza, so he may try others at some point, but so far he just wants the wild fungi. It is a deeper dish, four large pieces cut from an approximately 8x11\" rectangle, topped with a lot of their made-in-house mozzarella and, of course, those mushrooms. My favorite so far is the vegetarian Thai Khao Soi, a big stainless steel soup bowl with a curry soup, spiral noodles, pickled mustard greens, red bell pepper and red onion sliced thinly, and some other kinds of crunchy pickles. I had ordered it with added tofu, but they forgot that. The soup is spicy, but not overly so, and really flavorful. Yum!Since we are vegetarians, I asked about several other dishes before settling on this one. Others have fish sauce as an ingredient, or other non-veggie spoilers. It is hard to find Thai food that is vegetarian, so I was glad to find this one dish (besides pizza) that I could enjoy. This time, we got containers to take home about half of our meals. That left room to try the gelato on the way out!We arrived about 4:30pm on a Saturday, and only two other tables were taken. By 5pm, most of the tables were taken.I like the open kitchen on two sides of the room. Watching the food being prepared is more interesting than TV. The atmosphere is kind of eclectic modern. The customers were all ages, and not a rowdy bunch - even the kiddos. Check their online menu for selections and pricing. They also have an app which might be handy for to go ordering if you didn't have modifications."}, {"review_id": "NToX2yOSrCtqMIAuCnhOJA", "user_id": "6M-iccnNfzX55pB_7awA1Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/19/2018", "text": "Food was great, a bit of a funky setup getting your own table.  They let way more people in and order/pay than there are tables available so when I'm spending $45 for food and a glass of wine it would be nice not to feel so rushed.  People were literally standing by our table waiting and watching you eat ready to dive on our table when we left.  Again food really good food but you would think they could redo this seating thing as it is a bit of a negative."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pangea-kitchen-evansville?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
