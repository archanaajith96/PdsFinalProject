Bakersfield really holds it's own with a hip and well-lit environment, friendly waitstaff, and amazing food. A person can go through their entire menu in just a few visits because they serve inexpensive, small gourmet tacos, so you can buy three or more and be perfectly satisfied. The chips and dip are good as well! I will definitely be back in the future. Pro tip: call for reservations or expect a long wait. We ended up waiting for a table for over 15 minutes and ended up in communal seating anyways. Still a great experience!"}, {"review_id": "gZsdMHqq6Z4aCA3sTrkdTQ", "user_id": "PxJnjRuJrBmaDqKE-R-fMQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "I expected more from a place with such promising reviews, but honestly, I wasn't overly impressed. I came here for lunch when the restaurant had a handful of seated tables, but wasn't crowded by any means. We sat at the bar and the bartender was nowhere to be found, so it took some time to put our order in. Thankfully, we weren't in a rush, but we were definitely hungry!The chips and salsa were good, and I like that they give verde (green) salsa instead of the regular salsa. My tacos, however, weren't that great. I ordered the Pollo Rojo and Al Pastor Tacos and both of them were lukewarm at best and had soggy tortillas. The meat on each taco was flavorful, but the food temperature and soggy taco shells really threw off the taste. My coworker ordered the Willie salad and enjoyed it, so perhaps it's just that the tacos aren't the greatest. I would definitely return to try their Margaritas."}, {"review_id": "yYRenoRjR3kdD-PYWsZ_ug", "user_id": "PrPAKuxN2Aw_QL60DhALKQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "OVERALL: variety of good fusion tacos with interesting flavors, and amazing service. I went here with a large group of friends a while ago, and would probably come again. We ordered a ton of tacos - two huge plates full of them - and we got them in a timely manner. Our waiter was also friendly and funny, adding to the atmosphere. Great service! A solid 4.5/5. As for the food, they're not the best tacos I've had. They were also a bit small for the price. However, the flavors were interesting and you could tell that the restaurant put a lot of thought into making different variations of traditional tacos, creating fusion food that was of high quality meat and other ingredients. Personally though, I'm just not a fan of some of the flavors, but that might also be because of my preference toward more traditional tacos. I give the food a 3.5/5."}, {"review_id": "tvCixwEDUvB22CK-nvUmrg", "user_id": "D3jD3N0m8Q3PVvILx1KeuQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "We ordered eight of the Al Pastor tacos through Postmates!

I've been giving them three stars for the food, because their pollo is so dry. Long story short..Every time I think it'll improve, it didn't.

The other tacos are good but I still didn't think they're outstanding. I want to like them so badly, but overall I just come here for the margaritas and the cool atmosphere.

After a morning of meetings I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to check it out. Street parking wasn't bad as I got there right at 11 when they were opening. Just know, all parking meters are in the same side of the street and through the week you will pay $4 for an hour.  I'll tell you now, it is totally worth it!In Columbus I had Chips and Guacamole but this time I opted to get the Queso as I had been told it is the way to go. I can now confirm as a Guac Fiend...the Queso is way better at Bakersfield!!! It is truly something unique and special. Pair it with the milder Cilantro based Green Sauce or spicy Red Sauce and you will have a winning combo!  I still hold a grudge that chips aren't complimentary but I'll get over it someday.Now I loved the Shrimp Taco last time I had it and once again, it is one of the very best Tacos I've ever had! The slaw and sauce along with large shrimp just can't be beat. And while I wasn't blown away with the Al Pastor on my previous visit, this time it was far superior. I just wish the Pastor had a bit more crispness to it.  Quiet honestly, these are the best Tacos I've found in Pittsburgh to date!  I also tried their special Chorizo Chili and suggest you do as well if it is on the menu. An excellent blend of sweet and spicy that is hearty and filling.This location was I bit smaller and more compact than Columbus but didn't feel cramped. It was well staffed and everyone I interacted with was friendly and helpful.  Playing old westerns on the TVs was also a nice touch.  If you are a Taco fan and nearby, get here ASAP!"}, {"review_id": "zOQW9HCWT84-fjEtG2r7Uw", "user_id": "mxufNEcZIYndtjPHVtCh5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "** Tasty tacos with various protein choices and drink options. Nice ambiance to complement the food for a great place to hang out and enjoy food with friends or family. I was introduced to this place by my girlfriend who has been here a few times, and had a lot of good things to say about it, so one night I went with her and some of her friends to try it out. Everyone seemed to really enjoy the experience, so I think Bakersfield definitely made a good impression on me.$4 tacos with all your traditional proteins like pork, beef, as well as fish, shrimp, and short rib. The taco sizes aren't huge, so I ordered four tacos, so just keep that in mind. I also had the sangria, which was a bit stronger than I expected, but still tasty and went well with the food. The lighting was a little too dark in my opinion to see, and the high table with the sofa seating was a bit awkward since it felt like we were too low, but as a whole the ambiance is pretty nice since it gives you a relaxed vibe.

We were alerted the wait time was around 45 min but decided to head that way anyhow. When we got in we put down our name and walked over to an open place near the bar. It was very busy and had shared seating - long booth on one side and high tops on other side. Bar has room to eat as well and there are usually two bartenders so your wait for a beverage isn't long. After about 5min a seat opened at the bar so we took that and sat and watched the tournament games and talked about the week. Eyes big, hungry hearts type stuff. Soon there after, another seat opened at the bar and everyone got a seat so we put in a drink and food order there. The bartender (John? - Giants hat) was very attentive and got us going with drinks and some queso, adding that the food comes out somewhat fast so he staggered the app and food order so we weren't rushed. ***NOTE: Tacos are small so make sure to order several***- which I was alerted to by my bud who had been there previously. We ordered several a piece and hung out sipping our beverages and hanging out. Time stood still. Queso was VERY GOOD AND TASTY. The chorizo we added had a nice kick to it, and even though the chips were more plentiful than the queso, it was very good. As for the tacos - I ordered a chicken, steak and fish, and all three were good. They each were prepared a different way (slaw, sauce, etc) but all equally good with a nice tortilla. Chicken was more shredded with a hotter sauce, steak was cubed with a sweeter finish and fish was good and had nice sauce on it. Again, tacos were on the small side but overall the meal was just enough. MAIN ISSUE: We ordered extra sour cream (or crema) and I mean to tell ya, it came in a condiment cup HALF FULL. I know it was only a dollar but we are big sour cream fans and feel like the amount we were given was like they were out of it or at the end of the container and just added enough. We ended up not getting dessert and instead I had mine back at the hotel, but I highly recommend this place as a nice place to sit and eat and enjoy your time together. Great start to the weekend."}, {"review_id": "wG_88_XVpBSuT21eemZUQw", "user_id": "OCs1rWzfoZKw8prDq_83Nw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Yummy tacos!

Try the chips and queso or chips and guac to start - incredible. The chips are super salty (my favorite) and they give you plenty plus two types of salsas (the green one is my favorite!) They always have a special taco. Tonight the special taco was chicken with some type of peanut topping so that leaves me out. No worries, I just like to look at the special menu. It has a special margarita too. Tonight it's grapefruit. I ordered a glass of sangria. Amazing! It's a sweet red wine with lots of fruit (think apples and blackberries). It's served in a mason jar so portion is perfect. The glass is priced at $8. I drink a lot of sangria so that's reasonably priced for a drink not on happy hour pricing in the city. For dinner is usually order the chicken tacos. If you order tacos with a group they come out on a large pizza tray - so cool. Tonight I tried something different - the chicken chorizo tostada. I highly recommend it. The portion size is perfect and the price is great. Tasty and filling. This place is perfect for lunch, dinner or a few drinks. It has a chic urban feel with two dining areas - one upstairs where you walk in the main doors and on downstairs so do not be discouraged if it looks full when you first enter. The staff is friendly and always full of great recommendations.

Bakersfield offers several choices of tacos. Everything from; beef, chicken, veggies and fish. Unlike so many other taco places they actually have a wide variety of tacos to choose from. Downside: the tacos are pretty small so you will have to order at least 3 or more to fill you up. The chips and salsa is really good too. The salsa is fresh and has lots of flavor and a tad bit of spiciness. And the chips come out slightly warm so you can tell they are also fresh. Another plus is they are open till 2am every night.

Then Bakersfield should be on your list.Bakersfield has good drinks and some delicious tacos. However, my favorite thing on the menu is their queso. Arriving in its own mini skillet, the queso has been baked in the oven so that the creamy cheese has a golden brown top. The caramelized top adds flavor and texture which makes it different from many of the queso options out there. Avoiding one of the major pitfalls of many dips (dip to chip ratio per order), the queso arrives with an enormous basket of chips so that no bit of queso will go uneaten. (Though a spoon would work just fine in a pinch.)The tacos at Bakersfield are small, so order a few. Some of the most delicious options are the cocinita pibil, the short rib, and the Baja shrimp. I also enjoy their margaritas, which you can make spicy with peppers for just $1 more!As far as service goes, the food comes out quickly, but the drinks (especially mixed drinks like margaritas) might take a little longer during happy hour."}, {"review_id": "Nh7POEbVZ2C3wCDAoBe8Mw", "user_id": "CZojkZ0aXoNsHQBLI-NU3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "I went here during a conference and was pleased with the service I received.

This place has got to buy there salt in bulk bc they are heavy handed with the stuff.We started with guacamole which was ok... not the best I have had but had decent flavor. You can tell it was homemade but the flavor was more salty/oniony rather than creamy avocado with some lime. They mentioned they were out of homemade chips but then made some out of the tortilla's they had. These were LOADED with salt and I think they knew it so they comped the guacamoles and chips app. This was a nice gesture and we appreciated it.  The queso dip was not the best. It was grainy and didnt have that velvety texture or cheesy flavor that I am normally used to with queso. I wouldnt recommend. I ordered the chicken milanese torta. Now I have had many authentic torta's and this WAS NOT A TORTA. This is a chicken milanese sandwich. A torta has a special kind of combination of ingredients and this wasnt it. I will say this was a very good sandwich but definitely should not be classified as a torta. Not sure if it is a play on words.The tacos were the best part of the night. The mahi taco was fresh and the combination of flavors worked well. The other tacos were similarly delicious.I wasnt the biggest fan of how they served them because no one really knew which ones were which and when we did it was awkward getting them from the big tray to our plates.The drinks were solid and i would recommend the margarita's. Solid place to have a drink and the decor was also modern and cool. The crowd gave it a good vibe and I could definitely see myself hanging out here if I am in the area again.If they can only figure out the salt situation this would be a 4 star place."}, {"review_id": "7qM_AADwZnyxPl2h8wxygg", "user_id": "YA-caxALI4C-eCiSM97new", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Who knew you could strip a pierogi and turn the shell into a taco shell?So co-workers arranged for a going away party for one of our dearest employees who is moving on to another job, and because of its close proximity, Bakersfield was chosen. Knowing that we all don't earn very much, it's kind of hard to understand WHY they chose one of the pricier places in the neighborhood, but there ya go.We arrived at what was supposed to be an hour into the event, and we could find none of our group. Not upstairs, nor downstairs, and no one, including one other former employee that found us, knew anything about where this gathering was, so we opted to wait at the bar until it could be figured out. I had no idea that a taco place would be quite so 'country' themed, but when it came down to it, it was much more 'Tex' than Tex-Mex' anyway. Some of the food was called the 'Willie' and the 'Loretta'. YEE-HA!The music was loud, which made the rest of the atmosphere loud. Loud music and people yelling at each other. The bartender, who was actually very cool, and a bit gifted in the mixology department, asked what we wanted to drink. The special was the Bakersfield Margarita, and I am not a fan of Tequila at all, unless it's being sung by Son Of Dave, Tape Five or The Manhattan Transfer. My better half had one, and I ordered a Manhattan, which I should NOT have done on an empty stomach. The bartender, a guy probably in his mid to late 40's, silver bearded, said that I would not get a Manhattan like this from anyone else in the place.It was STRONG, and almost SO 'fancy' that I didn't recognize it as a Manhattan, and on the empty stomach it took about one 'finger' to go to my head. But the 'not quite recognized as' theme carried through to the food.My better half ordered a Pollo (POY-yo - which is chicken) Taco from the special taco menu, and I ordered the Cubano sandwich, or as they called it, Torta. Just after I placed my order, my better half's 'taco' came. A $4 taco. It was truly so tiny that it literally looked like they'd split open a pierogi, scraped out the stuffing, and then topped the pierogi dough with some taco stuff. It was very flavorful, according to my better half, but for $4? Totally not worth buying. It definitely didn't serve at a meal, and barely as an appetizer. And definitely not enough to counter a strong Margarita.Another former employee came by, and we discovered that our gathering was hiding in a back corner, so we moved to that area before the sandwich arrived, and it was delivered back there.Now, I lived in Miami, and I know what a Cubano is in terms of the sandwich. Also called a 'Medianoche' (May-dee-ah-NO-chay - which means 'midnight') it is a common late night post drinking binge nosh, rather like Primanti's. Well, this sandwich at Bakersfield was NO Medianoche, but it's okay that they call it a Cubano. It really was very good, with delicious and kicky toppings, and a wonderful side chipotle sauce. It was ten bucks, but a decent size.So, for a Manhattan, a Margarita, a toy taco the size of an unfolded pierogi, and an actual sandwich, the bill came to just over $40.The bartender was awesome, and the staff were all helpful and courteous. I just can't say I'd make any kind of return trip. Too expensive, tacos totally not worth the price, and so loud that you could not have a normal conversation without pressing your mouth to someone's ear, or flat out yell-talking.But seriously...the tacos...there are several Mexican options downtown, and Tex-Mex. With such competition so nearby, why the tiny tacos? There wasn't even ROOM on the shell for more than a heaping tablespoon of 'stuff'. This is kind of a need to go BIGGER or go HOME kind of thing. I do give points for the Cubano though. And one final pronunciation, and a good thing to remember for spitting out the Spanish language. All of the vowels in the Spanish language only have ONE soundA - AhE - ehI - eeO - ohU - ooh (like eww, not 'ohhhh')Coo-BAH-no. Not Cue-BAN-oh..."}, {"review_id": "qh8GugFQ9kSfyMvrm6Yqpg", "user_id": "d0D7L-vfQDIADolnPAcb9A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/25/2017", "text": "Bakerfields is one of the places I had bookmarked forever, but never seemed to check it out.
