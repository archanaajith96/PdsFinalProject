What an array of whiskey you see as you enter!  None of us are whiskey drinkers but it looks like a bourbon aficionado's dream. The menu is amazing, featuring an 18 ounce steak among other steak and chop choices. We went for the barbecue...although I didn't. I ordered a Reuben that was so big I couldn't open my big mouth wide enough for it. Food and service were great!  Ladies room has seat covers. Unusually exotic for Lincoln."}, {"review_id": "Qr5aicn1o8NJZAQ6eCOduQ", "user_id": "ABVLbcZhaMiDtZIJjQ4lIQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I thought this place was going to be a higher end steak, BBQ and whiskey place, but then you walk in and it's decor is lacking. Tables and chairs are something you'd find in a cafeteria. They did have a good selection of whiskey drinks, but found out they use powered eggs whites in their drinks, not what you'd expect for craft cocktails.We had the BBQ and it was solid, but had better at more divey BBQ joints for a lot less. I did not like the cole slaw at all. Overall not impressed I'm sorry to say."}, {"review_id": "DXM6KoJ97QwTmLuu2xXFfQ", "user_id": "TKwzreBMGFbu9zN6taeVLA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "We dined here on a work trip to Lincoln. The restaurant is located in downtown Lincoln (right across the street from our hotel - the Embassy Suites). The restaurant was large and empty on a Thursday night. The decor is minimal and the restaurant feels like it was furnished on a small budget. I ordered a Moscow mule (delicious); caesar salad (was good but the lettuce was brown and it was drenched in dressing); and the rib, brisket, and pulled pork combo with a side of mashed potatoes. The portions were large but the meat was super dry and lacked flavor. The best part of the meal was the mashed potatoes and our friendly and upbeat waiter.This is not a place I would suggest seeking out, as it lacked ambience and the food wasn't great."}, {"review_id": "JvsMOBcNZCK14K4BitxRug", "user_id": "mMV6IQNCcjmeD3y4INUgNg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "I eat at a lot of steak houses and this one did a great job preparing the food.

I travel quite often and have eaten at some of the fanciest steakhouses in MInneapolis Chicago Vegas St Louis New Orleans etc, and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the steak here. I would put it in the top 3 filets I've ever had. No messing around with sauces, charded perfectly to keep the flavor in. Well done, will definitely come back here when I'm in town. The Corn Bread was a definite try as well."}, {"review_id": "e0h5NvGYPGAO2IO5tt0_Uw", "user_id": "i4wZjNx5SI4RE-Sc-TQt2Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "I'm gonna give this place 2 stars. I've had the top 3 steaks in my life in Nebraska, so I was expecting an awesome steak experience here. Not even close. The hotel recommended this place as the best around, so we expected great things. To start, the atmosphere was like we were in 90's country bar and Patrick Swayze was gonna start roundhouse kicking the obnoxious drunk on stage (Roadhouse). The app selection was terrible. Like we had trouble finding one damn appetizer that sounded good. I order the prime (10 dollar up charge) bone in ribeye, which ended up being the worst 50 dollar steak you could imagine. Fatty, think, dry, overall terrible. They should be ashamed serving this honestly. Oh, and get this: they don't have baked potatoes!! In a damn steakhouse in Nebraska....no baked potatoes. Let that sink in. The more I think about it, I should give this place 1 star, but I'll leave it with 2, as in 2 thumbs down. Never again here. Save your money and head somewhere else for a steak."}, {"review_id": "13m_jsCSNxflGFXM2-swfg", "user_id": "umwODX6bt3lLUZ3NsscZdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/11/2017", "text": "I will give this place 5 stars because the service was AMAZING and the prices are not bad. They are their own smoke house and cut house as well. As you can see I got the sampler of ribs, pulled pork and brisket. The pulled pork was the best part! The brisket and ribs were a tad bit dry. However you do get 4 different sauces to choose from. (Spicy, Sweet, Tangy, and last one was not labeled) I recommend the Sweet and Spicy as the tangy had a very unique taste to it. Like you see on many reviews the atmosphere is very relaxed and there is no need to get super dressed up as it's casual and relaxing. Great place to bring the office for lunch or a larger family."}, {"review_id": "xxcGTSXAfHfcycXi6zuXiQ", "user_id": "suh47jKrTL508WyyFjNgXQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "I was in town for work and it was close to my hotel.  And while I was looking for decent, I got excellent.  I didn't take part in any of the whiskeys, but it looked like have a great selection.  The BBQ was what I was there for, and it did not disappoint.  I got the triple barrel sandwich and it was delicious.  And the staff was very helpful in assisting me to make the difficult choice of what to get.  I'd come here again if I make it back to Lincoln."}, {"review_id": "garlq76e8OB8SmvTm34O4g", "user_id": "EB0OIQD9NxKAsuFGkKMhow", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/20/2017", "text": "This place was terrible!   First of all the ambiance reminds one of nothing less that 90s era country line dancing joint-a big empty room with cheap tables and chairs scattered about seeming haphazardly.  There is veneer of sophistication given their extensive selection of bourbon, but the investment in decor and atmosphere is limited to the several square yards around the front bar area. My colleague and I were seated at a booth that featured badly torn upholstery and a table that rocked at least 15 degrees in each direction.  We moved to a table which was somewhat more stable.  We each ordered barbecue items...the brisket and the ribs.  Each came serves on a plastic tray and a piece of thin deli paper.  However when requested the server did bring a real plate. Both meat items were burned and we had to cut the burned portion off to try to eat the entrees. We both left a lot behind that was inedible. All in all a terrible experience.   This strikes us as a place the student crowd would love but anyone who values a quality meal in nice surroundings should avoid."}, {"review_id": "ld2hK1pamYi4SkTX9GnUDQ", "user_id": "t1B18e5ucYFmvg2oHvQ41w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "Great Husker game day atmosphere.

After reading the reviews here, I thought I'd give it a whirl.  When I first walked in I almost spun on my heels and headed to the Brazilian steakhouse a couple blocks away. This place is way more casual than the Capital Grille like experience I anticipated and is more Longhorn Steakhouse than Ruth's Chris from an ambience standpoint. Am I glad I stayed!  The butter grilled NY Strip with bone marrow butter was literally one of the best steaks I can remember eating. It was cooked to medium rare perfection and was a huge portion.  The wine list was a bit lame but the bourbon list more than made up for it. Looking forward to my next business trip up  here to hit it again!"}, {"review_id": "MsFZ7Kr1cPZY8HxvxehZnw", "user_id": "3RtkFO7qQTdw4I0OzTVzbw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/26/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Just had the best meal at this restaurant during my stay at Lincoln. I ordered the filet and asked about blackening. It was a $2 up charge which was a little off-putting, because the steak was already $37! Whatever, ordered it anyway. The filet was cooked absolutely perfect! Tender and tasty. Just phenomenal. Happens so rarely. Service was good. Friendly server helped me with the menu and was back at all the right times. The place however could probably use a little refurbishment. The seat I was sitting on had rips and looked weathered. Holes on the wall where an imaginary picture hung. But they delivered on the food so well, I'm overlooking the aesthetics and grading them at 5 stars."}, {"review_id": "EdumpwxD6iUrfE228CweTg", "user_id": "IP3kmrKR4C-e0Q5pnINUNQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/29/2017", "text": "Visiting daughter at UNL. First time to Single Barrel. Service was friendly, attentive and appropriate level. Sparse crowd for a Friday evening with an away game. Huge projection screen to watch the game though.
