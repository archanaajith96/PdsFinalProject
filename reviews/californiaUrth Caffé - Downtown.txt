The food was sooo good that I had to go back for dinner after going in for brunch on the same day. The portions are huge for the prices they're asking for and the place has a very hippy vibe. I ordered their smoked salmon on a bagel and the quality of the food was perfect. I also had their lasagna which I would highly recommend !"}, {"review_id": "8NqEN0wFbCRwpxWw1hnGXQ", "user_id": "9Rci_LVCuu0EAHsx8Fbyug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Tried this place for the first time last month & it was amazing!

Met a friend here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  The line moves fairly quickly to order and we were able to find a table outside. Luckily, there was a heat lap right by our table. I thought about ordering something different but I love their curry chicken salad.  It's not only healthy but delicious. My friend got a breakfast burrito.  Overall this is great Urth location.  Not a fan of the restroom line as it was 5-6 people deep the entire time.

The last time I was in LA, we went almost everyday, and I am planning my next trip to LA just so I can go back.  I have tried the caprese sandwich, a couple of the pizzas, and the tostada (which is a salad in a fried tortilla shell), and while everything was delicious, my favorite was definitely the tostada. Best Italian Cappuccino in the US. The milk was steamed perfectly and the espresso had the perfect balance of deep flavor without being bitter. They also have a green tea boba drink, which is very different from any other boba drink I have ever tried.  Normally, I am not a big tea drinker but this almost managed to convert me. I will note that it is a little pricey. However, this is one of those places where the prices are worth it for the quality and portion size. If you go to Urth, you will not be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "jMZhVM013Yx9VjSvAhSP-Q", "user_id": "TGATf2bXXs4wO4aw_b9YLQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Yummo! If sandwiches are your thing, then come down to Urth cafe. Located just south of Alameda, Urth is amazing. I gotta say it was quite busy for a Monday night, but my friend who I went with advised me it is always packed. A good sign for this yelper and his appetite :) I got lucky finding a parking spot in the front of the venue, but parking can be an issue. The line was not that bad and the menu was stacked. We came for the sandwiches, but the menu is great to browse and try something new. My friend and I always split our food. That way we can try two different things at once. I ordered Panini El Diablo it was a Grilled cilantro marinated chicken breast, with three chili sauces, thinly sliced jalapeno (not too hot), cilantro,  and Monterey jack cheese. The chicken breast was savory and the melted Monterey jack cheese complimented it perfectly. The salad that came with my sandwich had just the right amount of dressing. Light and good. My friend order the  Urth Pot Roast Sandwich it was Slow roasted beef with natural juices on a French baguette. Served with a mixed greens salad and homemade horseradish sauce. I love pot roast and Urth's tasted just like mom makes. The horseradish sauce was tasty not too much bite. The meal was light and enjoyable. The ambiance is casual and everybody seems to have a smile on their face. Well the food is great, so now I know why everyone is all smiles. Staff is courteous. They are looking to make your meal better any way they can. I am coming back! Be prepared for a line, but keep you head up you will not be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "BpfLkVFiHz8DvrGGiSRdlA", "user_id": "5om9S_f4WHrXuv0cIPnN6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Organic food amazingly delicious!

There were a lot of people but still a few seats here and there. As the other reviews mentioned, the line system could be made a lot more efficient. Everyone kind of has to cram into a corner and it's really hectic.We ordered an Iced Americano and the typical drink people get, the green tea boba. We were number 90, and they insisted they'd bring it out to us, kindly, so we took a seat.We noticed a couple who had gotten their order in later get their two coffees and entrees first, but we decided to wait and be patient. 10 minutes later we noticed others who had been behind us get the exact same single green tea blended boba! We thought maybe they had mixed up our order so we asked our waiter who told us it would be right out. But unfortunately we had to ask two more times until finally, someone higher up came by....... and proceeded to tell us that the numbers don't mean anything about who gets what food first.We said that okay, we understand that, but when number 97 (who was behind us in line) gets their green tea boba first, it's confusing to us as customers because we are sitting with our order unfinished and someone else who came after us getting our exact same order before us.He kept pushing back and telling us that we weren't waiting that long. We explained that we had been waiting for 30 minutes. He disagreed, went and got our receipt, and showed it to us. \"It hasn't been 30 minutes! Look here!\" he said as he handed us our receipt. I legitimately thought he must have been joking, because it had been exactly 29 minutes, so yes, it is TECHNICALLY not 30 minutes but wow I didn't realize 1 minute was such a huge difference -- wish that showed in the 29 minutes we waited for a drink that others got before us.Anyways, all in all, it was a hugely frustrating experience. We eventually got a full refund and got our order, then that senior waiter / manager came over and told us, \"I'll take care of your waiter. I'll make sure this is his last day. He's going to be fired.\" He proceeded to come by again to inform us that he was firing that first waiter.I'm not sure if the intent was to make us uncomfortable or feel guilty, but it certainly wasn't our intention to fire anyone. We just wanted to get two drinks and not wait half an hour for the drink, and to be served in an order that made sense. I would understand if we were served later because we ordered a lot of food, but given that people around us were ordering food and we ordered only two drinks, I really just don't understand how it took so long and why there were so many inane excuses made, especially over a single minute.- 29 minutes of waiting- Rude staff- Messed up order- Disrespectful behavior overallWould not recommend."}, {"review_id": "4gheUxP6xYUE5hfvjL2KJg", "user_id": "zlqbbhAujrMla0eDiK7mIw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "What I'm starting to realize since moving to Downtown LA a few months ago, is that LA-ers love their outdoor patios and that you will usually pay a premium to dine at places with cute ambience, but mediocre food. This is one of them. Stopped by today after dinner for some sweets and coffee. My bf and i shared a slice of the Napoleon cake/pastry and a cup of the Coffee of the Day. Total was $9.xx, which means we paid like $6 for the slice and $3 for coffee. Okay, expected --- it was a huge slice of cake after all and a huge mug of coffee. DO NOT GET THE NAPOLEON HERE. Napoleon is my fave cake/pastry and this was probably the worst one I've ever had. The top layer was this sticky sheet that immediately separated and came off in one piece. The pastry was not flaky and crispy as it should be; it was a bit soggy. The custard between layers was good, but it missed on the execution of layers of flaky pastry. Coffee was no Bueno. I normally drink free, black coffee dispensed out of a machine at work so my standards aren't high for coffee. This coffee was bad. It was crazy bitter. Definitely disappointing considering the other drinks I've had here have been good. THE SHORT: desserts look better than they taste, AVOID THE NAPOLEON. AVOID the coffee, stick with espresso-based or tea drinks. Spanish latte and Thai tea latte have been safe bets."}, {"review_id": "FE-VzFpETy23ICwU26518Q", "user_id": "GHoG4X4FY8D8L563zzPX5w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "Urth Caffe has been around since the late '80s and is known to be the first roasting company in the states to offer organic coffee.  They have several locations: Santa Monica, Melrose, Pasadena, Beverly Hills, Laguna Beach, Downtown, and, soon, in Old Towne Orange.Besides coffee and teas, they also have sandwiches, salads, pizzas, lunch/brunch entrees, breakfast bowls, and various desserts.  The hubs and I decided to get the Divine Spice Chai Latte and the Spanish Latte (option of Urth Italia (dark roast) or Urth Dolce (light roast); I opted for the dark).  The chai latte was just okay, as it was more heavy with the cream rather than the spices.  The Spanish Latte was actually pretty good, as it was piping hot, strong, and had a nice little flair to it.The place was a little chaotic, tight, and confusing, as the line for the to-go orders were a little broken up, and you really didn't know who was being helped or has been helped already.  The wait, also, was pretty long.  Watching an employee do latte art was pretty cool, though!There's a patio seating as well as some tables inside for a dine-in option.I'm glad I was finally able to check out Urth Caffe, but not sure if I'd return.+dark or light roast option+long wait-times, especially for to-go orders+in- and outside seating available+limited and restricted parking in the area"}, {"review_id": "tB2V3kMYhXCfht15EMrRNA", "user_id": "R14eFqW1NQ5n5bQ5sVlEFw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Delicious, though mildly overpriced, spot in the Arts District. These days, parking is at a premium more than ever, so be ready to fork over a little bit at the valet lot across the street. If you're in LA, guaranteed you've heard of Urth.

Does it justify the inflated prices? Not so sure. The flourless chocolate cake is definitely worthwhile- it is incredible.

I asked to have pudding and they were happy to tell me to pay over four more dollars so it's more pudding-like!!!!What a ripoff. I just returned it.

I've been to all the Urth Caffe's in the LA area and honestly, they all seem to be pretty consistent for me.For this Urth Caffe in the Downtown location, we did street parking. Street parking is readily available everywhere so that won't be a problem. Since it's Urth Caffe, there is always a line outside of the restaurant but it isn't too bad of a wait. Since we wanted a light lunch, my friend and I both go the Half Chicken Curry Sandwich, which comes with a light salad. It's usually my go-to order and honestly, it was such a good sandwich. The sandwich has a lot of spices and flavor due to the fact that it's curry flavored. The salad on the side was also pleasant as well. I would very be tempted to order a full sandwich at the time but opted for a small instead. Next time, I will probably order a full sandwich because it was that good.
