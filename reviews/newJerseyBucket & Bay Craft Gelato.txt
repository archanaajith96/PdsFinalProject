I've been here several times since it is only a short walk from where I live. From what I've seen, their menu is comprised of their craft gelato, cafe beverages, and select breakfast / brunch items (pastries, sandwiches, etc.) My friends have also gotten fresh coffee beans from here.I have only tried the craft gelato here, so my review is mainly based on the gelato and the interior. Of their flavors, I have tried: 1) bucket & bay vanilla, 2) black label vanilla, 3) bourbon peach, 4) deep dark chocolate, 5) mint chip, 6) rose latte, 7) purple sticky rice, 8) tarragon chip, 9) sea salt caramel. I have liked ALL of the ones I've tried - the flavors are all really distinct and the gelato is really well made. My all time favorites are the 6) rose latte, the 7) purple sticky rice and their classic 1) bucket & bay vanilla. Just a note - there is both outdoor seating and indoor seating here. I think the ambiance is perfect for a little get together / hanging out with your friends or family."}, {"review_id": "6oE4HieGVM3rTE_d_d4CFg", "user_id": "NMxBMu_Br054i2wqktvkvg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "One, the really dark CHOCO gelato...Two, the red eye...Three, wash down with coffee (we did, iced)... Or any other drink you want to try... Which I wanted to, but...No one was available at the register for me to ask about the hot CHOCO... (You know, you have to find out if they use powder, since it pains me to learn that Starbucks has settled for syrup... (though still have love for Star, and the best spot is probably Grove so far...), and La atelier has no access for nature calls...

Maybe I'll give this modern rustic space another go for the super smooth gelatos... Only...One Friday night we went, the man and I seriously didn't get out of there without a headache to take home and, quite possibly, tinnitus, compliments of a couple of screaming kids... (It could've been just one of them who was causing all the noise, but I didn't bother checking who was out of control to avoid glaring at the parents for allowing their kids to act like they should, though at a park...)Please hear me out: I have nothing against children (we have several in our extended family), just overly lax adults who also don't hesitate to put up their feet on the chair.?? First, it isn't a private space (whoever this may concern), but a food establishment. Second, even if you were the proprietor, you don't want to make that gross mistake... And third, it's just plain gross to see--did I mention that?? Especially inside a food establishment, and while we're trying to savor our gelatos... (Go take them tired feet at the park bench or beach or something...)To the business owner(s): please consider all your customers (if you don't already), and not just the few who clearly have no regard for others... I don't think demanding that they abide by a few simple rules in a shared public space counts as an act of intolerance... Please, let sensibility step in before our eateries turn into zoos... (Sorry to the animals held captive in cages because they really are the quiet ones.)Maybe 3 for now, until the guys and I give it another go (for the fifth time) and actually try a menu platter...

It's in a pretty random location, amidst a bunch of (industrial?) buildings. But I did hear that they're developing this area, so let's see what happens to this area in a few years!The inside feels really quaint and cute. It feels like I stepped back into San Francisco into some cool hipster coffee shop. There's a lot of interesting decor, almost like they took a small warehouse and converted it into a coffee shop.The gelato flavors are crazy. They have flavors like fuji apple (unfortunately it was vegan, and I'm generally skeptical of vegan foods), and some flavor that had Johnnie Walker whiskey in it. I wanted something more on the plain side so I just got the vanilla gelato. It was pretty tasty, not the creamiest gelato but I'd get it again! The portions are very small. My friend got the one that had a caramel flavor to it. It tasted quite strong, bitter even. He got an affogato so he also had some espresso.The ambiance is nice and fun. We sat at the corner and they had fun things like a small rocking chair. It has a good ambiance, and I'd recommend chilling here if you have some time to pass and chat with friends!"}, {"review_id": "qZc0D9moTtEvZRxrC_T3qw", "user_id": "YyTlrn9qBIESrEwvpiBWKQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/22/2017", "text": "I have recently moved from Manhattan to Jersey City and found this gem around my neighborhood, which made me so happy!

There are about 10 or so rotational gelato flavors here, including some alcohol infused options as well as at least one vegan option. You can't actually physically see the gelato before you order (the gelato is all hidden in closed containers), but rest assured, everything here is absolutely delicious.Two friends and I decided to share a large bowl of our favorite samples, including Black Label Vanilla (Johnnie Walker and vanilla bean), Dark and Stormy (Gosling rum and ginger), and Orange Blossom (orangle blossom water and orange zest). The first two have strong yet sweet alcoholic flavors that are surprisingly very pleasant. On the other hand, the orange is light and floral with just an essence of citrus in it. All of them were smooth, bold, and rich...and nothing like I've had before! Price-wise the gelato can be a tad expensive, but for the unique and craft creations here, it's worth the treat.

This place is spacious and has plenty of seating spaced out. You can see that their ice cream are all made in house and can see the back kitchen which is open.Their gelato is pricey at about $6-10...but you pay for what you get!

I had the bourbon peach, and though I would have expected to taste a little more bourbon, it was still very good. The redeye has espresso in it - again, no overwhelming flavors.

My favorite is redeye (cold brew and espresso). String flavor that melts in your mouth. Their black label (scotch vanilla) is stronger than I expected. Delicious, creamy and boozy. Ugh their homemade pizzelle cookies and/or cones are so yum! All their flavors are consistently delicious. Definitely worth the price. Such a cute cafe with amazing service.Naturally when we were going to do a ice cream event at work I thought of b&b. They are great to work with. They brought a bike cart and everyone loved it. You can pick 5 flavors. You can pick to have all the sizes ( they even have a smaller event size). We chose to do 1-2 scoop and the pizzelles cookies. There's a set up fee but pay by consumption plus a discount. Definitely not expensive $200 for around 40 people ice cream catering event. (On par with the price of others ice cream trucks but a much better experience!)"}, {"review_id": "uKQJHkxAP7C-mJVkCzBiGw", "user_id": "_i61Z0qsqSSju3FBPKGVOQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/4/2017", "text": "Great spot to go if you're in Jersey City and you're yearning for something sweet, if Torico's on Erie St has a line if you walk a few blocks down to Bay St you might not have to wait in line and try their amazing gelato flavors, be advised that some of their flavors are infused with alcohol. My favorite has to be the redeye which has some espresso flavor inside. They accept cash/credit and parking sometimes is hard to find but I never have had an issue since I normally would go after a nice meal in JC, there's plenty of space for a group of people or a date, bathroom is also available inside, they just opened another one in Hoboken behind City Hall, Enjoy!"}, {"review_id": "LeRd3CmcCSz-6FRPGLI89w", "user_id": "m4H5iuAjsqhbBdg6GNsdhg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/17/2017", "text": "I love Bucket & Bay!

The bourbon peach has a nice balance of flavors and is also very delicate. I could eat them both by the pint-ful!Aside from the gelatos, I also love the way the store is laid out.

The relationship can easily spiral into abyss if my stay in Jersey City wasn't for business. I wished I went daily during my two week stay but instead I only managed to squeeze out two visits. But even then, it was enough to leave an everlasting memory.On my first visit, I tried the Campari grapefruit, deep dark chocolate, and Jasmine flavors. All three flavors were delicious and I can't possibly rank which was my most and least favorite. I would repeat them on any day. On my second visit, I made sure I could try the rose latte because it sold out on my first visit. To secure that, we as decisive adults had dessert before dinner. Without any clutter in our tummies, we went for four flavors: rose latte, toasted coconut, mint chip, and red-eye. I was a bit concerned with coconut, imagining it would be overwhelmingly sweet. That was not the case. In fact, it had a toasty flavor and subtle coconut hints. I am generally not a fan of coconut and I loved this flavor. The rose latte did not disappoint at all and was well worth skipping dinner for! The next time I'm back in Jersey City, I will be anchored at B&B and I hope they will have new flavors ready for me!"}, {"review_id": "gdi8ln9TK7Aqmj2BNCtkgA", "user_id": "rCtzpZloMXUdbJxOKIihzQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2017", "text": "I'm totally obsessed with their craft gelato!

That would be the little surprise for me for my every visit.I usually don't like coconut flavor desserts but their roasted coconut tastes like the real coconut. It's totally much better than the ones I had in other places. They also use the real rose for rose latte!

Once inside, you'll notice how the hipster of it all with magazines, different types of seating (table, bar, outdoors), and the menu itself. What's great about Bucket & Bay is they have liquor license and their gelatos have booze. If you want alcohol in your gelato, you've hit dessert heaven then. I've had their signature vanilla which I really like. The roasted peanut has nutty notes while maintaining a nice sweetness. The orange blossom is another great flavor on the menu with a floral freshness that permeates the gelato. Other flavors are a miss like the Black Label vanilla which is an intense whiskey because of the Johnnie Walker. It was way too strong and wish there was a better balance. The same issue arose in the Bourbon Peach but that one a had a better balance with the combination and was more successful. I mean if you really want booze in your gelato maybe you'll like it more than I did. Definitely check it out if you're in Jersey city.
