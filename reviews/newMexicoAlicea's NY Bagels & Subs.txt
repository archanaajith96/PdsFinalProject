The owner explained the menu and took our orders.  You could tell he takes pride in his food.The space is nothing to look at. It's a hole in the wall in an out of the way strip mall, but in my experience that is a good sign of good food.  The sandwiches speak for themselves. There is no need for a pretty building.I live out of town but will eat here again if I'm back."}, {"review_id": "ZBWthjs2FI6Lji2_n3qvbA", "user_id": "mzIOAzB3czC0Pg_trOiWyA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "I'd give them closer to 4.5 stars out of 5.0.We had the Big-Boy (14\") sandwich Cubano, and 2 kids sandwich meals. The Cubano was VERY good... hot, well made, and exactly how it should have been. The only reason I deduct a half star is that there could have been more meat on it. It was very good, but thin on meat.The kids sandwiches were well made and the kids enjoyed them. Ham and Turkey sandwiches are what they are, but the kids enjoyed them.Both meals came with kettle chips that were good. The shop is small, but clean and friendly. The sandwiches are well worth getting, and the price is average for what eating out costs. The owner is friendly, the food was made to order, and the shop was clean. I would definitely recommend them!"}, {"review_id": "W-b9hiu6WIngA4HxM5mlUQ", "user_id": "5aEpsfK9laECnMs7WcjTPQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/10/2016", "text": "I haven't had the pleasure of eating lunch there yet, but I did have the pleasure to starting my Saturday morning with a typical NY breakfast (Bacon Egg and cheese on a bagel). Let me say that Frenchy hooked it up to perfection! The bagels are fresh, not too \"doughy\" or stale. The smell of baked bread or Pernil (for the cuban sandwiches) when you walk in will make your mouth water. I GUARANTEE you will not be disappointed. If you're wanting the run of the mill,typical, blah tasting bagel, then go to Einsteins (or your local freezer). If you want fresh, REAL bagels, then Alicea's is your spot.

You go to Frenchy of Alicea's NY Bagels & Subs! This was one of the best catered lunches we've had during our annual geology field trips for the National Speleological Society (NSS - caves.org) which we have every year at whatever location the annual meeting happens to be. We had excellent sandwiches, chips, fruit cup and cookies, individually packed, all fresh and ready to go on the morning of our event. I'm not a vegetarian by any means, but even the veggy sandwiches were fantastic.

I might be a country boy but I have eaten in my share of delis. Chris made two fine sandwiches for this trip. He made a regular sized Turkey Bomb and a full sized New Yorker.The Turkey Bomb was a very good sandwich. It had good flavor with the jalapenos and whatever that dressing was. It was more than enough of a sandwich. I would highly recommend it.The New Yorker was \"Sweet\"! Some nice thinly sliced meats and cheese, nice mix of salad and oil, topped with some thick sliced meat. a very nice sub and more than enough for one meal.Nice place Alicia and good meeting you.

Best subs you'll find in this area... by far! (and I've tried them all)I'd recently heard about this place, didn't know exactly where it was, but had a craving for a sub. Having tried all the others in the area and bad luck with either poor service or \"meh\" subs we sought out Alicea's and wow - every single thing was great!The location is so easy it's almost absurd - right on the corner of Southern and Golf Course. It's a small shop front in the little sort of strip mall.We walked in and the decor was clean and simple, I imagine like a little sub shop you'd find in New York or Chicago. We were instantly greeted by a nice guy, (we'd later learn his name was French). He was super friendly, he asked if we'd been there before, we said no and he took his time to explain how everything worked - the sandwiches, the drinks, the desserts that looked so good I almost forgot I was there for a sub.I ordered a Philly cheese steak, 6-inch (can you believe they have a 14-inch too!?), a bottle of tea and he asked if I was \"ok\" with the house kettle-cooked chips and pickle that came with the sandwich... yes, please! (usually you have to pay extra for the chips and sometimes pickle)We sat as he busied away in the kitchen making our sandwiches. Pretty quickly they were at our table and all I was thinking was \"please let this be as good as it looks,\"... it wasn't, it was better! As French talked with us I ate that sub like someone was going to take it away from me (hence, the reason for no photos) - the break was fresh, the portions were prefect and the chips were better than any bagged brand. Then, the pickle - the pickle can sometimes make or break a sandwich for me - this was not a spear but a full half of a pickle in a little ziplock and it was so good I lobbied for the other pickle in the basket across the way from me.As we cleaned up to leave I was reminded of the big, fudge brownies that I was eyeing when we first ordered and he explained how everything was made fresh - the brownies, the cookies, the bagels, the lemon bars (that are apparently quite popular) and I just couldn't leave without one.If you're ever in e the area, you need to try this place - at best, like me, you'll find a new favorite sub/bagel/dessert shop and at worst you'll get a similar sub to anything you'll find in the area... but with a better pickle. Oh, and they deliver and cater!"}, {"review_id": "yemSDpqUIrAmRJ_FAN-bVA", "user_id": "JBj7QIlLI7lg4734OW7VRw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/27/2016", "text": "Awesome subs and bagels. If you've ever lived on the east coast, you miss this. This isn't a fancy place charging you for the decor and how pretty the food is arranged more than the food itself. It's a no nonsense shop with a focus on damn good sandwiches and real bagels. This is the kind of place you will quickly become a regular of, talking with the owner as he cooks up your usual. Long story short, this is a great place.
