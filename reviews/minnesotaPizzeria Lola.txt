This place gets BUSY during the evenings, with good reason. I was skeptical after reading all the reviews about Lola but my experiences with staff have been wonderful. I would like to add that the location of the host/hostess is terrible. It's right by the entrance. The first time I went, there was a group ahead of me standing by the hostess and if I stood right behind them I would have been blocking the entrance so I took a few steps back. Big mistake, at least 3 people that walked in just cut in line. I thought that maybe the first person that cut was just rude/inconsiderate but 2 more did the same thing. Whatever happened to common courtesy? A simple, \"Excuse me, sir, are you in line?\" would be nice. There were so many people inside that people were lined up against the wall by the bar, waiting for a seat. I decided to order to-go. To my surprise, they said the wait would only be 10 minutes. I ordered a Hawaii Pie-O because I wanted to try a pizza with pineapple, thanks to gold medalist, Chloe Kim. I was handed the pizza by one of the staff but the bartender that took my order thanked me, by name, as I walked away. I was blown away that she remembered my name after 10 minutes and had the awareness to catch me sneaking out while being hounded by customers. It was still freakin' cold in MN and I thought I would have been able to eat inside the restaurant but it was too busy so I decided to eat in my car. I believe most food should be eaten asap. I couldn't roll down the windows all the way because it was so cold but I didn't want my car to reek of pizza. The aroma of that smoked bacon couldn't be contained in that box. As I opened the lid, the most intense smoky flavor was unleashed, I had to take a bite. The pizza exceeded my expectations. It was strange that a pizza with no tomato sauce and pineapples could be so delicious. The crust was just perfect, it was thin but not paper thin. The top was nicely charred and the bottom had a perfect balance of crispiness and chewiness. For dessert, I ordered the build your own ice cream cookie sandwiches. Yes, the chocolate chip cookies are freshly baked/warm and the vanilla ice cream is the real deal, you can see the specs of vanilla beans in it. There is a parking lot but spots are limited. You can also park on the street."}, {"review_id": "o8adCuWCAIrMW6AntEO_sw", "user_id": "GO7aCA5Fdi_4A6044Gbnew", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Overall: decent pizza, bad luck with seatingVisited PL with my family while visiting MSP. Placed a reservation plenty early (weeks in advance) but still got seats in the front of the restaurant next to the window. The sun coming in the window felt like a furnace, it was crazy warm. Super uncomfortable. We ordered the my-sharoni. We thought it was good, but weren't blown away by it. The beer selection was decent and with the sauna we were experiencing, went down easy. The ice cream was good. The seasonal mint with some choc nibs was real tasty. The vanilla with olive oil and salt was just ok. We weren't huge fans of the olive oil for some reason. We would come back, but would request different seats, order a fancier pizza, and hope for the same cold beer."}, {"review_id": "cifLeQGdQlFrI_kh8hes3Q", "user_id": "wBlRVEP_CZtAOR6U2TxJsg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I ate here with five friends yesterday. We started with the roasted brussels sprout and sweet-potato appetizer covered with parmesan shavings. Delicious and just the right start to the meal.Based on stellar reviews of the Korean BBQ pizza, our group ordered two of those, one Forager (taleggio and mushroom), and one Margherita pizza. While we all agreed that the Korean pizza was novel and tasty, several of us preferred the Forager. My husband said the topping on the Margherita was exactly like what he remembered eating growing up in Italy. Bottom line: you can't lose here when you order pizza. Even our least-favorite was really good.We had a 6:30 reservation and were seated promptly. Service was attentive and friendly. The place is loud and crowded; conversation was a little difficult.

Just Kidding.. Not true. Storm or no storm this place is always packed.. When you finish your food, you come to the realization why that is so.  Lola offers fusion Neopolitan inspired pizza. Some of them are Korean cuisine inspired. My personal favorites are the Lady Zaza and their version of the Hawaiian which comes with bacon.. I always imagined Hawaiians would taste better with bacon..

It was a smart Saturday lunch...early and not crowded but busy. Sat outside and were taken care of by friendly and efficient staff. Roasted baby beets and arugula salad (we got parm instead of goat for the cheese) was garden fresh, light and tasty. For the pizza we ordered a special - \"Sweety Pie\" with mozzarella, tomato, local Salbado Grande (a kick ass salami), sweetie drop peppers and parm. Luxuriously layered and melt in the mouth gooey chewiness won us over. We also ventured into the Wild with the Forager (three kinds of forrest mushrooms, two cheeses and tarragon)....truly a pie from the planet of pizza god.

At least three years in between visits(I know, for shame) I do recall it being good but Lola isn't just good, it's great.  Pizzeria Lola is serving authentic Neapolitan style pizza in the heart of Minneapolis. I should use caution when I use the word \"authentic\", as I'm not actually sure it's been certified by the Neapolitan governing body(I swear that's a thing) but it's damn near close enough! A Korean running a pizza shop, can anything be more American?! Only from such a marriage can a pizza creation like the Korean bbq be birthed. Beef short rib, arugula(loads of It), scallions, sesame, soy chili vinaigrette(subtle heat), and mozz. I'll tell you what these ribs aren't short on (let's see how long it takes you to catch that, winner gets a free gift card), flavor and tenderness! On paper this is weird enough, and to be perfectly honest It isn't even the most visually appealing, but the taste bud loves what the taste bud loves. Who are we to get in the way of a good thing? This pizza gets better with each bite. These toppings may be unconventional but the technical expertise is flawless. Pizzeria Lola easily ranks in my top three pizzerias, and that's includes my recent trip to Naples. Now if we can somehow get them to offer a half and half of the Korean bbq and the boise, i'd immediately purchase the house next door.....Oh, and the winner does not get a free gift card. The winner should jump in a car and head to Lola"}, {"review_id": "0e8QaOMJftiwqFBzctOxmw", "user_id": "uZ4Hq-z_Sm_f-7epYhrH4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "This place is the bomb.  I can see why the wait even getting here at 530 it was 45 Mom wait but they take good care of you near the bar as you stand along the drink rail.  After a beer the crowd started to run over and the bar opened up.  Eating only at the bar no sitting just for a drink FYI.  The bar is the best place to sit.  You can watch the action unfold as pizzas.  Veggies, cookies and meatballs make their way in and out of the giant copper clad wood oven.  It is a well oiled machine.So next the food.  The forager and Korean bbq pizzas were absolutely amazing.  The pizzas were cooked with care as there was no liquid spots on the dough and it was crispy but just enough chew.  The flavor combo were amazing and  you could not wait to finish the slice to grab another.  I good selection of beers and wine and topped off with a soft serve vanilla with EVOO and sea salt with chocolate bibs and I could barely walk out.  What a great restaurant.  Not to be missed and should be repeated routinely!"}, {"review_id": "9UlaaTttxJYPfjL_i56XFw", "user_id": "qsML4-nPreRwZSezthwSXg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "As a Chicagoan I can be a bit of a pizza snob but Lola's showed me you don't have to be in the Windy City to have great pizza.

I love anything fusion and Lady ZaZa fit the bill. I order it without the Serrano peppers and I add bacon on top. I can't handle too much spice so the spice level without the Serrano peppers is perfect for me. I love the combination of the sausage, kimchi and red pepper sauce. Sweet, savory and spicy. It does get a little soggy in the center from all the juices, but I don't mind because the flavor is amazing.Make sure to end the meal with the pink grapefruit sorbet when they have it! It is extremely refreshing and tart. A perfect way to cleanse the palette and temper down the spice.The service is good. Went here at about 5pm on a Friday and had to wait 30 minutes for a table. They are able to take your phone number and text you when the table is ready, so I drove around and did other things while I waited. The service is fast and friendly.

Came on a Wednesday for a late lunch with a friend and was seated immediately. Servers were very on top of it. Vibe is very much casual and there's a little parking lot which is a bonus! Also ample street parking is available. We ordered the Hawaii Pie-O and the daily special called Seoul Chicken. Waiting probably about 10-15 minutes for food. I don't typically prefer cheese but am okay with it on pizza due to the other flavors masking it, but on both these pizzas, you can definitely taste the cheese, which I'm sure many people appreciate. Hawaii-Pie-O is a classic--pineapple with bacon and some green onions tossed on top. Only thing I'd say is I wish there was just a handful more of toppings. The Seoul Chicken is great. Very flavorful and has a drizzle of sauce but certainly not soggy. Had fresh thinly sliced bell peppers and onions. My favorite thing about this pizza and what set it apart from other people I've had is the crust. The dough is so yummy...crispy but also so soft on the inside while also not being a thick crust. Much appreciated.

The pizzeria is located in a little neighborhood, there's not much parking as a result but we got lucky & snagged a spot as someone was leaving.We went ahead with the open seating at the bar since the wait for a table for 2 was 30-45 minutes (on a Saturday around 2). I saw they had place to make reservations online, I didn't make one because I thought the lunch rush would've been over by the time we went. It turns out it would've been nice to have one so I'd recommend that option! Speaking of seating at the bar -- the service is actually the main reason I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars. When we initially sat down, we waited for about 5 minutes but no one came to take our order. We slid down a few seats so we were directly in front of the bartenders & got service immediately. Kind of strange, only because we were the only ones seated at the bar.Anyways, the food was pretty good. We ended up getting The Boise & Lady Zaza pizzas. The two pizzas could not have been more different!I really enjoyed The Boise because it was light, simple, yet really flavorful. Just a note that the pizza had a bit of sweetness due to the caramelized onion, but it was a great combo of gruyere cheese, cream, olive oil, & rosemary with potatoes.My husband devoured the Lady Zaza pizza. It was definitely an interesting flavor with the red sauce & kimchi with Korean sausage, scallions, sesame, & soy glaze. We could definitely taste the bite it had with the serrano peppers. I usually enjoy really bold flavors but thought they were a bit much in this pizza. Definitely two thumbs up for creativity & uniqueness though.Overall, if I were local, I would stop by at Pizzeria Lola by now & again. The pizzas were a bit pricey but tasty.

When we arrived the hostess was quick to seat us and the waitress was on her heels to take our drink order. Once they arrived she was extremely knowledgeable about the pizzas, throwing out some ingredients that I've never heard of before! Props to her! After carefully debating the menu I decided to go with the Korean BBQ pizza. While waiting for it one of my friends ordered the meatballs as an appetizer which pleased everyone at the table. Perfectly seasoned with just a little bit of marinara sauce on top!The pizza arrived and to my surprise had a lot of greenery on top. Enough to have your own side salad. Dousing the greens was a sesame soy source that once you took the first bit, made the salad on top of your pizza delectable!
