The restaurant was small, intimate & quiet. There was only two tables when I arrived.I got the lunch special which was two different rolls and it came with a house salad and an Ice Tea on the side. The sushi was good & fresh. The plate was cute and came with a little panda on it.

Got the Ariel Box and the Perfect Box..both were delicious and the food all tasted so fresh! Keep in mind the Ariel Box is 2 deep fried rolls in case you're trying to stay on the healthier side! The miso soup, ginger salad, and spring roll were all tasty...cannot express enough how fresh everything was.Had the Gyoza as an appetizer! Tasted fantastic.Really had a great dinner and was very full by the time I left.

I had a taste for Japanese Fried Rice. I was greeted and seated promptly when I walked in and the hostess was friendly. I ordered the fried rice with shrimp and I asked if there were peas and carrots (don't like either) in the rice and the hostess said, \"No.\" but she did say that there was green peppers in the rice. Green peppers?? I've had Japanese Fried Rice many times but never with green bell peppers. Anyway, I figured it couldn't be too bad so I ordered. I also ordered the spicy shrimp roll. Both dishes were not that great IMO. However, the rice had a good amount of shrimp. It just seemed to lack flavor just as the spicy shrimp roll did. I'm not sure if I'm willing to go back. Again, the food wasn't horrible but it wasn't anything to write home about."}, {"review_id": "kcbbNpfyWRh5ru9hXARghw", "user_id": "IIiDBRUG0rHz5tPSTPHQwQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/18/2016", "text": "Had my 1st visit after Hurricane Matthew hit, and it was flooded in Chesapeake. Happened to find this place open,( and yes, I'm one of those people who bought groceries, but still end up eating out, lol). I had ordered the Perfect dinner box which came with miso soup,  salad, Spring roll, and 3 rolls: shrimp tempura,  Spicy tuna,  and Salmon roll. Yessss, I'm a Sushi loverrr. It was just a perfect day to eat a perfect dinner box for a perfect person. Lol.

I've been going here for years and it's been the same waitress, so she knows the menu inside out and knows how to describe the sushi dishes and entrees. With that said, it's only 1 waitress and 1 sushi chef. Fortunately, tonight it was was 1 other table in the restaurant along with ours. I've been other times and it took an hr to get our food. I've learned to go on which dates and time wisely.Food is always good and fresh. Nice healthy portions. Chicken teriyaki is chicken breast topped with a bed of broccoli. I liked the fact the meat isn't floating in the teriyaki sauce. Volcano roll was also good. Their take on it was California rolls topped with a crab/fish meat concoction. It was yummy! Have you heard of crab rangoon from the Chinese restaurant? Well they have their own spin and make a salmon rangoon with an avocado jalapeño sauce! It was good!! Overall one of my favorite sushi restaurant!"}, {"review_id": "raeu0sNOXlqMVCY_MFRthA", "user_id": "tWRKBOBxUinPfd7fUT202A", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/24/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I gave this place 3 stars bc the food was delicious, but there were a lot of cons. First, I really don't like when I go out to a restaurant and everyone's food shows up at different times. First my appetizer came, then 10 minutes later my husbands did. Same thing with our meal. I sat and stared at my food for 10 minutes before his came. After getting his food late, only half of half of his meal was ready. We had to wait another almos 5 minutes for the other half to show. The food is great and the staff is friendly, but they need to get it together when it comes to serving the food. I would be willing to give this place one more try, but if I have those service issues again I would cross this place off of my list for good. I've given this place three attempts now. I wrote a review after the first time. second time I ordered to-go and ended up throwing it out. The fish had a really strong smell I ended up throwing it out. Third attempt: I ordered the pineapple chicken fried rice.. came with no pineapple... and my husbands fried calamari was so soggy we just threw it away. I wouldn't return here."}, {"review_id": "LI4y4ubupcPycyWy4t7fRA", "user_id": "1GLavkW9lncQscf2RyGeUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2017", "text": "This place was an incredible find. The girlfriend and I stopped off on our way to the Outerbanks from D.C.  The atmosphere was very quiet during the lunch hour and the lights are dimmed but not to the point of it feeling dark. The establishment also felt extremely clean and authentic. The sushi chef was truly an artist when plating the food and everything tasted very fresh. This is by far some of the best sushi I have ever stumbled upon. I recommend the volcano roll if you are looking for an interesting roll. It has fish flakes on the top that move to the steam coming of the grilled fish topping over a California roll. My Best Friend was also a delicious roll as well. Highly recommend!"}, {"review_id": "QORXOvOvUuLOEae30xEZ4Q", "user_id": "3VblGslI8HOBvU4L0kOhaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/26/2017", "text": "This is an amazing sushi place with an above-average presentation and awesome service.

I bookmarked this place and it's day 2 of living here. After a bunch of disappointing sushi places on my road trip, I was on the hunt for redemption. Hubs and I ordered Spicy tuna sushi and the My best friend roll. We refrained from ordering a ton of sushi that could end up sucking. If this sucked, we were gonna leave. It didn't. Oishi gained our sushi trust. We ordered Another spicy tuna sushi and a spicy salmon sushi. Miso soup. The OMG roll.
