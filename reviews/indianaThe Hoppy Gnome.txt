If you find yourself in Fort Wayne, Indiana and you happen to be hungry then your best bet is the Hoppy Gnome. The food was fantastic. I even bought some of their inventive brown butter caramel vinaigrette. It was the perfect topping for my crepes. The one bad thing was the pink \"lil' Gnomie\" t-shirts only came in size 3T. Great food, beer, and really great service."}, {"review_id": "mDmwCWpsDOF0FKX8Hp6jrw", "user_id": "FOjtQlC0IZC0Y9CuOmbytA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "A co-worker and I went here on the recommendation of our manager, and I have to say it wasn't as awesome as all the reviews promised :(The hostess couldn't be bothered to smile or be genuine in welcoming us at all. The tacos were pretty good though, despite half the meat in the duck taco turning out to be a giant chunk of fat. The drinks were pretty decent though, I love that the sangria comes in a big mason jar. We were SUPER looking forward to ordering both desserts after watching another table roast their own marshmallows for smores, but after the tacos our waiter didn't come back for over an hour (as my co-worker timed it). During this time, both the other servers that were helping our server wait on the table right next to us, didn't bother to ask us if we needed anything. When he finally came back we weren't up to wait around for desserts, which he didn't bother offering us before bringing the checks.All in all, it was a terrible experience with somewhat great tacos and I'm so sad to say this because it seemed so promising."}, {"review_id": "CIzfG7i5pm62u4jrftAOgg", "user_id": "8MWKlW6o4DZrNhJqz8U-EA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "My son and I stopped in for lunch on a Sunday. Service was excellent. Atmosphere urban, hipster vibe. Interior industrial, rustic, modern. Large beer selection. Menu has a large variety of taco options. I enjoyed a shrimp taco, and the Bob Marley taco. Both were fresh and tasty. You can mix and match tacos, choice of two or three. They were also offering a brunch menu being Sunday. My son tried the Kochi chicken do get a with dirty rice and was not impressed. The bbq? Sauce on the chicken was like a bland light brown gravy and the chicken breading tasted burnt, like the oil was old. The dessert was worth the visit. The Smores option comes with a little open fire to toast the house Made marshmallow,  and the chocolate was good quality- I'm kind of a chocolate snob. The strawberry shortcake was rustically served in a mason jar and the shortcake was a true shortbread."}, {"review_id": "mtV7BP14mSQWlDBJZw7q4w", "user_id": "iEK1xZ3cACgipw9xZuXa2A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Great place to celebrate an engagement party! One of my friends got engaged this past week so we surprised her and her fiancé with a surprise engagement dinner.I highly recommend getting the queso. It's made with chorizo and Gouda cheese and it was phenomenal. My meal was just the queso and chips because it is that good.A drink wise, their sangrias are DELCIOUS.

Nice ambiance and friendly staff. We did not get any grief for our request to split our checks. A nice, diverse selection of beer, wine, and cocktails. I had the Lady Stark as I have a weakness for 'creamy' drinks, and I was very pleased with it. The tacos were all right. I live in an area where authentic Mexican food runs rampant, so unfortunately they were pretty unremarkable and very 'Americanized.' However, coupled with the restaurant's appearance and service this is a good option for a family or a work dinner."}, {"review_id": "i-9bM9XEIUcO-6aKOq32iQ", "user_id": "p-LAgJwVcQ79gyTUJqBM2g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I loved this place I enjoyed trying new beers.

They were not very busy that night. I felt the waiter was nice though he seemed rushed to get our order and did not explain the menu or drink options.  I ordered the tacos. One was the paneer taco and the other was mahi mahi. In general, I am a big fan of paneer. So I was excited that this was an option on the menu. I was disappointed by the lack of flavor. Usually paneer is served with a good amount of spice otherwise it just plain strained curdled milk. The Mahi Mahi taco was decent. It had pineapple salsa and guacamole.  The dinner was two tacos for $9. No other sides included. I also had the Ace Cider, and I thought it tasted good.  I was glad to try this place."}, {"review_id": "wkaxsaaVMcNgv_LpPsOLxQ", "user_id": "EFcb_B5mxwrYmRSLrMZYGg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/20/2017", "text": "The Hoppy Gnome knows how to speak to this taco-loving casual heart of mine. In town for a business meeting, I hopped on Yelp to find a good spot for dinner and this little gem caught my eye for good reason. Service was fast, friendly, and not overbearing, just how I like it. I loved that I could order from a wide variety of creative tacos and wasn't limited to just an order of one kind. I had one Paneer taco (Indian + tacos? Jesus take the wheel) and a Mahi Mahi taco. Paneer + tomato in a curry is not only genius, but oh so satisfying. My 'Lady Stark' cocktail may have been a little on the sweeter side for my preferences, but the GoT reference made up for it. Overall, I will definitely be making my way back next time I'm in Fort Wayne."}, {"review_id": "U46OTHPUFG6TNwddzg83FA", "user_id": "1GE6oD7FP7McB8AI41h15Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/19/2018", "text": "Ama Carr taco plus entrees.  $13 for three al a cart taco but these aren't your average tacos.  They are gourmet.

I dig it. Finding this place was easy and parking on the street was readily available in the evening. The entrance is a bit deceiving as you almost feel like you're going in the wrong way and into the kitchen....but keep going and you'll find the door to the restaurant around the corner.I came on a Tuesday because well, it's taco Tuesday. I sat at the bar and immediately noticed it was really hot In there. Turns out their power went out and the AC wasn't working, the longer I stayed and the more crowded it go, the hotter it also got. It was borderline uncomfortably hot and I felt so bad for the servers and bartenders who you could literally see sweating. It would have been nice had they put a sign up on their door notifying patrons of this issue or at least the manager could stop by and give his/her apologies to customers as it really was very hot since it was a 90 degree day. Onto the food. I opted for the Duck Confit and Korean BBQ tacos.  Both had great flavor and were certainly not skimpy on the meat, they were packed full! The flavor combinations were unique and out of the box, which I enjoyed. Some downsides though, in the Korean taco  I got a big chunk of fat that was chewy and I had to spit it out (gross I know). The corn shells although tasty fell apart rather quickly. Maybe if they crisped them that would help. Overall an okay experience, not horrible by any means (food wise) but not out of this world either. I think the whole AC thing made it less enjoyable. I would come back and give it another shot and try some of the other interesting taco combinations."}, {"review_id": "VWouz1jW9l5bYVTFIAAjFQ", "user_id": "qj-Hw4foEm-km9SRmCaDUQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/7/2017", "text": "Thanks again to Yelp for this superb find! My husband and I stopped here during a road trip. I read several of the other reviews and saw people throwing around the category of Mexican food. Definitely not! This is more like upscale casual pub food with great beer that HAPPENS to sell tacos and tortilla chips. As long as we have gotten that out of the way...The selection of taco flavors was diverse! The tacos come with just tacos, no sides, but if you order the three taco plate, it should be a totally acceptable size for a meal for you. I would definitely recommend the Bob Marley and Al Pastor tacos.The location is interesting, how it is tucked into the bottom corner of an office building. I am from Arizona where it is MUCH too hot to dine outdoors, so I was delighted that they had a nice space to enjoy the weather. Our service was just fine. It was certainly nothing to write home about, but our drinks were never empty, so I won't say anything further about it. You should stop in here for happy hour or for a fun night with friends. It has a fun and casual vibe. I don't know if i'll ever pass through Ft.
