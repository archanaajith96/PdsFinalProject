We came here full on Sally's and we still enjoyed our tomato pie with mozzarella. This is a more cheese-focused pie than both Sally's and Pepe's, and the sauce here is more of an afterthought. Still, the sauce has a distinct oregano flavor. The crust is a bit less charred than at Sally's, so if you like extra cheese and less charring on your pizza, this is probably your place. Overall, the pizza at Sally's was better, but Modern was a very solid and delicious 2nd choice. And it absolutely beats Pepe's. Plus, there was no wait at 8 pm on a Sunday evening."}, {"review_id": "lDeIsUBnY0jRG_T1R3eplw", "user_id": "G4V9Fj3fMvLsQ3TZpYl3Ug", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "A very popular joint, I showed up Sunday evening and still had to wait 30 minutes. But on a brighter side their estimate was really accurate. The pizza was served promptly. Ordered the plain cheese and margherita with bell peppers. Both of them really good. The crust has a little salty and coal flavor which made this really flavorful.

But, it's actually okay at Modern. They tend to char the bottom a lot more than the other pizza places. Since I like it more crispy, that works out for me. But for my fellow companions, they usually do not enjoy it (\"it's too dry\"). Price is on par with the other pizza places.This place is well-known and popular, so there's usually a huge line. They have a front room, where people just stand and wait. However, it is not that big an area, and it frequently fills up. This is a horrible ordeal during the winter. Anyways, I haven't sat down in faster than an hour (usually party of 4-8), but that's not too crazy for dinner. Wish they took reservations though."}, {"review_id": "eE3Os24JHta3S4Fw88zn1Q", "user_id": "Z_aZzNx1K6HUvwR6kD2A7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "I stop here whenever I crave for pizza and modern never lets me down.

Classic style pizza with the business to boot.. you go anywhere near this establishment on a weekend and you have to prepare for a wait. I'm fortunate enough to live down the street and can carry out & pig out in my sweats at home.. You got your three (in my opinion) main pizza joints in New Haven and they're all good for a certain pie. I enjoy moderns veggie bomb and plain jane pepperoni... Last I saw they had someone tending the parking lot to help ease the pain of parking.. being off state street it can get cramped.

This was our first experience with Modern. I called ahead and she said they would be ready in 20 minutes (which I thought was quite fast). We got there about 25 minutes later and sure enough, our pizzas were ready. (5 stars for a fast turn-around at 7:45 p.m. on a Friday!) We went straight home (5 minutes away) to dig in. We tried the Margarita and Veggie pizzas.  The bottom crust on both was really soggy. I attribute this to it being take-out, although I haven't had dine-in so I can't speak to any differences.  Beyond this, the only thing that stood out was how mediocre the pizza was (especially given Modern's fame). When trying a new pizza place, we always get a Margarita pizza because they are simple and let the sauce and crust shine. In this case, neither shined. Neither had a flavor that made me say- whoa, that is really good! In fact, both fell flat for me. Additionally, I don't think the cheese (fresh mozzarella, or so the person on the phone said and the menu verified) was actually fresh mozzarella. It seemed like the same standard shredded cheese as the other pizza. Really, it was more like having a plain cheese pizza than a Margarita pizza. My experience was really disappointing. Maybe I would try dining in to see if there was a difference, but with so many other yummy pizza options in New Haven, I don't know that I would choose it over trying another place."}, {"review_id": "UdWUmZdoPSJnGOPoRmjDtA", "user_id": "nu6b6GpbSMXeQeE-u4sf0A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/18/2017", "text": "We spent a Saturday with friends on a Pizza Safari to New Haven CT to try some New Haven style pizza.New Haven style is brick oven meaning a charred crust witch can vary from a light char to burned.The third stop on our pizza safari was Modern Apizza. We had a good parking spot and could use the walk so we walked the mile to Modern Apizza to work off the first and second rounds of pizza. Modern, well looked more modern than Sally's (which really looked like it could be freshened up) and Frank Pepe which at least looked like it was cleaned daily.Modern Apizza is also typical New Haven pizza, charred around the edge but theirs was not burned on the bottom. They gave me the impression that they really cared for the customers and pizza just like at Frank Pepe. The crust is a reflection of this and also did not sog out. The sauce and cheese at Modern was flavorful and did not need further seasoning. They also had diet white birch beer. Modern Apizza came in second. I would go back."}, {"review_id": "oqXQugph3HjoJiUoyS-WZg", "user_id": "f6DvQMJ3lUgMUlsA4V6T8A", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "Let's talk costs and be objective:I am a chef.  I know food, food cost, and just about everything else restauranteurs will do to tighten their belts and separate patrons from their money.  This said, be prepared to part with your $$$ for very little substance in return.  I AM NOT in the restaurant business nor do I go out often for reasons cited below.My recent visit was a to-go order;  a large \"veggie\" bomb - only half with cheese (saved them forty cents) and sauce all over AND a medium mozzarella with mushroom and onions.  Food cost for them was about $ 5 for both pies - including the flimsy boxes.  Charge to me: $ 42!!!  WHOA!!!! The only value was the near half-cup of \"free\" red pepper flakes handed to me in a coffee cup with a lid - after my request.  The counter person was very pleasant.Specs:  The veggie bomb had a scant few black olive slices, fifteen or or so identifiable very small broccoli florets, a scatter of mushrooms, green peppers, onions, and primarily dehydrated and black-colored  minced spinach.  The sauce was not spread to the edge by 2\" and more all around, and the total cheese on the half pie was about 2 ounces, maybe 3.  At $ 3.09 +\\- lb. for mozz. it's about 75 cents worth of cheese. The pie was $ 22.75!!!!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? Well under $ 3.00 food cost to THEM!  Nothing new to be said for the medium pie I ordered except that adding a topping of mushrooms + $ 2.00 and onions + $ 2.00 the cost THEM another .40 cents.  There were 12 slices of mushroom on the entire pie.   Add 4 ounces of cheese, sauce, flour and water (crust) and we arrive at a food cost of $ 2.00 - $ 2.50 for a pie that cost $ 17.25!!  WOWZA!   Was the pizza delicious you ask ?  Not really - the  veggie bomb suffered from blackening - as many have reported here.  The cheese pie was limp.  The only thing special is the price @ $ 42!!! WHOA! I won't be back.  My hands have an unappealing smell from holding and eating Modern's sagging, droopy crust.  You cannot handle a slice of their pie without toppings (unless perhaps bound by cheese) falling off.   I have to scrub my hands with a stiff brush for two days to lose the odor.Listen:  The state of Connecticut restaurants is just dismal for the consumer: service is lacking just about everywhere and operators are lowering their food costs, skimping on quality and portions, and charging as much as you allow them too.  WAKE UP PUBLIC! Suggestion:  Yorkside Pizza on York St. New Haven.   Wonderful pan crust with a French Baguette CRISPY quality, heady toppings, sauce, and cheese and more-than-fair prices.  Ask for George the owner and let him know that the Cougar guy that worked their long ago sent you.Enjoy Folks!Ps:  My only other review for Mama's Boy in SoNo....well they closed.  Wonder why?"}, {"review_id": "uhE_AdCHb0ZDa2q0ZpDkNw", "user_id": "rAhR6ZoEjde7IKvPW7oCjg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "As far as New Haven Apizza goes, this is the best bang for your buck. I personally enjoy Modern's pies better than Pepe's or Zup's and the prices are far more economic.If you go to Modern, grab a small plain pizza to try. The plain pie is Modern's delicious red sauce with grated parm, no mozzarella. The pies here truly shine when you allow the sauce to be the center of attention. As far as general pies go, get something that matches your taste.

Constant debate revolves around who makes the better pie but lucky for us pizza lovers all we have to do is enjoy the pizza. The debate can go on forever about who makes a better classic pizza whether its Frank, Modern or Sally, every one can have their opinion but as long as the pizza is good who cares. Modern makes one heck of a delicious pizza pie. The focus here is classic NH flavors done well. The pies are made fresh and the ingredients used are nothing but the best. The pizza here is a bit thicker than what you can find at Franks, De Legnas, One 6 Three or Bar but its thick for a reason; They pack on the toppings here. The crust is thick enough to hold onto all your toppings but its still retains that light crispy chewy dough. There is good amount of cheese and tomato sauce for foundation and the fresh toppings are great. We ordered the Italian Bomb, Veggie Bomb, and Clams Casino pie. The italian bomb is just a kitchen sink of meat. Can't go wrong with that. Delicious fresh meatballs, sausage, and pepperoni topped with got cherry peppers. Amazing. The veggie bomb was the same but instead all the veggies in the kitchen. A great way to eat some greens. The Clams Casino is my favorite. Copious amounts of fresh clam and slices of bacon running through out, it really is your classic clams casino served on a delicious pizza crust with a thin layer of white sauce to meld it all together. Great pizza is served here and you can't deny it, regardless of who you're a fan of."}, {"review_id": "y2j_LZXXrEQ2jmmw6-DePQ", "user_id": "Xpk4Lj99kxRv-cEz__N6qw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "Anytime I have to go to New Haven...this is the place I find a reason to stop at.   I have been here multiple times and have never been disappointed in the delicious pizza!   My fave is the eggplant but recently tried the spinach and that is a close second!
