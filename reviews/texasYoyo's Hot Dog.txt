The easy destination would have been JonJon since it's super close by; but none of us wanted to drive there and try to find parking or to Uber there and back to our cars because that would have been silly. So we all decided to come to the original Yoyo's because (1) parking would have been much easier and (2) it would have given me the opportunity to finally have a taste of the original Yoyo's hot dog.As expected, parking was easy to find. I was able to park in the lot right across the street from Yoyo's. I remember back in the days when finding parking in the village would have caused my blood pressure to go through the roof, but this wasn't the case anymore since the night life in the village area has been pretty dead for a little while now.We walked toward the cart and sure enough, there was already a line. But the one thing that I quickly noticed was the fact that the people in line were actually pretty... sober. Unlike the drunk, loud, obnoxious people that you'd find at JonJon in midtown. The line moved pretty quickly and I was probably waiting in line only for about 5-10 minutes.I ordered three hot dogs and my total was only $12. Whaaaat? It's only $4 for a fully loaded hot dog? Dude, that's like a full dollar cheaper than JonJon hot dog!! Yeah it's only a dollar, but do the math! That's 20% cheaper! And even more, when I started eating the hot dog, I thought to myself that this hot dog was probably better than JonJon! Even one of my friends said, \"hey, I feel like this tastes better than the usual.\" I had to agree with him. The combination of the toppings and sauces that were put on the hot dog made for an excellent combination and would be sure to make your taste bud have a mouthgasm over and over.Will. Not. Hesitate. To. Come. Back.That is all."}, {"review_id": "aZzh54KuWPSowexXZxOGHA", "user_id": "sgTlS1L_xZZRR6-djIKVWw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I heard so much about this hot dog joint and I finally got the opportunity to try it out last week. This place opens at 8pm and they always have a long line. I got there 5 minutes before they opened and there were like 5 people ahead of me. The family own business runs a very efficient service and delivers freshly made hot dogs everyday. Even though the line was super long, the hot dogs were definitely worth the wait. They have their special recipe and you can leave out certain things. Each dog is $4. I would say 1-2 hot dogs is enough for a meal. :)"}, {"review_id": "eXj_uhg1zaMSag0Oz6SYlg", "user_id": "sm5XcJ7iWJxbLYkL3yxkrQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Showed up around 11:30pm on a Saturday night. I strategically decided this time would be best because everyone is still at the club(s). It was easy to find parking across the street at the parking lot.There were about 10 people on line. Oh, it also happen to be a cold night (about 40 degrees). As we approached the line the aroma had me questioning whether I would eat 1 or 2. I thought of my workout and dedication so I figured 1 would be sinful but acceptable. When I made it to the front, which took approximately 10 minutes, I couldn't help but to order 2 fully loaded hot dogs.I took the first bite and oh damn, this hot dog is so good. I never thought I would feel this way about a hot dog but they perfected it! It was so good that I ended up eating both on the spot! And ordered 3 more to go. Definitely will be back ... there goes my diet lol"}, {"review_id": "Otq5Vv-qceEsdDRBs-YnCA", "user_id": "UM07tw02DWWxq9lpKvCA1A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "OKAY, yes this is freaking good hot dog but let me just warn you, don't go there sober and watch how they make it, it's pretty scary. but if you haven't tried it yet , DO IT."}, {"review_id": "LbnFwIH9dnktmPQHYNR1Ig", "user_id": "o9jzLxOPYH760FShQydB5w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "How do I explain Yoyo's hot dogs? If I write it out it just doesn't make sense: Mayo, giant hot dogs, carmelized onions, fried onions, and a few more sauces to top it off. It's an unusual combination, but there are always a ton of people in line every time I see it open in Rice Village. Thankfully the line was short this time, so we took our chance. I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor. It wasn't too sweet but it was very savory. One hot dog goes a long way! They are incredibly rich and filling. The carmelized onions definitely had a hint of sweetness and were a very powerful flavor. The fried onions added a little crunch and were a nice addition. The hot dogs themselves, are high quality and split right down the middle. It adds a sear on every side to add some flavor. They are prepared perfectly! This is a great late-night treat. If you are in the in the Rice Village area, hop in line and join in the movement!"}, {"review_id": "dB465ej7qqiPS5EDQ2xzrw", "user_id": "9_3da6wreXuGql5m7dqovw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "fully loaded hot dog// $4 I've heard really good things about this place so when I stumbled upon it by accident I was so giddy.

So we were looking for a good dog tonight, well let me be honest, we've been looking for a good dog that was not made by us at home. We tried this spot over on Alabama a while back (no need to mention the name as this post is not about them), I thought to myself \"pretty good dogs here\". So I thought about hitting them up this evening but, my wife wanted to go another direction. We have talked about stopping by Yoyo's for about a couple of years but for various reasons, we never made.....okay so as I said early, let's be honest, we are over 40 years old, we eat early and standing in line after 8 pm for food is an activity that is past our prime lol.Anyway, we sucked it up tonight, drove over there and wow, holy food gods, I am so glad that we did. The line was not as bad as advertised is others post, about a 10 minute wait. We got 2 dogs each, wife got hers loaded, I passed on the cream cheese (cream cheese belongs on a bagel only, my rules, deal with it). The dog was huge, hot, and extremely flavorful. The toppings, sriracha, honey mayo, grilled onions ,spicy mustard, and curry ketchup (I for one have been a lifelong enemy of ketchup on hotdogs, ketchup is for french fries and burgers only, but I decided to step out my comfort zone), these toppings took my taste buds all the way to Mars. On top of that, they added crunchy fried onions, just to give the dog a bit of texture. I am not sure what the heck was in the grilled onions, I will just say it has a dash of OOUUHH with a pinch of WEEEEEE in it.So my fellow yelpers, if you are ever over in Rice U, take a trip over to Morningside Dr, get in line, get you a Dog and a beverage (they sale water and soda), head across the street, grab a seat and get ready to get your taste buds blown into outer space. This New York style hot dog stand is the truth.

Then another 10 to get the food. I was afraid if it's so good I would have to get in line again so I got 2. It's not fascinating hot dog, very generic dog you find at the gas station 2 for $3 or so. I know, because I like them. It's has some different fixings like crispy onion, more sauce than others, hence, it gives a different view of the hot dog. Overall, it's not bad, but I probably won't eat again unless I was super hungry and craving a hot dog."}, {"review_id": "bdbOQeRGyjA1yRGEPMEbwg", "user_id": "UTcteMuUaFcvWupFN5Rt8g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "We didn't get the hype over this. As newbies to Houston we were told these hot dogs were a must try, so we popped over last night  (unsurprised by the extremely long line). It took maybe 20 or so minutes to get to the front and that's when we realized there's really only one way to get a hot dog here as there's not a variety of toppings or combo choices.I will say we're a tough crowd, with him being from NY and me having a strong love for Chicago style dogs -- but goodness.

Basically you come here to get a pre-set hot dog after waiting a good 20 minute in line.  The Hotdog: what's on it? Grilled bun, curry ketchup, a hot dog, caramelized onions, spicy mayo, Siracha, salt and pepper, fried onion flakes, and cream cheese. This place has gotten popular over the few months (according to my friend). Expect to be in line for at least 10 minutes. He and his crew makes about 10-20 hot dogs at a time. Basically putting everything together and sell as people order them. I'm not a fan of cream cheese, spicy mayo, and siracha (unless in pho and beer). But since it's already \"premade\"I still bought 2. I waited out in the cold with a friend for too long to just get one!The bun was firm due to it being slightly grilled which I liked a lot. It wasn't any special bun that I noticed though. The hot dog was split and grilled. Charred on the outside and hot and spitting oil from the inside. I really couldn't taste the curry ketchup so I'll never know what that was. With every bite, I can taste the cream cheese. It was a bit pungent but I guess people like that. Now what was really interesting was the caramelized onions. I was expecting it to be sweet but it ended up being tangy. And I liked the tanginess of it. Overall, I enjoyed the hot dog despite me being a picky eater. The owner is a cool dude. You can see him jamming to his ear piece while cooking the dogs.

I used to believe that Chicago was home to the best hot dog in the universe. Thanks to Yoyo's, however, that distinction now belongs to Houston.Yoyo's was the visiting food truck at my school this past week. Given today was its last day on campus for the foreseeable future, I braved the cold, wet weather to check it out. I was kindly greeted by the lone dude in the truck. I asked him what was on the menu, to which he told me simply hot dogs. He suggested I try one with everything. By everything, he meant Sriracha, honey mayo, curry ketchup, caramelized onions, fried onions, and cream cheese. \"It'll change your life,\" he said.Man, was he right! A hot dog from Yoyo's isn't a mere snack, but a culinary tour de force that mashes up an American cookout staple with tasty Asian condiments. The meat and the add-ons meshed into a sweet, tangy, creamy flavor I couldn't get enough of. Yoyo's had chips, but who needs them with what I just described to you?The price is right for $5. I just need to remind myself the next time I chance upon this truck to order two or maybe three.
