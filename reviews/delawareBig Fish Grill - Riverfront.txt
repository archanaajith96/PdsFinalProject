I ordered the fish and chips and it came out perfectly cooked, but to top off the entire experience their desserts are TO DIE FOR. I ordered the Reese peanut butter pie and I'd go back just for the pie!!! ****the only thing I would say is to avoid the coleslaw it is way to creamy"}, {"review_id": "yzhPdh1G-CvFtLqNm2OS3Q", "user_id": "5eYM5rscKlAarV_v8DUeWQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "We were in Wilmington for a business trip and thought that a nice riverside dinner would be great for our last night in town. Big Fish has nice outdoor seating with a good view of the river and ceiling fans to keep the temperature manageable. We were here on a Thursday, which is \"buck a shuck\" so we decided on a half dozen oysters to start our meal. We ordered the rest of our meal, including two beers. The salad arrives followed by our entree but no beers or oysters yet. When we finally found our server (she hadn't checked on us since we placed our order), we let her know that we had neither our appetizer or our beers. She checked on our issue and told us that the oysters would be out shortly and would be complimentary due to the error, however all we really wanted was our order. Our waitress was apologetic about the error and we were more than willing to forget about it as our meal was excellent and we enjoyed the nice view.  We ordered dessert to go and asked for the check which she brought to us and again let us know that there was no charge for the oysters. I handed her my credit card for payment and the amount charged was $6 higher than the total of the check. It took at least 10 minutes for us to get anyone's attention and we asked to speak to our waitress or the manager who happened to be nearby. I explained to the manager that my credit card was charged for $6 more than the check total. As I was explaining this, our waitress suddenly appeared and very defensively started to explain the overcharge, stating \"oh, I know what that's about\" and tried to tell us that the oysters must have been charged despite not appearing on our bill. Initially I was willing to forget about the slow service, the delay in receiving our oysters and the beers as well as assume that the overcharge was accidental until she became visibly nervous and defense about the overcharge.  Based on her reaction, I have to wonder if it wasn't deliberate. While the food was great, I doubt that I'll return the next time I'm in Wilmington."}, {"review_id": "lJRQRULIVz6x6mvzWfYybg", "user_id": "Jp8WSVBr516eHQJ1aTyvWQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "I'm not a fish fan, so I reluctantly went along with a friend. I was pleasantly surprised with the fried shrimp tacos I ordered. They tasted fresh and were accompanied by a corn, black bean medley, which was also tasty.My friend ordered an appetizer of fried calamari with a couple of dip choices. I REALLY didn't like calamari after a couple of tries at it before, but I decided what the heck since he needed help polishing them off. I shockingly found them tasty and (darn it) ate too many of them. Of course, that's not Big Fish's fault, but my lack of good sense.We sat at the bar and were served by one of the bartenders who was friendly and helpful with suggestions for food choices.All in all, this (almost) local place is one of the bright spots on the Wilmington Riverfront and well worth the trip."}, {"review_id": "wMf-TlRgf6VFDP_EwdQdJg", "user_id": "LR5KLo9TkFbuLTUnQXz0xA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/2/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Came with my two dining companions for the Easter Buffet and was very excited about the menu. It was very well rounded with seafood, chicken, ham, two carving stations, sides and desserts of course featuring the chocolate fountain.Highlights for me were the oysters ( of course) the crab imperial the shrimp salad and the blackened sea bass. The low lights were the prime rib and lamb. I'm a medium rare person and these meats were just too rare even for me. The lamb in particular was practically raw. Everything else I tried was just okay. The tip was included automatically and there was a 90 minute time limit but we never felt rushed and our meal lasted about two hours."}, {"review_id": "_bQuz7ttdX-sit3YyvsRQQ", "user_id": "WrmUzCpfiwU7_kW5MEDqyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "Great experience! How many fish decor on the walls is too much? There is no too much.The decor is nice, a little kitsch, with lots of fishes on the wall. There are a lot of tables and an outdoor eating area. The service was great, never without a full glass. They start out with an appetizer of crackers and a tuna spread instead of bread, which was unique and a lot tastier than I expected.The dishes are a decent price for seafood, but most your entrees are going to run at least $20. We got a couple of seafood dishes, one with a white sauce and one with a red, and they were both delicious and filling (huge portions.) We did have enough room to try the pecan apple cobbler with cinnamon ice cream, which works amazingly well with cobbler, much better than vanilla.There's plenty of parking, the food was good, service was great, and I enjoyed the atmosphere. It's a good deal for what you get."}, {"review_id": "3xbtFwf7nvYGk_GQak9G9A", "user_id": "vN9p3qvr3eSCvLkl0uHJAw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This place is great for fresh seafood and everything I have had here is good!

Unlike the cioppino in San Francisco, there was no lobster in it, but it was full of mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops, and fish over linguini.  The best cioppino I've had outside of San Francisco. Kelley, my server, was pleasant and most accommodating. I'll definitely be back for more meals."}, {"review_id": "RgpXoEuhge7qF8PX4lvMGg", "user_id": "e9lql_OkhiUX5F5NwyQ_oA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "This is probably of one of the best restaurants in Delaware.

My first time to Delaware and first restaurant and it knocked my socks off. Started off with a pomegranate martini which came with a little shaker to pour yourself, loved that!We ordered a small goat cheese salad to start which was simple and delicious. I then ordered a bass special, it had risotto and I substitute asparagus for the spinach. Holy moly I don't think I've ever had fish so tender and grilled to perfection. The sauce they drizzled over wasn't too much and added the perfect amount of flavor. The risotto was also out of this world and when taking a bite of the fish and the risotto together it was heaven on earth. Maybe my west coast pallet is not used to this good of fish but if I have to fly to Delaware to find it, I may be booking another trip soon  My boyfriend ordered the scallops and I tried a bite and they were good as well (except I definitely won the best order of the night but who's comparing). The next time I find myself on the east coast, I am finding a Big Fish to eat at again!!"}, {"review_id": "wIRR-o6lfFeiUzxoy5p1Gg", "user_id": "5uWz5_PITe7Kjfeoo5z77A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/7/2017", "text": "Located on the Riverfront, this is one of my favorite seafood restaurants. This place is huge! I feel like the restaurant itself is an attraction for the Riverfront. There's also outdoor seatings, which is perfect for a cool summers night, you can smell and feel the breeze from the water.Service here is fast and efficient, although it maybe a bit confusing if you enter from the patio instead of the front, sometimes the hostess doesn't come to you for awhile. That aside though, the main draw here is the food, which is amazing.I've had a few items from the menu and I will be back often to try out more. Here are some of my favorites: Baked oysters, Rockefeller and Big Fish styles, grilled Sword fish steaks on roasted portobello mushroom cap and pasta, crab cakes with mashed potatoes and dirty rice.The Baked oysters are great, they're tender and golden crusted on top. I like it both styles but Big Fish gets some extra points because it has bacon and mushrooms in it. The sword fish had a terrific grilled flavor to it but was a bit light. However, the portobello mushroom cap eats like a beef steak. I kid you not, if you close your eyes and took a bite, it would be a juicy, meaty, steak bite, it's that good. The pasta was also great, cooked al dente and soaked in their cream sauce. Our crab cakes were huge and paired perfectly with the rice, which came with andouille sausage. Everything here is great, I also recommend the cocktail shrimps. For dessert, we had a peanut butter cake. The slice of cake was gigantic. It was so decadent was thick. It could easily feed 3 people.This is a really cool spot to dine out on the River front. There are a lot of choices on the menu, everyone will find something to like. The price could be a bit upscale but the food quality is worth it. Stop by, it will be a special meal every time."}, {"review_id": "wLGVVb5nfLvVle1ZKUjqJA", "user_id": "Sa4bVsvKjrVNAC5lx51MNQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "What can I say, great place.  For the Rockfish and it was fantastic.

As soon as you walk in, you smell the aroma of salty freshness of shellfish, in a good way. Shellfish and fish sitting on ice, waiting to be ordered, picked up, then prepared and cooked in their bustling kitchen right behind. Not only were the portions huge, everything we had was delicious, and downright fresh. Just to name a few: Fried Calamari - perfectly fried-- crispy outside, tender inside -- paired with house made marinara sauce and homemade mustard. Fried Oysters - again, fried perfectly, you can taste the  juiciness of them oysters just shucked right before going into a lightly seasoned batter,  then right into the fryer, served with homemade tartar sauce. Lobster & Shrimp Fra Diavolo - angel hair tossed in a bold lobster + shrimp spicy red sauce, my favorite dish of the night.  Big Seafood Pasta of the Day - lots of shellfish, and scallops cooked in a creamy white sauce, then topped over linguini. Bread Pudding - gotta end the meal with their warm bread pudding smothered in a luscious sabayon sauce, topped with cooked apples and whipped cream. The list of items on their menu is impressive, which is rotated often, therefore,  you may or may not be seeing the same plates again. Also enjoyed the ocean themed decor with sea creatures hanging above all around. Our lovely waitress,  Maya, made sure our first stop in Wilmington, a welcoming one. P.

Monday also happened to be this location's \"Crab Special\" night (scheduled for the evening, we were there for lunch).  I ended up getting food poisoning from bad crab in the crab cakes. They might have a crab special to off load some of their inventory -- eat at your own risk. Having been to 2 other locations I can say this location's food was well slow subpar: the tuna appetizer served was fishy. The crab cakes were more like finely shredded crab mayo bites -- they were small, no lump meat crab to be found, and burnt on the bottom. The Peruvian shrimp rice had 2 pieces of unclean rubbery shrimp (intestinal track intact). The broccoli was steamed to the point of mush.
