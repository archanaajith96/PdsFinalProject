Fantastic Japanese food at great prices. The bento box is a great value. Great service on top of everything else. Seriously cannot recommend this place enough. Update: super busy tonight, but the food was so good, it was worth the wait. Reaffirming that they are our favorite place to eat."}, {"review_id": "Xe-POg0l2qYC5sF4KduiXg", "user_id": "S601-21BPZKMSIeS0BJ1gg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "We came here at 7:00 on a Wednesday evening with a group of 6 adults and 2 children. The place was very busy with no open tables. Luckily, our friends had gotten a table. Our waiter was eager to help get a high chair (we didn't need one) or a fold out car seat holder (I don't trust those). We declined both. He then took drinks orders. When he brought everyone's drinks, the table was offered saki bombs. Since I can't drink beer, I declined but the others partook. Looking through the menu, I knew I was very limited on what I could eat due to my current diet. I had just two questions for our waiter and he seemed annoyed to need to answer them. My husband ordered the beef yakisoba (a favorite of his here) and a miso soup. I ordered the medium sashimi. Our daughter would eat some of the yakisoba. The rest of our table had maki rolls, Nigiri, and yakisoba. The yakisobas came out quickly. The sushi took a while longer. My husband and daughter enjoyed the yakisoba. My sashimi was very nice cuts and thick too. They definitely didn't skimp. Since it's chef's choice, I asked what each of the fish were. I knew it was red tuna and salmon but wasn't certain if the other was white tuna and then I had no clue on the last one. So I asked the waiter. He told me all the Japanese names so I still had no clue what the last one was. Throughout dinner, the table was offered some more saki bombs. Once we were all complete, we were given Andes mints and our checks. There was a discrepancy which was quickly addressed. A big plus, diaper changing tables in both bathrooms!The only reason I didn't give five stars is due to the waiter seeming annoyed to need to answer questions. Otherwise, it was a great visit."}, {"review_id": "aOat48r3otQULElDURaHZQ", "user_id": "WY7eIBVcc305Zp5IB2YcSA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Akebono is a great spot to grab some amazing sushi in Des Moines! Be sure to get there around 11:30 as the place does fill up over the lunch hour quickly! So we went all out and tried 5 specialty rolls: the Fiji Roll, the Surf and Turf Roll, the Iowa Roll, the Malibu Crunch Roll, and the Dragon Roll. I will say my favorite roll hands down was the Fiji Roll!  It's full of Kani, cream cheese, tempura, snow crab, unagi sauce, spicy mayo, and topped with spicy tuna! If that isn't enough to make your mouth water I don't know what is! The pieces on the Malibu crunch were enormous! The Iowa Roll has pulled pork in sushi? Sounds gross but is pleasantly tasty. Needless to say if you are getting the itch for some amazing sushi you should swing on over to Akebono for an amazing meal!"}, {"review_id": "q__I4QS38lQB3_og9gDd4g", "user_id": "FCS1X3lqZwm8tyL0lz_dkQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/8/2017", "text": "By far this is the best sushi and more restaurant in Des Moines.  Usually when we go to sushi restaurants, we only order sushi.  The other dishes are so plain and common.  However at Akebono 515, the other dishes make it a very hard decision. The ramen and udon noodle dishes are truly tasty.  The burgers are a-mazingly good.  And the sushi rolls and sashimi options are a true master piece.Having been here 5 or more times in the past year, i have tried a lot of dishes.  It is one of those restaurants were I have yet to find my favorite because everything I have tried has been so good that I am afraid I will miss the ultimate dish by not trying something new each time.  Luckily, I have always come with someone else so I've been able to get a taste here and there of many more dishes.  So if you're looking for sushi, come here because the rolls are creative, tasty, and fresh.  If you are looking for great Japanese fusion dishes, come here because the know how to fuse ingredients together to make a tasty explosion in your mouth."}, {"review_id": "Xlm0m2c7K-jwuSiryqHjVA", "user_id": "YzjroiYF6kjLhWlFt3gwQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/5/2017", "text": "I want to give this place a 10,000 star review. I frequent here and its one of the few places where they know my name and what i usually order. The sushi here is top notch. I typically order the Nonsense, Spring Roll (sushi roll), and the spicy salmon, but every once in a while will order off the happy hour menu or an entree/bento box.

I wasn't a fan of their gyoza. The flavor and texture are lacking. Their presentation is fantastic. Their sashimi is excellent but I don't much care for anything they use their sushi rice with - I prefer a wetter rice. However, if you prefer a stickier, drier sushi rice this should def be on your list of places to try (which you will likely love).  The rice is really just a matter of preference so I'm still giving them 5 stars). Their ambiance is really nice too. All in all a very pleasant place to eat even when it's bustling, which it almost always is."}, {"review_id": "Em0KpUzwWgsW_RlqB2qTHg", "user_id": "IDX9lEb1ydspYnqUKICcLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Came back for the fourth time, and I was really excited. When you're that excited about a place, it can easily not love you too the expectations. I hadn't been in about a year, and have eaten a lot of sushi since then. Akebono did not disappoint.

The coating was crispy and the shrimp/sauce combo was on point. This time we got the nonsense roll and it was way better than the other roll we got last time.

All rolls and entrees come with a miso soup and a salad - neither was really anything special but it was a nice touch to have them. We tried 2 different specialty rolls - the Tazmanian salmon and the akebono roll. Both were good but the cuts of fish weren't very generous and didn't seem particularly fresh to the point where it melts in your mouth, as some other fish does. It's located downtown and has a great atmosphere and was fairly busy even for a late lunch on a weekday. Another plus is that they offer some sandwiches for non-sushi lovers that are pretty straightforward but with an Asian twist and are actually really good. I definitely recommend checking this place out but would try to come for their happy hour next time."}, {"review_id": "6-b0bupIXv2gGAbFiUie7w", "user_id": "giHpAUst1j2KKKY2vqkL1A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "Great food at a decent price.

If Nick is bartending, he already has a beer waiting for me as I sit down at the bar. If you're having a rough day, he'll spot ya a sake bomb or two. The regular staff here, Stephanie, Matt, Nick, etc., are always warm and friendly. I love unagi, so I absolutely love their Fargo and Zee Zee rolls. Their Captain Crunch and shrimp tempura rolls are also fantastic and always come out looking so great that you don't want to eat them. Even if you get a single roll, they ask if you want soup or salad with it. They have great soy and ginger dressings. The chicken or pork katsu rice bowls are very good and filling. Shrimp tempura comes with a delicious sweet and salty sauce. Their edamame comes with a soy-garlic dressing that leaves you licking the bowl.The interior of the restaurant is pretty laid back with dark colors and dark wood tables. They have original East Asian inspired art on the walls with a fish tank behind the sushi bar. Sometimes they have classic rock playing, sometimes elevator music. It's quiet but can get loud during peak hours. This place sees a lot of regulars - my favorite is Danny, an older gentleman who walks around, swirling his glass of wine and chatting up other patrons. It's a great place to go to after a long day at work."}, {"review_id": "FR-6EFY6HMPWT_f87BwLmA", "user_id": "xU7_JH-rUeGrHUe8ubGbnA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Great food and friendly staff 2nd Visit here, traveling for work nice relaxing evening"}, {"review_id": "dhC-jqhCNPNAIWzR99FeIA", "user_id": "LUuGASAaJb7UnyuIKlinQg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/29/2017", "text": "Sometimes a bad experience overshadows an otherwise decent experience. It's a beautiful restaurant and I went with a group, The ambience was good with a lot of other groups there to celebrate a special occasion. I can't eat raw seafood, so I asked the server for a recommendation for one of the cooked rolls. I explained that I can't eat raw seafod, but I did NOT need any special accomodations, such as having my roll prepared on a separate board. I am not allergic to seafood, just uncooked seafood. Think of it this way, it's all raw while being prepared on a board while it's cooked. Once raw, now cooked. No separate board needed. Yes, I'm overexplaining this because the chef didn't understand. He sent the server back to my table to relay the message that I shouldn't come to a sushi restaurant on a busy Saturday night with special dietary restrictions. This was AFTER I ordered as-is off the menu, no changes. I sent a message back with the server that I didn't need any accomodations.The Miso Soup was good, The salad was fresh and just the right size. It came with a mix of dressings, and I can't remember the two types of dressing but it was really good.You don't want my business on a Saturday night, even when I've ordered off the menu with no substitutions, you don't get my business ever.One of the rolls that arrived, had a terrible fishy smell. Yes, it's sushi, but it shouldn't stink and it did. No one at the table could eat it, because of the stench. The other roll was tasty and I really enjoyed it. The two that I ordered were the 515 and the Oh Snap. I'm not quite sure which was which. The server brought both rolls without indicating which roll was which. My dining companions enjoyed their rolls and some endamame, I go to other sushi bars in town and have never had a chef send a server out with a message and my non-existent special needs and I've also never had a stinky roll anywhere else.If we had not been there to celebrate a birthday, I would have had a conversation with the manager or the chef, but I didn't want to ruin a special night out with friend.This was a one strike and you are out situation. I won't return to Akebono 515."}, {"review_id": "R9LRB2HkqN-hd4aV3Icxmg", "user_id": "ZhPr42Rx94JMszFxtB3aBg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "Love this place!
