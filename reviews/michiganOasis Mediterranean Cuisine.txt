I am not being dramatic. I am being quite literal.My husband and I ordered carryout from Oasis, with me having had a good dine-in experience about a month before. We got it home and set about enjoying our meal when my husband bit into a French fry only to begin gagging and spitting. His face registered a look of horror as he realized what had happened. He began wiping off his tongue on a napkin, walking with his carryout container toward the trash and gagging the whole way.I asked what was wrong and he told me that the fry he just ate not only smelled, but also tasted like straight up FECES. POOP. SHIT. He then brought the remainder of the fry over for me to smell. That is EXACTLY what it smelled like and I was completely horrified that he had actually ingested that. I set about giving him a big dose of probiotics, as well as some ingestible anti-bacterial essential oils. Fortunately, he only felt a little queasy the rest of the evening and didn't get any sicker than that.What would it take for a French fry to taste like poop? I cannot even begin to imagine. And with a rash of Heptatitus B and C cases popping up in Michigan, this is a very serious cause for concern! Are their employees not washing their hands? Is something more shady, gross or sinister happening? Either way. I have never, even at the worst of restaurants, actually had any food smell, let alone TASTE like feces. I am completely disgusted and will never return."}, {"review_id": "oLBYRHKRpBHgB-5Ki5Xf7Q", "user_id": "Hopu0veqnain_Mik4Xz4XQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "I tried this place with two friends for a work lunch date.  They were extremely busy but we were seated quickly.  Their menu is smaller than what I am used to, but makes sense given the small size of the place and how insanely busy they were.Each of us ordered a lunch special with Chicken Shawarma- the lentil soup was very good and I really liked their hummus.  There was plenty of food for the price and the chicken was tasty.  Towards the end our service was a little slow- I always get stressed when eating out while at work because we have an hour lunch and I don't like to be late getting back.  It took a bit for them to bring our checks and cash us out."}, {"review_id": "TBYRguCxIlqSAryqKP-2WA", "user_id": "BuVltJ-G9sPWVnEgolSHLw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "I'm going to preface this by saying I am completely spoiled by our frequent trips to eat out in Dearborn.

That being said, I wouldn't recommend the soups or salads because they didn't have much flavor. The garlic sauce tasted a lot like mayo. It didn't have that authentic garlic flavor you'd expect. If I was blindfolded and asked to taste the garlic Id say it tastes 95% like mayo and had 5% of garlic in it. You just don't get that garlic flavor from it. The only thing I did like however was the chicken cream chop sandwhich. I would get it again if this restaurant was my only option.

Very reasonably I believe it could be prepared.After all that you might wonder how they earned four stars?  Well, the answer lands squarely atop the fresh made lemonade!  Their competitor frequently loses out on my business because of this specific offering AND the much more relaxing environment, genuine customer service and ample parking.My closing remark is regarding the condition of the restroom.... immaculate.  I've been known to wait just to use their restroom vs the one in my office because it is that much cleaner."}, {"review_id": "exR4eUdxk_-FyznMuWJysQ", "user_id": "v3I4KRguBNcy5kFM8kTnIw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "We were the first customers in there for the day.

Over the past several years I've never been disappointed with the food here. I've only dined in once or twice but even on the phone the Staff has always been courteous and friendly. For the first time in a few months, I picked up a carry out this evening and for the first time ever I was soo disappointed. This place typically has the kind of food that leaves you feeling super satisfied, and hardly lasts a day in the fridge. The kind of food a person craves, you know?The go to for my order is typically: chicken and hummus, with a big side of rice, and a fattoush salad. And of course the bread and garlic, too sometimes I add on a wrap to have for lunch the next day and this was one of the times that I did. Something has unfortunately changed about this place. Everything from the hummus to the salad and bread was lackluster, unfortunately, and this time there was nothing redeeming about this order at all. Each item lacked it's usually satisfying flavor - which feels so weird to say about this place. I hate to say \"everything\" but for this order it does apply. Even the garlic has changed, and honestly was pretty blah which I was totally shocked about. Even if there's one thing that isn't great, no matter where you go -  the garlic is usually a no-fail in Mediterranean cuisine especially for this area. I honestly have never been this disappointed with an order from any Mediterranean restaurant before now, and it's likely I won't be returning here. For their sake, I hope this place gets their game back together."}, {"review_id": "8H-AcafLo09P5Zr30yCZ_w", "user_id": "aFSj36n-q5kE7GgCWs13SQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/9/2016", "text": "I used to go out to lunch almost every week to a mediterranean place across the street, on 12 Mile, but it randomly closed one day. So, the next best option was Oasis.I've heard of it before and wondered what it was like, so it seemed a good alternative. At noon on a weekday, this place is packed. As is customary at such establishments, you are provided with pita and garlic. The pita here is fresh and tastes great, as does the garlic. Thumbs up.They have lunch specials that are all about $8.50 if my memory serves me correctly. I ordered the chicken shwarma and lamb, which comes with rice/fries and soup/salad. Pretty sweet deal. I opted for rice (goes better with the meat) and a fattoush. They charged me an extra dollar for the fattoush, not sure why but at least the waitress told me beforehand.The food was delicious. The platter was huge. Literally half your plate is composed of rice, and the chicken and lamb portions are more than adequate. The meat was cooked well. I didn't even finish all my food; just too stuffed. Pro tip: mix the garlic with the chicken/lamb and rice.I came in hopeful and left satisfied. A little on the pricey side, but when you consider how much food you can inhale and the leftovers you can eat the next day or two, it's a good spot."}, {"review_id": "-9JlofvaDvC9_lXEyMiI6A", "user_id": "C6oK8GTolZG9FWNvlEmHlw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2017", "text": "First time I've ever come to this place was probably when I first moved back last year, and I'm shocked I never wrote a review about it. A buddy of mine suggested getting some mediterranean food and we came here. When you walk into the side door you see their little patio area that for outdoor seating and then you walk into the main part of the building and the first thing you see is a little juice bar that they have. They do custom juices here that will blow you away and make you want to get one every time. First time I land of getting a chicken falafel and some hummus and pita. The hummus and pita here is to die for they also give you a garlic sauce and a type of salsa for your pita. The staff is always so friendly here and just great with knowing their products when you ask questions. It is a small location and sometimes can get pretty crowded so I would recommend trying to get here a little earlier than lunch or dinner time.

He was the perfect amount of friendly and professional. My co-worker wanted a dozen extra pita bread to go along with his to go order and our waiter immediately told him it's on the house. How nice!They started us off with pita bread and a side of their garlic dip and salsa. The salsa threw me for a loop but it worked with the pita. I personally love La Saj's garlic dip because of its KAPOW garlic flavor that just hits you. Theirs wasn't as potent but it did the job okay.Anyhow, I was saving room for my tabbouleh and chicken sandwich. No complaints. It was delicious and I pretty much killed it.One of my co-workers got their special of the day lamb and green beans and I took a bite of that and that dish was soooo good. What a steal as it was under $10 for quite a hefty portion. The lamb couldn't be more tender and the sauce it was sitting in was complex, slightly sweet and married perfectly with the green beans. It tasted like the ultimate comfort food. I imagined some grandmotherly figure in a flower apron slaving over a hot stove to lovingly make this dish. My co-worker had initially planned on taking half of it home with him but it was so good he finished the entire thing.I also ordered something to go. The shish kafta and a small order of tabbouleh. The tabbouleh was fresh and they don't chop the parsley as fine as other places which is fine with me. My only complaint is that they need to find better containers for the tabbouleh as it kept seeping liquid out and completely drenched the paper bag it was sitting in. The waiter replaced that for me and it completely drenched the second bag also. Watch out for that!I am definitely coming back here and instead of going with the typical chicken shawarma, I might take a second look at their specials as that's where they really shine. Prices were on the whole cheaper than other middle eastern joints I frequent especially factoring in the generous servings."}, {"review_id": "WekSXR9GiYtCT6BVRodX1Q", "user_id": "0lyi5XdVkhb6U828N3C-rw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/8/2017", "text": "3rd times a charm to confirm this place is sub par and not worth another trip.
