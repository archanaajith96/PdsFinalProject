I tried the criossant flavour which I thought would be gross but turned out surprisingly interesting and it was nice to have bits of real croissant inside. Our server was really nice and didn't pressure us in any way so trying to decide a flavour was a stress-free process.I did like the coffee a lot too. In the end I got the chocolate which was super rich despite not having much cream and the pistachio. I don't think you'll be disappointed by any of the choices you make here."}, {"review_id": "aZQQ4L8WNQdRMVg8KRSQ3g", "user_id": "O08SQfteO4AJa7jWEfK_dA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Pappalecco's gelato was the best I've ever had, but their cannoli was the worst I've ever had.... hence: a mixed review. I had a scoop of the Pappalecco (which was a delicious amaretto flavored gelato) and a scoop of the pistachio. Both were fantastic. Very soft and smooth gelato that was just sweet enough. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!The cannoli was such a disappointment. The shell was stale and the filling is grainy, too sweet, and filled with dried fruit, which I don't care for at all. Not an appetizing bite whatsoever. I'd love to try others of Pappalecco's pastries, as I'm hoping the cannoli was a fluke. I'd be back in a heart beat for that gelato, though!"}, {"review_id": "HS7K2fZG6ru8YDrbVepG-Q", "user_id": "k6ytDC7QS3CGkp9xR1PIcA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Love this great neighborhood gem!My go to item is the quiche.

They have a huge range of flavors but my favorite would have to be pistachio! If you don't know what to get try as many flavors as you want, the staff here is super friendly and don't mind.There is both indoor and outdoor seating so you can sit there and eat or you can grab it togo and take walk to enjoy the amazing San Diego weather. Prices here are average about $5-$8 depending on how many scoops you get. They offer other things like drinks and sandwiches here too. Definitely worth the trip if you are in the area."}, {"review_id": "OsyVsRyySpN2fCOdKsageA", "user_id": "49GGtp_JCxUvff1gL8jC2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "One of the best gelato places I've been!

I only tried the gelato (pistachio & mint chocolate) on a waffle cone. The flavors are pretty spot on, both were pretty creamy, but the pistachio was more on the dull side.You can try any gelato flavor you want, and I suggest you do since it's almost five bucks for a double scoop."}, {"review_id": "FNN4AaiL7_L14mNpXq7JxA", "user_id": "ei_hHnxUpAbDGV6kp8kx9Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "3 stars because the place does not have napkins. We ordered the mousse cake and it was really good. The cappuccino wasn't that good, at least for the price they're charging for. I went to look for napkins and couldn't find any. When I asked the employees, Â they said we are out! When the drinks were ready no one called us to let us know that the drinks are ready. I had to go and check. The employee didn't say that we have to come check later to get the drinks. Hard to find parking even on weekdays. Staff are nice but I think they need more training on customer service."}, {"review_id": "bavtZ9fVAqMUQ0TyarSQnw", "user_id": "PKHAhqrysye-rqk9sX87rw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "By far, the best lemon gelato I've had in San Diego!

The shop is so cute and they offer a wide variety of pastries, sandwiches/paninis, coffee, and gelato. My boyfriend and I just got 2 gelatos because we just had dinner, but everything in the store looked amazing! They offer a lot of gelato flavors, ranging from the chocolate side to the fruity side. I got 2 generous scoops in a cup -- hazelnut and Pappalecco -- and my boyfriend got a coffee chocolate chip in a waffle cone. The gelato was so soft and smooth and the coffee flavor was very strong. The Pappalecco is a mix of chocolate, cookie, and amaretto, and you can definitely taste the amaretto. They make their gelato with only 4 main ingredients, and you can tell they take a lot of pride in their work! The workers are so patient and friendly and the store itself is super authentic and has a warm ambience. I highly recommend this place if you want a quick dessert after a meal. I'm excited to come back and try the different pastries!"}, {"review_id": "d_0NcJk3Fsk3ws2pYVDBwA", "user_id": "lbIwMDpHCIANVoYwgsH69w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "Just stopped by for a quick grab for gelato to walk with on a sunny afternoon and I loved it!!!

We stopped in one morning during a stroll through SD's Little Italy neighborhood and had our expectations pleasantly surpassed! This little shop on the corner doesn't look like much and features simple counter service with a few tables (both inside and outside), but they put out some amazing goodies and have incredibly personable staff! I had one of the BEST lattes of my life here-- I would return just for the coffee! My breakfast croissant sandwich and my partner's pastry were both flaky and delicious and really hit the spot on a lazy Saturday morning. As someone who is picky about European-style bakeries, I can vouch that this one is legit!"}, {"review_id": "35064Uyy4fA8lu6CXI_dYA", "user_id": "b9M_FLehSRyCKZaV7GdPSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "So friendly, the cannoli is AMAZING!!

Their delicious, creamy, gelato. And the friendly service we received from the lady behind the counter. She happily provided flavor recommendations and samples, and was very patient with our indecisive selves.We came here after dinner, so we weren't too hungry but needed dessert. So we ended up sharing a two scoops of gelato, coffee & chocolate and Nutella. SO GOOD.They have a few, smaller tables inside the establishment, and can imagine it getting really busy. We arrived on a quiet, Wednesday night, but by the time we were leaving, there was a bit of a line.It was definitely worth the stop, and it made for a wonderful end to our first day in San Diego."}, {"review_id": "NQrfSzKI__HZ7Cp0vxGwKg", "user_id": "EpAiAAZFpahoQroXhFaVbA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Delicious alfogato with distinct gelato flavors.

VERY meh. I stopped by here for a cannoli. They were all out at the counter up front so the kitchen made me one fresh. The cream filling was very good: sweet and plentiful. But the cookie shell had no flavor and a stale texture. And it was $6.25, so not the cheapest around. I should've gotten the Apple turnover; it looked tastier and was bigger. I won't be back here. Antonelli's deli in El Cajon has much tastier cannolis for almost a third of the price."}, {"review_id": "0ZpOdUOMoPkeHYuJrTv-nw", "user_id": "B6O7PaF75VBA96GpPqxabQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Back to one of my favorites!!Excellent staff, very friendly and hard workers.

Â So we find ourselves in San Diego California at a place called Little Italy, we were there checking out the Mercato and came across this little coffee shop/bakery. It was almost love at first sight! As you walk in the door, you see all of the pastries, sandwiches, and other delights like gelato. The ambience is very homey but there's very little seating inside. Having said that, there's plenty of seating outside. Â It definitely reminded us of our time in Italy.Francesco, the gentleman at the counter, was about as Italian is it gets! He gave us a standard Italian welcome in Italian! Buongiorno ragazzi! And from that point on we were hooked! He was very helpful and pointed us in the right direction on what we should get. There are also several Â people behind the counter that were just as attentive and Italian.I know this is going to sound strange but I ordered the ham and cheese quiche (Yes, a quiche at an Italian cafÃ©) and a ham and cheese croissant. Â Both were nothing short of amazing and did I mention the coffee? It was absolutely delicious! We both had cappuccinos, one with whole milk and the other with Almond milk, both were done just right.Next time we come back to San Diego we will definitely be returning to this little cafÃ©! So, in other words, we absolutely recommend you try it!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pappalecco-san-diego-2?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
