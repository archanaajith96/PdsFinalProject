Their food was exceptional and the staff was engaging with Southern hospitality. Our last few visits have been less than stellar. An hour plus wait on the weekends is a given ... and Scrambled used to be worth it. As the service has declined the desire to wait 60 minutes has wained. Today the staff was incredibly rude while we waited to be seated. Space is at a minimum but to harass waiting paying patrons does not lend to an enjoyable experience. Three different staffers pushed us around in a styles ranging from passive aggressiveness to just plain harassing. All while we were waiting to pay for our overpriced drinks at the bar. To be treated as an inconvenience as you are dropping $100+ is not the way to peacefully brunch on a Saturday or Sunday morning. True \"Foodies\" who are looking for the total experience of food and ambiance... try Print Works just down the road - great food, friendly service and better price points."}, {"review_id": "5EjnpbAbJDy-txiJw9BzxQ", "user_id": "8XJ7DpZhQrzxNIJDRShf5A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "Traveling through Greensboro and tried this spot for the first time, giving it two stars. If I could try it again , I would.Ordered a breakfast platter with pancakes, cheese grits, turkey sausage and scrambled eggs. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for eggs, so I left them where they were. The turkey sausage was two good size links. Maybe I wasn't as hungry as I thought, or just wasn't motivated to eat them. The pancake was VERY large and VERY good. The cheese grits were as cheesy as they come.The location is near UNCG I believe, tucked away, and has very little parking. They have a take-out entrance and regular entrance. Other reviews give me the impression you have know what to order."}, {"review_id": "NmYo-1Ngi-yY9ViqVUsI4g", "user_id": "9vRqTspIAQGCkRBvMR9wXA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Scrambled is a great brunch spot in Greensboro with lots of options and a creative menu. I have been wanting to go to Scrambled since they opened, but my many attempts were foiled by the ridiculous waits. My fiancee and I had an opportunity to go grab some brunch on a Friday. I figured this was the perfect opportunity to finally go to Scrambled without a wait; I was wrong. On Friday at 10:00 AM we were told that there would be a 35 minute wait. Luckily they have a cool link where you can see how long you've waited, how long others have waited, and how many people are in front of you in line. This makes the wait seem more bearable. Also, luckily, our wait turned into 15 mins instead of 35 mins. The best thing about Scrambled is the food (which is always a plus for a restaurant). There were lots of menu options and it was very hard to choose. It is definitely a place that you could come back to dozens of times and never repeat a meal. I landed on the breakfast burrito (chorizo, black beans, cheddar, eggs, salsa verde, wrapped in a jalapeño tortilla) with cheesy grits on the side. My dining partner got the Green Eggs and Ham Scramble (chorizo, scallions, quest fresco, salsa verde, and chili lime crema) with a biscuit. The breakfast burrito was just about perfect. The chorizo really makes it, with its flavorful spice. The jalapeño wrap was a great addition, and the eggs were cooked perfectly. It was also constructed so well that nothing fell out or dripped down my hand as I was eating it. This could be because I scarfed it down so quickly though. The cheesy grits were very good, but they were almost too thick (which is not something I normally complain about). You will find no runny grits here. I tried a bite of the scramble and it was almost just as good. The biscuit was perfectly cooked and buttered. The biscuit is something that you have to get down pat at a southern diner, and they have done it. Our service from our waiter was fantastic: well mannered, attentive, and nice. Unfortunately all of the staff do not seem to have this same attitude. The hostesses all seem like they don't want to be there. Another downfall is how cramped the space is. I know that there is only so much you can do about this when you have a constant stream of patrons, but the tables are so close together that you can be distracted by other people's conversations on both sides of you.The food here is five stars, but the constant long waits, the mixed attitudes of the people working there, and the cramped atmosphere bring it down. Scrambled is worth the hype. I would recommend going to try out their delicious dishes, but just be prepared for a wait."}, {"review_id": "795RF13T6zZYyT8daQf7UQ", "user_id": "IrKJqpwjBy1kw8lgnlyIzg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "This place is a hidden gem in Greensboro. It's hard to find a good brunch spot in this city, but Scrambled has exceeded my expectations. Despite having a long wait, I love the fact that they ensure they follow up with their guests via text or phone call so you don't miss your opportunity to get seated. They also had a great wait staff. Our waitress was a true southern bell and full of so much personality. She created our experience at Scrambled. The food was delicious! I ordered the fried chicken and waffles, cheese eggs and hash browns. The chicken was crispy just how I like it. Everything else I had was delicious. My friend ordered steak, an omelette, pancakes and cheese grits. He loved the cheese grits and pancake (which is enormous btw). He wasn't a fan of the steak. He asked for it to be medium rare and it was more on the rare side. They also forgot the cheese in his omelette. Nonetheless that didn't take away from our experience. If you're in the Greensboro area, I highly recommend you check this place out. It's worth the wait!"}, {"review_id": "IOZlvAzayYtLTzXhcNyk6A", "user_id": "Ide_6_sPxFwlNUNsNgeeBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "The wait is long, but worth it in my opinion.

I had French Toast, bacon, scrambled eggs and fruit. It was wonderful.

Then he said he will put us back on the list.  Right after that a nice waitress offered us drinks and about 10 minutes later we got seated.  Food is delicious and worth the wait.  I had the green Benedict so yummy.  Wait staff was so nice.I would give 5 stars but the host left a bad taste to start the meal."}, {"review_id": "f94Nbw1BgqJwY6XbCxDdvA", "user_id": "naJXY_b5couK1atEGUgfmw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "8/6/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Food is good, so some of the negatives may be worth to accept.It is crowded and no place where to wait.

There is never a time of day when a good breakfast meal unwanted.I ordered the green eggs and ham and opted to have it scrambled vs an omelet. My dish was served  over hash browns so they delivered my food in a skillet, and I also had whole grain toast on the side. The toast itself was delicious and flavorful, and I used their homemade blueberry jelly to complement the toast(if they offer please try it). The skillet itself was immensely flavorful. The addition of the chorizo is what gave it that extra flavor in my opinion. A dish that you can mix altogether is perfect.
