Their coffee has always been good, but their espresso drinks are seriously great. They experimented with offering food for a while, but that was a kind of a bust. Now they have hired a very talented baker and offer freshly baked scones and muffins and cookies. I would say that $3 for a slice of lemon bread is expensive--and it is--but they have day-old baked goods for half-price. Apparently they have also just branched out into offering homemade ice cream but I haven't had a chance to try it yet. So those are all the pros of Becks, and they are substantial enough to make me go out of my way to have coffee there whenever I'm near downtown. As the business has grown, the owners have changed the layout of the place, replacing comfortable seating with hard metal chairs that I hate, so that's one downside of hanging out there. Starbucks did that too, to prevent people from camping out. The second problem is that when the place gets busy, there is a serious bottleneck at the register/drink area. There's only one till, three pour-over stations and one espresso drink machine, so not only can getting served take a long time, but it is possible for the barista to completely forget to make your drink! Third problem is there is STILL nowhere safe to lock up bikes, and it's actually a little worse now with the long picnic table on the North side of the building."}, {"review_id": "v2ktj6tOT7CE9KLUUipSiQ", "user_id": "6-9evNGg4cvnnGjEmsXFIw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Great coffee, free WiFi and scones that will have you coming back.

The first place I tried was remodeling. The second place I hit was closed without explanation. By the time I got to Beck's I was VERY eager for some morning joe and a bit irked that I'd wasted so much time scrambling to find an open shop. And then when I walk in they're packed. Some political type explaining how exited he was over a recently opened border crossing. Blah, blah, blah, give me some bleepety bleepin' caffeine!I finally get my drink and take a sip and my attitude immediately begins to change. The iced mocha was absolutely perfect. It was so smooth and so subtly, sweetly impressive that it changed the face of the morning. It's probably good for me that I had some driving to do. I liked my drink so much that if it'd been a lazy day I likely would have downed the first iced mocha then dropped another $5 on a second one."}, {"review_id": "D9zkaoUY4QCzv_wZH13xMA", "user_id": "H-5r-0NKP_kR6nvppGOnxg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Great find in Las Cruces.

Very cute, good amount of seating, and clean and tidy. Don't know if the lady who assisted us is the owner or an employee, but regardless, she was very sweet and made our drinks to order in a timely fashion. I had a triple soy warm latte and the boyfriend had a hot cocoa. We thought about buying the last two brownies from the BOGO day-olds bin, but our jeans are fitting a little tight. It was a tough decision to put them back!"}, {"review_id": "-P0tmbLcHxkC-LZxfNyNhw", "user_id": "v18Vr_qZJW0-p2dciSfWKQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/12/2017", "text": "An amazing surprise discovery on my drive from AZ to The Lincoln Nat Forest in New Mexico.
