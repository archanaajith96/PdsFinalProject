We walked in mid afternoon and were about to get a bar spot, otherwise the wait was about 20 min, which is fine for a Saturday.I got an American Dream Sandwich. Needless to say it did a fantastic job of soaking up some Drinks from next door. The Brisket/bacon/cheddar/Texas bbq sauce combo is delicious.... so delicious that I almost forgot to snap a picture for this.We also added some waffle fries covered in nacho cheese... needless to say this is great stuff.The beer list was pretty thin, and I had to wait for a keg change out. Not that big of a deal as everything by the staff was communicated great.The Result: This place is a great place for some low money great BBQ comfort. The bar/seating is relaxed and the bartenders are friendly. It's at times a little loud, but I would recommend this if you are in corktown area for sure."}, {"review_id": "jH5b921cLJwlKdB7J6qOrQ", "user_id": "sRgUNhjBIy90P2zOjrRgIQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "No idea what the big deal is. Ribs were pretty much on the not so tender side and bland. Sauces were meh. Pulled pork was dry. Apple smoked chicken was dry. Brisket was decent.Enjoyed the sides.Good service.Wait was FAR too long to think about returning, given the quality.

They offer an awesome selection of meats, sides, and drinks. There are some days the meat isnt as good as other days, but regardless it's always yummy. My personal favorite here is the pulled pork - I haven't found another version of pulled pork I like more! As for the sides, I'd recommend trying all of them to find what you like, except for the fries. The fries are boring. But are fries what you want when you go to a BBQ place, anyway? NO! You want the Mac and cheese, Cole slaw, sweet potatoes! Not the fries! So get adventurous and try new things :)There's usually quite a wait here, so I also reccommend making a reservation if possible. Especially for large groups. They also won't seat you unless your whole party is there, and if not everyone arrives at the time of the reservation, you have a 15 minute grace period for everyone to arrive. If not everyone is there by then, you will lose the reservation.But this place is a good one, not my absolutely favorite ever, but definitely a place worth trying and going back to!"}, {"review_id": "_Z0XD3E0IbNZj-rzAPRBlg", "user_id": "923tuudrN2hDnXQs7umF7A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "You must go when visiting Detroit! A friend recommended this place for dinner and for good reason.The first note I want to make is that the portions are GINORMOUS. I ordered the trio which came with a quarter pound of beef brisket, pulled pork, and apple BBQ glazed chicken breast, along with your choice of two sides -- go for the corn bread and mac n cheese! Surprisingly, my favorite was the chicken breasts, which never happens... but dat marination was on point doe. I was sick to my stomach because it was a lot of food... but it was sooo goood I hate to clean off my plate. I would definitely recommend splitting it with another person or having self-control and asking for a take home box. The second point I want to make is that it was a very fun atmosphere. They were hosting trivia night when I went -- the MC was hilarious and diners were so into it. Slow's also has a lot of beer options at the bar."}, {"review_id": "iXhq_n44jdgSVIEPGetfBA", "user_id": "cMpJ-KeY2l4D7ZiSEk_tjA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Ribs were tender and seasoned nicely , macnchesse was cheesy and creamy . 3 meat pulled pork was a little dry, but chicken was seasoned and tender, brisket was sliced nicely a little on the fatty side but was good and tender.

Slows is a Detroit BBQ icon and lives up to its reputation for great BBQ. Located in Corktown off Michigan Ave., Slows is located in a beautiful building and was restored to show off the beauty from its previous days. Slows started serving up their award winning BBQ since 2005, and the line out the door shows you that it's a great place to eat! The place gets packed on the weekends, but we came in on a Tuesday right at 5 pm before the dinner rush began. I've been here twice before and the Mac n Cheese is a staple item I have to get every time I come. We decided to start with the Brisket Coney Fries. Which are waffle fries topped with brisket, fresh chopped onion, jalapeños, bbq sauce and cheese sauce. Absolutely delicious! My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork with a side of Mac n cheese and coleslaw and I went with The Big Three Combination platter - pulled pork, beef brisket, apple bbq glazed chicken breast with a side of Mac n cheese and potato salad. The beef brisket is absolutely my favorite menu item aside from the Mac n cheese. The apple BBQ sauce was our favorite from the selection we bought a bottle to take home with us. I've had the cornbread here before and it is delicious. The banana pudding is a great way to end the meal! Overall a great restaurant in the area, and a must try when you're in Detroit! Their beer selection is great, great a growler to go!"}, {"review_id": "QHgfB4-7pTCpNKL70yuH8g", "user_id": "CLCDt1COwxOdUpWuqbJmdQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Hands down, the best BBQ around!!

The brisket fries were pretty moist, and cheesy. The mac and cheese was fantastic and I would definitely recommend them. I liked the big three, especially the apple bbq chicken!The one flaw with the place was thatt I was not crazy about their bbq sauces. The only one I was a fan of was the apple bbq sauce. There was a mustard one but I'm not a fan of. A spicy one that was not that spicy, and they were all very liquidy.Still a great place with great food but a bbq place has to be judged on its bbq sauces."}, {"review_id": "BjTnY-tclry2CBzTKcgjGQ", "user_id": "85SG4dYU8bO1m1hVt2tMbQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "I'm well pleased.

Portion sizes are very generous here (especially for dinner), and prices are reasonable.  I definitely recommend making a reservation, because otherwise you could be waiting a long time for a table.  Some downsides: parking is scarce.  Thankfully, we found a free spot in an auto repair lot that was a two minute walk to the restaurant.  It also gets pretty noisy inside.  However, the excellent food more than makes up for any shortcomings."}, {"review_id": "o2GB6w1QoTkwMfdlP_oqOg", "user_id": "4at7nQuf5ifaKMGSC3DtCg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "It's way too mediocre to me.

After I saw Slows BBQ featured on the Travel Channel several years ago, it was a box on my checklist of places to visit the next time I was in the area. They serve more than just barbeque though as there are burgers, hoagies, salads, sandwiches, and cajun/creole items (e.g. gumbo, jambalaya) on the menu too.I selected a cup of gumbo to pair with a Yardbird sandwich. The latter was a finalist for the best sandwich in America so I had to try it and see what the hype was all about. While waiting for my order, I taste tested each of the six bottles of BBQ sauce in front of me on the counter (seasonal, apple, sweet, mustard, spicy, North Carolina). My favorite was the seasonal which was a sweet sauce made of beer and chipotle. That is not a combination one would come across often, if anywhere.The gumbo was a decent representation of what you would find in New Orleans. The Yardbird... yummy, as the pulled smoked chicken was moist and sauteed with honey BBQ mustard, mushrooms and cheddar cheese then topped with two pieces of applewood smoked bacon on a Kaiser roll. I'm glad I made it downtown to visit Slows BBQ and experience one of the best sandwiches in the country."}, {"review_id": "s7wOdHAK6Z3k23di39XieQ", "user_id": "9KpMzih4E_gEioFtNeuIIw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/10/2017", "text": "The mac and cheese in this place is the best I have tried.

Before I continue on this review, let it be known that I love Detroit. I feel it's made out to be a horrible place full of criminals, when in reality, it's not. It's true, Detroit has struggled for a while, but it's making a comeback. The driving force in this comeback-- food!When you go to slows, a thing to be aware of is the homeless population. There are a lot of homeless people here, which is just something to be mindful of. As soon as you walk in to slows, you feel an atmosphere change. It goes from this edgy area to a warm, friendly feeling. The restaurant is somewhat clean, but you're going to get dirty eating the bbq anyway. Service is great- the people are super nice! Since this is a popular restaurant, the wait is usually an hour long, which stinks, but the food is worth it. The food is so tender; the ribs fall off the bone! There is a wide variety of sauces you can put on your food. I suggest trying them all, then picking your favorite. I mix multiple of the sauces together, making a deliciously sauced-up snack!!5/5"}, {"review_id": "KaRt4NDInzVNNrCXER4Kyw", "user_id": "mqalKHyQSlFfonSq9yJVkQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Good place of you want bbq.

The food speaks for itself, but I'll add some words to help it out. Definitely higher quality than other Barbecue joints around the area, and it arrives pretty quickly too.
