I always love coming here and worried we have to wait for the long wait time.  The quality in food and cooking is absolutely amazing!  We come often for the breakfast, which is amazing as always!  Everything on the menu is great!  Coffee, omelet, waffles, pancakes, and etc!  I love coming here and its the best small breakfast place in JC! The food, service and the cozy atmosphere makes this a 5 star restaurant hands down.  The only negatives-the orange juice is not fresh! It tasted something from a box."}, {"review_id": "sBGiSwnzcAiatukCQhDZ9Q", "user_id": "jNYTFVDmrfGcczVz444S7w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Adorable brunch spot in Jersey City! The interior decor/open kitchen make for the perfect brunch setting. The menu has a variety of sandwiches & plates to choose from. I ordered The Pimento breakfast sandwich w/side of potatoes and my date got the Chicken & Waffles. The house pimento sauce inside of my breakfast sandwich had the slightest kick and was what made the dish for me. The egg inside the sandwich was also cooked perfectly. The Pimento had a choice of either coleslaw, fruit, or potatoes..I opted for the potatoes and they were well seasoned.My date's Chicken & Waffles was tender and tasted just like Thanksgiving! The cranberry syrup was a unique twist, the chicken gravy was out of this world!Glad I found this spot, definitely will be back in the near future to try out more items on the menu."}, {"review_id": "wajZ2Kn9aZYGpK5kw-lJrA", "user_id": "cun967dZl0Q9nMwg_riaIQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "This is a great spot for breakfast and brunch. I've been here many times and my favorite part is that they serve brunch styled foods every single day of the week. And everyday they usually have delicious specials. It's a small little spot so It does get packed very quickly on busy days.Their coffees and specialty lattes and drinks are great. Today I had the caramelized onions and butternut squash omelette which was tasty along with a coffee (a little over $16, $20 including tip). Came with a side of sliced potatoes and bread which were both delicious. They even make their own homemade hot sauce which is also great. Portions and quality is worth It here. Staff are very friendly and food comes out very fast. I've had several other dishes here including huevos rancheros, chicken and waffles with a cranberry and gravy sauce on top (one of my favorite especially cause of the sauce and the fact that it's pulled chicken and not fried), pimento egg sandwich, and various grits specials. Have not yet been disappointed and will be back again. This place is a must try!They also serve salads and oatmeal for the more health focused people."}, {"review_id": "iulEbMbgqFvoYj1K-PzSWw", "user_id": "QXopAH1VtSWPQ5ifSFgZ8Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Nah, Ive been looking for a boutique style brunch spot, and Sam a.m hit. There was a wait outside, so I knew the food was about to be good, and that it was about to be small lol.... The place is small, but I was still feelin the setup tho. I sat in the window lol The food was for real! I had the biscuits and gravy, and the gravy base had this rosemary in it. Poppin! And, i'm always all up in peoples plates and everybody else's food looked good too lol. Definitely a step above the diners and pancake houses that Im used to around here.I liked the staff too, they were cool."}, {"review_id": "XHOh486yillUfbsg6oS4_g", "user_id": "_k12-gP0LZJcWF-oAdnsZw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "I was very excited to finally try this place for brunch after hearing all the great reviews. Unfortunately my friends and I were let down. While my omelet was pretty good, I had asked for avocado to replace the bacon. The waiter agreed and when it arrived they had indeed left out the bacon and given me a cup of brownish mushy avocado. Ok, I know avocado gets brown easily but this just didn't look great and why did I have to put it in the omelet myself? Then to top it off, when I got the check they changed me an extra 2.50 for the avocado! I mean if I had known it was going to be an extra charge then I wouldn't have asked for any avocado, it wasn't that important, I just didn't want bacon.Furthermore, my friend ordered a biscuit on the side and it came out cold and without butter. She had to ask for it to be heated up and have butter.Then another in my group ordered the chicken and waffles. While the flavor was good, the dish was basically swimming in gravy so it was overpowering and did not look very pleasing. The portions were not huge but the prices were very reasonable and the coffee came with free refills. Sadly I don't know if I'd come back here unless it was just for coffee and a pastry to go."}, {"review_id": "RuOy40sQRzmo9XlPWC8OKQ", "user_id": "ew2BP5Yo2yJI5o4-jrokQQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Came for the brunch, stayed for the delicious lattes. The space is very small, so if you've got a large group or are super hungry, be prepared to wait, or bring a snack with you.I decided to be a hipster millennial and try the avocado toast, since that's not really a thing in Boston. It comes on sourdough bread, with a side of two sunny-side-up eggs. I liked that everything, including the eggs, came with seasoning. The toast was nicely buttered and chewy, and the avocado came with red pepper flakes, which added just a bit of heat to every bite. I tried some of my husband's omelette (he asked and they were able to accommodate his order without bacon), and it was really tasty - I liked the cheese they melted on top. Our server was very friendly and attentive, and was nice enough to check with the kitchen when we wanted to swap out items on the menu.The best part of our meal, though, were the lattes. I don't know which roaster they use for their coffees, but our drinks came out absolutely perfect. We went back the next day for more lattes and thoroughly enjoyed!"}, {"review_id": "Vcnd4zNHfJLNURCg3I3Slg", "user_id": "m5fNVWQFfgOj-sAXBxeBSw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "What I think is happening is places that are more suited to being a cafe are trying over extend to being a cafe plus more and suffers a bit in the process. That goes with space, food, offering and service. All that reminded me of that here. The space is cafe-esque with the small more intimate space but after seats are filled theres hardly any standing room. If its nice outside that's fine but when its not its quite cramped. That's not exclusive to here though. The menu is small also like a cafe offering a few things presumably that are done well. Being a very big chicken and waffles fan i thought I'd give it a go here especially after the staffs recommendation. The Sanam take on this entree is more of a Thanksgiving style with baked chicken rather than fried with gravy and 'cran' syrup. Sounds good and it wasn't bad, but could've been better. The food was doused with gravy and with a drizzle of syrup and could hardly taste it. The coffee was pretty good  bu. On the high end -$3.xx.  the meal while I appreciate the style could do with less gravy and more syrup for starters. The staff was ok but some seemed way more experienced than the others which is fine but the green in a couple of the new ones stood out."}, {"review_id": "_hROY132bw0x5FEtgq5jRQ", "user_id": "1ZFOZV7zA-6yZFZWoZSwxA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "We came here on a Saturday morning. The place is fairly tiny with a rustic decor. We were seated at the bar where there was a huge pot of tomato soup in front of us. The service was awesome, but the food was just ok. We ordered - chicken and waffles: creamy style. This looked very unappealing and the taste was just heavy with dry chicken. The waffle was soggy. It was recommended by our waiter. - pulled pork, salsa Verde, up eggs over grits. This was fairly good, but the pulled pork could have used a bit of skin to give it some crunch. - cappuccino: too much milk and not enough espressoTldr; I really wanted to like this place but this was disappointing.

Over the years, this place has gained some incredible traction and it wouldn't be surprising if you'd have to wait for more than 30 minutes to get a table for two on a weekend. Amongst the positives, I'd like to call out the fact that this place manages to hold it's own \"small business\" feel amongst the many swanky joints coming up in  Grove Street area.I've tried out the \"Pimento\", \"First Date\" and the \"OMELET DU JOUR\" and all of them have been absolutely fantastic. Their mocha is supreme while maintaining the exquisite taste of chocolate without compromising on the expresso. A huge shout-out to the freshly squeezed \"OJ\" which surely hits the ball out of the park.Amongst the disappointments, I've observed the staff to be rather lax with respect to seating. While the whole practice of writing people's names on the door before giving them seating is cute and very much adds up to the small business charm of this place, it also makes the process painfully inefficient. On one such occasion, there was a slip-up where our names went unnoticed and we'd waited for more than 40 minutes to get a table in spite of being the first ones to arrive. It doesn't help that there are only as many seats at this place.Would have given a 5 if not for the sole disappointment but I'm hoping to have a chance to update this review :)"}, {"review_id": "sv5sVWPbroMLW-fzFwnvww", "user_id": "xxzqdck_y4aHXcYq3K1AYg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Great little brunch spot in Paulus Hook!

I stopped by on a weekday morning and this place was happening! It's smallish but charming, with more commuter-friendly space up front and small dining area towards the back for more relaxed meal.I had the chicken and waffle because, that's what you do when you see that on a menu... and it was interesting - unlike the fried chicken and waffle most people are used to, this was chicken with gravy on top of the waffle so the crunchy element was missing. But, that was not necessarily a bad thing because the gravy went real well with the soaked waffle. In case you might want a bit syrup, just pour it on the side! I also had a berry scone which was crispy, a bit smallish, but tasty. Really liked their coffee as well. Menu had many other interesting lunch items too.

I thought it was odd but then ordered the sausage and biscuits which did not disappoint. My friend ordered The Classic and we both shared their Belgium waffle.All of the food was so delicious and there were no complaints about that.

Since my last visit, I did go with just one another person so were seated quicker, the vanilla latte was on point, the service was great, and the food -- I never had an issue with the food from the start-so it was delicious! The last time I came by, I met Sam. He took our orders and chatted with us for a few minutes. He was super passionate about the menu and what sam a.m focuses on.

The eggs were perfectly made easy over, not over packed with lettuce and tomatoes (but tomatoes should be sliced thinner), and sauce.Drink: 1 star: I had the cappuccino which was more of a latte and Luke warm. It was also spilled all over my cup holder which I had to ask for another holder otherwise it would drip all over me. Waitress should have known this up front but just dropped it off and walked away. Service: 3 star: I was greeted warmly by a lady taking reservations for a seat. She gave me options of being put on a list to sit inside or ordering out and sitting outside. I decided to be seated inside. Since I was by myself, I was seated quickly.  My food was also delivered quickly.Ambiance: 5 star: the place has a quaint and cute vibe. However, it is VERY small and gets crowded. They do not take reservations over the phone so coming here with a large crowd is not recommended.  Also, I got extremely lucky and found parking right in front of the establishment, however, this is really not the norm in this location.

Bit cramped but seated immediately at 10:30 on a Saturday Morning. Got the classic breakfast sandwich. Bacon and bread were fantastic. Would recommend adding an extra egg (eggstra) and arugula would have really rounded it off nicely. Potatoes good too. Partner had the French toast with a berry compote that looked amazing.One thing: not to pick on this place because it seems to be creeping in a lot of places. I am not at all down with the \"here's the iPad, I'll stand over you while you tip\" thing. Tipping is fraught enough in this culture. This feels very much like a pressure tactic even if it's not meant to be (possible?). I'm a good tipper and this makes me want to tip less, sorry. So maybe bring some cash orderto tip discreetly.

It's a very cozy little spot. There was a bit of a wait when we got there, which is to be expected. During the wait, I noticed the manager discreetly trying to tell the cooks to get the orders right. This happened several times. It wasn't as discreet as she thought because all of the patrons standing there heard. After they sat us, the waiter immediately took our order. He told me all about the grits of the day: shrimp and grits. It sounded delicious so I went ahead and ordered that. My fiancé ordered a simple egg sandwich. When the waiter brought our food, it wasn't what I had ordered. Apparently the waiter either took the wrong order after we had a discussion about the grits, or the system had an error. Either way, my food wasn't ready. I got a few different stories so I don't know what the truth was. The manager came to my table and apologized for the inconvenience. I then saw her ream the cooks out, again! This place was so small that I could hear everything going on, and saw all of the behind the scenes drama. I felt bad for the chefs. I felt bad for the manager. It was an all around uncomfortable situation. The food finally came out and it was decent. I won't be visiting this place again."}, {"review_id": "klb1gbC5Cwuu99Hb7s8nYA", "user_id": "UWPD2xK8aQYTImkV6Os0HA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/24/2017", "text": "There's usually a line outside for brunch on Saturdays and Sundays. When you walk in the space is pretty small, the front counter is also where the kitchen/cooking space is. I don't know about anyone else but I found the set up with the refrigerator by the front door and the open kitchen next to the cash register kinda unsanitary and a little dirty. Anyhoo, the menu is pretty simple, a few breakfast items and some sandwiches. We ordered the breakfast BLT and the chicken and dumplings and got a cold brew and latte. My latte was served in a very pretty mug BUT it was lukewarm and for almost $5 I expect the coffee to be at least hot! The cold brew was also kinda weak and flavorless. I recommend, since they sell Stumptown beans to buy the beans, go home and make yourself a decent cup of coffee.As for the food, my BLT which including an egg - the egg was on one side of the sandwich and over cooked. I love BLTs but this was by far a sub-par one. The Chicken and dumpling was ok, the biscuit was not fluffy and buttery but more hard and flavorless. Let's just say I was not impressed by the food at all! It's one of the few places to grab breakfast in Paulus Hook so I understand why there's always a line but the food and prices are definitely not worth a regular visit. Our 2 dishes and 2 coffee with tax and tip was around $50! I suggest trying White Star which is near by for brunch instead, they also have a better BLT."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/sam-a-m-jersey-city-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
