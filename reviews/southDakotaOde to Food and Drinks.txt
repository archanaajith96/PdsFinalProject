The food is outstanding. Due to our travels and the sheer amount of \"eating out\" we do has given me the opportunity to be a self proclaimed burger connoisseur. The burgers are outstanding here! Cooked to perfection, juicy, and crazy flavorful on both occasions. Seriously in the top 5 for in my 12 state territory. On our recent visit my fiancée ordered a salad and it was lacking a bit of nuts and cheese, the bartender apologized (not his fault) and rectified the situation. Good on ya!  The ambiance here is also wonderful, relaxing yet upscale but not in an exclusive way. Great food, great service and decent prices. This is definitely a place we will visit yet again when we travel though the next time."}, {"review_id": "nJQIA93VRrDb1DL1SNwG3g", "user_id": "4ZOAqjSSzFnH-Gr1zDxzCA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "I've been here for lunch in the past which is awesome for river views during nice weather. Just went for the first time for dinner. Drinks: Bacon Old Fashioned - way too sweet.  Had to ask for another shot of Maker's Mark to make it palatable, the original Old Fashion was better.  They do have on tap local bears and good selection. Appetizers: Was here with a group so ordered just about one of everything.  The pork egg rolls were superb.  The hummus was very good.  The risotto balls were interesting - not my favorite but not bad.  We got chislic with and without the breading - both were very good and *might* be the best chislic I've had since moving to SD. Meal: Most everyone got the steak - some were pleased, others not.  2 people got the Sea Bass - one loved it and the other not so much.  I had the scallops - the crepes stole the show, and the scallops were very good.  I don't normally like scallops but had recently tried some at Parker's that were good - these didn't disappoint. My husband had the burger - the fries with that burger were AMAZING and a lot of the steak orderers were jealous of the burger. Dessert: I didn't have any dessert but others did.  The table-side-flamed Crème brulee was impressive. Service: We had a large group with people coming and going along with a take out order.  She did a great job with timely delivery of drinks, refills and food.  Had great service for a group our size."}, {"review_id": "yOmceu9-6e6Cdbtf5uYJzw", "user_id": "EtiuPt7W4bOC_bTXMokx9w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/13/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "If I could give it 3.5 stars I would but the food was decent.

For a list of reasons why, continue reading. Literally the most awkward experience I've ever had at a restaurant. It's inside an office building but there's no signage out front. Once we figured out how to get inside, we walked in to a nearly deserted space (this is a Thursday night, mind you, and they're open until 11). We were helped immediately by the very nice bartender and my Paloma cocktail was delicious. We had the unique opportunity to be in the restaurant while the owner was there; it was an unfortunate experience. His young son was running around flashing cash at the staff, bugging the musician while he's trying to play, wandering behind the bar, being truly obnoxious, but the owner didn't bat an eye. Bad parenting aside, it was terrible management. On his way out, he left his whiskey glass at the far end of the bar out of sight of the bartender (but most convenient for him)...skeevy. Beau and I almost left then - it kills me we put money directly in that guy's pocket - but we didn't.Food was O.K. Risotto balls woefully underseasoned although the sauce (cherry? strawberry?) was quite tasty. Per Beau, the chislic was also underseasoned although cooked well and, again, the accompanying peanut sauce was tasty. Flatbread was good but very, very small. Like personal appetizer size, if that's a thing. Additionally, we were quite literally the only diners in the restaurant but everything took forEVER! We were needlessly there for an hour and a half; I was pretty much crawling out of my skin waiting for our entrees. Per the decor and the live jazz music, I get they're aiming for classy/upscale but the restaurant falls quite short of what you'd expect from the aesthetic and menu prices ($26 Vietnamese noodle soup?!? Get the pho-ck outta here!!). 1 star for the friendly, helpful staff working under the aforementioned ownership and 1 star for my veggie burger with cheese sauce but, again, I can't stress enough, I highly recommend you spend your money elsewhere."}, {"review_id": "VZt2FTJNzpGiZAKtyDE3xQ", "user_id": "EOdGgOWltBwSlTmM85iZtA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/15/2017", "text": "We came for a Friday lunch... driving and camping, we were very underdressed, but Ode took us in, fed us a generous and delicious lunch and treated us very well. The patio has a lovely view of downtown and the river languidly moves along its banks to the Falls.  It took a bit to find Ode, yes, it's in that big business building.   Rez had the lamb burger and the cucumber salad.  The Cherry/walnut compote added another dimension to commented Dr R.  I had the Max Burger with sweet potato chips.  Massive amount of perfectly executed chips.  Burger was very good with cheese, bacon and French fried onions... superb! Service by Rachel was outstanding as she gamely refilled our drinks and brought more of that sweet ketchup, even though she had an 80lb door to the building to deal with.  Poor girl, we were guzzling like desert camels, but she was unfailingly sweet.Bathrooms were dazzlingly clean. On the way out of town, we drove by s really cool park where we took at least a hundred selfies with the Falls in the background. Thanks Ode and Souix Falls for a great lunch break!"}, {"review_id": "Bugr9Wpg06ZVvVVa4LNIBA", "user_id": "fgPKy6bcfSms6YqkX17ZOw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "Great food and service all around.

Started with the Ghost Pepper Cheese flatbread...crisp, nice spice, well-cooked bacon and just the right amount of red onion. The small salad with balsamic vinaigrette was nice but a bit over dressed. Entrees included the Drunken Tortellini, the Guinness Brined Pork Chop and the Szechwan Duck Breast. All were nicely seasoned and cooked to order. The noodle salad served with the duck was on the bland side but the duck was delicious.Had a tasty apple crepe brûlée for dessert, really good!

And, if I'm honest, I would normally take a few cool points off for the name of restaurant. Ode to Food & Drinks? Doesn't it seem a little much? As it happens, it doesn't matter, because clearly I didn't dock them.I tried to find this place earlier in the week, but didn't see the sign on the glass, so ended up eating something subpar. Just know that you're in the right place, and it's in the building at the end of the traffic circle.I can't remember my server's name, but she was informed and provided great guidance and very attentive.My colleague had the gumbo, which he ate so quickly and found so delicious, I caught him trying to surreptitiously swipe at the remains with his index finger. He also had a half cubano, which he found equally wonderful with \"the perfect amount of mustard.\"I had the blackened tuna sandwich and roasted sweet potatoes. The sandwich was PERFECT. The tuna was just right, the produce was fresh, the bread was soft, and that avocado aioli was the perfect way to tie them all together. Sadly, the sandwich was so well assembled that I ran out of room for the sweet potatoes, but I took with me even though I was headed to the airport.The bad news is that I dropped the sweet potatoes trying to get my suitcase on the scale. The great news is that next time I'm in Sioux Falls, I know EXACTLY how to find this place."}, {"review_id": "PxiBiMAIwHMI9YVJaucAPA", "user_id": "-35qz7Hxzv1o-9AxMXHxrw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/29/2017", "text": "I have visited Ode many times.  We had dinner there Sat night with my entire family and the place was packed.

Special call out to our server.  She is and has been our waitress many times and is always a delight and truly cared for us the entire eveningKeep up the great work Ode.  You are one of the greatest dinning experiences Sioux Falls has to offer.  One bullet point I wanted to make is we were unsure when we were going for dinner so advanced reservation was not going to work for us.  We simply sent a message to their Facebook page of our arrival and were seated immediately upon our arrival.  Table ready for a large group keep in mind.  This type of service is just not heard of in the Sioux Falls market when many restaurants don't even allow reservations and the wait times on a Saturday could be hours. Just can't say how awesome this place really is.
