Turn offs:The parking situation - There's like 6 stalls in front, and extremely limited valet parking in the back.The crowds - It's almost always packed after 6:00pm, and you need to shout to have a conversation. They flaked out on me once - I once made a reservation for a department holiday get-together. They called me the day before the date to tell me there was some kind of televised sporting event and they couldn't hold my reservation.The seats - You sit on most of them and you sink, so that the table is up to your chest. You end up looking like a little kid at the grown-ups' table. Turn-ons:The service - The \"Home Girls\" are all friendly and attentive. Most of them are hot too. There's a reason I call this place the \"local Hooters\". The food - My personal favs: rib eye steak, kim chee fried rice, and tater tot nachosI used to live across the street from here, so I didn't have to worry about the parking. After I moved away, it was street parking and sometimes taking my chances with the Don Quijote lot. I also did a fair amount of take-out as well so I could enjoy the food in peace at home. When I heard they were closing on 3/24/2018, my friends and I, along with everyone else in town decided to go one last time. Unfortunately, it was an hour wait or more so we passed. I did manage to get one last take-out order. I really hope they reopen, hopefully with a bigger parking lot. I forgive you for flaking out on me! Don't go!!!"}, {"review_id": "O8xXrBymvQzPbp1Yv3IhpQ", "user_id": "9uEFaYRujN0AYygqbFeQhQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "My buddy raved about this place so we visited on a weekday night and surprising, it was crowded...would I return?  Despite his stellar recommendations, probably not.  He raved about the food - unfortunately, the cook did not deliver and the décor?  So-so.When I walked in, my though was, a local's version of Hooters?  Waitresses in short shorts and tight t-shirts, unlike Hooters, food is so-so, not even adequate.  My friend states the place is hit or miss, depends upon who is in the kitchen - when we visited, the salsa/cheese, etc. for the tater tot nachos were not evenly spread out, they were all clumped together.  Chicken wings? Meh.  Definitely better chicken wings at Hooters.  But then again, my buddy state that chicken wings are not their specialty.  Décor?  A bit off - harsh light, with plush seats...Waitress always stop by, asking if you want more beer.Maybe it was an \"off\" day/night, for me it was definitely an off night.  Parking is difficult, there is a small paid lot behind the place.  Another reason for not visiting...will I visit again?  Meh, maybe."}, {"review_id": "XWcQ-njgvhMHZe9Ar4S0HA", "user_id": "p87CWqpO5rnjw4MO1FtNPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "I wasn't sure what to expect when 'A' brought me here, when you get a first look from the outside it appears to be a hole-in-the-wall sports bar but little did I know this gem was so much more than just a bar.Dark parking lot but the inside is bright as hell! I got the vibe that this was one of Honolulu's hidden gems, why? I saw mostly locals.Every single employee that interacted with us was super friendly, they had a 'zero fucks' type of attitude.. but in a good way! I swear.Drinks were cheap, unfortunately I had too many that I forgot what the special was but they were good!What I really want to mention though is how incredibly tasty the food is here! Like WTF, how could a sports bar whip up so much good good!!Yeah yeah yeah, I ordered a side of fries. That's cool and all but you must try the Garlic Chicken! The garlic chicken comes in the form of popcorn chicken and when you take a bite into every piece you'll taste the buttery garlic grease! BOMB!!Next, I can't even believe 'A' made me try this because I do not like fish. I refuse to eat any type of seafood but I sucked it up and tried the Seared Ahi.  Blown away, y'all! Not only was it really good, but it was honestly bringing back childhood memories from when my dad would feed me raw slices of beef. Yah I know!!I feel like this review is almost pointless though because apparently started March 24th, 2018 the bar is shutting down the restaurant side and staying open as a bar only establishment. Sucks right? Rumor is they are opening a separate location for the restaurant which makes sense, the food is amazing! They need to expand the business!So even though the restaurant part is closing still come and check the place out. Cheap drinks and awesome waitresses!"}, {"review_id": "Yo9uEIskeMWJgBforCA8nQ", "user_id": "guwRwwQLPJ2ie_7YNfHMmA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "When I am in the mood for bar food and want to hang out with the boys and play darts, Home Bar & Grill is where I like to come.  They are located on Kalakaua Avenue at in the space formally occupied by Martini Zoo.  There are lots of seating, but they fill up fast during the popular times.  If you come any time during pau hana into the evening and on the weekends, it will be crowded.  Flat TVs are mounted throughout for your sports viewing pleasure.  Self parking is available in the front and valet parking available in the back.  I love the food here.  There are just too many to name like fried rice, steak, pork chops, garlic chicken, tater tot nachos......

Thick cut fries covered with parmesan and then eaten with those mouthwatering crispy pepperoni chips. If you come here on a budget and could order only one thing, then it better be those fries. At my last visit, we also ordered the kalbi fried noodles - very flavorful with generous amounts of char siu and kalbi. Size of the place is alright. There's bar seating and then booths and sections of various sizes. Darts are also available for entertainment. Great service no doubt but not so great parking. There are two parking lots, both small and one is valet only."}, {"review_id": "iQCIbNGY_ogPEszyCun-yA", "user_id": "6rl4_iGnxxyay2Xg0Yljiw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "So disappointing to hear we've lost another place we've all grown attached to.

I wanted to like this place. And then I didn't. And then I couldn't help but like it. And then I didn't again. This place can't make up its mind what it is, either. Is it a grungy local drinking hole? It sure looks like it from the outside and the enormous bouncer who looks like he could break your bones if he went for a chest bump. Or the dilapidated bathrooms. Inside though it's well lit and packed with a mild mannered crowd of all ages. It looks more like a cramped Buffalo Wild Wings than a dive bar. They take reservations (maybe only before 7pm?), they have valet parking, and the prices really aren't that low. Okay so I came here at 7 on a Saturday which is probably the worst time imaginable. Okay well 10pm on a Friday or Saturday is probably worse but still it was an hour wait and a full bar. Fortunately I was alone so I could wait for bar seating. It still took almost 15 minutes to get a seat, and you gotta be a little pushy. The wait for tables was almost an hour. But then later there were open bar seats, so I guess it just depends. I came in expecting a lot since the reviews were all solid. I started with a lava flow which was the special. It was handmade with real strawberries, delicious, and..I think the stingiest pour I've ever had at a bar. Seriously like maybe a half shot of booze. And I was standing right there watching him. Thanks a ton bartender...I followed up with a berry deep, which was poured about right. The lesson I think is unless you're a local or carry yourself right, don't expect a heavy pour. Also, if you order anything with strawberries you get to have them hand muddled. That part is pretty cool. Then I got my food, saimin, truffle fries, and tater tot nachos. The second two were to go, as is my approach to a place with such a varied menu where I want to try everything. The saimin was super good. It redeemed the dish for me. The only other saimin I had was fishy and meh. This was beefy and seafood-y and super tasty. The BBQ beef and pork were outstanding.  Truffle fries were weird. Too much truffle oil, too soggy, weird toppings. The aioli was pretty good at least.Totchos / tater tot nachos are where it's at. They're not particularly Hawaiian (at all), but they are particularly delicious. Btw they forgot two of my items on the receipt. Then when I pointed them out they still charged me full price for both. I guess that's fair, a lot of times places would waive em or give a discount or somethin. Oh and there's a $1 surcharge on each to go item. You'd think with how crowded it is, they'd rather you do to go...And they don't have a proper to go container for their saimin...I didn't brave the parking lot(s). They looked like a disaster waiting to happen. I parked in another lot nearby. So yeah what a complicated place. Like I said, I'd go there again but you really need to time it to not be obnoxious. 2pm sounds good. I'll be curious what they do in their revamp."}, {"review_id": "fBcTQd4KSLQZ8htyg2aSrw", "user_id": "zYPvMZS4XwEL0AH-MuSfow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/4/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Went here for my friends yakudoshi.  The area is smaller when compared to a side street inn but typical bar/eatery type setting.  I don't drink but I was very impressed by the food.  We started with the wafu steak, salt and pepper shrimp, pork chops, and negi toro.  The negi toro has a good kick to it because of the wasabi oil. We also got the Parmesan truffle fries, kalbi fried noodles, fried rice, and salad. Bruh! The fries with the pepperoni and bleu cheese dressing blew my mind.  The fried rice and fried noodles were also top notch.  All the food was great and the staff was very welcoming.

This place is hilarious!!First of all, the inside looks like you've gone to hang out in your best friend's basement in high school. Or maybe a crappy rec room in an old apartment complex. But to be honest, that just adds to the charm. When I visited, there were huge Hawaiian bouncers at the door, and the area looks real sketch so we were kinda afraid our car would be broken into. I was thinking, what were we thinking to come here?? But again, that really just adds to the whole experience. It really is a non-touristy place, and I feel like I learnt a lot about actual Hawaiian people - like did you know that Seahawks seems to be the NFL team of choice? I did not, but the Seahawks branded stuff all over the walls gave me an education!Now the food...Amazing and unique comfort food. The tater-tot nachos and kimchi fried rice were both top notch. I swear, I want to come back to the Island just for another order of tater-tot nachos and kimchi fried rice! We also got some fried chicken bits (can't remember what they were called), which were good too. Again, not great on the waistline but so so good."}, {"review_id": "m-OnP4tBPsfq_0gkPBr53w", "user_id": "w5vtDqybAMmlqOBZiZMdPQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/20/2017", "text": "Great tasty food, large portions, delicious and fresh, good price.

(3.167 stars).\"Feels like home, feels like home.\" - Leann RimesHB&G really did feel like home to me since I started coming here in 2012.My friends, family, and I liked coming to HB&G for the variety of pupus and reasonable prices.After being fed up with the other local bars, we were so excited to have found a new hangout!Back then, there was a parking lot next to the bar.Sadly, that lot has since been removed. But for a short while parking was a breeze!! Now, it's either valet parking or searching for street parking and hoofing it over.The more and more I would come back to HB&G, the sadder and sadder I got.So after many years of coming to HB&G I figured it would be good for me to write my review to remind me of what I should order if I ever come back.On a recent visit, somewhat forced by my friend who loves this place, I ordered my norm:-Kalbi Fried Noodles-Tater Tot Nachos-Pork ChopsKalbi Fried Noodles - $14. (3 stars).The only redeeming quality about this dish is the Kalbi (Korean short ribs). The quality of the meat is good and tender. Not terribly fatty.HB&G's Kalbi is marinated in a wicked sweet sauce. Sweeter than the traditional Korean marinade. I'm sure this is due to the fact that the \"Hawaii palate\" seems to love sweet meats and marinades and sauces (which I loathe). But perhaps if I blot the ribs, I could see myself eating the ribs again.The fried noodles are oily and lack any flavor. No hint of oyster sauce or Soy sauce or garlic or really anything other than oil, pepper, and salt.I think I would just order the Kalbi by itself from this point on.Tater Tot Nachos - $11. (3.5 stars).This is what put HB&G on the bar food map.These \"Nachos\" come with tater tots, jalapeños, bacon bits, olives, sour cream, salsa, & cheese whiz. I always ask for a side of extra scallions!!HB&G made me realize how much I DETEST cheese whiz sauce!!I always order this dish deconstructed because I like all the ingredients except the awful fake cheese whiz sauce. It really disgusts me especially when it sits for a while and becomes congealed. After a while it begins to replicate orange plastic!! Disgusting.Unfortunately for me this seems to be the cheese most places use because it's cheap. I prefer shredded cheese melted via an oven which would crisp up the tots even more and melt the cheese but what do I know...Besides, my friends all seem to love the cheese whiz so at least they can pour it on their own tater tots!!The ingredients are fresh and I love dunking my tots in sour cream and then in a bowl of scallions and bacon. The perfect bite for me!!Pork Chops - $19. (3 stars).Sadly, when I first started coming to HB&G, the pork chops were moist and delicious!! Garlicky and peppery!!The last 3 times I have been to HB&G, my pork chops were COVERED IN ONIONS with very little pork!! What I did have was absolutely dry and tasteless!! The pork was fried to the point of no return.I dislike ketchup but I had to use it just to infuse some moisture and flavor into these dry pieces of swine!!---All in all, seeing HB&G become so wildly popular was good for the business, but not great for my palate.Drinks are average and nothing special but comparably priced to the surrounding businesses. I find the pupus here overly sweet for me but as long as I can order the Tater Tot Nachos deconstructed then I am more than willing to come back if my friends and family have their cravings for this place..."}, {"review_id": "5Rgp6f2WYrXRn3jwXI-g9g", "user_id": "UH7MP6ZE4AhiS5cRdVJ4yg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "I was so surprised at how great the food was here.
