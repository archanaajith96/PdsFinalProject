Spiced properly and good exterior crunch.I like their BBQ salad... that's a lie, I like everything there.  Totally worth a trip to a semi-industrial area.  Great BBQ joint in the middle of LV!"}, {"review_id": "-i7szzIWriz1cJgfBDtkcQ", "user_id": "Hnloe1PKYOaG7axJzHmyNg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Very Good BBQ, and I know BBQTender, flavorful, and the choices,Make you want to go back ASAP!"}, {"review_id": "fOoq0kzTpyQx7kcCBM8RiQ", "user_id": "vpX0Gj6C4dKfpAHmnQro9g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Family and I were very excited to try this place whilePlanning our trip to Vegas.

We opted for the trio choice of 3 meats: beef ribs, spare ribs & brisket (sliced instead of chopped). This was $17.99 + $6 sub for the beef ribs & it came with cornbread and a side - we chose the bacon potato salad. Our food came out super quick and was a big portion, definitely enough for 2 people. The bacon potato salad was so good! The beef rib (only one rib) was disappointing because it was immensely fatty and the brisket (~5 pcs) was even worse because it was sooooo dry. Brisket is supposed to be tender with an amazing smoke ring but theirs failed at both. The spare ribs (2 pcs) were good but didn't fall off the bone. I liked the bbq sauce, not super thick like some places. Corn bread was meh, if you like light and cake-like then this is for you. I like mine super crispy at the top. The location was kinda sketchy and in the middle of no where it felt like. There are some communal tables out front and two small rooms inside with a handful of tables. I feel like this was just average for me. Phil's BBQ is still my favorite on the west coast!"}, {"review_id": "IDuWYL0C79fLce24_dRP4g", "user_id": "zudZl2wYpmZYyoklPVhV-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "If you love BBQ, then this is definitely a place to try at least once. I don't come here often as it's not that close to where I live, but always enjoy myself and the food whenever I am in the area and am able to stop in and get me something delicious to eat. I usually will get the Outlaw burger. It is a hamburger mixed with brisket, onions, bell pepper, topped with onion strings, red cabbage slaw, lettuce, tomato, cheddar cheese and a chipotle aioli. This monster of a burger costs $13.99 and worth every penny.  I usually make this a combo for an extra $4. Other great items on their menu are their Club Wrap, BBQ wrap (I didn't see this on their menu anymore, but was told they'll still make it for you), ribs, chopped brisket sandwich, The Spudtastic, bacon potato salad, fried okra, loaded mashed potatoes, mac n cheese and more. There is definitely something for everyone They have lots of seating from in the main area when you first enter to another whole room and benches outside. This place gets busy and crowded, so if you aren't there at opening, you may need to take your food to go.

Stuck a napkin under as a coaster and called it a day.  Too bad I won't be able to reuse the cup.On to the positives!!  The food was well prepared, very flavorful, and in great portions.  I chose the 2 meat combo (Brisket and Hot Link) with the potato salad.  The brisket was incredibly well prepared and very tender.  Got Link was cooked AND cut to perfection.  Sauces were bursting with flavor that enhanced the taste of the meats.The service from cashiers were very nice and intimate too.  Each transaction was unique where the cashiers would create small talk to show appreciation and make the customer feel special.  For example, my friend before me, the cashier would talk about living in Las Vegas (he was born and raised).  Then, when I came up, he talked to me about my heritage and how it was applicable to him as well (based on my last name).  It was incredibly calming to know each customer is treated with respect and dignity.  Bravo!"}, {"review_id": "lh97mgOF13SPFBs8fnaBIQ", "user_id": "WMcryFOUZzY5og8pU1NZyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Wow. Thanks yelpers. I love Southern BBQ, and this place hit the spot. Don't let the industrial location next to a strip club, and the small parking area deter you. Price, portion, and taste is all on point for this business.My hubby ordered a special of ribs and sweet potato pie for $20. His meal was okay, but mine?! Mine was fantastic! I paid an extra $3 for the burnt brisket tips by recommendation of the cashier, and she wasn't kidding. It was smoky, tender, and a bit spicy from the peppercorn crust. Since mine was a two item combo, I also got the pulled pork- not too salty, tender shreds of pork. Served with one slice of white bread and a side. I got the chipotle coleslaw since I wanted some greens with my heavy meal. Order at the front, pay, find a table and self serve utensils and drinks.

They have several choices so we opted to go for the 5 meat pot special that comes with 3 sides. The sides we got were the Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and there corn nuggets. Every single thing was mouth watering and filled with flavor. The CORN NUGGETS are a MUST try. There was so much food we couldn't finish it all.

Line up and place your order at the counter then wait for your food.

A BBQ lovers paradise!  I'd have to say this is my favorite BBQ of all time. I'm not a big meat eater, so it says something if I LOVE a place that serves mostly meat. When I lived in Vegas, I heard about this place from a friend/coworker who told me that I needed to try this place out since their food was delicious, and boy am I glad I was able to try it out. This is a little hidden gem and is kind of hard to find if you're not familiar with the area. I got lost trying to find this place and I lived in Vegas, the very first time I came to this location. The parking lot is very small as it shares it with the other businesses in the area. A lot of the time people have to park on the street or in a nearby parking lot and walk over to the restaurant.From the outside of the building, it looks really small with hardly any space to accommodate the crowds that come here, but when you enter, there is a small seating area and then they have another room with more tables as well as some picnic type tables outside. I love how when you get out of your car, you instantly are hit with the delicious aroma of cooking BBQ. So delicious you can almost taste it. The person taking orders are quick and efficient while still being polite and cheerful. They're very knowledgeable about their menu and can give suggestions on what to try if it's your first visit and you just are too overwhelmed with the options they offer. When your food is ready, they either call out your name or call out what is ordered, so keep your eyes and ears open or you might miss your food. They usually come around calling names several times though, so you shouldn't have a problem getting your food. Food comes out quickly, smelling delicious and looking even better. Food is fresh and hot when it is delivered to your table. I've tried several of their items on their menu and have been satisfied with just about everything. The Club Wrap ($11.99) was one of my favorite items to have here. It has just the perfect amount of meat with lettuce, tomato, bacon, and cheese. I also loved their BBQ Smoked wrap. Note, I didn't see this as an option on their menu anymore, but I'm sure you can ask them to make it and they'd be more than happy to do so. Also the \"Spudtastic\" ($12.99), Outlaw Burger ($13.99), Hush Puppies ($3.50), Fried Okra ($3.50), Corn Nuggets ($3.50), Cheesy Mac N Cheese ($3.50), Waffle Fries ($3.50), and Loaded Mashed Potato ($3.50)  are some of the items they offer that are simply delicious. You can just order the meat item or make it a combo and get a side and drink to finish off your meal. However, unless you're super hungry or can eat a lot of food, I'd suggest you bringing a friend along so you can share as they give you good size portions. I'm always stuffed whenever I leave and I usually don't do a combo meal. My experience was always a positive one whenever I came here and I look forward to making another trip here in the near future!!"}, {"review_id": "-RIgACYbYGl3kYx4y9zYcA", "user_id": "FmikGD1_zt04EcFFZr-ctQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "In Vegas for Football Tournament so checked yelp for a place near by and found it was only 10 minutes from our Hotel.  Place is a typical BBQ joint which means no frills or thrills for decorations just good food.  Well the sliced brisket was moist and delicious I liked both BBQ sauces and pay extra for the Baby Back Ribs.  Totally worth the xtra $3My photo doesn't do this place justice."}, {"review_id": "dJ8P1qpV80Ita1_WC7igXg", "user_id": "v6LuHMMSaluUhAa_gYDxfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "Food was PERFECTION here.

It's true what they, the restaurant is a hole in the wall. But after having tried a few of their menu items, I am convinced it's a Must-have in Vegas and a Total keeper.He ordered the Brisket Sliced Spare Ribs with Corn Nuggets ($12.59). I wanted to try a few sides of my own ($3.15 each): Corn Nuggets, Yams, Sweet Corn Bread, Cheesy Mac N Cheese, Waffle Fries, and a Side Salad with chipotle dressing. And for dessert, I shared a Banana Pudding ($4.99) with Vanilla Ice Cream ($2.00). I felt like I just had a Side Item Sampler with a dip of every barbecue sauce. The Side Salad is good and everything else is flavorful. I love the Crispiness of Waffle Fries and Savory Corn Nuggets with Creamy, Cheesy Mac N Cheese.  The Sweet Corn Bread is moist and fluffy, and it taste amazing with Sweet Potato Yams. My favorite is the Banana Pudding with Vanilla Ice Cream. It's just the right amount of sweetness and they even add a hint of Crunchy Vanilla Wafers which makes it so yummy.
