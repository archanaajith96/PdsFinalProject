It seems like the staff is pretty knowledgable about the ingredients, too, which makes ordering a breeze. It also seems like the quality of the food has gotten better from the outset, because I remember a few instances at first where the purple rice was a bit dry, and it seems completely solved now, and the purple rice is always good. I can see the efforts they're putting in towards having more options available too, with the addition of zoodles on the bar.Bonus points for their rewards program now, too, and extra kudos for the mango aqua fresca as well (I could drink gallons of it).It's just all-in-all a good place, very creative, and something we really needed in town!"}, {"review_id": "U5U0cN1M-uaKhYWmboa_Vw", "user_id": "KgsfVkhgWtSYL-0_us9Jfg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "The first time eating Poke outside my beloved California and I've got to say I was well pleased with this place. It was clean, bright, and the food was very good. This pace is off very busy street and easily missed if you're not paying attention. Decor-ship/aquatic decor with ship steering wheels and netting adorn the walls along with their merchandise for sale. They have outside patio for outdoor dining as well. Service-was good, cant say I was greeted with a smile but hey they served me my food and took my form of payment. A smile would have been nice, not gonna lie. Food-I ordered the spicy salmon with brown rice and zucchini noodle base. It was pretty good, I loved the amount of spice on salmon(I still added Sriracha). All the toppings were perfect and I specially enjoyed the mango and avocado. I will definitely come back next time I'm in the area."}, {"review_id": "UgzvmtArNKWkS8qAnZiA-g", "user_id": "ZGJuwTn6Ty-KrUE9nu3hDw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "My first poké experience was a good one! We stopped in for dinner one night. I'll start by saying that the decor and feel of the place is super cool. I love that they had boat cleats as their cabinet handles. Lots of cute nautical but modern touches.The ordering was efficient and the workers super friendly. I got a spicy salmon bowl. I asked to hold the mango because I'm not a fan, and they actually let you substitute other things for it which is nice. I got some seaweed salad instead. My husband built his own bowl. He was wary about the whole poké concept but he really enjoyed his bowl. The bowls don't seem as huge as they actually are! It was a ton of food, but it was so fresh that it didn't feel overwhelming. Both of our bowls were delicious. I was also tempted to try one of their cocktails, and the Coco Mojito was really refreshing. Now that they are serving boba drinks, I'll have to return very soon!"}, {"review_id": "Zpyikqb8yprQQGA3E8HZ5g", "user_id": "VFJwV-4OxcxtTM7MEg7P3g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "I'm so happy the poke scene has made it to Baton Rouge ! It is my favorite thing to eat currently, so I hope it keeps expanding, and by the amount of people there was eating here I bet it will.I love poke and have had many a poke bowls, and I liked my bowl here but I didn't love it. I never pick a menu item when I eat poke bowls, usually I do build your own. This time I decided to try the spicy salmon bowl, safe to say I won't be ordering it again. The bowls here are also the most expensive poke bowls I have ever bought it was over $17 dollars with tax and tip plus the $1 up charge for krab salad (which I think is ridiculous) Just like any poke place you pick your base, I got white rice. It tastes old and it was hard. I don't know how because we got there a few minutes after opening. It must have been from the night before though. I did sample the purple rice and that definitely is not for me in a poke bowl either.  The only thing I truly enjoyed in my bowl was the salmon, the Krab salad which was awesome, and the spicy mayo I got on the side. The sauce that came with the bowl was really sweet and I didn't enjoy it. Why 4 Stars then? The fish was fresh and they gave a decent amount, and I know I could go there and build a bowl I like if they fix their rice. The staff was super friendly, and the location is great for a stop after my weekly shopping trip to Trader Joe's down the road."}, {"review_id": "K57Svl-vfUx2h33KsTPAMg", "user_id": "HX02LFgHMPhURVxADIWvyw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I still stick to what I believe in my old review, but this is pertaining to my recent visit to try their newly added boba drinks. They are offering Thai tea, taro, matcha, and a satsuma flavored milk tea with tapioca balls.Not trying to hate, but the new boba drinks for $3.50 for the size I bought was a little ridic. It could also be that I had an extremely high ice to taro drink ratio (see picture). I finished the drink before I even got to the red light down the street at Acadian.. Never in my entire life have I seen boba for that price for the amount given. Quite frankly I felt a little ripped off comparing this boba to the other several places in town.To my surprise, I thought the drinks would be made to order, but it's already been pre-made and sitting there. Overall it had a good taste and the boba was nice and chewy, but it's not worth the price."}, {"review_id": "lEyjH9c9-aCNv3iIHBuVjQ", "user_id": "5fUahb5uMC1G6ogBvppOug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Southfin has perfected the fast casual Poké concept in Baton Rouge. The options are limitless and it starts with the bases: two types of rice, mixes greens, noodles or veggie noodles. My go-to is the Wasabi Gras on half purple rice half mixed greens. Southfin doesn't skimp on the toppings. My bowl always includes big scoops of tuna and shrimp with lots of other toppings. If you're not a fan of seafood, they do have a chicken option. They serve some great juices and have a full bar with beer, wine and cocktails."}, {"review_id": "IAJK7KGVktbXtwGdiTtmEQ", "user_id": "iJ97UrvPlGNttp44qsJ-4A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "This build your own bowl place has a college vibe, and is a bit less pricey than some others of its ilk. It doesn't offer quite as much either, but still certainly wasn't bad. Their website claims it combines the Hawaiian poke bowl with \"traditions of the Gulf South\", but I'm quite confused as to what makes it \"southern\". Throw me a red beans and rice poke bowl, or some fried okra or a remoulade sauce and we'll talk.What it does have, unlike the other Poke Bowl places that have sprouted up all over, is tempeh instead of tofu for its vegetarian option, which I rather like. I never have much success preparing tempeh on my own, but they did a decent job of it. A combination of purple rice with a sauce and various toppings made for a decent bowl, albeit not a large one. There are many premium toppings for an extra charge, but the basic selection was not as good as I've had elsewhere, and the atmosphere here was pretty basic as well, just a regular strip mall fast food place, unlike some of the highbrow poke bowl spots in New Orleans.So at the end of the day, it's fine enough, but didn't blow me away."}, {"review_id": "Zt6JVYzGIJGbE8f4A7mwpw", "user_id": "W4QqmCIlsixrUi75Y7as-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "I wish whole heartedly this place would waitr to my office.

Seafood is local  they also have alcohol- so they make their own drinks- Ima have to try one. I did a build my own bowl with salad mix. Tuna and shrimp. Cucumber carrots and red cabbage I think. Then I did a special topping of mango and crab salad- they could do a little better with their crab salad or their portion of the avocado. Then I did crispy shallots. I forgot what sauces I got it was a mix the guy recommended and it was pretty good.

The atmosphere is bright and light, carefree much like the Hawaii islands. I was craving poke, and they certainly know how to make it well.

Thinking back, i would get the zucchini noodles instead, but next time, it's a go! The regular bowl was very filling and satisfying. The spiciness is there, and honestly, there was just a little too much sauce in there that it overpowered the salmon. I would have liked the salmon flavor to be a little more prevalent. The staff was super friendly and made recommendations. The line moved quickly. They even have a delightful craft beer selection.

You can create your own bowl or order a pre-designed bowl. Highlights: fresh ingredients, clean restaurant, friendly service, and a new type of cuisine in Baton Rouge. Areas for improvement: the sushi rice was pretty bad (hard and bland); the pieces of fish were really inconsistent in size (some need to be cut and some were morsels); the overall value was lacking for a fast casual restaurant.

My SO got the rice and I have to say the rice was a bit undercooked.Overall, I got a lot of fish. I got the tiki bowl special, it only comes in a large but I got a lot of protein. Two scoops of fish and one scoop of shrimp. It was tuna, salmon, and shrimp.

Oh how this exceeded my expectations!! Poke is pronounced [Poh-keh] which is basically like the American hamburger of Hawaii. The bowl is served usually with raw fish (they do offer cooked chicken though too) and added bases such as rice, noodles, greens as well as additional accompaniments. So fresh and so flavorful!! Vegan & GF friendly! Think of a Subway or Salad shop style of ordering your personalized poke but with Hawaiian inspired ingredients (pineapple, mango, pickled ginger, spices, cilantro, veggies)!! The staff was so welcoming & assisted helping you order. Also the line moves very quickly. I ordered the regular size \"Classic\" & added mango & snow crab (this is the real deal y'all). The ponzu sauce was not overpowering & enhanced the flavor of my ingredients perfectly. I devoured the entire bowl feeling satisfied and energized! The atmosphere is very clean & Pacific vibes.
