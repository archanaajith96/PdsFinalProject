I grew up in New Haven. Love all the great food available in & around Yale. But was not impressed with this place at all.Broth tasted like dirty water....nothing aromatic there.

I took the leftover hot oil sauce and poured it in my pho, as recommended by our waitress. She knows what's up.

My fiancé and I both got the tonkotsu ramen, which was delicious. The broth was rich, thick, not too salty, and very garlicky, which I absolutely loved. You better believe I finished every last drop of it. The noodles were fine--they were the thin straight kind rather than the thicker wavy ones. I wish we were offered a choice. The ramen came with two thin slices of luscious pork belly, as well as half of a perfectly soft-boiled egg. Both were delicious toppings. There were also some sprouts in there that were alright. I wish it automatically came with menma, instead of having to add that separately. Overall, I think it needs a little more topping action, because it quickly becomes just noodles and broth after a while. I thought the portion size was pretty good, and I left pretty full. My vegetarian friend got the kinoko vegetarian ramen and appeared to enjoy it. She also got the shiitake steamed baos, which were delicious (hoisin + kewpie is what dreams are made of), but were a little skimpy on the mushroom. Prices are reasonable, and the service was great. Our waiter was super nice and accommodating, even to the clueless lady sitting next to us who ordered the pho tai and then was surprised when she didn't get ramen. Pho =\\= ramen. C'mon, educate yourself, lady! Overall, a very good meal. Despite some little complaints here and there, it's definitely the best ramen I've had in CT so far. A little out of the way for us, but we'll be back when the ramen craving strikes."}, {"review_id": "a75RstOIGx8T5jQV2IN7-Q", "user_id": "oX8qsfKLmoDOnymwTfHiUw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "KFC Bao (4.5/5): The chicken here was crispy and lightly breaded, but I wished it had been a tad thicker and juicier. As it was, the piece had more of a jerky-like texture. Red oil dumplings (5/5): These were more like large wontons than dumplings since they had thin wraps. The thinner skin made for a wrinklier package overall -- aka more folds for places where the chili oil could pool!! The fresh cilantro and fried garlic and shallot were also brilliant topping choices. When fried, the pungent sharpness of garlic and shallot become concentrated into tiny morsels of pure flavor, wonderful when paired with the scrumptious dumplings. The chili oil was so good that we asked to keep our plate to use the oil for dipping our noodles. Cumin lamb noodles (5/5): I was blown away at first bite. This dish was extremely saucy and packed with cumin flavor. The texture of these flat, wide, thick noodles were, as the Taiwanese would call it, perfectly QQ--chewy, springy, with just the right amount of resistance when bitten. I will say a few strands could have used a smidge more time in water which would have prevented them from getting stuck together, but overall, these noodles were amazing and I only wish Mecha had filled the bowl with more. The lamb was melt-in-your-mouth tender and drenched in more of that unique sauce. The bowl was also loaded with several large slabs of it. The  addition of bean sprouts, onion and bok choy provided ample textural contrast and lightened up the dish. The cumin lamb noodles are a seasonal item so visit soon and get it while it lasts!! Tonkotsu ramen (3.5/5): The broth here was a little lackluster. I found it salty, without much ramen broth funk or the flavor of pork that has been stewed for hours. The pork wasn't anything special and I found the toppings to be standard.Mecha is a innovative hip joint that's a must-try in the New Haven area. I'd rate it at 4.5 stars, for sure!"}, {"review_id": "eHDFfzPlvWBsCc-jCDsijA", "user_id": "DuNi6Rgk8eZjFahCyFxp6Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I always feel intimated when I'm ordering Pho because I have no clue what to get!

The bao were huge, a little tough to eat, but rather delicious. The tonkatsu was very good, though not the richest broth I've had. The noodles, though, were excellent.I dig the old school hip hop and general chill vibe of the restaurant.

We had both Pho and Ramen and were all delighted in the offerings. The Ramen was increasingly rich and had a depth of flavor that I had never experienced before. Really delicious.

A simple noodle dish with no special ingredients or anything fancy, just ramen done well. The broth is rich (a bit too salty) and its a great vehicle for the tender noodles that swim in it. It has great taste and the scallion/ bean sprouts add some great additional texture to the tender noodles. The slices of pork are also generous. Charred well, they are smokey/fatty and delicious. The egg is cooked until the yolk is runny. Overall, a decent bowl of ramen. The spicy dumplings are great as well. Delicious plump pork dumplings sitting in a pool of spicy tangy sauce. Not to hot but just the right amount of heat to keep you coming back. The fried chicken baos where not bad. Crispy fried chicken inside soft and sweet steamed buns topped with pickled carrots/radish. Good combination. A hip and modern atmosphere, Mecha is probably the only decent ramen place in NH."}, {"review_id": "lAKbdotpvS1oWug2rlc5HA", "user_id": "bI6K69Ib14ocvdMWvV1UBg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/12/2017", "text": "Mecha is a pretty hip place with many cultural dishes. Their menu seems to reflect some Vietnamese, Korean, and Japanese influences. Their prices can be a little steep, such as $8 for 4 dumplings, and $14 for a meat special banh mi. However, I heard happy hour has some great prices and the best time to go. They have a good variety of noodle soups (specifically pho and ramen). +TONKOTSU: Noodles have a bit of a crunch or al dente feel to them, which I love. The egg was also nice and oozing, and there was quite a lot of meat in comparison to other ramen I've had; 4 thick cuts of chashu. Though I did wish it came with more toppings such as bamboo. The broth was savory but not as creamy and fatty as other tonkotsu ramens I've had; it seems more on the salty side.-RED OIL DUMPLINGS: There is a lot of cilantro on this, and I enjoyed the red oil. However, I just think it's pricey for what you get. The food is alright, not outstanding, especially in comparison with the price. As for the atmosphere, the music is a little loud and it's sometimes hard to get the staff's attention. I do like the decor here, along with the mixture of small and community tables. All in all, a pretty decent noodle place but the price overshadows the tastes for me. I do hope to return and give it a second chance with their pho offerings and their well-known baos."}, {"review_id": "vK601vgejmaY6GeZfLgvVA", "user_id": "ojiN3u-8CVBPBisohY9_5Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/24/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Went to Mecha for the second time with a coworker and ordered the edamame and chicken ramen with charred corn. The edamame and ramen were very good -- the edamame were roasted with garlic cloves which added a great touch. And the ramen was flavorful with plenty of noodles. The reason for the 3 stars? We arrived at 7:30 PM on a Saturday night and put our name down. We were told there was approximately a 25 minute wait -- we said that was fine and went to chat on one of the benches outside. At 8:20 PM, I noticed that we were the only people sitting outside. Every single party that arrived after us (including a party of 5) were seated. I went inside and shared this with the person at the host podium. Instead of apologizing, he justified this wait by explaining that the 25 minutes was an \"estimate\". No. Just no. Stop. Given that my last experience here was ruined by a significantly long wait, I am beginning to think this is a pattern -- the servers should be trained to provide more accurate wait times or be more attentive to all parties waiting. I'm convinced that if I hadn't gone inside to check on our table, we would have waited at least another 30 minutes.

They were pretty busy, but we were able to get a seat without waiting during this late end of the lunch hour. The inside is very trendy and cool, though the seats are backless stools that for a longer period would have seriously made my back ache. The nice interior decoration stopped abruptly when one left the dining space, the hallway that leads to the bathrooms looks very divey and dirty in comparison to the front end of the building. The music choices were also a bit odd to me, basically a hip hop and rap playlist the entire visit. It was a very trendy vibe.As for the service, everyone was very friendly and most wait times were short, though there was a bit of lag on snagging the bill. Nothing that detracted from the experience though.As for the menu and food, between us we ordered the kimchi fried rice, the mushroom bao bun, the chicken ramen, and one of the pho dishes. Out of what I tried, my favorite was the mushroom Bao bun, the mushroom had such a good, well developed flavor that was so moist and tender and the bao was properly soft and squishy to the teeth. I really enjoyed my ramen as well- especially once adding some of the table sauces to is, though in comparison to the bao the bao was on a five star, woah level and the ramen was a four star, yum level. The fried rice was a bit less exciting. It was good, but we ended up leaving it behind to eat all of the other bits. The pho was my friend's and I didn't snag a bite. The drink menu was pretty extensive. I had the lemon hibiscus soda and it was really good, but for $4 I sorta wish I had skipped it and focused on food. It was not a lot of volume for the money. They had a lot of interesting looking cocktails and bubble teas I'd like to try in the future. Overall, I enjoyed it and on a chilly, foggy New Haven day it's a good spot for something cozy."}, {"review_id": "RIlEIOp_QwRkm1O83XZ6Rw", "user_id": "sGP9iOL4rJIE6M76ozY-2g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/24/2017", "text": "Ramen bowls here are surprisingly good and pretty authentic.
