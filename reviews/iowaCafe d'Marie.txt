The owner and staff were very friendly. If I lived in the area, I would make this a regular stop for lunch with a friend.Amazing selection of lattes!I had a cherry, goat cheese, and spinach quiche with cream of broccoli soup and a Chai latte. My husband and daughter had paninis with cream of cauliflower soup and lattes.Will definitely come back the next time I am in Davenport."}, {"review_id": "BIuHgvYLGOtTTL51F1YgmA", "user_id": "7uq1fe0H-U0jVXPVjCJu_Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "2.5 stars, but I'm rounding up because the people there are so friendly.I went to Cafe d'Marie for the first time on Saturday afternoon.  After being seated, we waited for about 10-15 minutes before someone came to take our order.  It was busy, and the guy taking our order apologized for the delay-- he thought someone else had already taken it.  No biggie...it happens.So then we ordered.  And we sat.  For almost an hour.The wait got so long that we discussed paying for our coffee and leaving.  It was that bad.  And we were hungry!So then, finally, I see our waiter coming with food, and my spirits lift.But it's just a salad that my husband ordered as part of his lunch.  Then we wait some more.Finally, our paninis come.  More than an hour after we placed our order.  And, in all fairness, they're really yummy.  But since the ingredients don't actually appear to be homemade-- I saw them pulling bread out of store-bought bags, and dropping a skimpy handful of potato chips on my plate-- I don't understand the wait.  It seems like they merely assemble the sandwiches, heat them up, and serve them.Despite the epic wait, the service was really friendly.  They brought us a piece of bread pudding, on the house, at the end of our meal-- and it was awesome.  Given the fact that this homemade treat was so great, I would actually go back again to try some of their other house specialties-- the quiche in particular looked awesome (but they were unfortunately out of quiche by the time we got there).All in all, it was a cozy place (complete with kids artwork and staff with a penchant for PDA), and I'd give them another try.  But probably not if I'm on a time crunch or if I'm really hungry."}, {"review_id": "gEkixf15SDTlyBWoVkd8yQ", "user_id": "uBM3vYlnonYDEp0hPgc6Xw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "A humble, low profile cafe that will, without the slightest doubt, blow you away with their incredibly delicious made from scratch quiches, soups, sandwiches and more. Their coffee and tea selection is also quite impressive!

If you are anything like me then you love a unique atmosphere, great food, and fast / friendly service! This place does not let me down.

That's pronounced DEE-Marie, if you were wondering as I was for the entire two years it's been on my list of bookmarks. The adorableness of this place was overwhelming. My love of businesses in houses is well documented. Although it was lunchtime and bustling, we managed to secure a great table where we could observe the goings on and take in the decor. Our server, significant other of the owner, was attentive and answered all of our questions about the menu and cafe. The owner, Deanna, rang us up at the conclusion of our meal and seemed happy we had come and was very interested in how we had found out about her restaurant (thanks Yelp).My friend and I both ordered paninis and were very happy with them. Mine had turkey, gouda, and chipotle raspberry spread. It was verrrrry good, though the spread could have been a little more 'chipotle.' I also ordered a delicious cup of cream of asparagus soup, something I would definitely get again. Though we didn't purchase any there was a spread of desserts on display at the counter, all of which looked very fresh.Today I read that online magazine Insider named Cafe d'Marie 'best coffee shop in Iowa.' I didn't need another reason for a return visit, but looks like I got one anyway."}, {"review_id": "C2hwz6abtKuecz7Nq3QOew", "user_id": "ufCUhfL72uOFkrUUrZdMXg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Yelped for a place to get a quick bite and we were very pleased with our find.

It's like Portland finally had an influence on the Quad Cites. This is the Midwest, where we typically value quantity over flavor. Portions are properly sized and the flavor is fabulous. My only suggestion while they work hard to connect directly with the customer, refrain from answering the phone while taking our order. Our server answered a portable phone and entered into a full conversation mode centenary. Even my teenage kids picked up on this and commented.Keep up the great work! Hopefully you inspire others to take similar chances."}, {"review_id": "MyGxPErDVNVJqUUiIzErow", "user_id": "utuniC9_kQnpKjdCfZ_7lw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "We stopped by here awhile back as we were heading towards Nebraska to see the total solar eclipse.

The house was built in 1856 and has great character. Especially quaint was the partially complete French mural in the entry hallway. Hubs had cream of Brussels sprout soup (amazing) and the #5 panini with corned beef, baby Swiss, sour kraut and thousand island dressing grilled perfectly and served freshly made. 12YO had the buffalo chicken panini and thought it was great. The portabella and ham quiche I had was delectable with the rasberry green tea.Great atmosphere, fast and friendly service, delicious cuisine - they do it right!"}, {"review_id": "6VJ0u742ueeUYKFIwXFCWw", "user_id": "N8u_5pqq9QEomB457wV9nA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Great food it is a very cool atmosphere!

Small, quaint, but fabulously tasty fresh food and drinks! First time I had the bacon, tomato, & spinach quiche, Honey Bee latte and brought home some cake to share with the family. YUM! This past Saturday,  I wanted to try a panini. I got the1/2 sandwich & soup option. The ham, Swiss and spinach panini and the cream of Brussels sprouts soup. It was even better than our first visit. I'm licking my lips just thinking about it! I finished my meal off with a bread pudding! It was worth every calorie! :) I do want to add, that the friend I went with is a Vegan and gluten free by necessity.  They have a wide range of gluten free options from a few quiches made with gluten free crust, to paninis made with gluten free bread. They can even made you a dairy free latte with coconut or almond milk! My friend was the one that recommends the place and loves it! The atmosphere is unique, but oh so homey. The staff are extremely helpful and are confident when you ask them for recommendations. They are happy to have you there and want you to enjoy every morsal and libation!Can't wait to go back... soon! Think next Saturday!!!P.S. I should have taken pics,  but didn't want to stop and take the time..food was that good!"}, {"review_id": "UGFiwY4C7tTJxGWT_6_ewQ", "user_id": "TVrB6C2z1pkMbGhrqxRIsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "What a great experience!

Coffee drinks to die for. Their lattes are works of art. The old house reminds me of my grandmothers house so i have a spot in my heart for this lovely establishment.

I was overwhelmed by the amount of things that sounded delicious and that I wanted to try. I was TRYING to eat light, so ordered the half salad and cup of cream of brussel sprout soup. Both were excellent, delicious, and definitely homemade! I then got tempted by all the delicious dessert choices and go the bread pudding with caramel cream sauce... OMG. Wow. I can't wait to come back and try all the other desserts, quiche, paninis, and hummus wrap! Also the service was impeccable and SUPER speedy for lunch hour! I arrived at 12 and left by 12:30. The atmosphere can't be beat- it's literally in an old house and I was alone so lucky enough to be seated by the ivy covered window.

Housed in a home built in 1864, right on the river, this quaint cafe is filled with homespun charm. The staff were warm, friendly, and helpful. The food was delicious. We tried the quiche of the day (there were four to choose from), side salad and panini. All were cooked well with interesting flavor combinations. Of course they serve tea and coffee too. LOTS of options to please everyone. The tea was a house blend which I loved enough to bring a container home. We finished our meal with with monstrous cookies bursting with chocolate.  I highly recommend stopping in for a visit!
