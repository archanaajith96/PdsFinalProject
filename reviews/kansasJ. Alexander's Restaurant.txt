It was definitely a treat as my boyfriend and I wouldn't normally choose this spot because of the pricey menu but I can say confidently..it was worth it. The service was phenomenal. The waiter was knowledgeable about the menu, wine list, and specials. We ordered smoked salmon dip and deviled eggs for an appetizer.  Between the four of us it was definitely enough and I strongly recommend the smoked salmon dip. It's creamy and the smoky flavor isn't overpowering. I didn't try the deviled eggs but my boyfriend and parents raved about them. I ordered the filet kebabs (one of the specials) and was informed by the manager about twenty minutes later that they'd actually run out. She was genuinely apologetic and gave us a free appetizer and free entree for me. She went above and beyond to make it right and we really appreciated it! My boyfriend ordered the Steak Maui and said it was well marbled and cooked to perfection. He got a side of the \"Not Your Ordinary Mac & Cheese\" which meant I got some and it was insanely delicious and a huge serving for only $5. Overall, J. Alexander's really blew us away between the quality of the food and quality of customer service. We'll definitely be back for special occasions!"}, {"review_id": "IIsUG14y9lFoBXatQ1RJuw", "user_id": "cFq7Bg11cQNy0Pgmemxw5Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "TWO WORDS: CARROT CAKE. Seriously, it's so good that we have had it as our first course before, to make sure that we have enough room. The carrot cake at J Alexander's is better than Grandma's, no matter who your grandma is! I've only ever had great experiences at J Alexanders, which is why we keep going back.

Really nice place, didn't love we got seated in a booth in the bar. We tried the deviled eggs as an app, too sweet. I tried the chicken tender platter which were good but tiny. Ton of delicious fries. Coleslaw great flavor but very fine shred, didn't love that. We also shared the steak burger which had good flavor but very dry. Service was efficient. Overall just ok and hated that after tip, I paid $65 for just ok burger, tenders, fries and deviled eggs. Probably won't rush back."}, {"review_id": "9205ZGBgXZBoxvquj9t_Tw", "user_id": "_NEpLTDmaIkvQmchM6h9Sg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "I don't know why I haven't been back to J.Alexander's sooner. I love this place. Attentive servers, loud but classy atmosphere and great food. We stick to the prime rib and French dip sandwiches most of the time and we love their Mac and cheese! This time we got deviled eggs for an appetizer and they were topped with delectable pieces of candied bacon. Yum! When we made our reservation, they asked if we were celebrating an event and they gave us a card for  piece of cheesecake. It was served warm...We left satisfied!"}, {"review_id": "kspZ1jxxaFxC21wCpFRaTA", "user_id": "Z4QJ_V9jid4IRG4191MQZA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "This place was great!

First parking is crazy during dinner time so expect to be walking a little. Walking in there is seating on both sides of the host stand. The kitchen is wide open right behind for you to watch the amazing chefs do their thing.Listen a reservation isn't required but out of the two times I have visited I'm super glad I did. Don't try walking in for dinner you will be disappointed. The host gives you a vibrating gadget (hey stay with me lol) a lot like Cheesecake Factory when they are busy. When they goes off you will be seated soon. I also love how all staff wears all black.There is mostly booths here or half booths. I think when your party gets big in number you get a table and chairs. Service is phenomenal. Side note I don't really use that word but I swear this place fits it. You take a gulp from your drink another one is given to you. You push your plate to the end of the table, I'm sure if it tipped over the server or backwait would be there to catch it. They are just that on point with service.Food. So I have stuck with the imperial shrimp as an appetizer because it's soo good,$15. Shrimp taste fresh and has a good snap to it. I have had the kc strip and mac n cheese. That butter on the steak is great, $34. Had the crab cakes (which are market price) nothing but crab and tiny bits of bell pepper. How do they keep it together!! Tried the Thai pork lion, it's so tender. And the Maui steak, I tend not to like sweet steaks so this isn't for me, $34.Drinks. Strong and very good. Tried the 913 which now is my favorite and the knickerback. That second one will take you there I asked them to add syrup and soda to make it girly. Price I believe $12-14. Dessert. That Power is (wait I'm thinking) idk a word for it but it's soo good. Kinda upset my company took it as leftovers without telling me. It's an ice cream cake that's layered by Oreo cookies and sprinkled with snicker candy. Caramel and pecans on the plate. A must try.Lastly please taste their pomegranate lemonade. You will get it kinda late as they juice the lemons upon order!! How neat is that! This is my go to and I will be bringing family when they visit."}, {"review_id": "T-Byt48H5RnJw6iR7npKJw", "user_id": "_hKOSsh9L-dNxa30ahH8_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/23/2017", "text": "We love this restaurant.  One of my first choices for birthday dinners and special occasions.  I love the atmosphere, and the food is always great.  Some of the best service in town too.   Even better experience now that they accept reservations."}, {"review_id": "CI2FfKqAnFNAb-jkQJR-gg", "user_id": "s6BzwpasbNa1MkDJuBM7UQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "A consistently excellent experience.

Had made a reservation for 4 in advance for dinner because some family was in town. The night before I realized that I had miscounted and needed a table for 5 which required a different size table. They answered, even though it was after hours and said they would do their best to accommodate us even though it was going to be a busy night (prom season and Saturday night). Anyway, we arrived, got seated at a large table within a few minutes and as always, the food and service was on point. Definitely our recommendation goto spot if you want quality steakhouse food and service without spending the extra $$ at a couple of the other high end steakhouses."}, {"review_id": "quv7_BXNuq9KoNyy_UOkQw", "user_id": "BeLUWc-FPt4MciPBgqt2tg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/18/2017", "text": "First let me say hands down I would come back again. Everything was great from the time we walked in until the time we left. With it being mother's day weekend the place was packed. We had a party of 8 and couldn't get a reservation online so reserved 2 tables of 4. The times were only 15-30 minutes apart. When we arrived the table for 8 was an hour wait however since we had two reservations we asked if we could have 2 tables near each other and they accommodated us. The tables were one after another, then a table came available across from us and they let our adult children move.Josh was our server. He did a great job. He was very attentive to our needs. I dislike when I have to keep asking for water. He say how much we enjoyed the water and got a bottle to set on the table. Since we had been eating all day I really wasn't that hungry but knew I wanted to try the Cesar salad and the crab cake. Josh advised that the crab cakes were heart portions. For $34, it was well worth the 2 of them with the shoestring french fries. My sister and I shared the order. The crab cake s full of crab not bread crumbs or crackers. The Cesar salad was also super delicious, I could taste all the fresh ingredients. The dressing was on hit. The water was so crisp very the delicious I wanted to ask for a bottle to go. My sister had the prime rib. I tasted it and it was bursting with flavor and very tender. The next day she heated it up. It was still very tender."}, {"review_id": "LUDOirA-sQYQqnVAScH5Uw", "user_id": "WgmfpHFXeOo5VrKl5iKFtw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "J. Alexander's has always been amazing.

We made a reservation and showed up about 15 minutes early. They gave us a buzzer and we went to the bar to grab a drink to hold us over. I enjoyed the wine list openly on the wall as the bar was busy and made ordering quick and easy!  We  were seated around the time our reservation was supposed to be, the table was in the bar area which wasn't ideal but they were busy and we were a table of 2 so I don't give any fault! Our server was prompt and attentive, we brought in our own bottle of wine (no corkage fee on the first bottle which is AWESOME!) I ordered the crab cakes and my husband ordered the steak n fries. The crab cakes are fantastic, really crabby and very little breading, really just perfect. The steak was well cooked and had good flavor, however it was no Capital Grille or anything. Both our meals came with shoe string french fries which were addicting. Since we  were celebrating a special occasion, we were supposed to get free carrot cake, however my husband is allergic to nuts so they gave us the chocolate cake instead. Oh my gosh - order the chocolate cake. It was seriously the best and most fudgy cake. Overall, we had a great time and will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "8t8I9RK54VAn8r1xdHFuog", "user_id": "JYM-qLqCU6CL5UisBIovbQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/18/2017", "text": "I sat at the bar and ate my meal.
