Went out here b/c the people we wanted to go with said they love this place.Must admit, out of all the Sushi places we've been, this has been my absolute favorite. They took it back to service with warm wash cloths for that 'pre-eating' refreshing feel. Its been a long time since I'd been somewhere that offered that service.You can tell that this place hasn't been so 'Americanized' such that the service is single threaded. This place reminds me of some of my foreign travels where they are working hard to make sure that the customer is always satisfied and been given the best experience possible. Everything from refilled waters, authentic cuisine, and happy service, it's just awesome.The chef's in the back were working fervently on all their rolls and that alone was a sight to behold. The passion behind their work showed in the plates we received. The way the rolls were laid out on our plate was gorgeous. I can't emphasize this enough. This place is all about the detail. Will it cost a little more? Yes.. yes it will. However, if you're looking for good food, great service, and a quality experience overall, go here. It's a great date place and just does not disappoint.I can't wait to go back. I just wish you were closer to me! It's about a 40 minute drive to go here... however, I wouldn't hesitate to come back. =)Food taste - 5Overall Service - 5Value of food to cost - Â 5Facility - 5Repeat customer? - yes Dog friendly? - no"}, {"review_id": "CS507VR9ltIvpYKrA9hTiw", "user_id": "g3a4_11F4tFnYMZ7lpoBRg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "This is our favorite sushi restaurant in Hampton roads. The staff is always welcoming and attentive. The restaurant is always clean, and the food is consistent. My wife and I stopped in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. It was quite a few people there but it took us no time to get our food after we had decided what we wanted. We had the shumai as an appetizer and we had it fried. It was hot and delicious. The sauce it comes with is mainly sweet with a little salt. For entrees my wife ordered the Outer Banks roll and the Hanaki roll which she throughly enjoyed. I had the Teriyaki Steak box lunch which came with quite a bit of food. The steak wasn't as flavorful as I'd like but was cooked well. The gyoza was a little tough but ok overall, and the California roll was made perfectly!

I stopped by for a lunch meeting and we kept eating and eating and eating! The sushi was very good. Hawaii's roll, spicy salmon and tuna, and the list goes on. I don't think you could order one you wouldn't like here! The staff was very friendly and stopped by multiple times to check on us. The dining area and bathroom was clean. Great all around experience. I would recommend you check this place out.

The sushi was fresh and the staff was polite and attentive. A small sushi restaurant in a busy strip mall off of Hanbury Road. The only reason they received 3 stars instead of 4 is because they were very very skimpy with their salmon in the spicy salmon roll... maybe they were running low on fresh salmon? The other roll I ordered was a spicy tuna and there was plenty of tuna in the roll, so I cannot assume they were skimpy as a general rule. But there was just SO much of the crispy panko, it was really off-putting. I may give this restaurant another chance and will let you know how that goes."}, {"review_id": "necl8iJfcFBn8dmdxIuiZw", "user_id": "eNYPcOWnajpqwVfiwt60iQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "The best sushi in Chesapeake by a long shot.

Saying that, we have friends that live around the corner from the restaurant and they just LOVE the place, they order the same three sushi rolls and share, nothing else. So my advise, try it for yourself and decide.

I've had more than my share of sushi and nowhere have I experienced fresher ingredients and better presentation. Additionally, their gyoza isn't from the freezer! Every single thing I've ever ordered in this restaurant is consistently delicious. I don't want to stop eating but I force myself to do so. That's how good it is! The restaurant is small and it can be crowded at times, but it's worth the wait. You will always be given hot towels (I love this practice) and a complimentary cucumber salad starter to whet your appetite. It's a great way to start your dining experience. Service is fast and friendly, and they won't rush you out if you want to hang around. Can't recommend this place enough!"}, {"review_id": "P1kw0Yk-ytlylQo4vUvmFA", "user_id": "Ml9XttriiOlP95jtu9SSZQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "I ordered to go.

This place has great lunch specials so I took my mom here for lunch. We shared a chicken teriyaki bento box and the 2 sushi roll lunch combo and finished everything without feeling overstuffed. The sushi rolls.are delicious and they don't put too much rice in their sushi. It's a small restaurant with sushi bar and about 10 tables max, would not recommend for large parties, but better for small intimate meals."}, {"review_id": "V0Eduxt63k_tGQFBuYyhYA", "user_id": "J-9T4k3_bYYigxrhZc5_LQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "Where to begin. Let's go with location. I do like the area that this restaurant currently is set because it feels comfy and safe. My in laws live around the corner so I come to this area often. Lots of homes coming up in the area and it doesn't feel rundown. But, one thing I don't like is the small eating area inside due to its location. The ambience inside is well kept with the decorations and it doesn't feel like some cheap pop up joint that someone wanted to make money off of real quick. The wall are nicely decorated with the culture and it smells great when you go in, no stink of fish or grease. I didn't enjoy that it was loud, it wasn't with people talking or eating, it was from the cooking. Lots of dishes banging around and cutting. If the space had more open floor, and some decorations for sound dampening, it would be great. For the sushi, I cannot say in good faith I know sushi. I really enjoy it and I was not disappointed with this restaurant. It was more expensive than some sushi places I know but the cost was worth the cleanliness and good service we received. Heck we even got those Andes mints with the check! Not many places do that anymore! Nice touch. The presentation of the sushi was great, the cost for drinks wasn't too bad, and the selection available was enormous. I've never seen that many food options before. I didn't use the restroom so can't give any info on that, that usually can tell me just how well a place is maintained by how they choose to clean. So overall it was great, but I wish there was more space in the restaurant."}, {"review_id": "_JrJyw8MRDJtTY3VwGVIzQ", "user_id": "cWM6TLaxT23K5F03-_yrdQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "I went to this place on Valentine's Day.

I don't like American sushi restaurants that create nearly every sushi roll with 'spicy mayo.' Yuck. Haniki uses a variety of combinations to create flavorful rolls (very few have spicy mayo). Sashimi cuts are also beautiful and fish always tastes fresh. My kids also love the yakisoba and teriyaki."}, {"review_id": "1mQlDHZFyD6KKyCRHgy5Lg", "user_id": "TYx-H55r1hmZt1zyaI7c1A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/23/2017", "text": "The Gyoza is absolutely amazing.
