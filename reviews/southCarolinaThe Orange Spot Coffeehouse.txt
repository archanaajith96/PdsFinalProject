I found this little gem, and I'm glad I did. I ordered a flavor latte for about $5 (?)for the small size. They had a variety of cool flavors and really wanted to try them all, but ended up just doing two instead. I'm sure I looked a bit crazy for wanting  2 (sage and lavender). I really wanted to add cardamom too! What can I say, I love these flavors. The coffee was nice and smooth, very light in taste; although it is light but the flavor is still there. I think that's always my biggest concern is when coffee looks a bit watery, I'm afraid it would taste like coffee water. I also got a blueberry lemon turnover lookalike pastry; it was really good! It wasn't too sweet, and a perfect blend between lemon and blueberry flavors. The texture was perfectly paired with my coffee -- a densely pack airy&buttery layers. Charleston, you done did it. P.s The barista measures everything:)"}, {"review_id": "TSsk_n-Yjf6gKt-0qMrdKA", "user_id": "MhlX4zIjst2erO_v72GRwg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "This is a really nice, cozy coffee shop.

There was no parking in front of the coffee shop, but I found a place to park just a little further down the historic strip.  I was disappointed that the menu boasted of a lot of pastries, but when I came in (a few hours before closing) they only had about five things in the display remaining for the day.  I shrugged it off and picked a slice of the sweet potato bread (it was just alright).  I had a cup of the Thai tea, which, to be fair, the woman who rang me up told me it was sweet, but I read good things on the Yelp reviews so I figured I'd give it a try.  Turns out it WAS too sweet for me, which was a shame, but at least I tried it! I asked for a cup of water instead since it ended up being too sweet, and I was directed to the water in the center of the room, which was fine, but I come from a customer service background so it was a missed opportunity for the worker to go above and beyond and say \"I'm sorry it's too sweet for you, can I interest you in anything else?\" When I was done there wasn't any clear spot to put my cup, plate and fork, so when I asked where the trash can was and where I should take them the worker responded \"uhh, normally it goes [in the dish rack?] but I guess I can take it for you.\"  I had no problem taking it wherever it belonged but I ended up feeling bad that I didn't know where it was supposed to go. Overall it was just a kind of awkward experience, but I could tell that locals probably liked it.  I was just disappointed it didn't live up to the Yelp hype."}, {"review_id": "Sh5DusDyt0Qp-8QppjarzQ", "user_id": "YvfU5_gDkflMJZEyXZuZ3A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "The thing that really charmed me about this place was the friendly, welcoming, & knowledgeable staff! In addition, an awesome & noteworthy fact is that they have HOUSE-MADE flavored syrups with unique varieties such as lavender, sage, cardamom, and others, along with the usual classics. I ordered a latte breve flavored with toasted pecan syrup for a touch of sweetness. The latte was not too sweet... It was just right. I have to agree with Din N. The coffee is very light and smooth.The husband ordered a \"Dangling Carrot\" smoothie (carrot, spinach, banana, clementine, mixed berries, & apple). It had such a natural sweetness despite no added sugars, which is a plus, as far as I'm concerned!Local art was on the walls and the vibe was peaceful.

Orange Spot has a nice space, but it feels kind of sterile and lacking in character. Very open. The little seating there is, is not very comfortable. Plenty of outside space to sit, but again, not seating that makes me want to hang out and enjoy myself. Dog friendly patio. Service is ok. My biggest complaint is, although they offer Oat-ly (non dairy 'creamer' made from oats), they charge extra for it. It's a bummer for those with allergies to have to pay extra. I understand that Oat-ly costs more, but after speaking with other baristas, the cost of offering Oat-ly balances out in the end."}, {"review_id": "CcnQy2jHjbaNk59lu9lJXA", "user_id": "tGzF4IefTUwaCb3b8Vo9qQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Ok, hear me out. My fiancée and I (interracial couple) visited this establishment for the first time. We're avid yelpers and looked for the closest 4.5 star/100+ review coffee shop as we always do :)We ordered the pound cake and sweet potato bread which looked delicious in the glass case! Each piece was 1.5 inches thick and fluffy...We order the bread, they were placed in a bag and we were on our way to a local park to enjoy our bread.  We un-bagged our bread and we were shocked to see that we'd been given the 2 slices of left over end pieces that were unevenly cut and paper thin in some parts! What the heck?? Not just one piece, but both pieces were uneven end pieces. Mind you, there were at least 20 other pieces of bread in the glass case, so it's not like we were getting the last two pieces. Fast forward to when we arrived back at the cafe to return the bread. They were uneaten, obviously, and we had not tampered with them. We brought them to the counter and expressed our concern. The first response to us was \"I don't know if we can take these back and resell them.\" The manager, who was standing right there, didn't interject but waited until she was directly asked. Her response was \"well, have they been eaten?\", to which we replied \"of course not\". She eventually agreed to exchange the bread, without ever looking at us or apologizing for any inconvenience or admitting to any wrong doing.I don't know what else to say, but I think the photos speak for themselves. The 4 photos are before and after photos, it's easy to tell which ones are which! And stop giving shitty products to minorities!!!Side note, the bread and coffee were great! 4 Stars there... service and employees 0 stars!!"}, {"review_id": "hWTp6-r0Bc99W8XzevTwyg", "user_id": "GPNojpFW_tUw5voNeZz0lQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "The best coffee shop in Park Circle that acclimates all - with outdoor and indoor seating, tasteful decor and a broad menu.

New faces, new staff, new location, and along with it has come new experiences. Due to my previous visits at the old location, I swore off Orange Spot, but decided to give it a go 3 times in the past week and was pleasantly surprised. I ended up trying their chai latte, which is spicy with a nice bite minus the overwhelming sweetness of most coffee shops, Starbucks notably. Both times the customer service was on the money. The first time, the employees took the time out to introduce themselves to me, mostly because they see me everyday walking my dog past Orange Spot. They were chatty and friendly. Win win. Went again and was greeted by different faces, faces I actually recognize from the last time I visited Orange Spot, but they were friendly, asked about my pup, offered me a candy cane..win win.The third time was this morning, and I was met with the young lady who was there the first time I visited Orange Spot this week. After only being there once, she not only remembered my name, but exactly what I ordered the last time--win win girl!I like the minimal decor of this location. The last location was small, cramped and crowded with too much. Too much going on. I like the aesthetic of this place. My 16oz dirty chai latte costs almost $7--yikes. Will definitely try the coffees, but can say for now that I will visit Orange Spot in the future because they have done a superior job of making me feel welcomed, back."}, {"review_id": "5XX8EM_MV0uOdpORzXojFw", "user_id": "j9cgaVeUBTM2QGO3W__REA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/23/2017", "text": "Very nice and cozy spot located in lovely park circle .

The only \"complaint\" (not really one for me but I'm sure there are people who would be bothered by it) there is a fairly constant noise of beans grinding/machines whirring/etc. you can hear pretty much everywhere but that's a coffee shop in my opinion.

A very hip cutesy little house that has been turned into the mecca for morning Java in this area of town. The coffee is good. I had my usual, Quad Latte. It hit the spot. The last time I was in this area I ended up driving about six miles to curb my craving for coffee. Not knowing this little spot was right around the corner.  Staff were friendly and helpful and the place was busy about 11;30 am. Lots of local workers coming in to get their mid morning fix.

I wasn't especially hungry so I ordered the pb&j smoothie with skim milk. I could have had that put in an IV because it was addicting. My brunch date ordered a latte (he says he should have added more sugar), a piece of the quiche (took a long time to make its way out to us) and a blondie (not fresh but still very good).We sat outside at a two-top under a tree. Honestly, I could have stayed there all day as it wasn't too hot and there was a lovely breeze. It would have been nice to have some light music playing in the background or have access to napkins without having to go all the way around to the front, but even so, I was a fan.

I ended up there this past weekend looking for a coffee and a small bite to eat before heading to a friends surprise party in the area. At first I was surprised at how busy it was on a Sunday at 1pm. There were plenty of people enjoying a Sunday coffee with friends or on a solo dive into their laptops. There wasn't even a place to sit. I realized after the fact that there's a backyard, but luckily a table opened up while I was waiting and we jumped on it.We had the two daily quiches and I had a Cold Brew Iced Coffee. I was interested in trying the Japanese Iced coffee but needed to caffeinate and decided to go with a sure thing. The cold brew was great and if it wasn't so strong, I could have easily ordered another before heading out. The quiches were both fluffy as cotton and encased in a perfectly crisp crust. The Feta and Spinach was delicious, but the Bacon and Swiss was the undeniable quiche winner. I'm looking forward to coming back on a day that's not over 100° to check out the back yard and enjoy another cold brew.

A nice Cuban sandwhich, a bottled coke and a healthy choice banana was a nice, light lunch at $13 even.  Waiting 7 or 8 minutes for a sandwich compresses the dining time, so maybe next time I either take more time or pick something else.  The Cuban was surprisingly good, crispy bread, some snap in the pickle, a hint of brown mustard and ample meat and cheese to make a smallish sanwhich just enough for lunch.  The interior strikes a cool balance of brightness and color, and the seats and wallpaper all helped to give a cool, Springish vibe. As I was dining in, though, I had to take up a four top because the lunch counter only holds three. A small table it two by a window might be a good move, as I felt a little self conscious holding a whole table.  The staff are upbeat and relaxed, making for a very welcome feeling.   The OS has an interesting selection of craft beers that might lure me back after work one afternoon, and I can definitely imagine dropping in on a Saturday morning for a cup and soak in the Zen."}, {"review_id": "aK2q9Vt4TaYJPzF2TlMLrw", "user_id": "8k_XBpxdd5m599aVB32VRQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "Warm, chill and relaxing place to be.

The two ladies who own it have always been pleasant and welcoming even if I can tell the coffee rush is taking a toll! The house is very quaint and works well for the coffeehouse setting. There are plenty of comfy chairs inside and they have a very nice and clean bathroom. The outdoor seating has helped a lot because it often gets crowded inside or there just isn't much privacy. As far as their food goes, I haven't tried it yet. I'm rarely there for a long enough time to want a bite to eat but it looks delicious so I know it will be good when the day comes. My favorite drink is by far the cha yen. It's orange color is fun and it tastes SO good. It's great for a summer day or any warm day regardless of season (classic Charleston...). Some of their seasonal special drinks have been really good too, and my friends who love coffee speak highly of the coffee too.
