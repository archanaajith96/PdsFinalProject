Staff is incredible, helpful and friendly. Food is eclectic and unique without being off-putting or intimidating. Their menu changes frequently which is always nice to see. Lots of small plate options so a great place to try a little bit of everything. Great wine selection.The space is industrial yet inviting. It's definitely off the beaten path so you won't find it by accident, so I encourage you to seek it out for your next date night or special celebration."}, {"review_id": "U-RE_zRDqWFlcOSoItFx0A", "user_id": "F7cs_XVKw5al8XB3LD6csw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "This was my second meal. It was as wonderful as the first. Intriguing ingredients in interesting combinations created new taste sensations that were fresh, enjoyable and delicious.These combinations were unusual without being weird.

Delightful experience."}, {"review_id": "BlY-NiVdu8i-H9N_ySLOEg", "user_id": "bxM1A16EleUvU3MM3wQn7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/20/2017", "text": "Amazing service friendly staff, quick kitchen. Delicious food, my husband loved the pit roast and FINALKY they had something other than grilled cheese and chicken fingers for the kids... ramen! The kiddo loved it. I went with a pinot gris, lovely and some Brussels sprouts. Delicious!We ended up ordering the Apple crisp and the lavender creme brulee.

The employees were very friendly and sat us down quickly and we really enjoyed the layout of the restaurant. We were starving and the wings were uniquely delicious. I ordered the pot roast entree and other than the position was on the small size but it was very delicious. My coworkers ordered the burger and they both thoroughly enjoyed it. Still hungry we all ordered the desserts and I went with the bread pudding which was delicious. The creme brulee had lavender in it which was very overpowering. Overall it was a good dinner and the prices were fair."}, {"review_id": "6pnXMQGic3rnx-uAZuv0qg", "user_id": "ouDR5CnFknY-CTTlHtz5gw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/21/2017", "text": "What a gem to find in Billings, MT! My husband and I opted to order a few small plates and share. Their menu is small, thoughtful, and well-curated. However, they only had one vegetarian entree. So we chose the warm olives, a cheese tray (chèvre), two small kale salads, and the roasted Brussels sprouts. Each dish was wonderful. The other review that said the Brussels were greasy must have been a one-off. These were well-roasted and came with a delicious roasted tomato aioli dip. The chèvre plate came with warm, fresh house-made activated charcoal sourdough slices. I recommend to the chef to include 4 pieces rather than 3! Please! While we were waiting for our meal I saw the chef enter the neighboring patio garden area and clip some kale. I'm pretty sure that's where our salads came from. How awesome is that? They have angry hanks Street Fight on tap which was a huge plus. I'm excited to bring guests here when they visit and to see how their menu changes and evolves with the changing seasons!"}, {"review_id": "7CioPYEBlE6FFn8yuqjKzA", "user_id": "mdvODN4jjxGItZbcx5Vcug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "This restaurant is simply fantastic.

I know how to make good Brussels, but I can't make them this good. I would order these again and again.The meatloaf sandwich was served with blue cheese, huckleberry BBQ sauce, and creamy coleslaw, on a soft potato roll. It was similarly perfect. I appreciated that the meatloaf was cooked  individually, maximizing the crisp brown edges on all sides, rather than being sliced from a larger loaf.The service was warm, skillful, and attentive. I always like when we get our own carafes of water and iced tea, especially on a hot day like today.The architecture of the space definitely added to our enjoyment. In addition to being 100% accessible, it was also pleasing to the eye: big open spaces, well lit, and interesting details that reward closer inspection. They have several dining areas, including indoor and outdoor spaces, all of which were lovely. I've been told the architect was even involved in making changes to the train that runs past, so that they no longer need to blow their horn while driving through downtown. Those kinds of details demonstrate an architect that is truly committed to the betterment of downtown Billings.If this restaurant were in SF or LA, they'd have lines out the door. As it was, we enjoyed an uncrowded and peaceful lunch, on a quiet Monday afternoon, and we loved every second of it."}, {"review_id": "I0ZriTlv5Jhng1FgJHwphg", "user_id": "RRL-39lWkD7OskfNv2q8bA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Sunday brunch left little to be desired.

We found ourselves intentionally eating slowly so as to savor every bite!  The only reason I went four and not 5 stars was because we had a reservation but were still made to wait 15 mns then were sat at a communal table.

It's very out of the way and a little hard to find. The food was fantastic I had the chicken wrap with blue bird chicken. It was amazingly juicy and fresh! I'm not sure what the sauce that was in it was but it was paired perfectly, just enough to keep the whole thing from being dry but not so much as it was soggy!

Apparently wrong door, but...looked at dinner and lunch menus, and...hmmm...just now opening for lunch, and menu looks interesting. So...have asked for sparkling water drink. Is apparently from Clarks,MT. Cool. Also Olive app, and a Albacore Tuna thing as main. Beautiful setting here street side, beside a glass roll up garage door. I really like this feature, though decor will NOT sell me on any food stops. My boss this flying trip, ChrisH, and his coworkers came here last evening and invited me but I had just finished dinner at another place. Dang. I should have come anyway. Olive app is warmed, with several olive varieties, fresh orange, whole garlic...really good. Albacore dish has about 6 small slices of tuna atop spinach leaves and small apple slices, on a thick portion of real wheat bread. Nice. $14 for it. Is plenty. All is beautiful and wonderful to eat.

WCGW? I started dinner with the kale salad. A mound of kale smothered in shredded manchego cheese was cut up into nice bite-sized pieces and made for easy eating. I'm surprised at how rare it is for restaurants to do this. I love me some salad, but it's usually such a laborious affair to cut through the pile of leaves that I rarely finish before the main meal arrives. I did happen to finish every bite of kale and apple, though. For the main entree, I ordered the scallop dish. If I had to eat one thing for the rest of my life, it would be this dish. Cooked to a caramelized perfection on a bed of I'm not sure what...lentils? Don't know, don't care. It was all delicious. My one and only complaint is that there were only three delicious, velvety scallops on my plate. I could have eaten 20, but for an entree I was expecting at least five. I was still a bit hungry after the scallop dish, so I considered the dessert options. They don't have a dessert menu, but my server went through the options. I decided on an apple-cranberry crisp served a la mode. The tart fruit, sweet crumble, and creamy vanilla ice cream melded together for the perfect finish to an amazing meal."}, {"review_id": "ofCRzZD8ztl0PWviVrYGcA", "user_id": "66yGMxhVFEvRyzq7qd2NEw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "10/27/2017", "text": "I have eaten here before and given The Field House excellent reviews, but tonight was an exception to those previous ratings. The service was exceptional, among the best I've seen at any restaurant. Unfortunately, the food was BAD! I had the meatloaf, which is traditionally one of their best selling dishes, but tonight, it was dry as dirt. This was about the worst meatloaf I can remember. Tonight's special desert was bread pudding, which was similar to a thick slice of French toast. This also was over cooked. It was black and burnt on the bottom. The gentalman next to me ordered the creme brûlée, he complained that it was also burnt. I don't know who the chef was tonight, but he was not on his A game.

I chose this place because of their claim to use local ingredients and wasn't disappointed. We called at 10am on Sunday to make a reservation for three at 11am with no problem. We showed up a few minutes late, but we're still seated right away.The ambience is clean and bright with a lot of natural light and minimal decor. I really liked the big stool in our section of the restaurant that had been stripped on the top and now showcases an antique meat cleaver under a custom piece of glass.Service was quick and friendly. I will say that the water they serve is heavily chlorinated and I think it would serve Fieldhouse well to invest in a quality water filter.When ordering our food my mom ordered the huevos rancheros and my aunt ordered the boring breakfast. When my time came I asked our server what his favorite thing on the menu is and he said huevos rancheros, hands down. I said, great! I'll take those. He then suggested that since my mom got them I should get the Benedict and we could share. I told him that I'm not a Benedict person, to which he responded, okay! But just so you know, we have been told that our Benedict changes lives.Well, how could I resist a challenge like that? So I went with the Benedict and we also ordered a round of the mimosa special: pineapple sage.The mimosa came out in a generous wine glass. At first I wasn't sure if I liked the pineapple sage, but the flavor grew on me and by the end I really appreciated it's crisp and refreshing flavor.When our food came out we were not disappointed. It was beautifully presented and smelled divine. My mom's huevos rancheros incorporated the perfect balance of sauce to meat to eggs to beans. Instead of a tortilla on the bottom it's served with crispy tortilla strips on top. The dish had a tangy BBQ flavor and the meat was tender and perfectly seasoned. Our server wasn't wrong about the Benedict. The eggs were perfectly poached and served on a tender brisket which sat on a crispy triangle of polenta. The pesto hollandaise sauce was the best I've ever had. Delicate and not overly creamy every bite was well balanced between creamy and savory.My aunt really liked her boring breakfast. The toast came with some fresh and yummy raspberry jelly. Not sure if they make it in house, but it was really good! The side of hash browns were really good too. Nice and savory and crispy on the outside.Each entree came to about $12/ person and the mimosas were $8. Coming from San Francisco, $20 for brunch is a total steal, especially one this delicious. Speaking of which, if this place was in SF there would be lines out the door every weekend.The quality of food shines in each dish. I will definitely be back next time we come through town!"}, {"review_id": "-AVxNSdBd08xoPDC6AHM9Q", "user_id": "SfHuT-z94sj_GDTCxf8Kqg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/3/2017", "text": "Clean atmosphere, the food was really clean and fresh.

The flavors and quality of ingredients were amazing. Try the Brussels. You will not be disappointed. Coffee is great and better than most restaurant coffee. The crepes are good as well. The day we went we got the chefs choice crepe which was a buckwheat crepe with mozzarella and pesto on the inside, topped with tomato and avocado crema, all served on top of a tomato-Ish soup. I got the donuts which were moist and cake like on the inside, and perfectly fried on the outside. I got a side of eggs which were perfectly cooked and seasoned well.
