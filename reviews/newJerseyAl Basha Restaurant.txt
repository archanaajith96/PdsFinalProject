Right from the excellent hospitality, to the introductory appetizers and the light fluffy and well baked pita. We are vegetarians, and Mediterranean food generally tops the list of our healthy options. We ordered fava beans soup, which had a delicious tangy taste to it, alongwith an assortment of dips (muhammara, babaganoush, hummus) falafel and tabbouleh salad...hands down the best so far. Do NOT forget to have their signature lemon mint drink..makes me cringe why I am not living in Paterson"}, {"review_id": "GPmMd9OUTW_HXA9i6lpzqw", "user_id": "Uep2R930eLyff1bz9EWStg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "The first time I visited this restaurant the food was delicious, but I don't know if there is a new chef or a new management because the food is no longer the same. I always get beef shawarma and hummus. The hummus is always delicious no complaints about BUT the shawarma was a total disappointment. First time was juicy, tender, full of flavor...... now it was literally meat  in a flat bread wrap with no flavor. If I comeback will be only for the hummus This restaurant is located in a very commercial area in Paterson.

The place is very warm and welcoming, the staff is sweet and they make sure to take the order right as well as suggest the house best dishes. Talking about the food, authentic, fresh, tasty, and absolutely delicious. We had Al-Basha mixed grill platter ($25.99) large enough for 2 people.

Server was great and they had a gentlemen dressed in traditional Middle Eastern attire and he came around greeting you and giving you traditional Middle Eastern Coffee.  Great experience and will definitely be back if we are in Patterson."}, {"review_id": "uMwGwkMiqhmNcKytd5WoKA", "user_id": "PHNfSndIGxx1mds097MJEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I loved this place.

Al Basha offers a solid core menu and popular daily specials in a family-friendly setting with booths and table seating. Complementary neon pink pickled turnips were served after ordering.FOOD and DRINKS:Fresh Frozen Lemonade w/ Mint ($3.99): My tabled ordered a couple of Al Basha's signature drinks, and we loved it. It's tart, sweet, and refreshing.Stuffed Falafel (4 for $4.99): These large falafel were freshly fried, giving each one a nice crisp exterior and piping hot chick pea and spiced onion center/filling. I'd order these again.Hummus w/ Pita ($4.99): We had no intention of ordering hummus, but the gentleman who took our order made it sound as if it came with the falafel; it doesn't. However, we didn't mind paying for it since it was delicious! The hummus was topped with olive oil and chick peas and had a light, almost whipped texture.Al Basha Platter for 2 ($29.99): \"MEAT\" (yes, in all caps) basically summarizes what you're getting. This has a little of everything--kofta, shawarma, beef shish kebab, chicken shish kebab, and a lamb chop over rice pilaf with a grilled tomato and grilled onion.Both shish kebabs and the shawarma were the most flavorful, but the taste of char on the kofta and lamb chop was more pronounced than any seasoning that went on them. Nonetheless, I'd still recommend the Al Basha Platter for those seeking variety and a generous amount of food to share.The Kofta Platter ($11.99), which comes with four skewers of kofta with the aforementioned accompaniments, is a great choice if you have a hankering for these tender ground beef kebabs.SERVICE:We were warmly welcomed by the staff as we walked in for lunch, who were also prompt in getting us whatever we needed as we dined. NOTE: They automatically added 20% gratuity/a tip to our check, which explains why we paid an extra $13+ on top of the tip we had already left; we were a party of 3 yesterday (10/2/17).OVERALL:While we are by no means connoisseurs of Middle Eastern cuisine, Al Basha is a solid option in an area with plenty of good competition. The food is delicious, the service is friendly, and the prices are reasonable."}, {"review_id": "m8jFYwmf6TjmuExI42pdFQ", "user_id": "1P2-csezbZ1zKI7bTQ9XjQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/9/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Note this is for a 09/02/2017 visit to Al Basha.Al Basha was super busy with customers as the day before was a Muslim holiday (Eid al-Adha).However, me and my sister were seated very quickly and placed our orders comprised of:Starters: Fattoush salad, Fatteh Eggplant (note this is not on their online menu), and Hummus & Foul.- Fattoush salad was awesome with crunchy lettuce, cooling cucumbers, tangy red onions, juicy tomatoes, toasted pita, and a nice olive oil dressing with sumac.- Fatteh Eggplant was okay, but nowhere near the benchmark of this dish served at nearby Abu Rass. The eggplant was not that discernable, and their wasn't the delicious toasted pita bread pieces I've come to expect in this dish.- Hummus & Foul was really good. Hummus was smooth (which I normally don't like), but the fava beans added the missing texture and the luxurious olive oil was a great addition.For entrees I had the Kofta Kebab platter and my sister chose the Chicken Shawarma platter.- The four sizable Kofta Kebabs were each cooked perfectly with a nice grill char, and still maintaining juicy and fatty goodness inside. Flavors of the Kofta were excellent; I could taste parsley and of course some yummy lamb gaminess.The rice was delicious as well with a distinct flavor as if cooked in some sort of rich stock.- My sister's Chicken Shawarma platter was served with Babaganouj, Muhammara, and if I recall Labne.She enjoyed the Shawarma, especially the slightly crispy charred edge pieces, and also the seasoning of the chicken which had a notable cumin flavor.Babaganouj was nice with a chunky texture and a perfect level of smokiness from the eggplant.Labne was excellent; creamy and decadently rich.She also ordered a mint lemonade (from Al Basha's extensive fresh juice menu) and it was good, having a really strong lemon flavor.Of note was the freshly warmed Pita bread which made for the perfect dipping vessel for the appetizers we enjoyed.Overall Al Basha was very good and a worth your patronage."}, {"review_id": "dx_ItGnhldm0C1MPp_LtPA", "user_id": "ZPt9vwc5lk9XOyeug228MQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "My absolute favorite.

I've never had a disappointing experience coming here. The food is always on point as well as their drinks and service.My friends and I decided to come to Albasha to break our fast together one last time before the month was over. We were quickly seated outside (which is in front of the store and not as bad as it sounds lol) and ordered our food within the first 10 min we were there. We ordered a few things like hummus, baba ghanoush, fried cheese, and a mixed plate. Now the plate is advertised that it is for two people, but it can easily feed three, four if y'all don't eat a lot. Their hummus is the best hummus I've ever had hands down. I'm not a big fan of baba ghanoush, but my friends said it was better than the hummus, so I tried it. It was great an all, but the hummus is way better. The fried cheese is well fried cheese you cannot mess that up to be honest. The mixed plate was great. Each meat was cooked to perfection, nothing under or over cooked. It was with cubed chicken, cubes beef, lamb chops, and kufta. Talk about a good way to break your fast."}, {"review_id": "Ys3lv_vp8JRO8RK39ivEmA", "user_id": "tqCEYjaZUeerIZaXE8tVMg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Amazing food.

I would definitely recommend getting the mint lemonade because it is freshly made and so worth it. For the main course, everyone ordered a mixture of things. I got the kofta platter and I thought it was so delicious and the portions were huge. The shawarma looked amazing. I tried the chicken kabab and the lamb shish. Both were absolutely amazing. We split the bill and everyone ended up paying about $20, which is inexpensive compared to other places. Because we were so many people, it took time for the food to come out.

The wait staffs intention is to try to sell you one of their freshly squeezed drinks, which I don't want.I am going to continue to go here, so If they start serving water when customers ask for it, I would give them 4 starts. I also would like to see the wait staff make customers who are non Arab customers feel more comfortable here by being friendly and offer us the same quality service they offer to the Arab customers.I also never order dessert here since they only have Baklava and there are several bakery's across the street that have many selections of sweets & pastries."}, {"review_id": "0VUwDLbjRUsH2Pv9OqrKMA", "user_id": "fFrC1CbSCV4H8ytrg3CA0A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/26/2017", "text": "Another gr8 place to eat if ur craving for some Arabic dishes.Service was excellent.I think i ate alot of the pita  bread that was served at the start.
