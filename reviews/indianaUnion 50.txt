I went with a small group and we decided to order a lot, so we could try different dishes. The atmosphere is cool and trendy, often becoming a music venue when the night calls for it. We had duck fries, wings, special fish dish, wild mushrooms, gnocchi, pork chop, shrimp and grits and carrot cake. The all stars were really the wings, the special fish of the night, mushrooms, shrimp and grits, and the pork chop! Great portions, presentation and flavor. Seriously delicious! The least flavorful item was the gnocchi. I'd skip that one. This is a classy and delicious place to take guests.

The atmosphere is trendy with an industrial feel. The bar is very aesthetically pleasing. I opted for beer so I cannot comment on the cocktails. Our group decided to share fries (manchego/bacon and duck fat/rosemary) and chilaquiles poutine as appetizers. All were good but the chilaquiles was extremely tasty, so I would definitely recommend that! Someone had this as their meal as well.I ordered the east street salad and chorizo scallops. Both were really good but smaller on the portion side.  The scallops were cooked exactly how I like. Overall this was a good dinner, but slightly overpriced for what you get. However, if I find myself back in Indianapolis someday I would likely return."}, {"review_id": "SehcEbVKE2riKjY6lGNoUw", "user_id": "jRiy7sOkSQA_0SqjCNmJQw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "We had a wonderful pre-theatre meal here.

We booked around the first and they were already full until 8pm! We chose a spot for 8:15. When we arrived we were seated immediately. It didn't seem overly crowded so I'm thinking we missed the dinner crowd. We started with drinks of course. I got wine and he got a cocktail. My wine was pretty good as was his cocktail. We then got the poutine fries (the name was something like chilaquiles) with the cheese on the side. We both really enjoyed them and thought they were actually quite filling. I would definitely get them again. For the main course my bf got the lamb and I got the special fish dish. The presentation was beautiful, it almost made me not want to eat it! I got one meal out of mine (probably could've gotten two) and my boyfriend got two meals out of his. His lamb was good but he liked the pork chop he got last time better. Overall I recommend you try it at least once and go with the courses that stay on the menu (so loved they can't rotate them)."}, {"review_id": "Dt0DPuip6VFsb1ataQSOdQ", "user_id": "y84GjrYgdvFOWaqmPCVTnA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "At the moment, I'm enjoying an amazing craft cocktail, beautiful ambience and an amazing dinner.

I've always seen a mish-mash of people in here, so I wouldn't say it's geared to just one type of demographic. Food & drinks have always been top-notch.

GREAT place for date night...The live music is a nice touch too. Wait staff is very knowledgeable of the menu.Cons; We had a reservation and we still had to wait 15 mins to be seated at a table that was available thee entire time. The parking sucks, but they do have valet for 8 bucks however if u leave after midnight u will have to find your own vehicle because valet closes at midnight.Food: I had the steamed mussels for an app. which were almost Devine. Very fresh. Had the ribeye for my main course. It was cooked to perfection. Highly recommended. We also split the duck fat fries I could eat those things everyday. Drinks: I had the white sangria which is very lite ,the rosemary was a surprisingly delicious touch. It was so good we order two more rounds.Caution ladies if you mush wear heels make a chunky heel, because the cobblestone entry way might just break your ankle if not careful.Overall: I was satisfied with the experience and would come again."}, {"review_id": "x50u3M2plg76uigLAPP8zg", "user_id": "kMXPkvGLJBLgkZVLPQmSlw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Not knowing Indy, we chose this place for an early pre-concert dinner. Good choice!  It's a large trendy space with a warehouse vibe and a great bar area.  The menu has so many desirable items!  Our server Jared provided good and attentive service and was engaging. Great job!  My husband started with the Wood-Fired San Marzano Tomatoes & Goat cheese which was served with grilled bread to smear the woodsy and creamy tomato and cheese onto. Yum!  I had The East Street Salad, which tasted great but was so much smaller in size than what my husband had in the same category. I was disappointed since I had a small fish entree. The salad had delicato squash, apple & fennel. It was fresh and good but the little strip of salad down the middle of the plate looked great but not much to eat. For entrées, my husband had the kimchi meatloaf served with potato fritters. It was plentiful and tasty. It was in the smaller bistro category than my swordfish in the grand section of the menu, but again mine was a smaller portion. WTH??  As a women who eats healthier and went down 4 sizes, I do expect good sized-portions as the food is lighter than fatty fare. Anyway, the swordfish was out of this world good, perfectly grilled and moist. I loved the cauliflower purée, too. The food here is outstanding. I highly recommend it. If I'm in town again, I would order a third item so I wouldn't walk away not fully satisfied like I did this visit."}, {"review_id": "lXPmDZ49ULV8MOHyijVQ0g", "user_id": "HFCavLM1x9OCVgNM2Ax4Mw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Fun atmosphere, great food and dessert was amazing too!

It's very intimate and they usually have live music on the weekends. Their cocktail menu is great, but I usually go for the Old Fashioned. I've never had one quite like there's. I've never had a full meal here, as I never visit during regular menu times. So I usually get fries and chicken wings. These aren't your typical sports bar wings and fries though. The weeks are wonderfully sticky and seasoned. They are Asian style with the perfect balance of sweet and tangy. The fries come different ways and you get a choice of two dipping sauces. I've only had the truffle oil fries and I like it best with the garlic aioli. You can always find a good band here as well. They have a calendar that lists all the performances for the month. It makes for a great night cap after a night on the town."}, {"review_id": "PkTjEm7-az2tXEneDOw8Cw", "user_id": "uYBskWDsfuLfCvivsiVCtw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/18/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Updated review: my boyfriend and I went tonight for my birthday and had an amazing time. We got charcuterie and cheese, 2 petite dishes, 2 bistro dishes, and 1 main. The selection of charcuterie is amazing. The beef tartare and tuna were amazing. The skate wing is still my favorite and my boyfriend had the toast and jam which I highly recommend!! We also got the shrimp and grits which we had to take home because we were so full. Amazing experience. Definitely worth the visit. Previous visit: Very decent restaurant in Indy! A little overpriced in my opinion, but they have skate wing on the menu which is my favorite fish! Their menu doesn't change as much as I think it should, but it's always a dependable, predictable meal. Try the skate wing! New menu!! No skate wing, but the lamb shank is amazing!!! As always, get the charcuterie because it's phenomenal. Heather behind the bar is slinging some amazing cocktails and Brandon will take care of your table.

We let the chef pick our meat and cheese that paired best with our wine, and the smoked salmon was not something I would have picked and none of us ate it. We also tried the carrot cake which was definitely house made and delicious. Service was definitely slow and sub-par, don't go here if you are on a strict time schedule,  but my only complaint was the music was so loud that we couldn't even talk. There was a group of 6 of us and you had to scream to talk to the person next to you and you couldn't even hear the person across from you. We were there for a girls night and we couldn't even talk.

In other words, it is a pub that serves high quality food (i.e. good enough for foodies).  The space is large, open, and has high ceilings.  While the layout is perfect for a place that features live music, it is not conducive for quiet dinner conversations.  Union 50 obviously has a sizeable bar area, stocked with the finest of libations.  It also has several large televisions, which feature sporting events.  My personal preferences clearly conflict with the concept of Union 50.  People shouting over a football game shouldn't be mixed with a fine dining experience.  Regardless, this has not deterred multiple return visits.  I recommend getting a reservation if you plan to dine at Union 50 - as the seating process can be rather chaotic.  I blame this not on the restaurant's staff, but on the noise level and the layout of the place - there is no defined waiting area. Union 50 is ultra-modern.  On one visit, our table, in the back room, had to be pulled in-and-out each time food was served, as well as when one needed to use the restroom.  I found that to be annoying.  Sitting in the main dining room is much easier.  On a very positive note, our service has always top-notch.  Our servers have never missed a beat, drink refill, or faltered when asked a question about the menu.  On one occasion, the waitstaff went to great lengths to craft a pillow so my family member could comfortably sit after having surgery.  This professionalism is what separates Union 50 from other restaurants.  The food at Union 50 is nothing less than fantastic.  We started with the Duck Fat Fries with house ketchup and aioli.  While not the best in town, they were good enough to justify a second round.  I ordered the Roasted Chicken \"Grand Plate.\"  The meat was especially tender and the chili-balsamic gastrique rub really tied the dish together.  On the side came a drizzle of rosemary sweet potato and a pinch of Brussels sprouts.  While the taste of the dish was grand, the size was not. The Kimchi Meatloaf is another popular choice at Union 50 - and with good reason.  This isn't Grandma's meatloaf; we're talking the best rendition of an American favorite that I have ever tasted.  Soft and tender with a subtle tang from the kimchi, every bite is worth savoring.  If you're hungry, order two of them!  My, my!  Have you tried the chilaquiles?  A unique take on the popular Mexican dish, it trades the tortilla chips for hand-cut fries.  The guajillo pulled pork really makes the dish all-the-more hearty. While the chilaquiles proves to be the perfect snack before a grand meal, it will bring out the selfish traits in your personality (i.e. you won't want to share them).  Don't leave before ordering the Tomahawk Pork Chop.  It is large, wholesome, and packed with piquant flavor from the pickled vegetables atop the meat!Be damn sure to order dessert.  I'm a sucker for breakfast foods at all times.  If you're like me, be sure to order the Pain Perdu, which may just be the best French toast you've ever tasted.  The homemade carrot cake, with its citrusy notes, is an honorable mention.Union 50 is a must try for anyone interested in the Indianapolis food scene!"}, {"review_id": "Vanstp3Dt0lvG2LZEiEkuQ", "user_id": "5kL_t1bDR4HLDq_xNo5KZw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/20/2017", "text": "I love this place.
