It fell apart neatly with just a nudge of my fork.  It was served on top of root vegetables (some puréed, some roasted, all delicious) and red cabbage.   Our server Sarah was THE BEST!   When we were finished eating and she asked if we'd like to take the rest home, my boyfriend said we'd might as well  take the last bites of steak for the dog.  Sarah asked if would be okay to send us home with part of a femur bone for him.  So not necessary, but so kind and so lucky for us!   Rocky felt like the World's Most Special Happy Valentine's Boye when we unpacked!This is not enough of a gripe to knock off a star, but in the car after dinner we both agreed that it might be nicer (since the space is beautiful and upscale) if there were more of a dress code.  I'm normally the shallow one, but my boyfriend is of the mind that, for some occasions and venues, we've all got to show some fuckin' respect.  We're not the sort to rag on people's clothes usually, nor are either of us very fancy.  It's just that when you go out for a romantic dinner at an expensive steakhouse, you should be dressed for a romantic dinner at an expensive steakhouse.  A guy in a sweatband and a gal in her best Zumba shirt kind of stick out like a déclassé thumbs.  FFS, the Italian place by my house serves dump trucks of pasta with Prego and still makes men take off their hats."}, {"review_id": "tI2rvobrzorhH3YLp20Ptw", "user_id": "qeQovpQUyCDg1oLp2egJJQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "Omg, please GOD order the soufflé in advance...too f*ckn Good!!

A bold statement for a city that has a lot of steak. Recently went there with a party of 17 and had exceptional service and food in one of the private rooms. They continue to wow us no matter how many times we come here. ALSO had a fantastic dirty martini with stuffed olives. Perfection.previous review 4/1/15If you're loaded, then you should try to eat here as often as possible. If you're mindful of money, then try them on sunday night for their $33 prefix menu that features a salad, small entrée (ex. 8oz fillet) and a desert. It's a ridiculous value to say the least. I chose 801 for my recent birthday dinner and I must say it was a great treat. The dining area has a classic steakhouse appearance that I love in older establishments. It's nice when things don't always change with time, and not all restaurants need to modernize to stay classy and popular. Although yelp boasts a $$$$ for 801, feel free to wear a t-shirt or a hoodie here. While food is expensive here, I did not fetch a snooty vibe in the least. Count on Omaha NE to have a steakhouse that has you pay $100 a person but you can wear a t-shirt. For our visit, my dear friend Matt M. called in ahead of time and told them it was my birthday, so upon arrival I was surprised with a personalized menu and birthday card. They also comp'd my desert with was very nice of them. You can't beat that type of service.I would say my highlights were the ribeye dipped in marrow butter (~$50), the fried lobster tails (~$50), and the oyster rockafeller. The mashed potatoes were also a fantastic side for the steak but I have to say at the end of the meal I was so stuffed I practically needed to be rolled out. Certainly a fine dining experience to be remembered!"}, {"review_id": "jvqHaUcJ_TReiRn-OJnedA", "user_id": "3Br2kVqplyN3jbnqwsR2kQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/12/2017", "text": "Holy cow.I had bought a Groupon for 801 a while back cause I've been meaning to try this place for ages. It lives up to the hype. Even though I was excited to finally eat here, me being me, I ended up snacking shortly before our reservation and went there with an already completely content stomach. So I convinced my friend to split everything and it actually worked out really well with no left overs.We started off with pancetta - wrapped scallops. The scallops were huge and sooooo tender. Best scallops I've ever had, although I didn't really care for the pancetta and I could taste the grill marks on the scallops a little too much. The roasted red pepper glaze was to die for.My friend decided on the 801 cut bone-in prime rib cooked MR and on our server's recommendation we got it prepared with the 801 house spice rub. They were kind enough to slice it up for us since we told them we were sharing. Super juicy and melt in your mouth buttery. Texture was spot on, but I was expecting more flavor from the rub to come through. Slathering on horseradish definitely helped with that.We also got a regular sized side of lobster macaroni and cheese - server said that it would be perfect for sharing, otherwise we could get a half order. This was the flavor bomb I was looking for. Crazy rich, but oh so delicious.. Big pieces of perfectly cooked lobster (Mr. Krabs! Is that your claw in here?). I think I liked this better than the prime rib (always been more of a seafood person than steak - embarrassingly enough, when I crave steak, it's the $10 plate lunch style).After all that, we turned down the dessert menu even though I had really wanted to try to souffle. Surprise!, we didn't reach the $100 value of my Groupon, so our server threw in a chocolate cake to go that tipped us $1 over before tax. (It's like he read my mind, my mind was saying \"NO MORE\" but my tummy was screaming \"CHOCOLATE\").And of course I ended up having a bite of that cake when I got home..or several. Thoughts of the soufflé flew out of my mind. When I took it out of the bag, I was shocked by how heavy it was. Opened it to see a HUGE slab. Would satisfy the most intense chocolate craving..so decadent even without the chocolate sauce and whipped cream that came with it. Service was perfect. Wish I had come with more of an appetite, but I could definitely still appreciate the amazing food here."}, {"review_id": "N2Oh5wNHWSF_PgWu7hbBLQ", "user_id": "dvsMjUdVv-ECaxAzCQ7zxw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2017", "text": "One of the first steakhouses I tried in Omaha. I am not a big steak fan but ended up going here with my colleagues who are steak enthusiasts and loved the place. They have an amazing wine list and they have some good selections. We got a bottle of Chateau Montelena Cabernet and then by the time our entree arrived, we went for a bottle of Girard Cabernet. For appetizers, we got crab cakes and fried calamari. The steak I ordered was perfect, I can't eat super huge portions and I loved my 8 ounce fillet that I could enjoy and finish. There were five of us and all of them loved their steak. I had a creme Brûlée for dessert and it was super rich in flavor but huge in portion which I could not finish. Our server was nice, patient and prompt, he did give good suggestions without influencing one's mind.What are they good for - They have some nice private table arrangements ( small space with curtains that makes it more private) for big groups, Good steak and wine collectionWhat you should expect - Like any other steak house, this place is expensive( I would say $$$$) With drinks, appetizers, entree and dessert, per person you will spend between $100 to $150. But it is quite a dining experience."}, {"review_id": "JA2CUgvAMrap9JVMgxS8cw", "user_id": "zniiAQZJ93T2iy_ySo6_2A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "WAGYU RIBEYE!!!

We all had steaks and soup/salad, shared 3 appetizers, a glass of wine for the 2 adults and sodas for the 3 kids. The bill was about $650. We realized the steaks were about $100 each.
