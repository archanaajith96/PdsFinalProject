The first time I had it, I got the mint mojito, which everyone raves about. I thought it was good, but nothing above par. I wouldn't wait in the ridiculious lines that they have almost every day. Mind you, the line goes out the door. That is on average about 30 minute wait or more. A few years later, my boyfriend get Philz. He really enjoys it. I had a sip of his coffee and I was mind blown by how delicious it is. I told him my coffee never tasted like that. I wasn't sure if the first one I had that left a bad impression on me was water down or not sweet enough or what because his was amazing. Now I'm like addicted to Philz, totally bad for you since it can add up pretty quick. Definitely try their mint mojito. $4.50 for a small and $5.50 for a large. I like my coffee sweet so I get it extra sweet and extra creamy. It's delicious. If you don't have the biggest sweet tooth, I still recommend getting it extra creamy then. It makes a huge difference. Pro tip: download their Caviar app which allows you to order ahead and skip the line. If you order the mint mojito, they make it fresh almost every time. Just walk to the back and give them your name and then they will start working on your order, given after the time you were suppose to arrive on the app."}, {"review_id": "Ro8LnVI5_GNbDXsg9Q00PQ", "user_id": "EF6PWDaLH8hzC5pp9Xk7KA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Came to this Philz coffee for the first time since my sister was touring San Jose state on a Saturday. What a long line! We waited about 45 minutes for our mint mojito, sweet and creamy! It never disappoints me, I feel that I can drink that everyday!I still don't understand Philz coffee's concept of reversing things around, having people order drinks with the barista, then pay, then sit, then wait somewhere, then come back to pick up the drinks from the barista. With so many customers standing around causing traffic, makes the coffee shop kind a messy. But maybe there's some kind of business psych logic that I am not understanding, who knows?Because I love my mint mojito, I would definitely come back!"}, {"review_id": "28mPL7M0yKsDQ0iPe6Hc4w", "user_id": "NW6AYl4OorGViiohOEHmMw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/1/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "TL;DR: The coffee at Philz is good but ridiculously caffeinated.I'm still on-board with my previous 3-star assessment of Philz Coffee in Downtown San José. This location gets absolutely smashed between classes, at lunch... Who am I kidding? It's almost always busy.To cut down on my caffeine consumption, I've changed my order. Now I get half decaf Ethiopian beans and half something else. I waffle between Philtered Soul and another medium-roasted bean. I never get brown sugar, but sometimes I'll get honey. And I always take whole milk or cream.Anyway, getting half decaf only seems to prevent tummy troubles and the jitters. At 2 am, I'm still up writing this review.P.S. I still don't understand the vigorous milk shaking thing. If it's meant to mimic a latte...it doesn't."}, {"review_id": "mEl72FmtyOL6OHFPpyZPpw", "user_id": "OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "While staying in San Jose for the weekend, I wanted to check out some Yelp hot spots near our hotel in downtown. Philz came to the top of the list with 1k+ positive reviews.My friend and I stopped by on a rainy Saturday morning around 10 am. There was line, but it went by pretty quickly, maybe only about a 10-15 mins of waiting. I originally wanted to try the Mint Mojito, but since it was so cold outside I opted for something hot. The barista recommend I try the Philharmonic which ended up being an awesome pick.The only thing I didn't particularly care for about Philz was waiting for my drink to be made, I felt like that was the slowest part and there also was no space for just standing and waiting. I think it'd be better if they built in a small spot for standing while you wait rather than being in the way of the door. The coffee was still top notch though, but that's my only gripe."}, {"review_id": "gUo04dpcDiU9TCm52-A9Mw", "user_id": "HCP1pR_44Pw5_BiWAp47-Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "I had a plan when I dropped off my daughter at preschool - read a few chapters from my book, give attention and affection to my Yelp peeps, write a few reviews... and then I heard from one of the moms, \"Hey wanna grab a cup of coffee?\" I immediately dropped everything and said, \"Sure!\" Never mind the fact that I hate coffee. I was actually curious about this woman. She usually runs off to her errands after she drops off her kid, so I was surprised she had time for coffee. Heck, I was surprised she asked ME. As we were debating where to go, she mentioned how she and her girlfriends like to meet up at  Philz.  And that's when I realized I hardly meet up with a group of girls! Well, except my fambam or coworkers. I usually just have brunch dates with only one peep at a time. Then I realized something else! I've never had a drink at Philz! I don't have to order coffee, surely there's tea! So Philz it is! On my first visit, there were only two other people in line and one other person starting another line by the cash register. We were confused, don't we need to order and pay at the cash register like at Starbucks? Nope! This guy in line (who seemed irritated about our confusion) pointed to the line where you order from the baristas. And then he said to pay at the register. Weird. Just different, I guess. I was really surprised Philz had a lot of tea choices... a lot of interesting tea flavors, I should say. Yerba Mate caught my eye. I was curious what \"earth\" tasted like. Thankfully, it didn't taste like dirt. I don't like minty stuff except toothpaste and gum, but since it had such a little hint of it, I didn't mind at all. The barista quickly figured out I was a Philz noob, but he was patient and very friendly.I returned the second day, and OH DANG, the line was LOOONG. Like out the door long! It reminded me why I have never set foot in this place before. Since I had time on my hands, and I wanted to try a different kind of tea, I stood in line. Plus it gave me time to figure out which tea I wanted to try. After an exhausting argument in my head, I finally settled on Chamomile. I was disappointed with myself thinking it was too safe, I know what Chamomile tastes like! There were other tea flavors that I've never heard of! I should've ordered something else! The banana bread was alright but I thought it was kinda pricey for something so small.I came back for a third visit and ordered Istanbul Treat. I liked this one the best! I could taste the combination of fruity and earthy flavors, but I didn't really taste the spicy flavor as It was described. It went well with the scone I also ordered. For pastries next time, I would go to La Lune Sucree. They have better ones, but I got too lazy to go next door since I already stood in line at Philz. The barista was very concerned when I spilled a little tea on my finger. He had a nice infectious smile and a twinkle in his eye. Whoa. I didn't think I would have a long a** review for Philz! I didn't think there was much to write about my adventures for tea! Thanks to the mom who introduced me to Philz! See?!? This is why I like people sometimes. I learn so many things from what they know! And I think that's why I like just meeting up with one peep at a time for coffee or brunch. If I'm with a group it's hard for me to focus and listen when there's too many people to listen to. I just get lost and daydream."}, {"review_id": "fHAx1VaeISjB4I_kzR3yrA", "user_id": "LkxPeLWMZEiEcIEJ5LtquA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Every coffee made to order,  super friendly staff and food and drinks had good presentation.

I chose the Hazelnut flavored bean, Philtered, medium sweet and creamy. Wow. Rich, sweet, steps above your average coffee. Now would this be my every morning coffee? Probably not. But that's not because it's not delicious. It's because my waistline couldn't handle that much richness every morning. However, I imagine that with less cream and no sugar, I could make it an every day delight. Everyone raves about the coffee, but their employees are a step above as well. I've only been there a couple times so I forgot the process and the amount of choices: what size, what bean, level of sweetness, level of creaminess. And I messed up at every stage. But they were incredibly gracious and patient and kind. Now I was the only one ordering at that time so they had plenty of time to help me out but they could've still been annoyed with my fumbling and they weren't.  That's what I really walked away appreciating while I sipped my incredible coffee. Parking is a drag, so walk if you can. Two large coffees and two cookies put me back $15 ($6 of that was the cookies)."}, {"review_id": "0RqeWUFrcQeTToYY7aDsTQ", "user_id": "5GW6Tj869jrSfHC23wDkOg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Best coffee ever!

Parking in this area has always been notorious so keep an eye on the cops who issue tickets. As for the coffee shop, it's quirky and it's your over priced drip coffee. You line up to order and you choose your blend. If you don't know, just say do and the barista will make a recommendation (Tesora on my case).You also get a take on how sweet you want it and if you want cream or not.The great thing is the coffee is really good and it packs a punch of caffeine boost.

Since it's right bear SJSU and all the offices downtown there is frequently a line out the door and you will have to wait a long time for your drink.

Customer service is always outstanding here. They are very friendly and approachable! After receiving the order, they ask you how your drink is and if you need any adjustments to them..
