Excellent choice for a quick bite or a sit down dinner. Great lunch specials as low as $5. The owner makes flavorful meal for a great price. We had the lunch special steak burrito as well as chicken quesadilla. We also ordered a side of chips salsa and guacamole. The guacamole was out of this world and the salsa was flavorful with a nice bite at the end."}, {"review_id": "Ys7i28Q1Ot8PKUOgwvmefg", "user_id": "0eKp2yyjEBvPeSHzvAkhaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/6/2017", "text": "I didn't think I could find better Mexican food than my favorite place in Enfield CT. But enter Moctezuma's in Springfield, MA and I'm transported to Olvera Street in downtown Los Angeles or any hole in the wall taco stand near the San Diego, CA - Tijuana, Mexico border. Amazing and authentic are the words that come to mind the minute I tasted the traditional carne asada taco. We got a plateful of traditional street tacos that included: al pastor, chorizo and carnitas. There wasn't enough time nor room in our tummies to try everything from their extensive menu, so we ordered to-go quesadillas, arroz con pollo and a plancha pollo dish.We'll be back to dine in again - and willing to drive the few extra miles to Springfield, MA from the Hartford region to eat at Moctezuma's. They have indoor and outside seating, and they appear to do a lot of carry/take-out business. Parking is available on the street - and on the Sunday we came, parking was not an issue. Service is laid-back; we never felt rushed nor ignored either.Moctezuma's is definitely a 5-star food experience!"}, {"review_id": "Akgqh2IJB4ulZk4Fl_xxwA", "user_id": "yslpauqKqTW96BgyBFZhow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Our favorite neighborhood spot! Great tamales, enchiladas, tacos, mole, fajitas, guacamole, soups, churros, and more. BYOB. Prices are more than reasonable. A precious, tiny, cheerful place perfect for a date or a small group (literally only 20 seats in the whole place). Run by a gracious and lovely family. Don't miss this little hidden gem!

I found this place on Yelp and made the drive over. The place is clean and colorful, the staff is nice, and the food is good. I got chips & guac, and a burrito (chicken, I think it was). The burrito was LARGE and very good. The chips & guac also came with salsa-- some of the best salsa I've had in YEARS. The salsa's kick was real. I am a fan.Have you been through this place? No??

I just tried their lunch menu today consisting of 2 soft tacos both chicken and beef- truly good flavor and fresh ingredients and 1 steak burrito which was too plain for my taste but it had salsa /beans and rice on the  side  which was a plus. I saw other customers ' burrito being served- wow  ! Such huge serving. I'll definitely try it next and maybe their fajita burritos.what turned me off was that while I was paying at the register and I am able to catch a glimpse of the food preparers at the back- I saw themeating while preparing the food! Disgusting and unacceptable! Owner and manager please take heed of this.

One thing I miss about California is accessibility of good, authentic Mexican food. I've had trouble finding good Mexican food in Boston. Who would have thought I had to come all the way to Springfield to find good Mexican food?I love the tacos and churros here. It is so good that after I had it the first time, I told my friends to come back with me a couple days later. Also, the food here is such a good price! I usually order the carne asada, al pastor, and pollo tacos. The tacos here are authentic. I like how this place is BYOB too. My friends and I came here on Cinco de Mayo and celebrated here. The service is really good as well. It is a family own joint.

The food is traditional but also caters to those who are more use to the Tex-mex flavors. I love the chicken flautas, and they use \"queso fresco\" which is always nice to see. Tacos are cheap but tasty, stick to the classic beef or chicken. The one thing I didn't love was the apple empanada, its was dry and didn't have enough cinnamon and sugar to give it flavor."}, {"review_id": "XWU5ExqdcAHE9xYpgPJq1A", "user_id": "qKjd8mCiLfVrZCnRH65_9A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2017", "text": "Really good food experience.
