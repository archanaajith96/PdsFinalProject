Short answer is that they are all great. My favorite is the Belgian - the chef makes the waffle batter and the cream himself and they are pretty much what I come back for. The of the warm waffle with the cool cream and fresh fruit makes it my favorite Service: the guy who owns/works there is an awesome guy and takes pride in his work Location: meh worth it"}, {"review_id": "NHHo7qBy2PYHOfjen9N6SA", "user_id": "stpLqxJS3LluyrET3Qfcww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "This probably was the best desert waffle that I've tasted for a while. The waffle was crunchy and the whipCream was not so sweet but perfect. I had the Nutella banana while my daughter had the banana split. They were both tasty. Next time I will have the banana split, the cold ice cream was perfect with the warm waffle. I wishHe would do birthdays. The girls would love him! :) I saw him making each dish. He smiled at every dish / dessert he made. No wonder it tastes delicious each dessert was made from heart! Definitely the place to stop by if you are driving through Tacoma! :) you won't be disappointed!"}, {"review_id": "UMsXHWHhfV5AEUshyGVZNA", "user_id": "yD0ZO4bC3AQZOOyHElynFA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "While the waffle itself (Belgium waffle) SAS good not too soft nor too crunchywhat brought it down for me was the crime topping.

The owner was super nice and was helpful navigating the menu. They have a punch card system that I'll definitely take advantage of! I had the chocolate dipped waffle which was the perfect amount of crunchiness abs sweetness. My husband got the taste of Belgium waffle, which had this cream on it that I kept stealing bites of. He loved it!We got one of each macaron flavor. Our favorite was the mango tamarind macaron, which was pleasantly sour! The other flavors, also delicious, were pumpkin, lime, coconut, rose raspberry, and chocolate pistachio. Yum!!! The historic freight house restaurant area seems like the perfect place to eat lunch; there's so many options! There was free parking in the garage across the street.We're definitely going back!"}, {"review_id": "aMuKGbf06BkgDgJdUsgBHw", "user_id": "GCwO3p3jxnFM5IziZc9y0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Hands down the best macarons here in the Puget Sound! I don't mind the 30min drive just to get some of these delicious goodies. They never disappoint. Unless you show up late and they are all out.

I had the banana split waffle and some macarons. The waffle was a beautiful layered concoction of sliced banana on top of Belgian waffle with fresh strawberries, chocolate sauce and whipped cream. The whipped cream tasted like it was house made and a luxurious rich indulgence to go with the fruit and chocolate sauce. The waffle, however, left something to be desired. While I appreciated the use of pearled Belgian sugar to make the waffle, not all of the sugar pearls were integrated within it fully when cooked so when I bit into it I would get hard chunks of raw granular sugar. Not good eats. I did enjoy the macarons though which had a good balance of crisp outer layer with chewy center. The flavors I had were good (Cassis, rose raspberry and coffee)."}, {"review_id": "h4LC7aPVAi9YH0PIboE2qQ", "user_id": "jdMF9l55vbCEFXMAeg73Wg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "We had the banana split waffle and a few macarons.

We came on a day that the waffle maker was broken. :( the gentleman working there was super nice about it and apologetic tho. So unfortunately this review is only based on their macarons. Macarons here are a lot bigger than the usual macarons I'm used to and were filled with a lot of filling. They are almost double the normal size. I got one of each flavor available because I was feeling spontaneous. Flavors consisted of bubble gum, blueberry cheesecake, almond, tajin mango, coffee, and lemon. Most of the flavors were all good but unfortunately these delicate cookies were hollow. I also found that the filling for each cookie had too much of a buttery taste and texture to the point it was overpowering. The coffee flavor would have been great but the cookie was undercooked. The tajin mango cookie was the only one that has the perfect chewy texture and wasn't hollow but had an acquired taste. I probably wouldn't come back for the macarons but I would love to try the waffles!"}, {"review_id": "x3jKoqnWr9ryohtQ8oaRKQ", "user_id": "k2aw5jQtDvPD6tAmvp6npg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/7/2017", "text": "La Waffletz is incredible, it is in the eclectic freighthouse square. We went to grab a dozen macaroons and couldn't resist getting a waffle for a late afternoon snack. Macaroons are amazing, they have a lot of different flavors and all tasted great. We got a peanut butter, banana, and caramel waffle and it was insane. The best home made whip cream I've ever had topped a delicious waffle with melting peanut butter and a clean caramel sauce. The owner was incredibly nice and deserves to have his business explode. It isn't often that we are talking about a restaurant for hours after we eat but that was the case. Would love to see a better location, maybe on Reston point, those Macaroons in some designer boxes would be a hit."}, {"review_id": "4mpBJBxZoslOo3g8Hh-05Q", "user_id": "pOp91GGMh6GKSGWU_2Tmng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "SOOOOOOO Amazing!

The ones I had gotten at other places in the past were pedestrian and I did not see the thrill of them. That was until I had a couple at La Waffletz. These are SUPERB! Now I see the light.These are light, fluffy, fantastic balance of flavors and not too sweet. Geez, what was I eating before?!!!The chef is very welcoming and engaging AND he is from France. No better than that. La Waffeletz is in Tacoma's Dome District in historic Freighthouse Square; which is in badly need of an update and hopefully the people in charge will showcase all this has to offer. It could be really fantastic; a South Sound Pike Place Market vibe. Back to the treats. I look forward to getting back in there to explore more flavors and appreciating what a quality macaron is.

Not a fan of the black licorice, or the currant, but at least i can say i tried it haha.  Will definitely come back and earlier to try the other flavors and the waffles!
