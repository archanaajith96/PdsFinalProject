We ordered at the counter, waited briefly for a table, and within a heartbeat our food arrived. While a while back and the details have become hazy in my mind, we loved the food. It was fresh and hot, colorful and flavorful. We just loved the place. The customers, the staff, and the down-to-earth, sincere, energetic owner all together signaled to us that this is an unusually good establishment. We had a chance to speak to the owner and urged him to open a branch near us in Scottsdale! That's how much we liked it!"}, {"review_id": "9ISvySZP7bpZOjqxMv5Llg", "user_id": "5kSvUN2bVshdHJmU8UZPaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "I'll start by saying, order the Greek fries!

I ordered Greek fries which were amazing with the flavor and feta. The entree's are pretty big so watch out for sizes.

By far in my top three Mediterranean places in Phoenix. Tucked in a strip mall, Green Corner provides a variety of menu items and both indoor and outdoor patio seating. Ample private lot parking. If you order the chicken kabobs you'll be forewarned of the 15-20 min wait, but we asked for the sides to come early and they did. Tried the chicken kabob and gyro plate, both delicious and large food portions. They also gave us complementary baklava which was very good! Highly recommend, and yes, make the drive here to try it out if you don't live within the vicinity. Hopefully the area will turn around and repopulate to support this restaurant.

As soon as you walk in, everyone greets you with a smile, and when you leave, it's the same warm customer service. The food portions are hearty and the food tastes great. My daughter and I had lunch-me the chicken with Greek salad and she had a gyro plate. Had plenty of leftovers and it hit the spot. The prices are affordable too, so order everything on the menu if you're starving! I like that you can customize your plate and substitute things for healthier (or not) options. Fresh baklava for dessert perfectly tops off any meal, so sweet and flaky. Very casual dining setting--its kind of set up similar to a Subway restaurant--a few booths, couple of tables, main place to order, and a drink station. While I would've come back here just for the food (yes, it's very good!)  the real kicker is the hospitality and kind attitude that pretty much everyone who works here shows to its customers. So many places have drones and zombies working for them, but Green Corner Restaurant is a breath of fresh air!"}, {"review_id": "vXuz2lCDY12xec2yUC7AjQ", "user_id": "o1p-GRYW_jyOcapT6qlVVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "The absolute best Mediterranean Cafe I've ever eaten at!  The fattosh Salad was huge and delicious!  I had the combo kabobs and the flavor from the chicken and lamb was surreal!  Mesa has a huge winner here...which is obvious by the 438 5 star reviews!  About to be 439!I'll be back in 2 weeks!"}, {"review_id": "rtnlFgWFh_L2edwMywNc4A", "user_id": "nz6zUAmVvNS4Sda5inLPzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Love this place!

I was looking for a healthy dinner in an unfamiliar suburb and found this Mediterranean fast-food spot on my Yelp app. Little did I realize this was #85 on Yelp's just-published Top 100 Places to Eat in the entire country (link: bit.ly/2sN4Qsa). It was an admittedly quirky list of non-Michelin-starred eateries, but I can see why Green Corner would have a devoted following. It holds a dominant position in - surprise! - a small shopping center with a huge parking lot (photo: bit.ly/2EJqWNK). It was a compact spot and fairly busy with families having taken over the booths.I read that their spit-roasted meat was made in-house and tasted amazing, but I attempted to stay healthy and went with the $8.99 Vegetarian Plate which featured three good-size falafel balls nicely crisped, a very fresh hummus, baba ghannoug, tabouleh salad, a pair of dolmas, and tahini sauce with a lot of pita wedges in a separate basket (photo: bit.ly/2ony6RN). If I was feeling more calorifically inclined, I would have gone for the &13.49 Green Corner Combo Plate which offered chicken, beef, and lamb kafta kabobs plus a falafel ball. However, I was happy with my sensible choice, and the staff was kind enough to serve me a complimentary slice of their Baklava (photo: bit.ly/2CCtOKq). How could I resist that?FOOD - 4 stars...real home-style Mediterranean that tastes fresh and flavorfulAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...just a fast-food space but well maintainedSERVICE - 4.5 stars...stellar...and they give away baklavaTOTAL  - 4 stars...is it the 85th best place to eat in the country?...who am I to argue with my Yelp brethren?"}, {"review_id": "8YADsorb6AplYi4y8ODGfw", "user_id": "8gfLGbW3HuQ4UAFTUOhA0w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "The workers here are the best!

They forgot to give me to Taziki's sauce, but I went back to ask for it, which is crucial and what I like as well.The gyro was really good, juicy, moist, just overall good. Combined with the hummus and the tzatziki sauce, it was wonderful. Rice in the salad were both decent and works well with everything else.Pricing was pretty good and I would say cheaper than other Greek places, was around $9 for a plate.Came here after they open and it was already starting to get busy. But their service is pretty quick and they get the order out pretty fast as well. Although it was getting busy, there was always tables open and people were coming in and out. They also have an outdoor patio seating as well for good weather.Parking is nice as they have a big parking lot. Inside is pretty clean as well.So much other stuff to try out. Will need to come back in the future.The free baklava at the end was also pretty good. Finish the whole thing.PS. A ton of quantity, could not finish the entire plate, ate a second meal out of it.

I'm always impressed with good falafel; it needs to be perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside; Green does a great job with this. We went during the dinner rush but service was still excellent, the food came out quickly, and the line for the register moved briskly. It's located at the edge of a large shopping center so there's plenty of parking. It's starting to get hot out, but there's a outdoor patio if you want fresh air to accompany your meal.
