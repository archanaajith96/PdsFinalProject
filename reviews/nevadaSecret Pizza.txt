These guys could throw down with any NY pizza joint in NY, so dropping them in Las Vegas is like winning a gold in the special olympics & not being handicapped - there's no contest. This place is the best pizza in Las Vegas, period. It's a tiny hole, with a few stools & counters, but you're standing or you're taking it to go. But it by the slice or plan on waiting if you need a whole pie ordered because they make it from scratch when you do. (Yes, if you're wondering, absolutely worth the wait.) A \"must stop\" for me every time I'm in Vegas. Relatively inexpensive (not cheap; they have to run a profitable business 18 hours a day, 7 day's a week) but certainly reasonable compared to most of the purchases you make on The Strip ($4.99 for a bottle of water, anyone?)"}, {"review_id": "4ak7B95laita6Gx-AN-qWQ", "user_id": "qsCwd_5B2vVk-lLmijGt4w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Secret Pizza is our go to meal after day clubbing.

We ended up in the Cosmopolitan more than once because...well, it's beautiful, majestic, and mostly pink!  Secret Pizza is a genius hole-in-the-wall covert pizza joint on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. I give it five stars for the sole fact that it is more hidden than most \"speakeasies\" I've encountered in recent history. OH and the pizza is delicious.You can't really miss the hallway entryway, located directly to the right of the hostess-stand of a restaurant that has a name which I cannot recall. Anywho, a somewhat discreet hallway adorned with historic record covers leads you directly to Secret Pizza. There you will find several ready-made pies, ready for reheat and consumption. If the reheat aspect doesn't sound appetizing, just try it - I am a weirdo about leftovers but I am also a realist and do not expect them to bake an entire cheese pie just so that I can enjoy one slice of it.Seating inside Secret Pizza is somewhat limited, but there are plenty of seating areas just outside of the hallway, where you can relax and devour your pizza with no shame (seriously - everyone is eating their pizza out there)."}, {"review_id": "sHX7I94B-x0adK71cKOKZw", "user_id": "gTa6OqndLhLs9xDxv-wP_Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "In short: wouldn't come backFull review: I saw this in a few shows or on social media so it was on our list of things to do.

Slices were a decent size for the prize, I just felt they lacked flavor. I like the idea of it being \"secret\" and the place is a cool little spot, but I wouldn't come back.

I first found this spot years ago while staying at the Cosmopolitan. On one of the drunken nights I was stumbling around, my friends and I accidentally found this place. If we didn't see people walking in the hallway, we would have totally missed it. All I remember the next morning was the pizza burned the roof of my mouth but it was good. Heck, the pizza box was empty on the floor of my suite so that was a good thing right? The next time I was back in Vegas, I was craving pizza and wanted to go back. Unfortunately I didn't know the name or even remembered where the restaurant was located. All I knew was it was in the Cosmopolitan. Sad how I could find this gem drunk but had a hard time locating it sober. Go figure the name of the place is Secret Pizza and there isn't a sign for the place. Now I know it's on the 3rd floor straight off the escalator. They have New York style pizza here and you can either by them by the slice or as a whole pie. If you don't see the slice you want on display, just ask because they have more pizzas below the display area. The slices are reheated so it's nice and hot. I really like the crust here. They also sell beer here and it does compliment the pizza well. Just keep in mind they don't have much counter seating and this place is busy. Hmmm I'm craving pizza now..."}, {"review_id": "b3JXacI9npmH2ysx5agrTQ", "user_id": "Epa7kJ1-1i_YLPeVUr6ANA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Always our go to whenever we're in town.

The place was actually pretty easy to find, with a name like 'secret pizza' I was expecting something more mysterious.. like a store that had a back door into the pizza place or something lol idk!! It was pretty crowded in there which sucked cus it's such a small place, probably like a good 15-20 people. We waited about 5 minutes to order and I wasn't too sure of how to order exactly so I just pointed at the one I wanted. I got a slice with pepperoni, sausage and jalepenos. It came out to $6.50 for a slice of pizza, plus they ask if you want to tip at the register so it just makes you feel obligated to. The price was preeeetty steep in my opinion. It was good though, I liked how good quality the sausage was. They also have red pepper flakes, parmesean and garlic powder in shakers on the little counter available.Overall, I wasn't too impressed. The pizza was good but idk if it was $6.50 + tip good lol. The place is super tiny too, like I mentioned, so there's barely any seating area. I think it's a cool place to say that you've been to, but not really worth going to a second time. There's plenty of other cool places in Vegas to visit."}, {"review_id": "DJOYs9C4mIWvOApU3XP6-w", "user_id": "DySPguYeg2kLIkyy6emw9g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Based on previous reviews, we had to try out this hidden gem.

Otherwise, Secret Pizza deserves more of a 3-star rating. The concept of Secret Pizza is cute. You have to \"find\" your way to it, since there isn't a sign and it's not on Cosmopolitan's hotel directory map. It took us less than 5 minutes to find, though, so it's not some big secret. Simply go up to the third floor, find Blue Ribbon, and walk down the hallway located to the left of the restaurant. The hallway is covered in album covers. The eatery itself is tiny. Most patrons don't bother to throw away their own plates, so the two short counters are cluttered with condiment remnants and crumbs. You order at the register and wait for your food to come out. Since it's usually made to order, it can take a while. If there's an already-made pie available, you can just purchase slices. Prices are considerably high, especially considering the quality. Pizza slices are saturated in so much grease, you'd have to be crazy not to blot your plate with multiple napkins. Each slice literally comes with a pool of grease on the pizza and on the paper plate. We got two slices of cheese mushroom pizza for $11 -- so overpriced. A whole pie is about $30. But Secret Pizza does its job -- feeding hungry bar- and club-goers who want a quick bite after downing too much alcohol. All that grease suddenly comes in handy when you need something to fill your belly besides alcohol. Would I eat here on a regular night as an actual meal? No chance. But would I eat here at 2am when I just need something quick and easy? I did, and it was quite tasty."}, {"review_id": "BC5n9qbCl_FTEyZkVwzNeA", "user_id": "zxbFQcvEDKyW0GYt2J1P3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Finding this place is tricky, hence the \"secret\" in Secret Pizza. It's down a long corridor that has photos of different people (actors, musicians, etc) which is pretty cool! It's a small area so really just get your pizza and go!The first time I had Secret Pizza was coming out of Marquee Nightclub, drunk. Usually at that time, there's a longggg line of drunk people. The pizza here is sooo good though, you really don't mind the wait.They have several toppings ready. You tell them which one you want and they heat it up. The pizza is thin crust and heated to perfection.Now this is not just a place to go when you're drunk. Went around 12pm just a little after they opened and was still super good! They also have ample amounts of seasonings to sprinkle on your pizza - cheese, red chili flakes, oregano, and GARLIC!

Line was to the entrance, but everyone sais it was worth the wait. First of all, it was five in our group, so we want 2 pizzas. The pizza guys were super nice and laid back...the busyness didn't seem to phase them...menu is super simple. We ordered one white and one pepperoni. Those pizzas were humongous!!! 10 slices in each, we were in over our head!! But they were very delicious, worth the wait!!!

Because nothing in Vegas is really a secret and everyone in Vegas is friendly, just ask someone if you can't find it and they will draw you a map, talk you through it carefully, ask you about what else you're doing on your trip, and then walk you personally to the hallway. They have some pinball and a small counter to order along with some additional counter space hugging the walls to eat. All of the pizza options are delicious. There are also some alcohol options, which taste as expected, but the pizza--the pizza is delicious. My favorite was the white pizza, which I didn't originally order but I overheard a private tour guide talking to a small family about how the specialty is the white pizza, so obviously I had to grab a slice. Dressed in garlic and oil, it was definitely the winner of an already victorious meal."}, {"review_id": "Nc9WIdYCPxtUS7aIc-bjLw", "user_id": "3RTesI_MAwct13LWm4rhLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "This secret pizza joint is not a secret anymore for those later nighters!

Pizzas can be ordered by the slice or by the whole. We grabbed two slices of the supreme pizzas. The supreme pizza was delicious, packed with flavor and had a nice crunchy crust to it. Note: pizza slices run about $6 each They have a few arcade games to keep one busy as well but I was too occupied with my pizza to even care!
