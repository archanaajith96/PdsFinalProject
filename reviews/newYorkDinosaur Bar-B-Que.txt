The atmosphere is awesome, the food is incredible, and the prices are pretty reasonable for what you get. As many people have mentioned, there is always a pretty hefty wait, especially on Friday & Saturday nights. We generally try to stick to lunch, which has a very reasonable wait. They have also started taking some reservations, which is a really nice feature. The reservations are limited, as they generally leave a good portion of their seating for walk-ins, but the option is there and I highly recommend using it.The bar area is also really good and they generally carry a pretty large selection of local wine & beer. So many restaurants in the area do not carry local products, so it is really nice to see a place that is proud of the local area they work in. Parking is probably the biggest downside of Dinosaur, as there is no private lot at the restaurant. If you are lucky, you can get some street parking, but most of the time you are parking in one of the local garages or parking lots that requirement payment. It's not a bad walk in the summer, but can get pretty chilly in the winter! I cannot recommend Dinosaur enough!"}, {"review_id": "detShQGk7HZpjRbEmf-Hug", "user_id": "SzW4XdWJaEldL87fZSnFKQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "I was staying at a hotel at Rochester Airport.

The location is centrally locates in the heart of downtown and with the right seating customers can enjoy a great view of the Genesse River. The food never disappoints. Some personal favorites - meat: the Brisket (delicious and always tender) and for an appetizer: the Shrimp - this item (although I know it's a Bar-B-Que joint) is my absolute favorite item on the menu. The shrimp is boiled in an Old Bay type seasoning and is spot on with seasonings. I've gotten the shrimp several times and it never disappoints. Parking can be a challenge and even though the restaurant is large in size there will most likely be a wait to be seating- but it will be worth it.

Like your dad's new \"girlfriend of the week\" trying to win you over with ice cream or a Gameboy Color even though you know she won't be around long. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, the service was good... it had all the amenities you come to expect from your \"local BBQ joint that tries to be humble but continues to expand into a chain-like space\" but it's just missing something. Maybe it's time... maybe it will grow on me. After all, you know what they say... the best BBQ places have sticky floors (note: no one says that). I had Loaded Pulled Pork fries and a side of mac.

Off I went. I should note that I know approximately one thing about barbecue: it's tasty. Clearly, I am not an expert, so I can't tell you in what style this was or anything. I can tell you it was tasty.There's a lot of construction happening in the area right now, and man, y'all's roads are way confusing. Do you know that? Anyway, I finally got here and discovered that street parking was freeeeee after 6 PM so I got a sweet spot across the street. They have a lot, but it looks tiny tiny, so street seems like the best option for parking.I got a seat at the bar and quickly discovered that I was one of many, many folks traveling for work that night. Indeed, the bartender commented that there's usually more out-of-towners than locals, at least at the bar. Their reputation precedes them, clearly! That and I'm sure many co-workers recommend it.I was still kinda full from lunch, so I knew I couldn't handle a big ol' plate of any sort. Everyone around me got a plate and I was so jealous, but also glad I didn't order it because holy lots of food. Instead, I went with the chopped melt and had collard greens as my side. That sandwich was GOOD. Oh man, so good. I enjoyed every single bite of that sandwich. The collard greens had a little kick and, surprise!, there was more meat buried beneath the top layer of greens. Right on!I was full, but egged on by one of my travelin'-for-work cohorts at the bar, I still ordered the s'mores cheesecake for dessert like a dummy. One, that was one tasty cheesecake that did taste a lot like a s'mores. The toasted marshmallows really made it. Two, food coma for daaaaaaaaaaaays.I did try one of their cocktails and it was good, but nothing to write home about. I switched to the local 1911 hard cider, which I consistently drank throughout this trip. (Can I buy that online and have it shipped to me? I really liked it!)Yeah, you should probably stop in here if you're traveling.

We showed up around 6:30pm on a Friday and were greeted by warm smiles and a 45 minute wait. We thought about searching for other (faster) local options, but quickly came to the decision that all of the recommendations couldn't be wrong, so we stayed. I started with a smooth, refreshingly flavorful local brew, the Oktoberfest beer from Three Heads. We ordered catfish strips & deviled eggs to get  started and let's just say the catfish needed more seasoning, but the eggs were AMAZING.For the main course, I grabbed to mixed platter that included ribs, wings, mac & cheese and bbq baked beans. Though I wasn't a huge fan of the beans, the mac was delicious and had a crispier baked \"crust\" on the top that provided a mix of delightful textures. My ribs fell off the bones and these might be the best grilled wings I've ever had."}, {"review_id": "R8bax6-65uubZDoAHog5lg", "user_id": "MNR3PupMJNisug3iKoGK1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/15/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "My son just started walking to Dinosaur  BBQ it is that good  this was after his last show at the local Geva theater \"The Other Josh Cohen\" this time I got the Pulled Pork Sandwich + mac n cheese..kids ordered the rack of Ribs + shrimp which are the kind of melt in your mouth while making the \"ummm\" sounds and you got BBQ all over your mouth it's that good we also ordered the bourbon chocolate pecan pie so I highly recommend + 5 Stars for Dinosaurs BBQ..."}, {"review_id": "Es2hKzKdQ3myi4W-CWDpPQ", "user_id": "jrvTYh6NKG-Hd0t-N2Kt8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/11/2018", "text": "Best...

It is our go-to place for BBQ and live music. Everything about the experience is solid: Food is good, there is a nice variety of plates, combo platters, sides and desserts, and the service is better than you would expect considering this place is always busy and is so large.Our most recent visit was the week before Xmas. We went with relatives who were from out of town and had never been. There were 6 of us. I was able to make a reservation in advance, and that helped a lot; if you don't have enough people for a reservation, I recommend you go at least 30-45 min early to sit at the bar and wait while they find you a table. This is probably more of a summer-time consideration than winter time, but seriously, in all the times we've been there, in all the seasons, it is always packed. We love the beef brisket, their fries, their collard greens and their wings. All of the sauces are tasty. Serving sizes are generous. My husband and I usually split a platter with brisket, pulled pork and ribs, which comes with 2 sides, plus we get wings and another side. It is more than enough food! We have never gotten a salad there funny enough, but during our last visit relatives got salads and they looked great - big, fresh, full of veggies. More like entree salads (without meat) than side salads. I also highly recommend getting dessert. They usually have 4 or 5 pies, plus ice cream and a relatively new addition to the menu is their flour-less chocolate 'cake' - like a dense fudgy torte - really good. Couple other notes: parking is on the street or in the Court Street parking garage. Getting into and out of the building could be a bit tricky for someone needing special accommodation, but the people working there are very friendly and helpful, so they can assist you. Tables are outfitted with extra BBQ sauces, plenty of extra napkins, and wet-naps for the after-math. You may need to ask for water if you want it in addition to your beverage.
