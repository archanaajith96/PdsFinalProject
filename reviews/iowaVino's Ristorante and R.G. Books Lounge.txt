We enjoy the dim light, the romantic atmosphere. About a year ago all of that changed once we had our first child. I can't recall the last time we'd had a romantic time out to ourselves!Fast forward, and now our child is 11mos. old and our in-laws are visiting for the weekend. They arrive at our home, and they promptly tell us - \"Go leave the house. We've got this!\"My wife and I stared at one another and blinked like deer in a set of headlights. We thought of a few places around town we had always talked about trying, but nothing seemed to fit the mood we were going for. We talked about Vino's - but we weren't really dressed for a proper fancy dinner. I suggested the attached lounge R.G. Books - and boy was it a home run. Things are a little tight in the lounge, but it's lined with two sitting areas of couches, a full bar, tables and booth seating against the walls, and books - LOTS of books. We both sat and had the most peaceful glasses of whiskey we'd had in a long time. The atmosphere was appropriate; the lighting the same. Check it out if you ever need a place to sit and think, or if you're trying to find a quiet intimate place to sit and talk with someone."}, {"review_id": "P8b-FcMSEbvw4oTe6p6nsg", "user_id": "R34onMcCtJS5yIQUKgiq6Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Average food.

The Bruschetta and Artichoke dip with bread slices are both nummy.I have been here two time over several years and never really have had time for dinner next door at Vinos-my daughter got the pasta with pesto and nice large shrimp to go and she said it was awesome.  The place is a bit on the moldy side and could use some new carpet, otherwise..please don't change a thing- it is just perfect.Thank you."}, {"review_id": "X0jsm76z-ELh8yyNZSPTDg", "user_id": "qwYq-gXP0-OCypjZgZP_UA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "We have been going here for 5 years I can't believe I hadn't reviewed yet. I don't have pics because it's a nice place and I don't tend to whip out my phone in nicer restaurants. This is probably one of the most romantic and old school authentic Italian places I have been, it's an anniversary and Valentine's Day favorite for us. The service is always impeccable and the food is amazing. I love how dark it is inside. The cute bookstore bar attached is fun and unique too. The garlic bread and salad are really good. We love the lasagna the most but we have tried almost all of their pastas and have never been let down. The spicy one and the ravioli are other favorites as well. The only thing that I didn't love was their interpretation of spinach and artichoke dip, it was way too cheesy and not enough flavor, but with the salad and bread you don't even need to order that."}, {"review_id": "iHlbTqoDqQUW4I6_n_dhxA", "user_id": "BePb9xGBxHZNCVZlKXi3VA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/6/2017", "text": "Found this place on yelp while traveling for business and I was very pleased!

The menu is small, but packed with excellent food. The dinner started off not very well because the waiter was having a bad evening and we wanted to get a bottle of wine. The wine list is extensive and we described what we were looking for, but he didn't seam familiar with the list and became annoyed. We wanted a red, but he steered us to a white wine that nobody liked. Thanks to Google we tried \"La Valentina Montepulciano D' Abruzzo from Italy. The wine was excellent and we wound up getting two bottles. I would recommend the Artichoke and Spinach Dip for an appetizer. The bread pieces were perfect with the dip and it had excellent flavor. I would definitely get it again. I decided to try the \"Italian Sausage Diavo\" with only the spicy sausage. They are not kidding when they say it's spicy so make sure you have a full glass of water. It was excellent, the sausage was perfect and it was an excellent dish. It definitely gets hotter as you eat more. The portions are perfect and I had to take some with me. I almost forgot the salad, which was also fantastic. I loved the Italian dressing. Everything was fresh and crisp. This place has a very romantic atmosphere and next door part of the restaurant has a bar, book cases with seating to hang out and enjoy some more wine. The waiter became more friendly has the evening progressed. Everyone has a bad day and it was a Friday night, place was packed, so I am sure he was stressed, he probably should sample some red wine to relax more. I would definitely come back if in the area, this place is fantastic."}, {"review_id": "g7bOEg2IcQWoldisjMPI7w", "user_id": "YMoexcMLepDdKDhBcUDOYw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2017", "text": "First time was last night, if I could give ten stars I would.

Vino's offers a pleasant, mellow atmosphere, the servers have over 30 years of experience in that restaurant, which sends a really good message about the management.  The servers are knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list, and give good recommendations about what to order. We have ordered almost every thing on the menu at one time or another, and there is nothing we don't like.
