If you're looking for robust and full-bodied comforting flavors with original pairings at a budget-friendly rate: this is a fantastic choice. I'm in love with this location and their menu and I've barely made a ding in their menu!As an undying sweets foodie, I tried two of their desserts first: the tepary bean spiced custard pie with cornmeal crust and a hibiscus whip, and a salted bourbon caramel chocolate chip pecan pie slice. ...there's a reason why I don't have photos. I went in for a sample and couldn't stop! I ate both slices in the time it takes to breathe two breaths and they were stunningly good!! The salted caramel chocolate chip pecan pie was really the standout if you like thick, decadent, heavy flavors (so for many, consider sharing with a loved one!)The tepary bean spiced custard pie reminded me a lot of a version of pumpkin pie with both texture and flavor...which has everything to do with the \"spiced\" component of the pie. There was also included a hibiscus whip which actually separated and added a sweet essence that enhanced the flavor and separated the textures of the slice. Definitely something unique and try-worthy, but maybe not a repeat buy (it isn't for me).Cons: parking is difficult and all street oriented, and the hours...this is definitely not a location good for pick-up around end-of-work day, it's a commitment to an evening at the restaurant type of place. Heads up of menu changes: sometimes they are last minute (via Instagram posting) and shortly lived (don't always plan on offerings being available multiple days in a row)...for someone driving from Peoria, I appreciate a greater heads up so I can adjust my schedule to drive down for the exciting eats...Will I be back? Very likely and next time I'm hoping to dig into some savory plates!

Service was great, the guy at the window introduced himself, welcomed us and then made some great recommendations both on and off the menu.Food came out quickly and was delicious! -PB&B Burger Med-rare was fantastic (tip: you can upgrade the side to poutine for $3(off menu)) -Big Jim was Very Good, gravy was great but the biscuit was a little dry. Still very good though.-Poutine was fantastic!! Hands down Fantastic!!-Mac & Cheese side was good, but I feel like it really could have been better. It was a very classic dish and didn't have the flair of the rest of their menu.-Ginger Beer is homemade and is VERY GOOD, strong, tart, good.A few reasons for the missing star: 1 the chairs, I had to swap out a broken chair and then sat in another one that had a bent leg that almost broke before I traded it in too. 2 the dry biscuit on the Big Jim."}, {"review_id": "mwJqER5nKIVgjvdfGxjIcA", "user_id": "KDwy0hhTPHOtE8qmb46A0w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We had burgers, fries, and a salad and everything was perfect and delicious. This is a thick burger with fresh toppings. Really yummy fresh salad with an amazing cheese on top -feta? Better than any feta I've ever had. But the real show-stopper for us was the fries. Very likely the best french fries we've ever had. They're not fancy, not dressed up, just perfection. The service was also fantastic. This is an order at the window mostly outdoor diner, but there was a guy who kept coming out and checking with each table, so it felt like sit-down service. We loved the friendly, casual vibe. Made for a very relaxing evening. I'll go out of my way to go back again. *My only wish is that they'd serve milk shakes. :)Update 3/18- We've been back a few times and every time has been fantastic. This last time we tried the mac & cheese and now understand what everyone raves about! Yum! My husband says it's the best he's ever had, but that's the way with everything here.. best burgers, best fries, best service. I have no debate on this anymore, this is the best burger in the valley. Crazy good. And when's the last time you went to a order at the counter place where they introduced themselves, the cook, and assured you they'd be taking care of anything you need? And they do!

They have a small indoor seating which is within a small trailer so preferably sit outside. The popular menu item here is called the big Jim and it's definitely worth it. A fried chicken breast sandwiches between two big biscuits with bacon and cheese. Then it's smothered with gravy that's oh so good. I also recommend getting some French fries, Mac and cheese and maybe even a drink. Great thing also about this place is that it opens late!

The Champion is just that, super juicy & flavorful & cooked to perfection. This is my pick for the BEST BURGER IN PHOENIX HANDS DOWN.This is where you go when you actually appreciate a good burger, and by good burger I mean; medium rare, savory, and not overloaded with toppings like hopdoddy & zinburger... the focus is on the meat & that my friends is how a good burger turns into a great burger.

My friend took us here for a late dinner when I was visiting and I'm glad he did. The cashier was really nice and helpful especially when I asked what she recommended for food/to drink.I ended up ordering a beer with the Carol which was a biscuit sandwich with pulled pork. It was a really big portion (ended up taking half home). The biscuit was nice and fluffy - a little too thick for me personally. The coleslaw was surprisingly good (I normally don't like it but found myself liking this one).

I particularly love that they offer veggie-friendly options.. their bbq jackfruit burgers and fries are amazing!! It can be hard to find restaurants that accommodate vegetarians, which makes this place even more special.Just a heads up tho, the majority of seating here is outdoors. Aka. be prepared during the winter months for the cold/ during the summer months for the heat.. I think there are like 5 seats inside near the kitchen, but otherwise everything else is picnic benches or tables :) I'll definitely be back here once it's a little warmer again outside!"}, {"review_id": "ROe6miTHcbMHsD3cYcdSWQ", "user_id": "c0b1L08k1mtRANI36UMJ2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Order one of everything, I insist.

The long lines look intimidating and the food appears to be incredibly heavy on the stomach. Plus, I'm not one to sit outside and uncomfortably dine in the blistering Phoenix heat. However, since things have cooled down a bit, I finally decided that the time was right to finally see what all of the fuss is about.Welcome operates out of a legitimate Valentine-model diner box/cart/building, or whatever the hell you want to call it. There's minimal seating inside, so unless you're very lucky or rock a lethal man-bun/man-beard combo, expect to eat on their outdoor patio. Going in on a Saturday night, I was warned by a colleague to not fret about the long line. It's strange, because after two visits, it always takes me a minute to place my order, but it seems to take everyone else significantly longer for some reason.So, let's talk about the food. In many ways, Welcome Diner reminds me a lot of Matt's Big Breakfast in terms of how they execute. It's menu is fairly simple, with a few dashes of flare added here and there, but not to the point where they're overcompensating for shortcomings. During our first visit, I opted for a grilled cheese with a side of mac and cheese (yes, I like cheese). My girlfriend ordered The Champion burger with a side of fries.Okay, so I'll gladly admit that my grilled cheese was excellent. It consists of three cheeses, including cheddar, muenster, and smoked gouda. There's also some tomato confit thrown in. The sandwich is already served on my preferred style (sourdough).  As my girlfriend consistently points out, I'm easily seduced by smokiness, and the subtle smokiness found within the gouda was enough to win me over bigtime. In fact, I'd say it's probably the best grilled cheese I've ever tried, putting all other places to complete shame. And yet, they make it look all so easy!The side and mac and cheese was also great quality, which was enhanced even further by the blowtorched crust that really adds a worthy, but subtle touch. Yes, you can add other items to the mac, although I feel it stands on its own just fine.When they finally brought out my girlfriend's burger. I took a few bites and was impressed with its quality, although I would have personally went with something a bit more intense, such as the No Way Jose variation. Although she wasn't quite as enthusiastic as I was about my grilled cheese, she felt it was comparable to some of the better places in Phoenix. Fries are fine, while their poutine variation with gravy and cheese takes things up a notch.During a return visit, I tried their Big Jim, which is a biscuit sandwich that includes a fried chicken filet, bacon, cheese, and is drenched in white gravy. The chicken and biscuit were both very impressive. The chicken, in particular, is good enough that it can easily stand on its own, which is why I intend to order a more basic biscuit sandwich when we eventually return.For dessert, we ordered the same thing most people order in the beignets, which were also great quality. On a return visit, they had a buttermilk pie on special, which was just okay. The homemade pineapple-orange jam, however, was absolutely superb!After dining here, I can immediately see why the place is popular with the locals. Yes, as pretty much everyone states in their review, Welcome is very heavy on the hipster patrons to the point where the clichés are almost comical. But they're harmless and when the food is this good, who really cares?What they do here, they do extremely well - and for that, I give them a massive amount of credit.Highest recommendation!"}, {"review_id": "iO_X9mGHU_njflp2a3GdAQ", "user_id": "Z_PFVN3z3RpEAMwe94cqVQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Perfect weather this time of year to enjoy this unique little outdoor diner.

Open super late and some amazing unique options. I think it's cool how they have mostly outdoor seating, makes this place unique. There were a few vegetarian options which looked amazing but I went for the jackfruit sandwich, my boyfriend and I also shared Mac n cheese. My boyfriend got a biscuit with fried chicken and he thought it was awesome! My sandwich was incredible, a crunchy baguette with perfectly spiced jackfruit! I had grabbed ketchup just in case but didn't even need it. My boyfriend didn't like the charred top of the mac n cheese but I thought it was good. He did like the underneath part of it. We also tried the home-brewed ginger beer and it was tasty! The ginger was extremely strong but very good. Took a while to get our food but this was a fun place to just hang out so it was not a problem.

No frills and kind of odd is the way I would describe this place. I got the Big Jim and it was legit. Pair that with my favorite beer from the brewery I used to live next to in Tucson (Dragoon)? Win win and win. Anyway back to the Big Jim, it was really good, especially considering my sobriety level, the gravy and chicken was just what I needed to carry on last night. The wife to be got herself a Bumble Bee which she deemed quite delicious. You'll have to take her word on that, as I was not able to procure any samples for my taste laboratory.

Always wanting to try new places, my brother and I came here for dinner one evening for their happy hour. It was too humid outside so we snagged two seats at the bar inside. It's a small trailer-like spot with a bathroom reminiscent of one in an airplane. It was cooler inside but a bit cramped of course, and I didn't appreciate being around alcohol and the smell but it was worth it being indoors.We ordered the jackfruit fries from their HH menu to start and I got the Bumblebee biscuit. My brother got the Koko biscuit, which he enjoyed. I thought the fries were great, shoestring topped with purple slaw and jackfruit, such an interesting and tasty food. I loved my biscuit, the fried chicken was done right and the sweet and savory flavors of honey and mustard worked really well. Topped with pickles for a nice crunch and change of texture. There are several vegan options as noted by the V on the menu. Definitely a great spot for dinner and open late."}, {"review_id": "avVYBRxV4kT8OcyDTQzPsA", "user_id": "iCQKx9z2lHlDlZe0hOSqFA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "This place is such a great little gem located in central Phoenix.
