We have had Ethiopian food multiple time in NY city and NJ suburbs (Awash, Injera, Meskeram, Mesob and others) but Zemeta exceeded all those places in such flavorful food. Even Ethio coffee was so much better than anything in big NYC restaurants.Must stop if you like Ethiopian food !!"}, {"review_id": "nkpgZk7TBiYYykhPMkQobA", "user_id": "2QuyLZLt-Ye3WiR23wFCvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "My friend wanted to catch up and chose this place. Of course yummy places are located where there is little to no parking available! Other than that we both ordered the veggie platter and the server combined our platter into one big sharing platter! It was very convenient and interactive for us as we caught up with what's new with our lives. The food was amazing and their bread...is not regular bread where you eat, feel lethargic, and sleep with guilt. No- the bread was light, fluffy, and I ate feeling healthy and happy! I also ordered the Ethiopian coffee which was also tasty and bitter. I like bitter coffee in general so this was refreshing in its one little espresso cup on top of a saucer. Overall I highly recommend this place!"}, {"review_id": "wbe4W5rwRl579CcV0LZ8VQ", "user_id": "nQE96j0z3aEqrjjeaa88-g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "I wanted so badly to fall in love with this place, but the hideous decor turned what could have been an amazing experience into something mediocre. We got the veggie plate (which is listed as enough for 2 people and priced at $10, but it's actually $10 each?) and were really impressed. The waitress was extremely friendly and she took the time to explain what each item was. There were lentils, spinach, beets, cabbage and carrots that were all wonderfully seasoned. We enjoyed the food very much, but the atmosphere was all wrong. There was not nearly enough lighting, the tables were covered with tacky, bright cloth napkins, and the walls were adorned with random pictures. This place would be 5 stars from me if the setting showed off Ethiopian culture in the same way that the food does."}, {"review_id": "qxLpU3blvsQXeZOyPG-8WQ", "user_id": "WDNo8ijTRREGGftekLWBBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/1/2017", "text": "I cannot say enough good things about this place! To be fair, I've only ever gotten one dish here-- the vegetarian platter-- but it is probably the best Ethiopian food I've had, and the prices can't be beat. My favorite dish is the yellow lentil one, followed closely by the potatoes. I don't know the real names for any of them, which goes to show that I'm not what you would call an Ethiopian-cuisine connoisseur. I came to Zemeta recently with my parents and we ordered the veggie sampler platter and one meat dish and it was plenty for three people (even though I didn't eat any of the meat dish). And I just couldn't believe the price, especially after recently going to an Ethiopian place in Buffalo where the same basic platter cost almost twice as much! I'm moving to Buffalo soon and I will have to return here before I go... I will sadly miss this place! I only wish I'd discovered it sooner."}, {"review_id": "Ecp1q6w6aP7BYSXOLOAb2g", "user_id": "EPiSVJVmI2PpG08MIBXO2g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/7/2017", "text": "I have been wanting to try this restaurant out for a while. I finally got the chance a couple of weeks ago with a friend. Another mutual friend had told me there are 3 Ethiopian restaurants in the area but this one is the most authentic, she was right. We were seated right away and the place was cozy. Our waitress was very attentive. We decided to not do the communal plating since my friend needed to have vegetarian. She ended up ordering the vegeterian platter and I ordered the mix of meats combination of beef, Ethopian pot roast and lamb. The best part of the meal is that it also came with a side of salad and mixed veggies, certainly a well-balanced meal. The meal was rich and flavorful with lots of leftovers to take home. We also enjoyed our after drink of Ethopian coffee and tea. Would highly come back again!"}, {"review_id": "fcHmry89q4QeZOQn-4QT8A", "user_id": "LkXNQQaIc5yrKu9Ap87RrA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/4/2017", "text": "I made one mistake going here.  The mistake was having any food beforehand.  Not just because the portions are ample, but because there are so many things to choose from.  So many, we decided to get two different combination plates.  We ate in.  We have to eat in when we do Ethiopian.  The injera was of course perfect.  Everything was superb.  Tons of flavor variety even for the most jaded of foodies.  The salad that came with the combination, it wasn't just a filler to take up space next to the mains.  My wife and I even lovingly fought over who got to finish it off.  The cinnamon of the ***** dish was light and spiced without overpowering the flavor of the meat.  Parking may be a bit more difficult during the dinner hours but we were happy to get parking less than a block away in the local community streets during lunch hours.  Clearly locally owned and ran, the atmosphere is comfortable neighborhood establishment, it even seemed the people working there knew everyone eating there, except for us of course.If I lived in Rochester this would be a favorite place to go, I just wish my own locally owned Ethiopian place was this good and this affordable."}, {"review_id": "SYUY_EV9zlARsLINrhva_Q", "user_id": "W7L84TjD63VwR6wE_tRL8A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/25/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "One of the best dining experiences of my life.

Be warned that if it's busy, or even if it isn't, you'll be waiting a bit longer than you expect for food. Once you eat though, you'll forget every hangry thought you had because IT. IS. WORTH. IT. I've tried the beef combos and the vegetarian combo and have loved them all. For the beef combos, unlike other Ethiopian restaurants, Zemeta sautées a lot of the beef dishes, which does make it a bit more oily. I've found that other restaurants are more stewed or braised meats. Zemeta's sautéed meats give it a nice char and flavor. Even the beef dishes that can be eaten raw have an interesting smoke to them without being cooked! The veggie combination is where Zemeta shines! It's plenty of food for 2 and all for $10! You get multiple types of spiced chickpeas, lentils, and cooked greens. I'm not a huge veggie lover but I am a lover of this vegetarian platter! I highly recommend it to all, and if you feel you need a carnivorous protein, add a lamb or beef dish on the side - but expect to take half of everything home then. While the service can be a bit slow, the care and genuine kindness of waitress (who is owner Zemeta) is impeccable. She makes you feel welcomed and like family, and is very patient in explaining all of the dishes to you. I encourage EVERYONE to come to Zemeta and try her dishes - worth all of the time in the world!"}, {"review_id": "5y6XFM-Lpw1y_73ohZU7Hw", "user_id": "Te2F4roniraVwRI6ZJjysA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "Used to dine here regularly, until I had the buffet.

I have been here about 8 times and it has never disappointed me. If you have never tried Ethiopian food, you have NO idea what you have been missing. Its slow cooked food i.e. the service will be slower than normal because this place actually puts heart and soul into cooking you a meal, rather than pushing you out the door even when they are busy. Compared to the rates the portion sizes are huge and literally finger-licking delicious, so be prepared to eat a lot or take leftovers. Heard of Ethiopian Coffee? Try it made from an actual Ethiopian. The owner, Zemeta is very polite and always checking on us from time to time. I could not recommend this place enough !

Even with the vegetarian dishes, the lentils and vegetables were the ultimate in filling portions and packed with dense, well-rounded spices and flavor. For a meat-eater they were more than filling and savory. Quite affordable too! About $10 each. The orange lentils were by far my favorite, the red ones had a bit more heat, the potatoes were meaty, and the injera like a sourdough crepe and balanced out the heat. I enjoyed the cold spinach and salad to mellow out my palate. It's very cozy in there too. About 10 tables and cute decor - art on the walls and tablecloths.
