One word, AMAZING!!! I think the prices for the pie was $4.50 per slice or $23 for a whole pie. We did not order food but it looked good and portions were large. We talked to some locals and their kids (approximate ages were 6 and 8 yrs old) said this was their favorite restaurant."}, {"review_id": "A-oo8BQv051sL6fGuyegqQ", "user_id": "oZcaA8Wgv762u51W54oTRw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "I heard that they have the best biscuits ever. I thought they were as good as any regular biscuit I've ever had. I had bacon, scrambled eggs, waffle, and cheese grits. The bacon was cheap hotel bacon and eggs were dry and cold. Grits we're ok at best. The waffle was good it tasted different but it was good. My friend I was dining with had biscuits and sausage gravy and he didn't enjoy it.

Sunday morning. It was 9:30am and the place was busy. Staffs are friendly. We ordered one small turkey sandwich and 2 eggs with bacon and hash brown, an orange juice and a hot tea. We didn't have to wait long time. It was little bit bad smell inside the place. The reason why I gave 3 star cuz for only small breakfast that wasn't full us, it cost $18.80. I didn't expect for that much. I could get a big breakfast for same money in other food shop. They do open kitchen which is you can see how they cook your food. I saw they put a small pan on top of those hash browns. That's not good at all. We also didn't get any receipt with price of each item from a accountant. We was confused about why we had to pay that much money."}, {"review_id": "xpVUdJcrhxhn6m-TMAJjtw", "user_id": "pGdhU7M5_0bsp6BaT7zh8g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/8/2017", "text": "Came in for a quick dessert and was not disappointed! Visiting Shreveport for the day and looked up some local eats and found this place. The inside is fun and covered in quirky murals. Seat yourself. Nice menu with breakfast, lunch, dinner, and desserts; cheap prices. For dessert 4 of us split a piece of the Strawberry Pie and the Coconut Pie - yummy!! The photos online looked great and the pie tasted even greater. The strawberries were super fresh, the cream topping perfectly sweetened, and the crust was just the right texture and thickness. At this point let me also add that I consider myself a pie aficionado, and am constantly in search of great pies. The coconut pie was also excellent, very creamy and light, plenty of delicious coconut flakes, with the same great crust. 4 stars instead of 5 because the fries we got to go were very bland and needed lots of seasoning, though they were perfectly cooked. I don't live anywhere near here but would return."}, {"review_id": "HpUP0bclHnbNWS7csRbi6w", "user_id": "646QyEQ-xjua8wpaPfOoYQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/14/2017", "text": "I've only had the pies here so my review is on the pies and the atmosphere. We got a slice of the coconut, strawberry, and chocolate pies. I think the strawberry pie was the best one but the other two were delicious as well. The atmosphere here is super laid back; you seat yourselves and look at the menu while at the table. The murals are pretty entertaining to look at as well. Our server was friendly and helpful with recommendations. I will definitely be back for more strawberry piePeach season is June and July! ~8 weeks."}, {"review_id": "ZN7IcDpu8XYTJTf76pBQPQ", "user_id": "D9o7QYqxRj0w0hnnixbLAQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "I love vintage places like this.

First and foremost, the food is nothing special. I sat at the counter and watched as my food was prepared. The bacon was put in a deep fryer, rather than a flat top and was a curled up, mangle of grease. My blueberry pancakes was ok, but the cook just put a few in the center so more bites than not did not have blueberries.If you worry about food safety, this not your place. I watched the cook crack eggs and handle raw meat, then touch other food. I also saw waitresses handling food prep such as pieces of toast, but neither the cook or waitresses washed their hands.For a place that pans itself as feel-good, down home cooking, I found the price tag kinda steep. One waffle with blueberries, three strips of bacon and coffee was $13 before I added in a tip. I have paid a lot less for a lot more quantity and better quality elsewhere."}, {"review_id": "ue-ocQBWj5DYpBp9C_n_mA", "user_id": "jCVleQIdH1atAB8dMyFG_A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "I wasn't super impressed by the food but great atmosphere and service gave a good experience.

The waitress was a ninja. Will drive 6 hours from South Texas for this any day.Have breakfast! The biscuits are soooo good. Crispy HOT bacon, huge pancakes. The bacon.Pound blocks of butter everywhere so don't be shy. Got Pie cause Yelp said so... Not a pie person but you can't miss with strawberries and cream...and it was complimentary cause I think they knew we were tourists.Tons of parking out back so don't freak out...BUT you will have to take a flight of stairs and walk by the back sink and kitchen area...it was kind of awesome. Kids loved it and we felt like locals cause they were walking in with us.Cool spot, kids had fun and loved the artwork in the walls!"}, {"review_id": "bCP_XWGdD8dX74vfdGHyGA", "user_id": "5kl52hWOfpbRg2qGAtsSog", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Stopped by after doing a quick yelp search. We parked in the back and went up the stairs. It looked sketchy, but we entered anyway. We entered through the back of the restaurant, near restrooms and kitchen. Breakfast was concluding as we were told the main eating area was closed. Once we found a table towards the front entrance, we were greeted and a waitress took our drink order. Another waitress checked on us and asked for our drink order again. Our food came out faster than expected. We had the grilled chicken salad (added strawberries) and the generous lunch portion of chicken fried steak. Overall, good place for a nice meal."}, {"review_id": "2el6ekQk0FBiKYxDMysqAw", "user_id": "J_fAKZO8DR4W2ajzgBMspQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Can't beat this place.I was hungry, irritated, and just wanted to eat.I picked this because my boyfriend and I were fighting over what we wanted, because we just couldn't decide.
