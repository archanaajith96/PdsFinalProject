Came on a Sunday morning, crazy busy, was going to be a 50 min wait for 2 of us but there was a bar that seats 6 and wasn't long before 2 seats opened up there, so 50 min turned into 5, nice! For as busy as it was, they were extremely organized, from the wait staff to the chefs to the hosts, they have their sh*t together, was very impressed. Everyone smiled and were quick about what they were doing, not stressed, more efficient than anything. Great teamwork was displayed. Food came at a decent time after we ordered. Had the Marisa skillet and the Upton pancakes, both delicious. We parked on the street, which there was plenty of, but looks like they have a lot in the back, which we didn't realize until we left through the side door. (Side door is a great idea so not everyone is leaving through the main door, where everyone waiting for a table is standing)A lot of people ordered for pick up, and even that was well organized (pick up was right next to the bar area). They offer a to-go coffee if you had ordered coffee, another great idea! Loved this place and would def return!"}, {"review_id": "OzbIiDSg-PvN_xgGE58xDQ", "user_id": "YgYYfZ4ZkWecFVXjsQ9iqg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Food is great but there is such large quantities it makes it kind of gross.

This is where Brilliance and Modesty meet in the middle and welcome you home.  I've never had anything here that I wouldn't eat 100 times over.  The place is PACKED on the weekends... but it's worth the wait if you have the time.I don't care if you are watching your weight, pick one of their Benedict options and add a waffle on the side... trust me, you'll feel a little dirty at first... but it gets better and in the end there are never any regrets or pregnancies.  It's way better than your bad Saturday night choices 12 years ago you are still hiding from.The food, the neighborhood, the people, the THE... just all of it.  It was cool before Hipster idiots found it and it will be cool when they're all 40 and 30 pounds overweight, still feeling the Bern, and working in a cubicle for the same system they claimed to have been against.Wolfgang's will always be Wolfgang's, whether I love it, you love it, or God loves it.  It.

However the restaurant is quite large and has a ton of seating.We had a multitude of different foods ordered and everyone was satisfied with their food. The skillets were very filling and large. The asparagus was crisp and eggs were fresh. The omelettes were huge and stuffed with meat and the coffee was flavorful and bottomless. Although some of the breakfast meals are a little costly, the portions were plentiful and we were able to take home left overs. Next time I would probably split a skillet with my wife as well as a cinnamon roll or parfait.

We drive an hour and forty five minutes to come here and it's worth it. Our most recent trip out today was pretty normal, we arrived to a 40 or so person line which was expected. We were seated within 30-35 minutes and had a phenomenal waitress who's name escapes me now, but Wolfgang's staff is always second to non. We ordered a signature cinnamon roll and to our dismay received their \"new cinnamon roll\" which is actually French toast topped similar to how the old one was which we were informed had been replaced. It still taste good but it's not a cinnamon roll, its French Toast with frosting. Moving past that I had the Crab Benedict Sriracha and my wife had a J.B.'s combo, both were exceptional!"}, {"review_id": "hOSuKlqfILH3785LQdNpjA", "user_id": "Ahy51wN3uvmfG2RYliMvVQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I've heard good things about Wolfgang's and it turns out all the good reviews were true.

I'm not a huge coffee drinker but the hazelnut coffee was very delicious. All the portions of food were large and were fairly priced. I got the Jamaican chicken frittata and a side of waffles and it was amazing. The staff was also very friendly and would check up on us frequently.

Specifically, he went on and on about the Missad and how it was huge and glorious and amazing.We were in town recently and after viewing their menu, I insisted we visit! Unfortunately, there was a large group (8 adults) of us and we arrived at prime breakfast time, so there was quite a wait. Uncle Ron's skillet looked perfect to me and when it came out, it was everything I hoped it would be. The Cafe Wolfgang also sounded like a nice indulgence, so I was pleased with that as well!Our service was great, we had a nice big table, and everyone was pleased with their meals. My husband and his friends all demolished their Missads, so we are now wondering if maybe they are a bit smaller than they were in the past...or maybe they just grew up and got bigger appetites! I definitely want to go to Wolfgang's again next time I'm in town, but next time I would like to try one of the pancake or waffle breakfasts!"}, {"review_id": "NDwmo1j-FDwF_tBxV6J-Wg", "user_id": "QSMZ0JkMsCf5lfsGBkJG7A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "If you haven't been to Wolfgang's for breakfast, then you haven't lived a good breakfast outting.

When i got there the difficulty of finding the door just to get it was kinda a struggle since we aren't form here. Venture around back and back around til we realize the door was near all the other business. Upon going in they had a line of people waiting due to the already popularity of the restaurant. Waited a good 40 min til we were seated and while walking to our table they place is moderate size and majority of the are meant for 4 or less people. Which seems to be most of people that are dining there. The restaurant also had a more old homey feeling to it which was nice. The waiter came after we got settled and was very helpful on any question we had to ask. Also help my girlfriend on what choice to make since she stuck in between 2 different menu item. But there menu has everything that's nice for  breakfast food. The food was great in portion and the taste was amazing. I got there signature wolfgang benedict (i think that's whats its called). Was simply amazing for breakfast as a mention portion was filling and the taste was amazing. I got no complaint on the food it is simply amazing.Overall for breakfast this place a a great place for breakfast or brunch. The portion are great and so tasty as well. Worth a place to try especially when you're from out of town since the locals seems to love this place as well.

You can tell how amazing the food is by the typical 20 minute wait during peak breakfast and brunch hours on weekends, but that wait shouldn't deter you from finding out why it's so awesome. They have a very extensive omelette, skillet, sandwich, pancake, waffle, etc. etc. menu. I've never had a dish I didn't like! I have, however, gotten into an ordering rut, getting the same thing every time: a buttered croissant and the Forsyth breakfast skillet (potatoes, mushrooms, broccoli, peppers, tomatoes, onions, and cheese). It comes with a side of hollandaise, but I'm not a fan, so I give it to my fiancé, who usually drizzles it over whatever waffle/egg/strawberry concoction he has in front of him. Our servers are always fantastic, and one woman even remembers our orders from week to week (very impressive considering how many people they serve)! Lastly, the prices for Wolfgang's are awesome - our bill is usually around $25 or $26 - including tip - for two entrées, my croissant, and Bob's yummy hazelnut coffee (free refills). Oh, and I should mention that the Matt Wolfgang movie mock-posters crack me up every time. :)"}, {"review_id": "gwQL2UoNk1fhloxPoB1jWA", "user_id": "rRGDy3Z8kkU8dvn79GeIfw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/29/2016", "text": "Blueberry pancakes were so large the syrup had no where to go in my plate.

It was the Lyndsey or something like that...spinach, ham, cheese, tomatoes and poached eggs in some heavenly bun. Also huge! I was feeling adventurous. My prize...a happy tummy.
