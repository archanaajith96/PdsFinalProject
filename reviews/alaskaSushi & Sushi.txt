Our waitress was grumpy and unfriendly. She seemed extremely agitated if we asked questions about the menu like.... \"what's in the sushi lunch special.\" She only replied \"chef's choice.\" She could have at least told me what kind of sushi chef might be serving since he's been making the same sushi lunch special all morning. But no... that was it. I definitely wouldn't have ordered that if she gave me the slightest clue that there would only be California rolls. When we sat down, she didn't offer us any drinks. When we asked about suggestions about specialty rolls, she just gave us a dumb stare. So we asked more specific questions like... which fried roll would be good? That was like pulling teeth. My boyfriend asked if we could add cream cheese to that roll and she said... no you should just get this roll if you want cream cheese. She never checked on us or came back to the table. Other servers and food runners helped us instead.She didn't even bring our check. I get it if they pool tips, but this one waitress could ruin it for the rest of the team.It was just an odd experience. The sushi is not what we expected and the waitress was just so unfriendly that I definitely will not come back here."}, {"review_id": "ykKj9AII2ahRR0Wjr0_zvQ", "user_id": "9ddeIKpb8u24klUqForrsw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/23/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I don't think I will be returning after my husband's birthday dinner.I made a reservation online for a decently-sized group of people (~16) and when I called to confirm, they demanded I provide a credit card number to reserve the room if only 80% (so, 12) of our party showed up. I could make changes to the reservation, though, until the day of. I was leery about giving my card over the phone.So, the dinner itself was actually good. The service was great, most of our food was pretty tasty, and the server who showed up with our bills made sure that we all knew the automatic gratuity was already included in the prices so we didn't overtip.But what really pissed me off was that not even five minutes after our bills were collected that we were asked to leave. Half of us still had half-full (or full!!) beers and wine glasses! They said there was another party waiting. Our reservation was at 6:30 and it was just about 7:45 and they were literally kicking us out the moment we paid so they could seat another large party. Everyone was so ticked off and were hurriedly chugging their drinks so we could go, and all complained about how rude it was. It was literally a \"give us your money, now GTFO\" situation. Never have I been so turned off! More than one of the guests said they wouldn't come back to Sushi & Sushi. If only they had been polite and let us take a few more minutes to finish our drinks and go, then I wouldn't have been writing this review. But instead, we got to suffer the consequences of their overlapping reservation scheduling."}, {"review_id": "STRukNSE3rxFIRF3zY9JLQ", "user_id": "OsZ_5G7zbXycL6Evf0ElBA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/13/2017", "text": "I last went to Sushi & Sushi (who in the world came up with that name?) for lunch on my birthday with my mom. I had been there with friends several times 5-6 years ago. I remember the rolls being unique and flavorful, but smaller in size than other sushi joints. The same holds true today. I got the chirashi lunch, which was overpriced for the portion size. The fish was delicious though, I'll give them that. The interior is among the more upscale by Anchorage sushi spot standards.Service was basically nonexistent, although that may be because we went during peak lunch hours. We had to flag down our server for water refills and to get the check. She came off as a bit standoffish but that could be because the restaurant was packed. Overall it was okay, but not as good as I expected from the rave reviews here. I'll have to go at a different time to see if that makes a difference."}, {"review_id": "8RDvZHqCd-fvqlhwvvSVXQ", "user_id": "mMtbc6HKpoeu1YoKmErlQw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Still one of our favorite sushi places in Anchorage! The sushi was really fantastic, very tasty and delicious. The Lobster crunch roll is awesome. They have a relatively huge serving portions for their food which is also a big plus.The ambiance is laid back and comfortable, very relaxing. The wait staff if also very friendly and accommodating. Two thumbs up. Definitely one of the best sushi spots in town!"}, {"review_id": "NiU2xQXgAALfbzRN48OWDA", "user_id": "mMNQzUKH58U1dgiagm5F5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "From the outside of this place you think it's not going to be that nice on the inside.

Sushi & Sushi is no let down that is for sure. During my families recent trip (who are also from Hawaii) we went here for one last dinner. The atmosphere is open, there's a bar along with sports playing on the television, and above all...the sushi. Oh man, we loved it! Everyone, even my 11-year-old son enjoyed it! If you want good sushi without worrying about the quality, have no fear of Sushi & Sushi.

Not to mention it's piled high enough to need 4 bites. Also the salmon nigiri was like 4 inches long! Bigger than the rice. That never happens CONUS.Service is great. 5:30 PM on a Tuesday was pretty busy but not without seats. I can see parking getting a bit tricky when it's lunch or dinner.I opted for beef udon as my main course and it was so good.. warm, sweet, and tender... perfect for a cold night.. with tons to take home after!If you're in Anchorage and want some good seafood in its raw prime...come here!"}, {"review_id": "ZNERuPwdIX73szoW_pS7iw", "user_id": "w7FqGC3HfutOnYb_UVjEmg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "Not my favorite sushi place.

First, it's a lot of food.  Halibut is perfectly cooked.  Everything fried on that plate was perfectly cooked.  Though breaded and fried, there was ZERO oil on the plate.  My roll was good, but not nearly enough sushi for me.  I would have liked to try others, but didn't want to break the bank either.  I think I'll wait to go home to Reno to eat sushi again, but they did do a great job!"}, {"review_id": "XoCmpUMufvIV3otNvoxh6A", "user_id": "0qRtPZgvZQWLhbsYkgiWiw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "I tried this after flying in for my first visit to Alaska.

The upside is that they tend to plate up large portions so you're left will meal #2. I still enjoy their sashimi and entrees but I have really been enjoying the spicy miso soup. It is the perfect dish to warm up in Alaska. I find myself alternating between the soup and sashimi fresh rolls. The rolls are large and filled with fresh sashimi, cucumber and avocado, how could it get better than that? I think Sushi and Sushi has the best teriyaki sauce because it is no overwhelmingly sweet or thick. It tastes good on both their chicken and salmon. If you're really hungry or just want a variety, I would recommend the Bento because you get the best of both worlds: sushi and teriyaki with tempura. They have some great tempura here!The wait can be long and the service slow but just be patient and you (and your belly) will be satisfied."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-and-sushi-anchorage?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
