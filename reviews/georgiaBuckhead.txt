We got there earlier than expected, because we thought we were not familiar with the place and would take us more time to get there.  I love the exterior and set of the restaurant.  As we entered, we waited for about 5 minutes till we were greeted, another 5 minutes till we got helped and was told they will be sitting us at our reservation time, which was in 15 minutes.  We did not mind the wait, and we practically watch everyone else coming through the door waiting to be helped as well.  When there was a walk in, I was surprised that they were able to sit right away, and when another party showed up for the same time reservation as ours, they were helped immediately.  That was already a negative vibe for me, but I wanted to be optimistic and try their food.We ordered the kids food right away since we could not figure out what we wanted to try.  We had asked for recommendation and the waiter just said anything in the beef section was recommended.  I hear another person asking the same question and a waiter explaining every detailed menu she would recommend, I could not say the same for ours.  My husband and I waited almost an hour for our food after ordering.  During our wait, we received food we did not order but orders for the couple across us, we ate of our kids fries, and then eventually giving us an appetizer because of the wait we were experiencing.  I think they should have given our salads the least while we waited for our food.  So after our wait, we finally get our salads and our order.  I must say my ribeye roll 14oz beef was cooked to perfection.  I would not recommend spending $200 on this place with the lack of customer service we received."}, {"review_id": "6w_1-3uBUVPJ6vJWiYLqGQ", "user_id": "tX4UzsVuZxYjQn5U5QuUGQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/12/2017", "text": "We were going to spend over $100 for dinner for 2, because the restaurant seemed nice and we were going to splurge.  The place was practically empty on a Tuesday night.After our server finally showed up with a trainee in tow, she gave us waters, and we ordered dirt cokes, which we were promptly told were not refillable. Really?  Over 40 bucks an entree and they're too cheap to refill sodas?Then we sat. And sat. And sat. No bread, no nothing. Someone brought out an old wine bottle filled with water so we could serve ourselves in case we wanted more water(which told us that our service was probably going to suck). After 10 minutes of waiting, our servers finally reappeared. Without our sodas. Disgusted, we left. I would not recommend bothering to give them a chance. Not at these prices."}, {"review_id": "PNRKx9yMSLCGyRn9zKjb4w", "user_id": "o05Nhq9JopLWUe55UwwC-w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "11/29/2017", "text": "We were a party of 19 and Buckhead was gracious to accept our reservation the same day. We were visiting from out of town and we wanted to have a nice place to have dinner and celebrate birthdays of two people in our group. The demographics of our group are mid-high level managers.  When we arrived for our 7pm reservation, a gentlemen wearing a chefs outfit (odd) greeted us at the  host/hostess counter - he politely showed us to our table set in the fireplace room near the  lounge. The ambience of the restaurant was amazing and the temperature was comfortable. We were all excited to experience Buckhead because we had read the glowing Yelp reviews and the restaurant boasted 4.5 stars.The two waitresses introduced themselves and described how they were going to serve our large group. The waitresses proceeded to take our drink and meal orders. This is when our events took a downward turn. The waitresses assigned went from two to one and infrequently checked on our table.  Our table received salads ONE HOUR and FIFTEEN MINUTES after all orders were placed.  TEN MINUTES later appetizers arrived for two of our guests (coconut shrimp) presentation of the appetizers was unappealing.   The entrees didn't arrive until ONE HOUR and FIFTY MINUTES later. FOOD:  The people in our party were quite upset when the entrees arrived, those that ordered steaks (rib eye, prime rib, NY strip) ALL came with a type of brown sauce on top of the steak - which is very unusual. One person stated I ordered prime rib and this isn't prime rib it looks more like a ribeye. The consensus on the table was the brown sauce was an attempt to cover the type of steak being served - just AWFUL!  Thankfully, I ordered the marbled lamb (med rare) it was cooked well and temperature was nice but still took the same time to arriveSERVICE:  Upon completion of our entree the waitresses brought out two chocolate mousse with blueberries topped with whipped cream and a candle for us to sing happy birthday to our colleagues.  When the checks arrived it took the wait staff over 30 min to process payments and they lost accountability of what meals were paid or settled, luckily one of my friends opened his bank app on his smartphone and showed the wait staff he had been charged already for his meal and drinks (they were attempting to run his credit card again).  In addition, I had not received my check for the marbled lamb but was told the only item remaining to be paid was a Ribeye - thankfully the same price.  The bartender (don't know if he was asst manager) had to come to our table to assist the wait staff on figuring out how to settle all checks - he apologized profusely and stated the wait staff was brand new - hmm.   Why any manager would put his B Team on a large party is setting up his organization for failure?CONCLUSION: The food was NOT/NOT  commensurate with the price point nor the presentation expected at high-end steakhouse restaurants. The wait staff was set up by their management to fail - they were doing their best given the pace of the kitchen and other customers in the restaurant.  For group parties plan for another location - we do frequently visit Columbus but will not/not visit Buckhead!"}, {"review_id": "kAd_qqXF2DE1bMKRD94JGg", "user_id": "E24E51mJMGu22KNWzCFE4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "An absolute delight, My husband and I came here for date night and it was amazinggggg... the ambiance is perfect for a classy steakhouse. Anywho, they served us cucumber water, and if you make reservations and check in on yelp they offer you a free glass of wine. We had a wedge salad with blue cheese and balsamic, it tasted so fresh. And my husband ordered a steak, and I ordered the seafood. They also brought out bread (2 warmed mini croissants with butter), and while we were waiting the Chef sent out a delicious treat, it tasted amazing, I honestly have no idea what it was nor did I take a picture but it was great! The service was fantastic, friendly and checking in at the right times. My husband loved it so much he asked me to write down the name of this place.

Rivaling that of Michelin rated restaurants I've been to.   I did not expect a restaurant of this stature to exist in the area.  The elk cooked medium rare is what we enjoyed and it was perfectly cooked. Charred to perfection leaving a delightful crust and just tender as can be in the center.  I had the risotto as my side and it was excellent.  I will be back again.  Don't miss out!"}, {"review_id": "bFeqcgpx7w9YLue4z76hSA", "user_id": "Nm6awCgUDrfLyOb1zveKog", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/16/2017", "text": "I went here on a Saturday around 7 pm and it wasn't crowded at all, there was plenty of parking! When I walked in I was greeted by this sweet little old man that held the door open for me and led me to my table. Once inside the vibe was really grown and sexy. It was dark and romantic and the music playing was really playing. After I sat down one of the servers came over and lit the candles at our table. Shortly after I was greeted by my server Jasmine! She was awesome. She was so chill and laid back!Jasmine thoroughly explained the menu to us which was really appreciated because we had never been there before. As she gave us a minute to look over the menu she brought over some croissants for us to munch on and OMG!!!! that's all I can say... The bread was soft, I literally ate the whole basket of croissants for my table #SorryNotSorryI ended up ordering the Panama City drink which was ok, but I've had better. For my entree, I ordered the Chicken Marsala with mash potatoes which were yummy! The chicken was tender and the mash potatoes was really good. I would definitely recommend. I can't wait to come back and try different items on the menu."}, {"review_id": "4Ide8G0CCjJLN_a7dRNF7w", "user_id": "CJFFlvV96sG1-CksCXbwSw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "The food was decent, but it was overpriced for what you received, and the service wasn't good. It was also empty on a Friday night, as was the case for many other reviewers. Reading the reviews in depth, I can't say I'll ever come back here. They were also a little rude when I presented a Groupon when it came time to pay. I never present groupons before we eat because I am afraid of bad service due to getting discounted food. Just FYI nothing we got was excluded on be Groupon either, we always read the fine print on all of it. That was also confirmed by the waitress.  Not that it matters because the service still wasn't good. Overall, it was okay. Wouldn't necessarily recommend to anyone, though."}, {"review_id": "aKL4-LgLEaYnlkFTAbp45A", "user_id": "sMBzgwl38S99B3A_5xdoHQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "The food is not worth the price.

Our Server Chandler gave us great service; very polite and pleasant young man who stayed on top of everything we could need or want.The food however while it was good, it wasn't great. My husband's ribeye wasn't anything you can't get a chain restaurant; not a great cut with lots of fat. Definitely not worth the price. I had the Lamb; which came with a heavy amount of a wine reduction sauce; once I scraped some of the sauce off, it was good. But I expected better for the price. The gator bites and salads were excellent. Their homemade dressing is amazing. I would recommend buying a bottle to take home.Overall the service is excellent, food is just average and a little over priced however we still want to go back and try other dishes and their Sunday brunch. Maybe it was just what we ordered. The service is worth every penny and makes you want to return."}, {"review_id": "lwRd2a_8xkdK5o6GjomoIQ", "user_id": "KFxgxOspfC3hUqc8lFReEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Expensive as hell but real good.
