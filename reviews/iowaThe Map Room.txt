And boy, was I impressed! The bar has a genuine authenticity and feel to it that I haven't seen in most other places in Cedar Rapids.   As one would expect, there are a variety of beers on tap... but OMG... The burgers! I had one of the best burgers I've ever tasted in my life at the Map Room!!  There were also a number of hummus and naans, as well as salads, on the menu, which I didn't try.  I will definitely be back for more burgers and beer!!"}, {"review_id": "YBGWr__N6Ep77YSqkvMG7g", "user_id": "IcU2n6r43RD9rbyeULyjGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "My father, my boyfriend, and I came for Saturday lunch and really enjoyed our experience. The cute little place had only one talented woman working the handful of tables and the bar. It got pretty full and it seemed like she coulda used a hand, but the quality of service was still excellent. The cozy quarters have cool wall paper, vintage maps and prints, and a touch of plants in the windows. The booths are stiff but intimate and I liked the silverware holder and the Trivial Pursuit cards on our table. After some debate, we ordered the campania crostini to share. It was my favorite part of lunch. My father \"built\" his own burger - double patty, goat cheese, bacon, and roasted tomatoes with a side of Cusco fries. That got two thumbs up, especially the fries. My boo thang got the Memphis burger with regular fries and inhaled it. I went with the Maui burger and Milwaukee fries, both of which I thought were just okay...scandal, I'm sure. It's cool though, because I'd still really like to try more of the menu. I love how different it is from other area restaurants and there's a lot to explore. Would definitely return and recommend to friends. Friendly service, cool atmosphere, great food. I'll be back for a New Orleans burger on the patio!"}, {"review_id": "Bj0UGZFfHB1hu1cBwG-MAQ", "user_id": "NQYHPJKTTq6J_iq2wghZ3A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "Being a native of Cedar Rapids, I make my annual holiday pilgrimage to the homeland around the holidays. In most cases we tend to go to the same spots for dinner that we have been going to since I was in high school and still living in Cedar Rapids. This year, I was determined to branch out and drag my mom and her (picky) boyfriend out with me. I stumbled across this place as the highest rated restaurant in Cedar Rapids, but hadn't heard of it.As someone who works in data and has a special love for geospatial data I cannot describe to you my reaction when I walked into the door of The Map Room. I guess I had just thought based on online descriptions that they put a cute map on the menu and called it good. No, this place is covered wall to wall in framed maps from all over the world, some antique and some depicting modern public transit. My only regret is that the place was pretty busy and therefore I couldn't access certain parts of the restaurant to view the maps because I would have been invading the personal space of others.The menu is both simplistic and unique to Cedar Rapids. Consisting of pretty much entirely burgers and fries, the menu contains burgers that you are not likely to find anywhere else in Cedar Rapids, unique creations inspired by various parts of the world as well as an extensive fries menu with various toppings. If none of that suits your fancy, you can even build your own burger to your liking. They also have vegetarian options. Their beer list was stellar and included a decent selection of local craft beer.I could not believe this place and spent nearly the entire dinner in awe and talking about how amazing it was. Definitely a hidden gem in Cedar Rapids and a new local favorite."}, {"review_id": "4NgMfqtF-LElAOGuH8b7Jw", "user_id": "rssn2Dg-FMLPYeGc7XL1hQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "For a real no-nonsense burger pub this is the place.  It's a small place but I kinda like it. No pretentious atmosphere, just good ol burgers and drinks. Just know the burgers are thin and cooked well done so it's NOT gourmet style burgers. But the burgers are good. The side of fries it came with is sooooo good. I'm a fan.

It is on the small side but has seating inside and outside. The beer on tap is really good with local beers and the regular standards. The menu is smaller but what they have is really good!  We split a Springfield Burger and Santa Fe Fries.  Burger was simple but high quality.  The Santa Fe Fries were excellent!!  Wow!  Fries were nice and crispy and the toppings did not overwhelm.

As you can tell, my expectations for what to expect from this place, were not very high.As soon as I walked in I knew this was going to be different. The Decour is rather unique and very interesting. Quite literally, it is a map room.  The other thing that struck me as different was how small the restaurant is. I believe there are maybe five booths and two tables.The menu is rather simplest, as well. It is one page, printed on both sides yet the variety of what they offer is tremendous.  I chose to have the Maui burger. That is a hamburger with spam, cheese pineapple and caramelized onions.  Holy cow! That was arguably one of the best burgers I have had in a very very long time. In fact, the entire dining experience was one of the best dinners I have had in quite a while.The beer menu was wonderful. The food was incredible. The french fries were perfection. If you get a chance, you absolutely have to eat at this restaurant. I cannot recommend it highly enough."}, {"review_id": "CLIY0K-l2VmsaTEwUjGrtA", "user_id": "wg7BIF9xfgiVNKpaX6QkHg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/1/2017", "text": "You need to check out The Map Room. Why you ask? Here's a snapshot:The atmosphere: library meets smoking lounge meets trendy comfortable hang out. It's small inside, but the vibrant green booths, fun map theme and cozy vibe make it feel like the perfect bar to hunker down; have a drink and a meal while chatting with friends.They also have an amazing patio area surrounded by a sky blue wall, picnic tables with yellow umbrellas, bistro lights and chairs. It's cool to sit in the middle of downtown, under the sky walk.The service: fantastic! The servers were so friendly and prompt. I felt like they could all be my friends they were so kind. The food: I applaud you! Taking it to the next level above and beyond the standard bar food, they really know what they are doing to think outside the bar food box. The menu is split 1) burgers 2) smothered fries / poutine 3) crostinis (toasted French bread topped with delightful combos of ingredients) 4) the salad of the day. My food order and thoughts: My husband ordered the Maui Burger with spam, pineapple, teriyaki and onion- he was in love. I ordered the Tangier crostini that was topped with humus, a cumin based blend of olive oil and herbs and kalamata olives - oh gee willikers was it tasty! I think what they are doing is a small, thoughtful menu WELL! Thank you Map Room!The drinks: beer on tap, beer in cans. VERY good wines by the glass (small selection but thoughtful) and cocktails (can't wait to try!) I heard rumors of a brunch to come and they also offer lunch during the week. Mimosas please! Overall: The Map Room is exactly the place you want to go, have a drink, good food and feel comfortable. I can't wait for the weather to cool down and for me to sit inside, in a cozy booth sipping a cocktail."}, {"review_id": "Dqjvi-9O5sRo_cac_TNFug", "user_id": "r4UrwYUHooiYD8QdccTKkw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Haven't been here since it was Stella's. Awesome little place that I have been wanting to go to for awhile now.  Cleverly decked out with maps throughout the restaurant...hence the name. The burgers are all named after different places.  Looked at the menu and realized that if the food is any good, I will be back on multiple occasions.  And boy was it!!!  I got the grilled cheese sandwich.  Oooey and goooey and delicious.  YUMMMM!!!  Loved it!!  And for my side I got french fries, covered with beer cheese and bacon. Obviously I'm a health-nut. .  Service was spot on and very attentive. Can't wait to get back and try the chipped beef on toast and their burgers (which I've been told, are extremely tasty as well)."}, {"review_id": "SJBkVZ9QjvoMsXpuJVH7nQ", "user_id": "AAqCWD6MLM2sA8CTJLvZsg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Cute little establishment located where Stella's used to be, decorated with interesting maps obtained from the travels of the owners.

It's a nice little location with an inviting ambiance. Having burgers topped with different things based on places / cultures around the world is awesome! From El Paso to Maui to Bangkok , The Map Room makes it all accessible to your table. The staff was super friendly and very attentive. The menu is small but has a lot of variety. Prices were decent but a tad on the higher side especially if you get something to drink ($2.50ea). I had heard people talking up the fries a lot on Facebook, so I was pretty excited. I got them instead of a really tasty sounding salad. To me they tasted like any other fry you'd get at a fast food place. They weren't terrible, but I fail to see why people were raving about them so much. The burgers themselves looked almost like a piece of art. Masterfully crafted and carefully put together, they look great. Buns tasted and looked of a higher quality. I got the El Paso and the green chiles, queso fresco, and braised pork were solid. Okay flavor and generous amounts.The burger itself left something to be desired though. It tasted and looked like real beef and not some gross pressed patty which is a huge plus. I don't think they season the meat though, and if they do it isn't much. The actual beef didn't have any flavor. And I understand that maybe the gimmick of the place is everything on top of the burger -- but it's still a burger place and they don't treat the burger as well as they should. In the end, it was a nice experience and something different to try once. The food was OK enough but there are better BURGERS in the surrounding area, leaving little reason to stand out or make a return. Unfortunate, I was so excited about this place."}, {"review_id": "c62kDGdFKVPcp-jw5QCMkw", "user_id": "BAJKnLxpT4n4kEX4jFUvvQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "Cutest, comfiest spot around.  Not much of a burger person, but they have some great burger recipes.  Visited with an old friend before Christmas.  Couldn't have chosen a better spot.  Good service.  Friendly, available, but not in the way.Sad it is so small because it would prevent me from trying to get in on a weekend, but the smallness is what makes it special."}, {"review_id": "h2alfQJmydQF9wSZ_f4wZw", "user_id": "HVe_ezpUqY7TEhKWFWtM_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "Great variety of burgers that were prepared perfectly.  Choice of fries and salad, I chose the salad wife had fries.  The fries were perfect with great seasoning.  Did not care for the salad just not the combinations I cared for, but wife enjoyed it.  A must stop place to eat in Cedar Rapids.Updated 11/27/17...

I had the Memphis burger with fries.  My burger was juicy and the pork was not over sauced. I did substitute cheddar for the American cheese. My daughter had the grilled cheese and tomato soup. The grilled cheese was golden, crispy and gooey, everything you want for grilled cheese. The tomato soup was another winner, not salty and tastes homemade.

The most difficult part was trying to decide which burger I wanted! It was cooked perfectly, the bun it was on was so fresh and the top was crispy. LOVELY! I had the soup of the day which was delicious and tasted VERY homemade! The fries came out and couldn't have been more perfect! Fresh cut, crispy on the outside, soft inside. Not too salty. We had to push them away because we both said, \"These fries are AMAZING, but I can't eat them all!\" Well, we could, but had to stop ourselves from even ordering more!
