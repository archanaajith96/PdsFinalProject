Peppers Cafe in the Double Eagle Resturant is a delight!!  Tucked away in Historic Old Mesilla on the Plaza, you wouldn't guess there's an amazing oasis inside!  Our server, Audri was so nice and helpful.  Food was excellent.  The ambiance was so relaxing.  Fountain in the patio with live plants added to the relaxing lunch.  Took a wander through the establishment, what an incredible job they have done with the decor.  Property is clean and well maintained as well.  Looking forward to the next time!!!"}, {"review_id": "tovSPkme279U5z1GYiuS-Q", "user_id": "j8fOEvZjtI3-1NxQnkZe8w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/10/2017", "text": "This review is for Peppers, the restaurant within Double Eagle that's open for lunch. What a treat! Came here with my husband for a nice lunch and wasn't disappointed. The ambience of the bar and building was fantastic and we were seated in the patio area of the building next to an indoor fountain. The chairs were a bit rickety, but we didn't mind. We ordered drinks to start; I had the pickle juice Bloody Mary and my husband ordered a Bloody Mary made with tequila. Both were fabulous. Our waitress was so freakin' nice! I'm not sure why folks are complaining about the service here, but we had no trouble. I ordered the Prime Rib Cheesesteak and it was delicious. It came with a green chile and queso and was so big I had to eat it with a fork. I would definitely recommend this place for a leisurely lunch followed by a walk around the plaza."}, {"review_id": "HDaLp0Xp8FYYQYTIfhJqkw", "user_id": "JPn73UyVjZS1JiLzooVZHQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/9/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Peppers Review: Anyone who's ever been to Double Eagle knows that the historical building and surrounding area are incredibly beautiful. If you ever have a chance to visit this location do yourself a favor and wander around a bit, it is an amazing place. Having recently dined at Double Eagle during the day, in its manifestation as Peppers I have conflicted feelings. The quality of the food was beyond reproach. I ordered the relleno burger and I was impressed with the quality of meat and the bun (OMG great bun!). Having said that, the complete, and I mean complete absence of any heat in the salsa, queso, or the green chile was extremely ydisappointing for myself as a Cruceño. My guess is they tone down any semblance of heat to accommodate tourists, which is understandable given their location, nevertheless it was disappointing given that the meal centered around chile as the burger topping. I will stick with steaks in the future, an item at which they truly excel, given that they really can't deliver on the New Mexican food side of cuisine."}, {"review_id": "GY4JvuTvT-x5xLoIUsS92A", "user_id": "o_HpgN3AqAyhKAWXwmut4w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/20/2017", "text": "This restaurant gets four and a half stars for the ambiance/decor, service and especially the food.  We started with the green chile/cheese wontons with a pineapple dipping sauce.  It was delicious.  I ordered the filet mignon with scallops.  The steak was cooked to perfection as well as the scallops.  My friend ordered the filet (cod) with a chorizo sauce (could have been a little more flavorful).  The filet, however, was cooked perfectly and the fish just flaked off delicately.  I ordered the Key Lime White Chocolate dessert and I was extremely pleased.  My friend ordered the crème brulee and that was equally good."}, {"review_id": "frR5ci9jRXwJSgnd-yyafA", "user_id": "EwpRMfl0tkIQWZAxtsxkEw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/24/2017", "text": "This restaurant reminds me of the inside of the Haunted Mansion where the ghosts dance  around and over the long dining table.   I think the restaurant is overpriced for food quality but it appears to be one of the 'nicest' in the area by means of some sort of ambiance.  It's very dimly lit inside (leaning towards dark..dancing ghosts!) which makes it a great place for a quiet or romantic date night.  Esp since all the restaurants in the area are brightly lit without any sort of ambiance.  I had the Scampi and the serving of them was impressive!  The waiter did a flambe at our table.  The shrimp (which were more like prawns) were good size but a little tough for $37.  The sides were 'meh'.   My friends/family enjoyed their dishes but weren't 'wowed' by them either.  We went back one Sunday for brunch and it was disappointing.  The long line for the one person making omelets meant the other food on our plate got cold before we got our omelet.  They REALLY need more than one person making custom omelets.  Service was 'meh'.  I had dropped my fork and after waiting what seemed like 10-minutes (but likely was less) without seeing a server, I went and took a set off another table.  Took a long time for refills, water, etc. and from all appearances, the servers weren't that busy as they seemed to have time to chat in the alcoves.  Wasn't a fan of kids in the buffet area unsupervised sticking their fingers in the desserts but that's not the restaurants fault.  Or maybe it is?  Perhaps having someone in the area to watch over and guide kids back to their parents would be helpful.*In my original review I said there was nothing special about their meat.  I am so happy to learn it is local, hormone free, organic, humanely raised, etc.  Farm to table is easily worth the price!  So perhaps I'll give this place another go & next time, I'll have the meat!"}, {"review_id": "pE11a314GFh3o3CEM-smEA", "user_id": "M0bSHaAusJ1UJaRZtMuI4A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/16/2017", "text": "This was on my must stop when in town list. Last trip was less than satisfactory. First was told no seating for us, yet restraunt was empty, and because I refused to sit in the secondary restraunt suddenly there was a table.  Food was great, service was below par. One of my family members hurt herself while sitting on the antique chair and was barely offered ice. Nothing was offered for the physical pain suffered while dining, no one ever came to check on our table.  Biggest disappointment for $200 for 3 adults and 1 kid. Would not recommend unless you can play the part of a wealthy patron, sadly looks can be deceiving.

The rooms, portraits, décor is all spectacular.  Each room is different from the next.  Its got one of the most beautiful bars I've seen.  Truly, you walk in thinking you are gonna see one thing and its like entering one of those magic harry potter rooms where you have to look behind you to make sure you are seeing correctly (yep, used a harry potter reference.  Been waiting for that moment).  Ok all that being said, for 30 bucks you get the sunday buffet with limitless mimosas.  This is a solid value for a high end buffet.  You may be wondering why only 3 stars.  Well, because while there is a lot to like, I was fairly underwhelmed with the food options.  The day we went there was a lot of green chili, which I love, but I noticed my table was sticking  to a couple areas (green chili enchilidas, green chili alfredo pasta, etc).  I just didn't think the range of eye popping options was there.  They did have an omelette station that I would try in the future and the dessert options were fantastic (really good cheese cake and blueberry tarts).  All in all, a very nice establishment and one worth checking out.  But prolly not one you are going to cross state lines for on the reg."}, {"review_id": "sMtKqWPGnHr3L1a4wpK3oA", "user_id": "n3BP5xQB4IYpMd2j60HOeg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/10/2017", "text": "Great experience, wonderful atmosphere with plentiful portions of good food served by friendly attentive staff.

I wanted to do that again for Valentine's day. I checked their menu online it showed they still had it so I called for reservations specifically for double eagle for 8pm. They even required a credit card to hold my reservations. What? I have never had a resturant ask for that but he explained they get stood up.  So I surprised my hubby of 28 years with cards balloons and took him for nice dinner. But when we arrived i felt stood up they sat us in peppers stating they had no room in double eagle and furthermore the chateaubriand is not offered on special occasions. Huge fail. Ordered chicken it was aweful and overpriced so dissatisfied and disappointed. Won't be back. Several other couples around us had the same difficulty. Honestly would have been the best policy. If they had told me up front about seating I still may have chosen to go or maybe not but I would still be a customer.
