Good value at $8 for a large too. Bathroom was clean. You have to get your own bottled water which is strange. The pho came out very fast. She forgot my lychee bubble tea order. Good place of a little odd. I think I will be back though. The beef entree at another table looks good too."}, {"review_id": "8dBqIqbUk59kkgT8kPk2pg", "user_id": "eZARgB7EwzAUuWb2DAnf7Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Great little hidden gem... genuine Vietnamese cuisine. Had the pork/shrimp wrapped in rice paper and the shredded chicken and rice noodles with beef broth. Both were delicious! Put the house made hot sauce on everything. First time having Vietnamese coffee... very good. Highly recommended stopping in for the food. If you're expecting service with a smile and sparkly clean atmosphere... not the place for you. Location is not the best. The inside looks like one of those food network back alley places these guys stop in and get the best food. Great food... stop by and try it out"}, {"review_id": "iHfNLKxagyadZCPSBHdXbA", "user_id": "macaPR3J2QjLXjsVZByZaw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "I did take-out of two different Pho, and a couple of other things.

The clientele was a mix of Caucasian and African American, unlike the crowd of mostly Asians eating at Pho Hong Thom down the street. The beef pho hit the spot, with plenty of fresh bean sprouts, Thai basil, and delicious broth, but I had to approach the kitchen to re-request my tapioca tea (with black pearls - interesting!). There was no, \"How is everything?\" second visit.  Visually I'm still bothered by the detritus in the baseboard radiator and the crooked and dusty front window blind.  How would a health inspector have reacted? But as mama always says, feed a cold, so it worked for me."}, {"review_id": "cV16-aTey9eRLd3p8dGJHA", "user_id": "94mBRau-6S7bjouSmhlBOg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/13/2017", "text": "Pho Saigon in Bridgeport, CT is located in what looks like an old house. The inside is bare -- nothing special, however, the food here is excellent. Very very excellent.The bad: The service here needs some serious help. No one at this store was friendly at all, no smiles, nothing. I don't need to be pampered, but a simple hello at any point in conversation with a waiter/waitress is good for business.Tip: come here expecting 0 friendly service and you won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "iNQB_wQJB7A1Dw0zQAiCBw", "user_id": "JVv_ffjr6_2UUBdInlffbg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "I don't really want to tell anyone about this place. I don't want a lot of people to know how great this restaurant is. The food, service and price cannot be beat. My reasons for not sharing this place is because #1 parking is a problem. #2 I don't want it to lose its quality and it's consistency. #3 I prefer going there and to other spots in little Asia without crowds.

I had a huge bowl of delicious pho with seafood, and ridiculously cheap bubble tea. I cannot recommend this wonderful 'hole in the wall' enough. Yes, it is in a less pretty corner of Bridgeport and the decor is basic. But the food simply shines. My taste buds are still recovering! If I could give it extra stars I would. The food is incredibly fresh,  and the kitchen is spotlessly clean. You don't have to ask for utensils, there is an Eastern and Western variety right there on the table, a huge plus for me as I hate having to ask for an extra fork if needed. The pho comes with a side plate of add ons such as bean sprouts and lime. The bubble tea is by far the best I have tasted, and TWO DOLLARS. Go! You will not be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "tgZsO3gwN0iW1OVsWZIdDw", "user_id": "Ld2RbaUQGVNz7a5q-qJIKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We came back here again on our road trip!!!

You have to go to the counter to order, by the way. We didn't know so we waited at least 10 min before any of the staff even saw we were there. We also bought water thinking they didn't serve it (kinda dumb on our part for not asking first I guess, there wasn't anyone around to even ask ). When someone did finally come to take our order, not only was the service unfriendly, no words were spoken to us in response at all. We ordered banh xeo as an appetizer. We both got vermicelli with pork, shrimp, and spring rolls. The appetizer is not flavorful except for the dipping sauce that comes with it. It was really starchy and not fully cooked in certain parts of it. The vermicelli should have been pretty standard. My sister was served partly raw pork and she realized only later into the meal. It was pretty mediocre and it was one of those \"I wish I didn't have to keep eating this\" meals. We usually went to the place next door but wanted to try this place out of curiosity. Sadly, we are not coming back here again..."}, {"review_id": "mvPj6pI62AwvuUY9vvqPbg", "user_id": "-c9k-kw4XuBV7-4_NV7wBg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "This whole in the wall has some of the best Vietnamese pho.

Even worse, the waitress was standing right there as I jumped up. She did not even flinch. The roach didnt faze her. So its also telling me something else. This place is disgusting.

We went there to eat in however I had to get back to work so we ordered take out. My hubby goes crazy over their Vietnamese style coffee. I'm not a cold coffee person but I should say that it was good. My hubby told me that they make their coffee with condensed milk. It was good. We got the seafood noodle soup and the rare brisket noodle soup. Both soups were good and soothing. It is a very small restaurant and it was packed when we visited. That indicates that their food is really good. Will be going back again for a calm dinner so that we can enjoy the ambience as well."}, {"review_id": "a9QUdHKJ2I33mPLirO-Xxg", "user_id": "N5JwGTpOGYvufX9JaLd9sQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/11/2017", "text": "This is the best Vietnamese Restaurant in the State.   The food is fresh hot and delicious.   You can't beat the servings or price!"}, {"review_id": "2BIPvuC_tQhVqaRoNHbNew", "user_id": "Lqw3oZJB54kRSdZgh4uFEw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/15/2016", "text": "Best Vietnamese food around in fairfield county.
