I was attracted to the place because of the oxtail dumplings and it did not disappoint me! My hubby and I ordered the appetizer sampler, meat trio ramen (I think that is the name but it had pot roast, ox tail and pork belly = yummy!!) and bibimbap. Everything - I mean EVERYTHING- was delicious, so flavorful and the meat was tender. The dishes were a perfect twist on traditional Asian food.As a warning, Chinatown is very trendy. Be prepared to pay for parking or walk far. We arrived at 5:30 and the restaurant was empty. We left aft 7pm and there was a line to get seated. I highly recommend making a reservation! Additionally, the staff was super friendly. I wished I was more of a sake fan because they had a good selection and even had a sample trip!Thanks for the experience! Definitely a must try!"}, {"review_id": "5E2pykqRNaultntM05PkEQ", "user_id": "kNJ5t0z3Rxi3tvGlxR4vAQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Finally got to try this place out.. I admit I've been hesitant in coming here for dinner because I heard the wait can be long.  Anyways, today I went here for lunch with a couple friends.  It was smaller than expected inside but it was clean and cozy :) I got the plantation iced tea (perfect sweetness), and an order of the pork belly bao to go because I knew my fiancé would like it.  I had 1, and while I hate too much fat on my meat, the fatty pork belly meshed well with the bao, pickled cucumber, and most importantly, the delicious hoisin sauce. For my entree I got the lucky bowl with no bean sprouts.  The ramen noodles were cooked perfectly and I love the wakame that came with it.  However, the broth was very salty that I couldn't enjoy just sipping the broth by itself.  Also, while my egg was delicious, the inside was cold, so it was a little weird eating hot ramen with a slightly cold egg lolOne thing that definitely bumped my review up to 4 stars is the service.  The service was friendly, they refilled my plantation tea without me asking, and they were kind enough to pack my ramen noodles separately from the broth so it wouldn't be soggy when I ate it later.Overall, this place was pretty good.. and I'd like to come back to try the oxtail dumplings :)"}, {"review_id": "lecYzj7uMxHKQotUpt0QLg", "user_id": "ptEPYx4cML2dsmdFyfUw9A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Everyone always talks about this place so we figured we would try it out. We decided on the sampler Dim Sum Trio that came with the oxtail dumplings, pork bao, and lobster shu mai. The oxtail dumplings were so good that everything else was just ok. We could have just ordered them all night, they were amazing. For our entree we got the Bi Bim Bob. It was cooked perfectly. The meat was tender and picked vegetables were great. The only thing we would say about it is that there just wasn't enough but there was a lot of rice left over. We did feel a little rushed by our server. We mentioned that we might get more but the check was presented to us anyway. Then she kept checking on it even when we still had some of our cocktail. Grabbing it when it wasn't ready. She was nice but it was just awkward. Our dinner was only a little over an hour.  Overall we enjoyed everything and will be back to try more."}, {"review_id": "s1OE8rv77jkxCOFoe9RaFg", "user_id": "PN_TA5PO9WI7LZjUNFS1YQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "I finally got to try the infamous Lucky Belly!

It was actually my first date spot a while back but we keep coming back! it's always been amazing. Today we got the oxtail dumpling, bibimbop, and the lucky bowl ramen. Everything was super delicious. The oxtail dumpling has such a generous amount of meat inside. Also one serving comes with 3 dumplings but they ask you if they want to add one more to make it even among the two people to share which is very thoughtful. The only thing is it's in downtown so parking could be hard. Luckily we went late about 8pm and we found street parking. But otherwise we park at the municipal parking for very cheap at night. The service was okay today we had to ask for straws 4 times, but the workers all seem very happy and nice and they were nice to each other helping others when busy so that was nice. One server dropped the glass and it shattered all over the floor but everyone came to help and cleaned it up very fast."}, {"review_id": "kzdNtK8GAYIl2VR25bANXw", "user_id": "9g6Rh3rA5iUcxi6pGU8Q_w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Lot's of street parking this time of night. Walked in at 8:30pm. Greeted by the host and got seated right away. Nice cozy atmosphere, only half the restaurant filled. Started off with green tea and a special set of appetizers. It came with lobster shu mai, pork belly bao, and oxtail dumplings. There were two of each for $25.00.  Each had it's own unique taste. Favoring the pork belly bao which just melted in your mouth with every bite. Oxtail dumplings had a lot of flavor with a nice soft texture. I really didn't care for the Lobster Shu Mai much. The lobster didn't taste as fresh as normally is. Then we ordered 2 Lucky Bowls at $12 each one and the other had the same fixings as the fungi bowl with Shiitake mushrooms and vegetables added $6.00 totaling to $18. The broth was good almost like a tan tan soup base. I added a little spicy oil to give a little kick to it.The waiter and waitresses was really attentive and made sure we were ok."}, {"review_id": "YpRxOnLqGFy_rzsglmb_rQ", "user_id": "iCYMf_sHRevmzWg8la-LVw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "I remember ramen being delicious in Hawaii, and Lucky Belly did not disappoint!

It was packed, but we were seated at the communal table. Service was quick and friendly, but unfortunately that evening they were out of two appetizers we were very excited to try- the duck wontons and the oxtail dumplings. I ordered the belly bowl which had pork belly and sausage, and my friends ordered the beast bowl which was all beef (the oxtail wontons were great.) everything was delicious and unique and well portioned. For cocktails, I had the matcha cocktail with sake, and my friend had the gin based one. Both were beautiful and very delicious. The pricing for ramen was fair, but it is pretty pricey for the entrees and appetizers, and the portions for those aren't great. For $15, 4 pieces of wonton or 3 pork belly bao is overpriced for the size of the food, but it all looked very tasty.

This was definitely not the case here! We ordered 4 appetizers and 4 entrees so we could sample the local, unique, fusion eats. They brought out each item as an experience in its own, and by the time the entrees came out we were not only glad that we didn't order 1 per person, but also worried we wouldn't be able to finish them! Lamb lumpia - amazing and unique, pork buns - delicious, inari with scallop? Hard to discern the inari and a bit expensive, but super interesting flavor nonetheless. The ramen bowl was unique and flavorful, not the best bowl of ramen ever but it can hang, and I thought it paired nicely with everything else. The chicken salad was great as well. All in all, I don't think this place can do anything wrong, would have loved to switch it up and go for drinks!"}, {"review_id": "snuaoLI4B_6fv8tVrfVDxg", "user_id": "0--tA2UFw38eGhliSXhkoA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/13/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Just had to drop them down a few stars since I asked for veggie broth for the pho and it's $3 extra.  This has actually happened a few other times causing me to choose a salad or something else.  IT'S RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!

Yet, my first visit there was unplanned. A friend and I happened to be in the area and were looking for a good dinner option. Since it was a cooler night--and I hadn't been to Lucky Belly yet--she suggested there. Since it was around 6 p.m. on a Thursday evening, it was actually nice and quiet during our visit. That was my first time in the restaurant, and I was surprised by how small it was on the inside. No wonder it usually fills up quickly! By the time we were leaving, though, more of the tables had filled up. But this was the perfect spot for catching up, without having to yell because of a loud interior.Our server was helpful in making recommendations. I also ordered a glass of sparkling wine. Too bad there were no happy hour deals here, but the featured appetizer special of the night--it was a sampler with the bao buns, lobster shumai and something else for $25--sounded pretty good. It didn't take long for our food to come out, and I definitely look forward to my next visit. Here's what we got:Pork Belly Bao: This appetizer features three petite bao sandwiches filled with tender pork belly, sake hoisin and pickled cucumbers. Our server told us that, if we wanted to share, this appetizer, we could add an extra bao to make the number even. But, I ended up ordering this as my entrée. I had been craving pork belly bao for a while, and I was happy that I finally got my hands on a good one. The pork belly pieces were juicy and tender, and they don't skimp on the pork portions here. The buns were nice and soft, yet slightly chewy. I think my favorite part of this entrée, though, had to be that sake hoisin. It was thick and flavorful, and I loved dipping the pork belly in it. Crab and Avocado Stack: I was not about to order salad as my entrée, since I had been wanting to come here for a long time, but this salad choice did sound appealing. It comes with a shiso-tomato gazpacho. I love both crab and avocado, so if I were coming here for lunch and wanted something lighter, maybe I'd give this a try. Shrimp Kim Chee Bowl: Our server recommended this ramen, and my friend ended up getting it. It features togarashi shrimp and housemade kim chee. All ramen bowls are served with bean sprouts, wakame, sesame seeds, green onions, ginger and a soft egg. My friend really likes spicy food, so she was really pleased with this dish. She said it was definitely spicy--and the broth in her bowl was really red--but she said all the ingredients were flavorful and the combination of everything made this dish work well. She especially liked that housemade kim chee. Belly Bowl: If I did order ramen during my visit, this is the one I would get. It includes pork belly, bacon and sausage. I love the pork belly here, and bacon and sausage are some of my other favorites. I would just order my ramen without green onions and bean sprouts, but I definitely look forward to having that soft-boiled egg in it."}, {"review_id": "fqZKBe3JqlpYU0ao9AxS3g", "user_id": "MKyMO6aRnSd191iUA8B_iQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Really overrated.

For mains, we tried the pork belly ramen, one of the salads, the chicken sandwich, and the special for the day (bento box). They were good as well, but not as delicious as the apps. Liliko fizz was also a tasty refreshment. Service was top-notch. So so friendly and attentive. Overall great lunch spot (though parking in Chinatown is a bit of a pain!

Lucky Belly popped up and I'll​ admit I was a ​bit skeptical about the four and a half star reviews, I mean is it really that good? I decided to give it a chance. Parking was a bit of a hassle but hey that's​ China town for you and you will experience​ that in every China Town across America, I highly recommend​ that if you are a woman meeting up with someone alone please be careful walking around, I couldn't imagine being in that situation without someone. I made sure to call ahead and made a reservation since I heard the place gets super busy. As soon as we were seated we where told about the trio appetizer special which wasn't​ on the menu. It contained two pieces of three selected popular appetizer. First was the pork bao, the meat was buttery and melted in your mouth and the oyster​ sauce wasn't​ enough we wanted more it was so good. The second​ was the lobster and pork shumai with chunks of lobster meat inside, the shumai​ pieces were huge. The last and star of the show was the oxtail dumpling, I was in heaven with the first bite, a mouthful of all that tender meat, I would have​ ordered twenty of them if it was allowed. For the ramen, ​we both ordered the Lucky Bowl just to have something simple and savory. Lucky belly knows how to make some good broth cause the broth was so creamy and savory with a hint of nuttiness to it. I tried so hard to finish the whole bowl but it was so much I couldn't​, the egg was cooked perfectly and the noodles were great. Yes, ​they may not have the best ramen in Hawaii but the reason I gave this place five stars is that​​ of the impeccable​ customer service we received​. There wasn't a moment we weren't​ checked on by different staff members, my water was never close to being empty and a different person asked us each time if we needed anything. You can really tell that the servers enjoy their work and it shows ​the amazing service."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/lucky-belly-honolulu?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
