You have to try these. The Brussels sprouts are made with a sweet chile sauce and peanuts. It sounds weird but trust me, you'll thank me later. They are so delicious. Another favorite is the Po' Bao. These are fried oysters served in a small steamed bun dressed with a creole aioli, lettuce, tomato and pickle slice. These are just two of my favorites on a very safisticated yet fun menu. The drinks are also tasty and the atmosphere is really nice."}, {"review_id": "gRx_zGIE5Xu1jhSCAN_F3A", "user_id": "izdoRybAthDrhWBqc_16lQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/28/2017", "text": "This is a difficult 3 stars. I'm a big fan of the atmosphere and really liked being here. Who knew an elementary school converted into a restaurant could be so cool? The service was great and the the dishes looked fantastic. What ultimate lead this to 3 stars instead of higher is how that fantastic looking food actually tasted.The three of us had their Broiled Oysters, Chicken Biscuits, Scotch Egg and Grits, Shrimp Po'Boy, and Skillet Cornbread. As noted, everything looked great, but fell pretty flat when it came to flavor. The one exception was their Chicken Biscuits, those were mighty tasty. Everything else though was pretty weak and disappointing. I wouldn't say that anything was bad per se, just average at best. The cornbread was pretty dry too. The coffee was ok.The disappointment in the food aside, I would easily come back here again and give them another shot. I would order nothing we already had again, other than the Chicken Biscuits, so I'd be eager to see if other items on the menu fare any better."}, {"review_id": "qZI-2mJ1KLVSNyT0q5lNSQ", "user_id": "8cHOXyA9c_Ac0NKqab9Rgw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/28/2017", "text": "Lorena Duling School opened its doors in 1927, with multiple expansions and alterations in the following decades. Today the historic building is home to several businesses, including Saltine.If you've never been, have a navigator with you and keep a look out. It's at the top of a small hill along the road, hidden by mature trees and with a relatively small sign. You might be able to park along the road, but there's a good chance you'll have to park across the street.Walking in, the vibe is immediately historic and sleek and cool, all at the same time. While semi hidden away to newbies, the place is clearly well known to locals. It's worth seeking out for sure!Touted as an oyster bar, it is that... but as a non-oyster eater, there are plenty of other great options. And let's not forget the bar part. As a whiskey fan, the bar immediately drew me in. While not an extensive whiskey collection, they have an excellent selection, including some hard-to-get stuff. And what's this? Heather! Heather and I talked whiskey for a while. LOVE finding someone who loves talking whiskey and knows their stuff. Talk to Heather if you want to talk whiskey. Their beer selection was also excellent. Thanks for the whiskey love, Heather!!The calamari and corn bread starters were super yummy. Everyone loved them. I went with the snapper for dinner, and it was also super duper fly. Cooked on the half-shell, it came with a sweet and sour sauce - not what I expected but totally worked - and 4 new (or red) potatoes. If I hadn't had appetizers, I might have wished for more potatoes, but it was perfect with appetizers. Oh, and Kaylee took treat care of us at our table. :)Groovy bar and excellent dining experience. This place is a gem. Check it out!"}, {"review_id": "Vy65ibjQ7ZLSoiIbSbyJKg", "user_id": "aXUTHuW3Ajaqu2TdkA3Qmg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/22/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This is a sad and tragic review to write. Today's trip to Saltine was less than spectacular bordering on bad. The Nashville hot chicken was cold and oddly small served with a few halves of stale and lifeless not Bunny bread. Just four measly food service grade  chicken fingers - what happened to the glorious Nashville hot chicken dish of yesteryear. Sigh. The quiche was served cold too... and on a hot to the touch piece of mismatched old dinnerware. Odd. The server was friendly, but by the time the cold quiche on a hot plate made it to the table, my companion had polished off his entree. Odd. Life is hit or miss sometimes. This was a miss. Three stars only because this hopefully will be an isolated bad experience at what had been out go to restaurant. Sigh."}, {"review_id": "bnUKeh_J7uVt16h6oErWbA", "user_id": "RYgEjvdLAr6gyroXiqeTyw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "The food and service are always top notch!  The bar area is fabulous with great bartenders like Kam.  The oysters are always fresh and tasty!!  And YES !!

Beers vary in type but most are local or at least from the south. The food is southern and also has a flare of high end ouster bar with the bar constantly shucking oysters, preparing for orders. We ordered a few pints and even got to sample a few as well. We barely missed happy hour which ends at 7 so didn't save a $1 on the drinks. Our food order consisted of the shrimp boil half dozen, cup of gumbo, so po baos, and the crab avocado toast. The standouts were the gumbo with a rich flavor and the avocado toast which was a nice rendition on one of my go to brunch dishes. The book was a little bland in flavor but it did give us a chance to taste the fresh sausage and shrimp. Finally, the bao was a cool idea, but I don't see the southern and Japanese cuisines meshing as well as the chef intended. Everything needed more spice in my opinion but nothing some hot sauce can't cure. Overall, we had some good ipa and a good meal for about $65. The service wasn't the best at the bar, but all servers were able to help us if you got their attention. The bar area has a few TVs and plenty of seating and there is also an outdoor seating area during nice weather nights. Parking may be tricky on busy nights, but still this is one of the best spots in Jackson for good eats."}, {"review_id": "V3wUrTv6JJyMpQaknwtJYw", "user_id": "u8F7vszrS1P8RopNos2mhg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "The food was good.

I started off with a delicious Mimosa. For my meal I had brunchloaf. I have never heard of such a thing and thought it would be interesting. It was meatloaf, wrapped in bacon, with and egg on top.

Saltine occupies a retired city school grey-brick building in the Fondren community of Jackson, MS.   Inside, young married couples attempt to stare at each other but are often distracted.  They seem to have trouble juggling the responsibilities of parenthood and cell-phone ownership simultaneously.  Meanwhile at the bar, single hipsters stir cosmopolitans as the tenders spin drinks and as the lone shucker cracks clams and returns them to an icy bed.  Overall, it is quiet as after-school detention. You came here for oysters and your $12 is best spent on the citrus-butter half dozen.  Saltine pickles its own shallots and artfully places them artfully.  Your steamy reward comes complete (and as custom demands) with that elementary three-pronged fork.  It is on a bed of ice.  No cocktail.  Saltily sufficient and beautifully blackened--its rough crust gives way as you get to that balmy, squishy and grey interior.  Order the \"Double Saltine\" burger.  It comes with Duke's Mayo [Read: not Yankee Hellman's].    Pair it with the State's best fries.  A sloppy, meaty, and cheesy paste rests on an impossibly large salty and shoe-stringed plate of taters.  This mess resembles spaghetti more than anything else.  Me and my beautiful date laugh about how the  lunch-ladies at our middle school never cooked food this good.  The couples with kids have departed by now and only a few hipsters remain at the bar.  Detention was never this fun."}, {"review_id": "gPOtMtjckzAAFRCerewptw", "user_id": "0mbpZKwbdZTM0rhehWUodg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Place was nice, casual, cool.

(It's the one right above the mule). Get it! Get it! Get it! So refreshing and comforting at the same time. I enjoyed my lunch very much. My friend had the burger (double patty after discussing it with our waiter and he did not lead her wrong!) We had a good time catching up and just relaxing. Saltines was the perfect atmosphere for that. I thoroughly and wholeheartedly recommend it to any and everybody. I went in thinking of course I was going to get dessert but I left no room.
