I went to Hummus House for the first time on Thursday because I work nearby and figured I should try a place so highly rated. They def live up to their stars!! I ordered the hummus falafel panini which I wasn't sure I would like but now I never want to eat falafel in a regular pita. A thin pita is stuffed with greens, hummus, falafel, sauce, tomato and more and then grilled - holy moly. The place itself was small and PACKED. Granted I went at 12:15 so not sure what I expected but yeah. NO room at all. Good thing I ordered for pick up. Decor was cute though - vintage cameras on the shelves with beautiful vintage pictures of people (family? Friends? I don't know I'll ask next time). The portion was HUGE so I had the other half of my lunch for dinner. My 2yo loved it too, as evidenced by his obnoxious bite into the side of the wrap. Can't wait to go back and try more."}, {"review_id": "q-ui6OGciL42ZlFrWbm-DA", "user_id": "5KCfXaSgEMXQNHXIXtL27w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "I got food here a few weeks ago for pick up.

Went there in a group of three and people generally enjoyed the food. They demark the menu and terms of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan, which is kind of helpful. The owner told us there is a secret vegan menu, not quite sure why that was necessary. Hummus was good. \"Vegan\" cheeseburger automatically had mustard and pickles mixed deep within it, which I was not made aware of, and was kind of a disappointment, but as the others in our party enjoyed their meals I'm giving it a good review."}, {"review_id": "7O8Q1ONJS5zFrX5dJK4t4Q", "user_id": "JzBu3PhTYaAWXez6e5zPnw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "I'm in town on business and was looking for some good takeout to bring back to my hotel after a long day. I got the Big Gyro with lamb and it is delish. Portion size is very large as well. I ordered takeout thru the yelp app and my order was ready to go when I got there.

Try reading their menu with all the detailed descriptions. I had my choices all planned out when I walked in the door.It's on the corner in an old Victorian. What a wonderful addition to the neighborhood and to the Lehigh Valley. People want healthful and lighter food options with tons of flavor, and this fits the bill perfectly. There is also a photography motif inside with old classic cameras adorning the walls.They have vegan kibbee, whee! And spinach pies. And a brussels sprout burrito, and a cauliflower one. Of course, all the traditional stuff is there too, but they have a wonderful comfort touch with all their food. Just put that lemon tahini sauce all over everything please.The staff and owner are willing to chat and are extremely kind and friendly. They even have vegan creamer -- NO ONE remembers this detail. Pretty inside and out. They have thought of everything, and I wish them great success."}, {"review_id": "7Lfpaw2Ype4W8IOXD5sBcA", "user_id": "_7K9EdwZMq4EIRE46QAI3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "I've only been here three times.

When people ask me, \"you're a vegetarian - where can I eat in Allentown?\"  I always answer, \"Bethlehem!\"But - no more!Vegetarians, vegans, middle-eastern lovers, people who just love fresh-well crafted foods...unite! Rejoice! Dance the forbidden dances of your lands... Hummus House is the savior of Allentown!  Everything is fresh, simple ingredients, and they cater to special diets - just tell them what you eat/can't and they'll offer suggestions.Can I give it six stars?  Is that possible?I've never had a better falafel wrap.  Let me state the food here is not traditional Middle Eastern fare - it has a fresh and slightly gourmet twist to it all - and the portions are HUGE.  HUGE, I say.  But, if you're stuffing your face with fresh vegetables, and baked, not fried, goodness, then its A-ok!I guarantee that I will offer this place to everyone seeking dining in Allentown, and I will be back!  That is a promise."}, {"review_id": "aX7Y7bKdAs89JAmrXgXaKA", "user_id": "5Z6LDUvF7lz1q0B4nVuvng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2017", "text": "Walking into Hummus House is like walking into the warmth of a family kitchen. From the moment one walks in, the wonderful pungent aromas of garlic fill the air. That's how I know this is my kind of place! The family who runs this business makes the experience of patronizing it that much sweeter. They are kind and patient, and will explain any dish or ingredient on the menu with you in depth. They run the entire establishment, back and front end, and infuse everything they do with love.I'm vegetarian and Hummus House hands down makes the most delectable veggie sandwiches using creative recipes and spices that give my taste buds a blast of flavor. Considering this isn't a vegetarian only restaurant, they mark the spot on their veggie offerings and have many options to choose from on their menu. The sandwiches are hearty and layered with flavors reminiscent of old family recipes and spices that span the globe. I love their falafel cheese steak, a typical American staple with a Middle Eastern twist. Don't forget to order extra garlic sauce on the side if you're a garlic lover like me. This creamy sauce is made with just two ingredients: olive oil and garlic. If you need some clearing of the nasal passages, this will surely do the job.I will keep coming back to Hummus House to enjoy the delicious food and love from the family that runs this gem of an establishment."}, {"review_id": "Ij8277juxUfKmstn5dbT4w", "user_id": "KgMwMZFQdV886VJORVjRDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "Love the food atmosphere I felt like I was at home  So relaxed don't wanna go This is a place you must go back to at least once a week..lol"}, {"review_id": "1QTWdpa18wbCl4EWGC9qKQ", "user_id": "ks9cmbwaVHn40lP3fmF5TQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/2/2017", "text": "My wife and I just ate here for lunch and again great place to eat .
