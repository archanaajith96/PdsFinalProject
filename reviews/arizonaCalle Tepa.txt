One of the best Mexican restaurants we've ever eaten at in recent history!  My husband had the steak quesadilla was the best he's had ever (by far)! The steak was incredibly tender, flavorful and the right amount of delicious fat. The quesadilla itself was light and flaky almost as if it had been deep fried.My steak fajitas were equally delicious. I requested extra veggies and they didn't disappoint: bell peppers and onions galore. The rice and beans were so flavorful too! The staff was very warm and welcoming, smiling every time and willing to help with everything.Their salsa bar had loads of great homemade salsa and condiments (my husband is a condiment junkie and he was in absolute heaven here!). If you're looking for a great Tex-Mexican place to blow your mind: go to Calle Tepa!"}, {"review_id": "FHgVr5vEPPCnw1QswE9f7g", "user_id": "kYvJVnqfv_Vhq_Mp4G0LNg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Good portions Very limited meat choicesServers were nice, if not a bit rushed (maybe we just take too long to decide what we want but she visited us like 3 times before we had actually decided what we wanted.)Ordered : Chile relleno plate - this was very good. Cheese was melted- but it wasn't at that stringy consistency I die for. I liked the way it was breaded - not over kill but definitely was there. I also enjoyed the sauce they used. The rice and beans were also good. There was also like a garnish salad.Carne Asada burrito, wet (enchilada style as they say in these parts) - This was a miss for us. The meat was hard from being over cooked. Not horrible. The sauce saved it. Over all I'd return. They have fair prices.

There is indoor and outdoor seating.  The menu is posted on the wall as well as on a regular menu.  You order at the counter and get a number to put on your table where they will bring you the food.  Food came out fairly quickly.  They also have house-made tortillas packaged so that you can buy some to take with you if you want."}, {"review_id": "vw9Oqkvv9WWPXBoYopT25Q", "user_id": "BbMWvdd-56P6YZhMvo4Ysg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Very bland and boring.

I think I was a bit put off when I walked in and realized I had to order/pay in line and then be brought food. I assumed there was waiter service. I quickly got over that once the food was delivered. The BF and I have tried many items and have not been disappointed. I think the barbacoa is my favorite, along with the green salsa. My only gripe is an item I ordered was served in a paper boat, with paper wrapping. It wasn't easy to cut and got soggy fast. For the price, I'd like to have an actual plate.

I usually ate here ever 2 weeks or so. Last time I had eaten here a few months ago, and it was very disappointing. Everything was dried out, salsa was way too spicy to be enjoyable. I decided to return last week. And it was the same, everything was dried out, lacked flavor, salsa was unbearable spicy (I was at least prepared this time and mixed some mild salsa until I could handle the heat) but it broke my heart. I don't think I will be back.

Heading into Tucson on the way back to Phoenix, a friend and I stopped at Calle Tepa for some good Mexican food--and that's exactly what we got! I ordered a taco salad (yes they even have the crunch taco shell bowl to hold in the salad!) with chips and horchata. CT has some amazing salsas that are free with your side of chips. My personal favorite was the habanero salsa, creamy orange in color and fire on the tastebuds! The horchata was delicious, but the best part of the meal was the barbacoa on my taco salad. I'm used to barbacoa at Chipotle so obviously this was a huge upgrade. Delicious food that won't empty your wallet--that's what I call a good spot for food, and Calle Tepa certainly is one of those."}, {"review_id": "m6jNgYOxtU-eswYiFLXKCw", "user_id": "_m919WzyaQAE4a5c8l5Rwg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "So good!This is place is such a hidden gem I feel!

The flavor of the tacos was perfect as well, tender, seasoned well but not too much.    No matter what you order, the servings are generous!   The staff is very warm and friendly, and always makes sure you have everything you need.     OK....The Tamales...DELICIOUS!!   All the subtle spices of the masa gently wrap around your tongue, and there really is no way to fully articulate how delicious the Tamales are.    There or two kinds of tamales, and I got one of each to go.   I have a weakness for green chiles....but honestly either one was EXCELLENT!    I am a hard sell when it comes to Mexican restaurants here...(because there are SO MANY), however Calle Tepa has found a good solid foundation."}, {"review_id": "wEcgdkgdd3YdhbQflAIZJw", "user_id": "_qbNXRPVC_WxE-P3cjdNNQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "I love Calle Tepa!  Great food, tasty drinks, but most importantly of all exceptional service!
