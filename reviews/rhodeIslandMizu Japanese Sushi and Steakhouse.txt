I got the chicken chicken hibachi and mai tai.......... The food is very good and the drinks are great....... The only complain I have is the waitresses looked extremely unhappy......

This is the best sushi restaurant in the area!  We typically get some of the following:Spicy Tuna Roll, Super Mizu Roll which is: Spicy tuna, spicy salmon, spicy yellowtail, salmon, tuna, yellowtail and avocadoTuna Lover Roll Inside: spicy tunaOutside: tuna, white tuna, and avocado.Dynamite Roll Lightly fried spicy tuna, avocado, yellowtail, and cream cheese with baked scallop and crabmeatSpicy Tempura Roll Spicy tuna and salmon, tempura style.The sashimi is also great too!We have also have gotten duck sandwiches there which are good on Asian bao and the pink dragon sushi roll (specials).We usually get mizu soup too!  Of course you can do hibachi which is good too! They also scorpian bowls that are good too! I do find it to be a little pricey,  but it's like the only sushi place in the area.  Staff is always friendly and you can also order online to pick up. The place never seems very busy, but their restaurant is nice and clean.   If you're in the mood for sushi and you're nearby you should check the place out.  Compared to others in the Cranston/Warwick area would say this is similar to Haruki regarding sushi rolls."}, {"review_id": "O0LnSLuPCgSwmkV3Y2oAvQ", "user_id": "YP7CmGeoRIkdy3uJHQZKyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "I frequent this place very often the food is always fresh and delicious and everybody is extremely hospitable.

I wanted noodles or rice instead.  I like that you can order online, but you have to sign up with a user name/password and I don't have time for that.  I ordered the shrimp fried rice and my friend ordered two sashimi rolls; yellow fin tuna and striped bass and of course an order of crab rangoon, or what they call \"cheese crab.\"  The order was ready within the specified time (15 minutes) and I was happy with my decision.  Sometimes fried rice can be too greasy and stuck together, but this was freshly made with nice big prawns, and a good number of them too; it had a really nice flavor. I'd definitely order from Mizu again, or even dine in there, to try more items from their menu."}, {"review_id": "AlZuHHi6C4rJhjY3ece7QQ", "user_id": "bU8t4OZ8pDJawFlpCGgkMQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Worst service ever. Made an 8 o clock reservation waited at the front door for 10 minutes. No one came over. Finally got sat a hibachi table and waited one hour never got our appetizer sat with a scorpion bowl.

The service was great as well as their recommendations for their special Rolls. I loved their twist on their sashimi pizza. It is a Korean pancake with seaweed salad and sashimi on top. Very good! The atmosphere was great and their choice of music. They have lots of tvs by the bar to watch sports.

They have all of your favorite Japanese and Asian Fusion dishes. Their hibachi dishes are on point and you get alot of food for the price. I have not sat at one of the tables but I imagine the show is just as a good as the food. Their sushi is also very good and they have a nice selection of specialty rolls. They have a bunch of different dishes that run the realm of Asian cuisine from General Tso's to pad thai. On top of this, their cocktail selection is worth a trip in itself. They have sake, scorpion bowls, other delightful cocktails, and assorted domestic and Asian beers. These are all for very inexpensive prices for alcohol. Give it a shot you will definitely not leave hungry!"}, {"review_id": "hOpfiOcztQ6fWgMYVpqzeQ", "user_id": "znkhcgF_ypYVW5nVu2mlQg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "Been here for the hibachi several times.

He starts off with lighting torches on fire and throwing them (around not at people) Than he cracks and egg and smashed it making fried rice. Let me just say I loved it even though I don't like rice. Then he tossed vegetables into our mouths, I didn't catch any =(. Then The food came it was so good.

When we walked in, we were told that the wait for hibachi was so long that we should just order a sit-down meal, as they only had one hibachi chef on duty and we would've had to wait for two other tables to be served. As we really wanted hibachi, we waited. They served us our soup and salad so we weren't absolutely starving.Waiting turned out to be a good idea. Our chef was super personable and very funny. As we were the only people at our table, he wanted to know where we were from/what we did today/how we found the restaurant. Sometimes you don't get that at hibachi restaurants so it was much appreciated. In addition, the food was absolutely delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good food! :) The only thing that people should look out for: parties of 5 have an added gratuity to their bill."}, {"review_id": "DgmQFWPPr_qr0wtoaDWszQ", "user_id": "KsKPZ2OLsDARRVccWIEuvQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "Went on New Years Eve.  They lost our reservation along with multiple others, were very rude and blamed us for the error.  Had us sit and wait for an opening however there were lots of empty seats.  We left when another customer told us they waited over 45 mins just to get drinks and half their party left, went to a restaurant 20 mins away and had drinks before these folks."}, {"review_id": "42G1Fuf3L16AJszZi2oHhQ", "user_id": "iAMOkgtgK00jQ-Rabc_BoA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/26/2017", "text": "My friends and I came here during New Year's weekend.
