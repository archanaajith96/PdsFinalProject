This is my favorite restaurant in Green Bay right now. They have a great vibe (sit upstairs). It is a very warm atmosphere and often have live music on Saturday nights which is a great touch. The food is always amazing! The flavors are always great. The kobe meatloaf is fantastic. I've never had anything but delicious meals here. I've also had the loaded tots, lobster Mac and cheese, ahi tuna, and other things I can't remember right now haha GO HERE. You will not be disappointed. You must try the lemon butter cake for dessert."}, {"review_id": "CveNclGTgLAcmlGkQSNkIA", "user_id": "XYMxRy8mOR66LFZbMohPdQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "We stopped here on a Wednesday evening as a birthday treat from my fiance. Reservations were not needed.Atmosphere: The inside is very dark, quiet, and romantic. This is not a place to come and get smashed with your friends. On Wednesday's they have a special where you can get half off certain bottles of wine. The parking situation is bleh. The lot in the back was full due to the overflow of customers at the new AYCE sushi place next door. It was quite a hike to get there from where we parked. Service: The host/hostess station was occupied the entire time we were there. Which I admire, having someone greet you adds a personal touch vs. standing around awkwardly looking for someone. Very friendly and personable server. She made us feel important and the timing between the dishes was perfect. It was a 2 hour experience doing the 3 course offering, but was so much fun that it felt like 30 minutes. Food:  I had the grilled avocado and burrata salad and my fiance had the lobster bisque. The lobster bisque was fantastic, zero complaints there. The salad I felt would have been better off if they would have made it seasonal (for the acidity component)? Maybe some currants vs. a tomato (which is way out of season and had no flavor). We also received an amuse bouche from the chef that was playful and something we didn't expect.  For entrees I ordered the sea scallops and my fiance ordered the pork chop. My fiance's dish was flawless, from the potatoes to the pork to the vegetables, everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I struggled with a few things on my entree, they only seared one side of the sea scallops, the lobster risotto was overcooked and luke warm(I think you can expect that at most restaurants though because who has time to make risotto to order when it takes roughly 25-30 minutes to make a great risotto so they most likely parcooked it ahead of time). The cranberry gastrique was more of a puree? It had an off putting texture to it. Almost like a chunky ketchup. We ordered the newest dessert on the menu, caramel cheesecake with an almond crust. ZERO complaints about that dish, I would eat that as my dessert for every meal if my waistline was okay with it. We were stuffed so we had the ultimate brownie to go. It was just as delicious, almost a fudge like consistency.This will be a place we keep in mind going forward for celebrations and special occasions."}, {"review_id": "PKvGqOc_vWWXWVAIA0x8Tw", "user_id": "2okJkbOmIOE8d8pa15QHmQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Good food.  Creative presentations. For example, Ceasers salad: a bundle of cut fresh romaine lettuce standing on end held together with a ribbon made of a thinly sliced cucumber.  Gorgeous. The end of the bundle held a thick layer of dressing.Challenging to have a uniformly dressed salad this way though.  The mushrooms risotto was fine, but I like mine a little more al dente and maybe less cheesy.The sorbet, especially the Cactus Pear was delicious.Among the best service and attention to customers."}, {"review_id": "DfylX1zpieWre_1YhkCAVQ", "user_id": "704FCmH3QryfTyBqZkofQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/24/2017", "text": "One of my top go to places in Green Bay. Their food is art. Chef Tony is the most personable, talented chef I haveever interacted with---I have never met another chef who works like him. I hope they stay in Green Bay forever and we are really lucky to have a daring chef like Tony who brings us the latest and greatest and pushes the envelope--taking calculated risks while truly evaluating and taking note of his customers reactions...he is constantly reinventing the menu and goes above and beyond to give his customers what they want. The three course menu is an amazing value. Every plate they hand you is more beautiful than the next, sometimes looks too good to even put in your mouth. The lemon butter cake TAKES the CAKE. Chefusion is and my go-to place for girls night with mom. Whether we sit up or downstairs we always leave 100% satisfied. Their catering is also fabulous. I am absolutely in love with the venison entree they have seasonally and cannot wait to get back there for it this winter. The specials are always spot on. Anyone looking for outside the box, big city flavor in small town Green Bay---get there now! If you like boring traditional fare---stay home!"}, {"review_id": "w7Z8cv_CNy1sZH-2uqs3BA", "user_id": "qc-TFwkaiQN4b7QfJslWEw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/10/2017", "text": "My boyfriend and I are your true millennials (per a college survey) that we spend most of our money on food, which is true! We've been knocking restaurants off of our bucket list and this was one we've heard lots of good things about Chefusion! We get there about 20 minutes before our scheduled reservation time and we're pleasantly surprised when told we could be seated right away to enjoy a cocktail before dinner. I ordered the Soup de jour and wasn't quite sure what it was but it was delicious! Thank you chef! Appetizer was AMAZING, we tried the artisan cheese sampler! We were able to try quite a few things we've never experienced before! Main course was awesome for both of us! Delivered with elegance and tasted as good as it looked! However, I must admit our waiter was slacking, was not timely with our drinks, or silverware, and napkins. Often I would turn around and see him leaning over and talking at the cash register. Millennial Foodies love good food but we also still enjoy respectable waiters... just because we are young does not mean we don't care, we are still spending the money everyone else is as well :)"}, {"review_id": "VvN65_1pjM0xdEpfLnKVbg", "user_id": "IRf9CTxaubDbphsHS2dV-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/11/2018", "text": "My favorite restaurant in Green Bay.

The atmosphere was very unique and different. They had a very extensive menu filled with a lot of things that sounded very good. Our food was very good, although it came out at weird times. Our service was very attentive and good for the most part. Our server was always looking to up-sell, which got old after a while. He also forgot about us as he got more tables. It took about 15 minutes to order desserts to-go after we got the dessert menu and then about another 15 minutes for them to come out incorrectly on plates. The ending of the meal didn't really make me want to come back especially for the price you are paying."}, {"review_id": "Hy_Ab0ob34XclrcyUAxn0Q", "user_id": "ztZyzGepxhTqLSjOBJPEOQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/14/2017", "text": "I wish I could give this place 8 stars, it's really that good!The restaurant is gorgeous on the inside, definitely a fine dining experience. Each setting has a silver charger that really matches the tones throughout the restaurant.The waiter was honestly the best waiter I've had. Very knowledgeable on the menu, made fantastic recommendations, and took such great care of us. He was genuinely interested in what we were out doing that night, he boxed up courses for us we couldn't finish, and held them at the front so they didn't sit at our table. He deserved every penny of his $60 tip. Seriously. Outstanding.The food? Unghhhh. Just thinking about it makes me feel warm and fuzzy. The seafood was cooked to perfection, not overdone, but full of flavor. The steak was done medium rare as requested and melts in your mouth. The creme brule was the best one I've ever had, garnished with peanut brittle, a strawberry and homemade whipped cream.There's no way you will leave this place hungry. And you'll definitely want to come back."}, {"review_id": "XLE217kNvjlrS0cUXNfhpQ", "user_id": "_68U0qQFLqBdjAAPgz3VuQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/20/2017", "text": "My wife and I took advantage of the opportunity to go to one of our favorite eateries in the Green Bay area!

I would recommend the dynamite shrimp.

The valet parking made me feel better since I was alone and didn't know where to park. It was restaurant week and I didn't have a reservation, but they seated me upstairs at the bar. It is a beautiful historic building & decor. I felt a bit under dressed but they said I was fine. The special restaurant week menu was a 3 course meal for $32. I started with the Summer Chopped Salad - the candied pecans made it special. Next course was the 4oz Filet Mignon & 3 jumbo Shrimp, fingerling potatoes & Marsala Demi - delicious. For my 3rd treat, I selected their recommended house favorite, the Lemon Butter Cake. They normally offer a 3 course meal for $45, so I felt like I won the lottery with this recommendation.

The prices are an incredible value upstairs, especially on their small plates upstairs. The sangria is a must and the other specialty cocktails/infused vodkas make for a special evening.

Additionally, he answered any questions we had.  We immediately knew it was no contest and Chef Tony was the way to go.Since our wedding was being hosted at a remote location outside and in Sister Bay, it was important that Chef Tony could support our venue.  He had all the equipment to cook, house, plate the food until it was time to eat.  Our guests raved about how amazing the food was and we are still getting compliments about it today.  Chef Tony and his staff were incredible to work with and made it so easy day of. We didn't have to worry about a thing except to enjoy our wedding with our family and friends. We highly recommend Chefusion for any type of event your looking to host.
