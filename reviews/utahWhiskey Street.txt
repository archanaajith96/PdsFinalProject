I recommend the beef and polenta poutine. The snack serves were huge (we had three plates, and felt stuffed). Cocktails were unusual and delicious - avg around $10 each. Also recommend The Lochness - like a chartreuse pina colada!We enjoyed it so much that we'll be coming back tomorrow for our last night in SLC"}, {"review_id": "Y8CU6_K0AfQFwWx3v3kGtw", "user_id": "Yxj8O3t-szlSK6zGETYUSQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Another Alex S. Short... and A.S.S. if you will. (Basically anything with an \"s\" after my name is given that acronym). Cocktails, were delightful. Mixed perfectly with the kick you want a little of and the refreshment you want a lot of. All three fit the bill and were refreshing. Also, their selection is pretty darn good and well-created.The pork belly corn dogs, just depended on the bites. The range was... this is the greatest corndog I have ever had to... oh gross... fat. There were far more delicious bites mind you, but a teeny weeny minus for those overly fatty bites. (Alex it is pork belly what did you expect). This is my review so suck it.THE VERDICT:Great bar staff, great cocktails, great occasional bites of corn dog. I am a fan and whenever I am in the DTSLC I know that I have a friendly bar waiting for me with the perfect pick me up to get the night started."}, {"review_id": "TMuF1FTfdjZQnkH8v-7AiQ", "user_id": "JtRHOHqpuomtRsvJ1tSpSw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "We have been here before for drinks and my husband came for dinner and drinks with his friends for a bachelor party.  But I had never eaten here before until last Saturday when we met friends for brunch.  There was no wait and it wasn't crowded at all. However, service was extremely slow and it dragged out our visit for over an hour and a half.  I couldn't understand why the server was taking forever to come up to us, take our order, etc. when there were multiple servers and only 8 to 10 tables with patrons. My water glass was never refilled until way after I emptied it and the second time I needed to stop the server from walking past us to ask for more.  The service is really what brought it down to 3 stars. The food was really good and everyone enjoyed their meals.  It was just really frustrating to have to wait forever in between each time the server came  to check on us. My husband ordered the breakfast burger.  It was fully loaded and the eggs were cooked to perfection making for an oozy mess as he ate it. There was so much on the burger he had to cut it in half to tackle it. He devoured every bite.  I ordered a side of breakfast potatoes and eggs and then a mixed green salad  (I was still on a strict eating plan and couldn't enjoy the menu like I would have normally). I really loved the seasoning on the potatoes and how crisp it was outside with a chewy center. Our friends ordered the salmon breakfast bagel and the breakfast bagel. The meals came with a generous portion of breakfast potatoes or fries and they enjoyed the flavors of both dishes.  The roasted red pepper cream cheese gave an interesting punch of flavor to the bagels.  They also ordered one of the Guiness pancakes. This thing was massive and took up the whole plate.  The pancake itself was rich and it was nice and fluffy. Then you add the cream and maple syrup and you have a punch of deliciousness with all the different flavors combining as you take a bite. They absolutely loved it and it will definitely be something I try in the future.  The bathrooms were nice and clean and they even offer fresh clean towels or paper towels to dry off. The photos on the wall near the restrooms are fascinating to see the history of the space itself and main street as a whole and they really add to the atmosphere."}, {"review_id": "uj3A5ROz-IU7ccWVdgJa4w", "user_id": "3H2VbXZ8upvCFncbi5xTcg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "Ahhhh Dang this place is A-mazing!  Our last dinner is SLC was here at Whisky Street.  The place is sandwiched between several other interesting restaurants that I'll have to try on our next trip back to SLC.  It has an open air type space with seating outside and is  The place was buzzing with people and the menu looked great.  Deviled eggs yelp.com/user_local_phot… they were the first to arrive.  Pimento cheese, bourbon smoked paprika, double smoked bacon, pickled mustard seed and chives.  A perfect bite to start dinner.  I enjoyed the contrast of the pickled mustard seed with the creamy egg yolks.Grilled Caesar yelp.com/user_local_phot…  Best damn salad, hands down!  It's a simple dish of grilled romaine hearts, pecorino, focaccia croutons but man oh man was this good.  Oh and the portion was huge for a side salad to my steak.  Seriously this was shared with 2 others because it was so much.  I don't know what magical stuff they sprinkled on it but man this salad is definitely one I would order again and again, soo good.NY Steak au Poivre yelp.com/user_local_phot…Ok I'm Ribeye gal and hardly ever stray away from it except when its not on the menu which was the case here.  Although not marbled with fat as the ribeye this NY stood up very well as it was seasoned and cooked to a perfect medium rare.  Accompanied with black truffle smashed yukon golds, roasted brussel sprouts, cabernet demi.   Eyes ~ Very cool spotNose ~ Smells like good cookingEar ~ Happy diners eating and chatting Mouth ~ Ohhhhh my that was good!Tummy ~ Stuffed & Satisfied"}, {"review_id": "bvyZ30hbqB8DMOgFZy69nA", "user_id": "H4Xk9Zf7jNPUWEwesHrkiw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Having lived in SLC back when it was almost impossible to get a decent cocktail, it almost seems impossible that places this hip and cool can exist within blocks of Temple Square.

They specialize in whiskey but they have a very extensive adult libations menu.  The food menu has some interesting yummy food.  We started out with the pork belly corn dogs and I ordered the meatloaf for my entree.  Those corn dogs were so freaking good!  We ordered a second order because you don't get very many.  The meatloaf was ginormous! I received 2 very healthy slices that were perfect.  They weren't dry.  They were cooked to perfection.  The sauce was made with Coca Cola and whiskey and was probably one of the best sauces that I've had for meatloaf.  It was accompanied by fresh green beans but who needs green beans when you've got meatloaf perfection. Lol!  Some of my other colleagues tried the steak and they were very pleased with their selection.

The drink menu is extensive and a bit overwhelming, but there is something for everyone. Amazing speciality cocktails, local beer, wine on tap, and every type of whiskey one could want. Definitely an ideal spot for a drink or two.Regarding food, I immediately fell in love with the menu, which made it difficult to decide on something to order. I went for the short rib grilled cheese - sinfully delicious. I also tried one of the spicy Asian wings with Gorgonzola dressing- the spicy Asian sauce was to die for. There were a lot of great looking appetizers, salads, soups, and main dishes (salmon, meatloaf) jazzed up with a creative twist. Quite a variety of GF options, as well.Glad I had a chance to experience Whiskey Street."}, {"review_id": "3B5C58WJZY7WnO8dyhNrJA", "user_id": "xEIF6_zFweq_MkKEYwxmGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Went to Whiskey Street on the strong recommendation from an Uber driver.

My friend and I went on a Tuesday evening at 5, and the place was already filled. Loved the energy, music and the ambience there. The service was fairly quick as well. Our server was very helpful and offered to explain the different whiskeys and their specialty. We ordered a bourbon each and were happy with the choice. The food is excellent. While waiting for our lamb chops, we looked around the restaurant and all the food being delivered looked really well presented.
