This place is amazing. Fantastic service, great coffee and cocoa, and top of the line service. We popped in after dinner for some hot drinks to take while looking at holiday lights. I kind of wanted a cookie, but was on the fence. I got a great deal and it was super soft even though they were closing for the night. My hot cocoa is a thing of art with a fun design like in the movies. Love this place! Kudos to the baristas for their friendly service as well!"}, {"review_id": "OlOgWQ0NbVuiYJ1hZyXYPg", "user_id": "x2gXYe38bVmFKkhhDo_qfA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/24/2017", "text": "Super cool spot...my mocha is delicious!Love the murals on the outside.  Parking lot is small but there is parking on the street.

Rain, shine, make-up or no make-up--I'm there. My favorite drink choices: the iced matcha with cashew milk, The Pope's Choice as beans to-go or as a drip, the bone shaker as beans to-go, or a real pumpkin latte when it's in season! Chris and Katie are a couple of my favorite barista's from the beginning! Chris was a barista that helped me back when I went to SBUX in town. Both always happy and smiling faces there! This is my #1 recommendation for folks visiting ICT."}, {"review_id": "2dHRaGvLs_zlRgrl7HGRvQ", "user_id": "p7jnbqK_Dx2qHULqVGM4WQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Favorite coffee shop in Wichita!

Beautiful building with a lot of charm and character. Staff were very friendly and welcoming. It gets pretty packed here so be on the look out for an open seat as soon as you place your order. I also ordered a chocolate chip scone to snack on. It was super dry so I don't really recommend it. I'll definitely be back though whenever I'm visiting my hometown."}, {"review_id": "iB5u2JzmPYnSBMeJ26Nwog", "user_id": "jEcRU5vbQrsH7tT-eH1VRQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Great atmosphere!

I'm in Wichita a few times a year for work and discovered this place last year. I didn't buy any coffee to take home and regretted it. This time I bought two bags to take back to San Diego with me! The coffee is delicious and well made, the baristas are friendly and the shop itself is warm and cozy. It makes a great study spot or place to meet a friend and chat over a cup of joe."}, {"review_id": "pC6-NMeiDplEmtYCa9YApg", "user_id": "_aCMWUgPipzP7Af-_mG-jg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Love coming here for coffee!

I don't know much about Wichita, but I know coffee and a cuppa black like Reverie pours is right up my alley. Super hipster vibe inside this location tucked into what appears to be a neighborhood in revival. There was a great crowd on the Saturday morning I stopped by. The interior design has a real industrial feel to it. With the coffee roaster visible in the back of the shop, you can tell this a working coffee shop. Crowd is super hip and boisterous. Love the multitude of 1lb bags available for purchase as well as shipping (if you don't live in the area). I'd stack Reverie up there with KC's best coffee shops and won't hesitate to return when I'm in the area again soon."}, {"review_id": "ZAC8OskTiUSM7WfXWD1-Ug", "user_id": "exn0eYC_dT-BLoNDzhVBHg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Made my first of many visits to come. They were busy on a Saturday morning with a bit of a wait at the table but the service remained engaged which was nice. The coffee was superb. This is one of the few Farm to Table restaurants in Wichita and it is done very well, from ambiance, eclectic staff and well executed menu. Looking forward to enjoying Founders Bakery which is attached. It was everything a Portland, Boulder or any other foodie centric community offers ....Wichitasome!"}, {"review_id": "A2j1Novh0DO9ciCJ9-RqEg", "user_id": "TKDqrsGB3Ivj_NAqaDdlTg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "There's a tortilla soup that's been said to be the best thing you've ever had in your mouth.

This is a very good craft coffee shop.I drink a tremendous amount of espresso (at least 4 shots every single day), and the Reverie stuff lands somewhere in the top tier of quality craft coffee shops that I visit.  It doesn't really affect the drink, but the 'latte art' was absolutely top notch as well. Take a gander before you slap a lid on.The location was a breeze to find and park, even for an out-of-towner like me.

Nice, clean, hipster decor.Got an iced caramel latte and cocoa mocha latte. Caramel was very sour. Mocha was alright.There wasn't much food item available; scone and muffin.
