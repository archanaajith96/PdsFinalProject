I stand by all of my original statements in my first review, but what really pumped this place up was last nights experience. MARK IS AN AWESOME SERVER. That guy is so laid back and gets what you need when you need it. They were friggin slammed, but he was cool as a cucumber. We also had a gentleman great us at the door when we arrived announcing a 10-15 min. wait and he was wearing a kilt. YES. A kilt. And when our table was ready, he sang my name out. OH GLORY BE. I will remember this night for quite awhile. Their bloody mary lands in my top 5 bloody mary's in NE WI. The food was as spot on as the first time. I wish this place would be in Appleton instead of GB so I could party hard and get my drink on here because their beer selection ROCKS. Looking forward to many more lunch dates and gatherings here in the future."}, {"review_id": "IHBl6fTVCj8cBvACmlJXaQ", "user_id": "VzlX5LJ7__pl6AaBWBiw9w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Pro Tip: this is in the old rail station across from the brewery...Great beer, good pub fare. The cheese curds did have some squeak to them and the service was awesome.I give them props for the PB&B burger. It's a sloppy mess of goodness with peanut butter, bacon, and a burger cooked to order on a fresh ciabatta roll. I would totally get that again."}, {"review_id": "nq3Dy29y7ulX1gwG7NQzUQ", "user_id": "sj6MuZEA5To_lYn2acfaXQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "I  love Titletown.Good beer.  Great service.

Been eating here over the years, this menu is revamped since my last visit. The food was ok. We started off with some wings, they were not good. Then we split an elk burger and the flatbread with spinach and tomatoes. The elk burger was awesome. Hated the bread it came on last time I was here (its sliced bread), so subbed it for the ciabatta. Awesome sandwich. Flatbread was mediocre. I have had two vastly different experiences here. One had great food and great beer, the most recent visit the food was just meh. Titletown is consistent with one thing--and that's great beer! Try the ctrl-alt-delete brew. Tastes are free, but this is by far one of my favorite brews from any of the local breweries."}, {"review_id": "Xo0pa5v0MxqYSWzHF8M1nw", "user_id": "73QT5Z-H3_-uCuv4BUGecA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Guy behind the bar was really nice, walked me thru the menu, made sure I knew the go tos, since I was only in town for one night. The beers are amazing, a lot of options, across the spectrum of beer styles, I tried 4 different beers and enjoyed them all. Got the poutine with fried cheese curds on the side, so i could try both separately, before adding them to the party together! Hot, fresh and loaded with flavor. If I am able to get back to this part of the world, no doubt I will stop back in for a cold beer and poutine!"}, {"review_id": "55XBcxOF3ZPP-13FXQcpcQ", "user_id": "UEs9mZhxSfAfh73s0xAzJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "They have the best burger I ever tasted.

We go to Octoberfest in Germany all the time.  Blood red is the best beer I ever tasted. Green Bay has gem a great tasting brewery and awesome food. Our server Eli was johhny on the spot.

My boyfriend and I were in the area yesterday and decided to stop in. It was around 7 PM when we stopped in, so it was much quieter than normal. Our waitress was at our table with water within a few minutes of us sitting down. My boyfriend ordered one of their seasonal beers (we can't remember the name!) and I ordered a Sno-Cap root beer. They make their own beer on site, so their menu changes once in a while. The selection of beers is fairly extensive as well. Their food menu has typical things such as salads, sandwiches, wraps, burgers, pizza, and dinner entrees with unique twists on the traditional versions. I ordered the white bean and lentil burger and my boyfriend ordered the TBC Tacos, one with fried cod and the other with grilled chicken. Both of us ordered the pub fries as our side, which are some of the best fries I've ever had! We both enjoyed what we ordered. Before I stopped eating meat, two of my favorite things to order were the spicy elk burger or the cranberry turkey melt. Both sandwich are excellent! Our waitress was attentive and friendly, making sure that our drinks were never less than half full. We will definitely be back when we're in Green Bay again."}, {"review_id": "vUoYv5JixmqLY5_jf5KI2Q", "user_id": "704FCmH3QryfTyBqZkofQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "Titletown is a long and cherished destination Green Bay Area. My family and I have been dining here since the beginning. Please make sure you go on a Tuesday to try their signature beer cheese soup. It is better than any BC soup I have ever had(I don't even waste my time with BC soup at other places anymore since this is the real deal). The service has always been excellent. Whether you are having a beer in the tap room, checking out the rooftop, or dining in the original historical train station, you cannot go wrong."}, {"review_id": "e4w9DcY6tj5e4RJKyqv4bQ", "user_id": "JY5rJWL0nxVfY4BNH53zSQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I like the beers better here than any other in Green Bay.

Our server was prompt and very pleasant and friendly. I ordered a craft beer and my wife a root beer. Our order was taken quickly. My wife got fish and chips, and I got the \"Oldenberger\" an Elk burger. It did take a bit to get our meal but it had gotten busier. The wait was not excessive however. My wife's fish and chips were delicious or so she told me. My Elk burger was good but not something to rave over as some reviewers have done. The meat was not as savory as others claim.We got a piece of Carrot Cake and split it between us. It was fantastic! Very tasty and not overly sweet.We loved the decor and had several trains pass during our dinner. The bartender tooted a train whistle when the trains were passing. All and all a solid place to eat and visit."}, {"review_id": "FOUawGd9whGzG0n1bgMviQ", "user_id": "uySoWWkOGUlaJt4EQC1oKw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "The atmosphere was great and the history of the building and the area are cool.

Absolutely excellent on both accounts. Their fish fry is great, the burgers are super delicious (elk burger!), and their pasta carbonara rocks. They have great service, even when busy. Be forewarned that on a Friday or Saturday night, there will be a bit of a wait, but it's definitely worth it. They brew their own beer, and each one is really good. They stopped making my favorite of their beers - Ctl, Alt, Delete  - but Johnny Blood Red is fantastic as well. I have tried many of their beers, and haven't really found one that I don't like. My husband loves Green 19 IPA. If you are thinking about trying this place, go now. Such a good place."}, {"review_id": "qgxQ7xx9G5J48TFS9SHZBg", "user_id": "znFY4lw0rYolM_LbaaCcqA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/23/2017", "text": "I use to like the place but my recent experience will cause me to seek out other establishments. We went on a Friday night and they were busy, about a 45-60 min wait. We went upstairs where is was a little less crowded and the bartender told us we could eat at the bar table if we wanted so we did.  We both ordered a cup of chili.  My wife had the rotisserie chicken salad and I had the tenderloin steak.  The chili came right away and was excellent. The main entries not so much.  The salad had weird looking cubes of chicken and was not my wife's favorite. My green beans were perfect but the tenderloin came out barely rare when I ordered Med Rare.  No problem, the bartender put in another order rather than taking that one and having it grilled more.  The 2nd one was perfect but it was a really long wait for it.  The reason for the low rating was when it was time to pay I handed the bartender my Hoppy Camper card (a club card that my wife bought at the start of the year for $25 each.  One of the benefits on the card was a free meal on your birthday week). The bartender was not aware of the discount and I had to bring the ticket to another persons attention.  Then when I received the new ticket they took off my wife's salad for 9.99.  I went back to get them to deduct my meal and they said they only give a $15 discount toward a free meal.  That was not listed anywhere on the card and was not told to us when we bought the card.  I asked why I didn't get the $15 discount then and only the $9.99.  I was told they have no way to discount a $24 steak by $15.  What if we both would have ordered the steak?  Again the food is okay, but not anything special.  The service was good but the customer service was terrible.  We will not be back."}, {"review_id": "10LRupf1uxlPFxejNxeY3g", "user_id": "-UfO2JybWSHB5nywTisJBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Titletown Brewing is always an absolute must when we visit Green Bay!

Come on. If you're ever in the land of Packers and cheese, this brewery is two massive spaces you just have to see to believe.One is a brewery that is attached to The Cannery public public and has multiple space inside the brewery including; two tap room, a store AND A GORGEOUS ROOFTOP PATIO that overlooks the restaurant. The restaurant is placed inside an old train station which I'm assuming is where the brewery started out in and then they renovated the building next store to expand because this was obviously a huge destination for Packer fans and Green Bay natives.They do accept names via Yelp and the Nowait app but not on game day weekends. So we went in out our names down at the restaurant and walked over to the taproom to have a brew. Now inside the building is two taprooms, one inside with televisions and a store then one on the rooftop that is also inside but has outdoor patio seating overlooking downtown Green Bay. Let me just say this patio was unreal gorgeous and spacious and oh so relaxing. We both with went their seasonal Citra IPA and sat in chairs overlooking the restaurant and Lake Michigan.Now the wait was not bad and once we finished our beers we were receiving a text saying our table was ready. So we crossed the yard to their restaurant and was seated immediately to a very crowded building. We asked our server for recommendations but she recommended a salad... I didn't come to Wisconsin for a salad so we knew we had to reach for the foodie meats and cheeses, cause after this weekend we learned what Wisconsin loves and does best after the numerous meat and cheese plates we saw on multiple restaurants and breweries menus. I went with the P.B.L.T. (Pork belly BLT) and Zach sprung for the spicy elk burger as most Yelpers had recommended. My sammie was Grilled pork belly, lettuce, tomato, roasted garlic mayo on leek and rosemary sourdough bread. The elk burger was a grilled elk patty with chipotle peppers, topped with smoked Gouda cheese, spinach, roasted garlic mayo and jalapeños on a toasted house made onion-poppy seed bread.We also started with a large Barvarian pretzel that came with beer cheese, spicy mustard and pepperoni sauce. They have two pretzel options and honestly we both scarfed down the beer cheese and left the other two alone. So when you go get the pretzel and bread plate with multiple items just to dip in the beer cheese called the \"switchman plate.\"Overall this first meal and beer experience in Green Bay was so much fun and a really great insight into the city and their people. I'm sure we will be back next time we're in town for another Packer game!"}, {"review_id": "Csqjd5nYxjUs-_EGn1OKXg", "user_id": "GUJPglqYm9sieUaDAvaJnA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/15/2017", "text": "Excellent brewery, with great food and a very nice selection of beers!
