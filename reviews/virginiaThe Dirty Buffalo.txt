Whenever my bf and I are craving philly cheese steak sandwiches and wings, this is where we come!If you want a happy relationship, let me give you a tip: find someone that is willing to order a million things on the menu and pig out with you on a Tuesday night. Our typical order looks like this:- Philly cheesesteak sandwich's $10. We get ours with pepper jack cheese. It's the perfect balance of cheesy with the slightly crunchy and fresh bites of sautéed green bell peppers and onions! Sometimes the two halves are weirdly portioned, like one half will be full to the brim and the other is a little sad looking but whatever. It comes with your choice of side, but trust me when I say get the fries! They're like Rally's seasoned fries, not that typical thick cut bar food fries. - Fried pickles $4.99. They're the chip kind (it's weird that I have to explain that cause some places serve fried pickles long ways?! It's obvious that the chip kind is superior)- Six bone in $6 and six boneless wings $6We've tried a variety of sauces here and our favorites are just classic mild buffalo and sometimes sweet BBQ.As for the ambiance, it's a sports bar down the street from ODU. It's gonna be loud, it's gonna be packed, but it's so good. You may have to park on. the street or a bit in the neighborhood adjacent but it all depends on what time you get there I guess! Solid place with great food!"}, {"review_id": "N_j42rezQ5yHI6TR7FUDFA", "user_id": "IQItPCTkKi7K5uE43nN2SQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Went in for lunch at 11:45 on a Wednesday with my coworker. Neither of us have ever been here so we tried it. We were seated immediately and waited on drinks while we stared at the menu. I ordered the five wings sauced with the buffalo soldier sauce with a side and i opted for the macaroni and cheese, which is a one dollar up charge. The wings were very good with a flavor I haven't tasted before. The reason being they weren't the buffalo sauce. They were some kind of garlic super mild sauce. You would think I would be mad but I was so hungry, whatever. Delicious flavor, really unique actually. I wanted hot sauce so I could blow the pollen out of my nose but maybe next time. I'll be back."}, {"review_id": "JfGyjilc3irk-JexZ80v2Q", "user_id": "sCOjoM_buXFVrnAFLVYktA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Wiiiiings ! For my cheat meal I was holding out for this. I have gone before a couple years ago when it was smaller and I got a philly cheese (don't ask me why but I did). But this time when I went, I got wiiiings. What i like about this place is that you can try the sauce before you actually get it on the wings. There are so many types to choose from. I got the wing and side combo. Spicy BBQ was my choice of sauce. It really blended two of my favorite sauces together. Caitlyn took care of us and she was great. She made sure that our glasses were full! I also liked how she told us it was an extra 50 cents for a certain type of wing. For example, I wanted all drums so I had to pay an additional 50 cents. I'll take that!"}, {"review_id": "dhhvrmxCtOd_qtqzOkxZXw", "user_id": "ovpj9rUjj_SpDBGwaFWoQg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Atmosphere: Your typical sports bar. Tables in the middle with tvs all around. A big bonus was that they actually had the game sound on instead of club music like Buffalo Wild Wings. Went to watch March Madness.Food: I got boneless wings with teriyaki and Old Bay seasoning. The flavor of both was pretty bland. The flavor needs some work. Beer selection was...meh. I prefer stouts and porters, they mostly had IPAs. Service: Not bad, nothing special. Good service overall. Overall: I would try another place.

Norfolk is a lame city but the wings here make it worth living here. Now I know some of you are like \"well if Norfolk is so lame why don't you leave?\" Well unfortunately I cannot because I'm in the military and we can't just leave. Ok anyway back to the wings. This place really is the best wing place around for real. Everyone there is really friendly. The manager or owner is always there and he always checks up and looks out. Every Wednesday is 65 cent wings from 5-7 and Thursday day is boneless wing night also from 5-7. They have a wonderful array of flavors from traditional buffalo to curry. They also have a flavor of the week which is pretty cool. It's a unique flavor not on the menu that changes but sometimes they'll keep it if it's popular enough (Buffalo Soldier) The Dirty Buffalo is a great place for any occasion. Weather it be a Tinder/Bumble date, graduation, re-enlistment, a snack before the club come here and enjoy good comfort food"}, {"review_id": "8YDabpmY7K-roD6KiUptdQ", "user_id": "Lm8MbqgIrPsE0isG8HteCQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Great place to grab a beer and get some wings while watching the game I've never been disappointed in the wings I just wish it wasn't as pricey but in their specials you definitely get the bang for your buck.

It likely won't be your fav wing spot, but you'll get good service, the beers will be cold, and the wings will be above average. For a real treat, stray from the bird and build your own plate. They're great hangover cures, so I hear. I'm a koala, so I spend most of my time drinking water and eating plants, so I don't get hangovers. I ordered the \"ugly duckling\" an item that used to be hidden on the menu, but is now prominently displayed. It's essentially the wings that aren't pretty, are deformed, or otherwise jacked up. You get a dozen for $9.99. It's the cheapskates dream wing basket. Wash it down w/ some fries, which are actually tremendous, crispy outside, soft interior. Oh and dip them in your wing sauce for a little extra ugly. You may feel like a nap afterward, which some people don't like, but I love naps so mission accomplished.....zzzzz"}, {"review_id": "Sy_xgu7CWajsT4NvI8kwFQ", "user_id": "PpoXts9bHpHbOqMIHXNa2w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Went for my first visit at their new location.  On the recommendation of an out of town friend who watches Food Network, I tried the \"Dirty Chick,\" Mac and cheese with home fries and 2 breaded chicken tenders on top (choice of run or sauce).  Very tasty and worth the calories."}, {"review_id": "EBqRacg_hjsBDI4l235Lwg", "user_id": "YDlF1LhhjobmI8OW26s3Vg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "The atmosphere was awesome..sports bar type..

That said, often the simplest things can come off horribly wrong if not executed well. I've eaten at The Dirty Buffalo several times and they consistently make quality wings. My faves are the BBQ, Spicy BBQ, Sweet Sriracha, Teriyaki, and Spicy Cheriyaki. Since those sauces are done so well I rarely use ranch or blue cheese except for dipping my celery. I typically do the 10 wings and a side combo because their fries are great. I use them primarily to clean the sauce out of the bottom of the baskets. You can split your order of 10 wings and get two flavors. It's a good strategy. They also have a good selection of plates, Mac-Bowls, and bargain hangover delights like Poor Man's Wings (fries smothered in a wing sauce of your choice) or Dirty Fries (fries smothered in chili and cheese sauce). They have a full bar with cocktails and a decent beer selection. There's also TVs everywhere if you're a sports fan. Football Game nights can get pretty loud so if that's not your thing I'd avoid Sunday, Monday, and Thursdays. However if you want to scream at a TV in public feel free to show up on those nights. If you're a wing fan you need to have this spot on regular rotation."}, {"review_id": "OSu_uZq-FLKkiqusfxiWbQ", "user_id": "cXTcdpi-UJs8M3pZysmcvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/31/2017", "text": "I'm giving The Dirty Buffalo 5 stars because out of all of the places to get wings in Virginia Beach/ Norfolk this has been the best. And, the most creative. The wings blew my husband and I out of the water, they were SO delicious. Side note, their ranch was also delicious! Is that weird? Lol! The fries were perfectly crispy and tasted fresh, not frozen, which was a pleasant surprise. I ordered The Dirty Chick which is essentially two chicken tenders in your choice of sauce (get the Cajun Buffalo, SO GOOD!!) over a bed of fries and mac and cheese. I don't know how you could ever, ever, ever go wrong with that. The menu had me at mac and cheese... for real.The staff wasn't overly attentive or anything but they were very helpful in making sure our table was clear and coming by to check on us frequently, which made the experience even better. They have PLENTY of TV's, games and such to keep you entertained and it gets as loud as any usual bar would on a Thursday night. Although we had to drive 30 minutes from our home in Virginia Beach, I would definitely do it all over again. :)"}, {"review_id": "lLmtQmpYfvWzo6_d_6350g", "user_id": "uc5qvp-uGCFleOytHaEIVg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I feel like I am a broken record but that is how much I love this place!!!

Also, $3.00 well drinks 5-7... so you know that instantly warrants a tequila-orange juice. Service is fairly quick but depending what time you came in and the volume in the restaurant, your food might take a while to come out - especially when you are in a large group. Our server was friendly this past Weds. and did her best to keep up with the crowd. My personal favorites are pineapple habanero (saucy*), mango habanero (dry), and chili lime (dry). The dry rubs are crunchy and hot every time, but occasionally, my saucy wings will be a bit on the lukewarm to cold side. It's probably because of the sauce that drops the temperature drastically, but this is the issue with many saucy wings no matter where I go. I have tried the dumb dumb and felt... quite dumb with how spicy it is. It has a serious burn but compared to spicy food in other places, it hurt without flavor, y'know? One of my friend's favorites include terriyaki, and I need to try their sweeter sauces despite the risk in the temperature not being fresh as the dry rub wings. The BBQ always sounds so delightful. My other friend's favorite is the cajun dry rub, which I hear there's a spicier version of it as well. I should probably include that in my list to try. I tend to not go for the weekly flavor and try someone else's because I tend to stick to what I know and like. Most of the time, the flavors are nice, but I know I'd regret not sticking to their classic assortment of wings. I'll definitely be back because it's one of my favorite wing joints in the area."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-dirty-buffalo-norfolk?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
