Chicken katsu lunch plate:  as mentioned, even though it was a lunch plate, it was big enough to feed 2 people, that is a plus.  Unfortunately, I was not impressed with the katsu sauce.  It was very sour and did not compliment the chicken well.  If this was different I would have definitely bumped it up a star.  I would come back to try other meals and sushi to get a better outlook on this restaurant."}, {"review_id": "AIrpvpOsmvuJ3UfEjICn_A", "user_id": "GdkupEXprSBV3_5jNpE69A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "I came in around 3pm for lunch (don't ask), but it was still pretty crowded!

The miso soup and salad (with a peanut-based dressing) came out less than 5 minutes after I put in my order. About 10 minutes after getting the soup and salad, I received my bento.First off, wow the sashimi was so fresh! The beef teriyaki was perfectly seasoned, but I did wish it would have been a little more tender. I received a pretty large portion of teriyaki, however. The rice was cooked just right.The miso soup was seasoned perfectly (with a decent amount of tofu. I emphasize this because I once received two tiny pieces...LITERALLY two tiny pieces of tofu at this one Japanese place).Great service (especially from Daniel woot woot).Overall, a cozy and bustling place with good food options and friendly service."}, {"review_id": "teeKD8LtnQxq2K2buZrs4w", "user_id": "FyLWoEnVaXihpKXTOHOgFA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "I've been a regular patron at Cha Cha for about a year & a half.

My boyfriend and I are big fans of the huge Hanson roll and any of their baked rolls.  We ordered a Hanson and a baked Lion King roll.  When our Hanson arrived, we were surprised to see how \"small\" the roll was in comparison to its size when we've visited previously.  My boyfriend and I had a similar reaction to the Lion King roll; it was small in comparison to other baked rolls we've ordered.  I'm not sure if they've recently hired new sushi chefs or if they've changed staff/management, but Cha Cha isn't as impressive as it used to be!"}, {"review_id": "PmxjF3G5fzBAtczO2FkJ0Q", "user_id": "p20urCDAt1o2XqsC2gh1PQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Cha Cha Sushi is the bomb.com. It probably is one of my favorite sushi restaurants so far. The thing is though, it was closed when me and my friend arrived around 12:15 on a Sunday Afternoon. We had to wait until 1PM to go inside. When we came back out around 12:50PM, there was already a line, and then a lot of people kept coming. The waiter came out, and everyone just rushed in, madly. They quickly got drinks for everyone, and we ordered. My friend ordered the Titantic Roll, which looked pretty good, and I ordered the Lion King, which I really liked. Lion King has always been one of my favorites at sushi restaurants, and many get it wrong. This has got to be one of 3 places I've been to that got it right. The Lion King came with mayo and some sort of spicy dressing, but the inside, and the outside just worked. The salmon was cooked fully, the roll was long so there were many pieces. It was just bliss, a taste of many wrapped in one. I would definitely recommend it! I didn't get to try a piece of my friend's Titanic Roll, but she enjoyed it! I'm glad I got to come here and try this place out thanks to her recommendation!

Funny enough, I just figured it would be nice again to take the gf out to a Valentine's day dinner and just from seeing my last review back in 2015, yea.. goodness gracious.. I think that was pretty much the last time I was here.. was it? I have no idea. another Valentine's day from years ago.Randomly checking out their website yesterday morning to see if there was any changes since then, I found myself surprised by an image in the \"About Us\" section that looked all too familiar. Looked thru my old photos, and even at my last review, and sure enough... hey! that's my food!At that point, I'm like what's the legality of that? Not like I really cared much about it, and after some brief research I couldn't do anything anyway.. but did kinda give an excuse to go say hi to Hanson and yet have another lovely dinner... I mean.. it's been years afterall..As expected, Valentine's Day was busy.. long wait and a crowd of people outside. I honestly lost track of how long our wait was.. easily over an hour I think... Anyway, it went by and got our seats at the bar. This place has yet to disappoint me. I got my usual order of the moriawase and the first thing I noticed was the mound of uni Hanson gave me.. OMFG THANK YOU... he knows me so well. lol. The escolar was also quite fresh and exceptional that evening... perhaps it had been too long, but it was just utterly mouthwatering. Tuna, salmon, snapper, yellowtail, and even got some scallops as well. Just omg.. YES. Uni was on point.. fresh, creamy, delicious... all the makings of a wonderful meal.I need a better job.. seriously.."}, {"review_id": "1tLUAswSG9vwesLOIAHfnA", "user_id": "Vduko6aW0RWk-XJmsmPxUw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Cha Cha is a great place if you're into CA rolls and bento boxes.Most of their rolls are california rolls with toppings. Their bento boxes are huge and definitely sharable if you get the 3-item combo. I don't recommend the chicken teriyaki as it was a bit dry and bland. Also, I'm pretty sure that my credit card info was compromised at this location. I visited SJ last weekend and used my credit card at all food places like 85 degrees and iTea - all of which had the chip insertion.

I usually get the Spider Roll in most places since it's usually my 'safe choice', unfortunately it was a bit lacking here. Tasted a bit bland, doesn't seem like its served with any sauces as other places do. However... the Marco and the Golden Gate were amazing. I'm not too much of a sushi fan but these 2 rolls would definitely be enough for me to come back.The atmosphere there is also great, all the workers seem close knit, joking around with each other and it just makes it such a lively fun place to get food.

Great combination Jordan Roll: AverageKing Kong: meh. Yes, hence the name \"King Kong\" I did not actually think it's the size of a hockey puck.

They were memorable cus the pieces were way too big and I had to do that weird thing where you can either shove it all in your mouth and then chew in silence for 45 seconds OR be judged for trying to bite the whole sucker in half..The boy got the sashimi- a wiser and safer choice.

It's a cool perk but diners aren't entitled to it if it's free. You know how expensive those things get? (Sorry. Had to get on my soapbox for a second.)Sushi here really hits the spot. They have your classic stuff (caterpillar rolls, nigiri, sashimi) and some more inventive takes on rolls, such as their orange blossom and Giants' rolls. We split a spider roll, caterpillar roll, and a Giants' roll. The first two were ordinary -- I liked the presentation of the spider roll, which came with some super spiky shrimp tempura tails in the end pieces. The caterpillar roll was a little soggy. As you'll see in one of the photos I posted, it fell apart as I tried to pick it up, soggy from the eel sauce and leaving precious rice on the plate. Avocado and cucumber were quite fresh, though.The Giants' roll should be an essential part of any meal here. It's a novel concept: paper-thin lemon slices on a salmon-topped California roll? Eurgh. But you'd be surprised how much the lemon, glazed with eel sauce, brings out the natural flavor of the salmon. Apparently, what bumped this place up to 5 stars for my significant other was their tempura ice cream. I know, I know. You don't come to a sushi place for the tempura ice cream! But in a strange twist of events, maybe you should. They deep fry and split a pint of cookies 'n cream or green tea ice cream in quarters. That's a steal at $5.50, and more than enough for two people to split. Our total came out to $46.50, an average price for sushi.It is, unfortunately, much too far for me to come here for sushi often. But I can see why it's been an east San Jose staple for so long."}, {"review_id": "DppZDq_KZ1MxWvNVgnJYPA", "user_id": "_yEyHoaub0gW0zpIM5RE1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Good place for Sushi.
