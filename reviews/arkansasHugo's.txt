I guess.  Really too bad.  2 stars because they were at least cordial about it.  But won't be back to try the food."}, {"review_id": "t5FnJun-tkrUz1DGBoNbXg", "user_id": "FDQpUh4pC3PAP9rfRuaXmQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "I had heard so much about Hugo's and finally had the chance to stop in with my brother after the Farmer's Market. First, the rumors about the wait aren't rumors. Expect a wait. Especially on a weekend. This place is super loud and super crowded. The tables and chairs are really close together, so you are not going to get an intimate experience here.Now the service-awesome. The staff was just on it like white on rice. Friendly, checked in regularly while we were waiting and our server was just the sweetest. I ordered a regular ol' burger, but there was nothing regular about it. It was awesome. The reviews are true. This is one of the best burgers I've ever had. My brother is a vegetarian and got the Veggie Reuben. He said it was DELICIOUS.Hugo's is definitely a place you should add to your bookmarks and try at least once. Bring your patience and your appetite!Tip: It's in a basement, so look for the stairs with the rails spelling out \"Hugo's\" in cursive...or just look for the crowd waiting for a table."}, {"review_id": "iAMDu82tlGlBgTtBAUI_5g", "user_id": "vl5bMhvbRVhjOyfcfbWQgg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "They have AWESOME Hamburgers and Fries!  We stopped in here after enjoying shopping on the Square and visiting the beautiful University of Arkansas.  Very busy place, but located in the basement of a building which, unless you knew it was there or were walking past, it would be hard to find.  However, it is a diamond in the rough worth looking for.   There were a lot of other sandwiches on the menu that I am going to try when we go back to Fayetteville.  I would recommend this place as the atmosphere is kinda cool in a \"dive-ish\" sort of way.  The food is great and prices are reasonable.  Looking forward to trying their Beers on Tap as they looked tasty"}, {"review_id": "krv2B8p80osWTKuWcbYI7w", "user_id": "hK6yIxs_JAE-l2swKVf-Kg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Came on a Thursday night while in town for a college visit and it was packed!  We waited about 20 minutes before being seated.

Their Reuben is what I usually get, but their burgers are also good. Their food comes with chips, which always irritates me, because no one likes chips. Their fries are supposedly awesome, and you can buy them as a side, which is why I assume they serve chips with their meals. And, while the fries were once awesome, they are pretty standard now, and nothing to really write home about. The wait times can be very long, and it's hit or miss on how attentive the staff are with refills. Usually it's fine, and they ARE awesome with remembering substitutions, etc. The venue is cool (below street level), but small, and if it's dim at all outside, it means is dark, crowded, and incredibly noisy. That said, I eat here a few times a year and don't hate my meals ever, but I also wouldn't wait for a table, as there are other good grub places within walking distance."}, {"review_id": "b1zrnYYGTRin_XD_TkruSw", "user_id": "QPu8RZPPjNMLfxZ6wu0FTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/13/2017", "text": "Hole in the wall of a place located in a basement near Dickson street. The place was PACKED when we arrived however, our wait was very short. The waitress was incredibly friendly and offered details on the specials for the evening. She also made suggestions on a few of her favorites. The menu is extensive with plenty to choose from. I ordered the chopped sirloin with a side salad and fries and my husband ordered the smokey cheddar burger. Our food came out quickly and cooked perfectly. My husband said it was quite possibly the best burger he has ever had and I loved my meal, as well.

If I was basing this off the burger alone I would give Hugo's 5 stars. The spinach artichoke dip was not good at all, both of us didn't touch it and still were charged for it which was fine. The other problem though was that the burgers didn't fill us up. Probably gonna need something else to eat in a couple hours.
