We were also advised that we needed to make reservations. When we contacted the restaurant, we were told the closest we could come to our requested dinner time was 4:30. Wow!We arrived right on time, and discovered that there were seats at the bar, so we gave up our table for those. The staff was fine with our switch. Our bartender didn't have on a name tag, and I am so sorry that I didn't ask his name, because he was phenomenal. He explained the menu to us, and let us know that if you want Burnt Ends, you must order the Brisket BBQ Plate. So, we did!The food was absolutely wonderful---probably some of the best BBQ anywhere. My husband wanted to add a rib to our combo plate for $3. I have to say, however, that we were disappointed in the amount of food for the price. Will we be back? Probably not.

We went on a Friday for lunch around 11:30. It was definitely bustling but there were many tables open and we were able to park easily in the lot out front.They have many beers to choose from and a good cocktail menu, and a food menu that runs the gamut from just pulled pork on a bun to more elaborate platters with different varieties of meat. I got the pulled pork sandwich and my boyfriend got the burnt ends and brisket. We were both super happy with the meat and agreed that the sides were just ok, not worth spending much of our valuable stomach space on when there was great BBQ to be had. Q39 is just a different BBQ experience - the food is definitely up to par, but the restaurant has many more frills than somewhere like Joe's (which we also went to), so it just depends on the kind of experience you are trying to have!"}, {"review_id": "hxhIrUAP8b9dE2fAy0wNJg", "user_id": "aGFp77v5Pn8wZl8hoSfBWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "We were a large party of 10 from out of town ona Thursday night and were supposed to have a 45 minute wait for a table.   By a stroke of luck, the outside bar was EMPTY so we sat there for what was supposed to be just drinks and turned out to be the best place to eat our meal.  Not only were the two bartenders knowledgeable and informative on everything from the specialty brews and best picks on the menu, but they educated us on KC BBQ history and the best places nearby for good live music.  I can't speak highly enough about the quality of our service.  I ordered a Violet Sangria (which was nothing special) and shared onion straws which were.  For dinner I had the Mr Johns sandwich and apple coleslaw.  I actually haven't stopped thinking about it!  The burnt bits (brisket ends slightly charred with just enough meat and fat) were phenomenal topped with jack cheese and onion straws and the chipotle BBQ sauce (our. Attendees gave us small cups of 2 kinds to try).  The bun was fresh and the whole thing was delicious.  Cole law is usually a ho him side but I was intrigued by the apple twist.  Omg it was good!  Slightly sweet, very light and refreshing it was the perfect complement to the heavier sandwich.  I skipped dessert.  But it looked good at another table.  If I lived in KC I'd be a regular here.  It was a true foodie delight."}, {"review_id": "-jNmux20vnpYD0HVwf2ArQ", "user_id": "adKonsQWY64vJYglPotH5Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Words can't describe the euphoria I felt from eating at my first Kansas City BBQ joint.

I made a decision on menu items, but he corrected me... he said the brisket plate with burnt ends, beans, and potato salad was the way to go.I started with a beer, which was only $5... coming from San Francisco I was crying out of happiness. The anticipation for my food built up, until I put the first bite of burnt ends into my watering mouth. SO GOOD!! That and the (spicy) baked beans were the best parts.Throughout the rest of my stay in Kansas City, it was unanimous that I had picked the best BBQ spot for my first meal.

If you are someone who is not a red meat eater you can still find something on the menu. The first I came here i ensured a reservation was made plus i got here on  Saturday immediately they opened. Danny, the waiter was a pleasure. He asked my preference in taste- the answer is always spice! i ordered a good ol fashioned- drink - the hint of orange mixed with whiskey was a delight.

You definitely need to have a reservation to make sure you can get in.The weather was nice so we sat outside on their patio. I noticed that there were several large parties present, but all the servers seemed to take it in stride. Our server in particular was awesome. It took a long time to get the bill at the end because she was running around and very busy, but I didn't deduct a star for that because she was very apologetic and still provided us with great service overall.They have an extensive menu with both BBQ platters and sandwiches.

I moved away from Kansas City before this opened, but recently returned to check out the hype and I'm not sure it deserves it. Some people prefer a regular, sit-down place and if that's the case, go to Q39. It's more high-end than most bbq places in the area/country. I'm not sold on the food, though. It's good bbq, there's no doubt about that, but in comparison to the area, this place doesn't reach five stars for me. The fries are lackluster. The white bean cassoulet side maybe shouldn't be on the menu. Yes, the meat is good and was cooked as good as can be, but... that's how it should be in KC. The burnt ends were slightly better than the brisket, and neither topped some of my favorite spots in the area. The sauces cost more (by the bottle) than most but they are good.Maybe I'm being harsh because this place was touted as one of the best. It's good bbq, but not what I'd recommend if you're visiting the area for a weekend because there are better choices.

It's a more \"upscale\" restaurant than the other two but that's fine and the food was amazing. Burnt ends, brisket, ribs, pulled pork, Mac and cheese, bacon wrapped shrimp and the wings. The wings and the ribs were the standouts. I can comfortably say that the ribs were the best of the 3 places we hit (by far) - everything was perfect. They didn't miss a beat. It's hard to compare Joe's with Q39 because they're so different but they're both 5 Star and cannot be best. Q39 is a rockstar in a city that knows BBQ.

After my last tasting of burnt ends, I knew already that these were what to get.Even before the lunch hour on a Friday in winter, it seems like a lot of people frequent here. It's great that they have a \"2go\" area, which is a separate door to the right of the restaurant. The parking lot has a lot of designated spots for other businesses, so go to the end of the parking lot for the open spots.The \"2go\" spot is a counter with a register and a bench to sit on and wait. At the time I went, the cashier said it would be about 10 mins, but it came out faster than that! They're pretty efficient here too, so you're not waiting long at this time of day.Since I wanted both ribs and burnt ends, you have to order the beef brisket that comes with burnt ends, then add as many ribs as you'd like. Also for lunch, it comes with 1 side. I got the baked beans, which was a great choice.Since I got this to go, I'm not sure how it changed over the time I was driving, but even when I lightly heated up the ribs and the burnt ends, the meat was still tender. The burnt ends are more like big chunks of stew meat, but fatty and tender (I need to learn new terminology to describe meat). The ribs had a definite bark to them. I didn't have sauce with them, but they weren't the juiciest when I had them (probably due to the wait and the reheating process). Still, these were easy to clean off the bone and better than how most meat is done.Since this was straight up meat, meat, and more meat, I have yet to try the brisket (I know...I'll get to it tomorrow). Be sure to balance out all the protein with some vegetables. As much as we love carbs, it doesn't really make the digestion process any better than vegetables can.Overall, the burnt ends were the best part.

The sausage is made in house and is peppery goodness.  The brisket was amazing.  Finally the right amount of charred fat and smoky flavor!  The star however was the ribs.  I don't have the adjectives to describe it but they are the best I have ever had.  The sides were solid but the fries were used to just soak up their sauces.  They brought us a serving of each of their 3 sauces.  The have a chipoltle-cilantro sauce which has a layered spice that is phenomenal!  They have one called the South Carolina which is a vinegar based sauce with a little heat.  It's perfect with the pulled pork.  Then they have their original which is the KC style which is sweeter and made with molasses.I have written 103 5-star reviews in my 7 years as a Yelper and honestly if I was to rank those 103 reviews, Q39 is amongst my top 5 or at least top 10 places period.  I'm not one for hyperbole but this is the BEST BBQ that I have ever had.  Period.  *Drops the mike and ends the review*"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/q39-midtown-kansas-city?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
