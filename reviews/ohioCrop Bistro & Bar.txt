It seems fitting, especially because Crop continues to be one of my favorite restaurants. Located in an old bank building in Ohio City, Crop has one of the best restaurant ambiances in Northeast Ohio. Beautiful architecture, interesting classic art and exposed bricks are a few of the things that add to the unique atmosphere. Visually, its really a special place. It also has a great location, just off the West Side Market, with valet parking and metered spots nearby.What is even BETTER about Crop is that the food matches the beautiful environment. Whether for brunch, lunch, dinner or just desserts, Crop has a wonderful and inventive menu of American fare for every meal. For my lunch, my friend ordered the Mac and Brisket with cavatappi pasta, cheddar and braised brisket...and it was to die for. I kept stealing bites. For lunch, you can always count on the Lobster Roll. Its the buttered brioche roll of your dreams with the most tasty lobster ever. On Saturday, Crop is open until 11pm, so its also a wonderful spot for a fancier late night dinner or espresso and dessert. With great food, great service and a great atmosphere, Crop Bistro is a no-brainer!"}, {"review_id": "HNEu-Ywrl7N4Po_BJ3VmJQ", "user_id": "7bpfBvFhGvTKxU4WH7yyxw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Every bite I ate was delicious.  Every. Single. Bite.Let's start with the pita, crudités and hummus.  This classic, common appetizer was my first inkling that the forthcoming meal was going to be something special.  The flavorful, smooth hummus with the assortment of veggies and house made pita chips was a cut above the typical and I could have been happy making a meal from it.So glad I didn't - because the salad and bread was equally remarkable followed by a pasta in a creamy tomato sauce that was a vegetarian delight!My dinner companions ordered the salmon and the short rib entrees and were equally satisfied.For dessert I had the light as air berry cheesecake- a mousse-like concoction with berries blended into the filling and a sprinkling of graham cracker crumbs on top.Finally, while the building is nondescript on the outside, it opens into a beautifully restored interior that surprises with its expansiveness and retro elegance.  A treat in many ways."}, {"review_id": "oV8tdA3mRPaSoefS_Jq9pg", "user_id": "96LQe8a3liGSUJp0oYftgA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "I booked a table here looking for something interesting and I can confidently say that i found it.First, let's talk about the atmosphere. This is an old bank space that was renovated into a restaurant, so you get unique architecture (including 2+ story ceilings) and a wide open space that is refreshingly different (in a good way). The setting itself is enough to fuel a good amount of conversation, and that's before the food or drinks get there.The food is superb, and has it's own style, different from any of the other places nearby.  Their utilization of local ingredients to make these impressive dishes is a welcome feature. Everything is fresh, and absolutely delicious.The staff were great, and really helped navigate the options and wine pairings. If you're looking for great modern american cuisine, all with a refreshingly unique atmosphere, then look no further."}, {"review_id": "ypmYkwAhRZf9-zzD6rHYDQ", "user_id": "bWoIe5ehjIxOMeElNzXShQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I've found myself here multiple times recently and each has been fantastic!Went to an event they held to show off their event spaces. If anyone is looking for a place to have a company party or rehearsal dinner, this is your place!! Cool vault or modern rooftop bar?! They've got you covered! I came with a group of 10 ladies for a baby shower and everything was perfect. The service could not have been better and everyone was blown away by the food. Deviled eggs and popcorn forever! Highly recommend for any occasion. Happy hour, brunch, dinner, fancy event?

From the exterior, all one can see is the sign of the restaurant attached to a building. I had a lunch meeting here and upon entering, I was astonished to see how beautiful and spacious the interior is. At the time, a Christmas tree was still up and standing at maybe 30ft. I also learned that there was vault within the building that they allowed customers to view on certain occasions. The menu was short, sweet and simple. They offer high quality food that I personally consider are healthy options. The menu included a history of the building, which was interesting to read. The service was wonderful, our waiter was attentive until it got busier, but it was on top of his game nonetheless. I hope to return to such a wonderful business for future brunch meetings."}, {"review_id": "eBHU-2ZE2gchYTAkCbKTvw", "user_id": "v_8IhAUt_vh2WpHLhvG01g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "I came here on a Thursday night to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. We had a 7PM reservation at the Chef's Table for the tasting menu, and it was pretty empty inside when we got there. We basically had the entire Chef's Table to ourselves! We immediately noticed the beautiful ambiance, wide open space and grandeur of the restaurant. Our food was served with attention to timing and service. We were never rushed through any course and our servers explained all of our dishes/wines thoroughly which we appreciated. They even threw in an extra course & wine pairing because the chef made an extra dish by accident. All of the dishes tasted fresh and delicious. It was a really special experience to look into the open kitchen and see our chefs make our meals in front of us. My favorite dish was the HUGE seared scallop; my boyfriend loved the Berkshire pork chop. Overall, the dinner lasted about 1.5 hours and we had an excellent experience. Price for the tasting was very reasonable considering the quality of the food and the wine pairings. I would recommend the chef's tasting to anyone for the value of the experience.We will definitely come here again to try the brunch that is getting rave reviews!"}, {"review_id": "hS2ybMnjct8ZrQdULMUJBg", "user_id": "RylA6VZUTRuMGBu4nHKbCw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/9/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Oddly not busy for a Friday night. From 6-8p there were only a handful of tables full. As I said in a prior review the place is simply gorgeous. The chairs are also very comfortable. Our server was very attentive and friendly and did not rush us. We started with just some wine and were able to just sit and wind down with that before being asked to order. The meal then was nicely paced with two appetizers following the wine. The three cheese board did also come with some pickled veg, two spreads, bread, crackers and some spiced almonds. The deviled eggs were very good as well. There was crisp prosciutto in each one and the yolks were creamy and flavorful from the chile aioli.  I ordered the Faroe Island Salmon ($30) for my main. It was very good and well prepared. It was served on top of a basmati fried rice. The somewhat Asian flavor of the sauce and the base were an excellent addition to the large portion of salmon. I would definitely order this again."}, {"review_id": "PTxwXlLMm5sedKYZzMJ58A", "user_id": "YFdwqCa6ag7DMO6WcDGNwg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Maybe this place used to be something special.   We had the \"tour de crop\", just four courses.  The chef's choice!  We got wedding food (and not like those dope jewish weddings, but like a waspy country club wedding).

This is exactly what Crop Bistro unfortunately did. We came here for a thanksgiving meal. Two slender slices (not even full slices) of turkey, cheap helpings of sides, for $30? You can literally buy an entire organic turkey for that price so we were definitely disappointed. Far from the feeling of satisfaction you get with finishing a thanksgiving dinner, we even ordered appetizers to accompany and left unfulfilled and about $150 broker. Oh yea. Service was severely lacking. We were practically thrown menus and couldn't find our server at 20 min intervals. Almost left to try and pay at the counter.

I'd never been to Crop because it seemed a little stuffy for me - maybe it's that giant bank building location & the slightly elevated prices - but I was wrong. Though it is, yes, in a giant & ornate old bank, with prices a bit higher than I usually go for, it's also totally worth it & not at all stuffy - just a really nice, positive, delicious dining experience. I've been twice now, once just for drinks & another time for lunch. I loooove their Mr. Figgy cocktail - fig-infused Bulleit Bourbon, sweet vermouth, maple bitters, & a giant piece of candied, bruleed bacon. Whoa. For lunch, my mom & I had, between us, two salads & two entrees which we split - the beet salad (so colorful & fresh!), the Brussels sprouts salad (that maple dressing!), the Cropicana bowl (the shredded pork is to die for), & the three-grain bowl (so healthy AND so flavorful). I'm blown away by the flavors, the freshness, the creativity... everything is incredible, from the food to the service to the locale. Only suggestion: Bring a sweater.

It's beautiful. But the acoustics are bad. If you're hard of hearing you'll have a difficult time. Four stars for slow service at the beginning, and we couldn't hear the waitress. We were a party of 14. That number of people should require two servers. Apparently there was a staff shortage, because our waitress seemed to be working a lot of tables. A male waiter saved the day. He kept the water glasses full, served the dishes and cleared the table appropriately. He was very friendly answering questions. But staffing is a manager's concern. We were there one hour too long. Despite a slow start, the food was delicious!  The popular short ribs were not a menu item, but the nightly special. Everyone seemed pleased. The tomato-basil soup was tasty. The beet salad was hardy. The tempura oyster app was good, tho I was expecting the rice batter, and I only tasted an oyster once or twice. The lobster agnolotti needed more lobster, but was good, I was told. The mushroom risotto was the best. So we liked the food. Kind of the manager to give us complimentary desserts due to the long wait time. Save room for all the cakes. They looked divine. I must say that the creme brûlée was the best I've ever had. Nice flavor."}, {"review_id": "fKDQNsWe3iYDHEBDRIOVbw", "user_id": "17M-3SejSZfxeqrtFsBBhw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "Great spot for a special holiday or other special occasion meal.
