Now that I have the SyFy™ portion of this review done, let's get into why this place is so great.  First up, the food is fantastic.  They have a lot of authentic dishes that are great, but also their chimichangas are straight up amazing. Maybe chimichangas are authentic but let's be honest, taking a burrito and frying it sounds pretty American. If I'm not mistaken, taking foreign food and frying it was one of the primary tenets of Manifest Destiny. My favorite thing to get is a veggie burrito wet.  That's a HUGE burrito, stuffed with veggies and then they smother it in enchilada sauce.  It's delicious and I can pretend it is healthy because, you know, veggies.  Their veggies are serious too, I mean the spinach in the spinach enchiladas is fresh spinach.  Here are a few random tidbits that are helpful: for us serious vegetarians, the beans are vegan.  That's right, no pork fat here.  Alcohol is limited, mostly bottled beers.  They may have sangria, I'm not sure.  On the non-alcoholic side, they have Horchata.   Delicious, creamy Horchata. You should try it.  The service is great, the servers work communally so there are tons of people out to help.  The patrons are super diverse, which I love.  If you only go places where everyone looks like you, you're not doing life right.  A good first step: come to El Rio Verde and get a wet burrito."}, {"review_id": "-tApErAoigp0oKxzsx-oRg", "user_id": "qSoQmXAAGZ5bQl7oj9VLDg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "I didn't like this food at all, its tex mex at its lowest.

A new fave, for sure! We went in on a Saturday around 1pm and we're lucky enough to get a table. It's always busy, so try to get here early.You get a basket of chips with delicious, fresh salsa to start. We ordered queso as well. Everyone at our table thought the queso was a little too spicy, but I loved it. It did not seem too hot for me, but I enjoy a bit of heat. I ordered the wet burrito, because it is supposed to be their signature dish. You can choose your meat. I went in for the grilled chicken. It was fabulous! I really enjoyed the fresh and vibrant guacamole on top and the chicken was perfect. My wife got the huevos rancheros, so I sampled her shredded beef, and WOW! It was the best shredded beef I have had in my life. When we go back, I'm going to get the wet burrito with shredded beef. I also sampled the refried beans which were super fresh and homemade. Again, the best I've had.Overall, my new favorite go to for Tex Mex! The prices are reasonable, the service was great despite how busy they were and the food was the best."}, {"review_id": "eQniaLwUhuLCRMyrkSeUlQ", "user_id": "v_VK9rEZg23yMT3eBMIjLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Fresh corn tortillas, fresh guacomole, fresh chips and salsa- in abundance.

No, actually it's the only thing I ever order from here because it's so dang good I don't even care to try anything else but it all looks great judging from the food my hubby has ordered. This place does a great business and be prepared to wait, especially on Sundays. It's usually never a long wait though and they have accounter with stools you can always sit in if you're alone or just with another person and a table is not available. Not in the best area of town but that just does not matter. Clearly one of the best Mexican restaurants in Tulsa"}, {"review_id": "Or40VF9oUKD7GYEBAYa-WQ", "user_id": "6KLVcc9g0tNgdu0fblKsZA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/19/2017", "text": "Driving up to this place, one might think they are going to get robbed or killed. But when arriving you'll be delighted to know that smiles and pretty darn good food as well. Tamarind drinks and tecate. I would recommend the wet burrito with your choice of meat.

Ordered two tacos al pastor and a carne asada taco, side of beans/rice. None of the food had flavor and the tacos al pastor tasted like the pork was just sitting in the back in a pot of sauce. The corn tortillas were also tough. No flavor throughout the meal and certainly not what would be considered authentic...I guess that's what I should have expected from a place known for something called \"the wet burrito.\" The carne asada reminded me of the meat scraps I feed my dog after I consume the good parts of the steak.

LolThe salsa is mild and which I like but you can always ask for spicier.Definitely order some guacamole- super fresh, onions and tomatoes, hint of salt and lime.I like the simple chicken flautas or the Mexican tacos. Try chorizo or chicken, and ask for grilled onions instead of raw for another depth of flavor.If you like agua frescas, order horchata- sweetened rice milk. Sounds weird but it will definitely cool your tongue between spicy bites.If you like original coke in a bottle made with sugar instead of sweetener or corn syrup, order a Mexican coke."}, {"review_id": "DIuxD55Dj_rpT-G3xcKc7A", "user_id": "pKn8jMMtgTKLD9CbdIv7GA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2017", "text": "El Rio Verde is my go-to spot for authentic Mexican fare in Tulsa.
