I've been coming here since my college days and now I've addicted my wife as well. Whenever we pass through Rochester we try to stop for lunch or dinner, especially in the nice weather months so we can sit on the patio and sit with the cute dogs. We have even brought our dog here once for lunch with us! This places serves up specialty hot dogs, it is their thing. Despite that, since I'm in Rochester, i get the garbage plate anyway. I know, i know, for shame. But i can't stay away. I get the split plate with a burger and a dog, on Mac salad and home fries and loaded with everything. It comes with bread and butter on the side. It's exactly the right amount of food for me. They do offer half plates as well, for those who crave the plates but aren't as hungry. They are also super conscious of people's dietary restrictions and offer gluten free buns, veggie dogs, meatless options, etc. They are pretty small inside but they do have the patio. Same goes for the parking, there isn't a ton but they do have the parking lot. There is street parking available too, surrounding the restaurant."}, {"review_id": "Xrf0axewM44DSUyc6kCJQw", "user_id": "-ywI3rE2CGE2cdrPEhNLCA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "When the owners of Dogtown started, they simply wanted to recreate some regional hot dog varieties from around the country. But they didn't stop there. They now offer 18 unique varieties of hot dog toppings on a choice of dogs, nestled in French bread, along with burgers, sandwiches, vegetarian options, and the Rochester favorite - garbage plates.Their bread is locally sourced, fresh daily and hand cut, and they use regional favorite Zweigle's German Franks, longer and skinnier than other franks, they claim it's a perfect fit for their buns and toppings. They don't offer the usual Rochester hot meat sauce, but a sweeter Cincinatti style chili.I stopped into Dogtown today during a run for work. They had great Yelp reviews, so I figured I'd give them a try. The restaurant is set back from the street on a very hip main drag in the city. It's a very small place with only a couple tables inside with some outside tables as well, a divey style decor to it on the inside.I checked out their menu which definitely has a good amount of choices on it. All hot dogs are named after a breed of dog, and I went with the Pit Bull, a frank covered in their chili, BBQ sauce and peppers and onions, along with a side of sweet potato fries.There was a small line when I walked in about 11:15 AM, but it moved quickly. The employees were nice enough and brought my food over to me when it was ready. It was made pretty quickly, probably less than 10 minutes after I ordered. Relatively cheap as well, as a dog, side and can of soda came to less than $10.The sweet potato fries were very good. Crispy outside, tender inside, and sprinkled with a tiny bit of sugar to make the sweetness pop. The dog was clearly not a pick up and eat dog, so I knif and forked it, but I wasn't too impressed with it. While it's nice having the local fresh split sub rolls, they're far too big for the frank, and the bread/dog ratio just didn't work for me. The chili was ok, but too sweet for my taste, and the hot dog was just a dog to me.Nothing was bad, but with such high reviews, I expected the best hot dog I've ever had in my life, and that just wasn't the case. If you're looking for a quick, cheap lunch, this will satisfy you, and you'll have plenty of topping options to choose from. It was good enough, just missed the mark for me personally."}, {"review_id": "WGVhWB8jsOw-kLK5gkeIhA", "user_id": "PH02kJ4nz7DuHJSR9JcrzQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "All my life I've lived in Rochester but never been to Dogtown, so tonight I decided to try it. Oh. My. GOODNESS! I've been missing out on a gem for YEARS! We walked in at 8 on a Thursday, so it was fairly busy. Our food did not take long at all considering the amount of people who were here. I usually like my hot dogs pretty plain, but I had to try some of that chili sauce. I got the Cincinnati which comes with cheese, and this DELICIOUS, thick bread as a bun. When I tell you this hot dog was bursting with flavor.....it saved my week. Actually, it saved my life. They also have all the condiments you could possibly need. My bf got the Philly cheesesteak and a golden retriever with no cheese which were also both incredible. All of this food plus a bottled water was about $15. Amazing."}, {"review_id": "nTJmqp0hqTZu59RZVogQ2w", "user_id": "nQE96j0z3aEqrjjeaa88-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "I love everything about Dogtown. Having a menu named after different dog breeds is adorable and genius. They are able to turn simple hotdogs into filling and delicious meals with all of their well-paired toppings! The \"Pitbull\" was hearty and the \"Flynn\" (named after this years Westminster Best in Show winner) was refreshing. The prices are excellent, and the place has such a cozy vibe!Second time we went, we did the garbage plates: one split plate and one split veggie plate. They were EXCELLENT. I think about them like at least once a day. Will definitely be going back for more."}, {"review_id": "9hmjMWQAUKb5_8TYSqp1-w", "user_id": "viuTB5LLlU3KjQwTF7rNXQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Hands down, Dogtown has the best fast food in Rochester! Some would say that to call it \"fast food\" is an injustice. But fast food it is: high quality burgers, creatively topped dogs, plates, and other hot sandwiches... and I've never waited more than 5-10 minutes for my food. They have a great thing going!Their 20 or so hotdog options are some of the most creative I've ever seen. Named with witty dog puns, some of my favorites are the \"Fido Castro\" (with bacon, coleslaw, cheddar, and a pickle), the \"St. Bernard\" (sour kraut, mustard, and Swiss), or any special of the day. And the ROLLS! All dogs are served on locally-made crusty French bread. Mmm!Vegetarians will be happy to find a full section of veg options on the menu. The soup of the day is also vegetarian, and they are always quite good! I have a soft spot for their sweet potato fries (with cinn sugar!) and their crunchy onion rings. Rochester is known for the garbage plate, and to send a newbie anywhere else to try one would be a shame! While I've found plates from other establishments to be grease pools, lacking in flavor, Dogtown's are substantial, full of texture and well-seasoned. I prefer mine with home fries and Mac salad; the house made meat sauce is awesome too.Everyone I've ever brought to Dogtown, over my last 10 years living in Rochester, has loved it. My dad, after many times moving me into a new apartment, always requests Dogtown. My fiancé, after a night out, picks Dogtown over pizza. My former boss (a vegetarian) brings her kids here. It's the best. Always good music playing. Adorable pet pics on the walls. And a great patio in the warmer months. I've never left Dogtown unsatisfied!"}, {"review_id": "yC1g6nNn0q3l8uwELU7Lpg", "user_id": "IwlN3gbUFrFtN3x_pp7JJQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "I almost never eat garbage plates so when I was craving one last weekend I wanted the best of the best.

I went pretty classic with my plate, cheeseburgers, Mac salad/homefries, and \"everything\" plus ketchup on top. I'm picky about the ratio of Mac salad to fries but Dogtown's combo was perfect! The meat hot was flavorful but not overpowering, the potatoes were well cooked, and even the bread was fresh.

I'm not a vegetarian by any means but thought it was nice they had a diverse menu. Their portions are large and are very filling. If you go and aren't that hungry I would recommend splitting your meal. I tried the Mexican dog and was not disappointed. My brother in law had a garbage plate which he had a hard time finishing so I got to help him finish it. I loved the mac salad-probably my favorite part of the plate.

It starts with friendly service, an easy to read menu complete with descriptions. We ordered 3 German Shepard dogs, a side of fries and a side of Mac salad. It was all delicious. The dogs we got were their veggie option and they were very good, the flavors were fresh and the size was plentiful, ended up taking one of them home. The Mac salad is some of the best I have had in Rochester and I've lived here most of my life.  The French fries were crispy and flavorful, couldn't get enough of them. The prices are really cheap, for everything we got it was $18 and that is with the .50 cent up charge on the three veggie hot dogs, so if we ordered properly, ie two dogs instead of 3, it would have only been $14.

Turns out - this \"meat sauce\" is actually exactly like Cincinnati chili. It's sweet and a little runny. I felt bad for the table because they waited for me to be shocked that fries, mustard and onions, hot dogs, and their so called \"meat sauce\" were all thrown together but in reality I was just thinking... this is literally just a hot dog and chili cheese fries with mac salad on the side!I really enjoyed how crispy the fries were. The chili had a ton of flavor. I could've done without the burger it was pretty bland. And the mac salad was just OK for me, and so much so I couldn't eat it after I hoovered the fry situation.I enjoyed the experience of hanging with the locals at a hometown fav out on the picnic tables. And I really enjoyed my garbage plate (until about an hour later when I thought I was going to die because I ate too much).

I feel like most people who are familiar with the Rochester food scene know about this place, but I'm always excited when I find out someone hasn't been here before because that means I get to introduce them to the greatest hot dog of their lives.I'm not being hyperbolic -- this is the BEST hot dog I have ever had. Everything about it is magical. I usually order the Golden Retriever, which is a dog smothered in cheddar with bacon underneath. The bread is listed as locally sourced on their website, and I believe I remember hearing it was from Martusciello's (correct me if I'm wrong). All of the dogs are Zweigle's, too. The bread really is the standout amount all of the amazing ingredients, though. I am a true blue carb lover and you can't go wrong with this bread -- it's a thick roll that's toasted just perfectly and tastes so good!I also order the home fries as a side because they are full of flavor and always served perfectly crispy. The seasoning is so good and sometimes I find myself craving them more than I am the actual hot dog. The fries are also a great option, but I highly recommend the home fries for a bit more flavor.Overall, Dogtown is my favorite place for affordable, delicious eats. A dog and home fries plus a drink will cost you under $10, obviously even less if you just got the dog (which is more than enough food for most people, you'll definitely leave full and satisfied). The parking lot can get a bit hectic and the seating area is small, so if you're a first-timer I recommend going during a slower time (mid-afternoon). Also, you might want to check out the menu online first because they have a ton of options, and while they have a big menu on the wall at the entrance, if you go at a busier time it might help to know what you want to order beforehand.Oh, one last thing -- this place is also vegetarian-friendly, all dogs can be replaced with a veggie dog and they have meatless entrees as well."}, {"review_id": "RGin4qZ6jCOim7pf7coYQg", "user_id": "gf9iH5G2ehp0MRTlVLFT8Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "Delicious juicy hotdogs this small little location which is basically a hole in the wall type place no offense but most people wouldn't stop by unless they knew what there were missing they have so many combinations of topping is hard to chose from the staff was friendly and recommended so good choices"}, {"review_id": "lgdSGf7WLilz9G4vKw9jJg", "user_id": "VqCx0LwYmrT7NE1P_mU9mA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/13/2017", "text": "VEGETARIAN HOT DOGS AND GARBAGE PLATES!
