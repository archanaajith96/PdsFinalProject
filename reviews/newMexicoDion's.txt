The only trouble is that when I order for pick-up or to go I often get something incorrect. This past visit, I asked for all Greek dressings, get home and I have all ranch. The orders really need to be checked before they bag them or when they hand them off and allow the customer time to check before they disappear."}, {"review_id": "CsyB9k97QmjJ5pnteVqZbQ", "user_id": "1MBqjM63jt-i06qTmeUaXA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "Completely obsessed with the salads and pizza here.

My favorite is a slice of tomato and jalapeño pizza with a side of ranch, and the spinach crunch salad with no mushrooms and honey mustard. The garlic bread is also very good. They are always very prompt, friendly and delicious.If you aren't from NM, you gotta try it. Dip your pizza in the world's best ranch dressing. And take a bottle home. Because you won't find better ranch anywhere!"}, {"review_id": "ze9eeRS4exW9EjdGU96V6g", "user_id": "etKEobMRNkxiefV5SKcU0A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2017", "text": "I order lunch here every so often because it's near where I work. Service is alright, I've had one person seem annoyed when I asked for napkins at the drive thru (called in an order to go) however the food has always been great!

I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here or at any of the Dion's locations. Their pizza's are good, their salads are good, their subs are good &  even their sweet tea/lemonade is good! You can pretty much order anything on their menu and be pleased. I highly recommend Dion's if you're traveling from out of town and don't forget to throw green chile onto your pizza or sub!"}, {"review_id": "KymLYIWCVY6SK-ZXkJihrQ", "user_id": "EcJ6y5vYkNELMlg5WDI-jA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2015", "text": "So so so so so good! Living in Colorado, Dion's is a must stop when I go home. My favorite thing on the menu? Greek Salad!!! Between how good the Salad is, and the homemade Greek Dressing, you can NEVER go bad!

Their Ranch dressing is to die for.  Cant wait until they open more and more locations in Colorado!"}, {"review_id": "00O7vGHRJuPSZoqgvnWmVg", "user_id": "4B7s0IvKszRuQkrWbW36VA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/18/2015", "text": "I tried a new item today... the Tuscany.

Plus, it's one of the few places I've found that carries Cherry Coke - bonus!"}, {"review_id": "yGOFAa2o-opTUEjIrWY6ig", "user_id": "xQgJruX5inw1cGR3rcJnGw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/26/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I've seen this place and other locations do far better on busier days/nights with less screw ups. How many times do three different people have to ask for a table to be cleaned off? Or to have plates put out? Or napkins? And why did our order come in at nearly 40 minutes yet all three orders behind us were within 20 minutes, with larger orders? It isn't adding up and with the grand total of nearly 40 minutes wait on a six-inch sandwich, a half-chef salad and two slices of pizza, it is not acceptable service. Additionally, we took note of the manager who was asked for clean tables; she spent nearly five minutes each time looking for someone else to do it. Update (22/23 February 2016)The issues mentioned in this review have been addressed and I as expect, taken care of. Thanks to Dion's corporate."}, {"review_id": "mlP6HSKgb6QhqB0TEVZMKA", "user_id": "rOyEWMbXOXEbkQNVEQ0VdA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/7/2016", "text": "Love Dion's.

If you don't like it, then you must not like pizza.  It just a great combination of crust, cheese and seasonings that come together for something great.  Not too greasy, not too thin, and good amount of toppings.  Never been disappointed with it.  And the green chile is such a great must add to your pizza!  Also the sandwiches are great as well.  The turkey, roast beef and the new italian are all delicious.  Cant go wrong with any of them.  Don't forget to get a small container of greek dressing for your sandwich.  Of the Dion's ranch for your pizza!  (peeps say that the Dion's ranch is the best they have tasted, and i have to agree)"}, {"review_id": "yJJMqU2ymvRa35J2-wmVbQ", "user_id": "XGPaFUDPDU8-7Ra34KxOzA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/2/2016", "text": "I've tried Dion's a few times, and each time I feel a little sick.  We've ordered pizza, sandwiches, and salads.  I prefer Village Pizza in Corrales!"}, {"review_id": "qyoXC7BkerkAAtjBXbhQlg", "user_id": "NjLCE8ZiQSLRxL1nvDrJ-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/3/2016", "text": "Best sub sandwich, pizza & Salads."}, {"review_id": "EsyT82Z75Fx7MtkZPXG-1g", "user_id": "p9yHUXmrGStVokk9uOFVxg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/3/2016", "text": "The pepperoni pizza is fantastic.  You'll notice their pizza has more Italian seasoning than other brands.  I think that's what makes it stand out from other pizzas that are just crust, tomato sauce cheese and pepperoni.  Their own ranch dressing is also thicker and more flavorful than ANY other brand you can find.  We also tried the Duke City pizza that had green chili. It was just OK.  It didn't have any sauce, just cheese, chile and sliced turkey.
