The restaurant is small and intimate with the chef preparing your tacos feet away from your table. Chips and salsa are provided, but be careful because the salsa is hot! Ask for the mild if you are not a fan of spicy. El Camino Real's street tacos are delicious and cheap at about a $1.50 a taco. The corn tortillas are homemade and the meat has great flavor. I love chicken flautas, so any chance I get I order them. I did not love the chicken flautas here because they lacked flavor. They consisted of chicken wrapped in a corn tortilla and fried. I mean that is what a flauta is, but most flautas I have tried are stuffed with jalapeños, onions, peppers, etc. Despite me being disappointed with the flautas, I will return for their street tacos."}, {"review_id": "8I8YpfybuVSMe4-QoTTuBw", "user_id": "QZ8qKlrrDA0gyNE1XDkA0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Ate here last Saturday and the al pastor tacos were amazing and had some of their guacamole and it was very delicious!

It was a Tuesday and we wanted tacos. However, we decided to get jazzy. No Taco Bell or tacos from On the Border. We wanted the authentic stuff. And you know what that means around here. We had to head to KCK. One of my friends suggested this place stating it was definitely authentic. The joint was a standard eat-in Mexican restaurant with several tables strewn around and the meats were grilled right at the front of the restaurant right by the window so you could see all of the magic happen. We were greeted by waters and chips and salsa. Perfect for my starving friends who were eager to nosh on something. I ordered 3 tacos. Pretty much the same ones I order at all authentic Mexican restaurants - 2 al pasteurs and 1 carne asada. I was not disappointed. Each taco had so much meat. I was pretty much able to make 6 tacos since each one comes with double tortilla. Bring on the chopped onions, cilantro, wedge of lime and I was good to go. The meats didn't even need the assistance of salsa. I washed everything down with a nice big cup of horchata.

I love mom and pop places and fully support them but the reviews are far from true or this place is going downhill fast.I got 4 pastor tacos and 2 steak wth cheese. The cilantro and onions are placed on the side so you can do it yourself. I have also been interested in chili rellenos recently and got that as well.Everything is cooked right in front by the entrance (loved that) but all staff seemed to not know what gloves are. Hands in everything and not much washing of them. Service blah I reminded her of a few things. Meat for tacos were dry. Pastor didn't come with pineapple I had to ask for them. Flavorless and I mean like nothing to taste but cheese. No salt or anything. I'm sad it's super authentic and no flavor! My chile still had the toothpicks in it. Ugh couldn't take it out before it landed in my mouth?? I seen a small room in the back which, I highly suggest, should be covered by something. That room alone would close the doors of this place. Lastly the area has a weird feel. Barely anyone walking around parking is bad.I'm sorry I just wouldn't come back here.

The cabeza (cow cheeks) are my second favorite, I know it sounds weird, but you got to try... you might like!  Not only is all the food cooked in front of you instead of served in a buffet steamer, they make their own fresh tortillas. The tacos will come with cilantro and onions on the side. It was lacking the array of vegetables and sauces that  some of the taquerias have, but the taste of the tacos make up for it."}, {"review_id": "TPOz9Y6cMI6pPdZkEZg3Jg", "user_id": "vNxGy9CvyQxrV1kqRChhIQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/28/2017", "text": "Taquerias seem to be pretty popular in KC and El Camino Real was the first I've been to. The tacos were great. I ordered 4 tacos each with a different type of meat. I liked that you could see the cook making the tacos in the front of the restaurant too. I highly recommend the carnitas taco, which was my favorite of the four. Some of the aspects of my experience that were lacking begins with the fact that this restaurant could use a facelift. Not that it is unclean, but they seem to do a good business which could fund some renovations. Next, we only were given one basket of chips and the \"salsa\" was in a squeeze bottle. In Spanish, \"salsa\" means \"sauce\" but at every Mexican restaurant I have been to, the hot sauce is different from the actual salsa which was not the case here. Finally, the only toppings for our tacos were cilantro and onion. These two toppings are quite typical for \"street tacos\", but if you're looking for cheese or lettuce, you're not going to get that here."}, {"review_id": "80Ci5DF_8R1DOvIy5Mo9fg", "user_id": "Q3LIoKf_jpVXlm4mo5vxsw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "I've eaten here a couple of times.

I got street tacos which were very tasty and a side of beans and rice. My son got chicken enchiladas in green sauce which was absolutely delicious. I loved that you got a bottle of mild and hot salsa along with onion, lime and cilantro to season your salsa and everything else on your plate. Overall the food was delicious. The downsides were I did notice that no one including the cook was wearing gloves which is awkward in today's world to see someone handling your food (including meat) with their bare hands. I found myself having to ask for a refill of drinks and chips, and my beans and rice which were forgotten. The place was not busy (2 other tables seated) and only had one person waiting on tables but I felt like she only came to my table when I asked her to. She sat at another table with her family and ate between serving. I'm not sure she ever spontaneously stopped by to see how things were. Food was very good but was really offset by the service and bare hands used to handle food. ):"}, {"review_id": "6ECHNofR7IDDi_ONTrlsRA", "user_id": "-IwwvFGNyYH4EW7aoe5LTA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/1/2017", "text": "Lunch on a Thursday and I ain't driving.

The cilantro they serve also had a lot of stem pieces which Im not a big fan off and I noticed several brown parts which is a turn off for me.
