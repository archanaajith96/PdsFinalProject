That's extremely rare to me, but this is one of those places. MSM (while I'm sure they would be happy to see a good review) just seems to me like they don't need the validation, if they even had the time to review the reviews. What I'm sure they would prefer more is two more days in the week just so they could catch up. By all means, I am not suggesting any arrogance, I'm just complimenting the fact you can go into MSM on a Sunday evening and they would be busy.  I drive a half an hour one way for my sub sandwich fix at MSM so there is little point for me to continue the typical sales pitch of why this place is so great, but here is a quick rundown.The sandwiches are huge, the bread is the kind of bread sandwiches should come on, and it's delicious. The contents of the sandwich are not skimpy, in fact its packed with meats and cheeses.My suggestion if you are visiting with others, get two different sandwiches and split them!what I like most: hands down the best old sub sandwich shop aroundwhat I liked least: seating is extremely limited, cold and solitude in the back, and distance from my house."}, {"review_id": "wSbUoRHXUb6cRvRE8jWxtQ", "user_id": "aBBSAgCyfUvfol9nvEkngA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/14/2017", "text": "I can always count on MSM Deli for consistency!My Usual:Mikes deluxe TOASTED!The bread is always fresh and never stale. There amount of meat and toppings are always the same which I appreciate. There is nothing more disappointing when you get a monster sandwich, only to find out it was like that because one specific person makes it that way. Not here! Staff: 5 starsThey are always nice and approachable guys. They make you feel like you're a regular if when it's your first time. Service: 5 starsThey are fast and the best part, if you plan on going during lunch hour, you can call ahead and order to avoid the lines."}, {"review_id": "TAObeq9M-mUcJPLV2n18SA", "user_id": "6oubYKWkiBAihedoBdPPKQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Love the food and people and been going for years but very disappointed on how my sandwich was made.

This hole-in-a-wall deli joint offers a variety of sandwiches such as East Coast style cold cuts, pita wraps, French dip, reuben, and custom-made sandwiches. There are four different sandwich sizes - 6-inch, 9-inch, 13-inch, and 26-inch.***Mike's Deluxe (French roll piled high with roast beef, turkey, ham, swiss & cheddar, lettuce, sprouts, onions, tomatoes, pickles, mustard and mayo - 9-inch for $6.99): Sounds like a pretty boring sandwich right? Oh don't let these ingredients fool you - sometimes all you want for a great sandwich is the right combination of ingredients and not the fanciest ingredients. Lettuce was fresh and something about the meat just made this a very tasty sandwich. I chowed down the entire sandwich like a true champ.***While I don't think it was the best sandwich I have ever had in my entire life, MSM Deli makes the sandwich the right way and I highly recommend to give this small deli joint a try if you are near the Tacoma area."}, {"review_id": "bi7EFR6-PYUTNCtrRvPijA", "user_id": "n4rMrZIL8s1OtJxQay0H4w", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Over the years,I've eaten Reuben sandwiches at many different restaurants....yesterday at msm deli..I got one to go.

My boyfriend swears by the meatball sub, and I've heard their deli club is also good.  This place is usually always busy but they do take orders via phone so you can always call in your order ahead of time.  They sell your basic chips and soda but also have a very good wine and beer selection.  A few tables in the front and back of the shop to sit and enjoy your sandwich or you can take it to go.  I will continue to enjoy my MSM sandwiches for as long as I'm in the area."}, {"review_id": "tHZ_3hYqI8djo4H1WTF8oA", "user_id": "utreDdTABJoB6iZJeAGdEA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/4/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Just a bland sandwich made with cheap deli meat.
