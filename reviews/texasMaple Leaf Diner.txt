The blueberry cream cheese scone is absolute perfection--crumbly scone, smooth creamy filling. The lemon delight cookie is just that ... delightful! Perfect cookie consistency with a sweet and tart lemon finish.

We arrived around 10:50 and there was already a line with at least 10 tables in front of us. That place was definitely booming. It took about 45 minutes prior to getting seated. So we used this time wisely and scoped out what food pictures appeared on Yelp by my fellow Yelpers so that we could order when we sat down. And plus I had a sleeping baby in the car, so I didn't want to disturb him at ALL! Once we got seated, we asked for a highchair which was readily available. Our waitress was so friendly and nice. We ordered a chicken and waffles, the French toast trio, and the chicken sandwich. All of which tasted really good. We managed to finish all of them, but we were pretty full. I even fed some chicken, French toast, and strawberries to the baby and he liked them. The service was quick and we got our foods within 15 minutes or less it seemed. There was a table sitting next to us that was done eating and was just sitting and talking. One of the hosts asked politely if they needed anything else before asking if it was ok for them to give up their table for future parties, which is understandable. Even when we left by 1:30, the line never died. I would come back, but perhaps not for a weekend brunch."}, {"review_id": "o3vm-14vEtPg9rLyKCIoRg", "user_id": "6VGc_1stJa6Rpq875QRHoA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Definitely expect to wait at least 45 mins for brunch on the weekends if you get here after 11:00am. But totally worth the wait! We started with putting in two orders of what we thought  was going to be fresh squeezed orange juice. Sadly, it tasted like Minute Maid, which was disappointing. The hubs and I ordered one savory (Canadian Eggs Benedict) and one sweet dish (French Toast & Strawberries) to share. The sauce on the Eggs Benedict was absolutely delicious! I could see why the waitress said this was her favorite dish. It comes with home fries which were decent; but, the hubs was wondering if they used fresh potatoes. Let's get to the best part... the French Toast! This is the best French Toast I've ever had, and I've had a ton of French Toast in my lifetime. This French Toast was so soft, no crunch or overly cooked ends here. The flavor was mouth watering... there are hints of cinnamon and the perfect amount of sweetness from the cream in the batter. Bites of this dish was like taking bites of heaven. Highly, highly recommend!! The service was fast and caring. Christina M. was our waitress. Even though she was swamped, she was courteous and super fast! I was impressed with how fast she got our order in and even more impressed with how fast our food came out. She was attentive and sweet. If you're lucky enough to get a table in her section, you'll be in good hands. Thank you, Christina, for making our visit such a good one!"}, {"review_id": "kTqeruuOJZaauuwSE8Bg-A", "user_id": "KZhGcadbHNZzJ5gOSdvmRQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I loved this place!

The bacon was crispy, the chicken was crispy and flavored really well, and the waffles were really good with the strawberries, butter, and powdered sugar that they put on top. Slap some syrup on it and it's golden.Chicken Parm - I didn't get to taste this, but it could've fed a small family and the hubs said it was good so I believe him. We went during dinner time on a Tuesday and there were only about 3 other tables occupied.

The establishment is well laid out, very well illuminated and features quite a lot of Canadian flair. Funny that again Dallas features a restaurant of high repute from someplace very far away. Canada, NYC, these are all quite distant. I had the French Toast with Strawberries and it was just as others on Yelp describe, delightful! As a hilarious side note, they provided a jug of syrup, a giant jug.

The food is good but the long wait is what prevents me from going more often. The place is too small and people want to chat over a cup of coffee. My first time here we felt so rushed when they started picking up our plates and utensils. It's not a good place for groups. I had the French toast and honestly I had better French toast on the carnival cruise line. Not a long wait for food. It's not bad but it's better than IHOP. For a pancake, waffle plate and French toast plate with 3 orange juice it was $45.

We had a party of 4 and a wait around 30 minutes at 11 AM. We ordered the Chicken and Waffles and the Canadian Eggs Benedict. Like other reviewers mentioned, Chicken and Waffles were definitely the way to go! The chicken was perfectly seasoned and fried and there was a good chicken to waffle ratio. The Chicken and Waffles also came with bacon and a cream puff on top- YUM! Canadian Eggs Benedict was good but nothing super special. The house fries that came with the Benedict were a little raw- too much potato and wasn't crispy enough. If they made those crispier and with more seasoning, they would be much better! The portions were pretty large and the food was good. If you're into good food and non-bougie brunches- this spot is for you!"}, {"review_id": "3NkPBUNlM2q7AHvPR0ALgA", "user_id": "wrI6h523BcCaUopCKHDJkg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "We came here for breakfast on a thursday and it was packed. Even though they were super busy our server was incredibly attentive and our food came out quickly. Service here is fantastic. This place is a good place to go with groups and if you just  want a comfortable environment to chat and get full. The reason it gets 2 stars is because the food was just \"meh\". I got the Canadian bacon and eggs Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was nice and the eggs were poached perfectly. The English muffin was soggy and the potatoes tasted like they were frozen before with no seasoning. Husband got the chicken and waffles and it had the same problem. Soggy waffles and bacon was just okay. However he did say that the fried chicken was good and the syrup was high quality. I can see why other people would like this place but it's just not for us. 4/5 ambiance5/5 Service 2/5 food"}, {"review_id": "aI6v5nhHhNc1qftNInhriw", "user_id": "0MvhBWSBhdnBaw3N56OT8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "This place was wonderful.

I figured people would not be out and about.  WOW was I wrong!  The line inside was a 45 minute wait which just gave all a chance to dry off before they seated you.  The long line had all plotting on which entrees they would have as we all stared down the wait staff carrying delectable items out to starving patrons.  We wildly discussed what this or that could be!Finally it was our turn to get seated.  We walked past a gorgeous wall of various colored plates.  Near the middle was a Moose head.  Well, this is a Canadian themed restaurant.  It did go along with the Canadian Maple Leaf Flag, and other assorted Canadian items decorating the walls.  And before the PETA supports get riled up, it was not real and only about 6 inches in size. The place was VERY busy and servers were zipping around everywhere with huge concoctions  stacked upon plates and bowls.  Finally getting a menu in hand helped translate what Canadian delicacies was being served.  I had to go for the chicken, bacon and waffles with an order of Poutine (pronounced pu-tin as I was later corrected).  Ooh what horrible American I was, eh?Ooh the Poutine came out first and the brown gravy was amazing!  I should have just asked for a liter of the gravy! (see?  Keeping it Canadian, eh?).  It was a great appetizer for the chicken and waffles.  They were carted out to the table and one could argue a crane was needed to lift it.  Calling it huge, is an absolute understatement.  It looks like a meal for 3.  It has strawberries and real whipped cream sandwiched between hearty sized Belgian waffles with delicious chicken strips stacked on top with more cream and strawberries under them. Then it is covered with thick long strips of maple infused bacon.  How else could one top that off, eh? So they do, with cream puffs skewered to help hold this mountain of food together!  We are talking REAL maple syrup was brought out.  I think that was magic syrup, as it helped me eat every morsel of that meal. Yes, the meal for three was in my belly.  I was debating if I could even rise from the table, eh?  The menu is amazing and the creations it contains is definitely worth 20 more trips here to try most of them.  The price was within reason for great witty service, amazing food and the experience!   It is worth the wait if the line is long, seriously!"}, {"review_id": "8HW_p8nqFXDox5vfn-dX3w", "user_id": "sm5XcJ7iWJxbLYkL3yxkrQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "The food is really good here!
