It's almost identical to Cracker Barrel. I kind of wonder if that was intentional or whether the owners get annoyed by the comparison.I ordered a breakfast, which consisted of 3 eggs, 3 sausage links, hash browns, and biscuits & gravy. It was SO MUCH FOOD. It was nothing spectacular, but the price was great for the amount of food. The hash browns were excellent so that's really all I can ask for.Our server was very polite and attentive."}, {"review_id": "DPiV4GRdFr1X58swpPOvhQ", "user_id": "OfTKbgVvBts2iAcw35EMpg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Maybe an off day but not great.

The Machine Shed is definitely on our rotation. In short, it is a slightly more authentic version of Cracker Barrel with better food and service.  Much better food and service.A few other reviewers have noted that it is part of a chain. Not sure you can call it a chain; I have seen two others though. Someone called the decor 'dated', and well, there's a lot of wood, it's pretty plain, I mean, it's the Illinois Machine Shed? What are you expecting?  I'm just glad there aren't sickles hanging down from the ceiling like in 'Children of the Corn'. Think of it this way; you can go to a fancy $$$ place that advertises 'locally sourced' cuisine.  Well, isn't that what we have here, sort of?  Certainly the Shed specializes in Midwestern food: beef, chicken, pork, bakery? Portions are hearty and served to order. Their burgers rival so-called quality burger spots; their pork products rival many so-called barbecue joints. Their pork chops are quite good. So if you travelling and want to go to Cracker Barrel or Texas Roadhouse, might I suggest going here instead? Your food will be better, and you won't feel like you're part of a warped marketing experiment.  If you are local, and haven't been here in awhile, maybe you don't like meat? And if so, how are you surviving in Rockford? Must be difficult."}, {"review_id": "EuyfzLFsGAxY6XoFXROnwQ", "user_id": "Ii_EJzZVAQdzuGarka4ZJg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "This is a great country home restaurant.

Seems like a older dinger Cracker Barrel. We were there for breakfast and it was OK at best. Nothing was memorable. It wasn't dirty but I felt like  I needed to wash my hands as soon as I left, The attached store was kinda cool, I dont think I would go back. Some of the dinner dishes sounded interesting, but I fear they would not live up to the menu descriptions. I don't know why but it seems like a 2nd rate Cracker Barrel"}, {"review_id": "omGuXCMpRNWsDjvDgEurjg", "user_id": "MdmGrKzlhG-m4_ckMYx2Vw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "A Rockford Landmark.

It was $19.99 and comes with 2 sides. Which by the way their portions are huge! After you order, they also have complimentary fixin's which includes shareable of coleslaw, cottage cheese, and a bread basket that includes rolls and banana bread.  We didn't want to each too much of it since we were anticipating eating our main entree, so we ended up taking the complimentary fixin's home. The prime rib was very tender and flavorful. It also comes with a dipping side of au jus. It was flavorful, but a bit more on the salty side in my opinion. I believe on Fridays & Saturdays they have smoked prime rib.I'd go back and try other things on their menu. Nothing like some home cooked style meals when you don't want to cook at home."}, {"review_id": "nKRQrqqWTSUtOshFcfAzaA", "user_id": "CuV9XG04ndpwdMDv0K4vBw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Food seems to have changed quality.
