I had been here for lunch, brunch, and dinner, but never their Happy Hour. They have a variety of items for you to choose from. They have a bar when you first walk in, but they also have lot of tabels that extended all the way to the back. Tried their pizza once before (price ranges from $11 - $23, depending of the portion and flavorings), they allow you to split the pizza in half and get up to 2 flavors. I ordered half prosciutto white and half chicken pesto. Although the amount of meat they put on the pizza were a bit sad, but the flavoring of both were fairly decent, afterall they are known for their pizza. I had tried the caesar salad $8.50 during lunch and the seared tuna + greens $18 during brunch. The caasar salad was surprisingly good for that price. The seared tuna + greens was a much smaller portion than I expected, had to steal some food from my boyfriend after the salad. I was quite disappointed with it since for that price, I could have gotten the Cast Iron Steak + Eggs $15 (which my boyfriend and his buddy got) and it would have been much filling. Since I tried some of my boyfriend's steak and eggs, I would say that dish was definitely worth the price $15.  Overall, I would recommend this place if you are in Chinatown and looking for a $$ priced restuarnt. This place can get expensive, depending on what you order and when you come. I would defintely want to try their Happr Hour one day, the appetizers prices ranges from $5 to $7 and their drinks are $5 draft and $7 wine and cocktail. Just to keep in mind, Chinatown parking is chaotic most of the time, local street parking might be hard to find and the parking lots are expensive in this area. Highly suggest you uber here if you live in the city!"}, {"review_id": "gil_22pnD1xWckXUIainPQ", "user_id": "wfAWCZhsy6eody26GU_4hw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Sheesh. My wife went on and on about how awesome this place was when she and a coworker frequented this restaurant ten years ago, so we tried it.Not a huge wait time on a Sunday evening, even with a hockey game in town, so they get a star for that.We were seated after a half hour, and then had to wait a full 15 minutes before our server came to check on us.When we ordered finally, the sliders came out overcooked.Also... they used to have smoked gouda on but that's been cut apparently.Dry burgers on brioche buns, a pickle. That's it.Not really good. The pizza came and wasn't good. The crust was like a soggy cracker and tough as hell at the edges.Scant toppings.Really... if you heard this was a great restaurant, expect a \"barely passable\" meal at a rather exorbitant price point.I'd pass on this place in the future, honestly."}, {"review_id": "eTCHz_KwJ4q3KTLJX32hPQ", "user_id": "IMeJlq_L_Vq5LY8nLUYnsQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Great happy hour price until 7PM.

I came in and was greeted by the sight of a large bar with TVs. It was filled with customers, but I eventually was able to get to the hostess desk. However, I found it odd that I was seated in the back of the restaurant towards the kitchen on the first floor. I asked to change seats, which I was allowed to do, but I ended up being given a seat in a very dark area. Eventually, I did find a seat that was good for the party. Once we were there, our waitress came over and took our drink orders. Unfortunately, I felt that they didn't have the greatest variety of drinks available on the menu. However, I ended up getting a glass of orange juice. Eventually, we placed our appetizer orders. I went with the simple salad. It came out in a timely fashion, but it was presented in a bowl, which was odd. Further, it was about the size of a side salad rather than an appetizer. The only other option they had available was an entree size salad. The simple salad was pretty good with a light, but fitting vinaigrette dressing. The cherry tomatoes and grated cheese were also a nice touch. The tomatoes were sweet and the grated cheese added a balance of flavor.For my entree, I went with the shrimp linguine, which came with a side of garlic bread. The shrimp was firm, but not too  and the linguine had a tasty and flavorful cream sauce on it, but they topped it off with way too much pepper, which made it a bit too spicy and sort of hard to enjoy. Others noted in their party that their entrees were pretty spicy. The garlic toast had a nice, hard outside while the inside was moist and tasty. They offered dessert, but I politely declined and got some gelato at Dolcezza instead. Also, they have great chocolate mints at the front, which were superb! The server was polite and kind. She also gave some useful descriptions about the food.Altogether, this place is fine with above average food and friendly staff, but nothing too special."}, {"review_id": "ka8-U-7Q_itreKXtwjS26g", "user_id": "MKRti9lD-uDUPDRTH2jtzA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Always solid every single time. The pizza is flavorful, perfectly thin, and has a wonderful char on it. I like to change it up a bit so ordered the spicy meatball plus an addition of ricotta cheese -- adds a nice creamy flavor to the pizza. Even a small is way too much, so be prepared for delicious leftovers the next day (or a few hours later when you get home). This time, my friend and I also tried the spinach dip. Overall, it was good and lots of toasted bread for dipping... but in hindsight, perhaps a little carb overload. Good thing we had some sangria to wash it down!"}, {"review_id": "eMi9jQZl37r8bcKYGbqKqw", "user_id": "4CfHE0LDwgqHQ5W73tguOg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "The wait staff was good. The crab and avocado dip was really good and there was enough for my party of 3. I got the Fire and Smoke pizza with sausage. There are peppers mixed in with the pizza sauce to make it spicy. There is a kick in the first slice but then the heat kept building and I had was hurting a little to finish a small pizza, but probably would have been better if I did not just have water. The pizza crust is very thin and cooked in a wood fired oven, which is a bonus to any pizza. Overall, not bad pizza at all."}, {"review_id": "-vKQUM77RVhbELRJSk7Tig", "user_id": "cAis5zOLXUh62ohGmSOm2Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "So I love pizza I think I am an expert on all things pizza- so when this spot came up on my yelp I said what the hey. I ordered the double pepperoni pizza to go . The lady said 15 mins so I get there and the decor inside was freaking cool!!! I wish I would've order the pie inside- so let's talk pizza the crust was was thin and the end was CRUNCHY not burn but was able to hold the weight of the pizza. The pepperoni were small but spicy not too spicy but good enough to balance with the sauce - the sauce to cheese ratio was good but it could've use more sauce and then more cheese it still was good!!! The only complain the small pizza which is like bout 10-12 inch pie was like 15-16$ it's a little pricey for carry out but not so much for dine in -if that makes any sense!Would go again with friends instead of going solo"}, {"review_id": "sA6Pjj5wY9vl6mdfeatpzg", "user_id": "opPpHVIp8SKHMJg3_y5Lew", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/13/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This is my go to pizza place every time I come to DC.

I came across Matchbox and saw some promising reviews, I also noticed they had Happy Hour from 3p - 7p so went to check it out.I grabbed a seat at the bar. PSA - don't sit to close to the door, seems there are frequent homeless who come in sit at the bar and beg for money/food/booze. That was one thing I did not enjoy. I had to make eyes at so many employees to come and take care of this, not a way I wanted to enjoy my \"happy hour\". They had HH wines on special for $6, I went with the pinot grigio but they do have a local blend of red wine on special if you like reds better. I wasn't to impressed with the HH bites menu. I had read a lot about the pizza but didn't think I could really finish a personal pizza by myself at that time so I went with the HH cheesy garlic pizza sticks that came with tomato dipping sauce for $5. I was thinking this would be like \"pizza sticks\" but it was more like garlic bread with marinara sauce on the side. It was good just not what I had in mind."}, {"review_id": "e1_kDu-KEffc48YqWS4Ygg", "user_id": "nN9fOuwqSsdyB7p02IFQrA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "We don't live in DC and we went on yelp and needed to find a place that was affordable and kid friendly.

Our colleague ordered it in an attempt to be unique but it did not pay off, haha! Our waiter even told us not to order it. Other than that, with multiple locations in DC, Matchbox is a consistently pretty good pizza place and it seems like there's always someone from work coming here for happy hour. On the most recent visit, we were having a farewell lunch for a coworker. Among the five of us, we shared two large pizzas and a large salad and it was more than enough food. The crust is thin, crispy and addictive and they have a good selection of signature pizzas-- we got the chicken pesto and the veggie. We also got an apple pear salad to share as well and the flavors blended together quite nicely. For dessert, the waiter recommended which desserts were good for sharing (did not recommend the cherry pie and said no one orders it lol) and it was either the apple crisp or pudding. The apple crisp was a great choice! All in all, reserve a little time to sit and relax. Service can be kind of slow.
