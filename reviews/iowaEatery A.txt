We arrived a little before our reservation and had a drink and reviewed the menu at the bar. We were notified our table was ready a little before our reservation time which is always nice. My vodka lemonade and his rum and coke were very strong, so if you like strong drinks, this is perfect for you. We ordered the Brussels for an appetizer and OMG YUM. They were drizzled with pomegranate molasses and bread crumbs and honestly the best Brussels sprouts I've ever had. We then ordered the #15 Pizza which is spinach, goat cheese, honey, and red onion. So amazing. I would highly recommend. Also, the best part- the happy hour!! 3-6 is half price pizza and drinks. Does it get any better than that? I can't wait to go back to try the other pizzas and of course, the Brussels sprouts!"}, {"review_id": "uv-eb04IVyR6NE1HI9m-dQ", "user_id": "teZcrQYw8nrN2zW7dWvRgQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Took the family to this restaurant based on my daughter's recommendation.  She loves their pizza.  I had heard of this place, but never had the opportunity to go.  I was pretty impressed with it.  The place is bigger than I would have guessed, the decor quite nice.  If you go between 3-6pm during the week it's happy hour which means 1/2 off pizzas and half off draft beers and wine.  We definitely took advantage of that...shared 3 different pizzas (all good), and I had a couple of beers I've never sampled before.  My only complaint was that is was pretty loud in there...a bit hard to hear the person on the other side of the table...but that is a petty complaint. Really a pretty nice place.  Service was everything you would expect.

I brought my parents while they were in town and we all found something that we would love, even with our various dietary restrictions. We walked in around 5pm on a Friday night and the place was packed, but we still got seated promptly and drinks were brought to us soon after. The service was great and the food, as always, was amazing.

We were probably in between rushes, so, that was nice. Service was on point, staff was friendly and bustling about getting ready for the next insurgence of people.I ordered the Turkish Coffee; cinnamon, and cardamom with dark rum and (frothed?) milk. Very nice. *** Note, they offer bottomless bloody's and mimosas for $13, I mean if you're looking for a Sunday Funday or are entertaining out of town guests that's pretty sweet.For my entree, I had the lamb gyro with some spicy potatoes. Home run. Everything was so delicious that I ate it all, I was uncomfortably full. It was like I was trying to prep for the upcoming holidays. I'm just saying that if you're having a weak willpower day, maybe stay home, don't eat here or you will be stuffed. However, this may be the perfect place if you've just run a half marathon. Oh!!! And they have happy hour every day. Every day from 3 - 6. Which is awesome!"}, {"review_id": "7uFUf1IorAuBbx35-IlAzA", "user_id": "o5p083kD7HaDNMjhnrzcPQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/23/2017", "text": "Really in the pinnacle of what the Des Moines food scene is offering. We had a huge group and the service was impeccable all around. I was so surprised at how well they handled the huge group. We ordered a bunch of pizzas (happy hour deal offers an insanely good price). All of the pizzas were incredible, My favorite was the one with truffle oil and soft egg.  Food was a clear 5/5. Now the dessert was bar none the best I've had in DSM so far. So great in texture and flavor. Forgive me but I cannot remember the name of it. All I remember was that it was decadent chocolate cake with Banana slices that were caramelized. Dessert 6/5 I don't drink at all so I can't speak on the alcoholic beverages, although the selection seemed huge on the menu. I did have the coffee, which was served very tastefully and tasted really great.  100% will come back in the future. I do recommend anyone who wants to have a great time eating to come here and try it once. The place was incredibly packed throughout and it seemed like the wait time may take some patience so maybe call ahead about the wait time."}, {"review_id": "hdiZf0enMvIGXVhMMon0cw", "user_id": "JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "Really nice looking pizzas and about 15 options for the Mediterranean lover or the Italian alike. Crunchy crust and fresh ingredients. Eatery A is cool in that the pizza is made in an open kitchen of a very modern looking restaurant from bar to floor. We also had some gnocchi and Brussels sprouts which were quality and Home cooked, but not the point of coming to Eatery A. Service wasn't the best in the bar area having to track down our waiter on numerous occasions. In addition, Brussels sprouts didn't come out as described on the menu and our beers were room temperature at best. They had WiFi and a few tvs that seemed unused by the clientele - perfect opening for my type of viewing dining. Beer selection was good for an Italian restaurant but nothing compared to some great options in town less than 5 minute drive away. Parking lot available and a nice patio when the weather is good. Eatery A is definitely on the good list of quality Des Moines restaurants."}, {"review_id": "5B9_kqQItGorUFGZgg19CA", "user_id": "KI7kd8L3sNxEk6r-da44jQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Excellent food and great service from Jessie!

Here's why.1. This is the BEST happy hour I've ever met. HALF OFF PIZZA AND WINE AND BEER 3-6PM EVERY DAY. Like come on. You can have an amazing meal (and leftovers) for like $13. 2. Each and every pizza I have gotten here blows my mind. My favorites are #4, #6, #12, #14, and #15. I love their ones with olive oil base and prosciutto involved the best. 3. If you're craze enough to go off of the pizza menu and get apps too, those are also awesome. I recommend the brussel sprouts and HIGHLY recommend the olives. The olives are warm--amazing--and have coriander, cumin, cinnamon, paprika, and orange zest. I know this because I asked the waiter for the recipe and she gave it to me so I can make it myself. 4. Patio seating is bomb--it's gorgeous and the area surrounding it on Ingersoll is interesting. The inside is super cute too, especially watching them make the pizzas!5. Servers and bartenders are all very friendly and helpful. They make some really interesting cocktails--one even has kombucha!(sometimes there's a bit of a wait, especially during happy hour times, but I promise it's worth it! also heads up--parking lot is small so street parking is a better bet.)"}, {"review_id": "a6dbq9rNdKShM2cgqeXljQ", "user_id": "4vNanJZoLNsTghuc_Va_uw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Consistently one of the best QUALITY meals I get in Des Moines.

Also 1/2 off pizza but I eat that a lot. They have a varied menu with an array of fabulous ingredients. I'll start with kibbeh ( African version of steak tartare). The the lamb sliders crispy shallots and fattoush salad (sumac is an amazing lemony spice). Omg even the bread bun was tasty hot. I'm so full but, i can't stop. I'll try a pizzza #1 which is smoked chicken, red grapes, goat cheese and peppadews ( marinated red baby bell pepper from South Africa. I'd never heard of this). This place was a delight.

Lively bar area and pleasant atmosphere. Trendy decor mixed with Iowa rustic. I ordered the Cioppino which I was told is the chef's specialty. It is like a seafood stew on steriods. The flavors were tremendous,bold, and savory. There were generous portions of mussels, shrimp, clams, and chorizo sausage. Vegetables included onion, tomato, and potato. To top it off, it was served with a toasted house ciabbato. Fabulous.My wife had the short ribs on a served on creamy grits. It was accompanied with a fried pickled garnish and crispy kale. She loved it.We will return to explore more menu items."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/eatery-a-des-moines?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
