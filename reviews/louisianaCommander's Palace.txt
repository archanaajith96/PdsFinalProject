The palace decorum was very polished and pleasant to meander though, and the most I can liken it to is that vicarious feeling of aristocracy and civility I get when watching films depicting the elegance of the early 1900s... I must admit, I actually was a bit embarrassed and shy when starting on the initial bread, as I thought about how unrehearsed I was in knowing the art of using the \"proper\" knife or fork in a given setting. But I don't want to make this place seem pretentious or snobbish at all - the staff was extremely friendly and warm.Turtle Soup - wow! This was awesome! They added quite a bit of sherry to the dish, and although it initially seemed like the sherry was masking all the other flavors in the dish, after eating a bunch of it I realized how much the sherry actually opened up the dishes' flavor. The immediate wine flavor pleasantly led the way into the rest of the interesting flavors within the soup. And although I admittedly felt strange chomping through actual turtle meat, this soup was just way too yummy to let that get in the way of its consumption.Gumbo with Seafood - very dark, very interesting. Not like any gumbo I've had before, but my instincts tell me that this is actually how gumbo is supposed to be made and taste like. The base of the soup was super rich and was much more complex than what I've been accustomed to. I am definitely lacking the words to describe in what way this soup was more complex, but definitely get this and don't expect a \"usual\" gumbo when you order it.Turducken Stuffed Quail - my friend ordered this upon the recommendation of our waiter. She was reluctant to get it because she typically doesn't enjoy quail, however she (and I) LOVED this dish. I don't understand how so much flavor was impregnanted into the exquisitely thin skin of the bird - man was it good. The quail was served on some corn bread which unfortunately was a strange and unwanted addition to the dish. It just didn't really seem to fit with it, and neither I or my friend ate much of it. Still, get this dish. It was SO good.Filet mignon - was perfectly tender and juicy as filet mignons should be. It came with some \"creole potatoes\" which had this awesome horseradish flavor. I can't say much else except that it was exceptionally cooked.Also, I think that they change up their menu pretty frequently so they probably alternate different garnishes to the main dishes.Overall, not just amazing food, but an amazing dining experience. If you ever find yourself in New Orleans I highly recommend that you take a trip here. Just make sure you make a reservation in advance!"}, {"review_id": "yD5vMDmGMIbshg-KPeNF6w", "user_id": "7xJUbuDRzB6TRrT_2YUnTg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "It's been a couple of weeks since our brunch here, I just never got around to typing my review until now.

I had originally made a reservation at a different restaurant and then we decided to change after watching the Ella Brennan documentary on Netflix. I called Commander's Palace and was able to make a same night reservation due to another diners cancellation. (I had made a reservation here for brunch on my last trip, and when I called to make the reservation and gave them my name they already had my phone number and were very hospitable - nice touch!).We arrived and decided to all have the Chef Tony's Tasting menu and wine pairing and we each ordered a different dessert so we could try more options. Every dish was delicious and the wines were nicely paired. I will say that I wasn't as impressed by the service as I was expecting, they were kind, friendly and thoughtful, but it felt a little messy. Especially after dining at another restaurants of this 'chain' and having impeccable service. Also, we ordered the wine pairing and the waiter pouring our wine didn't seem to really know what he was doing (ie. we asked him what type of grape one of the wines was and he didn't know and had to ask someone).Of all of the dishes we had, we all thought that the Boudin Stuffed Quail was by far out of this world delicious. There was a fried oyster with a sea urchin sauce that was also awesome and we all loved the creme brulee and the bread pudding souffle the best.I had eaten here for a jazz brunch on my last trip and the food was great, but this dinner was out of this world.

We ordered the 2 course dinner which came with soup or salad, entree, and $3.00 for dessert. I ordered the gumbo and it was pretty tasty. A little on the soupy side but still good nonetheless. Sister ordered the turtle soup and the meat was a little chewy. I ordered the boudin quail for the entree. Wow. This dish is delicious and I highly recommend this. The only bones you'll have to get through are the legs. It must've been a really fat quail because there was enough meat to share with my sisters and make me full! The bird is stuffed with what looks to be dirty/Cajun rice. I could finish the dish but it was really good. Crispy skin and juicy meat! One of my sisters ordered the duck breast. Both of them loved it, but it still tastes a little gamey to me. I'm also used to the Peking Duck at the Asian markets/ restaurants and that's all the duck I know how to eat. So you may not have to trust me with duck on this one. Other sister ordered the gulf fish. Oh man! It's that crispy texture on the outside again, I tell ya! After you cut the fish with your fork, you get the soft flaky fish. Yum! For dessert, we got the strawberry shortcake and the bread pudding soufflé. The strawberry shortcake was a little too spongy and thick for me. Tons of strawberries piled on the plate and also too sweet. The bread pudding soufflé was my personal favorite. There didn't seem to be enough of it because I wanted more. For the level of sophistication and dress code requirement to come through these doors, I was hoping for a little bit more professionalism.  Servers mixed up our orders several times where they had to swap plates, we had to grab their attention to order wine, they were dropping utensils, just a lot of little stuff. Also, there were 2 servers helping us, but there seemed to be more and it was just confusing.

We were early for our reservation but brought back to a bar that had a lovely courtyard outside. 4 drinks were average price and average taste. (The best bloody Mary in nola can be found at aunt tiki!)We were seated in a room on the other side of the courtyard. Bring a sweater!  Service appeared prompt and there were several different folks that tended to our table. And yet my sister in law asked for a glass of cuvee twice and didnt receive it either time. Also when she mentioned the coffee tasted burned the server took offense and rudely noted it was chicory as he was walking away. We knew that and had plenty of chicory coffee on the trip- and it was still burned.  (This tipped me back to 2 star)The food- 'meh'. We had a LOT of good, creative food on this trip. Hubby and I usually split several dishes. Brunch is set up as 3 course for about $35-40 but you can also do a la carte. So we did one course selecting turtle soup, bbq gulf shrimp and the bread pudding souffle, with an add in of crawfish gnocchi. The turtle soup was the star- complemented with a splash of Sherry. Different and very flavorful. The gnocchi were not memorable, the shrimp lacked flavor and I didn't get the goat cheese in the grits (and I love all cheeses) and the pudding was different but the part I liked best was the crust the souffle made around the edges.

Cause everything was sooo damn good, BUT! It just wasn't 5 stars good. Upon arrival, we were escorted to the dining room across the way from the entrance. We passed by the kitchen which was cool to see. The place itself is huge-- 6 dining rooms and 7 in the summer (outside patio). We were sat at a table with 3 balloons...their treat for people with birthdays! It was a cute little touch. Edward was super nice and helpful. That southern hospitality really did shine at Commander's Palace! Starters: TURTLE SOUP W/SHERRY [$8.50]-- this dish was not as good as everyone makes it. I can't really describe it... It's one of those dishes you have to try just to say you've tried it. It was salty, but it was other things that I can't describe. The turtle tasted like chicken so that wasn't so bad.

It was a little bland for my liking. The corn cream had more flavor and it just wasn't as good as I thought it would be. 8OZ FILET MIGNON OF BLACK ANGUS BEEF [$43] Loved the filet, the mushrooms on it were bombbb! I liked this dish way better than my gulf fish. Cooked perfectly! DESSERT: It was my birthday-- didn't get a \"free\" dessert. Is it bad that I expected it from a place like this? Welllll.... they did give me a chef's hat to put on which was cute and embarrassing. We ordered the CREOLE BREAD PUDDING SOUFFLE [$9.50] (which again they're known for) Again did not like it as much as the BANANAS FOSTER. It was just \"okay\" for me. It did not wow me! The Bananas Foster [$16] is a must have here! They prepare it table-side. It thoroughly entertained me and the end result was yummyyy! Overall, Commander's Palace is a destination in itself, but for me, the food wasn't good enough to earn it 5 stars. Maybe I ordered the wrong food?
