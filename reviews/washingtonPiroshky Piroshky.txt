We took one bite out of each pastry and threw the rest out. Definitely not worth trying if you are picky about baked goods (check out Bakery Nouveau instead). Salmon pate pastry- tasted like a hot pocket, even down to the cheap bready taste...I was hoping for something more flakey/buttery/higher quality.Moscow roll- $6/7 (\"Cream of Wheat and Bavarian cream blended together, providing a light and fluffy vanilla taste\") I didn't want any of their sweet stuff cause I heard the savory ones are better, but my sister bought it and wow I cannot believe they charge that much for something so blah. There was nothing fluffy or vanilla about it. It was not flavorful at all I would say three stars because average is the perfect word for what we got, but since it was pretty expensive my expectations were higher.  I can't believe the total for the two was like $13....I think it would be more forgivable if we paid maybe like $6 total."}, {"review_id": "QeTuDSzO12Fgv1hqlJLGYw", "user_id": "ViN9WhYRpUEiF5ttn7NyiA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "That Smoked Salmon Pâté Pastry - woah woah woah, just deliciousness in your mouth! Best eaten when it's warm and fresh out of the oven. Went down to Pike's Place on my first day back in Seattle and I knew I had to try Piroshky, having missed out on it during my last trip a year and a half ago. The line moved fairly quickly and we ordered their bestsellers, the Smoked Salmon Pâté Pastry and the Beef & Cheese Piroshky. Salmon one was 100% wonderful. The beef & cheese was a miss for me. We had some free time one afternoon and I suggested we go to Pike's and grab some Russian pastries. This was my second visit during the same trip. Between four of us, we ordered two salmon pastries, one curry chicken rice Pastry, and one Cherry & White Chocolate Streudal. The salmon delivered in taste again, but curry chicken rice one was a let down (contrary to the cashier's suggestion) - it did not have enough chicken and was simply all curry rice inside!) The Cherry & White Chocolate Streudal is divine. I don't know how to describe it but it's just really good. TRY IT."}, {"review_id": "CjBlXpepngdH3nW1Q9TaOg", "user_id": "BtaSC08XF5WOA_nPkNQuhQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Yes. Yes. Yes. This place is next to the original Starbucks, but I think is a much more important stop. This is a tiny bakery, but is full of delicious choices. We got up to the front fairly quickly and I panicked because I wasn't sure if I should have a savory piroshky since I was at the namesake, or if I should get one of the sweet baked goods in the case below it. Then I eyed the rhubarb roll. I love rhubarb and I can usually only find it in Texas in the fall. I can't bake it myself to save my life. No regrets about my decision, it was absolutely amazing. Okay, one regret. I didn't eat over the little bag they gave me and my black pants got covered in powdered sugar. Small price to pay for such an excellent stop on vacation."}, {"review_id": "Us2o0DsyLKGN8z8sEMXxEg", "user_id": "qR4p8oCsSEPwPO8ONhpGaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Believe the hype!I got the smoked salmon & a fresh rhubarb piroshky.

I actually ended up coming here twice in three days! I've never really heard of Russian bakeries being big no matter where I've gone before... I've heard of American bakeries or Chinese bakeries like 85C to get bread, and even Cuban bakeries like Porto's in Southern California, so I was intrigued by the Russian bakery. As soon as you walk by this place you can smell the fresh baked goodies that they're making all day long. There is a line although it was around 10min long both times that I went. The top of the menu shows the top 3 baked goods for savory and sweets. The salmon pate is definitely worth trying although I liked the beef and onion/beef and cheese better as the beef is well seasoned and the pastry on the outside has really good flavor and texture. Sweet rolls I tried the cinnamon apple which was really good but maybe a little overrated based on reviews and I tried the cinnamon cardamom as well. Both were pretty good but not life changing, and my friend who got marzipan was blown away by it! Definitely stop by if you're at Pikes place although some of the breads are a little bit pricy."}, {"review_id": "yrLPNUbf3jimMhAr5_oEKw", "user_id": "mRz772a5aMQqq8M2lXLmmw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "It makes me so sad to give Piroshky Piroshky an \"okay\" rating, but truthfully, it didn't dazzle me.This location didn't have a line outside when we swung by. My cousin highly recommended this place, but left us to our own devices when ordering. Because we wanted to try other things in the area, my significant other and I stuck to the cherry-white chocolate pastry, apple cinnamon roll, and chicken and rice curry piroshky. I think we could have ordered different things, but we were operating under the assumption that our goods would be tasty and fresh. Well, about that. While the chicken and rice curry and apple cinnamon pastries were somewhat warm, the cherry-white chocolate was not. In a reversal of fortune, the cherry-white chocolate ended up being the only one we enjoyed. We barely tasted the white chocolate, but the sour cherry goodness was pretty good. I bet we would have enjoyed it more had it been warm.The chicken and rice curry was just alright. Although savory and filling, it was only so because of a very large quantity of rice in the pastry. This piroshky tasted like I was eating puff pastry wrapped around curried rice. Because it wasn't piping hot, it felt soggy and soft to the touch.Finally, while our dessert apple cinnamon roll came swirled with a ton of apples, it didn't have the kind of complex flavor that typically comes with tart apples and cinnamon sugar. Instead, the apples were plain and sweet, and truth be told, the whole pastry was dense and hard to get through. This one mostly tasted like sweet cinnamon, and by the very end, felt more like a bready roll than a cinnamon roll.As tourists, we felt very rushed through the ordering process. Although there was only one party behind us, we were expected to know exactly what we wanted once we hit the counter, leaving no time to evaluate our options. There's no way to really look inside and see for yourself, either. The workers behind the counter seemed more concerned with collecting money than giving a recommendation to what I presume are mostly out-of-town visitors.I didn't want to be sad about a Seattle staple, but alas, this one just didn't work for me. If I were in the city again, I'd probably go for the salmon pate or arrive earlier in the morning. For now, this one is a 3.5 teetering toward a 3-star rating."}, {"review_id": "aAW1QzbMGbTo0O2C0PNc4w", "user_id": "SI0B9MRW_x3O9ua-L3gvPA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "When you visit pikes place, this is a must stop! Why? If you like freshly baked piroshky then this is the place for you! It's amazing how in such a small space they can still churn out so many different pastries! Do come early, during certain times of the day there can be lines but they aren't too long since everything moves quite fast. We came here twice, we were told to get the smoked salmon piroshky but each time we came they were sold out so we opted for the beef and cheese! Compared to piroshky I've had in sf this one is baked and not deep fried. There was plenty of beef and cheese inside and it was so delicious!! We also tried a sweet one, it was similar to a cinnamon bun, it was nice and hot but it was a bit too sweet for my liking.

The ratio to meat and pastry wasn't that amazing but overall the flavor was good. I do wish that the piroshky was hotter when I ate it. I think that would have brought out more of the flavor and kept a crunchier texture on the outside.A friend of mine got an item with a sausage in it and that tasted a lot better than the beef & onion piroshky.

Everyone talks about Piroshky Piroshky at Pike Place Market, and you really can't skip it if you want the full Seattle experience. We came around 11am on a Saturday and there was a huge line, but moved decently fast. We got our pastries after about 20 minutes of waiting and we opted for the very popular Salmon Pate ($7) and the Cinnamon Cardamom Braid ($5).The salmon pate arrived in our hands nice and hot. It tasted progressively better with each bite and we devoured it in less than 3 minutes. Something about this pastry is so unique--the type of bread they use and the salmon filling inside is just so different from anything I've ever had and I did not want it to end. The cinnamon cardamom braid is very similar to a cinnamon roll. The cardamom flavors are very prominent and I loved the hints of chocolate throughout. Really loved how strong the cinnamon flavor was in each bite too--I'm normally not a huge fan of pastries because I find the dough to be too overpowering with not enough flavor, but this was not the case. It doesn't matter whether you opt for savory or sweet, I'm sure you can't go wrong with anything on the menu because we were blown away by both of the items we ordered.

Everything about this pasty was delightful and I'm drooling just thinking of it. I'm more of a savory person, so I preferred the salmon, even though the apple was good too.
