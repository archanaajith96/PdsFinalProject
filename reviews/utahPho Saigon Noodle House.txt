I've been to Vietnam several times and fell in love with the pho there, but finding good pho elsewhere has been sort of hit and miss. Until yesterday.We stumbled upon Pho Saigon in West Valley and immediately made plans for lunch there. We found that the menu was more extensive than that at most other Vietnamese restaurants, and were pleasantly surprised to see they also had banh mi, the signature sandwich. We tried both.The pho was delicious, the broth rich and fragrant, and the portions very generous. The brisket was thick, lean, and tender, and the noodles cooked just right. The sandwiches were substantial, with authentic pâté and just the right amount of spread. Service was good, the atmosphere a little noisy, but everything was clean. We will definitely go back."}, {"review_id": "zUG1vmOVVzaBT0CmCkr6nw", "user_id": "RyjGaG8qXdaIDQD-r2Xfnw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/5/2017", "text": "Staying in the hotel behind this restaurant. We walked by it mana few times in the past couple of days. Every time it smelled wonderful. Today we decided to give it a go. We was instantly greeted at the door and sat. It wasn't booming busy either so that had a lot to do with it. Still was meet with a friendly face and a smile. So that is a plus. I will say I am not a fan of the menu. This was our fist visit. The menu was a little confusing, and our server spoke limited English. We got thru with the help of another server so all good. Which I believe this is a family owned and most of the family work here as well. I love that. I always have. Alright on to the good stuff.Their ham fried rice is off the charts amazingly awesome! My hubby got the pulled pork sandwich. The bread was perfect. It was soft where it should be and crispy crusted. I ordered the beef flat noodles. I have to say it was delicious. It was a little overly dine with the cilantro for my taste, but my other half was quite satisfied  with it. He kindly took it all off my hands. So it worked out. We also had ordered egg rolls. They were really hot so be very careful when they arrive at your table.I would be thrilled to go back. This is a great little restaurant with great taste."}, {"review_id": "du04uDRcTcycdgZ-Hkb-8Q", "user_id": "qnJS95fom9M1ZXBe05kzoA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Got the banh uot cha lua (#2) and banh hoi thit nuong-grilled pork with vermicelli wrap (#4).

Pho after church on Sunday! I came with my whole family, we all ordered pho bowls, goi cuon (spring rolls), egg rolls. Everyone's bowl came out except mines - here's where it starts. Everything else food came out except the spring rolls and my bowl of pho. The food was okay, not bad good portion of beef, hoisin sauce comes in a yellow bottle. Broth was a little oily possibly msg- that's okay everyone does it. Two egg rolls were like  $3.75. Everyone is half way finished with their bowl, and I ask for my order again, they brought it out and apologized.. by that time I'm gulping down my meal trying to catch up with everyone else. Not cool, but I understand they're busy, and I'm reasonable- that's okay but keep reading..My sister pays the bill, i mentioned to her hey! Make sure they don't charge out for spring rolls we never got it! She went to the counter to let them know what's going on.. our server guy told the lady that appears to be the owner/ manager to just refund the spring rolls and let her be on the way.. instead she turns towards him and starts yelling at him - that he should do his job, and this wouldn't have happened .. whoa that was sooo unprofessional.. but whatever.. then she says I'll get this order ready, we decline, we are already done eating and we don't want it to go... so she's upset now and doesn't like what she's hearing- possibly because she doesn't want to refund us. So she says fine.. opens the register and pulls out $3 and gave it to me.. I mentioned to her it actually cost 3.75 and tax.. she gave me 0.75 and I bet she thought this would just get rid of me.. They don't value customer service here. Our server definitely shouldn't be treated like that either especially in front of customers. Other things: -They work in teams so if you don't get something from your order tell them asap! -they communicate to each other pretty well so don't be afraid to speak up-chopsticks come in the Togo (wooden chopsticks) so you don't have to worry about the wax-they serve tapioca, smoothies, no chrysanthemum hot tea"}, {"review_id": "n7-MMVJi2y2Y8IBE4rUgmQ", "user_id": "tHsJQL7Ccmqb7C7st5jcrQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "The pho here is amazing.

I was pretty grossed out when I opened the to-go box and saw they put raw steak on top of the noodles. Blood had actually seeped into the noodles. Typically when I've ordered pho to go from other places the meat is already in the broth so its able to cook while the broth is still hot. I ate it anyway (mistake). The broth was \"Meh\" and I didn't get any hoisen sauce which was a bummer. I couldn't spit the rubbery meatball out of my mouth quick enough!This morning I woke up with the shits and all signs point to Pho Saigon Noodle House and their raw bloody noodles."}, {"review_id": "cQ3zYaBYDdX0SHpw0ln0FQ", "user_id": "up5qlDAhatlemB-9xHDg9A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "Crazy as it may sound, my husband and I, come here a minimum 3x a week.  We always order the same thing a #201 PHÓ, large and a small.  Love the recognition, get seated and put our order in right away.  Lunch and Dinner always busy."}, {"review_id": "BsRGXsCy_RqZbb9ya6It7w", "user_id": "CV-BtcQ8wAnlJ9ro5o0khw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/22/2017", "text": "Pho is one of the best in town, but their service is awfully slow and they hardly come check on you.

I already know the food here is good but the customer service here is awful. I took my mom here and it was my final straw. I ordered my usual pho tai (rare steak) and my mom ordered the house special pho. She had a mixture of vermicelli and the flat noodles. The flat noodles weren't cooked all the way so she took those noodles out and set them in the table. I called the server over to show him and he cleaned off the table, took my mom's bowl and said he would return with a new one. About 5 mins later, he returns with the same bowl, without the flat noodles inside. We knew it was the same bowl because of the dressings (basil, bean sprouts, cilantro) that were originally added were still in there! I asked my mom if she wanted another bowl and she said no because she was afraid to complain again. After finishing her bowl, we went to pay for our meal and I mentioned how we did not get cooked noodles and how it was not a new bowl as promised. The guy went to the back of the kitchen and asked if it was cooked all the way through and he/she said yes. I was so livid, that I paid for the meal and promised I would never come back. This is absolutely unacceptable and if you decide to dine here, let it be known that the customer service is horrible here."}, {"review_id": "7V1eX7nge6uTSzxaGJBD0g", "user_id": "sDmLuolKwjDGK6AJxoJ89w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "8/21/2017", "text": "This is by far the worst experience I have ever had at a pho restaurant!

The rolls were large and generously filled with meat and vegetables.  The dipping sauce was a great consistency and very flavorful.  We both ordered bowls of pho; I got a regular size and Josh ordered a large.  The bowls came out quickly and steaming hot.  The sizes were generous portions and there was a good amount of meat in each order.  My only complaint was that it was a tad bit salty and a lot too greasy.  It was difficult to finish the entire bowl, as it became too much to handle.  Paying our bill was unclear and it took a while to flag down an employee to explain to us that we had to go out to the cash register.  The cashier was friendly and we were quickly processed.  Although the pho was not my favorite, I want to come back to try more of the unique Vietnamese cuisine that is offered on the menu!"}, {"review_id": "PfaUg_LQP62xFgcqDK9qFg", "user_id": "jmYNu_KhUZdX-Nv1yG2RuA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "pho was great flavor, atmosphere was awesome.  enjoyed my dinner at a new place.  Spring rolls tasted very fresh."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-saigon-noodle-house-west-valley-city?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
