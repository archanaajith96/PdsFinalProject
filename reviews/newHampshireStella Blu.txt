It's tapas-style, so the plates are small and you're meant to order multiple plates and share. My fiancee and I went last night and ordered 4 plates. The BLT flatbread was delicious -- a very thin crust topped with tomato confit, bacon, lettuce, cheese, and a spicy aioli. We also got the arancini which were light, airy, and very flavorful. My fiancee's steak tips were glazed in a very tasty soy marinade and they were melt in your mouth. I don't even like steak tips and I could eat a whole plate of them. I had the pulled pork on top of jalapeno cornbread with fennel slaw. The pork had a slightly sweet, smoky taste and the cornbread was sweet with a big kick on the back end. The slaw didn't really taste like much of anything, but gave a little bit of texture. Our dessert was to die for, it was these little donuts with a salted caramel sauce all over the top of them. We've had them in the past and they're always amazing. One downside though was that the donuts had some sort of crumble on them that I'm pretty sure was crushed up Butterfingers. I am allergic to peanuts, and it wasn't disclosed beforehand that there were peanuts in the dish. That being said, the dessert was free as we had a coupon for a complimentary dessert or salad from last time we were there. Nothing some Benadryl and a lot of water couldn't fix, but I would have gotten something different. Their Guinness cheesecake looked amazing. Lastly, their drinks are a good size and very strong. They play around with interesting flavor combinations and come up with some great ideas to suit different palates. Will definitely go again!"}, {"review_id": "2aM6O9CVWoGtQG-64-62kw", "user_id": "FxDd259kv0UyB7nVtUnirg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "8/26/2017", "text": "I just don't get all the 4 and 5 stars for this place.  Pleasant wait and bar staff with a decent menu on paper, but the execution falls short to say the least.  Seared scallops 2.5/5 we could literally smell them as soon as they were put down in front of us and not in a good way.Brussel sprouts 2/5 undercooked with no distinct flavor.  Disappointing knowing how easy they are to cook WITH flavor.Fish tacos (seared tuna) - NO.  Just NO.Eggplant Rollatini 2/5 frozen eggplant smothered in sauce and cheese, served tapas style for $8.  I get that there is not a lot to choose from in Nashua in terms of good restaurants, but why hype up a place that would never make in an area with a lot of options in outstanding food and service?

Took a friend there for her birthday and we seriously ate good just ordering the sliders, brussels and a couple of other plates. She had a soft drink but I had a martini, as far as I'm concerned, the make the best martinis in town.  A little pricier than some places, but so worth it.  And they have lots of variations on the martini so it's always fun to try something new.   I would say the place is pricey, but it's so worth it that I don't mind spending a little extra.   And they seriously can get some good music in there as well.  I'm single and it's a place I'm not afraid to go to by myself, though I think it is more of a date place, I feel comfortable at the bar.  I recommend it to anyone looking for something new."}, {"review_id": "S8ereZcwCZ7efEj_BLDX2g", "user_id": "AMDdsaVzwyHpiyugGDrfBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/8/2017", "text": "Came here with a group tonight.

We got shrimp & grits, buffalo chicken dip with pita chips, lobster mac, and arancinis. Shrimp and grits is spicey and salty but super savory with a creamy ball of grits in the middle. Buffalo chicken dip was like what you'd make at home but the fried pitas stepped it up and the buffalo sauce was real, NOT tabasco. Lobster mac was amazing mac & cheese that you just yearn for when it's gone with two shelled lobster claws on top. And the arancinis I could have eaten until I burst but you only get 2. We also had a chocolate covered cherry martini (that will knock you on your bum) and a Great Pear Martini (tastey but I'll get something else next time).

There are many options to choose from on their tapas menu to please a group. Some of my favorites are no longer on the menu unfortunately but a few classics are the kobe beef sliders, stella fries and the stella donuts for desserts. Martinis and sangria are safe options and the craft beer selection is okay. One of my more recent visits the I found the calamari to be sub par compared to my past experiences. Of course, I will be back soon to try some new items from their seasonally changing tapas menu."}, {"review_id": "tnQAz18hypzm9WrqDROcJw", "user_id": "LfR6rFqIO7DD2h8igwK5ZA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "11/8/2017", "text": "So disappointed. Went for the surf and turf on a Tuesday night. We were one of only 3 couples in the restaurant, one couple was at the bar. We ordered and our meals were brought pretty timely. When the waiter arrived he stated my husbands prime rib was cut way too thin, and if he wanted another cut he would take care of it.. My husband stated he would. The waiter never returned. My husbands drink never got refilled. We had to search around the restaurant for salt and pepper. The broccoli that came with our dinner was cold and under cooked. Its unfortunate as I have been on a weekend night and even though it was busy the service was great and the food was much better,served to temp and drinks were replenished as needed. Unfortunately due to this experience we will never be back."}, {"review_id": "1LOHXYF7Xk5p4ajmtYjovA", "user_id": "-lcgVtjUL1DlhNAe49Ub3Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "My daughter and I met here because it's midway between Boston and Peterborough.  The menu was exceptional,  offering small plates, so we could try a little of everything.

Stella has an interesting eclectic drink menu which is a plus if you value that. We had the ravioli and MB, it was very tasty and was anything but ordinary as the dish may suggest. It was just as good as some of the North End italian places I've been. The Kobe Beef sliders are an absolute must, truly awesome. The salads also are well done. Tapas portions are nicely sized.

I had to order a few different tapas to get a full meal, but it was good to try different things on the menu. I watched the bartenders whip up many concoctions throughout the evening and were not shy with explaining the drinks to me. Many looked very yummy. As we were leaving, live entertainment started.

The food is very basic. No imagination, even though the wording on the menu would lead you to believe otherwise. Frozen pizza crust. Artichokes, peppers, mushrooms on the hummus plate right out of a jar. Store bought pita bread. Nothing here for serious foodies. Not gross but very underwhelming.  Staff was pleasant but not overly concerned with providing great service. To bad because the live music was fantastic. Cocktails were excellent.
