But the pasta I had tonight deserves another go at it. This was an all vegetarian pasta. I ordered some pasta I've never heard of: fluffy pasta, kale, trumpet mushrooms, and almond butter sauce. Good gosh. I mean. This was like ordering a steak cooked perfectly. The trumpets were divine and I cut my last one up into tiny pieces so I could savor it, and every bite, tiny as it was, burst with flavor. Plus Stephen, the bar tender, can rock whiskey like Lady GaGa rocks imagination. Javier is a dream boat and everything about this place makes me say, \"okay, I can live here. This is incredible.\" Ps I'm from Austin, home of foodie-ness, margaritas, and sunshine.

The plates are more or less hit or miss now, and the flavor profile is much less impressive.Went with husband and mother in law for Easter, really wanted to impress her with our favorite restaurant in Delaware.  The pink peppercorn tagliatelle is a huge miss, bland and pasta is overcooked. The oxtail risotto is almost just as bland, and I had such high expectations for it. The rabbit tortellini was tasty, as was the roasted whole fish. But the appetizer salad wasn't nearly as bright and thoughtfully complex as before, and the dessert mousse had this... not very good beet that kinda made no sense on the plate.(this is coming from someone who looooves roasted beets - the roasted beets wasn't sweet or flavorful, and the pickled beets really doesn't work with the white chocolate mousse) It's still a good meal, but not as dazzling, amazingly good as before. Everything feels more heavy and less refined. Especially with salads and fresh produce, and dressing and sauce. I'm going to miss the days when the appetizers really made whatever's in season shine."}, {"review_id": "1iJkD0xsla4-_hvAT6vDeg", "user_id": "6G7FgAPHN4nfahFotp0qOw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/23/2017", "text": "I only get here once a year but it needs to be more like 5 times a year.  Food is top notch and the wine list is superb.  I'll be back, without hesitation."}, {"review_id": "oXTOwzPQRMFxPpnCuKngxA", "user_id": "QsM6BSlosKUpMnH9iAgvZA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Ordered the mahi mahi and a green salad. The mahi mahi was tender and juicy but I could taste the gas grill on every bite. They need to switch to a hardwood grill so that the gas taste doesn't taint the fish.

The service and food here are both beyond excellent. I came in during the evening without a reservation. Despite that, the hostess immediately greeted me and found me a table. Once seated, my waitress promptly came by. She was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and gave good recommendations. With all the good options, I settled on the \"4 Courses\" option for $60. For starters, I had the Roasted Delicata Squash. The winter squash was seasoned well with ginger vinaigrette, while the yogurt complemented the squash perfectly. Next, I had the Cecamariti. The almond-anise butter and lobster mushrooms gave the pasta a full flavor, and the kale added a nice amount of contrast to the overall flavor of the dish. For my main course, I had the Aged Crescent Farms Duck Breast cooked to a perfect medium-rare. I was skeptical of the plum yogurt and granola at first, but it really gave the dish more character. Finally, to finish off my meal, I had some seasonally appropriate pumpkin spice gelato."}, {"review_id": "u6b9N0AlXi5lnwj25mli1A", "user_id": "OOBT-jnB7klAyHIVA305IA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "The burger is two thin patties on brioche with pickles, cheese, and smoked bacon.

Lots of \"hype\" in their ad and Yelp. The Good - Very interesting menu and preparations. Food was excellent across the board. I travel for work and entertain at restaurants virtually every week so I know skilled cooking. Not so good - With only about 3 or 4 tables seated on a Friday night, something is up. Maybe the service? Our waitress was pretty knowledgeable but a bit cold. She promised to bring back two different items and never did. I am pretty sure we were her only table so no excuse. I also mentioned in the comments of my OpenTable reservation that we were celebrating our 27th anniversary. For a place of this caliber, I expected at least a mention. Wine - this is supposed to be a wine afficianado's paradise. We are not wine experts but when our waitress had no suggestions, she sent someone when ended up recommending a Malbec which was actually decent but $39 for something listed for $8 online and 2 star rating shouldn't be on the menu. Speaking of the menu, the website showed wine pairings but the menu does not nor were any pairings offered. Beer - advertised \"wonderful craft beer selection\". Don't brag about the beer when it's all bottled and especially when the selection of craft beer is 5 choices. All in all, it's a good place to do once, maybe not multiple times leading to why the place was empty on a Friday night."}, {"review_id": "DGuiIYf-FRpUA9GO_6AJKw", "user_id": "EOajY1L3ole3gLTCZ2xw1g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2017", "text": "We went for the $15 Restaurant Week lunch. I ordered the Golden Beet soup with the house burger. The soup was well-balanced in acidity. It respected the natural flavor of the beet. It had a smooth and consistent texture. The touches of sesame? oil gave complexity and variety to the flavor profile. A dollop of \"beet tartare\" was sweet, cool, and surprising flavorful. Excellent soup.The burger is two thin patties on brioche with pickles, cheese, and smoked bacon. This is a great burger. The bun is fluffy-soft and buttery yet maintains a crisp where it meets the burger. The burger is a complex balance of flavors. Cheese adds salt and umami. Smoked bacon adds smokiness and fatty texture. Pickles are subtle and cool and cleanse this otherwise meat-bomb of a burger.The fries have soft interior with a crisp bite. They are seasoned with rosemary and salt. Quite delicious. I wish they didn't serve them with a plebe-grade ketchup. Aioli would have been a nice compliment. I enjoyed lunch at Domaine Hudson. The atmosphere was casual but refined. I'd be curious to dig deeper into their more complex entrees.If I could, I'd assign 4.5/5 stars. The dishes were great, but the lunch didn't blow me away enough to warrant a perfect score."}, {"review_id": "6vzk9g0herajQlKzUjmZjA", "user_id": "S4hmlEh0bhDv0oELqZsK5A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "My favorite Delaware restaurant.

Each coming time the experiences were slowly but surely moving from amazing to great, to good, to not so good, to disappointing  and finally the last visit was just plain awful.Lets talk about this awful one.FOOD: varied from very mediocre to tasteless and in case of beet soup (which was bland as baby food) and sweetbreads appetizer (which they probably forgot even to salt) just uneatable. DRINKS: my husband's cocktail was just OK, my Riesling was expansive and awful (with the weird aftertaste) + was ordered a 5 oz glass but what was received was 3 oz the max. Though we didn't fuss about it because after tasting it would be hard to prove the exact quantity poured before tasting and besides who needs more of unpleasant wine in anyway. SERVICE: The wait for the 1st course was 40 minutes after ordering, 2nd course wait was 20 minutes after we requested to talk to a manager and sent back these tasteless dishes it took 15 minutes to correct them and bring it back, between the second try was finished and the main course arrived took another 10 minutes, and we didn't even want to order desserts because it was time for us to take our medications and we had to head to the hotel. Yes, they were agree about the quality of the food and the slowest service we ever experienced, explaining that they were very busy (at 80% of capacity the most?!?! at the time of our visit). Yes they were \"apologetic\" about it and \"even\" brought a bread basket (which BTW was the only highlight of our dinner) and took some of the dishes off the check, but the evening was ruined in anyway and nothing was said to really convince us in their sincerity. BTW we observed the other tables while waiting for our food and noticed that the ONLY two tables which were served poorly were the tables served by our waitress. All the other tables were receiving at least timely service. So when we were leaving and passing by this 7 people party table (celebrating some event) they all were in total agreement with us and expressed it quite clear praising us for speaking out. So it's not just our opinion I am talking about but theirs too.Now the VALUE: which was quite good for the experiences we've had received in the past (maybe first 2 times) but as quality went down the prices went up  and now it's just not worth it to spend this kind of money for all of the aggravation you can get. Needless to say this was our last time here and you decide for yourself, but we won't be surprised if in a little while this place will go out of business."}, {"review_id": "rU-U5AYCnuQDZx_69KjaYQ", "user_id": "N5rfYlI3QGLxxmL6m8oYvA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/2/2017", "text": "I have to say that I was unfortunately disappointed by my experience. The service and the food presentation were good but I found the food itself to be lackluster, especially considering the hype given by the previous reviewers.The menu is eclectic but definitely my speed. I had trouble deciding amongst the many options. Since it was a dreary day, I decided to start with the Vidalia Onion Bisque to warm myself up. While trying to be polite, I was literally choking it down. It had a very poor combination of flavors and spices. It was one of the few times in my life that I've sent back a plate unfinished. For my main course I ordered the aged duck confit. This was considerably better and was cooked just right so it was crispy on the outside and tender in the middle. It had a tasty side of pickled cherry-white peach salad, dandelion greens, hazelnut streusel, and sauce au vin.Perhaps I'm letting the appetizer color my experience too much but it quite literally left a bad taste in my mouth and the duck wasn't so good as to outweigh that bad start."}, {"review_id": "J5hOC7-duhaUvr9F_jS5nQ", "user_id": "YHXuniG-RyuRHYwkwY4LZA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/19/2016", "text": "My girlfriend and I ate at Domaine Hudson back in January, and it was a wonderful experience.

Even in as intimate of a restaurant like this, we were able to enjoy having a large group dinner - once in the back room which was dedicated solely to us, and another time in a larger table near the front, away from the rest of the patrons. Being a wine bar, I went in with a very high expectation of their cheese plate and I was absolutely not disappointed. The pairing of the cheese with the respective accessory was tremendous and some of their cheeses (goat, gouda, and brie were a must have). Both times I've been there, I've had the baby mustard green salad - just the right balance between sour from the vinaigrette and the candied cashews.  I've had the bucatini (my recommendation of the two) and the gnocchi. The bucatini was spicy enough with the jalapeno pesto to counteract the meatiness of the mushrooms and it was a hearty enough dish without adding any meat. The gnocchi was a good dish, but at the end, I wished I had the bucatini again."}, {"review_id": "HKwWpmuV4j5ahDAemCc3Xg", "user_id": "fXu1eEKrU7meKojnQILv6g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/19/2016", "text": "Well first off I was just looking for a warm place to get a bite to eat, but I wanted good food!  I may be spoiled from having lived in 4 countries along with NY, SF and LA , or maybe dating a chef may sway my opinion, but when it comes to service I was a waitress for many years and a decent one.  The hostess is nothing short of accommodating!  Warm and welcoming. Sitting at the bar was an entirely different experience and I am not sure I can fault the bartender,  but it was one of the worst bar services I had.  She delivered my food and wine and I couldn't get her attention for 10-15 minutes. There were only 4 other people at the bar. But I think that the issue is she poured for the entire restaurant.  The hostess helped me get much needed salt and pepper for my steak but by then it was cold.  I don't live here so I have no reason to come back.  The food was okay.   If you are use to great dining experiences, this will not even come up on your top 1,000 list. The ambiance is like an upscale Uno's. Or a super low scale..  umm I can't think of anything.  Just tried to be more than it is. Feels like you are in a trailer.
