I recommend the chicken wing which is not bbq at all, but tasted good and with a perfect balance of sweet and spicy flavor. The beef and sausage were also very delicious. The beef was very tender and the sausage was juicy and huge.

We ordered the BBQ nachos of course, which were good, but I wish the cheese was more melted. Beware if you're lactose, as there must have been 2 cups of it on just a half order. We also ordered a full rack of ribs which were half dry, half wet. The ribs literally fell off the bone and were not fatty at all, which is a qualm I have with many bbq spots, so I devoured these.We originally planned to go to the location next to the National Civil Rights Museum since it seemed to fit into the schedule nicely, but were recommended to come to this location by the waitress of another restaurant since it is the original, and would have a shorter wait. Based on the line we saw at the downtown location, she was right."}, {"review_id": "QJ46Wie85ZhWzxnKryMEXw", "user_id": "EaRd_4nFnPs8Fei-H2ZmVA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "What to get: --Service: 3/5Atmosphere: super casual, take outWait: 5 mins (Monday 5PM for 1)Parking: very limited parking spotsThe Experience:I will preface that I just had ribs in Kansas City and St. Louis, so it was very quick for me to compare and rate styles of BBQ.I got Central BBQ to-go, which worked out nicely since there was very limited parking in front and on the side. I actually missed the turn in since a cop had pulled over a car going into the parking lot, but when I did finally get back to the lot, I ended up circling around the restaurant for the 'back' parking, which were a few spaces.The feel of the place is like an outdoor picnic/BBQ. The smell of smoked meat lures you inside easily. They have an order at the counter system, which you can line up right as you enter the door. Only one other customer was in front of me, but there were quite a few people already dining in. If you get it to-go, you just wait in that area and they'll bag it up for you. It didn't take too long (less than 10 mins).I ordered a half slab of ribs with green beans and baked beans. I'll tell you that I wasn't so thrilled with the ribs itself. You can ask for them dry or sauced, and honestly they needed to be sauced. The meat wasn't particularly tender or juicy or easy to take off the bone. If you compare it to all the other exceptional BBQ places, this is about average.The baked beans were probably the best part of the meal. The green beans were just really cooked and not super exciting or noteworthy.Maybe after a break from BBQ and trying it again, I might change my mind, but I'm sad to say that Central BBQ didn't live up to its hype like I was expecting."}, {"review_id": "i3hOk5VL0fv_x2oNrHmEqA", "user_id": "SwP-wrWkPGynwEuad_BAGA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I've been looking for some bomb ribs in Memphis and I have to say- so far- Centrals ribs are my top.

Doesn't a BBQ bologna sandwich take you back to your childhood? 4 oz. slab of bologna slow smoked and then grilled and then drizzled with BBQ sauce on a bun with coleslaw. Yeah, it takes you back. In a good way. I tried my husband's pulled pork (although pulled pork is one of my least favorite items on a BBQ restaurant's menu, it does seem to be very popular in the Deep South), and it was all right. It was pulled pork. I thought this was a-okay BBQ, but I'd definitely be willing to give it a second shot, because if I did get Memphis-style ribs, can I even say I have eaten Memphis BBQ?

They have the typical sides and you can get the meat only if you want.  Service is quick and they will take your order, bring your food, and pick up your plates quickly.

Ribs - outstanding, chicken - moist, brisket - very thinly sliced, which was new for us, and a little dry, but the flavor ok. Tried a variety of sauces, the mild was good, the vinegar not great, the mustard ok, and the hot - blow the roof off your mouth hot. The coleslaw was nothing to write home about, but the beans were fantastic. Very good service, casual atmosphere, able to relax and watch a basketball game. Here was the kicker - the basketball game wasn't over, and we wanted to watch the end, so we ordered dessert to kill some time. Best. Decision. Ever. The peanut butter pie was unbelievable. Just sublime.
