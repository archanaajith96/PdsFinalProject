Therefore...it's an exciting time when I begin a 5-star review, one that has few if any negatives and lots and lots and lots of superlatives.On a recent visit to Philadelphia we began a search, albeit a short one, for a convenient place to have a leisurely dinner. Requirements: simple menu, reasonably prices, close to our hotel.Fellow Yelpers....you did it again! We read your reviews, followed your advice and walked through the door into \"Tria\" -  (Tria Cafe Wash West), just a few steps from our hotel door, on the corner of Spruce St and S.12th.The place is relative small (cozy is a nicer word) and noisy (a busy beehive of activity might be more polite). All the seats at street level were filled with convivial patrons eating, drinking and conversing...so we were guided by Pat, an amiable, cheerful, and attentive host, up a flight of stairs to the second floor. Since the 2nd level is also open to the  first floor, it too was a bit noisy, although very tolerable. We indicated we wanted to share several of the items listed on the menu. \"No problem; that will be fine,\" was the response. So we ordered drinks and several items from their snack, salads, and sandwich menu.1. Olive Oil-Rosemary Potato Chips - OMG! Everybody and their cousin makes in-house chips these days. But, these were absolutely the best chips anyone in our group had ever tasted! (So we ordered them again.)  2. Roasted Beets with Feta - our least favorite, but ok.3. Bruschetta topped with Goat Cheese and Basil Pesto - delizioso!4.Truffled Mushroom with Fontina - truffle (oil) easily can be overdone - not these....on point savory bites!5. Pistachio Herbed Ricotta with Lavender Honey - so subtle and sinfully delicious.6. Brie de Nangis with Allagash Cherries (mild, buttery - made south of Paris Brie and wonderfully tart cherries - oh my!)7. Roasted Beets and Goat Cheese Salad topped with crushed almonds and Balsamic Vinaigrette \"Winner-Winner\" for one of our friends.8. Smoked Turkey with Cabot Cheddar, Smoked Bacon, Tomato, Arugula, and Truffle-Herb Aioli. Undoubtedly the overall 1st Prize winner for me. (Because we went back the next night and I ordered it for a second time.)Tria has a great wines and a diverse beer list (33 different brews the 2 nights we were there)...but wait! There's more...We also ordered Pistachio Ricotta Cheesecake with Cherry Compote & Pistachio Crumb...and we had Flourless Chocolate Torte with Honey Mascarpone And Raspberries our second night. Decadent delights.Yes, it was all so good we returned a second night!To Pat & the rest off the staff who looked after us as if we were very special guests...Thank You! Thank You!Tria's website sums up this place in a perfect paragraph: \"No televisions, karaoke, entertainment or other modern diversions. Talk, sip, bite, repeat. Our ever-changing fermentation menus are diverse and seasonal, and are complemented by a European-style cafe menu of light gourmet fare.\" #true2aT"}, {"review_id": "BP28LhCrK36JdCiftHUogg", "user_id": "Ilxu0W6gm_ywuwZci1zEJQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Great bar and restaurant in downtown Philadelphia.

I even came here on my wedding night. If friends or family are in town, we go to Tria. It's a part of my routine and should be part of everyone's routine. Every time -EVERY time- I've come here, I'm treated with the best service in all of Philadelphia, an excellent beer and wine selection and incredibly well thought out menu. They even keep Tired Hands on tap consistently (who does that?). There are multiple items that I crave on the weekly basis. I've already made arrangements  to ensure that the Truffled egg toast, and ricotta lavender honey bruschetta are the last things I eat before I die. Come here, order everything, drink everything. I've never once ordered anything I didn't like. Come on Sunday for \"Sunday school\" to get a featured beer wine and cheese for half off. It's not a scheme to get rid of stuff that doesn't sell, it's always a great drink that's hard to find and pairs well with the featured cheese. Also to highlight, I really enjoy how their menu is setup to encourage trying new things. They give a description and background of each cheese beer and wine. And every server is extremely knowledgeable. I don't know who trains the servers but they deserve a raise. So do all the servers. Hell, give everyone a raise. This place is awesome. PRO TIP: Come to the Washington west location every time. There's rarely ever a wait and you get the same service as the Tria on 18th and sansom."}, {"review_id": "b1by5EHReZJDEWQ87koz4g", "user_id": "bpBUPublFvkgI2RVGPDQvw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "This is a very cute restaurant.

Even approaching the restaurant the area reminded me of the west village but more manageable. Less cars piling to go back to dirty jersey. Street parking is more easily attainable on a Saturday. Philly is definitely on the way up. A lot of young artsy types out and about around here including the servers at Tria cafe. It's pretty dark inside yet inviting. Not too serious though. Good date spot. It reminded me of a wine bar I went to years ago near west 4th street in the nyu area. The figs with gorgonzola and prosciutto was delicious and decently priced at $5.50 Ditto for the bruschetta ricotta, gouda and the salmon salad. Everything we ordered was pretty good and well presented. The turkey cranberry panini with bacon was $12 and had a bit more substance to it as a meal. A wine off the menu recommended by the friendly and helpful waitress was delicious and exactly what we were looking for. We wanted something fruity and aromatic not too sweet but not too dry. The lambrusco by cleto charli was awesome! It was served slightly chilled and hit the spot.While this wouldn't be my top choice on a very hungry stomach, just over $100 was enough to feed three people and provide three glasses of wine. Not cheap but not bad either and a place like this in nyc would be more expensive for sure."}, {"review_id": "gllmSLx0CaDneNfeXc21ng", "user_id": "Ttn1RtATzZBtWsx6MoPGqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/5/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The various Tria locations are all great, and this one - perhaps the original Tria? - is perhaps my favorite, being a bit more roomy compared to the Tria West. Seating upstairs provides a somewhat quieter area. I recommend getting in a bit early, as the place does fill up. Incredible wines and beers, as well as the food (tapas size) selections. On a recent visit, our server, Jill, confidently recommended the Avec les bons Vœux de la brasserie Dupont - she was right! I'll try to get back while they still have it. For snacks, we enjoyed the white bean spread and a cheese selection. The very attentive staff brought more bread as we worked through what was first served. On a more recent visit, the mushroom with Fontina toast was excellent, very simple, yet really satisfying. And may I say that NOT having a TV was an excellent decision by the owners."}, {"review_id": "KHMTDlBG8xIxSlnuYDqOTg", "user_id": "J5ZkVQFLmsNjWW1uJRDPsw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Amazing ambiance.

I especially love coming in when it's cold out and I pull the heavy curtains open and sit at the bar. It's such a relaxing atmosphere. Most of the time we don't eat. I do like their small plates and lunch is available but for me a few glasses of wine is what I like to have. I usually ask for recommendations from the staff and they are very knowledgeable. The last time I had a red that was perfect. I wish I could remember what it was but it was just a lovely glass of wine and just what I was looking for. This is a completely neighborhood joint and although I am not from the neighborhood I do enjoy stopping in when I am in town regardless of where I am staying at. We will Uber over from old city. Walk from Rittenhouse. It's always a must do when we are in town and we always bring family and friends. This place makes me happy. I hope that it makes you happy too.

It's where a great friend and I had our last bubbly drinks together before she moved to Baltimore and where I poured my sad heart out after a hellish break up to another friend over some \"zippy\" Sauvignon Blanc (the white wine here is categorized into Zippy, Smooth, and Luscious hehe). Must get food items here: truffled egg toast with fontina, the duck salad, and your picking of their bruschetta options (my favs are the ricotta w lavender honey and the truffled mushroom with fontina).Happy hour is 5-7 on week nights (unsure about Fridays I think it's not included) with selected daily cheese and wine/beer options, seats fill up fast so don't come too late.

As for the food, the olives were great because they paired well with almost everything else we ordered. The mushroom bruschetta was tasty and satisfying with that umami flavor.

There was only one other person eating.The menu, brought over by friendly staff, is affordable and takes a fun and different approach at light, healthy eating. I ordered both the burrata  and the mushroom bruschetta. The bruschettas come with two to an order and are a good size, especially because they only fall around $5. I also ordered the mozzarella panini which had prosciutto, peppers, and pesto. Everything was tasty but my favorite was the mushroom bruschetta.By the time I was ready to leave, most of the tables were occupied with people sipping wine and watching people walk by in the open space.

My favorite are the Goat Cheese with Basil Pesto and the Truffled Mushroom with Fontina.  The Brie de Nangis with Allagash Cherries and Pistachio Herbed Ricotta with Lavender Honey are close seconds.  They are all good though, even if I didn't list another as one of my tops.  Basically, just make sure you get Bruschetta when you come to Tria.  These items are all perfectly balanced and go perfectly with a glass of wine.  they are pretty big too! so if you are sharing, two Bruschetta, a few snack plates or cheese and a dessert are a great if you are just hanging with friends and looking to nosh a bit with your wine.From their Snacks section, I usually gravitate towards the:Chicken Liver Mousse with Shallot Marmalade, Grapes and Whole Grain MustardWarm Poached Black Mission Figs with Gorgonzola and Prosciutto di ParmaTestaroli Pasta with Basil Pesto, Spicy Sausage and Parmigiano-ReggianoOlive Oil Rosemary Potato Chips with Herbed Aioli.I also enjoy the Roasted Beets and Goat Cheese with Arugula, Crushed Almonds, Red Onion and Balsamic Vinaigrette salad, or the Grilled Eggplant Panino with Taleggio Cheese, Tomato Marmalatta and Kale Pesto sandwich, or the Lancaster Turkey, Bacon and Cheddar Sandwich with Tomato and Herbed Aioli whenI am really hungry.They have yummy desserts too!  All of the food here is delicious, and make sure you order a delicious cheese plate to enjoy along with your wine!ATMOSPHERE: The place is adorable and cozy, rustic and a things are spaced out nicely so you don't feel too crowded even when they are busy.  They also have outside seating and heat lamps outside, so on a cool day, you can still sit comfortably outside.STAFF: The staff knows their stuff,  do not be afraid to ask questions, and they are great at making recommendations!I highly recommend coming to Tria if you are in the area, especially for their happy hour!"}, {"review_id": "wYy5GbR-QliTH8M91g58hQ", "user_id": "cunpzBkEboEewYlFofWhTQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/18/2017", "text": "This review is strictly of the food. I do plan to come back for wine, though. I ordered the garlic rosemary chips. Although they were only $2, I expected a little more. There were about as many chips as you would find in a lays snack pack! The rosemary was very strong, but I like rosemary so I didn't mind. My friend had the pesto bruschetta. If you love pesto, this is the snack for you. It came with two very small pieces of bread with a small amount of goat cheese but absolutely loaded with pesto. The stuff was dripping off. My friend actually had to take some off because it was overwhelming. The atmosphere at Tría is nice and the staff are relatively friendly. If you're coming for wine and cheese I am sure the experience will be more exciting."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tria-cafe-wash-west-philadelphia-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
