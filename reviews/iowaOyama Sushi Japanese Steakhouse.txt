I get to explore various 'local' cuisines within the Cedar Rapids area. But yes we are in IOWA - so don't expect too much if not beef and corn. But I love my Japanese food and wanted to see what it would taste like in Iowa. My verdict: NOT BAD for the Midwest! As you walk into Oyama, you see various signs for it being voted \"Best Restaurant in Cedar Rapids\" and a pretty nice set up. The restaurant is split into two: one for Hibachi, and one for regular diners. You can order from either menu in each area, so it just depends on where you'd like to sit. As soon as you peruse the menu, a server delivers hot towels for you to wipe your hands. Shortly after, the salad arrived along with our appetizer. The restaurant was fairly empty at 5:30PM on a Tuesday but filled up shortly after. Diners were mainly couples so the restaurant remained fairly quiet. I ordered the salmon hibachi which came with garlic flavored rice, cooked mixed vegetables along with one of the hot pots. While in Iowa, I was too scared of ordering raw fish but a couple other tables did get some and it looked pretty decent. Not your best quality food, but great for Cedar Rapids - especially for the service and presentation of food."}, {"review_id": "s7Nho3bPTZ8mkN3L34JBTg", "user_id": "6WgyqedEFSS0Pk-AQLOiyQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/28/2017", "text": "This is a good place for sushi, and an ok place for hibachi.  I found this place on Yelp while traveling for work.  I will say that I am very fussy about my sushi.  The rice was a little dry.  I found myself using the dipping sauce more than usual.  The hibachi was ok.  Our table had three different orders of hibachi, and the overwhelming opinion was great veggies!  The meat was a little chewy, and just ever so slightly overlooked.I would go again and stick to the sushi."}, {"review_id": "mQG1y8FeoOpnveryiR8fMg", "user_id": "FHtEgjmC0qzEShf61d544A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/1/2017", "text": "For quality exotic food in Cedar Rapids, Oyama is a pretty safe bet. The atmosphere is pleasant with a casual vibe, and a very kind waiting staff. The rice dishes and entrees are simple, yet enjoyable, and this is one of the few to get quality sushi in Cedar Rapids. The sushi isn't top quality, but it's definitely good enough. Next time you're craving something foreign for dinner, I recommend the restaurant."}, {"review_id": "SnuBONHt8pqvejxL-fysQw", "user_id": "TOYQdLr5gXTV-0v9Ds-R2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/7/2017", "text": "Omg!!! The best sushi ever!!! Damn its so good that in 1 year of me moving to Cedar Rapids I have been here more than 20 times!!! The various options of sushi that are available, its super delicious. The combination of the shrimp tempura with mango roll is incredibly great. The Best friend roll is my second favorite. I even love their cucumber and cream cheese roll its tiny but different. Their service is super quick & always friendly. My friend wanted to see sake bomb how it's done the guy got couple of chopsticks & did it in the old fashion way. I loved it.Good choices of drinks which are refreshing & not that expensive too."}, {"review_id": "ibKKeB80ti9ioG6kU7BuJg", "user_id": "2YbwbEnsukz1O5GWWEVybw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/27/2017", "text": "Was in town and craving sushi, so naturally we picked the place with the highest Yelp reviews and hoped for the best. Oyama was fairly empty when we came for lunch, but there is also tons of seating--the place is cavernous. We ordered the seaweed salad (fairly pricey compared to most places), an eel roll, and a roll that had both unagi and yellowtail. All were pretty tasty and fairly fresh. I was treading cautiously because I haven't had great luck with sushi in Cedar Rapids (Wasabi, I'm looking at you) but Oyama was a good spot and did the trick. Like that one meme says, \"Not the best but still good.\""}, {"review_id": "4R7QjLgDP6OPEgXFcrGRQQ", "user_id": "bf-56jwAjZubeWxdPop0nA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/11/2016", "text": "First things first: We are in Iowa, people. All you relocated Southern Californian or other coastal dwellers who now find yourselves in land locked Iowa, far, far away from any source of fresh fish, please stop comparing Oyama to the sushi joint back where you are from.  Just not a fair comparison.  Second, sushi in Iowa is going to be basic.  Otherwise,  Iowans won't buy it.  This is the land of steak and potatoes with ranch on the side, hence all the rolls with cream cheese, sweet potato  and fried shrimp.  Ya gotta ease the Midwesterners into the sushi world.Third, just be happy we even have sushi in CR.  Fifteen years ago you had to drive to IC for a tuna roll!Anyhow, Oyama is my favorite sushi place on the north side.   It is consistent and gets the job done.  Explore the appetizers like gomale and seaweed salad.   Nibble on edamame.   My favorites are the Fiesta Roll with its hint of jalapeño and the Leprechaun Roll with three fish atop a shrimp tempura roll.  Beginners should get the Maki dinner special and try the sweet potato roll, California roll, and salmon with avocado roll.Don't forget hot tea!"}, {"review_id": "Pbc6dD5LgPmGfEKPxsZR1g", "user_id": "IcU2n6r43RD9rbyeULyjGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/23/2017", "text": "We've been here for date night twice now - once for dine in and once for take out.

It's one of the only places in Cedar Rapids I'm excited to eat at and frequent more than once a year. I felt compelled to write a review because I was REALLY impressed with the service here. Typically there will be two or three different waiters who serve you, which means that your needs are always taken care of. Someone is always stopping by to refill your water or take away plates! The waiters are very skilled at keeping an eye on if you need anything. Food came out very fast on a Friday night as well!

That being said I also prefer to eat sashimi ... A Double whammy for a land locked sushi in CR. This is the exact reason I am writing this review. After my third visit and having nothing but an absolutely positive experience with amazing sashimi I must say that they are doing it right. The 15pc sashimi \"regular\" is 20$ ... Which is about in line with San Diego prices ... What I was not expecting was the size of the cuts of sashimi. This dish portion wise would be double  even 2.5 times as expensive back home and every sushi chef selected piece of fish was fresh and absolutely perfect. My business counterpart ordered various rolls each time and she had nothing but stellar reviews of those as well. Saying that all the ingredients were fresh and tasted amazing.If you haven't done so I absolutely recommend that you give it a try.Thank you Oyama for restoring my faith in sushi restaurants in small land locked towns."}, {"review_id": "FhjLg_f9zb6jQYXzL30c2Q", "user_id": "Ob4P5RLRo6CxOl0xmyOO6g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/23/2014", "text": "I took my daughter here for her birthday and we both loved it.

They had the restaurant sing my daughter \"Happy Birthday\" accompanied by a gong while my daughter wore a red paper chef hat. Very fun, indeed!We will go back to sit grill-side next time.
