Serving three seatings at 6, 8:30, 11:00 ( this is Vegas) the small restaurant is completely full so definitely book in advance. There were five of us at a large rectangular table in a room with only one other similar table.  Traditional Japanese decor of simplicity.We were shown to our table and presented with menus and an explanation of the menu and the options available to us. I don't usually look at a menu and feel overwhelmed but this time I did -- there are a lot of choices and because we were \"first timers\" we decided to let the chef decide as we ordered the Premier Chef selection. This turned out to be about 10 dishes for the five of us. It was more than enough food and fairly priced though pricy at $100 per person. But is 10 special, unique, high quality selections at $10 each pricy? First the quality-- the whole fish was flown in fresh from Japan. The blue fin, likewise and melted in my mouth it was so fresh, tasty and I wanted more. We alldid."}, {"review_id": "GT_j9ArhcOm0I1OXeVnIlA", "user_id": "enBEs1F5zWiuJHaGiuVD_w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Service: excellent Food: good but not impressive Price: overpriced We wandered into Sweet Raku last night.

I was seated right away, to the relief of my companions who had arrived early instead of slightly late. Seriously, guys, they hold the reservation for 15 minutes!Anyway, the service was great and the food was impressive throughout. I think I was looking for a few more moments of unbelievable flavor to make this a comfortable 5 stars rather than a 4-point-something. I'll describe what I had in the $100 omakase (with menu prices if I think it's a regular menu item):- Raku's Tofu (not sure if this was $3.50 half portion or $5.50 full). Silky-soft tofu with bonito shavings and green onions. The soy sauce at the table did more than the green tea salt to add flavor. Would concur that it's a must-try here.- Oyster (from Washington?) with Italian sturgeon caviar (special). Definitely one of the splurges of the meal, with everything in one bite-sized punch (except an herb garnish) of light saltiness and a sweet oyster.- Sashimi platter (special). Two pieces per person of shima aji and kanpachi, and one piece per person of raw blue fin tuna, and marinated/grilled blue fin tuna. Everything tasted fresh, although I would've liked a little more flavor from the non-tuna fish. The marinated blue fin was fantastic and had a meaty appeal. I'm thinking that a lot of the hidden cost was found in this four-dishes-in-one plate.- Enoki Mushroom Wrapped With Bacon ($3). A pretty tasty skewer, but not fantastic. I should add that the Raku festival booth offered so many awesome grilled meat and fish on skewers, and in comparison I wasn't amazed by this.- Kobe Beef Filet with Wasabi ($12). Another skewer, and one which I somehow found less impressive than other high-priced meat skewers which I've had off-site by Raku. The wasabi was fresh and didn't taste anywhere near overpowering. It's just that the meat didn't seem as fatty as you'd expect.- Iberico Pork? ($10). Described by our server as acorn-fed pork shoulder cooked to medium-rare. I did find pink color as I got into the middle, and I didn't develop a stomachache. Now this one was amazingly juicy and fatty, with some hints of the acorn flavor.- Fried Fish w/ a soy broth (special). We were all getting full and less attentive, but I think this may have been the baby Japanese seabass on the specials menu. it was tender and flaky. The broth was lightly sweet and enjoyable, and the mushrooms and what we thought was mochi in the bowl were also delicious.- Foie Gras Bowl ($18.50). I think I'm just about over foie at this point, but it definitely was the richest (and likely most expensive) rice bowl that I've had, aside from chirashi. It's a decent portion of the controversial liver product, and aside from the marinade, it only had subtle flavors on its own.- Green Tea Creme Brulee ($6). Some of the sugar glass was almost burnt, but it came with a matcha-ful creme underneath and a smooth matcha ice cream scoop on top, along with some nondescript whipped cream and a fresh raspberry garnish. Not the most interesting dessert, but you probably didn't come to this Raku for dessert, right? By the way, this was also served with a hot hojicha (roasted green tea) on the side, which was the true end to this great meal.Overall, the pacing was good and some items were quite impressive, but I think I would've been just as happy with the $75 omakase (explained as equally portioned but with some less expensive dishes) or with choosing various items a la carte. As such, I will keep my review of Raku to 4 stars for now, with the expectation that I won't wait several years for my next visit. The flavors weren't always there, but the ingredients, presentation, and service were."}, {"review_id": "pt-Ssm2YPP7dwhfqXifpJw", "user_id": "F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "During my last trip to Vegas, I managed to squeeze in another visit to one of my favorite spots, Aburiya Raku!  At this point it's become an annual tradition for me and a birthmonth indulgence for myself.Although I've been here several times, their menu is so extensive that there are still a whole lot of items that I still haven't tried.  I finally tried their Crispy Asparagus Okaki and Cold Green Tea Soba Noodle with Poached Egg.

Not only did I get attitude from the lady that answered but she wanted my credit card information for a party larger than 6. I have a reservation for 6ppl for the weekend. I am letting all my fellow yelp readers to make sure you make a reservation for a party of 5 or less as the receptionist thinks she can ask for your credit card information over the phone. Now that is scary! Why would I want them to have my credit card info?  I have been dining at this establishment since It was a little hole in the wall, and the chefs are amazing! The food is spectacular....But if you have to deal with making reservations and the lady asking for my credit card info? With all the fraud going on nowadays? No way will I give you my credit card info over the phone!! The attentive service here is going down hill too! The last time I ate here, I had to ask for a bottled water to be poured 3x within a 20 minute period waiting for water! When we ordered sake, it comes in a matter of 3-5 minutes! This place expanded and they forget about the customers on the other side. The decor is nice and the sake selection is a great variety! Their fish is the freshest and the chefs always prepare the food with amazing presentation! But beware of the reservationist during the day time. She's terrible and why would anyone want to give credit card info over the phone! We always pay cash on top of that so why would we even give this lady our credit card info? I hope she leaves this wonderful establishment, because she does not make this restaurant experience exceptional. With her talking to people on the phone?

We did enjoy the agedashi tofu with the mushroom and sauce, delicious. The garlic beef skewers also tasted pretty good. The grilled chicken was another item we could do without since they just tasted pretty standard. The wagyu sashimi was incredibly good, and the kurobuta pork belly was good and very tender.

Lotus of Siam and Raku are the 2 places I always desperately try to work into my Vegas time. For foodies: I would recommend ordering omokase and roasted green tea and let them take care of you. The $75 vs $100 is just a difference in a few more expensive ingredients. At $100 price can't be beat for the quality and taste. It's ALOT of food! It leaves your mouth watering and tummy FULL! For couples, might i recommend sharing one omokase order then adding a few items from the menu to ensure you get to try their beautiful omokase dishes without wasting food. This is one of the rare places you can ask for some minor alterations in the omokase (ie, request a specific item you really want) Today, I was craving the foie gras custard and hubby only wanted cooked items, both of which they were happy to accommodate.I have yet to try the LA location but looking forward to it. Still, this one is like an old friend's place I like to hang out whenever Vegas calls.

I thought Raku is only in Vegas but it looks like Raku is also in LA but it seems more expensive for the same food so I'm glad I came to this location while in Vegas! And of course, the main chef is in the Vegas location when we were there!Reservation is very hard to get and rightly so! Larger parties have to reserve at least a month in advance. They only take reservations via phone between 2pm-2am M-Sat and they don't always pick up the phone. Reservation is highly recommended or get ready for a long wait.We got the omakase meal and there were two choices: $75 vs $100 both are 9 course meals but $100 Omakase dinner offers more premium ingredients per our server. We opt for the 100 meal.Getting seated was the only frustration of the night but after we got seated, food and service were awesome! Our tea cup was tiny and we constantly drank but we were never left without tea!I have the say the progression of the meal was also well executed! First course was the Raku tofu. Great appetizer to start off the meal. Tofu was light in flavor but you are directly to add green onion, bonito flakes, green tea salt, house made sauce to the tofu. I love the texture of the tofu which was very similar to a Panna Cotta. Next came the sashimi plate. Good but nothing out of the usual good sashimi. The fried asparagus with crunchy rice batter was delicious! Now came the highlight of my night: the perfect langoustine! Omg it was cook just right with the meat slightly transparent. Flavor was awesome! So ridiculously delicious! It was love at first sight for my husband when the wasabi wagyu beef skewer came to our table! And it tasted just like the way it looks - juicy and flavorful! Then the pork belly skewer came and also did not disappoint! The fried fish was next but I didn't get what type of fish it was. The fish was sitting on house dashi. I was not in love with the fish but it definitely wasn't bad. I enjoyed the dashi, mushroom and wheat mochi more. Last savory course of the night was the foie gras don! I love how he added texture to the dish with just a sprinkle of finely cut lettuce. The foie gras was perfectly seasoned and cooked. Dessert was a green tea Creme brûlée with green tea ice cream. Also very delicious! I loved almost every dish tonight and really want to come back soon! Make sure to drop by his dessert place (Sweet Raku) in the same plaza! Go even if you are super full and had dessert already! You won't regret it! I sure didn't!"}, {"review_id": "Y2CJdSkiQP9EGng3flxQ4A", "user_id": "lQBZo8_mm80dbwI5bo5c_w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Came here late at 1 because we were craving skewers.
