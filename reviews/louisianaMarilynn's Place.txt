Today I decided to check it out without looking on Yelp. The place doesn't look fancy but it's fine for me. They have tables outside which is perfect for a nice day. There is one small close room with AC I guess. Their menu is ok. They offer different seafood plates. They also have a bar with bunch of different alcohol drinks. I guess people can walk in for just drinks. Price is little bit higher than places around but not too bad. I like their music. It's more energy than other sleepy background music from other restaurants. Staffs are friendly and helpful. I got a seafood gumbo, a fried crawfish and a margarita. Food was fine. Gumbo was little bit salty. I like my drink. Their salad that came with fried crawfish was good too. My experience with this place was great."}, {"review_id": "Vv2E93mrQ-fAmpQ7NSb-Nw", "user_id": "GqycWSUR6QhxrPY9HeJz6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "When looking for a place for lunch we found Marilynn's Place and were glad we did.  It is a very casual place, a converted gas station and has its own small parking lot.  They have Po-boys (sandwiches), salads, desserts and two sizes of Louisiana entrees.  We went for the small size of entrees, Chicken and Andouille Jambalaya for my wife ($7.95 small, $10.95 large), and Crawfish Ettoufee for me ($8.95 small, $11.95 large).  I also had Sweet Tea, which is self serve. Small was the right size for us and we were both very happy with the flavor.  This is some of the best food we have had in Louisiana and we would come back anytime.  The $3 Beignets or $5.50 for Beignets and Coffee would be very tempting another day."}, {"review_id": "VuKJGXP7mfbTbFpRD_eu5Q", "user_id": "zmWidsq6NQP8loJPJq9DcQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Best place ever!!!

We ordered the combo plate of crawfish etouffee and the curry catfish ($12.95), the cajun cheese fries and the bread pudding ($5.95). It took a good 30 minutes for our food to come out. You order at the counter and they'll call your name when you order is ready. The problem is when there are multiple people with the same first name and they pick up your order by mistake or vice versa. The staff was super nice and kept coming around to apologize but this seems like an easily preventable issue by maybe using numbers instead of names. The crawfish etouffee was a big portion but not very much flavor. The cajun cheese fries were steak cut french fries with shredded cheese melted on top with some jalapenos. I'm guessing the jalapenos is what made them cajun? The catfish had a good thick cornmeal breading and the touch of curry was pretty good.When we ordered the bread pudding at the counter at the same time as ordering our entree we were told to come back and let them know when we were ready for it. So we went to the counter and let them know but after another 20 minutes or so it was apparent they had forgotten to make it which the employee at the counter did realize before we had to ask about it again. Our name was called to come get our dessert and they had made beignets instead of bread pudding which the cook immediately acknowledged as a mistake and told us to keep the beignets while he made the bread pudding. Now these beignets were great and I would order those again. When the bread pudding finally came out I regretted waiting so long for it. It did have an espresso cream sauce that was pretty good but the consistency of the bread was off. It was too heavy and dense and just kind of like a brick.I would come back and try something else on the menu, but just be prepared to wait."}, {"review_id": "sV3dhhUz-vkpLyYLBF7dJA", "user_id": "3VvQ-FFu6hGIvvyr6LL_jA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "This was a fun visit.Some food we really liked and some we didn't.The William Edward Joyce Curry Fried Catfish Poboy was our favorite.

To be honest, this was my first time ever trying beignets. To me, it tasted similar to funnel cake. I wasn't super impressed but it also wasn't bad.

Since I would be nowhere near New Orleans or Baton Rouge I figured Shreveport would be the next best spot. Since this is a highly rated spot I expected stellar food. Boy was I wrong. Heck the gumbo choices in Austin at my fav place are more better than what I had here. I ordered 4 things from their menu and the only good meal was the seafood gumbo. I ordered crawfish etoufee, shrimp Creole, seafood gumbo, and 6 fried boudin. All which came to be $30. The shrimp Creole was the biggest disappointment. It sounded so fancy on the menu but when I tasted it it taste like bland tomato soup. Yuk I wanted to take it back I was that disappointed but figured it was too late since I ate out of it. The crawfish etoufee had no flavor and tasted nothing like the etoufee I'd had in the past. It was a step up from that shrimp Creole. Lastly the seafood gumbo was the lesser of two evils. The only thing I didn't like about it was it had hard shrimp tails in it. The boudin had no flavor unlike boudin in the past I had was delicious and flavorful. But the boudin was decent. At first the cashier said they didn't have any but then I guess they found some somewhere in the back. Cashier wasn't very helpful and seemed somewhat cold. I definately won't be back and if ever I'm in Louisiana I'll just go to New Orleans or Baton Rouge for good food."}, {"review_id": "0OZKbwhiBa3Zk8KfaxgJLA", "user_id": "O8IS8uI9fb7BTcnZsDP2jA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Best crawfish I've had all season!  I only wish they had them all the time.

The place has a very welcoming vibe and the staff was very friendly, and the food came out in a timely manner.We had heard great things about this place previously, and we decided to split the 14-inch catfish po-boy and a side of fries.The flavor of the catfish po-boy was awesome: the catfish pieces were strip style and were perfectly fried and had a nice cornmeal crunch to them. They only issue we ran into is that we ended up wishing there were more of everything on the po-boy (catfish, tomatoes, lettuce, etc). On the 14-inch sandwich there was about 5 small strips of catfish and about 4 slices of tomato - so there were definitely some bites that were all bread.Overall, the flavor was there and it was still delicious. Next time, I would probably go for the shrimp po-boy since the table next to us got it and there seemed to be a better shrimp to bread ratio."}, {"review_id": "rQ_f3NTod0KGVedP9W9Npw", "user_id": "J-4MHdyfCE1OE57tARBXhg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "I'm in Shreveport visiting a relative and i was looking for a place with good Poboys.  Found this place and it did not disappoint.  I ordered the change order poboy and a catfish platter for my siblings.  The food was very tasty!
