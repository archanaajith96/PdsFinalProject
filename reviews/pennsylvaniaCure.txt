We visited Cure this past Saturday to celebrate my husband's birthday. Cure is fine dining with a smoky, approachable ambiance. It definitely strikes a unique balance in attending to all the details, like personal phone calls to confirm reservations and ask if there are any allergies, preferences, etc. and not being too stuffy. It is a pretty small place, so ALWAYS make reservations, and be prepared to be a little flexible with your times (for example, when I called for a Saturday reservation, the only times available were 5:00 PM and 8:00 PM, which was fine for us but I know some people prefer a more neutral dining time). Once we got there, we hemmed and hawed over whether to go with the 6 course tasting menu or get the large salumi plate and share some other items. In the end, our server convinced us to indulge in the tasting menu (though did not include the wine pairings) and we were not disappointed. My favorite parts were the smoked salmon crostini, coddled eggs (a little salty but such a unique dish), and EVERYTHING on the dessert plate. They even put a candle on my husband's dessert plate which was a nice recognition of his birthday without Applebee's-level group singing cheesiness.We also ordered a couple of cocktails, but the food was certainly the star of the evening. Certainly not an inexpensive evening but well worth it."}, {"review_id": "eJNjPATpQj2Ud58BzNz_Wg", "user_id": "Fd3GvZTer-2_EwMzL3ptAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This reason for Cure getting a 5 star this time, is mainly because of how wonderfully the staff responded to an issue with the food that one of my dining companion's experienced. However food-wise, my rank would be closer to a 4-Star.So, let me start of with the food I got first: - Shrub drink prices have gone up from $3 when I visited in 2017 to $4 in 2018 (same size glass tho'!). They had a new one this time that I really liked, made of fig, bay leaf and cinnamon - it was refreshingly tarty and tasted similar to a kombucha drink.- for my main I got the large Salumi ($55) and this was served with pickled veggies (the turmeric cauliflower was a specific stand-out), x2 kinds of mustard (there was a Violet mustard which was deliciously tangy and which I first read as VIOLENT mustard and I had a quiet chuckle as I imagined this amorphous mustard paste rising from the plate and giving me a knock-out punch, ha! But anyway, I digress) and two pieces of focaccia. The charcuterie consisted of 4 pieces of each meats. There was a lot of charcuterie and when I got served, the waitress pointed out each one but honestly it all got blurry as I worked my way thru the board. What was great however that each piece was fresh and tasted fantastic! The charcuterie with pistachio was my fave but everything was really distinctly flavorful. I do however wish the board came with some sort of a Pâté / terrine/ galantine/ roulade or maybe even a small slice of the pork rilletes - I wanted some unctuous after all that cured meat! Oh also there was one salumi that bore a distinct taste to jamón ibérico, which was a nice surprise. If you are curious what this is - this ham comes from a special breed of Spanish Hogs that's diet consists only of chestnuts and this gives the ham a very distinctive flavour but the one served here was a gentler flavor.- One of my co-diners got the Vadouvan Cauliflower Soup for ($10) and she got the caramelized crab on the side for me, as she didn't want this seafood component. She's not a fan of Cauliflower but she ended up enjoying this dish and I polished off that crab - it was delish!- another co-diner got \"A Nice Little Salad\" for $10 and this was a really good sized plate! The radishes looked especially lovely.                                             - My co-diner who got small Chestnut Ravioli for $13 raved about this dish! I was sitting next to her and could totally smell the earthiness of the chestnuts and hazelnuts in the brown butter! - another winner for our table was the Laurel Hill Farm Trout for $28. It was a half fillet of the trout and I was told the burnt lemon really just elevated the taste of the fish. No one wanted to share and give me a bite, so I'm taking their word for it ;-)- Choucroute for $34 was a bit of a disappointment for one of my co-diners. It was plated beautifully but the portion given for the pork, the boudin blanc and the boudin noir were really small. My co-diner was still hungry after he finished off the plate. Not a big bloke's meal...- so I'm saving the problem child of our meal for last. One of my co-diners got the Heritage Farm Chicken ($29) and loved the labneh + harissa pastes. But the chicken which looked like it had been in a sous vide bath, was totally pink and felt spongy when she cut into it. We alerted the waiter and he said he would switch out the dish, but my co-diner felt really uncomfortable about even making another attempt with the chicken, and he change her food choice and she ordered the Chestnut Ravioli instead. The waiter totally didn't make a fuss about this request and instead everything was handled so perfectly and smoothly - his attitude really made a massive difference and my co-diner's dining experience ended up with a high note rather than with her remembering the uncooked chicken!Lastly, we did get dessert - that Lava Molten cake.. so good! Rich and yet wonderfully light and the pistachio cream was so sweet and distinctly nutty. Great way to end the meal.So overall verdict? I reckon the tasting menu is honestly the way to go. But I'll still come back and check them out again, when next in Pittsburgh.Note - this would have been Yelp Review 71/2018, but I don't count reviews for places I have previously reviewed"}, {"review_id": "R_oBKIuS-s4WdBfOnlh5yw", "user_id": "s9cI2U6kyJj8yTFNvmfveg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Cure has been on my restaurant bucket list for years.

In case the name and the logo weren't obvious enough, the chef is a skilled charcutier and his talent really shows through their small but original and refined menu.I cannot recommend the charcuterie board enough. It featured a great variety of salumi served with small pickled vegetables. It was quite a delightful experience trying each cuts. I also liked their drink list; seriously, they had me at house-made sodas. While it was beautiful and complemented the meal well, I thought it was a bit too small and overpriced.Overall, I've enjoyed my dining experience at Cure and would not hesitate to recommend it.

We made reservations ahead of time and confirmed allergies with a staff member. They didn't seem to be aware though; when we were ordering, the server did not seem to be aware of SC's allergies and we had to mention it again (This was the third time allergies were discussed; once when placing the reservation, second when the reservation was confirmed, and third while ordering). However, besides this, the service was really attentive. Multiple staff members walked around to see if guests needed anything, to clear off old dishes/utensils and place new ones, to remove crumbs on tables, and to explain components of each dish (I really like this last part because I can never remember all the ingredients listed on the menu!). We also mentioned we were splitting all the dishes so they were able to either split the meal for us (and give us separate portions) or give us extra dishes to split it ourselves.We ordered:-Salumi (small). SO good. We especially loved the leek ash & porcini salami for it's texture and flavor. The duck speck and ciccioli were also some of our faves. The accompanying focaccia was really soft and had great flavor. It didn't quite work with the nduja (\"spreadable\" salumi). Definitely taste the meats with and without the bread; it's a different experience! The Violet mustard was also really good (I hate mustard but this had a nice fig-gy flavor).-This is Why You're Here. My fave dish of the night. What a fantastic combination of thinly sliced ham with maple notes, peach jam (that really tasted more molasses-y), and lots of basil!-Ravioli  (half). Also delicious! Loved the crispy corn and walnuts! The pasta was made really well.-Charcroute. SC's favorite dish. Pork three ways (pork belly, braised cheek, boudin blanc) which provided interesting textures and flavors. -Foie Blonde. What an interesting dish! We've never had savory macarons before and this was such a unique combination. SC thought it was kinda like a PB&J twist. The mousse-like foie is super salty but pairs perfectly with crunch of the macaron and pistachios and the sweet of the hibiscus jam. -Paw Paw Cream Pie. Reminded us of a deconstructed S'more. We've never had paw paw before and honestly couldn't really pick up what it tasted like. The textures of the cinnamon meringue w/ paw paw curd went well with the graham bits on the bottom. We thought the meringue had a little too much cinnamon on it. The accompanying concord grape ice cream was really tasty (SC and I were just recently talking about how no one ever makes grapes the star of dessert! And while this was an accompaniment, it was still really well done!).Overall, really interesting flavor combinations and ideas; would definitely return!!"}, {"review_id": "M2ThePwYAntdycjzI97S8g", "user_id": "URH7mgjWmZ6chyJudA_6aA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "We had an absolutely amazing meal at Cure.
