Compared to their downtown location, the seating and decor here is more casual and smaller. However, the quality and quantity of food is excellent no matter which location you choose to dine at.My go-to is the Pho Dac Biet because it comes with all the meats that I like-beef brisket slices, beef meatballs, tendon, and tripe. The broth is excellent, and the flavors are amazing. I add hoisin sauce and sriracha to my pho. Definitely try it out!My only complaints are the lack of basil on the veggie plate and not enough meat to noodle ratio."}, {"review_id": "q9RBCpnNIaysAlijvuVqUw", "user_id": "9Ms5wpxVloadWFvDbb77kg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "The downtown location is my fav.  Enough so that I have made frequenting this business quite often!  I love their drink options...the Royal Tea without boba is fabulous!  There sirloin with onion and rice dish is also my fav!  The staff are friendly and attentive!  This is definitely a must go for Tucson dining!!"}, {"review_id": "VNF4jR_Jpb0q9LKoSDudFQ", "user_id": "iCNiJk_p3LPfrZaUwUe1ag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "This location is great! There's no fooling around. Although you won't be rushed, the service is quick and efficient.

Unfortunately, I have to disagree with the majority of Tucson. I came here for dinner Saturday night, and was pleased that they had an entire section in their menu devoted to vegetarian food offerings! However, that's about where my contentment stopped. Upon arrival, I was prepared to wait to get a table, since I've noticed over the past few days of walking past Miss Saigon that it's crowded. What I wasn't prepared for was the poor service and the subpar quality Vietnamese food. I normally love bun noodle bowls, but the one here was underwhelming. The vermicelli noodles were served on the side of the wok tossed vegetables, which were overly saucy to the point of being soupy. Also, the dish itself seemed to lack a strong sense of flavor. To make matters worse, my server didn't check on me at all, didn't ask me how my food was, and didn't refill my water. After sitting at my table held captive like a prisoner, I finally was able to waive a water server down and ask for the check. However, it took forever for me to get my card back, so I sat and waited even longer. I really don't understand what the hype is about this place. The food was meh, and the service was even worse."}, {"review_id": "joVY84OGNyjGIE-wEQDO-A", "user_id": "LktM6BhTBjJRT5L-ZBqfNw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/23/2017", "text": "Wooooow I am so glad I stopped into Miss Saigon this afternoon for an astounding five star meal. I ordered number 48 which included charbroiled chicken in a curry seasoning, vermicelli needles with a light peanut sauce sitting on a bed of cabbage. Upon the first bite I was hooked and didn't stop to breathe until it was all gone! The spice and sweetness was perfectly balanced and the chicken was moist and tender. I asked my husband how his tofu pho was and he said \"flawless.\" I tasted a sample and agree!  The service here is fast and satisfactory on all levels.

Today it is a very popular spot and can be quite crowded on cold nights. Sadly they do not offer vegetable broth for their soups, chicken or beef broth only. I know it's not traditional but other Pho places have it. They do have vegetable rice dishes that are OK but I always find them more cabbage then vegetables. I used to stop in here now for their fried tofu spring rolls. Sometimes they are absolutely delicious and amazing! Other times they are clearly old. They have brown lettuce and wilting herbs. It's a roll of the dice if It will be fresh or not. When I used to eat their Pho their noodles were that way too, sometimes overly greasy and clumped together. I used to like the fish cake but then I learned they're the hot dog of the seafood world. You know, questionable fish leftovers mashed into one pile of mush and label as food. Ew! Sorry, for the tangent! Anyway, some stuff for the vegetarian but not enough that I'd go out of my way for it. BEWARE OF THE PEANUT SAUCE! I'm told it contains chicken broth. Ew again."}, {"review_id": "6RMGMecBE9uUALTwH8lrkg", "user_id": "7fsw7xwm-eamdoQgx4r3_Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/30/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This is supposedly the best Pho in Tucson.

Do yourself a favor, and on those blistering AZ summer days, call in an order of spring rolls and a large coconut snow with boba. It's the perfect light and satisfying meal.
