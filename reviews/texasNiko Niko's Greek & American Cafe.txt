If you have any sort of dietary restrictions (keto, paleo, ideal protein) this is a great place for low carb eaters.I ordered a fresh sea bass flown in from Greece for my mom and I to share with a side of spinach and WOW!!!!!First of all their spinach is amazing. It's the inside filling for the spanakopita I think and I have zero issues with that! It has a ton of umami and is a great option to get dried. I do fear there may be butter or some kind of cheese in it that I'll have to ask for separately next time but it was AMAZING!!! I've actually craved the stuff on more than one occasion. Never done heroin but I imagine Niko Nikos spinach is the same feeling....Now onto the fish!Holy cow. The fish was fresh, cooked perfectly, took longer than the 20 minutes they said but was worth the wait!!!!!!!!!!!!I told them light oil, removed the fried skin and the inside was cooked perfectly with a squeeze of lemon.Started with a notable Greek salad for my mom and I each. My only gripe is 7 dollars for that salad seems really high esp because the olives and other accoutrement are a little sparse but the food was excellent.I'll be back again for the fresh fish.Best day off lunch in a while :)"}, {"review_id": "zthI9lWP2IrDcoeWZmNvbQ", "user_id": "9zNmUMzhFThJOy5Ust1REA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "This is by far the best casual, counter service restaurant on I-10 serving West Houston.  The food is really good, well priced and anyone will enjoy it whether or not you like Greek food.  There is a huge selection and they even have burgers if you arent inclined to try the more traditional Greek stuff.  The falafel gyro is great.  The Greek cheese quesadillas are filled with pesto and make a really good fusion food.  You really can't go wrong.We came back a week later for their Greekfast brunch.  My steak and egg pita sandwhich tasted like it just got served off of an award winning food truck.  This was amazing and the best brunch entre I've had in ages.  Their breakfast coffee is really good, too.I have been to the Montrose location and the food kiosk at Market Square downtown.  This is the best location, in my opinion.The actual facility is really big, bright and comfortable.  Lots of booster seats and a kids playground off the fanned patio seating on the side.  Easy parking.  They have their own painted spots inside the HCC parking lot.  Free samples of gelato... too many good points to list.  We will be back and I am looking forward to trying their frozen adult beverages, too, which are all reasonably priced.  They also serve pitchers and have Hopadillo and Love Street on draft.  Wow.Edit: steer away from the frozen drinks! They are all margarita base with flavored syrup.  Because they have wine and good craft beer, I'll keep it 5 stars."}, {"review_id": "hq-4CJQRZEBxGv3eVYpmBA", "user_id": "dBss0_dJlt-IwVsGH_Iivw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "COSTAS for the Win! The food is amazing, but the service is BETTER! Living a few miles from the restaurant, we have always been Niko Niko fans since living in Montrose. We eat here about once a month. Last night, we ordered 2 gyro sandwiches, a gyro salad and medium soup. Thomas, my brother, was tasked to pick up dinner and instead he picks up Marcus' order. Who's Marcus? We'll never know! Well Marcus ordered 2 gyro sandwiches and a hummus. At 4 months pregnant and very hangry, I get Thomas to fix the situation. We call Niko Niko and the manager offers to save my brother by delivering the gyro salad and soup to our home!! After less than 10 minutes, Costas is at our doorstep with my dinner AND cookies. Wow... I'm a Houston-native, born and raised, and this is by the far - the best service I've ever received from any restaurant.

I tried the falafel gyro and it was amazing!! Their menu is pretty extensive which I like. If you are new to Greek food this is definitely a place to try. I enjoyed my visit. In this area, it's always hard to find parking. Ether their is never enough parking or their narrow spaces. My favorite things about Niko Niko's is that they have a parking lot. The place does get visit but service is pretty quick.

It was acceptable for me since I had plenty of time. Though I only ordered 2 items so hmm...My food - 4.5 stars! Delicious! Loved my pies (got a spanakopita and a tiropita), though the phyllo kept falling apart (I think that's normal)Overall - 3.5 stars! Had a pretty good time here and i think I would like to try other things on their menu too the next time (like their fries,gyros, and souvlaki, for instance). P.S.

I would even say that I like it a lot a lot a lot because of the products and the prices - but the hype is just way too much. There are several better Gyros in Houston alone. Ekko's, and Gyros & Shish spring to mind.Nevertheless, taken on its own merits, this is a good Gyro. And the chicken gyro is also good.The pork is not the best I've had, but at least they are selling authentic Athens Pork Gyros. I appreciate that. Some of their drinks are good too, in particular the Passion Tea. Yum.And I do love that they have the Greek honey balls - Loukamades. However they make them a little bit more like Beignets and a little bit less like the Honey Balls that I'm used to from Toronto - Athens Pastries to be exact.The prices are excellent too. Nice and cheap, just like your mother turned out to be last weekend.I have some bad memories of this place because of some sad times that happened to me, but I'm trying to move past that now.But believe me, this is not some Niko & Dime Greek place. It's actually good."}, {"review_id": "Xmt-Kl0sV4CXkRBNA-LgKA", "user_id": "1L7LDyht-8QYJPkU9okS6w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Price: $9-$16 a plate. It's honestly a great price for the massive amount of food you're given. This is the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2. Food: was sooooooo disappointed with the food. It's was actually the least favorite meal out I've ever had. I ordered the Greek Lasagna (pastichio), and I've honestly had hamburger helper with more flavor and less grease. My fiancé got the gyro and was pleased but not fully satisfied. Atmosphere: setup like a fudruckers, you order at a counter and pick up your food. There's lots of space so I'd say it's a good place for groups but there's nothing alluring about the setup.Location & parking : directly on Montrose Blvd this is easy to spot and even easier to park for."}, {"review_id": "aaYDCs1ChP9XWji_VKoLlg", "user_id": "75xH5BCrCycyFowf5HMsLA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "I had the combo meat gyro plate with greek salad!

Then I came back inside looking around and the scarce restaurant, searching for patrons that ordered before and after me. Didn't really recognize anyone. I picked a table inside just in case the buzzer worked better insider, but I knew this was ridiculous thinking.After about 22 minutes I put my pride aside and walked to the counter. There is no way it takes that long to make a gyro with fries. I asked the guy at the counter if I was forgotten. He looked at the line of the tickets and to-go orders, then signaled for me to wait while he stepped to the preparation line in the back to inquire further. He quickly returned to tell me that my order would be out in just two minutes and he would bring it straight to my table. He asked for my buzzer and said \"don't worry I will bring it straight to you in about 2 minutes\"I retreated to my table, feeling totally forgotten. The gyro was good. Packed so much with meat I was struggling to hold it together. The taste wasn't anything phenomenal, but the bread was hot and fluffy. The fries were wow wow wow double fries and crispy, there were so many piled on my plate I felt legitimately guilty! I'll be back if I'm in the area again, I won't be shy to check back at the counter though."}, {"review_id": "OXaePs8eqRwH4R9iZmTxQQ", "user_id": "0sVvAXBoj2RQGOH1hOSuJQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "My favorite Gyro spot!  We come here often..

My best friend and I head to Niko Niko's (her first visit).  We knew exactly what we wanted Gyros, potatoes and a drink.  While checking out, I noticed the boxed dessert so I grabbed one.  Wanting to send this home with my friend for her family to enjoy.  We found our  our booth not noticing it was right in front of the desserts. We sat for less than 10 mins (enjoying our view) before our buzzer goes off.  It's time to eat and we are ready to enjoy.  First we had to figure out where to put all this food.  Really big portions at a great price. Excellent gyro full of flavorful lamb and beef. Wrapped up with yummy tzatziki sauce, tomatoes, onion. Potatoes are delicious and tender with a hint of lemon. Just a great lunch and we have dessert for home. Day's going great, couldn't get much better.  Until the owner who was sitting behind us ask about our lunch...I think our smiles gave us away. We chatted a bit and he turned to the counter.  Then turns around with gelato and says try this.  Rich and creamy we sampled the whiskey, pistachio and a raspberry. This stuff was addictive making it impossible to pick a favorite.  Then we got to sample of cake that was delicious. Sorry I can't remember the name. Similar to a taramasu but even better. It's a large portion and we split a piece and couldn't finish it.Most definitely eating here again."}, {"review_id": "_7dpslptk5Hq3AC6RPNapQ", "user_id": "lJKH16uI7w7jXKpDaSBkog", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "The gyro is really good, but not crazy about the loukoumades. The gyro meat and the hot buttery pita is a great mix. The loukoumades are thick, chewy bread desserts without any filling. Powdered sugar is just for show on top, but doesn't add much to the dessert. The honey doesn't really stick to the dessert much either.

Sure Niko Niko's menu is vast, but their gyros aren't worth the hype here. I've had way better.I chose the Chicken Gyro (Hand-stacked chicken gyro in a pita bread with onions, tomato, cabbage and a roasted garlic aioli sauce; $8.50) and my husband tried their ever so popular Gyro Sandwich (Mixture of chopped lamb, beef and spices in a pita bread with tomato, onion and Tzatziki sauce; $8.50) upon recommendation from the man taking our order. We also ordered a side of fries ($3.25). Overall we both weren't impressed and thought our gyros were bland. My chicken was a bit dry, but at least the pita bread was fluffy and delicious. The fries were pretty good too, but who comes to Niko Niko's for good pita bread and fries?

One thing I did not care for is that they changed their menu to not include the Greek Salad as a side on the entrees.  Other than that this is a great place to eat.  Plenty of parking.   Word of Warning, if you go for lunch, get there early or get there late... please dont get there hungry at noon. There is plenty of outdoor seating for eating on a beautiful day... Beware of birds!
