It's also located in an old firehouse, which gives it an unexpected unique character.Right away I noticed how many people were coming and going with takeout orders. I figured if they do take out right they must have a decent dine in experience.To my surprise they have a weekend dinner buffet, those are definitely words you usually don't see together. We were in a group, celebrating a birthday and everyone's hungry so this was the obvious choice.That's when things went bad, the buffet definitely had some variety, but this was the epitome of a tired buffet. Presentation sucked, food lacked luster, and even the plates were heavily etched.It was unanimous, no one wanted the buffet, we even considered leaving until we decided to just order from the menu.Surprisingly this is where the experience turned around. The food took some time to prepare, but it came out hot, looked amazing and tasted even better!From the appetizers to the entrees, everything was made just right and tasted fresh and flavorful.Pick this spot for a quick stop off the interstate, avoid the Buffett and order off the menu!"}, {"review_id": "43mUsXoa29_6L-UwZG1T0g", "user_id": "VyoKpE3Rvv36BxQNKofnzw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "This place is a stone throw away from West Virginia Capitol Complex. It is 5 minutes walk from the State Capitol, or 15 minutes ride from the city center. The lunch buffet was only $9.99 Monday through Friday and the selections of food is excellent. Chicken Tikka Masala and Tandoori chicken are my personal favorites. Other choices includes chicken vindaloo and two different types of korma. Deserts are not part of the buffet, however, but It is very affordable!"}, {"review_id": "ZUqIxFQhDMISocd9WvkEUQ", "user_id": "g7s6WUEZP2vHsfQqD0O8uA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "Little India was just average. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either. I was craving some samosa chaat so decided to stop by for dinner. We ordered Saag Paneer and Chicken Makhani. The Chicken Makhani was good but I found the Saag Paneer to be very dry, almost chalky taste. The spinach seemed to be over puréed so it didn't have texture, thus tasting like a paste. The garlic naan was good but lacking in garlic. The waitress was nice and brought our food in a timely manner."}, {"review_id": "wHI_PMihaVfsmESEXDkvLA", "user_id": "dDZgMQReXfxSoVSDtsKpeg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Not sure how they're doing now as I haven't gone back in over a year since I went with my husband and daughter. My toddler daughter and I took a bathroom break before we were leaving and found two cockroach's in the bathroom ... turned my stomach I hadn't gone back since and refuse to either.. kinda sucks though because their food was good up until I saw how dirty that place really is... (probably really good because of the added cockroach protein)"}, {"review_id": "vpNiyvFNLCR7mYHU1fdnGg", "user_id": "sX5DosUR2ggDttlwjvoMow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "I am always pleased with Little India.

Had Garlic Naan and Chicken Tikka Masala, everything was very good. I've had this dish many times at various places, we even fix it at home, this was some of the best Tikka Masala I've had.

The overly spicy stereotype is halted with plenty of dishes' having an option of mild, medium, medium+, or spicy (easy to hot), so don't fear the heat here too much. But! If you're a heat-seeker, then this is definitely a great option. Very distinct tastes here. Lamb should be on many other restaurants' menus, not just Indian places. A place to recommend to anyone to at least try once to see if they like it. People are far too set in their ways in this country with burgers, burritos and steak(houses). Eat something else for once. Like this place."}, {"review_id": "RR8TIEr8npqX5oYkFAX11Q", "user_id": "dAZkJpfE2ksKwKL02KhdTw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/24/2017", "text": "Quality of food went down in the recent years .

Did the trick but wouldn't be quick to come back again. Have a wide variety of options- but would recommend going with the vegetable options or the chicken curry. Staff was very nice and welcoming. There is a patio to sit at but the street is not the most happening with lots of shops closed down. Interior is very dark so we chose the outside seating. All together if you are looking for an Indian food place this is nice- 12.99$ for the buffet and a clean establishment"}, {"review_id": "Lz-a2k1hlyV_jazDgQ-5iQ", "user_id": "lv4j43Sff4_zxzX63-mXqg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "New owners since my last review, and the food just keeps getting better.  I think the new owners are from a different region than the previous ones, because there are some different flavors in my favorite dishes, but it's still just amazing.  This is probably my favorite restaurant in Charleston, because I really, really love Indian food, but I feel like their game just keeps improving all the time."}, {"review_id": "lMmDugByLuQglqqeVIVIzw", "user_id": "MALH8IHMOdg9V4ZQELVdjQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/21/2017", "text": "I have to be honest. I was enjoying my lunch buffet to a small degree until a friend pointed out  the rat \"droppings\" along the windows and under one of the tables. The food was above average, but I was actually a bit surprised at how limited it was. The tikka masala and saffron rice was decent. They didn't have any Naan bread and I was somewhat disappointed about that. Our service was commendable and I really can't say anything bad about it. Overall, I think it has promise but the vermin issue is something that needs fixed. Too gross! Hopefully they solve this issue because it's in a good location and the people that work there seem nice."}, {"review_id": "Im6v34JsdxztP96TcnOPzA", "user_id": "0pMD2WbpUO1ckuThwlaNPA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/2/2016", "text": "Upon driving up to the restaurant you can smell the spices from a mile away.

I recommend eating off the vegetarian menu. Not every meal needs to have meat, and their best dishes are off that menu.Added star for reasonable price range ($12-$20, normal for a dine in restaurant)"}, {"review_id": "3NQKxpfzzQVDhEX5jxTObQ", "user_id": "UJMJQoAGnQnG98jW4i8IEw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/5/2016", "text": "Service was great.
