This place is amazing. As their name would suggest, they really know how to do salads here. The salads are thoughtfully composed, properly dressed (neither too much nor too little), the flavors surprising, and the ingredients creative. One of my salads was studded with glistening pomegranate seeds, and another, pine nuts. These were not just thrown in for show to for faux foodie reasons; each truly was the right addition for its particular salad. Healthy yes, but the flavors are so delicious.The three salads I tried were in order a seasonal I Yam what I Yam, the Salacho, which I would imagine is a crowd favorite, and the Omega. I highly recommend these salads. The salads can be ordered plain or with a protein add on, or if they come with a protein that doesn't appeal, it can be swapped out for something else. On my \"Yam\" salad, I had tofu instead of the suggested pork, and on the Salacho, chicken instead of the chorizo. Omega I ate as it came, without a protein, and it was glorious.Let me say a word about the beverages. Of course there's a nice wine and beer selection, which one expects at a high-ish end hipster place like this. What's surprising though is a drink list of fun, colorful, celebratory beverages for those on the wagon or who have to go back to work. Shrubs, tonics, and juice cocktails occupy a page on the drink menu and will not disappoint. I tried two different ones, a carrot turmeric tonic on one visit, and a cucumber lime refresher on another, and loved them both. On future visits, I will try other offerings from this drink menu.Although I love where I live, I'm piqued that it's four hours from the nearest Vinaigrette. Guess I'll be hitting the 505 more often."}, {"review_id": "6J3o73ZohsjA5EIsjQRQLw", "user_id": "euyJ-xUAUPiAcAru_Jq-dQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "We make it a point to eat here multiple times a year. The food is always fantastic; made from fresh ingredients with a high level of care and attention to detail. Even if we didn't love what we chose, we've always agreed that the food was fantastic but just not to our personal tastes.Salads, soups, sandwiches, dessert, you name if we've had it and we've loved it.I would specifically recommend the mushroom soup (when they have it), cuban sandwich, spinach salad, omega salad, the beet goes on, the flourless chocolate torte, the lemon cheesecake (very zetsy), and carrot cake.Servers are always friendly and helpful, and food is always delicious. Biggest complaint would be the seating, I'm a larger person so the metal chair sides can dig into my hips painfully at times. Otherwise, it's always been a good experience!"}, {"review_id": "__BD4nk-2KY2ShqZXmDBHw", "user_id": "4h62TuMvK_VwzHGHfn2ONQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "This restaurant offers fresh and healthy food, focusing on vegetables. I had The Omega salad and Roasted Veggie and Provolone sandwich. Both items were delicious! The salad had the perfect amount of toppings (often I find places just sprinkle minimal toppings on). The sandwich was cheesy, filled with perfectly roasted vegetables, and served on buttered and griddled sourdough. I did the half salad half sandwich deal, which was just over $10. This is the best deal and just the right amount of food for lunch. If you're going to order one full-size items, the prices are a bit higher and if you want additions to a salad (like meat), the prices gets to be around $20. This is too steep, IMO, and is why I took away a star. The place has a fresh, young feel. Drinks are served in mason glasses and there are live plants all around. There is a parking lot in the back. I went at 2pm and the place was still packed, so I can only imagine how full it gets at lunchtime!"}, {"review_id": "loW4VeWxAYMrwZLut2mOLw", "user_id": "IR-1EYq4Ga7zUD2mVSLkFA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "A hidden gem in this (dump) area! Zoey, our waitress was amazing she made us feel at home. She made excellent recommendations and made sure our glasses were never half empty. She came around often and made sure we were satisfied. The food is so fresh and tasty. The confit duck frisée salad with a poached egg and bacon lardons was so fresh and delicious the flavors all came together so perfectly. The asparagus wrapped in procuito was grilled to perfection. The cucumber and lemonade was so good. OMG and duck tacos were delicious and Very light I love that they sliced jicama very thin and used that as a substitute for tortillas. I'm so glad I found a good place to eat when I travel through New Mexico."}, {"review_id": "LESitifYd2I54ugq3hGQ6w", "user_id": "7xfVw4OIxxiPS7fTdp4-Zw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "About 15-25 per person.

Came in on a dinner date at 5:00 and was impressed by the variety on the menu. I ordered the mushroom soup and The Beet Goes On salad both of which were fantastic! The soup was savory and packed full of mushrooms and carrots with a rich broth that I would absolutely recommend for a sick day. The salad was a very large portion with lots of beets that perfectly complimented the goat cheese and pistachios. I would absolutely order both of these items again and will be back soon in the future!!"}, {"review_id": "gpvJdDoRQpqw_ImFf6qO9A", "user_id": "og6DDC6bx3v4Us9sCvDuQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/7/2017", "text": "I really like this place. I'm not usually a leaf eater. I'm more the type that would rather down a pound of meat and top it off with some creamed corn and call it healthy day. I was quite shocked with how good eating healthy can actually be. This place is nice. Like romantic nice but not I've got to dress up like a snotty sleeze bag and put my nose in the air nice. This is more like a \"I want to have a good dinner but not get dressed up\" nice. The restaurant is intimately lit and has some cool, hipster music playing. There is a lot of seating and it looks like they open a patio area when it's warmer. The menu has a lot of salad entrees but the cool thing (for t-Rexes like myself) is that you can add meat to any of the salads. They also serve sandwiches and soups. When the food arrived, I was shocked at how large the entrees were. You can eat one of these babies and actually stay full. They also offer some pretty unique non-alcoholic drinks and they also serve wine and a limited selection of beer. Loved it and I'm not really even a fan of salad. Go check it out. I highly recommend it.

I know - the terms \"filling\" and \"salad\" seem oxymoronic together, but it's really true here. The first time I visited Vinaigrette for dinner, I had the mindset that I would be hungry for a burger or something afterwards, but boy, was I wrong. The portion sizes caught me off guard, and all of the salad options came with rich, nutrient-dense, ingredients...not to mention, the protein pairings were impeccable. For an average of $7 extra, you could pair your delicious salad bedding with options as wild as duck confit or seared scallops! And, upon request, they do offer complimentary herb bread with olive oil, which, when baked fresh, is delightful.I typically opt for the sandwich combination, because those are as heavenly as the salads, and they even come with a small side salad. On my latest visit, I tried the Roasted Veggie & Provolone sandwich, and I was not disappointed. The sweet and slightly charred roasted bell peppers, onions, and squash complemented the warm, gooey provolone cheese very well. My side salad of choice was the Omega, because I absolutely love the mixture of avocado, corn, and tomato... so refreshing! And it gets even better - they also offer lunch specials, including a half sandwich & small side salad for around $10.I love the overall hip vibe of the restaurant, especially when my water is served in a cute, country-style mason jar, and the receipt comes in a tiny, crafty metal bucket. I'd come here more often if not for the location, since it's by Old Town...it's quite the trek from the NE Heights."}, {"review_id": "VB2LPccpdVisqH4TxI_BOQ", "user_id": "40XzsVI4NL92TzhPFYfLXw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Very good salads I got the pepita - it was great and the turmeric mimosa.

They lost a star for service.  I generally eat there alone and I often feel like I'm just sitting there forever waiting for the server to check on me.  Also, bread, why is it a secret I have to ask for?  Please just offer me bread.... or put it on the menu and charge me for it.  I'm eating a salad, but a girl needs some carbs to make it stick!"}, {"review_id": "YdgK0mRmqniUtHqOrDn2ow", "user_id": "ZrE5leVkFIUkBvhCqlGVzA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/11/2017", "text": "3.5 stars (yelp doesn't let me give 3.5, but the food was just okay so I rounded down). 4 stars for decor, 3 stars for food.

I do appreciate the farm-to-table concept and how they grow many of their own vegetables.  We ordered:Chicken noodle soup: decent flavor, nothing specialThe beet goes on: the beets were delicious, would have liked a larger portion of greens (was not enough to be a salad)Sautéed Kale: a little soggyDuck tacos: the best thing we tried but the portion size was tinyOverall, if you're looking for a clean healthier farm-to-table restaurant option, close to old town, this is worth a try.
