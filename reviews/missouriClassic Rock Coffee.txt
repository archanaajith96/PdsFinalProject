After much debate I tried the honey cinnamon coffee in a medium size and was not disappointed. The flavor was amazing and I can't stop thinking about it! I also had a muffin that was moist and delicious and perfectly seasoned. The atmosphere is super cool and I would totally go back at my next opportunity!"}, {"review_id": "5QHsitxQkyqD9pBcuRYEOQ", "user_id": "-50lprJ4kZ-XCM1hPU2vqg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/24/2017", "text": "Interesting place.

Thank goodness we did! It's tucked into a shopping center behind a gas station. All the drinks are classic rock themed. They have drip coffee as well as hot and cold espresso drinks. **Highly** recommend the Dirty White Boy! There was a cold reach in at checkout with typical fresh snacks. What you would see at Starbucks or something...We were greeted right upon entering. Very friendly. We are planning to make it a stop for all our future road trips!"}, {"review_id": "RVlr74HCFl8MXwtV0jD64w", "user_id": "37tHSx-x4_jjLbZJj1KEAw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/18/2017", "text": "Awesome atmosphere, friendly staff.

Springfield - you're full of surprises. *****I. FOOD & DRINKThey have your traditional coffees and teas, an interesting array of mixed drinks, and several different kinds of baked noms to buy. I was tempted to try their Dirty White Boy (white chocolate and cocoa), simply because of the name, but I conservatively ordered their cappuccino, latte, and an espresso. All were pretty solid. Needless to say, the amount of caffeine I had in my body would possibly kill a newborn child. And it was awesome.I did try their Oreo brownie, and I thought it tasted really dry and flavorless. So, there's some room for improvement there. II. SERVICEThere were two very sweet women behind the counter that didn't give me any eye rolls. They also brought out my caffeine elixirs pretty quickly. What I find interesting is that they use those circular buzzers that a Buffalo Wild Wings would use, which, I guess, totally fits the ambience of the joint.III. AMBIENCE/ DÉCORI hope you like CCR, Zeppelin, and the like. (I know I do.) The establishment is pretty huge, with three rooms for patrons and their operations in the back. (There shouldn't be any problems finding a seat.) Oh, and they have Classic Rock memorabilia for days hung about on the walls.IV. PRICESFair. Most of the classic drinks, from what I remember, fell under $5. Your wallet shouldn't take too much damage, for anything there.V. OVERALLIt's a pretty awesome, unique café that also serves as a rock venue and coffee shop. (Boxes - throw them out the window!) If they could fix their crawling, unreliable wifi (that occasionally disconnects every ten to fifteen minutes), then I could see myself camping out there for more than three or so hours. Rock on, Classic Rock Coffee. Rock. On."}, {"review_id": "b-klUKYYutw64XG9KfhXhg", "user_id": "MdmH3-BrzY05Y3okTe6V_g", "rating": 1.0, "date": "8/27/2017", "text": "Without a doubt the worst iced latte I've ever had.

I could see being a regular if we lived in the area, as the cold brew and lattes were awesome. We also had a kids grilled cheese,  Abel, pastry and breakfast sandwich. All were well priced and tasty.

He was very humble and wanted all of our issues corrected immediately. Fantastic customer service, especially for an owner you don't get that now a days. I was also informed there are two other sets of restrooms. Strictly because of their care of customer service \"and coffees\" I will be back, and can truly recommend that if you have any issues to call HQ. 5 stars for customer service, and coffee alone! But the atmosphere ranks high as well."}, {"review_id": "1LmopSK4_-APjRvZSztxrw", "user_id": "nr35WjC-YI0dFcsnW33Szw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/26/2016", "text": "This is not a place you come and do work. There is limited seating. But - there is good coffee, lots of loud music, and interesting pasties.

My wife had the blended cinnamon girl and a blueberry muffin, and I had the mocha choca latte hot and a cinnamon roll. With the tip, our bill was only 22.00, so they are fair priced. We enjoyed our drinks and our pastries very much, and I can guarantee they just earned some repeat business.  The staff was friendly and helpful, they even offered my wife a free Chai latte that they incorrectly made hot instead of iced, which she loved. Love the music and deco, and love the comfy leather sofas we sat on. Looking forward to coming back again. I definitely recommend this place. We'll worth it."}, {"review_id": "ebPOZaYUvxMWUu_o0fNxPg", "user_id": "OoQPhdsAEuQRh3BAvgLjgQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/18/2016", "text": "The Raspberry Beret is amazing! It's a nice place to spend time at. I went there on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't very crowded, nice to sit and work/read(probably only because it was a Sunday afternoon).

It's a nice place to hang on a date if you're not wanting to go drink alcohol every time you go out, although they do have alcohol in the band area. Not impressed with the bands they have had when we've been there. Wish it was more diverse and not mainly blues or classic rock (haha..). This is a frequent spot for me and hubby and we bring friends occasionally. I have had their food also which was good."}, {"review_id": "7063Nl4Tlcte6_IYMOfM3A", "user_id": "25wkEXVHryBTUWeEmS2vXA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2016", "text": "If your soul rocks washed out denim jeans, fluffy bangs, and leg warmers/chuck taylors, this is the place for you. This coffee shop rocks harder than a supergroup made up of Freddie Mercury, Randy Rhoads, Neil Peart, and John Entwistle. (Okay maybe not that hard, but seriously this place is awesome) The ambiance is superb, it consists of, stage lighting, product tables, band memorabilia, drum setesque end tables, metal designs, and a hardcore staff to go along with it.This is my go to coffee shop in town. Not only because they have great coffee but because they support my favorite local rock station US 97.3 as well!I like the Americana and the Great White Buffalo (a vanilla latte based off of the famous Ted Nugent song) It's like a free for all in my mouth (whatever that means?) in other words it's great, awesome, and cool! Also they have great coffee shop foods available!Plenty of parking out front and around the side. This is a great place to come for small group meetings or study sessions. While they do embrace the classic rock life style they also respect the classic coffee shop vibe, meaning you can still focus with the level of ambiance here for sure.Check this place out!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/classic-rock-coffee-springfield?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
