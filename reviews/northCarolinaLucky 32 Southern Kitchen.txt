I was back at lunch today and after the check was paid and the waitperson disappeared another gentleman came by about 5 minutes later and offered to refill our drinks. I was very surprised and extremely pleased to experience great service. Thanks!"}, {"review_id": "8zOSyuWhA-e7G0HKksXwbw", "user_id": "8Kjf1ulh1ox5RiO42UI4IQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Nice place, super service, just a mixed feeling about the food -- especially comparing it to the nearby Print Works Bistro and Green Valley Grill. I had the House-Smoked Carolina BBQ Brisket -- Black Angus beef; two sides and mine were the Fried Grit Cake and a Mixed Green Salad. The brisket was good but not something I would go back for and for the grit cake I had to try it since it was in a form different then the usual southern grits. The result on the grits, was, well, it is still grits.Lots of parking and a nice outdoor space that I am sure would be a hit in warmer weather. Maybe it is just me but the name seems weird for a southern kitchen (I think Chinese). I was hoping there was some story behind it on the menu but unless I missed it I could not find it anywhere."}, {"review_id": "3GvfKLiS0aHbkKBBcUuVeA", "user_id": "gE0MpJGSlDT6FYR1_QgBJg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "This review is a little mixed.  We have been to Lucky 32 several times over the past 2 years.  Always for dinner, have never eaten there for brunch.  Definitely enjoy the rotating seasonal menu.  Made a reservation for 6:15, arrived a little early and had a drink at the bar.  Nice beer selection, pretty good bourbon selection too.  Have had good dining experiences before, but have fallen off in the last year.Sat down to dinner.  I ordered off the seasonal menu (pork shank over red beans) two other diners ordered off standard menu (Suffolk chicken & salmon).  Waitress took order and left.  Didn't check on us from the time order was placed to the time we were almost finished eating.  It was fine because we still had drinks from the bar. Food arrived and looked very nice.  Wait time was okay for a Saturday night.  I don't know about the other diners, but my dish was cold.  Couldn't tell if it sat at the pass for a while or was cold to begin with.  Red beans were underseasoned and undercooked.  Didn't have a chance to flag the waitress down because she was preoccupied with a seating of 8 and didn't check on us.  Other diner has a sensitivity to dairy and ordered a Texas Pete glaze on the salmon, but it came with butter instead.  All in all, the meals were fine, but cold dishes and incorrect order will probably put us off going back for a while.  At the price point ($69 for 3 dishes that did have flaws, no appetizers/salads), I think there are more options in the area."}, {"review_id": "VGdYc2YwcwXiK6DWgFjVBw", "user_id": "rE66nTqglcbqoUGu1kRC4A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "The service and ambiance of the restaurant is delightful! I haven't been to this Lucky 32 location before but have been to the one located in Winston-Salem over 12 years ago. The lunch menu was vast and they had many seasonal dishes which I decided to partake in. I got the Trillium baked Salmon with collard greens and sweet potatoes. It was delicious. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is there were 2-3 ants on the table. I think they were coming from the flowers but I'm not 100% sure.

The restaurant is elegant with that feel of old money like the Great Gatsby. The staff was courteous and friendly, so why three and half star? After looking over the brunch menu and hoping for an amazing dish that stood out, which didn't happen . I opted for a classic southern cuisine Shrimp and Grits. What a let down it was kinda cold to slightly lukewarm, out of respect for the other guest, I kept drinking my Bellini, never said a word. The flavors were average nothing real stood out in my dish as a winner. My girlfriend dish was the opposite. Her salmon was cooked perfectly and the taste was spot on. I should have ordered it instead, but I'm only judging my dish. That why I'm disappointed, but I do believe in second chances. I'm sure we will be back."}, {"review_id": "sd-G8CvirFvu1gO8Hzin9w", "user_id": "j1-2jDeSpyn20bFI-LcYmQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/14/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Lucky 32 Southern Kitchen prepares Southern staples including two of my favorites, Shrimp & Grits and Jambalaya.   Their sides are Southern comfort food; collards, Mac'n cheese, blacked eyed peas, etc.   The regular menu also features salads, burgers, and sandwiches offering something to appease just about any appetite.      Lucky 32 rotates part of their menu seasonally which keeps it fresh and interesting.  They source locally as much as possible.Dining here is a pleasurable experience with a nice lively ambiance and good service.  Orders come out of the kitchen pretty fast making L32 a good lunch choice.   I enjoy their patio in good weather.  Check out their bar which features live music some evenings.     This is a great choice for gathering with friends."}, {"review_id": "OL1nLXSOSs6EdB0CVyjs_A", "user_id": "VR53g6BoJjfj61oDeimnQA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Ambience was beautiful.

During my initial visit I gave it 3 stars because the dinner items did not impresses.The breakfast/ brunch however was great! I ordered the brisket with creamy grits and biscuits. The meat quality was great, has a smokiness to it. The creamy grits were pretty good, the biscuits were great. The cornbread was amazing and out of this world. I decided that I wanted an omelette too. The omelette was great! Not much to complain about a omelette.

Great ambiance and good service. We tried the fried green tomato appetizer, which was very good. The artichoke dip was also good (although nothing to write home about). Two of us got the jambalaya and the other two got the southern grilled chicken sandwich. The portions are quite big. Jambalaya was good, although it wasn't what we expected as it came out dry and most other jambalayas that we've had at other places have a stew/soup consistency to it. This one was more on the paella and dry side. The chicken sandwich was very good as well. This was our second visit to Lucky 32 and I would probably return again in the future."}, {"review_id": "QRE1hWFEZKlIUDFJcDXDLg", "user_id": "46HGVOzMgWmQpxfGmQM1jw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Lucky 32 has been a staple invthe GSO restaurant scene for years.

I have dined here so many times throughout the years and it is always hit or miss. This review is about my last dining experience with my colleagues to celebrate Christmas. Per usual, the service from the hostess is amazing. They seat you quickly and always with a smile. We had a large party so our waitress was polite in waiting for everyone to arrive and to look over the menu. I chose this evening the Herb Grilled Chicken Breast with mashed potatoes and green beans. The chicken, unfortunately, needed to be cooked more. It looked appetizing with the garnish but it was too pink to eat in the middle. The mashed potatoes did not disappoint. They were creamy, just thick enough, and seasoned well. The green beans were also not cooked well. They appeared to taste heated only. I sent these back. When they returned, they were no better. It was at this point that I knew I was not sending back my chicken. I was supposed to take it home to recook, but I left it on the table when I left. Oh well. Anyways, what was delicious and I devoured every bite was the brownie sundae. It was a great size, covered in fudge, and the brownie was super moist. I could see myself ordering this again, for sure."}, {"review_id": "wmVvh5oYsuL1R2kje5dFrQ", "user_id": "6nc9fw6KNqNGMkJobY0B4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2017", "text": "So glad that the last meal of my trip to Greensboro ended with Lucky 32. It was by far the best meal I had out of the whole week. Lucky 32 is a casual restaurant with classy interiors; brightly lit with high ceilings and very spacious. The service here is impeccable. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, and was able to give us recommendations based on popularity of dishes and her personal favorites. I started off with the cocktail Ginger Cup. This was very delicious even though it was not very strong, the taste was very gingery so I liked it. For my entrée I chose a seasonal dish that the waitress had recommended, the Basin Street Chicken. The chicken was AMAZINGLY juicy even though it was the breast. The Cajun spices added a kick to the tomato sauce and it was very good. I had a choice of two sides so I picked the Pimento Mac and the Daily Veggies which were root vegetables cooked in duck fat. How delicious does that sound?! The sides were really good as well, especially the pimento cheese. The prices at Lucky 32 may be on the higher side, but it is absolutely worth it for the quality of the food. I saw that many other reviews noted that this is not a place to go if you are hungry. I disagree and I thought that the portion was quite big since I could barely finish my entire order. I will be back for sure."}, {"review_id": "Cb7Iu8kuGSZkO_tpwcHELw", "user_id": "cO2tbwXi--SEcQnntN8osQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "My wife and I were a party of two seated immediately on a Thursday evening. The decor was upscale and very pleasant.  The restaurant was full but not noisy. My main course was chicken, shrimp, and andouille sausage jambalaya. It had just the right amount of spice and was served steaming hot. My side was a fried grits cake served with a ham cream sauce. Both the main course and side were outstanding. My wife had a very pleasing chicken sandwich with smoked bacon and fried onion strings on a brioche bun along with a side salad. For dessert we shared an excellent almond cake topped with a cream cheese frosting served with ice cream filled with chocolate bits and dried cherries. The service staff was very friendly and attentive. I generally post reviews only for outstanding restaurants which are often hard to find.

Our guests didn't rave about their food either, which was a disappointment because we were celebrating a family event. The modern decor is attractive, and their front door is great for pictures.
