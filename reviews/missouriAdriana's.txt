This little sandwich shop is magnificent- great bread, great meat, great pasta salad and great cookies! My husband and I went here during the lunch rush on a Friday. While there was a bit of a wait, the ladies kept everyone moving. We snacked on a delicious lemon cookie while we waited...dessert first means you will have room for it! We each managed to eat half of our substantial sandwiches and some of the best pasta salad I've ever had (spinach feta pasta salad)! The bread they use for their sandwich was soft & flavorful...perfect for the Hill Boy sandwich that I had! The sauce on my husband's salsiccia was also delicious with the sausage sandwich!The ladies working at Adriana's are friendly and make great food!! I highly recommend that you visit Adriana's if you get the chance!"}, {"review_id": "Gn7BJXNLWsz2LMeR49gEbw", "user_id": "HD8bKUFrRsO20ntKRssLzg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "i had the Italian Salsiccia sandwich w/ Spinach & Feta Pasta salad as a side. great sausage & sauce.

Whenever I have mentioned Adriana's to others, they always say, like Rocky's girlfriend? No, you need to add an additional, A and pronounce it correctly. Oh well, that's another story. Any way, Adriana's is an old school deli and what modern day deli chains should strive to be. The bread here is soft and fresh. I pretty sure, there are little old Italian grandmothers in back making it daily. My go to is usually the Half & Half lunch special. I get half of a sandwich and a side. My go to is the house salad with house dressing. Franco is a favorite choice for my sandwich. It has; hot turkey, Onion, Roasted Red Pepper and Cheese. Eating this, excluding the bread, I feel as if I'm eating somewhat healthy. The salad is always a winner for me. It's never overdressed as you normally get at other Italian establishments. As stated by others, you order at the counter and then listen for your number to be shouted out. No runners here to bring you your order. The staff is too busy, hustling with making your order and busing tables after others have left. To my understanding, the character who on occasion is taking orders at the cash register is Adriana herself. She's a delight, a true Italian Grandmother. Rest of the staff is friendly and are here to provide you with quick service. The decor is bright yellow and blue. Tables are covered in plastic blue gingham tablecloths. It is tacky as hell, but charming as hell at the same time. It's makes the ambiance of this neighborhood deli,  just perfect.

I would say about 70 percent of the menu is sandwiches with around 24 different combinations.Where do I even begin?... Recommended to me was the Mary's Special sandwich (hot roast beef on garlic cheese bread topped with pickles, onions, and provel cheese) and a side order of penne pasta. The penne pasta alone was okay, but the sauce layered on top was the highlight. Heavy in herbs and seasoning, the sauce was rich and could be easily used for everything (i.e. pizza, spaghetti, dipping sauces, etc.). The Mary's Special sandwich was a hit as well. This might sound weird, but I loved how the inside layer of the garlic bread was a little soggy from the roast beef juices. I know what you're thinking! It sounds weird, but it went well with the crispy pickles and onions inside.Out of the whole meal, the item that was having my friend contemplate flying back to Italy was the limoncello cookie. First of all, Limoncello is a liquor and the second most popular liquor in Italy. The taste of this alcohol can be best described as a bottle of melted lemonheads, but without the sourness. Now imagine that taste in cookie form, and you'll understand why my friend was on Travelocity searching for plane tickets. Moral of the story, order the Limoncello cookie.There are not too many places around that serve quality food along with reasonable prices. I will surely be coming back to this restaurant soon."}, {"review_id": "u7B2R_4URXMP8_dqpCG0lg", "user_id": "n0KCbRByRd9rEY9Bl3LH9w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Great surprise - wonderful food - I had the Hill Boy - perfect sandwich should have gotten 2 of them.  Staff was so friendly and eager to explain what to get.  I'll be back as often as I can!"}, {"review_id": "IJ27ALMVrpLbNcqIIkl0eg", "user_id": "8RjjyOXGhDh5vZdjGs_7Hg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "Adrianas is probably my favorite sandwich shop in St. Louis.

Awesome people serving awesome food. This is a family favorite. No one cares there is always a line. Menu has something for all:  vegetarian daughter - check Charlie's veg and house, youngest penne with meatball no parm no parsley, etc. I have run thru 90% of the sandwiches over 10 yrs and they don't disappoint.  All great. My only recommendation is if you choose a combo go for the Adriana's salad - the salami (Volpi I suspect) is a huge addition over the house salad. One other suggestion: the wait for food goes so much quicker if u let your kids eat the gooey butter cake u get when u order.

The place is packed which makes me think they weren't on the ball with my sandwich. My better half ordered the Italian beef with potato salad and I ordered the Charlie's special. The potato salad was pretty good as was his sandwich. Mine however, was a different story. The Charlie's special is mozzarella and provolone cheeses on GARLIC bread with black olives, tomato, two small pieces of onion and lettuce.  I was so looking forward to this. After taking a bite, I had to open my sandwich to make sure there was some cheese on it.  Yep, one piece of mozzarella and I think there was one piece of provolone on it.  If it was on garlic bread, you could have fooled me. No garlic flavoring whatsoever.  I was so disappointed.
