I came in on a Saturday morning with really high expectations after hearing about Founding Farmers from so many people here in DC. The concept of being owned by farmers, who provide farm-to-table really drew me in. However, I left quite disappointed.First, the wait. I had a reservation (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) and I was seated on time. The host at the front was even kind enough to offer me an immediate seat at the communal table if I wanted, since I had arrived 15 minutes earlier. A+ here for service and prompt seating. Do note that if you want to dine here on weekends, make an appointment at least 3 days in advance! They had lines out the door and many people had waited in excess of 2 hours.Second, the food. This is where Founding Farmers really stagnated. We ordered a Cornbread for our table, which is about the only thing we enjoyed. I ordered Chicken and Waffles, which consisted of half part dry chicken tenders and half part flavorless waffles. The batter they used for the waffle had absolutely NO FLAVOR. We also ordered the Free Range Eggs with the Maple Cured Ham. This was mediocre at best, since by the time it had got to us, it was COLD.Lastly, the service. Now, I understand that Founding Farmers is an INCREDIBLY BUSY and HIGH VOLUME restaurant. However, that does not mean it should take over 15 minutes to get me my syrup and hot sauce. I asked for this as soon as my food was brought out, but received when I was about done with my meal. I am not, by any standards, a fast eater.I recommend coming to Founding Farmers doing off-peak times. I think this will allow you to have much better service and an improved quality of food."}, {"review_id": "nm3TW5zSQeuJ_FHZ6-PuJg", "user_id": "wBXHmV7adXpHOoCOCtE6ig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Great experience from start to finish.Pros:+ Fried green tomatoes appetizer was crispy and came with delicious sauces - green goddess and goat cheese spread+ The meatloaf was excellent with a very good crust and delicious gravy.  Buttery green beans with pickled lemon were delicious.  Meatloaf could have used maybe 5% less salt.+ Carrot cake is excellent with a fresh cream cheese frosting and just the right balance of spice and dried fruits.+ Service was friendly and attentive.Neutral:- Potato salad was OK, fresh but texture was a little unusual.Cons:- The Impossible Burger had great texture, but the taste had a hidden feature I wasn't sure about.  Would probably skip this one next time.- Scratch ginger soda tasted more like lime than ginger."}, {"review_id": "B5CXVRcNPJn0UJKHfk3WCw", "user_id": "DkiwbmwJuqz2nj3NVA1QYA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "I think all of the other reviews speak to how good this place is. I came here while on a short trip to DC. It is located on a main road so I suggest walking or taking public transportation. Upon entering, it was packed and we were told there would be a 40 minute wait. We were totally okay with this because we had to try it based on all the reviews.The wait ended up being only 20 minutes.  We were seated in the upstairs area right next to the Windows. Our waiter was extremely friendly the whole time. I ordered the chicken and waffles with fries and chips. I didn't really know what to expect since I've never been to a farm to table restaurant. I'm not a huge fried chicken fan but this fried chicken tasted amazing. By far the best I've had. The waffle itself was also very good. It had a unique taste. The fries and chips were just as good. You pay a little more than a typical restaurant but it is definitely worth it for the quality of food. This place should definitely be a must try for anyone visiting DC."}, {"review_id": "FQm9dkB9_Ap04JOVGc8CSw", "user_id": "z8cjS7xanAgiNtazgC56oA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "This is one of my favorite brunch spots in DC, and the food never disappoints.  If you want to go to brunch here, I strongly recommend making reservations a few days in advance, or coming really early (like right after opening) so you can be seated without too long of a wait. I had an early brunch here this past Sunday, and although we tried to arrive early, we still had to wait a few minutes to be seated at the bar. The wait for tables was much longer. Also, by the time we were wrapping up at brunch (around 11am), the wait to be seated at the bar was also more than 20 minutes. Once seated, I ordered my usual which is chocolate chip pancakes and scrambled egg with cheese and a side of bacon. It was a bit cool out so I ordered a mocha which was delicious, and something I will be ordering again. The food came out fairly quickly and everything was good as usual. I also really like that the menu isn't too extensive so it doesn't seem overwhelming. Although we were seated at the bar, the service from both bartenders was great! Nice way to start of my Sunday morning."}, {"review_id": "IJAOhZw7lmjbOiY9oB495A", "user_id": "hFB1VZ_C6K-geZMmPM5IEg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Worth the wait and price! I HIGHLY recommend making a reservation if you want to avoid an hour or longer wait. Homemade pastas, cornbread and iced tea. Get any and all of these. Service is great and kind. Cornbread: baked in a skillet with actual corn inside.Pasta: Lobster Mac & Cheese, Mushroom Risotto, Shrimp & Sundried Tomato Bucatini. The portions are huge and the pastas are perfectly al dente. It's seasoned extremely well, with a ton of herbs. The mushrooms were huge and tasted a bit different, but still good. Food tasted fresh and it wasn't super oily. One of the best pastas I've had! On the expensive side, but worth the treat."}, {"review_id": "aHH0OXRy4U7rqeqfWlGALA", "user_id": "rjWAylKG5sOfCw0k9eGLVQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Though compelled by the same industrial modern feel that has dominated in the city, Founding Farmers has made a consorted effort to remind you of their farm to table philosophy. Nothing supports that more than their respect for their ingredients and their dedication to making the components of the meal from scratch. The meal: in-house ginger soda, grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup and fries, cheeseburger with all the accrutemon and sauteed green beans. The ginger soda is very refreshing and delicately sweetened. I love the look of the cubes of ice in the glass as well. Not too carbonated, if you shy away from carbonation. I would recommend giving it a couple swirls with the paper straw to cool it a bit more before sipping. I'm a slow drinker but the paperstraw held and no sea tortoises were impaled for my drinking preferences. The grilled cheese was perfectly crunchy and offered even more texture with bits of grain in the nooks and crannies. The cheese blend was perfectly melted and tasty, though the bread to cheese ratio was a bit too wide. The soup was very fresh and tangy but not too acidic, complementing the buttery comfort of the grilled cheese very well. The fries were slightly crunchy and well seasoned. If you like crunchy exteriors and velvet interiors in your fries, I'd skip this side dish. The cheeseburger was still juicy despite having to request it medium well done. The lettuce was fresh, the pickles were thinly cut and tasty, the red onion crispy... The only flop was the beef tomatoes which were plain. If you're a gardener like me and you've had a variety of tomatoes you know these can be notoriously bland. Takes a special kind of farmer to bring out their subtle sweetness. I was disappointed with this tomato's showing. The green beans still had a bite and a comforting sweetness to them, enveloped by butter and perfect seasoning.  They were still warm, to boot!All in all, the meal was pleasant. I did find that the first fork I was going to use still had some food residue on it from the dish washer but I commandeered the extra bundle at my table and those utensils were all spotless. I recommend this place for wholesome ingredients in an above casual but below fine dining setting."}, {"review_id": "nHfD6swWmlW-WiKZe0vF-Q", "user_id": "jgtaIl_EKbh6pizgUvGW1w", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "OK I don't know what the hype is about here. I get the idea of farmer owned and sourced, but we were disappointed. We came in on a weekday morning for breakfast. We did not need a reservation and were seated immediately. The French press coffee we ordered was ground too fine, so it was sludgy at the bottom. Sausage in my husbands breakfast was dry. Everything was oily on the plate. Eggs and bacon were undercooked, runny and floppy. There were no basic staples on the table for toast or tea like butter, jam, honey. We had to ask our server for everything. Silverware was was dirty also. Tea was lukewarm and flavorless.

So worth the hype on yelp (10,000+ reviews). Make sure to make reservations in advance. My friends and I snagged a 5:15pm dinner reservation 24 hours in advance. When we arrived, we saw too many people waiting for a table. The skillet corn bread is a must! It is moist, contains pieces of corn, is not too sweet, and pairs perfectly with the sea salt butter/honey! The boneless ribeye is absolutely delicious as well. My friend and I shared the boneless ribeye with 2 sides of seven cheese macaroni (heavenly!) and string beans. Our friend's Founding Farmers salad was absolutely delicious as well. Service was attentive; we were checked on several times. However, they are quite busy so it may be difficult to flag your server down when needed. Parking doesn't seem the best around the area. Price point is a little higher than your everyday causal dining, but well-worth the slight splurge! Fresh ingredients and large portion sizes give good bang for your buck!Do check out this restaurant even if you are just visiting DC!"}, {"review_id": "bmtWOyfsL6PTsCjPvDb1SQ", "user_id": "WduM3RIQX64NamhRmBwSGw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/17/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Although this place has 4 stars with 7,600 reviews, I was pretty disappointed at the service and quality of the food. Thank lord I reserved before hand, I got a table at the time I reserved although I arrived early, the place was super packed. It was cute that they have a mini bookshelf with books for children and adults to read however the books were old and ripped. The waiting area was small so people were forced to wait outside. When seated, there were no server until a while later. I got the blue cheese balsamic bacon burger. It was average, I had better, but the value for the burger was decent. We also got the signature steak and the steak was burnt! We had it medium, it was definitely well done and burnt. We couldn't rip the burnt pieces out either because it was stuck onto the meat. The steak was really small and thin, not worth it's value. Another thing, I read the reviews about the dirty glasses. Our waiter came with the glasses and it was really dirty, I didn't even want to touch it or drink from it. So I ordered hot water. The cups were filled with coffee stains!! I was really disappointed with everything. I think it's about time for them to change a whole new set of cups and glasses. Everything is really old and disgusting. Wouldn't recommend this place.

Okay I'll keep this classy. Anyway, was not very thrilled about the slow, inattentive, and sometimes rude service.The food was mixed. The biscuits with gravy were nothing to write home about, BUT the cream filled french toast was AMAZING! It's probably one of my top favorite French toasts of all time. The bread tastes almost lightly fried and crispy, but the best part is the cream - the vanilla was not overly sweet and sickly. Instead, it was smooth and mild, while still complimenting the crunchy outside. I would go back SOLELY to eat like 50 of these orders. I hope next time I come back, the service will improve a little bit, because that french toast really was amazing."}, {"review_id": "alHMEr08oAQl3-b4H6O5XQ", "user_id": "3Rh4z7OoZQoH6LXgh783YA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "I loved everything we ate!!

Unfortunately brunch is only served until 2, but we still looked forward to the lunch menu (though we were slightly envious of those eating brunch.) We ordered the crab dip appetizer, chicken and waffles, and sausage and mushroom gnocchi. The crab dip came in a skillet and was accompanied with buttery bread. This was surprisingly large and filling for an appetizer - by the time we were mostly done with it, we were full. In addition the dip was too rich and buttery for us. I had a few bites of my sausage and mushroom gnocchi and thought it was delicious. I love gnocchi and I could taste that they were made fresh everyday. Outside of the food, the service was awful. Another table of two was seated next to us at the same time, but our server focused on them and ignored us. She would ask if they needed anything (then quickly leave,) and as a result they had their bill paid and their leftover food packed away, while I was still trying to find her to ask for the bill.  In addition I had to ask another server for take-away boxes. We finished our water within the first 10 minutes of the meal, and for the rest of the 1.5 hours, we never had our waters refilled.

First off, MAKE A RESERVATION. The people already waiting when we got there were still waiting as we were leaving. This place though was such a DISAPPOINTMENT.*Brie bread with Onion jam, crisp apple, brie. The onion jam was a bit sweet for me, I wish I had opted for a savory one like the pimiento. *Fried green tomatoes: tasted just as they sound, I didn't care for the two sauces they provided, one of which had goat cheese (not a fan of).*Chicken and waffles: the chicken was on the dry side, parts were salty as if the batter wasn't mixed well. The mac n cheese was cold when it came and it was barely better than the microwave mac n cheese you make at home. The best thing about this meal was probably the waffle itself. The waffle was light and airy!!*The ribs: dry don't do it.*Pot roast was nothing special.*Chicken pot pie was SWEET?!?! It was borderline inedible.
