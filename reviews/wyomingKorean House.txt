CASH (or local check) ONLY.2. 11AM to 6PM--closed Sat. & Sun.3. Legit. Korean food.That's really all you need to know. Oh, and it's small--5 or six tables. We had wait service too (for lunch). Staff is minimal, so service isn't the fastest in the world, necessarily, but they sure turn out terrific Korean entrees and traditional sides.I ordered \"Spicy Rice Cake\" which includes meat and finger-sized rice noodle/dumpling/cakes (really, I've never had anything like them--they were like giant udon noodles). This was all stirred together in a red-pepper paste. The entree was accompanied by spinach, bean sprouts with sesame oil, daikon, kimchi, and steamed rice. Tremendous!The Korean House is a local favorite, and is frequented by Air-Force personnel, particularly--it is only a few blocks from the base. Anyway, they are definitely military friendly. Authentic and unique in this town--five stars!"}, {"review_id": "g6xcnD9JHVT6O_etRONeTg", "user_id": "mNm6Vxy5kg8LMZmvSJX2lw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/30/2017", "text": "This place is fantastic.   Huge bowl of bibimbopWith homemade Kimchee,   I drive all the way from Fort Collins every week just to eat here."}, {"review_id": "fFL8ZA9ywbxIaV-G4Jx35w", "user_id": "TTm2FaW0SMLU1Gz_ZHjJvA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/31/2017", "text": "Food here is toe tapping yummy.  My favorite is the egg rolls.  These are not your anemic meatless carrot and cabbage filled egg rolls.  These egg rolls are a beefy meal in themselves!  Nicely seasoned with rice and kimchi on the side.  I just wish they gave you more kimchi it's delicious!   Couple of notes:  Bring cash they do not use plastic or any other form of pay here.  Also the food is pungent!  But that is part of the good stuff!  Just something to keep in mind before a date or job interview.  A must stop place if you have never tried Korean food or have a taste for something out of the ordinary!"}, {"review_id": "I4IAkXfZFiz_uhbHC9VRSw", "user_id": "VeYrSz7eeC18FY7end6PoQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/28/2017", "text": "Woah, this food is good. REALLY good. Like my Mom's Korean food good.First, be prepared. This place ONLY accepts cash payments. Bring cash! Also, don't be fooled by the $$ symbol. The prices here are very reasonable considering the price of Korean food anywhere else especially considering the portions. The dishes are almost all 10$ or 11$ with some being 15$ or 16$.I spotted this place as we were passing by on a CFD bus and resolved to go eat here at least once. My SO had reservations and worried about a random Korean joint in a small town. She figured that since they had a monopoly on Korean food the quality could be poor. A few bites of the Mandoo and her Chhap-chae later she was apologizing profusely for having doubted me and saying the food was AMAZING. She also noticed at how clean the establishment is and commented on that fact several times. Asians and Koreans in general tend to be fastidious folks when it comes to cleanliness in the home and you can tell that they treat this restaurant the same way.The Mandoo is hand made and filled with tasty tasty ground beef and then fried perfectly.The Spicy Pork meat is THE PERFECT balance of spicy and sweet in tender pork meat.I have a preference for fresh Kimchi and am not usually a fan of fermented Kimchi. However, the fermented Kimchi served here might make me switch my preferences.The Chhap-Chae is fresh and contains big chunks of Bulr-Gho-Ghee. So many other places cheap out and put very small amounts of meat in the sweet potato noodles but this place does NOT cheap out and puts in big ol' pieces in that dish. The portions are generous.I wonder if everything here is freshly made because there are no places in Cheyenne to go buy it off a shelf.The banchan side dishes are fresh and excellent.Don't expect fancy dishware or lots of little banchan plates. This place understandably caters more to the American palette in Cheyenne so don't expect a traditional Korean style meal. Banchan is time consuming to make and I believe a single person with her daughter runs this entire place.The hours are short and the place closes officially at 6pm. Everything in Cheyenne closes by 5 or 6pm.The place is small and from the outside the place is unassuming other than the signage in Korean. Which reads \"Korean Restaurant\" in Korean. The tables are few and the place is homey. I would imagine that the wait time could be longer than usual considering that one or two people run the whole show.They have a clean bathroom!Like a true master of her craft the Aujummah cooking and preparing all the food will come out at the end of your meal and ask you how it was. Wow, you get super upscale treatment from a random Korean restaurant in Cheyenne Wyoming???!!! I was absolutely stunned. You will only ever see that from a super fancy dining spot in some place like NY, LA or Denver where you paid hundreds or thousands for a dinner.I would DEFINITELY come back to this place and would even be willing to drive a bit out of the way to eat here again."}, {"review_id": "BwOf4MmenN07Nz6OyGGqZQ", "user_id": "wv52ho8uuGFYTN5HxLfIlA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/2/2017", "text": "Kimchi is the best in the area by a long shot. No Korean food in Northern Colorado... not a problem heat up to Wyo. Bibimbap is delicious, especially with beef. Dumplings are close to perfect, fried or steamed. Really a great experience!

I highly recommend the bibimnaengmyun (spicy cold noodles) if you enjoy piquant dishes. This is hard to get right outside of Korea and yet here I am eating the most delicious bowl I've had since moving back from Seoul (and I've had phenomenal ones in K-Towns in Atlanta, New Jersey, and New York). The owner is a sweet young lady that even had barley tea when I asked for it on request. Definitely completed the meal. It makes me feel more comfortable with potentially moving out this way knowing there is such a wonderful place in Cheyenne! ! :)"}, {"review_id": "I_ZB6Z5yP3Td56hVLdscAw", "user_id": "81_uhk-6qZwAaIVEJbZeKA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/29/2017", "text": "Hours are crappy but food is great!
