I was honestly impressed. First of all the ambience is perfect. The music is a mixture of piano and violin melodies which really set the mood. The decor is super lovely and feels authentic. Service was great. Now the food was phenomenal. For an appetizer I had lentil soup with pita and spinach and feta pastries which my date and I devoured truly. The main course we had falafel gyro and she had lamb which was killer man. The falafel tasted so fresh and homemade. Lastly the star of the show the damn baklava. On GD boi it was KILLER. With some black tea to sip it all down son I was ready to nap in Turkish Delight. But seriously the baklava ranks one of the best I've had. Also they serve it cold not warm. I've had baklava from Dubai before which was my best and I gotta say Turkish Delight really does deliver. Peace."}, {"review_id": "UhMHLsqVvxD2QDlXQNsfGw", "user_id": "pe6y8HOPIFB6NkIVKU57gQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "Today was our first visit to Turkish Delight and we cannot say enough good things. The little restaurant is clean and cute. The server, Jessica, was phenomenal. She genuinely made us feel like friends and she very obviously loves her job! She was happy to answer all of our questions and even gave us a tiny sample of something we were curious about. We tried the hummus appetizer and the spanakopita appetizer, the Turkish tea and apple tea, the falafel entree, the doner kebab entree, the baklava, and the Turkish delights. The hummus was the absolute best hummus we've ever had, the spanakopita was light and flavorful and perfect, the entrees were SO good, so flavorful, the tea was steeped perfectly, and the desserts were out of this world. 100% recommend that you try this place. We will be back soon!"}, {"review_id": "lKq4e7TcZcIk5-Y9Zos2pw", "user_id": "WLEBTB6JRrMbDgd3olEWYw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "This is a nice neighborhood restaurant.

When I finally came to this place, I ordered one of the specials called Musakka and it was very delicious! The rice was a great consistency- not too hard or soft. The  ground beef had a lot of flavor and the thick melted cheese on top was magnificent. My friend ordered the falafel which was also very tasty and came with a tasty refreshing salad. We drank turkish coffee which I wasn't expecting to have a grainy texture. The only downside was that the food took a long while to cook and the proportions were a little smaller than expected. The service was good and was quite busy around 8-9 on a Tuesday night!"}, {"review_id": "2QurMDLwoi0C0EzligVEBw", "user_id": "w7Og8DswNrL1bfxgWjNHMg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I just discovered Turkish Delight and really like this place for take away, it's worth the wait.

Son and i stopped in around 3 and had the place to ourselves,  I thought,  before others started coming in. We had doner kebob plate, meat shaved from the spinning contraption.  It was so good.

This was also really good.  We shared baklava and the Turkish delights.  These were awesome. Jello like squares with pistachio on bottom rolled in powder sugar.  We can't wait to come back to try the lentel soup and some appetizers. Staff was very friendly and helpful.

Turkish Delight is located in a strip mall tucked in the corner next to Sicily's Pizza and the FedEx store off of Northern Lights Blvd. and Lake Otis Pkwy. The seating area was cozy and inviting with furnishings and art on the walls to give the place an exotic Middle Eastern feel to it. We were greeted by a very friendly waitress who quickly seated us along with two glasses of ice water. She also handed us menus and gave us a couple of minutes to look over the selections without feeling rushed. She mentioned the specials for the day: Moussaka (eggplant, sliced potatoes, ground beef, zucchini, and a tomato-based sauce topped with plenty of melted cheese) or a specialty vegetable soup.I easily went with the Moussaka and my mother decided to go with the Anatolian Salad (mixed greens tossed with red and green peppers, cucumbers, olives, mint, and lemon dressing topped with feta cheese, parsley, and dill). There was also an appetizer called Dolmas (grape leaves stuffed with herbs and pine nuts) which I haven't had in ages that I just had to order. The Dolmas came out in just a couple of minutes and they were absolutely delicious. The grape leaves were brushed with extra virgin olive oil and the spices mixed in with the herbs provided a flavorful complement to the pine nuts. Our orders came a few minutes later and I eagerly went to the Moussaka. Their version was the best that I've had recently with the marinara-like tomato sauce pairing up perfectly with lots of melted cheese. The potatoes were perfectly cooked and provided a good counterbalance to the layers of ground beef and fried eggplant. Seasoned rice on a separate dish made for the perfect side of the main entree. My mother could not stop raving about the Anatolian Salad. It came with a large variety of mixed vegetables and massive chunks of feta cheese (like a 1/4 of the block!) drizzled with parsley and mint on top. She thought this was the kind of salad she could eat any day of the week in addition to being a very healthy option. Mom and I enjoyed every minute filling our bellies. Last but not least, I saw a dessert on their menu that I have not seen in any other Mediterranean restaurant I've been to here in Anchorage, their namesake Turkish Delight. I have loved these little treats since I was a kid and this was always a family favorite during the Christmas season. For those not familiar with this dessert, it is more commonly known in the US as Aplets & Cotlets which can be found in stores like Fred Meyers or Walmart during the holidays. The waitress gave me several different flavors which I can only guess was a berry flavor and shaved almonds with honey as well as powdered sugar sprinkled on top. Our waitress was even nice enough to throw in a few extra pieces when I told her that this was a childhood favorite. After such a great meal, there was no question that I would come back to try some of their other menu items.Ones that caught my attention were the Baba Ghanoush (roast eggplant puree seasoned with garlic (yes!) and extra virgin olive oil topped with yogurt), the Doner Kebab (rotisserie beef and lamb served on a bed of seasoned rice with tzatziki sauce on the side), and the Lamb Pirzola (lamb chops served with rice). One of the most enjoyable dining experiences I've had recently and it was really cool to watch the owner and the chefs prepare the meals next to the tables. I hope this place stays around for a long time and I encourage other Yelpers to try this place out if they haven't done so already. Those who work in the Midtown area are so lucky to have an awesome place like this close by and it shows with how packed the place gets during the lunch rush."}, {"review_id": "aVmZgPJp0mlMGcPF5U2OGQ", "user_id": "OFRu8t9PkYyid-i3UxlF6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "Turkish Delight is my favorite restaurant in Alaska!

Fortunately, Turkish Delight proves me wrong. Tucked away in a part of town that most tourists never visit this restaurant is one of the better that we have found in Anchorage. And while it's a small restaurant it dishes out quality food and big flavor. Unfortunately, because it isn't overwhelmed by tourists it doesn't get the same exposure on social media that many other popular restaurants like Moose's Tooth, Glacier Brewhouse, 49th State Brewery and others do. This is good and bad. It's poor for business, but it's good news for you because there might be a place for you to sit in the small restaurant.What we can guarantee is that the food here is going to be far better than average. In fact, this restaurant would survive in larger cities like Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and Los Angeles and I know that because I've eaten quality Mediterranean food everywhere on the West Coast and what you find here rivals most of the others. It is some of the better food you're going to find in Anchorage. Don't be afraid to go out on a limb and try something on the menu that you may not be familiar with.Their main dish tends to be the doner kebab which is like shawarma if you've never heard of this terminology before. Normally, they serve it with a small salad and rice. This meal comes as a entree or in pita bread. And if you're going to come as far as trying this you better order the red lentil soup. They do a heck of a job with it here. If you're hungry I would suggest starting with their hummus. It's clearly made on site and fresh daily."}, {"review_id": "kU-xiF-fb3XnD3FLm2_5cQ", "user_id": "F8mIgACrgaEzW7CouabBUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/4/2017", "text": "I'm a first timer here and was greeted with warmth and a wonderful server happy to answer any questions and give recommendation The food came quickly and smelled delicious!  I got the Adonis by recommendation of our server and was extremely happy.

Nestled in the strip mall that is home to the Fed-Ex ship and copy center, this new gem is sure to please. My party ordered three appetizers. I loved the baba ghanoush but we also enjoyed the spanakopita and dolmas. The flaky pastry of the spanakopita was so light and delicious it melted in your mouth- as my mom said, \"I'd come back here just to eat the spanakopita!\" For entrees the table got two kabab entrees, the chicken kabab and the lamb. Everyone agreed that my chicken skewers were the best because the meat was so tender and it was seasoned with a bit of spice. The kabab were good but lacked that extra flavor that the chicken had. My dad liked his lamb but said it did have a natural gas taste. By the end of our meal we were all stuffed and satisfied. I'll be sticking to my chicken entree for back up but I'm interested to try some other menu items. Service was quick and friendly.
