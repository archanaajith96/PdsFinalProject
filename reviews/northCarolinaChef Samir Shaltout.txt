Some of the reviewers of this place are misinformed. Parking is plentiful due to its location beside 2 large big box stores.There was no wait when we ate dinner here and the staff was fast and very helpful.If you come on your lunch break, be patient and wait. The staff is not slow, the place is busy because the food is amazing. If you love kebabs and shawarmas, you must try how the Egyptians cook.Try the fattush you will love it.We wish we made room for dessert, if they execute the dissertation the way they do their main dishes, it must be heavenly.Remember good food is worth the wait, be patient and polite. The staff is not slow, they are busy, when you taste the food you will know why."}, {"review_id": "o7WO0LiOoPPwLan8gvER_Q", "user_id": "W7Y42iEV4I9zQL1Ui1O1hA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Yum yum yum! Came here with some friends and we ordered a bunch of food. Everyone enjoyed their dishes. There was a hot tea which I've never seen before with the tea loose in the bottom. Looked weird but my friend loved it! The meat was marinated just right. The rice was super tender and hit the spot. There was a salsa I mixed into the rice and it was a perfect blend. Servers were attentive and filled our drinks often. Food took quite a bit of time to come out and at first it took a while to get a server at all. Also, the pita bread never came until we asked a second time. They werent overly busy so idk what the deal was, but food was on point."}, {"review_id": "4SJo8hWcVPHWyRpNKacp0w", "user_id": "DxFINXS_AwDchvYuKJsw9g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "This quaint little eatery may appear to be closed upon your arrival but a quick peek inside will show you the hordes of families patiently waiting their hour long vigils for the delicious food that is delivered... eventually...

She should have come out and told me before the food was delivered she never apologized for it and honestly the price is double what you pay at Sarah's and the quality of food is better there.. so honestly just drive down the road a mile and go to Sarah's."}, {"review_id": "Alr99ZADsaXo02GBrZDYwA", "user_id": "k7u41AD0cZSJDC_CKDliiw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "My husband and I LOVE this place, as do many of my friends (one of whom is from Egypt).  We all live in Winston Salem and travel just for this food.Not sure what this other reviewer Jennifer C is taking about, but the food is always good and the service is always prompt.  I guess busy nights are busy everywhere, but we've never waited so long or had issues with food or plates.We've met the chef / owner.  He's also talked to my mom on the phone when she got us some surprise gift certificates.

My friend and I arrived around 5pm, there were 2 other occupied tables. We were seated right away and was brought the appetizer (baba ghanoush) within 5-7 minutes. About 5 minutes later, they brought us the entrees. I am not sure why other people who reviewed the place experienced such high wait times. Could be the day of the week or time of day when you go there. We personally enjoyed the decor and music/ ambiance. It felt like a family restaurant and the food tasted accordingly, which we greatly appreciated and enjoyed! I highly recommend it and will definitely be back when we are in the area again!"}, {"review_id": "_ULmwx11VEdH90Na0OrPSw", "user_id": "GwkE5ALitVrwVwJipQLfog", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Highly recommended !

As our waitress said each was more than enough for two people.   The ground beef with spices is the same used for their Egyptian burger which I will try next time for lunch.          We told the waitress how we enjoyed the food and she brought the owner/ Chef Samir to our table.

You can't beat local! We had the hummus served with warm pita. I had a very sweet hibiscus tea called Karkadeh. It was similar to cranberry juice and served cold, but without ice. We had a beef and a chicken shawerma. Both were tasty. I think I liked the chicken a little better. I also had the the kofta. Dishes were served with side salad and hummus.

I've only come here once and the food took so long to come out. Maybe it was an off day but every table waited a while for their food. I got the babaganoush and the calamari and tomato appetizers. They tasted ok but the babaganoush only came with a singe pita bread. It's very less compared to eat with the amount of babaganoush that you get. I wanted to get another one but the server didn't come by until I'd eaten all of it from just picking at it. My fiancé got a chicken shawerma with salad and rice and it was a way better choice than what I ordered. It was a pretty good meal. I think overall, the food here was good. I found it a bit expensive for what you get though and the wait was way too long. On the plus side, it's located in a strip mall with plenty of parking."}, {"review_id": "IOaSjE0D2dBe71Suyrssog", "user_id": "6gcROw4JaHzYzUey5_iY8w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "I was in Greensboro for few days and i found this place it was near my hotel i just went there for quick lounch and i went back there 4 times in two days food is amazing i really enjoyed very friendly and family place food takes a bit to long but i guess cuz everything is made fresh and it taste fresh and amazing"}, {"review_id": "Clem_WV2mE4EnG9w1jjWrA", "user_id": "8vVdLfJaiGF-aoPMJ82Qhw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/17/2017", "text": "This is my second trip here in a 2 month span. This place is awesome! Don't let the strip mall that this little jewel is situated in fool you. Everything here seems to be wonderful and the ambience is crazy authentic. The music could be a little bit distracting at first but after a few minutes it just blends right in with the conversation. The decor is almost breathtaking! This place is beautiful! I do wonder what all the cameras are for though?? Nice place for a date or to bring some friends. They do have some kids food like burgers and fries or chicken tenders. I seem to like the fish! That is the chef specialty and he literally taught me how to eat it the last time I was here. If you are looking for an authentic place where cooking is celebrated and the chef is going to come greet you at the table because he loves his job then look no further!!!!"}, {"review_id": "5eNTas0JozsTx1Jd5bZWVg", "user_id": "gXxnO9iQNiJMvZTJ4qkRpQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "The food is up there with the best Middle Eastern food I've ever had and that is saying something.

It is so beautiful inside I was so surprised.My food was good. I had split pea soup that was very tasty, I could have eaten more. My main dish was kabobs. The chicken had been marinated and it was delicious.They are open relatively late for strip mall restaurants I think they close at 10, and I showed up at 9:30. None-the-less everything was hot fresh and yummy. No one was sweeping and trying to get the door shut which made me feel like I'd walked in at the prime dinner hour.Good service and smiling faces made it a very nice and relaxing experience. It was a perfect ending to a long exhausting day.I will go there again.

Took my 93yr old Grandma out for my Mother's BDay! The owners wife was possibly the waitress! She had NO social skills! We were given chipped plates, wet napkins and waited almost 2 hrs!!!!Grandma was freezing & i had to leave to go buy a blanket! We decided to leave when i came back and saw the my family still had not been even served our appetizers! Finally after waiting some more about 1/3 of our was brought out on chipped plates. The order was all wrong! I was frusterated & after 2hrs the food I had been waiting on tasted bland!! I got up to pay for what was on the table and stated  I was displeased and wanted to pay for what was on the table. All the sudden out of the kitchen came the owner and he was so ugly looking with his face scowled like I had done something wrong to him!! He TRIED to humiliate me by yelling at me in front of the guests!!! He accused me of wanting a free meal! I was in disbelief and felt threatened by the owner like he was about to attack me!! I contacted the the news, BBB & will not ever ever recommend his restaurant to any of my Egyptian or Middle Eastern family! All the decor is just to entice you, but the show a d food is ZERO Quality! Don't waste your TIME or $!!!
