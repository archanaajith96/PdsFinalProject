Obviously it's what they're known for, I always get the Apple & Brie, Tomato Mozzarella & Basil and then I change up the rest! They offer a seasonal which is always really delish! I like that the bread is rock hard, and everything is always fresh! This is one of my favorite meals, yes I said meals! I can eat an entire platter by myself! My mom LOVES the spicy jam and goat cheese! They also have really great drinks, and I personally like their honey cucumber lemonade!"}, {"review_id": "MspcgFHMHSR8TKgMFalc5Q", "user_id": "qJ9hRBBCh7c3pnuz_TF-0Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "Only in town 1 night and looked for a quiet spot for a glass of wine.  The wine was great -- Reisling called 'Perfect' and it was actually pretty perfect!  And the bruschetta -- so creative!  Of about 10 toppings, you get to pick 4.  Perfect late night snack!  Music was pretty loud, so the quiet part of the evening wasn't so much, but the wine and apps definitely made up for it.  The vibe is chill - - I'd go back next time I'm in town -- absolutely."}, {"review_id": "Bs4j42yxeiL1sFeCIAaHmA", "user_id": "WjPLEr26Y0nW_ZtCEymnDw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "This is such a great location! Fun fact: it is the first postino and it used to be a post office! Hence the name! Anyways, I like coming to this one a lot more compared to the one on central or the one in Tempe because I almost always get a table without a wait. As usual, food as service are great. The soup of the day was home made chicken noodle with pesto and lemon! Mmmmm so good."}, {"review_id": "0Tsa0wKwGb7wOx67f1OxZg", "user_id": "FI3ifkvRol42AkyyhpEgrQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "This has to be my favorite Postino's. The servers are all awesome, and the wait doesn't ever seem too terrible. I always come here for Board and Bottle in the evening, the ambiance is so cute, with the lights and the shrubs that separate the restaurant from the parking lot. Joseph served us this last week and we had a great time. However, the interaction with all of the other employees has been great. The only awkward part is when I get seated next to my friends like we are on a date, but we always make it a fun time!"}, {"review_id": "KzjC4b8PUQ1CqNw1rosX6w", "user_id": "1WMkREeVSBvXZ6QON44ucA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Love Postino!!

This place isn't the ideal place for large groups, but they found us a real comfortable spot for around 12 people. The menu has a great selection of sandwiches, bruschetta platters and wine. Although the wine selection varies between different postino restaurants, they have amazing deals on specific days of the week. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a relaxed evening dinner with friends and family."}, {"review_id": "MUw-Zo01oC2rbJ-Xn93_8Q", "user_id": "-ucHsBfBwLbn5zW4wJsOsw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "They had me at $5 glasses of wine and beer pitchers everyday until 5pm! I heard about Postino from a few friends and of course, Yelp, so we made it there for New Years Day brunch before catching our flight. We sat outside because the weather was amazing. The outdoor patio is a great place for wonderful vibes, a nice view and good service. This location is in a neighborhood and definitely would be a frequent stop for me if I lived nearby. Tons of people coming in to buy wine to go because you can and it's $9 off bottles!We ordered the Farmer's Scramble and the Roast Beef Panini (on ciabatta). Both were outstanding! The Scramble was so moist, cheesy and earthy. And the greens on the side were so simple and tasty. I ordered a glass of the French Rosé and it paired perfectly with the Scramble and the weather. Service was a tad slower than I hoped and that's why they didn't get a 5 star review. But overall, they seemed to have the flow down."}, {"review_id": "Ik7DJH8xuj7XRJuAX7iA8g", "user_id": "ZjaNE5PtYk8j2K1kOpr2Ig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "I love Postino they have the best bruschetta ever.

We can during happy hour and our wait ended up being around 45 minutes, but well worth it! Two happy hour times, and on Mondays/Tuesday's (when we went) the late happy hour starts at about 8PM.Parking is hard to come by during peak times; luckily someone pulled out not too long after we got there. Parking spot right in front of the entrance. When we were eventually seated - we ordered their happy hour special - bruschetta board. It's a $15 board of four types of bruschetta -- you're choice of a variety of flavors and combinations. With it being happy hour - you get the full board plus $5 for an entire bottle of wine!! By the time we left we got 2 boards and 2 bottles of wine. Since we didn't even finish the first one, you can easily take home your open and unopened bottles! They even package it in a cute paper bag.Our bruschetta board (the flavors we choose) were: First board - Brie and apples with a fig spread, prosciutto with fig and marscapone, smoked salmon with pesto, ricotta with dates and pistachios. This flavors were to die for! There's definitely something about a cheese and fruits combination. My favorites - Brie and apples and the ricotta with dates and pistachios. Second board -- Brie and apples again, fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil, burrata, bacon, arugula, and tomatoes, and their seasonal flavor which was a type of specialty ham and a lemon herb ricotta. By the way, their bread is gluten free!The bruschetta board is a definite must, and if you're also looking for something fancy - try the butchers block. We also enjoyed this assortment of artisan meats and cheeses served with smoked almond hummus, olives, asparagus, nuts, and crostinis.My meal was accompanied by a refreshing cucumber honey lemonade. I cannot fathom enough how much I enjoyed this restaurant and wine bar! It's perfect for a date night or just a girls night out. Outside seating just as beautiful like inside. A must try!"}, {"review_id": "YDLYCgau3mwoqqdXipRh9Q", "user_id": "pgUQjUl_2G5L9EreDzIjSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/11/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "My friend and I have been here a few times since my last review.

You never disappoint. No matter what time I show up, Postino has my back. I've been to this location twice: once for a group lunch on the patio and once with a friend for brunch. Both times were excellent. Deal: They usually have a drink deal of some sort: a small pitcher of beer or a glass of wine for $5 during lunch time, or a glass of bubbly- champagne, prosecco or sparkling rosé for $5 during brunch. My favourite of course, is the bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20. I've only gone to the Tempe location for this deal, however I'm sure it would be awesome here as well given my other experiences at this location. Service: I've never had a bad experience here. They were attentive, but not overbearing. Food: I want to give whoever created this menu a big hug. They basically use all my favorite ingredients in all their dishes like pesto, delicious bread, savory meats, artichokes... the list could go on forever. For lunch, I've had their 1/2 sandwich and salad combo. If I'm grabbing lunch with my boyfriend, we can usually split a whole sandwich- they're pretty hefty. Brunch yesterday was also delicious. I had the country toast with Italian ham, dijonaise (is that Dijon with mayonnaise?), and gruyere. It had these amazingly fresh tomatoes tossed in pesto. That was by far my favorite part. I wonder if I can just order a bowl of that next time. There will be a next time; the question however, is what time of the day it will be."}, {"review_id": "y14-6tLq2awtslnu8y50cA", "user_id": "XXZwX4E_CjJoe2bvCJzb3w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/14/2017", "text": "Bruschetta heaven! Postino Arcadia is a romantically decorated and very cute Italian wine bar in that I was dying to try during my short trip to Phoenix.FOOD: 7/10SERVICE: 7/10ATMOSPHERE: 10/10FOOD: + Smoked Salmon with Pesto ($15 for 4 flavors): Yum! This was really great cause I'm a huge fan of smoked salmon and pesto. It wasn't particularly fresh or populated with salmon though. + Almond Hummus & Tomato Bruschetta ($15 for 4 flavors): This was delicious as well! I highly recommend this if you like hummus.+ Salami with Pesto Bruschetta ($15 for 4 flavors): This was okay! If it was up to me, I would've gotten another order of the Smoked Salmon with Pesto. There was only one piece of salami, and it was very mediocre.+ Warm Artichoke Spread ($15 for 4 flavors): SO CHEESY. I can't particularly handle cheese, so I didn't like this at all. I do not recommend this if you don't love cheese.+ Turkey Panini: Good enough! Nothing spectacular but it was tasty.+ Brussel Sprouts Salad: Not what I was expecting AT ALL. It was mostly regular salad leaves with some brussel sprout leaves at the bottom. I was definitely expecting whole brussel sprouts or at least more of it. Not impressed with this.SERVICE:Decent service. They were attentive and refilled my water a lot but weren't very friendly.ATMOSPHERE:So cute! Very romantic. We sat on the outside patio where there was mist to keep us cool from the 107 degree Phoenix heat. Lots of lights and lush greenery. Good date spot.Overall, would recommend it purely for the ambiance and bruschetta options. Not the freshest or best food I've had but pretty good for Phoenix restaurants."}, {"review_id": "V5uVuCwozmJYuBMx4wM7gg", "user_id": "C8CBOjO7s32dCW0DRmiL9Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "The service here is always above par!

You have to go with their bruschetta boards because it's such a good value and absolutely delicious. My personal fav would be the prosciutto with fig and mascarpone. The board comes with four different bruschetta choices all for only $15, and the bruschetta is big so you'll get full!Highly suggest coming on Tuesday for their wine deal where you get a whole bottle of wine and bruschetta board for just $20. Lastly, top it off off with their salted caramel sundae,ahhhhh-mazing!!  Chocolate covered corn nuts, pretzel and caramel topping vanilla ice cream, how can you go wrong?Can't say enough good things about this restaurant, I go all the time!
