They have been making pizza for over three decades, and once you walk in, it totally has that feel. Although built for families - nice big tables, heavy wooden chairs, and large family sized booths - it's dimly lit, and generations of local sports and community memorabilia adorn the walls.The food is good - pizza, sandwiches, and soups. On this visit, I had the chili. Thick and rich, with just a kick of the spicy hot stuff on the end. This was a great appetizer for my favorite - the loaded strom. I added tons of cheese, mushrooms, cheese, peperoncinis, cheese, onions, cheese, and cheeeeeeese. Now what makes this place special is it doubles as a brewery. While they have some nice house selections, I have an affinity for Rudolph's Revenge, a nice red Belgian strong ale; it achieves lots of complexity with its coriander, Belgian candi-sugar, and malted barley flavors. It comes in a smaller portion, due to its 10 ABV, but with a larger price tag. It is worth the extra cost - I usually end up leaving with a growler of the red stuff. The wait staff is nice and attentive, but you definitely want to beat the lunch and dinner crowds.Since it is family-oriented, I typically avoid dining there at dinner time or after a local sporting event, to avoid all the children; during those hours, this place is chocked full of the rascally little Devil's sprog, wall-to-wall."}, {"review_id": "BYCku8Hg55aqWgXCRL9o1A", "user_id": "wUZlYQ-ICS3nug_iSLN-Xw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "I've always loved Turoni's. I live in Louisville, but my grandparents live here. Whenever we visit, we always go to Turoni's! The pizza is some of the best ultra thin crust I've had as it's cracker thin and is always perfectly browned! The toppings are always phenomenal, and the Supreme is absolutely excellent. Their appetizers are also great especially their garlic bread! The beers are just the icing on the cake! They have their own brewery and their stuff never disappoints! I especially love their stouts and seasonal offerings! Service is always on point as well!"}, {"review_id": "QNm3x0JiYsmtYXNDxv7uXw", "user_id": "bTz0OsKesCXTtSNFSmkvWA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/11/2017", "text": "Turoni's is a brewpub pizzeria offering a handful of homemade brews and speciality pizzas (See menu above). The beers being mostly of the IPA or red type. They do have a honey blonde which is a little too sweet in my humble opinion.For an appetizer, I tried their bruschetta. If you are expecting traditional Italian, skip it. It's more of a garlic bread creation with a melted blend of cheeses over red onions and tomatoes. Not very Italian at all.I also decided to try a small Vinny's Pepper Planet Pizza consisting of a variety of different pepper species, mushrooms, bacon bits, ham, and a blend of cheeses all spread over a Chicago thin style crust. Again, not very Italian, but it was quite tasty.In closing, I'll say this: Italian, it certainly isn't. Tasty it certainly is. The great and friendly service was very much welcomed. Give it a shot."}, {"review_id": "ZNQnZQEtAYpFebXGZBOV4w", "user_id": "-q76Umie5X1TbO4YE-O-9g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "My mouth is watering as I type this dreaming of pizza.

PERFECTION!!!Our server was great with my bi-polar beer choices...ended up bringing me several samples before I chose.  The beer is always good especially since they brew it themselves...I'm SO sick of the normal Busch/Bud Light options!! Microbrew heaven here.The topper for us was the magician that came around...yea, these guys can be over-the-top annoying sometimes, but he put a huge smile on my son's face and put us all in awe!  Great addition.Know before you go:  Two entrances.  One is the family side and one is the over 21 bar/restaurant side.  Both croweded."}, {"review_id": "-Gt0m6TwIakDlq-vr8IkLg", "user_id": "Kt03W-u7q3JjDJt2Y4gH0w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/17/2014", "text": "First time at this location in probably 30 years, and not even sure if it was turonis yet at that time . I have just ordered, and the first thing i got was water and the waitress went right up to the bar and grabbed a glass (plastic) and jammed it down into the ice bin. Isnt that like super unsanitary? Other than that, this place is super cute and clean as far as i can tell. The waitress is saying to another customer that the newburgh and main st locations have switched to a brick oven style oven and this location still uses a pizza pan. She is saying the locations have many different things and she doesnt know why they are different.   I love the food at the main street location so in about 30 min i will rate this locations pizza. ....So, i like the crust here better than main st. But the top has less flavor. I still like the pizza alot.

Turoni's, albeit in the small town of Evansville, are actually very innovative in terms of the art of creating a specialty pizza, and micro brews. Turoni's, long before it was the cool thing to do, starting brewing their own beer. And, is it ever some damn good beer!The atmosphere is dark, which I actually like. The service is generally decent, or better. Supposedly, Turoni's pays their employees a higher hourly wage. If true, this is pure genius on their part, as it keeps their employees faithful, and they spend less time rehiring, and instead, focusing on the business. Great pizza (traditional & specialty), great sandwiches (must try the Stromboli), but the prices are ridiculously high, in my opinion, for a small town restaurant. But, even with the insane prices, I do still return every time that I'm back in Evansville."}, {"review_id": "aDeR9IvkW6Z_qNScc2WdMw", "user_id": "gIeU7F_ROMHJ_vAoyzhAQA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "7/19/2014", "text": "Not even sure if this place is open an longer - this review was started in 2012, I am just trying to catch up on my reviews from out of state - I had the 9\"turonis house special pizza...
