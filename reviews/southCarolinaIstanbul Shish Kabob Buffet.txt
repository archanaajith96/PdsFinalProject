The service is friendly and the dish offerings are authentic and plentiful. They have a great variety of the usual traditional meat and vegetable dishes. What's nice about Middle Eastern food is that it's all about the spice, not being spicy. However, their chili sauce and spicy chicken dishes have exceptional flavor. The chicken kabobs are very juicy. The naan bread comes out on a conveyor and is quite good. I think my favorite portion, as unsuspecting as it is, is the rice!The prices are very reasonable and you'll walk away very satisfied."}, {"review_id": "oXu4yYhMOnVXosUgykQdaA", "user_id": "8BfroxlRPvQwmI7AV23-Yw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "This is where one realizes that Charleston is beautifully increasing the degree of diverse and ethnic cuisine to a much greater angle. Who could guess that what looks like a nonchalant strip mall cafe across from Tanger Outlets, was such a true hidden gem, with saporous fare. Istanbul Shish Kabob is a unique buffet with Middle Eastern delights. It is affordably priced at $9.99 for lunch or $13.99 for evenings and weekends. You get to choose two out of a selection of meats: chicken, beef steak, lamb, ground beef or shrimp. This will be one skewer of kebab per choice, grilled over charcoal with a delectable smoky aroma, served right to your table. Alternatively, one can choose a chicken shawarma or beef shawarma as one of the meat options instead. The buffet has a multitude of vibrant, brightly colored foods that capture the essence of mystic promise. Starting off there is a lentil soup. This is followed by freshly made pita bread that is continually rolling off the conveyor oven. There are several types of dips; hummus, baba ghanoush (creamy eggplant),  tzatziki (cucumber yoghurt) , moutabal (spicier baba ghanoush) and a finger licking creamy garlic dip. There are a selection of different salads, including tabbouleh and several tomato based combinations as well as slices of peppers and grilled chunky onion wedges. There are beans and lentils galore, my own favorite being foul meddamas, a lemony fava bean dish. There's dolma (grape leaves stuffed with rice) and meatballs and pea curry and spicy mushrooms and rice and pasta and chicken curry and potatoes and... and... it's endless...There really is such a huge selection, it would be hard to actually try every dish. The service is great by this family run restaurant. It's comfortable and casual and there is something for everyone. The amazing, aromatic food along with my adorable and handsome date, made this casual dine into a super, fine dine . If you think it's time to titillate your senses, it's time to pay Istanbul Shish Kebob Buffet a visit."}, {"review_id": "GAtNuvriL5GiDsDR0_MAnw", "user_id": "TF128PGL-9q2y_uYxh_sWw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "I love trying foods from different regions, seeing how the spice pallet changes and enjoying the flavor combinations. Istanbul Buffet is a great place for this as the buffet held many items, hot and cold.For lunch you get two kabobs. Choice of chicken or ground beef. Other meats are available for dinner. I got one of each. The grilled flavor and subtle spices enhance the meat well, and sauces are available to take it up another level. A hot pepper paste had some nice heat and flavor. Other items on the buffet ranged from savory to sweet, hot and cool. The bread, like a puffed roll, was great. It looks like a Hot Pocket, but empty. Stuff it with what you like I would have liked to end my meal with a Turkish coffee or a desert, but I saw none. If this is available, someone let me know. I was told the ice cream machine was broken. They have been open here for 7 months.As usual, 3 gradesLocation: 3.5Tucked into a strip area at Tanger, It is Central to much of the shopping area. Clean, but fairly basic.Service: 4Employees seemed nice, but reserved. They were polite when asked questions.  Not intrusive while I was eating, which I appreciate.Food: 4Everything had a good flavor. Warm but not hot (On the hot portion of the buffet). Still, I found it acceptable, and it's not a big complaint. Choices were good with about 5 hot items and 6 others on the cool side of the buffet. Try the corn salad!Overall: 4 stars. A must try.

There is hot, fresh bread coming out at all times. Could anything be better than that? I could have easily just filled-up on bread but definitely suggest you save room for the rest of the buffet. There is a hot and cold section with an impressive array of colors and tastes. The dish name labels don't always match up with the tray of food but I personally like eating with a little bit of mystery. The spicy potatoes were simply delicious. I made sure to get a lot of the yogurts and sauces to dip my kabobs in. Also, they have very long tables with booths that seat 3-4 to a side. If you are dining with a group it can be hard to get in and out of the booth for more food. You might want to fill up 2 plates at a time if you are stuck all the way inside the booth :)"}, {"review_id": "qBT3cA-RMADUkWX8AU_8Jw", "user_id": "UMQ9ZFsZW-EHw9qc-1esDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "I was already a frequent visitor at this place when they were still open in Mount Pleasant, and was so sad when they were no longer open... Until I found out they reopened in the tanger outlet area! Still an absolute favorite. They have an awesome fresh all-you-can-eat buffet. You will feel as gluttonous as I do when it comes to this lovely spread of Turkish food. The pita bread and hummus with a side of chicken kebabs makes me happy as a clam!

The Kabobs, and shwarmas are authentic, great mix of salads and hot bar, and the service for the most part, really good. On any other day, ISK would be a solid 4.5* venture but TODAY... They lost 2 stars for a rookie cash mistake. Normally, I pay with a card or what not, so it's not an issue. But today I paid with cash. The bill was $11.19 and I paid with a $20. The server came back with $8. Now, I was going to leave the change balance and a paper amount as a tip anyway, but that should be the patron's decision to make, not the server. YES I wanted my 81 cents back when I hand you cash.

For one price you can help yourself to the buffet and also two kebabs of your choice. (There also might be a menu of other stuff? As soon people got other dishes and pitas.) The buffet itself has really good options -- yummy bread, amazing tzatziki and other dips, rice, grilled vegetables, and a handful of meat and veggie dishes. There's enough different stuff that could be your meal alone. On top of that are your two kebabs. The best by far was the chicken--really moist and cooked well. The steak was a bit tough but still tasty. The lamb and shrimp were fine. For dessert, they have ice cream pops and sandwiches on a freezer. For the price, you cannot beat it. It tastes pretty authentic too, which can be hard to find in the Charleston area.

After trying them all, I highly recommend the ground beef and chicken!!! The steak wasn't the most tender but it still had good flavor. Everything on the buffet was very tasty - I wish everything was labeled, so I knew what I was eating. Everything was extremely fresh and flavorful. Highly recommend the garlic sauce. One of the workers would walk around with Chicken Shawarma, which was to die for; I could have just eaten that all evening and been very happy! The meal was worth every penny!! They even provided to-go boxes for the kabob leftovers, which is very rare for buffet restaurants to provide.
