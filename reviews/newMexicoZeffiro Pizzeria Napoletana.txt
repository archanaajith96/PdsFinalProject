Very unassuming from the exterior, so I knew it was my kind of place. We were promptly seated, served our beverages, and were served fresh ciabatta bread with garlic butter. They make this in house daily and it is as good as any ciabatta bread. We ordered 1 pizza and salad to share for our lunch date. The salad was the chicken Greek salad with pesto dressing and wow they did a phenomenal job with the seasoning on the chicken, the fresh ingredients, and the amazing Pesto dressing. We ordered a second to go. The pizza was fennel sausage and mushroom. Crust was fantastic, as was the sausage, but there was a little bit of something (salt maybe) lacking. Still great pizza! I will be back next time I am in town and highly recommend this place."}, {"review_id": "m8m7XI3oESlWzsFtLDpxDA", "user_id": "wiBJWa3RBh-Q7jM4J4dCEw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "Random & excellent find thanks to Yelp . Freshly baked bread with tasty olive oil crushed with garlic.  Thin & perfectly baked pizza crust. Fresh mozzarella cheese, basils. Quaint decor.

I love their food, the open kitchen, and watching them make espresso, but I hate their tables and chairs. They are ugly and uncomfortable. They just bring me down. Please invest in lovely tables and chairs. The food competes with the best, but they need to create an overall dining experience. Napoletana describes more than pizza. It's a way of life. In Italy eating is an experience of joy."}, {"review_id": "FJ5OTwyFMRMzptn7fJkC5g", "user_id": "On7KqGp-Sx4P_aJT7peFNQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/26/2017", "text": "The pizzas are good, my least favorite one is the Greek pizza.

We ordered a fennel sausage and mushroom pizza and a half order of casa pasta. The pizza came out a a bit floppier than I'd like and I was surprised it came out of a wood fire oven. I had high hopes for the fennel sausage, but it was pretty flavorless. I've definitely had better pizza, and probably will not order it here again. The pasta was pretty good. You can tell the noodles are homemade and the sauce was not bitter. Again, I would have liked a bit more flavor. The star of the dinner was the salad. Everything was fresh, the dressing was not overwhelming, and the croutons seemed homemade. The bread they served before the meal was also excellent.

We were impressed by the reviews and pics of this place so decided to give it a shot. It is located in the downtown part of the city which is super quaint and clean. This restaurant has both inside and outside (screened) seating which I thought was nice. We sat inside near the amazing, blazing oven so we could see food being made first hand and drooled as we decided what we wanted to try. We had the mixed green side salad which was so fresh and delicious. It comes with Strawberry vinaigrette, but our waiter Nate (who was the best by the way) told us to also try their house made Balsamic Honey Vinaigrette so we tried both on the side. I absolutely loved the BHV and the SV was also very good. So thankful he had us try both. For our entree we chose a pepperoni mushroom pizza and it was the best we have had in a very long time. Cooked perfectly and the ingredients were super fresh especially the mushrooms which can often be a regret at most pizza places. If you are even in Las Cruces you must stop by and check it out."}, {"review_id": "8_qgCy8O3QbBV_bCL3_avw", "user_id": "NWThWdXtMNxDZ-K_p-hPzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2017", "text": "Amazing food!!!!!

If you want to carb load on some authentic pasta (or you just want some good food) then you need to come here. I didn't want anything too sauce heavy or creamy so I had the Mediterranean Pasta dish and added chicken.  I don't think I could order anything different if I can come again next year.

Let's start with the bread--- love that it's fresh! The garlic paste with EVOO on the table and freshly grated parmigiana reggiano is the best! My husband ordered their pasta with cream sauce and prosciutto which was  amazing. Very creamy yet not heavy. The fresh pasta made a big difference too. I ordered their lemon asparagus pizza and asked to add chicken for added protein. The pizza tasted great but the crust was not crispy enough. Don't get me wrong, the flavors were there but Neapolitan pizza to me means thin & crispy. It was thin but not crispy and the bottom was a little burnt which made the pizza taste burnt. We also ordered spaghetti and meatballs to go. It looked great at first but when we got home, the sauce they put wasn't enough. I literally had to make some spaghetti sauce so I could salvage it. I wanted to like this place but the food didn't quite make it memorable. The service was great though."}, {"review_id": "41IQtdOk1PNPsxR8QO9XHA", "user_id": "i89p-mJGkqyo2d8CGeIpOA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "This is a \"regular \" lunch place of ours.

Upon being seated we received a basked of bread with a side of garlic butter. My son and husband loved the bread but it wasn't my favorite. It would have been a million times better if it had been served warm. Cold, hard bread isn't my thing. Considering that we got there right when they opened for dinner, the bread could have been warmer.We ordered a pizza with pepperoni, chicken, and black olives. The pizza had excellent flavor, but the crust was a little too thin for me. We also ordered a pepperoni calzone and that was AMAZING! It was stuffed with pepperoni and cheese and the crust was crunchy on the outside and and soft on the inside. It came with a side of marinara sauce to dip. I didn't love the marinara at first but it grew on me as the meal went on. The customer service was excellent.
