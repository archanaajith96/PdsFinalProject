I was so excited to try this place -- such a high rating! -- and left feeling totally let down.Hummus: the best thing we had. Garlicky and good, but nothing extraordinary.Lavash bread: maybe I just don't like lavash, but this bread was simultaneously crispy and tough and flavorless.Baba ganoush: bizarrely sweetI also had some sort of lamb spiral with tomato sauce that was not delicious.

Prior to last night's arrival, I had hopped on Yelp to start looking for a dinner destination and Istanbul Kebab House popped up (with lots of fabulous reviews). Since moving to upstate NY, I have been somewhat deprived of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean fare (not many places to choose from). When we first arrived, the restaurant was empty, but it started to get busy shortly after we were seated. The first room downstairs is small, but after speaking with one of the folks there about other rooms and seating opportunities, there is an upstairs, rooftop area and outside seating (in the warmer weather). We started with a local cider and a house (Turkish) red wine. For an appetizer, we had the small cold sampler: grape leaves, baba ganoush, hummus, spicy \"salsa\" dip and a yogurt dip....served with a hot, freshly baked and \"puffed\" lavash (bread). I could have ordered the large version and not shared it...but I was being nice and unselfishly shared those goodies. Everything was delicious. I kept lamenting on how much I miss these wonderful flavors (even with my mouth full of baba ganoush).We decided to order the surf and turf kebobs and the ground chicken for our main courses. I don't eat a lot of meat, so I just tasted the \"turf\" - it was perfectly cooked and extremely tender. The swordfish cubes were amazing; flavor and preparation were also outstanding. The ground chicken was also a winner; as were the accompanying rice and salads. Dessert? Of course! Rice pudding was one of the best that I've ever had. Very sweet with an orange essence to it. Baklava was instant diabetes...just the way I like it. Dense pastry with plenty of honey sauce to put you into a sugar coma. Throw a Turkish coffee spiked with Bailey's on top of that and what an awesome ending to a wonderful meal.Staff was kind, friendly and accommodating. Our waiter was adorable.Go here."}, {"review_id": "eyC8Gsa7XuhwOdsBltQIiw", "user_id": "rkcU-Z-nt8Oyr8NUwuo2Mg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/19/2017", "text": "We came here while on a weekend trip to Vermont and were visiting Burlington VT one day. we found this place will good reviews and decided to give it a shot.Overall it is same Turkish food we have had in Boston many times. nothing special. WE ordered Cold appetizer plate that came with Hummus, baba ganoush, taziki and spicy veg dip (not actually spicy) and grape leaves. It came with their home made bread since i never seen any like that before.for lunch wife got falafel wrap where the falafel were very soft and under done and overall very meager wrap. They did not even have hot sauce. They just gave us tabasco. WE are spoiled with all the middle eastern and turkish places we been to having house made spicy sauces so this was disappointment. I order Chicken Andana plate which came with only one skewer of chicken and rice with tomoatoe sauce and red cabbage and onion. Even though half the price than all places here in Boston the quantity was half as well .We had the the yogurt drink and it was really good but little on the expensive side around $3 bucks and up for a small size glass. The house bread was good but also was like $2 for one whne most rest. gives out bread for free.overall it was an ok experience and might skip it next time and try something else."}, {"review_id": "9QGniQbgQwrpipsz-ElP_A", "user_id": "HPtNvEBZTZzD6XhNMSdWEA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/29/2017", "text": "We had a great first experience here for Saturday lunch.

This place was delicious. To start I had the classic hummus and lavash bread...best hummus I've had in my life! I asked for the chicken shish kebab that was warmly served with a spiced white rice and pickled onions & salad. The chicken was so moist yet perfectly charred. Definitely feels like a more fine dining kind of place minus the high prices. Baklava was perfectly sweet...having baklava in the past, most make it a bit too sweet for my liking but this one was to perfection. The Turkish coffee accompanied my Baklava...it is strong but I felt balanced well with the dessert."}, {"review_id": "tqjyuWSOCkIexx1r1E-nuA", "user_id": "AfrySJtB_LWRXIMTLM1MhA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "Yowsa! What a find!! The smell as soon as you walk in is the first clue of an outstanding meal to come. Just a delightful restaurant. Don't pay attention to off the wall comments about bathroom etc. It's all about the FOOD here!The meze platter is of course an easy pick to begin. However be careful as the entrees are not small. HIGHLY recommend the Beyti kebab which is actually lamb wrapped in the wonderful lavash bread, served with accompaniments. Or, try the lamb stuffed eggplant. Yummmm! Would EASILY return here.

Where did this place come from?? I thought I was coming to Burlington for some above average American and seafood. Then out of left field comes this amazing Turkish restaurant in downtown Burlington.Istanbul Kabab house is an authentic Turkish restaurant serving up some absolutely mouthwatering food. Came across this place on a Sunday evening and dined in what is a well done and authentically decorated restaurant. I had the swordfish kebab as well as chicken kabob. They come with a healthy serving of rice and some peppers, onions and lettuce. Absolutely unbelievable. Both kabobs were about as delicious as a dish can get. Seasoned and cooked perfectly, tender and literally melting in your mouth. The swordfish managed to maintain its seafood taste while being thoroughly cooked. The chicken was likely the bast tasting chicken  I've ever had.This is an absolute must when dining in Burlington.
