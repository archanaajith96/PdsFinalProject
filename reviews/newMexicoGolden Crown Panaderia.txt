Of the original and doz. Of the capuchino. And a doz. Of the wedding cookies. And since i had some time, had a cup of coffee and a apple empanada. Was somewhat disappointed in the coffee as it was a little bitter and strong, the shell of the empanada was tasty bit the apple filling? Well shortcuts are taken to make the filling and that hurts it. The biscochitos were good and I do recommend them. But the wedding fingers or cookies, would be soooooo much better if butter was used instead of shortening, quality could be so much better if the ingredients were tweaked a bit."}, {"review_id": "voszmM0rCx-xYGAZDdPwng", "user_id": "gFh-KwZQ7SwuOKcUVvEW3A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "The Golden Crown Panaderia has a great ambience and friendly staff.

We were greeted with a free biscochito from a friendly server. We ordered a specialty pizza, someCookies and a pumpkin empanada. We only had water to drink, $38 ouch! The green chile crust was burnt and I was expecting to taste chile but it's pretty bland. The pizza itself was ok but not anything great, it was mediocre. The biscochito cookies were very flaky and plain. The empanada was dry and basically everything we ate was just a little over cooked. 3 stars because we were anticipating checking out this cool little place we heard about but, pricey for overcooked food.

It was really unexciting. I'm not sure what all the hype is about. We were there strictly for the pan dulce. The complementary cookies, though a nice gesture-tasted like bland sand. We got a cinnamon tostada. It should have been crispy, buttery and sweet. It was flaccid and flavorless. The apple empanada was the best of the three items we recieved. But it was nothing to write home about. It was inundated with cinnamon and the pastry was a little dry. None of the pastries seemed particularly fresh. I'm glad this establishment has found their loyal fans, because they seem like really nice people. But if you're on the hunt for high quality pan dulce, I'd look elsewhere."}, {"review_id": "MroIfr8TPirFC4S2vRjqVg", "user_id": "QIy3iLXjBUBqRzwd2lnWGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/20/2017", "text": "Golden Crown Panaderia located in the old town area of Albuquerque. They have a nice patio area outside and a few tables on the inside. I arrived around 2pm and it was pretty busy. They always had a line of 5-10 people the whole time I was there. // SERVICE //The service felt a little slow at first, but it's because they really care about each person that comes in. The guy working the cashier took the time to ask me how I was doing, why I was visiting Albuquerque, what I liked about the balloon fiesta, and so on. He really made the visit feel special. I guess I'm used to the service back in California where they just ask, \"do you know what you want yet?\" // FOOD //Complimentary biscochito: I've never heard or tried this before coming here. I learned it's the state cookie of New Mexico. It's a butter based cookie with anise and cinnamon. It was pretty good and I feel like it goes well with a cup of coffee or tea. Pizza: You have the option of having your pizza made on top of a green chile dough! Do it! You don't taste it that much until you hit the crust. We chose pepperoni and minced garlic which was delicious! The pizza came out piping hot and the smell of the garlic made me fall in love! Green chile bread: Bought a whole loaf to take back to California. They offer to cut it into slices, but I decided to just keep it whole since it will last a little longer. The bread still tastes fresh a few days later. Some slices have a little kick to it. Not spicy, but just a hint of that green chile kick. I definitely recommend getting this! It's great for a sandwich and I also made an avocado toast with it. Delicious! Overall, I really enjoyed the pizza and green chile bread from Golden Crown Panaderia! I will definitely come back here the next time I'm in Albuquerque!"}, {"review_id": "eEHkoNg4NKEJ9blYjPrhyA", "user_id": "SFaME4dHUNKdtnaHiKgLZw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "This was a lucky find,  sandwiches on fresh baked and lots of meat.

And just as habit forming.The pastries and sandwiches here are superb. So are the pizzas. The coffee is lovingly and correctly brewed by an expert. The milkshake is probably the best in the area, and is made with one pound of ice cream. Get the coffee shake. Green chile bread? Yup. Order ahead at holiday time. Many of the vegetables are homegrown, and loyal customers often supply special seeds for their favorite plants. I talked with Pratt Morales, the owner, for about thirty minutes. He and his son Chris own and run the bakery. It represents a lifetime of loving work for Pratt, who lives in the house just behind the parking lot fence. Chris lives a block away. Albuquerque is fortunate to have this dedicated pair providing some of the best baked goods in town. Specialty breads are a hallmark of their artistry. Order your Green Chile Turkey Bread well in advance of Thanksgiving on Christmas. They need lead time to plan the baking schedule.I have eaten here more than two dozen times (I lost count a few years ago). My favorite has been pastrami and provolone on green chile bread. My new favorite (as of February 21m 2017) is now pastrami and provolone on a lightly toasted baguette. The slight crunchiness of the bread complements the smoothness of the meat, cheese, tomato, and red onion in a way that I can't fully describe here (for once, words fail me). This is a textural and tastiness masterpiece that you need to try. I dreamt about this creation last night. I want it again and again and again...."}, {"review_id": "7TQc6QJdwGOB9NhFLteY1Q", "user_id": "wJ-lAqXvk-bp1joQ5aqGSA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/8/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I had the opportunity to make a return visit to this joint. We are fast approaching the ladder end of the winter season here in Burque, so it wasn't quite warm enough to park our arses on the patio so inside it was! Now be warned there isn't a lot of seating to be had so you can come with a group but not a very large one. I came with a member of the work-fam as we were bout to head out west to Gallup and we were craving pizza. We had recently visited Cocina Azul and saw this place on the way out. I had mentioned the pizza to her then, I guess it must have stayed on her mind! (Mine too I must admit!)I am sure we were both looking up the menu at the same time on our desktop electronic devices. Not offering too many types of pizza, we decided to just create our own... with the following two toppings: pepperoni and garlic please! There is place to create your pizza order online. It's so easy and you can choose to pick up your pizza or dine in. First things first! The smell when you walk in is so comforting. Bread, cookes, pizza's oh my! Who doesn't like the smell of that. They make loafs and loafs and loafs of a new mexico green chile bread (which i have yet to try) and biscochitos (of which you get a free one with your order!) I mustn't forget the empanadas. They have those too. They also offer sandwiches, coffee drinks, milkshakes and even have a few local brews on tap as well. We arrived shortly after our designated pick up time of 11:00 am. Our pizza was ready and waiting! Yay! With a lot of time to spare before our mini road trip we were able to enjoy or lunch with casual convo and laughter. I will definitely order ahead online for the next visit. Totally worth it. Pizza was delish. You should know that they have their own garden for fresh herbs! You could taste the fresh oregano on the pizza...hmmmm. I'm still a fan of this place. Maybe you'll come check them out for something!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-crown-panaderia-albuquerque?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
