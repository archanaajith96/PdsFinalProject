Very tasty eggs Benedict with plenty of ham and the perfectly cooked egg. The smash breakfast potatoes with garlic are unique and delicious. Loved the thick cut bacon.Only downside is that they automatically added 20% gratuity to the bill. Not sure if that's a Seattle thin (or law) but it doesn't sit well with me. I prefer to tip based upon service and regularly tip more than 20% when we get great service  ‍"}, {"review_id": "hxO5y-FCkUMI6J6MYFxKVQ", "user_id": "usg5uPDVvgYnOqI0NjPH-Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Tasty food! A little on the pricey side, but still good.I highly recommend the garlic 'smashed' potatoes.The decor is interesting. I liked the colored chandelier over the host station, but the big barrel behind the bar had be wondering how they set the place up to begin with. I'm thinking they likely had to bring the barrel in, in pieces and assemble it as one of the first items in the customer area. :-pYou should go check the place out for yourself.Be aware, their restrooms are a tad hard to find.You have to go through like three sets of doors before you even find them, and the doors aren't very well marked (if at all)."}, {"review_id": "UL6N5e29s8N-WjDrBHi33g", "user_id": "juJS5_I5IGzMveRKNBwEVA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "We came here just for their dessert and it was phenomenal! After watching Lola featured on \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\" on the Food Network, I had to go try their made-to-order doughnuts which are more like beignets if you ask me. Located adjacent to the Andra hotel, Lola is located around the block from Pike Place Market. Street parking is possible if you're patient enough. I was skeptical about the reception we would receive when we told the hostess that we just wanted to order dessert but she was more than happy to help us out.Along with the beignets, we also got a slice of the olive oil cake. Between the two, the beignets were a home run. The vanilla mascarpone was delicious! I can't imagine NOT having the whipped mascarpone when eating any beignets now. I wasn't a fan of the seasonal jam but the vanilla mascarpone more than made up for it. The olive oil cake was good as well. It was light and the syrup complimented the cake wonderfully.I want to come back to Lola for dinner one day. After having their delicious desserts, I have high expectations for their entrees."}, {"review_id": "-RJQ13dYxlCZzlIUM8-fWw", "user_id": "ro-8C4K-3Z23hDYUK_W0UA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Beignets and Irish coffees: the only two words you need to know when coming to Lola for brunch.The beignets here are out of this world!

If you only get one thing to eat here, make it the beignets!If you want something more savory like I did, they have a fairly extensive menu, including traditional American brunch food as well as Mediterranean dishes. I got the squid kabobs - sounds weird for brunch, but it came with smashed potatoes and were divine! That green sauce is seriously out of this world good.Our party of four waited about an hour on a Sunday, but we were able to sit at the bar and enjoy Irish coffee while we waited. It's definitely not a cheap or quick brunch, but it's so worth the price and wait."}, {"review_id": "0KBbKhsExOodtfghgLlx1g", "user_id": "9g6Rh3rA5iUcxi6pGU8Q_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Wow...last day in Seattle and decided to Yelp a Greek lunch. Found one in Downtown. Trouble is, parking is at it's peak this time of day at 12:45pm. I managed to get one a block away. We arrived there on time but still had to wait little over 10 minutes. The restaurant was packed. They made us wait in the bar entrance of the room and brought us some tea. Then, they called us and escorted us to our booth. There was a young couple next to us just getting their order. Their plates looked very appetizing which made me hungry. The service was excellent, it seemed like every server that passed-by always made sure that we were okay. After placing our order, the waitress asked us if we wanted to order some sugar donuts while we wait, one of their signature items. It came with 6 fresh pieces and two different kinds of dipping sauce, seasonal jam and vanilla mascarpone.  One order was $10.00. It was so moist, soft, and flavorful.We ordered the basic Eggs Benedict. It came with their popular garlic smashed potatoes. Incredibly tasty makes you begging for more. And the Lola breakfast that also came with garlic smashed potatoes and their own homemade maple pork sausage with two eggs made your way.  It also came with two slices of toasted bread.  An incredible lunch experience on the last day of vacation.Highly recommended.

We ordered the Chocolaka bar and the Made to order doughnuts (which were the award-winning item). Both were really good but the Chocolaka bar really stood out to me. The chocolate was extremely rich and the Turkish ice cream tasted like strong coffee. Both were super tasty, but combined together, along with the pecan shortbread was heavenly. One of the best desserts I've had!The Made to order doughnuts were also really good, especially with the jam and vanilla mascarpone they gave us, but they didn't seem like anything special. I've had sugar donut bites that were just as good or better than these at much much better prices.Overall a great place, at least for dessert, but definitely on the pricier side."}, {"review_id": "58N7U0e3Fq86Q10SPXZ8-g", "user_id": "bwxW67XsDT6xNwH_RWhdpg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I haven't been to Lola for dinner in a couple of years, but I've been to both brunch and lunch about six times in the past year. Definitely make a reservation if you can, brunch on the weekend gets really busy! However, if you can't get a reservation and you are both 21+, bar seating is much less of a wait. The brunch is amazing! If you like Eggs Benedict, I think Lola's is one of the best in the city. I also love Tom's Breakfast that is essentially an octopus hash with potatoes, fennel, and bacon. I mean, c'mon. That's going to be a winner, unless of course, you don't like octopus. Then don't order it :) The smashed potatoes that come on the side of many of the brunch dishes is so delicious!

Personally, a lot of food for me, but flavors were so great that I had to finish everything on my plate. The only reason this is not a 5 star for me is because... When we arrived on a Saturday around 10:30am, we were told there was a 30min wait (not long!) for a table for 2 and were quickly told the place across the street could probably seat us right away... When we said the wait was fine, the host gave us a concerned look and awkwardly placed on the wait list. Just seemed kinda odd to encourage people to leave.

But.. there's nothing particularly special and at a heavy price tag.Started with their made to order doughnuts with jam and vanilla mascarpone (9.50$). The doughnuts were light and not super sweet.

Also got their pancakes and pork-maple sausage (15.75$), which were beautifully fluffy and airy. Surely beats any home-made mixes. The eggs benedict with bavarian ham, dill hollandaise, and smashed garlic fried potatoes (19.25$) were perfectly cooked with an oozing center that covered the ham and english muffin thickly.
