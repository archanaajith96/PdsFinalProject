Arthur Bryant's is *the* KC destination.The food here is so brilliant, they should be named Arthur Brilliant's.If it was run by Trump, it'd be Arthur Tyrant's.And if it were run by an army of insects that swing both ways, it'd be Arthur Bi-ants.Arthur Bryant's. The best BBQ on earth. Nothing compares to the taste of KC BBQ. Especially the thick, salty, hearty sauce (real Texan BBQ shies away from sauce). And KC rivals TX for perfect, tender, delicious dreamy meat. Especially the local specialty - Burnt Ends.KC has the ultimate combo of perfection in sauce and meat. It leaves Carolina in it's dust. It makes you wonder why STL is even on the map (if it still is, I haven't checked). It eclipses Memphis by a mile (or rather, 3,000 miles to Graceland). It elevates itself over the Deep South (like the Union did), and yes it even beats Texas (as Oklahoma often does) - by some distance. The #1 BBQ in KC out of many many many very good options is the legend. Arthur Bryant's.If it had a beautiful national park out back, it'd be Arthur Bryce Canyon's.If it was an informal French eatery, it'd be Arthur Brasserie.And if it was a lingerie shop, it'd be Arthur Bras-n-panties.Unlike most legends, Arthur Bryant's lives up to the hype... and surpasses it. It completely destroyed all my preconceived notions of how good BBQ can be. Between the brisket, the pulled pork, and the ultimate - their burnt ends - it's the best BBQ you may ever eat.If you have been conditioned - like many Americans - to be addicted to sugar, and you think that sugar-ketchup flavour is BBQ flavour, then don't expect to like KC BBQ, or Arthur Bryant's in particular, because sugar is not something you will taste here. OK, they make some sweet-er sauces to go with their original salty, but the meat is marinaded in the original, and rightly so. And the sweet sauces are good, unlike the syrupy dessert-esque crap at most BBQ spots.So in KC, it's salt, salt, and more salt. You're surrendering yourself to salt. Sort of like your mother did at my place last night.If they knew how good they were, they'd be Arthur Braggadaccio's.If they served Bangladeshi food, they'd be Arthur Bramaputra's.And if they were tantrum-prone former Cowboys receivers, they'd be Arthur Dez Bryant's.Yes the decor is wonderful, and the history is great. Service can be good or bad, depending on who you get (same story with most brothels and most gigolo agencies). The area is a poor area for sure, but you will be fine here even if you are one of these posh rich nervous little yelpers - and I don't hold that against you.And if you're on the run from the cops, come here, but don't go to Arthur Warrant's.And if you are eating here, make a run for it if you hear Arthur Sirens.And if it was just a fire truck that you heard, I'd hope they have a few Arthur Hydrant's outside.But the real strengths here are the taste and the food. Also a shout-out to the amazing portion sizes, and great prices. From such a legend in such a BBQ city, you don't expect cheap, enormous portions. They give you enough food to feed several people with a monstrous, delicious combo sandwich for under $10. Absolutely incredible. I'm not even into meat, or Barbeque, but when it comes to Arthur Bryant's and their original sauce, nothing compares. One of my favourite places to eat in the whole country. Do not miss it. It's better than the gimmicky-but-delicious gas station Z-man at Joe's KC. It's level with Woodyard, and it's better than Gates. And don't get me started on Jack Stack.So get here. Get this. See what BBQ is supposed to taste like.And if it served Indian rice dishes, it'd be Arthur Biryani's.And if the well-endowed Barbie comes here (as you can see, she did), it's Arthur Buoyant's. And if she's tanned (she is) it's Arthur Bronzers. And also Arthur Brazzers, but that's another story, for another day. Or night, probably.And if one of the Beach Boys, one of the Backstreet Boys, and the singer of \"Everything I Do (I Do It For BBQ)\" owns it, then it's Arthur Bryan's."}, {"review_id": "l7megi_JkEICiSm_65zsDw", "user_id": "DBMx1_LeqV_bl-G2mIg0pQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Came to Arthur Bryant's after someone recommended it and mentioned Barack Obama dined here.Was at dinner time so the line was nearly out the door and thank goodness it wasn't as it was freezing out!Took around 15 minutes to order and I ended up getting a half open-faced Burnt Ends and half Brisket. They give you plenty of food for the price but it falls short flavor-wise, especially when I compared it with the second BBQ joint I went to in KC.The Burnt Ends were tasty, but it was mainly from the sauce. The odd thing was the 3 sauces they had in the dining room each didn't match that flavor and weren't as good.The Brisket could've been good but it wasn't moist enough. I'd say the best part of the meal were the fries (especially dipping them in the burnt ends juices/sauce) and the free pickles.I'd come back again but to try something else like their Ribs."}, {"review_id": "oXZb3-JGdHY3rXPNVNHmKA", "user_id": "4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "I stopped by here two Monday mornings ago.  My wife and I were going to be in Kansas City for the day and so we decided to hit up a few of the best BBQ joints in the city.  So of course our list contained the iconic Arthur Bryant's.  We chose to head to the original on Brooklyn Avenue.  While it doesn't look like the best part of the city they had an ample sized parking lot which made you feel safe.  The inside of the place was pretty cool because it feels like it probably had never changed.  As soon as you walk in there are a number of tables strewn all about and at the far side is a line and window where you can order your que.  Along the walls are pictures of tons of famous people who had eaten there like Barack Obama.  There also was a second dining room for when it gets busy but that wasn't a problem as we made it here around 10:30 AM.For lunch on this day I decided to have a Combo sandwich consisting of pulled pork and burnt ends (it was open faced) with a side of cole slaw.  Meanwhile my wife went with a turkey sandwich herself.  We had our food almost immediately after ordering and took the trays to the table of our choice.  On each table there were three different sauces: the original, a sweet and a rich and spicy.  Throughout the meal I would try all three and I didn't exactly care for any of them.  I will say that the original had quite a peppery flavor to it which I don't know that I have ever had in a sauce before.  In any case BBQ is also about the meats and all three of the meats had a pretty good smoky flavor to them and were piled high on the sandwiches.  Both the turkey and the pulled pork were nice and tender while the burnt ends were a little tough.  Last but certainly not least was the Cole slaw which had a nice creamy sauce to it which I enjoyed.The bottom line for me is that I may come back here again in the future.  Don't get me wrong, I am very glad to have tried Arthur Bryant's and while some of the meats were good, neither the sauce nor the burnt ends impressed me and I think that there is better BBQ to be had in KC."}, {"review_id": "FWuo0kXzxX3MJv-89kRNIg", "user_id": "RWbg6aiN-DEHNOr2tSv4BA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "I can honestly say if I had one last meal it would be a brisket sandwich absolutely swimming in AB original sauce.  Yes it is that good.... to me! I can totally understand why people are disappointed by Bryants. The staff can be rude at times, and the quality can be spotty at time as.  These issues were never problems when King Arthur was still overseeing the operation.  Unfortunately, the product has suffered slightly.  It is still elite, which is testament to how good this place was and frankly still is 80% of the time.The problem is people order the wrong things. Yes AB's is the birthplace of burnt ends, but the current menu item is a JOKE!  People stop ordering the burnt ends from Bryants! They are smothered in there rich and spicy sauce and they taste like roast (go to Q39, Joe's, or Slaps).  AB's is all about the sandwiches.  Brisket being the king, but they are all top notch. Heck order a combo sandwich of any variety and you are gold!  Perfectly, historically smoked magic! Also don't miss the fries, they might be the best in the city (sorry Joe's). As for the sauce the original is an acquired taste, but once acquired it is irresistible (life changing)..... So suck it up and try it 3-70 times, until you see stars. As for the other sauces on the table I guess they are ok, but Arthur would not permit there use."}, {"review_id": "YFNwM7ZwLsQntrstHpfVYw", "user_id": "QTeq4wLhXlN4Dr0obpLnbQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "A lot of fellow Yelpers criticize the ribs to be rather dried out.This can be true, but lest you forget this is a place that prides itself on a fine, almost unmatchable bbq sauce.It begs to be doused in it!And although there are three sauces to choose from: original, spicy, bbq sauce, you're gonna want to stick with the oranged sweet and spicy bbq sauce.It's finger licking good, and a to-go bottle is available for purchase and goes well with just about anything."}, {"review_id": "CjesmOzSfs7UNZbouXWavg", "user_id": "fCKSORyrBOrq3QFXFXr7lg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Mmmm.

Everyone was pointing to sliced sausage, which was actually pretty unique - it was sliced thinly long ways deli-style, which made for a pretty enjoyable sandwich.
