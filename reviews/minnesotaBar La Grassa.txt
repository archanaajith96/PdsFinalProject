First off I think the three dollar sign rating is a bit on the high side, considering the sizes of the portions and the ability to get half/full orders it's incredibly affordable for a more upscale Italian place. We got the red wine spaghetti, fettuccine, and the gnocchi with orange all for less than thirty bucks. Three half portions was way more than enough for two people. The most tender and well cooked gnocchi I've ever had, and the red wine spaghetti had such a rich flavor that combined with the crunch of the pine nuts made it more unique than any spaghetti dish I've ever had. The cheese plate was wonderful but the star of it is the cheesy home made crisps that come with it. My wife described them as fancy cheez-its, which is a high compliment, they were so fantastic. So often you just get crackers or dry bread with a cheese plate but these really stood out. The salted caramel crepelle is the best dessert option, you will not be disappointed with those, just incredible. Service was great, it was fairly busy but they stayed on top of everything and were very nice. Will absolutely be coming back."}, {"review_id": "Yg5K9ZHh4noF0FuDINz-aw", "user_id": "ZKr4YuXdzq41sVk-_29k-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Wow. This place really has some unique food. I came here with a group on a mission to try the orange, cauliflower gnocchi dish. Two of the three of us ordered it without much hesitation because it's what we came for. But first, parking is going to be on the street. You can pay for a valet I believe, but we found a meter spot pretty quickly. I think it'll depend on the night. Second, the service was great. All night we ate at the pasta bar and we were well taken care of by our server and others. Plus the manager (or someone, I forget) came around and was checking on all the tables. Now, the food, the gnocchi did not disappoint. The flavor was really rich and had a lot going on. It was great. I'm eager to go back and try more."}, {"review_id": "Jkn2-LZpbrvWFQK6EVZJmA", "user_id": "Oyp6iL6GVwtmV5MoAb6rnw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Fantastic. I can't say enough great things about this place. I've been here for a 6pm reservation and a 10pm reservation and both times the restaurant has been packed, and for good reason. The wait staff is wonderful. They are so friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. They're great at answering questions since it's not exactly clear as to what some of the dishes are (if you're not super familiar with types of pastas and sauces). They're also great at making suggestions on the cocktail menu too. I've had the Valentine and Bellini and both were great. First and foremost, they bring out a cute, complimentary bean feast and two types of bread. Both are great starters. As far as appetizers go, I've tried the beets and burrata plate and that was delicious. The plate is filled with colorful pink beets and blackberries and then covered with burrata and topped with pistachios. It may seem like an odd combo, but it was really good. As someone who doesn't go out of their way to buy beets or order them at a restaurant, I really enjoyed it. I've also had the ricotta and tomato bruschetta. I HIGHLY recommend that. It comes as a large piece of bread covered in tomatoes and topped with ricotta and is then sliced in half. I'd say it's the perfect size for two people, but if you have more in your party, consider ordering another. I was really interested in trying the goat cheese bruschetta as well, but the others in my party were not a fan of goat cheese. However, now that I've had the tomato and ricotta one, it'll be hard to deviate from that. Pasta is served in half portions or whole portions. As a person who feels like a bottomless pit and is always hungry, I'm more than satisfied with a half order. If you and your party members are planning on getting your own dishes, id say that a half order is more than enough. I'd consider ordering whole orders of pasta if it was a larger group and everyone was planning on sharing/serving it family style. Most of their pasta dishes have homemade noodles--so awesome!! A friend had recommended the fettuccine to me and it is by far the best fettuccine I have ever tasted. I wouldn't say I love white sauce and I definitely have to be in the right mood for it, but I find myself randomly craving their fettuccine--it's that good. I have also had the carbonara which was rich and full of flavor. I've haven't been able to finish my half order of pasta either of the times I've gone, but it heats up perfectly for leftovers later the night or the next day. I feel like you can't go wrong with any of the pasta dishes. I usually end up finding one or two things I like at restaurants and stick to what I know is good and hardly change up what I order. But they won't be the case at Bar La Grassa. I can't wait to come back and try more pasta dishes. Everything that comes out of the kitchen looks so good!!! I also heard that they own/manage 112 Eatery and Burch. I haven't been to either but definitely need to try it after two wonderful experiences at this place. Bar La Grassa--you have my business for life!"}, {"review_id": "M7VPS0pP_yu5gYI-NdUfQQ", "user_id": "FE3as3usyraZEK5vLzNPAw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "This has been on my \"bookmark\" list for quite some time... So many of friends have raved about this Italian restaurant and they had really set the bar high. I was almost afraid of being disappointed, but way to go BLG, you really live up to high expectations.  Not only was the food great, the service was unbelievable.A friend and I were celebrating my birthday and when deciding where to go she mentioned how great the bread was at BLG.... She didn't' have to say another thing. I LOVE CARBS! To balance out the carbs and help with digestion we ordered a salad, I don't think I have had a better César salad.  The croutons were amazing. For the main course we split the crab ravioli and the Foie Gras Tortellini absolute divine! I'm talking melt in your mouth, don't talk to me, I want left overs but it's so good you eat the whole thing!Now I don't want to forget to mention the drinks. They have a full bar and although I typically drink wine with Italian dishes, I was in the mood for a dirty martini (and let's just say I may have ordered a second). My friend ordered the spicy margarita, it did come out a little too hot the first time, but they were more than happy to accommodate the drink to a more subtle spice level for her.The staff did an outstanding job keeping us happy and informing us, but they were also very entertaining! Most of the servers we spoke to have been working there for 10+ years.

I've had $80 meals here as well as $25 meals. It looks indulgent but doesn't have to be. The atmosphere is a little fancy but cute. Parking is difficult at best so plan ahead.The food: Seared scallops are very tender and flakey. For bruschetta: I love the ricotta and roasted tomato the best. The soft eggs and lobster are also good but lacking texture. Onion and goat cheese are delicious! For pasta, they have three kinds: dry, fresh, and filled. Dry: I like the red wine spaghetti although it was dry one time I ordered it. Bucatini w/ bonognese is good but simple. Fresh: pappardelle with veal ragu is my favorite; gnocchi with cauliflower and orange is also pretty tasty. Filled: I've tried the crab ravioli and it is okay. Main: I had the best seabass filet of my life here; it was $40 for just the filet but honestly I still remember how the fish melted in my mouth. Branzino is also very delicious although a little fishy for my taste. I've hat rabbit which I believe is seasonal because I no longer see it on the menu; it's quite tender and delicious but I need to forget it's rabbit!

Talk about overindulgence. If I were rating our dining experiences separately, the first one would be an off the charts 5 and the second one would have been a 2. It's a shame really. We were so blown away the first time that we had really high expectations the second time, and I am sad they weren't met. But I am still giving this a 4 overall rating because the one thing I know is that the food here is amazing. 4 stars for amazing food. Period.So let's see. Bar La Grassa is trendy and big. It's Italian without being in your face Italian like Olive Garden. It's more upscale with a hint of Italian. The first time we ate here, we had a party of six and were tucked away in a nice corner at a round table. The second time it was just me and my husband, and we were right in the main dining room at a two-top that was too close to the neighboring tables. I was severely disappointed that the place was so loud that it was hard for us to talk to each other and to avoid eavesdropping on our neighbors. I hate restaurants that are like that, and I was surprised that the volume in the main dining room was so high.Obviously being an Italian place, the wine list is stronger than the beer list and there is a full bar. But we did find the beer list to be OK to better than average, but nothing to write home about. I went with an old standard, Castle Danger Cream Ale, which was fine.Food-wise, we loved several things. The bread basket is fresh baked, and it is seriously everything you can do to not say \"yes\" when they ask you if you want more bread. The egg ravioli blew my mind. Absolutely spot on perfect egg yolk ravioli, which is amazing if you are a fan of an oozy runny egg yolk. Just enough spice without being distracting. Delicious. The langostine crudo appetizer is ridiculous. We loved the scallop appetizer (though it was a bit pricey imho for two scallops, even though they were great). The papparadelle with bolongase was mind blowing amazing. The beech mushrooms side was tremendous if you like wild mushrooms - get it. Covered in butter and fried till crispy, it was an amazing side. The gnocchi are fabulous, soft, pillowy and slightly sweet due to the sauce. The cheesecake was lovely and unique (more like flan) as a dessert.A note on portions: many dishes have a half and full size listed. On appetizers go full, on the egg ravioli, go full (that's two big raviolis). But for everything else, half is more than adequate. We even got three half portions to split, which worked perfectly.So where did we go wrong with our second two-star visit? Largely, the answer comes with one dish: the calamaratta with raw tuna. These are big wide O-shaped noodles that look kind of like calamari in shape, covered in a red sauce and covered with a pile of small cubes of raw tuna. It's like poke meets pasta but a little less Asian. If you love sashimi or sushi, you will dig this dish. The first time we visited, this dish blew our minds. We could not wait to have it again when we returned. The second time we had this dish, the tuna was fine but the red sauce coating the noodles was extremely spicy. Like blow the roof off your mouth, burn your tongue, ruin the taste of everything else you eat for the next 15 minutes hot. I ate two noodles before we decided to mention it to our server. My husband can handle more heat than I can, so we did not send it back outright, but the dish was completely inedible from my point of view. Our waiter immediately apologized, gave us an explanation that boiled down to \"the peppers they use can vary in spiciness, sorry about that\" and offered to have the kitchen make me something else on the fly. I took him up on it, but by the time the replacement dish arrived, I was really full and not in the mood to eat more. Essentially the entire timing of our meal was off.To the restaurant's credit, the incident made its way to the manager, and she came over to talk with us. She took the dish off the bill, which I did appreciate. But she gave us the same story about the peppers being variable in spice level. OK, that's fine, and I do agree that peppers vary in their level of heat. But shouldn't your kitchen be tasting before they send a dish out? That was uncomfortably hot. In my opinion, that dish should never have been served, and the kitchen should have caught it before it ever went out to a paying customer. Especially having tasted the non-spicy version of the dish, I can say that when the spice is in check, it's delicious. But when the spice is THAT spicy, all you taste is spice. I teeter on saying it ruined our meal, but it was close.In addition, while our service the first time was absolutely stellar in every way, our service the second time around was just OK. I guess I'll look forward to our next visit, which will break the tie."}, {"review_id": "EAkuSeM24O_WWaUjsL2mcw", "user_id": "z5zk8fwVPOnfnoFkdQbYWw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "According to our Uber driver, Bar La Grassa is the must-go restaurant if you're in Minneapolis.

We shared the following:-Soft eggs & lobster bruschetta ($20): Plenty of lobster, creamy eggs, and toasty bread. Delicious! -a half portion of the Calamarata w/ raw tuna ($20): Interesting combination. I've never had anything like this before and as strange it sounds, it works really well. Perfectly cooked pasta and fresh tuna in a creamy, slightly spicy sauce. -a half portion of the smoked spaghetti alla chitarra w/ brown butter & lobster ($19): The flavors were good but way too salty. -New York strip ($38): We ordered this medium rare and it came out very chewy. I would skip this altogether. The highlights of the night were the bruschetta and the calamarata pasta. Both were tasty and decadent. For half sizes, the pasta was pretty filling as the pasta itself was very dense and hearty. Overall, we had a nice dinner at Bar La Grassa. It definitely met expectations, but the overly salty spaghetti and tough New York strip was disappointing.

The Mushroom and Taleggio Agnolotti and the Pappardelle with Veal Ragu were so very scrumptious. The taleggio cheese and mushroom filling in the agnolotti was purely divine. Agnolotti is much like ravioli except ravioli seems to have a more pasta to filling ratio whereas agnolotti is the reverse. That means even more cheese filling in the agnolotti :) Also, to complement the softness of the agnolotti, sauteed shallots and additional mushrooms are added to add a layer of crispiness. As for the veal pappardelle, the simplicity of the flavors along with the perfectly cooked pappardelle combined for an amazing dish. The pappardelle had just the right amount of thickness and the ragu complemented the veal very well. The veal didn't come out very strongly since the ragu hid some of the veal flavor but that is just the way I liked it.
