I have had soooooo many great things about Revival. It was basically everywhere, from my friends talking about it non-stop, to Facebook videos, and even seeing it on the tv. So, you know I had to give this place a try.Located in South Minneapolis on a corner, it can be hard to find. It is on a main road and offers street parking. This restaurant is small and cozy. You must get there to beat the rush or else you will be waiting awhile for a table. I did notice a lot of people ordered for pick up and through Bite Squad. Its nice to know that is an option as well.As soon as I walked in I was greeted by a young man. He was all smiles and it felt welcoming. The MN nice feel, if you know what I mean. I had a party of 6, celebrating my brother's birthday. It was a 45-minute wait. We came on a Sunday around 4pm. This place was already full but totally worth the 45-minute wait. They offered us a menu to look at and said the bar is open for beer and wine if we wanted. Let's get to the good stuff, the FOOD!!! Here is a list of what was ordered and how I felt about it.FRIED CHICKEN LIVERWS, PEA TENDRILS, & TEXAS TOAST $9: I am not a liver fan at all, but hey why not try new things right? When the dish came out, it looked amazing! Anything deep fried will win me over. I am sorry to say, I didn't like it. I don't like liver. The flavor of the batter was delicious, but the liver itself was not for me. I thought it was dry and chalky. Overall flavor was good on the batter it was dipped in.DRY RUBBED WINTS $12: These wings were AMAZING! The dry rub was sooooooo good. The chicken was cooked perfectly. Nice and juicy.  It came with a side of ranch. It got me excited for the meal I ordered. If the wings were this amazing I knew the Southern Fried Tennessee Hot was going to be out of this world.SOUTHERN FRIED TENNESSE HOT CHICKEN 2PC $9: Hands down one of the BEST fried chicken I have ever had. It is in competition with Roscoe's Chicken. The spice level on this chicken was just right. Tons of flavor, the batter on the chicken was nice and crispy. The chicken itself was super juicy. My mouth is watering as I am typing. It came with a thigh and a drum. I ate all of it down to the bone. Every bite I took left my mouth jumping with joy. I would recommend ordering the whole bird in the Tennessee hot just, so you can have left overs. Trust me, you will want more as soon as you get home.Onto the sides, they are single serve. I would recommend each person order their own. I ordered a few to try.MAC + CHEESE $6: I will have to say this was OK. It was very cheesy and creamy which I liked, but I have had better mac. Now if it were a baked Mac it would have made it to the top of the list for me. This mac was not salty at all which I liked. To me there nothing exciting about it. I will say besides the liver, this was the other entrée I had to box up to take home.WHITE CHEDDAR GRITS $6: There was nothing too exciting or special to the grits. I like how they added cheddar. I did find myself adding more salt to it. It was kind of bland for my palette. COLLARD GREENS $5: This was my FAVORITE side dish. It was cooked just right, and the flavor was on point. I like how there was a touch of sweetness to each bite. It went well with the fried chicken. CHEDDAR DROP BISCUITS $6: MOVE OVER Red Lobster biscuits! These are number 1 on my list of biscuits. It was buttery, soft, cheddary (I don't think that's a real word) and burst of flavor. It was super moist. I could seriously eat these biscuits as a snack and with every meal. They were so warm and fluffy. This is a MUST get.Yelp Fam, I hope my review has helped you out, if not I apologize. I would recommend giving this restaurant a try. The wait is worth it!"}, {"review_id": "EX34cz05rgERdBkWG6BPDg", "user_id": "sCkvMT7SD3EbK-4hbd84mw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Everyone raves about Revival's fried chicken -- even Southerners. On our visit we found the Tennessee fried chicken to be spicy, juicy and crispy. The chicken and waffle entrée was delicious and filling. Most dishes are served ala carte with a choice of interesting sides. The wait staff is friendly. The kitchen has the routine down pat and delivers your food in short order.Would I go again? I'm not so sure.My ambivalence has to do more with the environment and atmosphere than the food. The Minneapolis Revival is small. The front door opens directly into the restaurant, which in the winter can be unpleasant. The tables are tiny and jammed together. There is almost always a line and there is no place to wait for a table other than hovering over those seated. And they know you're eyeballing them.So, before I return I will weigh the experience eating really good Southern fried chicken against the environment Revival requires its customers to endure. With so many other choices that offer good food and a good dining experience, as of this writing the scales are tipped to not returning."}, {"review_id": "Kpu99pg4qd6pqITEalop8A", "user_id": "FH-C7kJIBWBVE1Ekc4HAUg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Service incredible - thank for such a warm welcome.

This place definitely lives up to the hype! Easily the best fried chicken I've ever had, and the best fried chicken in Minneapolis. The Tennessee Hot made my nose run, but in a very good way! The cheddar drop biscuits are deliciously cheesy and have a lovely texture to them. Also, the mac and cheese is just oozing with sumptuous cheese, and tastes even better when reheated at home later as the cheese is given a chance to thicken up a bit.

I don't normally ask the names of the staff, but the experience was so great I had to. The hostess, Alison was gracious when we entered and quick to ensure to get the names and number of your party. She was on top of getting people seated in a timely manner. Not a simple feat since the place is small and usually packed. Our server, Liz was amazing! She was so sweet and offered wonderful recommendations. She truly made it a memorable experience. Jeb politely bused our tables right away. You can tell the staffs happy attitude rubbed off on the diners. Each plate showcases the chef's ability to combine bold personality and the best of the seasons with their perspective on Southern traditions. I'm always smitten with the house sauces. Forgetting the packed flavor and heat that comes with the ghost pepper sauce... yet I'm always wanting more with each heavy breathing bite. Although I tend to be too full by the end of the meal to even think of dessert, but I'm glad there was room left to try the butterscotch pie. Oh my goodness that pie, just wow! It's not overly sweet leaving no regret when indulging."}, {"review_id": "Sp6vqjRlKzS9CNLo8RRdvQ", "user_id": "77n6qFDNlWkWMp2M3X_Vng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Definitely, THE place to go to if you're looking for some amazing Southern comfort food.  The hype for their fried chicken is real folks, and let's not ignore the incredible sides and apps as well.  We got the whole bird southern fried style, chicken and waffles sandwich, the burger, and brussel sprouts with the mac and cheese and mashed potatoes as sides and this was a feast of epically delicious proportions for us four.  It is hard to choose favorites, but if you're looking for something besides the chicken, GET THE BURGER with a side of MAC AND CHEESE.  Take advantage of the Nowait app if you want to keep your hangryness at bay.  Looks like they are on there now, so you can check what the current wait is and put your name on the waitlist.  Super convenient!"}, {"review_id": "BHbsUYOuPy8DtNMiK0WIeA", "user_id": "wRB4ydleVCuCHDS8kIIkNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/17/2017", "text": "Revival is a unique, fun, and delicious local restaurant. The perfect place to have the honor of my 100th yelp review (yay!). I've been hearing about Revival for awhile and I'm so glad I finally made the stop.  Service was fast and friendly. Our waitress was happy to answer all our questions and had plenty of recommendations for us. My husband and I tried the Revival Double Burger and the Chicken and Waffle Breakfast sandwich. Revival knows how to do fried chicken!! It was so crisp and juicy and you can even pick your level of spice. The breakfast sandwich was beautiful and just as equally tasty with wonderful combinations of sweet and salty flavors. The burger was also great and left me craving another one for dinner. Each entree came with a choice of a side from a long list of amazing southern themed bites. We had the hush puppies and cheddar biscuit and they did not disappoint. My only regret is not trying the Mac N Cheese which I awkwardly stared at and envied each time a neighboring table had a bowl of it placed on their table.

Parking was on street parking and lock your car. Revival is on the NE corner of the intersection, the signage doesn't pop, so look closely. This is a small restaurant and it is tight with fairly long wait times but no one seemed to care and everyone was smiling and having a good time. We came just after lunch time on a Sunday and the place had a wait for the entire time we were there. Watching the food go by as people were served made your tummy rumble. Everything looked delicious. They have a hostess with an I-pad that watches the door and knows the order that you came in, greeted you and put you on a digital waiting list that texts you when your table is nearly ready. It works well.We were seated. The menu is simple and plain. It could use a face-lift. Some things I didn't know what they were so a description would be nice. It seemed like most sides were $6. We got the sides of Mac and Cheese, Mashed Potatoes and Biscuits. They were all $6 each. The Mac and Cheese ruled supreme,it was the best side, a must get. The potatoes were good with a white gravy on them. The $6 biscuits comes with only 2 biscuits, they are cheesy biscuits which are good but not the best value. We got the sides to go with the star of the show, the Southern Fried Chicken, we got the whole bird, 10 pieces because they split each breast. They brought out 2 sauces. We were told that the dark sauce was good in the Mac and Cheese and the other sauce was good on the Chicken, and they were. I paired with a glass of wine that they say was brought here because of the great pairing with the Chicken. It is a bubbly white wine that was light and crisp. It was $10 and my photo of my wine shows you how much that you get. The wine is called Jazzy Belle, you don't get much for $10. They had a clear liquid on the table with some tiny peppers that resemble green beans, not sure what you use it on but it was a nice spicy sauce. I asked and they called it Asian Pepper Sauce. They also have dessert but we were stuffed. Our waiter kinda crashed and burned at the end where he kept ignoring us and not bringing the bill. I waited patiently for a while and then got the attention of another server to ask our guy to come back with the bill and a box for the rest of the chicken. No way we are leaving any of that chicken behind. It was so crisp, crunchy and juicy. I heard the sauces were made to go well with the chicken crust to not make the chicken soggy at all. Fantastic food. We are already talking about what we will try the next time. Everyone at my table gives 2 thumbs up for the chicken and Mac and cheese. Both were superb. Maybe I will see you there."}, {"review_id": "R8_nCYTnbK1TyxxhvyTuOQ", "user_id": "s4aGMZjvDSzHJQm6Y16b4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/16/2017", "text": "The hype is real, people! Believe it.The male companion requested this for his birthday dinner, so we showed up around 7:30pm on a Wednesday night. Note that neither location takes reservations. We had been warned that the wait would be super long, but it ended up only being 15 minutes! Hostess waiting at the front door to check us in was pleasant. We were going to go grab a drink nearby but there isn't much around it. We got a drink from the bar conveniently near the waiting space and facing the crowd of people dying to eat. Bartender was a sassafras and was pretty rude with us, so that wasn't an ideal start to the evening from a service perspective. But the rest of our experience was good enough to earn it the 5/5.Now for food. I was dying to try the pork rinds, hot cheetos style with cheese sauce, but that sounded too weird to the boyf. Instead, we decided to both get chicken and then share a smattering of sides.I was SO PUMPED to come here when I found out they have gluten free fried chicken. This is the ONLY place I've ever heard of that does this! Dream come true. I got the GF 2 piece chicken, and the man got tennessee hot white meat 2 piece. If I had to do it again, I would have upgraded to the white meat too. Less boney and less skin/fat, and honestly was bigger portion. He really liked the tennessee hot flavor and both of our chicken was the perfect amount of crispy and crunch and perfectly prepared. But let me tell ya about their SAUCES.They have three sauces that are table staples. Two were a vinegar base, one of which was spicy with a great kick. The waiter recommended the vinegar on the mac and cheese, and we can confirm that it was delicious that way. However, the 3rd sauce was the clear winner and master. We asked what it was called, and our waiter said it was \"Sweet Potato Habanero\" and Oh. My. Lort. It was like cinnamon and spice and nutmeg and pepper and everything nice. One of the best complex flavors sauce I've ever had. We doused our chicken in it. They need to sell this stuff in bulk.The sides, the sides, oh which to pick! We went with mac and cheese, white cheddar grits, red slaw, and green beans. Mac and cheese was unreal--amazing cheesey flavor unlike any other cheese I've had, crumbs on top for a crispy finish, and warm gooeyness melts in your mouth. Their grits were amazing--I'm obsessed with cheddar grits so not hard to please, but they were great. Red slaw was underwhelming--would skip when we come here again. Green beans were perfect amount of crunch and fatty/cooked in butter with bacon bits!We got out of here after two drinks, two chicken meals, and four sides under $50. This is an amazing spot for a good price and awesome southern comfort food!"}, {"review_id": "mOKerMDPCuFtMv4IkcXpYQ", "user_id": "TbaIQ1stfmIPaDyBxD_KPA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "I think their food is great overall, though some of it is a bit overpriced in my opinion. The fried chicken and sides are all very flavorful and taste fresh, and I personally have no complaints there.My only two criticisms are as follows:1) They have limited seating, do not take reservations, and several times (in my experience) have not picked up the phone when calling to determine a wait. I understand they're popular and can get away with placing the onus of waiting/scheduling on their customers, but it's frustrating when they can't even pick up their phone to let you know what the wait will be.2) You cannot call ahead to order/pick up. They make you do it in person and then wait in a tiny area overflowing with people while you impede everyone else from trying to enter the establishment. Doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me and seems like it should be something they reconsider.Overall, I enjoy the food, but I avoid the place for the most part because the food isn't *that good* that it's worth the hassles of standing around in a 2x2 foot section with 20 other people waiting for a spot."}, {"review_id": "bGGKxCpY1rxRdzpq8AbKTQ", "user_id": "WiNGocx8elQVb_3RYQmoZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "There are no words that can accurately describe how spectacular Revival is and how in love the food will make you feel after eating here. With each visit I become more and more addicted and there's no going back.The food is, of course, the complete star of the show. Whether you get the chicken or decide for the burger, you will not be disappointed. The Southern Fried chicken is the phenomenon that started it all. It's fried to an absolute perfection; the crispy, crunchy crust surrounding the juicy, soft meat, explodes with flavor as you bite into it. It's everything a good fried chicken should be and so much more. You won't want to wait to take another bite. Recently we've tried the Tennessee Hot which I've been avoiding since I'm a huge sissy when it comes to spicy foods and as I feared, it was spicy as hell, yet still delicious somehow. If you're not as weak as I am, you'd love it.Now the burger! My GOD!! You might have heard claims such as \"it's the best burger in Twin Cities\". Those would be totally correct. No exaggeration here, just a really deliciously juicy perfection. It's like biting into a cheesy, perfectly seasoned dream. Now you can choose how many patties you'd like on your burger with one, two, and three being the options. Choose THREE! Do it! It's a complete foodgasm in a bun; all the cheesy goodness, charred patties, bread & butter pickles, and the flavorful sauce...a masterpiece of a burger you will actually keep thinking about weeks after. If you opt for the original two patties then I suppose that's alright, the burger will still be out of this world and you might have more room left for the magical mac and cheese. If you opt for just one patty then we cannot be friends and I don't trust you as a human being.I could spend all day writing about how delicious every single item at Revival is. You cannot go wrong no matter what. The highlights are the previously mentioned mac and cheese which is pretty much a pot of yummy, bubbly hot gold. Saying it's the best mac and cheese I've ever had in restaurant is an understatement. The appetizer of dry rubbed wings is also excellent, brings a great portion to share with the table, and is a perfect start to your meal if you want some chicken on top of your fried chicken later [because enough is not enough at Revival]. Recently we've deteriorated from the classics and tried the Chicken & Waffle Breakfast Sandwich during brunch and it completely exceeded expectations. The waffle was soft and ideally complimented the crunchy chicken topped with the most savory gravy and sunny side up egg.As far as the sandwiches go, the chicken thigh sandwich is probably, again, the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. It's just superb! Revival doesn't take reservations and you better count on the fact that there will most likely be a wait for a table no matter when you decide to show up. It's just that popular and absolutely worth the wait, too! Don't get discouraged by the small space either. I remember I hated how close together the tables are to each other on my first visit but then I took a bite of the food and all worries and issues disappeared into thin air. The tiny space definitely does make it cozy and adds to the homey feel of the place. The interior is colorful and has almost a 60s vibe with the contrasting light wood floor and dark wood tables complimented by the mustard yellow walls with flowers. The staff is just as welcoming and warm as the restaurant itself. The service has always been excellent and top notch and it's just an overall pleasure to dine here. Revival prides itself on my list of Top 10 restaurants in the cities and honestly, it's probably never going to NOT be on that list. It's just such a special experience here, so different from anywhere else I've been. Go see for yourself. The food is fantastic and you will find yourself actually craving more.
