Therefore, I will only speak to the Korean food. If you wish to hear one lone opinion on the state of sushi in RI, read the disclaimer below. Otherwise....Kalbi, kalbi, kalbi, kalbi, kalbi, kalbi, kalbi, kalbi, kalbi, kalbi, kalbi, kalbi, kalbi, kalbi, kalbi, kalbi, kalbi, kalbi, kalbi, kalbi, kalbi, kalbi, kalbi tang.Also, everything else Korean on the menu. It is SOOO GOOOOOOOD. I love the sauces and how all the sauces are different according to the meat! That's how it should be! When it's cold I dream of kalbi tang. When there's a Nor'easter, I even daydream of kalbi tang melting all the snow off my driveway so I don't need to shovel. But the problem is I love Ichiban's kalbi tang so much, I'd probably be tempted to pick up the now-frozen kalbi tang, suck on the dirty meat popsicles and get brain freeze/lasting neurological effects from the gasoline/oil residue from my driveway. Ichiban's kalbi tang is THAT dangerous.Yum, I love Ichiban.DISCLAIMER: I normally look at a restaurant for all its offerings as a whole, but I have extremely picky standards for sushi. Frankly, the sushi here is American-style sushi and falls in the \"good for Rhode Island\" category for me. BUT. The good news is, you're in Rhode Island! And Rhode Island is in the USA! Meaning, the USA is not Japan! So get used to avocado and cream cheese in the rolls! (I'll never EVER get used to it though. SIGH. American sushi blows. There, I said it. It's one of my pet peeves about Rhode Island....we have amazing, world-quality fish but not even close to the level of skill that even a middle-of-the-road sushi spot has in Japan. It is SO SAD. Even Boston only has 2 spots that I'll eat sushi at and those places will take all your money). I still love Ichiban tho. GO KALBI (this place still needs a major remodel tho)."}, {"review_id": "lWj7MeSfh0UwOMolc9qZ2g", "user_id": "ESB7qFMrrTBAn8iqUCk4Mg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/7/2017", "text": "I'm in love! It's loud, it's packed, the kimchi is stinky and the sushi is coming out constantly. Always a good sign when the raw fish moves fast. Friendly wait staff a good set of complimentary apps is where it begins. This place is fast paced and ready for a crowd. While that's normally not my speed this place has charmed me with everything thats going on.

It was one of the first sushi restaurants that opened up in town and it was actually the first place I tried sushi in! The service was always good and the owners are friendly. They make sure to swing by each table and ask how the patrons were doing. They serve Korean and Japanese food. They also have a full bar and serve delicious mixed cocktails. The restaurant was beautifully decorated and there's a parking lot right outside; there's also on-street parking.I've tried most of their sushi rolls and I'm never disappointed. I also love their bulgogi and their bibimbap. We always order steamed shumai or squid salad as an appetizer. The squid salad was so flavorful and complex. The most recent dish I ordered and I really liked was the unagi(eel) over rice. I really love their food and service; it's definitely one of the best sushi spots in Rhode Island."}, {"review_id": "szQqkFLzY7WpXDMLDaWTsQ", "user_id": "NR1vlQ8eiey95nv6Y-xt1Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "I was not a big fan of the complimentary plate, except for the cole slaw.

I've been here once before on Valentine's day and returned here once again for some Japanese cuisine. The thing that stands out the most is the service. Everyone is so accommodating and friendly. From the moment you walk in you are suited quickly and given complimentary kimchi and a few other small things to munch on. From there the wait staff gets you set up with food and drink in a timely manner. The food selection here is enormous. A mix of Japanese, Korean, and other types of food from curry to udon to sushi. Oh god the sushi is delicious. Some of the best I've ever had.

It's located not exactly in the center of Cranston, good amounts of parking available. It doesn't seem like an upscale place or a chain restaurant or a hibachi kind of place, instead it looks like a family owned joint.Everyone is super friendly and do their best to make sure your food is good. Got the scorpion bowl which was pretty good, asked them to not make it sweet; we were maybe expecting a slightly bigger bowl but good nonetheless.Coming to the main part, their food is amazing. Got the dragon roll which was absolutely delicious and looked great too. Also got the pork bulgogi, slightly spicy but very nicely done. Lastly the dumpling soup was the best of them all, the winter weather might have made it taste better but the food was really good.Overall, def 4.5 stars, im definitely coming back here, only 10 min away. Small things that could maybe be improved are the complementary initial side dishes; some of them just didn't taste that fresh."}, {"review_id": "SjvQfPcnCgQqLKn25eNkGw", "user_id": "dFmhhPD54fbzSqL8QoraAQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "Great sushi and very personable staff! I go here regularly and just ordered takeout (sushi) last night. The girl who took my order over the phone and helped me when I picked it up was so pleasant. The sushi was fresh and delicious as always. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I'm really not a fan of eating in here/the dining area. It's a little sticky/dingy and not the most comfortable. I wouldn't let it deter me if I was on the go and needed to eat in, but I hope they see this review and spruce things up a bit!

I've ordered Jambong, and a hoe dup bap which are seafood hot noodle and a sushi bowl. Jambong was not too spicy, and has a flame flavor and balanced well. Hoe dup bap was not special, but there was no point to claim. Something special of hoe.dup bap here was there were a lot of thinly sliced radish and the similar veges which was good.

They've always been consistent with their service and food quality. For my appetizers I had the soft shell crab tempura, beef negimaki, and sticky chicken wings. The soft shell crab wasn't very flavorful. It must have been because it was out of season. Their tempura crust was nicely crisp with a subtle sweetness. The beef negimaki had a sweet and savory flavor combination. I especially like the fresh green onion on the inside. The beef was dry however and certainly could have been cooked a little less. The sticky wings had a pretty basic sauce but it was nicely cooked and was moist. Their house dressing is delicious but they kind of went overboard with it on my salad. It looked like my salad drowned in orange goop. For dinner I had the remaining dishes named above. They have a very good quality sushi rice and it's very well executed. It's probably the best of rhode island. They also always have very fresh fish. As far as ingredient quality, they get an A+. The maki combo # 3 is obviously for the not so adventurous. We also had the lobster roll which was sadly very disappointing. It was very bland and the lobster was completely lost. Though they can be a little more exciting with their sushi, the quality of the fish speaks for itself. I especially LOVE their fried rice. If you're someone like me, who hates the \"generic,\" overly Americanized version of fried rice then you will absolutely love Ichiban's fried rice. It is definitely a must try item. Their yakisoba is also a must try. They have very good noodles and it's never overcooked. Be careful with asking for extra spicy however. You'll burn a hole right through your stomach. The last item I had was the tofu kimchi jeyook bokum. It's basically like a saucy stir fry of kimchi, various vegetables, pork and 4 large cubes of tofu. The flavor combination is good. There's a little heat, sour, and savory. My only complaint is that I wish I had more tofu since it was on the heavy side.I haven't had a chance to try their dessert. I'm always too stuffed at the end. If yelp would allow 1/2 star ratings I would give Ichiban 3.5 stars. Since they do not they're getting 4 today.- Tootles!PS: They have the best spicy mayo sauce!"}, {"review_id": "2kUysb_70r-_6e7MjcgRZA", "user_id": "JauUrzrWq6FE55BwC-b7Aw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/15/2016", "text": "Ok, here's the bratty California girl making her elitist review of a Rhode Island Korean/sushi restaurant. I'm sorry, but the sushi in Rhode Island in general doesn't even stand a chance. And here, while the service was warm and inviting (I loved the generosity with their ban chan), I still cannot get the taste of the mediocre sushi out of my mouth. And that was a month ago. It was expensive and the fish was mediocre. The rice also tasted... just a bit off (maybe it was too sweet and sticky). Not bad, but definitely not what good sushi should be. We also ordered their seafood jjambong, which was delicious and a huge heaping portion. If I come back, it'll be for the Korean food and not the Japanese.
