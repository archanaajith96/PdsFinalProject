I appreciate their attention to customer service and their willingness to hear me out. Since I did not speak about the food originally I just have the say the Tamales are AMAZING!Original review- This time my experience was horrible. My previous experiences with Tucson Tamale have generally been pretty good. I generally only order catering and generally spend $350 + on each order. Tucson Tamale is a favorite of my company and many people order from there, however I will be sharing my poor experience with others who tend order from them at my company.I ordered 2 meat options and 2 veg/vegan options (as well as multiple sides and dessert). The order was repeated back to me and it was correct. A few days before my catering order was to be delivered, they called me back to let me know they did not have my dessert but offered a different option. I agreed to the replacement option and asked for a total. I was later called back and given a different total ($80 more) because they forgot to charge me for the dessert. I ended up removing the dessert from my order. During both of these interactions, the rest of my order was not confirmed. When my order was delivered, 16 of the tamales were incorrect and there wasn't any salad dressing (for a salad large enough for 20 people). I tried calling twice, but the phone just rang (possibly no answer due to lunch rush). When I finally got through to someone and explained my order was incorrect and we didn't get dressing, the person I spoke with spoke with the GM. Instead of the GM getting on the phone with me to discuss this mistake, he had his employee tell me I was wrong and he knows without a doubt that I did not order the red chili tamales, I ordered green corn. This is just not the case. I have my order written down, the person who I share a cubical with heard me place my order, and why would I order 16 green corn tamales when I had already ordered 10 of the chili rellano tamales, which are essentially the same thing? When I reminded the employee the size of the business our company provided, all she could say was that she was sorry. It seems unfortunate that Tucson Tamale Company would want to lose our business over a mistake. They took ownership for forgetting the salad dressing, but refused to acknowledge any error on their part for the wrong tamales."}, {"review_id": "BkVmaXN5PhlFKDOugNjkQw", "user_id": "xxeQ-wHymGCS6ShpA-3iaQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "I've seen programs on the Food and Travel channels about the Tucson Tamale Co. I've read fellow Yelper's reviews. I've waited about a year to get my fix for these tamales. After all the build up, it was a big letdown. Granted I only had a small sample size (2 tamales), they were OK and not OK. I had the Black Bean and Cheese (OK) and the Blue Corn, Veggie and Cheese (not OK) . This tamale was very mussy, I had to mix it with my side of pinto beans and eat it with my chips and salsa. The red mild salsa was very good. Like I said a small sample size that I tried, I would have liked to try there chicken and pork tamales. I traveled about an hour to get to this place. It is not in the greatest area of Tucson (especially at night). I'm always on the prowl for a good tamale. I'll keep searching."}, {"review_id": "OcS3SkMZ0if0yHE4rC2gWw", "user_id": "1bhGCuBNnLK2ocicdg8njw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "A locally owned restaurant that has a great selection of tamales including several vegan options.

Management tells me that the cooking technique has been improved for the tamales to keep them more moist inside as well as improvements to the way the meat is cooked. Being here during a busy lunch hour shows just how popular the food here is.Upon recommendation I ordered the red chile beef burrito with slaw and spicy rice. The burrito is amazing; I find it hard to put down. The tortilla is fresh and perfectly cooked. The filling of beans and beef, corn and rice, and magic tickles my tastebuds. The red chile seasoning is on point! I still love the salsas, they are herbaceous and perfectly spiced. I like the mild with a little hot mixed in. Added to the rice and burrito enhanced the robust flavors. All in all this was a fantastic experience and I am happy to improve my rating. Great job Tucson Tamale!"}, {"review_id": "el_9cCDowSKerSW8AGBnlg", "user_id": "EaRd_4nFnPs8Fei-H2ZmVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "What to get: tamales!Service: 5/5Atmosphere: fast casual, take outWait: 0 mins (Monday 11AM for 2)Parking: shared parking lotThe Experience: [June 2016]I can finally review this place! I still have a vivid memory of getting to Tucson and eating these tamales. Oh, they were so good. I didn't eat breakfast just so I could save room for these!The place is in a shopping center, so the parking lot is shared with multiple businesses. Easy to find a spot when I went. The restaurant itself makes me think of a taqueria with a salsa bar, except tamales are their main thing. They have quite a variety to choose from and they do them well.I remember I got the blue corn and Santa Fe tamales. There was one more, but I don't recall which it was. Two were filling enough, so I had to take the last one for the road, but this is exactly what I was looking for when I think 'local favorite.' I even gushed to my mom how good it was since I was on a roadtrip across the US. If only they could ship these out! The salsa bar is also great so you can munch on some chips to go along with you tamales.Do yourself a favor and check this place out if you're in Tucson!"}, {"review_id": "887WXjAo3Q3dDw2HBuOLRw", "user_id": "gxYjmyb31JtIE-SK3c4Fhw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "I have been here every time I come to Tucson.

Tucson Tamale Co has four frozen vegan tamale flavors, and two fresh to enjoy in their restaurant-Blue Corn Veggie, and Vegetable Curry. Their tamale combo meals are reasonably priced ($7 for two tamales, and two sides) and most all of the side dish options are vegan. Ambiance is casual yet clean with a colorful taqueria vibe, and service is very friendly and fast. I tried both vegan tamale flavors with my combo meal, the Spicy Rice and Spicy Black Beans as sides. The sides were bland and overcooked-no spice whatsoever. The Vegetable Curry Tamale was okay-the filling was skimpy but flavorful and complimented the light fluffy masa surprisingly well. The Blue Corn flavor was terrible-overcooked and dry with maybe a tablespoon of filling, and an unpleasant canola oil aftertaste. I also tried the Guacamole and chips, which were inexcusably bad for a Mexican restaurant. The guac definitely came from a package, and the chips were stale Tostitos. My date tried a variety of the meat and cheese filled tamales and was equally disappointed. While I support the efforts of Tucson Tamale Co and appreciate their vegan offerings, they need to work on their recipes and improve the quality and freshness of their products."}, {"review_id": "evpqYz-z-Z65jeIeolVNNA", "user_id": "T6jCRh9Qi6bzAp-TG2Duvw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/1/2017", "text": "I don't know, maybe my expectations were ruined by watching Andrew Zimmern highlight this place on a Bizarre Eats special. I've eaten probably hundreds of tamales from being in AZ, from family friends and their classic recipes for the holidays to the frozen en masse offerings at Costco. And while I do think it's appropriately priced and you get what you ask for, the tamales ended up just okay for me.Very standard decor to the place - tables to the left, counter/kitchen to the right. There's a display window for tamales you can bring home right next to the menus. For some reason I remember the lighting being really dim, but I didn't care too much about that.I should've taken a picture because the menu is different. As of today, the standard ordering was only the 2-tamale plate - not 1 or 3 as you see in the pics, but I was too tired to ask for something else. And instead of named tamale combinations, it's now matter-of-fact \"Green Chile Pork and Cheese\" or \"Jalapeno and Cheese\". I happened to get those two actually. The tamale itself - I liked the bits of fresh corn mixed into the masa. But disregarding the fillings, which were both good, the bite to the whole thing felt crumbly or dry the entire meal. That just might the dangers of reheating food made en masse at ridiculously high levels, but going 2-for-2 on the dryness wasn't encouraging.Maybe I would stop by if I lived in the area, but I don't know if I would make a drive just for here with some friends.

My family of 6 had a hard time fitting into the small booths... but can't really blame them for that with the small space they have right now.
