The ambience is cool, funky and inviting. And the food and drinks are awesome.As other Yelpers have stated the drinks are freshly made to order and the food is fresh as well.I ordered (to-go) the spicy kale wrap & spicy mofo with a side of kale salad and fire shot to drink.Wowzers! Although neither spicy item was nearly as spicy as the drink, they were all super tasty and generous portion sizes were given.I will definitely be back numerous times while I am working in the area. There are more menu items and pieces of art that I want to check out.Oh btw they had a DJ playing some tunes the late afternoon that I came in.Such an awesome experience-making place to spend your time, fill your belly and enlighten your soul."}, {"review_id": "TMQF-LfKmP54kOhemnzZfg", "user_id": "3mFMCcMx74kP577NrkbXDw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "One word...DOPE!!!! This place was everything!! The food, the culture, music, owners, vibes, books....it was on point. I was in the area looking for a few healthy options and stumbled upon Humanitree House and I'm so happy I did. They serve all vegan options plus juices and smoothies. I had the chickenUNphilly on a garlic wrap and I was impressed! I'm not vegan or vegetarian yet but I left happy and with a full belly. It was soooooo delicious! I also ordered the kale salad to go and it's a huge portion! The salad held up well and was not soggy. I also tried the Jamaica mon' smoothie and again....delicious and fresh. I'll definitely visit again. Also it wasn't expensive compared to some vegan restaurants."}, {"review_id": "KXSOfQ7scenWq2CM-ox_Wg", "user_id": "YGzuJZ6pBaMKcXEUpXEuwA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Love the staff here, they are always right on time with a lunch suggestion and they never disappoint.#SupportLocal"}, {"review_id": "Mt-Pbjcx9vuXyrcg-H8ylA", "user_id": "e8VkIs3TiHPIbcOqzE9mYg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Stopped by here in the afternoon and got a Warrior smoothie.

When decided to come here the next morning. This place is very different and super artistic. Just walking into this place makes your feel creative and free. First time trying an pitaya bowl and I am hooked! It definitely lives up to the hype. The color is so vibrant and all the additional toppings gives it that edge. The granola is so good! It's super crunchy which gives a nice bite against the pitaya blend. The fruits are tart which pairs perfect with the sweetness of the dragon fruit and the agave. Wish I lived in Augusta just so I can have this everyday!"}, {"review_id": "JKo8w4ZeoucrFwcGoGgufA", "user_id": "y7JzrGiDw49QMuRt9wu1yg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "This is probably the most vegan friendly eatery I've been to.  I was shocked to find such a gem in the south, but low and behold there it was 5 mins from the highway in Augusta.  Known for its extremely healthy menu and vegan founder, Humanitree has received many acknowledgements from the community and the news re: its commitment to fueling the people of Augusta with the best nutrients. There is also an authentic reggae artistic energy that radiates from the beautifully painted walls and the chill/peaceful music. Definitely a spot you'll want to checkout regardless of dietary preference. Who doesn't want to feed their hunger with organic plants? Totally helped center my flow and kept me healthy on my southern excursion."}, {"review_id": "XAe6xMKcegZIIC96hDLmkg", "user_id": "d7D4dYzF6THtOx9imf-wPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/8/2017", "text": "I'm traveling from Atlanta to Columbia, South Carolina, right now and was looking for some place in Augusta to take a break. I saw that this place offered vegan items, so decided to stop here along my drive.Parking outside is free and fairly easy to find but requires you to parallel park on the street. The store is a large open space that has a community center feel to it. It is definitely eclectic and has art all over the walls and more than one tapestry of Bob Marley. I learned that most of the art is hand painted by the owner-artist with his fingers and that he doesn't use any brushes.I had friendly interactions with staff who explained their 100% vegan menu to me. I opted for the UnChickPhilly, which was pretty good. I was hoping to see mac and cheez on the menu, but didn't see it. It smells like incense in here and incense was actively burning in the bathroom when I went to use it. Luckily, that's a smell that I like.Overall, a good place to stop if you are driving through Augusta. I'd like to come back here to try their vegan breakfast menu next time I'm in town."}, {"review_id": "VD3PmkqnZEU9U4SJ9jCbqA", "user_id": "nveLlUV15-ffIP_dTtNpPQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Food and drinks are fresh.

I yelped a place for studying (that had wifi and tea) and naturally I chose the one with the best reviews.There was plenty of street parking although I should have totally road my bike here and sat outside to enjoy the crisp fall air. I ordered a chai which unfortunately I wasn't super impressed with, but I promised myself I wouldn't judge them based off of one chai which I am glad I didn't! I actually scooped up one of their awesome Groupon deals for their fresh pressed juices and they did not disappoint. I ordered \"the remedy\" which was a carrot ginger pressed juice and I loved it. I still have a couple more juices left on my groupon which I'm looking forward to using to try new flavors.I still haven't tried the food but from what I've heard it's good too, which is lucky for me since I'm a vegetarian and they have options catered to us veg lovers. The open layout is one thing I loved the most about it as well as all the in house art displays, and the music they play out of their old speakers. It is definitely an Augusta staple, and a must try for every one."}, {"review_id": "9QLCY8CoMXWX883QuVfC0w", "user_id": "voNkFkzqUJzJrodca5NVgA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "I can't tell you enough how much I loved this neighborhood gem.

From the people to the location to the juice/food/smoothies, it is all amazing. It may sound like overload to say everything is covered in love, but it literally says it as the last ingredient on every bottle of juice (\"LOVE\"). You feel it from the moment you first walk in.     The new location, in my opinion, has allowed them room to breathe. They now have the tables and bars (one along the wall, the other where everything is prepared) for seating as well as a lounge area. If you have never been, be prepared to walk into the fusion of a juice bar, vegan restaurant and art gallery. I won't take up 3 paragraphs covering everything they offer so I will hit the highlights. Juice: If you are sick, healthy, tired, trying to lose weight, want to have more energy then come here and ask. Denise will tell you exactly what you need to meet your goals and get on track. She also sells different packages where you have a weekly juice plan to follow (be sure to order these in advance). All of the ingredients are organic, natural, local (if possible), of the highest quality, and cold pressed. There is no better juice in the CSRA.Food: The MOFO (not a typo) wrap is my favorite, but I have to be a good Yelp friend to anyone who reads this and tell you to get the Kale Salad. The recipe is a house secret so don't even bother to ask. These two together will leave you completely satisfied for lunch [not an easy task for me].*Insider's Tip-They offer lunchtime delivery Tuesday-Friday [open on Saturdays/closed Sundays, Mondays].-There are events, including a Open Mic every 1st and 3rd Monday, that take place onsite."}, {"review_id": "27qL_Pj9l50_uW2zUpszfg", "user_id": "KVrbcPx__XH7tJEshRfRiw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "This place has a unique eclectic vibe you won't find anywhere else in Augusta.

This place surpassed and left me in absolute awe. The ambiance is very down to earth and rustic. Artistic does not begin to describe the place. Tones of culture, roots and pride cannot even describe how peaceful it is. Unbeknownst to us we actually met the owners who were sitting with their son in a gallery off the main cafe. Baruti (I hope I got that right), explained that his paintings were done in pastel, oils and acrylic media painted on wood and stretched canvas by his hands....no paint brushes. Amazed. The food was amazing as well. I ordered the vegan burger in a wrap with BBQ sauce and vegan cheese. Crazy. Amazing. My husband ordered the eggplant blt made with eggplant bacon. The only thing is the eggplant bacon was hard for our brace faces to bite because of curing. However it was amazingly tasty. My husband ordered a love pusha smoothie and I had a Jamaican smoothie. They were so good.

I can't believe it's taken me this long to try it, but now I can't stop going back. Since I first tried this place I think I've gone back over 3 times in the past week alone! It's a gold mine for smoothies and cold pressed juices. They make everything there and there are no added sugars or preservatives in their drinks. Each time I forget to take a picture of the food because I devour it all so quickly!From the menu:Bean burger on onion bread. The onion bread reminded me of an Arby's bun. This was my first time trying a bean burger and it was too mushy for my taste. Not sure what I was expecting since of course beans are going to be that texture. It kept falling apart and made the meal messy. This one wasn't for me.Unphilly wrap: I'm not used to vegan food but this was delicious. The wrap seemed homemade. Honestly I don't even know what was inside it. It just tasted good. Kale salad is my favorite. I can just get an order of kale salad and eat it on its own. It's got a touch of sweetness but the red onions in it give it a little kick to contrast the sweet. I've got this alone for lunch and it filled me up for just $4.50Acai bowl: absolute best. It's big enough to make a meal out of it! I can't get enough of it. It has acai, coconut, dates, blueberries, cashews, and banana. Topped with coconut, granola, honey, and more fruit. Reminds me of a parfait bowl mixed with a fruit smoothie.Beet trip: one of their bottled cold press juices. Very refreshing and energizing. I only chose this because the purple color caught my eye.Warrior smoothie: this drink grew on me. Each sip got better and better. Creamy and sweet and filled with superfoods like flax seeds, spirulina, goji berries, and more.Everything is a little on the pricey side, but I think it's worth it. The store also has a lounge area filled with paintings by Baruti that were all created by using his fingers as the brush. They are all breathtaking and he is incredibly hospitable as well! Baruti was welcoming the first time I walked in the store and the staff was also very helpful with what to try on the menu. I can't brag about the place enough! I wish they stayed open later."}, {"review_id": "LW_z-c4MHINY3YGn4DklLA", "user_id": "G9Vp0zDt63-6wmfHlGUeqg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/12/2017", "text": "This is the best place to get 100% vegan food/smoothies/drinks in Augusta.

My girlfriend and I, were skeptical to try vegan food for the first time but the Humanitree did not disappoint us. It's actually part of the reason we decided to go fully vegan. The general manager at Humanitree recommended the ChickUNPhilly & the Jamaican Mon smoothie and since then those items have been my go to. To be honest, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.
