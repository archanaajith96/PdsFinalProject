Side note: Lines can get long around 2am.As a vegetarian I have tried their nacho (order without beef, also so yummy), 4 cheese, and veggie poutine. None of the varieties disappoint and portions can be shared. Since they get packed in the AM hours it's a hit or miss whether the food will come out warm or cold. I've experienced it both ways but just a heads up!"}, {"review_id": "Tqhl-jdppMjWjbCy_-P8ag", "user_id": "hZtc-Fkg_ALJ4g_cghcz5g", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I don't know how to explain how terribly awful it was to come here. Worst service I've seen. One guy spent more time hanging with his friends and eating than he did working. There were only two people working so this meant that we waited ages for a simple burger and poutine and then two more workers showed up but when I went to order no one bothered to even acknowledge me for 3-4 minutes and then I ordered and the three remaining people decided to talk amongst themselves while I'm standing there.I get that this is a small operation and you're gonna wait a second for food but it was upsetting to be excited to try some place new and have them fail so spectacularly. I never even got the shake I wanted, I walked out. Furious.Will probably never go back unless there's a real shakeup with the staff."}, {"review_id": "nA0yJ03S9txJuj09yI1voA", "user_id": "UgFnx16R_DYYa5kVQIGP6A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Place was freezing, took 25 min for a burger & fries with only 1 person ahead of me in line, the hard burger bun was colder than the lettuce, and the fries were topped with cold cheese & cold gravy.

I got the burger fries and drink combo.  The fries were amazing.... super crispy on the outside,  and very soft on the inside.  They were the best french I have ever eaten.....and I've eaten a lot of fries. The soda pop was Jonny Ryan.  There aren't too many places that have that, so it's nice when you see it. The burger was great, cooked to perfection.  At 6oz, it was a reasonable size. I am not a fan a gigantic burgers and this was big, but not too big.  They were grinding the meat while we were there and the meat was good quality and nicely trimmed.  My only complaint with the burger is the bun wasn't toasted and it was a little tough and it detracted from the burger a bit, but that is more of a personal preference."}, {"review_id": "1z5GPAeQHZWygTPlJKUW4w", "user_id": "sw5PhF2ALEZ1I1aj-HaelA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "Allen Street Poutine, you ROCK! Thank you for making my first poutine an awesome experience! I made sure I starved myself before I devoured the potatoe-y goodness. The service was phenomenal. They seemed so passionate and chill and made me feel right at home. I asked the server, Jimmy, on what he recommends. He highly suggested the Montreal smoked meat (which he personally prepares and cuts everyday). Immediately, he had me at pulled pork. The fries were perfectly seasoned and not heavily salted. They tasted fresh from the fryer and were not greasy at all. The pulled pork and brisket were smoked to perfection and cut into perfectly diced pieces. The gravy complimented with the pickles and cheese curds. The combination of gravy, potatoes, and cheese reminds me of a thanksgiving dinner (but 100x better, of course). I became super full halfway through eating but my hand kept naturally gravitating towards the fries.Overall, this place is perfect for anyone who loves to drown their faces in fries. Any college student, kid, parent, elder, or dog will definitely leave this place with a smile on his/her face :)"}, {"review_id": "epl3FHUuHONW_VRt2U3MBA", "user_id": "ayAKU4GmLJxfwYFZ8dSjsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "When it comes to Poutine, it doesn't get any better.

I popped in on a Monday early evening. I think there was on couple seated upstairs otherwise i felt like the only customer there. I ordered a small classic poutine, a montreal smoked meat sandwich and an ale.  When i got my order , the sandwich came with its own fries. Server kinda chuckled and admitted he should have probably told me that. More on these fries later. The poutine was..ok. good quality french fry, some gravy with a little soice/kick (swisd chalet??) And very few curds. The sandwich while tasty, was sparse considering the $13 price. Schwatz's deli in Montreal has nothing to worry. This lacked meat!.

Poutine is poutine. The variations of dishes that you can order are pretty good. A little on the trendy side.

Being from TX, we don't really get a lot of poutine so when we saw this place, we got super excited. Unfortunately, our excitement didn't last until the food. The gravy was thick, clumpy and more importantly, tasteless. It tasted like I was eating unflavored, liquify jelly. I ate it mostly because I was hungry rather than actually enjoying the food. I tried the traditional poutine and for the first time in my life, I didn't finish it all. The store is a pretty small line area but has a decent amount of seating (although most people took their poutine to go). The cashier did not look like he wanted to be there and the entire operations getting the poutine to the customer was very inefficient. He would place the order with the cook who would make the poutine's quick but then they would sit there on the shelves until there were about 6-7 bowls (or no more place for bowls) before handing them out. So, this resulting in you staring at your poutine for about 5 minutes, telepathically willing one of the staff to be able to box it up for you. I really don't know how people ranked this place so highly. Either I am a poutine snob or the place had an off night or people in Buffalo haven't had this better stuff. All in all, I was pretty disappointed."}, {"review_id": "yCC4l7P4FayUUPLJigp2IA", "user_id": "Ot326UTJsRkP-GkXuvkiMQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "Allen street poutine is the most perfect buffalo night out restaurant you could ever imagine.

Being in B-Lo the number 1 item we were planning on eating was chicken wings, of course. #2 was Beef of Weck (yummy) and #3 on the list was Poutine. Enter Allen Street Poutine. After drinking all day at the football game (GO BILLS) and it being our last night in town we figured that it was the perfect time for some Poutine. We got the Philly, Montreal meat and one of the traditional offerings. This was waaay too much food for two California girls that had been drinking vodka all day, but we wanted to sample more than one. I have no complaints whatsoever. Everything was HOT and flavourful. Traditional was my favorite, it always is. It is fun to try fun flavours, but I am a purist. LOL!!The service was great, and the décor of the joint is super cool. Loved the big Allen Street Poutine sign. Fantastic.

The pros: The food came out quickly and was clearly fresh, not greasy, etc. The helpings were also substantial and if you ate most or all of it, I suspect you'd be full.  The prices were great in an increasingly expensive food city.  The cons: Neither of our meals but especially mine was particularly enjoyable, and both for the same reason.  Even though it isn't listed on the menu as an ingredient, both non-traditional poutines still had gravy.  Hers was a little weird.  Mine - with the special sauce and the gravy mixing more as you ate - was kind of gross.  As well, the restaurant was really, really loud with a heavy rap music at 5 o'clock in the afternoon.  (We were the only two people dining in and couldn't hear each other.) At one point, she asked me if they thought this was a rave. The only other thing I'll say is that I had the traditional poutine at an event once and it was delicious.  I would come back again (big fan of poutine) but I would be much more careful with my ordering.  (I think its safe to say the gravy comes on all the poutines - traditional and non - whether it is mentioned or not on the menu.)"}, {"review_id": "ZdmDA80tvxGb2kpVueftiA", "user_id": "p3R6BfH8okt3fYcuoA--7Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/18/2017", "text": "We went here to kick off restaurant week 2017.

The chicken curry would be better if the chicken breast was cut into smaller pieces. We were the only customers at the time so customer service was great and the people working really were kind. Over all a good experience for your poutine needs. The only con was the sloppy joe poutine has a bit of a spicy kick.
