Then you have a complimentary salad. My family shared a pitcher of red sangria and several appetizers, including fried calamari, garlic shrimp, sardines, and Spanish ham with melon. We then shared a paella Del Mar, which was delicious but we only made a small dent in the dish because we were a full from appetizers.We obviously had room for dessert though and ordered a tres leches cake which was divine!! Overall, they also have super friendly staff and it's a great family place and business place to dine."}, {"review_id": "0no7muyi_-RzWaOg1L_Tlw", "user_id": "RURM7437iwYLM23ATYr61g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Great food!

All the staff was very accommodating especially for a larger party at that point in the night. Upon sitting down we were brought a couple large salads as well as a generous bread bowl. We ordered a pitcher of sangria for the table to have a drink or two prior to going out. A majority of the table was very pleased with their dishes we ordered paellas, stuffed shrimp, other seafood dishes. All the seafood tasted fresh, a majority of the dishes were nice abundant portions. I guess my main complaint here would be the prices of the entrees. They are definitely on the pricier side, especially for a Portuguese food in Newark. I generally don't complain about the price, however especially here it could deter you away from ordering what you want to try in fear of wasting 30+ on a dish. The food was good, service was alright. I don't know if I'll return as there are definitely alternatives that far surpass this spot."}, {"review_id": "y_l_5B9dK74FIisWFnd8XA", "user_id": "y4Vef7qU_u2J29pFbnFxgw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Very nice spot, great atmosphere, haven't been there too recently but I never had a bad meal there."}, {"review_id": "SYBgMFY7nBz93DCQH2i8pw", "user_id": "vjtpb0Bl_fZjz5MOHL6IOw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/8/2017", "text": "We came here just to grab some drinks but ended up staying for dinner. The dining room was beautiful. When we got there we were the only ones in the dining room but it quickly filled up as the night went on. The service was amazing. We had about 3 servers that worked our table the whole night. For drinks we started with a pitcher of sangria now I will say I didn't think the sangria had much of any wine or lq in it so I wouldn't get it again. But my coworkers did enjoy it. They brought their cocktail list maybe 30 mins after we ordered the sangria which I thought was weird. Anyway the cocktails were way better! The Maitai was amazing! As for food I ordered the filet mignon with mushroom and it was delicious! Cooked perfectly! There was enough food left for me to have some again the next day. AllOf my coworkers loved their dishes which included crab cakes, veal, pasta and a flank steak. I will definitely be back!!!"}, {"review_id": "crZdKTjFCFEPttdl4xkMXQ", "user_id": "m8gHc4O6FX0t8edOEEYPtQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "The atmosphere is good, the menu is large, but the steaks were not that great, most for the large group were over cooked.

Came here for my brothers birthday and it was fantastic.Food: they serve you bread, olives, and ALOT of salad before you even order, which is awesome. My family ordered the NY strip steak, paella valenciana, and chicken marsala. Steak was cooked perfectly and just to our liking. Paella was so good. And the chicken Marsala was very flavorful. They do give you a side of rice and veggies for the table with your order so it ends up being ALOT of food. My family split those 3 entrees among 4 people and still had leftovers.Service: so so attentive! My glass of water was never empty. And staff checked in on us an appropriate amount of times during our meal. Atmosphere: nice and elegant. Gives off a very fancy vibe so good for times when you want to celebrate life or just any event :)Price: I will say the dinner prices looked a bit hefty.

The sangria was tasty as were the appetizers.  The entrees all came together and were delicious.  Everyone was pleased with meal which is not easy when you have nine picky eaters.  They did not rush us at all considering how busy they were.  We still had to flag down our waiter to get dessert menus and the bill.  It's a funny thing here how the service is all over you up until the point where they make certain that you're pleased with your meal.  Then it seems to take a while to get the table cleared and some dessert.  That isn't a bad thing if you have time to relax and talk but it's nice to be checked on in case your time is limited.Overall, I am very pleased with the service and I am grateful that Forno's of Spain came through for me on such an important day."}, {"review_id": "pQjwa68z56RUv1vJUzVZNQ", "user_id": "GfLgayB0rOY5TeIVLcyiEw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "This has been my go to spot for years and it never disappoints.
