I am tempted to go back for meals in a row. Everything was great, everyone from the host to our server were gracious, helpful  and friendly without being overbearing.We made a reservation so thankfully were able to get seated pretty much right away on a Thursday night. There were some locals who said that's not normally a problem, but as Spokane gets more popular, you may have to wait (but not long, they got seated right after us).Love that they have a full vegetarian and a full carnivorous menu, with lots of seafood options. I ordered the Idaho trout, since we are so close to the border, and got the biggest piece of fish I've ever seen on a plate. I ate all of it. We also had the smoked trout bruschetta which came with 6 large pieces. Boy we are not in sf anymore. I had a bite of my friend's scallops too and they were divine!! I have a feeling everything is good.All they touch is gold."}, {"review_id": "pEnG2ggkM3gYtwGxnc8bvQ", "user_id": "e3G_WXa3fjAXAxjYg08rZw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Catered to a big crowed.  Initially called to reserve 10.  But they accommodated 2 more stragglers from our group.  Food was good.

Mizuna was right around the corner .. not far away from where our car was parked, became a natural choice :D .. not that parking is difficult in our city but trying to carry the traditions of bigger cities :DThe place wasn't much crowded .. we got our table the instant we reached .. which was nice.The menu did look really interesting and then there was a separate one for vegetarians which was even better.But to be honest, may be it was my first time there or the misplaced orders that night or I just don't know .. the place did not live up to the \"best of the best\" hype .. at least for the vegetarian grub.We asked for the falafels and arancini .. the falafels were a bit dry, have had better .. arancini were good with that sauce and walnut pesto; good for sharing :D you wouldn't want to have those just for yourself that by the end of ball 3 of those 5 you are asking others to share with you :D .. a bit monotonous with the flavours ..Also, the tagine veggies with brown rice .. well, left me a bit disappointed .. not with their taste, no .. they tasted great .. but with my expectations of them coming in a tagine pot not on a plate .. okay !! they were cooked in a tagine pot, I get it but somehow I expected them to be served in the pot too .. may be I am wrong but that is what I thought .. and will continue to think so :DWe also had a steak which was loved, giving us a feel that may be the vegetarian part of the menu might have to be revisited because at those prices, I feel, it should be one hell of a dining experience.In spite of this when I read their menu, anytime, I really feel compelled to go and try out all those other things .. the menu is crafted meticulously, is really inviting and bring the best of our local produce.No wonder it is considered as Spokane's finest.But till then I would stick to a little bit short of 4 stars rounding it up to 4."}, {"review_id": "iLvVRBuZSlBuoMOtj2HVqA", "user_id": "F8nsQiCe37JZpqYscT0DHg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "One of our favorite places in Spokane.

I ordered the Pan Seared Duck Breast with Red Wine Risotto and mushroom herb-pan sauce. I really just felt like I could've used another duck breast because it seemed like I had a big serving of risotto and not enough meat to go along with it. Plus I was still hungry after my meal and that was even after having the Butter Lettuce salad and bread, there is no shame in my foodie game . My five year old daughter had the Cheese Pizza and an Apple Juice Lemonade which she loved. We also ordered Steamed Clams with Pork Belly and that was very good also. For the price point I just needed more duck breast and that would've made my night. I was so hungry I only remembered to take pictures of the appetizers, my apologies. I'd definitely recommend going to Mizuna and ordering the duck breast if you're not famished because if you are then I would probably suggest going for something heartier like the New York strip, because honestly that's what I plan on ordering next time."}, {"review_id": "xYKzxEAaYyVODc96nTn-9A", "user_id": "0-VCRGJjtPmCsrnuFd84jw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "I don't know why I haven't gone here more often! Had a delicious scallop dinner here last year and hadn't been back since until today. Got the eggplant sandwich with a side ahi tuna salad. Both items were delicious, and so much food that I'll probably get 2 meals out of it! Food here is fresh, high-quality, and not too expensive for what you get. So many vegetarian and pescetarian options! Lots of drink options too, huge wine list, and plenty of cocktails and beer. Service is friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is subdued and classy.

They have two full menus, regular dinner menu and a full vegetarian/vegan menu as well, which was quite refreshing. Such an eclectic mix of foods and dishes it was hard to choose but we started with pork belly starter and really enjoyed it. The prices are a bit high but if we would of known the size of the starter, it would of changed my order for my main course. The pork belly was ample and came with a delightful remoulade sauce, golden crostini and green olives, very rich and filling.  For dinner I tried the duck breast which came with the most interesting heirloom squash gratin, crispy, sweet and creamy, with a dash of chèvre, just right. My co worker ordered the ahi salad and the blackened swordfish and he was in heaven! The ambiance and location of Mizuna was really lovely, can't wait to come back again soon.... oh and PS if you have the chance to order their Apple lemonade it's dynamite!!!!"}, {"review_id": "hILOCKHjHGIHchkBn0zmvQ", "user_id": "xz1BSQ9eUA8GFTFAGuIaJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Great customer service from Lori!

This is my first choice for a classier night out or to take an out of town guest. In fact, one of my last visits was to take my bestie who was in town from Seattle. Our food took longer than expected, and we were worried she was going to miss her flight, but when we told our server, she went the extra mile to check on everything and get the check taken care of promptly. Many servers may have just told us to cool our jets, but she took a personal interest.Another thing about Mizuna worth giving a thumbs up to - they prepare their vegan/vegetarian foods on an entirely separate surface, which really is above and beyond.  I can't say enough good things about this place."}, {"review_id": "QMqcoeiV5G2xEU6LUnTBlg", "user_id": "Bm77nunK6Am1i3_iS7_QwQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/19/2017", "text": "Wow!  Next time I'm in town, I'm definitely bringing my wife to this place.

My colleague enjoyed his shrimp pasta, and we split an apple/walnut salad - delicious. Service was somewhat slow for a Wednesday evening when they weren't crowded, but the staff was very nice and friendly, and answered all my questions. Finally, just be aware that pricing is a little high at more than $30 per plate, $15 per appetizer, and wines at $9-$15.  It's well worth the price, but I don't think that '$$' is accurate for Yelp (just my two cents)."}, {"review_id": "LmNdVGCkE_C9lSO93JFkrA", "user_id": "y-9BSgziJjgLRvZKO-8BLQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2017", "text": "Found this place by accident really.

As a die hard vegetarian I dreamt of eating here someday. Alas, my $5.75/hr job back then was not enough to afford a night out at Mizuna.Fast forward 20 years. Minimum wage is no longer $5/hr and I am now a pescatarian.  I found myself back in Spokane visiting family and came to Mizuna on a Friday night.  What a gem! There is an outdoor seating area, but due to the heatwave we ate inside.  The ambiance is fantastic with brick walls, exposed duct work, soft lighting and windows that look out onto the sidewalk. I think the space has been recently expanded as there is a bar area which looks a bit more modern.  Especially, if you are a single person in town for business looking for a meal, this would be totally comfortable to eat out at. A table of 5 of adults and 2 kids had a few appetizers to get started. The kids tagged along but I don't think Mizuna is a place that caters to kids.  They do have a kids section of the menu, but Mizuna is more of a date night, or quiet adult place.  We ordered the crab cakes, spinach arancini and pork belly for appetizers.  The crab cakes were nice and spicy and the spinach arancini was divine.  The rest of the table ate every bit of the pork belly so I'm assuming it was good.  One of the best things about Mizuna besides the food is that the music isn't blaring!  You can actually have a conversation with people at your table. This is so rare these days.  I've eaten in restaurants from the West Coast to the East Coast and it is becoming more and more of a problem even holding a conversation across the table because of the music.  For dinner I had the crispy polenta. The sauce was the star. I think I would have preferred slightly skinnier pieces of polenta better than the thick cuts which came with the dish, but overall it was great.  The Mister had the eggplant parmesan and ate every last bit. The rest of the table had chicken, duck, new york strip, a main course salad (which is huge!) and a kids meal.  Everyone loved what they had.   Score an extra point for the bathrooms. They are European style with full on doors that go from the bottom of the floor to the top!  I  thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Mizuna.  The service was professional yet not overbearing, the atmosphere was chill and the food was great.  We didn't feel rushed, but our table was kept at a good pace between appetizers and our main courses. I'll make it a point whenever I visit Spokane again to visit Mizuna. Its a great place to enjoy good food, slowly sip a nice glass of wine, and enjoy good conversation. Very European style.  Enjoy your food, enjoy the music which is quiet enough that you can actually have a conversation with your table...and of course, I love the bathroom doors! :)"}, {"review_id": "yMxPHwqqy75Cq7BeT5nJNw", "user_id": "vt1jUU0fPuP5LZ7EeoomAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Wow.  Fantastic.  The ahi salad was perfect.

Our waitress was very friendly and attentive, and my glass of water was never empty. Now let's talk about the food. The complimentary bread was perfect, and the rosemary infused olive oil that accompanied it was brilliant. Good enough to drink. For the entrees, I ordered the Bouillabaisse, and my date ordered the special, which was cashew encrusted avocado served over rice noodles. The only disappointment I had was the scant two scallops, which were the best I've ever had btw. They were of the melt-in-your-mouth kind of caliber. Plenty of clams though. The broth was perfect and ever so slightly tangy. Now the special....it was indeed special. Quite possibly one of the best vegan dishes I have ever had in my life. The noodles had a very subtle yet delicious peanut sauce, and the avocado pieces were enormous. I could eat this dish for the rest of my life.
