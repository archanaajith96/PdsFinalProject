I've been by the place several times and just assumed it was a hole in the wall restaurant located in the same building as a gas station. However, when you walk in, you can see it is no dump. When you walk in you would have no idea it is a Mexican restaurant, except that there is Mexican music on the radio. The decor is ecclectic, to say the least. Mostly photographs of influential people from around the world. The place is clean and modern.  Naturally I had a burrito. It was very good. It came with a small side of chips and salsas. Honestly, I didn't love either salsa, but they were ok.  The mild salsa had to much tomato for my liking. The spicy salsa was to bitter in my opinion.  Everyone has their own preferences, these didn't match mine. The burrito itself was great. BP is a little more expensive than Chipotle, a little smaller, and not as much choice of insides. While I absolutely enjoyed it, personally I just can't see myself driving 3x the distance to go to BP Iver Chipotle. I still highly recommend it though."}, {"review_id": "J33RM0c-8bgimEh4hpIwzg", "user_id": "HIfFsi-DGiOHO-s3jW5WRQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Large portions, fresh ingredients, great prices, and Vegan options!Everything was fresh and delicious.

That being said, the inside isn't what one would imagine.  The burritos, in my opinion, are hit or miss.  The California is really dry and could use a bit more flavor.  The Pork however is super just and full of flavor with hints of ground pepper and cilantro.Quesadillas are a bit over priced at $4 for a half tortilla with cheese that has no special character to it.  Again, hit or miss, however some picks are definitely worth the stop when one is tired of the chain burrito joints."}, {"review_id": "r5zhUo3T4duH6md3bVr3ew", "user_id": "USzkpdPgegRnX9mpMHugmQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Still my go to spot for the best burrito in Hampton Roads, after having this burrito I have not went to another Mexican restaurant since then.

The burritos are seriously the size of your head. This place is connected to gas station.

The regular sized burrito is probably the size of your head, and the large burrito can easily be split between 2 people. I could barely finish 2/3 of a regular burrito and I was pretty hungry. They have quite a number of options and even vegan options with vegan cheese (my friend ordered it and couldn't believe it wasn't actually real cheese haha). For an extra dollar you can get sour cream & guac on the burrito which is well worth it. Everything tastes super fresh! The worker was super nice and attentive, and gave my friends and I a complementary chips and salsa basket! My friend who came late even got her own chips & salsa side when she ordered."}, {"review_id": "HrQwMgtnxY7MYwPULn1uFA", "user_id": "TfMr6hZqEPS9HaEGjdtqzQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "I LOVE BURRITO PERDIDO! The food is always so fresh and amazing! Me and my little sister went there last week and it was her first time but I've been there plenty of times. She loved it. She got the chicken quesadilla but then we wanted more so we got the steak too and i got a kids burrito. I love how they don't question me getting kids serving size. I had gastric bypass so i can't eat wgat the regular person does. Honest to god i put this food and my fridge and eat it for days and it's still so fresh.

Coming from LA, I have a standard that is pretty high. To be honest I have recently believed that it verged on being downright arrogant.    This being said, the first bite or the steak burrito took me home. This burrito was clearly made with fresh ingredients and with love. Like that, \"you can rock my sweater for the day\" type love.   If you are on the fence about giving this place a try, fret not... You will not be disappointed or hungry after talking their regular burrito (can't imagine ordering a giant)."}, {"review_id": "vHgSgChBuj3CN8sYD9SBsw", "user_id": "w4_XVaTSZPkfTkWjnyGFww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "You can't go wrong coming here!!!

To start, my star rating is based on authenticity and quality, not service. The service is great, but the location is terrible- surrounded by fuel fumes (restaurant located at gas station) while you eat- not a good flavor. It is NOT authentic, you can buy same ingredients at the grocery store and make same quality food. No authentic flavors detected in the meat and other foods. In the age of YouTube, watch videos about how to make authentic burritos or tacos, Mexican style, and feed that to the customers...if you like flavorless and basic food, this is your place!"}, {"review_id": "fSCULj-TMOrdz58txjSq-w", "user_id": "Z4QI2EnOHNL086leagbA3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/22/2017", "text": "Gas station burrito!

The salad also comes with a sweet vinegarette dressing, I used this sparingly but it was great.I'm a huge fan or organic and grads fed items at reasonable prices.

The last time I had something form here my sister brought it home to me. This time I was craving nachos and my sister said the they had the best. Trying to get there was a bit of a mess, since they have changed the roads and now us VBers must pay a toll to get there. We decided to go the long way down through Deep Creek and George Washington Rd so we didn't have to pay. Atmosphere is a 10. The place seems pretty authentic being right next to a gas station and their spanish music playing. Its small, although I have definitely seen smaller, but the tables turn pretty quick. It seemed as though most people were getting their food to go. Which is exactly what I would do if I lived close by.I remember the burritos being awesome last time I was here. So I definitely won't change my star review, because Im not going to rate someone based on their Nachos. But these were not the best-as my sister had stated. They were INCREDIBLY salty. Holy moly. I had maybe abut 5 or 6 bites and all of a sudden realized I had downed 2 water bottles of water and my stomach was so full from all of the water that I couldn't finish my food. I had to take about 85% of it home, which was a total bummer.-- And even while Im sitting here eating my left overs this morning, only after a few bites I still have the STRONGEST after taste of salt! And just overly dehydrated.Everything was just sort of globed on there. I get its a quick place and they need to move orders fast so I do appreciate that but, I don't know. I love my Nachos with jalapeños and there weren't any with this (maybe I missed being able to order a side?). And I like when the ingredients are sprinkled through the chips. So each chip has a little something on it. Not so much. Also, the chips, I just wasn't a fan of them. A bit on the tough side, and overly salty.So, if I were you I would stick with the burritos here. They have that down to a beautiful science! Still on the hunt of the best Nachos in Hampton Roads!"}, {"review_id": "K0_-KerT5WdmE9RB6qgu1A", "user_id": "ANlxduZ_aaxIsWewBrhWMg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Being a Native Texan, It has been hard to find great local Mexican food.This place helps with the homesickness.Everything is local to VA, and reasonably priced.

Located in the Great Bridge area, my friend who is A Chesapeake native took us out here to try it out for the first time. The location may surprise you since it's connected to a gas station but don't be fooled by what you see on the outside. The inside is quite roomy and clean. We ordered and it literally took them 5 minutes for the food to come out. The pulled pork Chimichanga and Steak Nachos did not disappoint. I was impressed by the how fresh and tasty the food was. Even their pico de gallo, hot sauce, and guacamole was superb. Great service to top it off. I think I found my new spot.

We were expecting good things from this place, and they definitely more than met our expectations!We started with some chips, salsa, and guacamole. From there, we were already absolutely hooked! Their guacamole was just so creamy and delicious. I could not stop eating it! Their salsa was some of the best salsa I've had. Even my fiancé, who prefers his salsa to be blended and doesn't usually like the chucks salsa, said it was really good! My fiancé and I shared a half & half chimichanga with chicken and steak, which we realized was a good idea because of the size of it. We just ordered a regular and felt stuffed by it. I can't even imagine how big the giant burritos are! My sister opted for a chicken burrito bowl that was very filling for her as well. She said that she was stuffed but kept eating because that's how good it was!I was surprised by just how much I enjoyed our meal. I was expecting it to be good, but I didn't realize I would love my meal that much!

Much aligned with the Moes, Freebird, Chipotle variety or endless supply of local college burrito joints where salsa and size are the main attraction.Is it horrible, no, not by any means.On that note, salsa, chips and hot sauce appear fresh made and were pretty on point.Place is clean, people were nice, and ingredients fresh, or Farm Fresh as beans and rice were off the shelf variety.Guacamole was rather bland and salty.Portions are obnoxiously huge, buried somewhere in a 10 inch nearly 3 lb burrito full of can beans and box rice was a few measly ounces of chicken and really nothing else. Thankful for the green hot sauce.It was difficult taste wise to discern the burrito from the taco from the chimichanga. Probably could have of squeezed it all into the blender and made a smoothie to the same result.so roll the dice on the menu, it will all taste the same irrespectively. It does seem that the locals really like this place, maybe my opinion is askew after living in Texas."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/burrito-perdido-chesapeake?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
