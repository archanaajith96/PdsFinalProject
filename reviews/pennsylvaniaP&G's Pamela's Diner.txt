In fact, this morning while eating a family sat next to us and the husband asked me, \"Is this place any good?\"  They were from out of town and visiting. I let them know that their decision to come here would not be regretted and that before moving to Pittsburgh myself, I use to drive over from NE Ohio a few times a year for it!  I may have also told them that Pamela's is the reason I moved to Pittsburgh!  After they ate, they said the thought I was joking but now weren't sure.Known for their thin, crispy and large Hot Cakes, you may also want to try the specialty Hot Cakes that are more similar to crepes filled with fruits, creams and the sort. But don't let the deter you from trying their traditional breakfast offerings of eggs, bacon, sausage and of course the other famous Pamela's dish, Lyonnaise Potatoes.  They will cook your eggs to order but over easy is my favorite.  And don't overlook the Hash dishes either.  Corned Beef Hash and Chorizo Hash are two of my favorites.  Needless to say, I have a hard time picking what I want here! But today I think after all these years I finally found the perfect order that gives you the best bang for your buck along with variety so here it is:  Order the Morning After which gives you Two Eggs, Choice of Meat and 2 Hot Cakes for $8.95. Then, pay the up charge of $2 to make the Hot Cakes Specialty Hot Cakes of your choice (Banana Walnut hint hint ;) and finally an order of Lyonnaise Potatoes for $3.50. All that for under $15 and you have a taste of all the best here!  They will bring the Hot Cakes on a separate plate so if you are like me, you mix everything else up and have yourself a nice makeshift Hash.Just a few final comments and you can be in your way to Pamela's but before you go, you need to know these two things. 1) Cash Only...I know I know, just go with it! 2) It's a popular place, especially in the weekend. You may have to wait but it is worth it. Hop inside and get your name on the list and enjoy some conversation with your friends and family until your table is ready.  I promise you, you will not regret it!"}, {"review_id": "3dSgRgGYw2JiGU4wg0VpBQ", "user_id": "RxL3KOklOuN-j10w-nrWpw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "This P&G's Pamela's Diner is located in an area commonly known as the Strip District. There's some street parking, and most importantly its CASH ONLY folks! Get there early on weekends, otherwise there's a line. It does move reasonably fast as they do a good job or turning tables.Food: Their hash and hotcakes seem to be the two things that stand out the most. He had the Pittsburgh Hash - lyonnaise potatoes with chopped up kielbasa and sauerkraut topped with Swiss cheese. Delicious, especially with over easy eggs. I had the Morning After Special - basted eggs (do it!), sausage, and hotcakes. I upped the ante and got the specialty banana walnut hot cakes. Their hotcakes are thick and dense crepes. A wonderful crispy edge, and you can taste the butter it's cooked in. Service: Decent. Orders are taken quickly, with food and drinks coming out as fast, even when they were busy on a Saturday. You won't get a check, but they'll leave your order chit on the table, which you'll then take to the register where they'll tally up what you owe. Cost: One iced tea, a Pittsburgh Hash, a Morning After Special with the specialty hotcake added totaled about $24 after tax. Not bad! Overall: Give it a try. They have several locations around Pittsburgh.

Even though there is a Pamela's within walking distance to my house in shadyside, I will always prefer this location. Usually I order the hot cakes, but this visit I decided to try something new. I went with the veggie omelet and added jalapeños with wheat toast and potatoes on the side. The potatoes were amazinggggg. The omelette was good, but I expected the veggies to me fried into the eggs. Maybe I'm just a newbie with omelettes and didn't know any better. My boyfriend got the hash and LOVED it. How can you not with all of that cheese melted on top!! Overall, a very good experience. We had a attentive waitress who filled my water glass literally as soon as I needed it filled, it's like she could read my mind. I will be back!"}, {"review_id": "T2BWrfcVKPsiGzVj_tPkcw", "user_id": "2zuGG5zgN1jHmUBm5OdpMQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "I visited P&G Pamela's Diner for brunch on Sunday afternoon. The line was out the door however the line moved very fast. The wait for 2 people was only about 25/30 mins despite the crazy line.Also this restaurant is CASH ONLY.I didn't see the cash only sign above the register until I got inside the restaurant so I had to run to PNC bank at the end of the block. So I ordered the Mushroom and Cheese (I chose swiss) Omelet ($8.50) which came with toast and my choice of a side was Lyonnaise Potatoes. My meal okay. Typical diner quality. In my opinion it just lacked flavor and seasoning.My boyfriend ordered the Chorizo Hash (~$9) with eggs and Tortillas. He enjoyed his meal and said it was flavorful.Overall typical diner quality food, so if that's what you're into you will probably like P&G Diner more than I did."}, {"review_id": "OIYKSSC4m4M4SKd7-VVHnw", "user_id": "IFPWVFDxpgnojGPbyqmVKA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Must visit for breakfast or brunch- don't let the line scare you it moved pretty fast and the service & food is so worth the wait!Their famous eggs with the potatoes and the corn beef hash and the crepes.. all delicious!

Quaint as it is, P&G Pamela's Diner was bustling the Thursday morning I stopped in, filled with moms with toddlers, businessmen with suits, and seniors with newspapers.Although the restaurant is nationally known for its pancakes, I didn't bring my sweet tooth to breakfast during my visit, and I instead ordered the \"Pittsburgh Hash,\" which featured crumbled kielbasa sausage, sauerkraut, Lyonnaise potatoes, onions, and melted Swiss cheese, with 2 eggs over easy and a side of toasted white bread smothered in half-melted butter. My setting was rounded out with a small OJ and coffee, the total damage coming to $14.82, cash-only. (Luckily I was carrying cash.)Yes, the dish was a bit heavy, but I was delighted with the wee bit of tang and sweetness imparted by the sauerkraut, an essential component that brought the various ingredients of this hash together in a way that made it truly taste like Pittsburgh. That said, Pamela's Diner could adjust the portion size of this dish: even though I arrived with an empty stomach, I finished about half of the hash, half of my eggs, and half of my toast and was totally stuffed. I couldn't do any more despite that I felt this was one of my better-tasting breakfasts this year.Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast -- though it loses a Yelp star from me for its stubborn cash-only ways.Food/Décor/Service: 4.0/3.2/3.6"}, {"review_id": "6mcsuRXx9oLaryneFrIiyg", "user_id": "ow3XGyeWdSzX71JqcHjKVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Wow the pancakes were fantastic.  Blueberry with  brown sugar the beat.  Great atmosphere as well.

Not hot. So bad the cheese isn't melted! Veggies weren't fresh and the plate was watery. My guess is they precook the veggies then dump them into the cooked eggs cold and watery. The mushrooms are canned and may not even have been heated. I will not be back to Pamela's. A place that prides themselves on breakfast should be ashamed to serve such a terrible omelet. On a positive note, I was not charged for the omelet or my coffee. I should have tipped the waitress, but I was so upset I just left.

But that isn't much of an issue because they have two dining areas and keep the queue moving pretty quickly. The service isn't really friendly, but it's efficient. And to be honest, that's more important in a tight, cramped, busy diner like Pamela's. I ordered a broccoli, cheddar and ham omelet, which was loaded with real, off-the-bone ham. It could have used more broccoli, but it was still very good. My wife, who loves poached eggs, had to settle for basted because they don't have the ability to poach (I don't understand why). She wasn't crazy about the greasiness of them, nor was she too happy with the canned side of fruit. So it's a mixed review for us. I liked it; her, not so much. What we do agree on though is that it is still second to DeLuca's when it comes to breakfast in the Strip District (and maybe third when you factor in Kelly O's)."}, {"review_id": "W4LwhuS3-oUqsWp-z70zlw", "user_id": "7pUvLy2xnztzc4PTW7U6Qg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Typical diner atmosphere, giant portions.Cash only so stop before you dine.
