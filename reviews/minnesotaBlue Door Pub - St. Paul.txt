If you prefer a more traditional burger, you can't go wrong with the Classic. Fries/tots are $3 extra, but do yourself a favor and spend $3.50 for a side of fried green beans instead. They also have an awesome late night happy hour starting at 9pm--I recommend the fried pickles or the totchos. There's not a ton of seating at this location, but if you go for a later dinner around 7:30pm, you shouldn't have an issue getting seated within minutes. Also note that there's a parking lot around the side/back of the restaurant!"}, {"review_id": "-TFdP2wkd6W9CxuDLJeWVw", "user_id": "iCYMf_sHRevmzWg8la-LVw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "I was really excited for some cheese curds, tater tots, and a juicy lucy for my last meal in MN. Well, Blue Door is not the place for that and I was majorly disappointed.It's a small shop and the hostess wanted to offer us the table right by the front door in the 30 degree weather. No thank you. Grabbed the last booth by the kitchen.First, I ordered a diet coke, and there were zero bubbles. It tasted HORRIBLE! I asked for a new one and the waiter assured me it was right this time but nope...awful. Ended up with an Arnold Palmer.Then our cajun tater tots and cheese curds arrived. The tots had WAY too much seasoning I could barely eat it. So salty. The cheese curds had barely any cheese and was just eating fried bits.For my Blucy, I got the Merriam Park, and it was just okay. The meat was way overcooked.If anything I wish our waiter was attentive. When I went to the bathroom the other orders of tots were not red like ours. Although I would've liked to mention the two apps were inedible before we got our bill, my friend didn't when I went to the bathroom. We told him afterwards and they said it was a new cook who was getting the hang of it. Although I can totally understand that, it was a waste of $ and food and a bad way to leave MN with inedible food."}, {"review_id": "w_uz0m0BBRBmVjpkVEsWRg", "user_id": "Z8S87EDY2BxRFZb-DR26dg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "Guys guys guys guys GUYS. What's taken me so long to get here? Why has nobody told me how freaking good this place is? I came here with a few friends on a weekend and, keeping in mind that the wait is standard, we hung out for a little bit. It moves quickly though, so we were seated in about 20 minutes. For a party of 4, I won't complain. Once seated, the entire meal moves quickly. Started with drinks, they had a pretty good selection and something for everybody. We ordered a few appetizers for the table - I strongly recommend the fried green beans and fried pickles. They came out quickly and piping hot. Taste-wise, you really can't go too wrong with fried food, but they managed to step things up a little with quality ingredients (aka fresh green beans, Y.U.M.) and delicious dipping sauces. On to the next thing... the burgers. I went for a stuffed burger and made it a jiffy. I chickened out and went for a more standard burger (think just cheese), since the jiffy-style should be the shining star. That bacon and peanut butter were just STELLAR. Like you think you like bacon and you think you like peanut butter, but have you ever had BOTH on a burger? Yeah, it's pretty dang good.Overall just a huge fan. I loved it and I do plan on returning."}, {"review_id": "jDwyWVyqV6Arg9qNSaXJSg", "user_id": "lMBpgONeVL0BFyHM16i_5Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "Finally tried this location out and was as pleased as the first time I went to BDP's Como location!Came here on a Monday evening around 4:30, and my boyfriend and I got seated right away. We took advantage of happy hour and got 2 beers ($3.50 each, I believe). For burgers, we both got the Merriam Park Blucy and loved it. (The contrasting flavors of blue cheese, cranberry relish, and bacon were spot on.) Only negative comment I had was the temp of the burger--could've been hotter, but it wasn't cool enough to send it back. The order of fries we split, however, was hot, and the perfect portion to share! The space did really fill up around 5, so I'm glad we got there early. (It's a bit cramped and an awkward space with the door in the middle of the bustle of the restaurant, but they make it work!)"}, {"review_id": "NWTYtyw6_xJogpEowy4hYg", "user_id": "vLn5BGb_8wzmEvsgwZC3RQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Go here for \"different\" juicy lucys... not for the original.  The Bangkok (mozzarella soaked in coconut milk with an Asian slaw on top and curry sipping sauce) used to be on the menu and was amazing, but sadly they got rid of it.

Here's the gist, we started with a couple beers, WIN.Then we had the bacon wrapped/cream cheese filled jalapeños. Those were FANTASTIC. As my buddy put it, it's \"exactly what an appetizer is supposed to do. It was just a snack that gets you ready for what's to come and totally hit the spot\". I couldn't agree more. It was great.Then we had the Cajun redux Blucy. Yum. Peppers and fries and bubbling hot cheese. The place was packed and we still managed to get in and out in about 70 minutes. Thanks for hosting a great conversation and totally hitting the spot. Can't ask for anything more.

If you ask me, there are a lot of \"hipster\" places that get high ratings. But, the food doesn't measure up to that IMHO. Everything is good, just not great. But if I am going to get a burger, this isn't where I go. A burger shouldn't need all the fancy toppings to be good. I just didn't experience the meat itself as being wonderful. I do love the creative toppings, on the other hand. The bun, meh, really not for me. Too soft, too white bun-y, just doesn't stand up to holding the burger and those toppings. Lots of grease. Not so complex flavors. The atmosphere is loud, busy, just kind of meh, too."}, {"review_id": "GhT8wmvSCwSXr-Na_bRcyw", "user_id": "aifGelrssPylK7ZiGKHVAA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/10/2017", "text": "Came here for lunch on a Saturday and it was very busy! Despite that we only waited about 15 minutes for a table outside in the cold and rain instead of the 20 or so the guy told us. I got the Jiffy burger as I'm a sucker for peanut butter on a burger. The burger was absolutely dripping with crunchy peanut butter and I was in heaven! The fries were decent, but the tater tots were definitely better. I'm glad my sister let me trade half of my fries for her tots! Probably one of the best burgers I've had in the cities. I can see why they are so popular and have so many locations.

I guess people do drink mass produced beers, but something local would be nice too.

We would like to sit at the remaining one. Still, she doesn't want to. She wants us to wait, you know , in case a group comes in out of the rain. That's when I said forget it. I will not eat there.
