At first I was very skeptical about trying this place since it's almost just a hole in the wall and I looked at their reviews so ended up wanting to try it. It is one of my favorite places to eat. The food is full of flavor and prices are great! A place to definitely try. I've been here several times now and never disappointed. It seems like they stay pretty busy so be ready to wait. They don't have very many tables and not a whole lot of place to stand and wait. Usually I've seen people go back to their car and when they see people leave, they come back in. It's worth the wait"}, {"review_id": "iuEGl5Jso0hm0U1-AO1L_w", "user_id": "vewPPZ4GWHQf2u_UWUU9Dw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "Visiting from out of town, a friend took me to this \"hole in the wall\".  It was mid afternoon and this place was packed.  Good sign!  The place is small.  I imagine there's a bit of a wait for lunch and dinner. We were fortunate, someone was just leaving when we walked in, opening up a table.  Chips and salsa, excellent!Queso dip, yum, excellent!Enchiladas, excellent!I didn't want to eat too much since dinner was just a couple of hours away. So we split an order of enchiladas. After the first bite, I wished I had this all to myself!While the food was excellent, I gave 3 stars for lack of bathroom cleanliness. It wasn't slightly dirty but filthy and that's a bit concerning at a food establishment.  If I had used the restroom first, I probably wouldn't have eaten there."}, {"review_id": "92M0DxxAKf1Yyd3zzf6Elw", "user_id": "9M-PF1TdRLp-CKzjpfcsWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Love this place. Highly suggest the carnitas tacos. They're my favorite, they run small so 4 tacos isn't hard to finish. They serve hot salsa & boy is it yummy but don't forget about the queso its delicious.

I mean good with a capital G.  The special arriero and AL Pastor were my favorites but all are excellent.  The place was packed and it's small so be aware of that.  And who can argue with a meal so good that costs around $12...For TWO!?Of note: the warm salsa was new to me but I couldn't get enough of it.  A perfect, savory partner for tortilla chips"}, {"review_id": "hlkK0XziSmF9fVeQwGH8Mg", "user_id": "SHcdv7s62blLpVb8x0XDaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/18/2017", "text": "Service: 4/5 this place has its regulars and being my first time I kinda stuck out.

You might have to wait by the door which is awkward at a busy mealtime.  Once my mom and I were seated in a comfy booth, all was well.  I was very excited about the two types of sauces and to try the salsa; however, the warm salsa was way too hot for me.  The red/Rojo sauce was also too hot for me. The green sauce was mild enough for me to use.  When I read about the warm salsa, I thought the salsa would be similar to the warm salsa at La Hacienda - which I adore.  However, as stated, the salsa was way too hot for a typical consumer, and I did not like the flavor.  I've been trying to find a new favorite Mexican restaurant for quite some time, since my favorite, La Hacienda, went downhill inside the restaurant.  The green Verde sauce was pleasant, and I was able to use that.  It should be noted that I cannot eat super spicy foods because of stomach issues. The white cheese dip was as expected and was similar to any cheese dip that you would get at a chain restaurant.  The chips were very light and crunchy - not oily at all.  I ordered the combination fajitas, and the meat was cooked expertly.  The steak and chicken were both super tender and seasoned well.  The prices are very fair here.  I have never been to a restaurant where I can order fajitas at such a low price.  The rice and beans were just as expected, and nothing really stood out about them. From the rave reviews, my mother ordered the Tacos Arriero.  They looked very fresh with large slices of avocado on each of the street-sized tacos.  She enjoyed the flavors; but, the chorizo had a lot of gristle in it and was too hard for her to chew.  I do not know if this was just a bad day for this restaurant or if the sausage is like that all of the time.  If I ever feel like a very large potion of fajitas with all of the sides and need a budget conscious meal, then I would return to this restaurant, and I am curious to try other menu items."}, {"review_id": "E94S7zX2juU9SOT33L5WHg", "user_id": "cnQa-kMhaPdnv7SnAtOSaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/11/2017", "text": "The best authentic Mexican in town.

Sadly, that's the only positive to Palenque. After leaving another so called Mexican restaurant, we came here only to be almost as disappointed. Once again, boiling hot tomato water salsa (what the hell is with this in Little Rock???). I have Mexican friends and they are even perplexed by this pathetic hot water salsa. For entrees we ordered tacos and a torta, both of which were nearly tasteless. We had chicken in both and it was clearly unmarinated and had no spices on it. The taco sauces in the bottle were ok, nothing stellar. This was all such a disappointment given the range and complexity of Mexican cuisine. Maybe the standards are low for this area. If this place was in TX or CA it would never be able to remain open. This is very sub standard Mexican food. Don't waste your time here.
