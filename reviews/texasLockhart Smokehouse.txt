Because that would be Lockhart. My husband and I stop in here and spoil ourselves every time we come to Dallas. We find it difficult to find BBQ so good that sauce is optional instead of necessary, and Lockhart is definitely one of those places. His favorite is the brisket; Mine, the turkey. Both are smoked to perfection and have SO MUCH flavor packed in that sauce almost takes away from it! Their mac and cheese is some of the best we've ever had, smooth and creamy and obviously from scratch, not that cheap stuff that congeals as it cools off. We also had the opportunity to try their peach cobbler for the first time tonight and to be honest, it didn't look terribly impressive in the pan. But the flavor... Again, obviously homemade from scratch, with a crunchy cinnamon sugar crust and sweet, mushy peaches. It's safe to say that we ate ourselves into a food coma, but it's so good that we are already snacking on the leftovers an hour later! Beware that you'll be paying for the quality you're receiving. We were a little taken by surprise by the prices the first time we went in, but honestly, it's worth every penny. Extra star for having Big Red on fountain tap. Taste of my childhood, right there.We love you, Lockhart!"}, {"review_id": "qM3eCkPC2adaqQQyHK-lJQ", "user_id": "DY9hpNROo0bLmwSubdaQtQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "A true bbq place. No plates. Eat with your hands, and waxed wrapping paper as your plate. Place is loud, food is hard core bbq. As you order, they cut the meat right out there hot from the smoker. The taste is full of flavor. Great food. Briskets are tender & cook nicely. Shoulder pork is too dry to my taste. Sausages are great as the ribs. Another place to look forward next time I am in Dallas area."}, {"review_id": "ACRejcTZpe3ZQbV823u5ow", "user_id": "9bnvU4rRbIquYcpa1DFkuA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Lockhart is a true BBQ place! Clean but with some dirty flair in the air :) just like a good BBQ shack should be. Lines move fast, BBQ is warm and served wrapped. No plastic plates - I like that! You can pick up a cold glass bottled coke from the cooler while waiting. After you eat pick up your own mess and throw in the trash - I like that too! Pork Ribs - Great Brisket - Great Smoked Sausage - Ok Mac N Cheese - hummmm I would come up with a better version of it.

I ordered the brisket with slaw and beans as sides.  We then walked back up front and found a table and ordered a few beers from the bar. The brisket was awesome and I really liked the slaw, beans good as well with chunks of meat mixed with the beans. Good section of beer too.

My parents ordered brisket, turkey, potato salad, and baked beans.The brisket was cut thick and very good. If you come here for anything I would highly recommend the brisket and that's about It. The sausage was also pretty good and my parents said they like the turkey. The sides were kinda blah. The potato salad was very bland and It seemed like something was missing. The beans were spicy but had a lot of extra stuff in It. Seemed like every spoonful was more onion, jalapeño, etc than beans.I heard they aren't about bbq sauce and if that's the case It was very true. You could buy stubs bbq from the store and It would taste better than what they had. Overall this place was okay.

The food is always good and the lines are usually long (those two things go hand-in-hand). I wanted to try the pork chop, but they were \"out...\" at 11:35a on a Wednesday? I settled for the pulled pork and a sausage link. It was delicious. The other guys in my group each got the beef rib (only available on Wednesday) and they all loved it. It looked good, but I'm more of a pork BBQ guy... cows are for steak night! If you're going for the first time, consider having each person order something different and sharing.

Tried the half chicken and beans. The beans were edible, but that damn bird was raw, like Golem's preference for fish, \"raw and wriggley.\" My guess is it was not smoked for the adequate amount of time because not only was it pink, raw and wriggley, it was not smokey tasting, so bland. Couldn't eat it. Atmosphere, well... we were greeted and directed to the back to order, which was nice because I wouldn't have known where to start. It kind of felt like going into a back alley behind a speak easy to make a shady transaction. It was dark and everyone was whispering. Then... I saw HIM. Dear, lawd! I know anywhere with food is going to have pests and I'm not trying to scare anyone away with this, but I can't leave this highlight out of my review. I think he was the boss. He was the hugest, most brazen cockroach I've ever seen. He strutted out from behind the \"sides\" case all cocky and gave me the look, \"how you doin'?\" It took every thing in me to not shriek. So much self control.

The restaurant is located in Bishop Art District. The moment you entered the restaurant, you could smell the smoke of BBQ. All the meat were sitting on a butcher table and you ordered by pounds.My husband and I ordered 1/2 brisket, 1/2 pork ribs, and one jalapeño sausage plus two small sides (mac'n cheese and beans). It was a lot of food and we ended up packing some back to the hotel. The brisket and ribs we ordered were super tender and seasoned well (you could just eat it without sauce!)"}, {"review_id": "Q60WsftMSX0_DDAXbiO2bg", "user_id": "RVagGrcHdy1HB7-_c9ywZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "For the record, I'd be a terrible Texan. As many times as I've visited the Lonestar State, I've never made my way to an authentic BBQ joint, and it IS for a lack of trying. I love me some potato salad and Mac and cheese, but I've never been a fan of pulled pork or ribs. Maybe it's the sauce. I'm not a BBQ sauce person. The nice thing about Texas BBQ is that they are better known for brisket, which is something I can get behind. I'm not going to be back to Texas for a few months, so I decided now was a good time as any to finally try some authentic Texas 'cue.I don't believe the Lockhart I visited is the original, but that didn't take away from its charm. It's located right in the middle of the Bishop Arts district, which I highly recommend taking a day to hang out in. Anywho, I walked in and you immediately get the feel of the place. You can smell the barbecue instantly, and the restaurant is decorated just like the kitschy Pinterest friend that has the perfect theme parties would have it. The sitting area & bar is in the front, but you walk to the back counter to order your goodies. In the display case prior to ordering, you'll find the cold sides, including blue cheese slaw and the all powerful potato salad. When I got up to the counter to order my hot sides and meat, I came across a difficult dilemma. I obviously wanted the brisket, but they had smoked wings on special for Monday. Do I want smoked wings? Or do I want jalapeño sausage? Why do I need so much food? I've already ordered two sides; who's eating all this food Stephanie!? Whatever, YOLO I went and decided on the jalapeño sausage as my second meat. I was promptly given my meats or choice and scurried over to the bar to grab a complimenting beer. I started off with the potato salad (after drinking a 1/4 of my beer, I hadn't had one in a minute ya know!?) and my god was it amazing! The flavors were very different; it had a nice kick to it and even had BRISKET IN IT. I was shook. I mean, I've heard of putting bacon in it, but brisket!? To all you Yelpers with the bland potato salad - were we eating the same thing? Are you sure you were at the same restaurant as me? It was THAT good. I moved on to the sausage after the potato salad experience. It was honestly a disappointment. I was really regretting not getting the wings. The casing for the sausage was too tough; I'm all about the snap but this was just chewy and not very appealing to my taste sense. I threw the majority of it out and quickly moved onto the brisket. I decided to grab my foe, BBQ sauce, to help the brisket create a sandwich with the bread that's always attached to orders. The brisket was very tender and didn't need the sauce; I actually ate my leftovers sans sauce. The last thing I tried was the mac and cheese, which I found to taste like a grown up version of KFC macaroni. It was actually tastier as leftovers as well. Lockhart is very delicious, and I would recommend it if you're going for that bona fide barbecue experience. There are too many joints for me to try in the state to come here again in the near future, but if you're insisting on going there, I certainly wouldn't complain."}, {"review_id": "YxcinKMCTQ7WGV_2-hKSbg", "user_id": "iMjbxJo9xCgWJHEbOP-7bg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "Wanted something fast and good in bishop arts so walked in here to an amazing smell of delicious barbecue! You walk up to order and I really wanted turkey but it was all gone for the day. I settled for chicken and a small piece of jalapeño sausage which is beef and pork mixed together. I also got some of their house special coleslaw which has sriracha mixed in! We found a table then unrolled our paper with all the meats inside. They have an area where you can get unlimited pickles, onions, jalapeños and barbecue sauce. The sauce has a bit of spice to it, in fact everything does so if spicy isn't your thing then you might not like this for barbecue. The chicken was so yummy. I attempted using their plastic fork and knife then said enough and ate with my hands. The sausage was so good but my tummy didn't like it so good thing I got a small amount. The coleslaw is AMAZING!

I love how they have the wonder bread, a BBQ staple in Texas. The line isn't intimidating and you can make it through in about 20 minutes or so. I'd highly recommend this restaurant.

Your results are guaranteed to be different in the other items to review. I went to a large catered affair and Lockharts was the caterer. Clint Boyer was in town for Nascar and I went to see a business who was giving out free food at a \"meet Clint event\". Double bonus!The brisket was very good. It passed the weight test with flying colors (Do pick it up and it fall apart on its own weight). Very moist and smokey with a nice bark. The guy cutting it would serve just about any piece that you wanted.Low points for the sausage/hot dogs. The pan said sausage, the server and my mouth told me it was just a hot dog. I hope the poor folks didn't pay for sausage and new what they were buying.The beans were kicking. Great and savory baked beans with a kick to them. The potato salad was the BEST thing about the meal. I've had \"Cajun style\" potato salad and this was just a spicy Texas style potato salad. Had nothing like it before and really enjoyed it.The cold slaw was another low. Not as low as hot dogs masquerading as sausage, but just not as good. Had a kick to them, but nothing much else redeeming.Overall the food was great. Make sure you pick well, though. The servers were top notch so I expect the wait staff at the restaurant to be the same.

It was some of the worst I'd ever had. Dickey's is better than what I had here today.  The brisket was dry, hard, and lacked any smoke or flavor. The Mac n cheese was good but nothing special.
