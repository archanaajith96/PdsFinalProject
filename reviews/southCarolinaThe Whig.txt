This place is best experienced with no expectations in mind. You just wander in, order some appetizers and enjoy the ambiance! However, if you must need a review then this is a damn fine dive bar. My fav is the cheese fries with ranch on the side with a Whig burger. Menu selection is small but I feel like for this place it's perfect and not overwhelming. Very simple and relaxing place to hang out!"}, {"review_id": "Z6GkjqTXU_s-s2ZzYNMczA", "user_id": "TPNeU81MN_o4kOo2jy4thw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/12/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We went to visit The Whig on our last visit to Columbia. They have not changed or cleaned up much, but I guess that is part of the charm of the place. They have changed the menu some, no pizza anymore and added more vegetarian items.I ordered a veggie gyro and my friend ordered a BLT, each came with a choice of sweet potato fries or regular fries. I chose the regular, my friend  picked the sweet potato fries. The food was delicious. Veggie gyro was tasty and the fries were seasoned with the perfect amount of spice. Service is great, food is very good, a perfect pub choice."}, {"review_id": "uWr55rRMqG4eKL62HQJv5Q", "user_id": "JY75x_X9cWKKm88Vh8hc5w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/19/2018", "text": "For a grungy bar, it's not bad. It is located in the basement of ABC Columbia, entering the first time seems a little weird. Once inside, it is often difficult to find a seat because there are only approximately 10 tables and there is no waitlist, you just have to hover to claim a table as people leave. With that being said, I often feel rushed out by other patrons waiting for a table. Ordering is done at the bar and it can be hard to get the lone (sometimes 2) bartender's attention. The atmosphere is pretty hipster, but it's loud. Beer selection is one of the best around. I would recommend The Whig Chicken Sandwich!"}, {"review_id": "V5zPH201FNEtzfe3-mVOmA", "user_id": "2r4LzNvrPYDsqxeaCVIVIA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Such a neat little hangout spot hidden on Main Street! We headed here after dinner to grab a brew.. We had a little bit of trouble finding the place because it is at basement level. Look for the sign!! It is small and dimly lit, giving it an exclusive feel. It has a good selection of brews, both local and not. The decor is neat, ranging from stuffed wildlife to a winding staircase holding speakers to vintage looking dangling lights. It has a casual vibe and appears to be a local favorite for good reason. We looked over the food menu which was small but loaded with great options, including Gouda Mac and Cheese.  We all agreed next time we are in town we will grab dinner here. Highly recommend checking it out!"}, {"review_id": "5PKdSV760rh1pMa91pBt5A", "user_id": "gFR15h-i_s8CZLQRF2NnSA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "I'm 100%, without a single doubt, not hip enough to come here.

He speaks with a cadence that suggests an intent to reassure, that I ought to be relieved by its inauthenticity.'What frightful hand or eye...'It is not the only portent of death in this subterranean dive. The skeleton of a rooster stands erect in his cage, waiting to crow for a sunrise that he'll never see from his perch beneath the horizon. A stuffed bobcat carries a stuffed mink in her jaws, unaware that she herself is no more alive than her prey. They are far more than decoration, here; this place is their tomb.A strong-voiced woman sits down at the bar, and is immediately recognized by all who surround her. \"I had the strangest dream last night,\" she tells the other regulars. \"I couldn't go outside because my house was being circled by tigers. They were watching me through the windows, waiting for me to leave.\" She is undisturbed by the skull of such a predator enshrined right before her eyes; it is background noise to her, as familiar as the rest of her companions.'In what oven was thy brain?'In Blake's \"Tyger,\" he writes of God's creation as a thing of horror; the poem is a song of experience, of shaken faith. The brushstrokes of the creator are evinced by the creature's dawn-striped fur, yet its stomach is filled with the blood of innocent creatures. Its bondage to sin reflects our own: in its hunt, we see all that we as mortals are coerced to do in spite of our souls. It is the devil, but it is a sympathetic devil; the one who pitied Job, who understands human torment.In the underworld of the Whig, an effigy of that very beast is on display, slain in a time that borders myth. All are complicit in the ritual celebration of its death that follows. Its blood is consumed as a sacrament of Bourbon which washes away the knowledge of good and evil in place of original sin. It's a false communion, but for the right kind of person, it does just more than enough; though their sins remain unforgiven, they are nevertheless freed from their guilt.It is only in the morning that follows that they come to realize just what it is that they have done. Through the haze of inebriation, however faint, they remember killing the tiger themselves, and partaking of its flesh. Their regrets are reborn, transubstantiated by mysteries of the liver. \"It's a replica,\" the bartender tells me. He speaks with a cadence that suggests an intent to reassure, that I ought to be relieved by its inauthenticity. I can't say that I am. Last night, I dreamt of being entangled in a bramble of black stripes, unable to stop its teeth from sinking into my throat."}, {"review_id": "ru8F2mXzaJLjPcaCeiE5ZQ", "user_id": "iw08nr6Py0vIkLDxVHR2nQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/29/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Still my favorite bar in Columbia.

We walked right past it and our Uber driver dropped us right at the entrance. Once you find the stairs to the basement, you walk into a really cool, very divey eccentric bar. There is a bank vault that is a separate room where you can gather about 6- 10 people on the couches and leather back chairs. Great amount of tables and a few booths laid about the rest of the 'cozy' dining area. Bar has about 10 seats. They do have a good selection of tap (local beers) and bottles. We had the burger and grill cheese (separately). The burger was huge and delicious. Nice and thick and meaty. The grill cheese was just as good with a nice ratio of cheese to bread. crispy and ooey gooey. Definitely recommend one of the two of these for food. And the fries are delicious. For a dive bar, the food was plentiful and delicious and not dive \"bar\"-y at all. The atmosphere is eclectic and fun, great pieces all over the place for conversation. Im so glad someone told me about this place, as I will definitely come back every time I am in columbia. If you can find it, give it a try (and the grilled cheese too) :)"}, {"review_id": "MRqriTUOzIkgeN-37MZTvQ", "user_id": "O_-EMEYwYSq-_v_7NlS5iA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/20/2017", "text": "Steve, our bartender was friendly and gave us some pointers as to where to go to see the Eclipse tomorrow.I didn't get to try the food because the kitchen was closed.

This place fit the bill. Firstly, lets all keep in mind that it is a dive bar. Dive bars aren't known for insanely detailed/fancy service, so keep it at that. My food arrived in an order I actually didn't expect: app first, then entree. I didn't ask for this, but that extra step was pretty cool. I had feta pesto dip first... amazing, and a HUGE portion for the cost. I could have eaten this alone and would have been full. It's deliciously bold as it should be with those ingredients, a hint on the salty side but I'm into that. I'm going to dream of this dish for days. Also ordered a chicken gyro and sweet potato fries. Didn't expect this to be much more than bar food, but it exceeded all expectations. Hunks of fresh tomatoes paired with sautéed veggies and (what I think were cause they were so good) homemade fries... yes please! Oh and I sat at the bar right in their bar pass area like a butthole and the bartender was still nice and helped me maneuver my 14 course meal for one around."}, {"review_id": "QWwyIXZkWhe_ima0zxIIKw", "user_id": "uMB7S_Ij5P7UGAlRmnIgyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/11/2017", "text": "Outstanding basement dive bar.  This is a subterranean hole in the wall with fun grungy atmosphere, efficient and personable bartenders, and a truly outstanding beer selection.  The porter was terrific.   Wonderful old-school music selection played at relaxed volume for conversation.  Because I was there on Taco Tuesday, that was the only food option.  Unless you're a vegetarian, for sure get the beef and bean version.  Very basic tacos but very tasty.  Hey, it's a dive bar; what more can you want? The prices are so low on both beers and tacos that I thought they'd made a mistake on my tab until the statuesque bartender assured me it was correct.  One caveat:  I love dive bars, and this is one of the best, but the unisex bathrooms would surely test the tolerance of female patrons.  If sketchy bathrooms put you off, you're not going to be happy with them.  I really really like this bar, and it'll be a regular stop whenever future travel takes me to Columbia.  And while I'm at it, if you're traveling to Columbia, for God's sake stay downtown.  The whole Main Street area is really enjoyable."}, {"review_id": "0eSrhRX5iGprsFGmJN4ENw", "user_id": "9EMnuKGMd6ZSspRc1stmLg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "One of the very few good spots in Columbia.

It's in a basement under a business building, I probably wouldn't have known it was there if I hadn't heard about it. They have various burgers and sandwiches along with a few salads and appetizers. My boyfriend got \"The Whig Burger\" and I got the \"Berger Burger\" with sweet potato fries. Both were delicious! The meat was high quality and juicy. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the fact they don't have servers. You seat yourself and go to the bar to order everything. That wouldn't be an issue normally but it was very busy on a Saturday. My boyfriend had to get up and wait in line for our refills and any time we needed something. I really enjoyed the atmosphere otherwise. They have some interesting old decor which compliments the fact the restaurant is in an old basement.

My biggest beef is the service. They cater very much to their regulars and are snippy and/or inattentive to other customers. P.S.
