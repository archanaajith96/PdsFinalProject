I got a sausage and egg sandwich that was really good, as well as the coffee which was excellent. The lady was really friendly and she came to our table to take our order and told us about the menu. I also got a banana nut muffin that was just about perfect - not soggy, not stale and crunchy, just right. The star attraction is a cheese cake, chocolate cake combo that is so sweet and rich it will just about take your teeth off. I had a couple bites, as did my partner, but that was about it. I say one piece could serve like 8 or even 10 people ... it is awesome, but dude..."}, {"review_id": "qUW5T-j3YHEaT2dQ-CKR9A", "user_id": "8YchmQhQh5QKYF1eiZilAQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "I really wanted to like this place and judging by the presentation I thought that I was going to have a hard time not going back every day! Unfortunately, the baked ziti was mediocre, but the real let down was the cheesecake stuffed chocolate cake, that wasn't even worth finishing (it actually may have been the first time in my life that I threw cake away; especially a slice I paid $5 for). The first bite was of a bit of the frosting, that I was expecting to be cream cheese frosting, but instead was the gritty sugary crap that tasted like it was out of a tub, but I didn't care because it still looked so damn good; I could feel the moist chocolate cake mixing with the perfectly smooth and sweet cheesecake in my mouth before it even got there; then BAM, a mouth of crap! The chocolate cake was overly sweet and slightly dry while the cheesecake filling was bland cream cheese with some crumbly something that I can only assume was supposed to be cheesecake crust. I literally stared at this beautiful creation, that made angels sing in my head, and wondered how in the hell it tasted so unappealing. I tried several more bites, convinced I must have just had bad bites... but I was wrong. The cake is crap. It looks like heaven and taste like hell. Sad day."}, {"review_id": "SeLcdVqLa11jRWM8CUrn1Q", "user_id": "bPIMhxjAfK1wknpk9A6bsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/12/2017", "text": "Fresh ingredients homemade, coffee is delicious and customer service is five star kid friendly and great pastries too.

I see all of these great reviews and wanted to leave one too, but I just couldn't stretch 3 stars. I first ordered a breakfast sandwich with no meat (I do not eat pork). I could hear the staff mentioning how strange that was. It's pretty rude to speak about a customer me they can hear you. When I received my sandwich, it was a bit flavorless. I guess they rely on the taste of bacon or sausage for the sandwich. I asked for an ice coffee. I was a little disappointed the young lady told me there were no options for ice coffee. So if I want ice coffee, I guess the only choice is the house blend, which is ok. I asked for a small amount of cream with no sugar. The coffee I received contained so much cream the color could be described as an \"off-white\". I can't even tell you of the quality of the coffee because all I could taste was cream. Unless asking for a small amount of something in Mississippi means \"go to town with that sucker!\", this was so disappointing. I also ordered a cinnamon muffin pastry. I don't like sweets much but I thought I'd try it because they had so many in display. This was nice, too sweet for me. I couldn't finish it, but if you like pastries, this place might be for you. And this is pretty much where I'm getting the 2 stars from. To all those who left rave reviews, I'm glad you've found a nice place for you, but this is just not for me."}, {"review_id": "1ivxq7OvusCGlndyTlQx0w", "user_id": "VKI-sNmbRBB4imiPPBHODw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/13/2017", "text": "This is such a fantastic place to eat!!!!!

The girl at the register was friendly and their menu is cheap. However, I was disappointed in their lack of baked goods.

I was expecting croissants, turnovers, cookies, fruit bars, tarts, etc. I saw some small chocolate chip cookies in a jar by register that didn't look very inviting or fresh, so I didn't bother.
