Needless to say, today we made reservations for dinner. There were four of us, a couple people had beer (some local brews) and we had starter olives and Brussels. Everyone liked the starters and the service was good - we didn't wait too long for our mains. My colleague and I each got a pizza, I got the mushroom / truffle one and she got the prosciutto / arugula one. Our other coworkers got pasta, and then went ahead and got a fennel sausage pizza as well. The food was great, service was good. Waited a bit for the check but we were chatting so I dunno if he didn't want to interrupt. Recommend if you like salad, pasta, and pizza. Pizza is thin ish crust and great quality toppings!"}, {"review_id": "lHy1SgdVHaGN4mpBqr0Avg", "user_id": "Dipv8e6x0Thy6PTZ2EvDPw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Sadly, a terrible experience. First, although I've had lunch and dinner indoors here many times previously, I don't think I'll be back again. Why is it 'self-service' if you sit outside???!!The hostess said we could seat ourselves. Okay,  but had to walk back inside for menus. Had to awkwardly walk into the middle of a sorority party to get our own waters after being told that we order our own food with the bartender outside, even though we sat at a booth. After standing at the bar window behind people getting drinks, we were finally able to order dinner. Btw, why on earth are the pasta dishes unavailable outside, when everything is prepared in the same kitchen? Out of habit, I tipped 20% to later realize that was a waste of money as, well, WHAT SERVICE?Back to ordering - after paying I stood around waiting for the iced tea I had requested  (not sure if I was charged for it as I was only given the receipt with totals), only to be told they don't have iced tea outside. To his credit, he must have realized I was annoyed as he offered to go get one from inside. No sugar was brought with the iced tea. Walk back over and wait for a water refill. Meanwhile the food comes out. No napkins, thanks. Walked back inside to request napkins and joked about the self service being weird. The server just stared at me and handed me a giant stack of restroom napkins. Yes, the tri-fold industrial type.Sigh.So disappointed. I expected a nice meal and service....."}, {"review_id": "VDuw8cHR2sXjrq_kieu2iw", "user_id": "Z16OsDnJl1aOkutLuEm7zQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "When going out for an evening in Tucson why wouldn't you start your party here? This is a terrific place to get the party started. Put on your drinking shoes, here we go. The local scoop is to go downstairs (a speakeasy ) and order the special. The Special is an ice cold can of regular Coors beer and a shot of whiskey. This little party starter pairing is a $4 treat. That's a tremendous value!  After a couple of those special alcohol pairings, walk upstairs and go behind the restaurant, and there you'll find a pizza parlor. They create and bake a beautiful pizza with fresh ingredients.  Have it your way! Order the toppings you like. It's time to carb load and probably a good idea to soak up some of that alcohol you just consumed - your personal pizza is a perfect choice. Now that you've enjoyed a couple of drink specials and filled up on delicious pizza, you are ready to go out on the town for the evening.  Call Lyft or Uber, at this point it's much smarter and more safe than driving around Tucson.

The Strozzapreti is my favorite, followed closely by the tagliatelle and the margherita pizza. Their pasta is really the star of the show in my book, it tastes as if they make the actual noodles there in house (no idea if they do but their just THAT good) and their sauces all have great depth of flavor. I also recommend the chocolate budino for dessert. I love that there is three distinct vibes here. We came here for Valentine's Day and it was very romantic (food and service were also stellar which is not a given on Valentine's Day) but the back and basement serve well for other moods.

Nothing crazy memorable but i know it wasn't bad. Then all of a sudden, I come here on a random Tuesday for lunch and BAM, I'm in love.   Their chef's board is amazing! Chorizo spread, some sort of bleu cheese fusion cheese, some fruit-based spread. Let me tell you. I don't like bleu cheese but I gobbled it all up. I don't like fruit (I know, I know) gobbled that up too! Then we split a pizza--half crimini mushroom and half arugula & prosciutto. Both were great but you MUST try the crimini mushroom pizza. They stole the show. Our server recommended it to us and I swear we were ready to worship her for the amazing recommendation. Also, they have tres leches tiramisu!! It borderlines on too sweet but i have a major sweet tooth so i was in LOVE.We've also thrown a surprise birthday party for my mother-in-law in their back room by the beer garden. Did i mention there's a beer garden? The place in itself is quite cute and cozy. Very good for date night, lunch with friends, girls night or even a large birthday bash. Obviously you call to reserve the room, but all in all a solid place. Their pizzas are thin and crispy and fresh and hearty all at the same time.

I recently had their Wheat Berry salad and it was worth going back just for the salad. Keep in mind, it's a $12 salad. They do have a nice lunch special with is a 6in pizza and side salad for $12.

I would like to see a vegetarian option with protien- tofu, beans, etc (not just carbs like pasta and pizza). The food we ordered was a mixed bag. The Truffle fries and salad were tasty but the brussel sprouts were disgusting. I'm not sure if we just got a bad batch or if they are always intended to be over saturated and sriracha sauce.

I ordered truffle fries and the calabrian salami pizza.The truffle fries had a delicious lemon zesty-ish flavor that may have been either the topping on the fries or the sauce itself. However, the fries themselves were soggy and cut too short. I had to grab a handful of the fries at once to get a good taste. There was not enough sauce (aioli) for me to dip in AND the small bowl holding the aioli was way too small.The calabrian salami pizza was small, expensive ($16) and tasted meh. I'm not even quite sure how to describe it. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't good.

Gooey, cheesy, carb loaded pizza. I was not anticipating the remarkableness of this place when I strolled in on a weekday evening. The restaurant was busy, which was a good sign on a weekday. Reilly is located in this beautiful, historically renovated building filled with so much culture and antiquity. I was seated a few minutes after checking in with the hostess and approached by the wait staff quickly after. The restaurant has a dim, intimate vibe and a full bar with seating. There is also bar seating right in front of the open kitchen where you can witness pizza dough being tossed. How cool is that?! Another cool feature, a beer garden with 40 rotating beers. The dinner menu features some irresistible options but I went with the goat cheese toast as an appetizer and a half Yukon gold potato and half prosciutto pizza.The toast was served crispy (four pieces) topped with local goat cheese and a Calabrian Chile honey. A perfect mix of sweet and savory. The cheese was creamy and decedent and perfectly coupled with the sweet and spicy honey. Definitely a must-order; and would probably be a tasty brunch item as well.I couldn't decide between two pizzas and the waitress recommended I do half and half. All pizzas are served with a thin and crispy crust that is cooked to perfection (not to crunchy and had the perfect bite) The Yukon gold potato and pecorino pizza was topped with mozzarella, lots of roasted garlic and rosemary. The flavors of the pizza are unexplainable. The starchy potato and garlicy, cheesy, herby flavors were a match made in heaven. The other half of my pizza was topped with peppery arugula and prosciutto with mozzarella, tontine and grana. The classic combo of prosciutto and arugula did not disappoint but if I had to choose a favorite, it would be the potato pizza!Talk about a carb overload-but worth every bite. I wish I could have made a second trip to this restaurant while I was in Tucson because...it was that good. I really enjoyed the overall vibe of the restaurant, the dim lighting, aromas of the cheeses melting and dough cooking, this antiqueness of the building. The service was quick and friendly and the entire staff seemed to be happy to be there. Though the restaurant respects traditional menu items, there is also innovation and evolution. This is definitely a great place to check out in the expanding Downtown, Tucson and a place I will definitely frequent when I am in town."}, {"review_id": "GdaThC78n6CVZUBPoj6aKg", "user_id": "P-NTOAMFVSDFGkhcj4GaIQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/4/2017", "text": "Had jury duty and wanted to explore some of the downtown restaurants, apparently a couple of my fellow jurors opted to come here as well.  We sat at the bar and got great service, this is important since lately I have had very poor service sitting at the bar.  We ordered pizzas and one person ordered a salad.  With the pizzas we got a little salad.  They have a small menu, but you can add toppings.  They cook was very nice and made a meat lovers for one guy and they did not charge for each additional topping, he just made proportionally to the other pizzas.  The pizzas were very good  and the one enjoyed his salad.  If you are looking for nice restaurants that has great service and a great atmosphere then I highly recommend Reilly."}, {"review_id": "bwDSYQ8wC3crx8Jd1zMKwQ", "user_id": "nATwGyVFLrzBRoJzLKWBuQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "My BF and I had to literally walk through the middle of a parade to cross the street to get to Reilly's but it was worth the embarrassment. I was hesitant to stop by here after being dead-set on my go-to pizza joint in Tucson which is Brooklyn's but this was a nice change! The goat cheese and prosciutto appetizer served on ciabatta and a spicy honey sauce was to die for. I could have left happy after that appetizer but the fennel sausage pizza was just a bonus to an already delicious start. The pizza crust is perfect, the mozzarella is endless and that sausage is so delicious. I loved everything about Reilly's and our bartender was fun.

One of my favorite spots in downtown Tucson! This is my go-to spot whenever I am craving a nice pizza (so, not your NY style. More upscale pizza).

Drinks here are also very good. They make many wonderful cocktails and have a good selection of beers. Something I particularly love about Reilly's is the eclectic seating areas; you can grab a nice dinner and drink in the restaurant, drink a beer in the patio area, or head underground to the tough luck club for a slightly divey, dark bar (which personally, is one of my favorite spots when I'm out with friends at night).

Don't let that put you off; Reilly's new owners did a fabulous job of renovating the buildings while still incorporating the old original materials into the new design. Gears and cogs from the casket lifts have been repurposed into tables, and the wood removed from the floor in the kitchen has been used to decorate the bar - it's owners have managed to integrate Reilly's history into its current incarnation without any morbidity or creepiness. Reilly is split into 3 distinctly different areas: the main restaurant/bar where dinner is served, an enclosed beer garden with patio out back, and a dark, cozy speakeasy-style bar downstairs called The Tough Luck Club. I highly recommend the TLC's happy hour $5 classic cocktails, and for Reilly's most discerning patrons, \"The Special\" (a can of Coors heavy and a shot of Bonded corn whiskey) is available anytime for only $4. While the food is good, I've never had a particularly memorable meal here and the main restaurant isn't the reason we go. A limited bar menu is offered in the beer garden (I recommend the brussel sprouts). Ultimately, the building, ambiance, history, and drink options are what makes Reilly so special. One note: be aware of how popular Reilly is on Friday and Saturday nights in particular - all 3 areas are super crowded by 8pm, so expect the beer garden to be loud and the wait for a drink downstairs to be long. If you want to avoid the crowds, check it out Sunday through Thursday.Highly recommend!"}, {"review_id": "Lx2vikBQrUnBAsGz7Le12A", "user_id": "6Dwh99zbe_lhfOD4MiAM1g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/24/2017", "text": "Walked into Reilly's to order some lunch to go.
