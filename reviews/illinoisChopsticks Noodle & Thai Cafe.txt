What I found in Chopsticks was so much more than that! This place is awesome. 1) the staff have all been friendly and proactive each time I've eaten here. 2) the food is very good. I am especially fond of the pad Thai and the Tom Yum (lemongrass) soup. They always hit the spot3) the prices are very reasonable for the area and the portions are respectable for the cost. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Glad that the Aurora Marketplace has a gem like this."}, {"review_id": "9-4etgpiW1ZJPI3rQk8rXQ", "user_id": "FvfPMvfcW5M5Be4YWl8OqA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "11/10/2017", "text": "Date of my visit: 3-November-2017Time of my visit: DinnerTotal bill (with tax, but not including tip): $32.84My girlfriend wanted to try this place.  We arrived to no host/hostess.  After a few minutes, finally someone came over to escort us to a table.We sat down, looked over the menus, sort of decided what we wanted.  After waiting for a few minutes, to no waiter/waitress, I got up to use the restroom, waited a little longer after my return to finally get a waiter to stop by.We placed an order for some appetizer (Crab Ragoon, Potstickers and Free (with Yelp! check-in) 2 Egg Rolls).  We also asked for water no ice.Appetizer came out one at a time.  Potstickers were first.  They were okay.  A bit over fried.  Egg Rolls came out next and they were definitely over fried.  Crab Ragoon never came out...For our main courses, I ordered Thai Grilled Chicken and my girlfriend ordered Garlic Delight with Chicken.It did not take long for my dish to come out.  It took a good 10-15 minutes for my girlfriend's dish to come out, after my food...  I was sitting hungry, watching my dish get cold...  WTF?!  Finally, my girlfriend got her dish.My chicken was a bit bland.  It was supposed to have lemony taste to it, well, it did not.  I was not expecting much from my streamed white rice.Now, to the fun part.... the bill...  We were charged for the Crab Ragoon... It took sometime to flag down our waiter to get the bill corrected.  Which brings me to the service portion of the review...  That was the story of the entire evening...  Atrociously slow service, barely get our waters refilled, missing food...A F- experience!  Not planning on returning."}, {"review_id": "wEFHz9quN3plXxdLLGIduw", "user_id": "luoidj4uPysXg2rbQCEcjQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Really enjoyed lunch here.  Prices were reasonable and for a lunch special they let you add on appetizers for a dollar.

I had the red curry lunch special and my friend got the pad see ew.  Reasonable portion sizes and the flavors were incredible! My curry was just the right amount of spiciness.  The restaurant was very clean and inviting. Smells amazing when you walk in the doors which is always a nice introduction to a restaurant.

Chopsticks did not disappoint!They have delivery on certain days/times, you can dine in, or you can order for pick up which is what we did. We ordered online and the order was ready within 20 minutes. The staff was very friendly and I think the prices are comparable to other places in the area.I had the chicken panang curry, and my boyfriend had the chicken Pad Thai. We also had the Thai egg rolls. The Pad Thai and the Panang Curry were great! My boyfriend loved the Pad Thai so much, as well as his son (he had never had it before and he says he is addicted now). Panang Curry is one of my all-time favorite foods, and this one was spot on.In the words of my boyfriend, \"This was great, we need to go back!\""}, {"review_id": "9zRaR-iAfKFOLlw2Zlrx6A", "user_id": "3PL2A_YntX42rYcUzcvTag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Been here twice now and LOVED it!!

The breading on the chicken is mushy and the chicken has no bite. The vegetables are way over cooked and the sauce is gross. I asked to add cashews to my meal and they said it would be $1 upcharge. I agreed to it but there was only about 5 nuts in the dish! That's not cool! I am very easy to please when it comes to food but whoever cooked this meal failed miserably. I tried debreading the chicken so I didn't have to eat that nasty mushyness but the chicken was still not good. I rarely throw away food but I could not finish this dish.

I love the yellow curry here. Love it. So it pains me to write this bad review but this place has taken a hit. Our orders are simple. Yellow curry with chicken. One gripe is that the pick up time is always long now. I call and it's 20 minutes to 45 minutes now. I don't understand why that is because they are never crazy busy. The biggest reason for my bad review though is that they don't give you enough rice. Thought it might be a fluke but we have noticed now that every single time now they barely fill the rice container. They are purposefully skimping on the rice. Maybe this restaurant is in financial trouble? Not sure but we're not happy. Their prices are not cheap so skimping on anything is unacceptable in my opinion. Now we are going to try and find another Thai place. It's really a shame."}, {"review_id": "HShOMqx22VDFdywczP83Bg", "user_id": "3BiL1QFjzE-tkz1vxFUVwg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/27/2016", "text": "Food is very good but the portion sizes are rather small.Friendly team with good customer service.Their pad see ew is good.We asked for spring rolls and theirs is deep fried, so that was a slight let down.Their pad Thai is also good."}, {"review_id": "MaCpABosIe19gJUebHZvkg", "user_id": "zKY6NM9CxxWxcY5JJXUB7g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/21/2016", "text": "Great option for Thai food! My experience is solely based on my pick up order, but after visiting the restaurant itself I can say it's a quaint little spot to grab lunch or dinner.I was able to order food right on my Yelp app thru Eat24 which is super convenient. My husband and I are creatures of habit when it comes to Asian food, so we both ordered our usuals -- crab rangoon, pad kee mao, and beef and broccoli. Plus, if you check-in on your Yelp app you get a free order or vegetable egg rolls!It took about 30 minutes for my order to be ready, and it was there waiting when I stopped in to pick it up. My pad kee mao was very good, however it was extremely spicy. I know it's a spicy noodle dish, but when ordering it gave me the option to select a mild, medium, or hot spice level and I went with mild. YEAH. Definitely not mild! My meal was for sure packing some heat. It was still very good, just wish I didn't have to drink so much water to eat it!The crab rangoons were small but very tasty. Crunchy on the outside and a nice filling on the inside. The veggie egg rolls weren't my fave, but my husband liked them just fine. Overall, it was a great option for not having to cook! Portions were big, ingredients fresh, and it didn't break the bank.We'll be back for sure!"}, {"review_id": "swIKUTh-055Do41wTUOjsQ", "user_id": "2FtdCVp8sEFlcjEdOVDLLA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/13/2017", "text": "This an easy review - as this place is solid. Everything I had here so sad has been of quality. One of my personal ways to test a Thai restaurant is the availability and then quality of a green papaya salad. Once you've had a great green papaya salad, it's quite addicting - and this restaurant has a REALLY good one. I come here once a week and it never fails - always so delicious!"}, {"review_id": "r32URcxNi-8FCg7JBeDvYA", "user_id": "jZexh-_KFWBMhtrzEsyhXw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Really, really upsetting to call asking for lunch hours (15 mins before 3 pm) they said they still have lunch.

I tried the beef pad thai. It was a little on the sweet side, but had good flavor. I also tried the basil fried rice, which was very good. We had pot stickers,  vegetable & chicken egg rolls for apps. They were all very good, but the portions were really small for the price. Only 3 egg rolls per order. My only complaint would be that the service was a bit lacking, and one person at our table got their meal quite a bit after the rest of us. We never got refills on our water, and had to wait some time for the check and to go containers. However, it did start to get busy, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt this time."}, {"review_id": "SFA0HqpYUHHzlQhAB2Gd5A", "user_id": "H08NlY0qvqpttF5HKyLLAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Love this place.
