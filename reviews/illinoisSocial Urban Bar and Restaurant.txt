I often have dreams about their cheese curds.... I've never, ever had a bad meal here. The chef is incredible! I love that they source all their ingredients locally, change their menu with the seasons, and everything is fresh and made from scratch. And as if the food weren't good enough, the cocktail menu is top notch- Such a great variety of inventive and classic cocktails that also changes with the seasons. I think by now I've tried almost everything on it, and haven't been disappointed once. The staff is always friendly and treats you more like friends than customers. The only thing about this place that disappoints me is that since I moved, it's way too far away! Please come to St. Charles, I'm begging you!"}, {"review_id": "K7k6bzhOvesQNvWy3oOGEg", "user_id": "-hxQ5ti3atF53TPMF1sMHA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "I love that they support the local farmers.

The food is amazing & their menus change up frequently. I believe the last time we came was maybe 5 years ago?The servers really go into detail of how the food is prepared, where it came from, etc. On our recent trip, we had the Shepherds pie (small plate) and the beef tenderloin (big plate). We decided to share both, as we didn't want to get too full. Well I thought the Shepherds pie was too small for us to share, though it was really good. Perfect combination of potatoes, beef, peas, carrots, & gravy.The beef tenderloin was absolutely amazing. The texture, the taste, to the amount of char. It was also on a bed of mashed cauliflower and had some roasted Brussel sprouts. Though it was good, I didn't think it was worth the price. I believe it was around $36 & even though it was considered a big plate, we probably could've each had one of those already.So my point is, this place is good, but for the amount of food..I feel that it's way overpriced. I was in between a 3 or 4 star, honestly. The atmosphere is great for a date night or just to go out with some friends. It was really cold in there for some reason though. Will return again...but not a priority."}, {"review_id": "pxOEXorJoX83A26JdOI8LQ", "user_id": "RkgwgvTEu9BkHjEcOOP7MA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/16/2017", "text": "Sooo, I had an interesting night here....First off this place was great. Food was awesome, staff was friendly and the whiskey was damn good, ok so let me get to the bizarre dude we got sat next to lolSo they have community seating here, they mean well by it and probably want it to feel more casual and social which I totally am cool with...but what happens if you sit next to some weirdo?This guy we had to sit next to was having a great time and kept talking to himself saying weird stuff. Everything was under his breath and didn't talk to anyone. He would just say random words like \"filet mignon\" and continue talking to himself. So bizarre. The kicker was when the waitress, who was very very sweet and polite brought him one of many dishes he ordered and sat it in front of him. She told him what the dish was, said \"enjoy!\" And walked away. Shortly after he just said, \"F***ing B**ch...\" kinda softly and under his breath again...we just looked at each other and couldn't believe what was going on. Idk if something was up with this guy but man was he weird. He just continued to make noises while he indulged in his meal and we minded our own business.  We had a good laugh when we left though.So yeah, great gastro pub and rare to find a place like this in Rockford. The community seating is a bit strange, especially if you sit next to some questionable characters...yeah, try to get a seat at the bar."}, {"review_id": "lLFkIIy4gYZtP4sjrctjNw", "user_id": "k39vmETGp6X6Gi_mblPT6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/8/2017", "text": "I am always downtown in Rockford and I always walk past this place. I have never went in because I always assumed it was a fancy place. I happened come in with a few friends for drinks after dinner and I was blown away. They had a very interesting drink menu categorized by the type of  alcohol you preferred. The cocktails were really great, the bar tenders were very polite and they made very interesting drinks. They weren't your typical Moscow mules or old fashion but they made modern drinks that caught the eyes of the customer.  Such drinks had smoke in them or even flames. I would go just for the showmanship of the bartenders. We sat at a table but they aren't your typical tables. They were longer then the usual high top tables but perfect for our group. We also tried a dessert made by the chef. This dessert was a deconstructed S'more, perfect for sharing. Everything was made fresh, from the melted chocolate gonache, to the marshmallow being melted on top, and even the homemade graham crackers. You can definitely taste the difference. Overall, I'm so happy that my friends suggested going here because I was pleased with the customer service, the drinks, and the dessert we had. Next time I come back I will be trying more of the food menu and a few more beverages."}, {"review_id": "qMnU1YYsWZz-rumyjSorJg", "user_id": "QS08OZddNzh4vtJcCmqwDw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "Pork chops are absolutely amazing, I need the recipe... drinks are awesome and food is full of flavors like always never disappointing"}, {"review_id": "P-TSKbN7gEfIYBReLrJHjA", "user_id": "mIylP5D9ma1gYwwS4AAgCA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/1/2017", "text": "Easily the best food in town, I'd write a detailed review about individual meals and drinks, but I think it's best summed up like this.If you've had something at another place and you get it at social, I guarantee you it's better at social.

My friend and I who came to visit my parents in Rockford along with my sister who lives here were all looking for a place to eat downtown after we had drinks at a local bar. Not much was open but we're glad Urban was! My sister said nothing but good things about the food at this place and said everything was \"bomb\" Drinks were great. I had the lavender cocktail. My sister had the rum punch and my best friend had the blue bourbon-which was on fire! The presentation was awesome. We had ordered cheese curds and pork tacos to start. The cheese curds were a tad too salty for my liking but my best friend enjoyed them. The tacos however, were delicious! My friend even says they taste as authentic as the Mexican taco trucks back home. Our entrees consisted of the hot chicken and the beef stroganoff, which was on special. The hot chicken was definitely my favorite! It was so good that I'm already wanting more! It came with a hot cake and collard greens. Our server was nice and friendly. Will definitely be back when I'm in town again"}, {"review_id": "TQnm4CM2z2B6GXHbbQ01pg", "user_id": "ZgWVyPXX6bpmLDV1xvOl-w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/7/2017", "text": "5 stars for food and service, but I'd only give it 3 for atmosphere. As long as you know what you're getting yourself into, it'll be a great dining experience. But if you are looking for a quiet intimate space to enjoy a dinner date, you're not going to find it here on a Saturday night. Seating is either bar or family-table style. And after 8, it starts getting quite loud. So while you might be sharing an 8 person table with complete strangers, it's difficult to carry a conversation because everyone is trying to talk over the noise. Acoustics in here are hit or miss depending on the crowd. The actually dining/bar space is really trendy and fun. Rustic industrial vibe and they pull it off quite well. Service was absolutely top notch. Both the chef who delivered our food to the table, the hostess, and our waitress were knowledgeable, professional, and extremely welcoming. The food was what would make me come back to Social. My girlfriend got the pork chop and I got the hot chicken. Both were cooked, seasoned, and executed to perfection. The upscale hot chicken was one of the best chicken dishes I've had (and I'm an avid hot chicken fan when I'm in the South). Skin was crispy and delicious, Seasoned to perfection, and the sauce it came in was deliciously well balanced. I would come back just for the hot chicken! It came with perfectly cooked collard greens and a hoe cake. Both of which were excellent compliments. Overall, it is absolutely worth it to stop by the Social for a craft cocktail and I night out in downtown Rockford!"}, {"review_id": "R_o6D6UWmVWbKPYce8ef0g", "user_id": "EHjpUkf2NrBPfBBrYfSlFw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Just great.

I'm from Arizona and had no idea what kinda of food or environment social offered until I walked inside. You walk into this low warm lighting that makes you feel calm and relaxed. It's not a huge place to bring groups of friends to eat, seating is limited. First let me say the bartender had patience because when I was as about to order my drink I realized I misplaced my ID.  Found my ID and order the Bourbon fire and Ice. It was so neat to see the care and pretty cool fire show when making this drink. It was perfectly smooth and gives you that perfect relaxation your looking for when ordering a drink. The food was quite a wait but it was sooo worth it! A five dining experience when it comes to the taste buds. We order the Pork Tacos, hot chicken, cheese curds, and beef stroganoff. Everything was delicious and made with a lot of care and love into the seasonings! Kudos to the chef and cooks! You all are doing amazing at Social from the front of house to the back!
