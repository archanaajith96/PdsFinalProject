Our delivery ETA was 50 minutes and it was ready and here in about a half hour. I was looking to get a traditional white pizza but with my phone girl ended up creating a thin crust alfredo sauce and sundried tomato pizza that was awesome! We got the cheesy bread (razorback sticks) that were scrumptious as well. We liked our food so much, we don't feel a need to check out other pizzerias!"}, {"review_id": "OXZmZR-otc9ylxERDSIgkQ", "user_id": "UVPjMD2GpzuBHQzh6U9klQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Salad bar always fresh!!

It's definitely worth checking out.We grabbed the Pepperoni and Super Supreme last time we went. Both were delish. Although the pepperoni was so good one of the kids interrupted everyone to say \"Be quiet! I want to say that this is really yummy.\" So two very messy thumbs up from the kids. heh.The adults also enjoyed the pizza quite a bit. Only complaint is the $ is on the expensive side for pizza. Larges are basically mediums, but cost more than most larges elsewhere. So just an awareness factor there. I'm sure we'll be back to sample more of the specialty pizza types."}, {"review_id": "-Hu7WzFmttxZNqnBtVOMbA", "user_id": "PuWVANT9DJjg7pT9UC7HGg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/22/2017", "text": "The pizza was excellent and so were the breadsticks!

Since relocating to Arkansas from the Chicago suburbs I have been searching for a proper slice of pizza. For the most part, I've been let down by the thin crust monstrosities masquerading as pizza.

Pizza came out hot and delish!
