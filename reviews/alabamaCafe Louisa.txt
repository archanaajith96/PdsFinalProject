On the way to an event in Montgomery we found (thanks Yelp!) a great local spot in the Cloverdale area. We didn't have time to stay and have lunch at the adjacent pizza place or to hang out and study or read a book but we were able to grab a quick coffee and a slice of cannoli cheesecake. Yeyah. That was fantastic! It reminded me of my cannoli filled trip to Boston last year! So good. If i'm perfectly honest, I didn't love the cappuccino I got, but I'm willing to give them another shot (ha). It wasn't a flavor profile i've had before. The staff was SUPER friendly and gave us great attention and answers all our questions.I'm looking forward to coming back again soon!"}, {"review_id": "mQSREg7n1GctHOB9W7xKOw", "user_id": "9hZZrIKtFY1y2UcWa-dEmQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/12/2017", "text": "Short version: lower quality version of Panera with frustrating policies that imply a cheap ownerLong Version: I have eaten here several times because of its convenient location and hours, but I avoid if possible. The deli food is low quality- bread is dry, toppings are average, flavor palate is not very good.I once ordered a black bean soup which the cashier claimed to be \"divine.\" It tasted like a Great Value brand can of black beans heated in a microwave topped with shredded cheddar cheese, I'm not kidding. They do not accept American Express, and they have $5 card minimums. Which is ridiculous, considering it is 2017 and this is supposed to be a high-end coffee shop. Consider this- you can't go in and buy a latte, cappuccino, or coffee in the morning with a credit card. At a coffee shop. That is mind boggling. If you're that cheap that you can't afford to pay the fee, raise all your prices $0.25 per item and move on. Positives: Pastries are very good, hours are convenient, gelato is tasty (only knock is their idea of a scoop is a tablespoon full)"}, {"review_id": "K51IB1lwK4GH5ibUf3Ys_g", "user_id": "gd2bDddpEbl0YHMNvIbDHQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "We stopped by during a recent trip to Montgomery. We were looking for some coffee but wanted something local. Luckily we found this place and loved it! It has a really cool atmosphere and seems perfect for small meetings, a date or studying. There were so many pastries and desserts that looked amazing. They also had several food and drink options, including blended coffee drinks. I got the caramel-icious and it was truly caramelious!! It included amazing gelato and toddy. So, so good!

Got suckered into buying a bagel to meet the $5.00 minimum fee fiasco they got going.  Yes, I could've got a cookie but I am calming down on sweets.   No wifi.  Odd for a coffee shop.  Anyway, I'm sooo sorry.  I truly wanted to like this establishment, or find something that I can boast about."}, {"review_id": "x_OkeNEPBNmUZK4HWzirDg", "user_id": "NSwhq-KFFoatc8jKb8lrJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/26/2017", "text": "Nice to find a place that has good quality as a standard and not just a once in a while thing.Mint coffee was great, not over bearing and yet enough flavor.The panini was good too, not too much pesto to ruin the flavor of everything else.

When I stopped in it was a slow slow day and noone else was in the cafe. The gal behind the counter wasn't much help. She didn't bother explaining the menu and blinked when I told her it's my first visit and asked what she recommends. Do they have a house special or whatever? pfffffffft. She couldn't wait to be done with my order Rant: Hey, I'm not trying to be your best friend here but a warm demeanor might be nice. Look, people come to coffee shops to hang out or read a book or listen to some poetry and feel r e l a x e d. If you don't like customers I feel like you need a job filing papers in a dusty old office.Speaking of which, Cafe Louisa has the charm of being old and a bit gritty. But it's border line ..just plain..well.. it's dirty. On the floor at my table I found pieces of bread crust that's been there for who knows how long. The floor boards have some grime. The gelato case looked sick. As in nasty. I don't know if the temperature will meet inspection, folks. The melty drip freaked me out. You're not cutting it for me, Louisa.The espresso cookie was as hard as a rock. My peanut butter protein smoothie was fine. The patio out front is prime real estate for enjoying your beverage and watching the street. The inside nook with magazine reads is another good bet. But then, why would I stick around any longer at this place? Let me know where the real coffee shops are in Montgomery, man."}, {"review_id": "qxhOK8qIT8t3Q2X9O_0ljA", "user_id": "00ecV2fCEX37olxqkCfgCA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/24/2017", "text": "Rally enjoyed this place.

We purchased our drinks and pastries (which were delicious) and sat down to work on my laptop when we discovered that they don't have any WiFi. I got the impression that they don't want people to come to their business to work, but that's the main reason I go to coffee shops! They won't be receiving our business again. We ended up taking our food with us and went to one of the big chain coffee stores down the road so we could actually get our work done and enjoy ourselves without feeling judged by shop management.*** Tried another time to get coffee after an event, and they were closing early even though posted hours said they should be open for another hour.

I ran in to grab a coffee just after opening, and after a brief wait ordered a hot, dark mocha and a lemon-blueberry muffin. After another brief wait (maybe 7 -8 minutes) for my coffee. The mocha was decent, nothing special, but better than average espresso & store bought syrup. The muffin though... Was really bad. My husband and I both had a bite and threw the rest of it away. The cellophane wrapper was sticky, as was the muffin. The muffin itself tasted like they forgot to sweeten it or add enough butter... Maybe they tried to compensate with a glaze that made the whole thing a sticky mess. Tl;dr : decent coffee, but based on what I got, wouldn't order food again. Though probably wouldn't return even for coffee if we were in the area.
