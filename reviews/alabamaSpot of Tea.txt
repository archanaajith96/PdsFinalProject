I had the Monte Cristo (Egg battered sourdough grilled and stuffed with ham, turkey, Swiss, American, and Monterey Jack) and it's the best in town. I've also had their Eggs Cathedral, Seafood Eggs Benedict, Tomato Bisque, Seafood Bisque...and on and on. Spot of Tea does a great job of incorporating local seafood in delicious dishes. Plus you can brunch ANY day! And, with glass front wall and outdoor seating to enjoy Mobile's Cathedral Square and listen to a local street musician playing a trumpet or sax tune is pretty awesome too."}, {"review_id": "NBVCGap5HtvVEFixjLKuBg", "user_id": "Pn3d0_vTB6_f5Xb2fhks9A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "4 of us were in town for a concert and were looking for a breakfast spot before we headed out of town. Based on Yelp reviews, we chose this place. We were seated and greeted by a server who gave me a deer in headlights look when I asked her name (NOTE: I HATE when I have to ask servers for their names. They should introduce themselves first thing). Miranda got our drinks quickly and took our orders and things started going downhill from there. We were talking and lost track of time until we saw people all around us (who were seated after us) getting food. My husband signaled for our waitress and she said \"just a minute\" as she went outside to tend to other customers. She came back in and walked by us 3 more times before my husband got a manager and asked for service. The manager apologized and said several of her staff had gone on break (yes, during peak hours) and that's why our food was delayed. She then went over to our waitress and told her we complained so waitress came directly to us and started to argue with us. We told her just to bring our check for our drinks and she said our food was ready and went to get it. A male server from the next table, who overheard the conversation, refilled our drinks and was very nice. Our food came out almost an hour after we ordered. My husband's was ice cold so he sent it back. The rest of us ate our lukewarm food because we were hungry and didn't eat dinner the night before. The seafood omelet had a good flavor, but seemed like the omelets were already made and they just poured the seafood sauce over it. The manager offered to replace all of our food after finding out it wasn't hot, but we had to get on the road. Our server continued to scowl at us the rest of the meal. We went to the counter to pay and were asked how things were. The response to \"not good\" was \"oh\". LOL. We were pretty much laughing at this point. As out of towners, I seriously doubt they care that we will never return again, but I hope they educate their servers on not arguing with the customers and perhaps management should stagger breaks so all of the employees aren't gone at the same time."}, {"review_id": "fkXpMFzFwolw_XPYJhFqOA", "user_id": "wTfb2nfzPIyFcYQArdPtuQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "BACKGROUNDThis part of the story is kind of irrelevant to the review, but if I hadn't had this experience, I wouldn't have had the Segway urge, which led me to Spot of Tea; so here goes...My BFF Heather and I were searching new tech ideas online, and one thing led to another and we found the \"Hoverboard Lounge Chair\" atand couldn't stop laughing. We decided we ABSOLUTELY needed to try this!!Well, it's not as easy to find as we would like, unless you buy the hoverboard ($150-$350) and the attachment ($99). What's the next best thing? The SEGWAY.Now we HAD to try the segway. Since I was in Mobile, I used my Yelp App and found Spot of Tea Segway Tours. When we called to find out more and book a reservation, the VIP option comes with a meal from the famous Spot of Tea. We just HAD to try it!!SPOT OF TEASpot of Tea was established in 1994 as a sole proprietorship and incorporated in 1996 as a of A Spot Of Tea, Inc. It began at 306 Dauphin Street in 1994 then expanded into the Zoghby Building (now Zoghby Moore Building) in 1997.​Through 23 years they have continued to renovate to not just keep up with the times but to be ahead of their time. They're proud to say they have the most up to date social platform while maintaining boots on the ground to stay in close touch with their local guests. January 1st, 2017 they proudly announced the opening of their Segway Historic Tours with an emphasis on Mardi Gras. Come and glide with them whilst learning the rich history of Mobile and confirm for yourself where the festival now known as Mardi Gras actually began.They have been proud members of the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce since 1994 and have an A+ rating with the BBB.THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCEWe booked our Segway tour for 1pm that included breakfast first, so we got there at 11am. We went up to the front hostess stand and said who we were. IMMEDIATELY, they got the co-owner Crissi Moore; an absolutely WONDERFUL woman.She shared the rich history of her business, her life, and the history of downtown Mobile. She sat at our table for quite a while and also made sure we were in good hands with server Paul. She also recommended their flagship breakfasts: Eggs Cathedral and Bananas Foster French Toast. We tried both. OUTSTANDING!!Whilst eating, the Mobile News even filmed us. We also got to meet a TRUE Southern Belle, Ms. Ruby Moore, co-owner. What a BEAUTIFUL family!After about 2 hours of food, socializing, and bottomless mimosas, we headed out for our Segway Tour with Cadocious, who was AMAZING!!CONCLUSIONThis restaurant has it all!! Local Charm, History, Great Views of the Cathedral Square, Great Food, and Great Service!!Is 5/5 Stars International Fancy? No. It's a 5/5 Stars Iconic Local Must-See! ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE VISIT!! Tell Crissi I sent you!Also, I definitely recommend their Segway rentals, which I previously reviewed (5/5 Stars); it is super awesome great fun!5/5 RECOMMENDOF NOTE*Best tables on the patio. Brunch can get busy. Reservations a good idea.*Great Venue for Bridal Parties, Bridal Teas, Rehearsal Dinners, Baby Showers and More*Pay parking lot In back. Meters on the street.*For More Information: spotoftea.com"}, {"review_id": "9qWWoVCuC7y48dNeB076yQ", "user_id": "Pd8gBj2qQKT7eJW7vP3h5Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Ambiance is nice with outdoor seating.Stopped by for a late lunch and ordered bananas foster french toast.  Since I don't eat pork (the french toast came with choice of ham steak, sausage or bacon), I asked if I could substitute cheese/onion hash browns.  The waiter indicated that I could, which was nice.  My husband ordered a coke (he'd eaten elsewhere)and I ordered the free strawberry sweet tea (free when you 'Check in').  I showed the waiter my phone with offer for a free tea.  He pushed some buttons on my phone and walked off to get the drinks.The establishment seemed to be fairly popular with customers continuously coming.   While the service seemed slow, it was approximately 45 minutes from the time I ordered to the time I left - so not too bad.   Drinks were refilled in a timely manner.  (Strawberry sweet tea wasn't bad and this is from someone who does NOT like sweet tea.)The food.  Well, my food wasn't hot when it arrived but what made it a slightly negative experience was that the folded napkin on the table did not have a fork, only a knife.  So, while my tepid french toast was soaking up the caramel sauce, I had to wait on a fork.  By the time the fork arrived, everything was cold.Even cold, the french toast was delicious - very sweet, but delicious.  The hash browns, instead of being a small side were a large plate loaded with potatoes, cheese and onions.  The small taste I had (of cold hash browns) was tasty as well but I ended up getting them to go as I was stuffed from eating just half of the french toast.When it came time for the check is where my displeasure set in.  The check was almost $19 for $11 french toast and a $2 (I assume) drink.  So I was overcharged for my meal.  I was in a hurry and didn't feel like disputing it but don't plan to return.Why do I not plan to return?  While the food was tasty, it was not hot.  By the time I could eat it (due to no eating utensil), it was cold.  And then to be overcharged?  Pushed it over the line.  Since I'm from out of town, I doubt my patronage will be missed but was disappointed to have a less than stellar experience."}, {"review_id": "MY2-qInhrks7g6ZUjoCH8w", "user_id": "DW-YWhRcMlWIw-kTlYu5Lg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Great ambiance.

The ambiance around the building is so inviting.  The inside is made uo more like a diner. When i was seated, i had a very helpful and kind waiter named Paul. He was able to give me a \"nickel\" tour of the menu and helpful with suggestions on items across the menu.I had the strawberry tea with their egg cathedral.  It was an awesome choice. It consists of a crab cake (scrambeled eggs)on top of an english muffin with a seafood cream sauce covering it all. Hashbrowns surround this beautiful creation. The seafood sauce had perfect balance preventing a briney or bland taste . The crab cake was delicious . The only take away is that the muffin was a little tough to cut through.Overall, i give them all stars for ambiance, hospitality and savory dishes. Now that i have had the savory, i may need to come back tomorrow and try some of their sweet dishes."}, {"review_id": "8Koejhw0eeXBWWM04KLk3g", "user_id": "fUNcxLXy6zjNa3nkS4XlwA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Three words.

Spot of tea is a cute place. Aesthetically inviting. We were greeting and seated very quickly, which was nice. I personally do not care for tables put at awkward angles (square tables in diamond patterns) but whatever. Our waiter was friendly and punctual, polite and knowledgeable about the menu.As for the food. It was tasty. But there were a few discrepancies.First off...home fries and hashbrowns are not the same. What you call hash browns are chunks of potatoes. Hashbrowns are shredded potatoes. Though yours were nice, it's not what you described.But here is my real food issue, your menu claimed 4 large shrimp. My \"large\" shrimp were the size of a quarter. See photo.  I paid how much extra for the seafood (4 jumbo shrimp) eggs Benedict...(See menu photo)Albeit the food was tasty, please reword your menu to be more accurate. Now, upon check out...and I totally understand that we all have bad days, but when you are the last impression someone leaves your establishment with, be pleasant, be kind, be polite. I saw this, because you were not.

So this place just seemed like the most ideal place to start the day. The tea was the best part of my meal. It was soothing & comforting with no bitterness. I ordered the veggie omelette and waffle sticks. Let me start off with the omelette... it was good but nothing stood out (like the egg was not super fluffy or the veggies crisp etc...) just an average omelette. As you can see in the pick the waffle is not sticks - it is half of a waffle. Not sure why the need to list sticks as most people would assume they would look different. But the worst part is how flavorless the waffle was as well as how stale it tasted. Did not seem fresh at all. The other dish ordered was Seafood Eggs Benedict. It was flavorful due to the ham but the sauce was a bit sweet, which we are not accustomed to and prefer the sauce to not be sweet. The shrimp was good and the grits were true to the South. They also offer outdoor seating but with the traffic going by we chose to eat inside."}, {"review_id": "oNilboo7rqJnD1T-wz3RnQ", "user_id": "cfEP3ztK6pFoCPlsVD7uDw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Good food as always.
