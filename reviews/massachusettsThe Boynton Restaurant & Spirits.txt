It was also bruisingly noisy.This is a bar that serves food. I can't comment on the bar experience although our table was in the bar area - everyone was certainly enjoying themselves.The food was eh. The fries and onion rings were cold and hard. The eggplant parm sandwich was flavorless and without texture. There were no complaints with the turkey club but no ummm's either.The pickle and the French onion soup were redeeming.Service was fine but harried giving the amount of people seated and waiting for tables.If you go, stick to the bar and think about food after the first drink."}, {"review_id": "edPruEe4OA3PnoCZJ7viOg", "user_id": "Yo6BfK-YJIiCIbHY5PDKPg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "Just popped in for drinks, always a fun place and great service!!!

It's a fun, casual setting, great for young adults and up. Walking in the hostess greets you with a smile and assists you immediately. There almost always is a wait during night time dinner hours but never too long, usually 10-15 mins at the most, but well worth it! Food review:If you end up getting any app, I definitely recommend the lobster crab rangoons, they are absolutely phenomenal. The wonton wrap is fried to a crisp, with the inside filled with a gooey, cream cheese and lobster filling goodness. I always try to try a new entree every time I come, and everything I've tried, is beyond amazing. This time I've tried the boynton chicken club, a boynton signature dish, a club sandwich with chicken, tomato, bacon, lettuce with a honey mustard condiment spread. Although sounds like a typical sandwich their home made honey mustard spread definitely makes the sandwich. The potato wedges that come with them are flavorfully seasoned to the perfect amount. I would also recommend their boynton bombers and pizza dishes. I have not been disappointed by any dishes yet, so I would recommend any dish!Summary:Definitely a go to spot! Pros:Quick, friendly service Awesome food, pretty average pricing Private parking Weekly specials"}, {"review_id": "kXdugou-kOr5qpAuIicNlg", "user_id": "zF0wuFMzEm7nZuBZ_WsQ5g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/11/2017", "text": "The boynton us one I my favorite restaurants in Worcester. I always get the cocktail and oysters for an appetizer. Comes out on ice with lemon, cocktail sauce, and a mini tobasco sauce (super cute). They taste fresh and delicious. Only down side is it's sometimes small and not very fulfilling that way. Otherwise, I love it.My favorite dish is the parmesan lobster (a pasta dish). It has a quarter pound of Maine lobster, Maine crab meat, and PEI mussels sauteed with garlic, asparagus, and lemon parmesan pan sauce served with penne pasta. One of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. It is generous in size and flavor, definitely a way to cheer me up. Everything tasted fresh and perfectly balanced each other. On another hand, I've had a seared salmon dish. This was not as good. I was rather Dissapponted. I felt that the salmon was cut thick, and difficult to eat because of that. This is a much simpler dish that consists of white rice, soy sauce, and slaw. I've heard this was a popular dish, just not for me. If I were to rate only based on the parmesan lobster , it would be a 5. But the salmon dish definitely pulls it down. Otherwise, service was good. Just note that there are no reservations and you have to wait for a table depending on the time/day."}, {"review_id": "CT0gn_pYC68-7shdissVUw", "user_id": "eBrVkzHhHKZxyVS1SPKbJw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "9/19/2017", "text": "One of my friends said you have to try this place!  Well I did and I was let down.

It was a Friday night and we planned to meet for 7, so we knew it would be busy. Luckily, we saw that you can join the waitlist from yelp beforehand, so we did this around 6:15 when the wait was 45-60 minutes and we were SO glad we did! Parking here is very difficult at busy times, but they do have a parking attendant who is running around trying to help you find a spot. We waited about 10 minutes after our estimated time, which was fine since we had put our name on the list beforehand. We sat upstairs in a back room and the noise level was pretty fair for the size of the groups up there! Our waitress did a fairly good job keeping tabs on us, despite how busy the restaurant was. We all enjoyed Boynton buckets which were tasty and plenty strong (only $13/bucket, shared by 2 people)! Everyone LOVED their food. We ordered nachos and fried pickles to start, then main meals which were Chicken Fajitas, Chicken Piccata, Steak Bomber, and the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. All of us decided that our next meet up has to be at the Boynton again next month!"}, {"review_id": "GyWcKQGi2cvbpV7mbH21bQ", "user_id": "pNvArAV29VGJr4iSIZcE2Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "happened upon this place because we were stuck in St Pats parade traffic and were starving.  Great beer selection, friendly wait staff..

The place was popping on a Friday evening as there were numerous people at the bar or sitting within booths ordering meals. The Boynton seems like a place that can accommodate all sorts of personalities, such as those who want a good quality sit down meal with a small group of friends or those who just simply want a drink and socialize with everyone at the bar.The food itself is not too shabby as well; EXCELLENT actually. My preconceived notion about the place was that since it's a bar/restaurant, the food would be terrible since that's what my previous experiences has told me about bars and food past 9pm. HOWEVER, The Boynton helped set me straight and basically told me that they are no ordinary bar restaurant. The first thing that my cousin and I ordered were oysters. In my opinion, these were the best oysters I had in awhile! They were so fresh that if you told me that the chef just harvest them from the ocean, I would believe you! I basically tasted the ocean as I ate them.As my entrée, I order the Boynton Tuna Sashimi because I noticed that it was the house specialty and it's something that I was fixated upon after I looked through the entire menu. The Tuna was beautifully seared with a chili rub and served on a bed of jasmine rice and a side of slaw, ginger, wasabi, and light soy sauce. The presentation was gorgeous! However, the important thing was that it tasted AMAZING! The tuna had that cooked texture of the outer seared and a cool, firm internal texture. The tuna alone was astonishing, but was elevated by the wasabi and soy sauce! The rice was perfectly cooked, not too dry, damp, hard, nor soft; JUST PERFECT! The part that of the dish that I was wary about at first was the slaw since I didn't know how it would fit into the dish as whole. Nonetheless, as I took my first bite, I tasted the acidity of the fresh crisp slaw which balanced out the unseasoned rice. The slaw itself had sesame seeds in it, so its flavor worked with the Asian theme of the dish. Overall, it was a light and fresh dish!A word of caution for those who are planning a visit, PLEASE BE PATIENT, the servers have a lot of tables to take care of, so it's best to just chill and order a drink or two while you wait for your food because you will not be sorry when it arrives!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-boynton-restaurant-and-spirits-worcester-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
