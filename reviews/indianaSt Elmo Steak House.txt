It's a classic Indy staple. The restaurant has a traditional and elegant feel. There are a few dining rooms and also a bar where you can eat. The walls are full of photos of the famous people who have eaten there, which is fun to admire. The drink menu has classic cocktails, beer, and an extensive wine list. I would suggest that they offer a mock-tail menu, as they did not have any fun alcohol free drinks. We ordered the shrimp cocktail. The spicy cocktail sauce and refreshing shrimp balance each other perfectly. It was hard for me to decide which steak to order. My waitress was extremely helpful, as she described each steak option and gave me recommendations based on my preferences. I ordered the cowboy steak with the green beans as a side. The ribeye was flavorful, juicy, and tender. The green beans were also fresh with onions and red peppers mixed in. This was a very fun experience and I recommend everyone tries out St. Elmo's at least once."}, {"review_id": "X9oYt8O96YPXy63Zz55jkw", "user_id": "JUiHncYqF9qrJC4MiNfWsA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "My friends and I decided to do a girls road trip to go to this year's Derby and we decided to do a night in Indy. We chose to do dinner at St Elmo Steak House as a nice place to treat ourselves. For the review, I will break it down by various factors.Service: Very friendly. It was slow at times, but our server kept us updated about food coming out. I thought it was a nice touch at the end that we each got a handshake and \"Thank you for dining with us tonight.\" Atmosphere: Classy, vintage restaurant and bar. Surprising a lot of space given there is a main level and lower level. A little loud, especially when trying to hear our server talk about the menu items.Food: For the starter, I had the World Famous Shrimp Cocktail which came in a bowl over ice and had four jumbo shrimp covered in house made cocktail sauce. It is $15.99. My feedback is there was too much horseradish used. When I took the first bite, I felt that I was clearing out my sinus and my tongue was on fire. It is a tasty sauce, but way too spicy.For the entree, the meal comes with soup and choice of side. I had the 14 oz Ribeye and chose Navy Bean Soup as the soup of choice and Redskin Mashed Potatoes as the side. It was $41.00. The soup was pretty enjoyable and savory. I liked the potatoes. The steak was OK. Not bad, but it did not stand out. It had good seasonings and was tender, but it did not stand out for the price it was. Libation: I ordered An Affair to Remember which is prosecco served in an absinthe rinsed glass. It was very good! I'm glad I chose this cocktail over a glass of wine since it was unique. The beverage was not too sweet and not too dry. Overall experience: St Elmo was a nifty place to check out. The service was friendly, but took too long. Based on the prices, the food was ok."}, {"review_id": "KDFkp8_nGf5EncgcjZyrJA", "user_id": "Dij2J8RjZtGNikvdJD1cPg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "A bit belated on filing this review. We visited St. Elmo in February and had a phenomenal experience. We had an 8:30 reservation and were seated shortly after arriving. Waiting area and bar were very lively and crowded. We were led to an intimate table alongside a window. Server greeted us after a short wait - he was definitely oversubscribed, but offered great service. We ordered drinks, water for me (DD) martini for fiancé. (Small complaint: ice chips in martini). Bread baskets arrived - have the cheddar crisps. Amazing! We started with shrimp cocktail, which I had had before. I don't think I will get it again. I love horseradish, but the St. Elmo sauce is far too spicy. Prawns were beautiful, though! We split the BLT salad next: FYI, the bacon chunks are quite large. This is a very splittable salad. We each had the bean soup for our complimentary app...it just seems out of place, but part of the tradition. I ordered standard ribeye with mashed potatoes, she had trout special with green beans. We were both thrilled!!!  Delectable. I really appreciate St. Elmo serving high quality entrees and including a side...wish more high-end steakhouses would do so. One less decision for diners and two scoops of (amazing) mashed potatoes can't cut too far into profit margin. Finished with creme brûlée. Great! I love St Elmo, but if you're looking for a quiet meal, look elsewhere."}, {"review_id": "3xZFEXkTXFkajkmdyMs0Rw", "user_id": "ZvmZM7LBzaYbpznpHlTANA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Why 4 stars?Great spot, good food and friendly service.The steaks that I have eaten have been good but not blow me away 5 star for some reason.

I took a glance at the prices and it was way out of my budget, but then I saw that they do a 3-course Sunday dinner meal for $40, which was pretty reasonable. We arrived at 4pm for our reservation (we had to drive back to the Detroit area that night, so wanted an early dinner) and were seated immediately, and presented with the 3-course menu, which was impressive - I believe I had noted on my OpenTable reservation that we wanted that menu. I ordered the salad (I'm not a seafood eater), the 6 oz. filet mignon, and the creme brulee, and my boyfriend ordered their famous shrimp cocktail, the filet, and the raspberry cheesecake. Everything was very tasty. I had been to the Capital Grille recently for restaurant week, and the wedge salad was very similar to theirs, and served on an ice-cold plate (as is proper!). The filet was extremely tender, and the mashed potatoes were perfect too. The string beans were fine although a little salty. My boyfriend had been wanting to try the shrimp cocktail, as it's supposed to be one of the spiciest dishes in the U.S.; although he disagreed with that, he did say it had quite a kick to it. My creme brulee was very good too - I believe it had Madagascar vanilla in it, the menu said - and the raspberry cheesecake was tasty as well (I tried a bite).Overall I would definitely come back here. It's very similar to Capital Grille (and in fact, there's a CG down the street too, ha) but the old-school atmosphere is a little different; it's Indy's oldest restaurant and has been around since 1902. If it's out of your price range, consider their upstairs lounge, as well - a friend who lives in Indy said that they have the shrimp cocktail and also filet sliders, which are more affordable. Definitely one of the best meals of our trip, though, so I'm glad we went."}, {"review_id": "hgMu6hwK9OClS6cICgpnBw", "user_id": "nDq9rhtc6SSBJbl82YR5Iw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "If you come to Indy, you must experience this local fave. First off, it's pricey. Let's just get that out there. It's a very unique steakhouse. You're paying for good food in an upscale atmosphere that is truly a great experience. The food, drinks, and wait staff are amazing. Definitely don't expect Outback or Ponderosa (do those still exist?).If you have some time before your meal or are waiting for your table, be sure to visit the 1933 lounge upstairs. Swanky vibe and great drinks. Definitely a good place to start. Start off with a glass of wine or one of their cocktails. For me it's an Old Fashion! Make sure you get the Shrimp Cocktail. Brace yourself with the cocktail sauce. It's going to sting, but it's a good sting. Their Lobster Bisque is amazing and my Filet Mignon was cooked to perfection. I wish I could eat here more often. Definitely go!"}, {"review_id": "qZjVPoJZbaZVpdolYNvTHg", "user_id": "CXniy1vTyAJDWdFgkGRjYg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Came here with a group after running the Carmel Marathon. Service was pretty good, drinks were well prepared. However, i was disappointed by the food. Having had some excellent experiences at other steak restaurants in Chicago the steak here left a lot to be desired. I got the steak special of the night and it had lots of fat and was overall pretty chewy with not much flavor. Something I would expect for a steak place down the street... not when I paying 60+ for a piece of steak. The mashed potatoes were pretty good, the shrimp cocktail was different, but there was sooo much sauce that it was hard to taste anything else. Didn't get a chance to try desert, but since I already paid a fortune for a mediocre meal i figured it probably wasn't worth it. Worst part of the night.. they don't even validate for parking across the street.... laughable. I had to go to the mall and purchase a gift card to get my $20 parking validated."}, {"review_id": "aFYphkzo8e8MtIWiAgWDUw", "user_id": "ATA3zIjlmiNBZutGYN8HBQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Ok ok ok...Always see this on Sunday night football  or Monday night football .... it's free advertising but it's ok/subpar.

If you stick to this menu and order water, it's a good approach as you can get our for $100 with tip. However, who eats like that? If you're not gorging to the point of being uncomfortable, you're not truly eating. We added a drink each, ordered a side of King Crab mac and cheese ($17) and upgraded to the strip.

Sunday night late and finally got around to sampling this \"top 5\" steakhouse amid Indianapolis' wonderful selection of restaurants. First off let me just say our service was great. The wine recommendations were good, service prompt and informed. No issues there. The starters were pointless. The $11 beefsteak tomato and onions seemed like day old supermarket tomatoes tossed with vinaigrette. Regardless we figured this is not the reason we came. It's the meat. The $40-$60 steaks. For the price we had high expectations. Top 5 steakhouse in the country! We had the lamb chops and ribeye with some sides. The sides might as well have come straight from a can - but it's about the steak right? The $41 ribeye and the $59 chops. One hundred dollars of meat. At that price it has to be not just good but excellent!It was neither. The lamb chops, even at medium rare, were way undercooked, red all over and flavorless. The ribeye was similarly rushed through and burnt. There was no crust. Just burnt. I'm sure it was good meat before it reached the kitchen. I'd be happier if they just gave it to us slightly less raw than it was served and cooked it ourselves. We ate at Bluebeard and Vida the following 2 nights. Comparing our meals there to St. Elmo's just leaves an even worse taste in my mouth. Both dinners were prepared with thought and care and were absolutely delightful. And both were way less costly. If you're new in town and don't know any better, if you need to impress someone with price and not taste or experience - then this is the place for you. Otherwise do yourself a favor and eat somewhere wonderful we're you won't feel ripped off at the end."}, {"review_id": "sjdbge10YHimbKW1MYeEyw", "user_id": "5kL_t1bDR4HLDq_xNo5KZw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/23/2017", "text": "Been in IN for over a year now & have eaten here many times, its the best overall high end restaurant in Indy, bar none.

Can honestly say this place has no rival in the city.Legendary steak always meets/exceeds expectations. I've had the NY Strip, Ribeye & I've even had the Filet. They are all fantastic. I've eaten at most of the nice steak houses in NYC & Cali and St. Elmo beats the benchmark. Where it really crushes it is for the price point. All the cuts are around $40 and they INCLUDE a soup & choice of potato (tip: always get mashed, less work & more fat). Service is always incredible, its not some random 20 something hipster, you get REAL OG SERVERS. Every friend or family member that has visited me in Indy has asked me to make reservations here, I always comply. It's that restaurant people remember for years, not some hipster joint named by 2 random words that make no sense, serving random fusion & gastronomy garbage.
