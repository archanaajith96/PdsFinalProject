I didn't know that these types of diners were founded in Worcester. Originally from Buffalo, I was a little annoyed with how many patriots stickers there were everywhere (lol) We just got there in time. Shortly after we arrived a line started forming outside. If you are going to come early enough to beat the line!"}, {"review_id": "L8vB56kj4Ch2WLMYc613jA", "user_id": "Tp7fy2vewW083vLuBRgemw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/10/2017", "text": "If you have a sweet tooth, this is the place for you! Serving sizes are MASSIVE, mouth watering, and memorable. I hav never come across so many delectable varieties of stuffed French roast. We often buy one or two different kinds and split it between our family of 4. Expect to wait outside year round. This place is usually hopping and has little room inside for hungry guests, but as long as you come prepared just enjoy the experience. Seriously a must try when you are in the mood for brunch in the Woo."}, {"review_id": "OyamVFEHhoOJCYlT4PApAQ", "user_id": "xQRKaba8BfGbMQntlrWZqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "First time at this place the food was awesome!!! The portions size are HUGE. The staff is pretty friendly. My only gripe is that they are cash only. The have an ATM in the restaurant but who wants to put their card in a sketchy looking ATM. **Not I said the cat** Other than that the place is pretty small and can get real crowed during the busy times. But the food is worth it."}, {"review_id": "n5tjwuGQ9GNcYLfrelk8sw", "user_id": "awO5OFVUnfxgYV5M1N1-jw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/23/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This is our first time here and yes I am a big fan of  banana so I had to try the Honey Banana Caramel French toast omg it was Wicked Awesome !!!

The only reason I dropped a star is because of how long the wait can be (especially in cold or rainy weather) and the extreme lack of parking when it's busy (which, lets be honest, is typically 80% of the time). If you want a weekend breakfast, get here VERY early! We usually sit at the counter, which is worth it for the amazing food. The french toast and pancake specials are incredible and should not be missed out on!"}, {"review_id": "uKBNqufLZqdynz-R1faQlA", "user_id": "jtmKhXTtVgfHQGBApESYiw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "I like to give double stars if it's possible!!:) Great place for breakfast brunch or lunch!

Walking in, there's a row of booths on one side and bar seating on the other- you get to watch the food getting made if you sit on the bar side!   My friend and I split an Spanish omelette with jalapaneos, bell peppers, tomatoes, onions and a side of homefries! We also got a hearty honey, walnut, coconut french toast which was loaded with powdered sugar and whipped cream! The whipped cream melted into a delicious gooey mess and the French toast melted in your mouth. It is served with two large slices of toast with a nice crunch from the walnuts hidden between the two slices of bread! The diner had a HUGE menu ranging from pancakes to bacon and omelettes to a variety of eggs Benedict. Most importantly, the coffee has free refills!! It's the perfect way to start a weekend or recover from one. :) The diner does take cash only, but there's an ATM tucked away in the corner."}, {"review_id": "765Rk62KbsoAy54OW70vdQ", "user_id": "ovZnq_lAXjxaph5_qCefJg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/4/2016", "text": "visiting from out of town, and Buzzfeed had suggested this as a must try diner. My friends and I went, and we were not disappointed in the least.Yes parking can be hard to find, and seating as well. It's literally in an old school diner car(which makes the authenticity fun tbh). The interior has a lived in feel. In a good way.Cash only yes. But not expensive at all. And the servings/proportions are probably worth way more than what you pay for.We got two slices of the crunchy french toast and the Irish Eggs Benedict. The french toast is hands down the best I've ever had. Probably not very healthy for you, but worth it. We had leftovers to take home and enjoy for breakfast the next morning. If you're in Worcester, MA definitely hit up Miss Woo's for brunch!"}, {"review_id": "I9S9r0ONDtVKlyzM86QpZA", "user_id": "xVpgfkaNl8Ci0sOMHIdgNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/3/2017", "text": "This is the best breakfast place I've ever been to.

I've been going to Miss Worcester for several years, since I was a student at Clark U and now that I've moved to Boston.... Miss Worcester is one of the few reasons my boyfriend and I return to the Woo. My partner loves their homefries and the large variety of sweet stuffed frenchtoasts (especially the strawberry cheesecake). I'm a bigger fan of savory breakfast and tend to get the Irish breaksfast with homemade corned beef hash, SO GOOD. I enjoy the large variety of hot sauces available too.  Coffee is standard and free refills- which hits the spot. We love the food, prices and quirk/ attitude of this place. CASH ONLY. Get there early because line can be loooong on weekends.  One cool thing on Sundays is that there is a flea market located across the street that runs 9 am to 4 pm. Yesterday after our meal, we walked around and found some amazing deals.... in particular a record player and some rad compilations."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/miss-worcester-diner-worcester?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
