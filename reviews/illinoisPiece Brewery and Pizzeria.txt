I can't count how many times I've visited this place for either a night out with friends or a simple dinner. Their pizza is made with fresh ingredients, and even the crust is super tasty.I highly recommend the red sauce and barbecue sauce pizzas, both are great! And if you're looking for a splurge, adding goat cheese really puts it over the top. They also have a great variety of beers available, and it's awesome that you can try a new one each time."}, {"review_id": "VN_eoaGm8ctP384am_1Utw", "user_id": "YWe4W6vqlouLu5u1Qj1AXA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Went on a recent trip to Chicago on a Sunday night and got in without a wait, but it was pretty busy otherwise. There are ample TVs if you're looking for a sports game.I was surprised by the menu in that they only have one signature pizza, but it is otherwise a make your own structure. They offer white, red, and a tomato base (no mozzarella, for the lactose intolerant).My buddy and I ordered a medium (feeds 2-3 people, but actually more like 4, unless you are a large Norwegian midwestern type). The pizza was great, good crust with a nice garlic finish. The servers were extremely kind and accommodating as our party size changed frequently throughout the meal. Overall, a good spot to watch a sports game and enjoy a few beer."}, {"review_id": "F8P1p8tJ9SSS79Hn-R6HKQ", "user_id": "f6v7OewBFV93YNZEwPY6TA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "This place is underrated.  It's in the heart of Wicker Park. Every time I see posts on social media asking for recommendations for places to eat in Chicago, I ALWAYS throw this place on that list.  This was the first pizza restaurant that I tried when I moved to Chicago for a year.  You can customize your pizza.  It's extraordinarily fresh, comes out quickly, and goes great with their self-brewed beer.Although I advocate for deep dish as well, do not overlook the experience that this place has to offer!"}, {"review_id": "r8JBrbLeqWBasH6J_Zt-xA", "user_id": "CfKT4Pr7QYIUlcq4fnKfgg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Though chicken and beer is probably my favorite heavy food combination of all time, pizza and beer comes pretty close. Piece does an excellent job at bringing this combo together with in house brews and any pizza combination you can imagine. I would have really liked to top the pizza with more toppings, but with the price being kinda hefty per topping, we kept it pretty minimum. We ordered a red medium pizza with basil, italian sausage, and jalapenos for just two people. A small would have been fine but leftovers!! The beers were great with this pizza. I would like to try the white pizza next time, but we had to stick with a classic this first time around. Service was attentive and quick too. Overall, the ambiance here is fun and lively- perfect for all sorts of groups to come and grub out."}, {"review_id": "Ef8N7ML4oWUZNOASEEBWlw", "user_id": "5olC3yCfdCpU-b-MV5z_MA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Solid pizza place with good music. Came in for lunch on a Saturday and got a pizza and one of their house made brews. Pizza was solid and the flavor was on point. The beer was good and they have a nice rotating selection so things never get old. Staff was friendly enough, not overbearing, but there if you needed something. Good atmosphere and I plan to check it out in the evening as ove heard it's much better and more lively."}, {"review_id": "95s0UBiKU4JWh90AWrBVpw", "user_id": "3tGdfi5jKfolONmDdYkyLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Amazing pizza!

As a result, you could end up waiting outside in the cold for a good chunk of time.

If you have friends in town: Piece! If you want a fun ambiance: Piece! If you want awesome beer and tasty pizza: Piece! (Do you see where I'm going with this? When in doubt, Piece!) Great on-site brewery. Such fun pizza creations at your fingertips. You can pick between White or Red pizza and start loading on your toppings. (Mashed potatoes are a head scratcher, but trust me, it's a good choice.) They also collaborate with local restaurants/chefs and create a pizza of a month concoction. It's always delicious! There isn't a bad thing about this joint.Wait there is... but I'm not going to knock a star because everything else more than makes up for it. The seating is somewhat hit or miss depending where you're seated. If you're sitting against the wall, the tables are so insanely narrow that you're practically on top of your neighbors. If you're sitting in the middle at the high-top tables, you're only comfortable for so long.

They have their own beers and a large variety of other beer as well. The pizza is great I've has their bbq chicken pizza and it was excellent. So this time it was 4 of us and we ordered a large pizza. Now before you order you should have a plan it's they have so many toppings and it can get expensive and overwhelming. We ordered a tomato pie style pizza. The crust and is tomato sauce, garlic, and fresh parmesan that they shread. We went a little topping crazy with Garlic, onions, peppers,meatballs, spinach and giardinera on the side. The bar is huge which is plus if you have a group. I'll definetly be back with a plan, or just order one of their regular pizzas."}, {"review_id": "X6fTELHhDC4uxwCQlZDlCQ", "user_id": "etSmDKbFVRwP4VTkHjsD2Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Had lunch here the other day... the meatball sandwich was delicious and the perfect size- it came with some plain chips.   We  also had pizza that was pretty good.

The hot doug wasn't as good as the white sauce but still tasted very good!

This is our favorite Wicker Park pizza place. If you are going during peak dinning hours be prepared to wait. If you are lucky enough you might be able to find a place at their bar and order some of their award winning brews. The serve white and red sauce pizza. I just am not a white sauce person so I have no idea how it is...but their red sauced pizza are great. When we first started going here we just built our own. Then we learned about the Hot Doug's Atomic Pizza. OMG, jackpot!!!  My tastebuds couldn't be more satisfied. I can't order any other pizza since our discovery. It's a red sauce pizza with spicy sausage from Doug Sohn and cartelized onions covered with pepper jack cheese. SO GOOD!!They have a full bar but when you are in a brewery, you should get beer. Which is what I did. My staple is the top heavy hefeweizen or Golden Arm but I was feeling adventurous so I ordered the Dark n Curvy. It didn't disappoint.PRO-TIP: They have a Sunday take out special.

It's like the food trifecta! Woot woot!I went last week with some friends for a chill night. I was immediately met by a really cool, trendy vibe. Despite being packed and not a super small place, it still had a locals/everyone knows everyone vibe. We grabbed a few beers from the bar and had a super short wait before being sat. I had \"The Weight,\" Which was a perfect pale ale. Throughout the night, our table also had a few of \"Roadhouse\" and \"You've Got Mail.\" Happy campers all around!We got a large red pizza with pepperoni, sautéed mushrooms and black olives. The pepperoni had a bit of a kick, which I loved. You could also taste that the mushrooms had been seasoned and sautéed prior to baking on the pizza. This makes a huge difference in the flavor and I loved it! And the size of this thing! Huge! Service was also great.

The service and the food were really good although they don't believe in spatulas. So you kind of have to be careful the minute you get the Pizza, which tasted really really good, you have to actually maneuver the plate underneath the piece you want otherwise everything just slides off. So we had 2 Ryan's that helped us, one was our server and he was a pretty nice guy and very informative, and and was very social when I was asking some questions about the place..
