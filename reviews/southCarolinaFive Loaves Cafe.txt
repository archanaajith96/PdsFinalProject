We joined the waitlist through Yelp and only had to wait about 35-40 minutes for a table. Once seated, we waited without acknowledgment from any waitstaff for about 5 minutes. Finally, the hostess came over to us and let us know our server was very busy so she would be taking our order. The hostess seemed very busy herself but she was sweet and offered helpful recommendations. We ordered a cold brew coffee and the Rachel juice from their juice bar. The Rachel is a combination of apple, beet, lemon and ginger. The hostess came back to inform us the juice bar was out of apples and pineapples and would we like to sub something else for the apple. She suggested grapefruit in its place. Sadly, we could only taste the beet and nothing else. This was not worth the $6.50 price tag. The cold brew coffee was flavorful but very gritty with ground beans. Something I really loved was that you can order half sandwiches and mix and match. This was very exciting for me as I like to try a little bit of everything! I ordered the half chicken salad sandwich and the half ham and Brie panini. The chicken salad was fine, nothing special. The ham and Brie panini was exceptional! It was topped with pickled red cabbage and green tomato jam. I couldn't get enough! We also ordered the Southern Benny which is a culmination of everything southern and delicious - crab cakes, fried green tomatoes, pimento cheese, and old bay hollandaise. It was delicious! Definitely order this if you stop in. Something worth noting is that they offer a soup sampler trio of three 3-oz pours of the 3 daily soups. We were a little too hot to have soup, but I loved this idea! Even though the beginning of our meal was a little rough, we left happy and satisfied with our choices!"}, {"review_id": "C4NOSonXnBcTLVFY_xSvHw", "user_id": "2i0A5OoKyiwskqvnkGq7cA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "I came in for lunch and found it pretty busy. The No Wait said there was no line and the only open seats were at a communal table. Not a problem, I'm flexible. Service was SLOW. No one took my order for 10-15 minutes. The couple who sat next to me  ordered not long after I sat down, got their food, and finished as I got my food. I ordered, kale juice and half a Portobello sandwich. Everything was decent, good flavors.I had an issue, but the waitress didn't check in. Someone else had to run my check and run the card (not stopping to check in). I only saw her again as she handed me back the receipt to sign. I told her the issue at that point, but a little too late on my end. She was kind enough to follow up afterwards, but definitely felt service was lacking. Not sure it's worth coming back as I didn't enjoy the overall experience even though the food was solid."}, {"review_id": "sUFF5zQnwFXvr2R_RHwo7w", "user_id": "2OBiw7J5alFQF2Vs_AiNqA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/25/2017", "text": "I love five loaves cafe and I bring my friends and family there every time and I believe everyone should eat the southern Benny in their lifetime.This would be a five star review if it wasn't for my last visit in which we found shards  of glass in the home fries (side item with a main dish)  . We sent them back and refused to get a new side.  We didn't want to make a big deal about the fact but emphatically warned the waitress to make sure no one else had the same experience .When we asked for the check I was expecting the glass containing meal to be comped or discounted given that the side contained a giant piece of glass and we ended up sending it back,  but alas, we were charged full price for everything .

Five Loaves has been a staple in my life since college, and they've only gotten better with time! If coming for lunch, I'm always sure to get the marinated chicken sandwich on baguette and a 3-soup sampler (because who can pick just one?!) I love the potato-broccoli-cheddar, which is one of the best potato-based soups I've had anywhere, hands down.For dinner, their tricolor tortellini is my absolutely favorite. I've been a bunch of times and sampled lots of different menu options and specials, and I can say that I've literally never (not 1 single time) had something I didn't like.

It was dim but candles were lit.We ordered: eggplant fritters, sweat pea falafel, the Thai coconut hot pot, and chocolate cake.The eggplant fritters and sweat pea falafel looked and tasted pretty similar, to be honest. The Thai coconut hot pot with pan fried tofu was obviously not the most authentic tasting but it was fine.For dessert we got the chocolate cake. I saw them bring it out from the fridge from a cardboard box. It looked like the frozen cakes I used to sell for fundraisers in elementary school. It was a huge slice though, and not that bad for a pre-made/mass produced cake.Overall, the food isn't Michelin-quality or anything but it's on par with the price and what I expected.

Looked like some great reviews and we were excited! Overall, ambiance was great. Plenty of seating and great place to meet up with friends or eat out with coworkers. We got the soup sampler, the chicken salad, and the reuben. We both got sourdough which was decent. The reuben turkey was bold and savory, but the quantity of the meat was not there. The chicken salad itself was tasty but my wife was only able to find half of a grape just a couple onions and small scoop of avocado that had been spread on her bread in her chicken salad. What could have been a great sandwich was just average. In addition, for the price point it would have been nice to have a side of chips or some other side. The soups were delicious, but came out only slightly above luke warm. Service was decent especially during a busy lunch. Overall came hungry, left hungry. Would recommend this place for a light meal, but if you are looking for fuel for the day, look elsewhere. Not a place that I would come back to as a tourist in Charleston.

The soup trio is an amazing option and a great deal for what you get. The Caesar salad is the best I've ever had!

The chicken pesto sandwich is another good choice, it's a very big portion so be careful not to order too much food if you get this. Service is usually always fast and good. This is hands down my favorite place to grab lunch if I'm in the area. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I feel like most of the sandwiches and drinks are overpriced.

YUM. The cheese grits were awesome--I don't even like grits, but I loved these! The prices were pretty reasonable, being about $12/pp. Another plus is that there is a little gravel parking lot across the street from the restaurant that has spaces reserved for this restaurant.

The soup, the sandwiches, and the salads. Oh wait, that's the entire menu :). Ok, get a soup sampler and the marinated chicken breast sandwich then.. and if you're still hungry, the Cobb salad too, and finish with a glass of sweetened iced tea!~Some girlfriends and I were in town for a bachelorette and came to Five Loaves for lunch as our first meal after landing in Charleston. We walked 30 mins through heavy rain, and by the time we arrived to Five Loaves, we were tired, wet, hungry, and in need of some comfort food. And boy, did Five Loaves deliver! They seated us at a tall communal table, nestled in the back corner (there were only two other people at the table, so we still had a good amount of privacy). Most of us got the soup sampler (where they give you 3oz (I think) pours of three kinds of soup), for those who wanted to them all. I got the potato, broccoli, and cheddar; tomato tarragon with crab meat; and Mexican chicken chili with avocado and cilantro. The favorite of our group was the tomato tarragon. My favorite was the potato, broccoli, and cheddar, but thought it would've tasted better without the broccoli. The chicken chili soup was good.. tasted like a taco in soup form almost. Can't go wrong with a sampler!I also ordered a sweetened ice tea, which was light and refreshing, and the half marinated chicken breast sandwich on multigrain bread. It was a pretty decent size (I was stuffed after finishing my soup sampler and the sandwich).. and it was one of the most AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS chicken sandwiches I've ever had. The chicken was cooked perfectly and so juicy, and everything in the sandwich worked well together (although I picked out the red onions since I'm not a fan of raw onions). Bonus was that everything tasted so fresh, was healthy but still delicious, was locally sourced, and Five Loaves strives to be sustainable and eco-friendly.Can't remember everything everyone else in my group ordered (only remember the Cobb salad, which looked amazinggg, and the acai bowl) but everyone was very happy with their food. I don't think it really matter what you order because Five Loaves is one of those places where everything you order will be good.They were able to give all eight of us separate checks which was really nice -- don't think anywhere in NYC would have the patience to do that (although later in the trip we got lazy and started doing just the one check).If I am ever in town again, I would absolutely come back here to try the rest of their lunch menu, and also pop in for Sunday brunch as well.
