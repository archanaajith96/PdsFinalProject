This place has been on my radar for years and I finally made the trip.All of their dishes are piled on top of a large flat bread. The idea is to eat with your hands so no silverware is given out. I had the Zil zil and ordered it spicy. Flat out delicious. It's similar to barbecue beef. Their spiced tea is crazy good. I wanted to try their coffee but it's not available past 10am unless you call ahead.Overall I think Lalibela is one of my top 5 ethnic restaurants"}, {"review_id": "tQ2bILnsPKvN7iewdDLPBA", "user_id": "dvsMjUdVv-ECaxAzCQ7zxw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "This is a very moderate looking place but very neatly kept. My coworker introduced me to this place and once I got introduced, I have been here many times as this is the best place for Ethiopian food in Omaha. I love the combination platter. If you can eat, it is an 'Eat all you want' platter and there is a variety of meat. As I am a person who likes small portions, I like to share the combination platter with someone. Only thing which I find missing is they do not serve alcohol. The price is very reasonable and the service is quick and courteous. What goes best - food, combination platter, serviceWhat could be improved - The place closes at 9 and they do last order at 8:45, wish it is open a bit longer."}, {"review_id": "cf7gbGSSmmpJOSeoT5EGUg", "user_id": "l63QwNwi7175v69eGIqH_A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "Food is nicely presented and seems very authentic. We got the combo platter with chicken as our meat. The portion was huge and big enough to fill two. Did not like the vegetables - very bland. But egg & meat in the middle was very good. The Ethiopian spiced tea is also delicious - I recommend everyone get this. Overall, I had a good experience at this place.

I had no idea what to expect as far as flavors. My husband and I wanted to try something different so we came here. The gentleman greeted us and we had the choice of table. We ordered the combination platter,  which was tasty. I had the spiced tea and hubby had the mango juice. We did get extra injera because apparently we were going through it faster than the food! So don't be too dainty, tear off some injera and use it to pick up a healthy bite of food.  It was an experience I'm glad we had.  GO DUCKS!!"}, {"review_id": "JidT5Fa-CrkyFSWip-rtpg", "user_id": "kbyxFChwMzukTasy9lRHTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "I stopped here for lunch while traveling through Omaha and really enjoyed it. The restaurant is nicely decorated with fun Ethiopian rugs, paintings, and trinkets. Their menu isn't very large, but it has enough variety to suffice. I got the combination plate, in order to try a bit of everything - and it was all delicious. I also got the spices tea, which was nice for a chilly winter day. Note that traditional Ethiopian food is eaten with your hands - so if you want the full experience, prepare to get a little messy (and perhaps don't come here for a fancy date)! Stop by this family-run restaurant if you want a delicious, authentic Ethiopian meal."}, {"review_id": "qHcSlACzD4yS3h0_icPsCw", "user_id": "pozrBI9PGiw7i6XYUHD9rw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "This was our first time trying Ethiopian food - it was amazing! Our waitress was kind and explained everything to us so we felt more confident ordering. She recommended the Gored Gored which my husband and his friend ordered, I had the vegetarian platter, and I can't remember what my friend ordered but really everything was delicious. The Gored Gored had a great spicy flavor but wasn't too spicy. Everything on the veggie platter was incredible. The spiced lentils and salad mixed really stole the show for me though. I also had the spiced tea which was pleasant and sweet. Overall an amazing place (that also does takeout!) - the portions are gigantic and we probably could have shared 2 dishes between the four of us but I'm glad we tried a variety. We will definitely be adding this to our list of favorites!"}, {"review_id": "ZQDo7ZkR-YQVbZADd_QgaQ", "user_id": "aeW1yNqVNocQ_NacoQQTxA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/11/2017", "text": "Go with the combo platter because you and I both know you have no clue about Ethiopian food (hey, neither do I. It's ok to Own it). We added the Lamb, but without it there's still plenty of food to split between 2 hungry folk. This is authentic Ethiopian cuisine served in the traditional style. The food has plenty of flavor and the dishes are accompanied by lots of injera (the spongy bread) to devour.  Service is friendly and fast. The tea is delicious.

My first impression was that the place is cozy and good for families with kids. The music was good and the place felt comfortable. The owner came to our table and was very friendly. My wife got the meat platter and I got the vegetarian one. And that was a lot of food. I literally was food by eating one third of my platter. The food tasted like home cooked food made with love. It also felt healthy in my body, like a complete nutritional meal for a price so affordable I couldn't believe it. We also ordered the spiced tea and when our cups were empty the owner came and asked if we would like a refill. I only give 5 star review to restaurants when I'm very happy with the meal and experience.

The pieces were cut smaller and reminded me a lot of a steak fajita.  The stand outs were the lentils and the jalapeno puree.  Overall, I felt like it was a great bargain  but felt like they could have done a bit more with the flavor.  The owner was extremely nice."}, {"review_id": "8iKGiRih7Q4Q68iDglWYVQ", "user_id": "jn-2jTkni17OC9TDE6Xczg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "This is a great restaurant if you are looking to try something new with your whole family.

Lalibela does not fit in the category. The website claimed that the restaurant is open till 9PM. I went at 8.15 pm and was rushed into ordering and given not so nice treatment as I walked in when the kitchen was closing. Not really nice for customers to feel unwanted!The food could use improvement as well since there were few Ethopian curries and more Americanized dishes. On the vegetarian platter I was served salad with Injera which I never expected since Ethopian cuisine has many more curries like Buticha, Shiro, Misir Wat...I was not entirely happy with experience."}, {"review_id": "v_AMRcMfds1cQfSia8Nvgg", "user_id": "9S3qZ3lhKoCHsh17Hy2yZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/8/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Great food and very reasonable priced.
