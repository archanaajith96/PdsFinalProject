We were seated immediately and there was no wait. Food was good, nothing extraordinary. Service was okay. Atmosphere is dim and not enough light but tables offer ambient, romantic setting. They have tables on the outside and inside. Server couldn't recommend anything past what was offered for the specials of the day. Did not give bread until we asked for it. Gave us a cup of tea and the cup had a huge lipstick stain on it. After that, we all lost our appetite. We brought it to the attention of our server and she apologized but did not offer any discounts or to bring us another one. Not her fault, but it ruined the whole experience for us. Got our check and left quick.*** Important to Note: left substantial tip regardless of service BUT my tip was adjusted to reflect more than I agreed to. Don't know if it was the server or establishment but my server was someone by the name of Helen C."}, {"review_id": "e-bWGIBzOAF_D3ySp_9l9w", "user_id": "OFpFCzqRU4nxi3MuPIPIvQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "We dined here since it was pretty close to our hotel and it had a lot of reviews.

When you walk in you immediately are in their cafe where you can purchase desserts, breads, and drinks. They sat us in the back dining room where there is a lot of green plants and trees around you. It's a very nice setting and perfect for dining out and having good conversations. The menu is comprised of a lot of classic dishes. We went with the Carbonara pasta dish which is made with a nice cream sauce, bacon, sweet peas, prosciutto, and mozzarella. It was prepared so well and tasted wonderful. I have to mention that the bread and bruschetta they serve you beforehand is to die for. The baguette was baked to perfection and almost wanted to take a loaf home!"}, {"review_id": "iA6K4SGcRpyuqkCFrCXprQ", "user_id": "ZbbWBJA0OuLFFn9AdsicLQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Wanted to get a nice meal with a great view so we came here. The place is tucked away behind greenery and has a deck that's open for seating. Inside the store is a cute market where you can grab a few things to eat along with sweets. We were greeted by the hostess and requested to be seated outside. Despite it being late on a Saturday we were seated immediately which was great. In order to get to the outside you walk through another indoor seating section which was also nicely done. We took a table in the back and our waiter came over introducing himself and pouring water. He gave us a few minutes to look over before he came back with drink orders. We ended up getting the baked Brie, antipasto, and calamari to share as appetizers. While we waited we looked over the main dishes some more before coming to a decision. As the appetizers came out we placed our main order. During the appetizers I looked around and noted how nice the place was. Since the weather was nice the ceiling was open and the tree branches swayed above. The dim lighting all around made the space feel intimate but casual at the same time. It would be a great space for a special dinner or if you wanted to just have a nice meal but not all dressed up it would work also. The appetizers were amazing, we all fell in love with the baked Brie, it went wonderfully with the grapes. The calamari was great too, I didn't have to dip it in the marinara. The antipasto was great, a wonderful sized portion. A while after we finished the first round the main dishes came out and they smelled great. I had the Perricone's Classic Cioppino and my friend had the jumbo lobster ravioli in the coral pink sauce per the waiters suggestion. One person had the special and another had the Potato Gnocchi. My food was amazing, the bits of salmon and ahi tuna were great, the clams done wonderfully and the shrimp was great. I even had one of my friends jumbo ravioli and that thing really lived up to its name. One bite of that and I knew that would be my dish next time. The meal was beyond filling, I couldn't even finish it. The bill was only $33 for me since I had wine and an entree which wasn't bad. If you're visiting I would definitely be sure to have a meal here."}, {"review_id": "yxM0wpmcqfqyUZT1XSrHSQ", "user_id": "JkpJ7EWztKKJi2kt-s0HAA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/30/2017", "text": "$10.00 Pasta Thursday's! This Italian Cuisine Themed Restuarant extinguished my Pasta craving ever so nicely. So much that I still feel my heart smiling hours later. ;)I highly recommend this place. Very nice and intimate setting in case you would like to bring a date or impress a significant other. The prices are very reasonable, service was good, and I love how they had a elegant presence of trees and plants flowing through the interior of the restaurant. I know I mentioned the pasta special they have on Thursdays , but they have a pretty big selection of other entrees that read very well on paper. I saw a couple being delivered to guests that struck my interest as well. There's a lot of options and it might be overwhelming trying to make a decision on what to pick. But that's what your handy dandy server is there for!Oh yeah while I was there they have Half Off select Wines (Merlot & Pinot Grigio). My Merlot complimented my Lasagna quite well!Also your parking can be validated if you choose to valet."}, {"review_id": "6--brbjQOPWhkIebimuqzQ", "user_id": "3cJ5DVoG1O_GzmueLQqLwg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "We had a wonderful time at Perricone's! The atmosphere is stunning, beautifully lit and has trees all around it (and inside the restaurant). We learned that it was an old barn that the owner found in Vermont -- which was shipped to Miami piece by piece. The music was so good: a single musician playing guitar which added even more to the ambiance. Lovely. Second, the food was outstanding -- we started with the turkey meatballs and sauce appetizer (which was giant and nobody ever has turkey meatballs) -- definitely get this if you go there. They served it with crusty bread and the sauce is stellar.  For dinner I had chicken parmigiana and my date had chicken with penne (delicious garlicky sauce). Top notch dinner. We finished our meal (my birthday dinner) with a wonderful tiramisu... the perfect ending to a wonderful dinner.

Dining near all the plants and greenery was a unique experience that I enjoyed. That definitely was my favorite part. The food also was very good. I was with a large group and was able to sample a little bit of everyone's food. Instead of bringing just bread, tables are given bruschetta that was delicious. The tomatoes were extremely ripe and the dish was amazing, a great way to start a meal! Our table ordered the lobster ravioli, pear and Gorgonzola ravioli, ahi tuna salad, Alfredo, and chicken parmesan. Everyone was pleased with their order. I particularly liked the pear ravioli, because pear is not something I usually associate with a pasta dish. However it was extremely rich and savory.

Upon seating we were greeted with daily specials as well as a Miami spice menu. Prices were reasonable, $20 range for a pasta dish or appetizer which are made to share and a wide variety of entrées. The Baked Brie appetizer which is what drew me in to the place was delicious. Served with plenty of crackers and a bunch of different fruits. Calamari was crisp and tasty. I ordered a small salad, which I pictured as a traditional Apple, Walnut, and Gorgonzola cheese type dish. I did not love the type of lettuce it came with, half of it was the in edible frizzy type, and there were shredded carrots involved for some reason. Everything else we tasted was delicious.

I'll admit I have never been here not on a Thursday so it makes it hard for me to judge the crowd/menu outside this context. My most recent experience at Perricone's was a Thursday work lunch. Anyone who's ever been to the area knows that parking around here is expensive and inconvenient but that has never deterred me from coming or having a wonderful experience because it is so worth it.On this visit out waiter was on point. We were a party of 8 with reservations. We were seated outside in a corner, very comfy and cozy. The waiter/s were attentive to our table, were unphased at the request for separate checks, and accommodated gluten-free restrictions in such a polite manner. They brought out multiple bread baskets and the chopped tomato to start and I was thankful it was plenty of bread because we were all starving. Everyone ordered of their $10 pasta menu and none of us were disappointed. The portions are just right for the average person, some I think are even too big, all of us had left-overs which they gladly helped us boxed. Each dish was flavorful and presented beautifully. I ordered the Shrimp veggie pasta (can't remember the name) and was surprised to see it had a variety of very plump shrimp (not just 2). Other people at the table had the grilled chicken pasta, the lasagna (SO GOOD!, looks small but its very filling), the seafood medley one which honestly I think looked the best, it was a lot of clams/mussels, there was also a gluten free pasta dish. Their gluten-free options are great because you can essentially make any of their dishes gluten free (few exceptions) which means you aren't limited to just 1 or 2 options. Basically we all ordered something different and shared. Nothing was disappointing. My personal favorite was the desserts, especifically the flour-less chocolate cake. We also ordered the tiramisu and some other chocolate cake. But the flour-less cake had to be taken away from me because it was so good I couldn't put it down. It's rich with a smooth texture that just melts in your mouth.Perricone's is totally worth a trip. Come check it out on Thursday's if you are unsure if you'll like it because the normal menu can be pricey otherwise. Always a great customer service experience, there's a lot of options (even for none pasta eaters) and their market at the front will entice with beautiful aesthetically pleasing pastries, cookies, chocolates, ice cream, you name it!"}, {"review_id": "Sq9kJ-3qa8VeqxYdZXvU9Q", "user_id": "GckyRT8IO2yNXQ_4jnFcgw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/19/2017", "text": "Perricone's is literally a perfect date night restaurant. Initially, street parking can be a pain with very limited options, and it definitely won't be on the same block as the restaurant. But, there is also an option to validate, where it is typically $20 but they can validate it and it is only $8. We definitely did not want courtyard, because in summer Miami weather some outdoor seating is just not that enjoyable. So we went to do the indoor dining, where they then took us to the outdoor space, but it was still very enjoyable. It had the greenery and views of an outdoor space, with the AC and temperature of an indoor space. There were several options from the menu, but I decided to indulge and get the fettuccine alfredo. There were so many other healthier options, but I was really craving pasta that day. The pasta was delicious, but I may have told the waiter to put way too much Parmesan cheese. When I mixed the cheese in, it became a little bit thicker than it was supposed to. Either way, it was super delicious and oily, as fettuccine alfredo should be. Our waiter was so attentive and super polite. He kept coming to refill our drinks, and was very quick and efficient. For deserts, there were so many good options... I was happy to see a tiramisu, because that's my favorite desert. I thought it was extremely fluffy and light, so it was pretty much perfection. My boyfriend ordered the New York style cheesecake. Though the cheesecake didn't taste bad per say, it was crustless. I am sure it might have said it in the description, but who bothers to read descriptions of cheescake. I'm not even sure why crustless cheesecakes exists, but unfortunately it does and it is served here. Other than that, Perricone's is a sweet spot for a dinner or brunch, and I would definitely come back here."}, {"review_id": "Ka6XuUh8qvLdAnPkOyCyYw", "user_id": "2W2kiWw-WrIk9UYLpyGldA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "I used to come here frequently when I worked in the area several years ago and tonight, after visiting Brickell City Center with friends and seeing long lines everywhere to eat, we decided to have dinner here (no line).  Two of the plates we ordered were inedible: the calamari  appetizer and the chicken marsala...

The restaurant is very clean and so beautiful. I love that they have indoor and outdoor seating.

I came here for their \"Pasta Thursday\" special which is $10. Great deal!!!!  I ordered the shrimp capellini which to me just really lacked flavor.  The food needed some more seasoning and maybe some herbs. My sauce was watery. My friend ordered the chicken parmesan and felt that her food needed more flavor as well. I was disappointed that they do not offer freshly grated cheese but instead store bought type cheese that they just sprinkle on your food. In all honesty though I do believe that the food was a great deal for $10 as it was a good portion size of food. I must say that the quality of food was good. I can tell my pasta was authentic homemade pasta and the shrimp were very fresh. Both the pasta and shrimp were cooked perfectly.                                                                                    Our service was greattttttt. I ordered a glass of wine but didn't like it and asked to switch to another wine. The waiter took it away and immediately brought me another with no problem. The drinks, bread, salad and food came out pretty fast. The waiter was on top of everything and really made our experience enjoyable. There was another guy there who checked on us a few times. I am not sure who he was but he was very attentive. This place has great customer service and they really care about their customers.  We debated whether or not to order dessert but decided against it.  On our way out we had to pass by the delicious looking dessert counter to exit the restaurant and we could not resist ourselves. I had a scoop of ice cream and my friend had one of the decadent chocolates. Both of us were very satisfied with our choices.  After we left the restaurant we went outside to the garden area which is absolutely beautiful. We walked through the area and made our way to some benches and just sat down, talked and took in all the beauty around us.               Although I was not thrilled with my food I will definitely be back very soon."}, {"review_id": "aDIClxZcqMHZXum7JwgypA", "user_id": "tlizoBq7xkYnd8UOS9JqpQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "I had the Gorgonzola pasta and added grilled skirt steak to it... amazing.
