Their breads are fresh with different textures; my favorite is the crusted Italian bread that's super tough on the outside, but soft inside. They offer a wide variety of premade options but are open to customization as well. They also have great vegetarian options! These sandwiches are perfect to pack and take on a picnic. My favorite is the roasted red pepper sandwich with artichoke. Loaded inside the crusted bread are roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, soft mozzarella, slices of tomato and large basil leaves. Dripping in olive oil, of course. With a side of a banana pepper and green olive. The ingredients are so simple but the taste is REFRESHING."}, {"review_id": "vekXXnycb-qPokLDRFa43w", "user_id": "REeDIo1TE7chHp01dR8EGw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2017", "text": "I feel like I gotta throw some love to this little gem, as we had a stellar lunch here this afternoon before our visit to the Rockford Discovery Center. Thanks to Yelp for finding this one. Quality is the word that we uttered as we made our way through the lunch. From the stellar bread on my Italian beef panini to the hand filled cannolli to the homemade soup and olive mixes, their attention to detail did not go unnoticed. The store is quaint and beautiful and filled with delicious Italian delicacies. I would probably be here at least once a week, if I lived in the area. Overall, a incredibly pleasant find, and we'll be back next time we're in the area."}, {"review_id": "0JEhmurQU_rovM_ieFyklw", "user_id": "K2Fk-kBQPxjlL4aLwzWwZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "This is an awesome little local store.  I love browsing through all the imported items they stock!  They carry my favorite jarred marinara which I can't find anywhere else.  Their panini are absolutely delicious and their soups are yummy too!  The owner is really welcoming and treats you like an old friend.  I'll drive the extra few miles to this place before I step foot in Panera or Mary's Market-way better for about the same price!"}, {"review_id": "bzL561gcc-pRwkyuJnuyew", "user_id": "UAsykMFqXRBBqn08hp1JwA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/9/2017", "text": "We had a 40th anniversary dinner for about 50 guests back in April. Our original catering plans fell through and my sisters and I had to scramble at the last minute to figure out, \"plan B\" Anthony and his crew totally pulled through for us! Anthony worked with us and put together some amazing antipasto platters! Our guest enjoyed them very much along with tiramisu and the mini canollis were a huge hit!!! Thank you again Anthony for the amazing customer service! Such a pleasure to work with you and your team! Will definitely use them for any future catering events!"}, {"review_id": "EcicSNMNeqePEyArUqUsOg", "user_id": "0bOzo3ZNQj-UUhgHTBvCMQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/29/2017", "text": "Everyone is always so nice and welcoming when I come in, which makes it enticing to come back. I love their variety of menu options, especially for vegetarians. Their soups are always so good, and always taste authentic. I think other types of salads would be a good addition, but you really can't go wrong with their caprese salad. Most definitely a lunch time favorite!"}, {"review_id": "cpz_bzl-QD16TLt4jQ-S0w", "user_id": "J1-aWYMpkipmhk-pjcPzKQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/10/2017", "text": "Quaint. Charming.

The paninis are top notch, with my favorite being the roast beef and you've gotta get a side of hot giardiniera with it. Also, every time I go, I have to get an order of pepper shooters. But my favorite by far is the grilled Italian sausage on Thursdays.  Not only is the sausage excellent, the roll is perfect. If you're wasting your time at Subway, you don't know what living as all about.

Panini was huge, and it was so good and flavorful that I took the other half home, to MY other half, because I just had to share the experience with some one else! The tiramisu was perfect..light, with not too much or too little flavor...which is hard to find. They have a deli case with a good selection of cured Italian meats and unique cheeses. They also have some private label sauces and relishes available for purchase. The prices here are definitely a splurge, but in flavor and quality...they are worth every penny!"}, {"review_id": "XJ1I2Mu0q_omG8m6GKoGsA", "user_id": "kq0emTsKE2DcDOWbe1NYRg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/7/2016", "text": "Went here for lunch with my wife today.

They are great warm (the cheesy gets that gooey-goodness) or even cold. When you get there- just stand in line and order and grab a seat (if you are lucky enough to get one) or take it to go. The foccacia that is used to make the sandwiches is perfectly seasoned and baked (and it doesn't hurt your jaw when chewing after time) and the fillers whether meats, veggies +/- cheese-- will be perfect.

It's really clean and has a gentle feel. Staff is super nice and willing to help. They also have a small market of foods that you can shop and buy if you wantedThe food is very good and fresh (literally saw them slice it in front of me). Sandwich was $6.75 (I got their Italian sandwich) and my drink was $1.85.  Total was $9 and something. I would come again if I was on a date or wanted something fresh and good. A little expensive but not too bad. And the bread to meat ratio is very good. Better then the traditional subway or Panera."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/ditullios-italian-market-and-cafe-rockford?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
