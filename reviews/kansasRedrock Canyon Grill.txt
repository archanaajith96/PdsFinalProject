The dressing is Devine!!  One of the gals had the Chicken which is also amazing.  Redrock is such a great place to take someone special...or a group of girls, like we did for a Birthday event!  So much fun!The Shrimp-Cargot was not as amazing as expected in the review below, but was very good.  The shrimp was a little chewy and it basically was just Havarti in garlic butter.Wont stop us from coming back!!!"}, {"review_id": "gxMDhBgnsT8tX2AhbAAWAg", "user_id": "f4HSWrUckmvgGxODaCbudw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "I give this place a 3.5, round down in this case because certainly not a four.  Good for large groups or to sit at the bar.

I believe that every single item on a menu should be great, especially when it's supposed to be a great restaurant. I am going to start out by saying that I am vegetarian. I asked the waitress for suggestions, told her that I don't eat meat. Got a few suggestions such as, you should try our fish, it's great, . No more questions after that answer. So today I had the veggie platter, it's comes with seasonal veggies. Is it possible to make a veggie play any worse ? I am speechless, 1/2 cup of cuscus ( the only thing I could taste was olive oil)  , one cold tomato, some cold old fries, half of one small zucchini, half of one small squash, and one frozen  corn on the cob. All this for only 15$ . I understand that this restaurant is focused on meat, but this is beyond unacceptable !

Served with redskin mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetable.  Delicious and you get two big Chops. One to eat and one to take home, or better yet if you are on a budget you can share with someone else.

We were seated after a short wait, and then ordered a couple appetizers.  After the appetizers came out, our waiter disappeared before we could place our dinner order.

Ask your server - they don't offer these up willingly.  Dessert... I can't believe I ate that, too, but I did.  Key lime pie that'll make you pucker and keep right on eating.

We were early for supper (5:30) and there was already a good size crowd (Friday thing?). Although there was plenty of seating inside, we were seated on the closed-in patio which seemed odd since it was approx 5 degrees outside. The temp out there had two settings: molten lava when the heaters were on, Icelandic freezing when they were off. The service was great. We split a great bottle of wine and ordered calamari which we both enjoyed. I opted for the veggie platter and my husband got the ribeye. Both dishes were great (and had plenty to take home). I would love to give it another shot, but only if it's nice weather (looked like they had an awesome outdoor fireplace) or if we can be guaranteed seating inside."}, {"review_id": "BVkckdOJTypbt3XCkHG1Cg", "user_id": "hdVFsX40fUCM6mNvncjWSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "In Wichita this place rocks! I started the ball rolling with an excellent Shrimp cocktail which they made a special sauce which is ok, but I am old school and enjoy the traditional cocktail sauce which they were glad to provide for me. I had the rotisserie chicken and ribs combo. The chicken was well seasoned and very moist and delicious. The ribs were St. Louis style and very lean and also delicious. I also enjoyed the glazed sweet carrots and shoe string fries. These folks have a winning formula and all for a reasonable price. A must if you are in the area and even worth the drive.

I ordered the Rotisserie Chicken with mash potatoes and mushroom. Their mushrooms were so delicious! On a more recent visit I came with a group of 15 for a birthday dinner on a Saturday night. We all know weekends are busy, but this was the month of proms and graduations. Tables with large groups chatted loudly and the wait staff were grinding their gears to tend to their guests. It took over 1.5 to get our food. They brought our table 3 small skillets of corn bread to hold us over. By then every one had that hangry look. I ordered the Ciabatta Sandwich with fries. The sandwich was okay. When I read the description it sounded good. But when I came it wasn't what I was expecting. The bread seemed to be soggy. The peppers were cooked well, however the onions could have used more sautéing. The sandwich was clumsily stacked. The fries were okay as well. They didn't stay hot since they were shoestring fries.I think I'll stick to their known dishes. I do like that they take reservations, especially since it was a busy time of the year.
