The place was busy but not very noisy. I was promptly seated and taken care of by the Wait Staff.  Being from the east coast it was nice to see some fresh fish in the fish market side of this restaurant. The price on the market side was a little high but I guess that is normal if you expect to get fresh fish from the ocean in Indiana.So back to the cooked side....I ordered the almond crusted walleye and let me tell you it lived up to the hype.  The portion. Was generous and it was cooked to perfection.   The flavor was mild and exactly what you would expect from fresh Canadian walleye.I got the romaine heart wedge and a side.  I thought that it would be ok but this was different. They must have had some magic pixie dust in the back that they sprinkled on.  The tomatoes were awesome and let me tell you that I normally push these away... in this case I was flipping over the lettuce to find more. They balance well with the bacon and what had to be homemade blue cheese dressing.I will be back to this place next time I am in town... Don't let this one pass you up..."}, {"review_id": "GEIdkggFl6cKFU3hZ9YFtQ", "user_id": "h74nw9-LG5PvL5SCvZcS5A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/20/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Paula's is normally one of our favorite places to eat.  However, went there last Saturday and it was really not very good.  Three of us ordered the combo, which is normally a go to great meal.  Potatoes came out cold, had to send them back.  The meat (Walleye, crab cakes and  coconut shrimp instead of the scallops) were not hot.  The Walleye was barely warm..tending to cool, the crab cakes were burned on the outside and cool inside.  Coconut shrimp were ok, but not hot.The highlight of the meal was the clam chowder, which was great as always.  Not sure what happened last week, but this was definitely not Paula's at its best."}, {"review_id": "DyY3ObItvnRMPuhPLuyJDw", "user_id": "zwwtbjHMrBUsxr9lViAhdA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "Hands down my favorite lunch and dinner spot.They've got a fantastic offering of FRESH seafood and for lunch their soups and salads are fantastic.My go-to lunch salad: buffalo shrimp salad"}, {"review_id": "HYmeN5eoZdtyDZC5Ih4U4g", "user_id": "cReM7--ZDdsjthYklrw4JA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "Sashimi was very fresh and some of the best I've had in a long time.

Met at suggestion of a colleague. Glad he did. Wow. First the bread is soft and pillowy with a rosemary flavor. I try not to eat white bread but couldn't resist. I ordered the clam chowder and it was very good. My salad sealed the 5 stars. Buffalo shrimp salad. 5 big tasty spicy shrimp over a bed of lettuce and ranch dressing with celery sticks. It was amazing and I thought about it all day. Can't wait to go back. Service was great. Seafood counter looked great and very reasonably priced. I hate I had no storage to take something home.

Paula's has the reputation as the best (or one of the best) seafood places in town. As you walk in, a fresh seafood market is right there; just rows and rows of raw cuts of fish, and no fishy stink.  Paula's has not changed its menu much over the years, so keep an eye out on the specials for something new. I recently had Thai-inspired fish cakes that were spicy and delicious, with a bright-tasting, vinegary cucumber slaw.  The dish only needed a bit more of the sriracha-inspired sauce and slaw to round out the flavors.  Other classics: almond-crusted walleye, blackened salmon w. blue cheese topping, and the famous crab cakes. You get a warm basket of bread and butter before each meal; don't go overboard, as you'll want to save room for the fantastic seafood offerings.Service is professional and generally knowledgeable, and there is a large upstairs space for special events.  Paula's also has a selection of old school martinis and cocktails, so you feel a bit Mad Men-ish downing your gin martini and surf n' turf against the classy, brick-walled atmosphere and wooden bar. Fish, fish, fish, fishy oh!"}, {"review_id": "1FTa5n0RdGHcgfsS80C7Og", "user_id": "IWHzrRbq3yKwK3L0r-FxZg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Went to Paula's last weekend on a double date and had a wonderful time!

You won't find fresher fish anywhere else in Fort Wayne! We came here for my birthday dinner. Started with appetizers of Tuna Sashimi, Buffalo Shrimp & 1/2 dozen oysters. I was the most surprised by how much I loved the Buffalo Shrimp, not my typical go to but easily my favorite appetizer of the evening! I ordered the sea bass for my entree because it's hands down the best fish on the menu, and because my fiancée ordered the almond crusted walleye (which would have been my second choice). Since it was my birthday, I got a complimentary piece of Key Lime Pie - it's uhhhhhMAZING!"}, {"review_id": "-qazvXLkwLKSXDLPlCnh_g", "user_id": "5atV5SRlf0XKmbOD-mROLg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/23/2017", "text": "We'd heard many good things about Paula's so we decided to give it a shot.  I love the location, which is situated near some older classy-looking homes.  The decor of the restaurant is nice and makes me think of seafood.  There is also a seafood market there where you can buy all kinds of yummy goodies.  We were seated near the bar, which was fine except they had MSN on the television.  I really wish businesses would turn their televisions away from news channels.  Put it on something less depressing.  Anyhow, our waitress was really nice and had our drink orders in no time.  The first thing I want to mention is the bread and butter they put on the table.  The butter was amazing.  I am not sure what they do to it, but it was the best butter I think i've ever had.  For an appetizer I ordered one of the crab cakes since they are known for them.  It was absolutely amazing, especially with the jalapeno tartar sauce.  It was a tad pricey for just 1 crab cake, but worth it.  I also had a cup of the clam chowder and loved it as well.  It was delectable.  For my main meal I ordered the fish and chips.  Absolutely delicious.  No complaints whatsoever.  Originally, I was going to give this place 3 stars instead of 4.  \"But why, Fred?  You have basically praised this place up and down, bro.\"  The reason is because of my wife's meal.  She ordered a steak (she isn't a huge fan of seafood).  And before anyone says, \"Well, don't order a steak at a seafood place.\"  I'll head them off at the pass by saying, don't put something on the menu if you don't intend to cook it as best as you can.  This is not what I think Paula's intended, i'm sure it was just an off night for whoever cooked it, but it was not cooked medium at all.  In fact it \"moo'd\" when they sat the plate down (obvious exaggeration).  She asked to get it fired again to cook it more and it took a while.  In fact, I was practically done with my meal by the time the steak came back, and we just had it wrapped to go.  My food was so good that I had to give it 4 stars despite \"Steakgate\".  I highly recommend this place.  The food was superb, services was good, and the restaurant is beautiful.  Do it!"}, {"review_id": "3XIigrBtiSS6vPPQXg8E7A", "user_id": "_-rkV3c0PpJcRXad6KSnPA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/25/2016", "text": "If you like seafood, you should not miss this place.  I have been several times for lunch and have not been disappointed.  Go with the clam chowder instead of starter salad if you want a hearty bowl of goodness to warm you up on those cold Midwest days.  The walleye is my go-to dish and I have had good luck with the daily special as well.  Service is not always fast, but always friendly, and this is not a meal you want to rush through anyway.  I think people are surprised by the prices because of the rustic decor so don't let that throw you off, this is a higher end place.  Lunch is a great time to sample the menu if you don't want to pay dinner rates.  Cons: If you can't stand seafood, you should not come here.  This is not a \"they have other things on the menu\" kind of restaurant."}, {"review_id": "8Rh1uxGMyXq4Vr9Naw0VHQ", "user_id": "REwJCVSP631SHCWGn9VK6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/12/2016", "text": "My wife took me to Paula's for my birthday this year.

I wish we wouldn't have waited so long, as we had a very positive experience.I made reservations for four people on the phone, and even though we arrived 15 minutes early, we were seated right away. Which was surprising, considering they were absolutely packed. That being said - the place is very noisy. Do not come here expecting to have a romantic, intimate experience. The place immediately smells like fish when you walk in - but in a good way. The seafood offerings from their market are proudly displayed, and you can definitely smell them when you first walk in. I loved that there were different seating options - a dining room, two bar areas, an upstairs, a back room with a piano (no one was playing when we were there). The interior design and decor gives off an upscale, divey feel if that makes sense? I think it's indicative of Fort Wayne at its best - it's classy without being pompous. But, the most important part - the food! The complimentary bread is delicious. Warm, fresh baked-taking, silky butter. Perfect. The appetizers we ordered - the calamari and the buffalo shrimp - were very good. I've definitely had better calamari, but the four of us found ourselves fighting over the buffalo shrimp. Two of my dining companions ordered the walleye, my husband ordered the combo platter, and I ordered the Greek shrimp scampi. We all ordered salads and a side. My caesar salad was delicious! Everyone in Fort Wayne raves about the Casa Caesar salad, but I've never been impressed with it. Paula's Caesar, however, is crunchy, fresh, and they'll add anchovies if you request it! All of the seafood we ate was superb - the Midwest isn't exactly a \"hotspot\" for fresh seafood, but the portions were perfect, the seafood tasted fresh, not frozen, and all of the seasonings and entree components paired nicely without overpowering the fish. The only disappointing aspect of my dish was the side - I ordered the cauliflower and it was bland, and missing the olives that were supposed to come with it.Our waitress was very nice and accommodating. Two of our dining companions do not speak English as a first language, and the server was very patient and asked questions, wasn't patronizing at all. She did, however, start clearing the table while two of us were still finishing our entree, which I thought was a little odd and felt like she was trying to rush us. To sum it all up - food is superb, martinis are excellent, atmosphere is fun! We'll definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "WHDyl8Gg6rRTDBOVp0WBkg", "user_id": "FdONGnWmp0t0rmohZZwiWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/24/2017", "text": "Here with a group of coworkers and we all thought out meal was spectacular.  I had the soft shell crab special and it was very nice.  I would have preferred breaded and fried opposed to pan fried (it was served exactly as described- although abit on the oily side) but it was delicious.  The salads were great. The service was on point.  The beer selection was very good.  Walking in you can tell this is clearly a seafood restaurant as well as selling seafood uncooked, retail to the public.  Often when you walk into a seafood shop, you get hit in the face with a seafood smell, which isn't always appealing.  None of that here.  The fish was fresh, well prepared with friendly competent service.  You can tell this is a place that caters to the locals (I love that).  Pleasantly surprised in Ft Wayne.  Absolutely go here."}, {"review_id": "U4l74CEGHiP3yp48ijR1kg", "user_id": "DDt67ulRHr3cCRD9MdgCEw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/31/2015", "text": "First time here and this place was so amazing!!

Definitely recommend getting the wedge salad! The price isn't too expensive. It is the right price for the amount you're getting.The service was great!

They have a decent wine list and they don't charge ridiculous prices for bottles which is refreshing. The waitress suggested a red blend called Troublemaker and it was delicious. For an appetizer, we had the calamari. It was fried just right, not overdone and the meat was so tender. I got the crabcakes with the vegetable special which was a cauliflower au gratin. The crabcakes are amazing because they are pure meat with some bell peppers. It's not a bunch of dough with a little crab. They were so delicious and perfectly seared. Their specials also looked really good.
