However there are a few exceptions to the rule, and this is one of those times. Came here today for the Waffle Throwdown - West vs East. The event piqued my interest when a co-worker mentioned it, and being a NJ native with the mindset of a left-coaster, couldn't resist. Who doesn't love a good waffle? But these are no ordinary waffles. Along with some mouth-watering bites, I also received an education on what it really means to be a traditional Belgian waffle. From the flour, butter and sugar pearls combo, to the yeasty doughy mixture that's pressed into hot irons and comes out in irregular shapes of caramelized shells with a flakey yet chewy texture inside... every bite is just delightful.Waffle Me Up has some menu items that are always available, but today was all about the specials du jour. Two selections represented the East and two the West; each had a sweet and savory option. For $12, you got one of each, which I think was bargain for the quality. My friend and I split it, which left us out $6 (put tip) and with very full tummies. In the savory corners were a Chicken & Waffles mashup with hollandaise sauce and crispy potatoes on top, and a Chorizo with a mildly spicy crema and cheese crumbles. It really was a toss up, both were different but equally delish. The chicken was moist and paired well with the fruit syrup, and the chorizo was more unique and a very pleasant surprise. Glad we started with those, because the sweet ones were decadent. First, the S'mores with a nutella spread covered by a marshmallow-y spread and cinnamon toast crunch crumbles. Second, the Coffee treat with coffee flavored whipped cream and a chocolate-coffee flavored drizzle. The S'mores won that competition, but I'm also biased since I'm not typically a huge coffee fan.As for the vibe: it shares space with Boise Fry Co with communal seating, so don't be afraid to pull up a chair and meet your neighbors. The owner Hector was so incredibly friendly, cheerful and clearly happy to be serving his creations. We also had the opportunity to chat with the East rep Shane, who's actually an ID native, about his story. WMU strives to source all ingredients locally, which I 100% support. And the made-from-scratch means it's served warm and fresh. Go with a big appetite, you won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "PPxH6HjMHZvhjvepVea1aQ", "user_id": "MVSpZumy974f0-quznvAmg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "Good waffle, good drink and nice atmosphere! I've been meaning to give this place a try and I am glad I did. I love their waffles! They are made from scratch and they use the real Belgian sugar pearls that make their waffles crunchy, sweet and kind of chewy inside!

They're a lot denser than your average waffle, so one waffle filled me up pretty good. Paying $6+ for one waffle seems a little pricey, though.There are lots of toppings to choose from for your waffle, and you can decide whether to go sweet or savory.  I'm more of a sweet waffle person, but the savory waffles (especially the Bob Deluxe) looked tasty too.  My waffle with cookie butter and strawberries was yummy, the employees were very friendly and service was quick."}, {"review_id": "Qri1tS9XWpoQejYwU8pTPw", "user_id": "-ieZ5_dYRUyDNnkmjEgNUA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "I'm glad I finally was able to try this place out! It was very tasty and I liked that they had both savory and sweet waffles. However, I didn't love that the waffles had a sweetness to them even when paired with savory ingredients.

I was SO impressed with the service, the smiles, the absolutely delicious BOB, I skipped the egg and added avocado instead. Yummy!!

I highly recommend this spot and will definitely be back!!"}, {"review_id": "s3VhwESU45dnVLXE65RUAg", "user_id": "PUQFBO57wiRZRnUOpaiSXw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2017", "text": "After wanting to try this place for weeks....no, take that back- MONTHS, I finally made it here on a Saturday morning. And I left wondering where this place has been my whole life. First off, it's all about the waffles and who doesn't love a good waffle!? Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Whatever your jam, this place has a waffle option for everyone and everything.As soon as we walked in we were warmly greeted by the owners. They walked us through the menu and how they make their waffles- pearl sugar imported from Belgium and the yeast dough. Oh my. The menu itself is pretty straightforward and simple which I appreciate because trust me, of there 20+ options to choose from I'd be standing there for days trying to carve a way past my indecisiveness. While the savory option of the BOB sounds intriguing and different, I figured these folks knew what they were doing so when it came to it I went all the way and ordered the BOBacado Deluxe. Yup. My better half ordered the same. We both loved it but would order it with two eggs next time because part of the magic is the yolk. And simply because we couldn't overcome our need for a little sweetness, we ordered the Strawberry Me to try as well. A decadent treat but oh so delicious. Each waffle is plated with such care and the ingredients are of great quality.  To sum it all up: Prepare to be wowed by waffles. Can't wait to come back."}, {"review_id": "vPzKfvkF993B6saKmAvaWg", "user_id": "27ocFgaTnAMJwTgcVWkaKA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/7/2017", "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to BOB, a savory waffle topped with bacon, organic syrup, and basil all with a lovely side of strawberries for just $6.00.

It's a dessert option so you are presented with different sweet options. I enjoyed the the basic powdered sugar waffle with strawberry's. My personal waffle was a tad under cooked, but the rest of the group had good waffles. Mine was probably a fluke. There isn't a huge desire to return anytime soon.

A true Central Washington personality & warmth. I was disappointed that they didn't have Chicken and Waffles, the portions were small and over priced, they didn't have a changing station in the bathroom for families and the ventilation was bad so you kinda felt Smokey and greasy when you walk out. $11 for a waffle, 1 slice of cheap cheese, 1 egg, 1 slice of bacon and 1/4 of an avocado? I will try them again but I will give them a little more time to dial in the Experience. They were decent waffles and very pretty to look at though."}, {"review_id": "lwdltXqvMGikkal9LcrUww", "user_id": "38c35gSdBDuX0yDAOvc9tQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Very kool place.

The batter isn't supposed to be runny like it is at the Holiday Inn up the street.  Appreciate what you're getting here cuz it's pretty good. Lastly, take advantage of the square program when you're paying (I realize that might not make sense, just ask when you're paying). Couple visits and you'll wind up with a free waffle on your hands!
