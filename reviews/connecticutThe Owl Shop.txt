It's a very diverse, relaxing, and old-school escape for a cigar and an old-fashioned. They are very friendly, have a solid cigar selection, have an outstanding bourbon selection, and have a great mix of seats, tables, couches, etc. They also have some snacks, which I have yet to try. The drinks are a bit on the expensive side. Everyone is very friendly and you can stay as long as you'd like. It's obvious why this place has been around forever."}, {"review_id": "iwwjy54GIz3He5RYxjuSuw", "user_id": "rrpxEzNvUxKGK1XleOM9vA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "i love this place. from the jazz music to drinks and cigars. the cigar selection is huge and prices are standard. the drinks are pretty normal in price nothing over the top. great whiskey and bourbon selection. i havent been able to make a live music night yet but i am looking forward to going to one in the near future. the inside isnt overly smokey but keep in mind if your not into cigars or the smell this place is not for you. the back has couches, making it extremely comfortable for you to sink in while smoking and sipping on a beer. i was surprised when i came in the first time because i didnt know what to expect. There is also a small coffee cafe on the inside where you can grab your cappuccinos, hot chocolate, desserts etc. there are also a few food options on the menu. nice place to come and relax, take the edge off."}, {"review_id": "tsCew3vM8QpaQfFMrDWttw", "user_id": "1TFnKi8tL1mygXHGv2zvwg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Just fine. I had high hopes after reading the reviews but this place is only ok. Service has been poor. I'd love a second beer but I can't get anyone's attention. I should mention that they aren't busy. Amazing selection of bourbon and scotch. Cigar selection is decent but I asked one of the guys if they carried Southern Draw and I don't think he knew who that was but he gave me an attitude that it must be a cheap smoke. I probably won't come back."}, {"review_id": "jM0qkeqb3XbuV-rMqZ7xOw", "user_id": "tSO7q1cQyd2C5OXq7UsaSA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "This is one of the truly unique places to visit in New Haven.

Hell if I know....but they helped!Live jazz every Wednesday was often and not too loud.  You can have a decent conversation amidst some pretty great music. There were people everywhere but it didn't seem too packed....but very much packed for 10pm on a Wednesday. But here's the thing, I'm all about a hipster. They don't bother me...but this place... this place is an old man's bar. I refined, mature space that's been here for forever.  You can tell by the regulars who are milling about.... but the hipsters... they came in droves. They huddled around the main entrance in beanies ....totally unaware of what was around them.  Hell, one kid was at the bar...with a laptop...and ear buds in...EAR BUDS..it's Live Jazz!! Just an odd group.Lastly, if you cannot handle smoke, it should be obvious that this place isn't for you. I don't think I would make it a usual spot even though I really do love it.  I came home and had to wash my hair four times and had the raspiest voice the next day and I didn't even smoke a cigar! So keep that in mind....otherwise, you're really going to like it."}, {"review_id": "QSr0Bv-ndraTwh2g6OQgsA", "user_id": "XVDESj60VXYioZw0WEFNSw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/19/2017", "text": "Not crowded = amazing chill smoking barCrowed = the worst place to be after a night of/while drinking"}, {"review_id": "004z8A3eAEjMzbgFLNdDKQ", "user_id": "rpzEGZJfcyY8k2sb5nNgrA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "I'd like to give this place 5 stars but, they charged me $10 for 2 tiny glasses of water after ordering $100 for drinks and $250 for cigars.

There were two workers behind the bar, serving the handful of other customers while my friend and I stood waiting...and waiting...and waiting. It's like we were absolutely invisible. Not a single hello. All eye contact strictly avoided. They even served the older man that came in after us. I've never been refused service like this, so this was definitely sort of a traumatic low blow. I left after 10 mins of awkward silence and watching the barkeep pointedly turn away from us. It's safe to say I will not be coming back, nor will I be recommending this place. Can't two young women just get a decent cigar and a whiskey in peace??

There are few craft options on tap as well as some nice bottles and cans. The focus of owl shop is on cigars. They have a huge inventory of cigars.

The location in downtown New Haven is the perfect home to this establishment. The waitstaff is always ready to offer a suggestion for cigar/drink pairings and are always courteous. The decor is dark and woody and what you would imagine a modern-day Ron Burgundy would want as his set up. I don't know my types of wood, but I'm pretty certain it's not mahogany. I'm gonna go with oak, but that doesn't matter...it's rich and it has many leather chairs/couches.This place can fill up quickly and seating can be tight. There's nothing worse than having to stand in a corner to smoke your cigar.
