I had the sausage. Don't forget to ask for gravy on the side. They're not too clear on what exactly your getting. Basically we got a sandwich that would have been dry otherwise if we hadn't asked about gravy. The apple butter was really good. You can use it on a side biscuit. Or just add it to your sandwich as well.The ambience is casual semi-hipster. But overall it's got a family friendly vibe as well. I'd definitely come back.

If I revisited Portland and only had the opportunity to go to one place for breakfast/brunch, I would come here again. First of all, I'm a huge lover of biscuits - even just simple buttered ones - and these are perfection. Soft and flaky with just the right amount of crispiness on the outside. I recommend getting at least one plain biscuit just to appreciate on its own. The apple butter is a must - it's so good I briefly considered eating the rest with a spoon.The Reggie is the perfect biscuit sandwich. Everything was outstanding, from the chicken to the cheese to the bacon to the gravy. I savored every bite and longed for more when it was gone, even though they provide a hefty portion.There's a Salt & Straw right down the road, so make sure to check that out if you haven't already!"}, {"review_id": "_snrP7jiyjO4ABj7T0KOfw", "user_id": "IqPUywVLyNow5YfDLdSimA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "This place is a definite must!!!!

You know the place is local favorite and a must eat place in Portland, when people already start lining up at the restaurant right before they about to open. The line goes by fairly fast, we just line up to order what we want, and go inside to find empty seats. There's limited seating inside, but there are a plenty of seats outdoor. Self-serve water, utensils and napkins on the side. We order a small fries with gravy sauce, Reggie Deluxe and Reggina. You won't regret ordering anything from there, because everything they serve, they are mouth-watering. We especially LOVE their Reggie Deluxe with their crispy fried chicken (inside still tastes juicy), egg and bacon with gravy sauce pouring all over, and then stuffed in between 2 freshly baked biscuits. Every bite is a heaven to me, very satisfying and addicting and couldn't stop eating one bite after another. Their gravy sauce with fries are so BOMB, basically anything you eat with their gravy sauce, you will slowly clean up the whole plate of foods. I can't wait to go back there and just to stop by to eat their FRIED CHICKEN BISCUITS once again! Such a game changer, and you will be mind-blown by how tasty these are."}, {"review_id": "zxBYXj03CZzNEdDR1qk4Uw", "user_id": "ZLnmZ9eQiobM-PQ76Y2Riw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "I love biscuits. I don't eat them too often because they aren't all that great for you but I was on vacation and needed to eat the biscuits from Pine State at least once. The restaurant is pretty small so you're going to be fighting for a seat but thankfully people eat pretty quick. You order up at the front, take your number, find a seat and wait for your food. Their menu is pretty straightforward but I wish there were more varieties when it came to protein because most of their sandwiches had fried chicken. The McIsley (Fried chicken with pickles, mustard & Bee Local honey): This was probably my favorite fried chicken sandwich out of the two we ordered. A little bit of honey goes a long way and it complimented the chicken and biscuits perfectly. This sandwich actually didn't come with any gravy but it didn't really need any. The Moneyball (Biscuit and gravy topped with an over easy egg): This dish was delicious! It didn't come with any protein but it was completely unnecessary because of the sausage gravy and egg. It was so rich and decadent. I could only consume about 50% of it mainly because I felt insanely guilty eating just biscuits and gravy but it was totally worth the calories. The biscuits are insanely delicious and I've never had gravy so flavorful in my life. The Reggie (Fried chicken, bacon & cheese topped with gravy): My husband really liked this sandwich because of the added bacon and gravy. It was great and super filling! Make sure to eat this with a fork because it will fall apart completely on you but well worth the mess!We enjoyed everything from Pine State Biscuits. The only thing that we didn't like was that the gravy was served lukewarm. It got cold very quickly and the gravy would have tasted even better hot. The biscuits are flaky and buttery and perfect. Definitely make a visit when you're in Portland! 4/5"}, {"review_id": "Znl8MPYbyEvMUMFjbwBeQg", "user_id": "b2oBjQsR-UV-_lE_LTkMmw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "I've heard this place can be quite the wait with long lines... well, come on a Monday at 11am and you're good to go!

I got the Reggie Deluxe which is highly recommended and now I know why! The buttery biscuit with the fried chicken, cheese, bacon, egg, and gravy?! It was to die for!!! I also shared the Steak Hash ups which was just as amazing! It was hash browns topped with steak, onions, cheese, and mushrooms. It was basically all my favorite things and I definitely recommend it!

The Chatfield looked interesting, so that's what I had ordered. It was a biscuit breakfast sandwich was had fried chicken, bacon, and cheese topped off with apple butter. This had to be the perfect concoction for a breakfast sandwich and who ever had thought of it was a genius. Let's have a play by play as you bite into this succulent morsel. The first thing your teeth sink into is the biscuit. It's soft, warm, and you know for a fact that it just came as a fresh batch out the oven. Next, the apple butter is so sweet, yet meshes really well with the biscuit. The texture is so satisfying as your teeth sinks further into the already melted thick cheese that your mouth just salivates with satisfaction. And the bacon is so crisp that even though there's a busy line of people still waiting outside, they took the time required to make sure that the bacon is cooked to perfection. And finally, the fried chicken. Juicy to the core and crispy to the touch. And when you combine all that, you create a consumer who definitely wants to come back to try out the other breakfast sandwiches. Thank you for the wonderful experience."}, {"review_id": "-HQwH77zn3v83XbwXm-EtQ", "user_id": "nGKTdJGXXwuThFlMMqyk4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "Hearing so many reviews from friends and reading on YELP it was our first stop straight from PDX Airport using a rideshare that total us about $19.

I don't care, but I could go for seconds. Tbh, one order is pretty skimp. Do opt for another order or side dish to be completely satiated. My eye on The Moneyball, which consisted of two biscuits with an egg on top smothered with their delicious mushroom gravy. The biscuits are great by itself, but the gravy just sealed the deal. Although mushroom based, it was extremely creamy and cheesy that you wished you could have a bowl of it. And of course, the runny egg was GG.
