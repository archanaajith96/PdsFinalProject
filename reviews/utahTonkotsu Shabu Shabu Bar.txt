Moving here from California, it's been hard to find a decent shabu place... it's non existent really. To my surprise, this new place nailed it! They have a variety of broths (Tonkatsu is the bomb!), a great selection of meats, and give you lots of fresh veggies. The sauces are great... the sesame sauce is like shabu crack if I've ever had it.If you like a kick to the mouth, make sure you ask for the spicy drops or spice paste for the broth. Ramen is next door as well (same restaurant) which I want to try next, but shabu has me so damn hooked!"}, {"review_id": "0huY_EXzvZ7m5P6EyG6J1Q", "user_id": "vPkFuYJZqchT9Kyt8RJfVg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "I went here a while ago with my mom and we had no idea what we were in for. Luckily, it wasn't super busy when we went and the guy working behind the bar (the owners brother) was so friendly and accommodating and taught us everything we needed to know. If you are a first timer to shabu shabu try and go when they aren't super crowded and sit at the bar, not at a booth. The one thing we weren't told is that we could have shared a hot pot, which we definitely would have done. The best way I can describe this to a newbie is- glorified fondue. So if you don't like fondue, this might not be your jam. The meat was sliced right in front of us and then was put into a beautiful design and flash frozen. So if you can't handle uncooked meat, this isn't the place for you either. If you like to take your time eating, are interested in the conversational aspects that a great meal can bring, and are feeling a little over the ramen trend but still love the flavor- this is a must try! I'm going back tonight!"}, {"review_id": "XZJpAqQylTqhuIlW8n3AYg", "user_id": "6RVyYnj9saqTv1J-wwGoCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Today was my first time at this place, and I can easily say it is already one of my favorites. I tried the Tonkotsu broth with wagyu and it was delicious. I ate every single grain of rice, every oz of meat, and vegetables. The dipping sauces are essential honestly. My favorite is the ponzu but that's just me. Anyway.. the aesthetics and vibe of the two restaurants (ramen bar also) is super chill and I could see myself hanging out there with a bunch of friends and family. Next time you visit the city, or if you're hungry, definitely come check this place out! Can't go wrong."}, {"review_id": "3crRKmWmqt8_2HF2mXffUw", "user_id": "6AkJNVcCoA19wQNKoTQZnw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "It was like I never left OC!! ... turns out I heard the owner is from OC! The irony of it. This place has great staff, and the food is delicious. I really really enjoyed the Tonkotsu ramen. Just keep in mind that someone has to order shabu at your table in order for someone to order ramen. They also have great side dishes, you must try the braised buns!!"}, {"review_id": "1JTeD9Qp7ua5IsrZ4siweg", "user_id": "_Pns_rW4-I2M-ayCW4g5Aw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "Shabu Shabu how I love thee! You know there aren't nearly as many hot pot style places in Utah as I'd like there to be. It's just a fabulous concept. So this restaurant is split in half. Half is regular dining. Half is the shabu area. The booths seat 4 but there is a bar as well for solo diners. Ordering is easy if you follow the steps: Choose your Meat (wagyu and USDA Prime are the best!), then your broth (we chose dashi and sukiyaki), and then select your rice. DONE!Just know that this area is VERY busy so you might have to get real good at flagging your waitress down to control the heat for you and show you the ropes. It's a fun experience because its a multitasking meal that is oh-so rewarding!!The regular portions of meat are satisfying but the large will leave you comfortably stuffed. Remember to slurp very loudly!!"}, {"review_id": "igqPpaYOPuEeJ0mrk0vIkA", "user_id": "xzFwCeHtPczly7G8BRx9Qg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/4/2017", "text": "I've been on such a hot pot kick lately. So much so that I Yelp research my work travel locations specifically for hot pot. And spicy hot pot? YES!Tonkotsu has a number of broth choices, but none are spicy. They will bring out spice paste so you can doctor your broth choice.  I've tried a number of the broths and don't have a stand out favorite - they're all good. Dipping sauce options will depend on your broth. Ask your waiter for their input.Next up, choose your meat(s). Their pork belly and beef belly are my favorites - the fat just melts in the pot. Two sizes of protein, with negligible cost difference. Go smallest size and add a different meat side.Each order comes with an individual bowl of veggies. This is a bonus because many places charge you for individual veggies, like broccoli or bamboo hearts, and you have a big plate of that single veg. You'll also get a bowl of rice.Clean interior. Roomy booths. Personable staff. Shared parking lot with the rest of the strip mall (including their ramen place next door).Overall, very good hot pot. Not my favorite - when they add a spicy broth with Szechuan peppercorns, then we can talk!"}, {"review_id": "1GMgkYuggel9bomH5T_O7w", "user_id": "dGT0g7kHt9IzryiITiP2Pw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "Shabu shabu here is pretty good; I definitely recommend getting the tonkatsu broth because I regret NOT ordering that one. I just got the kombu broth, and I guess I should have expected it but it was a little bit too bland for me. Needless to say, I snuck many sips of my husband's soup.If you like spicy, ask for the special drops to put in your dipping sauce. I'm actually mainly leaving this review for service because a really obnoxious man sat next to my husband and I at the bar and was irritatingly chatty. He kept complaining about things that really weren't in the staff's control and they handled him wonderfully and were very kind to him throughout the whole meal. I really wanted to turn to him at some point and tell him to shut up, but I didn't want to cause a scene. So good job, staff. Your patience and kindness were duly noted!"}, {"review_id": "neYEtn0dQt79vq9sqpZVqg", "user_id": "9Vmqj86WQ6WTU8SdSkfBCA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "This must be the worst hotpot place I have ever been to.  Their prime ribeye looks like what you get as not even choice cut at a supermarket.  The Tonkotsu broth was salty beyond belief.  Their udon has 4 skinny strands.  Their mushroom was a tiny sprig.  They must use the cheapest ingredient imaginable at this place.

Tonkotsu has implemented great designs in their complex and provides an atmosphere that would quell the hearts of most hipsters. It's not hard to miss on the street either!But-- you're here to talk about food! So-- the shabu shabu section of Tonkotsu is the one I'm talking about. Japanese hotpot is hard to get wrong, but they do it well! Everything is clean, and they provide a wonderful selection of vegetables and meats. They also have an option for spicy oil!The staff is also very friendly! They make it very casual and are usually very helpful when you have no idea what hotpot even is. This is a good place to start if you want to understand Japanese food and to try different soups and meats.I'll definitely come back!"}, {"review_id": "MtWKE3RzcgnmHPU5gBpKjA", "user_id": "OITwLIXX7wTIpRMO0CZFPA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "You know that emoji that has hearts shooting out it's eyes? Well that what I had happening when I left Tonkotsu with the love of my life Feb 13, 2018. My girl and I decided to celebrate Valentine's a day early to beat crowds and also wanted to try something new. Tonkotsu was our pick and boy did we pick right. First we messaged them on Facebook and they were more then helpful and polite. We also were able to make reservations as well. When we got to Tonkotsu the atmosphere was relaxed and fancy, but not crazy expensive. The waitress we had was amazing and very polite. Being that it was our first time she was so patient and also gave us some helpful tips. Not only was our waitress amazing but the guy who cuts the meat also took time to come out and say hi and asked how thing were going. That's like a chef coming out the kitchen and in my book that's caring and dedication to your job. Now let's talk about the food. The meat was sliced perfectly, uniform and a good amount. The veggies that came with the meat was epic. It wasn't really the run of the mill same boring veggies you get in other restaurants, but a delicious variety that had my mouth watering and some of the veggies were ones I've never tried before! That's the thing that makes it amazing! Now I have to admit that I was going for the Scallops, but unfortunately they were out. So I went ahead and got the Choice Ribeye and I just about fell in love. But, don't get me wrong the broth also played a part as the conductor in this Shabu Shabu symphony. The Sukiyaki was perfect. I loved how the set up made the broth boil, but then would stop every few seconds so that nothing would burn. With your meal you also get 2 dipping sauces, along with diced radish, scallions and garlic. They also provide a hot oil that they use a dropper for and to keep from ruining your meal, they are the only ones adding the drops. Oh, oh I forgot one thing that also makes this place amazing and that is, you can order sushi from their other restaurant that is connected next door and they will bring it from there straight to your table. I know right, amazing!!! If it was up to me I would give Tonkotsu 10 stars for customer service and atmosphere. Then I would add 10 more for food and the smile they put on your face when you leave. GO TO TONKOTSU! GO TO TONKOTSU! GO TO TONKOTSU!"}, {"review_id": "VUONrqS6dVpoydgQ58hy1A", "user_id": "4HKIxvXI7_5vK26EMn27jQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/12/2017", "text": "I would totally give 5 stars to the experience I had at Tonkotsu shabu shabu bar.I went there to celebrate a friend's birthday  and the shop owner happily helped me put the cake in the fridge.

Such a delightful gem within west valley. It's a different hotpot compared to others that I've been too but different is fine with me. The broths are more creamier than other locations. The meat is fresh and sliced at the bar in front of you. The veggies are cute and delicious. They also have a unique spicy sauce to add to your dipping ones. But be careful it is definitely strong!If you want some comfort hotpot this is the place to come to. Roughly $16 per hotpot but every time I go I just share the broth and add extra meat for a couple more bucks!

This is a small place with I would say 4-5 tables and a bar area. We sat at the bar area and a quick warning: if you're on the shorter side I would recommend sitting at the table - my friend could hardly reach the pot. She had to stretch to reach her pot. To order here - you chose your meat, then your broth and you chose white or brown rice. Each order comes with veggie and noodles. I totally recommend the tonkotsu broth and also the ribeye usda prime. The pork shoulder is also very delicious. All meat is thinly sliced. The veggies they provide gives the broth a really sweeter taste. There are two different kind of dipping sauce. One is a sesame (this is for the veggies - you also get fresh sesame to crush) and the other one is ponzu (this is for meat - a citrus like soy sauce). Also if you do like spicy food I do recommend asking the waitress for their spice drops. One drop is very spicy - I got two and there was a good kick for me already. One thing about this place that I don't feel like is a 5 star for me is that the quantity they give. It says it is a certain oz, but I don't think it is that amount. It is a great experience, but if you can really eat a lot you might not be full.

The meat was of great quality and the broth and the dipping sauces were delicious. Unfortunately, the service needs work. It took almost a half hour for the broth and meats to come to the table. When the broth is already made and the meats are uncooked, there's no reason why it should be so slow coming to the table. They forgot our rice but because so much time went by before they came by to check on us, it again took a while to get it. The bowls and plates that were used WERE ALL CHIPPED BADLY. Not a single plate or bowl we used were in good condition. Some were slightly chipped and some were deep holes. To be fair, the servers were friendly. And again, the food was good.
