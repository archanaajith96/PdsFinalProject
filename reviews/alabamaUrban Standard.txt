I live for the almond milk mocha and THANK YOU for the artwork!!!  It really makes my day.  My family gets the caramel latte and/or lattes and EVER time the milk is perfect!  I can tell you that my kids LOVE the grilled cheese!!  It has so many cheeses and flavors!  Amazing!!!Thanks for the awesome service, atmosphere and superb coffee and food!  See you in 2 days!!!"}, {"review_id": "yRfU1GVv5b8g7PysfUvfFQ", "user_id": "9iCwwnE_yEWZm46w2VUtyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "I went here about a year and a half ago and had the chicken panino which was the best sandwich I've ever had. I couldn't believe how flavorful it was. I also had almond tea and that was really good, too. So I was looking forward to go back since I was in Birmingham for a concert. Unfortunately, we didn't know beforehand that they stop serving food at 4 PM and we got there at 4:26. So we got some pastries (a blueberry something rather donut and a rosemary chocolate chip scone). I think the lady at the counter sensed our disappointment about the fact that they weren't serving food and so she gave us an extra donut for free, which was rather nice. The donuts were delicious (my sister had the extra), and my sister said the scone was tasty as well. So I'd definitely recommend this place whether you want lunch or some tasty desserts."}, {"review_id": "W5pNHk5uuLU2mwLt10Gojg", "user_id": "Bdg1LjR2t0kHsScDuNeU_w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "I'm actually kind of shocked at how high the reviews for this place was. The ambience is a 5/5, it has that hipster feel and it's super spacious inside. I ordered a drip coffee and the granola with yogurt. The coffee was a nice roast, which I enjoyed. The yogurt/granola on the other hand...I almost laughed out loud when she brought it out. At $5 and eating it in, I was expecting a little more than what could've been nothing more than two dollops of yogurt with a side of granola brought out in a sample size plastic cup (like the ones they give as samples at Costco\".."}, {"review_id": "ZSTkkRB6JQ_PAauHWzzU4w", "user_id": "u7f0FYgEBko6BVJzCrFfdg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "First experience in Urban Standard and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The coffee was great and had a very bold flavor. Urban Standard is a great place to go and visit with friends or if you are looking to hang out and read a book or surf the internet. I did not try any of the food that they have, but it all looked very tasty. It was very clean inside and looked fresh from the fire restoration.

They have wonderful coffee, strong WiFi, and amazing food for breakfast and lunch. You pretty much don't have to leave once you sit down. It can get a little loud during heavy breakfast and lunch time, but I generally don't have a problem tuning it out. They're grilled cheese is made with a combination of different cheeses and is pretty wonderful.

I'm so happy I walked over to Urban Standard after searching Yelp for vegetarian options in the area. The restaurant is nice and welcoming with lots of old maps on the walls and interesting artwork. You place your order at the counter and go sit down with a number if you are staying, or in my case wait for take out. I sat in an old theater chair by the counter which was an cool touch.I ordered the veggie Rueben which was amazing. It comes on toasted bread with sauerkraut, beets as the \"meat\", dressing and cheese if you want. The beets were a great substitute to seitan which I've had on other veggie Ruebens. Flavors were spot on. The side I had was the balsamic pasta salad which was also very good.The service was great as well. While waiting a friendly server asked if there was anything I needed while I waited to pick up my food and even checked on it's status. Now that I know about this place, I'll certainly be back when I'm in Birmingham."}, {"review_id": "D5spA-30VlthcWhKcBB4Mw", "user_id": "hxGCCzrixrSC7Bz-WBcCVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Great coffee shop in Birmingham.

My veggie burger was a disappointment. Maybe My expectation was too high because of some of the yelp reviews on here, or maybe I just came on a bad day. Who knows. My bun was so burnt, it tasted bitter. The patty itself tasted like every other frozen veggie pattie you can get from the frozen section of the grocery store (gardein, morning star black bean patties, bocca veggie patties). I had the pasta salad side and that was so so as well, not impressed. I also got a blueberry scone because it looked so good in the display case. I felt like the scones would have been a lot better if it was warmed up or something, b/c that thing tasted hard and cold."}, {"review_id": "yk8zt3MJ_grdMjvQ-zuJBw", "user_id": "_WjBqVKV42kxkybi2-L00Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "Come here frequently for the coffee and the study space.

I actually came here 2 different times, and to be honest the service was not the greatest either time. If you are a coffee snob and look like a hipster, you'll fit right in. If you stick out in their atmosphere, the employees will talk down to you and seem very impatient. Not going out of my way to get here but if I am in the neighborhood, I would stop in for a drink. The decor is fantastic and it's a cool place to hang out with a coffee but its like many other coffee shops - so therefore, average.

I used to come here all the time before the fire, and just stopped back in today for the first time since they reopened. Things are up and running just as good or better than before. One thing that really stands out, is that the crew doesn't change. The employees have all for the most part been here for a long time. They remember your name, and in some cases exactly what you always order, (assuming that you're like me and frequently order the same thing).The menu is simple, well thought out, creative, and unequivocally delicious. No one I've been here with ever left unimpressed with their meal. The coffee is excellent, whether you want a latte with a fancy design on top, or an iced caramel latte, or whatever else you can come up with. They're in there every day grinding fresh beans from a company called counter culture. Great stuff, and you can take a bag of beans with you if you want to do your own espresso at home. The pastries are very good as well. The scones are more like crispy bread than like a piece of cake, and I think that's how they should be. The decor is artsy, the crowd is diverse, polite, and professional, and you never feel rushed in the event that you might be meeting a friend to discuss a book or spending time on the free WiFi getting some work done. I've spent a good bit of time here off and on, and I've been in enough times to say that they are also very consistent in what they do. I've never caught them on an off day. So, good menu options for everyone, vegetarians, meat eaters, those who just want a cupcake, etc. Coffee that's worth getting out of the car for. Great crew. Nice atmosphere. What else do they need to do?5 stars."}, {"review_id": "TEm23blKnQiwuwN_zqCCVg", "user_id": "CzyRAEEZMDBUfXldzaY8Qg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/26/2017", "text": "Wow.  That was one of the best lunches I've had in awhile.  Ordered the Reuben and vegan Chili but also got a side salad by mistake.  Deeeelicious.  Salad had grilled radishes and butternut squash cubes that were a welcome and tasty addition.

There aren't too many places downtown where you can just hang out, and I really which I had known about this place back when I was in school since I always see people studying here. The drinks however kinda fall short. I've tried their blueberry tea. It smelled wonderful, but was really just a hot cup of water at the end of the day so I pretty much know what to expect from their other teas. I've tried their white wine before too, and it was extremely strong. Just left me with a headache. Their menu options seem really tasty, but the only thing I've had was their strawberry cupcake. Delicious! They even give you forks to eat them with. Who eats a cupcake with a fork? This girl does.
