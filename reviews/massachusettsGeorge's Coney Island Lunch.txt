Parking was a little tight in the back since it was so busy. Who would have thought that it'd be so busy during a Thursday afternoon! One of my friends who is a Worcester local decided on this pseudo summer weather day for us to grab lunch at Coney Island. I mean summer and hotdogs just go together like peanut butter and jelly. I can't believe what I've been missing out on! I walked in, and it gives off a historical retro vibe. The wooden benches no matter where you look have names carved all over the place. You can mark and leave a little piece of history at this basically historical site. Food review:They offer multiple selections, the basic hamburger, cheeseburgers, ect but mainly known for their hotdogs. I ended up getting the works. Which is basically a hotdog with their famous secret chili recipe with onions and mustard. I got one hot dog, but I probably could have had 3! I think their secret chili definitely made it from an ordinary hot dog to an amazing one! Summary:Definitely a local place to try Pros:Hot dogs are only 1.75 soo cheap Cons:Cash only Parking can be tough - they have their own parking lot in the back but also street parking is available!"}, {"review_id": "qJaattb9L-SyQokClEHsCQ", "user_id": "iW_1sgfdUolX9C8ujU34Wg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Some of the best dogs I've ever had in my life. I am so sad we forgot to add the cheese. But the onions and the chili was so packed in and you need to get at least 3 cuz you're gonna want to keep eating! You can't get more American than that!!! Next time I am definitely not forgetting the cheese. I really can't express how good these hot dogs are because they are hot dogs and you know what good dogs taste like. So I will just leave my 5 stars here so you can try for yourself."}, {"review_id": "HtmkBhpx-6OYPy3wUgmNBw", "user_id": "zyOJ1BS4Mj0_HqjWpNYzTQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2017", "text": "The best hot dogs in town. My family and I have been coming here for a very long time and the dogs are always delicious and always consistent. We've never tried anything else here. We're always in to get the same \"works\" hot dogs... but of course if you're a local here and been coming here for a long time you just ask your number of dogs and ask for \"up\".

From the neon signs to the wooden benches this place is a throwback to basics are best.Where can you go in Massachusetts to get RC Cola, Wachusett Chips, Table Talk Pies and wonderful skinny hot dogs topped with the Coney sauce (essentially a meat sauce)? Hog Dogs are $1.75 each and for the average appetite you will need to have 2 dogs. My appetite requires 3 and have friends that do not leave CI without eating 8. The bun is soft, fixings are done by staff and never have to wait. Worcester is a proud city and Worcester County is fiercely proud and does not have to tell people they are from Boston like everyone from Eastern Mass. Take a drive over to Coney Island and have yourself the Woostah Special.This includes 2 dogs, can of soda from Polar Beverages, a fresh very large half sour pickle and Table Talk Pie which I might add are all from Worcester County, take that Boston! Don't come here for healthy foods unless you count the pickle. You might even know of someone that left a message on one of the wooden benches that are etched with graffiti from the last 100 years.

Who could resist an Coney Island dog from George's?! Whenever you go, you need to get \"the works\" and multiple dogs! Hot dog smothered in chili, mustard, and onion. Yes please! I like 2-3 dogs with a side of chips and Polar Beverages cola to wash it down. To feed my boyfriend and I, it costs about $10-15 for each of us to have the same order. The environment transports you back to a simpler time and you're usually in and out of there within 20 min. I've moved away now but am always craving George's Coney Island dogs.

The interior looks like it probably hasn't changed since it opened nearly 100 years ago, and I mean that in the best possible way. It's full of no-frills, wooden  booths that have been carved with 98 years worth of names and initials. There's a large dining room when you walk in, and off to the side, there's a smaller room with a bar, limited seating, and an open space where (I've heard) they sometimes host bands or comedians. And then there's the food. Most recently, I ordered a Worcester Special, which included 2 hot dogs, a soda, a pickle, and a Table Talk Pie. The hot dogs are always made fresh to order. I order mine \"up\" which means they'll come with mustard, chili, and diced onions. Though, they offer countless other topping combinations. The pickle is large enough to share, and who can say no to a single-serve pie to end the meal? The Worcester Special will set you back $6.95 plus tax. What I love the most about Coney Island is their commitment to supporting local institutions. They sell the finest Polar Beverages, the freshest Wachusett Potato Chips, and classic Table Talk Pies. Even the pickles are locally made.

It's a local institution and step back in time with its graffiti covered wooden booths and juke box. You order at a counter then move down the line to the register as they put a tray together for you. The staff was pleasant & line moved quickly $1.75/ dog. Got 3 \"works\" dogs which has mustard, chopped onions & chili. Added relish cause that's the kinda guy I am. Also got a bag of chips, root beer and a giant half sour pickle. In all it was okay. Wanted the pickle and dogs to have a bit more zip but that didn't stop me from eating it all. Glad for the experience but truthfully, it didn't live up to my hype.  Worth a shot if you're considering."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/georges-coney-island-lunch-worcester?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
