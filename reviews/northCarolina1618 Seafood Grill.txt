I thought the dishes were a little too fancy and focused a lot on presentation and \"Wow' factor and not enough on just making good food.They do this kind of weird thing where you order an entrée and it comes with too mini-entrées. So in fact you get three mini entrées instead of one meal. I ordered the Chilean Seabass and got a very small piece of fish and then two other things I didn't really care for."}, {"review_id": "wSDaN3Pj7HLebz4KL6hOOw", "user_id": "9qTmQeOKZMppgnySdHA-QA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "This place is a hidden gem of Greensboro.

Easily one of the best meals we have had in the state. We started off with the calamari appetizer. It had a hint of wasabi glaze (I am not a wasabi fan and didn't mind this at all) and served with some type of spicy mayo sauce. We both agree this was one of the best calamari appetizer we have ever had. It was so good I am salivating at just writing about it. Next, I got the seafood trio (scallops, shrimp, and red snapper). The portion was very generous and everything was cooked to perfection. My husband ordered the ahi tuna and said that it was the best ahi tuna he has had, which is saying a lot since we have had a lot of tuna in the past trips to Japan! The ambience and service was the cherry on top. Highly recommend and we will be back for sure."}, {"review_id": "hrLJU0kvX3kDudyPg7zF4g", "user_id": "NgEuIIiWDEIGbzaFHi8uhw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "This place is TO DIE FOR. Truly. We went here on a Thursday night, and thank goodness we had reservations. It was PACKED. Definitely don't assume you can walk in and get seated quickly. Our group started out with the Pan Seared Duck Breast Tacos, and they were amazing. Truly. For dinner, I had the Sesame Seed Crusted Ahi Tuna. Again, it was amazing, and the portion I received was extremely large. I am gluten-free, and when I told our waiter this, she let me know that most of the entrees could be made to accommodate​ my allergy, which I really appreciated.

Our choices were: Calamari, Fish Tacos, Steak Tacos, and Crab Cake Nachos - an unintended Mexican theme here.The Calamari has no peer, absolutely none - perfectly cooked, well sized, bliss! The Fish Tacos (Halibut this go round) were tasty, but the fish needs to be more plentiful, or the slaw less so. The Steak Tacos were ok, but the taco shells were simply strange, and tasteless.  The Crab Cake Nachos were awesome, centered around an excellent crab cake.We finished with Key Lime Pie, very nice. The service is excellent in the bar, our constant choice, while the main dining area has more than the occasional bump."}, {"review_id": "SS5Lw5tzYDBWU4SrpX-khQ", "user_id": "FxQG2lexGRMMsBhZ2Deimg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Probably one of the top 3 restaurants in Greensboro.  Wonderful chef, great customer service and definitely the best drinks and bartenders in town."}, {"review_id": "ax9-sSgoojhIqFCJRKZCsQ", "user_id": "zLaGvDtBPupMOjpc-2xHag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2016", "text": "This was a dining experience.  Don't go if you're in a hurry, but if you want to experience your meal as well as enjoy the food this is the place for seafood lovers.  We had reservations and we are seated right away.  From the exterior you wouldn't expect the artsy industrial restaurant interior.  The atmosphere is more New York than Greensboro so right away you're transported and the expectations rise.  Our server, Dion, was knowledgeable about the menu and the restaurant's history.  He made us feel a part of the tradition and referred to his employers and colleagues as family!  He is delightful and we'll request to be seated with him next time.  The food was slow coming but worth the wait.  The menu explains the wait as everything is prepared as ordered so you can expect this to be the proper temperature when it is served. For starters I had the jumbo lump crab cake nachos.  Pause for dramatic effect.  A nice size crab cake (all crab) with manchego and cheddar cheese, pickled jalapeños, portobello mushrooms, grilled peppers and avocado for $13.  Suffice it to say that it was delicious. Not to mention it's made with my favorite cheese ever manchego! There's enough here to make this your entree unless you're sharing.  My husband had the dinner salad which is made with goat cheese, roasted peppers, red onions, mixed greens and crostini with your choice of dressing.  He selected the balsamic bacon, but there were at least 5 other choices.  He loved the salad and if you're not too hungry his could also be your entree if they would add some seafood to it.My spouse is not a huge seafood fan so he ordered panko crusted chicken stuffed with roasted red peppers, mozzarella and basil. It was served over mussels, andouille sausage and crab jambalaya, sautéed broccoli and crispy leeks for $25.  He said he didn't taste any crab which is just as well since he says he doesn't like crab.  The chicken was delicious and he ate the whole thing. Neither of us are fans of mussels, I ate them and found they were very tasty because the tomato sauce from the jambalaya helped to season the mussels quite a bit. I ordered the lightly blackened grouper for $36.  It was served over sautéed spinach with goat chesse, queso sauce, black bean puree, red onion and scallion confit.  It was missing what the menu described as crab mousse stuffed cherry tomatoes but. I forgot about that once I tasted it. It was delicious.  The grouper was lightly blackened and very flaky and more and moist. Some people might think that these entrees were small servings but actually I believe it's a normal serving. We have become so accustomed in America to super huge plates of food that we don't know a normal serving when we see one."}, {"review_id": "zBwxfB_qDlOawsIsf3kxkA", "user_id": "ey88ywOdRVGEMmd6YyJNIA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/8/2017", "text": "Been here a few times.

This is probably one of the most creative restaurants I have ever been to. After reading through the menu and ordering a few dishes I still wasn't really sure what to expect when the actual dish came out. They had a good wine selection and I like that you can purchase smaller or larger pours. We ordered some of the smaller plates and then split an entree. My least favorite of the small plates was the scallop/lobster dish, my scallop was super chewy. I really enjoyed the shrimp and roasted duck dish. Who would have thought to put those two things together?! I knew I had to order the sesame crusted ahi tuna because it definitely seems to be their signature dish. They were awesome and split it for us, the presentation was beautiful. More importantly it tasted amazing. Such a unique combo of flavors, I have never had wasabi mashed potatoes before. Would order that dish again in a heart beat. The Key Lime pie was the perfect way to end the meal. The interior surprised me. I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't that. It was kind of like up scale industrial, I was a fan. Parking was easy in their back lot.
