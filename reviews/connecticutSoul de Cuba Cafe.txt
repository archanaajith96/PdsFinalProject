The place was busy but not overcrowded. After a warm and pleasant greeting from the employees there and some menu suggestions I placed an order to go. At first I thought the price was a touch high. But I got a very fresh and well made sandwich with a hearty side salad. It was worth the price! Fresh and very nicely seasoned meat. I am excited to go back and sit down to enjoy a dinner. Best to make reservations as seating is limited. Drink menu for cocktails looks great as well."}, {"review_id": "KFfFhsPtXWicqApTbK-k0g", "user_id": "q2yHFOWqQwPtCX5UxOrltg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Came here for a 9:30 reservation on a Friday night. As others have mentioned, the space is very tight. There was no hostess, and although there were some servers dashing around, no one seemed concerned with asking us if we needed a table. Fast forward, we finally got a table, and after 10 minutes, it was apparent that the service was going to be non-existent for the evening. I had to flag someone down for water. Once our orders were taken, no one came to check on us or give us more water. The food came out quickly enough as did the check, but overall,I'd place the service in the \"abysmal\" category. Pretty good food and selections, but part of the going out to a restaurant is the experience, and this place falls VERY short in that area."}, {"review_id": "ywyS-ZDEdrwchSbgoevrxQ", "user_id": "ghgxuMPEd8hSWhqNrVN2ZA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Very good Cuban food. Full disclaimer: I lived in the Miami area for nearly 8 years, and I became quite critical of Cuban cuisine. This restaurant is a little tight on the inside, but it never felt uncomfortable considering every seat was filled. The menu contained a list of Cuban favorites, but a few items puzzled me (Salmon, mussels, tofu). Although I didn't try them, they are probably delicious and although not conventional Cuban items, likely prepared in a traditional Cuban style. I had the Red Snapper entree, and it was delicious. I was overall very impressed, and would pit this restaurant against many Cuban restaurants in South Florida."}, {"review_id": "s5XGV11jXSn46aQk2PAkMw", "user_id": "6ucCw9uelYXfaOajQvQyng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Last night we were around the area and decided to stop in for dinner here.

We started with a pork belly appetizer, and it was cooked to perfection. The side of plantains was also a nice touch. It was a great dish to split with 4 people. Everyone's main dishes were also delicious. The steak was cooked to perfection, and the Platano Relleno (like a lasagna with sweet plantains, beef, and swiss cheese) was a tasty, unique treat. The Lechon Asado was probably my favorite; the pork was cooked so tenderly.Unfortunately, my caipirinha was pretty small for the price and minimally alcoholic. I would not order it from here again. The restaurant is intimate, thought they can accommodate groups, which is unique. The space can get a little loud, though."}, {"review_id": "f1O6CsAId3hBHp7bpv67xw", "user_id": "OHS9w17ejao_P4m89Y63hQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Have always wanted to try their sandwiches but never had the chance to go before 5pm. Finally made it for lunch and was not disappointed. I got the Cuban sandwich with the salad on the side and shared some plantains. I haven't had many Cubans but I enjoyed this one. The plantains were okay and a bit pricy for the amount ($1 per plantain). The portions of the sandwich combo was plentiful. I recall coming here for dinner one time and the entrees were not that filling and quite pricy. Service was fine. All in all, seems like a decent lunch spot.

We ordered the tortilla de papa and the guava roast BBQ omelette. We actually wanted to try the tortas but the sandwich pressing machine was down. Bummer! The guava roast BBQ omelette consisted of a generous portion of very juicy, tender BBQ meat wrapped in a blanket eggs. Incredible! It came with a side of some salad and bread to mop up all the delicious juices of the roast BBQ. The tortilla de papa was made up of potato and eggs \"quiche\" topped with aioli. Alongside that were toasted bread with a fresh spread of diced onions and tomatoes on top. Unfortunately the dish only came with 3 pieces of shrimp...I was expecting more than potatoes and bread for $16. The flavors however were again very delicious. I would come here again but only for special occasions. This place is not college student budget friendly and most dishes average $15-$20 a plate."}, {"review_id": "5-Z9Hedh0cL0g4erTxFR2g", "user_id": "2iU6QyTl_Wm31rtAs15kLA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "I've visited this establishment about three times. I wasn't impressed with my first visit, but I really enjoyed my next two visits. To start service is fantastic, bartenders make great drinks, I had about five capirinahs. Wait staff is attentive and management followed up to make sure customers were satisfied. I recently stopped in for lunch, and left full and happy with my experience. I ordered the soul de Cuba, which is their twist on the traditional Cubano. It was delicious, the meat was flavorful, a generous amount of manchengo and meat was pressed to perfection between a baguette. I ordered a salad as a side and it was okay, no complaints. I also ordered a side order of tostones. They were cooked to perfection, not overly dry but nice and crispy served with a delicious mojo sauce. I'm excited to come back and try out more of their menus. The few drawbacks are the small size of the establishment and the above average prices."}, {"review_id": "Xw6xiGyBcjho3A2AmqfpRg", "user_id": "jUGewcZ66s5HBcqJyuCaGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/13/2017", "text": "It's a bit sad that this main strip is mostly known for Bar and Geronimo's, causing this little spot to often be over looked.  I came here on a Thursday afternoon and split a lechon asado plate.  It all melted in our mouths as the tender meat met with the perfect compliment of rice and beans, with the little side of plantains giving a not too sweet palate cleanse to keep from being overwhelmed.Our waitress (who was sooo lovely) was able to answer questions from two uncultured diners, i.e. myself and my girlfriend."}, {"review_id": "ccShXwuVtkQQCXhB0FdGQw", "user_id": "fceNKZ-mTE9yA_MvsUxoLA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "This is sincerely great Cuban food.

The onions were sweet and the rice was reasonable. The pork, however tasted dry and salty without much other predominating flavor. Could've used a second serving of the plantains, that's for sure.The fricase de pollo was my dessert, which was tender and moist, but rather bland.  Am I taking crazy pills or something??Not the best way to spend $40 on a Saturday evening =(.Either way I'll be back to try the sandwiches (before 5PM apparently) and hope to update my review positively!"}, {"review_id": "WX3onspPkav1s1m76YCBng", "user_id": "OyV9qM4Qx4Igu5WSpLn7cQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/21/2017", "text": "One of my favorite spots.  Be sure to make a reservation, it is very intimate here.  The staff is delightful.  The rum punch is sweet, and they make a killer coconut mojito.  Honestly, most of the cocktails run towards the sweeter side.  My favorite dish is the pollo de fricase, which is citrusy and tastes like Cuban home cooking.  The artwork on the walls is a pleasure to look at, and I always feel like I've found a slice of Cuban paradise when I am in here."}, {"review_id": "yHH_Oq7-xG0XzC4yq7j8TA", "user_id": "9hAxTkGGJpSX0QaBZZ5jWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "I've always wanted to visit this place and finally got the chance to tonight.

We had planned to go out for Turkish food for lunch but discovered upon arrival that the restaurant they like was closed. Undeterred my cousins suggested we try Soul de Cuba Cafe where they had been several times and except for the fact that it always crowded, they said the food was excellent. Well, if you want to go and find it not crowded, do what we did, go Christmas eve day because there were only about four other people in the restaurant!It is easy to understand why Soul de Cuba is usually crowded, The restaurant is quite small but it is also beautifully decorated, has a friendly waitstaff that can converse in both English or Spanish and delicious food! I had the Media Noche (marinated roast pork, caramelizedonions, swiss cheese and pickles on pressed sweet breadwith mayo) and my cousins split a Cubano (baked ham, salami, roast pork, swiss cheese,mustard/mayo). Both were served on perfectly toasted sweet bread and both were superbly flavored with plenty of filling. My cousins had chips with theirs and I had a salad that had a mixture of greens which I appreciated with mine. We then each finished our meals with their delcious cafe con leche.  Soul de Cuba Cafe is not inexpensive but it serves well made food and is a classy place. I am definitely a fan!"}, {"review_id": "kvtTNUZHh0kk1o7tZYA3LA", "user_id": "JK4hzpYfQl57cMv-v8sGDA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/22/2017", "text": "Came on a Sunday. Free street parking. The place is small but enough tables. There was live music. Food was great and there was cafe con leche and Cuban toast. Although we had to discuss the charge and the amount we got. They were not use to getting a Cuban toast request. It's more of a breakfast food. I ordered the oxtail for $25. Pretty pricey but I really loved how they flavored it then how the Tampa Cuban places prepare it with more of a tomato base sauce. This place seem to use red wine and some herbs. The black bean chili soup was good too. Really enjoyed the place.

It touches my soul (seriously, didn't plan that. No pun intended), its that damn good. I've been here several times now, and always make a point to visit when I'm in town. Their Cuban food is authentic and classic. Dishes include standouts such as Ropa Veja, milanesa, tres leches....just to name a few. I've always gotten the pollo fricasse- so rich and flavorful. Orgasmic!!! It comes with a side of rice (white or yellow) and black beans, sweet fried plantains. It's honestly enough for two people. I can never finish it!!! Their mojitos are on point too. Try the pineapple- it's not on the menu but they will make it and it's so good.Service is always impeccable, and the music always matches my mood. Only thing I would change is the size of the place (or maybe not, because then it wouldn't be as intimate?). Other than that, you can't go wrong here!Parking can be tricky- I've only ever walked here.
