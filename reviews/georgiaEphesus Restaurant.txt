That's one of the reasons I love Yelp. I rarely eat bad meals and if I do, it's my fault for not listening to the Yelpers! We called in a to go order on a Sunday night.  Food was ready when we arrived and we gave them 10-15 minutes.  I had the Traditional Mixed Grill, and my husband had the Adana Kabob. He was a little surprised at the cost when he went to pick up the food, but had not realized what I ordered. I think that for the amount of meat we received, the price was very fair.  I think the chicken was my favorite protein. I enjoyed the steak, gyro and adana as well. We got a few pieces of pita bread and the meals came with rice.  My husband's favorite protein was the adana.  I know we will try it again, and next time go for the full experience and dine in!"}, {"review_id": "I5f5DqqEic6ptKd5kM2nOw", "user_id": "4ywgedwa6G1WYGglMvdvpA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/8/2017", "text": "Wonderful food but pricey.  Excellent food and very attentive (and well trained wait staff).  Flavors were robust without being overbearing in the slightest.  Crisp lettuce and my chicken entree was moist and perfectly seasoned.   NOTE: rather 'European' sized portions.  Some might want to hit up the McDs after.  And price point did not seem to reflect the region.  Lunch special and cheapest entree plus sharing an appetizer without alcohol (But we did have dessert-- because we were still hungry) came to $56 with standard tip.    Some days I don't mind spending over $50 for lunch, but today wasn't one of those days."}, {"review_id": "68du08TVWZaG6W33_2DHdQ", "user_id": "Pgk7csTpUWQNbs0JKoWH0w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/8/2017", "text": "It's not full greek, more turkish.  BUT fantastic food.  The lamb kebab was excellent.The Bomba dessert was... perfect.You will not be disappointed.  Do not leave without eating the Bombahhhhhh!"}, {"review_id": "HidCykiZ9zfeh5rkioKpHA", "user_id": "_kZ0tGhxgHU8qOtENAUsAQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/23/2017", "text": "From the outside this restaurant can seem a little sketch. BUT. Don't let that stop you from passing through the doors and experiencing the food--because it is delicious. Something to note, going along with my comment above (the sketchy-ness, not the food), is that while the outside may seem one way the inside fancy. Cloth napkin fancy. You're welcome for that tidbit of information. I do this so you can learn from my--ahem, some random, totally not me, stranger's mistakes.The first time that I came to this location my friends and I had been working in my backyard and decided that where we hadn't ever been here before it would be a great place to drop in and get some food. We were imagining something like a fast foodish place--you can see where we went wrong, and maybe where this is going. We walked in and immediately knew we were out of place. Because there were so few people there at the time we decided that it was okay for us to stay and still try the food. We were hungry. We shared a sampling of a lot of different things but the thing that has stood out in my memory, and what I got the next time I was there, was the mixed meat plate. So much meat (some of it I never would have tried on my own) and all of it is good.The times that I have been there the staff have been courteous (even, and maybe especially so, when we came in sweaty and underdressed) .This place is definitely someplace you should try to visit!"}, {"review_id": "QsIOxN0zTHgdtnfn_0rVgQ", "user_id": "gJ-RfLd3LW23p1VLrZxp5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/7/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I've been to this restaurant several times now and the food is spectacular and the service is phenomenal.

However, I need to question the authenticity of the cuisine. Some of you know that I was a professional cook for some years...and for three of those years I trained under chefs from Crete, yeah that Crete. I had the \"smoked eggplant (aka baba ganoush \") , the Mediterrainean salad (aka Greek salad) and the Gyro plate. Like I said the food was, well, okay. But, this was not Greek, though that's what part of there tag is on Yelp. There  was little to no smoke flavor with regard to the eggplant. The Mediterranean salad used domestic cheese and the Gyro meat was unimpressive at the very least. Yelp is a go to for me, I use it nearly every day. However,  on this occasion based in the reviews,  I was, well sheesh, what are you thinking?Bottom line; a pricey pretender with lots of dazzle but little substance."}, {"review_id": "Yn-bKDSU9cZj8nBZZEWyJg", "user_id": "_2rp5pd6o3RMQ1hE8XBQxA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2017", "text": "Very enjoyable. 4 of us and everyone liked what they ordered.

I'd highly recommend it.The food here is good, and the atmosphere is nice if you're looking for low-key and quiet; perfect for a date. The only thing stopping me from giving a 5-star rating is the fact that their portions were a bit small (for my taste) and it was too high a price for the amount. I'd suggest Sheeshkebab over in Evans if you're looking for more food at a little bit of a lower price, and perhaps a more upbeat atmosphere. But if you don't mind paying a little more, then Ephesus is an okay place to go."}, {"review_id": "qEbwTLZorWu0fCzXGuqS-A", "user_id": "N0-3GT2WlqY4fRxpuSvdsQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/29/2017", "text": "A hidden gem of Augusta.

For my mother's birthday in November we settled on this place for her dinner, which fell on a Monday, and the day of we looked this place up and realized they weren't open on Mondays. So we ended up going somewhere else. I chose this place for my birthday dinner this year and this establishment went above and beyond to make my dinner and my party feel welcomed and special!!! That's pretty much is all that someone asks for on a special day like their birthday!!!I chose this place months in advance to host my dinner. I would just show up with my party and dine in but as the date got closer I realized that I should make a reservation just in case, and I was right. I made a reservation for 8 people the day before my dinner and this place was very accommodating and even called me the day of to make sure everything was still as planned. My party arrived in three different groups, with me being in the second group. There was no problem with seating or anything. We were welcomed with open arms. The last group in my party arrived a little late because they get off work at the exact time my dinner started. This wasn't an issue for the staff. They waited for everyone to arrive and handled everything perfect!!! There were 2 teenagers in my party so they were a little iffy about eating at an authentic Mediterranean restaurant but as the food arrived they became fans!!! I was introduced to Greek food as a child. One of the doctor's in my mother's office was a member of the Greek Orthodox Church and gave us tickets to the local festival downtown. The food was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I hadn't had food with that much flavor before and I was HOOKED!!! As a middle aged adult, Mediterranean food is one of my absolute favorite type of food!!! The waitress explained the menu to everyone and everyone decided on their entrees. After several minutes, the waitress came back and said that the people who ordered the gyros had to choose something else because they ran out of the ingredients to make them. That wasn't a big problem the ones who ordered the gyros chose a meatball dish or doner dish.For this inconvenience the staff gave the whole table different appetizers, which were hummus, eggplant salad, and spicy mashed vegetables all with pita bread as well. I tried the spicy dish and it was super delicious!!! The whole table enjoyed these appetizers. I chose the chicken Shish for my entree and it came with salad and rice. The wait was a little long for everyone's food, even the waitress went back to help cook to quicken the arrival time of our food.  The entrees finally arrived and it was unanimously by the whole table that the food was delicious. My brother and I switched meats because his was more flavorful than mine, and that rice was something serious!!! I'm already a fan of jasmine rice but they added something called Arzo to it that took it up about 10 more notches!!! As a treat for my brother and I's birthday they provided the whole table with baklava and even gave me and my brother our food and drinks free!!! I'm not sure if they do this regularly or for just us but I was absolutely floored and so appreciative for all these kind jesters. I was even debating if I should celebrate my birthday this year because of the sad state of affairs going on in America at this time but it goes to show you that there are still very kind people in the world and there is still a lot of LOVE to go around!!! Ephesus restaurant thank you for restoring my faith in America and showing me and my party such great hospitality and we will be back to try many other things on the menu!!!!"}, {"review_id": "mDBv6mQODR08UKM_6CRNYA", "user_id": "QjNjVF-ZdWr-P4zUzXwpVA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/18/2015", "text": "This is such a wonderful place to have a group brunch with friends and family. It's tucked away behind other shops and you'd think it was going to be some takeout place, but the dining room really got my attention with the crisp linens, bright lighting and pleasant music. We came for lunch on the weekend and there were only about 3 other tables dining so were  seated in the middle and got a really good view of the decor and kitchen. Our server was a sweet young woman who's studying for med school and she was quite charming. Our friend likes to be a cheesy dad and give waitresses a hard time but she gave it right back to him which was commendable. She made some awesome recommendations and really hit it out of the park with their babganoush which is the best I've had since my best friend's mother's homemade dip which she only makes for family parties. I swear I could have licked that plate clean!We had the mixed grill which comes with lamb, gyros, chicken, beef and grilled veggies and the Iskender kebabs to share between the three of us and it was more than enough. After the meal, tea and a tiny piece of baklava was brought out for us and my friend swears it the best baklava he ever had but I'm gonna have to fight him on this one and stay true to my taste buds that insists Greek baklava is the way to go. Other than that, the meal was amazing, the service fantastic, and the owner was very kind and gracious. This restaurant is truly one of the rising stars in Augusta."}, {"review_id": "F4OPAzEEx7s1jnV3PcYl2w", "user_id": "6bSHuE9Ywgc4x0mHso3PRg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/18/2017", "text": "I absolutely loved this place.
