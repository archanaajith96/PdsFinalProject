Food was amazing. Service was top notch and when I got the bill- wow, pretty fair prices for lunch. I was treating so pretty stoked. For sure a return location for me.Only tiny baby gripe was the tall seating at a bistro table but it was all they had left and 90% of the other seating looked awesome but we did not want to wait so we went with it."}, {"review_id": "-KtwWFqC7vfvfsqe06VQhA", "user_id": "QlU6c2gpH3wycMn1ULCPXQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "The family went to this restaurant today. I was a bit skeptical, as I heard they are more upscale. However, the Pad See Ew was some of the best I have had, here in town. The others had Pad Thai and Pad Kee Mao, which were both very good.The service was good, and the bill was pretty standard. No complaints, and the ambience is better than other Asian places here in town.Thai ice coffee and tea, very good!We will be back!"}, {"review_id": "xfaABBfOK3UJA4RDnOUqiQ", "user_id": "s7qFhPQgZq_po9ffh_Icpg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "I'd been hearing a lot about Sabai since moving to Eugene, and today was the day I finally tried it!We made last minute lunch reservations this morning for 8 people, and they were able to fit us in at 1pm with a nice table in the back section. This was great as that area is a bit quieter in a side room that is partially open to the rest of the restaurant.Sabai's cocktail list looked fun and inviting but I opted for a glass of rosé. We shared a bunch of appetizers at our table, and the stand out are their wings. Ohh. Emm. Gee. Sticky, sweet, spicy and delicious. Our server also brought out little bowls of warm water to clean our hands after. A nice touch!I was out with coworkers celebrating a work achievement and, unfortunately, had to leave early. So, I ordered the Noodle Tom Kha soup to go for my main meal. It traveled really well as they packaged the rice noodles separately so they wouldn't get mushy. The soup had excellent flavor and perfect amount of medium spiciness. I look forward to coming back when I have more time to enjoy a full meal here and really take in the casual yet trendy atmosphere."}, {"review_id": "FeUzTaVU_VKGRNiCtC-rqw", "user_id": "Rx7t8mnuANYweDPRQLOIAA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Great place for a nice fancy dinner.

Met my girlfriend there for dinner. Felt like I somehow had stepped through to a big city from little old Eugene. It was busy on a Tuesday night and the restaurant is a very large although it's very pretty. Service was excellent and the food was fantastic. Although it was busy we were able to linger and chat for quite a while and nobody felt like we were staying long. You really need a reservation but it's worth it to go and have dinner at Sabai we will definitely come back"}, {"review_id": "2UzAV8FArM8qn15dDKNuag", "user_id": "E4IOLwXOPXHDpDmjbpf8tQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Sabai was one of the first date nights out I had in Eugene when I moved here because of the recommendations and reviews. Located in Oakway, the candlelit atmosphere was great for a night out! Great drinks and the food was delicious- we had pockets of love to start (DEFINITELY worth it), I had a stir fry, and my husband had the pad thai. I love spicy foods, but it was much more intense than expected and I wish I had asked for a little less. My only qualm with Sabai is that I feel it is WAY overpriced. I can find comparable quality Thai food in the area for about half the price. However, you are definitely paying for the area and the atmosphere, and there are not any similar places serving Thai/pacific rim food that have date night vibes!"}, {"review_id": "jAS5z5Nl1-w-pygm1PMmCA", "user_id": "gbak6CfHdEp7qMcBgncInA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/1/2017", "text": "Yum! Sabai was a great choice for my birthday dinner. I love Pad Thai and theirs was great! It is a huge portion too, I definitely had leftovers. I also really liked the \"pockets of love\" appetizer which is basically crab rangoon. The staff was really nice and it's a pretty nice atmosphere. The Thai iced tea is good here (I don't always like it from some places) but is very sweet! I also enjoyed their spice rack instead of siracha. I mean, I love love love siracha, it was just nice to have something a little different.

I was really excited to go and check out what the fuss was about!I love Thai food so choosing only a few dishes was seriously hard. My group was big into splitting so we chose to split the Pad Ke Mao (I'm obsessed with the big noodles), crisply Thai basil, the crispy green beans, and salad rolls. Everything was so delicious and absolutely didn't disappoint. Also our waitress was amazing and had such an amazing time. However in the morning I felt horrible and proceeded to have symptoms of food poisoning. I checked with other people in my group and the other person who had split the salad rolls with me felt similarly. So we are quite certain the salad rolls were the culprit. Really good spot, but would only recommend getting cooked dishes!!"}, {"review_id": "vz7wYZQNwUDB7NeCwLoLaQ", "user_id": "Pnrd9_RA8N2z7c7QMQOFTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "sabai has cornered the market on excellent thai flavor and quality in eugene.  the menu has nice seasonal options as well as go-toregulars and the presentation and attention of the wait staff make for a great experience if you're smart and forward thinking enough to make a reservation!  if you don't make a reservation, plan on standing in the foyer and waiting on fri or sat nights because it's that popular.  i'd imagine that scenario could play out on weeknights too.we ordered two appetizers and two entrees, had plenty of food at the table and even took some home. it was just as good the next day and whenever i know i'm heading to eugene, i start to plot when i'll be able to make it to sabai.  living in seattle where we have endless thai options, it says something that sabai is a shining star on my eugene trip itineraries."}, {"review_id": "2Bt3frt1xpm9fn_xiA3DWA", "user_id": "WKuA7GoU5B3IsghwSCcwtQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "We came here for my sister's birthday recently and the food and drinks were delicious! The service was a little slow, but we didn't mind. It allowed us to talk and catch up. The thing that bothered me and the reason for 4 stars was the fact they charge $2 per person for a cake slicing fee. I found this absolutley ridiculous, but at the time we didn't really have a choice as it was an ice cream cake. When we made the reservations, this should have been brought up, but we now know for next time. Parking was a little difficult since it's in the Oakway Center.

I've had a wonderful server the last few times I've been in, they're always helpful enough but not too helpful (if you know what I mean...none of that lingering around your table but you also don't get ignored).I highly recommend their cocktails, curries and stir fries. My favorite cocktail is the confession. You can also get the non-alcoholic drinks to be made as alcoholic drinks, just ask! My favorite dish is the red curry, but I'm also a big fan of the pad ga prau.They're not messing around when they say that their medium spice is spicy, so I recommend sticking with medium. I like a bit of spice and it has that, but also maintains its flavor.The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because of the pad Thai...I mean, it's fine, but it's not the best in town. Also, prices have gone up a bit. You still have a good experience and great food, but just be willing to spend the money for it. Five stars for everything else, I'm just not sold on the pad Thai. I especially recommend this as a date night spot!"}, {"review_id": "f5TID2a6QpWUutWvyRKjGQ", "user_id": "lk3rLOrKWm78DjexkgAMCg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Overpriced, hyped up, regular Thai food I can get at Tasty Thai Campus for half the price and tastes the same.

I'm not sure where this \"Swipe fee\" is going (tip or bottom line), but it's either a cost of doing business or it's part of your job and pre-filled 18% tip.I'll make sure we steer clear next time the whole office crew wants to go out."}, {"review_id": "_YioRpiYQMz5YfYi_576eA", "user_id": "8yHrwkWOUE9c5Yde5b4XOg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Our favorite restaurant in Eugene.

It was pretty awful I was about to leave when someone finally brought me a glass of water. I was already invested in waiting which was a total bummer. I ordered the avocado green curry dish for $17 and it wasn't worth the price. The tofu was cool, the noodles were horribly over cooked and the broccoli was cold. The curry was warm and flavored well. The avocado added a richness that was pleasant.
