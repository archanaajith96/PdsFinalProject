We started out with the shrimp cocktail. The shrimp was enormous, more than enough for the four of us. Next came the mussels, set in a delicate buttery sauce that will make you sigh it's so good. For a moment my friend wasn't sure she could get the duck (they were nearly sold out) until Chef came by and told her that he would make sure she had the duck. Meanwhile we had lobster bisque as we waited on our meals. Divine. Everyone enjoyed a different entree. In addition to the duck, we ordered lamb chops, steak and bass. Everything was prepared to perfection. This is definitely our new favorite restaurant in Davenport. We are already making plans to return to try the paella which our waiter recommends ordering ahead of time."}, {"review_id": "eRiP_EsgMuOvUd2kpM7pOg", "user_id": "akiIhaV0vVVfDwEozKZxEw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Duck City seems to be a staple restaurant in Davenport.   It is situated downtown in a quaint shuttle bar with a beautiful tin ceiling.  Immediately you realize this place is different when they start showing you the meals of the day.The meals are in a \"deli case\" so you can see how they are prepared.  Also, it shows you that the portion sizes are not normal by any means.  I dare one person to eat their whole meal at Duck City without taking some home.I was traveling for business so my friend and I decided to split the smoked pork chop that is an Iowa signature dish.  They charge $5 for a split plate fee because they give you extra sides for each person.  The dinner comes with two huge chunks of bread along with two heads of roasted garlic.  The bread alone could be a meal all by itself.  Next I chose the garlic house salad....notice a garlic theme here?  The salad had quite a bit of dressing that did NOT skimp on the garlic.   It was a little oversauced but a very different spin on salad.  Thank goodness I wasn't sharing a hotel room!After some bread and salad I am almost full even before the main course arrives.  The pork chop is a double thick stuffed with ham and cheese.  This cut is an Iowa signature along with the smoke and stuffing.  It was incredible and was a smart move to split because portions are generous.There are crayons in a small wine glass on the table.  It stumped me for a few minutes until I noticed that people write their names on the brick.  I decided not to memorialize my visit on the bricks but did decide that when I am back in Davenport I will definitely visit Duck City again."}, {"review_id": "mqIqJWBS3DnC-YkrQGL7bw", "user_id": "Qu9NGmXLu1crb1hEr9nmog", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "It was good - I came alone and sat at the bar.  I did not have a reservation.  The food is good and a good value.  I would not come again.  Service at the bar was not so good - felt ignored.  I could not wait to leave."}, {"review_id": "n_xDqmcx9R25UsDUSk7-7w", "user_id": "AXXMCNrdgST155kS4lLq-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "Really good food, staff, and owners.

No complaints in regards to the waiter.  He was very nice and attentive. Now the food is a different story.  My husband ordered the salmon, it was fried, over done, and served over mashed potatoes. His meal was not worth the 29 dollars! This meal was worth about 15 dollars. I ordered the tuna, again the quality is just not there for 33 dollars. The tuna was covered in a strange sauce. Both meals came with very tiny portions of zuchinni and broccoli. Overall the ambiance was outdated, we felt we were in a 1970s mob movie. The back room was covered by a black sheet. When you get a glimpse of that back room it isn't very clean. We ordered one soup, two coffees, two entrees, for 100 dollars, not worth it!"}, {"review_id": "nVpEPkeOF-hBPQv4G_-dyQ", "user_id": "Iimy3ewsZkLKQ9NEsQ9e5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/10/2017", "text": "My husband had the duck and I had the veal.

Fantastic service and unbelievable food! When you walk in you are pleasantly greeted and automatically feel like you are in a theater. The gentleman at the front of the house elaborately describes the specials for the night with their display. It almost makes you imagine that you are already tasting the delicious food. This part may feel a little dragged out based on the number of specials they have, but it is definitely entertaining. The food also tastes as great as they make it sound. If you are interested in some fried food for the night be sure to get some of the duck fat fries. They are cooked to perfection and come with an amazing sauce that blends well with ketchup (they actually recommend that you do this, and im very glad that i did). You can't stop eating them! Entrees were also excellent! Their duck special came with an amazing raspberry sauce that we just couldn't get enough of. The waitress was even kind enough to pack a little extra for us with our leftovers. Had to save some to savor the next day. It was just that good. Also I just can't stress how we received excellent service! Very attentive, friendly, and prompt. One of the best dinners I had in a very long time.

Lobster Bisque was best I've ever had and the cajón ribeye was fabulous ! This is probably the best restaurant in Davenport! If was definitely chef cooked food and service , I would of given it 5 stars but it is a bit over priced ! New York City prices in Davenport, for two of us with soup and 2 glasses of wine it was 120 dollars not including tip, if it was a little less than 40$ a plate it would be 5 stars !
