When you first walk in, it reminds me of eating in a museum. Art and woodwork really come together. Great place for a first date or celebration of any kind, or if you're wanting to impress anyone from out of town. GET THERE EARLY!!! Doors open @5pm but the line starts at 4:13... lolEverything is served as an appetizer, or super small portion but it's so filling. I also love that food comes out as soon as it's done, in no order whatsoever. You Must Eat: southern farmhouse cheese, pomme frites ( I licked the plate!), Gnocchi, Springer mtn fried chicken, crispy fried oysters, and all their desserts.....

So...Good Food on Montford. First, the good...The food was very tasty. We had 2 steamed buns (amazing), the fried chicken (very good), mushrooms (ok). The staff was very helpful and friendly. Our waiter could tell it was our first time right away and he helped us enjoy the evening. Now, the not as good...It was very LOUD...perhaps that's just a friday night or maybe that's the decibel level every night, but we were overwhelmed by how loud it was. I think if we were there with a party or a double date we would not have minded, but as a couple, it was hard to think, much less talk. It was expensive...I know it's small plates/tapas, but based on my math, it should have been $$$ on yelp rather than $$. I simply didn't feel that the portions justified the price even though they tasted very good. I really wanted to like GFonM. And, If you love loud, small plates places where you need to like the food to feel good about how much you spent there, then Good Food on Montford is for you. I don't think we'll be back."}, {"review_id": "dSQMeqVmDYG7bN8v8xNK4g", "user_id": "r0j8y_oDkiT3ET6OwEA7Tw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "First bite. This place is very busy. There may be a good reason. But let's talk about the restaurant. It is a cool old storefront low roof brick building. I would say 50s 60s vintage.

The experience was perfect. Perfect food, perfect, wine, perfect service. Everything was spot on.Because of that first experience, i was SUPER excited to bring a Charlotte visitor to Good Food so she could experience the awesomeness as well. Unfortunately, this go-round fell a little flat for all of us there.When we arrived, we put our name down and went next door to grab a drink while we waited. This was a Friday night so we expected a little bit of a wait! After being seated, we saw there were a few menu changes that we were excited about. There were a few standout dishes - the Garganelli pasta with sausage, garlic, tomato, the korean beef and crispy rice, and the steamed bun. But there were just as many misses - the scallops with acquerello risotto and the fried oysters to name a couple. They just straight up lacked salt, something I hadn't seen from Good Food in the past. Our server did remove the fried oysters from our plate, which we appreciated.Other than that, the service was a bit on the meh side. Most of the dishes were brought out by runners who would just drop the plate and leave. Because of the different dishes we were eating, it would have been nice to get a description of the dish as well as clean plates!I'm hoping that this second experience was just a hiccup and whenever I'm back  I'll be blown away again like the first time."}, {"review_id": "3n4UPhzVgtKOPTXaXrCCdQ", "user_id": "qb4l3B1VifNbkGkC61emSA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "The name of this place sure does live up to the food, as in yes, this place  offers up some really good food on Montford here in CLT.

I was very excited to try one of the highest rated places in Charlotte. 1. The food is delicious and they have very original recipes. My favorite dish here was the pork carnitas. You wont find anything else like it anywhere. Very original recipe, highly recommend this one! Keep in mind, all the food here is tapas style so it will be smaller. Drinks were good too. I think Soul Gastrolounge has better drinks but this place comes close. The food alone merits 5 stars. 2. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly. She didn't check on us too much or make sure we needed anything else, so I wasn't BLOWN AWAY by the service. The service alone merits 4 stars. 3. Plan ahead. This place usually has long wait times,  your best bet is to put yourself on the waiting list using Yelp (this was such a big help to my group of 4)... if you just show up be prepared to wait AT LEAST 1 hour. 4. Environment and ambiance: It isn't super upscale and dressy.... but ladies? I'd recommend some heels and jeans and a nice shirt. Dresses are always valid too. And men? I will say a collared shirt and some shoes will work.... this isn't a place I would come to dressed super urban or casual. The crowd is grown and classy. Match the vibes people. DEFINITELY appropriate for date night."}, {"review_id": "0jrzJxfKE5z6E5ZC1VgefQ", "user_id": "nJiNGQjuq5j40VNv7YGe8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Some of the best tapas you'll find in the city.  It is pricey but worth it!  Inventive menus and great staff!"}, {"review_id": "qoh4NuNeRdvHPk9KbLaOrw", "user_id": "LUxPj9ntwYDs6Ii9vPSZWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Wow.

Maybe they added it after a lot of people complained? But yes it's there so don't be offended if they refuse to!The sauteed mushrooms are delicious, add some lemon and it will take it up a notch!The shrimp was good, nicely spiced. The naan went well with the lentils but not with the shrimp. The Korean beef was delicious!

At least they realize it. Small plate and tapas restaurants offer a really unique and interesting business model. I appreciate the speed of service, turnover rate, and quality of food. Given the margins with the costs of operating, it's a highly under-noted form of genius. With that said, the prices are pretty damn high. Portion-wise you're getting shafted, albeit not by a whole lot, but I'm not one that just loves paying $22 for 3 slices of rare beef that's the thickness of paper. The food and drinks are tasty though. We tried about 6 different things and all were notably well done.Nothing bad to say about the service, but do not attempt to get a table any time after 6pm on Friday or Saturday unless you're cool with waiting for at least an hour.This is a cool spot in an area with an identity problem. Worth checking out one time if you can stand to wait or eat dinner super early. The true score here is 3.5/5, but I'll give it a 4 because the food is...good."}, {"review_id": "xkguZ1WCXtl97MlLEvYQ0Q", "user_id": "-CIKKPeyjqN5SD7lVfIUZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Read so many great reviews about this place and I'm glad to say it did not disappoint!

We each ordered a few items to try - I had the pasta (okay but not the best I've had), fries (overrated, in my opinion) and the steam bun (delicious!). The service was terrible. Our waitress was the manager and she was super short when we asked questions. When the bill came, she didn't split it and said she wanted us to calculate how much to charge each card if we wanted it split up. Huh? So I wrote down what items to charge on each card and when I handed it to her, she was clearly irritated. When she brought it back to the table, she said \"Normally we don't do this so if you ask next time and we are busy, we will say no\". While the food had some high notes, the service overall left a bad impression (although I will say, the other employees who brought our food or refilled our drinks were nice).

All in all we were really happy with the food and had a great time.  Four stars is reflective of an overall positive food experience with a few minor misses and a server focused on upselling our order while being MIA for large parts of our meal.  We were actually going to order dessert but it took her so long to swing back around, our companions needed to head out and so we just asked for the check.  I'm also surprised they start off your meal with slices of white bread.  Random.  It was dry and we skipped it completely.  I think a cute amuse bouche would go better with their menu and keep appetites intact for the good stuff."}, {"review_id": "68O-XKMYcZNWujM4jJsDPA", "user_id": "H7B2_k6AcPI3i7JT0uHsbA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Hands down favorite restaurant in Charlotte.

Definitely a great date place, with a little bit of a laid back setting. Open brick walls and Waitress told me about 3 items which have been on the menu since the restaurant opened. (Pei mussels, steamed Bun, and Garnelli), then gave me a little time to decide. Wow even the bread amazed me here!!!! Crispy crust, and warm and soft innards.PEI (Prince Edward Island) mussels $12 - 15 small /mussels with green curry sauce and a pita. The curry sauce is amazing and I've seen people dip all kinds of things in it including the pomme fries, the bread , the rice from the Korean BBQ. Sadly the mussels were a little underwhelming. And definitely on the small side. I do love the idea of mussels and green curry sauce though and this is a must have.Pomme Frites  $6 MUST HAVE - Holy Moly Guacamole! The fries are heavily seasoned so if you dont like heavily seasoned fries these aren't for you. Each bite of the fries is super salty and when dipped in the above curry, you get an unique taste.Korean Beef with Rice $12 - This was probably the worst of the three tapas I got. Three different types of sauces, a small portion of fried rice, and a small portion of fried ribs. Ribs were soft and tender, but you can get better short ribs elsewhere.Chocolate Cookie icecream cookie $7 MUST HAVE - This was by far the best icecream sandwich ever. Two white chocolate macadamia nut cookies with cajeta icecream (Mexican Caramel icecream) sandwiched in between the cookies. Then they dip the entire side of the cookie with white chocolate and macadamia nuts. They gave me a knife and a spoon to cut the icecream, but it was difficult and I suggest just getting one just for yourself. THIS ICE CREAM MADE THIS REVIEW 5 STARS!Overall a great restaurant, with quaint decorations and country music. I would come again."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/good-food-on-montford-charlotte-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
