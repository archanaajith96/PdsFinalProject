I had tried it once when they first opened and chose something rather adventurous for a first Pho meal. This time I ordered off his recommendation and was very pleased. He had one of the chicken stock based bowls and I went with a beef broth base. Both were delicious. The place isn't too big and got very busy after we arrived on a workday lunch break. Don't expect to be in and out quickly. He tells me an hour is to be expected. I went with the large bowl but I think the small would've been fine. I'll definitely be going back."}, {"review_id": "bF_QKrjQm36USh_MY6KAVg", "user_id": "BkqX3ZpN3tevatrnQYXTwg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/22/2017", "text": "When we entered there were only two clean tables. Out of all the tables about 11 tables have not been cleared. We assumed the waiter was busy, however there were only two tables occupied at the time. The waiter was nice, but it looked like he just didn't want to clean the tables because during our stay he just stood around. The food:Banh xeo - the flavor was good but the consistency was off. I'm used to crispy and crunchy banh xeo. Theirs was soggy.Bun bo hue - the best I've had outside of my parents cooking! The flavor was on point. Although, I wish they added pork hock.Pho - the broth was good and savory.Overall, I would recommend this place. The food was pretty authentic. I hope they can figure out the cleanliness issues though."}, {"review_id": "gTTUaheK_O-hhGkBAs9aew", "user_id": "Ca0c3rYntB3Ew9RFGTBKEA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "One of the better Pho I've had. Located in a strip mall with ample parking. I ordered the Pho Dac Biet or Special - large. It came out piping hot, tons of noodles and a very generous assortment of meats. I wasn't accustom to this because most Vietnamese restaurants are cheap on their meat portions. The broth was flavorful. The only complaint was the bean sprouts were not fresh but I brought this to the server's attention and he replaced it."}, {"review_id": "595BOrqJuewy-FO3bopgLQ", "user_id": "HlsZxgN8LR6h16F1le59Kw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "This was a new experience for me but I'm sold.  The food was very tasty and filling.  The ambiance was cozy and comfortable.  One downfall.....the service was slow.  I had the chicken broth with shrimp, calamari and fish balls.  Wasn't sure about the fish balls when I ordered but I now wish there were more in the broth.  Everything was delicious and filling without being heavy.  Definately will be going back to try more"}, {"review_id": "pbeGHCnccKQtvU6rfOMIPg", "user_id": "71j1MrhH8bfXNTKg1ZtUKQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Found this place on Yelp when I was in town for a business trip.

There was a time when there was no pho in iowa city. Many years ago the land was afflicted with his famine. In those times, there was an oasis in the desert, this place, pho mai. I have fond memories of making the drive out here from Iowa City to get my fix for pho. Since then numerous joints have cropped up in iowa city. Eating here today it's still pretty darn good. The meat is incredibly tender and the portions more than appropriate. Service can be slow if busy but definitely passable. They have beer and bubble tea and various other dishes I have not tried yet as I always go for the pho. A solid place and my usual spot if I go to the airport."}, {"review_id": "QK_KscA-PGCR3deMAf9yiQ", "user_id": "TOYQdLr5gXTV-0v9Ds-R2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/12/2017", "text": "I louvve this place. Love their chicken pho, tofu pho. Their regular size portion is also super generous, I get it to-go'd all the time. Their bubble tea is also good, but i have had better before. What I like about this place is a huge selection for vegan & vegetarian people. They have a separate menu. My wife is a vegan loves their selection. Great flavor, great presentation of their food, all the time. During lunch hour this place is super busy. Do watch for a huge wait. Dinners are good and easily accessible.

That's right, the best bun bo hue in the US can be found in Cedar frickin' Rapids, Iowa. Trust me, I know what you're thinking. \"This guy is full of it!\" Well, I don't blame you. It took me a while to accept it too. In fact, I couldn't believe it the first time and figured it was a fluke or maybe I was having an off day or something. So I went back...three more times! And then I brought three other soup experts, two of which were also Vietnamese, and ask for their opinions. The results were conclusive and the decision unanimous: Pho Mai has the best bun bo hue any of us have ever had outside of Vietnam.If you come here you must try the bun bo hue. It's the real deal. Skip the Pho. It's good but pales in comparison to the bun bo hue.I know their name is \"Pho Mai\" but it really should be \"Bun Bo Hue Mai\"."}, {"review_id": "rOojZj23sGIfIfWsdUwz-Q", "user_id": "kGb7j5-f4Hm6e-Bf1HM6NQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "I want to rate this place 4-5 stars based on its great tasting food but the service is just abysmal. They need to hire more servers and work on teaching their staff to touch more than one table at a time. I didn't write this review after one visit. In fact my family and I have frequented this establishment a multitude of times over the last couple years and every single time we had slow service. Even though this was expected we hoped  over and over again maybe we just had an off experience. Often we didn't get water or a drink till after we got food. So to boil it down... if you don't mind sitting and waiting for long periods of time before you get to order or even after than this place has really good food. I really hope the owners read this and understand they need to make some changes. Unfortunately, we're not giving it anymore chances."}, {"review_id": "D-XU4H9TrZaeYqQMM8KIXA", "user_id": "lypig3BfUk3nY18oeDvJ4w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "I always get number 50 and 13 on the menu and they have never disappointed me.

It was sorely lacking and left me wanting good pho. Today the only Vietnamese restaurant open was Mai Pho, so we gave it a try and were happy we did. We had fried dumplings, very tasty, for an appetizer. I got the #13 pho and my husband got the #23. The broth was flavorful and satisfying, so delicious. I'm meat eater so I don't always pay attention to vegetarian/vegan options but I happened to notice the pho is made with beef broth according to the menu. So if you aren't a meat eater there maybe more questions to ask here. The customer service was excellent, drinks and check were provided in a timely manner. I would recommend giving this restaurant a try if you're in Cedar Rapids, and skip \"I love Pho\" in Coralville."}, {"review_id": "B4mofe_chiWGaQSJYl6J1A", "user_id": "aYPdb9HL8LqKS6xpUOkAWQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "7/18/2017", "text": "I had heard nothing but great things about Pho Mai and their delicious cuisine. I had never had Pho or any other Vietnamese food before but I'm fairly adventurous with different food and enjoy trying something new or different. I was so excited to head over to this location and try my first bowl of Pho -- and now I'm excited that I'll never try it again. I understand and respect everyone that loves this place, but it just wasn't for me. The dish itself reminded of something I'd get at some cheap Chinese buffet in the way that everything was just same-tasting. There was an overwhelming amount of lemongrass and it overpowered all the other flavor I'm assuming was present. I'm sure it's the way Pho is supposed to be, but I also was not digging the pale boiled and gray meat floating around. It was so unappetizing. I may as well been eating a bowl full of lemon pledge and that's exactly what I wanted to do at the time. There were three other people in my party and I wasn't alone in my distaste for the food. Three of the four of us got various kinds of Pho and none of us even came close to finishing and when we were asked if we wanted to go containers -- we quickly and politely declined. Service wasn't terrible but not great. Prices were nothing to complain about and it's a nice little place with a solid atmosphere. I'm only so disappointed because I was so excited and had high expectations. Will I be back?Oh Mai, Pho-ck no."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-mai-restaurant-cedar-rapids?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
