Trust me, it's worth the wait. I always love traveling to New Mexico and having a Southwestern style breakfast in the morning BUT with Juan's I don't even have to leave Norman. It really is a  slice of Santa Fe in the heart of Oklahoma. Food Tip: If you are hungry make sure and try the tamales and eggs or enchiladas and eggs. They are fantastic."}, {"review_id": "nyYjyGabXSR4nEi7t1DJcQ", "user_id": "PLQJbLO7G0mSJz7uV1BtJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Passing through town and let some friends for breakfast.

Norman has its own hidden and perfect tex-mex/american breakfast blend restaurant. You may think of Cafe Antigua or Cafe Kacao as somewhat similar options in OKC. The owner, Juan, was apparently previously the cook at The Diner on Main St. I sat at the bar and had the huevos rancheros after checking out some Yelp pics (even though I'm usually not a fan of huevos rancheros) and I was pleasantly surprised. Juan del Fuego really knows how to balance the best of tex-mex and American breakfast staples. I also tried the the pork tamales and was very impressed, perfect flavor and it's not overly salty or saucy. I could tell by looking at other dishes that they don't overwhelm you with the salsa/sauces. The value at this place is spectacular, the service is attentive and friendly, the place itself is small but comfy and has a community type feel, and they have nice all you can drink pot coffee. Tip: Sit at the bar and watch all of the food preparation via the open kitchen (which is always a nice touch). I will definitely revisit Juan del Fuego sometime soon!"}, {"review_id": "2Qmm2po9-WGGbq4vgtSbPQ", "user_id": "c6m6LbFq-mw20BIbtlvuiA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "So good!

After waiting 40 minutes to be seated, we were placed in a corner booth with a strobe light effect due to the fan/light arrangement. We were excited to finally find out why the wait featured long lines out the door and hungry looking customers eager to partake in the newest trend. Thirty more minutes later, the food arrived. Hash browns are stapled to an excellent breakfast, and this place had greeted me with over crisped disappointment. However, the cheese enchiladas and eggs were much better yet nothing to be gushing about. I will say, my SO devoured his plate. His meal of tamales and eggs was 5 stars compared to my 2 star plate. So, perhaps I had just ordered wrong. The service was common for a high capacity restaurant. I would suggest hiring at least one more server to handle the flow of people. Other than that, it wasn't too bad, but definitely not as expected."}, {"review_id": "2zJrm0YXWwj-ycFBtXh3IQ", "user_id": "RObwLPbOlpYnW5H-P70TzA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/10/2017", "text": "Good food but the flavor is flooded with potato taste.

Decided to give it a try after reading some reviews and I was definitely not disappointed. My girlfriend and I sat at the bar and just watched them cook. The cooks are very efficient at what they do and take so much care for each plate. They are a well oiled machine. The food was unbelievably good. I had the breakfast scramble with the sausage, and my gf had the breakfast scramble with the chorizo. I would go with the chorizo next time though. I read people commenting on the coffee, but I saw a few containers of folger's, breakfast blend, back near the maker. That folger's is my jam, but I wouldn't brag about how good their coffee is.The cooks work for tip also, but you have to give cash at the register. I didn't know that, but next time I will save some cash for them, because they were awesome. I would highly recommend this place to anybody looking for some great brunch."}, {"review_id": "pI_-XmiZcHxrDBTBbMGlMA", "user_id": "tzN7-iZbzDZMG_CF4wTy7g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/4/2017", "text": "I've never been much on waiting in line, so when my wife and I first drove by and saw people standing outside, I passed.

Brunch is a weekend ritual for me, so I don't waste my time or taste buds with anything less than delicious. If you're familiar with The Diner, you'll notice some familiarity with the menu. Why you ask? Juan is the genius behind all of it. He originally worked as a cook at the Diner for awhile & then opened up his own Mexi-Diner joint. The dishes are primarily \"santa-fe style\" with selections of juevos rancheros, enchiladas, roasted poblano burgers, chorizo scrambled eggs etc. For those that are looking for a breakfast classic, they do have your basics like pancakes, scrambled eggs, biscuits & gravy etc. Every single thing I've had here is absolutely delicious, but my go-to is the papas con chorizo. There's a brief moment of heaven when you take the first bite. It's scrambled eggs with roasted fuego potatoes & chorizo/cheese. It's definitely on my top 5 meals to have if I somehow found out I had a short amount of time to live (is that weird?) My other half gets the juevos rancheros every time & it never disappoints. Pair that with a cup of their tasty coffee & you've got a recipe for an awesome brunch experience. I'm pretty sure it's the same coffee that they use at the Diner (Cain's Coffee) The price points on all of the menu items are very reasonable (under $10 for most plates) and they waiters/waitresses are all delightful. Just like any other popular brunch spot, expect a steep wait time if you're coming during peak hours. Wait times can range anywhere from 15-60 min, but I assure you- it's totally worth it. You can hang outside while you wait because the waiting area inside is tiny & the entrance always gets blocked with people crowding around the door. That's the only negative thing here. Bring a book, relax & get yourself ready for some good stuff. If you're lucky, you might run into Mr. Barry Switzer!"}, {"review_id": "7EE3zzPlQ6DIKSyZ9ehyyg", "user_id": "KYPkE_uKfSdrHR1cTT8wlQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/27/2016", "text": "This guy was the cook at the Diner on downtown Main St. before that TV guy came to give it a makeover and turned it into an Applebees.
