From the antipasto to the wine selection, everything sings of its painstakingly plucked origins in the south of Italy. Umberto, the owner in concert with his wife, is a charming guy with a boatload of charisma and a knack for finding just the thing to delight the palate.He and his wife, the accomplished chef-ess, were kind enough to prepare an entirely separate set of dishes when they found out that my dinner companion had a low tolerance for spice.The pricing is quite reasonable considering the quality and quantity of food present in the five course, no-menu meal. As the dishes offered vary by night, my impression of the specific dishes we ate will do little for the Yelper in-the-know, but I can say with a degree of authority and conviction (having been a student at Johnson & Wales and a tourist in southern Italy) that everything from the sauces to the salumi to the vino is as authentic and heartfelt as it is enticing.The restaurant is usually booked at least a week or two in advance, especially for Friday and Saturday nights, so make sure to call ahead. Don't miss this establishment. The best Italian food on the hill, perhaps in the state."}, {"review_id": "t7N5f3SDkfHMYjSWar4nuQ", "user_id": "_yPOCOmR2uArSn8c_OC60w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Best restaurant in Rhode Island.

This being our first time we really didn't see how that works but it was worth the go. At the end the bill was pretty pricey $100 for 2 people. That was without alcohol. I can only imagine how much if would cost with the hand selected imported wine.Also, expect to sit uncomfortably close to people due to it being such a small space. So if you're claustrophobic or just don't like being around people that much, this is not the place for you. Pro: everything was delicious! We left overly stuffed! The owner, the main server, was super friendly and straight from Sicily. The place reminded me of the small family run places in Italy when we visited. We started with a large mozerella ball with a glaze, then assorted cheeses and meat, a delicious chickpea and pasta dish, then some kind of pork in a sauce.

Definitely the best food that I can recall. Not much ambiance to this small restaurant with a handful of tables but that's part of it's charm because it's like you're visiting a relative's kitchen (except YOUR relatives never cooked so well).As we were seated Umberto advised that there was no menu and checked with the table for food allergies or like my daughter, a vegetarian. After that he just fed us one spectacular course after the next. The homemade Mozzarella was absolutely to die for. Awesome!My family is from Reggio Calabria, and Italian culture has always centered around the table, but Unberto has elevated it to an art form. Umberto selected a Sicilian wine for us based upon our stated preferences that was the perfect accompaniment and at $54/bottle offered great price/value.Enoteca Umberto could fill a hundred tables/night but there is no way to scale this formula without diminishing the essential experience. Not inexpensive, but 'nice costs' and everything here is of the absolute best quality.

If you love southern Italian food you will love this place. Let me just say if you're looking for melas like chicken Parmesan, veal Parmesan, and loads of other Italian favorites you might be disappointed. Enoteca has a relatively smaller menu because the meals are meant to be \"family style\" as told by our waiter. Thus meaning what's yours is mine and what's mine is yours. Everyone is sharing, even if you got a cold. We were informed that the way to go with his place is just let the chef give you whatever they want and you sit back and enjoy the good eats. There is a new daily menu everyday written in Italian so make sure to pay attention when the waiter is speaking if you do not speak Italian. The plates are also somewhat smaller, but you get so filled up on cheese, meats, bruschetta, and all the other appeteasers you are almost stuffed before the meal comes. The staff is lively, loud, and fun it's like you're in someone's kitchen at their house. The place is small and quaint so bring a small group and make reservations way in advance. Also the music is bumping like break the knob off loud! I kinda loved it, but I can see other people getting annoyed by having to speak up a lot and listen attentively. The food is amazing. The wine is delicious.

Actually probably the only \"authentic\" Southern Italian restaurant on Atwells. If you're coming to Federal Hill for dinner don't waste your time with 90% of the crap passing itself off as Italian food on Atwells and go straight to Enoteca Umberto (although there are definitely a few other halfway decent American-Italian places on Atwells). The only problem is that the restaurant space is really small - you definitely need to make reservations because there are only a handful of tables (although in the summer they have outdoor tables which are really nice). The small space is sort of a blessing and a curse though because with so few it allows for a single chef to maintain strict quality control standards (it's sort of like the breakfast place Kitchen in this regard).One of the best aspects of their food is the high quality ingredients they use - they get fresh mozzarella from their family who runs a dairy in Italy (I believe that is what the host/owner told us), amazing olive oil from Italy, etc. The pasta was absolutely amazing as was the fresh mozzarella and arugula appetizer. Service is amazing too as the host/owner seems to pay attention to every single table - telling you about the ingredients, helping with wine pairing, and making sure everything is up to their high standards. Wine was excellent albeit with a limited menu (which is actually kind of a good thing here as each bottle seems to have been carefully chosen - almost curated). Definitely highly recommended if you like \"real\" Southern Italian food prepared and served with lots of attention to detail, amazing ingredients and real passion - I can't wait until I come back for another visit."}, {"review_id": "OfgE0V0r38sVImBl_xCYeA", "user_id": "Z2vQ0llkjuQ-HizZWU_EYQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/25/2017", "text": "My time at Enoteca was like an experience in Italy. Umberto speaks mostly in Italian to his wife and staff and it's actually very enjoyable and helpful to immerse you in what is the Italian culture. My friend had decided to let Umberto take care of us and we were quite hungry. We started with his families fresh imported bufala mozzarella and homemade tomato jam. Buttery, tender and extremely delicious. ($20)Once we were finished, Umberto brought over yet another tasty dish, a lentil soup with what I believe was toasted marcona almonds which added a little crunch to the soup. Oh, did I mention they didn't skimp on the olive oil? Yum! Since I avoid meat (and I wish I didn't) the staff at Enoteca accommodated my needs. They made a sweet and sour bruschetta with eggplant, onion, celery, and several other vegetables which I didn't think would be very good, atop a \"preserved\" piece of toast and it was of course delicious. It was kind of like dessert. We finished with the pasta Ceci ($14), some type of pasta with leeks?($14) I forget, and my friend had some type of braised/marinated chicken thigh atop polenta ($25) which he said was the best he's ever had. We also had 4 glasses of wine ($12/e) which definitely added up so just grab a bottle of you plan to drink, he imports his own choices from various regions of Italy and it was awesome.I don't think I'll eat like this often because it did come along with a hefty yet reasonable price tag, but I'll definitely be back for a more conservative meal.

My conclusion is that I do not feel that any review could do Enoteca Umberto's any justice. Went here with my husband, his brother, girlfriend and parents. The restaurant sits about 14-16 people and there is only one waiter, the owner, Umberto. His wife is the brains in the kitchen, while his less than 1 year old daughter makes an occasional appearance. The food is delicious, and the reviews speak to that. We tried so many things, it is hard to remember what we had. A lot of the food is hand picked by Umberto himself. Many of the ingredients coming directly from Italy. There is a special Rose wine we looove, which cannot be found anywhere else. It is very crisp and light. That night in December, the hubby decided on the spot that we shall return for Valentines Day, and he secretly got on a waiting list. We made the cut for V day and we were very excited! Although it was on a Tuesday, we were willing to go at any time just so that we could dine the special pre fixe V day menu. 9pm reservation was ok by us. Umberto remembered us from December, as he asked my husband how his father and brother were. The service is just beyond anything we have ever experienced. Umberto easily makes you feel at home, with his easy going personality and enthusiasm to have you dine at his restaurant. The 7 course V day dinner was a amazing! Everything from the burrata, to the orange and pickled onions to the poached pear dessert was, as expected, perfect! Umberto's consistently has a 2 month wait list, which is understandable and worth the wait!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/enoteca-umberto-providence-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
