Ordered the combo pho and they brought it out missing the meatballs. Told the waitress and she argued that I didn't order that. I know what I ordered bc that's  the only way I order pho. She said she can't change it bc it would throw the meat ratio out of balance???? The **** lol. The pho broth was basic, lacking the aroma and flavors of authentic pho. The meat portions were small. It was sliced super thick so it was hard. If you want basic tasteless pho with dry cuts of meat come here. If not, go somewhere else that knows how to actually cook Vietnamese food."}, {"review_id": "VnS9MZkF15Kc2zr2v6__5w", "user_id": "MLf4JUa1uzQkDLrBJ5yJHA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "A hidden gem of a Viet restaurant located in Sioux Falls. Came here to pick up some Viet food to go. Ordered a Summer Bowl & found the portions relatively large & generous. Food was fresh, great to taste, and indeed was well worth it. It's also nice to see that this place also offers Banh Mi's (equivalent of Viet hoagies) and pho. Did take a peek into others' bowls as I waited for my order and it definitely looked pretty good. Decent amount of seating available at this joint so shouldn't be a problem if you bring a group here to dine. Definitely would try for the pho the next time I'm here ... which is something you should do, too, if you are into soup-based broth noodle bowls. Would recommend checking this place out. Also close to Falls Park (point of interest)!"}, {"review_id": "mOjiRRabsM8ZnvLUbZcPng", "user_id": "Dfdp2SQKbMg9JKA4OMqcZA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/28/2017", "text": "So tasty i can recommend here when it's cold weather.Noodle with soup was so good and hotI really liked here"}, {"review_id": "i3llH5Y9k8NolJypIZ_Vdw", "user_id": "9wfFBzEf-kikxhUTVAgCog", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/14/2017", "text": "Yelpers say this is he pho spot so here we are to give it a try.

On our last day in Sioux Falls, my family and I ate so much the whole weekend that we sought something lighter. Lam's was the answer.To start, the Egg Rolls tasted yummy and fresh while the Fried Tofu was surprisingly light and delicate with a thin, crunchy \"skin\". I ordered a small Combo Pho of chuck roast, beef balls, and rare eye round. The pho broth was amazing and even more so with the addition of bean sprouts, lime juice, and mint leaves. The quality of these motivated us to order a Meat Bun and Banh Mi sandwiches stuffed with beef balls, pickled papaya, jalapeno, cilantro, and more to take with us on our trip back to New Jersey. We whipped them out on the plane from Sioux Falls to O'Hare and boy, was everyone else jealous. While the bread could have used a little toasting, they smelled and tasted sooo good."}, {"review_id": "0qERiyAYionqFKeuwvpbXw", "user_id": "Sp23h2re2YaK5qYmSFL8aA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/27/2017", "text": "I've been to this place a couple of times and they really cook pho to my taste.

My family doesn't put sugar or sweetener in our broth, and unfortunately a lot of these places so, which is okay because it's a Southern VN thing. it's just not what I'm used to, so I'm happy to find Lam. they close on Monday though, and somehow I always end up there on Monday lol"}, {"review_id": "kIA-lcvUnQj-LLRObm4abw", "user_id": "IBQx7EkXXXooTiaSFZ7DyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/8/2017", "text": "Best pho in town.

It's obviously not freshly cooked, smells like burnt, and it's quickly getting cooled. I feel it was microwaved or leftover something... I got to stop picturing... overall bad service and bad food!

They open at 11am and have a really nice clean space. There is private parking out front and the service is spot on! The only thing I'll mention is that I didn't see chicken phò on the menu. I think it's only beef and you can add shrimp for 2$. It might be possible to ask them to do a chicken phò but it doesn't seem to be offered standard. Oh they also don't have hoisen sauce at the tables. Maybe that's important to you but they have little packets they can bring to you if you want.
