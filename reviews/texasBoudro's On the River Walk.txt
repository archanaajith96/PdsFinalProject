Make sure you make a reservation, since there is a long wait for tables. We actually made our reservation for 9pm, but that worked out since we had a late lunch (and it was St. Patty's day). Our server was fun, enthusiastic and friendly, and seated us right next to the river, so we could enjoy the ambiance better. I would recommend this, even with the large number of people walking past you.I got the Gulf Shellfish platter, which included: Seared bay scallop with chimichurri, blue crab seacake and grilled shrimp with beurre blanc, lobster tail baked with cognac and jack cheese, fried oysters remoulade, Louisiana crawfish pot pie served with jalapeno corn pudding on a bed of Southern braised greens. I also had the strawberry Caipirinha. The caipirinha was delicious, sweet, full of strawberries and still packed quite a punch. The platter's components were all bursting with flavor and were generally perfectly cooked. The scallops were tender, a bit salty and smoky, the seacake was like a more dense crabcake, the grilled shrimp were creamy, the lobster tail was rich and indulgent, the fried oysters were crispy on the outside and piping hot and soft on the inside (with the burst of sea salt taste) and the pot pie was like comfort food. Needless to say, I nearly passed out afterwards with how much food I had eaten, and I was very thankful that our hotel was walking distance. The walk certainly helped with the digestion!Overall, easily the best restaurant on the riverwalk, be sure to stop in."}, {"review_id": "MSOJw4yTVIRX0wWU5CiGQw", "user_id": "CcHpY5DA-lpOBm61hkN9-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Shrimps and grits!

They make some of the best guacamole I've had.The Riverwalk has plenty of restaurants and bars to choose from. They range from mediocre, to decent, to very good. Boudro's is one of the better choices, and one that is suitable for a casual meal to a business dinner. It doesn't try to be a touristy cheesy place, or a chain resto, or fratty party joint to lure people in. It's a nice place with a touch of class, and doesn't need to be anything else.You can't go wrong with the large portions of delicious food, and generous pours of liquor in their cocktails. Try a Prickly Pear Margarita or a Hurricane. Oh, and guac made tableside is always on point. A meal here isn't the cheapest, but it's worth the price if looking for a better meal experience. Balanced menu of seafood, steaks, chicken, along with a touch of Mexican flair. Not really a spot to bring the little ones, so pay a babysitter to watch the kids, and enjoy an adult night out.Excellent food, terrific service, wonderful atmosphere. When the Riverwalk is all lit up at night, and you're dining outside by the water, it's kind of magical. After all, the guacamole here does cast a spell on you. Or, perhaps it's those boozy Hurricanes? I'll take another!"}, {"review_id": "LrDoX07XeR2Z3GtCINeYAw", "user_id": "R5WcogaoAwjdHxrB2v5NsQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "They've still got it!Everything I mentioned two years back held true on my more recent visits.

The portions were Ginormous. The burger was done Perfectly and the fries were Amazing. My companions also enjoyed their meals immensely. None of us were able to finish our meals and ended up taking half for later. We ended our Boudro's experience with the Double Chocolate Brownie and I have No regrets. It was, in one word, sumptuous.

DO YOU!? I found myself in the unfortunate predicament as I was walking around the Riverwalk one balmy afternoon, in need of a snack and drink pick-me-up. My friend wasn't meeting me for another hour, but there was absolutely no way I was going to be stuck in the hotel by myself. As I walked around, all I could find were Chili's and Chuy's knockoffs with the god-awful amateur mariachi bands. I couldn't find a decent spot on Yelp, but I finally scrolled down to see Boudro's.Boudro's is actually semi-difficult to find. Many of the restaurants lining the river have the same type of outdoor seating setup, so there's no way to differentiate between them. Many of the places have obnoxious, colorful signs and gimmicks to get people into the restaurant, but Boudro's does not follow that trend. They have a tiny wooden sign hanging above their entrance that's nearly impossible to see unless you're right next to it. I found this to be a good sign, as it meant in my head that they didn't need all the flashy extras to attract people in. I was able to be seated promptly outside on the river as it was an off period (3:30pm). I had stayed for over three hours and watched the patio and riverseats fill up.While I waited for my friend, I ordered a hurricane and guacamole. The guac said it was built for two, but as my server assured me, anyone with an appetite could finish it by themselves. They make it tableside, with the option of adding red pepper flakes to make it spicy. I was apprehensive about adding oranges to the guac, but the citrus was a nice backdrop to the avocado. I also thoroughly enjoyed the hurricane. I'm more of a beer drinker, but hurricanes are great in that there's an alarmingly large amount of alcohol but it still tastes like fruit punch. It was a $9 cocktail, but I only needed about 3 before really reeeeally feeling it.When my friend arrived, I started raving about the guacamole so much we ordered another one. As we munched (and drank hurricane after hurricane), we decided that actually ordering real dinner may be important. A problem with Boudro's menu is that it's not vegetarian friendly. My friend is a trooper in that many restaurants in the state of Texas don't cater to her lifestyle, but she still made Austin her home. Anywho, I ordered the shrimp enchiladas while she stuck with black bean soup and mashed potatoes (filling?). The food take awhile to come out. We didn't mind, as we had quite a few drinks, and we were enjoying the atmosphere. Normally, I would have minded as it took near 45 minutes to get our entrees. The restaurant is huge on the inside and the patio seating is on the larger side as well, so I could understand the wait time. I assume either everyone was as relaxed as I was thanks to many hurricanes, or they're just used to the wait, because I didn't see anyone inside or outside complaining.When the food finally arrived, it was...meh. We both found our items to be bland, which was disappointing considering how delicious our appetizers and drinks were. The shrimp enchiladas were filled unevenly, so there were bites that had nothing but tortilla, and other bites with an unseasoned shrimp. The beans and rice were typical of a tex-mex restaurant. The black bean soup was an absolute disservice to black beans. It looked pretty, but did not have a speck of seasoning in it. Considering the time we had there, it was a sad ending to what could have been amazing. Also, the prices for everything were tourist inflated. It was a bummer I paid nearly $30 for an underwhelming entree.Overall, I'll still give this place 4 stars. The ambiance and environment can't be beat, and considering what my other options were, it was still a solid choice on the river. Perhaps I'll venture outside the river area if I want a full meal, but if I come back again, I will certainly have a drink and some guac."}, {"review_id": "eEwydhG40_ym85tTtClUEA", "user_id": "JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Had a really good dinner on a Sunday night at Boudro's.  It was the last day of Texas spring break, and the Riverwalk (really all of downtown) was packed.  We thought ahead and made reservations.  A party that arrived after us did not have was quoted a 90 minute wait.  So, if you are eating on a busy weekend, take advantage of Open Table or Yelp and make a reservation.  It's free and you will be glad you did.The weather was great and we decided to sit on the Riverwalk.  It was very energetic, but not so much so that we had trouble talking or hearing one another.  I had two (2) of Boudro's signature cocktails:  the Prickly Pear Margarita and the Strawberry Caipirinha.  Both were fresh and made with real fruit (or at least, it tasted real).  My preference was the margarita, it had a slight different flavor that I enjoyed.  I am generally not huge on sugary drinks, but these were both good.To start we had the famous guacamole.  It lives up to its name. We got it mild because my 7 year old son was with us, so it did not have much of a kick to it.  But, it was seasoned well and the ingredients were all fresh.I went with the gulf shellfish platter for dinner.  This thing is enormous, easily shareable.  My favorite items were the grilled shrimp and fried oysters.  The crawfish pie was good too, but lacking in meat.  It was mostly gravy and veggies and needed pepper.  The scallop was fine and the seacake was the only miss on the plate.  I doubt I would order this again but I do not regret trying it.My mother had the blackened prime rib, which was the runaway winner of the \"Best Thing we Ate at Boudro's\" Award.  It was seasoned very well and had enough heat and pepper to make you taste it but not so much it burned.  It was cooked to a perfect medium rare but had a bit of a sear.  The potatoes and veggies were good, but the prime rib was the clear star.  I will have a hard time not ordering this on a return trip.Our server was great throughout.  Even though we were busy we did not have to wait on water refills or the check.  Also, the food came out timely but we never felt rushed.Boudro's may be located on the Riverwalk and thus qualifies as a tourist trap.  But, it is not without its charm and the food was certainly good.  I will return."}, {"review_id": "lNGR0CxFGhyFKkWoAYMBrw", "user_id": "5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "If you are looking to Treat Yo Self . . . You want to go here.  It is a higher priced restaurant but worth EVERY penny.  We had to wait almost half an hour on a week night to eat inside.  It's right on the Riverwalk so most people want to eat outside.  We were starving and just wanted to eat.  Marco was our waiter and he gives 5 star service.  We asked to start our meal with the guacamole that is made table side.  All of the ingredients are fresh and beautiful.  You can ask for items to be left in or extra items.  It is truly made to order.  I asked for no Serrano peppers and Marco accommodated that request.  (Meanwhile the gentleman at the next table asked for two extra servings of the peppers.  Holy Hotness!!) They use fresh squeezed oranges in their guacamole which really adds to the flavor.  The guacamole is supposed to be for two but I'm not going to lie.  I barely let my husband have any.  For dinner my husband ordered the Chicken with Rosemary and I ordered the Seafood platter.  His chicken came out looking divine.  It was served over thinly sliced potatoes with a brown sauce.  The chicken was very juicy and potatoes were perfect with the sauce.  I was glad I tried it.  I almost ordered it myself.  It's a good thing we like to share (except for guacamole and then it's every man for himself).  My seafood platter was loaded with seafood.  There was a lobster tail that was stuffed with the lobster that had been removed and tossed in a creamy and spicy sauce.  It was a bit too spicy for me so my husband ate most of it.  There were two huge scallops that were cooked perfectly.  The oysters were fried but lightly.  I am not an oyster fan so my husband got those as well. The blue crab cake was the best crab cake I have ever had.  It was small but packed with flavor.  The crust on the Crawfish pot pie was light, airy, and buttery.  The inside was could have been a bit thicker but was still good with the peas and the bites of crawfish.  The greens were good and my hubby ate the jalapeño corn pudding.  Needless to say we cleaned our plates.  We were stuffed but I really wanted to try the Key Lime dessert.  I ordered it to go.  I put it in our fridge in our hotel room and didn't eat it until 3 days later and oh my was it good!!!!  The texture was a bit more firm than the typical Key Lime pie, but it think it held in all of the flavor.  If you are a key lime fan then you need to try this dessert.  This was definitely our favorite meal of our trip."}, {"review_id": "am9kmxtgo9xJrjk0azF0ZQ", "user_id": "82dCHyU-ANOgdhxUgZsUeg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Boudro's is a delicious restaurant and probably the best spot on the San Antonio Riverwalk!

The food at Boudro's is the real deal. I would eat at this place even if it was in the middle of nowhere and had views of dead grass as far as the eyes can see on all sides. The fact that it is on the River Walk and has outdoor seating by the river just makes it truly exceptional.My wife and I were visiting Austin last month and we decided to head down to San Antonio for a day and check out a few spots around the city. We were walking on the River Walk around 1 pm and decided to stop somewhere for lunch. My wife's primary criterion for choosing is restaurant was that we had to be able to get a table by the river. Luckily, we saw a table open up at Boudro's when we walked by the restaurant. We asked the host if we could sit at that table and he said yes. Upon taking our seats and spending some time admiring the view, we started looking at the menu. Many dishes looked enticing, but we ended up choosing the duck and sausage gumbo, the Texas tapas plate, and Boudro's burger. The duck and sausage gumbo was phenomenal! The duck was rich, smoky, and incredibly tender. The piquant gumbo had a pleasant amount of heat and a great depth of flavor. When we visited New Orleans a few years ago, we had gumbo at several places. I realize it may be blasphemous to say this, but Boudro's gumbo was even better than what we had in New Orleans. The Texas tapas were just as impressive. The plate had more of the duck from the gumbo as well as barbecue sausage and al pastor pork. All they needed was some brisket and it would have been the ideal Texas meat plate. The pickled vegetables were flavorful, and even the corn pudding was great. Although the portions were not Texas-sized, every part of this dish was very satisfying.The burger was excellent too! It was juicy and perfectly seasoned. We couldn't get enough of the fire fries.Our service was outstanding and the atmosphere was lively. If you are looking for a non-tourist trap restaurant on the River Walk, Boudro's is the place to go."}, {"review_id": "_4T6YBshmfA5fB9Kz0mNIA", "user_id": "EPK4_bIsyVlrlsLH3RClEQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "After enjoying quesadilla appetizers from Boudro's one evening during our trip, we decided to return the following day for lunch.

The chunky avocado pieces were mixed with lime juice, orange juice, onions, cilantro, and smokey tomatoes which added a wonderful and unique flavor. Serrano peppers also gave it a nice kick that hit the tongue just after you finished eating.The blue crab tostada was full of crab meat and topped with jack cheese. It was surrounded by greens and avocado. This looked and tasted good but what I heard was even better was the empanada langosta, which was served with two lobster tails and a cheese empanada. For dessert, we ordered the top five offerings, according to our waiter, and we split them. We enjoyed their coconut flan, double chocolate brownie, Louisiana bread pudding, lime chess pie, and crispy tortilla fan. It was all really good but the standout would be the brownie and the lime chess pie won for creativity.Service was good, even during a busy weekend lunch hour.

We sat on the Riverwalk near the hostess station when an elderly couple told the hostess they would need to give up their table inside and leave because the noise was too loud (it was extremely noisy inside). Rather than let the couple leave, the hostess apologized and asked if she could treat them each to a glass of champagne before they left. The couple agreed, and while they drank their champagne the hostess found a manager who eventually located them a table. This kind of service matters, and you just don't see attention like this anymore. Truly amazing.And so was our experience. The tableside guacamole was outstanding. A squeeze of fresh orange gives it a really unique flavor. We split a Caesar salad which was excellent. The red pepper gives it a great taste.

He explained not only the specials, but expertly described any dish we asked about. He was attentive without being overbearing and perfectly timed refilling our drinks. We started with the table side guacamole. They make it with house roasted serrano Chili's and we all agreed that it was some of the best guacamole we've ever had. As a note, the menu says it is $11 for two. As there were six of us, Joey made enough for all of us to enjoy, and we were all billed for \"half\" of the guacamole ($5.50).I had a mixed tapas plate for my lunch. It included some sliced sausage with a BBQ spicy sauce, some duck, and pork al pastor. The flavors were really good, I just wished I had eaten the pork before the sausage, as the BBQ sauce was really spicy. My duck was a tiny but gamey, but I still enjoyed it.One of my friends had the dinner ribeye. They hand slice the beef on site and you have the option of two different preparations. My friend had the steak grilled over an open flame. It was  beautiful and my friend thoroughly enjoyed it!Another friend had the Empanada for lunch. It was served with a lobster tail.
