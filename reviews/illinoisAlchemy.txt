Especially during happy hour since i LOVE BEER and it's half off everyday from 330pm-6pm. 36 beers on draft to pick from. A ton of nice IPAS, ambers lagers and  stouts to pick from. They always rotate them and update the beer menu each Friday.I Attended a wine tasting dinner last night. 5 different Pinot noirs and dishes from around the world.$99 all inclusive and worth every dollar! They always have a great presentation. Christian the manager is always making sure to keep things up to date fun and make sure everyone is happy. He answers any questions about the wine and is very knowledgeable.Love that they offer cool events to attend. From wine tastings to bourbon tastings and they also have a murder mystery dinner coming up at the end of the month. I'm planning on taking off work and joining  since these events are always fun and different.Was a guest for a pappy van winkle bourbon tasting dinner a couple of months ago! Excellent!!!! The food they make for these dinners are scrumptious!My top favorite thing to eat here is a kale basil ceasar salad. I usually add seared ahi tuna for only $6 more. You can also pick chicken for only $2 the filet is about $7 to add on a salad and shrimp for $6 You can pick two different sizes for each salad they offer.And of coarse the pizzas  and pastas are homemade! And a wood burning oven for the pizzas!!There's a pasty chef in house everyday making fresh desserts!!! S'mores pizza!!!! Love that the food menu is updated each season as well as the hand crafted cocktails menu! An AMAZING cocktail which is my favorite there is called the fire brigade.I love spicy and this drink brings the heat!!!! It's made with smoked tequila, mezcal and other fresh ingredients. What makes it spicy is a firewater bitters they add to it. And garnished with a beautiful EDIBLE fresh orchid flower. I actually do bartend here for almost 4 years  and have to say I actually even like coming here to hang out on my days off. That's how much I love this place!  not only is it a great place to eat and drink but it really is a great to work! The owners are always there and make us feel like family. The manger Christian Benitez is great and always has events for us to attend and learn about our wines we offer!"}, {"review_id": "07k1YN3zDOREIRsoOYOSYQ", "user_id": "f6MZN0jj56VyqoAXzGGsIw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/20/2017", "text": "Alchemy is without a doubt my favorite restaurant in Rockford -arguably my favorite ever. If you had the chance to eat at Pearl in Rockford before it was sold, this is close in comparison, maybe better. Fun atmosphere, amazing food.My boyfriend had a burger and said that he was so impressed that he wouldn't have been surprised if it would have been double the price.I had a margarita pizza with the crunchy Brussels sprouts as an app. As someone who doesn't like Brussels sprouts, they were AMAZING. Highly recommend the creme brûlée cheesecake. It's special. 10/10 will return."}, {"review_id": "NF0Tj4yl6WVXVOwYZtTn8g", "user_id": "c3sEajuu_-K2tcY-K-kUXQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "High quality food and staff that cares how my experience really is.

The food was amazing! The service was also fantastic. They offer several options as far as venues for large or medium size receptions. Since my meal was paid for I cannot attest to the prices, although I would probably check out happy hour before committing to a full dinner. I would consider this on the higher end of restaurant food so don't come here on an Applebee's budget...this would be a place I expect to go on an anniversary or maybe for a wedding reception? I had fillet mignon with mashed potatoes and green beans.

We tried the \"Fun-guy\" which was perfectly savory, as was the \"pesto pie\" with wonderful flavors. It was recommended over the phone when I was ordering that I should try the buffalo shrimp, which were good, but absolutely 100% not worth the $14. The portion size was really small and not shareable. If you're passing through Rockford in your travels, this is a great spot to check out. Just don't expect good service.///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////edit: The shrimp tried to kill me. I should have known better when the pizza was served up piping hot and the shrimp required a blast in my hotel room's microwave to bring it up to temp.I woke up at 5am with the worst food poisoning I've ever had in my entire life. I won't go into details but let's just say it was a miserable way to travel. My wife didn't have any of the shrimp and she was fine today.Anyways, try the pizza but avoid the shrimp at all cost!"}, {"review_id": "b0H3cZgG0mPbMoFvlzqlhQ", "user_id": "bCyp5Q_RWxotESV1muP-cQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "Solid fancy pants dinner for NYE.

Walking in, we were greeted & seated right away. HAPPY HOUR . . gets you half off drafts & some well drinks. When I say drafts, I mean craft drafts. 10 oz. of deliciousness for about $2.50?! Yes please!Their menu is sick & it makes for a real tough decision when you're ordering so, we ate like we've never seen food before.Here's the rundown: Deviled eggs - You need to get these, they're not your average deviled eggs. Buffalo shrimp - perfect balance of creamy goodness & a little heat. You could literally lick the bowl clean when you're done. If the room was a little darker, I might have.  Mack with back - I don't even know what to say about this little gem. Mac and cheese, bacon, red onion & BBQ sauce. No further description needed. I'll just leave that there. If all of THAT wasn't enough, we decided to order The Forager. It was pretty good, I especially liked the peppered salami. We totally monopolized this guys table for a good hour and a half (maybe two. . I lost track after the third beer) while drinking & eating and he was totally okay with it. Not a big bill either. We will definitely be back. Next time we will make reservations if we go later, the place filled up quick!"}, {"review_id": "kJ3Xf7l_3U2fflhGyD_t2g", "user_id": "ySXMC4qzXJTcdOgphwEceQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/11/2017", "text": "Great menu, great atmosphere.

Steak was a bit over cooked but good along with the potatoes and asparagus.  Dessert....omg...this caused me 30 more minutes of  exercise this morning and that would even put a dent in it.

On top of that the sauce was gritty and didn't have enough curry in it.  The Nan bread was cold, not grilled and appeared to come right out the package from Walmart.Poor excuse for Italian and Indian food.  Over priced crappy food.

With that being said, the food is pretty decent. Although 14 dollars for an appetizer of shrimp is outrageous, the buffalo shrimp is definitely worth ordering; it has a kick, but provides flavour as opposed to just being hot. Think Frank's Red Hot sauce, not sriracha. The ahi tuna tacos are good, it's a thick and meaty portion seasoned with lime and heavy avocado in the taco shell. Again, I think a bit overpriced, but you're paying for the experience of saying you went to Alchemy. Order the homemade pop tart for yourself, they switch out the flavours so it's different each time that you come (if you can afford it). Alchemy draws a weird crowd, it can be men in Hawaiian shirts and cargo shorts or people dressed up in black tie. The staff is alright, albeit a little snooty. If you get the chance to have Buddy as your waiter, you're going to be treated like royalty."}, {"review_id": "XF2nkVAk7pnxQM01CoKAKA", "user_id": "XS-dOyAu3MgEF5K8IZ-usQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "I like the food and the atmosphere.
