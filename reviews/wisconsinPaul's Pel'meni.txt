You order at the counter and they bring it out to you. Menu is very simple but it's surprisingly amazing (beef and/or potato dumplings with different options for toppings). I prefer the mix (beef and potato) dumpling option, always loaded. Atmosphere is low-key but still downtown - so you can show up dressed as you are, and no one will care either way. Overall, recommend to anyone looking for a quick, cheap lunch Â that's not just another boring sandwich or burger."}, {"review_id": "JHx_J-CTyuAKPSGkwOObKw", "user_id": "0IknfAj4nG_JZ8JiGSCzUg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "This is the ultimate craving food.

Paul's is an interesting place for sure! Part dive bar ($3 shots of Jamo, Tully and Fireball always, drink specials every night), part Eastern European comfort food with a twist. We came to eat, not drink - but know that the back room is a simple bar space that doubles as a dining room. You place your order at the window. That part is easy because they got one thing - pelmeni. That thing comes in beef or potato varieties with a small at $4.50 and a large at $7. We ordered large sizes because we weren't sure and they are HUGE - definitely could have split a large or each had 1/2 size. You have your choice of butter, chili paste, curry and sour cream. We opted for just sour cream but found that the dumplings needed a bit of hot sauce.The guys working are super nice, it's dirt cheap for sure - I found myself wishing for a bit more flavor in the actual dumpling though. I'd like to come back and try the fully loaded version though!"}, {"review_id": "BqzWCj4c1FSD6kOantdgKA", "user_id": "mpA_MUVXL7gutzrOh7KdHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Still don't know how to pronounce it, but dang is this place good. We visited two days in a row after we tried it! It's tucked away on a side street of state and has this really cool \"hidden gem\" feel. The menu is incredibly simple. You can either get a half or a full order and either potato or meat dumplings . They are pretty small, about the size of a large grape. Both flavors are great and everything comes with a small container of sour cream. The flavor it with spices that were a little bit too much for me. We tried it just plain and added balsamic vinegar and oil that they have on the tables. That tasted good as well! They have a bar that stays open until one, but the dumplings are served late into the night. I'm so glad we finally tried this place and we will be return customers!"}, {"review_id": "lUeqPzbHdx8p9nBZN6-HaA", "user_id": "NUa3uTpX-sT4ylUVqaTz9w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "It's funny how all the photos are the same because they only serve one thing. Or two things because the pel'meni come with either beef or potato filling. Also I think they serve rye bread on request which technically constitutes a third thing. That's not a complaint at all. I like when establishments find what they're good at and stick to it. And Paul's seems to get plenty of traffic and have plenty of fans.Paul's was on my radar before I visited Madison but I dropped in because I was wandering down State St. and was looking for something to eat but wasn't starving. I also didn't have any cash. It's not like I couldn't have gotten some, but Paul's does take cards.The atmosphere is a little \"down and dirty\" but in a good way. You come in and order from the abbreviated menu. But there's a whole bar in the back where you can sit. I wasn't drinking, but there's a couple of \"Alaskan\" brews along with several other drafts and taps. (I've seen pel'meni advertised as \"Alaskan\" dumplings, though it seems they're of Russian/Siberian origin.) There were soccer and basketball on the TV, seemed to be a student crowd on a weekday afternoon (but I know how that can change.)I got a mix of the beef and potato pel'meni with \"the works.\" As some reviewers noted I also liked the beef ones best, but the potato ones added some variety. I saw the bottles of sriracha and what looked like vinegar. I should have been braver. But the chili sauce/butter/cilantro/curry combo they came with worked too. The pel'meni were good as a substantial snack and probably excel as drunk food too.Glad to see something a little unusual has a following."}, {"review_id": "xG2u-seEHPpWVtB7kN0l4w", "user_id": "Hi10sGSZNxQH3NLyWSZ1oA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "I played pool against the owner from here (Paul). I beat him, but good. Wiped the floor. Or the table, as it were. He then insulted me, my family, my country, my lack of religion, and then stayed mad at me all night. I guess you can conclude that Paul's a Pool-meanie.What to get: Mixed PelmeniAnd what do you call it if your dude goes all over your fingernails: Pearl-maniBilly Idol has been taken off the radio, btw. Not White Wedding or Rebel Yell, but they've decided to \"pull Mony.\"If you're cruising Madison for cute college students (and there are many), make sure you Paul over when you see this place, because you'll be in for a real treat.I had very, very low expectations for this place. I was absolutely shocked.Indeed, this little Russian place was really amazing! They know how to season their stuff all the way to make it taste really good. I'm not a fan of bland stuff, and a lot of food (especially in college towns) can be bland. I don't think these Pelmeni would be as amazing without the seasoning.The potato ones are nice, but a bit bland, and the meat ones have a little more flavour to them. But it's all the seasoning that makes it great.Plus the fact that these are so original and unusual, and especially that they are so cheap, is a huge plus. Much like the flag of Switzerland is a huge plus. And I love that they do half orders as well for somebody like me, who doesn't want to fill themselves with unhealthy food. Whereas filling myself with unhealthy boys? I'm all about that.Certainly this is the most innovative food I've had in Wisconsin, and definitely one of the highlights of eating in Madison - which granted isn't great - but this place is.The guys are super friendly, and there's a bar attached to it on the inside as well. Now would you like to be attached to me on the inside?And if you're going to take the skin off an orange, don't just do one.

I so wanted to be blown away by my first Paul's experience. Maybe, I over hyped my first experience in my mind before trying the first bite. I went with a half order of half and half with the works on top. Because, why not? Might as well try everything the first trip in. There was so much curry powder on my food that I accidentally inhaled a large amount of powder with my first dumpling bite, then started to cough and ended up getting curry powder all over the table and on my dining partner even. Thankfully, we are still friends after this incident! I love curry, but not that much curry. After the initial curry shock, I promptly mixed my dumplings and toppings before my second bite! The dumplings were not that flavorful on their own. The meat was a bit hard (and chewy) in quite a few of them too. There were 3 tables of us eating during this particular lunch hour. There was a female employee working behind the bar and she was repeatedly yelling at someone on the phone for about 20-25 minutes. It sounded as though it may have been a supplier of theirs. This situation was a bit uncomfortable for us.The location is great for the college crowd and the late hours are perfect for the bar crowd. This probably would be a good stop after drinking on State Street."}, {"review_id": "5ojfV8rsNeJ-O9MeN3ZnAw", "user_id": "DcAlJaR_A2wT8YYy-56qlA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Late-night dumpling eats at a great price.

OH... but it is.The seating is minimal and weird. To be honest. However, the food makes up for it times a million.You go in to this weird little kitchen area that looks odd and industrial and you order. There's only like, 3 things on the menu so it's pretty easy to choose. I recommend for the first visit do the 1/2 and 1/2 with the works. Then you can decide which one you like better. My meal with a drink was $10. I can accept that!We went and sat down at a tiny table. It was lunch time and school is in session so it was a bit packed, but we were still able to find seating for the three of us. They brought us the food relatively quickly which is really nice when you're on a one-hour lunch break.It was phenomenal! I mean, it looks and sounds so plain but for some reason it's like... the best dumplings you have ever had. Just wonderful. And it's super addicting. I actually crave it. It's a fun little experience and it's something different that you can't get anywhere else in the area.GO HERE! Seriously. It is truly as good as everyone says.

I was definitely not disappointed! My partner and I shared a full order of half potato/half beef dumplings with all the fixings. The dumplings were perfectly dense and the fillings inside were really flavorful but perhaps the thing that most impressed me was the sriracha vinegar mix that we both doused our dumplings in. Just really solid well-priced comfort food. It's a little light on the veggies so I try not go to too often but I can imagine that if I were undergrad and tired and needing something cheap and sustaining, this would quickly become a staple for me. Side note: I've ordered a bunch of their dumplings for delivery for work once too and they were polite, helpful, prompt and brought all the fixings too. They were a hit so if you're looking for a catering option, this might be a cool, very Madisonian option."}, {"review_id": "Z8OJcaEYw1HxAkKSCW86lQ", "user_id": "mI2EKUU_PhL4fLSkFZH3Vg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Oh my dear God this is the best comfort food ever.
