The wait is pretty long like 1 hr long but you won't be disappointed! The service was excellent.Ordered the Apfel pfannekuchan and yeah my life is changed forever lol. It was sweet but not overly sweet, and it had some really baked apples on the outside of it that was carmelized.....oh mylanta!Also we got the the eggs benny Florentine style which is with spinach and tomato and we added Canadian bacon. It was the best eggs benny I've ever had! the Canadian bacon had a great smoky flavor to it, and the hollandaise sauce was amazing! I highly recommend trying those 2 dishes."}, {"review_id": "EkT2SAH7MxnmeF5kg00Gnw", "user_id": "9kxFVxFP9J4t_cEdX2-l6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Would have been 5 stars, but I will get to that in a minute.  I hadn't been here in quite some time, maybe ten years.  We came this time as a special treat for my bride after she had a doctor appointment.  We both had our favorite (we were glad it was still on the menu), Banana Nut Bread French Toast.  Oh my.  Three large slices come with a fruit compote on top.  I would like it even more if it included just a drizzle of whipped cream, but it is excellent as it is.  Just very light crispy crust from the grilling adds to it.  These were very generous portions.  We had bacon on the side (which is extra) and it is an applewood smoked variety.  Some of the best bacon I have ever laid a tooth too.  Coffee was passable.Now the reason not 5 stars.  The price.  While the entree was an acceptable 8.99, the extras, bacon and coffee, evidently were much more than we expected and we didn't look at the menu for pricing at that point and had handed them back. Those two extras more than doubled the price of our meal.  2 x 8.99 = 17.98.  Our bill was just over 35$.  Seems a bit over the top for extras.  Maybe i'm just a tightwad, but the wife agreed, they have effectively priced us out of their market.  Too bad."}, {"review_id": "eu_dRrOpAl1IzwHTixKFqA", "user_id": "wK6AmKwpNpICqus5w43vPQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I'm a big fan of Guy so I had to stop here and try this place out. First of all, the wait was 45 minutes. A bit excessive for my taste but was already there so we decided to wait. Once seated the restaurant has simple decorations, but i was there for the food anyway so decorations were not my concern. I had to try the corned beef hash and I was honestly expecting this amazing dish but it fell short, it was just ok. Glad i ordered jalapeños to go with these otherwise they would've fallen short on the flavor. For my side I went with the banana's foster pancakes and they were super sweet to my taste. Didn't finish any of my plates. My daughter had chocolate chip pancakes and she said they were ok. Overall I would say try this place during the week when its less busy. Otherwise the wait is not worth it. You can go eat anywhere else and avoid the long wait.They get 3 stars because our waiter was very nice and polite."}, {"review_id": "xLNPLefpXw6k1oVvwiRtsg", "user_id": "hyhvm_7sZV_zBqFicN7v5A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Such a cute breakfast spot in San Antonio.

Imagine my surprise - no, chagrin - when my wife woke me up in the morning, not with a gentle, loving kiss, but a shove to the ribs like a rowdy little girl excited to open gifts early on a Christmas morning. \"Are you awake?\", she asked. Ummmm, \"I am now\"...dreading to hear what bad news broke my restful slumber. So the wife continued...\"since we missed out on Magnolia Pancake Haus the other day, how about we go there as soon as they open so there's no wait?\" All I could muster as a reply was an incredulous \"Really!\" Apparently, the wife went to sleep and woke up thinking about their Pfannekucken. . So off we went leaving our hotel around 6:45 AM, still a bit bleary eyed and with vision somewhat obscured by morning dew resting on our vehicle's windshield and windows. Learning from a previous experience with the long wait, I downloaded the No Wait app and used it when we were within 5 miles to move up in the queue...but this being still o'dark thirty, lo and behold, there was no wait.We were promptly seated in a booth close to the main door, shown the menu, and had our coffee and iced water on our table in no time. We liked how they also have a carafe of coffee served on the table so we wouldn't have to flag down a server if, more like when, we need some more go-go juice, aka coffee.The wife already knew what she wanted, Apfel Pfannekuchen ($10.50) of course, and I ordered their blueberry pancakes ($7.95) with a side of bacon ($4.95). Note that it takes about 10 minutes or so to make their pfannekuchen (or pannekuchen)...so make sure you have enough napkins as you salivate while you wait.My blueberry pancakes were fluffy, flavorful, filling...and fantastic. What other fitting adjectives can I think of that starts with the letter f? I guess I can call it felicious, fummy, and favory. The Apfel Pfannekuchen was better than my wife hoped for. We've had pannekuchen at various places, even at the famed Pancake Bakery in Amsterdam (they call them pannenkoeken), and none of them measured up to my wife's lofty expectations. Incidentally, there is a difference between the German and Dutch pannekuchen, with the German version a little more substantial.Service was friendly and attentive. The place was clean and inviting, even after something like 12 years at this location. We didn't know this place was featured on Triple D until I saw Guy Fieri's mug on a poster I passed on the hallway leading to the restrooms. We read the owner started the business back in 2000, moved to this bigger building in 2006, and has since opened a second restaurant in San Antonio with the same name and has also started to cater.An enjoyable dining experience that truly makes us want to come back again...guess they adhered to their mission statement during this visit as we had a \"dining experience so enjoyable\"...and \"we can't wait to come back!\"Breakfast for 2, with coffee, came out to just over $37 with tip.Note:- Our first visit, around 1100 on a weekday during spring break, was met with a long queue lasting 45 minutes to an hour...Your miles may vary but I don't know if there is anything worth waiting that long for. That being said, it might be worth your while to download the No Wait app or use the Waitlist option on Yelp to move up on the queue."}, {"review_id": "xJll6Tfd5zxyk4H8p_9wqA", "user_id": "Fsj-t4LE4FSbrrGCzGY69w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Delicious but the wait...

This place was on diners, drive ins and dives so of course I had to make a stop. I ordered some pancakes (duh) and two of my favorite things in one - pulled pork eggs Benedict! I had to get it because 1. I love pulled pork and 2. I loved eggs Benedicts. The mixture of the savory pulled pork with hollandaise sauce and eggs was so unique and genius. It's also such a cute spot! I went on a weekday and it was super packed!

Order the Apple pfanechuken pancake. You won't regret it !The apple streusel pfanenchuken is just a fancy way of saying 'apple pancake'The pancake is made with real apple bits, and is baked for 25-20 minutes. It's really sweet and no syrup is necessary.Even though it's made with real Granny Smith apple bits, found something embedded in the pancake that tasted like a bell pepper, but it was just the skin of the Apple. Chef should cut this part out at all costs as it gave me quite the scare ( see pics).Was it worth the 45 minute wait. I'd say so. Not gonna find too many pancake places that are truly noteworthy as much as magnolia pancake haus."}, {"review_id": "ckC9znBRX-jRk7yt_CgEHw", "user_id": "Zfw2nTkwnUbgVJmnai3XiA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "So we went on a Friday morning around 10am. I think normally it probably wouldn't have been as busy, but it was spring break so we had to wait about 30-35 minutes for a table for 3. I think you should definitely be prepared to wait awhile if you're coming on the weekend. But there is a pretty big patio area outside and some benches inside so there are places to wait. We let our son practice walking up and down the little side walk next to the restaurant and that kept him pretty entertained. Service was quick once we sat down and she was very friendly. I ordered the scrambled eggs with bacon and apple cinnamon pancakes. The eggs were good, the bacon could have been a little crispier, but the pancakes were delicious! Nice slices of apples in the pancakes. Enough for a nice flavor but not so big that it takes away from the fluffy texture of the pancake. I haven't had pancakes that good in a long time! My husband had the bacon pancakes and he felt the same way. Once we got seated we were out in about 30-40 minutes. So service was quick and food was great. It's a good spot if you don't mind waiting.

Bland, burnt food..forgetting items, and over priced for the quality and quantity you get.I used the check in on Yelp which was helpful getting checked in quicker..just be mindful you have to be with in 5miles to do it.They are always busy so we expected a wait which is normal here....I decided to try something different...big mistake :(I ordered the spinach and mushroom omelet and apple juice and side of wheat toast.My husband got the magnolia haus breakfast with pancakes and O.J.The food didn't take to long to come out. My omelet had NO flavor at all and the mushrooms where rubbery. I tried adding salt and still didn't help at all.  They forgot my toast and said they would bring it right out when they brought our order. I see the same server bring the table next to use there food and I spot the toast so I was sure it was for me...but she gave it to there table instead.....mmmm I was seated first and a while before them, I figured since she forgot mine I would get my complete meal before serving a table that came after us. So I stopped the manager who was helping her serve the order and asked for it and he brought it right away.Not a big deal, however I'm one of those people who likes to eat everything I order together..NOT after I finish the main part. I also had to wait for someone to get jelly since he walked off so quickly. Our server brought two little plastic unlabeled cups and said it was made in house.Okay yum I thought...but one out of the two jelly went bad because you could taste the sourness and the color was waaay of compared to the first one which was bright in color. My husband asked for crispy bacon and got rock hard burnt bacon instead as well as burnt hash Browns.We had been waiting SO long to eat we just decided go home and made some food there.I have always thought this place was amazing...but the 9+ times I have been there the food continues to lack flavor and the quality the kitchen puts out has fallen short from my first few times here."}, {"review_id": "ies_G3lXql-rAuX0_qIDOw", "user_id": "-cQkVt6b44dbsgFOk5UnbA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "We love this place for special occasions!
