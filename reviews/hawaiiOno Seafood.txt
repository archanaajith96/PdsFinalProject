I plan to be back here when I visit again.I tried the shoyu ahi and spicy ahi. Both were really good but I enjoyed the spicy ahi more in terms of flavor. Their fish is extremely fresh and soft and the amount of fish to rice was perfect. Top it off with a $1 coconut water that you can get with your meal and life's good.

Period. No questions asked. I miss you. I'm sad that this is closed on Mondays since I wanted to try it when I got there on Monday, and I wanted to get it before I left on Monday but it was closed. I was so sad.It's interesting to me since I don't even like tuna that much. I would never order tuna regularly at a poke place but this place.. the ahi is soo good. It literally melts in your mouth and is so delicious with the sauce. I got a large with the spicy ahi and the shoyu ahi, since they said that was popular. I loved both options and they went perfectly with the rice. The meal also comes with a drink! I think the total came out to around $11 which is not bad. I saved my leftover poke for the beach and it was still delicious as ever.Ughh. I want this so bad. Do yourself a favor and go. The hardest part is the parking and there might not be a place to eat after you get your food. But whatever it's good."}, {"review_id": "qiRVKOaht4O6CR38uty_Jw", "user_id": "cTCYvfHsNf4E0dr9wFj1Ww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Bottom line: This is the #1 stop you have to make in Oahu for Poke. This timeless poke stop has been around for 10+ years making THE BEST poke in town. When I think back to my vacations out to Hawaii, the food here is the first thing that comes to mind. Alot of Poke spots out in California can come out kind of mushy but the poke here had the right mix of texture and melt in your mouth goodness.The shoyu ahi and spicy ahi are extremely popular and the freshest seafood I have personally ever had. The shoyu sauce is incredible and is the right balance between sweet and salty. The portions here are gigantic and they give an excessively abundant amount of rice with your meal as well. All meals come with a free drink and the pickled appitizers in the freezer were fantastic as well. The Pickled mango was a particular favorite of mine. Parking is rough and don't expect to find a place to sit so be sure to take it to go and take in some sun while enjoying some top of the line seafood for under $10!"}, {"review_id": "300GwTkBnZg9qOC_apqVlA", "user_id": "5re8RQ-2-Mkz7LC4ftYfHw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "F R E S H.  P O K E. This isn't like all those chipotle-esque poke places scattered all over the US of AYYEEE (lol), but more of a homey, simple type of dish. It shows in its mom & pop exterior and interior. It takes its home underneath the light blue apartments, with a little awning that gives shade for a communal bench, a few tables and chairs. After that, its a small parking lot where they share the lot with the apartments. With that being said, parking sucks asssss  This place prettyyy much specializes on their quality of fish and how they prepare/flavor it (wasabi, Hawaiian, shoyu, spicy), give or take onions and seaweed. Then they lay it on a bed of of warm rice. super simple ingredients, but amazing taste. They only have two options -- octopus/tako and tuna/ahi, but thats enough to showcase their craft.I got the spicy ahi and shoyu tako since it looked so good on yelp! the spicy ahi was spicier than I thought, but creamy af. Being the girlfriend I am, I HAD to have some of my boyfriend's wasabi ahi. The fish had a hint of wasabi, but I loved how it was so fresh and buttery tender, it was like eating a chunk of sashimi and rice.With your meal, you get a free drink! My bf wouldn't shut up about the POG in Hawaii, so he made me get one too -_____-  This was a great meal before we hiked Manoa falls. I will definitely come back next time I'm in Oahu!"}, {"review_id": "iG3tok8IsMGYlvEyBR-npA", "user_id": "4QGfZc15B9Fn2lSOz4f_KA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "The long overdue review for Ono Seafood has finally come. This classic poke stop shop has practically been around since the beginning of time,  and is still producing high quality poke that is reflective of it's name! I've tried the shoyu ahi and spicy ahi before and although the shoyu ahi is really good, I prefer spicy foods, so the spicy ahi will always be my go-to when I'm getting one flavor.The auntys and uncles working here are also super friendly and nice which makes your food experience 10x better. There are two fridges, one filled with a wide selection of Hawaiian Sun drinks and the other of different sides and goodies. My friend got a side of taegu (seasoned codfish) and it was really good. It's hard to explain how it tastes like but it was a little nutty and sweet and starchy all at the same time. It may look a little weird but definitely don't knock it till you've tried it. The regular size is $8.50 and it's an additional $0.50 for 2 flavors. I find that the regular is filling enough and leaves me satisfied and content. There is also a large that might be appropriate to share with someone else. Good luck trying to find parking in the lot in front of the store as there are basically only 2 spots. There's a small parking area on Winam Ave to your right when you drive past Ono but that tends to get filled quickly too. It might be better to save yourself the trouble and just find street parking a few steps away, and that way you'll be able to walk off that post-poke feeling after too.

I ordered a #2 bowl which was a spiced flavored squid over your choice of white or brown rice. It also came with a canned beverage. I didn't know what to expect but I really enjoyed it. The cool meat over the warm rice with the kick of flavor is something to experience.My mom ordered a #1 bowl, a seasoned ahi tuna which was less spicy but still quite delicious.There were other things in the refrigerator that could be ordered to go but we stuck to the recs from the girl at the counter. The location is a little hard to find. They have a red sign out front but they are squeezed next to what appears to be an apartment complex. The parking is crampedThey do not have inside seating. It's essentially a counter and refrigerator inside. There are two picnic tables outside on a small patio. This is not a fine dining establishment or fancy date place by any means. It is, however, a delicious hole in the wall. As a tourist, you know you found the right place when there is a heavy stream of locals. This is not going to be on the tourist trolley stop but the hunt to find it is well worth it."}, {"review_id": "U7edXCJ1w75iKBGJ7BloBQ", "user_id": "TENAMOQaL1L7hFVw5sC2xA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Great little poke joint! They have a tiny parking lot in front which gets filled up quickly! The place is very small on the inside and very simple. Clearly the focus is entirely on the food. There are several options for poke but we decided to try the spicy ahi and the Hawaiian poke. We got the large bowl with white rice. The meal comes with a drink so grabbed some guava nectar as well. Overall came out to around $11.50 which seemed a little pricey. The large is not actually that large and mostly rice. I feel volume of fish could have been a little but more. Overall loved both pokes! The Hawaiian was spicier than expected but nice to have that extra kick. The spicy ahi was definitely my favorite. The mayo makes it just right!"}, {"review_id": "CcqLqK5pjbL4F4z_88oOGw", "user_id": "SNTpaP0YNv0ZOAZMBLFxDA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "BEST. POKE. IN. TOWN. I highly recommend Ono's if you want to eat fresh, HQ, and tasty poke. There's no if's, and's, or but's; I could end this review right here but I wanna tell you guys how good this place is!!!First off, the parking situation for Ono's isn't ideal. There're only 5-6 parking stalls specially reserved for Ono's; park anywhere else and you will get towed. There's street parking across the street but you'd have to make a full circle. There are times where I'm CRAVING for Ono's but there's no parking, resulting me in not getting my poke fix :( They have outdoor seating but it's not a lot so best bet is to take it home to eat.The menu is super simple; 8 options with either white or brown rice in a regular or large size. Love it! My go-to is always a regular combo ($0.50 extra) with shoyu and spicy ahi with white rice & my boyfriend gets the large combo with spicy ahi and miso tako with brown rice. The shoyu that they add at the end definitely tops it off; there's so much flavor and when it soaks into the rice, OH MY GOSH. I used to not like Ono's for their huge cubes of ahi so I'm pretty sure they cut down on the size of ahi they serve... The ahi has no fishy aftertaste and super soft (but not melt-in-your-mouth kine soft). They also have pupus in the fridge before you order the actual poke bowl + no charge for a drink (water, canned juice or soda)  if you purchase a bowl."}, {"review_id": "0Pdfhd2U66SL3SdG9eFJyA", "user_id": "oIrvWK6R33DUFdWbklvhrw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "That was my first stop for food in Waikiki and it was a very good choice for poke (my wife and I did a few Poke places during our trip) this is in the top 3 best poke we had.

I love my poke too soft or too \"smoochy\" (feel like it was over mixed)i like it when i can bite into the pieces, freshier and tastier, this is what you get at ONO.There was alot of locals going in and out to this place which is a good sign!

Poke is very Hawaiian, but getting poke on the island is a little tricky. Poke has gotten so much attention lately that you can find it anywhere on the island (and also in the mainland). Because poke is easy to make and pretty much everyone can make it, so everyone starts selling it. Yes, everyone can make it, but the key point here is, not everyone has access to GOOD QUALITY FISH. When I get poke in the mainland, I often stay away from the shoyu poke, because if your fish is not the highest quality, the soy sauce will REALLY bring it out. I finally found one place where I can get shoyu poke and still enjoyed it. The tuna is fresh and tender, without the fishy taste (like I said, tuna is very tricky, you need to have the best quality fish to get rid of the fishy taste - I normally stay away from tuna when I go to sushi restaurants unless I'm in Japan) ; the onion is a nice touch.

According to my other fellow yelpers and other food magazine's blo and etc... this is the best place to get your poki on! Of course it was a must try on our list as we've heard HI has the best sashimi on the nation lol. So we came to have dinner here one of the nights we were staying here back in Oct. Since my family all got different items I got to try all of their poki or whatever that was leftover haha. So their fresh ahi 12-16 pieces is a must for all you sashimi lovers out there! Salmon was out so we didnt not get to try that one. I got the spicy and miso ahi. My parents got the fresh octopus or squid mix over brown rice. And my Brother also got some spicy ahi and something else. Your meal also comes with a drink and you get a choice of brown or white rice. The staff was very friendly and we were in and out of this place within 20-25 mins. Im def a fan and will be returning whenever I am on the island of Oahu!
