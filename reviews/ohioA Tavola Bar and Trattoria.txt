Each visit makes me a little more pleased. My go to item is the cauliflower (NEVER TAKE THIS OFF THE MENU) and the artichoke pizza. The brussel sprout pizza needs maybe one or two more savory items on it to really bring it up to the level of the artichoke majesty.  The prices are a little more than you spend at the local pizzeria, but that crispy brick oven pizza crust and freshness of ingredients is totes worth the extra pennies.Pro tip: Go here for the food vittles and then move on for drinks. There isn't anything super spectacular on the drink menu and it is all cheaper on your bar crawl. PLUS, you have just carb loaded in an advance so your pre-game will hopefully prevent post game vomit in your hair. :)"}, {"review_id": "r08aIp9DGuSYSa1ewE8f9Q", "user_id": "hQhW5x7P83KwGuagwHIBwA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Rockstar kitchen manager Miss.

Everything looked super tasty so I was totally cool with chowing down on some pizza for the evening. We arrived around 8:30 at night and were seated right away at a table for four. We fit perfectly in this modern, Neapolitan style pizzeria/Italian restaurant. The floor plan was pretty open and I loved how there was a giant bar and that you could see into the kitchen. Between the four of us we order three different pizzas, the margherita, the bussel sprout, and I believe a basic pepperoni and sausage pizza (which I avoided because I don't eat meat). I enjoyed every single bite of the pizza I tried. It was absolutely delish! The crust was thin and slightly chewy and the toppings on the pizzas we choose were fabulous. I love a good margherita pizza and the giant pieces of mozzarella and fresh basil definitely hit the spot! Now, I was very intrigued by the brussel sprout pizza and I'm SO freakin' glad we tried it. The caramelized onions gave it a bit of sweetness and the fontina cheese with the brussel sprouts blew my mind! If you're up for trying new things, give this one a go. I don't think you'll be disappointed!While I didn't get a drink during my visit, the drink menu did seem to have a lot of options that I would enjoy. The staff was also super friendly and on top of our needs throughout our entire visit. The price was also spot on for what we got. We even had leftovers which is always a plus when it comes to pizza!"}, {"review_id": "Q8mjpAxTxw7RAQRLMR0iPw", "user_id": "nbWgMdt3nBkDQ7qEo27sLg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Not too casual and not too upscale. The food is SO flavorful. We love coming here on a weeknight for a quick bite. Service is always great and quick. And again the food is just so flavorful. I love being able to get a bunch of things and they make that easy. The La Varieta is perfect for getting to try a lot of the started but in smaller portions. Leaving you room for a pizza!

To be honest, I thought my dinner at A Tavola was just ok, and I don't think it's worth the hype. Service was good and the prices are fair for OTR, but I wasn't as blown away by the pizza as everyone else seems to be.My friend and I walked in around 6pm on a Tuesday night and there were plenty of tables to choose from. We were immediately greeted by a server who was very friendly and got our waters right away. We started with the meatball duo ($18) that comes with one beef and one chicken meatball. The meatballs were good, but didn't blow me away with flavor. I thought they were a little bland. My favorite part about our appetizer was the fresh ricotta! Overall, I thought this appetizer was kind of expensive for two jumbo meatballs and sauce.For dinner I ordered the fig and prosciutto pizza ($18) that everyone is always raving about. The crust is thin and chewy and charred on the outside from the pizza oven. It's personal preference, but the charred crust tasted a little burnt to me and wasn't my cup of tea. Some people really like their pizza that way though. The fig and prosciutto flavor was nice, but it was overpowered by the fontina cheese which was suuuper funky. It was also a little soggy in the middle from all of the wet toppings. I had a couple of slices and took the rest home for leftovers, so this pizza could easily be split between two people.Overall, A Tavola seems to have a polarizing style of cooking their pizza that others may like, but I don't know if it was for me. I would come back to try the rest of their small plates and maybe another pizza flavor because the fig and prosciutto was just ok for me. Service and atmosphere were great."}, {"review_id": "CV0-GGA6ECv52BlXkOvbCQ", "user_id": "_fx2Vwtn8X5Sx918CApF_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "We were in Cinci for business from California and someone recommended we give the OTR a try for food/beer. We picked this place by random and were impressed!Everything we ordered was amazing. We mostly ordered vegetarian. Highly recommend the Cauliflower, Carrots and the Arancini for antipasti. The chicken meatballs were large sized, served with garlic bread, fresh mozzarella and were delicious as well. We ordered a Margherita Pizza (added some red onions to appease one of our colleagues) and really enjoyed it! The dough and crust were excellent.We topped it off with some of their home made gelato. All of us enjoyed the salted caramel in particular. All in all a very satisfying meal. We would go back in an instant!"}, {"review_id": "CxWNHwJ-7zH5KYfjbba0wA", "user_id": "AHRrG3T1gJpHvtpZ-K0G_g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "Mmm...that was a tasty late night stop in downtown Cincy. Cincy Cindy, you never lead us astray.A Tavola is crisply decorated (somewhat Scandinavian) with the large wood fired oven serving as the star of the show. You can't miss it behind the bar. The space offers several smaller tables and a long bar along the left side. The pizza is Neapolitan (my favorite style) with a chewy thin crust and fun creative topping ingredients alongside classics like Margherita with buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes and basil. We were especially tickled with the brussels sprouts pizza topped with caramelized onions and and fontina cheese. If you're looking for a bebida, they offer a liquor menu (craft cocktails), beer and wine. Bonus: the price is right. Most pizzas fall between $11 and $20. One pizza could easily serve 1.5 - 2 people depending on how hungry you are. Leftovers never hurt anyone."}, {"review_id": "X-6m4HjzNhyhpyErKJTayQ", "user_id": "82twQHRt7gcZyq-ClmcaIg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/11/2017", "text": "I hadn't been to A Tavola in a couple years but stopped in last night before a play and I'm really glad I did! Four of us arrived at 4:30 and there were no tables available (30 minute wait) so we dined at the full service bar.  Steve (I hope this was his name) was a great bartender and was very attentive. We watched him concoct several drinks, which all looked amazing.I ordered the Duo meatballs which is one chicken meatball and one wagyu meatball.  They both came with red sauce, and the chicken meatball came with pesto as well.  The meatballs were accompanied by ricotta (plenty for each!) and garlic bread.  These meatballs were AMAZING. But, when I come back I'll order just the wagyu meatballs because that one was my favorite.Overall, the food and service were both great and I will definitely be back soon!"}, {"review_id": "5uAdkFE85OzZo2ksgEPWHg", "user_id": "E4QjnTcc1Ie2MgD5rlNznA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "So this review is only for the pizza: a few friends and I shared some pizzas tonight. Spoiler, I've never been to A Tavola before, but I have heard such great things! We ordered the Gorgonzola, the Margarita, and the Brussel Sprout pizza. They came out very quickly, one by one. After the obligatory photo op, we dove in. It was INSANE. The Brussel Sprout pizza was sweet, flavorful, and unique. The Gorg was smokey, salty, and FULL of intense flavor. The Marg pizza was meh. There was hardly any basil, which is the best part of the pizza. I wanted to like it, but it was pretty forgettable IMO. The CRUST of all the pizza was un-freaking-real, so chewy, crispy, they know what's UP with that crust... The service was fantastic, and I will definitely be back to try out all the other amazing sounding pizzas and apps they have!!!!"}, {"review_id": "wWMS7J4BGcRH3VOzYmMZAA", "user_id": "SV1oD5dR3aJsphSxv6n7OQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "I've been here several times and probably if had the majority of the items on the menu.

Everything was great - they are consistently delivering quality eats.We two pizzas, one with just cheese and pepperoni, and the other was a brussels sprouts Pizza.

I have wanted to try A Tavola for awhile and finally got my chance. It worked out perfect as my husband was craving pizza, I wanted to come here and A Tavola makes pizza. Perfect! I told my husband let's try A Tavola because we can kill two birds with one stone. We were both glad we did! Neither of us were disappointed. This will be my go to pizza place when we are out and not just ordering in. They also have good and STRONG drinks. Yum! The staff was friendly and the establishment was packed so that must mean a good time. Haha! We started off by ordering an appetizer and I ordered a side salad. We ordered the Chicken Meatballs and the House side salad. The Chicken Meatballs were very good. You could definitely taste the love and could tell they were homemade. They were packed full of flavor and nice & tender. It was also served with garlic bread and Ricotta cheese. My 10 month old really enjoyed these, eating almost a full one by herself. The bread was perfect and added a nice crunch. The cheese was like the cherry on top. Really good! My side salad was good. It had Bibb lettuce, radicchio, balsamic vinaigrette, and parmigiano reggiano. It was super simple but good. I enjoyed it. I couldn't decide on pizza or pasta but I settled to share the pizza with my husband. I'm glad I did though. It was amazing! We ordered the Sausage & Sage Pizza. It was packed with flavor but nothing overwhelming. It was the perfect balance of flavors. The sausage was flavorful with a little hint of spice which was good. The sage added the nice herb flavor but wasn't overpowering. It was thin crust and yummy. I have been to Italy and this pizza reminded me of true Italian pizza. A+ in my book! We also ordered drinks. My husband ordered a glass of red wine. I'm pretty sure it was Pinot Noir as this is his favorite. I ordered the Fantasia. My husband really enjoyed his wine and thought it was good. My drink was very good and different. I like girly drinks or things that are different. The Fantasia was made up of housemade limoncello, seasonal sorbet, prosecco, and mint. It was the liquid with a scoop of sorbet in the center topped with mint. I loved the liquor flavor mixed with the thickness of the sorbet. It was also strong. I had a buzz after the fact I had already started eating. This was a great and cutesy drink! Overall, A Tavola was a success! I will definitely be back to try the pasta and for more pizza and drinks!!"}, {"review_id": "t_IZxJdHeF-Aunb7u-Sg2g", "user_id": "tYJX79Eh3d3vCgHYBflf8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Very good sausage and mushroom pizza.  Very simple but yet delicious classic red pizza sauce.  The crust is fluffy and light, but still has a small crunch.  There is a very laid back type of atmosphere here.  I can't wait to come back."}, {"review_id": "QIccBGVVxOdSIwB653Suyw", "user_id": "4YLEZjZmxpWvRZPa0gDSDw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/1/2017", "text": "I mean, how can I not..... A tavola is heaven for foodies (not just pizza lovers). I've experienced A Tavola countless times and always a winner. I can also see it from every room in my house and still never get tired of it!

Started with Cacio e Pepe pasta. Very good al dente pasta in cheese and black pepper sauce. Could have been just a tad warmer. Had the pizza next, a build your own. Pizza had fresh ingredients, however the caramelized onions cause the crust to become very soggy and again food should have been just a bit warmer. Ended with the waygu meatballs.

It was a good tender meatball, but as I recall their tomato sauce was a bit sweet for my liking -- this seems to be a Midwest thing.Today, I split the sweet pea and bacon pizza with my daughter. We loved it. First, the crust is great. Very thin, we watched them stretch the dough by hand. Their oven is hot. The crust was appropriately crispy and chewy. It also had some nice bubbles and scorched edges. It was lightly sauced -- if I had to guess, I'd say olive oil and Parmigiana. The peas added a nice sweetness to balance the salty bacon. The bacon was perfect: well-rendered lardons, not the typical bacons shards one usually finds in the states. We'll be back for more of that pie...
