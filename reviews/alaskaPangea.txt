We decided to sit at the bar and were greeted by the most amazing bartender, Taylor. She definitely helped to make our experience perfect! We started with drinks; Washington Apple Mule and the Ginger Lemon Drop. We loved both! The Nectarine Mule was also awesome! We tried a few of the small plates as our meal and all were out of this world! The chicken wings were the best I have ever had. The peanut sauce was a perfect blend of sweet, spicy, and salty with chunks of peanuts that gave awesome texture. The red chiles on top really brought the dish together. We were tempted to order a second plate! The oxtail bao was also delicious. The texture of the oxtail was amazing; super tender and flavorful. I loved the chili oil that was on top and the housemade pickles. Last, we tried the beef cheek small plate which was super surprising! The presentation was not as unique and beautiful as the first two that we ordered, but the flavor blew us away. The beef cheek meat melted in your mouth. I loved the combination of flavors when you incorporated the yellow beets. Everything we had was amazing and we can't wait to come back! We hope that Taylor is available to help us enjoy our experience again!"}, {"review_id": "bfF30553XyzyWLzRNFYgnw", "user_id": "sAAowvhLsGrLyCwAGKMrEw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Pangaea! We happened to accidentally come in here tonight (because Club Paris was full) and there was an event being hosted by 4 A's (Alaskan AIDS Assistance Association) called Dining Out For Life. When we arrived it was relatively quiet, and luckily so, because we didn't have a reservation. I love the atmosphere of Pangaea, the decor, the spaciousness. It's large, not got loads of junk all over the walls, and a nice middle bar area. They have nice linen napkins, good silverware, the tables are nice, and I just enjoy the views out of the windows. It's up there in my top 5. Now i had some scary health news yesterday, with one aspect of it regarding my Blood Pressure, and i did not even want to eat out, so i was super determined I WOULD NOT BINGE!! It's not even date night, for heaven's sake. So our server came over, and it's the 1s time we'd ever dealt with this particular girl. She told us about the specials, a most delightful sounding burger that had mash inside of it. Yes you read that correctly. Mash on the inside. Or a halibut dish, that sailed over my head, because i was too busy thinking of a burger with mash in it. But because I'm terrified of my health problems i get a Caesar Salad, and the house bread and compound butter to accompany. I've seen this bread before, on someone else's table, and know it's $4, and quite a hefty chunk of bread and butter, for a most reasonable price. Husband, with his very average blood pressure, and zero health problems, orders the mash-burger, which comes with truffle fries. He's not such a fan of the truffle fries, and tells me i can eat them if I'd like. NO!! Stop encouraging me. My veins are screaming for mercy, at the damage I've done to them, and I've got to stop! So I'm all primly sitting there, eating slowly, but i make a \"chip butty\" with 2 fries, and a piece of the bread. (Google chip butty- it's an English speciality) and he cuts a quarter of his burger, and tells me to eat it. He is loving it, and he's kinda picky about burgers. Bacon, cheese, a medium burger, a fried patty of mashed potato, and some kind of delicious sauce on that thing. So i did. I had a bite. It was divine. I had another bite, and made him take it away from me. All in all, i ate 5 fries, 2 bites of his mash burger, Caesar Salad, and 3 pieces of that warm sourdough. So damn good. And the ambiance had picked up, there was a guy with a video camera on a tripod, like a professional looking setup, a lady at a table, going around with donation envelopes, which could win you a prize. An Alaskan railroad trip to Seward, or a flightseeing tour, i forget the 3rd thing. And they had a guy, with a board, asking if you wanted to have your picture taken, which of course, me being me, i was up for that!But it was fun, and I don't feel like i over ate, or had too much salt or fat. You guys, I'm sad I can't eat the way I want to. Anyway, it was all still delicious as always. I love coming to Pangaea."}, {"review_id": "rXRbkl13ZBXsWFJ73o8n-Q", "user_id": "sxEN3IZ12yYanSHgnrMvfQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Brunch, consisting of the amazing chicken and waffles with a spicy maple syrup and sweet corn ice cream, was nothing short of amazing.  Also loved the great signature cocktails they served!  We went back for dinner and I tried the veggie Wellington, which was spectacular.  The food is definitely inventive and tasty, and all that we tried was delicious. The loss of a Star was really based on service.  While everyone who took care of us was nice, engaging, and knowledgeable, service was slow.  I got up to get refills on drinks from the bar twice, and the restaurant was busy but not packed.  All in all, I'll keep going here because the food is great, the location and ambience are good, and the people (especially the hostess) are sweet and kind.  I'll just make sure I book out extra time--which is okay with me, because I can just order an extra Mango Bellini!!!!"}, {"review_id": "rK8wg8GbwPrM3zMUp6MKfg", "user_id": "WovgKzEnDbjdhuz6YQZhBw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "I have been wanting to try this place for a while now, so my wife took me here for my birthday.

A little too creamy for me. I was also really tired of heavy food during my trip, and this was my last meal there so I can't blame them too much. There was also this soup that we've never heard of (I still can't remember the name of it) and it totally threw me off when it was sour. We asked the waitress what was in the soup before we ordered it and all she said was it had potatoes and veggies in it. I feel like it would have been important to say that it was sour....it's a huge part of the flavor. I might have liked it more if she was able to accurately describe the dish. This place is also too expensive for the quality of food you get. Maybe I should have ordered something else, but it was just a three star for me."}, {"review_id": "jjhusEidLNtKZMYfgTS7Lg", "user_id": "FJ_Us5rDjdXCkM9TQ1IDQA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "The service was exceptional. Our server really knew the menu inside and out and made recommendations all around. The two dishes we didn't get to try were the duck and the Filipino chicken adobo. Anything from traditional, I'm sure their flavor profiles would be unique.We had a few beers alongside a few appetizers. Yucca fries with aioli were cooked perfectly with a flavorful, fresh aoili. The plaintain tostadas were fried to a nice crisp, with freshly made guacamole and a few sauces. I wish there was a bit more flavor in the guac, it was a little simple, but the pork belly was the star. We also had the king mushroom which came with a few sauces. The plating for all the dishes was exquisite and picture-perfect.I'd come back."}, {"review_id": "0PBFe1Y27CMPwahA15VoIQ", "user_id": "N8nlG4XpbAcB74jEWUVQlg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Hands down my favorite place to get in Anchorage.

Thus I must revert to positivity!Pangea is creative, thoughtful, and exciting in its flavors and presentation. -Ny steak, one of the best dishes I have ever eatin. The layers of flavor: cream sauce, bacon jam,  sweet onions, Gorgonzola cheese, truffle fries, and steak. Get everything in one bite and wham a culinary masterpiece, flavors coming at you in waves but perfectly meshed like a symphony. No clutter, each flavor comes through on its own and in order but each flavor also adds to the next what a dance on the pallet! I have been imitating it at home and it's good, but not the same (we take food and cooking seriously). we haven't yet prepared every piece of flavor and served together, didn't have truffle sauce and fries!-the key lime cheese cake looked like the death star and was delicious. Portion was a little small but flavor and presentation was excellent. I mean it was really good but we were so in awe with the steak dish that it is hard to remember the particular details! I would definitely order it again!-the boar shank was really good but once again wasn't as exciting as the other listed dishes, especially the steak. Flavor wasn't as layered and the saltiness of the sauce was the strongest flavor.-we started with an Asian salad that was very good but was a hair heavy on the mayonnaise flavor in the sauce. However it was excellent.I want to come back here and based upon every dish being tasty and creative i would order anything on the menu just to try! Yes it's that kind of place, but my lady and I will always be splitting the steak as well, epic and for $29 idk if you can find a cheaper thrill!!!Ps the specialty mule was epic and the Bloody Mary was alright!"}, {"review_id": "vckhd5luwOi13q4ZC-FE7A", "user_id": "Prx3Egow2yL4WrZU0CQcFQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "Mike Dodge is one of the most talented chefs in Anchorage and we are so happy that he is here.

If you have two and a half hours to spend on dinner then you wouldn't have a problem with the especially slow service we received. Our server was inattentive and while our food took a good 60 minutes or so to reach our table after our drink order was taken, not once did she come over to acknowledge our wait. Upon the food arriving, my husband's burger was well undercooked when he requested well-done (surprising since it took forever for our food to come in the first place). After we got our food, our server did not come back to check on us in a timely manner so we flagged another server down to request they fix my husband's burger that was reddish-pink in the center.Brunch on the other hand has been exceptional. Service is MUCH better and the food is also on point in comparison to dinner. I would strongly recommend them for brunch and sadly suggest they work on their night crew for a more efficient and enjoyable experience."}, {"review_id": "RmLN3JThUHEJBkF1NxxYmQ", "user_id": "kbNIHNRjDim4mTwVa-TMfw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "Stopped by Pangea recently and had a very nice meal. I am starting to appreciate the idea of small plate eating, and this restaurant provides that. I also find myself gravitating to restaurants that offer plenty of vegetable option, not just meat and starch. I tried the arepas, tostones, and the surf and turf bites. All of them were delicious. As a beer drinker, I think they could build up the draft and bottle list a bit, but that's a pretty small gripe.

It's great food and ambiance, and decent service. I say decent as this last time my party was already crossed off the reservation list when we got there and had to find a table. Every dish I've had here has been amazing and beautifully presented. Most recent discovery was the veggie wellington. Man, was that a great dish. I have found a favorite. Meze platter is always a pleaser, and there is quite a bit for as an appetizer for a few people or as an entrée. You really can't go wrong with this place. I will say I like the seating on the west side of the restaurant. It's quieter and there is less foot traffic.

I feel like I'm being generous giving it 3 stars. It's clean and the waitress was friendly. The food was nothing to write home about, over all pretty bland. I liked the burger but it tasted just like an Arctic Roadrunner burger but instead of $9 it was $13 at Pangea. Sure, that includes a side with a cup of tomato soup, but that soup wasn't worth the extra $4. My parents meals were just as lackluster. When I dine out I expect the food to be better than what could make at home, with the exception of somewhere for convenience. Pangea was neither.

I've been here for dinner and lunch previously and both were delicious.  Today we went for Sunday brunch and it really hit the spot! Started off on just the right note with a mango Bellini (very good). My husband had a Bloody Mary, which was probably the least impressive thing we ordered, what it lacked in flavor they tried to make up for with too much pepper.  My husband ordered the goat shakshouka and I had the lox on a baguette--both were excellent and my husband (who is difficult to impress) was very pleased that the egg on his goat was actually over-medium as he requested (he says it never usually comes out that way). I was pleased to have a lox option that was not served on the traditional bagel and cream cheese (as much as I love that too) instead it had some tobiko, some lettuce, egg salad, and radishes, which paired nicely (the menu said capers, but these were not on it). We ordered a loaded waffle for the table as dessert and that was the perfect way to satisfy my sweet tooth. Service was decent, didn't have water at the end, but we had a couple big bottles on the table, so I guess the server didn't notice we had emptied them."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pangea-anchorage?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
