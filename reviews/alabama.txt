Our favorite is to go on a nice day and sit out on the outside patio, share a bottle of wine and get a few things off the bar bites menu (pork chop bites are a must!). It's relaxed for us and the outside is peaceful. Sometimes they'll have live music playing and it really adds to the experience. Sunday nights they have their signature pork chop deal for $40. Go with a date and split it. You'll still have leftovers. I'm not a huge pork chop fan but...WOW! This pork chop is unbelievable. All that being said, the restaurant itself is still fantastic as well. Whether for a nice family dinner, corporate outing or date night, you really can't go wrong with this place. I did finally branch out from the pork chop one time and had the Filet. One of the best steaks I've ever had. I've never had a bad experience or bad food here. Everyone I've ever gone with pretty much says the same thing. The service is impeccable and the one time they took a little longer to get us a side dish out they were unbelievably apologetic and comped it for us. It's a little pricy but it's well worth it if you're looking for a nice night out!

They have a great happy hour menu that includes multiple cocktails for $7-$9 dollars and then very reasonably priced wine. Along with this menu include 6-7 food choices that are very reasonable as well. This particular night, my husband and I shared a bottle of wind (1/2 off), shared the pork chop bites appetizer, he got the pizza and I got the ahi tuna tartare. The tuna was perfectly seared and served with fresh wontons and a sauce that was to die for. We got out with a bill under $80. Pretty impressive for a nice meal and multiple options plus a bottle of wine. The service is always impeccable and embodies true southern hospitality. If it's nice weather, I definitely encourage you to  sit outside (first come) and enjoy the perfect patio. If it's cool, they have awesome fireplaces on the patio as well."}, {"review_id": "X8RYOcTl6Nm7rwQvcNj5kg", "user_id": "vFQAO1E8-x-ktfWu-BlX3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "My husband and I went to Perry's for our 3rd wedding anniversary, and it was an incredible experience! We had been before, but only sat at the bar and had a relaxing evening. It was a great experience that encouraged us to come back again! So glad we did.Our table was arranged beautifully with candles and rose petals, and some champagne was already chilled and ready for our arrival! Our server, Chase, as well as the manager, Suzanne, provided exceptional service to us throughout the meal. It was the perfect balance of friendly, helpful, and dedicated attentiveness while still allowing us to have an intimate and enjoyable meal.Our oyster appetizer was prompt, fresh, and very tasty! Our main courses were well-advised and incredibly delicious. Such generous portions meant we left very satiated, and had some scrumptious leftovers for another meal the next night! Our meat entrees were cooked exactly to our specifications (medium rare) and seasoned and served perfectly. My husband ordered the rib eye, and I the lamb. We also really enjoyed our sides of lobster macaroni & cheese, and grilled vegetables.The wine list was extensive and very interesting, and the cellar master exhibited great knowledge of his wine book and made a perfect suggestion that satisfied both of our tastes and complimented our main dishes. Our dessert plate was extremely tasty as well, and ended the night on a beautifully sweet note.Thank you SO much to everyone at Perry's for a very special 3rd anniversary- it is so rare nowadays to have a perfect experience at a restaurant, and you all truly nailed it!"}, {"review_id": "CI7HpZVv__r-6Z0Selei1Q", "user_id": "3mQdD2lXvekRme1VlFxRuw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "We have been wanting to come back here for some time, but something always kept coming up. Well, we finally had the opportunity last Friday and were not disappointed. We were promptly seated. All the staff were very friendly to us, esp our waitress.We got the Fri lunch special pork chops (their specialty). My wife had the potatoes, and I subbed them out for seasonal sauteed vegetables. We also ordered a side of fried asparagus topped with crab meat. A VERY good decision. It was delicious. As far as the pork chop, it was simply delightful, and everything I remembered it being from the last time we are at Perry's. I know some people think pork chops aren't that high quality, but that's just simply not true with the way Perry's make them. Neither of us were able to finish our pork chop, so we got it boxed and ate it at home as another meal over the weekend. We also made sure to get some cheesecake, which we ate a few bites there and had over the weekend as well.Thank you to Perry's for a great meal and excellent, friendly staff."}, {"review_id": "LmgqWh_a8isUDyRf8TWEuw", "user_id": "8svmy_vNtHGphj380sgDRQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "I'm so late writing this review but I like to think about my experiences and I just write my reviews when I can just relax and let it flow truthfully and naturally but enough of my rambling let's get to it.I made a reservation so when we arrived we were seated immediately and this is a big plus because I hate waiting lol.  This is a really nice romantic and intimate place. The lighting is perfect and the wait staff is very knowledgeable of the menu and I really appreciate that. Definitely a date night type of place. For the appetizers we tried the Fried Asparagus and it was great. Really crispy crust but they didn't overcook the asparagus and the Lump crab was succulent. I could have used more sauce but still great. I just had to try the famous Pork chop and I'm so glad I did. It really exceeded my expectations I mean wow and all I can say it please go try it. I also had the Field Greens, Pear and candies Pecan salad and Au Gratin potatoes. The salad was delicious and fresh and just perfect and the potatoes were so tender and cheesy with a nice crust on top. I could hardly eat any of my food because my Mom and girlfriend were all over my plate. My girlfriend had the Crispy Skin Wild Red Snapper with chive whipped potatoes and a truffle vinaigrette. The fish was great the skin was so crispy and the fish was cooked to perfection but the chive potatoes was a no go. The waiter did inform us after the dinner that we could have substituted those for the whipped potatoes so I will keep that in mind my next visit.My Mom had the Pan Seared Sea Bass with creamy corn and red pepper coulis. She didn't even eat her food there because she was so full from the appetizer and my pork chop but I did try the creamy corn and it was so fresh and and it was creamy but yet still crunchy from the fresh corn. She did eat it two days later and she said it awesome. I can't wait to visit Perry's again and it's going to be hard for me not to order the Pork Chop but I look forward to trying something else."}, {"review_id": "rYB43FYXPg0NaCJFgtkysQ", "user_id": "fkQw-LB8FS5vvUlq_ZwvZw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "Hubby and I came here for their Friday lunch special of pork chops and mashed potatoes.  The lunch special cost less than 1/2 of the dinner portion, but still provided plenty of food. Although the restaurant appeared to be busy as evidenced by the number of cars in the parking lot, we were seated in the main dining room right away in a booth that gave us a good view of the restaurant. Sam was prompt with getting our initial drink orders and Bella was our waitress. We ordered a dinner portion of their Brussels sprouts with sweet sriracha sauce to share. I found this dish to be delicious but slightly too salty for me. Hubby got their 3 martini sampler which he thoroughly enjoyed. We saved room for dessert - the Dessert Trio (Vanilla bean crème brulée, chocolate crunch and praline cheesecake). Each was a small portion allowing us a bite or two. We had enough leftovers to eat for dinner. Bella was friendly and informative, providing great service.

I love the classy feel of Perry's. From the outside bar, to the inside bar, to the dining room, they have done an amazing job with their space. The ambiance is both inviting and comfortable and keeps me wanting to return. We stopped in around 3pm on a Friday to take advantage of the pork chop lunch special. We did not have a reservation, but were quickly seated in the dining room. The chandeliers are remarkable, the dining chairs are exceptionally comfortable, and the wine room is great eye candy. Drinks: Craft cocktails are pricey ($15), so I opted for a glass of wine (still pricey, but more reasonable). Salads: I had the warm spinach and bacon salad which was simply delicious. Warm, salty, and sweet. I also had a bite of the Cesar salad, which was also delicious. While it wasn't as unique as the spinach and bacon salad, I wouldn't hesitate to order it on a future visit. They also serve warm bread with the salads and the butter is worth writing home about. Entree: I had the pork chop (lunch portion) and it was perfectly delicious - smoky, well-seasoned, and substantial. I believe the lunch portion is 4 fingers high, whereas the dinner portion in 7 fingers high. I had a difficult time tackling the lunch portion and took at least half of it to go. (I think the lunch portion is large enough to share.) The lunch portion comes paired with whipped potatoes and apple sauce. The potatoes were a nice consistency and the sweet apple sauce was a fantastic compliment to the salty meat.  Desert: I wish I had the opportunity to savor one of their decadent deserts, especially since I had the opportunity to see the Bananas Foster being prepared for the table beside us, but the salad, bread, and main meal were more than I could handle. Service: It was not as hands-on for lunch as it was for my previous dinner experience, but it was still top-notch.   Overall: I highly recommend this restaurant for a fine night (or afternoon) on the town in the great city of Birmingham."}, {"review_id": "gYKmYmpQIHCk3kUCOkNxxQ", "user_id": "jZTR-5gwO8Y_kbAwv99sqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/30/2017", "text": "Treat Yo Self.I came here Friday afternoon for their pork chop lunch special. We didn't have a reservation but were promptly seated. Our server was very attentive and checked on us throughout our meal, so service is excellent. To be honest, besides the meat, I think my favorite thing was the bread. Freshly baked, warm, delicious and paired with fresh butter. Among the top 3 breads I've had in my entire life. I ate a whole loaf by myself. And the butter is so fresh, sweet and creamy. For lack of a better analogy, it tasted freshly churned butter straight from the cow's udder. 10/10 would overeat again.So the pork chop was described to me as \"4 fingers high\" for the lunch portion and \"7 fingers high\" for the dinner portion. Which isn't my usual unit of measurement, but in layman's terms, the lunch portion is the size of your face and the dinner portion must be the size of your whole head.The pork chop was delicious, I picked it clean. The mash potatoes were okay, good but not life changing. The apple sauce was fantastic! I don't usually like apple sauce, but this one was spiced and very flavorful.Overall, an excellent meal and excellent service !

Kese throughly enjoyed it. It was eye rolling good. The fried asparagus with crab was better than I remembered. It was flavorful and freshly cooked. Omg it was everything!!!!!The Salmon I ordered cooked medium and it was medium in the center and a little too well on the ends but not worth sending it back. The mashed potatoes and veggies were perfect. I enjoyed both our meals lol. I love that the GM Suszanne stopped by the table to say hello and greet us when I gave the waiter my complimentary card.

Sheena was nice and not overbearing as I enjoyed my meal at the bar. I really enjoyed the pork chop (didn't need a knife to cut as it just fell apart). The apple sauce was a nice complement and the potatoes were delicious. I also ordersd the grilled asparagus which was well seasoned but next time I will stick to the sides offered during the lunch hours. Since I was there, I inquired about the room and Sheena was able to have the sales manager to come out and introduce herself. Karrie was nice and able to answer my questions and give info for me to look over for the possible booking. This place is nice. I love the set up and it helped that today is sunny and beautiful.

I've been waiting on this! It took me 2+years before dining at this gem that was introduced to the Magic City recently. After hearing mixed reviews, I was skeptical of dining here. Thinking that it would be just a fad and a temporary hot spot like so many that've come and gone....... WRONG! Terribly Inaccurate. Perry's has the ultimate dining experience dialed to the Tee. Complimentary Valet, swanky dining spaces and a wonderful House staff (Thanks Taylor!). With me being a first-timer at Perry's, as suggested I ordered the Pork Chops! These are Not the ones you've known since you were a kid- But Perry's rendition of one of America's favorite cuts. Indeed, it is an American[size] Cut at 3-4 Bones being the Lunch Portion alone. Upon my initial bite I was introduced to one of the most flavorful, divine, and tender slices of meat that I've ever had! The meat maintains flavor throughout, not a dry piece anywhere. In fact, I didn't touch my beverage the entire time( at least for 10 mins). The caramelized cut is accompanied by mashed potatoes and Apple Sauce, which round the dish out very well! I also had the Fried Asparagus which is bathed and fried in a nice thick batter and sunken by jumbo Crabmeat...... :) Of course with it being my first time, It was necessary to conclude with an item from the dessert Menus. I selected the Rocky Road Bread Pudding- which wasn't anything less than exceptional, From That Toasted Marshmallow on the Top, through that Bread Pudding to the pond of caramel sauce with the pralines...  Woooo!

We had received some coupons to try the place out for their Friday lunch. I have eaten here a couple of times for dinner and everything was satisfactory. This time it was a catastrophy. We arrived at the end of lunch around 1:00. We were seated at a 2 top in the bar area. nice and cozy. Our waitress took our order for the Friday lunch special, the pork chop. My wife got the side of mashed potatoes and i chose the grilled spinach and an order of the creamed spinach. After a while (30+mins) our food arrived. However the creamed spinach did not. I took my time expecting it to come right up and kept an eye out for our waitress but she and my spinach were no where in sight. I ate slowly, over another 20 mins and finally our waitress showed up and i told here that i had not received the creamed spinach I  had ordered. She apologized and said she would get it immediately. So I stopped eating and waited. after about 10 minutes another waitress showed up with my creamed spinach. So I started to finish my meal. I took a good fork full of creamed spinach and put it in my mouth ready to savour the flavour. But no I was not going to get to enjoy it. It was ice cold fresh from the refridgerator, they hadn't even taken the time to microwave it. When our waitress returned again I pointed it out and she insisted on bringing me another order of creamed spinach. I reluctantly acquiesced and waited. By the time she returned with hot spinach I was way past eating. So we asked for a go box. I wanted to give them another shot and thought desert would be an opportunity for them to show me what they got. So we ordered the bread pudding and a flambe desert the Mont Blanc a la Frisc. We specifically told the waitress that we had to be somewhere at 4 and it had already been almost 2 hours. We were assured it would be no time at all to get our deserts. Again we waited. Finally the waitress returned and said the bread pudding was no longer available. I substituted the cheesecake. Then the flambe desert showed up. It was a nice presentation where the waiter flambed a butter rum sauce for the ice cream. One thing that was disappointing was that he only made about a tablespoon of the sauce and it barely covered the top of the scoop of ice cream. And yes no cheesecake. When we finished the flambe desert our waitress showed back up and we told her the cheese cake had not showed up. We said we couldn't wait any longer and needed the cheque.She returned with the cheque and the cheesecake which we were not be charged for. However we were charged for everything else. We left the restaurant around 3:20. Luckily the place we had to be was about 1/2 a mile away.It was also disappointing to see the floor manager pass our table over a dozen times during this fiasco and not once did he stop to say a word to us. I was even sure to make eye contact with him on 3-4 occasions. But he managed to greet and converse with all the other tables around us.
