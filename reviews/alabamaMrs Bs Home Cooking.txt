But let me tell you I'm glad I convinced them to go in....because what's inside made all that go away!This place has some excellent home cooking. Was passing through with my friends heading back home to TN and found this place on Yelp so decided to give it a try. Definitely a great choice to stop and eat. If I'm ever coming through again I will definitely make it a point to stop and eat again! Sweet tea is just the right sweet, chicken baked or fried is so juicy with every bite, corn bread is the perfect flavors mixed together, green beans have tons of flavor and the fried green tomatoes are just like my great grandma made them and JUST as crispy! Anyone should give it a try!!!"}, {"review_id": "h3nRIlU8zlZnYY7bn411nA", "user_id": "YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "The outside is pretty intimidating, or you might say, very encouraging that you will find some real down-home cooking inside.Mrs. B's is located in an old house that remains one of the only non-abandoned properties on her block. No matter, she seems to have been serving soul food, cafeteria-style since at least the 1980s, judging by the pictures on the walls.The soul food is solid, if not amazing. Everything is already made and sitting out...has a medium-dirty feel. Mrs. B has good lunch specials, and it's popular with the lunchbreak folks because it's fast.Overall, Mrs. B's is a Montgomery icon and worth a visit, but I'm not clamoring to go back."}, {"review_id": "oCnzPYBSfdxrwryCQLmTvg", "user_id": "9fb1LjsbTz_YT81CJLTBRg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "This place is not bad. I had to try it twice before I could be convinced that it was good. First time I came, I got the fried chicken and mac and cheese and sweet tea. Ehhhhh, I probably would've given this place a 2 after that visit. The chicken wasn't juicy- and seemed a bit overcooked. The Mac and cheese and similarly dry and didn't have too much flavor. The only redeeming thing was the amazing cornbread. The sweet tea is VERY VERY sweet. Like, TOO sweet. My second visit was awesome. I had the friends chicken again, the collard greens, and the cabbage. OMG, it was good. The chicken was juicy and flavorful, the collard greens and cabbage had a great flavor without being too salty. I got half sweet bad half unsweet tea this time- perfect choice. I'm guessing the first time was a fluke because I thoroughly enjoyed my second meal. I really wanted to get some of the German chocolate cake...maybe next time.  The price is right- a meat and two sides with a drink will run you under 10 bucks. People are friendly always coming by asking to refill your glasses."}, {"review_id": "Gxjr4YYVlxp9hnkFvRIAoQ", "user_id": "6FySm4PdV3NGSpxUCCJhBg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "Following GPS directions we turn onto the street and see our destination. \"Oh Hell No\" I say to myself as I look around at the abandoned and dilapidated homes nearby. My wife says it out loud, \"umm, should we keep looking?\"It's the third stop after judging two other books by their covers, and this one at least has a porch with tables so our patient puppy doesn't have to be alone in the car. We throw caution and preconceptions to the wind and go inside. We are warmly welcomed. We are a little ashamed at our initial reluctance based on appearance. The place is full, and I mean every table, has Air Force uniforms seated inside. It smells awesome. \"First time here? Let me show you how we do it\"I'm so glad we walked through that door. A couple dozen cafeteria style choices. Southern comfort everything from meatloaf, fried chicken, pork chops, greens, okra, mashed, gravy, veggies, fried green tomatoes, and outstanding mac&cheese.Lesson learned. It was delicious and every single customer coming or going said hello to us on the porch. Some stopped to pet our dog.

That does not mean that it's bad, just do not expect a modern day restaurant. It's closer to going to grandmas house (with more seating).  Once you climb the steps and walking to this restaurant you immediately feel at home. The kitchen is down the hallway to the right and that's where the line starts in a buffet style setting.  There was plenty of seating in the other room and when we went the restaurant was not very crowded.The ladies on the buffet line we're very polite and happy to see us. They were also very happy to explain to us the menu and made great suggestions. Unfortunately, the lady taking the money was not his cordial and seemed very preoccupied with something else. Honestly, I felt like I was bothering her.Now to the good part! The food was delicious and exactly what I would expect from a down-home soul food restaurant. The only thing I didn't particularly like were the collard greens (crazy I know), but they were sweet and had a strange after flavor.  Other than that everything else we got was on point.I would definitely suggest this restaurant."}, {"review_id": "rENkbETYMzydSuabAk7vZw", "user_id": "Vz_Ks3h7n3VfZHvfbgf8yg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "The food was decent, the German chocolate cake was good, but the lady behind the counter had such a horrible attitude.  My friend and I were very polite, even tried to make small talk and she was just plain and simple rude.  I spoke with couple of other people we knew that visited the restaurant the day before and they had the same experience with the service.  I'm giving it 2 stars because I just don't think the place is worth the business when they lack BASIC customer service."}, {"review_id": "yhlJumYbcEeH-R35UkHiHA", "user_id": "hBDSqW_S4qsQdeLFC2Usug", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Some of the best Soul Food ever.  BBQ Ribs, chicken and fried chicken all were great but the sides were simply incredible.

I only wish I lived in the same state and I would for sure make weekly or monthly visits. I had the best fried chicken I have ever had, EVER. The seasoning was delicious and it was fried to perfection. That, along with a big ass delicious portion of mac and cheese and another big ass delicious portion of some sort of casserole which I cannot remember at all what it was... Regardless, anything you choose will be great, I'm sure of it. The restaurant is actually a cute little house. When you walk in you make a right to choose your food and place your order, and then you cross the hall to the left where you find the dining room. You pay immediately after you order so you're able to just walk out after you're done.
