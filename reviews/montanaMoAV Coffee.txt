The space itself is big and open with cool seating arrangements, decor and the old-school roaster in front. Definitely inviting for a place to sit and do some work, meet a friend or just have a coffee. The coffee quality itself is great. I usually stick with a 4-shot espresso and it's not sour, overly bitter and just the right texture. Barista set up the machine properly. Lattes are served with some quality art so that's always a plus. If you're hungry, they do have made-to-order breakfast burritos that hit the spot! They are not overly large and are perfect to go with a morning coffee to start the day. I do wish there were more outlets around the space other than the long bar table with the outlets hanging down, but that's just a picky patron wanting more and more. If you're in Billings, this is definitely a great spot for fantastic coffee, awesome service and a place to chill or get some work done."}, {"review_id": "0kjlmMXaTYqSaTszotr9sQ", "user_id": "cnKtDF1kjrZ2XBbMR6_3Ww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Vibe and coffee are .

My husband had a cold brew, our two boys had \"BabyChino's\" as we call them or steamers, and I had a cappuccino. The drinks were all so good, that it was a sad moment when they were gone. We travel a lot and try a lot of cafes and it is rare for us to find coffee this good! Excellent steamed milk, smooth shots, great flavor, prices and quantity. The atmosphere is very clean and trendy, but comfortable. The customer service was very kind and knowledgeable. And easy 5 *****, do yourself a favor and try this place out."}, {"review_id": "4BPncuv_Zx5D65uLaFk52Q", "user_id": "xqYQsS_MRjJr_D2_7VxeEA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/23/2017", "text": "Stopped in after my flight landed in Billings and again a week later before my flight left. Everything about this place was great: Delicious espresso and refreshing black iced tea. Cool furniture and (while I was out in the mountains) they added more outlets at the long community table which was a necessary improvement! I really like the location downtown and the seating variety. Indoors, outdoors, couches, tables. Plus they have beer and wine. I would be a regular here if I lived in the area. Thanks for the hospitality, MoAV!"}, {"review_id": "QVWNaNSnIa9EJg55ivyQCg", "user_id": "lzaPQuYsfePfNzXtHZ0xvA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/4/2017", "text": "They know how to make espresso drinks. (the fact that this automatically deserves five stars is a rant for later... or my previous frustrated reviews). Great atmosphere in a classic looking older building, great staff, decent menu of food. I got the breakfast burrito and it wasn't anything mind blowing or super unique, but it hit the spot for a filling bit o protein and was perfectly crisped on the outside and warm and melty on the inside. They've got a nice well rounded light menu of food and ample space (as well as a shady patio) for book reading, working, or chatting with friends. I was delighted to find this spot and wish I had more time to stay and relax."}, {"review_id": "s4N8N4Dv0oxYLjnIArmeNA", "user_id": "v6jFwfUfxFco8mpMPeLeuw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/12/2017", "text": "Absolutely world class.
