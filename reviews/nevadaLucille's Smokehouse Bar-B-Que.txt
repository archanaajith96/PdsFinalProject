The sweet bread they bring you is just to die for. And let's not forget the Mac n cheese and mashed potatoes!!! To be fair, I don't have much BBQ wisdom so I don't know what to compare it to, but it's pretty darn good to me. This place makes for a nice summer date night. Keep in mind, if you bring your whole family, the price will add up quick. If price isn't a concern, there's bound to be something for everyone (...except for vegans maybe??)

I wasn't thrilled. First there was a long wait for my order (even though I came after the time they said it would be ready). Then I had to ask for biscuits, which delayed the order even more.  Then I asked if there was BBQ sauce in the bags and they said yes.  Got home and there was none.  We had the BBQ tips, baby back ribs, fried shrimp and catfish combo, gumbo, and tri-tip.  Tri-tip was dry (would have been passable if they had included the sauce), bbq tips were just okay.  Shrimp and catfish were greasy (they aren't in the restaurant), gumbo was very tasty, and ribs were the only real stand out/worth the money item."}, {"review_id": "k7d2UwYPAk8QkXuciGJtHw", "user_id": "l--K3xQWVqs93iFhAoEYag", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "I've heard so many great things about Lucille's over the course of the years. Finally, I happened to be in the neighborhood, so I stopped to check it out.The food was great and the meat was juicy and flavorful. It was an awesome bbq experience. The place itself has a very cozy and homey feel to it. Yoshi, our server, was very nice. Plus, we could see the smokers from where we were sitting, so that was cool. However, the food was so sugary, which I know is to be expected from bbq, but I felt like going into a sugar coma or laying down for a nap after our meal. Plus, it was pricey! I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again.

You can't even get through the door and the smell of their massive smoker (located in the middle of the main dining room) will sneak up on you.Coming inside, by how it is decorated, it feels like you are at a friends house. The servers are very attentive. They were table side instantly to get our drink order. They also helped us navigate the menu to find the option that would satisfy best. The portions were large. One of our people had a large plate of ribs, smoked in-house. I tried the burger. Both were flavorful. There are three options of sauces on the table that each added a special little zing to the meal.

The atmosphere, ambiance, and location of this restaurant makes it amazing! The food I thought was delicious, it was above average BBQ food I've had, but wouldn't put it in \"wow that was to die-for category\". I got the tri tip sandwich with potato salad for a side. The sandwich was HUGE so I was able to take 1/2 the sandwich home for left overs!For appetizers, I tasted the friend onion rings, fried green tomatoes, and fried okra....all amazing!

We were by the kitchen and the cooks were Latino...soul food, you need an old black man named Sam and his white side kick Jack from Mississippi to show the youngstas how it's really done!Well, service was slow and they were not busy...this was on Good Friday when we went...dont think we will be going to this location anymore. Gonna try Red Rock to see if better...love Red Rock because they do play dig in the crates blues music...Best part of meal was tri tip with the au jus sauce...oh, AWESOME!

I will preface this review by saying that Lucille's was very busy last night which could account for some of the issues I perceived.My family and I got to Lucille's after 7:00 PM. It was so crowded it was difficult to even get in the front door and to the counter to put us on the list. I gave them my cell number so we could be notified that ours was the next group to be seated. There is a screened in front porch with some bench seating which we took advantage of while waiting. It did take a while but I do not believe it took even the 25 minutes we were quoted. Maybe 15. We were then taken all the way to the back for dinner.I already knew before arriving that I wanted a tri tip sandwich and a half order of fried green tomatoes. I got garlic mashed potatoes for my side. My step mom ordered a fried chicken sandwhich and my dad ordered a brisket sandwich and a dinner salad. While we waited for all of that we were brought a basket of biscuits and apple butter. It was all very sweet but good. Then came our sandwiches. No salad. No fried green tomatoes. I asked about them and they were brought a while later. My dad was going to turn down the salad since it should have come before the meal but he took and ate it anyway. As did I with the fried green tomatoes.As far as taste, quality and freshness go, the potatoes were good. Lumpy fresh potatoes complete with skins. The tri tip in my sandwich had good flavor but was dry. It needed a healthy dowsing of BBQ sauce. Original I believe. The tomatoes were good. Fried perfectly crisp. A bit of a sour note from being green. It was the sauce I did not care for. I don't know what it is but it reminded me of Burger King's onion ring sauce. I could have done without a plate full of it. Maybe a side of ranch dressing instead.I love the smells here. And the rustic theming of the various kitch filled dining rooms is cool. Service is friendly though maybe a bit spotty in certain aspects. Food was not disappointing but could have been better.  But again, it was good enough that I would gladly go back again.UPDATE - Somebody from Lucille's has reached out to me about the issues I have addressed above. They wish to make things right. It is unecessary and, as mentioned above, I do intend to return at a later date. With a future experience to come, my hope is that the improvements I seek are made and I can update my review to a higher score. In the mean time, I should clarify that the server, I believe, removed my dad's salad from the bill as an apology for it being brought after the sandwiches. That along with the PM from the restaurant's management team go a long way in strengthening their customer service score. It is worthy of a half-star bump up to a 3.5 rating which I cannot make known in the actual star rating. Hopefully you are all reading this far to know so."}, {"review_id": "rZeShZIQyZn6l5UgS6zNpw", "user_id": "yt7ezMS3EUuXQoKBByWzjg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "I will say four things.  Order the smoked tri tip.  Use their Memphis BBQ.  It's excellent!  Servers were sweet hearts."}, {"review_id": "YG7kjh9E-TvuJ4YSg5ls3w", "user_id": "fj-cFMD2qheCcv3FNvMcEg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "Craving some bbq? Lucille's is a great option to try to satisfy those cravings. This location is located in the green valley district. On the left side of the district if you're turning in from green valley. Parking is easy and a short walk from the entrance. Green valley also has shopping available! What I love about this place is you can get all your classics here- brisket, burnt ends, chicken, ribs, etc, and the flavor is just so good! They also start you off with some bread w apple butter. Don't skip out on that. Prices are pretty reasonable, and the serving size is really good!

Looked it up and they had one of the best happy hours around so we decided to give it a chance. We got here around 930 and it was pretty packed. The waitress seemed to be slammed but being in the industry we were more than ok waiting.We ordered a couple of drinks from the happy hour menu and decided to try the mac and Hesse, spicy bbq bites and the deviled eggs.Let's start with the deviled eggs. Nothing amazing but well prepared and seasoned. The bacon on top truly sets it off. We gave these a steady 4/5. We had asked for water and some corn bread. Took nearly 30 minutes to get it. Every time our waitress looked at us she had the whole \"doooohhhh forgot to get that for you\" look on her face. Poor thing was really busy.To it disappointment the bbq bites were just cut up chicken tenders. Sadly they were dry and only flavor on them was from the bbq sauce. Have to give these a 2/5. Lastly was the mac and cheese. It's a bacon cheddar mac so once again it's hard to screw up. The noodles seemed dry. Almost like they had made this batch way early in the day and it was just thrown into the the microwave. Drinks weren't bad for the price and neither was the food but overall stick to the regular menu and fork out the extra money for the babybacks."}, {"review_id": "4MNYqQlXGYcSmn5pGyOfaw", "user_id": "b_E-lEajG2XDTotFLmVOuA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/7/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Don't get me wrong, I like Lucilles...

It is very good, don't get me wrong, but it is not unique or original. If you want the best BBQ you will not find it here. But, it is super tasty for what it is and we like it very much.There is only one that I know of in Nevada and it is this one in Henderson. The rest, I think, are around Los Angeles. Lucille's has a large menu and a great children's menu. I actually love the kid's menu and could just steal from our grandson, but I order the pork ribs and he tends to steal those while I eat his penne pasta with butter sauce. It is great, no kidding.Lucille's has great biscuits and we love their onion rings. All the meats are quite good and you really can't go wrong. The service can be spotty and they need to work on that, but for the most part the service is friendly, and pretty fast. It can get very crowded and I personally would not wait to eat here, so we stick with showing up early for lunch when we are in town.Have a great time."}, {"review_id": "Bw8yXQOlv_wZM-ouzALBSQ", "user_id": "Bmn3g0gKsOcG7c0WWRE_xQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Food was mediocre.

The Mac and cheese was a little dry but it was not terrible and the corn on the cob was pretty good but it did not come with any butter. My daughter had the tri tip and Mac and cheese and she loved her tri tip as well as her root beer she ordered for dessert. My aunt had the same thing as me but she had rib tips and tri tip and greens and Mac and cheese.
