My husband and I have been going for years, and we are continuously - and happily - surprised at how consistently delicious these tacos are. We're a big fan of the pulled pork taco, which is especially fabulous and fresh during lunchtime. Bring cash - it's $3 a taco, $5 for a bowl of tortilla soup. Although the latter is a bit salty, it's the best kind of treat. The parking isn't the best, so make sure to park town a side street, and don't block any driveways :)"}, {"review_id": "JUZH2R_3KwPcLQR4srF4zw", "user_id": "TKCHM6c8o3tHj346BBG5tw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "We were in town for a conference and had one lunch free to explore the local area and when I saw how much everyone loved Mas Tacos, I knew we had to skip the fancy Mexican places and try it out. It's this bland, unassuming place from the outside with bars on the windows but from the time we got there (at 2pm! Well after the lunch rush) to the time we left, there was a line with at least 20 people in it outside. It's popular with locals and tourists alike. The inside is dark and a little divey, with a bar area and the main room and another windowless back room that smelled a little weird for us, but they have enough seats for you to scarf down your tacos and plantains. There's also a small covered patio that they were decorating for Cinco de Mayo while we were there. They pump out tacos, plantains, horchata, and Cuban black beans like a machine - calling names over the loud speaker and leaving you to grab your own water and bus your tables when you're done. Someone told us they used to be a food truck before they opened the restaurant and then have continued expanding. There's hot sauce on the tables and some escabeche (spicy pickled carrots, onions, jalapeños) on the counter. All tacos are $3 and include tax. CASH or check ONLY but there's an ATM inside if you forget. I wasn't too hungry and ordered the Cuban black beans with plantains ($5), and the vegetarian taco (quinoa, sweet potato, cabbage, sour cream, tomatillo salsa, $3). The black beans came on a little plate or bowl and were hearty and creamy and good but could have used a little salt (nowhere to be found). The taco was good and fresh and filling, but not flavors that blew me away - I think the meat and fish and fried avocado tacos are really the way to go so I'd get those next time. The guy behind the counter taking orders was so busy he was not able to be friendly but the the guy announcing all the order names had some personality and added some nice pizzazz to the experience. I really love the ambiance and focus of this place - such a food-centered restaurant that is totally worth the wait."}, {"review_id": "hwwy3fNZDVkmfILkV0flbA", "user_id": "AIl9sw7-mrjXv8htu5hIMg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "My girlfriend and I got the worst diarrhea​ ever after eating here. Ring-of-fire level. We had to go to the bathroom at the same time and had to tag-team the toilet. Do you have a mental image of that? Think about that before you eat here.

With the oh so popular The Pharmacy burger and beer parlor right across the street, I couldn't help but notice Mas Tacos! The line out the door let me know that this was probably a place I needed to check out!I decided to go the next day and I'm so glad I did! As soon as you walk in you get a \"just having a quick bite at a friends house\" type feel. This place is very divey and hipster. You can tell it's all local college kids and within minutes, I could tell why they chose this spot! After about a 10 minute wait in line I reached the counter to order! The menu is written on the wall so you know exactly what you want prior to reaching the front of the line. This is genius as it helps the line to move faster.I decided to order the pulled pork tacos and of course I had to have ELOTES!! (You know, the corn on a stick with cheese, mayo and all that other bad for you but oh so good stuff?) yeah that's the one! This establishment is CASH or CHECK only. They do have an ATM if you are not prepared. Seating is first come first serve and extremely casual. You got hot sauce on the table and a roll of paper towels. That's it! Received my food within minutes and let me tell you, I've NEVER eaten tacos so fast in my entire life! These tacos were sooooooo good and the corn was amazing also! If you are ever in Nashville be sure to put this baby on your list! You won't be sorry. You can thank me later.Hours of operation for Mas Tacos: Monday-Friday 11am-9pm Saturday 10:00am-9pm Sunday-closed"}, {"review_id": "Yvbz-gTBUI0EBhCib1m6cQ", "user_id": "cTEZ1wR0Z8PA4GJQl4NzdA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "One of the best meals we had in Nashville and for a great price! We came for a late lunch around 2:00pm and there was a short line outside the restaurant.  It seemed to get longer as we stood there, so it was good we got there there when we did. They have a super simple menu, and is cash only, although there is an ATM onsite. Once you order, grab a seat, and wait for your name to be called over the speaker.I ordered the avocado taco and the pulled pork taco and the elote (street corn). My hubs had the pulled pork, carne, and chicken tacos. We also tried the fried plantains for dessert.  My favorite was the fried avocado taco! I think our meal came to just over $20, which was also one of the cheapest during our trip. Most importantly, everything was fresh and delicious.  It's a bit of a hole in the wall spot, but many of the best ones are!"}, {"review_id": "WH4hyw5a6Ada8r-MBAKEHg", "user_id": "yiYAbxOdApOtnxR9ORpmKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "Overall 4.5Tacos 4 stars, Sides 5 stars This place has been on my \"to go to\" list for a long time. I finally went on a Wednesday in February. We got there at about 3:45 in the afternoon, so there was no line and Most of the tables were empty.The tacos were good, but not mind blowing good. My favorite was the pulled pork and spicy carne (beef).   I didn't care much for the chicken taco, as it was more like a pulled chicken, not charred or grilled.  The fried tilapia taco was decent, but my wife did not like it.The side dishes impressed me the most.  There is a fried plantain with sweet cream. It's basically slices of fried plantains with something like condensed milk drizzled on top of it.  The black beans with plantains were satisfying, with just a hint of spice to it.   The Elote roasted corn (cheese, spices) is a must get. We went on a Wednesday, so they also had tamales. It was decent, but nothing to write home about.The interior decorating can best be described as somewhere between hole in the wall and eclectic.  You won't feel scared though.In the end, worth the visit.

No longer and never again. We attempted to eat here tonight, line was apocalyptic as usual. We were unwilling to rough it and went up to the bar. My fiancée ordered a beverage and asked if they'd also let us order food; the bartender told us that they only would if we were seated, and all the seats were full. My fiancée said she understood and asked the bartender to scrap the drink order. I went to the bathroom. When I came out, my fiancée told me that as she waited for me and was scrolling through her phone brainstorming another food option, she witnessed the bartender taking a food order from the next customer. That was enough. If Mas Tacos were in a real city it would have shuttered after being open for 3 months, (sorry if you have any illusions about that), but given that it's here it was quasi-worth the wait.

Easy menu, simple pricing, and excellent food.We tried all of the tacos and elote (northerners see this labeled Mexican Street Corn). The spicy carne was indeed spicy but not overly so, cast iron chicken was juicy and shredded easily (just like the pulled pork), quinoa and sweet potato was unique but felt a little flat on seasoning (could be because of all the highly seasoned tacos we were also enjoying), and my personal favorite was the fried avocado because of the extra crunch from the batter and the burst of flavor. All are served inside 2 grilled corn tortillas with lime. Waited in line for a bit but found a table easily and food came up quickly.

Perhaps it is the vibe that sells people, because for me the food could never do it.The tacos were average, the drinks were way overpriced, and the service did not impress me at all. I am from Houston so perhaps I am more judgmental than some, but I have been trying to find a great taco shop here in Nashville. I have no desire to return here and fight a crowd when there is another taco shop not far from here that literally blows this one away.I live in East Nashville and I do love when places have a hipster vibe, and enjoy this part of town immensely. That might sway me a little bit, but the food has to be the focus regardless.As always your experience may be different than mine, but I was literally considering giving 2 stars, the vibe actually did sway me to 3.
