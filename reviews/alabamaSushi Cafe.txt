We shared the emperors boat for 4. More food than we knew what to do with. The only thing that is disappointing is when you spend $100 and it doesn't come with soup AND salad. Just one or the other. We ordered an extra roll, which we didn't need, but the Texas roll was incredible too!!! Only thing not pictured is the seafood salad. I would have recommended more fish than lettuce. That was a little disappointing, too. The service was excellent and they give military discounts. That's a bonus. Also didn't need reservations for a Friday night."}, {"review_id": "Pk00A_47FsBKj5czmnpjaw", "user_id": "az7f2PRMTsBC5cmSZPYs9Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "First time trying this place!

Excellent service from the moment we entered the door. This place is clearly a local favorite as the place began filling up shortly after we arrived. Luckily we got in early enough that accommodating our party of 7 was a non-issue.Husband started with Tuna Tataki and I started with Seaweed Salad. Both excellent choices! Husband and I shared four rolls. Daniel's, Texas, Black Pepper Tuna and Bagel. I ate all but the Black Pepper Tuna, because tuna simply isn't my favorite. Husband enjoyed that roll. I enjoyed the other three rolls very much! Texas and Bagel were my favorites! I'd definitely recommend checking this place out if you're in Montgomery and craving some quality sushi!"}, {"review_id": "tUrBH4mbwzCFD16yWJ12_g", "user_id": "j_dGXsx7REN27oXQS-n_JA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "I'm always happy to go here, customer service and food are high quality.

The Daniel roll might be the most popular sushi roll in Montgomery. Their fried rice is on point, I always get mine with extra eggs. I usually don't do reviews on places that I frequent often but I thought it was time.

I would say they have the best sushi in Montgomery. I typically stick with the \"pick two\" sushi option at lunch, although I have gotten their Bento Box before and not been disappointed. There is typically a short wait at lunch. However, they do a good job of getting you seated in a reasonable amount of time. They take orders promptly and are good about getting you a drink and keeping it full. Food comes out quickly, but it doesn't look like it was made in a hurry, and, as well as people get moved in and out, I never feel rushed.They have the best shrimp tempura roll I have every tried. Sometimes I just order two of those and am happy."}, {"review_id": "0CT_ww1urD5Prv6gR7Beow", "user_id": "2AcCXL9RaiZ2gRC8UxVUXA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "Great sushi, great appetizers.

I went to school here in Montgomery so I used to be a regular. Just late with a review. In town for a graduation so I HAD to stop.  They are true experts for the lunch crowd. Its usually pretty busy here but the staff does a great job getting you in & out. Whether it's dine in or to go. I usually get a Bento Box or the amazing Daniel Special Roll. My favorite Bento Box is the Beef Bogolgi. Its seasoned really well with all sorts of spices especially garlic. Its very flavorful. The Box comes with a house salad, your choice of meat, white or fried rice, orange slices, & a 2 pc California Roll. All under $10! Now I will admit that the fried rice isn't the BEST but the sauce they give you on the side ( especially if you get the beef) makes up for it. Now about the Daniel Special Roll....it is unbelievable. The moment you dive in to devour it... the mountain of crab, shrimp, & scallops topple down. Like seriously. Its packed with so much REAL seafood that it's an entire mini meal of it's on. I always get full. Now this is a cooked & fried roll but it's awesome. Topped with spicy mayo & eel sauce. I get excited every time I eat it. If you're looking for some great fulfilling sushi & a delicious Bento Box. Come here. Its fast & the food is good!"}, {"review_id": "aXLjfIV50PAc2TAdhLumkA", "user_id": "uIWCTuYIq8K-BV9H0Uyz4g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/17/2017", "text": "While visiting Montgomery for a work trip I stopped by this place based on other Yelp reviews and was not disappointed.
