Such a cute atmosphere and excellent food and drinks.Ambience: wood paneled bar with mix of couches, benches, scattered two-top tables and some tables for large groups in a dark setting with overhanging chandeliers, a large bar and unintrusive mixed top-40s playing in the background.Drinks: had super generous pours of a Cote du Rhone flight (3 glasses) for 12$ that were quite varied and delicious. My mom tried an amber from Bozeman which she enjoyed immensely.Food: I was so impressed by the food here, especially for its price. Coming from Seattle, everything felt like a steal. We had citrus beets and beef tartare as appetizers. The beets were cooked just enough, paired with chunks of richly flavored cheese (kinda like brie but more firm?? Couldn't recall what it was) and bits of tangerines chopped over it. The beef tartare was incredibly tender with a beautifully runny poached egg and deliciously crisp chips. I was not a huge fan of the mustard since I don't like the taste of mustard but it was very well balanced. We also had the wagyu ribeye which was a lovely dish overall, though I wasn't that impressed with the actual ribeye steak. The slightly spicy, charred cauliflower, the sweet potato puree and tart mystery green vegetable (tasted rather like saurkraut mixed with pine?) were wonderfully paired together. The ribeye itself, which we ordered medium rare, was beautiful but tougher than expected of wagyu ribeye. More work of chewing than desired. Truffle and herb butter on top was ridiculously delicious, I would drink that stuff if I could have it all the time.Overall: outstanding dining experience and food for a very reasonable price. Would come again if I was passing through Missoula."}, {"review_id": "PSmHgXWl6SuNbhz-Z-Qi7A", "user_id": "ygX2X8VZbFXPZQlsyH1Kdg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/21/2017", "text": "Eric was a great bartender to us a couple of weeks ago.

Nice swanky place. Various art decor through out the restaurant. Best to make reservations. Service was friendly and quick. Speciality cocktails weren't bad. The food was good but overprice for MT.

So we stood there and waved down another person who ended up being our server.  The only table left was a corner table that appeared to have difficult access.  The guests next to us were rude and didn't really help the situation when we politely asked to get through.  So, needless to say the first part of our experience was dreadful but very contrary to the wonderful meal and service we finally received.  I would have written a scathing review if I walked out.  Thankfully the chef is a genius and other staff made the night better.  So just FYI-- no reservations unless you're a large group and it is seat yourself."}, {"review_id": "8SC5wlbYYGs1UOM54GxPgw", "user_id": "ez64nH6syIVIwOdhiMBtmg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Drinks are over-priced!  Food is meh!  Can be noisy, but also can be great atmosphere.  The upstairs deck is lovely!"}, {"review_id": "X1MSyn_AydLyKGO9X7ZfZA", "user_id": "n7DO0CFsVgmcXPUI-b9_MQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "In town visiting for a wedding and tried out Plonk on a recommendation from our hotel staff.

Plonk could be the closet thing to wine heaven you can get in Montana. Amazing selection of wine, great craft cocktails and they have a ridiculous happy hour. This happy hour is a thought out selection of wine, cocktails and small delicious bites. The GFB is a must, they only serve it during lunch time and happy hour, but it could be the best burger I've ever had. Along with a rotating selection of inventive, fresh, and tasty dishes. I always feel like it's the best meal I ever have when dining here. I love that they strive to serve up local, beautiful, and semi healthful dishes. Enjoyable service, the bartenders and serving staff are knowledgable, friendly, and fun. Plonk is a perfect place for after work drinks, date night and an outstanding dining experience in Missoula.

We had just driven all the way from Wyoming, had looked up reviews in advance and were set on visiting Plonk first thing we got to town (which turned out to be 10:45pm). Super easy and free to park right out front! We knew we needed food, and were not sure how late the kitchen was serving on a Tuesday night, but our lovely hostess assured us that we had just entered happy hour and there was a whole separate late night food list that looked fabulous. SO HAPPY at that point and we hadn't even had a drink yet! Then after chatting with Ryan for a min- and he is SUPER knowledgeable- we decided it had been too long since we've had proper manhattans. And oh, did they deliver! I am pretty sure it's on my top-ten-drinks-I've-ever-had list. Ryan recommended his fave Bourbon for mine, and I was so tired I can't remember the name... Then we got all the food. Falafel x2, personal Ploughmans, pork steam buns (after all, we were making apps into dinner). Big, bold flavors, very satisfying, a nice price for happy hour in such a charming and upscale location. Apparently, they also have a rooftop patio, which we didn't get to scope out, but we will next time we're visiting for sure!Places and experiences like this remind us of our favorite spots back home in the Twin Cities-thank you for being an oasis in our long day of driving and for serving so late. That downtown must be so happy to have you. Hope you are always busy and making allllll the coins!
