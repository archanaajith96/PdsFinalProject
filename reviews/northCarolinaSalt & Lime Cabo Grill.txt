I chose the original, corn and the pineapple jalapeño. All of them were very bland in taste and tasted the same. The only difference were the small toppings it came with. The pineapple jalapeño seemed like it could've been a lot better if there were actual jalapeños in them. Overall all of them were very tasteless like mashed avocado with zero seasonings. If the chips had some salt on them maybe the whole bland guacamole would've worked but the chips had no seasoning on them either.For the main dish I ordered the seared tuna tacos. It was so horrible I couldn't even finish it. After finishing one I tried to eat just the tuna since I didn't want to waste food but I couldn't. They had a very strong fishy taste to it and the overall flavor of the tacos did not go well together. I ordered a second margarita, basil lime and I wished that I hadn't. I wanted to give this place one star, but the service was ok and the presentation of the dishes were nice so I gave them an additional star."}, {"review_id": "4TmmiysDmFwYGeZc8wsOLQ", "user_id": "w_bxh4jOEvbLOsHhsN_fpw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Great shrimp tacos Chips and salad I good tooFast efficient service.

The wait wasn't too bad honestly for a Friday night -- it was maybe 25 mins. The peeps at the host stand were so friendly and it definitely made my day. The service is awesome here but the highlight is definitely the drinks and food.The complimentary salsa that came with the chips was really good. There was a freshness and kick to it. Most restaurants have this \"kick\" using a lot of black pepper but I could really taste the spices in this one. What impressed me most about this place was that all the food was seasoned very well.We got the pineapple jalapeño guacamole to start out with along with the street corn. I'd definitely recommend getting the Santa Fe to start out with. That chipotle aioli on top with the catija cheese is fire!! I got the grilled grapefruit drink, which comes with a cinnamon sugar rim instead of the typical lime salt. It was really good. I couldn't taste the alcohol at all, which is probably a dangerous thing because I could've drank those all night. This marg was a little sweeter than some of the other ones on the menu. My girlfriend got the pineapple stinger margarita. If you're not a fan of spicy things, definitely avoid this. Although this marg did have pineapple, it was a very savory marg in comparison to the grapefruit one.As for the main dishes, the surf and turf burrito was HUGE. I had leftovers to take home. The best part about this was the meat inside. The grilled shrimp and marinated steak were some the best I've ever had from a Mexican restaurant. It was seasoned so well and not bland. The shrimp wasn't overcooked and the steak wasn't tough at all. All of the other toppings weren't overwhelming either like many other Mexican places that use things like beans and onions as filler. My girlfriend got the Chile braised pork. It was very tender to the fork and didn't require a knife to cut it. Although it's not advertised as fajitas, if you're looking for a fajita like dish, this definitely a good choice since it comes with peppers, onions and tortillas. This place has great service with a wonderful staff. This is definitely a cute date spot. The well-seasoned food is definitely a plus as well as the drinks. I'll be back for sure in the future and hope to try some of the other delicious sounding/looking options that they have."}, {"review_id": "sHa1ZfhM7VxAD5T0pirmsw", "user_id": "u9nxfg8iUrkoCl6UE7OrSQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "I haven't come across a restaurant with better ambience, excellent customer and extraordinary food! This is a must go for every lover of Mexican food. They have plenty of vegetarian options for people like us.We had the serrano guac, Chile relleno and the veg quesadilla. Each was fantastic in its own right. My husband and I shared the Chile relleno as we weren't sure of finishing it individually. But it came really light on us. But we were mighty hungry and hence went for the quesadilla. It had predominantly a lot of red peppers and great quality of fresh mushrooms. We loved every single bite of everything.

Where do I begin? Lets start off by saying how nice the staff was and how fantastic the Mexican ambiance was. I went with a coworker and we were fortunate enough to sit by the performer they have for the night. The man was great with his guitar.Our waitress is the MVP for being so courteous and friendly. She came to our attention when needed and got things ordered pretty quick. Food time: I started off the order with a FREE order of queso with a check-in from yelp. The queso was so warm, spicy and tasty and went perfect with the free chips they bring with your salsa. I ordered a skinny margarita which was perfect in accompanying my Mexican dish. I couldn't leave without trying the corn with the cream, I'm a huge corn fan and this corn passed the test, fantastic corn! I went with steak fajitas which were cooked Medium Rare as requested and was devoured almost as soon as was set on the table.Im happy with the service, ambiance and quite frankly everything about the place just makes me want to come back and try more things!"}, {"review_id": "DxGT8S8cLUVXZrYiTTakiw", "user_id": "NWNXlZGUd3JxH_E3MYqCDw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "I had  great time here!

Every time I go, I'm thoroughly satisfied with the friendly service & flavorful food. This is not your typical 'Mexican' restaurant.

You can't go wrong with tacos (jerk are my fave) but today I tried the steak fajitas w/ grilled shrimp! OMG. The steak was so tender, onions & peppers were perfectly seasoned & sweet.

We met at 3:30 and grabbed a seat at a booth in the bar area. The happy hour actually doesn't start until 4, but we decided to just grab a drink and some queso to wait it out. Unfortunately on Fridays they don't have any drink specials, but they do have their $5 food specials. They do have great drink specials on other days of the week, but not Fridays or Saturdays. My friend ordered the Basil-Lime Margarita and I ordered the Island Sangria. Both were very delicious. Although I like basil in food, I was a bit apprehensive about how I would like it in a margarita, but it was great! Very light and flavorful. We shared queso and, of course, the chips and salsa. Their queso is yellow queso, but very good and full of flavor. The salsa had just a hint of spice which was nice, but not overwhelming. I like really spicy food so I couldn't definitely handled it being spicier, but I appreciated the flavors. When 4:00 came around I ordered the Cabo Rolls. Now I am highly addicted to nachos so it was definitely hard not to order them, but our server suggested to get the Cabo Rolls over the nachos and I was not disappointed. They were amazing! They were fried perfectly and full of great flavors that all complimented each other. The spicy ranch was the prefect dipping sauce.I will definitely be back to try more of their menu!"}, {"review_id": "MVwoONC9Ej9drxnGoQBhPQ", "user_id": "cfMgTfD4TkPhjdTd6OfYCQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "Delayed gratification. I was in the area after getting my hair done and swung by here to get lunch. I walked up to the restaurant already knowing precisely what I wanted, got to the door and saw a closed sign. Nooo! Not easily deterred, I tried again a month or so later. No sign on the door this time so we were already off to a good start. First, they have churros, which are delicious. Exactly the way churros should be - crispy on the outside, and soft and pillowy on the inside. The churros came with a caramel sauce which I found to have a slightly bitter aftertaste, so after a couple bites I ended up eating the churros by themselves. However, without having the sauce they felt a little dry to me. I wanted something like ice cream or a sauce for some moisture. For the meal (because I couldn't just go for churros - well, yes I could have), I got their Jamaican Jerk Tacos.The tacos were wonderful. The black bean rum sauce that they served them with was really good and the chicken was cooked well. I didn't feel like anything was missing in terms of flavor or ingredients in the tacos. You get three which is a good value. Oh and they serve the tacos with plantains. My only gripe is there weren't more of those because the plantains were good. Overall, I'd come back here again if I were in the mood for tacos or churros (if they had a different sauce). They also had some other menu items that looked good that I'd like to try."}, {"review_id": "0a0YKnK4dXYqzOCo6eOmZQ", "user_id": "Wq6d4tbQRvQWF0gAeAdm9A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Food is pretty good.

Came here on a Thursday night and got seated without any wait.The decor and lightening is definitely inviting yet intimate.I enjoyed their house margarita to start and we shared some Serrano Guacamole to share. Was on the spicy side but enjoyable. Now for the entrees. I can't speak more highly of my choice. I went with the Chile Relleno and added the short ribs. It was absolutely delicious. The short ribs were smoky, with hints of coffee, and very tender. The Chile was filled with perfectly roasted veggies medley and quinoa. The black bean puree surrounding the chile was very savory and a great compliment to the rest of the dish. Boyfriend got the Cabo burger with the sweet potato fries. Although I wouldn't call them fries due to the size they were delicious. Crispy, sweet, with a wonderful chipolte sauce that compliments very well. Overall would definitely return.

They have 18 margaritas to choose from, and they range in price from $7-18. My first was the Basil Lime which was pretty amazing; my second one, a skinny margarita, was not nearly as good (in fact, I didn't even finish it). My husband ordered Desert Fire, which was nearly perfect. I didn't think there was enough tequila in any of them - I like to taste the tequila in my margaritas. Overall though, some of the best I've had dining out. It's a decent serving, and each one is made as it's ordered.The chips and salsa were tasty, and the four of us went through 3 baskets! They have five guacamoles to choose from. I ordered the traditional one, and I was not impressed as it was pretty tasteless. I ordered the classic fish tacos, and while the overall flavor was good the fish was over-cooked. My husband ordered the Island Shrimp, and again it was overall good, but he thought it didn't have enough jerk flavor, and would have been better if the shrimp had been grilled. The side of black beans were exceptional. I wish they served elote corn.The decor of this place is spot on, the owner was present working and helping the entire time we were there, the server was fantastic, the bathrooms were clean, and the prices were decent.

I've always heard such great things so I figured it was about time we checked them out. We went in on a Tuesday evening and were seated right away. The menu is diverse and you can immediately tell it's Baja Mexican, super fresh and light. The interior is nicely decorated and perfect for a date night spot. They have a small outdoor patio as well if you'd prefer to dine outside, or they also have a few outdoor tables on the sidewalk at the front of the restaurant. Our waiter came over and offered to bring some chips and salsa which we opted in for. On the menu they have a bunch of different salsas you can opt to upgrade to. Thought this was a neat idea if you are looking for something different like a roasted pineapple salsa. For my meal I opted for the tomato and avocado salad with salmon. I will say the photo they posted on Yelp of the salad is a bit misleading since the actual salad has much more lettuce than depicted. Nonetheless the salad was still tasty, but it almost felt a bit too healthy. I regretted not opting in for some queso. My husband got the short rib tacos and loved them. The meat was tender and the flavors were delicious. We didn't take a look at the dessert menu, but I'd be curious to try that the next time around!"}, {"review_id": "kIW6p4ySJbE3oijn_UwtKg", "user_id": "cOCEICLhbkWB3X-N-VUX9g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/13/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The girlfriends and I went today for lunch and arrived about 1:20pm.
