No reason to look at anything else on the menu - seriously. They're that good. Okay, okay, the menu is overall solid but you get my point? Order the chicken in waffles. Also, make sure to come hungry. The food is fresh and doesn't save that well so I recommend you clear your plate. You need to show up really early or fashionably late to the brunch game, otherwise be ready go stand out in the parking lot and wait. I wouldn't recommend showing up with a party of more than 4 unless you're okay to split up into groups; the restaurant is very small and you can't really \"combine\" tables. Inside is a cool atmosphere. Weird art scattered throughout (i think you can buy it if you want?), and the good ole diners, drive ins, and dive evidence spray painted on the wall. Overall very solid brunch choice (personal charleston favorite) 10/10 would recommend"}, {"review_id": "_BcuF5l2dU5d-Wujsr6mpQ", "user_id": "pUJksR1jtg1bSr6Psneu_g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "We were visiting from out of town and came by this place and really enjoyed it, the food is fantastic. So you may be wondering why I'm giving it Two stars well first visit was really great and service was super, that and the food is the reason I couldn't give one star.  Well the second time we came in it looked like it was closed it was only 9:10 pm and the website said it was open until 10:30 pm. Google says your open until 10:30 pm and yelp says your open until 10:30 pm.  I sent my husband in to see if they were open the cook said yes come on in.  Well the server who's name I swear is Ihatemylife started to fuss but I guess the cook is in charge.  I just ignored her as having been in the service industry before know the feeling But.... (here comes a tip ihatemylife) I would take my butt to the back of the house and air my displeasure there and not in front of the customer.  So Ihatemylife takes our order and she is very lucky I wasn't paying attention as I would have told her about herself (you know northerns have no shame) My husband tells me she threw down the menus and started complaining about what we ordered and how long it would take (according to her 20 minutes)! And just so the cook knew she had opened that morning  and she wanted to make sure we heard too as my husband heard everything.  His blood was blooding and didn't want to give her a tip.  (Another tip Ihatemylife). Don't treat the people who pay you like crap in ear shot of them.  The only reason you got 5 bucks is in case you pooled tips and it wasn't fair to the girl who was sitting there to punish her for your bad behavior. Had you been pleasant to us it would have been 25 to 35%  Ihatemylife aka  A Lauren don't work doubles if. you don't want to be there.  And if you have to be mad at yourself from being in that position not the customers.  And tell the owners to change the hours on the website, google and yelp!  And owners get more pleasant servers like we had on Saturday night and dump the dead weight."}, {"review_id": "_sVpdvOtzcxOim6SNN_z4w", "user_id": "fRrzNbgjavrgHYrdFU0ohw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "So like most places that I hear really great things about, I expected Early Bird to be overrated. Sure, basically everybody I've heard talk about it has great things to say...but I just generally assume there's something negative or overhyped about the place. Not the case here. It's your classic diner (albeit with limited parking) with counters, booths, and a flat top griddle. Nothing special there. The menu has all your usuals: bacon, eggs, biscuits, grits. Everything you expect from a breakfast place. More on the food later, but FIRST - this place is a little expensive. I'm opposed to any place that can't include a side with a plate...like just give me some grits without paying $3 please. But ANYWAY, the food. It's delicious. I got biscuits and gravy with fried chicken (a la Charleston Nasty Biscuit) and it was all good. The gravy was a little underseasoned, but whatever. Everything else was good. The main event, however, was the classic breakfast. Perfectly cooked bacon, super seasoned home fries, and two (possibly four) perfectly scrambled eggs. The real draw were the grits on the side. If you've never had grits before, this is the place to get them - buttery, creamy, just gritty enough. Good spot, even if it's a little pricey for breakfast food - I'm not even mad. Check it out."}, {"review_id": "Q5hemT5aeUhWq_E0V2ohPg", "user_id": "wwEV66BaaGIiXerjrPMziQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "I usually get the Country Scramble which is eggs, sausage, cheese, and potatoes scrambled together and topped with sausage gravy. It's amazing. It also comes with toast/biscuit and a choice of one of their sides, of which there are usually 10 plus options to choose from. I like their fruit salad, it's very fresh, and a good mix of fruit; not just sad pieces of mushy cantaloupe like most places. I wouldn't recommend the fried green tomatoes (which is rare, as I love fried green tomatoes); they just don't really taste like anything. But that's the only thing I have a problem with at Early Bird.My new favorite thing is the fried pork chop with pepper jelly. It's fried perfectly to a crisp and is seasoned excellently. The pepper jelly gives it a great amount of depth and tanginess and it's a great mixture of salty and sweet."}, {"review_id": "jx3FMhRxRNTr0hLvof2zCA", "user_id": "XWoOSix6OvYyz7EuwvnPdA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "This is easily one of my favorite places in Charleston! Can we just discuss the Chicken & Waffles for a moment please ?! This chicken is ENCRUSTED with pecans and fried to golden perfection!  But the waffle ... the WAFFLE is is made with cinnamon ;) and its so fluffy with its perfect square holes to house the warm maple syrup! I literally just eat and dance in my seat because it really just feeds your soul!  Lets talk board specials! When it is available a must try is the Grilled Pound cake and it comes with a side of ice cream..You choose the flavor! and let me tell you these aren't your ordinary Neapolitan  flavors! I actually don't like ice cream (i know *Gasp*) but this is creamy goodness in a cup! The Honey Lavender and Nutella are my fav's! Price Points range anywhere from $6 - $18 There's also local artwork on the walls that are available for purchase which is honestly pretty cool to see locals supporting locals!"}, {"review_id": "KpFJBKHolPI-d8-46C9mnQ", "user_id": "h6EI4BfNvc_vJUH3O8vNBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "I made my way here after a night of indulging a little too much in a certain type of beverage. Lets just say I wasn't in an ecstatic mood and I had the energy level of a sloth on NyQuil. However, my mood was instantly uplifted by the delicious and comforting meal that I relished here. I ordered the country scramble which is essentially an omelet with sausage and potatoes, topped with pepper gravy. It is served with your choice of toast or a biscuit (go with the biscuit it is amazing) plus a side. I was torn between what side to order because they all sounded great but I went with the fried green tomatoes. The tomatoes were evenly fried and were served with a fresh remoulade sauce. The sauce added a nice tang to the tomatoes and helped to balance out the richness of the meal. Early Bird Diner helped turned my day around and gave me the energy I needed. The waitress made sure to keep my coffee full and took great care of us.

We listened to the other reviewers PRO TIP: Order the mustard sauce on the side. So spot on. I liked to do some \"dips\" without the mustard sauce so if it was served smothered I would've been sad. The sauce was delish! The gravy was a delicious surprise. The flour was cooked out and you could really taste the spices in it. For sure order the sausage - it's hand packed and seared on the super old griddle. Highly recommend this spot for breakfast and and an immediate nap after."}, {"review_id": "WoaYtlGRAI11Vmxb3qfMGA", "user_id": "KYAR9aJPK7WtE-tFrHHltg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/11/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "1/10/18Excellent service! Thank you Lindsay for being all smiles and taking great care of me! As the name implies, this is a small diner with some interesting decor. It can get pretty busy at times. Sit at a clean table, that's the sign at the entrance. I like that I can pick my own space. Monterey Jack cheese omelette: bits of heat from the cheese came through and I really enjoyed that touch of spice. The omelet fell a little flat for me and was slightly over cooked. Fruit side: grapes, unpeeled orange slices and strawberries. Fresh except the orange. It was a bit dried out and I would of preferred it peeled but no biggy. Bacon side: perfectly crispy! I ate every single bite of my meal. No heavy misses, and I definitely will return, just some minor preference issues."}, {"review_id": "cnxlfuGQL0MtwzDFdws-BA", "user_id": "GzxSwhkNNU7IKpRzJaxsyA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "Place is ok.  Not a lot of good vegetarian choices, but, what can I expect at quarter to 3 in the mornin in the South.

The food has always been impressively fresh. And I don't mean they cook it and then it sits under a warmer until the whole meal is ready, I mean they time everything so that it finishes cooking at the same time.  There are also wonderful choices for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner and dessert so whatever you're hungry for, they've got you covered.  Some things to keep in mind: The parking is rough. Combine a small lot with a happenin' place and that will happen. I've also pulled in a few times only to find that the restaurant is closed so make sure you check to see if they're open before heading over.  You don't know defeat until you crave EBD and then head over during their off hours.

I also saw that they serve breakfast all day, which is very appealing to me. It's located conveniently on Savannah Highway, but their parking can be limited if you're going on a busy day (like for Sunday brunch).     If you're going to go for brunch, definitely get there right when they open. We got there at about 10:15 and there was already a half hour wait, but the wait was definitely worth it. I got the corn cake benedict, which was phenomenal. I got it with the salsa instead of the hollandaise and I think that was the right choice to brighten up the dish. I also had a bite of their famous chicken and waffles, which lived up to the hype.     I also went there for dinner and I got the ultimate southern comfort food, a big ol' pork chop with collard greens and mac and cheese. The pork chop was the size of my head and fried to crispy perfection. There are so many options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner that I could probably go back here 50 times and never get the same meal. I also wouldn't break the bank, because their prices are very reasonable compared to the rest of Charleston.      This place is no fuss diner food and the atmosphere matches that.
