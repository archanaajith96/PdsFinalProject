Still, the Burritos of the Week are innovative and I highly recommend experimenting with them. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Cali Burrito is one of the highlights of the West End. Along with Loan's Vietnamese Bistro, it's one of my weekly restaurant destinations. Their tacos and burritos are delicious. I highly recommend the San Diego (fish taco), or the Big Sur (steak burrito). But literally everything is great. The \"I Can't Believe It's Vegan\" chili is some of the best chili I've ever had. The queso is also amazing, though they only offer one rather large size. The fresh chips may be the pinnacle of the meal...everybody grabs the flour chips, so you better be fast. The guac is meh...too smooth for my taste, and it reminds me of store bought, even though I'm sure it's house-made like everything else. Perfectly fine as a component of another item, just a little weak on it's own. Still, you can get a small side of guac for about $2.50, so make your own evaluation. The only flaw Cali Burrito occasionally falls victim to is a slight monotony of flavor and texture in some of the Burritos of the Week. It's rare though."}, {"review_id": "myLK7IOvSxXH1yrsWGzoPg", "user_id": "_9ATn3iuyOzGYD18ljpj4w", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Not to happy went to Cali burrito today to get my wife a taco. She has the pregnancy food urges for tacos. So I came here today I ordered a Sonoma and myself the big sur burrito. Well I get home with our food and they gave me the wrong tacos, I don't know what the hell it is but it ain't the hamburger meat and cheese taco, it was chicken. And the chicken was still like pink, and my wife cannot eat that because it's not cooked all the way through. So now I have to run and get her something else, since I'm 25 mins away from the restaurant. Disappointed. Never had a problem here EVER"}, {"review_id": "vnonkIpHCTIvGQXL5RXdiQ", "user_id": "SgPXWJjA9IBHgVOqGnP3QQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Flavors are good. However, I tried the Newport burrito which is mango shrimp with basamati rice, red cabbage and curry sauce. The mango shrimp was actually the little baby shrimps packed on with too much breading and there was no mango flavor at all. I expected it to be grilled shrimp and not baby shrimp at that. Also, I've been here twice and both times I felt like I was being rushed out. I understand they were closing soon but as soon as we walked in we didn't get a greeting. We got a \"just so you know we're closing in 5 minutes so it has to be ordered to go.\" Okay, thank you. I'm doing fine by the way, thanks for asking. And I guess we most have memory loss as well because we were reminded as soon as we ordered at the register that they were closing in 5.  Oh, and $10 for two little tacos? Ridiculous."}, {"review_id": "K7B-d_gm-TzAeopoV-SFaw", "user_id": "ncV3D4quNNIzM4_AiISRbQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "Super fresh ingredients, obsessed with their chips and salsa!

Good food but horrible customer service!You would think with a 8 person order they would understand you are on a lunch break and could pack up some salsa so you could run in and leave to make it backto work, well no.We were told they don't supply salsa we have to pack it up ourselves, the gentleman told me he would pack upSome utensils. We get there to pick up the order and the girl at the counter really snobby says no we got busy over there are the utensils. Then when we get back to the office and start handing out food, there is one order missing and one order is completely messed up. We call, we are told they don't deliver and won't make an exception.

Yikes! The parking and entrance of the correct location is a bit awkward. As other reviews mentioned, there is also only one cashier so you will be waiting a while. The other con is the burritos are a bit overpriced for the size (more expensive and smaller than Chipotle) and guac is $2 extra.That being said, I truly appreciate all of the vegetarian options. The burritos and complimentary chips were delicious and fresh. I had the Cambria because it included guac and I added pico de gallo and sour cream. Very flavorful and definitely satisfies a burrito craving."}, {"review_id": "ddsBTYpe0spxVsHmyK6NMw", "user_id": "StVO7vMhImwsnaoLVB0lLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Who wouldn't love Cali Burrito!  New location is much larger, nicely designed, same great food.  Love the Santa Barbara chicken taco.

The ample vegetarian options, which I really do appreciate. My husband ordered the Shasta burrito, which comes with seitan, and he loved it.My burrito, however, was less good. I got the Cortez, which comes with shrimp, and supposedly a \"zesty pepper sauce.\" That pepper sauce, though, was cloyingly sweet and tasted more like cheap tomato sauce. I definitely wouldn't get that burrito again. I also wish they didn't charge so much for all of their add-ons. The burritos aren't cheap to begin with ($8-$9) so when you have to pay $2 additionally for guacamole, it gets steep fast.I liked their chips a lot-- they are a mix of regular tortilla chips and something more like wonton chips. I wished I could have had a bag of just the wonton-style chips! They, along with the guacamole, were the highlight of my meal, which we enjoyed in the Cedar Creek Parkway just down the hill from Cali Burrito.

I got the ground beef tacos, which is two per order with nachos. I really liked the hard and soft tortilla shell combo, with melted cheese in the middle. The taco is filled with meat, lettuce, tomato, and some sort of chipotle mayo sauce. It was very tasty and reminded me of a gourmet chalupa. I tried the spicy mango sauce and the green pepper sauce for my nachos and enjoyed both of those as well.

So this is a personal preference post based on real Mexican food in Mexico, Texas, New Mexico and California.This ain't that.This is awful if it's supposed to \"Mexican\". Who ever heard of Thousand Island dressing slathered in a beef taco? Yep. Fast food national.taco chain doesn't do that. Cool for some. Folks, this isn't Mexican.The hard taco shell is a fried flour tortilla. Come on. Hard tacos are made with corn. Normally. If this measure my only dislike, I'd have said nothing. Other places do use fried flour tortillas but it's uncommon.Salsas. Green, mild, hot, something veggie. Anemic. Where's the capsaicin? This is likely regional. Still, making a bottle of Tabasco available really isn't how it's done.The natural acoustics is the dining room is atrocious. The noise and echo is deafening. Hang some sound absorbing materials on the walls, please.People like it. Positive is, plenty of parking and portions are large.

I had my first visit to the new location and was not surprised to see the line out the door on a Friday night. Things moved very quickly so I didn't mind the wait, but was surprised to see the sort of poor organization of the interior given that the space is so huge.It seems like they could consider having the line wrap around the large entryway. But I'll leave that to them to figure out! I got takeout so I didn't see much of the dining space.I love that Cali has always had the help-yourself salsa stations, and now they have 2! This is such a great feature. I hate when places try to limit my salsa consumption.I noticed that they've diversified their menu a considerable amount, with many new vegetarian options alongside the longstanding classics with meat.Two of us got burrito bowls while the other got some tacos, and we were all more than satisfied with our meals! Huge portions, and something for every pallet. Ultimately, the food here has always been wonderful, creative and fresh (most importantly).
