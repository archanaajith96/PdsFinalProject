Unable to decide between the plantanos or the yuca frita, I went with both, and I am glad I did.  Everything together took me back in time to pleasant memories of growing up in West Tampa.  While, I seldom order dessert, I make an exception here for the tres leche.The owners clearly understand the value of serving high quality food.  They remain dedicated to providing the best dining experience in Cedar Rapids, and I always look forward to eating here with clients when I travel up from Atlanta."}, {"review_id": "orjRsTxdqnoAp2TYpcehKQ", "user_id": "a1A7YpTIe8W1RL2EO37FIA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "this place is mediocre at best, their beans were tasteless, the rice was undercooked, the lechon was blah! what was even worse were the fried burnt crusties in-lieu-of fried yuca, that was the most frustrating of all! the owner had the nerve to actually put that refuse in aluminum foil and allowed me to leave the restaurant with that garbage and only when i'm home do i realize that i have garbage wrapped in aluminum foil and that i paid for it!!!  that is completely unforgivable! i cannot believe that this place actually has four and a half stars!! anyone who actually gave this place any kind of stars has got to be completely devoid of culture and completely unfamiliar with actual cuban food! this place is just gross!"}, {"review_id": "gxLTVOJ6IXRF7r07ebkeQg", "user_id": "9e6N6HUQBovQw9JL8NY4Vw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Enjoyed some authentic Cuban food, very basic, not much for veggies here.  Meat, rice and sides of yuca, black beans or Plantains.

I used to eat at this restaurant more than I care to admit when I worked a few blocks away (former life), but I haven't made it up to Cedar Rapids when they're open in a long time. On Saturday, everything aligned perfectly and I was able to make it in here for lunch. Of course, I ordered their Cuban, and it was just as delicious as I remembered it. The bread is perfectly pressed and crisp, the cheese is ooey-gooey delicious, and the dipping sauces brought it all together. I also ordered a pineapple soda to complete the meal (because, duh), and felt totally refreshed. They've changed the layout a bit since my last visit, and it is now more of a sit-down to order place, where it used to be set up to order at the counter, but I'm sure Yelpers who are closer to this place noticed the change long ago.I'm looking forward to a return trip in the near future. The service was wonderful and the food was just as delicious as I remembered!"}, {"review_id": "M22KQ_qhjs33ua9ne3XEpw", "user_id": "qT0E1ufS1BQqN42TmVSVaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Some of the best mixed drinks.

Sure, the restaurant looked a little grimey last time but the food and service were excellent. Fast forward to present day: It's a sunny Saturday evening in downtown Cedar Rapids, but this place - with a patio - is not busy. It's been recently renovated. They've added a bar(?) and the dining space has been updated. There appear to be 3 employees working and as I walk in, they're all GLARING at me. After they all finish dealing with the one other customer in the store, one of them seems to wander my way, all the while looking at me like she has no idea what I could possibly want. I tell her my take out order, but because I have a coupon she has to get the other two employees back to help her. The wait for my food was reasonable, no complaints there. But even handing my food, the guy was grouchy and almost shoved it at me. Like I said, we got our dinner to go and it did not disappoint. My plantanos maduros were way better than last visit. The Cuban sandwich was excellent as well. My boyfriend is obsessed with it. It's so simple, yet so flavorful. The bread! The meat! I don't really even like pickles, but they are crucial here! Just get it as it is - trust me. Based only on service, I would not go back. It felt like they didn't want customers in the restaurant. Unfortunately, I'm a sucker for delicious food... take out it is!"}, {"review_id": "yb5uuBr46iwEbjI6w_zL-w", "user_id": "j7Sne3JGsBdSOP9PNf7clA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The Mojo chicken is my favorite.

I've always passed this place by for the food court or the deli, etc , but never again! One visit and I'm hooked! When it first opened I wasn't sure about trying it. Never had Cuban food before and didn't know quite what it was. So I stuck with the familiar foods/places. I started hearing more and more how great it was but still never stopped. I always thought I might not have time. Or what if I didn't like it? Didn't want to feel unsatisfied going back to work.After continuing to hear others rave about it, I finally stopped in today. Oh, boy, I'm sooooo glad I did! I had the mojo chicken on rice with a side of the fried plantains. After the first bite, I could hardly contain myself from loudly exclaiming \"mmmmmm\". The flavor was amazing! The plantains were awesome as well. There were a couple of sauces on the table...tried them too. Between the sauce on the chicken and the ones on the table, I couldn't say which is my favorite. I love them all...an unbelievable combination of spices and flavors!!!I went at the middle of the lunch hour, it was busy but not too packed. Good service and my food came out quickly. Plenty of time if you only have 30 minutes for lunch. The air is filled with amazing aromas, and between that and the Latin music playing, it kind of felt like I was on vacation. I almost forgot I had to go back to work.I'm so mad at myself for not trying this place a long time ago...all those wonderful meals I've missed. You can bet I will make up for it now!"}, {"review_id": "8if5pOmxpuctUstSkxaaPw", "user_id": "xafcio5fGmE2iOR2GEalEw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2017", "text": "Was recommended this place by a friend from Iowa City. When I found myself in Cedar Rapids I decided to check this place out. I had the pulled pork dish, and my girlfriend had the shrimp special of the day. The pork was delicious. I had a side of plantains which were equally as delicious.For desert we shared the tres leches cake, which had great flavor, as well as texture. The bottom was soaked in the condensed milk, but wasn't mushy.The gitmo salsa also tastes great and has a surprising kick that comes on after a while.

We were told it was because they had a \"huge lunch crowd.\" That's great. But were you not expecting any in the evening? We also received two horrendously below average mojitos with old and moldy mint. When I gave them back and asked for fresh mint, they said \"we don't have any.\" Fresh mint was growing in the planter boxes next to our table out front by the street. Another huge disappointment, especially with regard to customer service - \"so do you want something else, or...?\" This review is two stars instead of one because the food we did receive was decent enough. But I'm never going back, and would never recommend it.Regarding the reply below: Sure you can push back on my review, but I wouldn't imagine you'd contradict my concern if I was sitting at the table speaking to you in person. About the pork, yes we were informed when we sat down, I'm just noting that it happened at all - which it shouldn't. And the mint was black and slimy - no way it was picked in a 24hr window. Wish I would have taken a picture. And if that's your front of house manager, my comment still stands - the hospitality wasn't very hospitable. I respect that you reply to your comments, but receiving them without rationalization would suggest that you appreciate all kinds of feedback, rather than just praise."}, {"review_id": "nC0cDLaTyEbwHAa7SZU0gA", "user_id": "4hbr2sflhq9WFmcVTM63kg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "7/5/2017", "text": "The food is incredible.
