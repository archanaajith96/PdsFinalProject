Today, I told myself \"no more excuses.\"Yes, I finally went to Greek Bistro. It's exactly what it says on the tin: a small Greek restaurant, hidden in a small strip mall behind Wildfire Casino and on the outer circle of the \"ring\" surrounding Sunset Station. I stopped in after 1:30 for a late lunch, finding a surprising number of tables occupied but with plenty open for myself. The blue-heavy decor is charming in its way, but I would probably not order dine-in here if I wasn't so concerned about eating freshly prepared food.[Rambling personal story warning!] I wasn't always as ambitious with trying unfamiliar businesses as I am now, and none of my friends ever invited me to try this place back in my first few years around. I finally did invite someone to try it with me around Christmastime 2015, but they had closed early on that evening, so I pushed it to the back of my mind again. Lately, I've found myself more and more frequently bemoaning the lack of great food on my side of Henderson, so I finally had to address one of the biggest potential counterarguments.The young man who greeted me was quick with asking for my order and surprisingly quicker coming back around after I asked for some time to think about my order. Truth be told, I was stalling to take menu photos, a challenge that became far easier after a woman who is presumably the owner offered me a to-go menu. This version didn't have the reflective plastic cover that their standard menu does, and prices were consistent. And the food was good, even great at times.I had the traditional gyro sandwich ($8.99) with fries, and the gyro was certainly one of the better ones that I've had to try. Delicious tzatziki and fresh lettuce, tomato, and red onions adorned the beef and lamb slices, which were still the star of the dish. The pita was solid, not exceptional. I was disappointed by the lack of salt in the fries themselves, which can only be covered up so far by the seasoning or by extra salt, and the surprising slight dryness of the fries' interior. The tzatziki was a fun dip for the fries though, and I found myself using the tzatziki to pick up seasoning from the bottom of the tray. That aside, I would order the small salad instead of the fries.Dessert was better. The baklava ($4.25) is a surprisingly huge square-shaped portion that's roughly 3 inches per side. I would not recommend taking it on alone, and I even ended up asking for a to-go box despite (or because of) how much I enjoyed it. When you break into the baklava, honey oozes out of the crispy fillo dough with a layer of crushed walnuts inside and a garnish of crushed pistachios on top. The flavor is somehow richer and more nuanced than other baklavas that I've had in the past. I was very wrong about this neighborhood not having good desserts, and I'll be sure to try their other sweets now that I know where to look.I also ordered a moussaka ($13.95) to-go. I hadn't had this dish in ages, but I'd always fondly remembered the eggplant and ground beef layered dish that I'd tried years ago, and this brought me back. Loved the spices in the moussaka as well as the side salad of lettuce, cucumber, red onion, tomato, and feta. There's an additional side of seemingly the same sauce that bathes the moussaka, and I wasn't sure what to do with it except just enjoy it slowly with every bite of the moussaka. The portion is a bit more of a huge lunch or solid dinner, so you might consider sharing it. Moussaka, baklava, and maybe an appetizer? Sounds like a great meal for two right there.Greek Bistro is an enjoyable restaurant that may indeed be the gem of this mostly chain-ridden side of town. I'll definitely explore their menu further, and I won't wait another 5 years to do so."}, {"review_id": "lMDHhnkNoTtidU3RjkP9_g", "user_id": "1Q3obmJ-SCfjm0goEzwUzw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "Hands down the most authentic am great tasting gyro I have had amazing flavor down the fries , everything is literally so good!!

So I never really tried Greek food before. I had just came from kick boxing near by and I wanted to eat a healthy salad and my mom suggested this place. As soon as I walked in the scenery caught my eye. It was so beautiful. Blue and white and there large pictures of Greece. My Goodness I suddenly felt like there was apart of me that was missing all along. It really made me emotional. Being part Greek and not knowing the first thing about being Greek started to frustrate me. I didn't know what the sauces were or Falafel  it all looked so good and it was hard to choose. The lady who served us was beautiful and nice. She didn't speak much to us but she was very sweet. When our food arrived it looked amazing. Everything was fresh and perfect. The olives they put in the salad is so good. That homemade sauce was so BOMB!! I'll try that place at least once a week or once every two weeks. I was so urged to take pictures. Weird memory though it kind of smelled like old mop water but it was when I first walked in. It wasn't that bad."}, {"review_id": "csmdLKiOnhzfcFX7dxR70A", "user_id": "c9x3hgURp2RNYSQMIx9I-g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "under new ownership and food is still good.  Gyros are our favorites.  They have redecorated it and looks much better except the chairs need foam on the bottoms.  Their dolmades were good but a little bland - and I would have preferred to have Tzakaki with them instead of the sauce they provided.  Our only complaint is that the waiter had on so much after shave it left a smell around our table that didn't go with the good.  That affected our rating!  Its great for lunch!"}, {"review_id": "tr2IQakTzM0KBp49hiLIFw", "user_id": "kFUEdbs8CvQI_-gsWU98eA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Excllent casual dining, delivery and take out option.
