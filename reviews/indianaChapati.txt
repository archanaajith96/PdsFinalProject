I ordered a combo meal: half chicken tikka masala and half buttered chicken that came with basmati rice, and chapati (it's kind of like a mix between a tortilla and pita). I then ordered a samosa which was only $1.60! It took a while to come out but WOW it was worth the wait!! It was packed with flavor and the portions were giant. I can't wait to eat my leftovers!! The servers were extremely helpful and polite and I cannot wait to go back."}, {"review_id": "P2tQrhQaxR1UkTpYmfvIcw", "user_id": "AHRrG3T1gJpHvtpZ-K0G_g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Two key takeaways:1.) The chai is the real deal....you won't find powder and an abundance of sugar over here. In fact, as I write this, I'm wondering if I should head over to Chapati for dinner tonight ----plotting begins...now. I also appreciate that they serve the tea in a somewhat ceremonial manner with sugar and honey on a small individual tray for each serving. 2.) The eggplant masala. I love all veggies but I've never been one to jump out of my plants for chow down on some eggplant...until now, that is. The eggplant masala is marinated for 24 hours and uses real peanut sauce (apparently that's part of the game changer part of this dish). Served with rice, even the die hard carnivores will love this smoky vegetarian dish. The onion seeds take it to the next level as far as texture goes. .........beyond the eggplant masala and made-from-scratch chai.....it's certainly worth noting that the overall experience is fun and educational. The staff is enthusiastic to share the scoop on the food (northern Indian/Pakistani) and the space is brightly colored and decorated in a fun way. They even have a pingpong board. They recently expanded and offer a private party area that can accommodate as many as 300 diners between the two connected spaces."}, {"review_id": "sYX5TiC_9tfaZaI1vougDg", "user_id": "XCydwvWxRidDyHKetxx8xw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Here's why Chapati has such great reviews: -Friendly service from people who know the menu well and will help you navigate it-Tasty food that's customizable with spice levels and combination plates-Restaurant is bright & colorful and follows theme (despite its strip mall exterior) but still manages to feel relaxed and casual. -Family owned place with an authentic feel.

The results...this is the most consist delicious food in Indianapolis! Hands down, drive out here and give Chapati a try. When you walk in, the restaurant is spacious and filled with vibrant colors that's representative of the culture. The walls are decorated with love and care for human life. The owners are super welcoming and helpful when explaining the menu and the authenticity of each item (cooked with love). I ordered the Lamb Biryani and my lady ordered the Goat Karhai and Chicken Tika-Masala (combo special). When it came out I first thought that I needed more food. I couldn't be more wrong. The amount of food was plenty. I would argue that one dish could be shared by a couple. Okay, now on to the food. Let me tell you something; the flair, flavor, spice (medium), all rolled into the rice and meat was so good that I wanted to take my shoes off, unbuckle my belt, then lay down on the community chairs. The seasoning isn't like any random fly by night Indian-Pakistani food...nah, this is exactly what it tastes like when on that side of the world. The naan (garlic please) is to be used to sop up the gravy. Listen...the naan is meant to sop up stuff. I'm a sopping fool. Okay, you can also use the naan to make a sandwich. I also make everything into a sandwich. Once you're finished eating and are completely satisfied with your meal, go and give them a high five. Don't kiss the cook, be respectful :) show your love and return here."}, {"review_id": "wm67NrF1gxCtU1t3zDhadQ", "user_id": "8TxlUss9Y9Yo3jGTyc81pQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "Absolutely the best Indian I've had in Indianapolis!!!  It's so worth the drive for me. We came here for lunch one day based on the Yelp reviews and were not disappointed. We've since ordered delivery through Postmates and guess what...back tonight!  The Chicken Tikka Masala is delicious!  Get medium spice.  The chicken is tender and flavorful!  Also, get the Goat Karahi. Tender meat and lots is flavor. Get the combo. It comes with rice and Chapati bread and you get to try two entrees from the menu. Great value. The portions are huge and will definitely feed more than 1 person. I take home leftovers every time. Come here. Order copious amounts of delicious Indian and Pakistani cuisine!!  Bring your stretchy pants! You'll thank me later.

We had never been and when we walked in it was much larger than I anticipated. It was also so well decorated and clean. I was very impressed when I walked in. Then we had our lunch, and I was again so impressed! We ordered the Chicken Boti and then the Butter Chicken and Chili Chicken combo. The rice it comes with looks so bland, but as soon as you eat it, you realize you are very mistaken. Tons of flavor in all parts of the dish. We got ours \"spicy\" which was perfect. You also could have picked \"very spicy\" or \"extremely spicy.\" We will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "LEEiZhUSEdUwaRV0GPvIZg", "user_id": "q0vzJWEVzXviVJwC8V7KQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Great Indiana & Pakistan restaurant!! My Indiana professor recommended this place to me. Great food! The combo idea is good. You can try at least two dishes. My favorite is the Goat Beets!! The beet sauce looks like tomatoes sauce and not taste like the beets I ever taste before. But it was really tasty! The aloo takari is good too, which is potato with some vinegar taste. The rice not only looks good but also taste good. The cons are there is only one outside service person who is doing both the cashier and waiter job. Luckily I went after lunch hours so not too many people there. Moreover, the table on the side of the ping pong table is really long. So we moved to the table below. Overall, highly recommended!"}, {"review_id": "ob9vFzIMnps__5gd0LdJCA", "user_id": "pzZpptEBG6Yc4eI6GeScow", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "It was my first time here and it made a great impression. They did a great job with the space; very inviting layout. Ping pong table, several table games, great music that is played with perfect volume to converse, etc. It's clear to me that they want you to enjoy your experience with them. I ordered the falooda ($6.99) and hot chai (1.50). The base flavor of the falooda is strawberry and the price point was a bit high but still very good for its rarity.

This isn't a place I would have tried on my own, so I'm glad that Yelp opened my eyes to it. Fairly large space with tables lending themselves to groups. Order at the counter, grab water from the water pitcher and wait on your food to be freshly prepared and brought out. We had a group of people ordered at different times, but the preparation seemed a little slower to me than it should have been. Fortunately there were a lot of us and we chatted until the food came out.I was happy with my dish, but it wasn't what I was expecting. I wish the menu was a little more descriptive, and I'm sure the friendly staff behind the counter would have been happy to have explained what I was getting, but I thought I knew and ordered like I had a clue what I was doing. That's on me.. not them.I'll check this place out again sometime when I have some time and can ask questions to make sure I know what I'm getting."}, {"review_id": "z3JWORJ0kqIsfN4fcD-dcw", "user_id": "lmpcXit9-SUoO89aBenCjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "I'm such a fan of this place! Service is awesome, seating is diverse, and there is something for everyone. My favorite thing is the Aloo Tarkari. It's vegan & runs about $9. Fresh potatoes flash fried in a wok with sliced tomato, cilantro, green chili, and onion masala sauce. Sometimes I grab veggie biryani. I go with the hottest spice level because that's my thing but most go for mid-heat. Great music, cool decor, and wonderful food.

Chapati is one of those reasons. Sigh.  Tucked away in the corner of the plaza just south of 52nd and Lafayette, Chapati is worth seeking out. The food is fresh and authentic (Indian, Pakistani, Middle Eastern), the staff is helpful and friendly, and the space is clean and fun.  Upon entering, we noted a ping-pong table and a few Carrom tables.  We were greeted and chose a table and encouraged to look over a menu before ordering at the counter.  I LOVED that the menu was broken down by dishes with meat, vegetarian dishes, and vegan dishes -- it made ordering easy...well, until you had to PICK what delicious meal to get.  Luckily, they offer half-and-half combos as well, so you can get a little of 2 things instead.  I would also suggest coming with a group so you can share and try a bunch of other things.  After ordering and paying at the counter, take a seat or spend a little time gaming.  The food comes out in due time and is TOTALLY worth the wait.  Everything we had was absolutely delicious -- from the Samosas and Aloo Chaat (Vegetarian) to start to the Mango Lassi... it was amazing.  I would go back for the Palak Paneer and Bhindi any day of the week -- but also really want to try ALL the things! Chapati makes me believe that Vegetarian and Vegan food doesn't have to be boring -- Thank you!So yes.  We will make the trip over to the Westside again soon.  That Palak Paneer is calling my name."}, {"review_id": "PlxBPhGoARTzSEOsS1fLOQ", "user_id": "Ju56oAC6N6ZKbXFWUPAaSg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Amazing!!

What? Where has Chapati been my whole life? This joint as stuck the perfect balance of old-school Middle Eastern cooking and new-school vibes. As someone who is Middle Eastern, I have a high bar for any restaurant that serves up food from that region. Chapati leaps over that bar and makes me feel like I'm eating my dad's cooking... But in much cooler looking digs. The menu is massive and has something for meat eaters, but even more for the veggies in your life.

I ordered Chana Paratha and I would go back and order it again and again. Additionally, I loved how you could customize your spice level. The only thing to keep in mind before going is that it will probably take about 15 minutes to get the food you order - this is because they make it fresh upon order. I will absolutely be back - to order the same thing or to try so many other things that sounded delicious.
