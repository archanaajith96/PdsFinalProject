I was expecting another overrated place but I was definitely wrong. I had the grilled ham and cheese and my husband had the machine gun thing. The machine gun had lamb sausage in it so my husband had to definitely try it. It was kind of sad looking because the bread, sausage, and frites  ratio was off. It was a tiny piece of sausage cut in two and packed with french fries. I really thought it didn't make sense but then again I don't know how much lamb sausage cost in salt lake. The grilled ham and cheese sandwich was pretty good. I was mostly impressed by the frites. They were sooo good and you could choose different types of dipping sauces. The frites were also good when I reheated it after a few hours in the microwave. I was in complete shock because I was expecting it to be lumpy but it actually held up!"}, {"review_id": "M-bqKvL6sfT_yY0F82r0ew", "user_id": "sZnw5T9Btu-2-Xg4SG6o2w", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/2/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I'm really not a fan. paying these prices for a waffle is just beyond me.

Their version of the whipped creme is amazing. Got a simple cinnamon waffle with the blueberries and creme fraiche (whipped creme) and it was quite Divine.

I'm not quite sure how they're made but they have a cake-like consistency, denser, compared to regular waffles and they're sweeter. Slightly crisp on the outside but really soft and cakey inside. Bruges does a really good one. Their other waffles are also very good. I enjoy their fries as well as they're made fresh everyday. We always make a pit stop here when we're in the salt lake area. It's a must!"}, {"review_id": "7FAhJGO0MLisup-VKTtQGg", "user_id": "x1v_jCLoRfnzsL_xFKtgzQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Waffles and fries, my two favorites in one place. It's a hole in the wall eatery with limited outdoor seating. The line is out the door cause it's so small, and the orders get backed up. My friend's ticket got skipped, and it took a while. I created my own waffle with Nutella, strawberries, and creme fraise. It was sooo good - served warm. Crisp on the outside and soft inside. They're generous with the toppings.   The burger was good with the crispy onions. The patty had a nice flavor but was a tad dry and small for the bread. There's over 10 different fry sauces to choose from that's .65 each after the first one. I like that the sauces are all packed in little sauce containers in the refrigerator. Saves time rather than trying to get it yourself or waiting for them to make it. I had to try their fry sauce cause it's supposed to be what Utah's known for. It's basically ketchup, mayo, and BBQ sauce. Interesting. I usually have ketchup and mayo or just mayo with my fries. The aioli was my favorite cause of the garlic flavor. The fries were delicious. My only concern was that some pieces were too short. I want the whole fry. Thanks. My friends who decided to get Thai food instead, which was next door, tried some of ours. They liked the waffle so much, they went back there for Sunday breakfast. Lol. Can't go wrong with waffles and fries!"}, {"review_id": "72g2CzksgnwCdJPCafD9vA", "user_id": "0dzu0o1MuETzECO0l03XLQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/22/2017", "text": "I've had Bruges plenty of times, and decided to grab some lunch from their food truck instead of their usual sit-down places.I had their Ricky Burger this time, looking for actual lunch instead of dessert. Not bad, but also not really worth the $10. I'm guessing the burger is steamed? Not sure. Also wasn't a fan of how much sauce was used. Combined with the fried onions and double-fried frites, the meal felt super heavy. Slight regret getting lunch. Make no mistake though - their waffles are incredible! Little bite-sized pieces of sugar in a more cake-like batter cooked perfectly separates their waffles from everyone else. For lunch, however, just know their burgers and dogs are heavy and come with lots of sauce.What To Get: their Sugarhouse Waffle is a perfect first-timer dessert with a mix of fruit and cream on top. For sauces with your fries, go for the Andalouse or Samurai"}, {"review_id": "z8rvR6sC5gtRfl-Jgna2mA", "user_id": "pd23UHHe0wHuG5B2xPyFwQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "I had the Machine Gun and S'mores dessert.

We literally just got to SLC a few hours ago and this was the first place we stopped at to eat. It was on my list of places to go and I was NOT disappointed in the least!!! Parking: 2 hour street parking nearby, easy to find on a Friday at 1pm.Location: Super easy to find, cute outdoor seating and they have a deck upstairs!Service: Excellent!!! The girl taking our order was super nice and I didn't feel rushed about hurrying up to order. One of the other guys there too was super helpful and offered some suggestions too. Love hearing recommendations from helpful and happy employees :):) Awesome customer service!Food: Welllllll, let's be honest, I really wanted to order everything they had but decided on the Ricky Burger, and two waffles - the Bruges Favorite and a special peaches-n-cream one they since it's peach season! The burger was awesome, cooked perfect and the sauce in there was amaaaazing. And the fried onions?!?!? Yes please!!!! Prob one of the best burgers I've ever had. Even the bun was delicious! Toasty on the outside but yet still soft and easy to bite into. Oh gosh I would love to have another one right now. The Bruges Favorite was a liege waffle with fresh strawberries and creme fraiche. My son ate pretty much the entire thing by himself so I guess you could say it was a big winner!!!Peaches-n-cream liege waffle was also of course, delicious! The peach was so fresh and sweet, i was so glad I ordered that special waffle!And the fries....yummmmm. PLUS you get to choose a dip to go with it! We upgraded the fries that came with the Ricky Burger to a size medium so we got 2 dips and chose the Greens and the Andalouse. Both were great because they were very different yet complimented each other so well! Very very happy with our late lunch here at Bruges, we def will need to stop by again before we leave!"}, {"review_id": "gZvbuJPB3Tu0PCFFovMR1w", "user_id": "8I76wqOAv_1zCVatUG_pBg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "The staff recommended I try the Flemish stew with frites.  Don't let the presentation throw you off.  It was a great.

The first time I went I got the chicken and waffles, which wasn't quite what I wanted. I was hoping for savory but didn't realize it came with creme fraiche, which made it sweet.

The waffle on its own is incredible, a little crunchy on the outside and soft and doughy on the inside. As much as I loved all of the toppings I chose, just a plain cinnamon waffle would've been perfect. Also, don't forget to get the fries, they're delicious!

They're pricey, but hey they're also tasty. The fries are perfectly crispy, not starchy, and just overall addictive. Bonus for the amazing selection of sauces to dip your fries in.

I'm not from the area so trying to find some good places to eat other than hotel breakfast was sort of the goal. Food: so they basically serve waffles and frites. I ordered the peach and cream waffle (fresh made cream and farmers market peaches) and my partner ordered the pig on the cloud. The waffle is not from batter but it was more like a dough form, and get this, they had bacon in the dough already. The cream wasn't too sweet but definitely rich. Loved every bite for sure. I also ordered some frites (yea I know it was breakfast but o was craving fries). It was probably some of the best fries I've ever had.. it was nicely seasoned and they had a ton of sauces to pick from! I unfortunately don't remember one of the two sauces, but it was very fresh. I also got the andoullie sauce which was flavorful with a kick.Service: Everyone was super friendly and jolly that morning. The owner was also present and gave some recommendations of what to order. I was the first customer of the day and they were definitely ready to serve, even though everything was still warming up.Venue: it's a little tight in the store itself.. wasn't super comfortable but it was kinda cozy. They also have an upstairs area.
