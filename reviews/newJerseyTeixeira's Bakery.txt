There are easily over 150 Portuguese and Brazilian cafes, restaurants, and shops in the Ironbound alone.Very likely the best and most popular Portuguese bakery in the Ironbound District would have to be Teixera's Bakery. They've been in business for decades and have had several articles written about them by NYTimes, Serious Eats, and more.The interior is typical of what you'd expect of a pasteleria in Portugal. They are best known for their pastel de nata and their wide selection of Portuguese breads. In addition, they have tortas, croissants, bolas de berlim, guardanapos, and much more.Some of my favorites:Pao de deus - coconut crust on brioche breadBola de berlim - berliner donut filled with ovos mole, an egg creamPastel de nata - famous egg and custard cupGuardanapo - (napkin dough filled with ovos mole).They have 3 locations, with their location on Ferry St. spot being the most popular."}, {"review_id": "7Xk---W8Dz-EPighe49EHA", "user_id": "03iExWTlpSsobI0OYPTkZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "The best pastel di nata in America - just like Portugal !

I remember stopping in for one of their signature buttered Portuguese rolls and a hot cup of coffee before a shopping trip down Ferry Street. Nothing in the world compares to their custard cups. Especially when they're fresh outta the oven. It's pretty much impossible to come here without snagging a box to go. Make sure to grab a few extra, they're a crowd pleaser."}, {"review_id": "7JGVgIs79om55RqeCTUESQ", "user_id": "ScD5Wixga1TQ7boVott8yQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Maybe it's because I'm so used to the Portuguese egg tarts from Xin Fa Bakery, but I just found Teixeira's sub par. Although the crust was nice and crispy, it was a tad salty which I didn't like (my friend did not taste the salt but I'm just super sensitive to it). The custard was ok. Once again not on par with what I'm used to. If you're a fan of Xin Fa and are used to their piping hot made to order Portuguese egg tarts you may not like this place.The egg tarts aren't what brought my rating down. Oh no! It was the extremely watered down iced coffee. It tasted more like coffee flavored water. The egg tarts themselves I would rate a 3 out of 5. Suffice it to say I probably won't be making another visit."}, {"review_id": "f1PHdqrgqmP3X0QEZeFnEg", "user_id": "jQhKg1ocjPEopbvfV3Bluw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "Suddenly one morning I woke up and started craving for Portuguese egg tart. Maybe I was watching too much food network. Anyway, I was doing some research on Yelp and found this place.It's bit far from my place but I figured it's worth the drive to get the best egg tart I can find around my area. It's located downtown Newark, parking would be a problem. I was able to find street parking after I drove around a little bit. Bakery has a modernized signs outside. Has tables inside for people who wanna enjoy coffee and baked goods. Display shelf were filled with yummy goods. They had short line to order, I had to get dozen of egg tarts and beef empanadas. They heated up my empanadas, I finished them before I left the bakery door. Egg tarts are so delicious as well as empanadas! My trip was so worth it indeed. I may go back again soon!"}, {"review_id": "8GgeatAjXh_0TStTJkJeOw", "user_id": "11QSiZ374VhKABHlj2cAhQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/14/2017", "text": "I used to come here a lot more often when I lived in the neighborhood because it was (is still) my favorite Portuguese bakery in the Ironbound. The staff is super duper friendly and their pastries are all yummy. I'm a fan of the chocolate croissant and coconut pastry, but the pasteis de nata (custard cups) are the clear winners here. I usually grab half a dozen of them anytime I'm nearby and if you come early enough, these things are so hot and so flaky and ugh I just love 'em so much.I miss the days when the custard cups were only $4ish for half a dozen, but I guess due to high demand they're now $7 for the same amount.

That's where Teixeira's  and Calandra's come into play.The only items I have eaten from this bakery are their pasteis de natas and Portuguese rolls (hands down best rolls around). Reviews are dead on about the sumptuous flaky egg custard cups! Come here for these alone! Best I have tried! They don't hold up well so best eaten fresh the same day. I seriously need to try all their other tempting goodness, but I get too excited ordering these and can't wait to just crack that box open and chow down! Definitely make a trip here if you can!

I am a big fan of baked goods and bake shops. In the New York area there are numerous excellent Italian and French bakeries. This is an excellent Portugese bakery. Not being tremendously familiar with Portugese baked goods, I expected a level of sweetness consistent with the aforementioned cuisines. I was pleasantly surprised by the more subtle sweetness in these baked goods. The doughs were light and airy, with the sweetness only being some of the pleasure, with the other characteristics of the baked goods holding court as well. However, do not go directly to the baked goods. First make a pit stop and chow down on a few empanadas. I had both the beef and chicken. These were the best empanadas I have ever eaten. The dough was once again a masterpiece, both airy and not over baked.  Expect a bit of a language barrier, as it is an authentic Portugese bakery. Also, expect genuine friendliness. There are no prices posted, but I thought the prices were definitely fair. The setting is nothing fancy, but we were here to enjoy the food and that the bakery delivered!"}, {"review_id": "XXPhuB8iGRlJvba1bRi1Rw", "user_id": "PiU-wz8weV1h5g8YmzBDpw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "Teixeira's has hands down, THE BEST portugese egg custard tarts in the area. They have the perfect crispy, crunchy, flaky crust filled with the creamiest egg custard filling. Melt in your mouth good when they're hot and fresh. As with anything made with a flaky dough, it is best eaten fresh (it will get soggy if you leave it out for hours). However, if you want to buy an extra few for the next day, they heat up just as well in the oven. The ladies working the counter are friendly and despite the language barrier, they communicate well.
