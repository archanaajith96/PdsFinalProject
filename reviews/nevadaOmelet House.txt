It was pretty busy with most tables full, and plenty of staff working the room. I ordered the chicken fried steak, served on a bed of thin sliced potatoes, two eggs, and toast. One of the better chicken fried steaks in town. Portion was good for me, maybe a touch small for people who love to load up. You guys can order the 6 egg omelet if you are that hungry!Overall, good food, decent prices, plenty of selection, and friendly staff makes this a place to visit again. Enjoy!"}, {"review_id": "KFY8hUpZ6ZfB-A0sMg8P_w", "user_id": "E1mcFIOK7k_G08cki2oBuw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Had to wait because we came on a Saturday morning, but all was good once we were seated. I didn't like sitting at the bar because the seats are a bit too close together, I even bumped elbows with the gentleman next to me a few times. The place is relatively small and difficult to feel comfortable in. The food was good, I got a Patti Page burger and boyfriend got an omelette. Both of us had to get go boxes. Everything was hot and fresh when we received it.The waitresses were very attentive and asked us how we were doing fairly often."}, {"review_id": "-3vDwL6inaOgvHJQugYsYQ", "user_id": "pOz8G2ezXNRx-yCyRi-0Dg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "Be forewarned that the portions at the Omelet House are huge!  I ordered the \"baby\" size Mile-High City omelet with banana bread and I still could barely finish it, as the baby size covered half of the plate!  I was not a fan of their potato chips that come with the omelet, but their warm banana was terrific.  The omelet was slightly overcooked and seemed dry, but you can't beat the price for the crazy amount of food you receive.  The service was outstanding, but trying to get a seat on the weekend took 30-45 minutes.  Overall great food and service!"}, {"review_id": "3YyeIUvllARxlZH6MLFR0A", "user_id": "6KJtzhkqIx8joNGlK9_6zA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Wow!

After reading a few of the reviews I decided to try it for myself. The place was packed, but we waited no more than 5-10 mins for a table. After we were sat the server quickly came around and grabbed our drink order. I decided on the Toadstool (mushroom) omelet. I decided to try the pumpkin nut bread. The portions were huge! The food was amazing. I loved the flavorful pumpkin nut bread which was served warm with butter. The breakfast spuds, thicker slices of potatoes which were fried.... AMAZING. Service was superb. We were checked in on frequently and offered refills of coffee and water, never running low. I definitely recommend trying this place out."}, {"review_id": "e7BKZ1bp1hrV3ecPMQRe4Q", "user_id": "5usIYRSi2CDxeDlz5gOdMw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "It's a really good place for families.

Eggs benny are a fried egg version of the traditional recipe and the reason they gave me for not making it as it should be is because the are a fast food restaurant and they don't have time to poach eggs, which to me is unnaceptable if you offer eggs benny, better call it eggs benny style.Anyways as I said tasty food, super service and good ambiance"}, {"review_id": "ufcRElGwF20IFase_uRKFg", "user_id": "gFDMmcyg-CIGRG5bhCfL_Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Warning all breakfasts come with toast, bread, or English muffin on the side accept egg's Benedict because I guess egg's Benedict doesn't count as breakfast... However the menu has it listed under: \"Each Breakfast is prepared with only Farm-Fresh Eggs, Spuds, and your choice of Toast, English Muffin, Homemade Pumpkin Nut Bread, Banana Nut Bread, or Tortillas.\" After pointing that out I was told by one person it already came with English muffins (which made no sense as English muffin is part of the eggs Benedict not as a side). Another one said that it's not part of the deal because it's something separate(I guess it's not considered breakfast? And another agreed with me, but no bread anyways.I tried to make a comparison saying \"It would be like getting an omelette with bacon in it an because the omelette has bacon in it you don't get it on the side.\" To which the lady said \"We don't have omelettes with bacon\"...I used to love this place an highly recommended it an would take visitors to it and recommend it to passengers(I'm a Uber/Lyft driver) when asked about a good locals place to eat, but after this experience I don't foresee that happening."}, {"review_id": "DtrefUZYl4AYnEGaLbkvUQ", "user_id": "4tFTRL55FHhgisLPFleKgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I love the food and the service...

The eggs are fluffy perfection and the tangy ranchero sauce is it's crowning glory.  Btw, this order in my photo is the 'baby size '... I'll be boxing it up.  Lol!

The eggs were blah, but the bacon was good. 2 friends had Omlettes and they didn't like them. 2 other friends had the french toast breakfast and it was pretty much like the waffle breakfast, they had better. Also they do not have turkey bacon, just an FYI. There was also flies in the restraunt and the booths could use some dusting and cleaning.
