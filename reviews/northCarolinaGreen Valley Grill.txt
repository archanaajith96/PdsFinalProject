Starting with the Sicilian Meatballs --- Giacomo's sausage, ground beef, pine nuts, raisins, tomato-chili compote, crispy Burrata, shaved pecorino and grilled crostini and the Mediterranean Street Fries --- hand-cut fries with preserved lemon-charmoula chicken, cilantro, feta and chili-lime aïoli. The meatballs were great but who has ever heard of the Mediterranean Street Fries before? Well, not me anyway... They were like nachos set to awesome (without fries instead of chips).I was very happy with the Wood-Fired Charmoula Rotisserie Chicken --- Persian love rice, roasted red pepper hummus and wilted greens as a main course. No room to even look at the dessert menu after all of this and a couple of crafts brews."}, {"review_id": "6h58TX5mWU90dCnvAhyReg", "user_id": "eitWzXuvtzOhDfa_UXEYYg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "This place was delicious. It is super fancy and pricey but it was great quality food, great service and a great atmosphere.Food: I got the hummus dip to start which was delicious. Then I got the veggie cigars for a meal. I was expecting more of a kabob than an egg roll but it was still delicious. There wasn't enough spinach but they happily gave me more on the side. The only weird thing was he side salad which was very blahService: the service was attentive and very helpful.Price: this place is pricey due to the ambiance. The food was good quality but you're paying for the upscaliness of the place and presentation more than portion."}, {"review_id": "SGUcjGm0_bDxNgbRy15QSg", "user_id": "9qTmQeOKZMppgnySdHA-QA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "When I say I LOVE GVG it's an understatement. The staff is well trained, the restaurant is clean and the food is to die for. If you're looking for brunch try the avocado toast , and Bloody Mary. Lunch the salmon salad or summer salad is amazing, all flatbreads are tasty. If you're going for dinner the almond crusted chicken is AMAZING!!! This place is a gem.

Green Valley Grill is a beautiful restaurant that makes you want to sit and stay awhile, and the service is impeccable. The soup of the day, a sweet potato, kale and chickpea bisque was light yet flavorful, and each ingredient was cooked perfectly. For my main, I ordered the catch of the day, a green pesto covered barramundi fish with butter beans that looked fantastic and tasted even better. Everyone at my table was jealous of my pic. Every lunch or dinner I've had at a Quaintance-Weaver restaurants has always left me impressive and wanting to come back ASAP.  I would recommend to always order off of the seasonal specials, or chef's choice of the day. You won't be disappointed!"}, {"review_id": "ohgAWFJpZaNwHx_Er3dZ4g", "user_id": "rmZ9gUyoGHYSsGkg5mzZHw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/13/2017", "text": "Green Valley Grill never disappoints. My family loves coming here for appetizers and cocktails. We always try to grab a booth at the bar, which is very elegant. I ordered a moscow mule and added muddled mint... it was so good! We ordered the meatballs, tuna, and vegetable flatbread. All three had so much flavor and were clearly very fresh. The flatbread had huge slices of vegetables - zucchini, eggplant, onions. GVG has great parking. We consistently have excellent service.

It is somewhat of a tradition for them to go when she is in town, but it was my first - of many - visits. We started with cocktails and I had the New Fashioned. I guess a more updated version of the Old Fashioned. Very strong, but not overpowering. I good spin on the old classic.We followed up with some small plates. The Garlic Crusted Ahi Tuna was to die for. A thick slice cooked to perfection. Just enough garlic to give a great flavor, but not to kill any vampires. The Dip Duo was also great with two kinds of hummus. I was definitely partial to the red pepper. Enough kick to make you know it's there, but weren't quite sweating. Lastly, we had a meatball dish, that was delicious as well. I don't remember the specifics of it and can't find it on the current online menu, but would highly recommend it. Glad to be a part of this family tradition that introduced me to the GVG!"}, {"review_id": "ouPX10WTBNcobhXU4jyq2Q", "user_id": "taRflwNw7jLOMf_kbEHNSg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "The atmosphere, food, and service were excellent.

We were seated in the low-lit back dining room, which was decorated with beautiful dangling lights. The staff was very friendly and brought out warm bread quickly. We ordered the Mediterranean Tapas appetizer. The appetizer, unfortunately, was never brought out to us. Our waitress was very apologetic and gave us two complimentary, large pieces of delicious chocolate cake. My mom and I both got the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with herbed goat cheese, served with fried capers, lemon garlic sauce, mashed potatoes and green beans. It was delicious and came out quickly. My grandma got the Wood-Fire Grilled Salmon with sherry-honey glaze and garlic-thyme butter, polenta and green beans.

They rotate items on the menu fairly regularly, adding some new items, while generally keeping the favorites like Darn Good Burger (and it is), Sicilian Meatballs, the GVG Reuben, and the Mediterranean Tapas.We popped in yesterday, and headed for the bar as usual, and this was a good thing since the Red Hat Ladies were gathering in the main dining area - they can get a bit rowdy after a Sherry or two!  The bar area was calm and peaceful, in fact we had the place to ourselves for the entire meal, with excellent service.Alice chose a favorite, the Mediterranean Tapas (Hummus, Sicilian Meatballs, Moroccan Spiced Vegetable Samosa, Ham Croquette, Charmoula Chicken Skewer, Marinated Feta and grilled pita) at $16.95. After much internal debate, I went with the GVG Reuben - featuring Giacomo's corned beef and pastrami layered with sauerkraut, Gruyère, and zesty Russian dressing on rustic pumpernickel, served with hand-cut fries, ringing the bell at  $13.95.The food was out in good order, intact and beautifully plated! Either one of these meals could be shared with plenty for all but the most aggressive diner. The Reuben is served on a very dark, very flavorful pumpernickel, with a nice assortment of textures and flavors, needing only a doubling of the dressing to make this a complete winner. The FFs here are sinful, real potato with a great outside crunch - and you gets this really cool little container of ketchup.The Mediterranean Tapas gets rearranged periodically, but it would be most difficult to beat this array. The Vegetable Samosa is a bit unusual, but very flavorful, and packs some nice heat from the cilantro pesto yogurt and harissa sauce. The Ham Croquette is very nicely done, lots of taste & not at all gummy in texture. The Moroccan Spiced Meatballs have been on the menu for a long time, and never disappoint, and the Hummus is solid, with out a garlic overkill! The Chicken Skewer is very tender, nicely grilled, and the marinated laced taste is excellent. This plate would easily serve 3 as an appetizer.An excellent lunch in a most relaxing environment - it doesn't get much better in Gboro."}, {"review_id": "7oTc0drntEXVUaGx56VIgA", "user_id": "9vRqTspIAQGCkRBvMR9wXA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2017", "text": "Green Valley Grill (GVG) is probably my favorite restaurant in Greensboro! So much so that I've never written a review for it because I just don't know that I could do it justice. If you are looking for fine dining in Greensboro this is the best spot. It is on Green Valley Rd. right beside the O'Henry Hotel and just minutes away from Friendly Shopping Center. The food at GVG is incredible, but what truly makes it a place that I continue coming back to is the service and the ambience. GVG has extremely high ceilings, big booths, low lighting, and murals on the wall. The kind of place that you would take a date to try and impress them (and succeed). The service here is always excellent and they will really go out of their way to ensure that you have an enjoyable experience. There is also a patio area that is perfect for having a cocktail on a warmer night. I have ordered a number of items throughout the years off of the menu. They do steaks very well, but I honestly think that I prefer their fish selections. You really can't go wrong here. I've never heard anyone complain about their food. As far as appetizers go, the Mediterranean Tapas are a crowd pleaser. It is great if you have a large party and want to sample a number of things. It comes with Hummus, Sicilian meatballs, Moroccan spiced vegetable samosa, ham croquette, charmoula chicken skewer, marinated feta and grilled pita. Also a good option if you want to split something over drinks with friends. GVG has a special place in my heart. I have celebrated birthdays here, gone with groups before prom, and I even had my first (legal) drink here (a Red Oak of course). I may be a little biased but I think Green Valley Grill is an excellent fine dining option in Greensboro, and I would encourage everyone to try it out for their next special occasion."}, {"review_id": "jgeyhFKbfGkcZ9sBVrHY5A", "user_id": "kjaUSiRWhR9bF9KxOMbVvg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2017", "text": "Green Valley Grill, a great place for a upscale experience without paying upscale prices!  Located adjacent to The O'Henry Hotel, Green Valley Grill is a beautifully appointed restaurant with a variety of options done with desire to be attentive to detail!Tonight we started with the Crab & Spinach Dip which is served with chips that seem to me to be like a rice chip.  Either way, it's a special app as the crab is apparent and the bold flavors are superb!Our House and Caesar salads respectively were good, but my Caesar I'd like to see them go the extra mile and add the anchovies for the complete experience.Entrees, while not a ton to choose from, is nonetheless a tough decision.  The Filet with a mushroom cream sauce over it was one selection.  The Filet was perfectly cooked to medium rare and seemingly melted in your mouth!  The rich Mushroom Cream sauce was a excellent compliment to this extraordinary piece of meat!The Pecan Crusted Trout with polenta was the other selection and it didn't disappoint!  A nice sized portion of trout was flakey and nicely done.  The polenta, a first for me, was like a combination of grits and mashed potatoes but a bit thicker consistency.We finished the evening off with the dessert sampler, which I can attest is the way to go to see just how good all of their desserts really are here!After a evening of live jazz in the O'Henry, a meal from Green Valley will cap your night off perfectly!"}, {"review_id": "Vi7ROwEgRTnzfAsQda5e4g", "user_id": "fKlI3iUSBSTmv7i3Aaz56w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/19/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This place is one of the best in town.
