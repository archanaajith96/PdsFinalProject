We did a sampler flight and although I can't recall everything we tried, 2 beers really stood out. Space Skull Ascendant, BA Dry-Hopped Sour and Love Shadow, BBA Imperial Stout. Stouts are usually not my first choice and I really haven't liked any of the bourbon barrel aged beers as they usually taste like someone poured a shot of whiskey into my beer, but OMG!!! The Love Shadow was one of the most flavorful and interesting beers I've every had. So good that I had 2 of them and was amazed by every sip."}, {"review_id": "zvE8s7_1HFVuXd6qb2XKWA", "user_id": "SkcKsBHLmzFMuARhgt37Vg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Gluten free friends, if you have the choice of venue I don't recommend Brewery Vivant. It's all in the name. But if you do dine here they have gluten free fries and pickled vegetables that are both delicious. The overall environment is wonderful. The inside of the 'church' is beautiful, dim-lit and cozy. They have a superb porch area for warmer days. Bathrooms are clean. Service is wonderful. Our server was knowledgable about gluten free and helped significantly."}, {"review_id": "Z2wFGK-5JvGj0ZdqmY1M2w", "user_id": "QMv3G0xwD4u4me0_nWXTng", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "This brewery is seriously cool. The architecture and decor gives it a cool feel, different from others breweries in the area. I stopped out here after work one day for a drink and an appetizer.  They have great sour beers if you like those! I was less than impressed with the pretzel and beer cheese so next time I will have to try something different. Overall great experience and I'll definitely go back!"}, {"review_id": "KsP4eK2K-l7AUlBzBGxLrQ", "user_id": "VIK-jy0F-01AYbuaUS3Ouw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I don't give 5 stars on a whim, though if you look at my reviews, it may seem so... I'd give Brewery Vivant 11 stars if I could!!! From the amazing staff, cleanliness of the restaurant & bathrooms, and exciting menu, it's readily apparent that BV stands apart. I love that they are a environmentally minded business- they use recycled water in the bathrooms and sustainable farmed foods... But OH. the \"pretzels\" ((try warm, crispy and buttery on the outside with glorious amounts of pretzel salt, while the soft and fluffy bread inside gives the cheese dip an avenue into my belly)) and beer cheese!!! And that tropical saison!!! *Dies a very happy woman*"}, {"review_id": "DJ4aGTDx2MmWTy2havQ7JQ", "user_id": "NSTez4r3u4JsuyW_HhR16Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Love vivant.

The building is an old mortuary that looks and feels like an old church. It's in a really cool neighborhood too. I love their sour beers...actually every beer I've had has been great.

Beer could have been better...My husband is a huge fan of their belgian red, and I love belgian beers, saisons, and sours, so we definitely had high expectations going into this. All four in our party got flights with a variety of beers, and we found that the beers all tasted fairly similar. They probably would have been great if enjoyed as a pint, but you expect more variety with a flight.But the food was honestly amazing! We shared the duck confit nachos that were served with a delicious brie cream, and we all agreed that the beer cheese was probably the best we tasted!"}, {"review_id": "QxdjutO9nLfAXCfrfauj0w", "user_id": "lw4m0iCi98nVsB0_vJD94A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "You like sour beers, this is the place to be!!

Hubby and I split the Hungarian Smoked Sausage.  Who knew broccoli greens and kale roasted in garlic would lead to a fork death match?  I got the last bite, worth the battle.  It's a seasonal dish set to be released soon.  Service was great.  Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and beers, which is always a plus."}, {"review_id": "ooMxuEk14VyN2S9h-mzuVQ", "user_id": "Wq4lCb5EWcUwhT4mRp3otA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "One of our stops while visiting GR. I enjoyed the decor of this place since it is refurbished funeral chapel. All of the staff was super friendly and helpful. The beers that stood out the most were the Milk and Honey Stout and the Nectar of the Necromancer. We tried the pretzels and beer cheese dip. Pretzels were oven baked and delish. The dip was more a whipped dip than a hot dip, it wasn't bad but not what we expected. I would definitely like to come back here again and explore more of the menu"}, {"review_id": "Oa1UIiwFItTMxPE3nhCDqw", "user_id": "BwKGM82ECyrL21SomlLQtw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/27/2017", "text": "Belgian beers in an old funeral home.

Left both time feels full and a little buzzed haha.Theres a wide variety of beers they brew themselves, from Ales, IPA, and Stouts. You can't come here and not try an assortment of different beers. Best way to do that is the flight. It's a great option to figuring out what you want and different exposure to different beers they brew.The food is also fabulous as well. The escargot for appetizers were delicious. The butter and parmesan was an amazing compliment to the escargot. Also the poutine is a great share between friends because it's a decent size plate.This place is great for a friends outing and the service provided was friendly. The inside is a little dim at night but during the day it's stunning."}, {"review_id": "9g-jmZD-qqgyXB8kM4uW9w", "user_id": "Iw5O8qETvc-cv1pDpCMLAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/13/2017", "text": "If you're looking for great service, great beer with a detailed explanation of what you're drinking as well as bar food that is far from typical this is the place. I can't stop thinking about how much of a wow experience this was. It was my first visit here and made sure I let my server know this. He was phenomenal in explaining every single detail about the establishment, the history, the brewing process and the way the food was prepared. I ordered \"The Burger\" a half pound of beef/bacon made to perfection. I asked for medium and he recommended getting it medium-well because they prepare their burgers a step different. I was apprehensive in doing so but after the first bite he was 200% accurate. It was a perfect medium and the juices rained all over me. I enjoyed the home cut frites (fries) also perfect! They were so good I started eating my son's fries off of his plate. I ordered a flight and had him choose for me. Again another job well done. I typically don't enjoy fruity beers, however, they really understand how to infuse beers with fruit without overwhelming the beer into what I compare it to being a wine cooler. Who would have thought mango and pineapple in a beer would be so good. You have to try the tropical sun. Lastly on your way out stop in the store and pick you up some treats to enjoy at home. I can't wait to return here. It was worth the 3 hour drive."}, {"review_id": "2bihxnX8ZNzQBb1tqanAZg", "user_id": "FDF7Hg3bvT4yH4wJSw0S6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Wow!
