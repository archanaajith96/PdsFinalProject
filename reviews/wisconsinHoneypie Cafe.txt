We went on a Monday during lunchtime, so there was absolutely no wait, but still a decent crowd. My friend and I sat at the bar and our bartender was super friendly and so attentive. I love how sparse, yet inviting, the decor is. Lots of pretty light colored wood everywhere. B and I split an order of biscuits...and while I was hesitant to pay $4 for 2 biscuits, the peach/balsamic jam that comes with them I worth triple that. The biscuit alone is also so delicious. I ordered a breakfast burrito (she got eggs and toast) and it was all delicious. I wish the burrito didn't have the sauce on it though, because you have to eat it with a fork and knife, but the taste made up for the inconvenience.Then comes the best part...dessert! I HAD to try the \"Salted Honey Pie\" because those three words deserve to go together, and as the namesake of the restaurant, it was bound to be good, right? Wrong. It was AMAZING. I only ate half of my piece because it was so delicious and I didn't want it to end. $6 is a bit much for me to spend on a piece of pie, so it will definitely be a treat every once in a while, but there are no regrets.I will definitely be eating there again, and will most definitely take my dad (the world's most pie obsessed person) for the treat of a lifetime."}, {"review_id": "BdW7wnc6R6T1e7XMEsUG-Q", "user_id": "7F7W-p8KT4skU0Hxtr4Abw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/8/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Ugh. The wait! It's awful and there's literally no where for people to go. I've been here quite a few times since my first time/review and I'm am just not impressed in the least. A week ago I got a slice of the banana cream pie from there; Not good. Soooo much whipped cream that was just way too oily; it just coats your mouth. And the price is a no thank you. So we just came for brunch. The wait was 45 minutes, which isn't surprising given it was a Sunday and the place is so tiny. The Bloody Mary was a no thank you. It tasted like cocktail sauce, why?! Our server, although friendly, seemed frazzled and kept walking by our table for a while without checking in. We finally got his attention and he took the bloody Mary's. He also didn't charge ya for them, so that was nice. The mimosas were good. So my wife and our friend liked their dish. I did not care for mine. I got the bbq pork fries because I am pretty sure I ordered it before and liked it. This was just lacking flavor, despite all that was thrown together. Or else I just did not like the combo of the flavors anymore. Anyway, I couldn't finish it. The whole experience for me was mediocre at best and I highly doubt I'll be back anytime soon. Although my wife and her friend will probably be. They liked their food and said that they'll just order mimosas from now on. I doubt we'll waste the money to try a pie again though."}, {"review_id": "7nVycg5uMjxKYHEP8DcY2A", "user_id": "ns7EylSo9HgtDY66RNLdTA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "I'm an off-again/on-again Honeypie customer. My wife and I will seemingly go nowhere else for a time, then \"forget\" about them for a few months. Very recently, we went for Sunday Brunch that was pretty spectacular. We sat at the bar due to their limited seating, and were taken care of promptly. Special mention: The wonderful woman behind the bar refused to let my coffee mug go empty! The food here is always great. Most everything is locally sourced. The portions are generous, this is not a tapas experience. This is home cooking with a touch of class. Also worth special mention are their baked goods. Their pies are terrific, and their cupcakes are something else. Both highly recommended."}, {"review_id": "ZOp_J_dVNd3eOqyHPJIc8g", "user_id": "oh3AdcMscJL6nECXNJqhug", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "This is a really tough review to write. I want to LOVE this place. The food was amazing (or supposed to be, but I'll get back to that). Like, seriously. This place does not fuck around!! I got a big ol bowl of pulled pork and potatoes and jalapeños and omg. M'lady had the breakfast casserole, and both were basically fine.Here's where the problem is. It wasn't a weekend (when they're SICK PACKED weekly), so the crowd wasn't an issue. Yet, we saw our food sit it the HEATED service window for at least 10 minutes while we watched our server (the bartender) do everything and anything besides grabbing it for us, including nothing. When our meals arrived the eggs atop were destroyed, and everything else had dripped and drooped and dropped. Lame. It would've been awesome, I'm positive. The corn muffin we started with was amazeballs and served promptly. The desserts we took home were silly good, as well.Someday, I'll be back, and maybe I'll rectify this review."}, {"review_id": "JSNMKfufbbai88FPABbm7w", "user_id": "9brb3jp3oZVIlL5jt4ilCA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Stopping through Milwaukee to catch up with some longtime friends I haven't seen a while on my way to Chicago. Decided to meet here for brunch based on the reviews, but to be frank, I did not enjoy my meal. Maybe it was because I didn't order the pie, but I was disappointed in the entrees so was not feeling it. The menu is limited and when we got there at 9:30AM, one dish was not available which we were going to order and another was altered which we were also going to order but then opted not to with the change. Pork Belly Bagel, Ham Biscuit, and Brisket Hash all essentially tasted the same. You could tell everything was cooked on the same pan. Each of our dishes had a sunny egg which all looked beautiful and looked like the yolk was going to be runny but it wasn't... sad. I know brunch places get busy, especially in Milwaukee, but I hate feeling like I'm getting passive aggressively pushed out every 15 minutes from the waitress and staff -- another dent in the experience here."}, {"review_id": "myudhONzaulA7x5H2uDqGg", "user_id": "GywE4SlLH1mc6Vl7rczJ3A", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Went in on Sunday afternoon for a drink and took 10 minutes to get served (bar almost empty) and a few minutes later they started vacuuming with people at tables eating I used to like this place but won't go back !"}, {"review_id": "zOE_bbmVzLcSsTRafXt-8Q", "user_id": "Pu83ugZm43jgRil0ivtbAw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Very great atmosphere.

They had a few, and I chose the Cookies & Cream pie.  Apparently you have to pay $5.00 extra because you are taking home one of their pie pans.  But you can come back and return it (too bad I won't be back for a while, so keepsies for me!).  The pie seemed to weigh 10 lbs!!  So, $32.00 for the pie, plus the $5 for the pan - that's a $37 dollar pie, ya'll.  I kept thinking, this thing BETTER be good...The pie sat in the trunk until that evening.  When I got home, my husband and I dug in.  We were pretty surprised to find that underneath the mound of whipped topping with crumbled chocolate sandwich cookies (not sure they were even Oreo brand), all that filled the pie was an extra thick layer of a vanilla custard or pudding.  Seriously??...$37 for Oreo-type crust, vanilla pudding and whipped cream?  I felt duped.  It tasty alright, but not quite sweet enough.  I was hoping for the sweet, cream-cheesy Oreo filling you get in a Baker's Square Oreo pie.  I should have gotten the Trick or Treat cheesecake - at least I knew what was inside.  I should've asked what was in it, but the title seemed self-explanatory.All in all, it was a good visit - I just don't think I'll be in Milwaukee any time soon to visit again.  When I do return, I will for sure come back for a phenomenal breakfast!"}, {"review_id": "maICBM1X3xV2pJyL6Z5u6w", "user_id": "8qAjJtvqGSrcl71LE19G8w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "If I could eat here every day I probably would.

The interior is kind of a mix between trendy house and old school diner, but it's low lighting and intimate seating at night makes it pretty romantic.  Whatever you do... save room for dessert because that is the main attraction here.  Their pies are fantastic and delicious... especially the bourbon fudge one! :) My favorite. Not only do they have their restaurant service, but they also provide pie delivery (which is amazing) and pie baking lessons!

We went to honeypie for the first time last night and I'm sad we didn't make the trip sooner. Our order consisted of the pork fries, acorn squash special and a last minute add on of the cornbread muffins.

We also snagged a slice of pie to go which was every bit as good as it had been hyped up to be.The only reason I can not bring myself to give them 5 stars is while service was friendly it was SLOW.

She is familiar with this place because it is not too far from her son's house. This place is a cute little bar/diner. It is a breakfast/lunch place with a full liquor bar! They use a lot of local ingredients and list them on the board, which is very cool to know. I asked our server what was better, the turkey sandwich or the duck confit sandwich. She said the duck. It was off the menu for a while and the staff was all excited to see it return. That was all I needed to know, especially because I can rarely pass up a duck dish.The duck confit sandwich comes with a slaw on top that isn't real mayo-y, red onion and is on a brioche bun. It comes with the best fries and is a deal at $11. I also had a Rishi blueberry roobios tea. Rishi is a local brand. Good tea.My aunt ordered the seasonal pasty with a green salad on the side. Pasties are popular throughout Michigan's Upper Peninsula, where I am from, so I know pasties. This one looked good. It is smaller than the ones you usually get up north but it looked good. The filling was chicken, cheese and something else. My aunt liked it.We did not have room for dessert but apparently, they are know for their pies.Our server was super friendly and attentive.

The menu is reasonably priced, they re-filled coffee throughout brunch, however it was $6 for a small (albeit, delicious) slice of pie. Luckily, my friend and I got a couple seats at the end of the bar where it wasn't as loud, but I would not be a happy camper at the bar seating/tables near the entrance. Honeypie needs to organize the swarm of hungry customers at the entrance (especially on colder days when everyone wants to wait inside) and streamline their system for securing a table -- they write down your name and tell you to return in X amount of minutes. For us it was a 25 min wait, we return back to the restaurant in ~20 min as to not lose our spot to someone else, and wait amongst an antsy crowd until our name is called."}, {"review_id": "iv8m_uVPbe5G2pfgr7H2fQ", "user_id": "PoQQEBnGaiFZ6TqOhLMTlg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/20/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I've been here a few times,  some items are excellent... some not so much.  There have WONDERFUL pies.  Pass on the cupcakes though,  they ALWAYS taste dry and stale to me.
