Getting a little expensive but worth it. At least you don't have to pay for parking like you must in the downtown areas and some of the other micro brewing companies. So that they were out of my usual IPA brew, they recommend a brooks and Dragonmead NE style ipa turns out that I might have a new favorite. I guess brewers from two companies joined forces and made it. Loved the citrus flavor and unfiltered beer."}, {"review_id": "nYvqye8TkKT7JwKoqyK_dQ", "user_id": "48DVJboDmac3PBDxGy6itA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/8/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Went in to try the February flight. It was fantastic. There were 5 different craft beers.Erik the red , strawberry rhubarb wheat, chocolate raspberry port, imperial stout,and juggernaut double red. All very good . The winner of all was the strawberry rhubarb wheat , it was not super fruity. Nice smooth beer and I was surprised how good chocolate raspberry port was , a nice smooth taste. I had a pulled pork sandwich off the limited menu. The sandwich had the pork, Mac and cheese melted cheese on a pretzel roll. The server was really friendly. The only thing I wish that the food menu was a little bigger."}, {"review_id": "cszdzmwVRvkd-WzWUse6lg", "user_id": "hRiCsHZUmMNQ4CRKR-TRwA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We can't think of a better way than to celebrate the Super Bowl than with our favorite beer!  #killerbee #sineater #crownjewel #redwingraspberry"}, {"review_id": "fxTyiacP8OMF96LnfJHppA", "user_id": "kubZC0Jf8JtDi3v1hoaDAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Always great service, excellent choices and terrific atmosphere.

Lots of seating and TVs. There are dart boards to play on. The beer list is vast and they make them in house. I tried the English Porter and the cider. The cider was excellent.  The English porter was good, but not very drinkable. We did order pretzel appetizer and the 3 dips were absolutely awful. The pretzel itself was delicious! But the sauces they provided with them were overly seasoned and no one in our group liked them. This place is pretty pricy as well, which was disappointing when you pay a lot and don't love what you get."}, {"review_id": "H7E0SgLK6l2GulT5V4Ry0w", "user_id": "Tn2l9b4W4Yb9eiS_kQRTdA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/7/2017", "text": "If you've been searching for a brewery were you can spend hours, days, or even weeks working you way through a beer menu, Dragonmead is your brewery. Their beer menu is deep with a beer for everyone. I found the beers to range from OK to slightly above average. We didn't find a beer that blew us away. However, the variety offered does provide novelty I haven't found elsewhere. They tap room is spacious and has a great stack of board games to enjoy over a brew. The middle-age and European decor creates a fun environment."}, {"review_id": "H6fjNVlsGLYQ-nIAiocmyA", "user_id": "CkNcwE5p25Ikbiyz4UDN5A", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Been here before several times.

The decor throughout is appropriate considering the name of this Watering hole, from the wooden tables, the knights armor, the chainmail headpiece, to the broadsword displayed on the wall. This bar also has a modern touch with two LCD TV's.I came here because I wanted to try their mead (aka honey wine). Dragonmead is a microbrewery and they brew a lot of what they serve on site. They also have your major domestic as well as popular imports selection (they're still a bar after all), but most people go for the home brew and are regulars.My experience began with the Belgian Cyser Mead. A delicate mead, light and sweet with flavors of apple and honey. I was a little disappointed in this mead, I was expecting much more intensity in flavor and robustness.My next drink was the Cherry Mead. Now this was what meads all about! The flavor was rich and the finish was smooth and lasting. But be careful, at 12% abv, this stuff can get you wasted fast!While no kitchen was evident, they seemed to have teamed up with LazyBones Smokehouse, which serves an assortment of meats superbly complementing the medieval theme. From Chicken & Ribs to Sausage & Brisket, all your major protein groups are covered. I forgone the sauces to get the true flavours of their work, and the brisket was absolutely amazing!With a weekly menu featuring new concoctions in small batches, one will never get bored of this place. You'll be coming back for your old favorites and finding new ones. If you find a small batch brew you like be sure to let the staff know, if there is enough demand for it, it may just become a permanent item on the menu! My first 5 star review. Congratulations Dragonmead!"}, {"review_id": "dwxcgMoPTanhnMwmAUVskA", "user_id": "mNM0R_ZAe66jToDrAll4og", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "Wonderful place; excellent beer and good service -- lowkey, friendly atmosphere.

I have not found anything I would order again.  And with regards to the service, it is always bad.  Either you are ignored by the wait staff and bartenders or they are rude to you.  They mostly only have tables of 4 and they have signs all over telling you not to move them that they will if you need additional seats.  However, when you ask them to move them for you, they act like it is a huge inconvenience.  If you are looking for a local brewery, I would much prefer Kuhnhenn's or Falling Down."}, {"review_id": "gpuphIA10h99vB5v-wQigg", "user_id": "2crd2f84f59fQcj6e60FLQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/23/2016", "text": "Great place and great beers.  Kind of a weird location off service drive.

Good idea since most beers are high alcohol.  Long story short, we love the place and come often. Most of the beers are excellent and award winning.

I will say that I am going to try and make it a point to return, though, because I think it's probably more deserving of a 4-star rating vs. 3 stars.I came here this past Monday as part of a board game Meetup - apparently they host a board game night every Monday, and it's quite popular, as many people attended. What's also pretty nice is that the winner of EACH game played gets a free drink token, with I think a 1-2 token limit per person per Monday.I walked in and started playing a game with a few new people. The waitress showed up quickly, to take my order, but when I told her I mostly like sweet drinks, and asked if she had any suggestions, she didn't seem super enthused ... she recommended 1 or 2 beers and that was it. I decided to order the cherry mead instead, as I've only tried mead a few times and it's usually pretty good. At first it kind of tasted a bit like cough syrup, but I enjoyed it more as I drank more of it. It was hard to flag down the waitress for my check when I decided to leave, but another of the board games people said I could actually pay at the bar, so I finally was able to grab the check from her there. I had heard a lot of good things about Dragonmead and I was kind of \"eh\" about this initial experience. The food menu did look fantastic, so I'd like to come back here and order some food and maybe another drink or two. But for now, this venue gets 3 stars from me."}, {"review_id": "QVNnPb892kkWJ52U32ppMg", "user_id": "bRSvrG1pYJX12LwIM4lGIQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/4/2017", "text": "There are two things that set this brewery apart: first off is the selection.  They had about thirty choices, whereas many places only have 6 to 10 to pick from.  And second is the quality.  Every beer we sampled was great.  Standouts were the grand cru, the Belgian tripel, the scotch ale, and the red.  Even difficult recipes like the rauchbier were good.The also had a kitchen but we did not try the food.  They had bottles to go of some beers, as well as growler filling.The place was big but not overly large.  The staff was friendly, and service was great.Highly recommended!"}, {"review_id": "JbKdSILuCvS1Nk46T8LduQ", "user_id": "EB0mvW1e-6TZbnK5cbCvMQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/24/2017", "text": "First time here and stopped due to the name.
