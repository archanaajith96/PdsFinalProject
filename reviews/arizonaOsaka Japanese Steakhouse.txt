The service was outstanding and so was the food.  But there are some small issues the owners should address in the future.The first is outrageously hot sliced jalapeno peppers.  They are so hot as to be inedible.  More important, jalapenos do not go on sushi.  They are Mexican, and belong on many Mexican dishes, but never on Japanese.  The owners are probably doing what many sushi restaurants do, and that is concoct made-up dishes they think Americans will like.  After all, the fortune cookie was invented in northern California and the California Roll sushi is not from Japan. Another issue is the way their sushi is served.  There's really only two ways to eat sushi - either with chop sticks (if you're able) or as a finger food.  In no instance is sushi ever served soaked in heavy syrup poured over the top.  The final issue regards the truly wonderful dish we had made up of tiny strips of steak, sauce and fried rice.  When it arrived, it looked like oatmeal molded in the shape of the bowl had been turned out upside-down on a large plate, like a pile of gruel.  It looked deathly unappetizing, but turned out to be so absolutely delicious, I could have eaten six more.  And at $4.95, that wouldn't have been hard to do!As Japanese restaurants go, Osaka was recommended as the 2nd highest rated Japanese in the city of Mesa, and it is indeed superior to others we've been to. Bottom line, coming from California where most Asian restaurants focus on authenticity, it's something of a culture shock to find in Arizona, authenticity isn't the goal, so much as just trying to be different."}, {"review_id": "rDryTslVNi2pT5QcaxmeEg", "user_id": "GlE1lWuyNz-bE2N9B_M23w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "The wait time usually isn't too bad, about 15 minutes.

The hibachi grill has to be my favorite. All the chefs here are hilarious and throw in a few jokes to go along with their performance of intense knife flipping. How they manage to do that w/o losing an eye or finger is beyond me! The food is always delicious--I suggest the chicken or shrimp with rice on the hibachi grill. I've tried beef too but the chicken/veg rice combo is my fave! I've also tried a lunch special here which was delicious but I think the food made with performance is the best!"}, {"review_id": "PZoaQ9sVYP6adyccthgbGA", "user_id": "ATzhj6cbaGZnNV5E4OAZCQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Tried this restaurant for the first time last month. We had a party of six and we all had the Teppanyaki. Between all the members of our party we tried the chicken, filet mignon, the regular steak, shrimp and scallops. The presentation and food was good. They brought out complimentary desert and had my daughter wear a Japanese mask while they sang.I made a reservation the day before for 8pm on a Sat. It was my daughter's birthday so it was a special night for us. When we arrived they told us they didn't have our table ready, we ended up not getting seated until 8:40pm. I made the reservation online, so that was a little frustrating. We will give them another try in the future when it's not so busy. (We went last time on a Sat night and there was about a one hour wait!). ** There are multiple restaurants and hotels in this little stretch and parking is very limited on a Sat night."}, {"review_id": "Opo7GaNtBEpqt0NDZHYYwQ", "user_id": "ynNGoqaOpMrbKLjauA1cEA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I can't say that I have done their tempanayaki before so I cannot rate them on that. I usually order my rolls to go and I have always been very satisfied. The service is fast and my rolls are always fresh and tasty. I ordered the Fatboy roll today and it was delicious ! I have never been disappointed.  I only wish they would have more specials or something because 15 dollars for 1 roll is expensive. I would come here more often if the price was a little less, but the quality is great."}, {"review_id": "2twbHBC4BwiaQVE8bfmI3A", "user_id": "BcJTMU2UrdtPiLreF0oV0g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "Do you have a bday or a group of friends to dine with? This place is so good!The atmosphere is really loud around the grills so its a little hard for everyone in the group to visit but the food is worth it!We ordered the dinner for 2 with Shrimp, Filet, Calamari, and sword fish. The rice is the best I've had at a place like this! The shrimp have a nice taste, the filet was cooked perfectly every time we've been, and the calamari has a nice tasty sauce on top. The sword fish wasn't my favorite this time. We tried the chicken a different time and it was so juicy and tasty!The grill chefs are entertaining and the staff polite."}, {"review_id": "END2R9O1hV-Bgf8kawAlcg", "user_id": "XQPDz1VSojZZ9p5k8uGJ_Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "This review is solely on their service.I made reservations for a party of 12 on a Wednesday night at 7pm. Two of us arrived about 5 minutes before 7pm and checked in at the front. The hostess said to let her know once the rest of our party has arrived. We checked in with her again at 7:00 because more than half of our party was there already. She said she couldn't seat us until everyone was there.Fine. So we continued to wait. By 7:05pm, everyone had arrived and we alerted the hostess. Apparently they gave away our table to another big party because their entire party was there before ours.We had to wait another 30minutes before we were seated. Mind you this was a weekday night that wasn't even busy! We were the only party waiting. What is the point of making a reservation if it isn't honored? This establishment needs to learn what it means to take reservations or don't accept them all together.By the time we were seated, everyone was irritated and hungry which set the mood for the rest of the night."}, {"review_id": "C6G8mL2jr10WU450kkLykg", "user_id": "jhBnXm2YS8PcNrJ6mGsVJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This is my families favorite Japanese restaurant.  The staff is always warm and friendly.  The food is fresh and delicious.  They have a great dessert menu.   Don't miss an opportunity to stop and enjoy."}, {"review_id": "aEluhwdUhQA7nFb_HWMKkg", "user_id": "ub65k-g20x1rmK3S1EHX3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Amazing experience I really like the atmosphere!

We were able to order multiple appetizers aswell as order four specialty rolls and drinks and our tab was around $50 for a party of five. Highly recommend the crab jalapeño poppers as they are huge and the Godzilla roll is amazing! We also ordered the Mesa roll, fried shumai and calamari, all of which were good. Service was a little slow but I think it has to do with heavier crowds than normal due to the holidays. The place was clean and okay for kids.

You can get a bento box for $8-$12 depending on what you order. I chose the Salmon Teriyaki, and this bento box was 4 stars. The salmon was not dry and cooked perfectly with a light drizzle of teriyaki. My favorite part was the fried rice, which $1 extra but worth the add on charge. It came with the usual additions like miso soup, salad with a creamy carrot ginger dressing, and gyoza. I'm not a big California Roll fan so it's the one thing I didn't finish since I was full from the rest of the food. I wanted to end on a sweet note, and I shared the Tempura Green Tea Ice Cream (3.5 stars). It's not the best version, but I loved the green tea ice cream. Service (4 stars) was good. Our server immediately asked if the five of us wanted separate checks. The hostesses were also very nice. They also have a Teppanyaki section if you want that type of experience."}, {"review_id": "autQYJ6j8ikTlq64aQjU_w", "user_id": "ug4FcklV8cHphoZ-Oh5Yog", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Excellent!

We had a party of 11 so we were lucky to have him all to ourself.It was my hubby's birthday so they do shoot saki into everyone's mouths and give a little extra to the bday boy! Tom gave us an amazing show and had us laughing the whole time. He was great at multi tasking while he was cooking, because our food still came out amazing! The fried rice was my favorite of the night. The white sauce they use was great with the rice. Drinks are really good here too.

The host and chef were both very personable. The chef had great showman skills, but it felt like he didn't spend too much time playing around with us. He tossed vegetables up in the air for those who wanted to catch them with their mouth, and of course, did the sake squirt bottle. If you do not wish to drink sake, they also have a lemonade bottle. Other than the traditional onion choo-choo and the cool egg breaking/dicing part, that was pretty much the extent of the \"show.\"If you have a birthday they will give you a crazy mask to wear, bang a drum and sing loudly. As other reviews mention, this will happen throughout your visit at most of the other tables too. Osaka will also give the birthday person a complimentary dessert, which is nice of them, but not the tastiest thing you'll ever eat. The food: our group had steak and chicken. Both were cooked to order. I liked the steak, but the chicken was bland. They give you sauce to dip it in, but it didn't quite erase the blandness. The fried rice they made at the table was very good though.The cup of soup they bring out was fine, but the salad was not good. (A lot of unattractive iceberg lettuce- tons of white and brown parts - with a few extra veggies thrown in.) All in all, it has a festive vibe going on. It might be fun if your group fills a table, and if you have some boisterous people in your group. It's super loud in there, so you won't really be conversing with your table mates much. The food is serviceable. Lastly, the staff that helped us all seemed to be nice and do a good job."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/osaka-japanese-steakhouse-mesa?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
