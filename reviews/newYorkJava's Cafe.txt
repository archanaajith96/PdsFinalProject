There is a lot of space to spread out and get some serious work done or just hangout. The drinks and food are amazing! There are also some seriously dope billiards tables in the basement. The only downside is that I can never find a power outlet and that seriously cuts down on the time I can spend here. Definitely recommend you check this place out! It's a Rochester classic!"}, {"review_id": "9oajwucXRmcT90G96cx0aQ", "user_id": "Tz3Z-lAXtALS9LOblTlOJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "The best cafe in Rochester, problems?

There's interesting art everywhere and all of the coffees that I have tried were delicious...I'd recommend the terrapin, it's sweet and beautifully decorated. The parking is difficult, but if you're going on a weekend street parking is free so you can usually find a spot nearby without having to pay. If not, there's a huge parking lot at the end of the street and it's only a couple dollars to park there for 3 hours.If you're going to work on a computer at a coffee shop, Javas is the place to go. Good wifi is hard to come by and theirs is super fast. That's a selling point for me a lot of the time. And there's no password, so if you forget to ask as you're buying your coffee you don't have to stupidly go back up and ask (a regular issue for me)."}, {"review_id": "EGzwy_liq-Pskaz90fgorQ", "user_id": "y-9F3NYbakql9ei2SrZxOw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "What a great place.

I know that it's early and I might be jinxing myself somehow, but this was basically the highlight of my day.  I only wish I'd gotten his name!"}, {"review_id": "A0I73Eu9qOkQwJ_cykWAKA", "user_id": "uN_ZJsRn80Zu-uyl5ZI2yg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/14/2016", "text": "Java's is an old favorite. I used to go there ALL THE TIME in college, but haven't been as much in my postgrad days just because I've discovered other favorite coffee shops that are a bit easier to get to or have better stuff. Still, that Java's hot chocolate can't be beat. SO GOOD. Perfect for a chilly winter day. Java's is always a great spot to sit and kill a few hours. Warm drink and pleasant ambiance always make for a pleasant evening. They have many tasty desserts that are worth trying if you're in the mood to indulge!"}, {"review_id": "F4cnQo0oU3frjJ9mbJFtxg", "user_id": "ep6oaY9s0vVRijQlrAytqw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/14/2015", "text": "This is one of my favorite coffee shops in Rochester because of its great vibe and central location. Any day is a good time to come here, but my favorite of all time is during the XRIJF - the Jazz fest held at the end of each June that turns Gibbs street into  music central. Java's is predictably PACKED and the line usually goes out the door, but nothing says summer like a Kinky Reggae on ice after all the music is over. I love to sit with a friend or two and talk about which piece of art we like. Another favorite time is first thing in the morning after hitting the gym. A cup of Pittsford Dairy chocolate milk and a bagel make a great breakfast as I dash to my car for the morning rush. The coffee - my friends who are very into roasting, pouring, and complex flavor profiles have made snide remarks about Java's brews, but for the social coffee drinker that I am (honestly, more than one cup a month is rare for me), it tastes just fine. The only negative is most of staff seems very unfriendly compared to other local coffee shops. A little smile and sincere \"thank you\" go a long way when it comes to customer service."}, {"review_id": "0cZc8EUkLhKf9u2OATrmAA", "user_id": "Pjmo0zvV8MgRM9KTJAnXOw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/30/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Because Javas is so convenient, I still do stop in sometimes. I do not know why. A few weeks ago, they jacked up their prices again.  Okay, I get it. But now some of their menu board prices are changed, but incorrect. I've pointed this out to staff twice, and they've said \"yeah we know, but I don't deal with that\". Cool, so you're still going to charge me the incorrectly advertised price. Neat. Today I went and got a(n incorrectly priced drink) and upon the last few sips, I was greeted with a mouthful of grounds. Yay, insult to injury!

Java's is my daily coffee stop on my way to work because I live across the street. I used to order a hot coffee or latte here every morning until I found their cold brew which I am proud to announce I have consistently ordered five days a week for the past year and a half. It's dark it's bold it's perfect! In the morning they can get rushed so expect an in and out of five minutes I would say on average. The baristas are friendly but for years I thought they were cold... until I realized they are literally busy OPEN TO CLOSE without exception. They have the best coffee in the city with multiple locations so it's no wonder why. The service is fantastic. They know my order and I can count on a great experience everyday with a 'good morning' and a 'have a good one'! I love this place. Even better, at night they offer a study atmosphere like no other. Plugs abound and there's always a comfy table, group table or bench seat available! The art is incredible and the music selection 9/10 times is brilliant. There's a couple pool tables downstairs for when your eyes need a break and you can pick up sticks and balls upstairs by leaving your ID at the counter. For lunch they have a great sandwiches next door and in the summer the outdoor seating is perfect. The store has an entire front of windows to people watch and great company is always easy to find. It's a great place to patronize and you're guaranteed to make friends or meet some professional contacts here. You're also guaranteed to see a terrible first tinder date here. I've sadly bore witness to many having been a loyal patron for the past three years. :) It's a great way to feel a guy out before going back to the digs to smash and Javas as two doors so if you sit on the left as you walk in or face your mystery date towards the rear of the restaurant you can Irish goodbye him when he turns out to be 20 years older with 30 extra pounds on the gullet. My order: Cold BrewTips-They don't accept discover-Tips matter here and those baristas kick ass, so treat them well-Check out their dessert cooler to the right of the bar, all homemade and all delicious. I recommend the strawberry cheesecake!Cheers!"}, {"review_id": "_eNpy3yw4yQp8LUAq55n3g", "user_id": "rvpad--x-vkLQrnDe-wOlQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/9/2017", "text": "This is the original cool coffee shop in Rochester, popular with theEastman School of Music crowd, among others.Parking has become more problematic with paid spots on thestreet.

I LOVE the sandwiches, they are so fresh! I got the special of the day, I think it was about $7, but the portion was huge and completely worth it. The design of the place is a bit strange though, the counter is so close to the door that it can get a bit awkward when you're in the line during peak hours.
