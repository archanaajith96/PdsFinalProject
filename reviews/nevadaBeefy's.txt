The space is small and cramped, or tiny and cozy depending on your frame of reference. We could definitely see how our food was prepared as we were in visual line with the cooks.However, I don't care how cozy it is if the food isn't fabulous. I like my space. But for this fantastic stuff, I will sit down, shut up and enjoy my food. It really was spectacular. Great sandwich and fries!service was good and relatively fast. Watching it being cooked and prepared kept us occupied so the time went fast.For the money, even though it is REALLY small and crammed, it is really good! You just have to try it to believe it. And maybe you'll say, \"what is the fuss\", but next time you want a sandwich, you'll think about this little place!Try it!"}, {"review_id": "mNDmw3ag7PFTdoyDR1Lfcg", "user_id": "xTppLFW__vFjDwLm0Wd2ZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Went prepared to stuff some dollars in some g-strings and see some serious bulges.

Be prepared to squeeze in! Even so, the experience is fun enough and the food is good enough to warrant the lack of space.We came on a late Friday afternoon (about 2:30) and there were a couple of seats open. I imagine this place is packed right about lunchtime! The selection of burgers is vast. I settled on the Kansas City (BBQ sauce, bacon, cheese, onion ring) and my better half, with his love of all things pork, chose The Pot Belly (ham, bacon, pastrami, cheese). We also got an order of the garlic Parmesan herb fries.We got the fries quick enough, and let me tell you, these portions are big enough to share and more! The garlic-y flavor was not too overwhelming and the fries themselves are good, thin-cut and fresh. Not the best fries ever but they certainly did the job!On to the burgers: while the patties themselves are just ok (not a lot of seasoning, no char flavor, etc,) the size and toppings are what make them special. My Kansas City burger was exactly what I wanted: bacon perfectly done, melty cheese, crispy onion ring, BBQ sauce on point. Just yummy and satisfying. The Pot Belly was also pretty darn good, though I think some porkyness gets lost when you pile it on top of itself.Again, portions are kinda ridiculous, but at about $10 per plate, at least you are getting your money's worth. Come hungry, forgo the elbow room, and enjoy a good freakin' burger!"}, {"review_id": "BW2DNK6RBquycQ2eoKftow", "user_id": "AakZOkjH-Zz0FTh0B_PI3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "First time here at Beefy's, great Burgers and fries Every time we come to Reno there never open we finally caught them this time and I am not disappointed they are worthy fresh ground beef fresh-cut fries, this place is the bomb"}, {"review_id": "MEh-Z-5SCD4r2xm4RORr5w", "user_id": "B7laWmiMZHgsxiHk2U9H9A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "OK, all of the hype is correct.

I have eaten here before based on a recommendation and yelp reviews, I was blown away the first time. It was delicious. I ordered the Stetson burger, it was just ok, hardly any blue cheese, when I order a blue burger I want to taste the cheese. I also ordered the Parmesan Herb fries, which I paid extra for and realized when I got back to work I didn't get. Way bummed about that. My coworker ordered a burger with chili cheese fries, he was also super disappointed with his fries, lots of chili but hardly any cheese. Who wants to eat chili cheese fries, with no cheese? Not me...See picture. I will give them another try, like I said the first time I was blow away, but this time it was just Mehhhh...."}, {"review_id": "DmYo3fJ9sMscy7-zBm5L4Q", "user_id": "LB7ZRhPRnjmI_cql3GZdtw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "I had heard legends of an amazing burger in midtown, boy did this burger live up to the hype !

The food was ok.  I asked for wings to come out before my burger. Vianne reminded cook two times to make wings first (appetizer) and then make cheeseburger and fries. Cook still  delivered wings and 1 minute later the burger came out.  Only ate one wing before the burger arrived. Burger was medium rare but asked for medium.  Wings were lukewarm (like they sat for a while).  Bun, meat and fries were cold (like they were made same time as wings and sat back in kitchen for a while).

She thinks the outside of the building is adorable. It is located in the heart of midtown. We came here about 12:30pm on a Saturday. The building has been here since 1947, but it has been Beefy's about 4 years. It is a really small place inside. About 15 seats inside and all seating is barstools. There are also 3 picnic tables outside. They have a nice selection of bottled beer, 4 taps and some wine. The menu consists of comfort food and all looks delicious. I ordered the cheese steak and my wife ordered the patty melt. The waitress told us the fries are big enough to share so we ordered those too. The cheese steak sandwich was huge and  our food was deliciousAnother couple next to us at the counter ordered deepfried Oreos served on ice cream. We also saw a maple bacon milkshake on the menu as well as Amaretto or Bailey's milkshakes for big kids. They serve their milkshakes in the stainless malt cup. We think this is a hidden gem in Reno and will recommend to others."}, {"review_id": "AL3DYM_jsilFRGSCEQnhsg", "user_id": "MR5_px0fiocOZso_vGtjdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Truly the BEST burgers ever!!!!

Nothing is a better site than walking into the place and seeing boxes of potatoes. This gave me confidence. This small place is cranking out a quality burger and fry. The front of the house was not managed with the most efficiency but the kitchen team was on point. Seeing counter staff openly munch on sandwich and then pass out plates was not appealing. They got my Togo order wrong and made it for here. So I went with the flow and began my chow. It's a good burger. Think non corporate five guys. The bread to beef ratio was not off. The meat tastes like meat. The fries are done right.
