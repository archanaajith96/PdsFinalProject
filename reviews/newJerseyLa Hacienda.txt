After my parents gave me recommendations of different things to order I decided why the hell not. Although Hacienda is a Mexican restaurant it has more of a bar feel. It is extremely loud and there's a lot of hustle and bustle. The bar is in the center of the restaurant which makes it hard to retrieve drinks when it is packed. We started off with the frozen peach margarita which was delicious. They do not skimp on the alcohol and it's sweet like candy. We were blessed with salsa and chips which is highly addictive. Be forewarned that extra salsa, chips, refills of a soda or juice are not included. Trust me the salsa and chips are totally worth the few extra dollars! I believe we ended up ordering three more salsas after the complimentary one evaporated in less than five minutes.For our apps we ordered the Alas De Pollo En Fuego. It's chicken wings marinated in a zesty house sauce and then fried. We also feasted on the Todo Mexicano. The platter is a mix of appetizers that include chicken quesadillas, grilled shrimp, empandas, fried calamari, and wings. My favorite from the platter are the wings and grilled shrimp. The chicken quesadilla was good but had way too much chicken in it for such a small piece. I couldn't enjoy it. The Calamari was fried too hard and I've definitely had better. Besides the dipping sauce provided was bland. For our entrees we ordered the steak which came with rice and beans. The seafood enchilada came with rice and beans. I ordered the fajitas suprema which included shrimp, steak, chicken, onions, peppers, fresh tortillas, pico de gallo, sour cream, guacamole, with a side of rice and beans. The food was delicious and the portions were beyond huge. We took the majority of our food home because we were full from the apps and drinks."}, {"review_id": "FBXvtCoh9WBlb2BqMEummw", "user_id": "lJIG_pPKag2czkcemMbRtg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "I've been there about 3-4 times for lunch, gotta say food is amazing, the lunch specials are really good, the food has the right amount of spice on it for my taste.

It took 45 minutes for out food to get to the table after we sat down our waiter came back when we were more than half way done with our food. he literally came back to take the plates.

Food is good, unfortunately a mexican restaurant staple ( Chips & Salsa) are not automatically served unless requested $2.50. Have had the enchiladas- very good, nicely filled and cheesy. Beef quesadillas, served with some noce pieces of cheesy steak and grilled served with pico, guac and sour cream. If you like straight up original Mexican tacos, not your place this are more on the Tex Mex side- served with sour cream, cheese and guac on top.Service can be somewhat better specially at busier times, maybe one more on staff. Overall thoroughly enjoy every time I visit La Hacienda.

Which is not a bad thing at all, I really enjoyed the food! Started out with chips and homemade salsa (spicy!) followed by margaritas. People are not kidding when they say that the margaritas here are STRONG! They have so many different flavors that it's hard to choose - regular, mango, raspberry, melon, pomegranate (plus many more that I don't remember). You can never go wrong with a traditional margarita with salt on the rim.For the entree, I ordered Enchiladas Rancheras but asked for them to go light on the cheese. I guess we all have different opinions of what \"light\" cheese is (as you can see from my photos, that does not seem light) but it's relatively easy to remove it so no harm no foul. Everything was great but the only problem I have is that this place is SO LOUD. You can't hear yourself think let alone speak which I'm not a fan of. I don't want to have to scream over people as I'm eating. Otherwise I really enjoyed this place and will be back.Unfortunately, we didn't get to try dessert because the meals were so big (aka you get so full) but all of the desserts sound AMAZING.BANANA CARAMEL CHEESECAKE XANGOS. That is all."}, {"review_id": "6_KDrUi_pmLd59Jwir3fIQ", "user_id": "H7oNvn0Kmi8NDnCMd1KYAw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/17/2017", "text": "Very busy place for Sunday night. Atmospher was very casual. Little small area, so the tables are small and next to each other, very close. Have few outside seating too. I think it was music night or something, so they have 4 band person, playing nice Spanish music and songs. Complimentary chips and salsa was good. But just heads up...Only one basket of chips and one small cup of salsa is Complimentary. (doesn't matter you are party of 2 or 6, as I notice, 2 ppl table got same as our 6 ppl table.)....after that each small cup of salsa cost you $1.69  and basket of chips cost you little more than $3, which come with small cup of salsa. (we didn't know and paid almost $10 for salsa...as one small cup is not enough for 6 ppl)Nacho was ok...queso was goodTaco salad is not worthed to order...You will get full of lettuce and couple of spoon of black beans. Vegitarian plate (burrito/Enchilada/rice/beans) was good. Vegetable fajitas was good too.

Our server was so patient and attentive. Some people wanted salt rimmed glasses and others didn't, but he made it work. Poured our ritas too! The chips served with salsa and guac were warm and fresh. I ordered a taco salad with beef, which was mostly delicious. They use a spicy avocado sauce which complements the meat flavor well. I found some of the beef a little chewy that's probably the only thing holding back 5 stars."}, {"review_id": "A2t0tuPRUFObH_WDO6Tq0g", "user_id": "XepqD_EXJn6K9O1n71cUIg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "My favorite authentic Mexican Restaurant for years.

Place was packed at 7:30 on a Sunday which I didn't think it would be since it was my first time here. Parking lot is big but because the place is small and has a high volume of people ( which is a good thing ) it was hard to find parking. Came in with a party of 6 and didn't get seated till 8:30. Ordered fast and food came out decently fast. 10 mins after everyone hit their food I asked my server why I didn't get mine and he told me he didn't put it in. He was apologetic and put the food order in. I ordered Mari mar salad which only consisted of calamari scallops and shrimps took it 25 mins for it to come out. By that time all my friends were almost done. I asked to get it wrapped and was still charged I only took 3 bites. The atmosphere was kind of loud and the place was nice . Kind of smelled like wet mop. I would go there again because the food was really good. And the virgin pina coladas were good.

We ordered chicken quesadilla for appetizer. The servings are so big, we could have had that for dinner. I recommend ordering that appetizer to share. We ordered for dinner the beef enchiladas and  \"todo mejicano\" appetizer. Todo mejicano has empanadas, shrimp, calamari, chicken wings, and Quesadillas. For 2 people, you could have only 1 of these two dishes. It was a lot of food!... but all delicious! The only downside I see in this place, is the dining room is very noisy.
