I have tried my fair share, and honestly am rarely wow'd even by \"prime\" steakhouses.That is why I'm taking the time to write this review; I tried The Drover's bine-in ribeye, with their signature whiskey marinade, while traveling in Omaha. I was pleasantly surprised by the rich flavor of that steak, paired with it being cooked exactly right. This is no gimmick of any sort, the whiskey flavor comes out as a subtle undertone that enhances the charred bits on the outside, yet doesn't overpower or take away the actual flavor of the steak.The atmosphere of the venue is very fitting for the steaks they serve: simple and old-school. If in Omaha, then The Drover is a must-try stop."}, {"review_id": "Drh8tzaSbokWTrcajt-Hzw", "user_id": "PFufFKiTp1doeJf7y_-eBA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/8/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I think I ma be the only person in all of OMAHA that doesn't thing this place is the shizznit. The steak was ok, the service was mediocre, the place itself was rundown and in some serious need it cleaning and updating. And I honestly feel I was overpaid for my meal. Maybe it's a OMAHA thing and because I'm not a native omahaian, I don't get it.

This place was awesome and old school. We went on a Wednesday evening and the restaurant was hopping. They have a standard beer and wine menu, and a cocktail waitress is happy to serve you a drink while you wait for your table.Once seated you're served yummy bread with warm butter. We both tried the whiskey filets - cooked perfectly! The steaks come with the salad bar which is awesome and a choice of a side (we went with baked potatoes). Bring your wallet, our meal for 2 set us back $150.00 -  but it was worth it!This place has an old school vibe and welcoming hospitality.

I had such high expectations, and unfortunately, it fell far below. Ambiance - Classic country steakhouse with a cabin-ey, woody feel. Coming from Texas, this is nothing out of the ordinary.Service - The server was courteous and patient with our orders. Also had great recommendations and suggestions. Food: - Broccoli cheese soup - this was delicious and soooo huge. I had to stop myself from eating to make room for the steak.- Asparagus - my friends opted for the loaded baked potato (which they thought was okay), but I thought the asparagus side was delicious and balanced out the heavy steak nicely.- Whiskey Steak - I had such high expectations because this was the most recommended place and item in Omaha. It was a decent traditional steak, but there was just nothing special. Honestly, it looked and tasted like it was just a big glob of meat that was grilled/charred. Maybe it's because I'm use to Texas steak or my expectations were too high, but I would not get the whiskey steak again.Pricing - The steak itself was $44 but did come with option of salad/soup or veggies/baked potatoes. There was a lot of sides that came with the entrees.  Overall, this was a huge letdown after all the excitement about eating the best food in Omaha. Once was enough for me and I would probably pass next time I'm in Omaha and my friends would say the same."}, {"review_id": "gwop0WtFAFxGV_LgZGzVIw", "user_id": "qqmnWI2P5hHTOa3esjvfJQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "New in town and I asked around for good steak houses, this was one that kept coming up! Called ahead on a Thursday for 630 reservations, when we got there the place was pretty empty so we got sat right down. It's got that \"old school steak house\" feel. Dimly light, nothing too fancy but looked nice. Just my kinda place. Waiter came right over, got our beer orders and brought us some bread. I had the beer cheese soup to start, very rich, think and delicious. Perfect to dip the complementary bread in. I ordered the 14oz whiskey ribeye. (The waiter really sold me on the whiskey marinade so I was very excited). Food took a about 45 mins to come out. Now the steak itself is the only reason I came, maybe I just had high expectations but it wasn't anything that blew my socks off... it was good, don't get me wrong BUT the flavor and tenderness just seemed kinda off. I will say that it was cooked perfectly, beautiful medium rare steak. For me I just can't go 5 stars because I think there might be better spots around here. Time will tell...But overall pretty good."}, {"review_id": "uo7sooxduvF14rGwKVTcng", "user_id": "k1DUnGCEGsVE-kaCimakZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Dear Drover: never change. I enjoyed everything about this place. The interior is dimly lit and reminds me of classic steakhouses found outside of urban areas. The people are super friendly. And most importantly the steak is worth the hype. I recommend the whiskey filet. It was unbelievably tender and the char had such incredible flavor. Order it with red wine.

But what it lacks in modern decor, it makes up for in a pretty good steak. The wait is not so bad, but I do recommend making reservations if you're hungry and not keen on sitting at the bar. I ordered the whiskey filet and the meat was very tender. It was a little overcooked on the sides, but overall still tender and had good flavor, albeit a little salty. They also have a good selection of cabernet to pair well with the steaks. All in all, the service is not as bad as what everyone says, the salad bar is mediocre at best (not sure why people rave about the fact that the tiles are from the 60 years ago), but it's an old school steak house that serves pretty good steaks."}, {"review_id": "iBTTDWkOFGOcEWYUrK5KLA", "user_id": "nr35WjC-YI0dFcsnW33Szw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "Best Steak House in Omaha.

The second time, we went on a Friday around 7. There were no tables available, but they had room at the bar - no problem.

Being from WI, I love the dark super club feel of this place. The highlights were our server, the wine list (great choice and price points), the loaded baked potato, and my husband really liked his steak. We sat at the bar before dinner and bar service was average. Salad bar was also average with only a couple veggie choices and it was messy. The salad dressings were good. My prime T-bone was fine but it was more rare then I asked for. I happily finished my baked potato though! My husbands ribeye was cooked perfectly but I didn't like the whiskey sauce (luckily he loved it!) I would happily try this place again, mostly because of that baked potato."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-drover-omaha?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
