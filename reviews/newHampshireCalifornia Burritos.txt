Knowing absolutely nothing about the area, I opened up Yelp to see what locals are raving about and saw this place. I did what any bride-to-be obsessed over her wedding diet would do: order way too much food. - Quesadilla- Carne asada fries- Chips + guac While this place isn't necessarily authentic, it is soooooooooooo good. Their quesadillas aren't just meat and cheese pressed between tortillas, they fill it with whatever fillings you want. It's like a burrito panini. SO good! The carne asada fries seemed like a great idea, but I was gonna pass on it cuz #weddingdiet..... until I saw it on another party's table. It turned out to be the right idea. The fries to topping ratio was perfect. Chips and guac were chips and guac. Nothing to complain. Bonus: It felt like each person I interacted with went out of their way to be suuuuuper nice. I think the guy was the manager but even though this place is fast-casual dining, he constantly checked up on patrons to see if they needed anything. It felt like I was at a Chick-Fil-A. Completely unexpected, but certainly a great touch to a phenomenal meal. I will certainly be back when I'm in the area!"}, {"review_id": "E5NntJyxtJw4iwOUfueKQA", "user_id": "rTIQLOFJZ2aAwAsJwPXoIQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "Pros: Clean, bright, colorful atmosphere. Sometimes there is a line, but it always moves very quickly. Friendly, pleasant employees. Great burritos, tacos--all foods made fresh in front of you. Consistent in quality and always delicious. Large portions of deliciousness. Can't beat the pricing! I get a quick dinner for about $10. Plus, I get to practice my Spanish :)Cons: Usually chilly in the dining area. Metal seats are not comfortable. I always make sure to bring a sweater to wear, sit on. Small parking area.Overall, I highly recommend California Burritos for a quick, basically healthy meal, right off the main drag in Nashua."}, {"review_id": "ghymC5lQhx0bGVt3Oz56bQ", "user_id": "PjC4EC8W68ZAwuV3l7lPkw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/12/2017", "text": "Best Mexican place around!! I wish the place was bigger for seating but it's fine. There's parking right outside of it. The foods worth coming here for. Wicked busy during lunch hours and right after work. The line may look long but it moves quickly. You see your meal prepped right in front of you. I usually get the bowl, you get more for your money! The staff here are very friendly and welcoming. I wanted a margarita for lunch with my bowl but it's only served during their dinner hours. Will definitely be coming back with friends!"}, {"review_id": "9_W9NRw5nXOgovlYFI_gmw", "user_id": "Xsd3C9gSlQ_-jVFOp9fW-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Great food and atmosphere, love the Spanish feel inside and out.

Didn't quite expect to find a nice, authentic Mexican place in the area yet this place surprised me! Had their infamous fish tacos, a quesadilla, along with a plate of tortilla chips on the side. All of them were tasty, especially the fish tacos! I love the sauce that they put on it: creamy, a little bit spicy, but also sweet. My recommendation is to go with the flour tortilla for the fish tacos, just so it balances the rich flavor from the tacos. Overall, I had a pleasant experience and would definitely come back when I'm in the area! Tip: get the pico de gallo as the salsa!"}, {"review_id": "6pzU759C4BdDjgc78cd5-g", "user_id": "0-H9ASZU3JtiI5QNM1abbA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/22/2017", "text": "Stopped in briefly to grab a burrito before work. I liked the atmosphere, bright and colorful, clean, open space.Service was fairly quick as you move down the line building your burrito. The carnitas looked quite tasty. The pork was very tasty, burrito was pretty good. Only complaint was if felt like either the rice or beans were firm and undercooked. The mango salsa chosen was homemade, and added a nice sweetness to the burrito. It was very good."}, {"review_id": "iX4EE-1js-UCeSN_xSr4Aw", "user_id": "HzaZZ4lsgz_Ts22bfLHUpw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Really authentic and delicious burrito place in town.

I had my first ever burrito here and it was phenomenal. I've since then tried many different restaurants' burritos but none have compared to this place. I made my family come here 3 times in one week just because every time I had a burrito, I craved another. Nowadays, I get 2 burritos because 1 is not enough! I order the same thing every time: steak burrito with cheese, lettuce, salsa, guacamole, and rice. My mom has tried the quesadillas and loves those too. Ordering is very easy and they are able to make food very fast as they cooked their food, keep it heated, and serve when a customer comes in. The service is great as well and they don't make mistakes often. Highly recommend this place to everybody in the Nashua area!"}, {"review_id": "Ud9h3NAn6hvR6guNPHX5bA", "user_id": "Lm6l3W1RZBucOH-uHoy1cQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/5/2017", "text": "DELICIOUS ingredients are fresh, steak was tender and the flavor was amazing.
