I hadn't even heard of Ruuthai's, but I saw it in the program at the Klein Memorial and thought I'd give it a try. I ordered on GrubHub, but went to pick it up to stave off a case of cabin fever. I got two orders of shrimp pad thai and a salad.  Two-go dishes can sometimes be skimpy, but the serving of pad thai was quite generous with plenty of noodles, chopped peanuts, and sprouts.  They also packed four shrimp in each dish.  The salad was the usual offering at a thai restaurant (lettuce, tomato, cucumber, carrot), but the dressing was a real treat.  Usually the peanut dressing can be a bit thick, but Ruuthai's version is a touch lighter and a much better match for a salad.  I love that Ruuthai's seems really authentic.  All of the food seems to be on point and the setting isn't too fussy.  Along with the seating, there is a wall of coolers with to-go items and, apparently, storage.  It reminded me of the kind of place we used to seek out when I lived in Boston and each week we'd try a different ethnic restaurant.  I am thrilled that we have a bit of that authenticity right here in Bridgeport."}, {"review_id": "hxhfqEI3jjj4RQs16rxYDA", "user_id": "S18PKJu5bQIbHAuBhSe7eQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "I have eaten at other Thai restaurants before. Not very often, it's not my favorite type of food.  After have eaten at Ruuthai's tonight, I learned that there are other Thai restaurants and then there is Ruuthai's. I only tried 1 item (Duck Curry) but I can already tell that this food is at a different level. The flavor was more complex, deep; but not heavy.  Nice portion for not a lot money too."}, {"review_id": "ohd2XnFkM-SN3LMwx66uQQ", "user_id": "4O87uUSWLP-89xMe3nHXtA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "This place is the real deal.

The good was we were able to get right in and seated, food / service was fast, and we had no problem getting out in a reasonable time. There was nothing \"bad\" per se, but the food was just really mediocre - no real level of spice to be found in most of the dishes, so everything ended up being pretty bland. I'm not sure if we just ordered wrong (most people got 1 or 2 \"chili\"-marked dishes) but the curries were only OK (the table had massaman, panang, and red curry and the reaction was all basically the same). Unlikely to head back unfortunately."}, {"review_id": "GRrDVYibWxTmGe4msmcHxg", "user_id": "KyAamyR5nbMSFVfUwfRSEA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "We've been to Ruuthai's Kitchen several times now.  Each dish we've tried was excellent.  Our favorite is Massaman Curry, which we get with tofu.  The place is clean, the staff is pleasant and attentive, and the food is great.  The decor is fun, reflecting a Thai Buddhist culture.  We'll be back often."}, {"review_id": "9tWyKO6aHyutqw_7QpdWuA", "user_id": "V6R0djDaUBqSDEXPhEI6eg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/19/2016", "text": "This place is situated in a residential neighborhood in Bridgeport. As such, the atmosphere is less than ideal and parking option is only street side. However, the owners have done an amazing job of making it a fun, colorful, and inviting space.The Tom Yum is quite good. Many Thai places overpower the Tom yum with dry spices that make the broth gritty. This is not the case here. Papaya salad is not overpowered with spice and fish sauce. It's fresh tasting and papaya remains crisp. Beef salad was satisfying. The meat was not too tough often associated with this dish. There was no \"jerky\" texture. The green curry was on point and very spicy. One of the better green curry dishes in Fairfield County."}, {"review_id": "PBncrq7uhRw08Phx_8XKZQ", "user_id": "t0Tw10nUBKuCqfOky2e9EQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2017", "text": "My favorite Thai food in the area. I lived in Queens for 4 years and was very spoiled with all the Thai restaurants there. I moved to Fairfield and have not found anything comparable until Ruuithai. My all time favorite is the Boat Noodles. You will not find this on the menu at any other Thai restaurants in Fairfield County. Very friendly staff and their prices are very reasonable for the quality and flavors of their dishes. The area is ehhh. Just park as close as you can and run to restaurant (over dramatizing just a bit) but seriously walk fast."}, {"review_id": "XhxGW4Mjdne1oTvMmIAz1Q", "user_id": "AVoIOTqv6eisMHRPSW1CVQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/17/2017", "text": "My brother and I have been coming here for the last few years.  Every time we have eaten at the restaurant or ordered from their menu, it has been nothing short of perfect. The food is delicious, the staff is friendly and polite, and service is great! We recently came for lunch and were impressed by their recent upgrade. The menu looks great and offers a large variety of items; you can't go wrong with the pad Thai or drunken noodles lunch special!Additionally, they have redesigned their decor, added new seating AND a customer friendly bathroom. We loved the new look and menu plus the food was served quick and tasted great as usual. The location is tucked away in a neighborhood just over the Fairfield line so be prepared to park on the street.  We've never had an issue finding a close spot though! 10/10 Best Thai in Fairfield county! :)"}, {"review_id": "fOJfZ90rca7m-Lf53cmt-g", "user_id": "WyZ_xAK0zizdyGO9ZNUxtA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/10/2017", "text": "The most authentic Thai food in Connecticut.

We were visiting friends and we literally ate here 3 out of 4 days.  Crazy, huh? If you order your food \"Thai style\" you get more spices and heat.  To the regular North American palate, it might be too intense, but find yourself and your preferences accordingly.  Look out for the chilli symbols and don't complain if it's too hot.  Know your own tolerance level!  We loved it!The tom yum noodles are NOTHING like the typical broth.  This soup was just bursting with flavours.  Sweet, spicy, tangy, savoury...  Minced pork, bits of crunchy fried pork, meatballs, fried wontons and of course rice noodles with some bean sprouts.  Fan-freaking-tastic.  You sweat while eating this because it's temperature hot with a spicy flavour but you honestly can't stop eating it.We tried the boat noodles, drunken noodles, fried rice, pad ka prow, larb, soft shelled crab with mango salad, mussels omelette, pad thai, and a vermicelli dish with shrimp but I can't recall the name.  The picture is on the fridge so you can find out there.  We polished off each and every dish.  The prices are totally reasonable for what you get.  I'm from Canada and even with the crummy exchange rate at this time, we felt it was well worth it.  It's nice to be able to support a local, family owned business.  I wish them success as they truly deserve it.  Don't forget to check out all the accolades they've received in the Connecticut area!  I wish I ordered the soft shelled crab to eat in the car on my way back north.  It's only a six hour drive from Montreal.  Until next time!"}, {"review_id": "9uS7YODI7tpJv36v5kxCMg", "user_id": "Q4uH1y1tVgYX1K9KZtFf2Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/9/2017", "text": "Very, very good food in a bright, cheery and clean setting.

However, I give it three stars because I think that they don't provide a good amount of meats and vegetables in their food. They charge $6 extra for beef! I also believe their hours and days that they are open vary a lot. I live three blocks away so we have ordered from them a couple of times. Some Sundays and Mondays they are open while others they are not. Also they close at 9 which is a little early while many other restaurants usually close at 11."}, {"review_id": "xlDNMZxhQR5gmt_aaI6DLw", "user_id": "j0utqMaqvI1_DsIXwKcbCg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/22/2017", "text": "I got the chicken wings, the chicken wontons, and the pad see-ew with beef.
