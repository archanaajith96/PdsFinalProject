We came around 6 and there was no wait. We were seating immediately. We sat in front of a glass window where we could see them making the udon noodles. I got the creamy uni udon and my boyfriend got the bacon creamy udon. This is one of the best uni pasta-like dish I have had. I couldn't finish it and it was still good to-go later that night. My boyfriend loved his as well. Very creamy and the udon was cooked to perfection.

We found this yummy noodle shop and decided to stop by.I ordered the lunch special; duck udon noodle soup with a beef rice bowl. The beef rice bowl I thoroughly enjoyed. The udon noodle broth was very well prepared. Lots of flavor. The duck itself was a bit dry and average. The noodles had a nice bite to them and tasted fresh. The shop isn't the biggest but it is nice and cozy.

My table ordered a few appetizers along with the sea urchin, curry, and carbonara bacon udon dishes. All were delicious. I grew up eating a lot of udon noodles and this was the first time having it in a warm, creamy, savory sauce along with sea urchin. I'm a huge fan of Asian fusion dishes and this place definitely hits the spot! I'm not sure when I'll ever have these noodles again as I was just visiting LA for a day :-(.

If you can score some seating right in front of this window, you'd be entertained for sure. If not, prepare for some tight seating where you will intimately dine with other customers near you. While I have enjoyed several dishes, the miso carbonara continues to be an all-time winner and ultimate indulgent dish that I continue to re-order. You can't go wrong with this.

Um, yea, let's eat there!Parking: Street metered parking and paid, public parking lots all around. We work nearby and so we walked over.The coworker and I were trying to figure out what to eat for lunch - he wanted pizza, but I wanted Spitz (doner), and so we compromised on ramen, especially when we walked by Daikokuya and Marugame Monzo. We got to Daikokuya first, but they were still closed, and with good luck, Marugame Monzo was opened, and no line! As we entered, we were immediately greeted, and waited 2mins while they cleaned up our table, and we were then seated (by the window). After a quick browse, here's what we got:Drinks: Iced water - just one glass each was all we needed.My coworker got the Kitsune Udon $9 + $4 Mini Beef Rice Bowl Lunch Deal. His Udon Bowl consisted of udon, seasoned beancurds and green onions. His mini beef rice bowl looked hearty and good. He dig the soft bed of rice. Overall, he enjoyed his meal. As for me...I got the $12.75 Kakuni Bowl (no mini rice bowl for me). This meal by itself was delicious and filling. The Udon Bowl consisted of fresh, thick, yummy udon. Topped with green onion, and served with three tasty, GIANT pieces of braised, fatty pork belly (two of which were tender, while the last one was a bit tough and chewy). Best of all, I loved the broth! So clean, light and great tasting! The right amount of sodium without feeling so thirsty afterwards! I would get this Udon Bowl again, so good!Service: Our servers were polite and friendly. They got our orders down, and the food came out quickly. We were in and out within 30mins, cool!Ambience/Decor: Compact, but clean and cozy organized seating. They used up every nook and cranny efficiently! Also, if you sit at the bar, you'll get a free show. You can watch the cooks make the fresh udon right before your eyes!After our meals, my coworker and I both loved the broth, and will definitely be coming back here to try out their creamy udon. Originally, we were gonna get those, but decided not to because of our limited lunch hour, and we didn't want to be sleepy coming back to work, lol!Nonetheless, we got our eyes on the next ones:1. Sea Urchin Cream Udon2. Carbonara Bacon Udon3. Mentai Squid Butter UdonLooking forward to returning back here for the creamy udon bowls. If their creamy udon bowls are worth the hype, then I'm definitely gonna be giving it 5 Stars. Until then, 4 solid delicious stars!"}, {"review_id": "-WqGrZJqoDJrp01MWeQ0CA", "user_id": "wdXrFg8yYXc7C1oc2kS1mg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "I always walk by this place when I'm in Little Tokyo and never realized that it was the infamous udon place everyone raves about. | w a i t |I was expecting the dinner rush and a long wait because we came on a Saturday evening.

Beef Udon - The waiter recommended this to me. The beef was thinly sliced. The overall dish wasn't heavy, but I wished the broth was warmer and had more flavor. 2. Miso Carbonara - Omg if I wasn't so lactose intolerant, I would be all in on this!!! This is my friend's fave and I can see why!! It's definitely on the heavier side.

I don't think they give phone calls or anything but they do tell you an approximate wait so just be sure to be back so they don't skip your name!

There's an open kitchen where you can view the chefs making udon noodles.Everything looked delicious on the menu. I couldn't decide on what to order. I ended up trying the curry udon. The udon noodles were good, not soggy or hard. It has a good texture. The curry favor was flavorful and also not too spicy. I would definitely come back and try the other menu items.

We drove by the place where there appeared to be a long line of people waiting for the place to open already so the BF dropped me off and got in line to wait. As soon as they opened, the folks there literally sat probably the first 30-35 people that were in line. I was next in line and there was one table left for two and because the BF wasn't with me as they were about to sit me they made me put my name on their waiting list and sit the couple that was waiting in line behind. I can't tell you how irritated I was by that because the BF came moments later after I had to write my name down on the waiting list and he was extremely irritated and didn't even want to leave a tip. Don't worry, we did leave a tip once we finished our food. About 30 minutes or so later, we were seated at a table and since we looked over the menu while we were waiting we ordered our food right away. I went with their signature sea urchin udon and the BF went with the pork belly udon and a pork belly rice bowl on the side. Once we got our food and tasted the dishes, our angst against the place went away. The food is very much worth the wait. The uni udon was full of flavor and there was a lot of uni in it to my surprise. I thought there wouldn't be as much but glad there was. We were both also surprised by the pork belly udon because we didn't think the udon would have giant pieces of pork belly in it. We were anticipating it to be sliced thinly but no, they were giant pieces. We weren't mad at it though. So if you decide to come here, be willing to wait and have your entire party with you when you come.

Try their uni udon or the mentai squid butter udon. But for me, beef udon for the win. Prepare for ~$20 per person.Well, throughout the years I've tasted this place, I can say that the taste quality of the place has gone down. But don't get me wrong, the taste probably went down from a 5-star to a 4-star place. Nonetheless, this place is one of the places you must try for an udon restaurant in LA.This place does beef udon justice. Though you can find beef udon in many restaurants, this place is easily one of the best. The broth was satisfying to drink, the udon was not too soft and not too hard, but the best part was the beef. Crispy ends, tender, and carries the broth well. Some green onions on every bite, plus a helping scoop of the broth and udon really makes one's Saturday.And, of course, the staple recommendation from this place will be the mentai squid butter udon and the uni udon! These two were ones I've tried before and they were amazing! This past weekend, not as much, but still great!Parking is quite hard to find, but find it! Staff was great and made sure that we were taken care of. The line in this place during lunch and dinner hours do build up quickly, so coming at odd hours might help you get a seat faster. Coming in parties of 2 also helps because they have many more small tables compared to larger groups.The prices of each udon dish is fair, in my opinion. They're pricey yet leaves you feeling full. Do their lunch combo which pairs your udon with Â a rice bowl for a few dollars extra ($3-$4 if memory serves correct)Well, all in all, I'll always recommend this place to others if they like udon!"}, {"review_id": "wPSLHwdFnAkzOx-0WLtxQA", "user_id": "La-2Uo8fRfGMgxOAmQRZuA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Consistently delicious and good service.
