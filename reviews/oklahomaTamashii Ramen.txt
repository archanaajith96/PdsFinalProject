The flavor of the broth is complex and fully developed. The soft boiled egg is pure gold. I mean really. I love that you can custom and bowl to your exact specifications. This makes me so happy. Last visit I had the Tsukemen and Hubby had Spicy. Both are fantastic although completely different flavor profiles. The Tsukemen is very rich and I do not recommend it for ramen newbies and it may be too much for you as this complex broth is made with both pork and fish. The Spicy is a great option if you are a spicy lover. I got my bowl as is as it already comes pretty loaded. Hubby added a soft boiled egg and pork belly. I can't review Tamashii without mentioning the garlic fried rice. The hype is real. So simple yet so so delicious. A must order every time."}, {"review_id": "dRl-Sja1PcJAb1xpTbdjnw", "user_id": "s3bGG4IUh-OZ6CgeZsU7Sg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "I literally work down the street from Tamashii and finally got to try out this place. The wait for three people on a Friday night was about 45 minutes. It was fine waiting for our table because the weather was so nice out. My party and I all had the spicy ramen with a hardboiled egg added. The egg could have been a bit more salty, but I was blown away with everything else. The ground pork, the broth, and the noodles were all on point. It was spicy, but not too spicy that it overpowers other flavors in the ramen. Service was also excellent in that the server continued to refill our glasses of water. The restaurant was bustling with customers going in and out, yet the server and the rest of the staff were quick on their feet. My friend dropped her purse on the floor and another staff member rushed over with a hook so my friend can hang her purse on the table. In addition to the yummy ramen, the staff provided excellent service!"}, {"review_id": "j9U8Gmf4zE7h67u-WUCs3Q", "user_id": "E0mxkE42EC5gnQitrde6Sg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "My husband and I go here for date night as they accommodate carnivores (my husband) and vegetarians (me) alike.

Waaaay too excited than I care to admit. I knew that I absolutely had to go here.During lunch hours, the area gets super busy so parking can be difficult to come by. Most of the parking nearby is metered, but there are a few free spots close to the restaurant. We were lucky enough to snag one of those coveted spots. This ramen place is pretty small. Only a handful of booths inside, with a few more seats at the bar. They have an outdoor patio with seating, but when it's really cold and windy, that's the last place you want to sit!Four of us shared a couple appetizers - gyoza and kaarage. The gyoza were crispy and flavorful. The kaarage we would probably pass on in the future as it wasn't anything special. After looking at the menu for about 0.02 seconds, I knew I wanted to try the ninniku tonkotsu ramen. Four types of garlic? Count me in. We ordered two of those and also ordered the normal tonkotsu ramen to compare. The ninniku ramen was as amazing as I hoped it would be. Super garlicky but surprisingly, it wasn't overwhelmingly so to where I couldn't taste anything else. I loved it! The regular tonkotsu was tasty as well but we all agreed we preferred the ninniku.To finish the meal, we shared a few ice cream mochi and a scoop of ice cream. They served the mochi on skewers so it made it fun to eat!Tamashii was easily one of the best tonkotsu ramen places I've found outside of California! Absolutely would recommend this spot to anyone! I wish I could go back!"}, {"review_id": "XcvhQiZn24t2dCGjkDppOw", "user_id": "BIyAdT2mJnVYyfyn3czdIQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "We have been wanting to try this place for quite some time and finally made it in.

I've tried many different ramens, especially ones in Japan! I know it must be very hard to be on-par with authentic ramen from Japan. But I'm going to have to be honest: the broth had no depth to it at all. I've heard that they take a lot of time to create the broth but It just tasted like soy sauce/salt with some hot water to be completely blunt. Their bamboo shoots and pork are very tasty though! I did decide to come back several months later after hearing more positive reviews. I got their tonkotsu ramen and it definitely looked appetizing and their portions are more generous than Goro ramen. However, the flavor of their broth didn't improve as much as I had hoped. I believe their other Japanese dishes such as their takoyaki is actually delicious!"}, {"review_id": "TNxePAnXVlS9_WzAOSFVbw", "user_id": "XZs7jjo4Exa7Uv_xIvOK8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/8/2017", "text": "Recent experience: Coldest day of the year, and my throat is starting to feel raw and yearning for soothing broth. I mentally review the options nearby, decide on the richness of ramen, and choose to venture to midtown*. Weirdly, I love the heavy door. It's stupidly difficult to open, so once you make your way into the crowded space to a rather passionate standard Japanese restaurant greeting, \"いらっしゃいませ (irasshaimase) !\" (welcome to ramen, Okies!), you feel secure there in a dark, bustling eating-is-business mood. I sit at the bar (which I desperately wish I were tall enough to see over into the kitchen better) and wait for service. It comes quickly, suggestions are made, and the order is in.As you watch cooks paddle the giant steaming bowls of rich, nourishing stock, Tamashii delivers quickly.  Ramen arrives in beautiful deep cobalt bowls, and it's hard to stop from leaning over it and thanking God ramen can be found on such a bitter cold day. The guy next to me at the bar is moaning over his steaming bowl of ramen and it's a bit of a \"me too\" situation, but not in a 2017 way.I made the right decision to feed my cold with garlic tonkatsu, and I can't help but go all Tampopo in my head despite the manga playing on the screen above. Maybe the guy next to me has something to do with that. Anyway, I couldn't finish it all, so (pro tip) I took the remaining salty broth (yo, this is not for a low sodium diet) home (criminal to leave that behind) to later add to a chicken soup with spinach and other delights. You're welcome. *Midtown over the Plaza District because as much as I love silent Kurosawa, I just can't deal with parking there. Plus, it's been awhile since I've been in Tamashii."}, {"review_id": "NpQAoTleypTXlchKqNktDQ", "user_id": "1iN3lPdSB1jRjBdspxk84Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Not coming back here. I got the garlic ramen and it was soooo salty! I'm Asian, tried different types of Asian food (especially Japanese) growing up so I know what's good and what's not. Haven't lived here in the mainland that long but the Asian food here in OKC is severely lacking and now I know not to trust the reviews because it's majority Americans that hasn't had much experience with Asian food or it's just easy to please their pallet but idk! Ive already tried a few Asian restaurants with great reviews and was disappointed. Not only was my ramen salty, my broth was lukewarm and because of that, my ramen was hard. I tried my boyfriends own, which he had the spicy ramen and his was super hot and his noodles were softer. I've already started making my own Korean food at home because I was tired of spending a lot of money and not being satisfied with the quality of food. We also got the karage chicken and gyoza. They both were just very bland. I've definitely tried better. The best part about the karage was the white sauce. Tasted like garlic and mayo. The gyoza was just very plain. Lacks flavor. It bothers me how plain their gyoza is. I don't understand how they serve that to people. The store bought Ling Ling potstickers are sooooo much more tastier. I used to get it on base in Guam but haven't found any here yet. I think now, I'll stick with home made or packaged bought ramen. Definitely more appetizing than this. I even downed my water because it was so salty. I'm really starting to miss Hawaii and Guam and the diversity and quality of their food there. Even Texas has decent Asian food.

I couldn't have asked for better birthday food! I think it'll be a long while before another restaurant wows me like Tamashii did. First off, never judge a book by its cover, people. I mean, this is advice to be followed in general but especially in regards to Tamashii. The restaurant is in a tiny white-bricked building that, at first glance, made me think \"pssh they can't even make their building look nice pshhhhh\". But once I stepped in, I was reminded of my own vanity. Gomen'nasai, Tamashii...There was anime playing on the TVs and servers/staff shouting Japanese greetings as you entered. I was in heaven. The only thing that could've made it better was a bunch of Naruto cosplayers simultaneously slurping noodles and playing Yu-Gi-Oh. Okay, that may have been a bit much but still, Tamashii has a great atmosphere. It's not really recommend for large groups, so maybe just bring 3-4 of your closest friends and have them enjoy the sights, sounds, and smells with you.As for the food, it's hard for me to describe. What's a word that means something like \"oh damn\", \"oh man!\", and \"my gawdddsooogooddd\" but all three together? Amazing? Stupefying? Sugoi Ne!? All the above.I got the Tonkotsu Ramen, Praicy got the Garlic Fried rice. Both were delicious, both had me grinning like an idiot. The Ramen had a delicious broth, hearty noodles, and some of the best pork I've ever tasted. The broth was rich without being overly salty, which helped other items in the bowl stand out on their own. The pork had the perfect amount of fat-to-meat ratio and was slightly crispy. All the other items in the bowl were great too, especially the marinated bamboo and eggs. Oh and there's a whole egg in here too! Not just a half an egg, a whole egg! Another Ramen place in OKC I visited charged $12 for a bowl of Ramen and gave half an egg. Like, I'm already paying a premium for your noodles, why can't I get the other half of the egg, huh? Huh?!?I always thought that was super shady of you, four-armed Mortal Kombat character...Back to Tamashii. I think I liked the Garlic Fried Rice just a little bit more than the Ramen. Both dishes are delicious, but the Garlic Fried Rice was served on a sizzling skillet and tasted especially good. Mixing and scraping the rice together added this great crispy texture that kind of blew my mind. I'd recommend adding Spicy Pork for $2, since the fried rice doesn't come with meat. Getting the fried rice as is is still a great option, I just like my meats. I can't say enough about the taste of both these dishes, they were ridiculously good.Along with how great everything tasted, I'm really impressed with the pricing. As mentioned earlier, other Ramen places in OKC charge you anywhere from $10-13 for a bowl of Ramen, with fewer items/options. Everything on Tamashii's menu was less than $10, except for one item which was $12. The value-oriented customer in me loves this place.For dessert, we got Mochi ice cream. Mochi ice cream is...interesting. I had never had it before Tamashii, so when our server brought it to us we kinda stared at it for a while because we didn't know what to do with it. Apparently, you can eat it with your hands and don't have to use the spoon that it comes with. It has a slightly chewy outer layer and houses some tasty ice cream inside. Though they may be tiny, for $2 each they're a great way to end your meal with something sweet. I would recommend the Green Tea Mochi. Tamashii's customer service is also notable, especially a server by the name of Valerio. So dang nice, he checked on us frequently and answered any questions we had. Plus, he gave us really good recommendations. Just a super relaxed and friendly dude that made our visit all the better.If you haven't figured from my review, I think everybody should try this place out at least once, especially if you've never had Ramen before. If you've had Pho and weren't a big fan, don't let that stop you from trying Tamashii. While Ramen and Pho are both broth-based dishes, they're very different in taste and texture.If you've had Pho and Ramen and you still prefer Pho...well I don't know what to say. I guess, I'm sorry you lost your taste buds at such an early age, or something? I kid, I kid. Pho is phine but it doesn't hold a candle to this delicious Ramen, come at me.I'd like to conclude this essay with a Haiku I wrote:The first line is fiveThe second line is sevenGet that fried rice, yo"}, {"review_id": "kb8UF1xCvU3dWechN6PX0g", "user_id": "872LycxbH3s1lhQm5LlTsg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/19/2018", "text": "Hands down my favorite ramen in Oklahoma City.

Jiro might dream of sushi, but I dream of ramen. This was actually my first time eating ramen, let alone eating at Tamashii. I just knew if I was gonna try it, I had to go to the source. At least the closest source I could find in okc. (I read on the website one of the owners is from Japan. I also think she was working in the restaurant running food, which I thought was really awesome!)On a Friday night at 7:15ish, we ended up waiting about an hour. It appears this is typical of Friday and Saturdays nights, so be prepared! The restaurant is tiny, fitting of the name ramen house. It's hustling and bustling and the heat and smells of the open kitchen transport you to another world. They have a covered patio with heat lamps in the winter and those heat lamps do their job! It wasn't cold standing on the patio at all. We poured over the menu so we were prepared to order when we sat down. For apps, our table got seasoned edamame, gyoza and garlic fried rice. Oh my word. Best gyoza I've ever had, super crispy and seared on one side with so much flavor. The edamame has a delicious charred flavor, such a great little snack and the seasoning was great. The garlic fried rice is almost what dreams are made of. It comes out in a sizzling cast iron skillet and it's mixed at your table and it tastes like.. fluffy but crispy and bright and just insanely delicious. We would all order than even as a stand-alone meal. For ramens, amongst the table we had the curry, miso butter corn, garlic and tonkatsu shio. Omg. First of all, the bowls are giant. I couldn't finish mine but yay for me, I get to enjoy it twice. The miso is rich yet mild, the pork belly melts in your mouth. The corn is sweet. It's just like.. being wrapped in a big warm blanket in front of a fire (especially if you add white pepper and sriracha like I did!). My husbands curry ramen was amazing as well. Such a bright, warm curry flavor. I would for sure order both of those. The garlic was good, but like terrified of vampires strong, which  it's supposed to be. I love me some major garlic, but I don't know if I couldn't eaten the whole bowl. The service is outstanding considering how busy they are. We were thanked multiple times for our patience with the wait, and for choosing Tamashii.

All I'm used to are the cheap Nissin Cup Noodles that are 20 cents or so.Anyway, Tamashii is a bit smaller than a lot of restaurants that I've been to. Seating isn't ample, so you might have to wait for a little bit before you get seated. The first time I went, there was a fifteen minute wait to get seated. I don't know how long the wait is at dinner, but during lunch, you can expect a 15-20 minute wait. I would recommend the Tonkotsu Ramen if it's your first time coming in. It comes with chashu (braised pork belly), negi (green onion), menma (marinated bamboo), and nitamago (seasoned soft-boiled egg). These four toppings, I would say, are the best of the bunch. I especially like the nitamago. Something about soft-boiled eggs brings me back to my childhood. If you're wanting something a bit more hearty, try the Tsukemen (Dipping Noodles). It has most of the same toppings (no negi, but add nori [roasted seaweed squares]), and the noodles and broth are a bit thicker. The broth is also served separately so that you have to dip the noodles into the broth. It's much more dense, so if you're not very hungry, maybe avoid the Tsukemen. Both of these bowls are packed with flavor! Once you're done with the noodles, you'll probably want to drink all of the broth that's leftover. I also tried dango for the first time here. It's...different. I knew that since it was similar to mochi it would be chewy, but that didn't prepare me for the amount of chewy, gooeyness that it was. It's definitely an acquired taste. One of the guys that I went with actually spat it out. I've never seen him spit anything out. He said that even though it tasted good, he couldn't handle the texture. The food isn't cheap, but for the amount that you're paying, you're getting your money's worth. I would recommend ramen to just about anyone, so if you're in the mood for something new and delicious, give Tamashii Ramen a shot!"}, {"review_id": "DSJXAx7ncpSxg4xlTpmroQ", "user_id": "mNwXHqVReM8II9C1MR4t7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "The spicy ramen was delicious!
