The fish is delicious.... like seriously delicious. The chips are good too and you get so many in a full order. $10 will get you a huge fish filet and more chips than you can eat. Also, the tartar sauce is my favorite tartar sauce in the history of ever. Even if you don't normally like it, you should still try it. The new place has lots of parking and lots of seating inside but still has the same fun, funky vibe that the first place did. One of my favorite places in North Charleston!"}, {"review_id": "sarApQvReCFEQ8He6jbHgA", "user_id": "V59YvxDToz6JOkr6cACzDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Words alone cannot describe the quality of service and the friendliness of the staff and management of The CodFather.

We finally were able to make it for a meal during operating hours! Next time, we will split one fish and chips basket!! We ordered one for each and it was way too much food - lesson learned!I had the fish and chips basket - I don't normally go for fried food, so I was a little skeptical. It was delicious! We also ordered mushy peas and gravy - those were awesome too! We tried to order more to take home, but it was closing and they didn't have any more. I will definitely be getting more next time. Definitely worth a stop if you're in the neighborhood! I also appreciated that the owner went around to every table and asked how everything was and said thank you to each customer."}, {"review_id": "RhpE2V2aTvHO4yMM_2u4ow", "user_id": "KYAR9aJPK7WtE-tFrHHltg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "2/10/18They just keep getting better and better! The new location is larger and still offers picnic style seating outside. Inside there are a few booths and tables. You line up to order and your food is brought to your table. Bright cheerful walk murals greet you as you walk to the building. Inside is colorful too. Where else is a British hubby going to eat lunch on his birthday! Don't judge, we didn't eat all of it, just had to try them! Fish and chips: big fat forearm sized cod perfectly battered and fried to a golden crisp. Perfecto. Served with hand cut fries and the portion is enough for two! Meat pies: they outsource the production of the pies and they picked an excellent pie maker! You can eat in or take them home and bake them in your own oven! Delicate and hardy crust filled with various savory meats of your choice! Manchester fries: (we were over board but it was his birthday). ITS A MUST TRY! Hand cut fries smothered in brown gravy and gooey cheese!  I COULD NOT STOP EATING THEM! So good! Dreams are made of these!Mushy peas: not your ordinary side and may be a love them or hate them affair. Try them at least once. I love them. Almost mashed potato in texture with a buttery pea flavor. Goes so well with the fish. Condiments: dill tartar sauce, curry sauce, and brown gravy. Malt vinegar available on the table. We get all three sauces because A) they are all fantastic B) it's fun to have a variety for your fish and fries C)we can never choose just one! The owner makes his rounds making sure his guests are enjoying their meal. Very friendly! I'm betting he has never had a complaint. The food is delicious, consistent and very fairly priced. No wonder Codfather's is winning awards and getting so much publicity. Fish and chippy has taken Charleston by storm!***correction! Adam, the owner just let me know that their meat pies are all made in house and they were previously only having them packaged elsewhere! Thanks for the correction Adam! Darn great pies! Well done!"}, {"review_id": "4DU1SypiOf_fkgOXQ__AeQ", "user_id": "m_pZbxv5djHm6YezY_hVyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I finally had a chance to check out the new location. The only thing that's different is the address! As usual the fish and chips are still fantastic. I may not be a Britt, but being a New Englander my entire life, I have very discriminating taste for fried cod and this is, by far the best. The batter is crispy and fried to a perfect golden brown and the serving is always generous. I prefer tarter sauce for garnish, and they always provide whatever it takes to get to the last bite. This generous portion of fish perfection sits atop a full boat of delicious fries. The new location is much more spacious than the original. We arrived on a crowded rainy evening but still managed to get a seat in less than ten minutes and our food came out promptly as we sat. The Codfather is always at the top of my list when I'm looking for a sure thing and a little taste of home. It's perfect every single time."}, {"review_id": "sldlA8HJXWkaOl42oHo_RA", "user_id": "jX3JXpZaZaq46UDa4TWFDA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "This place was all it was cracked up to be!!

We ordered two $10 plates of fish & chips between three people and we had extra chips left over. If we did again, we could do one $10 plate and an extra $7 piece of fish and be full.The bad: the fries. I'm probably splitting hairs here, but I just wasn't into them. Added some vineger to kick them up a notch but they weren't crispy or flavorful or anything. Just didn't hit home for me, and lost them a star. Also, they didn't have a glass of water, only bottles to purchase. And there was only a single bathroom. All little things, but I just can't give them a 5* rating.4* is still really good, and if you like fish and chips don't listen to my bullshit review and go eat there!"}, {"review_id": "sZ2lUyKNCwyo2CuOCX7Htg", "user_id": "pUDI4jE0_FUHliMip4v7Xg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Update: new location on Spruill is FAB.

The portions are HUGE so you could get away with a half portion. Prices are extremely reasonable ($10 for a their regular size fish & chips.)We heard wonderful things about their pies as well.

I've never had anything close to that in the States. So when I saw a couple reviews saying this is the real deal, we had to try it. The fish is indeed perfectly cooked- thick, moist, and flaky. The batter is light and crispy- tends to fall off the fish. It is by far the best fish and chips I've had in the states... but still not up to UK standards, IMHO. The fish had very little flavor to it. I think if they would salt the fish better before deep frying it, it would be closer to the real deal.The chips are pretty typical- thick and mushy. They came out extremely hot- I burnt my tongue on one. And they give you massive amounts. Tip- you can order one full order and one or two fish only dishes, and still have enough chips for two or three.To sum up- definitely worth a visit. Are they as good as England's? Close, but no cigar."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-codfather-proper-fish-and-chips-north-charleston?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
