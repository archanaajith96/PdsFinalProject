It was our first time here and it did not disappoint! From the bottomless mimosas, pastry options and variety of breakfast and lunch food, we ended up trying a handful on the menu. Everything was delicious! We had cappuccino's, cronut holes, croissant sammy, a Cinnabon/muffin, omelette and an amazing concoction called a cruffin that had strawberry and a scrumptious custard filling. The decor is clean, lots of light and an ideal setting for friends/family/dates. Our server Katie was friendly, personable and more than helpful when it came to our indecisiveness on what all to try.

For people that are new to the area I would still recommend trying this place, but should only come during non-peak times."}, {"review_id": "A-v1aPcmVVikAdEIEsLVKw", "user_id": "nDynpOP644nCR9CPYz6ecQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "What a lovely little lunchy brunchy spot. I had my mom in town and we wanted to grab a sweet little cafe lunch during a day full of errands. I whipped out my yelp app and based on reviews decided to choose CRAFTKitchen! I am so happy we did! We were warmly greeted, and seated promptly. The feeling of this joint is so warm and fun. Our waitress was fabulous from the moment she seated us. My mom got the French dip sandwich which came recommended to her by our server, while I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap off of the VEGAN MENU (that's right, they have a vegan menu!!!!.)  As a vegetarian/ naughty (because I don't always follow the vegan rules) vegan- I always get so excited when restaurants have options for us vegg heads! Ok ok- back to the food. The french dip looked divine. My mom raved over and over how delicious it was. It came with a side salad that she said was equally as delicious. She mentioned that the sandwich was so fantastic by itself that she didn't even need to dip it in the gravy. I think the true game changer is that the bread used for the sandwiches is made in house. We did order truffle fries for the table. They were okay- but I will probably sacrifice the fresh breath for garlic parm fries next time. I got the buffalo \"chicken\" wrap off of the vegan menu. I was blown away at how great the texture was of the \"chicken.\" The wrap was delicious. It came with a buffalo sauce in the wrap that was FIREY hot! Thankfully i enjoy spice- but if you are slightly sensitive to spicy foods I would ask for it on the side. There were a few times I had to take a couple of deep breaths and a sip of water! Anyways- it was super yummy, and I can't wait to go back so I can eat it again! We finished our lovely little lunch with a blueberry lemon scone and 2 vanilla lattes! The coffee was delicious and the scone was absolutely heavenly.  I would recommend this spot to anyone for family brunch, dates, or just a bite to eat with your girlfriends or buddies. Overall really pleased with my experience"}, {"review_id": "anco2ujctE2skUTepCZ2aQ", "user_id": "wGD3H-uSkyhJtJnWaIvJBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Hidden breakfast/brunch gem in Henderson.

In other words, it's outside of that 10-mile radius for Las Vegas residents that makes it seems as though it's located on another planet. What's up with that, anyway? With that said, I finally made it over for brunch on a beautiful almost-spring Saturday morning with some girlfriends. The stars must have aligned for this journey because the 215, Eastern, and the CRAFTkitchen parking lot were relatively easy to maneuver. Furthermore, the wait for a table was only a few minutes. Thanks, universe! The restaurant itself is wonderfully well-lit and open. The seating is comfortable; though in our booth, we were close enough to the surrounding tables to get a good look at their food (not a bad thing) and to eavesdrop on their conversation (if we were inclined to do so). The menu covers all the brunch classics with unique touches that don't make you feel like a total lame for ordering yet another benedict. Looking back at the meal, I appreciate how well everything was prepared. I left my meal both satisfied and with a list of all the things I need/must/will try on my next visit. This is one of those places where it's great to go in a small group with friends who are willing to eat family style or share plates. Thankfully, my group was completely down for this plan so we were able to order quite a few items, including:- Smashed Avocado Toast. I tell myself over and over that I can make this myself but, damn, this one's good. - Crustless Quiche of the Day. We had bacon and cheese. It was delicious, but perhaps a tad bit on the small side. - Pork Carnitas Benedict. I had my doubts and they were quickly erased. This was beautifully done. - Chilaquiles (made vegan with soyrizo). I'm really picky about the chips used in a chilaquiles. These were perfect.- Mimosa. Having driven the 15 miles from home because I didn't have the energy to chat up a Lyft driver, I opted for one $8 blood orange mimosa. There is a bottomless option for $16 if you can muster up the chattiness to let someone else drive. Here's my thing with mimosas: I don't really do juice. I'd rather just have a glass of bubbles. THESE mimosas though... consider the juice to bubbles ratio nailed, everyone. - Coffee. I've been drinking a lot of free office coffee. Because free. It sucks. It's almost undrinkable on most days. The coffee at CRAFT was a real treat. So smooth.  We also got a few baked goods. Frankly, CRAFTkitchen is worth a visit just for carby sweet and savory goodies. - Ham and Cheese Kouign Amann. GET IT WARMED UP AND THANK YOURSELF FOR BEING YOUR BEST FRIEND IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD- Vegan Cinnamon Roll. Also great. Warm. It. Up. - Vegan Blueberry Lemon Scone. You know it's good when you question its lack of dairy. - Monkey Bread. Ours was a little bit overdone, but not enough for it to be problematic. It was still gooey in the best way possible. I'm hopeful to make a return trip for more brunch madness soon and am eager to try dinner... if and when I can get my mind wrapped around driving this \"far\" again."}, {"review_id": "Dr6PM6N2BW2cM7xz8YL2hA", "user_id": "Ac2oeT_2_xFn117_UszdcQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Healthy food made with flavor.

I tried the fried avocado tacos (Vegan) and it came with 3 and was a perfect little lunch!

One of my favorite things about this spot is the succulents on the patio but during my most recent visit, they were nowhere to be seen. My other favorite things about this place are the food and the cronut. Yes, I know that cronuts are food but they are so delicious here that they belong in their own category. For those folks who are unfamiliar with a cronut, it's a croissant donut. Also, where have you been!?! I mean, WHAT?! Flaky buttery layers of pastry heaven that you must devour before your friends ask for a bite. There is a host to greet you and seat you but make your way to the pastry case before you sit down. You have to survey the goods!Service here has always been A-OK for me. They once forgot to bring me my Nutella cronut but still *almost* charged me for it. They were super apologetic when I brought it to their attention, took it off the bill, and still packaged one up for me to go. That's what I call exceptional guest service. I've enjoyed the Avocado Toast but could do without the sunflower seeds. I've loved the Acai Bowl with a side of bacon. I was disappointed with the Ham Benedict. My ham was cold and cut too thick for my liking plus the sauce is served on the side without my asking. I'm all for the sauce life and wasn't into pouring it myself. My most recent visit I enjoyed the Crustless Quiche of the Day. It's served in a small baking dish with a side salad. Fluffy and light, filling but not heavy. Super into it.

A perfect balance of crispy, gooey, caramely, doughy indulgence you expect monkey bread to be! (Priced appropriately-don't skip it!) For our entrees, we had an \"all American\" and the chilequiles with carnitas added (served vegetarian on the menu and any meat available can be added). I personally can't comment on the flavors/textures of the \"All American\" style breakfast, because I was so consumed with my wonderful chilequiles! The egg was cooked exactly as requested (a big deal for me) and the sauce was well spiced but not overwhelming.

Transitioning next to two Omelets, others at the table not quite as Carb-centric in their dining plans, it was alongside CRAFTkitchen's daily Carnitas version that a weekly special stuffed with housemade Chorizo and roasted Poblanos was delivered, the heat lent a hint of smoke by way of Chipotle Cream Sauce studded with more spicy Sausage while the pulled Pork made another appearance  later atop crispy Corn Chips as part of Chilaquiles one would be hard pressed to say weren't as good as those found at some of Mexico City's most famous spots.Making one special request mid-week, Chef Blinn happily agreeing to help a guest celebrate in style, it was with a fluffy stack of five Birthday Cake Pancakes available to all as part of the ever-changing Brunch that the meal came to a conclusion...though in actuality the indulgence ended several hours later with three Cookies and one Muffin from the pastry case, two old  favorites as good as ever while the Banana Muffin with Nutella was better this time, though not quite as impressive as the Gluten Free Vegan Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie that tastes indistinguishable from those made with Eggs, Flour and Butter.*****  Still not slowing down after two years, both the daily menu and weekend brunch in a continuous state of change aside from a few signatures, CRAFTkitchen remains a standard-bearer for how to do Breakfast right and the whole Valley should hope it remains a trend-setter for many years to come."}, {"review_id": "XQjlHpsl6HTXI6Vgf31JkA", "user_id": "5wUD9cS4Zd5sons9aI0IYg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "I've been meaning to visit Craftkitchen for quite awhile and had an excellent experience.
