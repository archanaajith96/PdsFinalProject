I've had many good brunches in my life, but of all the restaurants i've been to for brunch, Miss shirley's really takes the cake. We ordered/shared four different dishes under the House Favorites on the menu, and loved every single bite of every one of them. The portions are huge, so i strongly recommend doing what we did and going with a group of friends and sharing everything. We had the benne seed chicken 'n waffles (best chicken and waffles i've ever had), soft shell crab & succotash eggs benedict (amazing), crab cake & fried green tomato eggs benedict (tried fried green tomatos for the first time and loved it), and coconut cream stuffed french toast (heavenly). We shared 4 dishes among the 4 of us, and we were stuffed when we finished all of the dishes (and all of our plates were impeccably clean).I live in DC but i'm willing to do a weekend day trip to baltimore just to go to Miss shirley's again. Most absolutely recommended and will definitely return!!"}, {"review_id": "dsYt1UXmVK53mk9NZm7D2Q", "user_id": "p04yJ2U0-9JYCUHwrGpUgQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Miss Shirley's never disappoints. I have been to both the Downtown and Roland Park locations. Most recently, I went to the Roland Park location for breakfast on Easter Sunday. We arrived around 8 AM on Sunday. At that early in the morning, it was pretty quiet and we were seated right away. To begin, we split the grapefruit brûlée appetizer. A refreshingly tart grapefruit half awaits beneath a caramelized sugar surface. It was a great balance of the tart from the grapefruit and the sweet from the brûlée. For our entrees, I had the blackberry pancakes with a side of bacon, and my boyfriend had the crab cake & fried green tomato eggs Benedict. My blackberry pancakes were fluffy and had blackberries beautifully cooked into them (as well fresh ones on top). The bacon was flavorful and thankfully not over done (I personally don't like burned bacon). My boyfriend quickly ate all his eggs benedict, so I think he was a fan!By the time we were leaving (around 9:15), the place had picked up considerably. The early bird definitely gets the worm! Note: Miss Shirley's does not take reservations. Overall, a wonderful place for quality brunch-style food. I will continue to frequent both locations."}, {"review_id": "oMksJCj9AvBgrH-7KNV2Bg", "user_id": "VtkhGLmGX1u2RmY3duk1sg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Queue the weight gain!  OMG, I had to be rolled out of here like the little girl who turned into a blueberry in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Five of us went on a Sunday after church. Well so did everyone else in Baltimore. The wait wasn't actually too bad but it was like 30 minutes or so.  Let me tell you!  Well worth it.  We ordered all types of appetizers and meals and beverages etc.  Our waiter was super nice and knew the menu well.Our orders came out correctly even with a million people being there.And everything was super terrifically delicious.  This place is dangerous.  Use it sparingly.

WOW!! It was so delicious and the portion size was huge! I was able to save half of it to enjoy later, and it was still delicious. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles with a cup of black coffee.They don't have a variety of coffee and tea drinks here, just straight black coffee with creamer and sugar and regular tea. The brunch menu is extensive though. There is ample seating inside the restaurant and it was pretty poppin' when we came in!

We started off with the monkey bread as an appetizer, which tasted like a dessert even if you didn't use the chocolate drizzle. I got the Benne Seed Chicken 'N Waffles for my entree and was pleased with their approach to go the more savory/spicy route with the dish instead of sweet.You've been warned, don't come here if you're on a diet!  You won't be able to resist the temptation."}, {"review_id": "6in60mTX1d3E-ZrHqERRww", "user_id": "VC3HG0L6EPtWCxc7N-ZApg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Really outstanding brunch.

I visited the Roland park location for the first time and was very impressed with the service. I normally visit the Inner Harbor location (just last week I had the Oyster Feller which was ahhhmazing!), but this time I had some time to kill and needed a chicken and waffle fix. I went in the middle of the week so parking wasn't an issue and man was it cold outside! All the more reason for a warm cup of hot chocolate. I'm addicted to their homemade fresh whip cream. Just give me a bowl of it and I'll be happy, lol. I ordered the chicken and waffles, but subbed out the savory waffles for cinnamon danish and my taste buds were dancing! Although, this was my first time at Roland I must say the food tastes better here than at Inner Harbor. The chicken was crispy and juicy and oh so flavorful; not a bite was left on my plate!"}, {"review_id": "397EhUlAcxNg034w8p4GXg", "user_id": "vOuSDac2QnwoVtxft7boyg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "First time here and I have heard and seen many pics from this place. So....this place is really overpriced.  The food is good however but not really the correct value for money.  I had the blueberry banana pancakes which were very very good. They had fruit in the pancakes and on top and the fruit on top was nice and fresh.  My friend did get an omelette with hash browns that was huge so maybe that's more worth the money cause it could really feed two people.  The hash browns were very very good: moist, not over or under cooked but just right and that's rare.The ambiance is just ok.  I did appreciate that when we walked in at 10 am on a Saturday there was no wait for a table for two since I was dreading a wait.  The server was very attentive and patient.Overall it was a good experience"}, {"review_id": "RNQbUeH3G05w2P5EEyyCXw", "user_id": "PHXf2qK0qZng2IM4Mb8QKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/10/2017", "text": "We were just passing through the area and stopped by after hearing rave reviews.  I sure wish we lived closer as we would be regulars here!  I would love to try quite a few other menu items as well.We got here 11:30 AM on a Sunday and the place was bustling!  Very friendly hostesses greeted us when we walked in and put our name down saying they were moving quickly and it shouldn't be too long.  They even offered our 7 yr old an Etch-a-Sketch to play with while we waited!  We asked for first available seating and so we ended up being seated outside.  It was a gorgeous day and we really enjoyed dining outside.  This is not the cheapest place but the food was delicious and well worth the money.  It sucks when you pay a lot and the food is not even good but that is not the case here!  Any children's meal is $8.88 and my son really loved his meal. He got three little silver dollar pancakes, a generous helping of fruit with a great variety and broccoli.   The other side choice was applesauce which he does not care for.  My husband and I split the Crab Cake Po Boy and and order of pancakes...it comes with 4.  We also got a side of bacon and scrapple...yes we are those weirdos who actually like scrapple!  Everything was excellent!!  Pancakes were tall and fluffy but also sort of crispy on the edges and were really delicious.  The crabcake po boy was definitely a treat.  It comes at market price and was 27.99.  We probably would not pay that again for it but it was worth the money one time.  Scrapple and bacon were great too.  This is definitely a popular place and after one visit it is easy to see why!  We will definitely have to make the drive to come up here again one day."}, {"review_id": "2-iFLQlC152wISLyj443bw", "user_id": "bTHgb9-TkEhZttG60oL8Ag", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "Let's call this Miss Shirley's mediocre Cafe. Let's begin with the decor. It resembles a trendy dressed up diner. Nothing spectacular. I didn't expect anything more or less. Their service is quick, professional, and friendly. We had a waiter named Aaron. He's great. The drinks were strong and flavorful. The food is where I'd say the mediocracy begins. The hash browns were undercooked and bland. IHOP does a better job. The vegetable sandwich tasted like something I'd make during the week for lunch at work. It was underwhelming.

In my waffles? with a odd cheese spread ...and Chicken strips are done with what tastes like fancy sweet chili sauce....definitely a FAIL...
