When I dine alone, I always appreciate restaurants that serve me well. Which was certainly the case at Zelo - my wine, pasta and dessert were all delicious, and my server was top-notch. But what made my visit extra-special was the entire Zelo staff's handling of an medical emergency of another diner seated next to me. The staff's quick, compassionate actions were exemplary. Not only does Zelo serve wonderful butternut squash ravioli and tiramisu, they deliver loving, graceful care to all of their patrons."}, {"review_id": "Xsmt1tPHCiudrsybOVuBjg", "user_id": "j6iAQjg9uunvc8kdWRcGag", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "We went here for my boyfriend's birthday, and the food and service were both quite good!

For my main entree I had the Wild Mushroom flat bread and it hit the spot exactly.  To finish off I had the Goat Cheese Cheesecake with Blueberry Sauce.  I was initially thrown off by the goat cheese aspect but it was well worth it.  One of the best parts was in our conversations Brad knew I was in town and getting out in the morning.  I forgot my card at the restaurant and they found me on Facebook to let me know they had it.

On a Friday night the 4 of us light-railed to downtown as large snowflakes fell down on us. This restaurant has two sides, I'll call it the fancy side (basically make a reservation for a Friday night) and a more casual side where you can maybe get a table walking in. There is bar seating and high cocktail seating on the casual side as well.The food is your standard italian fare w/ an upscale touch. I thought the food was very good, the pasta was cooked to the perfect firmness and the appetizers were all delightful. I was not disappointed in the food one bit. Add some drinks for a fun night out."}, {"review_id": "CSHDy1xU7wL04-TPyG6SFg", "user_id": "eda8wcozDnRtzXCnsJBY3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "As I arrived in this fair Twin City, I learned it was a \"beautiful\" day. This consisted of temps in the 30s. Regardless, I was warmed at Zelo.While it was pretty packed for a Tuesday, I still had a lovely side table allowing me to take it all in.Question of the day: what is the difference between their flat bread and pizza? Admit it you want to know. It's kind of like when my 6-year-old asked what made it a muffin or a cupcake. Well I can't answer that in good conscience.Since I'm here to serve, the answer is the crust (and the toppings). I chose the flatbread mushroom why? Need I say the truffles? Yes always it needs to be said.Shout out to my waiter Shawnah who educated in the ways of Zelo flat bread, specifically these are B-I-G. Big and good! I was more than 40% full, which after having a \"starter\" is a score! Large mushroom pieces and a hint of truffle, crispy crust and just the right amount of brie.So part two of the shout-out was the recommendation on the ravioli. There were two sizes, and initially I leaned toward the \"big\" because I roll like that. Upon further discussion I went with the smaller accompanied with the promise that she wouldn't let me go hungry. I believed her and my faith paid off.Later in the episode, I discovered these are already some big ravioli, and four is plenty, compared to the large size, six. The flavor and consistency was correct across the board. And I reached the exact amount of full without getting crazy. Sadly I couldn't partake in dessert but that was a wistful choice for sure.I enjoyed the experience and the service, and this is a cozy spot in downtown Minneapolis worth a return."}, {"review_id": "FZmc27Y2IA6KtrzR2pIwFg", "user_id": "XLkKghZXU0tgwf6y7KOyjQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "I was recently at Zelo for lunch and thoroughly enjoyed the Wood Grilled Filet Mignon while my co-worker ordered a Butternut Squash Ravioli plate.

My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday night for a special valentine's date (2/10/18). We did have reservations, and they were running about 10 minutes behind but they informed us right away and we got a sweet table in the bar area, where we ordered drinks and an app (calamari - which was very fresh and delicious). Our server then informed us our table was ready so we headed to the dining room. Our table was round and against the wall which allowed us to sit next to each other, and it was perfect. I am glad we were seated there rather than in the other section of the dining area where the more open tables were.Our server was fabulous - very friendly and knowledgable about the food. He did try to upsell the encrusted sea bass which I know they are famous for, so I don't blame him. We were brought freshly baked bread and butter along with our drinks. I had the butternut squash ravioli - full order (just go for it). And my boyfriend had the linguini de mare. Both were amazing, and generous portions. His linguini had so much seafood in it it was almost more seafood than pasta - which is NOT a bad thing. He can put some food down and he couldn't even finish it all. And the seafood was cooked absolutely perfectly. These chefs know what they're doing. :)For dessert we had tiramisu - also amazing. I love the fact that Zelo makes everything, including their pastas and desserts, fresh in house daily. The ambiance was fabulous - low key and romantic. The service was impeccable and the place seems to run like a well oiled machine. I cannot wait to go back and try out some other dishes."}, {"review_id": "XTc2WB97MMdube0tlpq-tg", "user_id": "9RwnXk7_r1WQl62MyGko5g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Interesting menu.  Good drinks.  Maybe a little pricey for what you get and the area but still worth giving it a chance"}, {"review_id": "tVtjtilBobaLv5j5lvc4AA", "user_id": "XUhmgUzVTesVF6gkclEx3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "Hello Zelo, you're amazing, and here's why.First off, props to our server, Manu. We were there for an anniversary dinner, and he made us feel incredibly welcome, comfortable, and helped us newcomers choose out some amazing dishes. The night would have been amazing regardless, but with Manu, it was impeccable.Now onto the food! We started off with some brown butter scallops, and they were delicious melt-in-your-mouth goodness that started off the meal right. We ordered the spicy crab spaghetti and the linguini de mare and both were delicious. The spaghetti had a great light freshness to it, thanks to the mint, but was well balanced with the chiles and lemon. The linguini de mare was the more subtle dish, and I have to give props to the choice of keeping the mussels in their shells while cooking. I felt it gave the dish more nuance, and the extra work to dig out the meat was worth the extra flavor.The only qualm I have is that we booked a table on OpenTable and we arrived on time, but still had to wait about 10 or so minutes to be seated. It was busy, but it definitely made me question why even book a reservation in the first place. Shoutout to the complementary valet service as well, made getting to Velo easy and stress-free. Definitely a great place to go for a date night!"}, {"review_id": "9PdViTgKmhbn7_zWwm9-gQ", "user_id": "Z8S87EDY2BxRFZb-DR26dg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "Jeez, I don't even really know what to say about this place. It came highly recommended by several friends, so I really did have high hopes. Maybe that was part of the problem since for the most part, I felt like it a miss across all fronts. I'll try to keep in mind that I caught them during the Super Bowl mayhem, but I don't think that totally excuses a lot of the shortcomings.Food: I thought it was just ok. My husband got the Caesar Salad and the dressing was great, but the portions were TINY and it was just a small amount of romaine lettuce with a few croutons. Definitely not worth $16. The pizza was pretty good, but I've had better. Hubby's burger was good, as was mine, but nothing to write home about. It's just not that great of a value for average food. Atmosphere: Pretty cool, which is what keeps this review at 2 stars. I liked the look and feel of the restaurant, but we were seated halfway across the restaurant and they still had a COLD draft running through the place. We also were by the server's station and I could hear them talking about tables (not always in a professional manner), which is seriously offputting. Service: I don't even know how much detail I want to go into! We walked in with a reservation for 5:15. The hostess wasn't able to locate it (which was odd, but the restaurant wasn't busy so shouldn't be a huge deal) and she got incredibly condescending. Note to Zelo - if your hostess is asking customers, \"Are you sure you're in the right place? You're at Zelo, did you mean to come to Zelo?\" or \"If you claim you have reservations, we'll just get you seated\" there is a problem. I was hoping to find a great new regular spot for the area, and it appears I'll have to keep looking!"}, {"review_id": "24QpedUHngECMSa6FnSD0w", "user_id": "iBhjhnk2klRkru6qGPnu0w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/23/2017", "text": "Zelo is your modern day Dorsia (to my Patrick Bateman fans) minus the craziness of getting a reservation. It is a elegant Italian restaurant centered in the middle of Downtown Minneapolis. It is the perfect spot for an anniversary, date, or catch up session with your colleagues and friends.I've been here two times and am impressed by the great customer service, diverse selection of entrees, appetizers, and wines, and ambiance of the restaurant itself. Here's a food review of a recent experience when I made the stop on a busy Friday lunchtime.Ordered -  Linguini Di Mare (4.5/5). This is a assorted seafood pasta of shrimp, scallops, and mussels. I ordered the small but that was more than enough in terms of portion size. It is very delicious and the seafood blended well with the house sauce. The noodles were good, but I have had better - Permesan Crusted Shrimp (5/5). This was delicious! Calamari-like but with a shrimpy flavor. I love the sauces provided too. Recommend dipping it in both the lemon garlic and cocktail at the same time- Sauvignon Blanc - Kim Crawford, New Zealand (5/5). Tasty white wine that is sweet and refreshingZelo is great and definitely a classy but relaxed spot in downtown. I look forward to returning to try other dishes."}, {"review_id": "NpR8erD2HnjszLyp5fzS6A", "user_id": "iH7HyTWyp46IGw2PDV2B-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Interior: Beautiful.
