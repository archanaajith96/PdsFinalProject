The ambiance was very pleasant and set a great mood for the night. We went on a Monday night and the restaurant wasn't very crowded, so it was pretty easy to find a table. The wait staff were kind and very helpful when trying to decide what to order. We selected the Brie & toast to start, followed by cucumber margaritas. Both were delicious! The cucumber margarita was pretty small, but had great flavor. The Brie is very easy to share with a group of 4-5. For our entrees, we ordered the sweet potato gnocchi, crab cake & risotto, and shrimp & salmon quinoa paella. All were yummy! The gnocchi is really just an appetizer size, so if you're looking for a vegetarian entree, add a salad on the side. The crab cake was the best and very rich. The paella was different and pretty flavorful. To finish the meal, cookies were served with the check. It was definitely a nice gesture :) All in all, great experience!"}, {"review_id": "J47iJUX6IndcT0bSfKCBnw", "user_id": "SiBq_6NbgRim-3bDVXtAbg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "My mom and I came to check out this place on an early Saturday afternoon. Let me say, the outside is totally unassuming but you walk in and feel like you could be downtown or in some city. It's so cute and the decor is amazing. We ordered bloody Mary's which weren't great but whatever. We had French onion soup, duck meatballs and chicken Caesar salad. The food was awesome, really well cooked and decently large portions. They had a happy hour from 3-6 (or close to that) which I really want to check out. Overall definitely try this place!"}, {"review_id": "wmMbxQtzYfh0xqxoojNBhg", "user_id": "PNQH7gsjsQCS52hJ-v_WHw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/17/2017", "text": "We discovered Corner Bistro via Yelp while traveling to Delaware/Pennsylvania for a weekend and were looking for a late Saturday dinner. It was late enough in the evening that the restaurant didn't seem to be busy and Corner Bistro seems to be more of a local spot than a touristy spot. We were immediately greeted by a friendly host and wait staff and were promptly seated in a cozy, chic dining room. I ordered the house salad with is mixed greens severed with goat cheese, dried cranberries, candied pecans, and champagne vinaigrette, sweet potato gnocchi, and my boyfriend opted for the Cuban Sandwhich. I was incredibly pleased with the mix of flavors in the salad and the sweet potato gnocchi was one of the best I've had. The homemade gnocchi was served with fresh whipped ricotta and pesto which both added an unreal flavor to the dish. The fresh whipped riccota was light and one of the best I've ever had. The small plate and salad were plenty of food for one person. My boyfriend who loves Cuban Sandwhiches was very pleased with his selection. Everything at Corner Bistro is locally sourced and it made for a great dining experience. The service was relatively fast and our waiter was  nice and took some time to get to know us.  One of the best parts of our dining experience were the fresh chocolate chip cookies that were served with our check!"}, {"review_id": "2Rax35bHaxlgunDQ2s3nwQ", "user_id": "w4qzUF4xKPr4CmqtKuO4Kw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/24/2017", "text": "TLDR: Overall, Corner Bistro has a great environment, but the expensive food really missed the mark. Factoring in the slow service, we won't be coming back anytime soon. Unfortunately, this is one of the only upscale restaurants in north Wilmington, so better options are few and far between. Our family has been coming here for a while, but since the new chef has come in, our experiences haven't been all that great.For starters, the ambiance is comfortable and relaxing. It is of the classier places in north Wilmington, with a traditional bar and very nice dining area, albeit a bit small and cramped.Right off the bat, we ordered a few drinks (dirty martinis, wines, and iced teas) which took forever to arrive. Even though there were only a few guests at the bar, it took around 15-20 minutes for us to receive our orders, by which we had already finished our appetizers and were about to cancel the drinks. Needless to say, the service was very disappointing and frustratingly slow.For starters, I ordered the wedge salad and french onion soup. While the soup was hearty, the salad did not live up to standards. The leaves were browned at the ends and the dressing clearly came from a Hidden Valley bottle. The bacon bits didn't add much flavor and the bleu cheese was flavorless. Overall, the salad tasted processed, careless, and unsatisfying. The sign says this dish is locally sourced, which is 100% accurate-the ingredients tasted as if sourced from the nearby Food Lion. For the entrees, I ordered the crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus. This was very good, with a rich, bold balsamic glaze and fresh tomato and onion garnish on top. The chicken carried great seasoning and the mashed potatoes were light and salty. The asparagus was charred and added good texture to the dish. I highly recommend this one. While I didn't have these dishes, my friends and family made the following recommendations:Entrees I recommend:The duck - fragrant and boldSalmon - rich risotto, delicate fishShort ribs - the parsnip puree is incredibleEntrees I don't recommend:Caesar salad - browned lettuce leaves and bottled Caesar dressing; the menu said it included parmesan cheese, but it tasted clearly like SwissFish tacos - very dry, tasteless fish in a plain, processed tortilla"}, {"review_id": "TkpSW5mK6wWT5fvSdNTaig", "user_id": "IBTZheBm3yA3hOhxIIlXZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "One of my favorite places.

We are glad we made the choice. It is a little gem of a restaurant tucked in a little retail center a block off the Concord Pike. It had a very cozy atmosphere, quaint bar and lounge separated from the nice dining room. The cuisine was very well prepared, fresh and very delicious. The soups were excellent and the drink menu had a nice variety of cocktails, wines and beers. We were surprised on a Saturday night there was only about 24 patrons. We think there problem may be the location. Regardless , we will definitely try it again when we are in the Brandywine area."}, {"review_id": "Pg1uWSAeL5ukGTM_Qh6FGg", "user_id": "UZVmRsZe08XC1_NiSMYRzg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "Adorable date night or lunch spot cozy and quaint.

I was searching for somewhere to have lunch on Yelp and so many places were returned from my search however as I scrolled through reviews and pictures Corner Bistro stood out.Upon pulling in the lot the place is nestled in the corner of a strip mall type of complex and from the outside I thought \"How Cute it's on the corner of the strip hence corner bistro\". However upon entering the place was super cute with a Beautiful glass chandelier perched above the bar and these exquisite orange bar chairs with backs lined the bar. The staff was so welcoming and friendly to say the least. It's always good to eat at an establishment where people appreciate their job and know how to treat people. My first visit and my third visit today were for lunch and both times I had the Chef Express Lunch with contains 4items each time a soup, salad, dessert & food item CHEF choice. My second visit was for dinner on Wednesday which is Half Price Wine bottle night. The veggie flatbread we had for an appetizer was amazing and our entrees were as well. My nanny had the chicken and I had salmon.
