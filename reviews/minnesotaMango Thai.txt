Seating is a little limited so large parties may be difficult to accommodate however the limited seating did make noise manageable even when the place is full. We came during a lunch rush and our food came out in a reasonable amount of time but the place seemed understaffed with just one waiter and a bus boy. It took us a while to get our check and even longer to pay, we ultimately had to just interrupt whatever the waitress was doing to get some attention.Food: Although the service was a little strained during the lunch rush, the food made up for that. I had the panang curry which was truly excellent. The bowl had generous chucks of tender chicken, lightly crispy bell peppers, and fresh basil leaves all bathed together in a very rich and creamy curry sauce. The dish was not shy on the spiciness and provided a very reasonable challenge, maybe 7/10 but being far from \"thai hot\".Overall my group enjoyed our food very much but recommend either coming off peak hours or being more vigilant on getting your order and bill taken care of if you're on a time constraint."}, {"review_id": "jY0m3VYWDza59MMV3vcZ_Q", "user_id": "BIWnH3yjzrcdgw5ADX9nvw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/21/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Dear mango Thai.

Sat at the bar and asked about their curry. Was recommended the duck curry. I usually take medium spice but the server recommended mild. Glad she did!  Even mild had a nice heat to it. The curry was very tasty. Sweet acid of the Pineapple complimented the rich duck broth nicely.  Veggies were still al dente and had good cruch to the dish. All in all good albeit brief experience."}, {"review_id": "IJDExS2xPOHa-zj82BbgiQ", "user_id": "aX2sjoIB3ptQAzMKmrzpug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "This is a great place.

After a short while, our entrees appeared and at first glance, it all looked quite good. I tasted a friend's green curry mahi mahi which was light and flavorful. The salmon, unfortunately, was far worse. It tasted quite odd, to the point of my thinking that perhaps the fish was bad.Noticing that I hadn't eaten it, our server inquired about the issue and removed it from the bill. He offered to get me something else but by then, my appetite was ruined.The Thai iced tea was good, although super sweet, and the rice was well cooked. The ambiance is decent, similar to the previous sushi place that occupied that spot. Service was as expected but prices were surprisingly high.All in all, it was a disappointing meal."}, {"review_id": "VH_lO8FedbSTxQfxgoVvIw", "user_id": "JhFUp6FN2YrjFzwVarv2OQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "The authenticity of this place is unreal because in the fall they serve you soup in a pumpkin with the top carved out of it.

Started with chicken satay with a superb peanut sauce. My wife had the sea bass with a curry sauce and I had the walleye with red chili sauce. Both dishes were beautifully presented and wonderful. We have been fans of Thai food for 40 years or so and this compared favorably with the best ever. Also was served by Edin who was gracious and perfectly attentive. He just put an exclamation point on a delightful evening.

The food sucks though. I love Thai food and after reading the reviews I decided to give this place a go. First they bring you a hot wet towel to clean your hands. A nice touch except for the fact that my towel stunk like damp or nasty towel ( you know when you leave a fabric or towel damp how it smalls? . Not appetizing at all). My Panang curry : the veggies were alright but chicken smelled like old reheated chicken! Even their white rice was very disappointing. My server was really nice and once I told her about the chicken, asked the kitchen to prepare the curry dish with tofu ( but the tofu didn't taste good either )So I paid over 22 dollars for some vegetables in a curry sauce and a not so good white rice with a jasmin tea ( which was not good either). Not to mention the stomach discomfort after dinner!"}, {"review_id": "ta_2c6f6PsJyvw2yri0yzA", "user_id": "zVns4r0awv0wJ3sfPasfQA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "My girlfriend and myself took her daughter to Mango Thai for her 15th birthday at her request and we had a wonderful meal.

I went there for dinner and ordered crab avocado roll and pad seafood keemow (hot). The roll should be renamed as \"some crab but mostly avocado roll\" - it had mostly avocado (cold) and no taste to it. Sauce which came along was also okisshh , I was expecting it to be much more flavorful like the traditional Thai sauces. Pad keemow seafood, to my horror was even worse. I have never seen so thick noodles in a pad Thai, which were not amusing. I have asked for making the pad Thai hot at other places too, but it still retains a little bit of its sweetness to it (characteristic of pad thai), but these guys just made it super hot- even difficult to eat. Their service is miserable. Overall a bad experience."}, {"review_id": "ASdu1_9qKpv3i5yYR9e1kg", "user_id": "SX3e1wLEvBy6Y0d7mN40BQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/14/2017", "text": "This place was fantastic!
