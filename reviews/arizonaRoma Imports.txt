It's tucked away in an industrial area but once you find it, you'll be glad you did.It's a small place, with a deli counter, a wall of refrigerators and freezers, and a small family-style dining area.We had the Matt's Special sandwich and it was amazing. Super-high quality meats, cheeses, and the bread was absolutely perfect. Their to-go selection of pastas and italian foods and ingredients are amazing. If I lived in Tucson I'm sure I'd shop there pretty frequently.Quite possibly the best sandwich in Tucson."}, {"review_id": "Z6KVWaoGQ5aLdihWBXqFyQ", "user_id": "h8yn-q-yMwcB9o9YpNqmxg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/8/2017", "text": "This place is a little out of the way for us coming from Oro Valley, so we try to combine a lunch with shopping for a few things.Their lunch dishes are wonderful: sandwiches, pasta, etc.  Reasonably priced, and they pop out of the kitchen really quickly.We buy their Italian sausage on a regular basis, and really like the Dracula sausage, but be advised it is really spicy!  The cheese & parsley rope sausage pictured below is really wonderful cooked on the grill.You could pretty much live off the dishes in their freezer case: lasagna, meatballs, fresh ravioli, etc.  I have yet to buy anything there that wasn't top-notch.The neighborhood is a little sketchy - think razor wire.  Not dangerous or anything, just very industrial.  I get why they don't have outdoor seating..."}, {"review_id": "nlWLaQMIcdl3aP_MnN9ZHg", "user_id": "X8XtgHQP0ZbwGryabs0aSg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "If you're looking for authentic Italian, Roma is a must!

The frozen prepared meals look great and the prices look fair. The dining area is smaller and you may share tables with other patrons.

I've been coming to Roma for years. This is a great little market and their catering is the best! They have a wonderful frozen meal section: lasangas, cabbage rolls, Marsala, etc. and also a great selection of cured meats and prepared finger foods. Their sliced cured meats (my favorite being spicy soppressata) and some fig jam on toast is the best thing to bring to a dinner party hands down. They also have great homemade hummus and other spreads. Their cheese selection is comparable to Whole Foods in my opinion but I love to support a local business. I tell everyone to go here and it seems like everyone loves it!!! Do yourself a favor and go check it out."}, {"review_id": "0DLXfkLrDykw9DbDuQxhVA", "user_id": "vTprcHGBn9asRfI349M1Fg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2017", "text": "Years ago when I the NYC area (where I've lived my entire 55 years) and moved to Reno NV, I learned that I was probably never again going to see a real Italian or Jewish Deli.  Then I moved to Tubac AZ and again new I wasn't going to find a lot of the foods I was used to.But, alas not quite sure how I found them..but there was Roma Imports.  They sell wholesale, do catering, have a deli counter/restaurant and once again I could find good salami,  mozzarella and even mortadella.  It's a great place...once you find it.  Turn in by the Kino statue (off of Kino/Campbell) ..make the first left, then right, then left again.  It's hidden in a commercial area. When you enter, if you plan on have lunch...order your lunch and head to the tables in the back...they'll bring your food to you.  On the way shop at their deli counter or check out their freezer options.  They make their own sausage.. lasagna and other delicious foods that you can purchase.Once a year they have what they call the Winter Italian Feast.  They add more table in the store and serve a fantastic tasting menu.  This year we had: Antipasti:  Baccala Cakes,Rolled Prosciutto Cotto and Green Beans, Foccacia with Gorgonzola and Fig Jam, Prosciutto with fresh Mozzarella & Sundried Tomato & Basil Dressing, Sausage & Broccoli Rolls, Fried Goat Cheese Medallions with Balsamic Glaze, Cipolline Onions, Sweet & Sour Vegetable Platter & Roma Antipasti... and this was just to start.  There was nothing in this mix that wasn't YUMMY!!Main Course:  Butternut Squash & Pecan Lasagna (this was sinfully delicious), Lamb with Red Wine, Garlic & Anchovies (pretty sure this isn't a typical Italian dish, but it was awesome), Chicken Marsala, Pork Loin Roll stuffed with Sausage, Fig & Walnuts, Orzo with Romano Cheese, Swiss Chard with Pine Nuts and Raisins & Garlic Rosemary Potatoes.  But wait, there's more.Dessert:  Pistachio Semifreddo, Chocolate Marscapone Roll & Butter Cookies (dipped in absolutely delicious chocolate).To add to this overwhelming amount of food, several members of the staff play the violin and wander through the restaurant entertaining and singing with us.This roughly $50 BYOB event happens a couple of days a year and is always sold out.  So if you can't get into the event...remember... you can buy most of this stuff and take it home.  And, while this is the Italian Deli.. they also carry other Mediterrean country items...I think from Greece and Spain as well."}, {"review_id": "rU5lyC3YtBErNoVjTytACQ", "user_id": "fr7ac23SbYpBNl-Z-nyv3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Is it just me or do you have trouble finding meat ravioli any more? When you go to the foo foo Italian restaurants they may have some version of ravioli but its all modernized with some other concoction. I just want my dang ravioli without the modern modifications! Roma is where you can get it and its delicious, the marinara sauce is authentic and I lick the bowl when I'm finished, there I said it. Of course there are many other delightful treats..You will find what you are looking for. I've eaten here dozens of times, its always great food with lots of carry outs available that are equally is good. Yes its in a weird spot, you wont see it when you are on your way to an Uncle Kracker concert but you are not far from it! Follow your smart phone ap and get over there and make sure to hum Smile. Smile. on your drive cuz you will be smiling when you are making a pig out of yourself while eating here."}, {"review_id": "MiZ5V9-D3LXN5BAWce_Qjg", "user_id": "aU9Onn8eHwUcz-d-Tj0Qtg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "The Italian food here is so good! Most restaurants in Tucson don't have that authentic taste but I feel as though Roma imports does. They have a mini store in the restaurant where you can buy frozen Italian meals which are great if you're having a party and don't feel like cooking. This place is the type of restaurant you order take out from and don't really dine in, however, there is a small area to eat inside. The service here is fast and great. The food tastes great and really tastes fresh. I'd recommend it to anyone and everyone in the area. Going to the restaurant is a little weird however, it's in the middle of a bunch of warehouse type buildings."}, {"review_id": "J4K7f3KTk_gpnddZhnkLzA", "user_id": "jZpSqOHOPXKhNHtX1OMDAA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/15/2017", "text": "Roma Imports is an anomaly.  It's hidden in the middle of nowhere surrounded by shady pseudo-industrial buildings crowned with barbed wire and the junkyard/ambiguous car businesses that pepper the outskirts of Tucson proper.It reminded me of a place in Long Beach, CA called Santa Fe Importers which I frequented and LOVED when I was back home.  It's got the same basic set up: a mini Italian grocery section for specialty products from the old country, a deli counter (antipasti, olives, cheeses, desserts etc.), a mile long refrigerator wall stuffed with a variety of prepared meals, and a slapdash \"dining section\" that consists of a few long awkward picnic tables in a very cramped space.Sadly, customer service is not done with a smile here.  Most of the employees I encountered looked similar to what I would envision a bitter, apathetic robot looking like.  Not warm or comfortable in the least but what does that have to do with the food, right?  Well they're putting that energy into the food and it certainly showed in the sandwich I ordered.The name of the sandwich escapes me but it was lousy.  The bread wasn't the fresh, warm, light and airy Italian white bread I'm accustomed to.  This was heavy, thick and doughy with absolutely zero flavor.  It's like it was made out of Bisquick!  Despite its lead-bread composition it didn't even hold up through the first half (which is all I cared to consume).  There was a bunch of old, cold, tough jerky-like bacon in the thing that was very unappetizing.  It had very little mayo or anything else to balance out the acidic twang of the overabundant red wine vinegar.  Besides the old bacon, it had very little meat for an Italian cold cut sandwich.  It was a total fail any way you look at it.My company ordered the hot meatball sandwich and was quite satisfied.  I bypassed that disgraceful bread and asked to try a piece of the meatball.  I have to admit that their meatballs are delicious, very tender and flavorful.  So, I haven't given up on Roma Imports yet.  I would definitely give their hot meals a try.  Plus the added convenience (once you've located the place) of stopping in for a bag full of prepared meals to stock the freezer has an strong appeal."}, {"review_id": "7GhNo9TOhNzab6_F7kJdrw", "user_id": "lyFzTPszp1dPGsmIqkylNg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "Recommended by a friend and oh boy exactly what I needed!
