My husband has always wanted to try a rotary sushi place and we stumbled upon this one! When we got there it only took a couple of minutes to be seated. Most of the tables are directly on the rotary (unless you ask for a table not on it). There is a color coding system to indicate the prices of each dish as follows:White Plates- $1.50Yellow Plates- $2.50Blue Plates- $3.50Green Plates- $4.50Red Plates- $5.50Purple Plates- $6.50A majority of the plates comes with four to six pieces of sushi on them. They also have a full menu with dinners and bento boxes. Before each type of sushi/food there is a little frame explaining what the following item is. When it rolls by you, all you have to do is open the flap and grab whatever plate you would like.Between the two of us we tried 24 different small plates and we ordered the Chicken Katsu with curry and everything was absolutely delicious! Not only was everything incredibly delicious but it was a ton of fun to have dinner here!When we got our bill we were shocked at how cheap our bill was! We will definitely be coming back to try the ramen and other stuff!"}, {"review_id": "89myxdp64jIvPSuMnDsFYw", "user_id": "vggdz71hSUScs7ai5Ld2CA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Love the idea of 6 plates-6 colors. Food is always fresh and delicious. For those who have not been here before, it works like this:There are 6 different colored plates that come around your table continuously. The color of the plate, determines the price. The cheapest is 1.50 and the most expensive is 6.50. There is a lot of variety within their plates.

We really like all the staff and the food. It is not authentic Japanese sushi across the board, but it is a good substitution. Only negative things I have to say are as follows : 1 I wish the management would have had the foresight to have kept the original layout. They had 4 lines or rotary and more tables on the rotary. That really is where people want to sit. In Japanese \"kaiten-zushi\" there are only tables at the rotary. However I guess they felt that it would never catch on so they cut it in half. Now there are big wait times as everyone wants to sit at the rotary and not the stand alone tables. 2 the sushi, and cakes are gradually getting smaller. As their demand is getting better the sizes are getting smaller. The Sakura for example is half the size it used to be."}, {"review_id": "MerNs_qUpZgKFMveB9XJzA", "user_id": "F9vYcUknd9JY2lxsaEObQQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "Since my husband met me, I've been telling him about the all magical and elusive floating/rotary sushi bar. I think he just humored me, but in the back of his mind he was thinking, \"Wow, she really has some imagination.\" I have now hooked my husband on Sushi + Rotary.I've noticed that people compare rotary sushi bars to all you can eat sushi spots and I'll say, regardless of where I go, I always get my money's worth. Comparatively, I can walk away from S+R with a smaller bill (meaning I ate a reasonable amount of sushi), but I do eat twice as much at an all you can eat sushi place. That being said, S+R is still my first choice when thinking of sushi.The variety is best during their peak hours, but it's still nothing to scoff at when it's closer to closing time. I tend to grab a few salmon nigiri plates right of the bat. Then I bounce around between traditional and specialty maki rolls. And then I make my way back to the salmon nigiri by going through a couple of other nigiris first. And I finish with a slice of cheesecake. I couldn't tell you what my husband does, but we never walk away with a bill more than $40 with our drinks. Not too shabby. Considering all of the plates are between $1.50-$6.50, you really can load up. And the quality is quite good so I always feel good about a meal here.The cool thing about having sushi served up on a conveyor belt is the fact that you will be enticed to try sushi you would probably never order otherwise... heck, one time I tried the pickled mackerel nigiri just because (would not recommend unless you like things pickled that aren't veggies or you're like me and you want to try something just because).For the most part the staff always leaves us to our own devices (but in a good way). They find out if you're ordering anything, bring your drinks, bring you wipes, hand you a tiny packet of wasabi, and only return every few minutes to remove lids and refill drinks unnoticed... honestly I think they wait to do it until you've turned to grab another plate from the conveyor belt.I think the only downside is that you will most definitely wait for a booth if you go around noon or anytime after 5pm. But it's absolutely worth it. And if you're a big nigiri lover like me, this is the place for you (also worth noting: they do NOT apply wasabi to the nigiri so if you like it that way you will have to do that yourself)."}, {"review_id": "4VyAkec5kfRj3SSGxRDtaw", "user_id": "gH9hONnrRlAu3fKqThsI6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/18/2017", "text": "Super tasty Sushi followed by an interesting concept. The moving carousal serving sushi is just amazing. I have heard its a popular concept far east, but this is the first time I encountered it. There are many reasons I like this place. 1. The innovative and experimental take at sushis was amazing. One of my sushi actually had Cheetos on it.  Now this could be a deal breaker for a few authentic sushi lovers. But I was fine. 2. Sushis generally sound like a very costly affair. This is on the contrary is pretty affordable 3. Multiple veg options4. The Carousel. Call me a geek but I just love when restaurants bring in some technology into the equation. The can improve their desserts though. I felt a lot could be done on those lines.

I'm a loyal sushi station fan but this place showed me a great time.The menu and atmosphere is more modern and diverse. The menu had a ton of options, which is kinda crazy to me. If you've never been to a rotary style sushi bar, it's so fun! This one is kind of small in my opinion so I can see why there can be a wait. after a while you just see the same things pass over and over again so I just recommend ordering from the menu at all times. nigiris: The scallop was thick and good. The ikura was not as pleasant. There was something off.  The smoked salmon is peppery and slight spicy but the sauce is good and it's something different worth trying! Rolls: My favorite roll is the negahamchi. Although the they don't chop up the fish and mix it with the scallions, I enjoyed this one a lot. The spicy scallop (or spicy anything) is gooood. It has tempura crumbs and a spicy mayo kick. The Alaskan roll was also really good because the salmon was so soft. Shrimp Robata: Though it doesn't look special when you first see it, you can taste the grilledness when you bite and I kept dipping it into the yummy sauce. Recommend!The servers were constantly taking our orders and asking about our experience. They even have us a sample of orange chicken on the house. It was a new menu item and I actually like its a lot. It's slightly crispy and you can taste the soft chicken inside. Nothing wrong with the sauce. The service was really good. The food came out to be around $20/person and I was left full."}, {"review_id": "FjWAmCvEMoIu3JnLgAYj_g", "user_id": "zKY6NM9CxxWxcY5JJXUB7g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2017", "text": "Although I know this place is a super fun dine-in sushi experience, my two experiences with Sushi Rotary Sushi Bar has actually only been with takeout and delivery! Color me lazy, but no regrets!Sometimes I crave ramen. Okay, often I do. There really aren't any great ramen spots in the Aurora area, so I was pleased to discover that SRSB has ramen on their menu! I have to say, even with ordering it as take out/delivery it was delicious. The presentation wasn't as Instagram worthy as I'm sure it is dining in, but the flavor was all there. Now it's honestly not the best ramen bowl I've ever eaten, but given the proximity to my house, the price, and the convenience of having it delivered -- I'm a fan.This egg noodle soup was topped with shiitake mushrooms, bamboo shoots, sweet corn, a poached egg, minced garlic, fried red onion, scallions, and finished with a seaweed garnish. You can choose from two different broths. I've had the tonkotsu both times which is a creamy pork bone broth. There are a few different ramen bowls to choose from, but I got the tonkotsu bowl (to match my broth) which is topped with grilled pork belly ($10.50). Yum!Of course Sushi Rotary obviously has a LARGE sushi menu. Last week hubbie and I placed a fatty order for delivery and loved absolutely everything we had. I highly suggest the \"Adventure Rolls\" on their menu if you're an experienced sushi eater. These babies are far from basic! I recently realized their menu also includes Poke bowls which is one of my new favorite obsessions, so I can't wait to give this a whirl. Delivery was fast and officiant so that's a great option if you live in the area and are craving sushi, but want to stay in your sweatpants. I will for sure be stopping in at some point to give the whole rotary sushi experience a try - especially now that I know how good their sushi is! Sounds like a fun way to try many different sushi rolls without breaking the bank."}, {"review_id": "BXe9DxfnMDFMpeYYQwMBOQ", "user_id": "8q7xPmUI05LI-xQN8DLOww", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "The sushi here is super mediocre, but the novelty of just grabbing whatever you want off the conveyor belt is unbelievable. This has turned into a favorite place of mine to take friends who aren't super into sushi or don't really know what to order. Instead of suggesting rolls or whatever else, you just put 'em on the inside of the table and have them go nuts grabbing plates.One tip: You really want to request to be seated near the start of the conveyor belt and not at the end. It's an exponentially better experience if you're getting first crack off of whatever comes off the sushi bar than it is being near the end and keeping your fingers crossed for whatever scraps make it all the way to your table.There's some pretty high levels of variance when it comes to how quickly people are snagging sushi, so, even if you get \"bad\" seats it'll still be a good time. I've also had similar experiences as other Yelpers when it comes to bad service here but thankfully unless you want specific desserts or appetizers it's all self serve."}, {"review_id": "O0YbEwhUdGARd1jR7ZUrIA", "user_id": "vmz9lMieICyu1npcDTakaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/11/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "So, it's been five months since we last visited.  We saw an advertisement in a local magazine advertising a daily lunch special for $ 7.99 per person.  What we didn't realize is that the lunch special included soft drink or tea, soup and salad, just like the normal dinner menu.  Know I can't promise that the portion of your entree is going to be the same as your dinner portion, but our's was.  So, we like the Bento Box which includes your entree, rice, pot stickers with special sauce and a mango cheese spring roll with special sauce.

Things change, but for Sushi Rotary it wasn't necessarily for the better. I was excited to hear from family that the menu has been updated. Cool. New items, right? Yes, but now they're doing everything under the sun. e.g., poke bowls, ramen, sushi pizza, and more.Sometimes, you try to please the masses by doing more, but what you should be doing is sticking with what you're good at. Execute on the fundamentals, and do it well. My experience with the family here was a mixed bag. Sushi off the belt was still decent, especially the traditional ones like the tuna nigiri or even the scallop. Ordering off the menu was another story. The Yaki udon noodles was basically just cabbage and noodles. Where were the other ingredients? A bit dry, and sticky. My wife ordered a bowl of tonkatsu ramen. The noodles were surprisingly undercooked. We told our server, and they took the bowl back to the kitchen only to nuke it in the microwave. It just ruined the entire bowl! Couldn't you just make another bowl? Microwaving the entire thing overcooked everything, and made the rest of our dining experience unpleasant.While the service was friendly, it was also lacking. We had to ask for everything from plates to napkins and even forks for the kiddos. Sadly, I will not be back here. I can't believe how far quality and service has dropped from our last visit.If you want to do poke bowls, ramen, and so many other things, why not just open up another restaurant? Seriously.

The atmosphere is light and fun, with modern décor and good lighting. The staff is friendly and attentive. I've never ordered off the menu, but the sushi selections on the conveyor belt are all excellent. There are lots of options at several price points (designated by the color of the plate). It's a great way to try lots of different sushi at a reasonable cost.Their \"train\" is smaller than a lot of other rotary sushi restaurants, so selection can seem limited after you've watched it go by once or twice. They do add new items, though. Also, the smaller size of the restaurant/train leads to long waits during peak hours. I'm not sure if they take reservations, but it would be worth calling to ask. Otherwise, be prepared to wait around 20-25 minutes for a seat at the bar.This is a great casual dining spot if you're craving sushi and in the mood to try different things. The location in the Fox Valley Mall circle is pretty convenient if you live/work in the area, or just happen to be nearby.

I love how it's set up. The sushi travels around the restaurant on a belt and you can pick out the dishes you want. I prefer to sit in the booths, and it makes for a very comfortable eating experience. The dishes are color coded and different colors means different prices ranging from $1.50 to $6.50. Most dishes fall in the $2.50-4.50 range. Because of this, it can get very pricey very quickly. I can put away a lot, so I come here expecting to pay about $20-30 for myself. Other people who I've brought spent less than $20 and were very satisfied. The key is to keep up with the math in your head and don't grab every single thing that looks good to you. If money is no problem for you, then pick whatever you want.I've seen some sushi dishes here that I haven't seen in other restaurants.
