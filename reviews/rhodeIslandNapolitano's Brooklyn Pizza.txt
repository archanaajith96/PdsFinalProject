It turned out to be the best birthday gift I received.Make no mistake. This is a down-to-earth, no-frills pizza joint sharing space with a gentleman's club and a popular taco shop in a strip mall, in the middle of a nearly obscure East St. in Cranston, parallel to New London Av. BUT the food is nothing less than outstanding, the service at dine in is genuinely attentive, and there is absolutely nothing pretentious about the full experience. I give this spot 5 stars! Generously sized pizza (that large is good for 3-4 people!), amazing garlic fries-- while a tad salty and greasy, possibly the Best. Garlic Fries. Ever.  (Check out the garlic in that photo). The wings! I have stopped eating chicken wings since having a nauseous experience recently, having been assaulted by the smell of a huge batch in a buffet, but I definitely made an exception for this one. It was that good (at least, for me--see pictures). Best part is that they do not have the garlic mozzarella wings on the menu but they were more than happy to indulge me.  Out came a really \"bad\" looking plate of tempting wings. When I say 'bad', I mean really, really good. I know. My description is ironic but this place churns out dishes that are so bad (pulling out all the stops) that they are actually so good. If you can relate to this description, you know this place deserves a swing by.  Most of all, the staff, from the cashier (who was patient with my dozens of questions), to the cooks and servers, even the delivery guy/supervisor, who took my preferences seriously, is A+.  I think they know they have a good product and are very happy to serve it.  This place rocks. Winner. Definitely going back there again."}, {"review_id": "-YLuajMesVB6jNy4nYPVew", "user_id": "oW7EKgd2uUfHoy_WcMLz8Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "i hate having to write this when so many others have enjoyed this restaurant. everything in this order, aside from the calzone, was cold. an italian burger that was supposed to be medium was so well-done it was burnt and had the incorrect toppings. the garlic bread can barely be classified as such. it was thick, fluffy, delicious, italian bread that had some sort of garlic butter smeared on beneath the ample cheese. the problem? it was so poorly toasted and melted it was inedible because of the strong garlic butter. the classic cheese calzone had SO MUCH mozzarella it was difficult to discern if there were any other toppings. the gluten free pizza is not to be helped. we are doomed with the gluten free garbage. i can't fault you for that one. in our delivery order, the only good thing was the wings, they were saucy and, although they were cold, they tasted great. the order was delivered twenty-five minutes past the 1.5 hour quote time."}, {"review_id": "1B9n6gCy3B4C6YB9gmlIDg", "user_id": "b-Wt4gm2e_XIZrq05qF8Yw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "This is perhaps my favorite pizza in all of RI, the pies are huge and always cooked perfectly and are priced reasonably well !!They do a great offer for lunches of 2 slices of pizza (cheese or pepperoni) and a drink for only $5 I cannot get enough of their pizza I will always make the drive to get pizza from here even when there is plenty of other places closer to me in West warwick"}, {"review_id": "A9tVZM_V9C8OyFuOJyFtvg", "user_id": "Mbu5VHg3BK87CRZlOTIkRA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "We had a wonderful experience last night at napolitanos pizza.

I asked if it would be ready to pick up in 30mintes, ordered a cheese and pepperoni pizza, mozz sticks and garlic fries. When my brother in law picked up the order, they didn't even have it in their system and said they never got it. The guy at the cashier had a horrible attitude and said that he never talked to me...... then all of a sudden they found it and it was ready in 2 minutes. Not to mention a woman walked in and said \"sorry I'm earlier but I ordered XYZ\" got her stuff left.I always go to this pizza place, Cranston and a Prov, but the business should have handled this more professionally, paid for my $30pizza order and loss the attitude.

I live in Newport and every slice I have had has been pretty mediocre, it was getting to the point that Domino's was the best pizza in the area.Thankfully, I got hungry while traveling around Warwick and I stopped by this place.  It is right next to an awesome California Burrito place, and I ducked in for a slice and a meatball sub.  The wife was with me, so we had the 2 slice combo with drink with a meatball sub.The 2 slices of pepperoni were pretty decent size, very greasy from all the fresh cheese melted on top, with a great pepperoni, and both the wife and I agreed this was the best pizza we have had in RI. They do it in a New York style, nice and toasted on the bottom, the toppings are nice and thick, and unlike every other place in RI I tried, they don't slide off like poorly constructed wrecks.  This pizza was absolutely the best we have had since we have been here, too bad its a 40 minute drive from where we are.The meatball sub was huge, and very filling. It was one and a half meatballs wide of meatballs in it, and they are big meatballs.  The sauce in the sandwich is a little sweet, but tasty with tons of melted cheese on top.I really enjoyed this place, and when I go shopping, I'll probably take a pie for take out next time.  Awesome little pizza shop, worth the stop, especially if you live in Newport, this is hands down better pizza than anything on the small little island..."}, {"review_id": "c6RQSfNKqA4xachPpvrAGw", "user_id": "eiiXoxbl2nzTy3VTsOd-Qw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/1/2017", "text": "Quality PizzaWe got a take-out pizza here using a Groupon deal.

They were soft, buttery and delicious. The garlic wasn't overpowering- Brooklyn deep fried calzone DAYUMM! had to try especially after reading the other reviews. We were extremely impressed how large this calzone was. It was like taking a bite into a savory stuffed dough boy, YUM! As soon as I cut into it the pipping hot cheesy  yummy goodness came oozing out.  I'm must say the visual experience was satisfying in its self. This dish is a must try you will not be disappointed at all! The atmosphere inside was what you'd imagine if you were looking for a nice classics, comfortable pizza place to hang out causally and grab a slice. Service was A+. Staff were very personable and accommodating despite how busy they were. *Con* speciality pizzas are sold as Large pies only. My daughters are extremely picky eaters and I would of love to try their different selections but unfortunately They only offer classic cheese and pepperoni by the slice.   Over all my experience was great and I'm very happy to have found this hidden gem.
