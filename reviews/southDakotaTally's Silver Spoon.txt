They have an oatmeal Belgian waffle topped with fresh berries, sliced banana, sweet vanilla yogurt, and BASIL! I never would have thought to put fresh basil on top of a waffle with fruit, but it was so lovely! The whole dish was perfect. I didn't even add syrup, it was wonderful as is. I also ordered the side car (egg and meat on the side) - I just wanted some bacon, but it was a dollar cheaper to get the sidecar and you get the egg addition.I enjoyed the coffee as well, and thought it was so awesome that our server offered to give me a to go cup of coffee for the road. Yes please! Wonderful people and food at Tally's. I'm in love with South Dakota."}, {"review_id": "fODqlihgNufDhWhJRjZWdg", "user_id": "XFmsuofG3Qzt1_2ByJHIsg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "This was one of the best meals I've ever had in my life. I was torn between two of the entrees so I rolled the dice with a four course chefs choice. Most of the dishes were different takes on what was already on the menu and we're absolutely perfect. I haven't had octopus I liked this much since my friends grandpa caught it fresh in Hawaii for us. I don't think you'd even be able to find a meal comparable for the same price anywhere in the states or Western Europe.The service was what you'd expect from a 5* white tablecloth establishment as well, even though I was sitting at the bar. Everyone that helped me was exceptional."}, {"review_id": "JtQ48OhxO-9gRElv3WphBA", "user_id": "Vf1Gdk2gVCP9xZrLTD9Y0g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Came for brunch, I was greeted by Ronald Reagan out front, a good sign!

If you could eat a picture then thats all I needed. It was excellent! The combination of the fruits, granolas, and sauces were a perfect compliment to each other and just the right portion size. Excellent service as well and good prices.

My family and I came for breakfast and all enjoyed a delicious meal. Tally's has a wide range of choices for breakfast and has added unique touches to each meal they have on their menu. I always love a breakfast place that uses local \"home grown\" food in the area and uses them to their advantages, in which Tally's has done tremendously. The wait was about an hour for a group of 7, but well worth it."}, {"review_id": "pMvo3INZPGtyXvHlSbxygw", "user_id": "dTl-jk5OojEeKC-rSgTWrQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "Before leaving Rapid City this morning we were looking for a great breakfast send off. Tally's was the perfect place for that. I ordered the Bagel and Lox and my fiancé ordered the Breakfast BLT. Wow! Just wow! My Lox was fresh and the bagel local.

While there was plenty of meat on the menu, being pescatarian here was easy. My French omelet had a great mix of fresh veggies and smoked Gouda cheese! Where else can you get smoked Gouda in your eggs? My husband had a spicy, turkey omelet that was the daily omelet special. Gluten free toast was good! We were there over Labor Day, so the 45 minute wait wasn't unreasonable.  Service was friendly and efficient. The restaurant felt kind of close and crowded, but it was far too hot to eat at their outdoor tables (although many others did). Meat lovers might have liked the duck confit, a surprising item on the menu!"}, {"review_id": "3tgv6WB6cOqN0EgDLEzUgg", "user_id": "uoUtiqXEpg6o4PVuX8U0SQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/8/2017", "text": "Came in for a late breakfast. Saw they had chicken fried steak on the menu, so went with it. Now, I've ordered this a ton of places. Half the time the plate arrives with a pre-made Sysco brand patty and warmed, canned white gravy glopped on top. Oh no, not this time!The cut was truly massive. The breading was pretty close to a beer battered fish filet and quite tasty. The hash brown was done perfectly. The eggs were cooked exactly to order and the toast was... toast. Bonus points for having Cholula and not only Tobasco.Ambience was nice and the furniture was upscale. Not sure if parking is always easy on the street, but I got a space right in front.Needless to say, I'm quite impressed."}, {"review_id": "K5ZkHrfQcbMKUekqJ-HI_g", "user_id": "dZnAKMbB14tXNxPr2GKggw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/20/2017", "text": "We came here on recommendation from a friend while Road tripping through her hometown of Rapid City, South Dakota. Coincidentally Tally's is also located across the street from the hotel we stayed at, The Historic (haunted) Alex Johnson Hotel.  This restaurant was very cute. It's a lot of locals frequented this restaurant. The waitress reminded us of Rooney Mara in Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.. The bacon was good. Pancakes were not cooked fully through the middle.The egg sandwich open face BLT was delicious with the smoked Gouda cheese. We both ordered a side of hashbrowns cooked crispy, they were good, but nothing to write home about. Coffee was unlimited and constantly flowing. Overall, very positive experience in this local gem."}, {"review_id": "1-hg20YjZdG6RYqJk46OIQ", "user_id": "e9UKDjFkzWpZ3_QnsZGX1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/16/2017", "text": "This place has fantastic service.  Our server was pleasant and professional, as well as very attentive.  The coffee is really good--smooth, not too acidic.  I was actually pretty surprised.  My breakfast was heaven on a plate--the in-house caramel, cinnamon roll made into french toast.  It was so good as-is, that the syrup was not needed.  I tried the roll the next day, regular-style, but the french toast trumped hands-down."}, {"review_id": "VwXIShSdnENydl9_43OI1g", "user_id": "E9YEWg3a0VD5O-niCaC80g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Always been a favorite breakfast spot & they only seem to get better.

The bison burger was good, but undercooked. My wife really like the Marsala bison pasta, to me it was too rich to eat an entire entree. The seafood pimontel tasted like straight wine.

I had a special, corned beef omelette, and my wife had a special, pork loin & yam eggs Benedict. Both were generous sized portions and cooked to perfection. Great attentive service and a fun atmosphere where everyone there seemed to be enjoying their food. We will be back and I am ordering the country fried steak next time. Multiple platters went past with it and I am intrigued now.
