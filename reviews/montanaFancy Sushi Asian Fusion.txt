The food is over priced and the service is bad. My wife is in town and we love sushi so I thought I'd give them another chance. We had the same waiter that seemed rather inconvenienced by our presence. The guy who sat us hit on my wife saying he'd date her if she wanted to dump me. After 5 minutes the rude waiter came by and said \"o you're not ready yet\" and walked off. I thought he might educate us on the menu or talk to us about specials.... something. After 10 minutes we still didn't have water or any idea about the menu. So we just left. From what I remember the sushi was fresh, but it's hard to eat when you are relying on a waiter that doesn't want you there. We headed over to \"Local\" where we are enjoying a great dinner with great service."}, {"review_id": "HvuMx67jAu1jUUFN6lSHAA", "user_id": "9-ISAa4BtH5ZUUXRwo3iuQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/1/2016", "text": "I feel so blessed to have sushi this tasty available- even if it is a four hour drive from home. Having moved from a place where good sushi is literally a five minute drive, I thought I'd have to come to terms with the fact that there wasn't going to be any options for this Japanese staple when I moved to Montana.Well, thankfully there's Yelp, to tell me where da sushi at. I was in Billings for business, and Fancy Sushi was a great find come lunch time. My fiance and I were sat promptly (it wasn't busy, but hey, I love attentive wait staff) and ordered the sashimi and nigiri lunch special. The miso soup was a little weak but the complimentary spicy tuna roll- man that was good- and dessert on the house definitely made up for it. The fish was fresh and melt in your mouth delicious, with big portions and beautiful presentation. I'm assuming he was the owner- (there's a photo of him if you thumb through the pictures for Fancy Sushi, tee hee) came to check on us several times which was greatly appreciated, and made me feel like a special and valued customer. That being said...a well deserved 5 stars for Fancy Sushi! I will without a doubt be back whenever I'm in town."}, {"review_id": "fmKAlDc0ddaD6oPJwliOFA", "user_id": "rq3F-wSZ3PMNybmaGS7p7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/27/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I've been back to Fancy Sushi at least 4 times since writing my original review, and I've been 100% pleased with the food and service.  I'm glad I gave them another chance.  Overall, I'd say this is my favorite restaurant in Billings!"}, {"review_id": "Q6t02tpyxnm60-YeMML3IA", "user_id": "q1FhNStdv2_b5527A1WqfA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "8/29/2017", "text": "Didn't seem fresh. The ratios of ingredients were off in the rolls. The yellowtail jalapeño roll was barely edible.

Their selection is a little limited by being in Billings, but what they do have is always fresh and artfully prepared. Also, the non-Japanese food on their menu is first-rate - we get Sweet & Sour Chicken for the little ones, and I always end up snitching a few pieces!Stop reading and go now!"}, {"review_id": "frhiq3fE1JxtHx5EVD-GYQ", "user_id": "1oPNm5Gf1HCwK4aWVhrV5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/14/2017", "text": "The wait staff was very polite and kind.
