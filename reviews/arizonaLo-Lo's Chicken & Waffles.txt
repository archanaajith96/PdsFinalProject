Having been in PHX several times now, I was ready to try something new - and what's better than some c&w for lunch?!West of the airport, Lolo's is in a cool renovated brick building - to me it felt more like a lunch than dinner spot, also because of the location. The atmosphere definitely fits the concept (modern-rustic kinda made me want a beer type ...) and was comfortable to hang out in! The service was spot on and our server was fun.Their menu is definitely heavy (I hope they never have to list calories!) but you know that going in. The menu has a large variety, all day breakfast, burgers, of course chicken/waffles and southern staples such as fried tomatoes, etc ... they have a platter option which I felt was a great way to get a flight across their menu. I had fried chicken and waffles with a side of mac'n'cheese - post nap optional.Everything was hands down delicious and everyone on our table really enjoyed their meal! Everything was well seasoned, the chicken was crispy and the waffles well made! Someone else recommended to eat chicken and waffles in the same bite ... ditto that and make sure to dip it in maple sirup!I'd recommend this place any day, it's different than you average lunch place and a fun atmosphere!"}, {"review_id": "_BBdaLh4BGhGKLoq2Q-IrQ", "user_id": "gEA3i1RsU9BDED7QVaWYaQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Lo-Lo's offers great food but it's overrated. I personally think the kool-aid was too sweet. I added water and ice to to reach my liking. As for the chicken and waffles, pretty good! But I'm not the type who will crave chicken in the morning. Definitely a one or two time experience. Prices a little too high for what it is. Plus, they're always packed  I can get a full off a delicious meal at U.S. Egg.

We've been wanting to try this place for ages. Specially since we've heard all the fuss about. Finally we were passing by and there was a parking spot, so we decided to try it. We got there and got sat right away. The lemonade was amazing! Then we ordered.Our food took over an hour. The restaurant was full but it was mainly because people's food take forever! We were optimistic saying it would be worth it. Finally the chicken was average. I preferred Church's chicken however. The whip mash was good. The macaroni was good. The hot sauce was okay. The atmosphere was nice. The server was very nice and attentive. That's why I give it an average rating. Would I come back?

ATMOSPHERE:Established in 2002 by Larry White, the restaurant is located in a quiet but shady-feeling part of southern Phoenix.  They proudly display their back-of-house operation with big windows along the sidewalk where you can see them making their biscuits.  The space has a fun vibe with soul music pumping throughout.  Brick walls and industrial décor made for a modern feel.  Seating is plentiful with a mix of booths, low tops and protected outdoor tables.MENU:It's a huge!  Southern-inspired breakfast selections, chicken & waffle combos, catfish, shrimp, grits, burgers, salads, desserts, kids menu.FOOD:Lil Amadi - $8.00This chicken & waffle combo came with a drumstick, a thigh and a waffle!  What a deal!?  The chicken was crispy, juicy and seasoned perfect.  I'm thinking they do a dry batter as there wasn't that nasty undercooked film you sometimes find in wet-battered fried chicken.  The waffle had a nice crunch and was moist inside but there was a hint of cinnamon coming from either the syrup or the waffle itself that I could've done without.  Still, I'd totally order this again.  Very tasty!One Buttermilk Biscuit - $4.29It was a hearty portion with great flavor and just the right amount of moistness.  Comes with a dollop of butter and jam to the side.Cheese Grits - $4.29Talk about butter and oil overload.  While it was tasty, there was way too much butter that crowned the bowl.  The copious amount of cheese also left a big oil slick at the top.  I understand that southern cuisine isn't healthy but they should be put on the side so one can regulate their cholesterol intake, LOL.SERVICE:Amanda was our terrific, on-the-ball server.  She was friendly, professional and checked on us often. TIP:The entire menu is available from breakfast time, which is how they earned our biz!OVERALL:The best chicken and waffles I've had yet.  Lively ambiance, nice menu, great service.  A definite return!"}, {"review_id": "rhGiX1adITG3ZMyp6SF21A", "user_id": "5FAD2Yq7DLBQ_-ef1iDA-A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Just not blown away.

The service was really good, our waitress was attentive and knew her stuff.I would highly recommend getting the fried cat fish. It's so damn good, best I've ever had. Also go the famous chicken and waffles, definitely more than enough for one, and it was delicious also. We also had mac cheese side and collard greens, those were ok for me. The food here is pretty solid tho.

I had no idea they had moved from the tiny house that Lo-Lo's started in to the huge modern new location (still on Central and Yuma) just South of downtown Phoenix. Very impressive building that can accommodate many many more people than before. It's still packed like it always was but you can check in online using Yelp!  It will tell you your time window and when to arrive at the restaurant. Very cool!Food is sooooo good. I had a three piece chicken platter and got mac n cheese and collard greens as my two sides. The hardest decision is what sides topick. They have many and they all sound really good! It also came with corn bread. Best corn bread I have ever had. The platter is so huge, I only ate one piece of chicken and took the rest home. They do have alcohol now, but I ordered sweet iced tea (best in town). I was way too stuffed to order dessert, but they looked really good. Perhaps I will order dessert first next time! If you are in the mood for some soul food, be sure to go to Lo-Lo's!  Don't forget to check in online through Yelp.

It seems like I only get here about once a year but I enjoy it every time I do. I may be an adult but I still love Kool Aid and it's not often you come across a place that serves it. I drank so much I was ready to float away. I ordered the Puffs chicken tender basket with a waffle instead of fries. You also get a choice of bbq or ranch for your tenders. I opted for the ranch and it was just ok. I prefer to eat my chicken with the waffle and syrup anyways. The chicken was moist and flavorful and the waffle was tender and delicious. We all ordered the same thing at the table but we also shared a side of Mac and cheese which was super creamy and delicious. A major improvement of per the Kraft we usually have at home.The service started out a bit slow but finished strong. Our server was very friendly.
