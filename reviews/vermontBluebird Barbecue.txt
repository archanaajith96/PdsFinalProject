I am dead serious. They're amazing. I could have eaten only that and been perfectly content. But no, we ordered the combo platter for two (which fed three of us easily). I did not care for the smoked turkey, it was too smokey. The brisket was really good and the pulled pork was decent. It came with four sides - we got beans, Mac and cheese, fries and sweet mashed. The beans and Mac were unremarkable but the two potato dishes were good, especially the fries with the skin on, my favorite. I wish we had thought to get some cornbread, that meal needed cornbread. I also really liked the Cabernet Sauvignon they served. I'm totally finding a bottle of that."}, {"review_id": "_rDShZxMdSoeQWlFH29H8A", "user_id": "KcFMI-hsr2Em7whfI4OM5g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Located along the river in an old barn/farm house type establishement, this restaurant has a few different dining rooms each with a different style. The interior is dark and reminiscent of an underground tavern or bar. There are many windows but they are covered by unnecessary blinds. As soon as we were seated next to one, I made sure to pull those ups and admire the view.Outside the establishement you can see the meat being cooked in large smokers in a little shed, the smell really follows you down the street. I loved being able to see my food beforehand and knew I was getting real bbq.We opted for the platter for two, which comes with your choice of 3 different meats and 4 sides. We got to sample the smoked turkey breast, baby back ribs, brisket and \"burn ends\" for an extra, which were all delicious. They have a couple of their house bbq sauces and aiolis including homemade ketchup which are a welcome addition, but I found the meat quite flavorful in itself.We chose fries, mac and cheese, coleslaw and mashed sweets for our sides which were also delicious. Just a word of caution if you are not used to eating mashed sweet potatoes, these are incredibly sweet, almost sickingly so!No real complaints about the food, the pricing and portion was fair, 40$ for two people.However I am disapointed with how their beers or cocktails are served. I was interested in trying their drinks considering they had a good selection of local brews but they only come in 12 or 16 oz glasses. For the same price, I am used to our Canadian pints which are a generous 20oz. Their beers were around $6 and some cocktails around $13 which seemed pretty steep.The free refills for sodas were also hard to get, it took over 20 mins in between drinks at one point which is far too long.Expect long lines on weekends, better to make a reservation, food will be worth it though."}, {"review_id": "jH89NOtFJMYwZwNIk1F05A", "user_id": "j3yAVzglp7XxA24iHRjl-g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "The food is great for this part of the country. They have a legitimate smokehouse and do a pretty good job with the meats. Service is friendly, and the waitstaff are attentive. However, having been raised in the south I can tell you that a couple of things need to change in order to make Bluebird a legit BBQ joint. Number one: Sweet tea is available as is regular unsweetened. But at $3.50 a glass which is loaded with ice the refills should be free. A legit BBQ joint has unlimited sweet tea. Kind of goes hand in hand with BBQ. Number two: Where's the buttered corn on the cob?Number three: They make their own sauces. The sweet maple bbq and the Texas style are legit. However, I've had many versions of Carolina style sauce (Mustard and Tomato pepper based) and Bluebirds doesn't cut the must mustard at all (pun intended). It's literally almost pure mustard. Just pass the \"French's. Carolina mustard base sauce should be sweet and tangy with a mild kick of mustard.  Number four: The beef brisket. It has good flavor and a decent bark. But it doesn't seem to soak up enough smoke flavor for being in the smokehouse for 15 hours. It was also a bit on the dry side. Maybe I just had a bad batch. Who knows. Pretty dry nonetheless. I've eaten brisket in Texas at many restaurants. Never had a dry piece until today. Brisket should melt in your mouth. You should also not have to saw it with a knife and chew for two minutes."}, {"review_id": "0t4wNimlIPPTsGXv-7koNQ", "user_id": "QKHm5bsOcd8Dl7f_8vOzug", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Not the best barbecue I've ever had, but probably one of the best barbecue joints in Vermont. I've always wanted to try this place and it was much better than I expected. We went on a Saturday, early evening, luckily the wait wasn't terrible. Weekends are always busy, so be prepared to wait, come early or just come on a weekday. Another reason to come early is to look for parking. They have their own private lot, but it's rather small. One of the main reasons why I wanted to check this place out was to try their BBQ Ramen...yes, Ramen, I was intrigued (I ordered mine with smoked pork belly). Overall, it was tasty and perfect for a cold winter's night. The broth was complex, smoky, and had a slight kick from the pickled jalapeños. The acidity from the pickled vegetables complimented the broth and fatty pork belly nicely. The noodle's texture was a bit too soft, I think they overcooked them. The soft boiled egg was a nice touch and was perfectly cooked.Their barbecue was pretty good too. We also ordered the baby back ribs and burnt ends. Both were very flavorful, tender, and had the right amount of smokiness to them. Overall their sides were very good as well, you can tell they make them in house. I wasn't impressed with their mac 'n' cheese, but their beans and pickles were spot on. They don't specialize in any particular style of barbecue and have a little bit of everything (e.g. Carolina, Texas, Alabama, etc...). Service was very good and friendly."}, {"review_id": "vSQyVqn3aRWK5fzBBPLl7w", "user_id": "6S2hVlEHOdlwaRphc_8U4g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "My mom and I stopped off here on sunday afternoon.

Great barbecue at very reasonable prices!When you arrive, make sure to check-in on Yelp to see what free food item you can receive. I was offered the corn bread with maple butter or house made pickles. Start the experience off with a specialty cocktail, glass of wine or one of a large selection of draft or bottled beers (including Pabst in a Tall Boy can)! Went to Bluebird for the Wings and Burnt Ends....they both did NOT disappoint!The order of 6 wings come smoked and then are offered two ways....Buffalo or Pitmaster. On Tuesdays, they also offer a Korean style wing.After smoking the wings, they will deep fry them to make them crispy. Although the buffalo was good, The Pitmaster crushed it in flavor profile.They both came with sauces to dip into (chipotle sauce and house made ranch) but you definitely don't need them. The flavors on the wings were done perfectly.The Burnt Ends, for $5, were incredible. A large side of Ends, smothered in a sweet and savory BBQ sauce. They were fork tender and worth every penny.  The ribs and homemade sausage looked incredible.  Sit at the bar, grab some drinks, great BBQ and watch the games on one of the many TVs in the bar area.They have seasonal offerings that will be worth me continuing to come back to try."}, {"review_id": "C8wLgwrR9wvmdwGKFjHRAQ", "user_id": "YlViQVX38fLFEXPiuhaRLQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Our server was great and the food was awesome.

Very good onion rings, though I'd call them onion straws. Brisket was tender, flavorful and smoky. Pork was moist and spare ribs, though a little spare, were delicious.

LJ was right -- this place is AWESOME. Take note of their hours before you go; we arrived at 4pm, only to discover they didn't open until 4:30, so we (like many others) waited in the parking lot until the doors opened. Beautifully landscaped exterior, with a breathtaking wooded backdrop (visible from behind the bar and from the deck off the back of the building.) Rustic (and IMO, romantic) interior, with exposed beam ceilings and stained glass. Feels like a tavern inside. Very cool. Waitstaff was young but attentive. Our server, Kyle, was the best! Great energy, personality and sense of humor.Cocktail (I had the Ti'Mont; Rye whiskey, Fernet Branca, lime, maraschino liqueur and smoked maple syrup!) was beyond my imagination delicious. Thanks to LJ's tip, we checked in on Yelp and chose the corn bread with (what I referred to as the \"buttercream frosting\") whipped maple butter, as our complimentary amuse-bouche. Then we ordered: Burnt Ends as our appetizer and the Barbecue For Two platter (includes 3 meats & 4 sides): pulled pork, baby back ribs, St. Louis cut spareribs, mac n' cheese x2, smashed sweet potato and mixed greens. In one word: UNBELIEVABLE. The meats were tender, smoked perfectly, just enough sauce, nice balance of flavors. The sides were all delicious, too. My *only* disappointment was dessert. I ordered a slice of the chocolate peanut butter pie and had high hopes, given that my expectations had been far exceeded up till then. Unfortunately, the slice was tiny (for $7) and tasted store-bought. The dollop of whipped cream that accompanied it was barely the size of a silver dollar and the chocolate sauce wasn't great. Not the way I'd hoped the meal would end.So next time I go, I'll be happy with a few orders of burnt ends and some drinks, but I'm sure I'll break down and order more. It's all SOOOO GOOOD!"}, {"review_id": "XHxmst6wj7mmiVltv97Uiw", "user_id": "JENszdw8HeQpJmDgaRAYbQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/8/2017", "text": "Four of us (self, wife, her brother, his wife) were looking for dinner in the Burlington VT area.  I was a bit hesitant to take her to a BBQ place since she doesn't eat pork or even beef... but the do half-chickens, and her favorite, smoked turkey breast.  I'm a big fan of BBQ myself, Yelp gave this place high ratings, the pricing was decent, the online menu looked good, and it was close by (we were staying in Colchester, just a couple miles up the road).  So we went.We were not in the least disappointed.  The sister-in-law-in-law spotted their \"three meats serves two\" deal, and we agreed that on top of cornbread and onion rings, that would be plenty for the four of us (and save a little cash), especially after I convinced them (even my wife) to also try a \"tasting\" of the \"burnt ends\", something I was exposed to in Kansas City last year and very much enjoyed.  So that's what we wound up with, going for the smoked turkey of course, plus brisket and baby-back ribs, and on the side we got the slaw, pit beans (kinda like baked beans on steroids), \"smashed sweets\" (yes, mashed sweet potatoes, not broken candy), and mac-and-cheese.Everything was delicious!  Not necessarily what we *expected*, but still, delicious.  I hadn't noticed that the description of the onion rings said \"thinly sliced\", so it was kinda more like a mass of fried onion-strings, but still good.  The meats came out with fairly little spicing on them (beyond some smokiness), but that's because they supply a variety of sauces for us to add in whatever volume or combination we wanted.  Thorough person that I am, I tried most of the sauces, and a few combos, on most of the meats, and it was All Good.  The ribs weren't \"literally falling off the bone\" tender, requiring some knife-work, but still tender and flavorful.Another good unusual find there was, as I called it on Twitter, \"Shploing!, by @omnipollo -- the beer that's almost as fun to order as it is to drink!\"  (No connection to Don Martin AFAIK.)  Despite the weird flavors, and \"worse\" yet in an unusual combo, which in beers often turns out horrible, this was still quite good!I was a bit surprised to find a BBQ joint this far north, this popular.  But IMHO it's well deserved.  If you like BBQ, and find yourself near Burlington, check it out!  (Including the beer menu.)  Just one tip: the lot on the right, where we pulled in, is small and tight, so try the one on the left.  We didn't spot it until we got to the door, and it looked much roomier."}, {"review_id": "DUMNKZ5X0abJwPB2iYGsqA", "user_id": "XFi-STSBc5LiTmRQBEPC9A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Went here on a Friday night for the \"barbecue for 2\" with 3 meats and 4 sides and got some cornbread as well.

Most of the restaurants near our hotel did not have good reviews, Bluebird was the best from what I was reading so off we went for some BBQ.We were shown to a table and I couldn't help notice that it was unusually warm in the place. Then I noticed that the area we were sitting in was open to the outside and since it was also raining it was also quite humid. I didn't mind so I looked at the menu and ordered an Old Rasputin Imperial Stout. I also did a Yelp check in and got the offer for a slab of corn bread. I also noticed that they charge for corn bread. Most BBQ joints I've been to give you a piece of cornbread as part of the meal. The corn bread as it turns out was the highlight of the meal. I ordered the brisket with beans and slaw. My wife ordered the baby back ribs with mac and cheese and slaw. The portion size was on the smaller side, unusual for a BBQ place and the prices were not cheap. The meat was also on the fatty side. I know fat equals flavor but I'm paying for meat not fat. The service was also on the slower side.If I ever pass through Burlington again I'll drive into downtown where the selection of restaurants affords better dining choices.
