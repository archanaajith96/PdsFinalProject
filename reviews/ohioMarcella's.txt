The meal is served with a gigantic piece of chicken, breaded and seasoned extremely well. They have a tomato sauce that is spicy as well, which was fantastic when I had it.The only reason I don't want to give this place 5 stars is because it is a tight squeeze. The restaurant itself is pretty small and hard to maneuver in. It can be very loud which I know is out of their control, but the tables are just so close to one another. The atmosphere is fantastic and they have good drinks to choose from. With my bad hearing though, it makes it a little difficult to hear my server or my company, especially when they're busy.All in all, this place is fantastic and I'll let the food do the talking. I'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "tCys463zYbEw6Gvy8f_5EA", "user_id": "QEpNF4Hag6_W9Stc-1Frvg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "+ Gluten Free- Yes, ask for Gluten Friendly Menu+Casein Free- Yes, item specific with modificationsUgh, I had high hopes for Marcella's, especially since I love their sister restaurant Martini Modern Italian; however, from the start things were rocky and never got better.Seriously, the two most memorable things about dining at Marcella's is the dry powered hand soap that makes your hands feel nice and soft, and then the Italian sausage. What went wrong:- Reservations- It doesn't matter if you have them, you can expect a wait. Having an 8:45 PM reservation and getting seated over 30 minutes later is ridiculous. For what it's worth, they use OpenTable.- The noise. It's loud when its crowded. To be fair the build setup/design there is nothing to adsorb the noise. Plus it doesn't help when all the tables around you are trying to have a conversation with and are pretty much in what seems like a screaming so members of their parties can hear each other. - Service- Server was friendly but stretched thin.- Back of the house - I know it was busy, but execution of dishes was a running 30+ minute wait. -Food - First and foremost, GF can be a pain in the ass to cook; however, when it's done wrong it can taste unappealing, which it did.-Drinks - The Strawberry Balsamic was quite refreshing.

It's located on High street, not too far from the end of the convention center and near a few bars and other restaurants, but skip the other places and go to Marcella's. I didn't have time to sit and eat so I called ahead and my food was ready for pickup as soon as I got there. It was super busy and a lot of ppl were waiting for tables so either go early or make a reservation if they allow for it. I ordered the pesto shrimp pizza after seeing some delicious pics on yelp and reading some very convincing reviews. The pizza was a thin crusted pizza, and the dough was soft and amazing. The pizza has pesto sauce topped with tomato, red onions, and shrimp. The pesto wasn't heavily added am it gave just the right amount of flavor to the pizza. The tomatoes were amazing, similar to how they'd be on a margherita pizza and perfectly spread out. I love that they were not stingy with the shrimp and there was at least one piece of shrimp on each rectangle slice. I will say that if you aren't a huge fan of red onions, order it without. I had half of it without red onions and that side tasted so much better. I'm also biased because I'm not a big fan of onions but it definitely can be enjoyed without. I promise you that the next time I come to Columbus, I will be visiting Marcella's as soon as I land!"}, {"review_id": "P68soVIY7_BYcf9zilHsIA", "user_id": "a41IoxVZ05aGm8i1RtdTAA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Restaurant is always busy and good.

The dim lighting totally screams Sopranos. Our server gal did a good job, friendly and efficient. All orders were taken in a timely fashion, and checks were correct. I started with the Beet Salad. The dressing was borderline too tart/pucker. However, the candied nuts and goat cheese dollops were a great paring. Just wish there was more. A great amount of arugula, but more of the sweet would have better counterbalanced the lemon dressing.Split a Pepperoni Pizza, added mushrooms and green peppers to my half. Tasty toppings and cheese, as well as the perfectly crisp-edge, soft-center crust. The pizza's not ginormous, but could easily feed two people with an appetizer. Was it worth $15? Very solid taste, but perhaps there's equal or better out there."}, {"review_id": "Erpk0uanv-yKv9GoavP4UA", "user_id": "4rA-ZWXUcW9FkVhzuL5SQQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "I've been here several times over the years and have always had a good experience. The atmosphere is what keeps me coming to the Short North location vs the one at Polaris. It's just more intimate, dimmer lighting and the old Yukon building brings lots of charm. It was much louder than I remember it being in the past but it was also a busy Friday night. I would definitely recommend making reservations or else be stuck  with a long wait! The Polaris location is much larger, better for bigger parties and has plenty of parking but lacks the charm of the smaller, intimate Short North location.The food is oh-so-so-delicious. The Fettuccine and Meatball is one of my favorites. The meatball is huge, for one, and it just melts away in your mouth. The best meatball I have ever had. Another top favorite is the classic Chicken Parmesan. There's a mixture of white and red sauce and it's just, yum yum yum! The Prosciutto and Melon app is also good. All of their wines are Italian and I never know what to get there. I typically gravitate towards a cab, and the waiter was helpful in recommending what I would likely enjoy. She even brought out 3 samples to help me decide! Of course my favorite was $15 a glass! (Toscana Luce della Vite, if you're wondering). I ended up going with the Toscana Santa Martina to keep things a bit more cost effective. They also have cocktails. I believe it's the Tequila Aperitif I've had before that was awesome. A beer list is available as well, but it's not overly extensive. Overall, this is a great spot for a nice date night or catching up with friends. Just make sure to make a reservation and plan ahead for parking!

My colleagues made a reservation here for dinner one night and we were split, half of us having eaten her previously and half of us new. It was the day before Valentine's Day so I don't know if that had anything to do with it, but it was very busy for a Tuesday night. Also very loud. I don't need a quiet ambiance but we were a group of 6 and I could only talk to the people directly on either side of me, and even that was with leaning and yelling. Let's talk service. Our waitress came with menus then didn't return for a solid 15 minutes for drink orders. Most of us ordered wine with a few cocktails mixed in. We were also ready to order food at that point because we had so long to browse the menu, but when we asked she said she'd return after the drinks were put in to order food. Okay...She returned another 15 minutes finally with drinks and some of our party was already a bit perturbed. The wine orders were all wrong sizes--we all ordered the smallest size to be on the same page but 3/4 were the medium size. We said they were incorrect as soon as she sat them down before we took a sip and she seemed very annoyed, even asking if we were sure we didn't order the medium size. What happened to the customer is always right? But honestly, she had made the mistake. She left to fix them and one of us ordered calamari for an appetizer. She returned a good 10 minutes after that, at which point we had been there about 45 minutes and hadn't even ordered our meals. Correct wine orders and calamari served, we finally got to. Now, I didn't try the calamari because that's one area of seafood I don't care to try. The general consensus of the table, though, was that it was okay but more zucchini was on the plate than calamari. At one point, one of my coworkers popped a piece in her mouth that turned out to be a whole piece of garlic. She was not happy. There was calamari left on the plate when the waitress took it away so with 5 people eating it and there still being leftovers, I'm going to say it wasn't great. Everyone seemed content with their actual meals. Between us, there was a pepperoni and banana pepper pizza, goat cheese ravioli, regular pasta with one of their huge meatballs, and capellini with roasted tomatoes. Everyone seemed pleased with these choices. I got the capellini and was picturing cavatelli in my head, so that was a bit disappointing but my fault lol. The roasted tomatoes were good though, If not a little too garlicky. Actually, most things were too garlicky, even for Italian. Many of us wanted the chicken parm because it looked so good in pictures but we didn't want to be stuffed, but I'm wishing I had because I think I would've felt like the meal was wow! Instead of okay. All in all, I wouldn't return. I wasn't impressed by the food and I definitely wasn't a fan of the loud atmosphere, which doesn't gel with the quaint old Italian decor of the place that wants to be more like a romantic, quiet night out. I'd bet there are better Italian restaurants in the city, hopefully with kinder, more timely service."}, {"review_id": "krZwWy2pKHOJi4QIDWtspw", "user_id": "5od3ueBiCc7VYxXh6lbYKQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "I've always heard people refer to 'Cameron Mitchell Service'. \"It's what he's known for!\", they say. After dining at Marcella's, I finally know what they're talking about.Marcella's can certainly feel 'themed' or contrived at times, but an undeniable undercurrent of quality permeates throughout the operation. House cured meats, fresh salads and cheeses, great pastas and seafood dishes, a surprisingly rare and diverse wine selection... and that's all before you consider the 'Cameron Mitchell Service', which is perhaps the star of the show. The night my wife and I dined at Marcella's was packed beyond belief. Despite arriving at 5:20 for a 6:00 PM reservation, we still had to wait until 6:10 to get a table. Marcella's is undeniably a 'turn-and-burn' restaurant, meaning, be prepared to feel pressure to order, eat and get out (which is fine at these prices).I had the linguine with clams & EVOO, and no pancetta. Pancetta is typically used to saltify a dish, which I find redundant when dealing with clams and a heaping portion of fresh Parmesan cheese. And while the menu says EVOO, I suspect there was a good amount of butter in there too. Nevertheless, the clams were fresh, the pasta - al dente, and was the best linguini with clams that I've had in Columbus. I will definitely be returning for it. The Cesar salad was also fresh and crisp, with a tangy sauce and fresh, salty sardine (optional). Try it with some fresh cracked pepper.    But let's get back to the service. From the amazing bartender -- who was friendly, professional, and attentive and who brought waters without having to ask -- to the front desk staff who never lost their cool despite the angry mob, and who got us a table away from the chaos up front, to our friendly and knowledgeable server, everyone in Marcella's works at a high level. When you walk through the restaurant, every employee gets out of your way, even when you insist that they go first. It's a subtle but telling characteristic of great management, and makes for an overall exciting dining experience. Marcella's is my new local 'go to' for traditional Italian food."}, {"review_id": "VQEk3wJEBSmORaJc_fHRKg", "user_id": "XtGJeaWzJ-2l82gmc6zGYA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "I really wanted to like it here, but the food taste and quality is always inconsistent yet the service is consistently terrible.

The short north area is nice too, with plenty of more pricey steakhouses next door but if you're in the mood for some hearty Italian tapas- this is your spot. Our service was great- our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu and attended to our needs. We had the braised veal meatball (huge) and melted pecorino cheese to start. Both were excellent dishes enjoyed by our group of 5. We also ordered the crispy potato pizza to share, which was another crowd favorite. The cheese was tasty, and the thin texture was perfectly chewy. My coworker and I shared the salmon dish and a beer salad, and both were really tasty with good light flavors. To end our night, we tried the profiteroles, which were a good size to share. Nothing amazing for this dessert, but a nice sweet cap to the night.

Not acceptable.  Food service was slow, but once food started to come, it was timely paced which was appreciated--courses came in order, and not until the previous course was finished.Had not been here in a while and forgot how loud it was.  May be the loudest restaurant in columbus, which is partly a result of the music that blasts overhead.  Not really into this.Had salads to start--chopped salad was absolutely fantastic--the caprese salad looked underwhelming, which was sad considering it's the climax of tomato season.Burrata appetizer was pretty good, but appeared to be half of a burrata and not a whole one.  Have had bigger, better, for cheaper in Boston and NYC.  The tomato jam was nice, but would be nice if it didn't come spread on the the toasts, as they got soggy fast.Had the meatball pasta--one of their veal meatballs served over fettuccini alfredo...meatball was great, pasta was good, but overlooked.Companion had chicken piccata--was an airline breast that didn't really work well with the dish.  Smaller portion, but price was fair I suppose to make up for the portion size.Menu to me is a little boring and could use an update.  Started with a cocktail that was rye, cynar and cointreau...it was really nice.Like I said, food was generally good, but wait for drinks and the indifferent greeters took this down a star.  Also no one working the valet, despite having several meters blocked off our front.  Not good."}, {"review_id": "ArehDpGEdv0vV_jnznWPQA", "user_id": "VO21I2Hw6oWMXLzvP1QLnA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/14/2017", "text": "Marcella's vegetarian options were simple, but great.
