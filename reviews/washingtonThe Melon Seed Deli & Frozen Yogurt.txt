The workers are always friendly and accommodating and their froyo is delicious! The only downside is that they only have four flavors to choose from. This week it was Green Apple/Watermelon or Strawberry/Vanilla! The serving sizes are very generous, a medium cup would have easily been enough for my sister and I both had we known! I will continue to support the Melon Seed and encourage everyone to try their massive froyo in a carved pineapple at least once!"}, {"review_id": "53wUVoTPct4fgcfoGlHc4A", "user_id": "yF6ejgifrP9K2uJ-3zGf2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "This place was delicious! We ordered the Sexy Salad and Southwestern Salad. They were huge and full of amazing toppings. Even our toddler loved them! We also got a Bahama Mama. It was really good and packed full of fruit!

I've been yelp stalking this cute, modern eatery on Yelp for months with enticing pictures of beatuiful tropical fro yo, enormous salads and delectable sandwiches. On entering, it's reasonably modest in size, but makes great use of the space. There are plenty of tables and a clean, light atmosphere. Every customer (about 7 by the time I left) were greeted when entering and most by first name! I ordered a spiked tuna salad and slider duo of a Ruben and the Melon Seed to go. Everything is carefully and beautifully prepared and, with two orders in front of me, I was there for approximately 15 mins. During that time, the staff was busy making food and taking orders but also manage to make sure everyone was given multiple yogurt samples table side! Incredibly delicious and definitely would have brought some home if I didn't live so far north. The staff warmly thanked me for coming and I headed home worried that the salad wouldn't hold and sammies might get soggy. Not the case at all!The spiked tuna salad is by far the best take out salad I have EVER had which goes without saying that it's the BEST salad I've ever had casually dining. The sliders were right up there too. The Melon has cream cheese in it which sounded strange but truly made the sandwich unique and addicting. The Ruben was also great but I'd recommend going with their recommendations and the specialty sliders. Between the lovely, smiling staff, the cute decor and amazing food I'll be making the drive again (and again)."}, {"review_id": "nlA9eWM12Zv1-EXIqGf27g", "user_id": "-7jwGtQBXRLaPluMP4JsjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Oh my goodness, this place is such a treat! My fiancée and I were craving fro-yo and we refused to visit Menchies or other boring yogurt bar chains. We found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. I'm so happy we stopped in because it was incredible! Savannah was super sweet and greeted us right when we walked in. She was quick to tell us what they had to offer and grab samples for us. She was fun and peppy and very informative; the other employees working on the sandwich side also were crazy nice as I could slightly hear the descriptions and small talk they were having with other customers. Everyone was so friendly and the yogurt was refreshing and generous as were the toppings!! We can't wait to go back and try food from the deli side. It looked amazing"}, {"review_id": "Uf7OE4IUBcKlPZyPwcrbJQ", "user_id": "jTLcYO0sWQergwONKPcNNQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/15/2017", "text": "The Melon Seed offered a greater experience than I had anticipated. Honestly I am delighted to have stumbled upon this place.I saw pictures of frozen yogurt in hollowed pineapples. That's what got me. I knew that after seeing photos of it, that I too, needed to experience this pineapple frozen yogurt goodness. The place must be doing something right if it's reviews are that stellar though, right?The place is darling. It's vibrant pink and green (like watermelon!) and cozy inside. They offer frozen yogurt, but have a whole menu of sliders and soup/salad as well. They have a lot of options, and they are really friendly in making suggestions. Their best selling slider is the turkey and bacon chutney, which is the one I knew I had to try too. You can get sliders on either their French bread or their Hawaiian roll. I got the French bread and did not regret it.The turkey and bacon chutney was so good. Each slider order comes with two sliders and tortilla chips. The greens on the sliders were really fresh. The tomato slices were plump and juicy, and the cucumbers were fresh and crisp. The turkey was moist and the chutney was so good! Seriously, it was a flavorful bite that wasn't overwhelming at all. The bread really is the perfect vessel for it all.I of course had to get the pineapple frozen yogurt. It's called the bahama mama and you can put the frozen yogurt flavor of your choice in it. They are super nice and bring out samples on a platter for you to try. They even decorate the platter with fruity pebbles, my gosh! It was too cute. Both samples I tried were good, but I went with the pomegranite/lime swirl. There are tons of fruits on the bahama mama including blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, pineapple (of course), lychee popping jelly, fruity pebbles, and even a fortune cookie. It's decorated with umbrellas and it's made for a photoshoot. It was all delicious, tart, and fresh too. It's big, so yes, do share (or come with a sweet tooth!).What can I say about service? They are so freaking kind here. Each person was hospitable. I was greeted by multiple people, given great recommendations... the food was served, they even brought water for our table even though we never asked for water, the frozen yogurt samples were beautifully presented, our meal was cleaned up before dessert, and they said they would take care of bussing our table. My goodness, they were just all so wonderful.I love this place and it was such a pleasant experience. Definitely recommend and I will most definitely come back."}, {"review_id": "hfGFXrPEypxx9NAhlk3D5A", "user_id": "p8hWf9PwoCeXwENm9N9RGw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "I tried this place for the first time today with a friend and we were not disappointed!  It's a cute unassuming place with bright colors and the atmosphere was super comfy.  I ordered a tuna melt and it was delicious!  The bun was crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside it was brushed with garlic butter (?).  Lots of cheese and the spice mix was so yummy!  Very filling.  The yogurt for dessert was strawberry & cream.  Service was awesome everyone was friendly and it was very clean!  I'll definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "23sCmyRNzx1PIzBnrq6Lxg", "user_id": "5-ak5496qTs8XA9S2SBYbg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "I've seen other reviews of Melon Seed which made me want to go check it out.

I had been dying to try this place, but they are closed on Sundays. I finally tried it this week and it lived up to the 5 stars and more. I didn't catch the manager's name, or at least I believed him to be the manager by his professional demeanor. He was hands-on and dove right in along side the employees. Aside from fine dining I don't think I have ever experienced the level of service we received at Melon Seed. The service alone will have me happily return as a frequent customer. Every employee we interacted with were pleasant and eager to ensure we had an exceptional experience. You can tell they are under great leadership and enjoyed helping with genuine smiles. I watched locals come and go during my visit and they all seemed to know the staff by name, with fist bumps and \"happy to see you\" greetings. We need more businesses like this. People who care about their customers. The food was delicious! I was skeptical on the bun size and opted for the duo sandwich meal. To my surprise I was full on just one. Spicy tuna and turkey chutney, are the way to go! Their use of quality, fresh ingredients do not go unnoticed. I appreciate their level of thought and passion and will happily spend my money here any day!Thank you!Keep doing what you're doing. #amazing"}, {"review_id": "j4tYij2awoDDxkSuIDbEMw", "user_id": "em7eZEhBifxmLLcJa9NI3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/12/2017", "text": "I love this local gem. The food and service here are always wonderful. The prices are extremely reasonable. There are only positive things I can say about this place.I came here yesterday with a friend. We both shared an order of Melon Seed Slider. It was delicious and one of the server even brought out their seasonal flavored frozen yogurts for us to try. One had pomegranate and the other had raspberry. With this place being so close to where I live, I'm surprise I don't stop by here as often. I highly recommend trying their sliders and frozen yogurt! I have heard great things about their salads.

You would never expect the food quality/tastiness in this little place. Not to mention the staff are fantastic and super friendly! So many food choices!!! It's always busy when we go in for lunch. My husband and I tried their Spiked Tuna slider and salad, Hawaiian sliders, BBQ chicken sliders and salad, smoked salmon chowder, and chili- ALL are super yummy. Plus they have very affordable kids meals which include a small serving of their frozen yogurt- Mmmmmmm!! They only downside I would say is that the wait for your food can be a bit long, especially if it's busy with a bunch of people. The very first time we came in they got slammed during the lunch rush and forgot to give us our frozen yogurt. But I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone in the area!!
