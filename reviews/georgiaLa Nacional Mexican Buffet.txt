They didn't have cheese quesadillas and made one for me upon request.  They have horchata here too. They accidentally charged me for a soda I didn't have but I didn't mind since it still was dirt cheap for what we had and the waitresses hustle to keep the tables clean and customers happy."}, {"review_id": "370jW0E39GYxYV7ytRPCuQ", "user_id": "9iCwwnE_yEWZm46w2VUtyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "Normally I wouldn't eat at a buffet but this place is an exception.

Unlike most chain which gives you a huge quantity they take from it the quality of the food. This buffet does it right quality over quantity. About 30 or less to choose from but all have its own wonderful taste. The price itself is very reasonable and worth it. Though the appearance may need some work, still look a lot cleaner then most restaurants. Will definitely go back and soon."}, {"review_id": "Vo3cithora8zYb11EF88gw", "user_id": "yGrST5ROxNnHCaer8OJT5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "I was very sceptical about a buffet Mexican restaurant but if your luck enough to be around the food when it's fresh it is amazing.

I couldn't help but get extremely nostalgic perusing the aisles to a soundtrack I couldn't help but dance to!Truly an oasis for homesick Central Americans!

I never knew the restaurant existed because it is located in a hidden corner of a street intersection.The first thing I want to say is that the restaurant is a \"hole in the wall\" but that would be too harsh. It is actually a step up but I would not bring a first or second date there for sure. It is clean enough but a bit loud sometimes with the background music. The seating and tables are functional and that is about it. Nothing more, nothing less.But let's get to the food. It is wonderful but it can be rich. While I am not qualified to say it is Mexican \"authentic\", it sure tastes authentic to me. In other words, I have been to Taco Bell and a few sit-down Mexican and Tex-Mex restaurants which tend to \"Americanize\" the food.But at La Nacional, I find the food authentic, flavorful, rich, and yes, a bit heavy. Eating at this buffet will likely put you into a food coma afterwards. For those of you going there for lunch, you will enjoy it but you might suffer afterwards when you feel like you want to go take a nap. I've gone during evenings or weekends and every time, I come out full and want to go take a nap. It is the price I willingly pay when I eat there.I can tell you when I am there, I see all kind of working guys packing the food away. They often come in small groups. They love the quantity (and presumably) the quality of food there also. The service is adequate, not stellar. But what the heck, we are talking about a buffet, not a high-end French restaurant.I want to give this place 5-stars but I think what holds me back is that the place can get loud and the decor can be improved a bit. But otherwise, I really enjoyed the authentic food, its flavor, and cooking style."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-nacional-columbus?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
