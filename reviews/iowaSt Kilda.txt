Super trendy with the brick walls and the lighting. Second, GREAT food. I got the avocado toast with a poached egg and it was SO good. Definitely one of the better avocado toasts I've had. Third, GREAT drinks. I got a bloody mary and it was so unique and tasty.But most importantly, they have a great staff. My family of 5 came in on a Saturday around 11 and it was so busy. It was past our wait time and we could tell the waiter was felt so bad. He was so kind to us as we waited and once the people before us left he immediately cleaned it off so we could sit. It was so kind!If in Des Moines, I would definitely hit up St Kilda's for brunch. You won't be disappointed!!"}, {"review_id": "P-KWeEmpCBFZ34JqbBECag", "user_id": "aQswdhl2IWN9rQCmzm-9pw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "This is probably the boujee-ist place in town. I walked in and couldn't tell who was staff and who was diners. We didn't make a reservation and didn't need one. Walking in, I tried to get up to what looked like the bar and some guy kept getting in my way until I realized he was a waiter and was attempting to get me seated. Throughout the course of our meal, about 6 different people either took our orders, dropped off drinks and refilled waters. The whole experience was confusing and kind of weird. I ordered the famous avocado on toast and it was really really good, to their credit. Literally none of the food was bad, and the dessert was quite tasty as well. It's a bit pricey for what I got, but I was full when I left and didn't have many complaints other than the weird service and the wait time between ordering drinks and dinner. Overall, I'd go back if someone else suggested it, but I can't imagine craving it so much that I need to go back."}, {"review_id": "zQtudMq1tZdwTGqSvDiTyw", "user_id": "OGYP10OzoedXEVCKr8CMrA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "St. Kilda recently opened for dinner. This review is for their dinner service.Came with a party of 5. Service was just okay - staff was friendly and accommodating. Couldn't remember the name of our server but she disappears a lot. We were supposed to be a party of 6 but since 1 couldn't make it, we had an extra glass of water. Let's just say my friend drinks a lot of water and since we see only see our server once in a while, she was drinking from 2 glasses of water waiting for refills in between. I wouldn't ding a star for service because in retrospect, it was a Saturday night so maybe they were just slammed.The Alligator - I think this drink is delicious as I like sweet drinks but I would rate this drink 4/5. I do like it as it is not overly sweet. St. Kilda used a splash of coconut milk and the drink is lightly sweetened, which is good. I dinged a star because I still thought it was bland. I couldn't taste the alcohol at all and personally it made me think I was drinking juice. I think that is the kicker and why I kept my rating 4/5 and not lower. You can't really tell you are drinking an alcoholic drink, which is still good regardless. You don't want to overpower the drink mix with alcohol. But I still think that the drink is sort of bland. Soup of the day - my friend ordered the soup of the day and I took a sip and it was awesome. It was tomato red bell pepper soup. It was creamy and sweet and my first words were \"oh my god\". It was that good. The tomatoes and red bell peppers seemed to be roasted and pureed as it was thick and creamy. Highly recommended.Housemade ricotta - I was going to take a pic but my party quickly devoured it. Let's say it was good so I will leave it at that. It was big enough to be shared by 5 people but only as an appetizer. It will not fill each of the party up.Short ribs - I thought the ribs were very soft and tender and quite flavorful. The crispy sweet potato shreds on top of the ribs were phenomenal. I think the sweet potato shreds were what made the ribs special. It was a nice play in the texture of the dish as each bite is flavorful from the truffle jus/apple parsnip puree, meaty sort of like teriyaki flavor of the short rib, and then bam!!! you get a crispy texture with each bite. I would order it again. I thought the apple parsnip puree was phenomenal too because I like sweet things but it was not overly sweet at all. I was hesitant to order the dish because I was worried the apple parsnip will make the dish taste like baby food, but I was totally wrong.My party also got the dinner dessert (there is only 1) and we also quickly devoured it. All I could remember is that it was a good night - food-wise.Highly recommended restaurant!"}, {"review_id": "E0TtU1Hc0OwciscDirQ4xg", "user_id": "-sEy9wAxlN21ytvMF4GrEw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "I had the avocado toast & Australian ice coffee.

The ambiance is super cool, kind of industrial cozy, very cosmopolitan. I started off with a delicious mocha that had very pretty coffee art, then we tried the croissants which were great: flaky, buttery and freshly made that morning, you really could tell. I had the peas and eggs, enticed by the Coppa that was included in this dish and it didn't disappoint. The portion may have been a bit large for my taste, but yummy nonetheless. The mix of watercress, tarragon and poached eggs with the peas and toast was spot on. Filling and well executed. The place was so nice to just have a conversation, we stayed almost 3 hours. Very attentive staff, I'll certainly return"}, {"review_id": "tjicIRjle1Iw0wDKvtb4oQ", "user_id": "wg7BIF9xfgiVNKpaX6QkHg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/8/2017", "text": "I love this place! Having recently moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa from Phoenix - I miss restaurants that are as cool inside as their food is good. We came for breakfast at 10:00 am on a Sunday and only waited 10 minutes. Parking wasn't awful, we found a space in the lot across the street. Inside, the decor is amazing. The style of the building is so on trend point and comfortable. It's an Instagrammers dream! The menu: be still my beating heart!! This menu reminds me of west coast inspired. Avocado and micro greens! I love it! I ordered the Saint and my husband had Full Eggs. We shared from both. They were delicious. Neither of us felt over stuffed and gross, but so satisfied after eating. We each had cups of coffee (no free refills) and I grabbed a chocolate croissant to go (also yummy!) I would guess anything on the menu is A+!Their cocktails looked awesome too, but we had to drive - so sad!Keep it up St Kilda and while you're busy rocking DSM, considering a second location in Cedar Rapids - I beg you!"}, {"review_id": "HhvoFPHxsl45SdERtmFUtg", "user_id": "qE4NWoBRFdEOPdin7g5_nw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Food is great!

The cubano sandwich was delicious- it was tastier than I imagined. The banana bread dish was good, but it wasn't spectacular. I would have preferred it to be a little more moist in consistency. We asked for more sauce, which helped the texture, but not the calories. Definitely a good place to have brunch in Des Moines.

Exposed brick, steel and wooden beams.  Next impressions came from reading the menu.  Call outs like \"Counter Culture coffee,\" \"La Quercia,\" and \"house made jam\" had me eager to order.  The beverages and food that were delivered did not disappoint.  Lattes:  full smooth flavor, just right foam, and foam art for visual interest.Full Eggs:  Those poached eggs were an inspiration to work harder at home to perfect the art of making poached eggs to the level that we experienced at St. Kilda.  All ingredients were top notch quality and absolutely delicious.Country Smashed peas & eggs:  this dish was so pretty with it's smashed pea base. The eggs were cooked just to the point that the yolks were still runny and blended beautifully with the other ingredients and soaked into the toast when the eggs were broken.  The seasonings (I'm kind of in love with tarragon) and the La Quericia Coppa Americana were also stars of this dish.Avocado Toast:  Both the smashed and sliced bits of avocado were ripe without being brown, and mixed well with the other ingredients and the chewy sour dough toast base.St. Kilda, I'm a fan.  People of Des Moines you've got a great treasure in your city."}, {"review_id": "BBv-KTOt5C8NX7O8Gyn70w", "user_id": "S601-21BPZKMSIeS0BJ1gg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/31/2017", "text": "Came here on a Sunday afternoon at 2:00 pm with a group of four. Street parking was totally full as were any of the non-private parking lots around. So parking is a bit of a struggle. We were told we'd have a 20-30 min wait. The arrangement of the restaurant is very unique. There isn't a ton of seating on the \"entry\" level but appeared to be a lot more up the stairs. Once seated, we were given menus and water. Our waitress was immediately very bubbly and helpful, suggesting drinks and taking our drink orders. I opted for the Australian Iced Coffee. I fully admit, the words ice cream in the description locked in that choice for me. Oddly, after ordering our drinks, two of the menus were removed from the table and we hadn't even looked at the food options. Our waitress came back to take our food orders but we weren't ready yet. She did inform us which items they were out of and provided recommendations per our asking. Again, she was helpful. I ordered the Country Smashed Peas and Eggs as I wanted something a bit \"different.\" Others at the table had Avocado Toast and the Homemade Granola. Food came out decently quick. All of the dishes were beautiful to look at. Taste wise, YUM! I really enjoyed my Country Smashed Peas & Eggs. The eggs were done perfectly as was everything else. There were a lot of peas. That's my only small complaint on the food. Maybe a bit less peas. The other ladies really enjoyed their dishes too. The restaurant had mostly emptied out around 3:00 when our waitress's shift was over. We weren't quite done eating at that point and a variety of other servers tended to us. We ended up chatting for a very long time and closed the place down at 5:00. If they'd been busy after we were done eating, we'd have left to allow others to have a seat. But it was nice to be able to stay. One other note, they will only split checks evenly amongst a group so be aware of that and plan ahead. Their bathrooms are nice but almost out of toilet paper and the blowdryer didn't work. There were only two paper towels left too. So the bathroom needed a bit more attention. Overall, a very positive experience and I'd definitely go back."}, {"review_id": "niAkhOTHoWCOdRdNEYr0eQ", "user_id": "qf4Dce4gFbhQF6Q7v0MZTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "I do not have enough good things to say about St. Kilda's!! Wow!!! The food is not only beautiful and photo worthy but it tastes as good as it looks!! That and the staff are phenomenal!! Our server Adrianne was super sweet!!! We stopped in for breakfast and it kept us filled up and full through lunch! They have really good iced coffee actual loose leaf tea, no tea bags here! So glad to get quality tea!!! I ordered The saint breakfast sandwich, first things first their ginger bacon is life!!! It was amazing and so tasty with just a little zip from the ginger. The sausage, fried egg, arugula, avocado, and tomato jam on a sesame seed bun was delicious! So many wonderful flavors! This is the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had!!! My husband ordered the salmon and eggs and it was perfectly cooked! His eggs were just a tad overdone but when the server checked on us she immediately offered to get a new egg. He was happy so it was all good. But the potatoes with the grilled cherry tomatoes had great flavors!!! Overall amazing experience both in service and in the food.

The avocado toast is on a whole new level with the pickled veggies, a poached egg, corn and spices on a sour dough slice of bread. While the grain bowl looked like it wasn't going to be filling it was! It had quinoa, beets, fried egg, couscous and spices.

The place had an industrial design to it and had a decent amount of patrons. The waiter was nice enough and also happened to be the baker. I was saddened to hear the bakery items were all sold out. A couple of us had planned to order a few items to take home but didn't get the chance. The cocktail selection wasn't big but had a mimosa, gin smash, bloody mary, and mojito listed. Each around $8 which was a pretty good deal. I ordered the gin smash and it was very delicious. I opted out of ordering food, but my friends each ordered a sandwich off the menu and both looked very delicious. The offerings are around $9-$12 with $1/$2 for additional toppings. *quick note, the bottom of the menu states they split the bill evenly. I was not a fan of this.I was disappointed the bakery items were sold out. Either the items are really good or they don't make enough batches. The waiter never came back to the table after we received our food. Never asked if we wanted refills, and didn't bother asking how the food was until we had been waiting for the bill for 10-15 minutes. The other waitstaff occasionally stopped by to grab our plates but never said a word to us.
