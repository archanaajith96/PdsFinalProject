I finally got my act together and checked out Bakersfield for dinner. Once I got there & saw the menu, I couldn't shake why everything looked so familiar. Then, I realized that I've been to Bakersfield in Nashville! I had a really good experience there, so I was looking forward to a similar experience. You won't find any street tacos here - catina style 100% We started off with chips, salsa & guac. My favorite was the rojo salsa - nice and smoky. The guac was good, but it's not the best. This is not Bakersfield's fault because I know it's the weird avocados in the midwest. Just trust me, it's not the same as a California avo. Like in Nashville, I got the fish (crispy hake, tabasco lime sauce, citrus slaw, cilantro), hongos (portobello, poblano, fresno, bell pepper, kale slaw, cotija cheese), and huitlacoche (corn truffles, roasted poblano, corn, onion, cotija cheese, cilantro) tacos. I also always pay the extra dollar for house pickled jalapeños. When served, I could immediately see and smell the pungent cotija. Yum. Fish and hongos were great! The huitlacoche was fine - tasty but not as tasty. It's a good vegetarian option though! I think I thought the same exact thing last time in Nashville too. I never learn, ha. My boyfriend got the Cubano Torta (beer braised carnitas, chorizo, red cabbage, black beans, pickled peppers, monterey jack, poblano dijonnaise). He seemed to thoroughly enjoy it and even took the other half home. The sauce it came with was fantastic - it was like a latino spin on a carolina bbq sauce - it was super vinegary and flavorful. We unfortunately had to rush through dinner for an obligation, but the server (in training) was fantastic! She knew the menu well and was a natural. 115/365"}, {"review_id": "SDzRZltv0xds_A5D23WwXQ", "user_id": "LGlk-Zb69sGQwJVu2w4U_Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Friendly service, urban cantina style atmosphere, food okay. Ordered guac, salsa, and chips after waiter said they make all on site every day. Chips were good, guac was nothing special - big chunks of avocado but otherwise kind of bland, salsas were interesting - a mild green and slightly spicy red with a smoky pepper flavor - both are pulsed and not chunky, I kind of missed having a pico de gallo style salsa. Then we ordered 4 tacos - bistec, pollo, portabello, and a special pork carnitas - the portabello was by far the best, the others were meh and all were super small. If you are hungry and haven't eaten an entire basket of chips, you would def need to order 3 a person.I felt the prices were too $ - the tacos are so small and the food is just not all that interesting.

I am so so happy I was recommended by a foodie...in Indy to come to Bakersfield. My team and I got off work and drove to Bakersfield to have some drinks and food. First of all, I love the area, I never thought Indy would look so dope! We had to wait a bit for a table since it was packed, but we were so hungry, we ordered apps and drinks standing outside by the entrance and started going down.The QUESO, let me tell you, is the best queso I've had in my life. I DEVOURED that plate of queso. It was the best thing ever....serioulsy, it was so good. I love the little burnt parts with the chips...perfection!We sat down and grabbed some tacos also and it was also delicious, but I just couldn't get my mind off the queso...so I ordered another round of it!!! Honestly wasn't sure about the Indy food scene...but I will have to say, I had a lot of great food in Indy..!! Definitely recommend Bakersfield and their QUESO!"}, {"review_id": "n5lgszLnZET91olqIW93RA", "user_id": "HXC_WHpkFFLMpi3VCZDvzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Really good Mexican fare, considering the place is named...Bakersfield.I came here on a Saturday night around 6 pm with my parents. We probably waited 20 minutes for our table, not bad at all. They text you when your table is ready, which honestly all restaurants need to start doing.Margaritas - 5/5My mom and I started off with margaritas. She got the original Bakersfield and I got the pineapple with the spicy rim (note: the spicy rim costs $1 extra). These were delicious and refreshing, with just enough of a kick to be interesting but not overwhelming. Chips and queso (plain) - 5/5It's a plate of hot cheese, what more could you want?? We scarfed the whole thing down in like 5 minutes. We got a lot more chips than cheese but we were able to eat some of the extra with their salsas (a green one and a spicy one, both pretty good). They replaced the chips once we ran out, which was nice. Tacos - 4/5Our server recommended 2-3 tacos per person so we ordered a total of 8: 2 fish and 1 each of cochinita pibil, baja shrimp, pollo rojo, short rib, al pastor, and al sesamo (the latter was from their specials menu). My personal favorites were the baja shrimp, short rib, and al sesamo. The pollo rojo and al pastor were a bit on the dry side, so I probably wouldn't get those two again. All in all though, these were solid tacos.Overall, I'd say Bakersfield is probably a 4.5/5, so I'll round up to a 5. Biggest strength would be the margs -- you can't miss out on those!"}, {"review_id": "xVxNeasM2oFeLJ_ybAAQbw", "user_id": "xX140fHVpOOzc1pN4gsjng", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "This is a really fun place to try if you're downtown! It was recommended to me by a friend and I am so glad. Tacos are small so I ordered 3: shrimp, chicken, and beef. The shrimp was my favorite because of the fresh slaw on top. I also love how they come with fresh limes to squeeze on top. My waitress was no where to be found for my drink refill and took a very long time to get my check after I finished. Overall, I'd come back for those tacos and look forward to trying the guacamole. I would not recommend bringing kids here. There's no kids menu (or dessert menu) and the whole set up/seating is more adult-like and less custom to little folks."}, {"review_id": "uKp9seecsLApqbUp9wNoew", "user_id": "5dcB5i6KUBRN7uRJymbdXQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Best margaritas ever!!!My husband and love their Spivey margaritas!

Their food might be just slightly on the pricier side of things ($4 per taco), but 500% totally worth it! My favorite tacos are the short rib and the al pastor tacos- they are both so savory and tasty! The al pastor tacos come with little bits of pineapple on them which bring a great sweet flavor to the meat. Their margaritas are another great staple of this restaurant. Pineapple margarita all the way!! I tried the spicy version of the pineapple marg and I liked it, but I wasn't too crazy about it. I love love love spicy food, but not in my alcohol. The salsa and queso here is TO DIE FOR! The staff here is all extremely nice and very helpful when it comes to asking opinions about their food.

Granted this was on a Thursday- I would guess that it is more crowded on weekends. We ordered chips to start that came with two salsas; one was smoky-hot and the other was more milder fresh tasting. There were a few veggie options, but I went with the papas asadas \"roasted potatoes\" dish that had black beans, avocado, lettuce, and salsa with a cilantro dressing that was very good!

This is an updated review on some of the best tacos on Mass Ave and Indy in general! Now y'all know I started off with the guac because Guac=LIFE, there's is absolutely delicious and is definitely something you should NOT sleep on! I couldn't remember which tacos I ordered on my last trip so this time I chose the Bistec tacos (marinated grilled short rib, chipotle slaw, cilantro) and the Short Rib (braised short rib, queso fresco, crema, white onion, radish, cilantro) I always ask for no onion because they are very heavy handed with them and I also ask to have the slaws on the side because in the case that I don't like it I don't want it to ruin the overall taco experience for me hahaha! But I do add the cotija cheese to any and all tacos because it's such a nice flavorful counterbalance.I absolutely loved the bistec tacos I ate about 2 of them before I had to call it quits so I could get to the short rib taco. The bistec is so unique in flavor because it's very sweet. I'm thinking the marinade has a couple of sweet elements in it but the meat itself is seasoned with savory flavors because the end result tastes like a battle between the two. But in comes the crema which is not paired with this particular taco but adds a light and fresh layer to act as a mediator to the sweet and savory war on your taste buds. Sorry that was a bit of Food Network dramatics hahaha! Either way the taco is DAMN good!Now the short rib was not a real contender on this trip. Maybe it was because I got to it last and it was sitting for a bit but it was a bit dry and there was way too much meat for the tortilla. So I did end up asking our wonderful waitress to take it off of my bill because I did not enjoy nor finish it.This trip also had a BOOZY ADVENTURE! They have a delightful version of a Paloma on their menu and if you know me at all you know anything Paloma related is getting tried by me! Their Paloma had Herradura Reposado, fresh lime juice, agave nectar, grapefruit bitters and Jarritos Grapefruit soda. It was very light and refreshing! It was a well crafted drink and I was able to drink it without having that blast of alcohol punching me in the face. It was sweet and limey and overall a wonderful choice for an afternoon lunch!"}, {"review_id": "Oxh3HsfXdHnKIdRwZ61qvQ", "user_id": "h7i2y-jc52oEgtI2zU8IwQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I haven't eaten here in a hot second, but we had a mess of margarita pitchers last night and they were magnificent!

It's a bit over-priced and not filling.  I have visited lots of taqueria's in Indiana and I have had tastier and CHEAPER tacos for $2-3.  If you want a great atmosphere and service - I say Bakersfield is for you.If you want great food at a reasonable price - Look elsewhere - such as Carneceria Guanajuato, Pancho's, Super tortas, and Tamale place.Food: 3/5Service: 4/5Ambiance: 3.5/5"}, {"review_id": "Vmnah1Ql-h33YVSj-4sXzg", "user_id": "AQGMTHae70n3MnONotAuYQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/8/2017", "text": "After having a little too much fun at Yelp's Totally Bazaar, the #YelpLouINvaders needed some sustenance before hitting the road back to the Ville.
