Cool vibe and great outdoor seating for when the weather is nice. The menu has a great range of options - from veg to pulled pork to salads there is something for everyone. I tried the panko chicken sandwich which had balsamic marinated tomatoes and blue cheese - it was quite good and very large! I only could eat half and took the other half home. I tried the special side which was mashed sweet potato (reminded me of thanksgiving sweet potato casserole ) Overall will definitely come back for a casual but tasty meal!"}, {"review_id": "n_xG_47Lrb6y3c8eHy6-cw", "user_id": "8AFBfU1B1EJ9Ne9eDxVe3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "This is one of my favorite places to chomp down on good food when visiting my parents in Jacksonville. They offer lots of delicious vegetarian and vegan options as well as yummy foods for my meat eating hubby!The atmosphere has a cool, relaxing vibe and the tunes are groovy! The last time we were there, they were playing 70's music - not disco, but really good 70's tunes!My favorite meal there has been the \"Change Up\" which is a marinated, grilled portobello sandwich with goat cheese and pesto. I'm drooling just thinking about it! My husband really loves the Korean BBQ Chicken Satay. I tasted the kimchi that comes with it and it's sooooo good! The staff is always great as well.

We tried the Waldorf salad and a burger special. I was  a bit surprised that the burger was breaded and deep fried on the special but it turned out tasty. I always love a fried egg on a burger. The bun was really fresh.  The meat was juicy and cooked really well.  The Brussels sprout side was outstanding.   The chicken on the Waldorf salad was cooked really well and all greens were fresh.  Staff was very friendly and portions were large.  I was not a huge fan of the plastic cutlery and paper plates."}, {"review_id": "pP1i66NLbYxo3oJV4L4ZhA", "user_id": "Ts9XlorVNAYykZpdapAtpQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Before I went to yoga class, I noticed a bunch of people sitting outside next door and realized it was the new location of Chomp Chomp. I kept that in the back of my mind for dinner options after yoga. I dropped my stuff in the car and quickly ran back across the street. It was a nice evening, so several people were sitting outside at tables. I was able to walk in and place my to -go order immediately. I chose the banh mi sandwich, which comes either with pork or vegetarian, and a side of homemade chips. The man who took my order asked if I would like a glass of water while I waited, which I accepted gladly. I was surprised when he brought me a full sized styrofoam cup of water; how nice! I didn't have to wait long for my order, and they made sure I had everything needed before I left such as silverware and napkins. You will need napkins for that sandwich because it can get messy, but it is delicious and full of spice. The chips were still crunchy by the time I arrived home, and I munched on those between bites of sandwich. The food is fresh, and the atmosphere is chill!"}, {"review_id": "kWat-piOzLVuVU7h--dBPw", "user_id": "syc0AhTzma0s1EMKQ9V8mQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Wonderful, fast-delivered food.

I asked my friend Nate Watson for some dinner dining places to go and he suggested this place, so-Ernie, Autumn and I went. They are now located in the Herschel area(Westside). We went on a crazy busy Friday night. We all sat down at the bar to check out the menu and decided to stay at the counter to dine. I had the most wonderful salad I've ever consumed! Ernie & Autumn had the burgers and fries. We really liked the place, the service, food and the other customers were great as well. I can't wait to return. I would recommend to anyone!

One of my favorites is a very simple Cobb Salad which they take to new heights with their ingredients, particularly the marinated tomatoes and cucumbers. I am not a huge cucumber fan, but these I could eat every day. Small upgrades to normal cobb salad ingredients are what put this dish over the top. My dining partner also chose wells d got the Panko Chicken, which she loved and she also said she loved the marinated tomatoes in her side salad. See, great minds must think alike. Really an upgrade from the other location."}, {"review_id": "MoT2XjHVhcrPEqILX77fPg", "user_id": "xZIM6TJDWPYh1M9grlMR3A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Decided to give them another try! The order was correct with no issues. This time my only complaint was the dislike in food itself. Didn't care for the bbq pulled pork sandwich w fried green tomato. I usually love all these.

I liked it, I liked it a lot! Stopped in for lunch and tried the Disco fries (which I loved!), the Westsider (my friend and I aren't curry chip fans, but we see what their intentions are!), and the Korean BBQ! All of the above was pretty good and I love that their meat is juicy and tender. The service was great and very attentive! The outside seating area is pretty cute, but the heat was unbearable and we decided to save our lives and sit inside. Chomp Chomp is quite small inside, but we were comfortable.

It was weird at first because i did not know it worked like a sit down restaurant. The waitresses were very helpful in pointing me in the right direction. The menu was different. I had trouble reading the food names but i was able to disect the meald by reading the descriptions. The only reason i did not give a 5 star review is because i thought the prices were a little high for your average person.

Yeah, that pretty well describes Chomp Chomp. It's located in the Riverside area close to Fishweir Creek adjacent to Avondale. Chomp Chomp offers sheltered outdoor seating w/fans and indoor seating at the bar and a few tables and booths around the corner. It's a simple kind of place. No frills. Like I said, kind of a dive. However, in its simplicity you'll probably find it's comfortable too.The menu isn't huge, just a single page to explore but, all the options are delicious.The food is pretty dang good. A few of my faves are the Philadelphia Experiment, I love cream cheese! The burgers are thick and tasty. However, my new fixation is the Panko-crusted chicken sandwich with gorgonzola cheese and balsamic-marinated tomatoes. If you love caprese-type things this is the one to get.The disco fries are CC's version of loaded fries, but oh-so different and definitely good. Well worth a few dollars more to get them. I've never had a bad meal from there, but they're not perfect. I recently ate there for lunch with someone who ordered the Waldorf and even though it was advertised on the menu as having green apple slices there weren't any in the salad. ZERO. NOT A ONE. The dressing was too strong and the vegetables tasted like they were pickled. The chicken was cooked perfectly but overall, a disappointment.Their sweet tea definitely lives up to its name. Sweet indeed. I love it! They also have beer and wine if you'd like something slightly stronger. Food is affordable ($9 avg.) and portions are definitely enough to satisfy. Chomp Chomp offers new takes on traditional dishes while creating new mouth-watering menu items. Lunch or dinner, it's a good bet to get a good bite."}, {"review_id": "24n2SMkB9eAEGVIvfFowKQ", "user_id": "2W6arbuaN0_PoqoGhbpCBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Chomp Chomp might be my favorite local place to eat in Jax.

The food was pretty good, though, and although I wasn't absolutely blown away, I have a feeling that was because I just ordered the wrong item for my personal preferences.The dish that I tried, the KBBQ Chicken Satay, had a very unique flavor that I've never tasted anywhere else. There's a sour tang to it that's reflective of kimchi and a slight smoky flavor as well. I won't say that I really enjoyed it, but I didn't dislike it, either. It was just unique. The chicken itself was tender and tasty, and the brown rice that came with the dish complimented it well.Service was friendly, and the environment was small and a little bit run down, albeit colorful. We were seated outside because there was no room left inside, but one of the employees turned on an outdoor heater to fight the cold a little.Overall, Chomp Chomp seems to be more well known for its sandwiches, so next time I drop by, I'll probably want to try the Banh Mi or the Panko-Crusted Chicken. The entire experience wasn't bad at all, though."}, {"review_id": "cOyBvSjavCSv9dikkx9Ohg", "user_id": "V0g7S9F1dkHHN3eURF1eEg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/21/2017", "text": "This is a nice little hamburger place over on Hershell Street just a little north of San Juan.
