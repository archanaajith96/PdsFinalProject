The place had a good atmosphere and the service was excellent, our waiter was on top of it. I had the Dank IPA which was pretty tasty with the Tommy Gun pizza (sans ham). I really enjoyed it, the crust was good, the toppings plentiful (bacon was super meaty) and it all had good flavors. My mom had the Amun-Ra pizza which was also tasty, good BBQ sauce w/ a touch of spice from the jalapeños, quite yummy! All in all it was a nice experience, I will definitely be back as they have a huge menu with tons of stuff to try.Also saw they have a brunch menu with bottomless mimosas.... yes please!!!"}, {"review_id": "-HZp_SC1XuBeuRsJVENbtw", "user_id": "4wlGwgQWCYa4AxnYdAEoHw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "This is one of the first restaurants we discovered when we moved to Colorado. The food is excellent. Their craft beer is so good that we always bring some home. The music is great and the servers are fun! I appreciate knowing the servers like their job. Also, despite the music and business, we can always have a comfortable conversation while we are at Dad and Dude's.Not only is the service great but the servers make the whole experience more enjoyable. We were treated like royalty when we spent the evening of our 25th anniversary there!I cannot recommend a better pizza and beer place in the area!"}, {"review_id": "BrAYe5gupRdyCCHTrpm0Yg", "user_id": "Vct3Mzq4e7DVfxZMp03GCg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/15/2017", "text": "Our waitress was friendly. We had their pizza, fries, and onion rings, and two beers and all were lacking in flavor. For beer reference- the ones we had were the Dank IPA and some pineapple one- not very impressive.

I also had their personal pizzas, brick oven baked, so good. My husband had one of their burgers with carmelized onions, melted cheese dripping ok n the sides, it was towering. Their side of fries are fresh cut too. This was a random stop for us bc we were driving by and hadnt tried this place yet.

All breweries should serve their hoppy beer with a garnish of hops. The pizza dough made from spent beer grain is so dang good! They also have some of the best chicken nuggets I've ever had.

A middle of the road restaurant. We had the Prohibition Pizza and substituted roasted red peppers for green peppers. It was good, but nothing to rave about when it comes to pizza. The Bloody Mary's are good and a steal at $3 each. A must have. They come garnished with a mozzarella cheese cube, green olive, celery stalk, carrot stick, banana pepper, and lime wedge."}, {"review_id": "dI4wPnHJhuUynxYSp8uk7Q", "user_id": "u_l9-A82l69-bFPDnjK_CA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "The beer here is SUPER good, and the food we got was eh, not bad not fabulous. I mean its bar food.... But the reason its 3 stars instead of 4 is because of the service. 1. They were out of 2 of their beers, which was a bummer and seemed strange as it was a Friday at 6pm. 2. i ordered the flight and all the pictures on yelp (and via friends) show the beer served with blueberries in it, or other toppings in the other beers. When my beer showed up I was disappointed that none of them had these toppers... I asked about it and was answered with a snarky \"Of course you want the blueberries...\" Not very friendly or accommodating....I'd come back for the beer and ask for my toppings so i don't get jipped or a snarky remark."}, {"review_id": "7EhhDeBC64k1mtLThIbKZQ", "user_id": "i-y2-MbdJebSaTKmY1QxHw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/26/2017", "text": "Didn't love, didn't hate. Very so so. I came here for a late lunch with a mate and my hubby met us for drinks also. Our server was great, really friendly. The meals were enormous, I had a pulled pork sandwich and my mate had sliders and dude fries. There was sooo much food! I didn't love the flavour of the pulled pork but it still went down alright. My mate got a flight of beers and got all flavoured ones, like lemongrass, blueberry, toffee stout and pineapple. Didn't like any of them. Our server did offer to take them back and get him something else but he declined and struggled through them. He loved the cider though and my hubby enjoyed the blond beer."}, {"review_id": "YkWvPGr10BGK4NnXcRxIYw", "user_id": "f1ZvgkbtVfo-fQ27A0QNBw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "This place was okay. The service was a little slow at 1:30pm on a Monday.

I usually try new places rather than go to the same places over and over again, but this is my exception. The place has a rustic feel and the brews are good. Tonight I had the pineapple express beer and could actually taste the pineapple in it. Yum!Definately try their artisian pizzas because they are all unique and delicious!The reason I knocked off one star: the music echoed with other customers and was loud. Also service was slow for the first 20 mins. It would also be nice if they had an all-encompassing beer and wine menu."}, {"review_id": "rfCl4EdBHSVS2UYqRaligg", "user_id": "DxD9RHIWdtQB13JP-PrMkA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "YES bring on the gluten free carbs!  Little pricey, but they do a fantastic job with gluten free pizza crust, pasta and bread.

Food was great but the crust wasn't crispy enough Needs to cook more. Best part of the pizza was it has so much meat. I was surprised. Usually, I complain about not having enough toppings but this one was overwhelming. Ordered tommy gun. Replace onion n olive with pineapple. The beer was good. But service sucks! Took forever for the beer to come n to get our order.
