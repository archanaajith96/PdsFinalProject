Of the two times we came here, I ordered french toast the first time and eggs benedict the second, and my husband built his own omelet both times. We were entranced. For me to be able to eat french toast AND eggs benedict--GLUTEN FREE--is a big deal. We got the home fries as our sides and they are absolutely delightful as well.Not only is the food great, the service is excellent as well. Everyone is very friendly and accommodating (especially waiter Alex), and we usually get seated in record time."}, {"review_id": "hQO7y1GbpaNPumF1_4ChfA", "user_id": "9HWixYqoBfdgzpp9z5yoSg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Really enjoyed the food at this place.  Although somewhat small and crowded, the food was plentiful and delicious.When I get to Colorado, I look for an excuse to put pork green chili on anything that makes sense.  Burritos, omelettes, fries.  Fortunately, this place had a breakfast burrito already smothered in it...SOLD!But before the burrito, as a breakfast \"appetizer,\" I tried something called \"Ebelskivers,\" which I had never heard of before.  Glad I did.  They were light, fluffy balls of deliciousness with a hint of bacon/cheddar, but enhanced by powdered sugar and a little maple syrup.  One star downgrade on cleanliness though.  They were busy, for sure and possibly short-staffed, but the dark floors showed the food spills too much...otherwise, this would be a solid 4-star rating.But, if you don't mind a diner-like appeal with lots of people and good food, it's a nice stop."}, {"review_id": "C21YNLtgtrQnsIN6IHmftA", "user_id": "ACj2xP1qvmJEtAu9umPRBA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "This place is way too small and the hostess was rude...not necessarily to me but to the nice waitress who didn't do anything wrong. I asked the waitress (who was the first person I saw when I stepped inside) if the seats at the bar were open and she said \"yeah give me just a second\" so then I was approached by the hostess who is barely recognizable as an employee by the way.....I said \"I just asked her if the seats at the bar are open and she said yeah give me just a second\"....then the hostess proceeded to chastise the waitress in front of multiple patrons saying no those seats aren't available. Not professional! Then she looked at me and said \"she's new\".....so not cool!!! I was so close to leaving and going somewhere else. There is literally no sign that says \"wait to be seated\" so you have no idea if it's open seating or what you're supposed to do...Ended up getting put on a waiting list and had to wait in the ridiculously tiny waiting area while staring at people eating....food was just ok.

If the name of the restaurant doesn't already suggest their specialty, let me tell you, Three Little Griddles is all about their griddles/pancakes. I got the savory veggie griddle, which includes jalapeños, avocado, tomato, onion, mushroom, and of course a cheese filled center. It's just one pancake, but the one is the size of an entire entree plate. The pancake had a crispy outer layer, coated with parmesan and a warm soft center with all of the savory ingredients. As a side, I also got the ebelskivers with a lemon fill. I was much more excited to try from seeing pictures, but was a bit disappointed. It was literally just a pancake rolled into a ball without much of a filling. It's a smaller place, so even arriving at 9 am there was a 25 minute wait."}, {"review_id": "Von-jhkYKXRF00QwfpHDdw", "user_id": "T1CUbOQG56bcJwNJPztfqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "I love this place. The food is everything I look for in breakfast food and the host (a cute looking asian gentleman - I wish I knew his name as I see him almost every weekend) is the one of the highlights of my visit. He is very warm and inviting and excellent at his job. There are some cons to this place. For example, its small, and in my opinion, they should expand, however, I only go on the weekends and I am unsure if they are as busy during the week. So as a fellow business owner, I can see that it may not be feasible to expand. Another con is that the staff tend to yell at one another and berate one another in front of paying customers and to me, that is completely unprofessional. Despite these two cons - its not enough to give this place anything but 5 stars. As the food is great and I can tell people love it here."}, {"review_id": "SfzYw85UuOO6KKxrPiJgJg", "user_id": "rVznCBIhqQQK6uxdxhPztA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "This little hole in the wall packs a lot of flavor!

Great place and was busy. Great staff, very welcoming. Recommended the Shrimp and Grits with Pork Belly. The chef is from New Orleans and her food shows it. Perfectly cooked shrimp and grits. Pork belly was delicious and was tender. The spice was perfect. Love the kick in my mouth. Great recommendations all around. I felt like I was having a home cooked meal. If you live in the area stop on down and enjoy some unique and deliciously made to order food. Come down to see Rajon and the staff here. They will make it a wonderful experience! Oh, the coffee is locally sourced and fresh of the pot!"}, {"review_id": "WQyayxQQF_LU1yq0g6ejPg", "user_id": "uKVLVMY7mBN-kiYeeXSNrA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/24/2017", "text": "Atmosphere: casualFood: 2/5Service: 3/5I was excited that there were brunch places open for Christmas eve because I am not one that knows how to cook. Three Little Griddles is in the Southlands shopping center and is easily missed if you don't know know where it is. We came in at 12:30 and we were seated immediately.They're menu is laminated double sided page and an additional page of specials. Immediately, shrimp and grits caught my eye and the server confirmed that it was one of their top sellers. Sold, don't have to tell me twice. My friend decided to order the corned pork hash. The moment the dishes came out, the shrimp and grits smelled delightful and unfortunately that is where good news ends. The dish was over seasoned; it was salty, spicy, and quite frankly, overwhelming. Honestly, the seasoning could've been ok if there were more grits but there were hardly any. My friend's corned pork hash looked like strips of pork and large cuts of potatoes. It was not visually appealing and she said it didn't taste great either. Overall: I really wasn't impressed with their dishes but maybe that's what we get for not ordering griddles at a restaurant that has \"griddles\" in its name. I was hoping to catch up with my friend longer but they started closing up shop around 1:15. It was a little awkward but it was on me for not picking somewhere that was open later."}, {"review_id": "2GRNAtsqmpxmk5-y9TOcUg", "user_id": "XlrhaNv4cvc4y5_X7QZgBg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/23/2017", "text": "I've been wanting to check out Three Little Griddles for what seems like forever! This past Sunday the BF and I stopped in to get our brunch on and let me tell you: it was fabulous!Three Little Griddles is located in a strip mall area near Southlands. So the space is fairly small and fills up quick! We arrived toward the tail end of the brunch hours (close to 12:30) and were seated immediately. Absolutely love it when there's not a wait. We browsed the menu and made our meal choices. The BF wanted to try the TLG quiche, but unfortunately they were out (they warn you on the menu that once it's out, it's out!); so he went for his backup order of the traditional eggs benedict. I opted for the carnitas benedict special. Mmm... The carnitas benedict was so good! Def ranks in my top ten benedicts! It had a black bean salsa on it and just the right amount of spice. Plus the carnitas was perfectly tender. Both our meals came with home fries which are traditionally seasoned breakfast potatoes, cut like french fries. Everything was perfectly delish!Our server was very attentive, without being over bearing, and ensured that our glasses were never empty. Sadly they do not serve those boozy brunch classics here like Bloody Mary's or Mimosas. Oh well. They do feature Dazbog coffees and some teas!I know that we will be back to sample some more the Three Little Griddles has to offer; like the quiche, the breakfast burrito, the ebelskivers, and the griddle cakes! Let's just say that I can hardly wait! #brunchlife"}, {"review_id": "2mDGm6wnH-eJgeY6-p_Asw", "user_id": "DxD9RHIWdtQB13JP-PrMkA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "Yummmm!

We arrived about 7.50am and there was no wait. Gabriel was our waiter, very friendly. I ordered the special griddle cakes - blueberry with a lemon cream, my hubby had a build your own omelette and then we had some of the fancy doughnut holes with lemon curd to share. Everything tasted great and we were served within about 15 minutes of being seated. The doughnut holes took a little longer but they were absolutely worth the wait! They were so hot that the lemon curd started to soak into them. All up including a coffee and a juice, it came to about $32 before top. Pretty good!!

Great location, excellent food (once you actually get to order it and get it), but horrible service. I'm not sure if it's cause they don't realize they are busy so they understaff or they are making up for the times they aren't busy by keeping it at like two servers on any given day. Anyhow if you have at least a hour and a half then stop by. It's worth the wait but if you don't have all day then go to another restaurant.
