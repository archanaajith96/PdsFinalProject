Was not disappointed.  Place was full so seating was tight. But the ramen dishes were huge and delicious. Price for each was in the $7 range so probably the cheapest thing on that stretch of road. You'll have to hunt public parking at peak hours since there are a lot of restaurants there. But I don't count that against them since it's not at all their fault. Just be aware. Will definitely be back though and I definitely recommend."}, {"review_id": "dSYqrLLOkbtTlray-viTNQ", "user_id": "gGzBybf-hQAyPTl71bf5UQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "It was freezing and we wanted hot soup after a late meeting. Ramen was an obvious choice. You walk in and order at the counter before being seated. The smells of yum hit you right at the door. They have a great soy based veggie broth. I wish there were more veggie options though. I got the spicy veggie broth with yellow noodles and veggies. I asked for my noodles firm...a personal preference. The ramen was cooked perfectly and the broth was delicious. I just wish I had more veggies in my bowl. They didn't have any of the usual raman spot condiments on the tables.  I'm sure I could have asked for some, but I didn't bother. Everything tasted amazing without additions. I'll definitely visit this spot again in the future."}, {"review_id": "lCohz3zH2f2nuUkXTscT-A", "user_id": "MTR_2jTOL77u6clGXRM9ow", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "Pros: ramen served is delicious, menu items are at affordable price points, intimate atmosphere in the middle of busy Gervais street.Cons: it's the ONLY ramen-based restaurant in all of Columbia/Richland County region so it's always busy no matter what (or maybe it's just my luck the few times I've gone, it's always packed), the menu is simplistic and limited so there's not a lot of variety in customization or anything that stands out, and because of the busy wait times, service can get slow at times from ringing you up at the cash register to clearing tables off when you are done with your meal."}, {"review_id": "F85F9pQF85Rv7K6pdlFhgA", "user_id": "Q98mdmo_U1LtWJeRiOJQfw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "When the bar closes where does everyone go to soak it up? The ramen house of course! Spicy ramen had a tinge of spice but wasn't overwhelming. \"To go\" containers and chopsticks are self serve which I loved. Noodles al dente. No complaints here!

Sadly it is one of the very few places in Columbia to get ramen. The noodles were decent but besides that everything else in my bowl was a disappointment. The broth was one note and lacked any depth at all. Traditional ramen broth is rich but this stuff tasted like it was store bought. The pork they use for the ramen is all wrong. Mine seemed to be slices of pork tenderloin and was too chewy. Come on!!! Where is the tender pork belly that is suppose to be in Chashu ramen? Why this place is so popular beats me. Since it is so close to USC I sure they draw in the college crowd who is looking to upgrade from their normal top ramen dorm room meals."}, {"review_id": "FMwW2N_V3WDxGeQopA0gmQ", "user_id": "VCMHMRBTv1MJkODyzgSh2w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "This is about as close to Japan I'll get.

The flavor of the shoyu ramen is good and the vegetables that come with it really makes it light. The noodles aren't that great though as they don't have a snap to it.

(California)If you call some thing a salmon rice ball \"おにぎり\" should have a respectable amount of salmon. If as a business you can not afford to include a decent amount of salmon please remove the item from the menu because people like will notice and become upset. I would add that the ramen is at a great price point for what it is and was tasty but the RICE filled salmon rice ball was a slap in the face to traditional onigiri and the owners know this.

Meals are always cheap and delicious. I used to always get the spicy ramen (has a nice kick!), but recently I've been ordering the beef curry. Soooo delicious, soft rice and flavorful curry. Only complaint about it is that the beef is pretty tough, but I would still eat it any day. The spicy ramen itself is super flavorful as well. Egg is marinated and tasty and meat falls apart in your mouth. I tried the salmon rice ball and it was kind of bland, but not bad dipped in some soy sauce.

The stock as great flavor, and the ingredients are all well seasoned. I got the spicy ramen and substituted the pork for chicken. It was the perfect amount of spicy for me. My husband wanted it a bit more so he asked for some chili and they gave it to him no questions. The service was fast and polite.

My expectations were set high because of the reviews. As I walked in, I felt like I was in NYC because of there being a residential staircase to the right. It felt exactly like that, too... a hole in the wall with decent food. It could use a little updated decor and some tlc. I noticed how dirty the door was to the kitchen, as I sat there waiting for my soup but whatever! With a little a bit of windex, this place would be equally as enjoyable as it's soup, right? So, I ordered the spicy ramen and my friend ordered the miso ramen. Both of which were pretty good, but after a while, I was over the flavor and ready for a to-go box. The shumai was delicious though!

They brought out a giant caldron of steaming hot ramen and I was like a kid on Christmas morning. Just let me at it all. Then I tasted it. What an absolute let down. The broth is spicy, but the flavor is uninspired. There is none of that addictive quality that you get from other restaurants. It's just not there. The noodles..not fresh at all. I put it in the league with the kind you by at the grocery. I expected homemade noodles. I expected to be blown away by the flavor. None of that happened.Add to that the subpar service and I left a defeated, destroyed man."}, {"review_id": "fgW4PHP5q8_nC5RTBc5KEQ", "user_id": "4i9aHQEtlboroGub-4knnQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/23/2017", "text": "Very good Ramen soup made just right.
