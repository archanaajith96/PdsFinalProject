I absolutely loved the place. Note the past tense.We spent a weekend in Charleston with another couple at the end of March. We got into the airport right around dinner time and I STRONGLY suggested we go to Nigel's for dinner. Truth be told, I was sorry I did. I ordered an old standby -- the fried green tomatoes -- and the seafood platter.  Not entirely sure what happened, but the food was nowhere near as good as it had been. The grits on which the fried green tomatoes were served were thin and the dish was missing the advertised black-eyed pea and corn relish. The seafood on the platter was correctly prepared, but the sides -- once a real strength -- were rather pedestrian.We went to Nigel's because I raved about it. I am sure the other couple thinks I've lost my culinary mind."}, {"review_id": "wFOyvgSs8hxXnqNMeZtUiA", "user_id": "zox0bzk1LvmLb77fmcRjUQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "The name of this place is 100% accurate... or maybe should even be changed to Nigel's GREAT Food! Every single thing I had here was phenomenal. This spot will definitely be one that gets visited each time I'm in Charleston. Parking was easy since this location is within a shopping plaza. The outside is nothing special but don't let that deter you from going inside. Upon entering, we were greeted and seated immediately, which was nice. The place is on the smaller side, so I could see them getting crowded fast. For starters, I went with the Geechie wings. The wings were fried to perfection and the Geechie sauce was perfect. These were definitely some of the best wings I've ever had. After having the wings, I didn't think the meal could compare. I was wrong. I ordered the Cajun pick 3 platter with whiting, scallops, a crab cake, fried cabbage, and collards. Every item here was amazing as well. The only disappointing part of the meal was looking down and seeing it was all gone. I had to go ahead and purchase a bottle of the Geechie sauce for myself. I can't wait to go back."}, {"review_id": "745vNBynln_FBqcG17jX8w", "user_id": "uJdghQ7f8snapKrYxfZidQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "Really enjoyed the food.

Great food at reasonable prices. The restaurant itself is small and not real for frills, but who needs that for soul food?! I was bummed bc I wasn't feeling that great so the foodie in me was disappointed that I was limited in my choices to not hurt my sensitive stomach so I stuck with starches but snuck a few bites of my husband's choices. I got the mashed potatoes with brown gravy and corn. Corn wasn't anything special. Husband got country fried steak, Mac n cheese, fried cabbage and we got the geechie wings as an app since it was recommended by so many on travel sites, friends and our server. They were great! Spicy and sweet! Give Nigel's a shot! You won't regret it."}, {"review_id": "tWS2okpPY__R48yxEHPK9A", "user_id": "lWOjMHX5qkIa1frJhEy7gw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "So far, I have only been here once, but I enjoyed it.My mother & I stopped in for lunch one day.

It has outstanding southern aka soul food. There are meat and three dishes for ten dollars that can read a small army. There are also entrees with lots of southern favorites like fried green tomatoes, shrimp or salmon grits, a ravioli with collards in a cream sauce. The fried chicken were delish! My favorite was the pork chops. Perfectly seasoned. The cornbread was a perfect sweetness. The lemon homemade tea is as southern as it gets. Amazing service and stick to your bones southern fare!"}, {"review_id": "A5VlmZhiEEI8G6TuaSsv3g", "user_id": "BBdRlIK_eeFhdl4EL1pLAw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/20/2017", "text": "Some of the BEST Soul Food I've ever tasted. The only better; my Moms of course.Visiting my boy during the week at his Navy Nuke School had one major draw-back.  He was in class in class ALL day and into the early evening, leaving the wife and I to fend and find decent places to have a late lunch (dinner, not supper...Yes, here in the south and they have both).  I had the wife check out local places with high reviews via the Yelp app and she came across Nigel's.Nigel's is located at the the end of a small strip mall and the area leading into the area had me question both my safety and the accuracy of all the great reviews I read.  But, we trekked forward and went inside anyway.  Once in the door, we were greeted and seated immediately.  Shortly after, we were offered drinks, menus and told about the specials.  Since the wife and couldn't decide on appetizers, we opted for their sampler plate.  It included: hush puppies, red beans & rice, Mac & cheese and a side or their chicken wings.  I don't recall what the wife had as her main dish but, I ordered grits with shrimp which came with two sides.  The sides were: cabbage and collar greens.My Synopsis:Cons:The only thing worth mentioning besides what I mentioned above is:- Nigel's interior is dark and bleak.  I had trouble reading the menu and seeing if the beer in my bottle had reached bottom.Pros:- Besides the food being outstanding.  They have REAL sweet tea.  The kind that sits all day in the sun to make it just right.    If your in the Goose Creek area of SC, Nigel's has Amazing food and great, Southern hospitality (customer service).  The place is a winner."}, {"review_id": "RC7yXkS__g5YaUILHQZDxA", "user_id": "bevgDqyamCJkBkJNIAzFDg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "This place is divey, hot, and dark.... so don't come here for ambience.

I had a flight to catch and didn't want to pay the ludicrous prices for food at the airport.

It's not exactly the best for anyone watching calories but I don't think most southern places are for calorie watchers!I was promptly greeted and provided my drink of choice. The oyster po'boy intrigued me the most. I ordered it with a side of collard greens instead of fries. The oysters were lightly battered and perfectly fried! It was juicy and not slimy.

This is Soul Food done right.  The same idea you get when you think of Southern down home cooking like fried chicken, collards and mac and cheese.  Instead it is more Lowcountry inspired with shrimp, fish and crab with the other Southern staples as well. The Geechie wings are a must order.  Sometimes if I find myself up their way I will just pick up a to-go order of them they are so good.If you find yourself in the neighborhood of Nigel's make sure you dedicate some time and stop in, you will not be disappointed, just make sure you are hungry because they don't skimp on the portions."}, {"review_id": "jU5jzxTfBc4u0vWg7tCVbQ", "user_id": "YZZaaZGdZ08L1h3XWPrwJw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/30/2017", "text": "I took a star off because they only offer one veggie that doesn't have meat in it and that's peas and carrots.
