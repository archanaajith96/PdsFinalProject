Not only are they extraordinarily legit tacos, in the Tiajuana style (as noted on posters in the restaurant), but added bonus: open 24 hours on Fridays and Saturdays!! Almost too good to be true, I know!When you order, you choose your meat type(s), get in line, and order a taco, quesadilla, vampiro, or mulita with that meat(s). I'm still working out how to place the perfect order, and how best to get the food I ordered (what if I want all the meats? and all the food types? multiple combinations?? It's confusing and overwhelming but very worth it.)I ordered solely from the pastor line (sad sorry hipster tastes, guilty as charged), and I got 2 tacos and 1 mulita (soft corn tortillas grilled with cheese & meat - like a quesadilla, but gluten free (well, close enough for me) and crispier than a 'dilla!). This was more than enough food for one person (my size) and came to ~$9. Based on the fact that I only ordered from one line, the ordering, food pickup, and payment process was quite easy.Can't wait to get back (I'm going tonight tbqh); also worth checking out if your done line dancing at The Westerner, which is only a couple miles down the street on Redwood Road; also in the same neighborhood as one of my favorite pho places - Pho Bien Hoa. Quite the neighborhood!

To see our comprehensive review of Taco Places in Salt Lake City visit TheTacoTourist.com or our Facebook page at facebook.com/The-Taco-To…Recommended by ShayeSuper authentic feel. Yellow building out front. The set-up is f'ing awesome.Mike: Pastor & Lengua. Lengua was so good, I went and bought everyone an extra taco (Lengua). Paster was super good as well. Cut straight from the spiff. Salsa bar was awesome as well. Gregg: Asada, Pastor, LenguaPastor was the best. It was most flavorful. He really liked how tender the lengua was though.Nikhil: Pastor, Asada, LenguaPastor was the best. 'It was the only one that had flavor. The Asada was a bit fatty and did not have a lot of flavor. I really liked the smokiness of the lengua. The texture was something I would have to get used to.Johnny: Pastor x2 which was recommended as their best taco. Liked the flavor, it had just a hint of spicey, but not too much. AJ: Asada- It was a little dry, so she put green salsa on it...which she never does...but she actually loved the green salsa. OverallNikhil: Authentic Mexican. You come here for the food, not the atmosphere. Overall: 2 tacosJohnny: Pretty Good Overall: 3 tacosGregg: It was good. You don't come here for atmosphere Overall: 2.5 tacosMike: Overall: 4 tacosAJ: You need to wear pants so you don't get bitten by the seat Overall: 3 tacos*Nikhil was of the impression that they raised the price for Cinco de Mayo**I got the stinky eye for filming the lady while she cooked. ***I got a really mean look from the lady that was cooking our tacos when I photographed her. Perhaps she is in the witness protection program. ***Bathrooms were not clean."}, {"review_id": "THBFjQ-8CvUiRqnokhrBBA", "user_id": "JS285gFQGMvoE01HNipytA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "We came late on a Saturday and it was packed with people. It was quite hot in here, and waiting for 10 mins to order and then 10 mins to pay wasn't exactly pleasant. The food cooled down by the time we were able to sit down and eat (which we went to our car due to no seating and it was just too hot)However, the food was pretty good. We might come back when we know there's less people to avoid the wait since getting different types requires standing in a separate line. We didn't think waiting 4 different times for 4 different tacos was feasible on our first visit."}, {"review_id": "4FlhLOR07NyLn816XbLxvQ", "user_id": "bOKqYfjA6dM6ZP_nwXkmFQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "Love, love, LOVE their tacos.  My first time here I had a difficult time deciding which line I wanted to proceed with since everything looked so great.  I considered  myself lucky the day I visited this place because all my girlfriends were able to join me and all who have visited this establishment before. The line moves along pretty quickly which is nice for those who are on a time crunch.  What really stands out here vs. other establishments are the condiments! Here they serve grilled onions which Is a first for me.  Side note- they are tasty!  As far as salsa goes- many claim to be spicy but really are more a let down but the salsas here actually have kick.  I try to focus on the meat and have that front and center as that is the main ingredient but I couldn't help but smother my tacos with grilled onions and salsa because IT WAS THAT GOOD. If you want fast, inexpensive and quality tacos I suggest you visit this place and soon.  As a first timer I'm already hooked. You are doing yourself a disservice if you haven't checked this place out already!"}, {"review_id": "mu6DDd_2HQ9wjsfn0i7WfQ", "user_id": "EzCWIXl2SttlhvnSJaG4Mg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/27/2017", "text": "I'm obsessed with this place. How much, you ask? I've been twice in less than 24 hours. The concept is simple, though it's a little confusing if you're a first-timer and/or don't speak Spanish. There are really only four menu items offered: tacos, mulitas, vampiros, and quesadillas. Within these categories you can choose one of about a million kinds of meat (including pork stomach and beef tripe - that's how you know it's legit). You stand in one of three-ish lines based on which meat you want, and it's pulled off the grill or out of the simmering pot right in front of you and chopped into tiny pieces. They're pros at it, unlike so many other Utah taco places I've been - the meat is so fresh, tender, and flavorful and even the homemade corn tortillas are worthy of praise (something I, as a corn tortilla hater, do not say lightly). My favorite is the mulita - basically an extra-full taco with another tortilla on top, sandwich style. Unlike the taco, it comes with melty cheese. I went with the cachete (beef cheek) on one and suadero (a cut similar to flank steak) on another. Order it \"con todo\" - loaded with fresh onions, guacamole, cilantro, and a nice spicy salsa. Then top it off with one of their aguas frescas or horchata or a bottle of Jarritos. The limonada and Jamaica are my picks, and their coolness very effectively balances out the spice of the salsa. Prices are great. Tacos are $2 each and none of the other options are more than $4.50. Depending on how hungry you are, you can eat really well on a budget. AND it's open 24 hours. I can personally attest that it's just as good at 2:30 a.m. as it is at a normal dinner hour, and basically just as busy.Seriously can't wait to come back."}, {"review_id": "VsAOq9hVNDxIjXV58Ly2vg", "user_id": "vgGOXsa1ORKGrH6hKrcZmQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Where do I begin, the lady taking orders disrespectful correct my wife about the way of ordering he food, the food the I didn't have chance to eat because of someone with no business in customer service period!!!!

It's delicious street tacos with plenty of seating to relax and enjoy the meal with friends. Not only do they have an excellent lineup of meats from the al pastor to less common varieties like surtida, cachete, and cabeza. If you want a real treat, I advise going for the cheesy mulita option. There is also a snack bar where you can get fruit juices, smoothies, and helote & esquites. Mi Caramelito also happens to be my favorite place to get a fantastic esquite. The horchata is a fantastic way to wash it all down, but the sweet limonada is great too.

So very unique, and so very very legit. I'll eat Mexican food any day of the year, so it wasn't until I had made plans to meet my buddy and his son for lunch here that I realized it was Cinco de Mayo. I'm not sure if the rest of the world realized it too, or if they're always that busy, but this place was all bustle on a Friday morning.It's unassuming from the outside, and I have no idea what used to be here. It kind looks like the front of an old gas station? But the building goes way back and there's a seafood stand/mart further back, and plenty of seating. If you've never been, you're probably going to need some instructions, and the only signs they have with written instructions are in Spanish. So here's the deal:1) There are a bunch of meats, and four kinds of \"vehicles\" you can put them in: tacos, quesadillas, vampiros, and mulitas. 2) There are four lines, grouped according to meat. Look at the signs so you know what line to get in for the meat you want. I don't know if it changes, but the far line was just for al pastor, then the next line for carne asada and... I don't recall, then the next closest for all the other meats, and line closest to the door was to pay.3) Once you are at the front of the meat line, tell them the vehicle you want. 4) Once you've gone through all the lines you want, get in the cashier line and pay.5) Fill up your plate with salsa and roasted jalapeños and limes and stuff from the center cart.6) Grab a seat and eat.More instructions:TACOS- They're the street kind, small shells, double shelled, but they fill them with sauce and onions unless you tell them not to. So good.VAMPIROS- Like a taco, but the shell is crispy.QUESADILLA- Like a taco, but with cheeseMULITA- Get this. It's two taco shells, both coated with cheese, then the filling on the inside. Like a quesadilla sandwich.The al pastor tacos were incredible--juicy but sweet. The cachete was beautiful and savory, and the suadero was also amazing. Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything. I'll try the tripa next time, but that has historically not been my fave and even here it looks alluring. Lengua, cabeza... all on the menu.The kind lady at the register helped me with the bottle opener, and we topped off three plates with two Cokes and a Jarrito. Parking was the only downside. The lot up front is crammed and you probably won't find a space here, so you'll have to drive further back alongside or behind the building. It gets a little bit industrial around here, but there are a lot of people coming and going so I didn't feel concerned, mostly you'll just be annoyed on a rainy day.Legit any day of the year."}, {"review_id": "ggSmuhlhZUjFy48VgboSww", "user_id": "PAWnWKEsmXUmkQh721nD4Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/2/2017", "text": "Having recently moved to SLC from Texas, I have been very skeptical of Mexican food.  I also had a few bad experiences with awful Mexican food.
