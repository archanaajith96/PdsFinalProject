The restaurant lies inside a house which really gives it a quaint and comfortable vibe. They also use cloth napkins which you rarely find in Mexican restaurants and puts a nice dinning touch when you wipe your hands from eating the delicious chips and salsa. The first round of chips and salsa are free and if you want more they charge you $1.00... We came in on a Thursday evening around 6pm and took advantage of their happy hour which right now only consist of a $1.00 off sangria and beer. The sangria was good and happy to report it was not overly sweet however we needed to order some more wine to add into it as we like our drinks strong like bull. Started off with the lamb nachos, the lamb was grounded accompanied with queso cheese (an upgrade from cheesewiz) The yellowfin tuna was FRESH and prepared tableside which was quiet impressive. The pulled pork tamale hit the spot for comfort food, the best dish was the ribs! You can tell they marinated with perfection and a taste of sweet. What I loved the most is you can tell their food is freshly prepared and the staff is amazing as well as the owner, Joaquin who makes it a point to make sure you are enjoying your dining experience! Can't wait to go back and try their freshly made margaritas soon!"}, {"review_id": "F6dxs3momN4XykIrHP16qw", "user_id": "omKACa2qBl_TtdXD2odg5g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/31/2016", "text": "The only thing I haven't tried here while in Biloxi, besides Indian food, is Mexican food. The only type of comida mexicana we eat, is what I make.Straight to the food because the service was sweet.I ordered: Table guac - avocados were perfect, perfect amount of onions and spice. Stuffed avocado - the sauce is a little much and it's kind of salty BUT I love avocado and shrimp together. The shrimp wasn't fishy or chewy. It was cooked perfectly, tho I do think grilled (jumbo shrimps/prawns) would taste better but that's unsolicited advice ;) Side of rice - idk what kind of rice that was or how it was made but I've had and made better. Rice was kind of wet and the texture was a little more chewier   than I've had it.Beans - not specified but they're are refried and pretty good, not overly salty or greasyMy husband ordered:Carne asada - medium and it's just a cut of steak, not sliced thick or cut in chunks, just a piece of steak. He said that it was ok but not very flavorful.Chorizo mashed potatoes - he said that was a disappointment because he wished it had more chorizo...but I wished he had ordered something else LOL!..... 'Cause....forreal?My dish came with what looked like homemade corn tortillas, which came HELLA late and really greasy and not cooked all of the way.Chips were refilled often and we were checked in with frequently so the service was great.Overall, it was decent but nothing to write home about.."}, {"review_id": "hGaU18M97lIE-FVrZxLAZQ", "user_id": "1NXknQDRTgIq2mGlgJzZKg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/30/2017", "text": "the food is 3 star.  I ordered a steak and chicken taco.  the price is great for only $4 a taco however the meat was just okay.  the house made tortilla was absolutely amazing.  the waitress was very polite.  I gave it a 4 star because of how nice it is.  it's clean it's comfortable and the music playlist is legit.  i will come again to try another plate hopefully I can rare it a 5 star next time."}, {"review_id": "EdAttsskNYhSe9w5ka6OjQ", "user_id": "RYHP_RyMaYz2AwMEDD_6gA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/24/2017", "text": "Excellent, high quality food.

She was super knowledgeable, welcoming and made me a bada$$ Martini. Everything is freshly made here. They make all their mixers, they don't  even have a soda gun. She's been here for a year, and the restaurant has been here three years. It's a hidden gem and also has another location that opened in Ocean Springs. I had a fun time finishing my martini outside on their brick paved  patio. The menu is pricey but it's quality and the place is so darn cute! Perfect date place. I will definitely be back to try some more. The tacos were delicious and filling. I wanted to try the tableside guacamole, but Stacy nicely warned that it was large and to go straight  to taco land.

Great atmosphere, wonderful food, and delicious bar drinks. The specialty drinks are handmade with freshly squeezed juices. The meats are marinated properly so you can taste the time and care that went into the preparation. I think everything is made in house so they are able to accommodate special diets, etc. The service is great as well. This is my favorite restaurant I have tried in the last couple of months. Oh they can also serve large parties in private rooms."}, {"review_id": "ccGJ_5ryGvDRyoNZTIYIsQ", "user_id": "W404xm2rbU9gJDgxQw6kuw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2017", "text": "Went there the first time for a baby shower, and we decided we needed to try regular menu.

The food looked great and it's a beautiful restaurant. Being how expensive it was, ($20 for a fajita, $15 for a burrito), I expected it to be damn good. While the meats were cooked perfectly and we're obviously good quality, they were bland/under-seasoned. I was surprised that the ribs had such a \"Korean/Asian teriyaki\" BBQ taste to them. The shrimp stuffed avocado was good, as were the portions, but will likely not return because our entrees lacked exciting flavor."}, {"review_id": "a-17eD-xVMNJsiyJLI-5Bg", "user_id": "NH78GGLbRknd0iLaShmm5A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/18/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Our food was to die for!  This is Mexican Food Art.  The owner/chef greets us on each visit.  We  cannot get enough of this great food and personal service."}, {"review_id": "Q0gbxdECB6_fIcHC6qk5xw", "user_id": "dxprntgFmeksqXny8Sg1mQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/26/2017", "text": "Awesome EATS!

I'm running out of positive adjectives to describe how great the margaritas were. They use fresh fruit and have the perfect blend. Can't wait to come back.
