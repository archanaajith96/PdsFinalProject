I told my friend that when I get to Tulsa, i need some real bbq. It is too close to Texas and Kansas not to have real bbq somewhere right??Look no further! This bbq is amazing. There is no large, flashy sign on the outside so you just gotta know where you're going! We arrived and there was side parking and parking in the back. How convenient! Thankfully we got here around lunch time, a little after 1130am and there were only 4 people ahead of us! The menu is pretty simple and by the pound. Not sure what was all in their happy platter but I just ordered a little bit of everything and I'm soo glad i did! First off, their ribs, hands down are the ultimate thing to get. Amazing, flavorful, smokey and oh so tender! Definitely order a few of these because you'll never want to stop eating them! I also ordered the \"lava link' which was supposed to be spicy. It wasn't that spicy in my opinion...like a 2.5/5? Definitely doesn't linger but has a nice bite to it and a nice taste of spice. Loved how juicy it was. Same with the pork and venison sausage. Sooo succulent and tender. It was incredible! $2/7 on the menu. You must not pass these sausages up! The brisket was also amazing. Super smokey, tender and juicy and had a nice moisture to it. Didn't care for it on the buns so I would definitely order it without a sandwich next time! The baked beans were amazing. Definitely different than carolina style but I loved how savory it was and how it had some tang and bite to it. Definitely worth it! The \"grilled\" potato salad was also incredible. Grilled veggies (peppers, potatoes, onions) with smokey bits of meat...yasss!! Don't expect it to taste like a cold potato salad. This is a very unique take on \"salad.\" I'd say it tasted more like a side dish, heavy but not in a bad way and will fill you up. Loved the flavors! Almost forgot-- their chicken was good but bland. Lots of smokey flavors, very aromatic and cooked well but no overall taste. Not as tender as I'd hope but I'm glad I got to try it. It would definitely need lots of bbq sauce to elevate it, but worth the try. I would probably pass next time though. Overall, I love the atmosphere. Very divey, lots of ample seating, very organized and a bit pricey. You will see 75% of the consumers are males, something my friend noticed. I was proud to be gettin my hands down and dirty for some good ole bbq. Their sauces were tasty but none were spicy. Free water cups and takeout boxes near condiments.Super friendly, fast service and amazing food. They gave out huge samples in line. Don't miss it! Can't wait to try their spices that they sell. Oh- they also sell fresh cuts of their meats! Sausages, steaks, chicken, etc. Definitely would buy it if I lived in Tulsa. Expect a bunch of leftovers and come hungry!! Definitely a delicious bbq gem!"}, {"review_id": "Ety3mfj8WkJgO2rC9ILJ2w", "user_id": "Bxh2WfBSykVYsSL2flcUgw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "I really wanted this to be a memorable place for BBQ. My review started as a three star but I elevated it to four stars when thinking about the friendly staff and nostalgic atmosphere. The ribs and brisket were cooked perfectly. I was confused about the rub, as both of the items I chose seemed to have the same spice recipe. They really layer on the rub for a nice bark, but some bites were too much. The smoke was spot on but not calculated, hence the name Burn Co. I had the grilled potato salad and baked beans because the Mac and cheese was only available later in the week. The potato salad was ok and the beans were generic. I would eat here again but would go with maybe a smoked bologna sandwich so my expectations wouldn't be let down.

A patron came and asked we close the door as it was creating a draft. The line moved pretty fast. We chatted as we waited.  The dining is picnic tables which you share with others. It was crowded and we sat one table which was too crowded and then fortunately another portion of a table opened up. Both tables we were warmly welcomed and encouraged to sit with them. We ordered a two meat, two side plate and a baby back rib meal. The food was hot when delivered and delicious. The grilled potato salad changed my life. It's the most amazing concoction ever. We stumbled our way through waiting for our meal, delivery, and the sauces. I'm marking down 1 star (would do 1/2 a star if I could) due to us telling the staff it was our first time which was acknowledged with a nod rather than explaining the lay of the land. We had \"to go\" leftover items and a female staff made fun of how we folded the box.  We weren't offered help just laughed at about it. We put it in a bag to hide our problem. We had to figure out where things were and how to do things albeit wrong on the to go box that advertised fried chicken. All in all great food, fun atmosphere.

The line today was pretty decent (about 10/15 minutes before we got to the cashier to place our order), but I have seen days where the line wraps around the building, so you're better off to get there earlier if you want your choice of food! You order, pay, and they bring your food out to your table.The food, you ask? The best BBQ I have ever had. I do not say that lightly. The pulled pork melts in your mouth, the BBQ bologna was on point... heck, even the Mac n cheese tasted smoked.

What we got instead was a limited menu! They offered the meat of the day on a tray called the \"refugee\" for $10.00 or something off the grill. The waitress really pushed the \"refugee\" platter. All 3 of us ordered the platter and drinks for $30.00. The place has a retro- country vibe to it and a open counter into the kitchen. You can smell the deliciousness of the smoked meat and see the guys working hard preparing the food in the back. Make a note: whatever they have leftover is what you get on the \"refugee\" platter. If was different throughout the 35-40 minutes we ate at the restaurant. We had pulled pork, 2-3 different kinds of sausages, and homemade bologna. Our side was baked beans. We saw other people with chicken legs, more pulled pork servings, buns, and even a fresh fish was coming out to be served. You get what you get. They closed at 2:30pm. We got there a little after 1pm and people were still coming in after 2pm. It's just that good! The meat comes dry- meaning no sauce. They offer 2 kinds, mild and hot. A few of their sausages were hot so I had a hard time differentiating the sauces. The beans are smoky and hot too not sweet and bacony sp? (is that a word) like most southern beans. They are more of a southwestern kind All in all- good BBQ. I have been traveling through the States eating my way from BBQ joint to joint. This wasn't THE best but it was very good. We are coming back for the ribs. Yes, we will endure the line next time."}, {"review_id": "V8qeSteHzrvalZXL_gDmqA", "user_id": "KePkvm9wE_O03tufXwQiEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/26/2017", "text": "HOLY CRAP!Ok first off get your hands on the mac n cheese, it's smoked to die for...

The brisket and pork are two other favorites, but I like brisket better and you won't find one in Tulsa that's any more juicer than this place! Bologna is good, no complaints there and you can get the hint of smoke in every thick cut bite.. The Fatty.. ok.. I know it looks like a sausage wrapped in meatloaf and bacon.. TRY THE DAMN THING.. you will thank me for it.. When going and really in the mood get the HAPPY PLATE.. It's like a bunch of everything and when done.. you will have 4-6 meals for the rest of the week.. Worth the money and I typically grab it and a rack of ribs so I can nibble around with a smile!Hands down you won't find anything here you won't like and if you do.. don't come back.. really.. ok come back... you know you will. So.. do realize that this place has a line to get in the door.. And if it's like meat season and the weather is nice.. get there early... if they run out.. they run out...
