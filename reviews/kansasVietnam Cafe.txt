It's not the nicest ambiance by any stretch, so we have leaned on it a few times for takeout. Thanks to some awesome photos on Yelp, I was able to narrow it down to the combination bun. This gigantic bowl of food came with vermicelli rice noodles (tons of em), sprouts, carrots, pork, diced egg roll, a few pieces of shrimp, cilantro and a sauce to add to it that was primarily a spicy fish sauce and lime, if I'm guessing. After a couple good workouts, I was in need of some serious nourishment and the mixture of fresh veggies and everything else was like drinking perfectly chilled water on a hot summer day.  I doctored mine up at home with a hearty helping of sriracha and a dash of soy sauce. Oh and this whole mess of food was only $8.50 which is insanely fair.My wife got the chicken noodle stir-fry and it was good if not a tad bland. In the past I've had the pho here and it was good enough, but I've found I enjoy others in town better.Just an every now and again kind of place, but I highly recommend some variation of Bun if you're wanting to try it out."}, {"review_id": "jQqmTSEhwIka5ptlvb8ziA", "user_id": "7YQjo08-pK8pgprHgOT3Lw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "11/18/2017", "text": "This location is NOT affiliated with the one in the River Market area of KCMO. Friendly service but didn't have much knowledge of the menu.The spring rolls(egg rolls) tasted like they were vegetarian and filled with cabbage only. I didn't detect any meat which should be noticeable in these rolls.The Pho was mediocre. Won't be heading back and will opt for a further drive next time I'm in the area and craving Vietnamese food."}, {"review_id": "hgMYf-T8NQUwTGm_9_MbgQ", "user_id": "nqzqvYsAuRBa_o7_cN2ZVQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Got the Lemongrass Chicken and could not have been more pleased! Chicken properly cooked with just the right amount of curry and lemongrass seasoning. This location used to be affiliated with the Campbell St location but this one is now under new management. Sadly the prices here are a bit more expensive but honestly I have no complaints. My meal cost me $10 and it tasted like a $10 entree (in a great way). Staff is ultra friendly and polite. If you are a Vietnamese connoisseur this place is a must for you to try. Seating and atmosphere better than Campbell St, but the quality of food? That's a tough one!"}, {"review_id": "IT-H--VsT6hsGw4an_QOyg", "user_id": "DX9ojGfWMy16e_rY-dkG5g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/12/2017", "text": "Meh. Pho was okay but, as others have said, the atmosphere isn't the best. Very outdated, booths were a little beat up and it was extremely cold in there tonight. The broth was good with minimal additives needed but, the quality of meat used in their seafood was very very poor.

Recently, the hubby said he couldn't remember why we hadn't been back and said he'd like to try them again, so off we went.Both of us are huge fans of Vietnamese food, but there are some restaurants that pile on the MSG.  I don't have an MSG allergy (there are those who claim that's bogus...I won't jump into the fray), but I do get severe migraines if I have too much of it. The KCMO Vietnam Cafe gave me the second worst migraine of my life. The reason I mention this is that there are lots of people who try to avoid it, and it's really an unnecessary ingredient. As it turns out, Vietnam Cafe uses it in almost every dish! Our waitress said they soak all of the meats, including the shrimp, in it. The only thing I could have from the menu was a veggie bowl (rice or vermicelli). I got the vermicelli bowl and it was incredibly meh. The tofu had been soaked in far too much soy sauce and then wasn't prepared correctly and it threw off the flavor and texture of the dish.The hubby ordered the shrimp and sweet potato fries and the order had only three tiny shrimp.   He complained about the rest of his food lacking flavor and he was utterly disappointed since he was looking forward to a tasty Vietnamese meal. The interior is a tad divey and not terribly clean. It doesn't look like they've updated (or cleaned) anything since our last visit years ago. Our waitress was sweet and helpful, but food came out very slowly.So now we remember why we hadn't been back to Vietnam Cafe in years. This time, we're planning to remember. There are far too many great Vietnamese restaurants to waste tastebuds here."}, {"review_id": "n3O5H4n57n6FbbbtFpT_SQ", "user_id": "jmbmdjeQrbydQn4sn-qdXg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/20/2017", "text": "If it wasn't so sketchy looking on the outside I think I would have made an attempt to visit a year ago when I  first started working at KU Med. My co-worker decided that we needed to try something new for lunch and suggested Vietnam Cafe....sooo we went for it. We workaholics like to work and eat so we were pleasantly surprised that we were able to study the menu and order online before walking across the street to pick up our food.   We  ordered the crab rangoon, beef pho,  mi/hi tieu dish,  and the chicken stir fried noodles.  The food was satisfying and my coworkers who have never had pho enjoyed it. With a few other Vietnamese options in Kansas City (that I've tried),  this place definitely wouldn't  be my go-to spot, but on a cold winter day at the hospital I'm sure I'll enjoy the convenience of having their pho across the street."}, {"review_id": "tJ9SqZ0er1j0ZHG44DL6vA", "user_id": "QR7evYt1jKUZpzVSe1Nqog", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/25/2017", "text": "Here for lunch after a KU Med appointment.

Finally, I decided to order some of their food online and walk over to pick it up. Their online ordering website is super user-friendly and couldn't get much better. I love their lemongrass chicken with white rice, their chicken curry, and you can't go wrong with their crab Rangoon's. It's not the best of the best, but it's Vietnamese comfort food that you can't really go wrong with. Order online, pick it up 20 minutes later, and take it home to eat while you watch Netflix.
