Probably the best osso bucco I've ever had. Bravo!Small plates: Farro with roasted winter vegetables was... more like vegetables with a little farro sprinkled on.  Nothing to see here, move on.Mini crab cakes: excellent.Short rib pasta: as unctuous as you'd expect from short ribs.  Delicious.Lobster risotto: fine, but not extraordinary.Baked brie: good, with a firmer pastry than the usual phyllo.Cheesecake: good, with a orange-citrus note.  But otherwise simply a competent cheesecake.Mexican chocolate crème brûlée: excellent, and I don't usually approve of messing with the simplicity of this dish.  But this was extremely tasty.  Would have been improved by a little cinnamon (or burnt sugar) wafer on the side.Service: attentive, knowledgable, friendly.Two big thumbs up!!!"}, {"review_id": "pKN9hvoZz3IHd-1RBKH2gw", "user_id": "0Lj-A6dnKlgELs2RxK5vmg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "It was great, I'm visiting for work and my filet was jam packed with flavor.

First and foremost, the atmosphere is extremely cozy and welcoming. The host immediately greets you and took our coats before seating us. We started with the buttermilk fried oysters, the cheese plate, and the Local Butterbean Cassoulet. OMG! Everything was so delightful! The cheeses were divine on the cheese plate. They did not skimp. The olives and nuts were perfect. The hummus was super tasty. Those oysters were cooked perfectly and were scrumptious! The best thing was that butterbean cassoulet with the bacon and duck confit.....YUM!!! I could have just eaten that. It was one of the best things on the menu! I would order that butterbean thing every single time it was so delicious!!For dinner, I had the grilled lamb. It was AMAZING!! It was really really good! Perfectly cooked with goat cheese potatoes and asparagus. I really couldn't ask for better. My friends got the Grilled Beef Tenderloin and the Seabass and they both genuinely loved their entrees.For dessert, I had the Chocolate Love- chocolate torte with raspberry sauce, one friend had the vanilla bean creme brulee and another had the banana cream pie. All the desserts were completely amazing. That chocolate torte was incredible. I totally had my own \"When Harry Met Sally\" moment!! The service was impeccable! The other thing that really sold me on McEwen's was their top notch selection of spirits. They really had a wonderful selection of bourbons and whiskeys to choose from and I must say they are generous with their pours when you are drinking your bourbon neat or on the rocks. I would totally go back to McEwen's again. All in all, the restaurant was the total package."}, {"review_id": "d5kXCzkZ-JyhW_glU4RL9w", "user_id": "0gOICfFoLcbiWyx9DjmUJg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "We were there last night and was pleasantly surprised by the the warmth and southern hospitality as soon as we walked in the door. We were greeted by Julie (Managing Director) with a warm smile and we asked about the history of the restaurant and she gave a great overview. For my bourbon aficionados out there, they have an eclectic collection ranging from $6 to $300 per two ounce poor! The food was DELICIOUS! I had the beef sliders and a chopped salad while my friend had the shrimp and grits. We then asked for some recommendations on some things to do and Julie gave us some awesome ideas.

I'm not from Memphis but we wanted to make sure we got a good meal the night before a race. There were 4 of us & we all loved our food.

The service was super friendly and inviting to start. The food presentation is there alongside great flavors. The atmosphere is upscale fine dining without the jacket. They keep it fresh by slightly changing ingredients with the season. And to me some of these food pairings are unique. I thoroughly enjoyed my catfish and collard greens over the mac n cheese. But like fish over a bed of rice, I really didn't eat the mac n cheese because it was about the catfish and greens. I also tried the lamb and it was great but the sauce was a little salty for my taste. For dessert I had the famous banana cream pie & I loved it! I would eat another one if I could fit it in my belly."}, {"review_id": "ZsToxWL3SHDFqt9XcpinQg", "user_id": "wyphQvpzayFVU_Hif4b8RQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "So there I was, the only pescatarian (fish-consuming vegetarian) in my party.

McEwen's would be a solid 3 1/2 should Yelp allow, but without that middle ground, a difficult decision was required. I had settled on 4 based on the friendly staff and a pretty good Grouper special of the day. The dish was nicely seared ( if a touch dry) with a rice, black bean and crawfish mix below. Nothing to warrant a Congressional medal, but not bad. For dessert, I ordered the \" famous\" ( or some other equally aggrandized adjective) Banana Cream Pie. It fell completely into to OK category. Frankly, it looked like it had been sliced hours ago and left in a cooler, the top and chocolate a touch congealed. Three it was. This seemed like a place that was once the \"hot\" spot in the city. On an empty street, it was still packed. Not sure why. This was average food. Not bad, but not a meal representative of a total Yelp combination of 4 1/2 stars."}, {"review_id": "UaT0GhcCU8DfQ6xuNMhSFw", "user_id": "WSHCFKYSuF_8_gstWB-9QQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "Came in for lunch and it was pretty dead.

The whole experience was awesome. The food was great, the atmosphere was amazing, but the service was truly over the top.We started with the baked Bri. It was incredible and just the right portion. Next we both had a wedge salad. The salad was perfectly proportioned with fresh ingredients. Then we had the main course... I had a New York Strip, rare... it was perfect. The blue cheese on top really made the steak special. My wife had the baked scallops, with a side of grits plus crisp green beans. We topped it off by asking our server to pick the desert and boy she did good. Coconut cake.
