Customer Service- A++. From the moment we walked in we felt like we were family (and not the fighting kind). They helped us find the perfect things to order and service was great. Give these people an award (or raise) because I fell in love with this place even before I tried my food. Restaurant outlook- B overall it looks like a generic pizza shop. Nothing special. Black and red tables with paper on the table. Average scenery. Food- A. We ordered The Spin Zone calzone, Wet Fries, and Garlic knots."}, {"review_id": "HOZtxdw5vTGGSJKt-jpO8w", "user_id": "PVB0ggrspa1wWUECI7BN6w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "3.5-4 Stars. I agree with many reviewers, this is some of the better pizza I've had in Henderson from a more traditional pizzeria. The ingredients are high quality and with a simple, straightforward menu, the product really shines. Placing a phone order on a Sunday during peak time was a 45 min wait. We had a medium pepperoni pizza with an order of garlic knots- the best part for me! They were so fluffy and flavorful, even better dipped in the perfect marinara. Pizza was good, but cut incredibly lazily by the same person working the counter, leaving no two slices the same, two being about 3 inches long- not cool and not up to health code standards. I would definitely be interested in trying some of their pastas or entree meals next time and would imagine we will be back for pizza takeout in the future, but probably not with any great haste."}, {"review_id": "ZaN3Jyz-N_QCllsmlh_6uQ", "user_id": "HvZQ9qFkRSxRCI0tMQ6nLA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "This is one of my favorite places in town, for several reasons. My followers know I very rarely eat at chains, it's just what I like. This is a family run business that takes much pride in their work. The ambiance is casual and comfortable, and you can see the crew making your food as ordered. And it's every bit worth the little extra wait. Let's face it, fast, cheap pizza is fast and cheap for a reason. And many people are ok with that. I'm not. I'm very picky about my calzone. Some places try to overdo it. Bistro nails it. The dough is soft and fluffy, not heavy, and baked to perfection, not like a brick. It fluffy up so big that the to-go box it comes in can't be closed! Inside is more deliciousness. High quality mozzarella that when you tilt your back just falls into your mouth.  Accompanied by creamy ricotta. Not all cheese is equal! You can absolutely tell the difference in the high quality here. Then there is the spinach. It is fresh! Not frozen and chopped. And the garlic is fresh, not that stuff in a jar. It is all rounded out with the most delicious marinara, of which I love so much I order extra. This is what guilty pleasures are made of. Then, there is my son, spaghetti connoisseur. This is the only place, outside of my kitchen, that he will order it. And he is a tough critic! If you aren't hungry by now, I haven't done my job. Do yourself a favor, next time you want Italian, check this gem out. You can thank me later.

This spot screams quintessential neighborhood pizzeria. The smell is inviting and smiling faces on \"The line\" are quick to greet and assist you.  We started with a Bistro salad and bistro fries (thanks to all the yelp suggestions,) and I'm so happy we did. The veggies in this salad are so flavorful. whatever they marinade the tomatoes in is phenomenal. My non tomato eating husband was eating them. This says a lot y'all. The salad is full, and the perfect amount for two plates full and maybe even a little to take home! The fries. Omg those bistro fries. They came out smoking hot and smelt like heaven. We're hooked. If you are a French fry lover, this is A total must with every order. There wasn't a fry left behind. This was the first empty plate. We ordered a LARGE pepperoni pizza and got a FREE order of garlic knots with a yelp check in! **scoreeeee**Both my 4 year old and husband were drooling over their pie as they mmm'ed with each bite. I ordered a small pizza with onion, artichoke, and green peppers. IT WAS SO SO SO SO TASTY. The only tip I would give for a veggie pizza would be ask for an extra sauce. Their sauce is next level. For real.... I wanted to drink it. We got all of our food for around 40 bucks. It was an incredible price for the amount of food that we bought. Can't wait for tomorrow's leftovers and I especially can't wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "3lq64K1IzqRC4gkXzF9aVQ", "user_id": "Cob8TALgy-LRBZAoprqaew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "We decided to get a pizza for National Pizza Day...I was less excited than my fam because we had pizza at work today......I felt like non commercial pizza hence picking this place...Ohhhhhhhemmmm goodness I'm so glad I did!

Great food! Mlm I had the lasagna it was yummy!  The garlic rolls were good. The entrees come with salads and rolls, lots of yummy food for the money!   So be careful when ordering to go.

I have bounced around between pizzerias in town and was hoping to find one closer to where I live that I could count on. After moving to town from my native NYC you could say I'm a bit of a pizza snob, but not enough of a snob where I can't/won't admit a good find.First thing I noticed is that they don't greet you. Maybe if they weren't busy and were waiting for an order they would, but they were moderately busy and there were multiple guys behind the counter. Each and every guy that was behind the counter looked at me at separate intervals, but not once did anybody say \"how you doing, just give us a second here.\" I don't need handholding, but  some sort of \"be right with you\" would have been cool.Guy who took my order was quick and efficient. I ordered and I waited, decent sized order and wait time matched what I ordered, which was fine. They even had it done a bit quicker that I had anticipated. I was taking it to go.Redeemed the Yelp offer for free garlic knots with a large pizza ordered, which they forgot to give me (the knots lol.) Luckily I said something while still there, and they gladly handled that on the spot. Better to have it happen there than discovering it once I got home.Ok, now to the food: Lg. White Pizza with pepperoni & fresh garlic - very little grease (which is hard to do on a pizza with cheese and pepperoni, so kudos there.) Dough could have been more crisp, but I had read reviews about their crust and knew what to expect. Still really tasty and they don't skimp on the toppings. Nice guys!Medium Wings - They were ok. I think they would have been better eaten in, not ordered to go. Bistro Fries - not bad, just not my cup of tea. Saw pictures on the site/yelp with what looked like stringy cheese. Yeah, there was none of that. One of the reviews raves about them, I wasn't that fond of them. Personal taste, they were fine...I just wouldn't order them again. Garlic Knots - tasty, crisp...loved 'em. Overall I really like this place! If you come back with your receipt you get half off a pizza within three days...nice touch! I think next time I visit I will order to eat in, I'm confident I will be even more pleased with an order fresh out of the oven. Thanks guys! Good stuff! I'll be back!Tyler: Thanks for your reply, seems altogether a lost art these days. I wasn't blaming you guys for the travel ability of the food, I definitely got the feeling it was travel time induced lol. Still overall a good experience and it will most likely be one of many more.Thanks again!

Tucked in a small plaza in between a Kumon and a salon, this out of the way pizzeria is sure to attract some attention with its New York style pizza, especially with how they have deals for every day of the week.When trying to judge a pie, you have to go back to the basics and as such, when you're judging a New York slice, you have to go for a plain cheese. But simplicity does not mean lackluster. The dough was thin and crispy with just enough charred bubbles to really compliment the tomato sauce. And surprisingly, while there was a generous slather of cheese on top,it didn't grease through the box as many other pizzas do.Along with the cheese pizza, we also decided to try a stuffed meat and bell pepper pizza with mushrooms. And while the cheese pizza is king, this one did not disappoint. The extra layer of cheese and the golden brown crust made the consistency a little fluffier, perfect for those who want something more akin to a Chicago slice. But the real star was their housemade marinara that was the perfect combination of sweet and tangy."}, {"review_id": "1IGJApmb2M1J7FO2zU_BXQ", "user_id": "FhgnjbvweS0Qp-t6_hyBLA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Amazing , service was good delicious ny style pizza sadwitch was delish, as well.as my wings this will remain my pizza spot"}, {"review_id": "0Ghifj_48uxXRdxqhzRcbQ", "user_id": "xeD6rSJDSzRO0aXaJzDJKg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Good options!

Food is served at the table when ready. Drink refills are self serve / next to the cashier. Currently if you check-in on Yelp, you get a complimentary order of garlic knots (which are so yummy!).

We've never been so lucky to come across such a good spot. This is by far one of top 5 pizza joints we've been too.

I wish we remembered their names - but there is a big funny guy, a dude with dreads and a girl with a pixie hair cut who ALWAYS make our visit so special. We've been there at LEAST 10 times now and will continue to eat there. We've tried a handful of menu items and recommend the ghost pepper fries as a great appetizer. You have to give this pizza joint a shot- you WONT regret it.
