When you step in, you're greeted with enthusiasm by the friendly crew behind the counter. We had the sweet dog and a side of Mac and cheese. Both were delicious. The Mac and cheese was very rich. I wasn't able to enjoy it all because my 4 year old devoured it. Prices are fair for the portions and quality of ingredients. This spot definitely brings a different flair to the neighborhood. There's lots of Miami sports memorabilia and articles framed along the wall. They seem to also serve Fireman Dereck's pies which is great because it saves the drive to Wynwood. Note, seating is limited. There are only a few stool and counter top space. Definitely worth a visit!"}, {"review_id": "62WejQJDL7hgTLquVrATJQ", "user_id": "zROwdT-L5WPhsZMVZjGCug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "We are always out for a drive on the weekends to try something new.

I've been in miami for so long and I failed to discover this place earlier. First, I love love the staff. The young man at the register greeted us with a smile and an invitation to all the delicious hot dog choices. We ordered the Miami Heat topped with chilli. Muy delicioso!!! Every bite you take it gets better and better, but also becomes sad that it's almost done. To top it off,the little snickers bar was a great add on. The fries came straight from the fryer and tasted just as good.. The place may be tiny on the inside but the food and flavors have plenty of heart! The entire places have moments of Miami's past,from sports to pictures of old miami buildings. Tourists and locals alike need to visit this place!"}, {"review_id": "P0zh3AobwpmWMOK4CYh14Q", "user_id": "9VoLPhtgWJwBZ9ScF_ILgw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "This is my first time writing a review.

Because there isn't a better cheat meal on Earth.   ---   ---   ---When I am trying to be healthy, I crave carbs like there's literally a satanic force inside my belly that feeds off the souls of bread, chips and cheese. I don't often crave hot dogs, but after a few days of clean eating, I feel like I'd pay $1,000 for a gourmet hot dog, if I know it didn't cancel out my whole week of behaving myself.Sweet Dogs specifically, is the greatest cheat meal of all the cheat meals in the land. These gourmet dogs are not your run-of-the-mill Oscar Meyer Weiners. This meat is legit, but it just so happens to be in the same general form of what you'd see at a no frills BBQ cookout. It's just oh-so-much better.I took a 15 minute Uber ride here from my hotel, strictly for the purpose of grabbing a late lunch, and then heading back to my room. There's not much to the interior - you walk up to a bar where you order, and there's a few chairs to sit at. I was fortunately here during an off-peak time, but I'd guess that most people order these to go? Either way, it's worth whatever you need to do.I ordered the Dolphin, which has bacon, mozzarella cheese, pineapple sauce and papitas. It was possibly the best thing that's ever happened to me.I also ordered the mac-n-cheese, which comes with croutons and parmesan cheese. Hey, I have a question: how come nobody in the history of Earth has invented mac-n-cheese with croutons and parm until now? Sweet Dogs, thousands of years from now, when future mankind looks back at this era, they will speak of the Sweet Dogs mac-n-cheese in the same vein as we look at the wheel and the telephone.It's going to be hard not going here for every single future visit to Miami. I wish I could go every day until I've tried everything on the menu."}, {"review_id": "EA9tpfXB8PRnbUFmzaY_Mg", "user_id": "AUc4UHwDk87w3bumGasItg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "The Best Hot Dogs in the city!

I was really excited because I've never really had a good hot dog before. I dragged my mom and little brother. The parking spaces are a bit tight and it was under construction. The establishment itself is pretty small with limited seating. The staff is friendly and helpful.THE HEAT- beef chili, cheddar cheese, chopped tomato, guacamole, jalapeno, and corn chipsI liked the flavors in this hot dog. The guacamole was creamy with the chili and I liked the crunchiness of the corn chips. Overall the hot dog wasn't bad, but it's not different from the other hot dogs I've had. It's a bit better with various textures, but flavor wise it's about the same.THE DOLPHINS- grilled ham, smoked bacon, melted mozzarella cheese, pineapple, home sauce, and papitasMy mom ordered this and she liked it. It's more of a sweet and savory flavor. I personally don't like the pineapples with ham, but the flavors gave the hot dog an interesting mix.The hot dogs here are alright. They had some interesting flavors, but nothing spectacular. I wouldn't promise that I would come back nor would I crave for it, but it wasn't too bad."}, {"review_id": "PJfgqwscih945DvfpfEb5Q", "user_id": "WRPee83ecRS1TXW7DkqjAQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "I am not a huge hot dog fan, but how could I resist a place that has this many toppings and interesting combinations?!

I say this because the horrible excuse for parking in this small plaza was packed so full my car literally had 2 inches of free space on either side before almost hitting other cars trying to squeeze out after finding no empty spaces. You're better off parking at the cvs down the street and walking.Now that my rant is over--Victor the owner is a friendly guy who was really welcoming as soon as I walked in and helped me to ultimately follow my heart and my stomach and choose the marlin dog. I did not go wrong, and also went with the mac and cheese as a side which was a little runny compared to other mac and cheese's that I've eaten but tasty nonetheless.  They even snuck in a Twix bar for dessert haha, what a treat. This joint is open 7 days a week AND open til 3am on the weekends, couldn't ask for more."}, {"review_id": "eJU_dUILSx2FPFC6Ct9WuA", "user_id": "P23fm0ssukrZnLi8DlibCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/15/2017", "text": "This place had been on my bookmark for far too long. Finally on a hot Sunday afternoon after hitting the Venetian pool in coral gables and dying of hunger, yelp reminded me about it and we decided to try it out.I wish I could give this place 50 stars, the customer service was great. I believe the owner was the person that took care of us he was extremely informative with his menu and we finally decided what we wanted. While waiting for the food he gave us a sample of their house made popcorn and yikes! Even the popcorn is good.When ended up ordering a miami heat hot dog and added peppers with onions and the miami dolphins . My recommendations are; come on an empty stomach because portions are huge and do yourself a favor and get the cheese fries.

I had the Mac (hot dog topped with mac and cheese and croutons), a vanilla sundae (soft serve in a cup), and an additional side of fried mozzarella sticks because I needed a $10 min purchase to use my credit card. Overall, the food was satisfying, but also greasy and quite heavy. Definitely an indulgence once in a (long) while. I think my favorite part was the mac and cheese that topped the dog, and will probs just order it alone next time. I was expecting something spectacular because of all the \"Yelp loves us\" stickers on their window, but I can really only say that they were good, and not great."}, {"review_id": "0falOkIDYB8cfuUSVa2Avg", "user_id": "QEu71JvRhco0nF7ETJ5nlw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "I came here with my boy because he told me that they have the best mac and chesse.

This mac n cheese is one of the best I have ever tasted in my life, so creamy and cheesy I wanted to have two bowls of it. The gentleman is the nicest person ever and excellent customer service.
