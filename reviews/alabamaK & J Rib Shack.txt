When you pull up parking is a bit of a cluster. They have their smoker right outside offering hungry patrons of what's to come. Now I don't know anything about Montgomery, but upon entry you're greeted with a sign that says No weapons, No violence, No hoods along with bars across the windows. It didn't deter us or the other 3 customers in line before us either. The menu is on a chalkboard behind the counter & since we were unfamiliar with the joint I found it a little difficult to read. A man named Pope kindly took our order. My boyfriend ordered the pulled chicken bbq sandwich w/ mac & cheese & I ordered the pulled pork bbq dinner that came w/ 2 sides & a cornbread muffin. We waited in the dining area while our order was prepared. This place could really use some TLC. The floor was peeling & well the whole room just needed upgrades & love. BUT Let me tell y'all, that bbq was delicious. The pork had minimal fat & was drowned in bbq sauce that wasn't spicy. The Mac & cheese was kinda oily to be expected & the green beans were tasty. Cornbread wasn't sweet, but still good. I'd love to drop $50 in here one time & eat everything on that chalkboard. For the 2 meals it cost us about $20. I'd love to have the opportunity to eat here again."}, {"review_id": "K4FmUsYigce2jViCEK-TUA", "user_id": "iwtc5Zh18njgVHTUmVltAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "Best BBQ in Montgomery.

Excellent home made food. If you are looking for some good old fashioned barbecue made by the owners on site - this is the spot! The greens, mac n cheese, rib tips, ribs, and potato salad were fire! Peach cobbler, red velvet cake, and pound cake might make you a diabetic- but it would be well worth it. If your near Montgomery, Alabama this is a must."}, {"review_id": "jYPIo5AS2K4Tuq_2tt8hjA", "user_id": "fEPuIBzvWq8mIB8Lq6ZwIA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/11/2017", "text": "Easily the best BBQ I've ever had. We evacuated from Florida to Alabama to get away from Hurricane Irma and I had a craving for some good southern soul food. This place had good reviews for the most part so, we decided to check it out. Oh man, we are so glad we did! We pull up and see the huge smoker out front. As soon as we got out of the car, we were welcomed by that delicious smoky BBQ smell. Once we entered, we placed our order with the super friendly lady at the counter. I ordered the pulled pork dinner with collards and mac n' cheese. This place is a tiny shack but, don't let the appearance fool you, the food served here is truly special. My pulled pork was juicy, tender, and super flavorful. The pork had that perfect smoky coating while easily pulling apart with a fork. The collards were delicious and well-cooked with a great flavor. The mac n' cheese was baked nice and cheesy. Everything was absolutely delicious. The BBQ places back home don't even compare. I'm not sure when or if I'll be back in Montgomery but, if I find myself in the area - I will make it a point to stop here as the food was that good."}, {"review_id": "O6194Bv5xewAkTxw6H9KUA", "user_id": "sSYDp06T3kUi3IP8p8pmkw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Delicious!

And certainly nothing to tolerate the dilapidated environment for.  It's also disappointing to see a business using only styrofoam for EVERYTHING and plastic packets of disposable utensils.  Yes it's easier for them because they don't have to wash anything.  But the long-term environmental consequences are not factored into the 0.2 cents that they spend on each styrofoam item which we and our future generations will be paying dearly for.  In this day and age, to use styrofoam for everything, including meals that are \"for here\", is just irresponsible and lazy."}, {"review_id": "TQ-gFlLmKWfAEIM44Lodvg", "user_id": "6XsCzjX4fCqtqq14HekXhA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/14/2015", "text": "I really enjoyed this place. From the moment you pull up and the smoker out front you know this is a real bbq joint. My wife and I both had the pulled pork. Both thought it was good but would have liked it dry rather in sauce. More of a purist when it comes to smoked meat and would like to decide how much sauce to add. The sides were the hit of the meal. I had really good potato salad and some of the best collards I have had in a long while. The owners were very nice and enjoyed talking to them about smoking meat.

We ordered so much food it was embarrassing, and on our way out they kept asking if we wanted more food. \"How about half a chicken? You sure you don't want anything else?\"Great people, great food.
