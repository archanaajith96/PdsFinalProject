So mamas kitchen is probably putting out food better than some y'all mamas kitchens. LOL. But seriously the food at this place is crazy good. I have tried their mama wings, jerk wings, Parmesan garlic wings, macaroni and cheese, baked beans and cornbread, oh my goodness that big piece of buttery cornbread is pure heaven. The packaging is kinda cool to me because the food comes wrapped in aluminum foil adhering to the brand of coming from your mamas kitchen. I knew this food would be love at first bite from the smell alone. The chicken wings are not small and dried out but juicy and flavored perfectly. I don't know who is seasoning or cooking this food but they have my vote. I noticed there is a pretty extensive menu offering but honestly I can't stop ordering their wings to try anything else.To tell you how good it is, I had my order delivered to my corporate office for lunch. My manager smelled the chicken from my desk and tasted it and decided to order as well. While she was ordering two more coworkers decided to order with her. The next day I had multiple coworkers asking to place an order. The food at this place has pretty much corrupted lunch time at my work environment."}, {"review_id": "UEcBn5ovH0Y1eLWFrwlUZw", "user_id": "4YZ14aCtPR5rg-APXDuW5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "WOW!  Great comfort food!We ate:Beef Brisket dinner - super moist and tender meat, something you don't always get at BBQ chains.Pulled Pork dinner - nice and juicy, no extra sauce needed.  Sides:Cole slaw - very tangy less sweet the way I like it.  Baked beans - cooked with pork and brown sugar.

Come here to get some delicious BBQ, hot dogs, corn bread, sweet potato pie, etc.When my wife asked the dude what was good to order, he replied \"everything's good.\" When she asked what his favorite was, he said \"everything's my favorite or else it wouldn't be on the menu.\" Basically, he was of no help and you're on your own for food decisions!Everything we ordered was pretty tasty. This is one of those places where you wish you could try every single thing because, like the guy said, everything is good (or at least sounds good on the menu). I recommend getting some yummy loaded wings.I like how this place is near the airport so if you're trying to kill some time going to or leaving the airport, this is a nice place to stop for lunch or dinner."}, {"review_id": "OcnGQxw_6uNbdkv07rnjWg", "user_id": "SJ_lwdn0spdtEa-C-1j_xg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Awesome little spot. Got the brisket which was good but not the best I've had. My wife got the pulled pork which was amazing. So moist and flavorful. The Cole slaw was great but they are stingy with it. Fries were excellent. Also got 6 jerk wings and they were some of the best wings I've had. Jerk seasoning was awesome. I think they actually gave me seven wings. Prices are reasonable.

The Dragon Breath Hot Wings., my mouth breathed fire and it was amazing. My husband took a small bit and some profanity came out of his mouth.  We both started sweating out of nowhere. My husband decided he wouls stick with the garlic buffalo wings. Which had generous amounts of garlic on them and a bit of a kick on their own. But enough about the wings. The main course. My husband has the BBQ SaMich with a side of fries. The sandwich was open face on Texas toast. It was filled with brisket, pulled pork and THICK sliced bacon, topped with melted cheese and a sweet and tangy BBQ sauce. Each of the meats had their own flavour that all blenfed together so well. The seasoned fries had a light dusting that didn't over power it. They were nice and crispy. I had the Brisket dinner with a side of Mac & Cheese and cornbread. The brisket was well cooked and melted in my mouth. The mac & cheese was probably some of the best I've had in a long time. It was think and so creamy. I think they used the gravy seasoning from their biscuits and gravy mix with added a unique flavour to the mac & cheese. The cornbread, I believe, was cooked with cake mix which made it light and fluffy. Even the serves was excellent. Both the employees working were friendly and helpful adding to an already enjoyable experience. Because everything is made to order and only two guys are working you have to be patient waiting for your food. Oh and the bathroom was surprising very clean. :-)"}, {"review_id": "zTE5UBS7wnBS8Y4EaCBDeQ", "user_id": "eqHnmNhHXZ-TQ-CPQnWFqA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/4/2017", "text": "I been seeing my mama's kitchen very often on yelp while searching for restaurants. Today finally decided to visit. The place is located in a small building of shore drive . It's in between two of my fav wing places dirty buffalo and captain groovies, but I think my mamas is a winner! Not only the price of wings is not a rip off, they have many flavors to choose from. The guys ( cook and Guy at the desk) they where so nice and friendly. We got 24 wings and you can pick 3 flavors  I asked them to suggest a flavor and got jerk chicken, They where weirdly amazing!! The wings got cooked at the moment we order them, the fries were hot and delicious. They have a big menu for a small place, I am not a fan of fry food but I can't wait to try their fry cat fish. We all need a little of soul food in our life . Place: small, clean, parking not a lot but we had no problem with it. Food : amazing! Prices: very fair Customer services: the best! Made us feel like a value customer. I did wish they had fountain drinks, but not everything can be perfect :) I def recommend my mama's kitchen !"}, {"review_id": "ktGzFK99A7W8iiRbMVJu6g", "user_id": "FImb4q72OLGbqHZQW193bg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/13/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "K. So I just went again and now we have more wing flavors to discuss: I really enjoyed the Mango Habanero. My personal favorite incarnation of the flavor. I enjoyed it over others specifically because it's hot without being Godforsaken hot or disgustingly sweet and sticky. Just my personal preference. Second, HE PUT REAL MANGO IN THERE BRUH. :D The mango juice or whatever makes a delicious difference, man. Just try it. The Hot BBQ is actually VERY GOOD and was not my own order, which I regret. :) However we did ask for it to be spicier than normal. The idea was thrown around that a touch of Dragon's Breath might be in there. The Gangnam weren't particularly Korean BBQ-y as anticipated. Same for Garlic Parm, they weren't garlickly or parmesan-y enough. Ironic because they look like they're garlicky as hell with the actual garlic on top. The Thai wasn't very much anything either. I actually enjoy BWW's Thai Curry so I guess I went in with expectations. All 3 were eh. Maybe I should ask for them saucy next time?  Busy as always right at opening on a Friday. Still pleased and can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}, {"review_id": "v4opaXhI-q2mx88Imvp3Bw", "user_id": "3KXw3NRc5T2cKLyKSebJEg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "As much as I wanted the food to be good, it wasn't...  maybe they just had an off day. Everyone elses reviews sound so great. But i will say the staff is nice..Soabout my order... I had the buffalo soldier wings and the mango habanero. Idk if it was because they were fried and maybe i should have got them grilled, But the flavors were not too good and they had a weird scent and OH my wings also  barely had any sauce. NEXT My cornbread taste As if it was sitting out for many hours but it could have had a great taste if it didnt taste old :/ ok NEXT was the mac and cheese... so it didnt taste as fresh neither nor did it taste too much like anything.

The BBQ sauce was all I needed to make this choice a home run.   And it makes the drive from Newport News all the worth while.  My Mama's Kitchen, thank you once again for making a perfect meal.  You guys surely know how to put your heart and soul on a plate."}, {"review_id": "rU47x-qnGABlJh08-OBhJg", "user_id": "8qASzBOWnMGs3HwEMkwpSw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/26/2017", "text": "First of all, let me say their food is 5 if not 6 stars! The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because we dined in and I'm not totally sure if this is a regular thing, but it was uncomfortably hot throughout the restaurant and the other customers felt it too. When the food came, it was a lil spicy, and within minutes we were dripping sweat. It didn't take long before we decided to stop eating and just box it up.THE WINGS ARE DELICIOUS AND THEIR JERK RIBS ARE BANGIN. We opted for the Gangnam and Buffalo Soldier wings. Their greens are cooked perfectly, just enough vinegar.. and my toddler is fan of their mac and cheese. My bf got the brisket sandwich and they did not hold back with the meat. It was piled high, juicy, and topped with slaw. He said even the bun was perfect. I've raved about the Jerk ribs to anyone who'd listen and i know i'm going to be back sooner rather than later but this time i will opt for take out.Besides taking it to go, i also recommend calling ahead of time since they cook everything to order so the wait time is a tad long."}, {"review_id": "Z7X2ojwf1VxAZruHBVMhNg", "user_id": "mDwZGy6gaal9MrpE7Kykgg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Food was amazing. No doubt about that. Service made the entire experience god awful. Placed an order an hour before closing and was told that a majority of what we wanted was sold out. After we sat down 2 orders were placed after ours and both were served before us. One of the orders included an item that we were told they were sold out of.
