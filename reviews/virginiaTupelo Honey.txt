It may even give a feeling of home. Its spacious with a beautiful bar and large outside patio. Now the food! My party of three started off with best biscuits we've ever had. Golden with a slight crunch on the outside and a moist bread waiting for us on the inside. I love how the biscuits didn't fall apart after bitting into it. But that's not even the best part. The biscuits come with honey and homemade blueberry jam. I highly recommend combining both for an experience. I had the Veg burger with fries which was black bean base. It to was slightly crunchy on the outside and firm on the inside. This place would be great for an anniversary, prom night, or Sunday dinner. It's not formal but versatile if need be."}, {"review_id": "PG0AVHaBamJgzct9vrp9wg", "user_id": "uxMDKAPjjXGXnlbeheG18A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Came in on Sunday morning for breakfast. It was about 9:30Am when we arrived. Surprisingly- there were a good amount of people in there. We opted to sit outside because it was nice.Our waitress was came to us pretty fast and took our orders. They gave us complimentary biscuits. Biscuits were pretty good. My sister in law got the bloody Mary. I think it was like $15... for  BLOODY MARY! I thought it was going to be a big one. It said there was grilled shrimp on it but there was 1 thawed out shrimp on it. It was definitely not worth $15 bucks and it was small...  I ordered the mimosas. It was $8.50 and the waitress said for 2 extra dollars I could get a bigger one. That thing not even big. I was disappointed in the amount and price. Especially for being brunch drinks.I ordered the Cobb salad for and entree. It was good, the chicken was seasoned well... I think it was like 14 bucks. For lettuce and a fried piece of chicken. I liked it- but it was not 14 bucks good. Though service was good. I couldn't give it higher than 3 stars. I spent 60 bucks for breakfast for me and my sister in law. That's EXPENSIVE!!"}, {"review_id": "dsjP3dq3F9t0k-jcwDd05w", "user_id": "9qwQCk6mXFQC-dfRDLky1w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Did it live up to the hype? Of course not. Nothing usually does. Was it awesome,  absolutely!  First of all the restaurant itself is well lit, laid out and decorated. Music is a nice mix and just loud enough to drown out your neighbors but still carry on an easy conversation with your table. The service was superb. The young man never let us run low on anything and was personable and polite.Now for the food. Sweet tea brined chicken was excellent. Tender and juicy, the sauce had enough flavor to accent and not overwhelm. Mac and cheese......... best not homemade I have ever had. Biscuits lived up to their reputation. Soft and warm and very tasty. Now the green beans. I like my green beans snappy, but these were pretty close to raw. The flavoring really wasn't there. Very disappointed.  Sweet tea (I'm a southerner so very important) was just sweet enough and had a clean bright finish.We had the 4 mason jar deserts. Hummingbird cake was good but different. Peanut butter and ganache was nice. Banana pudding was to die for and the lemon was good enough for 2nds and 3rds and so on. I would have given 4 1/2 stars if I could because all in all this was a nearly perfect meal. Hope to go back again soon.P.S. The cook was kind enough to make a special that was not on the menu for my wife. She had her heart set on it and it wasn't a problem. As I said suberb service."}, {"review_id": "ql5hRzwZAGa0nH6MQFkAdA", "user_id": "0C_ZFUh-1oJNYeYccOZAEw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Everything was SUPER delicious! We started off with a fluffy biscuit with honey and blueberry jam. The biscuit is very filling. Because they are so good you will be tempted to eat another one but you don't want to get full before your meal comes. I ordered the sweet potato pancakes with fried crispy chicken. Sided with grilled seasonal fruit and scrambled eggs. Sooo sooo sooo goood! My boyfriend ordered two meals. He had the steak and eggs with a side of cracklins which are their potatoes. The potatoes  were very yummy! The steak was great as well but as you can see in the picture it's literally just a little bit. Not very filling. That is why he had order two meals. His Second meal was a grilled chicken and avocado sandwich which he seemed to enjoy. However, the macaroni and cheese was very dry and unseasoned. This was probably the best brunch I've ever had. We made a reservation 3 hours before and were seated right away. The service was a bit slow because it was busy. Our waitress was very pleasant!"}, {"review_id": "5oti2fHS2TZzF4VN5X9fiw", "user_id": "c46s6Eu84rMP5SfBmJYIdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "This place is Mmmm-mazing! I wanted to come here a few more times before I gave them a review, but each time has been outstanding so I figured it was time to write a review.I've been here for brunch, lunch and dinner on separate occasions and each time has been delish. Starting with their brunch, definitely get their mimosas, you'll only need one of their large but if you get a 2nd you'll need a designated driver! Their sweet potato pancakes are OMG! I really don't have a better word for it but they are heaven and then some. For lunch and dinner I went with their fried chicken with baked mac and cheese and greens - was not disappointed. I'm from the south (Texas) so I've had my fare share of Mac and Cheese and Greens, lets just say these sides were made with love!"}, {"review_id": "dvKcWs1kDEjQfTUAU0sYjA", "user_id": "ApUP3rYDHW5L_z_Hq4nRZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "WOW Yelppers! If you ever get a chance to visit Tupelo Honey of Virginia Beach, YOU MUST try their Bloody Mary, It a refreshing beverage that you will enjoy greatly.

I went in for restaurant week for a late lunch and decided to sit at the bar. I decided on the salad and the burger w/o a bun... medium. So let's start with the fact that the stool I was sitting on had a better personality than the bartender who not only failed to introduce herself but also didn't remove any of our dirty plates until the very end of our entire meal and was continuously joining a group of other employees at a nearby booth who were eating like vultures feasting on a fresh kill. Not once between her many breaks from eating to running food to serving drinks did I see her wash her hands, use sanitizer or really even seem to care about her hygiene at all.Now my food.. my salad was just some greens with some pretty watermelon radishes in it, The bartender did not care to preset us appetizer plates napkins or silverware so the gentleman who brought our food out had to do that. I had asked for oil & vinegar as my dressing and this girl really came out of the kitchen with a cup of apple cider vinegar. I just threw some salt,  pepper and oil on it and called it a day.When my burger came out it was cut into, not just a tiny cut in the middle or something like that this thing was butchered like 15 people had checked to see the temperature. it was ridiculous. Don't they have a thermometer? My husband had a chicken fried BLT and said it was extremely dry he asked for a side of lemon aioli but by the time it finally came out he was halfway done with his food.It would be pretty difficult to get me to go back in this establishment. I'm big on servers and bartenders being on top of their hygiene and this put a bad taste in my mouth. You get breaks for a reason and nobody wants to sit and watch their server, better yet 4 of them gorge themselves 10 feet away from you while also serving you.... gross!"}, {"review_id": "-CqBkkn4uRignarnqs3ykA", "user_id": "5LPTpExgnVEKFafGfYn-mg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Pros: Good drinks, location, outside seating Cons: just about everything else.

The waitress recommended ordering on the side, and I did. While waiting, she brought out the house biscuit and I actually liked the freshness too. When the food came out, I expected more steak for what I paid for, there should of been more. If you're looking for a lovely environment, and good food, you will pay more for the location it appears.

I went here for a lunch date on a Thursday with a good friend and my two young boys. I was impressed with the service and quality of food.1. Parking - I parked in the structure next door but I noticed that a lot of people were walking across the street if they were staying longer than 2 hours allotted by the parking structure 2. Service - our waitress was extremely patient and understanding of my two boys. She gave them their drinks first and gave me as much time as I needed to peruse the menu. I really appreciated how she gave me time and said \"I'll stay close by so you can holler at me when you want to order.\"She even picked up toys that my boys dropped on the floor! So nice! 3. Food - so so YUMMY! I love the farm to table concept of traditional Southern food with a healthy twist. I got the avocado toast with beet salad and fried eggs. It felt so good to be eating a comfort food yet somewhat healthier than I remembered. Te toast had honey on it! The biscuits? More please? I ditched my low carb mentality when I took a bite of this delicious treat with their homemade compost and honey! Even more impressive, my boys devoured their cheese sandwich and sweet potato pancakes. They are the pickiest toddlers you can run into and they loved the food! To top it off. I wished I was here at happy hour to taste their handcrafted drinks. I had the lavender limeade and I wanted to drink more than one glass.I love how the place gives homage to the military with its decor.

We didn't realize it until we got there. 2) It was already past 2 pm and most participating restaurants are a bit far, and their lunch end at 3pm. Tupelo is the closest one and they serve lunch til 4. One thing I immediately noticed when we entered was that there were no signs anywhere that they're participating in the Restaurant Week. I saw other people's  social media posts from other restaurants that show the restaurant week logo and other promotional stuff. When we sat down, they handed us their regular lunch menu. Still no mention of restaurant week. Even when the server came to our table, she never mentioned it. I had to ask for the restaurant week menu, which she had to get somewhere. I would think they would have it immediately for diners. I thought maybe the hostess and the server specifically forgot, but then I saw another couple that just sat down across our table and no mention of restaurant week. I think it's odd, though, that they would not mention it to customers. Now, let's go right into the menu. Their lunch is pretty cheap. For $10, you get an appetizer and a main dish. They also give you complimentary biscuit and blueberry compote. We enjoyed it. The biscuit is buttery and has a subtle black pepper taste. The blueberry compote is also very delicious. For my appetizer, I got the salad with pecan vinaigrette, which I really like. For my main dish, I had the Buttermilk Fried Chicken, which came with gravy and sides of fries and mac-n-cheese. This was disappointing for a number of reasons. The chicken was overcooked, hence, a bit chewy and dry. It's seasoned well but I couldn't really enjoy it because it's very dry. The mac-n-cheese, which looks like leftovers, is bland. The only decent thing on this dish is the fries. My husband ordered the Chicken Gumbo Ya-ya. It was good, but not great nor memorable. His entree was the Grateful 'Veg' Burger, which is black bean burger with caramelized onions, some mixed greens and aioli. I had to try it. It's my very first veggie burger. I don't have anything to compare it with since it's my first time trying it, but it reminds me of southwestern egg roll. I liked it, so did my husband. We didn't order any dessert from the regular menu since we're saving some room for other food we wanted to try from other participating restaurants. They, however, gave each of us a spoonful of their banana pudding to sample. It's delicious. If we do come back, we'd love to order their banana pudding. $20 for the amount of food that was served isn't bad. We were told that the food on their restaurant week menu is a half-portion of the actual servings. I guess it makes sense since the price is cheap. The quality of the food, on the other hand, is at best 2.5/5."}, {"review_id": "MqDPhzZ4vYE7FJsjBBoovQ", "user_id": "UzORoQ_fU_IOneGWx_wpVw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/3/2017", "text": "Decided to come here for appetizers. Tupelos has a small plate menu but I learned that this is not available on Fridays so we just orders starters from the regular menu. My friend had the pimento cheese nachos. They looked delicious. Our waiter said they make the cheese and even fry the chips. I opted for a more healthy choice, roasted sweet baby carrots. Although they didn't look as good as the nachos, they were yummy. We tried grilled okra. I'll admit, not a favorite. I'll stick to the fried stuff. If you plan to frequent this restaurant often, download the free app to earn points towards rewards.
