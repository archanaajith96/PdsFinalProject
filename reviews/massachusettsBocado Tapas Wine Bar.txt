Had friends visiting from out of town and thought this would be an awesome place to take them and show them a bit of Worcester. Well we were wrong. Made a reservation for 7:15, we weren't sat til 8pm. I understand on a busy night maybe having to wait 10-15 mins for a reservation, but 45!? Not acceptable. We kept being told \"your table is paying now..\" yeah, right.. Sangria was as good as always and authentically Spanish. Food to die for but service was slowwwww. Our server was great, it was the kitchen that was so ridiculously slow. We waited 20+ minutes at times in between tapas coming out. We didn't expect our Bocado \"experience\" to include tons of waiting around and a 3 hour dinner. We enjoy our friends company but we all got bored after a while! By the time the paella came out, we asked for it to be packaged up and got the check. It was 10pm. Unacceptable and we probably won't be returning, it's seriously not worth it IMO. Posted 12/15Absolute amazing experience. 4 of us went on a Tuesday night around 7. It was slow at first then filled up. Our waitress was lovely and very helpful with menu choices. We shared a pitcher of the homemade sangria which was delicious. They only have one beer on tap and it's a Spanish beer, but they have popular beers in bottles.We did the 4 person Bocado experience which was the best thing we could have done. We got a cheese plate which had 2 cheese and 2 meats and bread. One of our options was the fried goat cheese coated in honey which was one of the best things my taste buds have ever come in contact with. Then, we each chose 2 appetizers we wanted to try and shared everything. We were not disappointed with anything we ate. The shrimp sliders were unique, fresh, and delicious. We also got the steak large dish instead of the paella. It came out last but I wish it came out first because it was so good and we were so full we could barely eat it! But we had nice leftovers.I'm a big dessert person but I didn't love the desserts that came with the experience, however everyone in my party sure did. I can't wait to return and order new items and also have the ones we loved again. Thanks for a wonderful experience, Bocado!"}, {"review_id": "aiNOEi42T0KQJe0TvQSUig", "user_id": "803QFz_8yYC0C8mqpPZEKg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "This is the third place i visited during restaurant week. I mostly have good things to say about this establishment & will definitely dine here again!we got the experience for 2 @ $50 (restaurant week prices), that includes 3 Tapas (small dishes), a small paella, & a choice of dessert. This is a GREAT deal. The service was very good and i was able to be seated immediately , even with a large crowd. I enjoyed the food, drinks were great but what stood out the most has to be the atmosphere of the restaurant. Decor/music is amazing.i would've gave this place a 5 star but the menu is very confusing/hard to understand.

The bar area gets pretty lively at night so they section if off for people who wants more of a dining experience in the other rooms. Brilliant layout. Even though the place could be every bit as great as the reviews say, for me it was subpar at best.Patatas Asadas- A full plate of nicely roasted potatoes drizzled in a sauce that tasted like melted American cheese. For a tapas place, eh. Albóndigas De Cerdo- The pork meatballs cooked in wine with figs and bleu cheese wasn't terrible.Estofado de Pollo Picante- This plate of buffalo chicken with cheddar polenta and crumbled bacon was an odd combination of flavors.Pecho de Res Cocido- Braised beef brisket soaked in it's own sauce with mashed yukon was okay.Churros y Chocolate- Stale fried dough, no thanks.Overall Service: The server wasn't really helpful or attentive and charged us for the wrong bill which was corrected after we brought it to their attention."}, {"review_id": "Ouit036c3CLVLweSjdLrpQ", "user_id": "xirjSwnrFjF87rYT97EG4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/17/2017", "text": "Preface: expensive!!

The atmosphere inside was perfect for a Friday night and everyone was friendly. We did not make reservations and just sat at the bar. The bartender (at the second bar to the right) was knowledgable and made great recommendations. We were starving, so we ordered quite a few dishes for two people (don't judge). The dishes ordered were queso de cabra con miel (fried goat cheese with honey), vieiras con trufa y tocino (bacon wrapped scallops with white truffle honey, and red pepper flakes), mejillónes salteados con tomate (sautéed mussels tossed with garlic, sundried tomato, basil, cracked black pepper, white wine and cream), chuletas de cordero (grilled lollipop lamb chops with rosemary mustard oil), fried rice balls, and many drinks. I was blown away by all the savory dishes. Every bite was mouthwatering. I wish we came with more people, so we could try more dishes (like the paella). The fried goat cheese dish with honey was hands down my favorite! I was not a goat cheese lover, but I definitely am now. I could've eaten the whole order myself. Drinks were strong and delicious too! There were so many too choose from it was hard to decide. They even have wine flights! Love this place. If you haven't been to Bocado's yet, you must go. Go now, bring a date, go yourself, or bring the family (ok maybe not kids or babies, but I saw a couple with a newborn so...)!"}, {"review_id": "GxhfoYTRdcNkRtk6tmxl1Q", "user_id": "s_P7ilpDaSsib7SYxDwGDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "Not only was our food amazing, our Waiter Des was outstanding.

Who knows how long they leave the bottles sitting before the wine arrives to your glass. I love the idea of a wine flight, so we did that and had 8 different wines between us; all Spanish origin and Rioja. As we had feared, all the of the wines, except for one, tasted as if they had been open for a couple of days. We didn't even finish our wines and decided to leave instead. If they can't keep the wines rotating so they're fresh, then they need to pare down the wine list so that you don't end up drinking something halfway to vinegar.

We had reservation for 8:30 and were seated immediately. I have to say that this place picks up much later in the evening. At 8:30 it was more than half empty; by 9:30 it was packed. The food was overall very good. We did the \"bocado experience for 2\". I ordered a pomegranate martini and it was very good. We had the fried goat cheese and salchichon for the charcuterie course. The goat cheese was absolutely amazing and our waiter said it was one of their most popular choices. For the tapas we tried the mushrooms over polenta (10/10, amazing), the brisket (9/10), the mussles (7/10), and the lamb lolipop (5/10). I know a lot of people raved about the lamb, but it was just ok to us. The mushrooms and the brisket are a must though. For Paella, we chose the classic and it was just ok. It felt like it was left in the oven too long because some of the rice pieces were very crunchy which really took away from the experience of eating it. Also, my second drink took a really long time to come out (it came out with dessert even though I ordered it with the last tapas before the paelle course). When it came out it was really good though. Also, the service was very nice and friendly and the atmosphere was excellent. We sat in one of the booths in the back with the throw pillows. On a side note, the little parking lot across the street was coned off and empty. We were able to find parking on the next street without an issue though.We will be coming back here again for sure. Next time we will skip the paella though and go with extra tapas."}, {"review_id": "3QGmSoHYHL2hxuPeCk6JQg", "user_id": "nvhtiSX2uEgiIqbAfxXXag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/24/2017", "text": "First time trying out Spanish foods and I absolutely love it!
