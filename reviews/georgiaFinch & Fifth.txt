I am so impressed with the charcuterie choices and the quality! You get to make your own cheese plate. You choose from the proteins first, and then the cheeses. I chose the salmon and the beehive cheese. While I did not really taste the lavender in the cheese, the salmon was absolutely wonderful! It literally melted in my mouth like a fine butter! The two choices came with sliced apples, an apricot jam, and honey and sliced almonds. It also was accompanied by three different types of crackers. It was fun trying the different bites and textures. There was not a bad bite! I also had the cranberry margarita! Wow! I will be back!If you haven't been here, what are you waiting for?!?"}, {"review_id": "8Ep8Rs1REoHTgElBQoxrPw", "user_id": "iNdj-vYPXmJ88LXPZqGpGA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "The Surrey Center is second only to downtown for being a hotspot for restaurants and places to find a good drink. Finch and Fifth are a great example of that. Though I enjoy their evening meal options, let me cut to the chase. Come here for the appetizers and drinks. You want a drink after work, but don't want the noise and crowded feel of a bar? Come here. You want to start the weekend off with a nice cocktail or maybe a nice variety of cheeses? Come here. A intimate and calming atmosphere, with a friendly team ready to serve. Give it a try!*Insider's Tip-Every Monday is half off bottles of wine (red and white). What better way to start your week?-Every Wednesday is half off the charcuterie boards. Depending on the size of your appetite, that could be a meal."}, {"review_id": "j-BGYf62p99_VyX4deNwLQ", "user_id": "sQprifSsJD-dwP8EXCvMkA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/16/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I have been to Finch & Fifth before and had much better experiences, but this visit stood out enough to warrant a review. Went for my birthday dinner with three others over the weekend and ended up spending over two hours at the restaurant & missing a substantial portion of my own birthday party that followed.The Good: The food was delicious- their charcuterie boards are always yummy and fresh, and they had great meat and cheese options with great house-made accompaniments. The scallops with mushroom risotto and meatloaf were equally stellar.Additionally, our server and the manager on duty, Shelley, were very pleasant and did their best to make our dinner a positive experience. The Bad: Almost an hour after arriving at the restaurant and 25 minutes after placing orders, my friend was informed that the special he had ordered was no longer available. The meal that he was recommended as a substitute ended up costing almost $10 more than his original entree, but he was not informed of this until he received his check.We were only asked for drink orders twice; the second time took almost an hour and required indication on our part. I ordered the Blueberry Mint Mule, which, although sumptuous, came for the second round in a standard glass instead of the copper mug. The issue here was that both my friend and I had sent back Mule mugs from our first round, but the server said they were out of the mugs. Two minutes later, we saw another table receive their Mule in a copper mug.The food took 56 minutes to begin arriving at the table, and the replacement entree was the first to reach the table. My \"entree\" (I chose an appetizer to accompany the large charcuterie board), a bowl of chili, came after all other entrees. Around this time, we heard from the table next to us that they had been waiting 20 minutes without even seeing their server or getting to place a food or drink order.At this point, we spoke to Shelley, who took our concerns in stride and advocated for us by talking to several workers about the delays and offering us a discount and a birthday dessert. We are appreciative of her willingness to accept responsibility and begin making changes, but we still unfortunately had to wait almost 20 more minutes for checks and another 10-15 minutes to be cashed out.As mentioned, the food was delicious, and past visits have not warranted this level of service; but given the dropped balls across the board with serving time, food/drink replacements, and overall wait times, the experience left me very discouraged and feeling less like a happy birthday girl. I hope this was just a fluke night for them and not a new precedent in service."}, {"review_id": "4uzjAJCof64xV-aWOX5mnA", "user_id": "NlooEt8bskHLSnQwpuZZFg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Why has it taken me so long to try their brunch? It hit the spot. Chicken and waffles were perfect! Eggs Benedict were great too! The (complimentary) biscuits and jam to start with locally roasted Buona coffee was the right way to start.

I was on the hunt for something different to celebrate my dad's birthday, so I turned to Yelp. After browsing a few different places, I decided Finch & Fifth looked promising! I made a reservation for 6:15 on a Saturday and we were seated immediately when we arrived. We were greeted with some waters and then our waiter made his way over to take our drink orders. We arrived during happy hour, so all of their wines, cocktails, and beers were half off! We started with the boiled peanuts, Soppressata, and the Red Dragon from the charcuterie and cheese menu. All of it was perfect! The portions were plenty for the table of 4 to munch on while we waited for our meals. I ordered the lamb chili + cast iron cornbread while others at my table ordered the meatloaf, buttermilk pork chop, and the tomato bacon brie sliders. Everything came out around the same time and everything was GREAT! The strawberry butter with the jalapeno cornbread was a unique side for the lamb chili, and the collards received rave reviews! We didn't save room for desert since we were going back home to a chocolate cheesecake, but we will definitely check it out in the future! Our service was prompt, even though they were slammed, and the restaurant has an intimate feel!"}, {"review_id": "jWslkmMzHr5RQt5kKkNyKA", "user_id": "gh6ZR8r00aYgrf2wKggdwQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "I really like Finch & Fifth. I like their wine selection. I like their servers. I like their charcuterie. I like that I can dine inside or outside. I've dined here several times. Twice for \"real meals\" and several times for wine and cheese. It is nice to have the option for something light or a regular size meal. Steak is good, pork belly tacos are very good, pork chop is yummy, and my husband likes the meatloaf and fried okra.  The last time we were there they had this AMAZING brûléed Brie cheese special. We devoured it. I also really appreciate that they don't have the same old wine that I can get any where else. This is probably my favorite place to dine in Surrey Center."}, {"review_id": "7rxbhvMktJA2jqTAKuMvkA", "user_id": "tvn6_ztq_zRxb0blOOogxg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "My wife and I love this place. It is one of our go to spots in Augusta. Great food and great service. The ambiance is really cool as well. On Wednesday's they have happy hour til 7pm (half off specialty drinks and wine) and half off their charcuterie board items all evening. Great deal for excellent food. My wife and I love the shrimp and grits and the mushroom risotto (add scallops).

Since I'm a longtime fan of Atlanta's Holeman and Finch, I just had to try Finch and Fifth. It was swamped on a Friday night; no surprise there. I snagged the last spot at the bar and dove head first into their drink menu. Loved their signature drink menu but went with their margarita which was not memorable. That's ok F&F, your menu was over the top! I toiled for what seemed like hours but was actually 5 minutes, with so many delicious choices: meat loaf, buttermilk pork chops, and mushroom risotto...oh my,  white truffle  mushroom risotto with grilled scallops? ...That's the ticket! First bite: scallop...cooked and seasoned to perfection. Second bite: creamy al dente risotto, cooked (but not) seasoned to perfection. Since I'm trying to watch my sodium, I took it all in stride. Ate every bite but still needed more chow. Had to try the Tomato Bacon and Brie sliders. Anytime I get a shot at Wagyu beef, I take it. These were simply outstanding! If you live here, it's a no brainer to try F&F. Live in Atlanta  traveling back from I-20, well worth the stop."}, {"review_id": "H0dx57XLD-GXA3j8fybiwA", "user_id": "DutVKv2_Orvh9qG1uUOgsg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "amazing.

The service both times I've been here has been great and the inside has a really unique feel to it. The first time here was with my book club. We were with a larger group and it was a little hard to hear with the size of the group, so will have to remember that when coming with a larger group. I just tried a few cheeses and the peanut butter pie and both were so so good. Last Saturday we just had drinks (blue cheese-stuffed olives are enough to make me want to come back for a martini) and creme brulee, which was a smaller serving but hit the spot. The bartender was great and we enjoyed sitting and having conversations with him throughout the night.

So many great options to choose from on the menu, I've stuck to the eggs and steak thus far never disappointed.Happy hour, you can not beat craft made cocktails with top shelf liquor.

My group stopped through Augusta while traveling for work and were thoroughly impressed. The most outstanding aspect of our visit was the service. Our waitress (whose name I wish I remembered to mention) was bubbly and quite attentive to one member of our group's precise allergy needs. At the end of our meal, we were also surprised to see another employee come out with free salami samples for us to try - a really nice touch.That's not to say that Finch & Fifth's fare is anything short of fantastic - it is! Our drinks were quite tasty - two of us got Royal Russians and the others Limongrias, and both options were refreshing and delicious. The bread that came with our tasty beet hummus was soft and succulently warm. After that, the entrée I went with was the special breaded macaroni and cheese with crawfish, which was about the creamiest and most delectable version of that classic that I've ever eaten. Finch & Fifth was a perfect place to unwind after work with friends. I would return in a heartbeat.
