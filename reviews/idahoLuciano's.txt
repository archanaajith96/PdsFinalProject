Service's like so wonderful! They treat you like an extended family member. There's no sense of overly posh kind of feel to it. In other words, they make you feel like you're in a relatives' home.3. The food, oh the food. My wife ordered the carbonara and I ordered the Veal Picata(in an attempt to compare theirs' and Gino's). Their veal picata is so evenly flavored, no over powering flavor from the lemon, capers nor veal. Everything was cooked to match each another in a wonderful medley of flavors. The carbonara does not have the overpowering flavor of bacon or sauce to it. Evenly flavored would be the right words to describe it.Well, it's a place that I would definitely come back to and probably, never be tired of.Thanks Luciano's."}, {"review_id": "lbiQTsWWG586yattdV0z0g", "user_id": "SEPSy_TUicGdTg-_72aOmQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "First let me say the service we received here was phenomenal! I was here in a moderately sized group that did not coordinate appropriately on timing. Needless to say we had a reservation but some in our group were 30 minutes late. We were able to wait at the bar and then when our table was ready we were quickly seated. The fresh baked bread you receive is highly addicting, it's hard to stop eating it! I was getting fat on bread before I even had the chance to order. I ended up ordering the eggplant parm and my boyfriend got the house special for the evening. His was veal with a gravy on top of what appeared to be onion rings. His veal was cooked perfectly however the rest of the dish was lackluster. My eggplant Parmesan was alright, however I regret not ordering something else. When it came down to it, it was mostly an oversized plate of spaghetti. Next time I will definitely get something else. We did order dessert. Definitely the highlight of the night! We ordered a turtle cheesecake and it was mouth watering delicious. This restaurant is extremely nice and would definitely recommend for celebratory dinner or a romantic evening. The waiting list for walk in costumers is usually upward 45 minutes on a weekend night so I would recommend calling ahead. Overall I enjoyed the meal and would come back for the fantastic service!"}, {"review_id": "C1Fmy95fNsNu-l2ul9wygQ", "user_id": "2rGipm0hhF0Kskf0YHlWug", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/12/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The food here is always top notch and the service usually great, but this trip was an exception. Both of our girls ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and the younger wouldn't eat it because the meatballs were spicy. I tried them and they were! I told the server and she said \"yeah they are sometimes, it's the Italian sausage\". It really surprised me that 1) a server wouldn't warn people ordering something from the KIDS MENU that it is spicy and 2) that she wouldn't offer something else. We also had a friend join us about 20 minutes into our arrival that planned to order food, however when the server never acknowledged her at all she decided to get food elsewhere."}, {"review_id": "ZG56vObv-DH3aHm4NqAvqQ", "user_id": "VkIRLDYPBtyg6uDgMFIFiA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Went there for an anniversary dinner. Called ahead and was promptly seated upon arrival. Service was good as our waiter was knowledgeable and prompt.    I'm not super knowledgeable on wine and our waiter brought us a few samples based off of our taste we described and we went for the house cab and it was good and reasonably priced.    Ordered calamari as an appetizer and it was decent but unremarkable, but satisfying for the price point.     My girlfriend ordered the clam linguini and added crab to it and I ordered the veal piccata. The garlic bread included in the entrees was good but that's where the enjoyment ended. The linguini was very oily and the seafood tasted cheap and frozen. My veal tasted like bad chicken fried steak; tough, over breaded and bland. The piccata of it was overwhelming lemony with a giant lemon on top to further add to that.    Informed the waiter that, the veal, wasn't very good. Without any questions he took it away and asked if I wanted to see the menu again which I declined. He followed up by asking if we wanted desert which I again declined.     We stomached the remainder of the linguini and cashed out after waiting longer than we'd have liked to.     Service was good, ambiance was great but the good missed the mark leaving me regretting going and would have rather paid for Olive Garden or better yet cooking as home as the food was no better than what I could have bought from winco."}, {"review_id": "t3RLLsCKt6x0aVzODYd-yQ", "user_id": "RGJ3UrTouNKj-tzW5Awwxg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/12/2017", "text": "I have absolutely nothing bad to say about Luciano's. This is my favorite Italian place to go in Boise. Yes the wait is long, but it's very worth it. I've found that the best time to go is in the afternoon. You still have the dinner menu, without the wait. Either way, dinner or lunch, it's amazing. Things Mr. Euro (fiancé) and I like to order:The Seafood Risotto Or FettucciniAthena Chicken (extra feta) The Ravioli Veal PicattaEven the Caesar salad is yummy.

Calamari.  All we could say was \"wow!\"  Lightly breaded tender chunks of deliciousness.The menu is made up of those items you would expect from an Italian restaurant.  Started with a Caesar Salad with anchovies.  Decided to keep it basic as I personally judge an Italian joint by their Pasta Bolognese and it didnt dissapoint.  The Bolonese was hearty and flavorful... well done!My daughter ordered the Lobster Bisque soup... sorry to say I can't personally report on the taste as she wouldn't let me near it.  From the barrier she erected around her bowl of soup to keep me away I assumed it was accepted .The wife got the Eggplant Parmesan with pasta and given the fact that what's mine is mine and what hers is mine, I did get a bite.  The eggplant was lightly breaded and well seasoned - however, it was a bit \"tough\" or not as tender as i would expect.We ended our adventure with two desserts, White Chocolate Cheesecake and Chocolate Cake.  Both of these desserts were delicious and finsihed our meal perfectly.A huge appology to Lucianos, sorry we missed you before, thanks for having us.  We plan on returning soon as you have become our favorite Italian joint in Boise."}, {"review_id": "JEMJVDXtZY_cv_2QaSMitw", "user_id": "4MI9Pfc7dgCQcJtF1qpcWQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Great food, wine, service, and atmosphere.

Dinner always begins with bread. Simple, right? Only no. It arrives at one's table appearing just like your average, ordinary, every day sort of bread. Fair enough, you'll think. Just a little something to tide me over until the main event arrives. Perhaps I'll indulge in a slice. I could take it or leave it, really. And, then you take a bite and every sound--the low din of mindless chatter, the forks lightly scraping plates, all of it--ceases. And, it's just you and that bread. How to describe it...You know the smell of bread baking? That wonderful scent that transports one to a simpler time. Maybe it's your grandmother's house or a beloved aunt's. But, the very scent of it is utterly transcendental. And, no matter how delicious the bread is, it's almost, but never quite, as wonderful as that gorgeous scent. This, my people, is the bread that scent has always been alluding to. This bread. It's the bread that tastes as good as baking bread smells. No need to keep seeking the end of rainbows, friends. I've found the pot of gold. And, it comes in a bread basket.So, now the challenge becomes saving room for the main event.And, not frantically waving down the server when the bread basket runs empty. Because, people....there's more to come.I have tried several of their pastas. All delicious. My favorite? Their Fettuccini Alfredo with a salmon filet added. Also? Get some of their Italian red wines. Ask for a recommendation, if you must. But, really, the Italians are doing some great and wonderful things with their grapes. Or, if you'd rather something more local, they offer Proletariate Wines of Walla Walla on tap.  It's a busy spot with very little space inside for waiting (they even installed a tent outdoors to make a comfortable space for overflow). Fortunately for Yelpers, though, you can go to Yelp app and get put on the list for a table before you even leave the house by clicking \"waitlist\" on their Yelp page.The question is...will there bread be waiting on my table?I can only hope...Get to it!"}, {"review_id": "409WL2w-oohL8TvfipsXYA", "user_id": "Y-fPeP9dmciMYg83esNSWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/30/2017", "text": "I drove by Luciano's for years without ever setting foot in it.

Yes, yes, yes.The Food:As soon as you sit down you are greeted with a giant roll of focaccia bread with balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil to hold you over while you peruse the menu. Oh, the options on their menu. All of them look so delicious. But being a creature of habit, I always order the fettuccini alfredo. Al dente noodles, creamy sauce, and all of the slurpyness you could hope for in a bowl of pasta. It. Is. Divine. *But beware: It is extemely filling. You will need to take a nap afterward.

Tonight it was just my husband and me, so I was much more on alert. I can say our meals were both delicious. Our Waiter was terrific. I only have 2 negatives; first of all I think the thin brown paper is a bit tacky and gets oil splattered and icky so that you don't want to put your arms on it. Maybe use the thicker white paper if you have to. I understand wanting to be frugal on washing and hygiene. Which brings me to my 2nd and final complaint. I think you need to consider seat protectors in the ladies room, not hygienic. Other than these two items, we had a wonderful time and probably come back for the lobster next time.
