Their iced tea is top notch.. I don't know what's in it, but I'm addicted. I'm also obsessed with My Wife's Salad.. whoever's wife it belongs to has great taste. Arugula, Mozzarella, Tomatoes, Avocado and Balsamic Vinaigrette. AND it's actually a good size! Not too big, not too small. Just right. It doesn't get any better. I tried the Chicago style hot dog this time because I wanted something classic, and can't wait to try the Korean one next time! Those pickled cucumbers are calling my name. I'm also going to have to give that Lobster BLT a go sometime, too. Yay!"}, {"review_id": "ElWd6coE-tP9DrbCcc-vtw", "user_id": "SYmQ1fmU0bddymmbjWitpw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "I've been to Senate more times than I can count, had dozens of \"Dogs of the Days\", had their burgers, mussels, lobster BLT, pigtails, BBQ sandwich, every variant of french fries, and more. Never once has Senate disappointed me. There is a reason this restaurant kicked of a wave of excitement in OTR and two blocks of foodie heaven. Every element is perfectly planned and executed, from the architecture to the decor to the staff, and on to the food, cocktails and beer list. If this is your first time eating in Over the Rhine you can't do better than try this place and see why OTR is the epicenter of good eats in the Midwest.For a first visit, I recommend the Korean Dog or the Dog of the Day with a side of duck fat fries (extra aioli please!) and one of their fantastic cocktails or a local craft beer on draft. When you come back (which you'll want to do) try the burger or the poutine. But regardless, come here, you will not regret it."}, {"review_id": "3k_1w9mvRpusHCC0eLQgVQ", "user_id": "IrJyYQUx15JE7vHW2jCXTA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "OH how I love Senate. From their creative hot dogs... which are an entire entree, to my favorite poutine in the city, to the great cocktails! On my most recent visit I had my favorite, the poutine, minus the egg (not my thing). The ratio of fries to short rib, cheese curd, and gravy is perfect so as to not soggy the fries. The portion is generous and enough to share or for one person as their meal. Notable, the mussels here are to die for. My Fidel Castro cocktail was sublime! Others had various hot dogs, which really, you cant go wrong with any of them. ALWAYS ask what the hot dog of the day is, its usually an especially unique and tasty creation. This place is always always crowded, and its for a reason. Despite being busy the service is always great! I recommend putting in your name on the no wait app ahead of time for easier seating, no matter your group size. We had 5 on a Saturday night and the app got us in less than an hour. There is seating at the bar, but usually that is taken as well."}, {"review_id": "6x0F7GVG7rSplXXvKwHL5g", "user_id": "zjrZPV_8hjdwC2d_V6xlWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "SENATE.Sublime.Epic.Nomz.Authentic.Titillating.Extra.  The OG Senate; it's been my go-to locale for amazing meals since 2011, staple in my out-of-town guest tours, and one of my most referred restaurants for coworkers. At the core of OTR's revitalization for years it remains a welcome place for unique cocktails, quality creative dishes, and quirky themed hot dogs. This location is bursting with personality and authenticity--aligned with all the other amazing Daniel Wright creations.Don't miss out on their IG page where daily specials are sometimes featured (I'm looking at you Steak & Shake inspired Frisco Melt, Lenten Lobster Roll, Crab Rangoon Poutine, Olympic Themed Dogs)...but arrive early if you desire The Dog of the Day, once they run out of the specialty ingredients...it's done (always a heartbreaking moment, but you can easily cry your tears into one of the other top notch menu staples). Trailer Park, Lindsay Lohan, Poutine, Truffle Fries, My Wife's Salad, Crispy Potstickers, Lobster Mac & Cheese, Warm Pretzel Beignets & Caramel Mascarpone, Chocolate & Bourbon Bread Pudding (personally my favorite dessert in ALL of town)--try them all! I highly recommend coming with people willing to share so you can sample as much as possible.Service is top notch, great place to sit at the bar and banter with their friendly staff and right in the middle of all the Over-the-Rhine action. Worth the sometimes long wait--pass the time at the local shops and drinkeries and you will be glad you didn't settle."}, {"review_id": "MUYkGPydr6irwEjj9JEaAQ", "user_id": "eG1Tur78lGPRLPysNSzadQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/12/2017", "text": "I just love places like this; take a simple concept and elevate it to new heights. Of course it's easier said than done. At Senate, taking center stage is the old American favorite, the hotdog. Of course there are many other options including mussels, a ribeye, or the senate burger(which I hear is phenomenal), but honestly the dogs are what most are here for. Heck I don't even care for hotdogs yet I find myself here; these aren't your ordinary dogs. You pair hotdogs with fun names like Trailer Park, Lindsey Lohan, and Hello Kitty with ingredients like wasabi mayo, goat cheese, and a poached egg, you have yourself something special. Each dog is hand crafted and stacked sky high with layers of toppings. The decision on which one to get is enough to raise this guys stress level. As if that decision wasn't hard enough, why would you force a person to choose between duck fat fries, truffle fries, or poutine? That's not cool....at all. Came here for the dogs, but fell in love with the fries. Both the truffle fries and poutine are absolute perfection."}, {"review_id": "yRev4tmT0zbjqp3M-ksK2g", "user_id": "fiScG_wgq8KIDrKAlcGuiA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Your craving for hot-dog can now be satisfied without going to Great American Ballpark!

As a side, he ordered truffle fries which he let me try.  Oh my goodness, such hot, fresh and deliciousness!Since I am cutting back on gluten, I had their poutine.  Besides the standard fries, cheese curds and gravy, they top it with braised shortribs and opted mine to be topped with a poached free range egg.  Very tasty.  It's one of the best poutines I've tried.  Maybe it's me, but doesn't everything taste better topped with a poached egg?It was kind of crowded at the bar and they need more hooks under the bar so that you can hang your purse (or umbrellas that we brought since it was supposed to rain).  It was a positive experience so we will probably be back."}, {"review_id": "fPYiVUU6-jnCUYDz66micA", "user_id": "mzWDh8sXh2MTMTBjGflQfw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Went there with my wife last night, greeted by a friendly hostess, with only a short wait at 9:00.

We have been coming here for a couple years and it never disappoints.This next sentence is VERY important: You just always order the mussels. The broth is so good I would drink it with a spoon. Seriously, one time we brought our own to-go container so we could take the extra broth home and eat it with bread. (They don't have to-go containers for liquid!) Go ahead and ask for extra grilled bread when you order them because the sauce is that good. The quality of the mussels they use are also great as they are large, meaty and tender. My husband doesn't love loaded hot dogs so he has tried the burger, the grilled cheese and the lobster BLT. As is the trend here everything is a really great quality and well prepared.I usually order the dog of the day or the Mexico City and you can't go wrong with any of them. The buns are delicious and although some of them are very hard to eat it is always worth the effort.If you managed to save room both desserts are delicious but I am usually too stuffed!"}, {"review_id": "p7ASmb-pAZQCEWVQnWzgXg", "user_id": "O_5ChJiwxgoOyuWit6EqJg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "Stopped in on a Friday for lunch.  I ordered the Trailer Park, my guy ordered the Senate burger and we shared an order of fries (FYI, on Friday you can get fries fried in bacon fat, yum!)  We were sat at the bar and it really wasn't too crowded, the atmosphere is wonderful and the bartender was an entertaining guy.What can I say about the Trailer Park, the dog itself was delicious with a pop to the casing.  The coleslaw was very flavorful, add to it the bacon, cheese and grippos, it was an explosion of flavor.The Senate Burger was huge and so delicious, the house made pickles were to die for, such great flavor and while it's sloppy to eat the burger, it's worth the mess.The bacon fries and aioli were divine, amazing and freaking delicious.  We will be back for more!"}, {"review_id": "9ds2lnbG63SgrPUBHB3jIg", "user_id": "Gr6V0kMPT8ITsPSFREeKXQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/14/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Just.
