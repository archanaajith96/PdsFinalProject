It's hard to mention Newark and the Ironbound without talking about Krug's Tavern. In business since 1932, and found on Wilson Ave., a street now predominantly known for its many Brazilian and Portuguese bakeries, cafes, groceries, and restaurants, Krug's still stands out like a delicious sore thumb.There's not much to say about Krug's without sounding redundant. They've timelessly been voted as one of the best burgers in NJ, with good reason. Called the perfect burger, I assure you it's an experience you won't forget. The burger patty, if you can even call it a patty, is in itself something to behold. It's more of an abnormally huge, hunky, juicy, DELICIOUS glob of meat, scantily held together by its buns. The reason for Krug's success? Consistency over the years. A perfect burger is only as good as its ingredients, and that means a great local butcher (Ray's Enterprises in Newark).If you haven't been to Krug's yet, shame on you! No search for the best burger in NJ is complete without paying Krug's Tavern a visit."}, {"review_id": "00fgvBkU19_jCEizoF6D3Q", "user_id": "ypg0FdxgEcDdYP6nYBcq0g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "This is a classic divey bar with a good greasy burger.

The only downside is if it's packed and the parking lot is full you have to find street parking.

Dive Bar - throwback an era gone by - reasonably priced big Giant Burgers - local crowd in a old area of Newark that hasn't changed too much all the superlatives that go with it.  Let us get down to the nuts and bolts of it.      Haven't been down here in 20 years and it is exactly as I remember it with the old style tavern actually looking much better inside than from outside.    Long narrow bar with tables along the bar wall then the inside room in the back where you can put about another 50 patrons.   TV's behind wall in bar area and basically the old style Pub / Tavern that is simply not around these parts much. Settle in at High Top Bar table provided menu's which has been described here multiple times - but \"BURGERS ARE THE THING.  We keep it simple 2 Cheese burgers -  and a basket combo of Steak Fries & Onion Rings and soft drinks.     Soft Drinks are provided and that is the last wee see of our completely overwhelmed server until the Burgers arrive 35 minutes later.  I kid you not.  I know its the day after Christmas I know they have 1 grill and 1 grill man, but they can't handle 2 burgers in 35 minutes.   1 Ordered Medium the other Med Well .... Both come out Medium Rare but after the wait I'll just eat.  Burger is HUGE and very tasty but falling apart as you eat it.   Under cooked and huge does not promote an easy dining experience.   Fries were mediocre at best while the rings were top notch.   Side of large pickle and 1 cherry pepper was interesting though there were two of us would have been nice of each of us got a pepper.   Yes I'm nit picking sorry. In short is it a Good burger $9.50 with Cheese absolutely.. tasty great quality meet.  Is it the best burger I've ever had and would I endure 35 minute wait to have it again?  I'm guessing probably not but that is my choice as I know the locals and 1st responders swear by this place.    It's good don't get me wrong but I with impossible to park area, the long wait for a simple burger unless I am simply in the area I probably personally wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again."}, {"review_id": "QPcz3MZzQ9_-PNeh9VCtKA", "user_id": "-Et18BiTN7Y8MZYv1Htkdg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "Krug's Tavern is a no frills dive bar with possibility the best burger in the state! I don't come to Newark often but this Tavern is well worth the trip.I stopped in on Thursday around 2:30 in the afternoon & I had to wait about 20 minutes for food when the bar was pretty empty. I wouldn't recommend this place for lunch if you have a half hour break, but it's great to see the food is made to order. As for the food, I ordered the Krug's \"Taylor Ham\" burger with cheese. It was awesome! I asked for medium well done, and it came out perfectly. Seemingly well done the color was grey in the middle yet still juicy. There was a little bit blood and grease oozing out of patty and onto my fingers once I took that first bite. I thought \"oh yeah, this is about get messy.\" Second thought, oh no, this is about to give me some serious heartburn!

Krugs has been around for over 85 years. I love this tavern. If you haven't,  one might consider it a dive bar with excellent burgers wings and shrimp. My regular order would be a a bacon cheeseburger with a side order of fries and shrimp scampi to split and share.Food, 3.75 stars, the burger is delicious, it is a huge I believe 12 oz burger that is prepared on the grill. It has a savory charbroiled taste to it. While it is good, I wouldn't say it is the best burger in NJ since I believe the hamburger beef they use is just your standard 80/20 beef that you can get from shop rite. But still a solid burger. The real treasure at krugs is there shrimp. They have an outstanding shrimp scampi and buffalo shrimp. Out of this world. I also think they have calamari as well which is pretty phenomenal. It keeps bringing me back.Decor: 3 stars, it's a dive bar, but less divey since they under went renovations I believe 5 years ago.  The bar area is surrounded by hdtvs to watch sporting events. I believe busiest during the nfl season. They have a few pictures of jake lamotta the boxer known as the raging bull who is the owners cousin. And they have a dining area in the back.Service: 3 stars, unfortunately, the service here is slow and it hurts me to say that since I love this place. And krugs has had slow service ever since they won best burger in NJ. The krugs staff is just overwhelmed by the amount of customers that frequent here these days. So it can take a while before you can get a food and drink order in. As well as long lead time before you get your meal."}, {"review_id": "f6Hht3g0a48iz7x2b1Zy1g", "user_id": "bcgJ5DafoqODpCaUC7lDVA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Just got back from my first time at Krugs and will definitely be back!

Seems like everyone in the front part (back is tables) is a regular Everyone buying each other drinks and saying hello to the bartenders and cooksI grabbed a table top immediately and ordered. I got wings and a burger. I didn't opt for the fries bc my server said it was already a Ton of food and was he rightJust looking at the gigantic boulder of meat they put on the grill I didn't know if that was going to be one burger or two. But alas it was one and it was great. Cooked perfectly (I got it medium) and super juicy. They call it a California burger (maybe bc it's the size of California?) I got the wings to start and they were just how I liked them. Next time maybe I'll get them a little crispier but the were perfect size and a nice almost breaded and semi crispy texture. I'm sure this place gets crowded.Someone ordered the pastrami sandwich and it was also massive. Looked great though Neighborhood feel to it for sure.

Juicy, charred, still-pink-inside burgers. I barely find good burgers. But lucky for me Krug's is that and more. I was a little hesistant. On a late afternoon the bar had a few old dudes relishing in $3 happy hour beers. The kitchen is an open one, right next to the bar. The cook had an attitude and kept reprimanding our frowning waiter... this made for a quite awkward dining experience. BUUUUTTTT the burger was worth the awkwardness AND the onion rings were DIVINE. I barely get to enjoy onion rings... they are just not a thing like they use to be so I normally settle for fries. My beau and I order both... I say skip the fries. Get two orders of onion rings.
