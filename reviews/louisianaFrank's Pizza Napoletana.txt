My mom and I each get a lunch Caesar salad and split a lunch margherita pizza. It is the perfect amount of food for us! We leave with happy and content bellies.I don't usually care for Caesar salad, but my body has come to crave this salad at Frank's! It is so so good. Always has the perfect amount of dressing and the lettuce is consistently good quality. We love topping ours with a lot of the fresh cracked pepper...yummm. One time I decided to add chicken to my salad...I would pass on this. The chicken was the one let down I've had here. We have recently started requesting to have our pizza cooked slightly longer. This is because we love the slight charred flavor from the oven. Delicious. The cheeses and toppings they use are (once again) a great quality which makes such a noticeable difference. Additional note...they have great sweet tea. I hardly ever buy a drink at restaurants because it seems like a waste of money. But their sweet tea is worth the few extra bucks."}, {"review_id": "YIXiIzWmwIVXdyythgsVNA", "user_id": "sDWrw3sxd1yMWanFmjWnhQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Looking to break away from the chain restaurants?

Our pizzas both came out with the crust black on the entire bottom and the top. The toppings tasted good by themselves but were overwhelmed by the burnt flavor of the crust. We asked the waitress and she said they were supposed to look like that because it was a wood oven. Way over priced for the quality in my opinion. The wine selection was great and I loved that they had descriptions of each."}, {"review_id": "rcI_yBmCZ10xrwuQpPzdjg", "user_id": "9dhGePWNyepzSg4_Z7GzGA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/2/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I tried Frank's again last night after work because I was craving pizza. I know I wasn't blown away by my first experience ordering to-go, so I thought dining in would be better. However, it was kinda the same, maybe worse because I had to wait close to 40 minutes for my pizza. Sad face. I knew the wait was long, especially for a Friday night, but I was alone so I thought it would somehow be faster...My favorite part from dinner was sitting at the pizza bar. It's so transparent and cool to watch people make your pizza and cook it in the firey oven! I enjoyed watching and they were very passionate about their work.I ordered the Spiedini for appetizer and wasn't that impressed. Although it comes fresh out the oven, I noticed it was so busy that it would sit on the counter enough for the dish to cool and have the cheese not melt-y (noooo). It was a bit salty for my taste so I just ate 2. It would probably go great with beer.As for Frank's pizzas: my biggest complaint is the lack of crispness on the dough. I've been to many oven baked pizza joints and really enjoy the crispy bottom of my slice. Both times I've been disappointed. The Hawaiian topping however, was really good! I appreciate the housemate mozzarella and the pineapples. The pulled pork was just okay.So my experience was meh. I love supporting local restaurants. I'd recommend Frank's to try their fun toppings. But order your pizza extra crispy!"}, {"review_id": "XWTBdJa8apFpC5AEc66nzw", "user_id": "FgweBcG4HSF5_xGijOBODQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "Our favorite place so far in the Shreveport-Bossier area. The service is always great. The food is always on point. The Caesar salad is always a win with real house-made dressing. Every pizza, except for one, was awesome.

I stopped by for lunch with my family while visiting for the holidays. I love that you can order a \"pizette\" (an adorable term for a smaller, eight inch pizza) for half the price of a regular pizza during lunch time. You can sub in/out any other ingredients they have to personalize the pizza as well. Half price (and half size) soups and salads are also available during the lunch hour. Though the food was delicious, our server was so so lovely. I never got her name, but hopefully she's there during your visit. She's a French woman, and was such a joy to talk to during our meal, not to mention very attentive!

Wanted the lighter goat cheese as opposed to mozzarella so ask for there to be more goat cheese than mozzarella on the pizza. Was not told that there would be an extra charge for that. Received pizza and it was so heavy with mozzarella that you could not even pick the pieces up and had to eat with a fork. Had the usual amount of goat cheese but mostly mozzarella. Figured that the the Pizza Kitchen staff just couldn't  remember  or deal with making it differently  so I ate it as is. Received the ticket with the extra charge for the goat cheese and brought it up to the waiter that the pizza was not as ordered and he basically treated me like I was lying and that because the pizza had been eaten there was no way to prove it and because he had explained my request to the kitchen staff but obviously they had done it correctly because of course they would not just go on autopilot and make that pizza like they usually do. I did not appreciate the way that I was treated by this waiter and will definitely think twice before going back. It's also extremely loud and very frenetic environment.  Overall not a pleasant dining experience."}, {"review_id": "MGg87RBZ1OdqMEWk8EXghw", "user_id": "QwXLJaJeLuwvSqAY8NbOvQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/16/2017", "text": "This place was nice and has all the makings of a good restaurant. The atmosphere was cool, the decor was neat; especially the wood burning stove and the staff was excellent. We had the wood oven oysters and then one of the pizzas, the Salsicca. The oysters were surprisingly better than I thought. Where my review drops to three stars is sadly the pizza. The crust was without a doubt amazing. What killed it for me was either the sauce or cheese not having enough of a... kick/bite.... it seemed something was missing. *I would come back here again and try something else, I really did like it. Unfortunately I've just had better pizza at other places thus the three star. But Franks is worth checking out.
