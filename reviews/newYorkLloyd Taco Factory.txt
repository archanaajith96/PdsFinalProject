Honestly, I wouldn't have known it was actually fish besides the fact that I ordered it myself. There was barely any of it in the taco, and the bit that was there had no taste and was far from crispy. My burrito was primarily cabbage and rice and lacked the flavor that Lloyd's is known for in this city! Arghhh! It's breaking my heart! But on the plus side, I will be back - every place has a bad night, and I've had waaaaaay too much good food here to give up so easily.

The carnitas taco was really tasty. I went to the actual restaurant for the first time yesterday and got a Dirty South Taco, which featured fried chicken. Cool concept and well-executed. My only real complaint is with the prices. 3 tacos will cost ~$10 and probably not fill you up.

Still every time I go there not feel the same when I get food from their truck. Still they have the best taco in town :) One of our friends told us they have reverse happy hour and last night we went there to try :)They have happy hours that start 9 pm. And some of their foods and drinks coming down to $5.We got the cocktails and it was pretty good but the fried chicken was the worst chicken I've ever had. It looked like they made it in the old oil. For that I give them 4 stars. But everything else there is awesome.  I love their decoration, such hipster and cool decoration. The staffs are friendly and nice. The music not so great. The bar is nice, a bit pricy which does not make sense. And they have the best nachos :)"}, {"review_id": "8fHjPMXPgkOlu_mqm-CYOw", "user_id": "uF8NL_OLEOhS3LkTO-yZ9Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/31/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "After posting my 1st review I was contacted by a representative of Lloyd's. So it shows, they do care about customer satisfaction. So we gave them another try and with this one we were quite satisfied. I had the Street Dog which brought a whole to taste and experience to eating a hot dog! I loved it! My wife got their burrito which she found to be very filling and delicious. Still there one downfall, seems to be the cheese (queso) on the nachos. Sorry, cheese is not suppose to be in an almost liquid watery form. Not a fan of their queso. But will visit Lloyds again."}, {"review_id": "qzADuQ-RiV1_tf_3JxI-qA", "user_id": "zU-i3hytX51IFSc1omG58A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Every time I come to buffalo I make sure I come here.

This place is so versatile for me in that I can pop in and sit down for a quick bite to eat, grab takeout and walk home or even come in to enjoy a few cocktails on the weekend with the wife or friends. We've had just about everything on their menu and it's all delicious. The Dirty South Burrito (extra bacon aioli and syrup) is a work of art. I strongly believe Jesus himself came down to Lloyd's kitchen, blessed it and then created the dirty south along with the crispy fish taco (extra chipotle mayo). You've entered the taco industry and made your mark a spectacular one. Never change, Lloyd!"}, {"review_id": "jje_JNDCCRNtlGxy6797Cw", "user_id": "VqCx0LwYmrT7NE1P_mU9mA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I have nothing bad to say about this place. There is something for everyone and THE FOOD IS SO GOOD!! There are chicken, beef, pork, and black bean options. They also have nachos and burritos as well.

Sounds a little crazy right? Well, we made some room in our bellies for a taco or two!We ordered to-go tacos because it was super crowded, it was definitely a spot that people liked to have drinks, hang out with friends, and eat some good food. If we had more time, I think we would have stayed and had a drink, and more food. We ordered two tacos: dirty south and skinny Thai. The skinny Thai was SO good, oh-em-gee. The tacos were legit street tacos and the perfect size after all the junk we ate. The taco shell was so delicious, flour and mini. I loved the Thai taco, great peanut taste and the tofu was perfect. Liam enjoyed the chicken and waffle taco, he lost some of his waffle though by snapping it onto the floor! haha. We ordered a side of mac and cheese but never actually ate it, which was a bummer.This is a great place for tacos, even for vegetarians! I will definitely hit up this place when we are back in Buffalo."}, {"review_id": "PmV5K_nrS3hpZds2P3Ro2Q", "user_id": "Nn9Eg7Kd9TgnjDH2YMUlsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "Fantastic local gem of a restaurant. Fresh take on tacos and burritos, unique atmosphere, locally owned. Everything is delicious. Don't expect heaping mounds of dripping food like you'd get from Moe's or Salsarita's...these are closer to authentic Mexican street food, but with an American twist. I can't really comment on the drinks because I don't drink, but the food is fantastic and the Hertel location is really fun. I'm looking forward to trying the new Main St location at some point.

They are very consistent in their quality and taste. I like how unique their tastes and flavors are. For example, instead of lettuce, they use cabbage. The corn on the cob is always very sweet with a good amount of toppings. My favorite is the Dirty South tacos and burrito since I typically enjoy combinations of sweet (via their waffle pieces and syrup) and savory. The fried fish taco is a close second. Prices are comparable to Chipotle. My only complaints are that I wish the tacos were bigger for the price ($3-4 per taco) and that the burritos have more of the Dirty South flavor to it. Sometimes the rice can hide the star of the dish.  Their Aztec brownie is also very yummy. It has a bit of a chipotle powder / paprika kick to it. Good to try but I probably would not get it again for the amount. It's about the size of a cupcake for $4. They have other dessert options too and if you're feeling soft serve, go next door to their sister storefront, Churn.  I'm not sure when this was implemented but they have a customer rewards system now. You can ask your cashier for more information when you order. Plenty of indoor, outdoor, and bar seating. I like their decor, as well.Clarification: When comparing the Dirty South taco to the Dirty South burrito, there is more of a sweet/savory balance and more flavor in the taco than that of the burrito (probably because of the rice in the burrito)."}, {"review_id": "yetnCUbbTfCWL_hL8RYrUw", "user_id": "r3lvd5rxbzH8C6MnQL8b_A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Just got back from Texas yesterday but wife wanted to hit Lloyd's for lunch today.

If you order one you will definitely still be hungry, when I used to eat at the trucks they were much bigger. I do not think the price is reasonable for how small the Taco is. I really enjoy the skinny Thai taco (I do not think it is as good as the skinny Thai burrito) and the crazy corn! I have had the nachos as well and think they are okay. The cocktails are amazing.

So happy we found this place and that they serve (house made) corn tortillas! Their tacos are great, tiny like street tacos and good! I had a taco with ground beef. I unfortunately wasn't impressed with the ground beef or the brown sauce that came on top. I'm a ground beef taco kind of person and this just didn't do it for me. The ground beef was in big chunks and slightly dry. I don't know what that brown sauce was. BUT, I also had the shrimp tostada and that was 2 ! Wouldn't change a thing!My husband had a shredded beef burrito and he loved it and so did I! Of course I had a bite. It came with black beans rice like we're used to.

The crowd isn't too loud, yet you know everyone around you is having a good time. The bar was busy with basically all of the seats around it taken (yeah, it's a full bar with awesome bartenders who like to have a good time). It's mainly communal seating, which is great for large groups. If you want some privacy, you can try getting a seat along the windows. The food overall is fairly good, nothing out of this world though. My friend did not enjoy her burrito as much as she had hoped to because they don't use ground beef - it was braised beef instead. I enjoyed my grilled chicken burrito - filled with goodness :D and I even enjoyed having the touch of cabbage in it. The menu is not too complex and you can customize your order at the register. I think what they could do to help expedite the ordering process is to perhaps add some iPads to allow the customers to enter/customize their orders before paying, or they could have us fill out sheets of paper specifying what we want - if people have questions, they can clear it with whoever is checking us out. I once had to wait on a long line and it is not surprising, especially when the person placing the order has never been to lloyd's. The good thing is that the orders are usually ready within 5 minutes - impressive!"}, {"review_id": "xWY-U198cV_dc9BwrlKsng", "user_id": "OzDlB5YUdP6bcJWd1FsngA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "I don't know what they put in there food to make you so damn addicted that you literally day dream about their burritos but don't ever change Lloyd!
