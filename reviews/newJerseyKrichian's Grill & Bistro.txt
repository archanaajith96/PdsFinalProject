Later, my Mom confided that she'd seen our server, whom I think may also be the owner, engaged in a heated tiff with the Busser, who was seemingly more into watching the Patriots' game than doing her job.  She also apparently spotted some guy who looked to be the Chef, skulking (her word) in the background.  Sounds like family dysfunction to me.  Luckily, for the most part, it didn't seem to impact the food:Seriously. Sesame-Coated Falafel, finely diced Cucumber & Tomato Salad, Arayis, aka pressed and toasted meat-stuffed pita wedges, and smoky Baba Ganouj were all DELICIOUS!  And the Muhamarra... This lovely iteration of what is essentially a roasted red pepper and ground walnut paste boasted a spicy kick that caused hubby to exclaim, \"It's the best I've ever had!\" And by his own admission, he's had a lot.  On the pretty good side, both the Filet Mignon and Luleh Kebab in our Combo Platter were cooked perfectly. This was slightly marred, however, by Chicken that was a bit dry. On the downside, the thin Pita that accompanied our food was this off putting combination of crispy and overly chewy.  And the Lamb & Beef Shawarma tasted utterly devoid of any seasoning whatsoever.  A Word About Ambience:  The dining room is spacious and clean, but am not sure how lively it gets if you're ISO a place with a festive vibe.  During a Sunday evening visit, ours was one of two occupied tables in the entire restaurant.Bottom Line:  Inedible Schawarma excepted, the food here, especially the Mezze, is clearly made with a lot of love.  Which brings me right back to all of us members of dysfunctional families.  'Cause in spite of all the drama, don't we all love each other?  Okay, I'll speak for myself.:)"}, {"review_id": "Sq5zH0EatcFYo7BFHFxD7Q", "user_id": "2OjNNLpCCGrtfQtpcbhlkg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/28/2017", "text": "Came here for lunch.We were the only 2 there.Great Lebanese food!  Super friendly service.Parking right out front!The kibbeh was to die for as was the babaganoush."}, {"review_id": "MgwNFt7LCGHrZk2bAvWZjg", "user_id": "4Ifys8_IjS_CSiqzkKK-pA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/8/2017", "text": "Went to Krichian's while in Jersey and I was very impressed by the atmosphere and the food. As an Armenian from New York, I don't have too many options for our food (besides Sevan Restaurant) so it was nice to find a place that had good food and an Armenian style.The food here is delicious. Everything tasted fresh and well seasoned and the portions were solid. I don't recommend the boregs because they're more like fried empanadas than the traditional ones made with fillo dough.All the kebabs are good and the appetizers and salads are very tasty. I loved hearing Armenian music in the background and seeing cultural paintings on the walls. I'll definitely be going back the next time I'm in Jersey."}, {"review_id": "zpz1r3CEVse7_jFubFdRYA", "user_id": "98CAH-Pmj2QrkQHu7bnroA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/30/2017", "text": "Best Armenian food I have had for long timeOwner operates the place and she is very nice"}, {"review_id": "yVJBU6-90zf4Q4CziU65rA", "user_id": "XHc773SUHXk4uZXhnA0bWQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/11/2017", "text": "Excellent felt like I drifted into the Middle East great neighborhood Restaurant.

After searching all over for one. 2) The food is Amazing! We got Monte, sujuk, pilaf, beef and chicken kabob and my favorite Luleh.3) Very Armenian. Me and my buddy were the only foreigners, rest were speaking Armenian. 4) Turkish, Armenian or Greek food are very similar. Kinda like McDonalds, Burger King, or Wendy's.

We had heard many compliments of the quality as well lower cost for AAA/aaa rated plated foods. Why does YELP not have Six Stars? This location deserves that !

The fatoush salad was so delicious, fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, herbs, lemon juice, olive oil...wow. Felt like a healthy start indeed. They served feta and olives with pita...The shwarama was the best I've ever had anywhere. The quality of the lamb, the delicate spices in a savory light gravy over tender jasmine rice with fresh herbs made this dish one to return for.The interior is clean but way too bright. A slight adjustment of the seating area and a total revamp of the lighting would make this place more in line with the quality of the food they serve. Waitress was friendly, attentive.Definitely worth the trip."}, {"review_id": "agL5opIG9Zd6d3MA3cVc9g", "user_id": "HEMzp1MQKBIyxgs5NvqbHQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/12/2016", "text": "food quite good, especially the schwarma platters, sausage and chicken, not crazy about the manti, prefer boiled turkish style  to fried. The meat pies very good and the rice with the platter perfectly cooked  with nice flavor. Portions huge , so value is very good for price.  The ambiance needs to be worked on, of course didn't help that we were the only customers for most of evening!!  but as another reviewer pointed out they need to turn down the light a bit and create a bit more of an armenian experience( whatever that is!!) I would go back but only with a someone who's all about food and doesn't care about atmosphere. I'm thinking of Toros turkish in clifton, think food is better value here but the atmosphere doesn't compare."}, {"review_id": "V9_vjjBtc4kY5mIgM3kfTA", "user_id": "-dELy6lyQR0dWUUhFIDVeQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Really good will recommend !!!

Eat lunch here at least once a month. Meat is tender and cooked the way you order. If you are hungry, order the extra skewer as its not a ton of meat.  But they pack the platters with a lot of other goodness (shepherd salad, hummus, veggies, and a pile of pilaf). And prices are more than fair. Pita bread is the only \"Con\". Seems like they use the generic store brand you could buy in a supermarket and its not even heated up for ya.  Other than that, everything else is fantastic."}, {"review_id": "O5ZgB4yd9ulOL-46fNG4Jg", "user_id": "1_K8gkLc0-mf6qdxFhbeQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/16/2015", "text": "We came on a quiet weekday evening.  We knew from the decor,  and from having been to the region,  that this place looked legit.   That oddly frumpy but wonderful combination of far East and Atlanta grandma?   That's a great sign. The place treats itself with respect,  and just a little bit of the \"over the top\"  style I saw in the near East.  The music was a great touch,  and I am now frantically googling to try and find Armenian mood music.  So groovy.   The food was,  in a word,  spectacular.   My friends in the near east are foodies,  and they took me to the best restaurants that the region has to offer.   This is on par with those restaurants.   You just don't make a baba ganoush like this without an Armenian grandma I'm the kitchen.   I'd tell you what you should try,  but it all looked good.   The kibbeh,  the mezze,  the luleh,  all of it was excellent.   Service was pleasant -  this is a family restaurant in the truest sense,  so you might have to be patient at times.   But this is Armenian food -  you should just be patient and enjoy it.   I will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "rAwES1MPvLvncWd8eSU2CA", "user_id": "0JFcW0mrTRhuh-jM-QZiCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/13/2016", "text": "We had a great time.
