It's totally worth waiting in line for one of their delicious cupcakes. I haven't met a cupcake that I didn't like. I even like some of their cupcake flavors that I normally don't like. My personal favorite is the uniporn and rainho (funfetti with bright colored icing). Also love the vanilla satin. Just wait in line and make some friends before eating some tasty tasty cupcakes."}, {"review_id": "W6dutYUIr42fMG3Iqtb-bg", "user_id": "gljACJz-NQqyDTTYUOU0lA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/5/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Skip the monstrous cupcakes and go for the OMG S'mores bar and brownies! While Georgetown cupcakes is overrun by tourists, Baked & Wired is the local bakery hot spot. For the past 5 years every time I come here, there's always a line out the door even during the weekdays or if it's raining! I feel like the S'mores bar are worth waiting for. I was hooked on S'mores bar a few years ago, it's sinfully delicious! From the bottom up, the bar starts with a crispy graham cracker crust, then gooey caramel, fluffy marshmallow topped off with a nice layer of ganache. It melts right now my mouth as every bite is bursting with complex flavors. As much as I love the S'mores bar, I'm underwhelmed by the muffin like cupcakes. First off, they are honestly too big and really messy to eat. I hate eating cupcakes with a fork. When I try to ravenously bite into them, it's hard to get the perfect bite. They are so big that my fiancee and I struggled to eat half of our two cupcakes. I had the Dirty Chai and Tessita cupcakes, and was unimpressed by both. I grew up drinking chai tea, so I was excited to try it! I was expecting to taste spices with bold expresso frosting. To my disappointment, the cake consistency reminded me of carrot cake minus the carrots. Where were the spices? While the cake was moist, it wasn't flavorful. The expresso frosting really missed the mark, it was way to sweet and sugary. The Tessita fared a bit better than the Dirty Chai. I wasn't a big fan of the dark chocolate hazelnut frosting, it had a coconut flavor and I was expecting more a ganache frosting. The vanilla cake was a bit dense and I wish there was more dulce de leche caramel filling. The flavors didn't work that well together. Honestly if you want a gourmet cupcake, go to Georgetown Cupcake and order off the daily and monthly specials menu, the Salted Caramel Chocolate Chip, Sticky Toffee Pudding, and Cookies and Cream cupcakes are my favorites. Another issue that I have with Baked & Wired is the weird layout. The store is really small and it's impossible to get a panoramic glance of all the cupcakes and baked goods in their dome glass cases before ordering. How can I decide what I want before ogling over all those scrumptious treats? The service is quite fast, after ordering I'm in and out in 5 minutes. From the end of the line to swinging the door on your way out, it takes about a half hour. While Baked & Wired is a sub-par experience, I highly recommend going to their sister restaurant \"A Baked Joint\" near Chinatown. They have a limited menu of baked goods (no cupcakes), but don't worry they carry the S'mores bar and cookies along with breakfast sandwiches, quiches, paninis, salads, soups, and pizza for dinner in addition to a plethora of coffee and lattes to choose from. The foccacia bread is my favorite! It has a nice cafe vibe with plenty of space where you can comfortably sit down and relax. Next time when I'm in Georgetown, I'm going to pass on the cupcakes and try out some of the brownies and bars."}, {"review_id": "0oakBArYKLrgpB1Nu4l9Eg", "user_id": "HbpimHQgqWVIunIaiGv98w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "This place is great. It has so many different types of desserts. They even have gluten free options and vegan options. The cookies are amazing! One of the best places I've been for cookies. I've only had a cupcake once and it was pretty good but not the best I've ever had. I really like how there is a separate line for the coffee. I ordered a Mocha which was outstanding with my cookies. The line for the desserts tends to be pretty long. One thing that does take away from this place is that they won't let you wait inside. During the winter when it's very cold you have to wait outside until the line is short enough. I understand it's fire code but I def won't go during the winter months."}, {"review_id": "3BozNsFuoeq4-V5ZZ5EClw", "user_id": "h6UlOSRiEMcDTZT7mSzoSA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Holy schnikes, this place is good!

The real cupcake treasure trove is a few blocks a way and let me tell you, it doesn't need a tv show to get some hype. These babies stand alone on flavor, size, style and texture.

Came in after brunch on Easter Sunday needing something sweet and this hit the spot. They have quite a few cupcakes on the menu plus a plethora of serve yourself cookies, brownies, bars, etc. They have a menu of their cupcakes you can look through while you're in line to see what you want, but everything else kinda just hits you as soon as you walk in. So many things to choose from, it was a little stressful since the line moved quickly. I did see a vegan peanut butter bar that looked amazing.I got to taste a couple of cookies which were good, but wish they were softer. We also got a couple of cupcakes which were also good. The cake was soft, but nothing that really differentiated it from other cakes I've had before. The frosting on these things though was the real MVP. The Chocolate Cupcake of Doom frosting was my favorite - so rich and creamy and decadent. Maybe my favorite dark chocolate frosting I've ever had. We also got the Dirty Chai cupcake (pretty good overall - vanilla and chai cake with an espresso buttercream frosting), Pretty Bitchin' (Chocolate cake with a crunchy peanut butter frosting) I am a peanut butter girl, and this was just okay to me. The Chocolate Doom was way better.  The other side of the shop was a cafe that had some of the best chai tea lattes I've had in a while - hot AND cold. Overall, this place was pretty good. I may not have loved everything I tasted, but they have so many things to choose from, I'm confident if you stop by you're bound to find something you love."}, {"review_id": "1xVV-gXCbQs25CPS6DHdJA", "user_id": "sRyNXAjlGWXOtX8KyzM8vw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Would you believe that my first time going here was 10 years ago and I haven't been back here since???  I really need to find a way to tackle more of Georgetown, really.  When I went my first time, this place was a best-kept secret, while everyone went to Georgetown Cupcake just a few blocks away.  I loved Baked & Wired then, and I love it now, even if everyone is hip.  10 years later, the quality of their desserts has not been changed or compromised.  Their cupcakes run for about $4, but they're HUGE, and it would be dangerous to eat a whole one in one sitting... but your stomach and taste buds would be very happy.  When you go inside, you can either get a menu, or just stare at the glass casing of each cupcake available that day, or both!  You would think looking at them like that makes the picking easier, but it really doesn't since they all look amazing.  This is exactly why I never go inside when there's a line out the door; I would be holding people up!  Just some things to know: the desserts are on the left side, the coffee is on the right side, and there are some tables for seating in the back.  I would suggest that you come on a weekday and not on the weekend since that is when the crowds come.  And most of all...ENJOY!"}, {"review_id": "Tc_bXmj9OMCfbATpAmN2Og", "user_id": "hDGoHzlGwspqlE_UkZ2Vtw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Came here for the recommendation of great cupcakes. My friend and I ordered half a dozen cupcake flavors and tried them out. Here is the ranking of our most favorite cupcakes yo least favorite. All the cupcakes were not overly sweet and had a great flavor combination. The frosting was also nicely made. However, in the end my friend and I both agreed it lacked moisture and the cake ended up being too dry for our taste.1. Orange almond - it had an orange cake base with orange frosting and sliced almonds on top. Definitely my favorite. 2. Coconut - fresh shredded coconut on top and not too sweet 3. Carrot cake - love the cupcake, with walnuts inside and great frosting. 4. Peanut butter frosting and chocolate cake - I love the peanut butter frosting had real chunks of peanuts on them. 5. Pistachio - had real chunks of pistachio on the frosting and in the cake, but was a disappointment. The flavor was not really there. 6. Red velvet - usually my favorite flavor; but this one was dry and lacked the buttercream moisture and flavor. I would like to come back  and try their other flavors like strawberry cupcake as well as their drinks and other pastries. The interior was very cute, with comfortable couches. On a great day, the outside area is also a nice place to enjoy the sun and chat with friends. There's no free WiFi; not a great place to sit and do work (unless you don't need WiFi to do work)."}, {"review_id": "Mbk_FDeft_7EpKejWkn8wQ", "user_id": "uVJR-OrTclcZfoNPqqsfYA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "I'm not a huge sweets person so I haven't had many cupcakes from actual shops, but this was really delicious! Honestly, this makes Georgetown Cupcakes taste bad cause their cupcake is just loaded with frosting.....no thanks! Baked & Wired has a unique way of making their cupcakes, which is the deep cupcakes. This idea is genius because it makes the ratio of the actual cupcake and icing more balanced so it's not overly sweet!

I love bringing back food instead of tourist gifts. I think secretly those are the only gifts, I want. I really love the set up of the cupcakes. It made the whole process of choosing a cupcake so easily. My first cupcakes that I tasted was the elvis for my hubby. I was able to sneak a bite from his and I love the cake and the frosting. Everyone who was able to get one, love it. I really wish I brought more back home to share. I brought a total of 10 and they went quick. One, good reason to come pick me up from the airport is that you gets some good cupcakes. I was able to get them individual boxed for an extra price but made it much easier to transport them. They stay pretty well considering the 5 hours flight. Really good cupcakes, I think I ended up with one cupcake and I did not leave any crumb behind. It was so moist! I need/hope someone would go to DC and bring some back."}, {"review_id": "GSwjEVOvlJRSIz93UkiAuQ", "user_id": "93rlPm_NXdz9XPRMIFi-Iw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Best cupcakes in DC.

I ordered their chocolate of doom, and it felt like frosting from the store, and an average chocolate taste to the cake.  I felt bad for saying it but it felt so average?  I did enjoy the carrot cake one more though. It had a bit more flavor to it.It's overall a good cupcake.

WOW!I've been to cupcake bars before, but they were always way too sweet and full of icing for me to enjoy them. We came across this place when we were walking from eating lunch. I wanted to grab a cup of coffee since I didn't get my morning fix yet. Walking in, you immediately notice ALL their cupcakes & cakes lined along their counter - it's overwhelming (in a good way). You'll also notice the store is split in two - to the left is for desserts (cupcakes, cake, brownies, etc) & to the right is for coffee!I ordered an iced chai latte with skim milk - yum! Well priced coffee and fast service. Afterwards, after maybe 5 minutes of trying to decide what flavor cupcake to get, we went with the chocolate with butter cream. My friend & I shared it because they look way too big for either of us to finish it alone.Great, huge size and the flavor of the cupcake was on point! It wasn't overly sweet and I didn't feel overwhelmingly full once we finished it.  It paired well with my coffee & I wish I could try some more of their flavors - definitely did not disappoint.

The more you visit Baked & Wired, the more you'll see why this spunky bakery has a bit more charm than it's clean-cut Gtown cousin up the street.
