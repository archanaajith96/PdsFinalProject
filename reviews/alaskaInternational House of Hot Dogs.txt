Pretty good for something that fills you in Anchorage.The food was really good, but the Mexican be too spicy depends on who you are. The German Dog was really good, especially with the Sauerkraut, The Hawaiian Dog is really good without the spice!!!Overall a great place with great employees, and a great place for tourists!!! I would recommend just about anybody to check this place out or eat here!!!"}, {"review_id": "w1nRuoxTNt0MhLyUNA5LSg", "user_id": "JA5spGtPLS0vC3VymBc-bA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Can't even give a star.

Amazing taste. Affordable pricing. Great service. The gentleman who helped us (the owner I assume) was super energetic and helpful. I ordered two dogs and fries and he immediately let me know I'd save money getting the combo. Contrary to what I thought they do have indoor seating in bike shop. Amazing discovery since we're only a few days into winter."}, {"review_id": "LqDqhcFNijkzGWZeuaIckQ", "user_id": "X4nYQw393Ayc1sKz4-f5Rw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "IHOH is absolutely incredible! A lot of thought was put into the business prior to opening. The way they have the restaurant set up is genius from a business perspective. Tl;Dr version: this place is 100% worth the 5 stars they have. The staff and the food have truly earned it! You order from a food truck window, and then walk around next door to the indoor seating section. They deliver the food to you, so you don't have to go back outside in the cold. The reason I Iike this concept is because it allows them to be mobile if they chose. The food you get at the \"restaurant\" is identical to what you'd get from their mobile food truck.On to the important parts of any dining experience: food and service. I really don't know which one was better. The guy that took our order was one of nicest people I've ever met. I asked for recommendations, and he thoroughly explained his favorite options and the best sellers. When I told him I couldn't decide between two different options, he assured me that wasn't a problem. I could take the type of sausage (Buffalo) I wanted and incorporate it with the toppings I wanted from the other options.I ordered the Grizzly Dog and substituted the beef dog for a buffalo sausage. It was hands down the best \"hotdog\" I've ever had. They top it with lettuce, tomato, onions, and jalapeños, which I usually don't eat, but I decided to try it with them on there anyway. It was perfect! I also ordered garlic fries that were cooked and seasoned perfectly. The peach nectar drink was also really refreshing.If I'm ever in Anchorage, or within a 100 mile radius, I would definitely make this a priority to visit again."}, {"review_id": "HX1LH_ix_Sib0fvGCxsUTg", "user_id": "hFJTIlzSmZDGQADMoqG5Og", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "I've been here a ton of times, how it's taken this long for me to realize that I have not reviewed them yet is beyond me. Let me start off by saying wow, this place blows it out of the park in terms of food/flavor and the kindness/hospitality from the IHOH staff.This sounds insane, but have you ever tasted something that instantly made you feel like you were elsewhere. No? Being a New Yorker, their New Yorker gourmet hot dog instantly reminds me of the cities hot dog trucks that line their streets. Their buffalo sausage, onions and special, homemade chipotle crème instantly brings me home. Their Texan is perfect for chilly days with a beef dog topped with warm chili, onions and melted cheese. Their Hawaiian pup is mixed with the same chipotle crème, along with onions, ham and pineapple. If those don't sound too appealing, then that's alright too. Seriously, just ask and you shall receive a dog however you like - like adding jalapeno relish, pico de gallo salsa or strawberry jam. Or not feeling a hot dog, they also have fries, quesadilla's and even tamales to eat for cheap. A full meal for nearly $10? You really can't beat that.Now their customer service - they go to infinity and beyond. Besides their good food, their friendly faces are enough to keep you coming back - for more hot dogs, with more friends, and sharing their delicious dog secrets and new downtown location. Their 'friends,' which if you interact with Luis, you are instantly his friend, gets window to table service. Relocating from across the street from the Sears Mall in midtown, their new location is right behind Snow City Café. Luis, the business owner shares property with Pablo's bike rentals. Which *game changer* is his brother. So in the summer, IHOH has tables with umbrella's outside for their guests, where after you are able to rent a bike next door and in the wintertime, they use Pablo's bike rental as an indoor seating area for IHOH. Genius! Go. Spread the word. There is obviously a reason why of all places,  they have an average of a five stars across 200+ reviews. Super rare, super worth it."}, {"review_id": "nSi07VOaLi2fAM0qOQCHMQ", "user_id": "kRGf-B_m5chd8CF7l5As9w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "I've been eyeing this place for a while and I've heard from many people that this place was amazing.

Not only was the owner the most happy and friendly person I've ordered from (even more so than Chick-fil-A, yeah I said it) but the food came fast and in great quality.

I ordered the garlic fries with chipotle sauce and decided to put the chipotle sauce on all the hotdogs I had.   Service was very friendly and energetic.

Just had my first layover in Anchorage at a nearby hotel. Most of my friends encouraged me to try Snow City Cafe, but I'm not much of a breakfast person and diner-type food is more my jam. So I walked here in 14 degree weather, and it was sooo worth it! I got the Texan Dog because I'm not that ballsy to try the other crazy dogs on the menu, and I stuck with regular fries since it was my first time here. Neither disappointed! While I was eating inside the indoor portion, I was thinking man, I wish I had another napkin as I was definitely eating caveman style. And then in walks in the owner to bring me another napkin!!

I had the Hawaiian with Reindeer sausage, grilled onions, bacon, ham, grilled pineapple and a chipotle cream sauce. No wimpy dog, it's meal sized and comes on a bun that can stand up to all the topping, it was delicious. Add to it the garlic fries and you have a meal that tastes great, is filling and a great deal.

I do not particularly like hot dogs. I'm from the mac and cheese with cut up franks era - sorry Dad, I don't miss it. First off - get a buffalo sausage. The German dog has the perfect toppings to compliment the strong flavored meat. I love sauerkraut, carmelized onions and mustard. The fries are a little too salty for me and I feel that they could be tamed with some good ole shake it up Parmesan. With that being said, I still eat their fries! If you are unable to eat the delicious dog/sausage, ask for the toppings on the side to avoid the soggy bun. But if you can happily eat in your car, power to you! There is always available parking in front of the IHOH trailer.Oh - they now make chicken tamales too!!!
