If you're looking for a delicious, authentic, tacos at an affordable, authentic price--Don Joaquin's is the place for you. The building itself is nestled between a couple of other restaurants, which means parking can be a beast, trying to share spaces between Subway lovers and Hawaiian BBQ fanatics. Luckily, I make sure not to go during the busiest hours, so I'm able to find a space fairly easily. Tacos, burritos, and other items are available (honestly, I don't know what else there is because I adhere to the strict \"Tacos 4 Lyfe\" diet). There is a self serve toppings bar, complete with fresh limes, chopped onions and cilantro, and different salsas and cabbage to freshen up your meal. The employees do an awesome job at keeping the space stocked and clean, which is highly appreciated on my part. Lots of seating is available, bathrooms are clean, and the service is great. Honestly, you can't find a better place in Provo, especially for those Mormon Missionaries returning home from living in Mexico, craving a little taste of the good place. TIPS & TRICKS: * It's a great place for either a one-on-one date or a large group get together! Be brave and invite that guy you've been eyeing in class.* Tacos Tuesday's! (Alliteration is key). * Al pastor (pork and pineapple) is easily the best, chicken and steak come in a close second and third."}, {"review_id": "2t60sHqVYjSrtKjVWvHhMA", "user_id": "t4BMgg88yRLhe_BBi1u8sA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Stopped here with the family after a graduation. Street tacos are delicious especially the Al Pastor and Chorizo.Great authentic Mexican street tacos. The Gringo tacos are a unique spin on street tacos with just meat topped with melted fried cheese on top.It is very inexpensive so you can really fill up on great tacos.Staff is super friendly and wants you to feel as if this is an experience that you may find in Mexico City and they did not disappoint."}, {"review_id": "_9tdeIz9tmLwrH-Rx7jzow", "user_id": "CEWN7ozgvvPwbaKvPlMlIA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "If you've ever been to Mexico, walking into this place will make you tear up from feeling at home. It's got the authentic vibe from the decorative papers cut out and strung from the ceiling to the back-door entrance into the restaurant. Everything is written in Spanish then English. Now, if this is your first Mexican-type experience, be prepared to tear up from spiciness. Hopefully you're tougher than me, and can enjoy the variety of authentic, deliciously seasoned tacos. They really do live up to the hype. I tried the asada and the cabeza, which made me nervous at first but actually proved to be one of the tenderest and juiciest meats I've tried. The bar with toppings is extensive and the cost is so low, it is the gift that's got you wanting to keep coming back and eating more. Your search for savory, juicy tacos is over--come and try Don Joaquin's amazing tacos!! They are guaranteed to make you want to start a mariachi band and sing your happiness, they're so good."}, {"review_id": "ciURTLGc4dHy38DdRdFq9Q", "user_id": "NK6EC6Z2l4iKSvIo5PsnqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Street tacos at its finest.

Simply beautiful. She left me try her al pastor tacos and I definitely will be ordering those next time!!Personally I ordered the quesadilla with added beans and it was so delicious! They use a white cheese and its so cheesy and yummy it leaves ya feeling all warm and delicious inside. Definitely will come again and probably order the quesadilla with al pastor inside cause that meat was so juicy!!"}, {"review_id": "pyJ0LGBPbL_kT9jNn_b0kQ", "user_id": "DIckqqZNAQwL5ySdqWIJyw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/29/2017", "text": "This place is right next to a high school and it gets packed at lunch time!They messed up our order and gave another table the same number as us. So we had to wait a while for them to correct their mistake and redo the order.I tried the beef, pork, and pork sausage tacos. Surprised they didn't have any chicken. The tacos weren't that great, kinda shocked how many people were there from high school ordering. Maybe cause they are super cheap? It couldn't be because of the flavor unless Utah County is lacking in Taco joints.  There are a ton in Salt Lake City that are excellent and this place doesn't cut it. I also ordered the tres leches cake and it was very dry and tasted a bit stale.

I was just leaving the hospital and I pulled up Yelp and it recommended this place. It was very busy which is always a sign of good food... The classic Tacos were only a $1.25 so I naturally assumed they are pretty small and ordered three plus a bean burrito. I was pleasantly surprised when I got my order, the tacos were stacked! Great flavors, lots of meat and very filling. No need for the burrito, I took it home to have the next day. I will definitely come back again if I am in the area.

New to me, and new to Utah County. Pound for pound, that turf is some of the most interesting and unique spots in all of Utah. Sure, you've got chains, but you've also got some homegrown spots that scream out to be explored.Very recently, I fired up the Yelp app and saw this spot show up. Now, I've got plenty of street taco options right by my house (actually street street--food carts and the like) but I was intrigued about a place that calls itself \"street tacos\" and is an actual brick-and-mortar so I pointed the car in this direction.I was trying to eat light, as I tend to have a lot of stops when I'm in the UTC, but it just doesn't seem like much food when they're street tacos. Indeed, these are the small soft corn shells, layered dos por dos, and topped with whatever meat you order. I went with several different varieties (so much for eating light) and waited at my table, though only after stopping at the dressing bar for salsa, radish, pico, limes, cilantro, etc. I grabbed some of the pickles stuff and one of the distinct memories I have from this night is my lips were tingling for almost the whole night. Sometimes good food just wakes you up from what seems like a slumber of a thousand years and your blood starts pumping. Such was my night.They have the normal stuff--al pastor, carnitas, chorizo--but I was stoked to see the deep cuts. Bucho, tripa, lengua. Oh ya! They were all well prepared and you should definitely dive in to those as well. It might sound like a bad idea, and certainly that kind of situation isn't for everyone, but when it's worth it, it's worth it, you know? Each was delicious and I'd do it again next time I'm there.Prices are cheap (but not taco cart cheap; they have rent to pay) but you do have a seating area. It can get busy, it would seem, and though it's not tiny, it's not too expansive and you may have to stalk your seat. You can grab a beverage or perhaps a dessert (?) but I stuck to tacos versus burritos or anything else.All in all, my fiery lips and satisfied belly think back often to this night with a lot of affection. I want to have experiences like this a lot more--maybe more time in UTC is the key!"}, {"review_id": "n-8eZin0zAInsBifU6Qz_A", "user_id": "3O4Gc27rz81ALNNwTrgDtw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/20/2017", "text": "Straight up street tacos ... in Provo!
