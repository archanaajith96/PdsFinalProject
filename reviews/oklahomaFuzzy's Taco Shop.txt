It came highly recommended and did NOT disappoint. The food was decently priced and tasted great!The one thing that turned me off was a common trait amongst a good portion of the staff... They seemed stoned out of their minds! The employees that wander between tables, picking up trash and dishes tended to linger and rambled on awkwardly. One girl had stickers on her face, red eyes and smelled pretty strongly of weed. I'm not one to judge, to each their own. But the smell was an appetite killer."}, {"review_id": "15ag4DfqtjZByEwVHE30ug", "user_id": "hYOqDm5_VgVHo1sPGGGDhQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/4/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Okay, a fave place to eat when visiting the folks in Norman.  I have yet to not like what was ordered.  Tonight's choices included:  Drunken Pig (tasty side, or yummy quick lunch); smothered Grilled Shrimp burrito with cilantro-lime rice & black beans; huge plate of shredded chicken nachos; enchilada plate with borracho beans; and the brisket sandwich with potatoes.  Only thing I was 'meh' about was the bread for the brisket sandwich.  Underwhelming amount of meat, too.Everything else I would order and eat again!  (Mind you, that was an order for FOUR people!  LOL)Décor has been updated since last time we were here.  Brighter interior, bolder colors, and really fun ceiling fans overhead."}, {"review_id": "vVkkkNarVc-DzXQW983RKQ", "user_id": "uYfMMef2FRpjBfGN5MVNsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/15/2017", "text": "Obsessed!

I thought I could at least salvage the day by suggesting to eat at Fuzzys. My whole family was really glad I did. I haven't been to this location before. I wasn't sure to expect because it was on Campus Corner. I was surprised to walk in and be one of the only people there. I thought for sure this particular location would be super busy around 11 on a Sunday but then my husband remind me that college kids sleep in on weekends. I got the combo plate with a beef taco and cheese enchilada. We also ordered some chicken nachos for the table and two quesadilla kids meals. Y'all, this meal was awesome! It really hit the spot. It's the best Mexican food I've had in a good while. The taco was perfection, the cheese enchilada was creamy and delicious and the rice and beans were also really good. You can't go wrong with their chicken nachos. Plenty of toppings and cheese so that I didn't find a bare chip in the bunch. My kids, of course, ate theirs right up with zero complaints. My husband had the chicken salad and kept commenting how wonderful it was.This is the best location I've been to so far and would happily make my \"go to\" taco spot. This is my idea of comfort food."}, {"review_id": "I9SGRZNWC0FI_KXcwAG58Q", "user_id": "0dWzaoScBE4qtNfKUwk6Uw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2017", "text": "Not only is Fuzzy's my favorite late night snack (cue the queso with beef and a spicy pork quesadilla), but it's also an awesome lunch and dinner spot.

Plus this place is a really cool spot to hit on OU game days. There's a good crowd but not overwhelmingly busy that you wait 20 minutes to get a drink. If you're here for game day and wanting a drinking spot hit up the side door and head straight to the back to the patio. The line out the door was the food line but just for drinks, side door.

This location is not. The food here seems to be consistent with the quality of the Bricktown location, but the drinks...not so much. Back to that later.Our food was made pretty quickly considering how busy the restaurant was, but after about 7 minutes of seeing people who had ordered after us getting their drinks, we finally decided to remind the person taking orders that we had ordered a margarita. This is where the problems began! Problem uno: We specifically ordered a margarita with Patron, and we heard the girl making the drinks ask someone \"which one is Patron??\" Sorry, but if you work at a Mexican food place you better know common tequila types. Problem dos: The amount of tequila in our margarita was tiiinyyyy! Like I'm talking not even a half ounce. Part of the attraction of Fuzzys margaritas is the size, but the appeal is lost if there isn't enough tequila, because that's the whole point of a margarita.Problem tres: This is the big one. The bartender was licking her fingers the whole time she was making drinks. Not in a dainty \"its tea time and I got jam on my pinky\" licking her fingers, but like smacking, slurping grossness. I don't care if you're not making the food, no one working in a restaurant should take the risk of getting bodily fluids anywhere near someone's food/drink. Bottom line: If you're a fan of fuzzys, great! But it's worth it to drive to the OKC location instead of this one."}, {"review_id": "Vec-ynye3NlR8229am70Kw", "user_id": "LIvR3XdUX-7VFwICd7dYRw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/8/2015", "text": "Even though Fuzzy's wasn't there 'in my day,' it's such a campus corner sure-win for me now. Don't be intimidated by a long line out the door. Fuzzy's gets an A++ for being efficient and quick! There are booths, tables and high-tops alike with TVs around to watch the big game. Here are my tips when it comes to ordering:Chips + Queso: I mean cooommmeeee onnnn. Duh. The chips are the best part with exceptional seasoning and crispness.The beer/marg combo drink: Another, 'duh.'

This location is in Campus Corner, so you can expect the place to be primarily populated with a bunch of students on break from class or drinking after said class. There is a direct correlation between the number of people eating to the service you will receive. However, whether that will mean better service or worse service depends on which students are working (and I'm sure that their staff has a high turnover rate) and if they have a bunch of friends working with them or eating there. Summer of 2012, they didn't clean their hot sauce spouts until just before classes started. Summer 2013, they seem to be have been cleaned more often. As for their food, the fajita platter was pretty unspectacular. Their margaritas are reasonably priced for what you get. Their guacamole and chips have been disappointing and other times I can't get enough. I generally get their taco platter and like all of the options that I have tried. The sauce is pretty yummy on their food as well.One interesting thing about the place: they have a \"Fish Bowl\" drink that you need a minimum of 4 people over the age of 21 to order. And for good reason; it is a literal plastic fish bowl that they pour a purple kool-aid like alcoholic drink that reminds me of \"sigma soup\" and put four neon colored straws in. 1/4th of it is plenty for a 130 lb casual drinking female. They have a patio which I only sat at once. If I remember correctly, it is blocked off with a wooden fence and smoking is allowed (but maybe not). It was some holiday, maybe St. Patrick's, so the place was packed. Maybe because this was my first and only Fuzzy's, I just see Fuzzy's as a college food joint. It's great for a casual date or to get your drink on. TL;DR - Pretty much, your service and food will vary greatly.For these reasons, I just can't give them a 4. I don't go as often now because I'm in the midst of many, many more restaurants that I need to try."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/fuzzys-taco-shop-norman?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
