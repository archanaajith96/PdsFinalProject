Here's what changed... I discovered their falafel. Now, get this, I don't even like falafel normally. I have never had a falafel I liked. Until Chicpea. There's just something about it that is so delicious and I find myself constantly craving it.Now, I don't want anyone to correct me on this (ignorance is bliss) but I like to tell myself that it's baked because it doesn't seem deep-fried or greasy at all. Therefore, it's healthy! I don't what the true preparation method of it is, and frankly I don't think I want to. All I know is that it is truly the greatest falafel that ever existed."}, {"review_id": "eV4T64cwkQIdt29Naj1q9A", "user_id": "kArTuWjGVEHXDvXcEvYh-w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Catering Menu and individual meal purchase review.I'm literally addicted to the food from this restaurant, the owners are always around and they make sure all the customers are taken care of properly and that we enjoyed our experience and meal. The food is prepared with so much care, everything was super fresh and delicious.I have tried basically ALL of their salads, beet, cucumber, eggplant and such - were all amazing. The meat choices are also equally as great, they have various types of chicken and aside from the fried chicken, they are all so goooood! Don't get me wrong, I like the fried chicken but its just doesn't work with my diet, hehehe. The pitas are usually piping hot, rice is so aromatic and yummy and omg don't forget about the hummus options. Hummus is literally like creamy and very very smooth, buttery, nutty and just so friggin amazing. I can't wait go back already!!!Catering is pretty easy, pricey but they usually work with you and adjust to your preference to match a reasonable price point. Please remember though the food is fresh and amazing so it makes sense that its a bit more a premium, compared to carb+cheese=pizza."}, {"review_id": "6907qZQRGqfJdxCyjjPAKg", "user_id": "wANEdTa3lOx9WOzFo13LFQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/1/2017", "text": "I really wanted falafel for lunch, so I Yelped options in the area (downtown Newark).

You can choose from a variety of salads to stuff the laffa and your choice of sauce to juice it up! I order red cabbage, onion/tomato, and parsley salads to my laffa. DE-LISH!

Low and behold, I had no update to review. This is my attempt to wrap my previous (mental) review along with this Elite event. The place is family owned and they were kind enough to open their doors to us so that way may try their delicious food. The falafels were proper, the hummus smooth and creamy (and very tasty), and the chicken schwarma was poppin. Friendly and courteous staff rounds out the entire experience. They are located downtown on Halsey so make your way over and grab some food.

No one does falafel and shawarma like the Chickpea. Can't decide between the two? Get the Shawafel. And the Dr Pepper sauce is a must. Finally, homemade lemonade flavors are awesome.

Love this type of set up because it's quick to order, has plenty of variety, and room to customize your meal! I heard lots of great things about this place so my coworkers and I decided to check it out. It was definitely packed, which we expected since it was lunch rush and it's such a popular spot. There are plenty of tables but it gets a bit too packed so we opted to take it to go. We were in and out of there pretty fast, despite the rush! Not because the workers were rushing - we didn't feel rushed at all. They were definitely efficient and knew how to keep the crowd moving at a fast pace. They were also really friendly and gave us suggestions since it was our first time coming in!I got the laffa, which is like really thick pita. The falafel was great and not too dry like in other places. The spicy tabouli salad added a kick, the hummus and tahini sauce added moisture, and the corn salad was just perfect. It was burrito-style, and I was surprised that it didn't burst, given that they gave a generous amount. I'm not vegan or vegetarian, but I appreciated that they have so many options if anyone has dietary restrictions! Prices are reasonable for a place with vegan options, though a bit on the pricier side. You get what you pay for - fresh food, friendly service, and a generous serving size! I would definitely recommend this place, and I will be coming back soon."}, {"review_id": "HU-p-vdQXWw4m9DXrZXxZg", "user_id": "VaPc1UPT3dRGkRjxV6fmxQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "I was looking for vegan options in downtown Newark.

I came on a Friday afternoon for lunch during the summer while it was rainy, so there wasn't a line. I heard if you go on a prime afternoon the line is nearly out the door. The person who helped me explained what the options were and guided me through the ordering process. I got a white pita, chick shawarma, hummus spread, tomatoes with onion and the eggplant with tomatoes as a \"side.\" As for the sauce, I got the red hot chill sauce and the combination of it all harmonized so well. One of the girls that I was with got the baklava and the honey mixed with the nuts was very very good. The only thing that I didn't like was that there was pasta on the floor where we were sitting, and you can tell it was from someone who brought in outside food. If the area was cleaner I would have given them 5 stars instead of 4.5.

I've been coming here for a few years but finally getting around to writing a review. So much to choose from when you enter. You order at the counter buffet style. The staff put your dish together. I usually get chicken swarma, eggplant, corn salad eith garlic mayo sauce. Sometimes i will ask for a slice of pita. Without the pita and a fresh mint lemonade, the cost is about $13.

I had the Laffa with falafel and my friend had a salad bowl. I got to choose 3 salads to put on it and they were all so enticing that it took me an inordinate amount of time to make a selection. I got the red cabbage slaw, the bean salad and the roasted eggplant and they were all so tasty. The ingredients were fresh and perfectly seasoned. I also got the Dr. pepper sauce at the cashier's suggestion. While I envisioned her dousing my Laffa with soda, the sauce was actually a spicy mayo-type sauce and it rounded out my meal very well. They also have a wide selection of homemade lemonades. I got the mint lemonade and it was flavorful without being too sweet. The people working there were also so friendly and nice! They offered us a free lemonade and let us stay an hour after the place closed so that we could finish what we were working on. The Green Chicpea was so good that I'm considering coming back to Newark to go, even though I live half an hour away."}, {"review_id": "FBynOafWsRh7rtAnkQDkMQ", "user_id": "yINdTyxyjBslhSW_w0WwHQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/11/2017", "text": "WHOA!!! So I came here for lunch this week because I was curious to know what the fuss was about re: the felafel. I've never had felafel so I was slightly nervous. I got a white pita with hummus, felafel, tubule (spelling??), Israeli salad and tahini. The portion was big (for me) and the total cost was $6! What a steal! I went back to my office and tuckered into my pita and was pleasantly surprised to find that the vegetarian option was actually not bad at all! I was eating something without meat and what? Loving it? Me? Yes, me! The felafel was flavorful, crispy on the outside and not dry at all! The hummus was great and everything came together nicely inside the pita.

Very kind staff: I was visiting from out of town for work, and someone who worked their helped me arrange and call an Uber so I could get it delivered directly to my work conference.2. Delicious food: Healthy, not oily, a lot of options, it honestly tastes like Israeli street food minus a little bit of the grease. They offer zhug, matbucha, hummus, laffa, and so much more Israeli food.3. Reasonable prices: Most kosher food is extremely expensive. I got two huge meals for 20 dollars total. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting or living in Newark. As someone who keeps kosher, it was especially amazing, but even if you do not keep kosher, I think you will really enjoy it."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-green-chicpea-newark-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
