This is that gem that makes it all the way. From the time you arrive the building it's self has a cool feeling, the interior is intimate and welcoming, the staff is fun and helpful. The food you consume comes from all local sources! Everything was delicious. Every plate, from every person in the room looked like I could eat it. I personally had a crepe with sirloin steak, cheeses, and Carmel onions and some amazing aioli. For desert had the s'mores crepe. I know, desert after breakfast right? Just couldn't help ourselves it was perfection. If you can catch breakfast in St. Louis at one place this needs to be it!"}, {"review_id": "yYakmGhUs4ovP3SuGoG-Pw", "user_id": "XJ7HpUQpn8KwjLoGCXlkaA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Overall, this place was \"cute\"... but it's didn't WOW me... i was attending the cubs and cardinals game and wanted a place close to the ball park. I love the decor ...nice table setting and a eclectic atmosphere... hostess and servers were very polite.. The food.. umm... had a lot to be desired. It was lack luster... not much seasoning.... I wanted sooo much to ask for a little onion powder and some fresh herb to jazz it up, but I was on my best behavior :)I accompanied my breakfast with an adult beverage, but it seemed to be more like one that came off the kids menu... I feel my mimosa was OJ with a splash of champagne... Never come between and woman and her morning fizz...Overall, unfortunately I won't return.."}, {"review_id": "GzdS6jeIDejIW75EQFfkGA", "user_id": "mz3tNkW-0e_I6ym_0bEWDw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Rooster in my opinion, is over-rated. I'm not a native to St. Louis but many people who are always recommends this place. So finally I caved and went and was extremely disappointed by what hype my friends gave me. My food was average and extremely bland, as if you could go to any dinner and have just as good food or better.. It has a nice atmosphere too and I love the rooster paintings too. That's why I gave this a 3 star instead of a 2 star.So based on food I would give it a 2 star but the atmosphere is at least a 4 so my average is a 3 star."}, {"review_id": "514ib0-y9YjJbCJDEnB5sg", "user_id": "isilLts_tupKm4-pN2FAFQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "I've been here twice for breakfast.  First time I had the black bean, cheese and egg crepe with the salsa on the side.  Was not bad. It I should gotten the salsa inside the crepe.  Crepe was a little on the oily side probably because of the cheese inside.Second time I tried the Nutella and banana crepe with a side order of scrambled eggs. This time crepe was a little dry but you can't go wrong with Nutella and banana.Many other dishes look pretty good so will probably return."}, {"review_id": "QoqORmyAVmSGdJ4ZAlA2FA", "user_id": "Sf1XAuaLfKdxoD8mFozpPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Rooster is a well known and renowned breakfast/lunch/brunch spot in St Louis and the restaurants offerings do not disappoint. Rooster has a variety of breakfast items but what they specialize in is crepes. The drink menu included coffee, smoothies, juices, and other libations. I ordered the house bloody mary and really enjoyed it. The \"secret blend of 17 ingredients\" added a lot of flavor to the drink. For the crepes they have a number of both sweet and savory crepes that are sure to please anyone. I personally went for the roasted ham crepe with emmenthaler & fontina and added an egg. The crepe was warm and soft yet sturdy enough to hold the hearty filling. The filling was very flavorful and the cheese complimented the savory ham wonderfully. For dessert we split a delicious s'mores crepe that was filled with chocolate and marshmallow fluff. Anything s'mores theme is automatically a win in my book and this was no exception! Rooster is a definite must visit when in St Louis!"}, {"review_id": "Sy-EBmoQ8EnIRhrxYapWWA", "user_id": "1t0d_eRE1yEZ-ycGjHEfwg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Wow. So far my favorite restaurant in St. Louis. I read the reviews and I knew I was going to wait at least 20 minutes for food. But, it was longer than that. I used their yelp check in. Very useful and I would highly encourage using it for the sake of efficiency for Rooster and for yourself. There's nothing I hate more than waiting outside. I came in, got sat down in my yelp check in immediately. When I ordered my food, it took about 30-40 minutes to get my food. So if you want your food. I would highly encourage you not to come during their lunch hour if you don't have time to wait. If you do have time to wait, expect to wait 30 minutes at least.I got the Rooster Slinger and chocolate chip crepe. Wow that rooster slinger was out of the world. I've never tried anything like this and it was amazing. The chocolate chip crepe was great as well but cannot outbeat the slinger.Definitely coming back when I'm in town."}, {"review_id": "PUTpJGx1VK9zv6hEnRTgug", "user_id": "p69yiKxJVgW45ur19Adabg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "We waited 14 minutes to be greeted before going back to the host stand to ask for our server. Our coffees were not refilled one time- we had to refill them ourselves at the counter (which is technically for people waiting for a table). We had a simple order of one omelette and one scramble with mixed greens instead of potatoes, and I was served potatoes and no greens. My scramble was barely warm. Our server was nice but barely said 5 words to us.

Rooster wasn't too busy which was surprising given the reviews it gets. I went for breakfast the next weekend and quickly learned the reviews are correct. Insanely busy! Luckily they use the No Wait app so we were seated in a hurry.Great ambience, cool posters that appear to be painted by young children, yet they were done in a way that was intriguing. I really like the large amount of seating and seating areas throughout, plus the high ceiling make you feel like you're in a much larger space.The menu is expansive and literally everything is great. Huge, huge portions and pricing on par (or even cheaper) than most any other spot. They also serve Kaldi's coffee at cheaper prices than Kaldi's, plus they offer bottomless cups. Overall this is a 5/5 brunch spot. Great staff, quick service, awesome food."}, {"review_id": "vfow1U_ZRxvnRLVdZpXQlA", "user_id": "4tG5J7eZF-8oxCD1xx-fYw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Long wait to get in.

We came here on recommendation of a local friend--he said this was one of the best places to brunch in downtown St. Louis. And he was right!We started with some bloodies: the House Bloody and the Bloody Bull--beefy flavor. I loved the beefy flavor, but now wished I would have tried the Bloody Samurai because that sounds so good and unique too!Boyfriend got the Rooster Slinger for brunch, and it did not disappoint. A hearty meal with sausage, potatoes, eggs, and gravy was filling and delicious. The gravy was well seasoned and the sausage had amazing flavor.I had NEVER seen Gluten Free crepes before so of course I freaked out and doubled up on portions. For savory, I got the Bacon #3: goat cheese, tomatoes, and bacon. This was DELICIOUS I could have eaten multiple. I did find the menu a bit confusing, as many of the goat cheese ones had similar ingredients to the bacon ones, etc. Perhaps a make-your-own crepe with add on options would be best here. Nonetheless, the crepe was savory, creamy with goat cheese, and delicious roasted tomatoes!I couldn't stop at one. So for brunch \"dessert\", I got a nutella crepe. I loved that you could do add-ons here, like bananas, strawberries, ice cream, cookie crumbs, etc. So genius and delish. In all honesty, two crepes was more than plenty for brunch but I loved every moment. Our server was very attentive and fun. We had great service here. Will definitely come back here on our next trip to STL!"}, {"review_id": "6HnGFzoolo0qJNJviYEFHQ", "user_id": "_0L4WNYQ6f6y6pMYzJ3b9Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Not sure how a crepe place could make such an awful crepe.  The S'mores crepe itself was overcooked and the \"cookie crumbles\" missing.  My kid was disappointed, but we were here for the Volleyball tourney and didn't have time for a redo.Waitress never checked on how we liked our food; seemed to disappear for long periods.I had the b.e.l.t and have to be honest; partially my fault: had not anticipated that lettuce does not belong on this sandwich.  No harm, just pulled it off after taking one bite.  The bread was not \"strong\" enough to hold and eat this as a sandwich; so the ingredients just came spilling out.  The potatoes lacked flavor and looked like a mess on the plate.Overall a pretty lousy experience, even the coffee was a bitter mess.  Better than McDs is about the only compliment I can give them."}, {"review_id": "Ux53NtcZjl-3J3hPxGfB7A", "user_id": "RDdA1FA6zgWYaVOKtyMIHQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Wait time was long but our party got in very quickly with checking in with the Yelp app!  Food was very good and the house Bloody Mary was amazing!  It was very reasonably priced as well!  Will definitely come back here again!"}, {"review_id": "RpFiyU0tRMGYm-O2DwfPOg", "user_id": "pqltKii762h8-Iim52-a2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!!!

Period. Lusciousness on a plate. Thought it would be busy at 12:45 but maybe most people don't realize they can order breakfast foods anytime--AND they have great lunch options as well. Prices are perfectly acceptable for the art I received in a plate. They don't even charge extra for GF options!  Only recommendation:  the cook should have whisked up my scrambled eggs a bit more. Maybe it's a Midwest thing but I'd rather not see the separation of whites and yolks in my scrambled protein.
