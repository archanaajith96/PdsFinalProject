Parking is hard to find in the area so if you find a spot close you better snag it fast. The restaurant was very nice on the inside. I was promptly seated at the sushi bar since it was just me. I was told my server would be by shortly. 10 mins go by and still no server. It was like she didn't want to take my order. So finally the host comes back over with my water and takes my order! Glad someone felt like helping I was a little hungry. So I ordered the Crazy Spider roll and the Red Dragon roll. The sushi was handed to me in a descent time frame and I was ready to dig in. I ran out of water and was hoping my server would come by ( so I could meet her!) and refill my water. Well that didn't happen. So both rolls were delicious. The spicy tuna in the crazy spider roll was great and I really liked the crunchiness is the soft shell grab that was lightly fried. The red dragon roll was equally as good although I wish it would have had the spicy sauce with it that the menu mentioned. The sweet sauce was good but i wanted that additional flavor pop from the spicy sauce. Never got that refill on water! I was a little parched after eating spicy food! In fact after my food was handed to me I never had another person stop by and see how i was doing. I had to flag another person down just to get my bill so I could pay it. Over all the food was top notch but the service was seriously lacking."}, {"review_id": "lQO_88weduxKVtQ9BqG5sw", "user_id": "ofr2B-0VtKkqGfaug9aBsA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/1/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Brunch menu prices are misleading.Why should bibimbap without any meat be the same price as that with meat in it?

The service was good however he had no any of any gluten free options nor what contained soy sauce, etc so probably the reason wasn't as pleasant. We got a bottle of Sake which was excellent (he did know his Sake) and we got some Robota appetizer I think? Was like filet beef sticks and also some roasted pork belly appetizer which was excellent, the apps were great. The sushi however was 3/5, it didn't taste fully fresh and the rice as soon as you picked it up with the chopsticks fell apart, the sushi chef that night was terrible.

Sicily, 1912.\" ... but Little Rock, 2017 instead!The hubs and I stopped in for Sunday brunch upon trusted recommendation. And while I totally get the appeal, our visit was just ok.The restaurant layout and decor is great, and the service was friendly (but stretched too thin to offer adequate attention to refills and details-- like removing dirty plates). The place wasn't packed, but I only noticed 2 servers in the dining area; taking on approximately 6 tables.We both opted for the mimosa bar, which the hubs wasn't too keen on as he's not a great mixologist. He tried to make a decent mixture and failed miserably. All he wanted was to be served a great Bellini at brunch. Nope, impossible. I, on the other hand, had better luck at the bar, but was disappointed to see all of my syrups and effort settle to the bottom of my glass at the table, while I waited for my food. Dude?! *insert huge eye roll here*Needless to say, I'm not a fan of the bar as the sole option here. I say keep the DIY bar for those who want to stray away from the norm, but also make and send the traditional brunch drinks and all will be well with the world! I ordered the eggs Benedict and the sweet potatoes, and truly enjoyed them both. The hubs went the traditional route and ordered a noodle bowl and a sushi roll. That choice would prove to be the bane of our existence. The noodle bowl was ok and when the hubs reached the roll, he asked for a dipping sauce. Our waiter offered spicy sauce, but hubs didn't want to add kick to it so the waiter offered to have the sushi chef whip him up a play on \"yum-yum\" sauce. Perfect, right?! Wrong. The sauce took a whopping 18 minutes to come out. Yes, we sat staring at his roll and making random conversation and distracted by social media (with dirty plates in front of us) for 18 minutes. In hindsight, I should have \"grabbed the bull by the horns\" but I was totally in an \"easy like Sunday morning\" kinda' mood. Clearly! (Otherwise, I'd have never gone for this!)Upon arrival with the sauce, the waiter apologized and joked that he didn't realize that the sauce would be such a challenge. I asked him to remove the plates, and he obliged.The sauce was good, we ate half of the roll and vacated the premises. I was slightly agitated and more than ready to go after such a long wait. All in all, it wasn't the worst (almost there) but it definitely wasn't the best brunch experience-- more of a \"Meh\" to \"Bleh\" situation for me.

Service 4.5/5 - Every time I've been here, the service has been amazing. It can be a little slow when it's busy, but the servers are incredibly attentive, and checking in the perfect amount of times. They're also knowledgeable and willing to answer any questions you have (or search for the answers if they don't in fact know). They're also willing to be honest - if a dish is unpopular, why it's unpopular, and whether they have specific recommendations other than the most ordered dishes.Food 4/5 - The menu is huge, and it seems they're trying to do a little of everything - sushi, robata, ramen, entrees, poke, etc. It's a little much - I personally dislike when a menu is clearly just trying to cover the gamut of customer base. I think they risk a little quality because of this, and you really have to look for the gems. Usually the sushi is amazing, and so the robata - their two staples. I haven't tried a lot of their items, have only been here twice, but will vouch definitely for their sushi. Some of the side dishes I've tried (rice, cooked entrees, etc.) I'm pretty on the fence about. Tip: Get the nigiri. The fish is so fresh and delicious, honestly astounded Little Rock has such good sushi. Robata is also delicious, mix and match for the table! Edamame is incredible salty - would avoid unless you have an insane craving and are willing to tolerate. If you go for lunch, the bento box is a pretty good bang for your buck, but it's a bit down on food quality."}, {"review_id": "cwmkea6G9MhKlP5cmAsB4g", "user_id": "it5901law8zFde-6dL4HXQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/25/2017", "text": "From living in Little Rock for some time now, my husband and I love the sushi at Kemuri.

She denied we had received the wrong item after reviewing our order form and said maybe the tuna was just spicy that night. What? Didn't offer to do anything about it then when we got our bill, the wrong thing was even listed on the ck so it was obvious someone messed up plus we paid more than we should have and didn't get what we ordered.

As fish snobs who've had fresh from the Bay Area to the cliffs of Ireland, this special was not only literally fresh but had a refreshing taste too!

Truly, this service was superb and while it was a Friday night, I didn't feel as if we were rushed or just another table.

I recommend this place for business lunch or dinner!Food: 5/5I started with seaweed salad appetizer. Surprisingly huge portion and taste was very fresh and authentic, with a hint of citrus. Tuna tataki was my main course. The presentation was beautiful: skinny long curls of carrot and microgreens on top of perfectly seared tuna above slices of avocado, creamy crab mix, and savory rice. My server poured spicy soy sauce around and on top, to complement the flavor even more. I regret not having space for a capuccino jar dessert, which I heard is amazing.Ambience: 5/5The outdoor patio is definitely the place to be. There was background music (Top 40) that was just the right volume. The inside of the restaurant appeared nice too. Service: 5/5The manager greeted me upon entering.
