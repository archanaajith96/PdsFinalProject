However, the food is excellent and very high quality.We started with the guacamole. While the guac itself was great, I wasn't a huge fan of the pita chips they include with it. It wasn't a problem though because I had tortilla chips on hand to substitute.For my entree, I had the chicken breast. They marinate it for over 24 hours, so it is juicy and full of flavor. And finally, the rum bread pudding. As others have said, it's AMAZING. Not sure what makes it so delicious, but it's definitely worth springing for the extra calories.Will be making a point of eating in the restaurant soon!"}, {"review_id": "9wih7LMNhRYW5RPlnem81Q", "user_id": "H_GPtqVU8x8dZ8wjFGENJQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Food was great! Very flavorful and they had a great selection of Gluten Free options!Taking away 1 star based on service. The service was nice but slow and we had to ask for menus, drinks and to order.The other contributor for not getting full 5 stars is the \"first time check-in\" deal of \"free half serving of bread pudding\" is misleading. It didnt say 1 per table. There was 6 of us and although the waiter gave us a full serving it was a bit insulting for 6 of us to get a smidge of a bite bc it still was small. We ordered plenty of food for a hefty bill, seems a bit insulting."}, {"review_id": "ihbJ51HffEa3SysaubOmgg", "user_id": "9fb1LjsbTz_YT81CJLTBRg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "What on earth...HOW is this almost 5 stars?Okay, here's the run down. I got the breakfast sampler (as recommended by a previous reviewer as being fabulous), and my S/O got the steak and eggs. Both were just awful. The eggs tasted WORSE than hotel eggs...PEOPLE. Eggs are one of the easiest things to make!!!!My beans lacked...depth. It just tasted like I was eating beans out of the can. The meat and potatoes were also just bleh. Another reviewer one here stated that their sides aren't that great, which I completely and wholeheartedly agree. Their main dish ain't that much better...My S/O said his steak tasted like there was this gross liquid smoke taste. We also shared a cortado coffee, and it tasted acidic.I'm giving two stars for the rum bread pudding dessert that we got with a yelp check in. It was amazing, and left me wanting more. Every other dish was just trash.I don't know if we came on a bad day (there were only two other couples in the restaurant on a Saturday late morning), or if we must've ordered the wrong thing. It was wayyyy expensive for what the food was. Pics attached. Just don't come here,Lol."}, {"review_id": "eJW3LnpDdK1kS8wqVFp4hg", "user_id": "GFyA9ULGAeD-xZEPto2y7A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "I was so sad when Nazca closed their brand new West Village location not too long ago. It was bright, beautiful, and had some of the best customer service around! It didn't hurt that the food was crazy delicious too. Still, fortunately we still left with Nazca's original North Dallas location to fall back on. And although its interior isn't quite as stunning as its counterpart, the food and service are just as memorable as I recall.This location just serves beer and wine, so I opted for a chardonnay. It was crisp and paired well with my meal of plantains and stuffed seafood stuffed avocados. Generous portion sizes of fresh crab, shrimp, lobster were mouthwatering along with a tangy  dipping sauce for the plantains. Everything came out fast and fresh, and was just as I anticipated. Nazca is a delicious Latin American cuisine worth adding into your lunch and dinner rotation. I know I will."}, {"review_id": "cxOSXnB0q8qdJ416koxW6g", "user_id": "hiMFAnKCtLzPil6_QXSGmw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Let me begin by saying that this is Latin fusion and I would return for the fried yuca even though the spicy ketchup it's served with what I would consider culinary laziness. All in all the food was OK. I ordered the Cuban sandwich based on the fact the my waitress told me the bread used was a French style baguette...which to my disappointment was not. Should have called it a Cuban Torta served with a' jus...that was painful, but sadly it needed. My wife had soup and salad. She never commented on the soup and the salad had way to much dressing. My children both had kids meals which they loved. I would have preferred my kids chicken sandwich over my Cuban sandwich. The black beans were the main disappointment, lacked flavor profile...how do you ruin black beans? oh get them out of a can...maybe?Parking was plentiful and the bathrooms clean as was the restaurant. Service was good enough."}, {"review_id": "ZzhDIxK5Cr2zwDPosUv5EQ", "user_id": "Bgzg5GjuB5Tx9pZMRLEm4g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Cute restaurant located in a hidden area. If you're not paying attention you will drive right by it! I Scame on a Thursday night there was no wait and was quickly sat, the host was very friendly and made us feel very welcomed. While our waitress was not as friendly she took good care of us making sure our cups stayed full and was knowledgeable about the menu and gave great recommendations. If you are a seafood lover then you have plenty of options to choose from on the menu! I however am not and while there are several non seafood options I  opted for the chipotle chicken sandwich with a side of yucca fries because I had never had them. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time, I instantly dug into the burger. It was delicious, the flavors worked beautifully together. The bun they use is A1! I've never heard of amazon bread before but I need it in my life more often. The yucca fries were really tasty I'm happy I tried them. I ended my meal off with the bread pudding which you get for free when you check in and it was yummy!

I wouldn't call it authentic Latin-American food, but more like \"inspired\". Whatever, as long as it's good, right?Breakfast Sampler: *only available during brunch on Saturday/Sundays*The pupusa is on point and fried to a tender crisp. Goes great with the chorizo too. Also comes with scrambled eggs, black beans, and roasted potatoes. We make it a point to come here on the weekends just for this dish. Andes Burger: Great for lunch, in case you couldn't get the breakfast sampler. What's special about it is for the bun--they use that sweet pastry bread with the sugar sprinkled on top that you can find in Hispanic bakeries. Also, the yucca fries, so good! They taste like potato wedges but sweeter with a nice crisp to them. My fiancee will usually order a separate side for herself because they're that yummy.Rum bread pudding:If you check in via Yelp, they give you a slice for free. With that said, it's also really really good. Not overly sweet and has a nice cinnamon-rum kick to it. Pretty much everything I've had here so far has been consistently great. I thought they just opened recently because the staff is incredibly nice, but it looks like they've been around for several years now."}, {"review_id": "eSOqD2Dij97ymTbDCLhFGQ", "user_id": "xTJ9xomRifh-Jbs-clfyDg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "The service here is great and the food is good.

The rum pudding also didn't disappoint.The portions are huge!

(Are pineapples even Latin American? Shrug.) For example, starting with their Latin Breakfast: while the main entree was pretty decent, their sides looked and tasted like any other breakfast you might get at a hotel or a work conference. This isn't to say that it tasted bad, but I expected a little more creativity and Latin influence to go in it. Also, their wraps are made with the same stiff, generically color-dyed flour tortillas you can find in a school cafeteria. They're about as the school cafeteria trays too.Otherwise, the decor is quite nice, and the general ambiance makes it easy to hold a conversation and have a decently nice meal. But they should either re-brand as a generic contemporary American restaurant or seriously try to put some Latin zing in their food."}, {"review_id": "8QNHkfaRLCTzQYPcDNiGFQ", "user_id": "K7OUS9QNKSoWLKkbSWTwMQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/22/2017", "text": "I have had Nazca Kitchen as a bookmark for probably over a year and I finally stopped in this last weekend. We were able to walk right in and get a table with no wait. After reviewing the menu we still weren't sure what to order and asked our waitress. I honestly didn't know if she understood what we were asking half of the time or if she was just tired. We just ended up picking items based on the reviews. For the appetizer we ordered the grilled cheese that comes with a cucumber salad. It was not what we expected at all, in fact it was probably the worst thing we had all night long. It was really salty and nothing really warm about it at all. It took some time to get the waitress to come back over but since we were so hungry we decided to order another appetizer and we weren't going to eat the salty cheese so we tried the cheese bread (which is what we thought we were getting the first time around). We got the half order and this was actually really good.At this time our entrees had come out. I got the fish tacos with salmon and a side of butternut squash. Everything was really good but the portions were small. I feel the salmon tacos were really lacking in the salmon portion and while it tasted good I left hungry. My friend got the steak and corn. The flavor of the steak was awesome as well and again everything tasted good but the portions were small. I think it might be nice for them to mention the ounces of meat you would be getting so no one is shocked by the food amount like we were but the sides were a decent size. We also took advantage of the free bread pudding. It was definitely taste, my friend really enjoyed it and mentioned it was one of the best things he ate.Over all the food was good but disappointed by the service and portion amount. I'll probably give it one more try due to the fact there are so many other positive reviews."}, {"review_id": "ylXrM0qPCF4dVAWGqVqkpQ", "user_id": "utXAtjx4S3OClPGob6eYVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Nazca is in a freshly redone retail area at the Northeast corner of Walnut Hill and 75 Central Expressway.  The entire corner retail area has a fresh cool contemporary urban vibe.  The look and the vibe continues once you enter Nazca.  The interior has an indoor/outdoor feel to it, with the main dining area to the left as you enter and an open, airy section immediately behind the hostess stand which seems to open up to the outdoors. It is clear that someone put a great deal of time and thought into the overall experience.  Very well done, appealing decor and branding concept.  We were seated quickly and as I as dining with someone who had visited Nazca before, I was given several recommendations.   For a starter, I tried the EMPANADAS (1 of each kind).  The empanadas are baked rather than fried ( a BIG plus in my opinion) and are served with savory dipping sauces.  They were hot, flaky and flavorful.  We thoroughly enjoyed them.  My dining companion loved their starter of FISH CEVICHE, which I sampled and found it to be a bit too fishy for my taste.  they loved it, so that's all that counts, right?  My entree was the CHILEAN SPICED GRILLED SHRIMP, which was superb.  Generous portion and tons of flavor.  Doesn't even need the garlic butter.  The other entree was the BUTTER LEAF FISH TACOS, which was also enjoyed on a previous visit, so we knew it was very good.  Once again, no room for dessert.  Service was very friendly and better than average.  Will definitely return to Nazca and even ended up buying a gift certificate to this restaurant as a gift for a coworker.  I would recommend Nazca without hesitation."}, {"review_id": "qcWQimRk8K8FpBlGC0ON2Q", "user_id": "TtyZrb50unBxaTAPZgAqpA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/14/2017", "text": "Bread pudding is delicious!
