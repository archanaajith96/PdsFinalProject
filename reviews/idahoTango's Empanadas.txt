Just stopped by because it was better than any other drive-thru options. Just grabbed 6 Hawaiian empanadas. Hoping for the best. Honestly, it was almost worth driving over 4 hours from Idaho Falls. Hot. Fresh. Crisp. Flaky. Melted cheesy gooey. Delicious!The only hang up is that they charge for water. Even though I've left out some details, you don't really need much more info. Just swing by. Stay in your car. Eat well."}, {"review_id": "8ZHrT8RP1CydkcqkPDfsOA", "user_id": "UWgTtadsPLsyUmi0r94xCA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Well first time at this location....and won't be coming back.I ordered from the vegetarian menu and from the dessert menu too. Drove home about 5 miles away.Both full of meat. They are labeled correctly but the wrong empanadas. I assume the arroz con leche is not supposed to be chicken and potatoes WITH POWDERED SUGAR ON TOP yuck!!Needles to say I won't be going back. If you don't eat meat I'd recommend breaking the empanada open first before taking a giant bite of it."}, {"review_id": "xfE1p1FBJS-698H0Mr-qyA", "user_id": "P-llxhScdegNv4IXQdGZbQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Absolutley love this place. So cheap and affordable! I have tried a couple of different empanadas, and I don't believe I have a favorite yet.
