There was a line at the register, a large group waiting to be seated, several open tables and only one person, obviously overwhelmed, trying to handle it all. I was surprised they didn't have a second person helping her.We were eventually seated and quickly greeted with some chips and salsa. The chips tasted fresh as did the salsa so I thought we might be on our way to a good meal.Our server followed soon after to take our drink and appetizer order. I ordered a Sam Adams Seasonal, unfortunately, they were out of it at the moment. She offered me the Shock Top special which was a tall beer for $3.50 so I went ahead and got that. We also ordered a sangria margarita and the White Queso dip.The drinks were fine but the queso left a lot to be desired because it was served lukewarm and honestly it was closer to the cold side than warm. Had it be anything close to warm/hot I'm pretty sure it would have been good but for this visit it was very disappointing.For our entrees we went with the spinach enchiladas and fish tacos. I'd have to say, thankfully, this was the best part of our dining experience. The food was good and on par with other Mexican restaurants I've been to. There was nothing terribly special about either dish but I certainly don't have any complaints about them either.My biggest disappointment with this visit was the service after our food was dropped off. The restaurant didn't seem all that busy but once we received our food we only saw our waitress once. When she did return we asked for the check and then she never came back. We waited 10 minutes for the check but nothing. Finally we went to the register to see if the person working there could help but she wasn't there either. Once she returned she had to go track down our waitress to get the check, meanwhile a line of people to pay forms behind us. We eventually got our check and were able to pay our bill but it was much more of a fiasco than it should have been.Certainly this was not my worst experience at a restaurant but, for me, there were enough things I found disappointing that I won't be making a return visit anytime soon."}, {"review_id": "dpkYGqHMC83Eeg4qne4rOw", "user_id": "x9JiWza2OcD9NlwdAwkyUQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Upscale Mexican restaurant. Beautiful decor. Very knowledgeable and staff. I had the twin soup and I must say not only is it a feast for the eyes but the flavors were incredible. One half is black bean soup with smoky flavor of cumin. The other is a mild poblano creamy goodness. Separately delicious but when you mix it, heaven. I would rate this in the top 5 soups I've ever eaten. You must try it!!!! The chicken flautas were lovely on the plate and flavorful as well. I really like it when the chef understands we eat first with our eyes. Next time I'm in town, I look forward to returning."}, {"review_id": "LhwQmZ8kI04AoemRHnEnoQ", "user_id": "SPTxzYcuhLL_tYV4oB1qbg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "After moving to AR from TX I wasn't sure if I'd find Mexican food as good as it was back home.

Food: We started out with the Flautas with cheese sauce; these were AMAZING. I could easily order this as an entrée and be a happy camper. The shells were crisp, the meat tender, and it came on a bed of mango salsa that was pretty outstand on its own. We also got the guacamole again and it tasted quite a bit better than previously. Entrees were definitely a hit this time. I got the Molcajete, which was quite the large portion of deliciously sautéed meat and veggies (careful - it's really juicy and will drip); I would say it's superior to the one offered at Patron's, though the meat and vegetables were cut rather sloppily and still attached in large chunks. My husband got the Enchiladas Habaneras, which he enjoyed, but he thinks they are better at Patron's (and you get a larger portion). Overall, I would say the food was an improvement from our previous experience.Service: Definitely better than our first visit, though I don't recall that we received any refills on our beverages. General atmosphere: it was pretty chill when we went, so noise wasn't nearly an issue. However, the seating - the actual booths - are still an issue. We were seated in a booth that was quite uncomfortable: it felt like a pad thrown over a space with no support underneath (springs or straps). We got up and moved to a table with chairs. Later, another couple was seated in the booth we were in and asked to be moved as well. They definitely need to step up and make the seating more comfortable. Final thoughts: We will likely go back when we are on that side of town or happen to be in the mood for upscale Mexican cuisine. You pay a little more, but you get a little more with it. And definitely try the Flautas! I would give them a 3.5 start review if that were possible as the service and food definitely improved over the last time, but service still needs some tweaking and the seating is damn uncomfortable."}, {"review_id": "LrZGODyMdWS3SneWYSWVyg", "user_id": "KUB017Pk0-r0YNO-wm92Mw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2017", "text": "This was the best experience I had in town!

My experience was not that good. No drink menu, no silverware to start off. Server did not no which beers were on tap or what seasonal Sam Adams beer was available. When Sam Adam was taster was brought, we were told they didn't know what flavor it was it still, we passed on it(took margarita).Food came still no silverware. First bite food was good but it was luke warm, plate was hot though. After dinner we were asked if we wanted our penny margaritas. No idea we even had one coming, not to mention no offer for water or another beer. Our penny maragarita took for ever to arrive at which point we were beyond ready to leave but we could get our check. So in summary either they had a really off night(highly doubtful wasn't that busy), or they need to train their staff better. There is more to tell but yelp should get my drift, no reason for me to back for ok food and poor service."}, {"review_id": "E_9w0IBat8oQW8h4G6aQZg", "user_id": "vsL8urQLzFDEGGuxPHHfNw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2017", "text": "My favorite by far!
