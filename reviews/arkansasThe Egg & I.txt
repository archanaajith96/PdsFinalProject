I had the veggie Benedict- their homemade hollandaise sauce is better than anywhere else's! For dessert, my boyfriend I shared the to-die-for, stuffed cheesecake berry french toast. You've never had a decadent french toast until you've had this. Service is wonderful and you can tell the waitstaff and hosts truly work as a team. Whether you want an eclectic, modern brunch like the items I've mentioned or you want a classic meat, eggs and toast- you'll be extremely satisfied dining here. Hats off to the chef!"}, {"review_id": "LIpuItngPAMAfa7w7pPZdQ", "user_id": "Cs1cOr8uWlLZ2jPGqV_Lag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/23/2017", "text": "I went at 11am on a Sunday , they were really packed but the wait was only 15minutes.

There was a wait (a good sign) but it didn't take long at all to get seated. I ordered the \"hitch hiker\" eggs Benedict and let me tell ya it's the best eggs Benedict I've ever had! Two slices of bacon atopped two poached eggs that were perfectly poached and fluffy and tgat dill hollandaise so yummy nice touch! There was asparagus, mushrooms, and diced ham. So freaking good! Also the plate came with a greens salad with a lemon vinaigrette, light and delicious. My daughter ordered the whole wheat pancake and this was also so yummy! Husband got two eggs over medium taters so good and crispy bacon again good. Everything was good down to the last bite! Great service, friendly staff and they serve breakfast all day until 2:30 when they close. This is a major plus for us late sleepers :) overall this is the spot for breakfast!"}, {"review_id": "UzwxN-4FWq6guUkG05c8iw", "user_id": "v0BqugKgcMZvCr6CbleTqQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/26/2017", "text": "I came here to order a late take out breakfast. The staff was really nice,the lady upfront who took my order was very cordial. I order two sausage biscuits with gravy on the side. Also a omelette,to begin with my review lately I have had a obsession for biscuits.This is the reason I came to egg and I. Sadly the biscuits were both very hard and felt like they were cook days ago. I was hoping that they bake their biscuits daily but I guess that's not true. Also the sausage in the biscuit was burn badly. To make matter worse the gravy was overly salted. It really made me sad. I was hoping for something better but I guess it was not to be.The only thing I did enjoy was their kale drink. That was outstanding. At some point I will try the other fresh drink they have.I might try them later on again maybe in a couple of months just to see if this was just a off day."}, {"review_id": "2t9nI5q7C0QXete8fOcFhQ", "user_id": "Fe-AC_A4kqjxY3TJbo4pbQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/9/2017", "text": "Decent breakfast. Be prepared to pay $10-15 per entree. It's not worth the money in my opinion.

Yes, it's true, the prices are a bit high (not by much). However, the food was fresh and you could tell that they put in high quality ingredients. I ordered the Mexican Skillet, and my husband ordered the classic breakfast. Our kids had the pancake breakfast and the French toast breakfast. All of it came piping-hot and well presented. In fact, we were giggling because the kids breakfast was in the shape of a happy face. My son's pancake was whole-wheat! Who does that? It tasted delicious, as did everything else. The service was just as impressive. We were served by Lisa this morning, who took our orders promptly and smiled the entire time. She even asked us if we wanted our drinks to go. We were very impressed by her service. Overall, even if the prices are slightly higher than we're used to, we will be returning to this establishment."}, {"review_id": "ZtJ760c-cp2qOEsn2mGmjA", "user_id": "6ChqncBkY-7PfgV0yEiItA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2017", "text": "Great wait staff, great food.
