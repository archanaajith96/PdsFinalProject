Lychee martini came with lychee garnishes and was tasty sweet. Pineapple mai tai has more volume for its price than the lychee martini, easily just as tasty.We ordered gyozas to start, and these dumplings arrived full and warm with flavor. We followed it up with happy hour choices--shrimp tempura roll, volcano roll--and were pleased with those selections! Added some yakitori--pork belly, beef tongue, and even the quail egg with bacon. Easily filled up on these for a late-lunch meal.Ambiance: definitely good for family and kids, friends hanging out, and singles. Not quite good for a romantic date, but good for a casual date-night.On another visit a couple of days later, I visited with my family. Again, had an order of gyoza to start, my mom enjoyed the stir-fry ramen as she wanted \"chow mein,\" and my brother and I shared the A-Set of yakitori. The A-Set was perfect for getting the meat staples, and we could've followed up with single orders of meat or veggies if we were so inclined. Can't wait to come back and try some ramen.Definitely a spot to recommend."}, {"review_id": "xGJqBfifsn_mPA8aleEkGg", "user_id": "M655cSHlNbsIZf4NfcMN5w", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Wish I could have loved it... 2 stars for having a good waitress but the food was just mehhh. Spent the weekend in San Antonio and was looking for dinner after a long day at Seaworld. I was so impressed by the pictures on Yelp that we changed our dinner plans to go to Wild Goji! My expectations for this place definitely felt short. I ordered by looking at pictures on Yelp and everything I wanted did not come out looking like what I ordered. Although, the waitress did tel me it wasn't.. the flavor was lacking too. I am a huge foodie and sushi eater and got suggestions from our waitress.. all the expensive rolls I got ($17/a roll) really lacked flavor. Although, I did like the sushi pizza. That had a great combo of flavors. I just wouldn't come here again if I ever did end up in San Antonio again. Dinning experience was good but the food lacked flavor."}, {"review_id": "w3-1jFnLfYb70fSEYlSByQ", "user_id": "ZU_2EeNGuUzhp7DIWrM_gg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "I had been wanting to try a sushi-fusion place and I'm glad that Yelp help me find this spot. Traffic getting here was a bit of a pain due to its location, but it was 3:30p. Walked in during happy hour and man.. I was impressed with the hh menu. We tried a few items and all of them were absolutely delicious! The explosion of flavor that each dish had was amazing! There was only one waitress and getting attention was a bit cumbersome. We must have had rolls and appetizers and our bill was under what we thought!

The ramen was good but not the best I've had.. I think that it needs more flavor on the broth. Size was big..

The atmosphere is a little dark but not pitch black. They're playing current music at the perfect volume so it doesn't disturb the conversation but adds a little something extra in the background. When we sat down, our server Ana was absolutely AMAZING! She offered some great menu suggestions and had an answer for absolutely everything! She recommended the Bento boxes, the ginger salad, the water with goji berries, (and explained why there were berries in the water), as well as the AMAZING beef and jalapeño fried rice! We ordered the gyoza as an appetizer and they were delicious. Fried but still noodly, if that makes sense. Next we ordered the Chef Zens chicken bento box the lunch special \"A\" and the beef jalapeño fried rice of course! Everything came out extremely fast and it was VERY FRESH! Ana was extremely tentative and gave us AMAZING service. We will definitely be coming back!"}, {"review_id": "GzyDn7NUqogCoL_jMMCrHA", "user_id": "CfhBf-UFS2uI6Ghe5uR9sQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "This is a little out of the way for me since I live closer to downtown, but my optometrist recommended it (lol of all people!) I loved it! I love the ambience, it was quiet and cute, loved the red accents, the polaroid pics hanging, the atmosphere, all of it. We managed to catch Happy Hour and ordered your basic spicy salmon, rainbow roll, and volcano roll. The volcano roll was especially yummy, so if you can make it for their happy hour, you should! We also got some wine and their mule, both good. The lychee martini was yummy, not my fave, but I still liked it! I think it was worth the drive to try something new and if I'm ever over on that side of town again, I'll definitely check it out! Oh yeah, of course I had to get green tea ice cream - huge serving - super yummy!"}, {"review_id": "sM7Vmyb4zs7FlRQICalGHg", "user_id": "9LroT-wQ4lz2zx_5v9_4Tg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Went here two times.First visit, we had the pork tonkotsu ramen, wild goji roll, dynamite roll, choice A skewers, wild bao, and vanilla tempura ice cream.Second visit we had pork tonkotsu ramen, pork dumpling, spicy yellowtail roll, rainbow roll, sushi pizza, and wild bao.We really like the pork tonkotsu ramen, wild goji roll, and sushi pizza.

I immediately noticed with I ordered the spicy tuna roll from the happy hour menu that these simple rolls were different from the ones I've had at other sushi restaurants. The fish did not have that stale fishy taste and were the perfect texture that indicates freshness. I'm a texture sensitive eater so I judge if food is good and/or high quality based on that. The other items I ordered when I went to happy hour were the poke pizza and a black(?) ramen. Let me tell you, that poke pizza was BOMB. If you can get only one thing from Wild Goji, then it's the poke pizza. The tuna and salmon combo was perfect with the most delicious blend of sauces. The flatbread served with the poke on it is also freshly made! (The ramen was good too, which is a big deal since San Antonio is not known to have good ramen.)Highly recommend Wild Goji for not just the quality food but also the wonderful deals they have on combos and the happy hour menu!"}, {"review_id": "6-Lq-KwCsP6SOLyIwIRnWA", "user_id": "026fsOH-a-lV8IobVNzIkQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "GREAT food, sushi is fresh and service is fast.

It's got a wonderful vibe with a friendly staff. The menu is varied, including drinks. But it just didnt meet the bar.I had the miso ramen with pork, and while the pork was tender and delicious, the broth just sat there for me. Ask for no fish or seaweed if you dont want that off taste of fish and seaweed mixed with your pork. Noodles were too thin for my liking. However......the dumplings, ya'll! I would return for the dumplings and mochi. Those dumplings....mmmm delicious. So much flavor!!!
