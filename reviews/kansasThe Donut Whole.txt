With names to feed your fandom loving soul, like bad wolf, police box, and the homer j...and they taste just as brilliant. I have yet to have one I hate. The coffee is lovely as well, I personally had the vanilla latte, (which was brought to the table by the awesome staff) and it went wonderfully with the nutty maple donut. There is a large area to sit and enjoy everything, from the donuts, coffee, art, free WiFi, and music. It's pricier than your plain boring donuts, we got 6 donuts, 2 lattes, and a bottle of coke and paid around 20$ but it is well worth it. They do offer their donuts for 1$ after 10pm, not as fresh obviously but still fantastic. You can't go wrong here!"}, {"review_id": "kha9Q8L72QqEPEuyAKpZ8Q", "user_id": "dz2ItzCt3DZXmvMuDJA35Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/10/2017", "text": "I tell you what, they have donuts DOWN! This pleasant little \"hole\" in the wall (see what did there) brings immediate joy to my childlike glee for sparkly things. The decor is really marvelous, with a sugary aesthetic of colorful marvels and pictures and randomness. They have an inviting, quiet space up front for screen-zoning on the Wi-Fi -- work, school stuff, emailing, or catching up on Facebook -- if you're not inclined to be distracted by visual novelties, and more cafe-style seating in the back where they distribute their irresistible consumables.If only I'd had this 24/7/365 all-ages venue when I was a younger lass, I might've spent less time driving around aimlessly, looking for a place to fit in. (Though I should say, they sell stuff thru the drive-thru all hours but the doors close at midnight or something for dining in.)The folks running the place are edgy and hip, bringing fun color to the drably conservative town of my youth. And they're very friendly and helpful for choosing the donut-fit that is right for you. And they are consummate professional donuteers. With an amazing amalgamation of creative flavor combinations and colorful presentations, even my drably conservative family, raised on the unwholesome goodness of \"raised\" donuts, gawked in amazement at \"the best donut they'd ever had\"! (Only cake donuts in these parts, kids.) Plus, they serve that amazing Nitro Joe coffee that makes a coffee snob simply faint with desire.So why only four stars? Because the breakfast sandwich with eggs... was it called the \"slamwich\"? ... their only non-donut food option, was sold out by 11. Come on, guys! Plan for a crowd by now! And because the alternative breakfast - 2 coffees and 3 donuts - set us back [cough, gasp, swoon] TWENTY-THREE BUCKS!! Sheesh, on second thought, there's no way the younger me could've frequented this place."}, {"review_id": "VKUNTNvF-QTMFHUJ1mk7Cg", "user_id": "bd_rbeJeBX04Z-gFyhsP5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2017", "text": "One of Wichita's not so hidden gem, and rightfully so. I'm not the biggest fan of cake donuts, but I do enjoy all the unique and interesting flavors. If only they can use the same flavors on fried donuts.Anyways, I ordered a dozen flavors today just to taste test each one. Pro tip; cut the donuts into smaller pieces so you can taste each flavor. Make sure the people you're eating with is cool with it lol. I enjoyed each donut, but I surprisingly enjoyed the coconut one the most. Half of my donut orders were chocolate flavor, and unfortunately I forgot each of their names. Also, don't sleep on their coffee! The mocha is extremely delicious. I highly recommend enjoying a cup with a satisfying donut."}, {"review_id": "K5lLNUrS28bribdFgJpz0g", "user_id": "zw0yB1xA9_QJVVfyh0zBzw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/4/2017", "text": "I'm visiting from out of town and was really pleased with the variety of flavors, the quirky decor, and the amazing  customer service.

I was in a rush and didn't get a chance to open and see what they looked like.. so i was preparing to put them on the sweet table at my sons birthday and I decided not to put them out & serve them because I was too embarrassed by what they looked like. Looks like a 5 year old did them. I took a bite of one of them at the end of the night and they were so stale! I emailed them and told them that it was done horribly and they told me that there usual donut decorator wasn't in and one of the staff did them. I was pretty mad at this point because 1. Why would you have someone do the decorating if they didn't know how to do it instead of calling the customer to let them know so they could order from someone else instead? 2. They had the nerve to send it out looking the way it did and it's obvious that the decorator didn't know what a Pokémon ball look like because they added a black dot in the middle of the Pokémon ball and it looked like eyeballs instead of a Pokémon ball. Will never come back to this place."}, {"review_id": "qNDUNSTIrImJTYS33dRBcA", "user_id": "RZGnwSVMZ1ek-ximMpIqsA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/28/2017", "text": "I love their donuts!! So many different kinds to choose from. Their donuts are discounted after a certain time at night which is something to definitely take advantage of if you like their donuts. I can't remember the time it starts but definitely go early since they may run out of the one you want. Service was great and the workers know which one to recommend for you if you let them know what you're craving. Parking is limited on the side and streets.

I actually don't like cake donuts. Buttttt I really love their Thai tea with boba! It's not too sweet, which is how I like it. The taste also is very consistent no matter who makes it. Sometimes they use a dome lid or seal it. I don't really like the dome lid as it spills over and gets messy sometimes. Last week I went 3 times and each time they had no boba :( and I guess Thai tea is only seasonal? I waited an entire year for this lol.I only put 4 stars instead of 5 because I don't care about the donuts and the time they didn't have boba"}, {"review_id": "V0u0P7v14AnY0x9Y9e6RXA", "user_id": "9u3YF7snePUZIOtyvcWtVQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/7/2017", "text": "Went to college in Kansas for 2 years and found this gem while I was there. The Donut Whole has a hippie vibe but also a fun vibe! It is colorful and has two spaces for seating (one near where you order and another towards the front of the place. The place primarily serves coffee, teas, and donuts. The donuts are uniquely named and delicious but sometimes a bit dry and crumbly. But. The fun names of the donuts with the colorful and creative toppings will still cause you to want to try one! I had their lavender donut that has a light purple frosting and edible glitter. I loved it! I also had their TARDIS donut which was blue with a yellow squiggly line and edible glitter on it. It tasted like blue raspberry and I enjoyed the nerdy flair!For drinks, I have had their bubble tea mainly. I have had their matcha bubble tea, and their rose petal and lavender bubble tea. Bother we're very good and included little pieces of boba (of course).Staff is friendly and they have deals you can sign up for by giving them your phone number. You'll then be able to receive deals via text. You CAN unsubscribe from the text deal alerts. I did when I left Kansas and have not been notified since. Overall. Great place. Fun place.
