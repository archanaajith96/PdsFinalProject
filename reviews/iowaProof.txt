I can't say enough about our experience here! My boyfriend and I came here for our 4 year anniversary and were so impressed!It started off with great service from our host to the server from chef to bartender. The proof crew really seemed to work well as a team here. I think we had close to everyone serve us each of our delicious dishes which was nice to see. Our server recommended the 5 course prefix surprise. Intrigued? We were! It is where they pick out the food to bring and the two of you share. He recommended it to us because we had plans later and the $65 prefix was a lot of food. Now most of the time in fine dinning I tend to leave hungry but this was not the case in the shared $50 a person prefix. I have a strange allergy to Cow and Cow bi-product and they said they are willing to work with any allergy including vegan!Now.... onto the food! I didn't have time or want to snap a bundle of pictures because it was our anniversary dinner but we had anything from mussels to duck a breakfast style hash to manchego cheese and prosciutto. My favorite item we hand that night was the scallops cooked to perfection. This meal was wonderfully balanced and one of my favorite meals I've had in Des Moines so far. I do want to come back on a night and just pick out some of the items on the menu and not go all out! Price point for our anniversary dinner was around $110 and then we got 2 drinks a piece it ended out being about $145 before our $30 tip. Great anniversary dinner but on the high side of price but totally worth every minute and bite! The menu is very impressive! They have really taken time to entice you. Close to everything looked delicious because of all the creativity that went into it. The ambiance is very streamlined and clean! Restrooms were kept up.Hands down we will be back and pick our own things but if you are feeling adventurous and want your server to pick out some tasty items for you... do it! Remember they are more than willing to work with you and you will not regret the experience!"}, {"review_id": "aggPFlmWx45vQFvVAun7RA", "user_id": "JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/15/2017", "text": "This review is for 4.5 stars.A nice higher scale restaurant in Des Moines.  On a Wednesday night it was not crowded at all.  Easily seated, we came in and ordered a few drinks, a double cheese plate ($10), and a few larger plates of mackerel and pork chops.  The cheese was fantastic and a great opener.  Couple that with some good bread and we were off.  The mackerel was a very tasty fish but nothing crazy in terms of taste or presentation above and beyond a typical fish.  The pork chop was fantastic.  Already it had a Korean flare as it was served with kimchi, so I added an egg to bibimbap the dish.  One of the best pork chops i've had!  Fantastic charred outside with some nice sides of brussel sprouts and kimchi.  Beer and wine list is very limited so that' the main reason I'm docking 0.5 stars.  The food is 5 stars, the service is 5 stars, but I'm a drinker and that menu underwhelmed."}, {"review_id": "VntujHq-uTnFenRgZr08iQ", "user_id": "rYm98Hksn7800esYYHFZnQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2017", "text": "I can honestly say this is probably my favorite restaurant in town. And that statement is pretty heavy with my background. Everything about it is so perfect. The menu is seasonal, and small. Not to mention creative and culinarily well created. You can tell someone really put a lot of heart and soul into the recipe development and it definitely shows when the plates come out. They do special events once a month and usually features a chef and a set menu that represents the theme for the month. If you're interested, sign up early! They fill up fast. Great place for a date night. Delicious cocktail menu. They also have a coat check. My boyfriend and I come here for birthdays, Valentine's Day, and anniversaries yearly and it never fails. Whatever it is you guys are doing, don't stop, because you're doing it so well!

I've clearly already forgotten lol.  Great cheeses, but a bit overpriced.  **Tagine - after learning more about the restaurant and their flavor profile, we knew we had to try this dish.  Very savory, and I wasn't entirely sure I loved it...but the flavor was unique and kept me coming back for more.  **Bone Marrow - another nice portion.  I think the side salad with capers overpowered the marrow, but was great eaten just as a salad.  The onion jam however was an excellent accompaniment to the marrow.  We fought over the last bites.  **Pork Belly - just yum.  All of the combinations here worked as well.  We wanted to lick the plate! **Octopus - REALLY good dish, with tons of flavor and texture combinations from the Panisse, Chorizo, Squid Ink, Shisito Peppers, and of course, the Octopus.  This dish is a winner.  **Ribeye - great portion, but we found the steak a bit chewy and didn't really enjoy.  **Panna Cotta - GET THIS. GET THIS.  GET THIS.  Days later and I'm still raving about this dish.  Perhaps it needs a bit of presentation work to get on the Michelin star board, but taste wise, this dish has it all.  Oh and think raw vermicelli on top is weird, it's not!! GET THIS! **Peach Cake - might have been ok if I had tried it first, but since I had the Panna Cotta first, well nothing could compare.  And we were full!"}, {"review_id": "nVyzn2_D9B9kJWuckidnZQ", "user_id": "WxJ6gihpNsfYMEeuPZU6Lg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "LOVE THIS PLACE.

Competes with the best I've ever had in all my travels and in all my years. Beet salad with passion fruit marshmallows, arugula and spinach salad with blue cheese and roasted pecans. The green salad was straightforward but perfectly flavored with the fig dressing. The beet salad may as well have been a piece of art, with flavor to match the appearance. Our table of 4 then shared the grits, fried cauliflower, and kebab platter. Each better than the last. The meatballs on the kebab platter were standouts, the chicken was wonderful. The steak kebabs were just a little tough, but flavored wonderfully by the 4 sauces. The cauliflower was fried but light and flavorful. The grits were covered in cheese and salsa, served in a small cast iron skillet, and had a great home-cookin' feel to them. Finally, we shared a ribeye steak and a pork chop at the table. Each plate was a dizzying array of flavors, with multiple sauces and vegetables. There was not a single bite that wasn't divine. The meat was seasoned and cooked perfectly. We got two craft cocktails that were very nicely balanced, and glasses of red wine that Amy, our waitress, helped pair with the food. Desserts were shared - the chocolate soufflé and the pecan pie. Wow. Here, now, 10 hours after finishing, and I'd give anything to go right back.

That was our experience at proof when we dined there a few weeks ago. When you walk into proof, there's a sign that reads, \"Those who tell the stories, rule the world.\" When we walked out, I understood it more.We were able to get a late reservation for four of us on one of the second Saturdays - their monthly tasting menu evening with the prix fixe menu for $60 a person. From the minute we got there to the time we left about three and a half hours later every detail was exactly as we had hoped hand made for probably the most memorable meal we've had in the last decade.The digs here are very humble. A dozen or so tables make up the restaurant that is surrounded on two sides by floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a downtown park. The decor in here is modern and elegant. I've got some really cool artistic touches throughout the place to let you know they were thinking about it, but not enough to leave you wondering what were they thinking. This most definitely includes the clown picture over top of the urinal in the men's room. Everyone should go see it, and we were told that was encouraged. The best part however, is the fact that our server told us it was placed there to make it so people don't linger. It's absolute genius!To start the evening we had wine and a couple of cocktails. My cocktail included red wine and bourbon and absolutely awesome. Unique enough to make me want to order it, but familiar enough to where I wasn't wondering what I was getting. The bottle of wine that we shared was lovely and came recommended by our server based on our preferences. More on the service later, but this was our first glimpse into how great the service would be here.The prix fixe menu included 10 total courses that came out in perfect intervals. It was pretty amazing to see how everything in this restaurant was coordinated as courses came out for each table exactly when they were supposed to. We had a number of different servers bring our food out and each one knew about how the food was prepared, where it was from and small tidbits about the food that really demonstrated the depth of preparation that each person working here has. The more we thought about it, the more impressive it was.Since the menu changes on each second Saturday, your culinary experience will undoubtedly be a bit different, but suffice to say that the food we ate here was absolutely magnificent. Everything was prepared perfectly, it was plated perfectly and it was delivered perfectly. All 10 courses were brilliant, but a few stood out. The ribeye with pickled onions and greens was one of the most incredible pieces of meat we've ever had and the bread cheese with roasted pepper and bitter caramel is probably the best thing I've ever had to eat. My better half felt the same way. The dish had us chewing longer, savoring and talking about it for the rest of the night (and now 3 weeks later).The piece that really took this place to another level was the service. From the knowledge of the food and wine, to the appropriate amount of banter and always appearing just at the right time, the execution of the staff was sublime.The three and a half our dinner felt like an hour and just kept getting better. By the end of the evening, we had experienced the most complete dining experience we've ever had. I cannot recommend this place highly enough and hope you have a chance to experience it as well. You'll wonder why you didn't do it sooner."}, {"review_id": "zyo8TPRkYgVWRbtjvTqNow", "user_id": "eZ5SIKGfb3ILjstq5t2rPQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2017", "text": "Every single time we come here, it's by far the best meal we've had in Des Moines.

Went with some friends and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience, which was a 4 course meal: honey-sriracha elk salad, venison agnolotti, elk pastrami with gnocchi and red cabbage, and venison oso bucco over polenta. All delicious dishes and very well prepared by the staff, considering that they were working with game. I won't go into too much detail about the food because I was not dining on their normal menu, but it was all well executed. Only critiques are that the agnolotti pasta was a tad too much al dente and the venison shank needed a bit more salt. The staff was attentive, knowledgeable and all four courses came out in good timing. What a treat!We did drink-- 3 bottles of wine between the four of us. We sat at the bar before our table was ready and the bartender was helpful and pleasant. They carried a few wines from Eastern Europe, which I thought was unique.The Teran from Croatia was delicious. At the end of our meal, a woman came over and offered us a sweet, raisin-y dessert wine on the house. It tasted a lot like port, but it was golden in color and I think she mentioned something about a mixture of cognoc. Anyway, it was delicious with our dessert. The jasmine pana cotta was awesome and spot on. My boyfriend ordered a peanut butter and chocolate dessert, which he said was great.  The restaurant's ambiance is white, clean and modern. I hope to get the chance to go back to try their normal menu sometime-- the chef has been nominated several times for a James Beard Award.

More of a California type cuisine rather than Mediterranean. Proof really stands out from other Iowa restaurants in terms of its creativity , artistry and skill in  creating its dishes. The interior is small, open and bright  with a modern feel. I wouldn't really call it cozy, and  when crowded, it would probably get quite noisy . I went on a weekday early after they opened and it was pretty quiet inside. The server was  friendly and knowledgeable. Nice casual setting. There is a bar but the drink menu was quite limited. I had the shoulder steak but I don't think it's on the menu anymore. It was perfectly cooked , good quality beef and very flavorful. I had the beet salad for starters, which apparently  is one of the longest running items on the menu. Also very good. For dessert I had some kind of homemade ice cream, which i would say was good but nothing spectacular. Overall an excellent meal- I'd definitely return."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/proof-des-moines?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
