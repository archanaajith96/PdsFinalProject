Three of us are here for lunch and we were all impressed. This unassuming restaurant was really busy for a Tuesday afternoon. Once we tasted our meals, we could see why. Most of their meals can be made vegetarian or vegan by replacing the protein with tofu. They only use Small Planet Tofu, which is a PNW brand that makes an amazing product. No matter what you are in the mood for, eat here. You won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "m4CGD-JhWsP_dBViz17ecA", "user_id": "sNlGrldTJ0Ke18eACVbOyQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "Food is good. Staff is quick and attentive.

Our server was super friendly, and he greeted my partner and I with a big smile. For lunch, we ordered the special, which was the Apple Cup Burger. This burger had a grilled apple slice and some cheddar cheese on top of it. After eating the burger, I am a fan and want to grill my own apples to put on my burger. To go with the burger we had a bowl of lentil soup. The soup was a great pairing for the burger. I have not eaten lentils much before, but I am interested in trying them again. Other great things include the little square that this restaurant is part of. If I remember correctly there were a few other places I am interested in eating at next time I visit. So give this area a try!"}, {"review_id": "wwhKi0BCWCUFbs-T9T4MmA", "user_id": "esXZ5ERPnn-2t0gBUQpAZw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/12/2017", "text": "I've always had good service here and even better food.  The lamb sandwich is my favorite but the menu has many interesting choices that lead me to trying other items.  I've never been disappointed in any of them. Most main menu items run in the $10-20 range but the quality makes it worth every penny.  The atmosphere is very open feeling with a short wall separating the bar area and the dining area.  There are a combination of tables and booths throughout.  During busy times the entire restaurant can get pretty loud but never so much that you can't have a conversation with your dining party.

Gumbo- The gumbo, oh the gumbo! This is to die for and anyone who is a fan of spicy gumbo needs to head over there right now and get a bowl, not a cup, a bowl of this deliciousness!

Seriously, I haven't stopped talking , thinking or salivating about it. I've searched far and wide for a decent dinner salad menu in Spokane and I've finally found my spot. Now, what do I have to do to have Elk add this salad to the menu permanently? I'll do  a n y t h i n g! It was everything a dinner salad should be: fresh, filling, healthy, protein packed, texture rich and exploding with flavor. The different flavors were out of this world!  Please please please add this to your full time menu! My husband got the southwest taco type salad with  chicken and that was equally as impressive he said. It looked amazing but I was elbows deep in my firecracker to try it. Everything else was also great - service was quick and friendly, snagged a table outside at 630 on a Friday night, and the salsa was to die for too. Well done Elk, you gained a regular even if you won't always have the firecracker (but I hope you do!)."}, {"review_id": "KeoOZCVEOIkmEh3LqdwIGg", "user_id": "kH7EJSyzgLuluEOzMN5T7Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/27/2017", "text": "What a great place to spend a summer evening.
