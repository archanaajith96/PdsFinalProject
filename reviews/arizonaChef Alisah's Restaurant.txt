This restaurant will soothe that nostalgia with their yummy yummy oversized  dishes. The chef, his wife and his son run the restaurant, which isn't fancy, but makes up for it with authenticity. The food is wholesome, not greasy, and blends together so well. Their tzatziki is the best I have ever had. I dream of tzatziki like this. Also, get the lamb. It doesn't matter what dish it's in, just get it. You can't go wrong."}, {"review_id": "Iq-lnyl6tFotNlByLww0CQ", "user_id": "V3g6bX8iVH3iRqNX9GzYUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Wow! So I read the reviews on yelp and went with the recommendation of the surprise plate for two! I'm left speechless! It was absolutely wonderful!!! The restaurant is clean and well lit, the staff is super friendly, the wait time was minimal, and the food was fantastic!!!! I highly recommend trying this place. Finished off the night with a baklava and wasn't disappointed! Thank you! P.S. try the Cockta soda, a Bosnian fave!

We saw Chef Alish's Restaurant and decided it would be something different to try. Checked the website and saw that the food was Bosnia, new to us but had some Greek influence for some dishes and since we like Greek food we decided it was definitely a place we wanted to checkout. Called and made reservations for 5:30 when they opened up on Saturday evening. They opened promptly on time and seated us in a corner booth. Everything smelled great when we walked in the door. We were greeted by very friendly staff and since we've already looked at the menu online we knew what we wanted to order. We ordered drinks which was just iced tea but inquired about liquor,  they said they do not have alcohol. but if we were to bring our own wine they would provide wine glasses and opener. We ordered appetizer Domci Kajmak- Homemade Whipped Cream, this was to be spread on the bread they provided. The bread was fresh baked with a light oil toasted on it. Very nice. Entrées that we ordered were. Sarma- stuffed cabbage leaves. The seasoning was slightly mild but overall consistency and flavor very fresh, very delicious all three people in the party tried these all like them. I think they are better than the Greek version. Mjesano-Mixed Grill: 4 Meat Dishes with Cabbage Salad. The salad was delivered first. Nice size serving. Very light vinegar dressing. Was very light and refreshing nice touch. The meat platter was delivered this was ordered for two people. You definitely get your moneys worth with this platter. We took home enough for two people to have a light dinner the next day with leftovers.  The steak was very tender, the meat patty was reminiscent of Gyros meat but with onions and additional seasoning, chicken very flavorful and tender but the standout are the sausages. All the food is made fresh on location but the sausages are the best. Chef Alish himself came around to the table and greeted us. We spoke with him and asked some questions about the making of the food and he explained the process of making the sausages and the quantity that he makes at a time of over 3000 all by hand all with his own recipes this food is well worth the money I've been to places that I have spent much more money and not got the quality and quality of food that you get this restaurant. To top it all off the desert:  Tufahija - a stuffed Apple. Was awesome. The whipped topping was like a creamy Ice Cream and the apple was very sweet cooked perfectly and finished the meal. My sister and brother-in-law said they would definitely be back to try more of the dishes and myself when I visit again from Indiana I will be coming back here again to try more of the dishes this is a great find for a little restaurant. It's Tucked away in a little strip center. But what a find, you need to try these Bosnia inspired dishes. Thanks Triple D for highlighting a great restaurant that we might not have found otherwise."}, {"review_id": "7jbsQHykguOHXGPGBqZTiw", "user_id": "TVn-1ZUnjzc-mZ6COGKReg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "I found this place to be a bit mediocre formy taste buds.  I'm sure for others it maybe higher especially since last week the owner mentioned that Diners, Dive-ins and Drives will be featuring their place in February.  The owner is a super nice guy and I'm sure it was probably what I ordered.  I will probably give something else a try on their menu before changing my rating."}, {"review_id": "_sXyq8mnc2HLYKg9jPlIMQ", "user_id": "TEWvp1wLClX-P9HbGQMnXA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/13/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We went here today and saw something wonderful.  Diners, Drive-ins and Dives filmed at Chef Alisah's.  I don't want to take credit but if you look at my posts from September 2012 I said that everyone should go to Food Network TV and nominate Chef Alisah's.  I also wrote in and expressed how great this place is and how wonderful the owners are.  When we went in I saw the DDD poster and asked about it.  Hopefully they will air the episode.  As always, today the food was great, service was top notch and Chef Alisah gave my wife 2 candy bars and told her not to share with me!...lol"}, {"review_id": "LxImRyeX3m9GHPbgmnBBBA", "user_id": "o3B-Csnb88k7BXkDHehuMg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/14/2017", "text": "My husband and I think this is one of the best restaurants in Tucson.

Let me tell you why. If I've never been to another great Bosnian restaurant, this place may have gotten a higher review from me.  This is what we ordered: bean soup, Bosnian kabobs, cabbage rolls, chicken paprika, cookie dessert and Bosnian coffee. My favorite item there was the cookie dessert. Sorry. After having been to \"Old Town Sarajevo,\" in Phoenix there just isn't a comparison.  If you're ever in Phoenix, try old town Sarajevo. It's even worth a special trip just for that. And they have great pita and burek.

I ordered the lamb with white beans which was the recommended dish of the day. The lamb was tender, and the white beans had a creamy texture and had soaked up the flavor from the sauce. I also tried some sausages (Cevapi) which had good flavor but were a little too salty for me, and a cabbage roll, which was well seasoned but the filling was too mushy for my tastes.I had my meal with a Bosnian soda. They offer two types: one that tastes like cola and another that tastes like orange. I chose the cola tasting one. It reminded me of a cross between cola and sarsaparilla.Service was decent and either the manager or the owner came by to check up on us which was nice.Overall I enjoyed my dish and if I'm in the area I'll be back to try more from the menu."}, {"review_id": "-CUEPPDyeXBdm85vp6-qGQ", "user_id": "Kv_YBSfHpgzhxVO-4bHegw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/23/2016", "text": "I came in here with my brother because the normal restaurant we would go to was too far away we are so glad that we came in here this is one of the more unique and better meals I've had in a very long time I had the stuffed cabbage which was absolutely perfect and my brother had  a beef dish that was simply amazing and looked a little bit like a beef stroganoff with rice but it was so tender very surprising. we had an appetizer dish with the TadZieke and this red sauce made of vegetables that was just superb.

Do they need to cover some unpleasant smells from their meat? This in intolerable!Went last night with a friend and were constantly looking around for the toilet or a vent that would connect the dining room with the bathrooms while an impertinent, aggressive smell you find in bathroom air fresheners was wafting across the table. But the bathrooms at Chef Alisah are well separated from the dining room , so that couldn't be the culprit. We all thought that it may have been a scented soap from the bathroom and smelled our hands a few times until we accepted that wasn't it, neither. My friend though that maybe the waitress was wearing too much of a cheap perfume, as the scent was always strongest when she rushed by the table - but the same happened when the male waiter passed by. Of course it could have been, gender equality and all, but the same stink? Until my wife found out that it was the little candle, seemingly so innocently burning away. What restaurant would dare to distract their customers' olfactory systems with a penetrating, miserable smell like this? Never again!!!!!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/chef-alisahs-restaurant-tucson-3?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
