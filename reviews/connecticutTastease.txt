These mini donuts are beautiful, fun and unbelievably tasty. Move over Dunkin Munchkins! I highly recommend calling ahead during business hours to place an order in advance. I ordered 2 dozen for $18. The mixture included traditional and chocolate donuts, each uniquely decorated with flavored frostings, garnishes like Oreo cookie crumbs, cereal pieces, coconut and even gummy bears! The donuts are mini, so I budgeted two per person even though they are dense and rich. There is nothing like looking at your coworkers face when they open the box and see these awesome donut confections! And they taste as good as they look! If you don't place an order in advance, I would recommend arriving early as these donuts are popular and may be sold out before 10am. When I arrived that morning, my donuts were ready and packaged in a convenient pizza-box looking container so I was easily able to carry them without ruining the beautiful frosting job. The staff was friendly and efficient. I'm looking forward to bringing these donuts to future events!"}, {"review_id": "eJHvsPZFO5cdtMCqUBEnFA", "user_id": "MIJ6XeneTBYa7LiRDlTs8Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/10/2017", "text": "A cute little donut shop that also sells a small selection of sandwhiches. Each donut is about the size of half a regular donut, which means you have try more varieties without feeling as guilty. It's worth checking out if you want a change.No parking is available, so park on the street. When you walk in, you'll see a display of donuts. No names are written so you'll just have to. They have many variations of chocolate, which is a plus. Haven't tried their sandwhiches though.For a dozen, its about $9, which is a decent price considering the size of the store and that its not a chain."}, {"review_id": "btML-8Q3fX3IebhFk3vDRQ", "user_id": "E9Ew15MoM-yehQjRtVZhlg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "My roommate and I were really excited to check out Tastease based off reviews and feedback from friends.

Went on a Tuesday late morning so didn't run into issues with crowds or them running out of donuts as some have mentioned. Ordered 6 minis for 4.50. Now, they are the most adorable things you've ever seen but the taste was terrible. They were dry as a bone and very artificial tasting. I only ate one in its entirety...the chocolate...but it still wasn't anything special.

I'm here to report that they are even more adorable in person and taste great too! I ordered 2 dozen for $18, and the lady behind the counter made sure to give me one of each. The few I tried were yummy, though not the best donuts I've ever had. They were extremely well-received at the office! Everyone couldn't stop commenting on how cute they were, and they had the best time picking which one to eat. Would definitely make this my goodbye go-to."}, {"review_id": "edhTLrJ8cN_J4atdCNsT9g", "user_id": "8KW9p6xIE1BY2iqEkNkJaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/20/2017", "text": "This place is it's namesake. There isn't a better breakfast sandwich/ donut shop in the city!For an amazing hand made, toasted to perfection sandwich made with actual care for a customer, this will be the only spot that does it in Hartford. With this you can get your strong freah coffee that comes with a free donut. And the donuts? Also amazing! These lil donuts are made with heart and heavy when you eat them. Not the air at Dunkin Donuts you'd get. Something else tbey have is some very cool frosting. There is something incredible knowing an establishment takes time and puts into their product.To top this all off. The prices are wonderful! If you read this, PLEASE I recomend you go!

Also, it's not in the best area. I wasn't concerned, but it surrounding buildings didn't seem as nice as other areas of Hartford we visited.

We drove there on Saturday morning, we got there at 8:30 (30 minutes after they open). As we got in we saw the doughnuts, they had about 100 doughnuts and we were the only costumers in the store. We asked to get 3 doughnuts and the women said \"we don't have any doughnuts\". It was weird and we thought she's joking, but then she actually didn't give us doughnuts. We weren't sure what's going on so we asked if she actuallly mean it because obviously they had doughnuts. She said \"no, we don't have doughnuts we sold them\" even though it was was in front of us. At this point I told her \"can we not get these doughnuts here in front of us?\" She said \"No I'm going to give it to someone\".I told her thank you and we left. In my opinion, a doughnut place should have doughnuts on a Saturday morning 30 minutes after opening, the workers should at least be a little nicer and say these are reserved for whatever reason (assuming that's why she said we dont have any) But this place didn't care or want to appreciate that a costumer came to buy their doughnut and not repeating \"we don't have any doughnuts\" when there's 100 doughnuts in front of us."}, {"review_id": "9pHk8aaLSGmKpLxq5Q-0fA", "user_id": "Ff4nycAyaYsASUSXk7aIeg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/10/2016", "text": "Like many people, I have a pretty big sweet tooth and I had a craving for a really good donut. I've seen the place on Yelp and Instagram and was excited to finally try it out on my only day off. I didn't know what to expect, the place was smaller than I thought and so were the donuts. But for such a small place and mini donuts, boy did they offer such a big variety! I would define the place as small but mighty! Freshly baked and the mini donuts let you eat more than one (or justifies eating many of them). I ordered a dozen and it came out to be about 9 bucks (including tax). Their donuts are moist, soft, and so cute.  Love this place, it was worth the 20 minute drive in the pouring rain!  Shame the place isn't open later though!"}, {"review_id": "63B4F_SF735MQuxVtdFySA", "user_id": "g-ygenHVN-hWt2ogMHgXwA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/17/2016", "text": "Creative donuts that are always a hit at office gatherings.

I have picked up a party platter of their mini donuts to bring to events several times, and they are always a hit! I really enjoy the German chocolate cake flavor. I have to say that some of the donuts are a tad on the dry side (most are variations of old fashioned donuts) but the delicious frosting and toppings even it out.Those with comments about 'how bad the area is' have most likely never left the suburbs of CT. Parkville is a nice area of Hartford filled with families. There is a school and a church within one block of this location so I don't think people have much to be worried about at this location.

The location is a little intimidating, but the donuts are worth the stop. 3 donut dough flavors and a variety of flavored toppings. The regular donut dough has a very distinct flavor, but I'm not certain what the spice is. Whatever that spice/flavor is, I'm not a lover of it, but the chocolate and blueberry donuts are delicious. I would rate it higher if the location were better and if they had enough product to last throughout the day. I have to be at work before they open, and their donuts only last a couple hours.

Everyone raved first about how pretty the donuts were -- and then how amazing they tasted.Most of the donuts' flavor varieties come from the toppings or icing, but there's still a nice variety of cake flavors -- chocolate, vanilla, blueberry, even cherry!Also, I heeded other reviewers' suggestions and called a day in advance to pre-order.  My donuts were ready and waiting for pick-up when I arrived at 7:05 a.m., and the woman at the shop was so kind.Great little gem of a shop.

The new owners were much better and the prices have sky rocketed (almost $1 per). The flavored doughnuts (ex. Red velvet) are bad at best. They have no flavor and are definitely not made with the best ingredients. There are some flavors that used to be made that they don't make anymore... especially seemingly ones that cost more to make. I wouldn't go here if you are looking for something that is a reasonable price, or that actually tastes good if you are trying to impress a group."}, {"review_id": "3jQV07xw-uDpgBS2a6sm2Q", "user_id": "1dkGNKQ_O80j-9e1YrLNLA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/14/2017", "text": "Turned away because the 1 person there was too busy with pre-orders, yet there were no other patrons.... dirty interior, donuts looked stale.
