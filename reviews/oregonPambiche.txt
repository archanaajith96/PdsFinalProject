I have suggested that many many visitors and locals as well go to this restaurant for some great Cuban food. Unfortunately, after my last visit I will not be coming here any more. Now, you may think that this decision is a bit harsh, however, the service and the food quality has been declining for a while but I was in denial (the service faster than the food quality). The time before last after having an ok meal I passed it off as the waiter just being in a bad mood, but I just can't use that excuse again. My husband and I chose to eat here because we were craving some good Cuban food. Upon our arrival, we were asked where we wanted to sit and since the rain let up we decided to sit outside. Sitting ourselves at the small tables the hostess asked us if we wanted a larger table and we said we were ok. When our waiter came out to take our order he became angry and told us we couldn't sit there. He probably was trying, in his own way, to warn us about the impending rain, but at the time we were just trying to figure out why he was so angry at us. Well, the rain started so we moved to the larger table and again he came out, not to our table but to speak to another waitress obviously  rolling his eyes and talking about us. We couldn't believe what was going on - you can't make this stuff up . My husband asked the waitress that our waiter was speaking to if there was a problem, because after taking our initial order our waiter never came back to check on us, and she replied that there was no problem. We were dumbfounded as to why the waiter had seemingly chosen to abandon us and tried to recollect the interaction after receiving our food which was delivered by yet another waitress. The food was just ok and we had to flag someone down to get more water. I still cannot believe it, as I write this review. It was very surreal and I cannot believe we didn't make more of a complaint. I am really sad to say that we will not be back."}, {"review_id": "Ri_e2HfX7sJjobqHCGfwQQ", "user_id": "ySPssX587YxGwknxyCYv3A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Delicious.  Excellent service.

Food was 4.5 stars as overall is great except come miss on the beans part. Service was also hit and miss as they probably got too busy.Started with a appetizer sampler for \"first round\" of everything: ham croquet was crispy but I wish the inside filling is a bit more firm, the fried taro roots were meh, the beef empanada was flakey and flavorful (especially with the banana ketchup they bring to the table)!I got the oxtail for main and my partner  ordered the fried cow with beans. My oxtail is the BOMB - the sauce with sautéed pepper and onions with slow cooked ox tail bones has the perfect balance of spices. The meat was juicy and melting off the bones! The corn fritter that came with it was perfect pair to the sauce. All in all it's a high score.My partners fried cow was more like 7 compare to oxtail dish. The meat was good but slightly dry from the frying - but goes well with the garlic sauce. The fried plantains were actually tastier than expected. He was disappointed by the beans that came with, way too watery!"}, {"review_id": "xlMX8mzk0kbz0zdh6KYupQ", "user_id": "aHaVupfs2Hc2wm8A4w01aQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "My husband and I gave Pambiche dinner another go and we are so happy we did!

Sign me up for some Pambiche. This is probably one of my favorite finds since moving to the Portland area. It is so different and unique, it is a spot I bring family visiting from out of state. We have had a few different things on the menu and everything is killer. The coffee drinks and deserts are something that we don't normally get when we go out but here they are a must. The flan is so silky, sweet, and addictive. The empanada  is killer, so soft flaky and beefy. You can get it as either an app or a entree. When we go we like to split an app, entree, and desert because it is so filling and you just want to eat everything. The inside of the restaurant is small and can be warm but they also have outdoor seating."}, {"review_id": "yWf7nkSc_pNhicwtmkNBRA", "user_id": "WKfkkrtE6pFEQQ7AEc7zrw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "Been here for dinner and dessert.

As for food, I ordered the Revoltillo de Chorizo (Cuban Sausage Scramble) $12.50 -- by the way, the pricing on their website is old. Everything was delicious and customer service was awesome.

Bright vibrant colors on the walls and bright vibrant flavors in all their dishes. Waiters are very cool and know their stuff but don't ask for a recommendation because everything is delicious. They don't take reservations (small clipboard by the outside front door to write down your name and if you want to sit inside out outside). Outside has heatlamps so it's not bad. The Santiago cocktail and Floridita daiquiri are my favorite drinks. Maduras and avacado salad are a must to start. Vaca Frita, camarones, and Cuban plate are all good bets (I like the confri instead of black beans and white rice)."}, {"review_id": "b2kJ7gduW0UO-ZZIwWqi2A", "user_id": "cHW5VhgcSnpPd9aXFKq-Pw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "DELICIOUS!

I enjoyed it a lot with the slaw it came with (no rice needed). Bf got the tecate ($2.50 HH price can) and I had a hibiscus/ginger/rum HH drink I think $7 or $8. I asked if the alcohol was kinda subtle and our server said it was (imo, it was strong as hell so if you guys are looking for a strongish drink this might be the one).

I'd highly recommend coming here for lunch time rather than dinner though just because there's a $6-9 price difference for the exact dish. There were seven of us and we were seated immediately, although the restaurant started getting crowded by the time we were done. We all started off with some drinks on the happy hour menu. I got the El Presidente ($8.50), which was their version of a Manhattan. This drink was so strong! It will definitely get you feeling all warm and fuzzy with each sip. As for the food, I got one of their most popular items: Rabo Encendido ($16.50). Oh my goodness, the oxtail meat was so juicy and tender. I hardly had to use my fork as the meat just fell off the bone. The menu description said it best --don't be afraid to pick up the bone with your hands as I was licking every piece of the meat and juices off every inch of the bone and plate left. The white rice and cabbage went perfectly well together to even out how flavorful the oxtail meat was. In addition, I ordered the Pollo Frito ($6) off the HH menu too. The chicken here was also super tender as well, but the flavor was standard. There's definitely something special about how delicate the meats are cooked here.I was also able to sneak a bite from the rest of my party, which consisted of a variety of Empanadas ($4.50). Although I'm not a huge fan of empanadas, these were definitely one of the most soft and not dry ones I've had. Our table also had an order of the Yuca Frita ($6) to share, which I found quite bland. While the food was good (especially the rabo encendido), our service was quite mixed. It started off fine until our server confused us by reinstating that we could not take home anything ordered from the HH menu even if we insisted that we'd pay for the regular menu price in order to take it home. They did try to make it up to us by giving us a complimentary dessert, especially because this upset the birthday girl in our party. In the end, we refused the complimentary dessert, but they still brought out a cake for us to sing happy birthday nonetheless."}, {"review_id": "01-DGm7_5Lr2TYzg79adfQ", "user_id": "VQHGa-IDJVs0pO50mOIYfA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/26/2017", "text": "I don't think it needs to be said anymore but the empanadas here are so good! They're made fresh to order, so each order takes about 15 minutes to get out, but they're so so worth it. The crust is flakey and buttery, the filling is piping hot and flavorful, no matter which meat you pick, and two make for a fairly sized meal.  My friend and I split two plus some croquettes and we were pretty full.The service staff is super friendly and helpful if you're the indecisive type (aka Me!). They have a little parking lot and some outside seating. Inside is a little cramped, but there are enough tables to choose from that you wouldn't have to deal with that issue if you brought it up. Besides that, the imported sodas are pretty good. I forgot what my friend got, but I got the coconut one and it was very pleasant."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pambiche-portland?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
