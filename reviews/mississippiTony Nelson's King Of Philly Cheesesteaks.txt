Its always good to support local establishments and prior military (After looking on Yelp, Tony is a retired Air Force member) He actually was cooking the day I came in..As others have mentioned, it's kind of confusing when you enter.. Where do I go to order?!? Where is the menu is?!? The menu is on the wall over by the cooking area and then you have to walk back to get to the register to pay.. Layout is very odd, but they did soothe the pain by having pamphlet menus at the register.. This place is a couple notches better than your chain sandwich spots like Jersey Mike's and Lenny's Subs who sell \"Philly\" Cheesesteaks..I elected for the 12\" Chicken Philly with bell peppers w/ mayo and Provolone cheese and an order of fries.. I used my Yelp check in for a free drink, which I chose there regular lemonade..The food is made to order and was delivered to my table.. Which was a nice surprise, because you normally get, \"#13!?! Your order is ready!\" Also, I was in uniform and the staff recognized military ranks, because while I was eating I got.. \"How is your food MSgt\" which was a nice surprise! The Chicken Philly was massive! You can tell they used real chicken vs your normal \"steak-um\" style meats.. My only recommendation would be to add more seasoning to the chicken.. I had to go and get some salt/pepper packets because I thought it lacked flavor..The fries were just fries..If I could do it over, I would have gotten chips.. They weren't bad, but they weren't delicious..The lemonade was nice and sweet! I really enjoyed that.. It was like it was homemade, which is always a plus!Overall staff was friendly, and the food was good for a nice lunch spot!If I am back in the area I would return"}, {"review_id": "Ap_wMnLTzOSi5DnXI_XfcQ", "user_id": "YO9G7vPqqADnCWPclTWgLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "This place does it right! And use the \"check in button\" in yelps app before you order for a free drink. My wife and I split the 3 cheese philly  and cheese fries. Philly was amazing with the cheese on the bottom! Everything was hot and fresh. Great philly and fast. Fries were hot with good ole ball park nacho cheese on them. We loved it. With the free drink the wife and I ate for 13.00 OTD!

Best cheesesteaks I've ever tried!! You really can't go wrong ordering anything bad on the menu. It's pretty tasty and satisfying. Sandwiches are HUGE...you probably need to unbutton your jeans to make more tummy room or come in sweats! Lol. The restaurant is very well maintained. I appreciate clean, well kept restaurants. It shows pride in their place. Tony (the owner) was there cooking the cheesesteaks. He was so nice and welcoming. Gosh, he even walked out behind the counter into the dining area and talked story with us for a little bit. Amazing service and amazing food!

After my first one, I always tried to find my way back to those gastronomic delights known as Philly Cheesesteaks. I have had so called \"Philly Cheesesteaks\" all over the US only to be disappointed. Not this time. You can imagine my surprise to find one just like the original in Gulfport, MS of all places. Tony Nelson, the sharp Philly native found himself in Gulfport courtesy of Uncle Sam. He like me never tasted a so called Philly Cheesesteak outside his hometown. He dedicated himself to recreating the original here in Gulfport. And I'm here to tell you he has succeeded. My wife and I each had one. She like me enjoyed the unique flavor of the \"Original.\" We also had some fries(very lightly battered) that were excellent. The food here is simple but brilliant in it freshness and flavor. Tony is quickly developing a reputation for something unique on the Gulf Coast. After tasting the results of his dedicated efforts I can surely see why. I plan to return every time I am in town."}, {"review_id": "gxdxk2KFH8KZDuu7RuhxQg", "user_id": "Df81tgjljCcSZ_DJC01o6A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "We tried it and loved it!!!
