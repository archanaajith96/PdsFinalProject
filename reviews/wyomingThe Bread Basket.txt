Sandwiches are simple. Lots of options with different combos. Didn't expect much being a LA girl in a tiny deserted city.

In particular, sandwiches and wraps are quite hearty and feel good for you, even the meatier ones like the three meat (turkey, ham, roast beef). They've got some decent combos at lunch (sandwich, soup, salad, cookie) and prices are incredibly reasonable, at least by coastal big-city standards. Service is very personal here, and while the whole venue is more of a working bakery and store, there are still a handful of tables for folks to sit and enjoy their treats. A great find, thanks to all you Yelpers!"}, {"review_id": "GjLTXJqLsxR2I932XpvjOg", "user_id": "QFWi7t7ZskcLgerVslF1TA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/24/2017", "text": "Here's why yelp is pretty cool. I was in a time crunch and ravenous for some food. It was tempting to snag an Arby's or some other corporate chain shops, but pulled up yelp and this place popped up. I ordered the half roast beef on wheat with all the fixings, a thing of chips, and a drink. Sandwich was good. Nice meat to bun ratio and plenty of mayo and mustard to lube it down the throat. Around lunch time on a Friday it was difficult to find a seat inside but I took my chances with the breezy outside. Almost came back for their delicious looking deserts. I'll save those for next time. Great little place to grab some lunch!"}, {"review_id": "0jy9qBIfX8e1WW8BHHWNTQ", "user_id": "LsPSl5V0Q3FlxHSDPB-FBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "We have been eating at the bread basket, for about 7yrs.
