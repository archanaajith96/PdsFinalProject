First off - I am so proud of Los Andes and the team. They worked so hard, countless days/weekends/years to build this restaurant into what it is today and their hard work is so evident! The food: Oh the flavors, the colors, the aromas. We always (always!!) order a ceviche martini - literally the best ceviche we've had in America and Cancun combined. The spicy sauce that comes with is incredible and we always ask so we can dip every piece of fresh seafood in it one more tip before bringing it to our mouths. Also on the appetizers, we love the empanada de arroz. It is so soft, flakey, and fresh. We often get 2-3 because they're only $3 a pop. The empanada de pollo and queso are good, but not as good as de arroz! We're also big fans of paella - which comes in a huge portion! It's very flavorful and not at all short of the good stuff (shrimp/mussels). The stuffed chicken is also a go-to, however I found the chicken was less flavorful than the other dishes. The ambience: The place is huge and can seat so many! They also now have an outside patio which will be wonderful in the summertime. They have large tables for groups up to 20 and intimate 2-person-dinner booths. For dinner, we often make a reservation ahead of time or we'll have to wait a very long time. But we've also come around 2-4pm and gotten a seat without an issue! The serivce: This is where Los Andes thrives. The people who work here are just so lovely. Always smiling, helpful, funny. The waiter explains every dish to us without any rush, the busboy is incredibly quick in taking away finished plates and replacing spoons. And when the owners make their rounds, they make you feel like you're a specially invited guest in their home! Just lovely. Overall, one of our favorite places in providence. And seeing how many wonderful reviews they have - it only makes sense."}, {"review_id": "kmkXFq4kgmuxahu57byg3g", "user_id": "r5ONNeHV-gBAFnvifSgd0Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "First time here. Made reservations. I would recommend doing that. Wait time was 90 min at 6:00. Parking is scarce but they do valet.Good drink selection though no Latin beer on draft. Cervchi appetizer was excellent, stuffed mushrooms were tasty, spicy but not hot. I prefer them a bit more crisp on top but that didn't take away from the taste.My chicken Napolitano was very good, served over creamy mashed potatoes with a sweet sauce. Asparagus was cooked perfectly. Steak dish was delicious, we'll seasoned  topped with egg, served with rice and fries.Ask for the house made hot sauce, not really hot but it is good! Large portions, we all left with food.We had no room for dessert but the selection looked good.Will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "K8RFga-QfQeo1aMjM16A6Q", "user_id": "89pgchYZiUJzYwPVpSGQcQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "My experience here started a bit rough but I think overall it was salvaged pretty well. My parents and I had made a reservation, but when we arrived things were pretty busy and we were told to wait 15m in the line until our table was free. The time goes by and there is no sign that anything is happening, as more people continue to come and go. When we asked about the status of our table, we are told that we were already seated, but clearly not. Several more times we were told \"just a few more minutes\" as the staff spoke to each other with seemingly not much idea about how to proceed. After about another 15 minutes a manager finally got us a table.My dad was a little pissed at the whole situation, but the manager was very apologetic and comped us a couple appetizers that we most likely wouldnt have been adventurous enough to try on our own (like the beef heart, which turned out to be delicious).  We also ended up with a huge amount of leftovers due to the generous portion sizes.Overall, the experience seemed pretty disorganized at first, but they made things right and we left mostly enjoying ourselves. Giving them the benefit of the doubt on a busy night, so I'd definitely like to come back here at some point."}, {"review_id": "cuGlq4z2VtGzQ5KhogSidw", "user_id": "J3QcmLmHBAPaOI1Y1YUFcg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "I rarely do short reviews.  But here it goes- BEST BOLIVIAN GIMLET.

The food, the staff, the drinks, the insides...it's a fun time every time we come. We love the saltenas, lobster paella, and the ceviche - if you're a big fan of the ceviche sauce, try a tiger shot. The steaks, beef heart, and beef tongue are also good - always tender and well seasoned. The food is really, really filling and always has generous portions, so either come super hungry or plan on splitting a meal (or taking home leftovers!).I love coming here with groups because at so much fun to try different things and it's super group friendly. Definitely make a reservation though because there's almost always a wait. (Although, if you don't mind a little wait, the drinks are totally awesome. My favorite is the Pisco Sour!)"}, {"review_id": "GYKtAtak7iEaCRyTIofDDA", "user_id": "HtzGBeEJ7Y5UV-_uGO52oQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Amazing food, service, ambience...would come back to Rhode Island for this restaurant!!DISHES ORDERED:- chicharron: pork ribs, Spanish corn, red onion, lemon, tomato, cheese [dry meat/too much corn]- paella clasica: sausage, clams, super good rice, squid, chorizo [love!]- ceviche clasico: mussels, clams, shrimp, red onion, scallops, Spanish corn, fried peanuts, lime dressing [love!]- pescado a lo macho: tilapia, clams, mussels, squid, shrimp [love!]My group of 5 made a reservation the day before. Seated and served bread and oil immediately. Wonderful snacking on the bread while looking through the ginormous menu of delicious-sounding food! We settled on the above mentioned dishes. Loved everything except maybe the chicharron - ceviche was amazingly fresh, and all the seafood dishes had plentiful seafood, flavor, and love! The only complaint was the chicharron, which was surprisingly dry - almost choked on the first bite.Overall, lovely restaurant with great food and service - 11/10 recommend!"}, {"review_id": "vxRzHQS9Tq-zHb8q9b_jcg", "user_id": "iTYMt65AoQUWlly38D0Hzw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Truly not a single thing I can say that hasn't been said. Los Andes is top notch, plan ahead and make a reservation, and prepare for a meat heavy but amazing meal (and several subsequent meals - I often get 2 meals out of my leftovers), get a pisco sour.I do have one thing to add: they're now offering delivery through Grubhub!!!! With a limited menu, but still!! My wallet and waistline are now groaning. I still recommend going to the restaurant for the whole experience, but this is a nice option for locals who have been many times if you suddenly start craving Lomo Saltado."}, {"review_id": "zd-LR9mz8ctszf5sw7bdOA", "user_id": "BaZh3zF3_jtQEKIy3U93PA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/29/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This being our second time here and choosing it for our birthday celebration last night, I'd have to say this time was not as impressive as our first visit.To be honest, it was underwhelming and if it had been our first as it was for our friends, I don't think we'd have chosen it again.The holy water was good but honesty pretty weak.For appetizers we ordered the calamari and sushi. The calamari was ok at best but the sushi roll was mostly just rice and not a lot of fish at all.Our service was pretty slow. We ordered a pitcher of sangria for the ladies but the men didn't get a chance to order beverages and it took awhile for our sever to come back.My husband ordered the lobster paella and it had such a Smokey flavor I only took one bite and the taste was a complete turnoff. My husband basically only ate the lobster out if it and didn't even want the leftovers. I ordered the seafood mixed dish with part ceviche and part fried seafood . The ceviche was way to limey for taste and honestly I've had way better. I'm not a fan of fried food anyway but it was just ok.I don't think we will return anytime soon with so many great restaurant options around. After our first visit this was very disappointing.I even woke up sick later on in the nite. Not sure if it was actually the food that had me feeling terrible or what but it sure was a coincidence."}, {"review_id": "iFis-4D6IJbaZOWfhE6zAQ", "user_id": "_atcNbmzUaIE8UIjwMXfAw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Portions are huge- like 3 dinners worth.

Someone's going to have to carry me out in a wheelbarrow. (Do those still exist?) Los Andes is quite deceiving. You come up on an unassuming, unimaginative looking building on the outside, walk through an almost hidden door, followed by a narrow plain bar area, then voila! Clearly I have somehow entered a portal that's transported me to a vegas steakhouse. Ginormous dining area, well dressed wait staff navigating tables in what seems like fast forward, laughter, exuberant conversations, huge sculpture, fish tank....this is a lot! If you don't feel the life in this place, you've probably died. None of it means anything If the food isn't good, and good it is. Scratch that, it's fantastic. My personal fav? The cheesy rice.

The decor and ambience is great...and got even better as the restaurant started getting packed around 6:45 pm. We got here at 6 pm. Incredibly festive and casual. The customer service is astounding and the food presentation is excellent. The cuisine is very different than what is typically available...and I would say the food is hit or miss. My co worker and I both felt we could have made wiser choices in our selections. Neither of us were overly impressed with our appetizers or entrees, but I gave the restaurant the benefit of the doubt. My co worker, however, was very unimpressed and didn't understand why this place is a top reviewed restaurant in the state. I can understand why.Our waitress got a manager despite us not saying it was necessary and a manager came over to us to genuinely apologize about our lack of top level experience. He offered to bring my co worker a new dish altogether, but she was both full and not having it anymore. They sent out two complimentary shots of limoncello without telling us. They definitely value their patrons' experiences as a top priority here, and I have nothing but the most respect for that. We fly out back to Texas tomorrow, but if ever back in the area, I would definitely come back to give them another try."}, {"review_id": "X-2UPhpo2dDM6ohVQ0Y0gQ", "user_id": "jx6_IglWNfuCpLQ41ppM2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Still the best of the best.
