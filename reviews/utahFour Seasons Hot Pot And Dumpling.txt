So you'd this FS would capitalize on this market and do the bare minimum. But no, this family run business does a great job of holding its own with lots of variety of toppings and FINALLY bringing back dumplings after an absence of what seemed like forever.This is a buffet style hot pot experience. The owner brings you the broth, you can get chicken, spicy, or half and half. Note: spicy is SPICY. Then grab all the toppings you desire and eat to your heart's content. There's even ice cream to close out the meal. They have SOUP DUMPLINGS here! Much to our surprise, they were pretty good given there's not many places you can get soup dumplings in Utah. Pricey but if you're looking for XLB, it just might be worth it for the craving. The owners are super nice and the bathrooms are clean. Overall, why the heck not?!"}, {"review_id": "g4V28kWLXDaGBK85LYoPhQ", "user_id": "rOosiqgsy2oi2OL2530nkg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Best of the best. I so love the hotpot here!!!

Overall, it's a great for date night or a fun dining experience with friends. Here's what they did right: 1) all you can eat is always a plus somewhere like this. You're not sure what you're gonna like, so sampling a lot of options is always great. 2) the food actually tasted really great after it was cooked. Noodles especially were delicious. 3) super friendly owners/staff. Whenever I had to ask, they were willing to help me what to do next.Here's what could've gone better: 1) even though the staff was friendly, I had no idea what I was doing. No idea how long to cook anything, what to do, what tasted good in which broth. It really needs to be explained or have clear written instructions somewhere. 2) the setting could've used some work. We went on a summer day and it was more hot and muggy in the restaurant than it was outside. Cooking food over hot broth when it's 80 degrees inside the restaurant is a bit rough.Overall, I would definitely go back, but probably when it's winter time. I'll also probably try to go when it's very slow so I can have some more instruction from the staff. Oh, and save room for ice cream sandwiches. Yes, they're store bought, but a great way to finish off the meal!"}, {"review_id": "9e71YTPmZAbutGWS9CKiBA", "user_id": "SfJrnZVePBzslrYjOyUy4Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/22/2017", "text": "What is Hot-Pot? - Hot-Pot is a style of Chinese food prepared with a simmering pot of stock at the dining table (think...Chinese fondue). While the hot pot is kept simmering, ingredients are placed into the pot and are cooked at the table. Typical hot pot dishes include thinly sliced meat, leafy vegetables, mushrooms, wontons, tofu, and seafood. The cooked food is usually eaten with a few different dipping sauces that he establishment provides.Summary: Fun and interesting new experience for me. Really nice and helpful owners who will help you navigate the hot-pot landscape. Especially if you have never experienced it before.  With that said, I did not feel that the food was above average, or amazing in any specific way. However, the service, experience, and overall value led me to give them a 4-star review. Please note, these are my personal observances, I am by no means an experienced hot pot consumer. -------------------------------------------------------------------The atmosphere (3 stars) - This interior is a bit run down, and it is VERY warm. I am sure in the winter this would be a plus, but in the heat of the summer, it was a bit overwhelming. With that said, it was clean and well kept.The food (3 stars) - The food is good. Not amazing, but good. They have a hearty selection of meats, vegetables, and carbohydrates to mix and match your \"hot-potted\" goodies with :). While the selection is broad, I feel that the quality of the meats could be a bit better.Service (4 stars) - The service was exceptional. This was our first time eating hot-pot, and the owner was delighted to help us navigate through the different options that we had while eating. Value (4 Stars) - You will end up spending around $16pp, but it is all you can eat, so you can guarantee that you will not go away hungry. As an added bonus, they do have various ice cream cones and sandwiches for you to enjoy for dessert. Will I go back sometime? - most definitely"}, {"review_id": "2th3MxWPtm_Bj8h7UMnhKw", "user_id": "1btXpyYOahn30qTYkbV7Ow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/24/2017", "text": "We were introduced to Hot Pot 7 years ago and this place will always hold a special place in my heart. The owner (we just knew him as \"Boss\") is so friendly and helpful. The location is small but very clean and well maintained. I love the food, we just sit and eat and eat. I love the veggies,my husband's loves the meat, it's all great. You have to call ahead to order dumplings which we've never done but they look so good so we will the next time we go. It may be different and there are a lot of tips that make it easier so either google how to eat Chinese hot pot or even better, go with an experienced diner. Just go!

From picking broths, identifying foods, and proper cooking time for each item - he guided us through our first hot pot journey.This is truly an all-you-can-eat experience. The usual shame and dirty looks are replaced with a proprietor who spiritedly encourages you to eat more and more until you cry uncle.Being our first trip, we put a little bit of everything into the pot. The downside is we started to lose track of what we had dropped in. Next visit I would be more strategic.Bottom line: Atmosphere, decorations and lighting are very casual. The wow factor here won't impress your date or spouse, but the relaxed, unhurried novelty of trying something new will still be a memorable experience."}, {"review_id": "zi888tOn3MKf84pVx6wG9w", "user_id": "IkAB6CJAEfMC7HH7JcxWgg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "I'd never had a hot pot, so this was a treat.

It's all you can eat delicious food that you cook in a broth of your choice. They have Miso broth, chicken broth, or my favorite spicy (with varying degrees of spice). The food is anything from shrimp to beef to chicken to tofu and they even have ice cream bars that are included. If you and a friend want different broths, not a problem. They have half and half pots. The Wangs (owners) are really nice and straight from China. They know hot to hot pot. The price is around $17 a person, but totally worth it and when you're stuff, you don't feel gross."}, {"review_id": "rSelvI28fbgoCy9shO6NdA", "user_id": "dsGuyE42koIp7PTd47fuww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "A favorite for me and my husband.

My family is in town from D.C., and this has been bookmarked for me for a long time, so I decided to take them here. The concept is fun, and the good is yummy. The problem is that they do not run the AC and to have a burner on the table creates a tough environment to enjoy when there is no AC. It is hot in there, at least it was tonight. The food is good and the concept is fun. We all enjoyed the food, and as far as an all you can eat option, to ou $15/person and get soda and ice cream bars included is a pretty good deal. They have a solid selection of meats and veggies to put in the hot pot and the broths are flavorful. The couple who owns the place are very nice and thorough. I wish they would just run the AC because the excessive heat really took away from what would have been another star or two as far as reviews go, had the heat not been so scorching."}, {"review_id": "9NeB7iO1c1KTySaqak5H4g", "user_id": "zce-enzJcBeSAI2LL70dfg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "I love this place. we were pleasantly surprised by the great food.

It takes a few trips to try out the broth and food options and figure out what you like but once you do you will forever be grateful! It is owned/run by an older Asian couple and usually they are the only workers so you have to be a bit patient if a lot of people start or finish at the same time but it is worth it!!! Now that I know what I like, I always call ahead and they have it ready when I get there. They are very helpful but there is a bit of a language barrier and it isn't your typical dining experience so be prepared to be a bit confused your first few times.
