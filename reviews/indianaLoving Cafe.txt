Get the Thai tea (little ice) and everything else:) I usually get the summer rolls and bbq sandwich (coco) with pistachio mushroom soup. Delicious.

So excited to see a vegan restaurant in Fort Wayne, and the ratings even more exciting. I made the drive to try out Loving Café and was extremely satisfied. The customer service was excellent, the menu vast, and the food excellent. The Potato and Kale Soup was thick and creamy and beyond amazing. The Barbeque was large and tasty, along with the Tropical Smoothie. Based on other reviews I should have gotten a sampler but my two dishes were more than filling so I had to stop eating. This is by far the best vegan restaurant I have encountered...and in Fort Wayne of all places.

I ordered the burrito with a side salad and it was really good. The side salad was made with spring mix instead of just iceberg or romaine and had a variety of veggies in it. The dressing was delicious, like a vegan Caesar dressing. The burrito was very good. The protein strips were like \"steak\" and there was a cheesy eggplant sauce that was so tasty. It was very satiating but didn't make me feel heavy or gross. It did have cucumber in it which threw me off a little, but I actually liked the added crunch. I also got carrot cake to go, the cake part was moist and the frosting was very good, not cream cheese, but still very delicious. Sometimes you can tell when frosting is vegan, it will have a weird aftertaste, but I honestly could not tell. I will come back here while on my trip to try other things!"}, {"review_id": "gXOMfHj1Y5z4ec5fo7gEMA", "user_id": "K5vA58EvuN87CQbuRBCiaw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2017", "text": "Not Vegan? No problem.Loving Cafe is the only vegan restaurant in Fort Wayne...can you believe it? I recently tried Loving Cafe this past week. I was there with a large group and they were very accommodating. You order at the register and then they deliver it to the table. Makes it nice for separate checks and you can take all the time you need to look over the menu. Speaking of the menu. It's huge! I was blown away with all the options. I settled on the portobello sandwich. The sandwich came with a soup - I chose the golden. BTW - it was the best soup I have tried in Fort Wayne. I am not kidding. I tried my boyfriend's potato and kale soup. Amazed at the flavor. If you are too scared to try their \"vegan meat\" at least give their soup a shot! My sandwich was pretty tasty and big. I saved half for my lunch the next day - not necessarily as good as a day old. Their \"meat\" doesn't taste as bad as I was thinking. Go into the menu with an open mind. Don't think it is going to taste like the best turkey, beef, or bacon you've ever had but more like a new flavor.Decor is cute and bright. There is limited outdoor seating. I've heard the place gets packed - especially during lunch so don't forget you can order takeout! Can't wait to explore more of the menu (especially the long list of soups)."}, {"review_id": "uyL8bkvIb1ZShnFaREIK7g", "user_id": "U5PifX727jjA4aA0LIymqg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Took my vegetarian grandsons here and they (and I) loved it. So many choices. My 8 year old grandson asked if we could eat there all week that we're in Fort Wayne. I asked if it was because he wanted to try more things. No, it was because he wanted to order the quesadilla again. The 12 year old tried the Spring Rolls & bowl of Potato/Kale Soup. Both boys ate every bite. I had a fried burrito, and it came with a choice of soup or salad. I had the corn chowder. There were a lot of baked goods on display, but we didn't have any room to try anything else.

But oh my goodness was I surprised! You can find this gem in a small strip mall right off Coldwater road. The interior is nothing special but it is a very cozy atmosphere. You place your order at the counter then they bring out your food. This is a family owned and operated establishment which shows as they take great pride in the food and service they provide. Before ordering I took some time to review the menu, which I must add, has many options! You can choose from soups, sandwiches, desserts, smoothies, the lists goes on and on. Our table ordered a few appetizers to start out with. My favorite was the spring roll. Then I decided to go with the Udon Noodles. I was pleasantly surprised and far from disappointed! Everything was organic, very fresh and made to order. I am looking forward to returning to try something new. The quality of food was fantastic and the service was great! Do be aware they close at 7PM most evenings. They also offer carry out, if you prefer to take it home. Whether you choose to enjoy it at the restaurant or at home you must try Loving Cafe!"}, {"review_id": "hY7SqThnvuiqIP30UMoAeQ", "user_id": "VgsezD08IGMi598TC_DuTQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Love this restaurant!!  Food is always good, and service is always friendly.  Their soups are exceptional."}, {"review_id": "mHR7OseF6tIv3LLv7_1muA", "user_id": "P5Uvz1Ze39y0OQ7XZCgJ0Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2017", "text": "I used to live right across the street from this place and it was my go to spot! Being vegetarian a couple years back limited what you can and cannot eat at a lot of places. Nowadays most places have a separate menu or even a section for vegetarian options but it wasn't that popular at one point in time. I love their summer rolls and buffalo wings. It is a must to start. I have tried all of their soups as well and all of them are very good. My personal favorite is the potato kale. My usual is the orange salad. I am in love with this dish. All of the ingredients go so well together. I am a fan that they have non GMO-soy protein in it as well. Being a vegetarian you really have to eat a lot of beans to get that protein or tofu and after awhile it gets boring. This is a great place to change things up. Another thing that you must try is their raw cheesecake, carrot cake, and oatmeal cookie. Who knew that vegan desserts could be so good! I would come on a daily just to grab an oatmeal cookie. It's that delicious! I highly recommend this place and don't worry it's not just for vegetarians. My boyfriend is a picky eater and he enjoys the steak burger and fries."}, {"review_id": "ovqTxKQ-LSrZRLiTLaPejg", "user_id": "DlZyaxCx8Pxef8-qk4sNiA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "Favorite restaurant in Fort Wayne!

It may be the only vegetarian/vegan restaurant in Fort Wayne. The food is a feast for the eyes as well as the tummy. There were about 12 of us who had only a vague idea of what we were ordering. Everyone seemed to enjoy their selections. Last year we had out-of-town vegetarian guests from California. They loved this unassuming tiny place and the cuisine. I think we could eat here everyday; well maybe every other day. The serving sizes are large enough for leftovers. You may think 'no way' but do yourself a favor. Stop in.

I was excited to try this place because of the rave reviews. When you cook vegan, a world of opportunity in terms of spices and cooking methods is open to you. All of this food was bland. The corn chowder was okay at best with random unmentioned pepper slices that made the bowl taste like one sweet pepper broth. There was no depth whatsoever. The summer rolls were bland, and the lettuce was dirty. The sweet and sour tofu was overwhelming sweet with no contrast. Finally, the only food cooked well was the brown rice.
