I find new things to love every time I eat here.Last night it was a few new-to-me dishes and once again, the service.I really wanted to have my usual, braised pork belly and preserved veg, but my dining companions weren't feeling it. I agreed it was late and that was heavy, so we scanned the menu and picked out salt and pepper calamari, garlic greens (snow pea tips) and a stir fried flounder in black bean sauce.The calamari arrives in short order, only it's greasy and not at all what we're used to here. Our server, Alex, came quickly and brought the dish back to the kitchen and emerged with an owner who apologized and offered us something else. That's simply how good restaurant management is handled. And that's how I found the salt and pepper prawns! Wow. I love the Chinese preparation with the shrimp cleaned and fried with their shell on. The shell gets very crispy and you can eat the entire thing! This one was topped with crispy chopped garlic and scallion, which is the perfect addition to a bowl of steamed rice! These are delicious and I enjoyed them the next day for lunch too! The flounder was lightly coated in potato starch, stir fried with onion and bell pepper, and tossed with a light black bean sauce. Though fried, the dish ate as something lighter, which is what we wanted.Once again, Crawfish hits a home run and I can't wait to get back!"}, {"review_id": "pBzPi93kaNCminXiBbe9zA", "user_id": "M0yMTpoXwQxDUAZMLnbCPw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "No I might have just totally been thinking this was something else but I don't know, let me explain....So I thought it was some kind of a boiling crab experience. So I ordered the crab that comes in some kind of soup. Again maybe it is meant to be this way but it seemed that it was just drowning in grease. Grease can be good don't get me wrong but it just didn't taste all that great. The noodles where kind of ok. I don't know what else to say, it was my birthday and I just wanted to have a tasty meal, but I have noticed that for some reason for my lunch meal on my birthdays I don't have the best of luck. Anyways best of luck to anyone else trying it, again I might not know how this food is supposed to taste and look.I've said this on many of my reviews, I don't believe there is authentic Asian food in this city."}, {"review_id": "lggCihz_el4srM3Z6uy5Qg", "user_id": "4txbq-pOBPGx6r9iPlyPSQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "I am impressed beyond words. The boyfriend and I came across this restaurant on Yelp whole debating on what to eat. Boyfriend wanted some Chinese food and I wanted some crawfish, as always. So we decided on the best of both worlds and thank God we did. The name of the restaurant doesn't do it justice. At a glance, the name of the restaurant makes it sound like a Cajun, seafood type restaurant. But it is actually way more than that. The Chinese food trumps the crawfish and it's just phenomenal. I got 2 lbs of crawfish, one in the combination flavor and one in the Cajun flavor. The combination was the most flavorful but even so, intermediate spice level was not spicy enough for me. The spice scale compared to say, The Boiling Crab is definitely scaled down, so don't be scared. But here at this restaurant, I can honestly go without the crawfish. Now onto the best... The Sweet Sour Fish (Flounder)... with tints of lychee, pineapple, and so many other flavors combined to make a deliciousness hot dish. The fish was perfectly battered and fried so the outside was crispy, layered with the sweet and sour sauce while the inside was soft and moist. It melts in your mouth. The Roast Duck with plum sauce. I'm at lost for words. The skin is so thin, delicate, and crispy. The meat is tender, soft and chewy at the same time. The sauce is like a cherry on top. This meal with fresh hot rice, I will never forget. Service was excellent. Our server was friendly, polite, attentive and all the other staff were lending a helping hand as well. To end a good night, their green tea macaron ice cream sandwich was delicious. Definitely the best, #1 Chinese restaurant I have ever been to. Hidden gem in Reno, it is.

We did not come during Happy Hour, though, instead we hit the restaurant after an afternoon visit to Virginia City. We were hangry! The restaurant was only 5.5 miles from our stay at The Sands Regency.Got here a little after the lunch rush at 1:30p so the place was not very busy. After looking through the menu we decided to have Sizzling Rice Soup [$11.99], Fried Prawns (4 pcs) [$8.59], Salt & Pepper Spare Ribs [$12.99], and BBQ Pork fried rice [$12.99]. The dishes were tasty and delicious! Loved everything we ordered. The fried prawns were huge lightly crisped batter fried until golden brown... one of life's simplest pleasures! It came with homemade sweet sour sauce. Addicting! Not all fried rice are created equal but I loved their fried rice! Plenty of pork and other ingredients! The sizzling rice soup was perfect for the chill weather... yummy comfort food! The restaurant is clean and I liked that inside didn't smell like the kitchen! I don't like coming out of a restaurant smelling like food. The hostess and servers rendered great service! No complaints.

Party of 8 and we all ordered food to share  : garlic noodles, salted fish fried rice, firecracker wings, lamb curry, BBQ pork a.k.a charsiu, braised pork belly & the seafood bowl. We all tried everything, beside the seafood bowl only for 4 ladies included the birthday lady. I hadn't try the garlic noodles until that night & I kinda like it. Kinda strong garlicky. The braised pork belly was a foodgasm. I'll definitely order this one my next visit ( thanks to Alma for ordering this one ). Firecracker wings were very good. The BBQ pork was so tender and tasty. The salted fish fried rice wasn't too fishy at all. For desserts we chose macaron ice cream sandwiches. The service was very good and attentive. The waiter showed us how to eat crawfish. It was a fun night with fun ladies and outstanding food. After seeing Michael's post about congee, I couldn't wait to try so we visited this place and I ordered the congee. For appetizer we ordered the salt & pepper wings. The wings was very good in the outside, very crispy and tasty. The congee did not impress me at all. I had better Chinese congee / porridge than this one. The preserved duck eggs was way too weird and has a fishy taste. Maybe it'd be much better with the salted duck egg. The congee was way too watery. I know the Chinese porridge is more liquidy than my original country's porridge but this one was way too watery. And the taste wasn't great at all. I had to poured soy sauce to make it have a flavor. It was just bland taste, can't taste chicken stock flavor. And it's unusual because commonly Chinese porridge always comes with the Chinese doughnut / Youtiao, but not this one, maybe different style. And it was pretty gingery too, well at least for my taste. Won't order it again in the future. My husband's food was just okay, the mushrooms were pretty good and the tofu was very nice texture, very silky texture. Service was very nice, the lady always refilled our glasses."}, {"review_id": "wYTXhTO6aHngwzB9UGqQRw", "user_id": "hBT8lEP6QHfbFEOADDxN6g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "The calamari was good, however my crawfish was undercooked which made my experience rather poor."}, {"review_id": "4xY8uoGDWeaiDqtEEHBTAg", "user_id": "AcsUdhM915yVvmYk1GkkQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/24/2017", "text": "Ordered take out for dinner.  Friendly and attentive service.  Restaurant was fairly crowded on a Tues night which was a good sign.Ordered 1 lb shrimp with some add-ons, and order of the salt and pepper wings appetizer.Total came about to about $27.Everything was very good and tasty.  After getting down and dirty with the food in my hotel room, it left me satisfied.   They had other things that looked good on the menu, but I would recommend the salt and pepper wings.  They can make it non spicy if you'd like."}, {"review_id": "31OkW_OBoIn8Xp11Xk2eWA", "user_id": "j59adJ7dUI9LS-BKRKYreg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "I'm Chinese. Grew up eating Chinese food. Grew up in the Bay Area where you'll find some of the best Chinese food around. Have eaten at my fair share of Michelin rated restaurants. So I'd like to think I'm a good critique when it comes to food. So when I say that I had the best Spicy Hong Kong Style lobster at a Chinese restaurant somewhere in Reno, I'm sure people look at me like I'm drunk. But it's the truth. And my husband who's as much of a fatty as I am can attest to this same sentiment. We also ordered the orange chicken (I know, so not a Chinese thing to do, but my husband is Filipino) which was super tasty as well. Service was top notch and prices are so reasonable. Only downside is that this place is in Reno and I'd have to drive 4 hours to eat here again. But not a far fetched thing to do as I'm motivated by my stomach. Bottom line: eat here.

For dessert, we had this ice creamy maccaroony type things - sorry, I forget the name, my cough suppressant is kicking in.I loved the mixed food boil, but me, personally, next time, I'm gonna just do shrimp - no need to fill precious belly space with things like CORN - sheesh, priorities, people.I thought the staff were awesome, from me DEMANDING they not sing happy birthday to me, to teaching us how to clean the crawfish (these women have no shame, they kept asking the poor waiter which hole we should suck out), to the owner Ken coming by to say hi.Such a lovely night.

From the moment I tried this place, I absolutely loved it. It's conveniently located off the highway. We've always been seating quickly. The staff is friendly and very attentive. The space isn't huge, but it doesn't feel crowded. And the food is A.MA.ZING.  My absolute favorite is the Ong Choy vegetables. I dream about this vegetable, which says a lot because I'm definitely not the type of person who thought I would dream about a veggie. Unfortunately so do a lot of other people and it often sells out by dinner time, so get there early if you want to try it. Generous portion of the veggies, enough for multiple people.Their shrimp dishes have never disappointed me. Perfectly cooked, so tasty! The garlic noodles are another one of my favorites, and the portion is really large for a side.  Another personal favorite is the grilled squid, which isn't listed on the menu as it is often featured as a special side. Highly recommend it if it's available!The only thing I haven't absolutely loved is the steamed tofu with crab meat. It is VERY crabby. It's a fresh crab taste, like it just walked out of the ocean.  A little overpowering for me. It's almost like a crab and tofu soup as the consistency is kind of thick.Overall one of my favorite restaurants in Reno, I know I can always come here for a great meal!"}, {"review_id": "pVdBCUOvXEoIz64p8i3igQ", "user_id": "ZJLWf9ShKp49raQ3qSfBUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/9/2017", "text": "Tried coming in here a few town and they had been closed but finally made it in.

Fish belly and crab soup: it is so rare to get this soup anywhere when you don't live in cali. I usually have to go home or go to Vietnam to get to eat this soup. They also provide vinegar for the soup. Talking about traditional!!! 2. Egg flower soup- it was just mediocre. Did not stand out to me at all. 3. Crispy pork belly- not the fatty bacon version that American restaurant use. It's actually belly and so yummy. The outside so crispy and make me crave roasted pig ha ha 3. Shrimp with combination sauce- the shrimps was so fresh and what a great deal. $13/lb and it came with decent size. Melt in my mouth freshness4. Salt and pepper wings- I had them as leftover but they still tasted very good. 5. Potstickers- they weren't a big hit for my family because they were really big. However, you can tell that it's homemade so that's a plus for me. We had oolong tea because it was raining outside and it was so good.

The calamari was good, but you can't go wrong with fried calamari and a good dipping sauce. For the bag of seafood, it was bland.
