Really, they are genius for thinking of it because all you really need to balance out the heavy, smoky, oily, savory flavor of the BBQ is some nice cold pickled Korean panchan (side dishes). The pickled radish and pickled green tomatoes were our faves and perfectly complimented the delicious brisket. It was such a refreshing combination. All they need to offer now is some Korean short-grain rice and lettuce. Also, I love how there are so many varieties of sauces--I was a fan of their Traditional and also the Korean."}, {"review_id": "FVobwnYTOY4IxFy6OXP4xA", "user_id": "kFm0PF5Tw_jbOs_qfR_LNA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Looks like I'm late to the party regarding Heirloom but that's cool because it was pure serendipity that brought me here. Nothing better than stumbling upon food opportunities. I stopped in the area to get a bottle of water from the convenience store next door but the pork-laden smoky aroma brought me over.As you read in previous reviews, it's an Asian-American fusion of bbq. It's SRO (standing room only) and I imagine parking could be a challenge during peak times but Uber and carpool everywhere so that a moot point for me.As for the food:I appreciated the Asian twist on the chicken and pulled pork but I honestly I'm not a sauce on my bbq type of guy. I prefer marinating/seasoning the meat to perfection, smoking it and letting the flavor develop from just that alone. Now if you want to slap that Asian goodness in a taco or maybe a bao or even a quesadilla, I'm all for it. The traditional meat choices without the Asian kick were par for the course. My sides were mac & cheez and fries. That mac & cheez is the $#!+! I also gave the Korean Fried Chicken a try. I give it a *muah* and *bravo*! But you can only do that on Wednesdays.Final note, people are always looking for \"The Best BBQ\" in Atlanta. Unfortunately, you won't find an all-inclusive spot. It would be piecemeal depending on the type of bbq you like. Don't expect your bbq fix to be fully satisfied unless you come for something in particular. At Heirloom, I'd say put your money on the brisket + mac & cheez combo. I could be wrong (but I'm not). Otherwise, go on Weds. and get the KFC (Korean Fried Chicken)."}, {"review_id": "ptDRPkQBzuIUWiOC9_soeQ", "user_id": "yaduEZQ3SEqEwm52NXVh6Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "I hate giving negative reviews as I know restauranteurs poor their heart and soul into their establishments, but this was a definite miss.  Super disappointed after reading rave reviews.  I had the spicy Korean pork with slaw.  Pork was tough and bland(underneath the somewhat obnoxious spicy sauce), it reminded me of something I'd get at a buffet - hastily prepared and then doused in spicy sauce to mask its inadequacies.  Not something I would walk across the street for. Also was put off by the staff, I felt like I was an inconvenience by coming in and ordering.My understanding is they had a kitchen fire the night before (I had tried to come the previous evening to find them closed) so I'll give a mulligan, but I think it would be better to remain closed if they weren't ready.  I will give it another shot next time I'm in town and try something different."}, {"review_id": "B12FhOVDyvtAjqWdsR_VFg", "user_id": "5ZeYcagLz5fgCxVvai_wsg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "This is absolutely on of the best fusion Korean smoked bqq places in Georgia!!

Shame on me for never having been here before! I had a craving for BBQ and my normal place was closed. Sad. So I decided to truck it on over to Heirloom.

You definitely can't dine inside.The lady at the counter was friendly, although I don't think she realized I had never been there. Hence why I was asking so many questions. I kind of went overboard with my order but that makes for an authentic experience, right? I ordered the pulled chicken platter ($14) with fries and macaroni & cheese. I wanted slaw on my sandwich so I added slaw, unbeknownst to me that was $4 extra. Yowza. I think it's kimchi coleslaw. I ALSO added the $5 banana pudding because....I had a sweet tooth. Wow, $24 for a bbq dinner. Pretty dang steep. I was disappointed in myself. But not for long. Because when I got home and opened those containers and box, WHEW!! The macaroni was creamy and had a great taste, it almost had a smoky tasty. The fries were crispy and came in a huge portion inside of a bag. I added hotlanta sauce and kitchen sauce to my meal. I poured the hotlanta sauce on my chicken and it was SOOO good. The chicken was tender and grilled so well. I made a sandwich pronto and devoured it. The best thing about it, I had leftovers! Enough for 2 sandwiches. So honestly two people can share the platter. I tried the banana pudding after dinner. It was ok, not the best, it didn't taste homemade. I wouldn't order it again.

The meat had a lot of flavor (even without sauce) and it was juicy and tender , with a perfect ratio to the bun. It made me full; I did think it was a little on the expensive side for a sandwich. However, all in all it was worth it. My sandwich came with a side, and I got the Mac and cheese. This was probably one of the best that I've ever had because it was very cheesy and it had a little bit of a kick to it that made it different from other macaroni and cheeses I've had. 10/10 would recommend. There is a nice selection of sauces (there's even a place in there that has the sauces and little spoons there for you to test taste the sauces), and my favorite was the Korean (sweet heat) sauce. I can't take spicy food very well, but I think this sauce was a perfect balance of spice and sweetness. The meat itself tasted very good without the sauce, but it was a nice addition. Overall, I will be back to this place. I think that it's a pretty perfect fusion of the American style barbecue and Korean flavors.

Or Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart both hosting a TV show. Or rap music and Chinese teenagers. (Reference: youtube.com/watch?v=rILK….) Heirloom BBQ is another example of a blend of two fantastic and delectable worlds colliding: Korean x Southern BBQ. Things to know:*****I. LOCATION & PARKING: Heirloom BBQ is off of Akers Mill Rd located in a tiny shack next connected to a convenience store. It's hard to miss since it often has smoke billowing out of it like a house on fire.They have a small shared parking lot, which could cause concern, but I've never had any problems finding a spot.II. FOOD & DRINK: Regarding their food, I think they're some musts, a few solids, and passes. My recommendations:===MUSTS===*Smoked Wings: Oh, so delicious. The chicken fabulously rips off the bone, and each bite your mouth will experience a smoky, savory, and sexy (S^3) intensity.  This order is worth every penny. ($12)*Mac-N-Cheese: Wonderfully creamy (that's what she said) and satisfying, this stuff will stick to the inner lining of your stomach and make you forget that you, at one point in your life, wanted to have a six-pack. ($3)*Banana Pudding: Thick like a person's booty who does 100 weighted squats a day with correct form, this monstrous dessert will satisfy that sweet tooth while putting you in a diabetes-induced coma. I would eat this with my hands if no would look at me with judgemental stares. ($4)===SOLIDS===*Brisket: Succulent brisket, for whatever reason, is harder to find than spotting Usher at the club in this city. And even though it isn't the best brisket I've ever had, it ranks amongst the top, if not THE top, in the Dirty Dirty. The bark dazzles with a black shimmer. A beautiful pink smoke ring outlines each slice of the slab. And each toothsome bite will give cause you to wear the \"O face\" from Office Space. ($10)*Ribs: Like the brisket, it's not my favorite, but I was pleasantly surprised by their tenderness and flavor. If you like ribs, they're worth a try. ($9)==PASS== *Spicy Korean Pork: Like how my mom used to scold me for not getting straight As, I was disappointed with this dish. Perhaps it was the portion we got, but I just tasted spicy dryness. ($10)*Coleslaw: It's not bad; it's just not worth ordering again. I suppose if you're the type who needs to balance out your meal with something fresh and tangy then go for it! But, by itself, it's standard. ($3)*Collard Greens: Like the cole slaw, I didn't find the collards -- my favorite side -- memorable. ($3)They also have five different sauces, for you to slather your meats. (LOL!) They include the following:- Table: Classic Mild- Kitchen: Spicy Fresh- Hotlanta: Mustardy Hot- Settler: Peppery Vinegar- Korean: Sweet HeatRegarding their drinks, they have sweet and unsweetened teas and coke products.III. SERVICE: Super friendly and fast. They answer any question with any eye rolling and seem happy to help.IV. AMBIENCE & DECOR: It's a tiny shack with standup seating outside. The place is clean, too. V. PRICES: Fair and affordable, for BBQ. I believe you get your money's worth. VI. OVERALL: Heirloom BBQ makes a short list my BBQ Faves in Atlanta. I can't wait to return (and stuff my face with those wings) soon."}, {"review_id": "ZWXfA7lCHBhNI0kXB7XLWQ", "user_id": "S_sjk3VaHAe5cb2tFbquGw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "After thinking about going several times, my mother and I finally decided to give Heirloom Market BBQ a try. I ordered the two meat platter with the spicy Korean BBQ and ribs with a side of onion rings and macaroni and cheese. I must say that I was quite pleased with my meal and it did not disappoint. Plus, the price value was great! The onion rings were my favorite and I stated several times that they were the best I ever had. They were fresh, crisp, and so delicious. Additionally, the sauce it came with gave it extra flavor. I could not decide whether I liked the ribs or Korean BBQ better but I would definitely get both again. My least favorite part was the Mac and cheese. It's not that is was not good, but I like my Mac and cheese to be creamier and cheesier. But overall, it was not bad. The meal itself was enough for two people so I had leftovers for the next day. I also ordered banana pudding to-go. It was also very delicious and had a meringue on top. Now if you go be prepared to find a spot as the parking lot is small. We did not have to wait long but it can get crowded.

I'm a born and bred Texan. I take my BBQ seriously. Full stop.On a recent guys trip to Atlanta, we made it a priority to try at least one 'cue stop (this on the heels of our last over-indulgence in Kansas City). We narrowed it down to Heirloom, old standby Fox Brothers, and up-and-comer B's. Heirloom's proximity to Suntrust Park, its Korean influence hook, plus the Andy Staples seal of approval, made it the ultimate choice.First, its shabby chic gas station adjacency makes KC Joe's look like white linen tablecloth dining. It's truly no-frills, with a small walk-in for counter-ordering and a limited, standing room only patio dining area. Already, I was in love.OK, so first things first. The brisket sucked. That was a disappointment, considering it's held in roughly lofty standards, comparative to the rest of traditional southern barbecue. It wasn't Kansas City levels bad, but save your brisketing for Texas, folks. Beyond the dry beef, everything else was thoroughly excellent.The best thing is the Korean-style pork sandwich, in this case the Kordova with ssamjang, a satisfying blend of east meets west. I half-jest with my smoke-obsessed friend that he just needs to make a sriracha slather or five spice dry rub to uniquely identify his eventual passion project restaurant, but it's honestly the next elevation in the burgeoning world of barbecue. Traditional salt and pepper rubs or thin vinegar sauces are well and good, but worldly flavor profiles and the dreaded fusion label are already here.Next case in point. The smoked wings carry that very traditional wood-infused flavor, but come in a sweet and spicy, Korean bonchon profile. Chicken wings are very much a thing now, and it's not worth wasting your time at your local Buffalo Wild Wings when you can devour interpretations like these instead.Quite unfortunately, the Kalbi marinated beef rib, the latter very much the ultimate interpretation of bigger is better in Texas, was unavailable.Finally, don't discount the sides. Beans, collards, potato salad.

The ribs were juicy, but again not alot of seasoning but this had alot of smoke flavor. For sides we tried the collards which were amazing, tender and the flavor was perfect. Also the bbq beans were perfect and nice chunks of brisket in them. The coleslaw was ok nothing special as well as the mac n cheese, very bland and the noodles were over cooked.
