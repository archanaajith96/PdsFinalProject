The place was packed since it was Saturday at dinner time around 8:15pm.Ambience - romantic, low yellow lights. It was kind of dark in our table but a few areas are still nicely lit. Centro does not have candles or lighting on tables so you will have to rely on their ceiling, chandelier-type lighting. Romantic and slightly upscale.Service/dessert - we had a server named Nick and he was great. He waited on our tables patiently and made great recommendations. Since it was our friend's birthday, he comped his sundae which was big enough to be shared by 5 people. It was topped with melted marshmallow and had some vanilla ice cream, melted chocolate, and some peanuts I think. It was a great dessert! Nick also split our check 4 ways (we didn't let our birthday friend pay of course) evenly and barely explanations needed. He was a great server!Orchid Martini - per recommendation of the bartender at Nick's (waiter) request. It was strong and slightly sweet. I was already feeling tipsy after drinking 1/4 of the drink. Highly recommended drink.Foccacia bread - just this bread alone is enough to make me come back to this place over and over. It was served warm and wrapped with a white table napkin. The bread tasted fresh, and slightly sweet. Great by itself or you can dip it in olive oil and some parmesan. Highly recommended.Appetizer - we got calamari and portobello fries. They were both good. I didn't think the calamari was anything out of the ordinary. It was served hot with a couple of dipping sauces. I think it was lemon aioli and marinara. I liked the lemon aioli better. It was good but I don't think it is something to write much about. The portobello fries was good. I liked it better than the calamari. It was fried so it was crunchy and the dish was accompanied by 2 sauces as well - truffle aioli and chipotle dressing. Both sauces were good. If I will get just 1 appetizer, I would pick the portobello fries. My first words after taking a bite of the dish was \"oh wow'. Both are highly recommended regardless.Main dish - I got the Cobb salad. I thought my salad was good. I do not usually order salads but since my party got 2 appetizers and I got a drink, I figure I should go lighter for my main dish. The salad was huge. See attached photos. There was also a lot of bacon and it was not really bacon bits, as the bacon were on a slightly bigger side about almost an inch per piece. I thought the gorgonzola cheese is what made the dish special. Every bite gives the dish some sort of \"different\" kick. Although I really liked my salad, I had a bite of my friend's Centro salad. And sadly I prefer it over the cobb salad. It had a tasty balsamic vinaigrette and I don't like that dressing usually but Centro's version is really good. Highly recommended salads.Overall, I can't wait to return to Centro."}, {"review_id": "57OC21yVHDth-8Hve6YJyg", "user_id": "5J5T-1PS8LPQZWiu1AlLTQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Centro has a great atmosphere to sit and enjoy your meal.

Centro is a pleasant place to sit, with huge prints on red walls (that I would like for my own apartment), dim lights, and an open kitchen with a blazing fire. It also has a nice patio for the warmer months. The pizza and pasta here are good; the last couple visits, I've had the ricotta gnocchi, which has been flavorful and a good consistency (appropriately puffy). If brussel sprouts are on the menu at any restaurant, I'll usually give them a try, and the garlic aioli here is top notch.Don't leave without trying the marshmallow sundae,  but just get one for the table to share. This is also a good spot to people watch - it is usually a favorite of national political operatives near presidential election years."}, {"review_id": "obVcWneAIq9tjueu1AmDVQ", "user_id": "63piFMwBkCVQEcnSn3RjMg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "The food was delicious and service was great.

The staff is always top notch! They have both indoor and outdoor seating. Also the bar is great and first come first serve! The food is 2nd to none!I love the Tofu Scramble and Tofu Noche as vegan options.. But I also really enjoy the pizza! Get it with no cheese and it's vegan and always amazing!The bread is a highlight too, always warm and delicious, with a little olive oil, which is always on the table! I have probably ate here at least 30-40 times in my life and have never really had a bad experience.. Talk about consistency! I like to take my parents to brunch here, cause I can always snag a good meal and my dad loves the Bloody Mary Bar! Local Beers on tap, great food, great service, perfect for a night on the town or brunch after a night on the town!"}, {"review_id": "W4uv7JXexfh_i4q-nul3KQ", "user_id": "UJeQDMDyyhGUeu1oIpilUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Centro is a long standing DSM staple.

This is an upscale place with great service and an interesting drink and food selection. We had been encouraged to try the portabella fries which were delicious. We went with a couple of the stone fire oven pizzas which had fantastic crusts. I had their special which had pickled onions and some delicious cheeses on it. My wife got the margarita pizza which would be fine if you'd never had one in New York City... but we have. We really enjoyed our dinner there and might try it again when in the area but I don't think the pizzas were worth the price. Certainly good but not quite that good. But there were many other Italian options on their menu to explore."}, {"review_id": "SExTRM7c_Y6YECtkFLCqZQ", "user_id": "JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "Food, drink, service - all 5 stars.  Centro brings the big city quality to downtown Des Moines.  Lunch, dinner, all options are great.  I had the spicy sausage rigatoni with added pepper to really heat it up.  Could have been  spicier, but the dish was as tasty as can be.  Really nice Italian sausage.  The fried brussel sprouts were exceptional as either an appetizer or side and a must order.  The complimentary bread is actually quite good as well and great for dipping.The alcohol menu was a strong suite at Centro.  The draught list was about 10 strong, but they had about 5 high ABV selections, imperial stouts or quads, which I am a huge fan of - props to whoever picks the beer at Centro.  Bottle selection isn't the best, but they have a few nice local Iowa beers like Exile and Toppling Goliath which is always nice to see.  Wine list is large and affordable, as is the cocktail menu.Centro really blew me away.  I would 100% be back for a pizza or nice Italian lunch.  They have a main dining area as well as a quaint bar area with a TV and half a dozen high tops.  Perfect place for a date, a casual drink, or a fantastic meal."}, {"review_id": "SLixYpqJZBufCDeoXvW-2g", "user_id": "mx4hKrYJjuyPX8qUX7plLA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Upscale yet comfortable.

I started with a Knob Creek on the Rocks. They have a great draft beer Porter / Stout selection. I choose the Bell's Brewing Double Cream Stout. An excellent choice. I also had a Victory at Sea which is another excellent selection. I only wish you could get a full pint instead of a half pint.We started with the Centro Onion Rings with Chipotle Ketchup. The Rings are Phenomenal, large rings that are lightly breaded to perfection. Would definitely get them again. I went with the George's Favorite Pizza which is Graziano's Sausage, Roasted Red Pepper, Red Onion, Red Sauce, and Mozzarella. The pizza was perfecto! I loved the wood fire taste! It had a light, thin crust that is excellent. The fabulous red sauce gives just a kiss of flavor to go with the red onion and roasted red pepper. The toppings complimented the Graziano Sausage well. Mama Mia this pie is perfect! Our server was Amber who probably should be showing the other servers how to be an excellent server. Very Knowledgeable about everything Centro, friendly, professional, attentive of the drinks and food(she had several tables). Excellent service. I will be back for pizza!!"}, {"review_id": "dlm1An6ifIUAfzfMzGH-Wg", "user_id": "mRsL_RuE9HaU8iayFcqJBw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "We caught them the night before a complete renovation but you would not have known it from the classic decor and attentive service.

Walking into Centro, that is the first thing that strikes you.I've visited this place a few times and the food is usually very good. This time was no exception. It seems that the quantity is however getting larger. Our table shared the Portobello appetizer and couldn't finish it. My dinner companions could not finish their Chicken Francaise and Pork Chop.

Personally, I like the Italian sausage a bit spicier but the crust was just right. I didn't care for the bruschetta much. Really, I was craving some yummy breadsticks which they don't offer on their menu. They give you a piece of bread and olive oil when you are seated which was really good. Service was alright. Didn't like that the wait staff stands in a line outside the kitchen to watch the patrons. We were sitting right in front of them and felt uncomfortable. Also, I'd like to add that the atmosphere was a bit off. I always feel like restaurants in the heart of cities feel the need to be upscale. My husband and I stayed at a hotel just a block away and thought authentic Italian pizza sounded good. The place was dressed up to be fancy when it didn't need to be. The food should speak for itself.

We never new her name, as an introduction wasn't offered.  We ordered salad and soup. The soup was a very large bowl and nice and hot. The classic Caesar salad was good and perfectly dressed. The timing was good but when our entrees arrived the plates and bowl from our first course were still at the table.  We ordered ricotta gnocchi, shrimp pasta, which had pieces of shrimp not full shrimp and the half chicken which was good. We had to flag down someone to refill waters.  We ordered coffee and dessert, these were good.

Since Centro opened on the main floor of a beautiful renovated masonic temple it's been one of Des Moines finest restaurants, and our favorite.  Self-made chef and restaurant (and grocery store, and bakery) owner George Formaro has combined recipes he's cultivated over many years of travel and study into generous portions of wonderfully fresh and well prepared food. Add the ambiance of a big city restaurant, at a great location, plus an excellent trained staff and it's just a great experience. He does his Italian thing here, although there's a wide variety of salads, steaks and other dishes too, but the focus is a wood fired oven which turns out perfect pizza. He's expanded too offering a french-based spin on cuisine at Django (also in downtown DM), and his big hit Zombie Burger in the east village. Add in South Union bakery (which has a sandwich shop next door), and Gateway Market (a Whole Foods type of place before Whole Foods was cool) and his footprint is deservedly big here.This is a five star place not only for the reasons mentioned already, but because it's relatively inexpensive to eat here.  Recently I had an excellent panini sandwich (with tomato basil soup and hand cut fries), my wife a crab cake salad, plus a couple of drinks for less than $40. You'll pay more at Applebee's for the same meal and believe me, it won't be half as good.  This is a can't miss spot in Des Moines."}, {"review_id": "r46qcqsTjiJFQUN8XYxi3A", "user_id": "saooOqCMJfLMhb09BfMIEg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/27/2016", "text": "Always a consistently good downtown stop, but we were going to the Temple Theater upstairs, so this was an easy choice for dinner before the show. We had a reservation, which is always a good idea here as they are often quite busy. Tonight was no exception - they were full at 6:15 and people kept coming as the night went on.We were promptly seated and even scored a freestanding table (many are closer together lined up against the walls) and got in our drink orders. The bar list is on an electronic tablet, and it includes descriptions of the various wines, which is helpful. My wife got the split of sparkling, which was one she was familiar with,and it was quite good. I got a glass of the hardiest Cabernet,and it was just OK, and $14 a glass for a wine that sells for about $25 a bottle. A bit pricey for what it was, but hey, that's how it goes sometimes. Might have been my taste buds that were off.Dinner was fantastic. I got the grilled chicken and prosciutto pasta, which comes in a Parmesan cream sauce that was just right - creamy without being overpowering, and the pasta was nicely al dente and the dish was not swimming in butter and/or sauce as happens at some restaurants. My wife got a bowl of tomato basil soup and an seasonal appetizer - Cleverly Farm's Italian winter squash-stuffed Cappellacci, brown butter, sage, maple, toasted pistachio and walnut.  It was AMAZING - a great blend of flavors that left both of us (I mooched a little) with a warm, fall feeling. The bowl of soup is family-sized, and she couldn't eat all the soup and appetizer, even though they were her whole meal.Service was very attentive and well-paced, and prices are reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food. Great downtown option."}, {"review_id": "2L_akd7QmcNoKp52COxVmw", "user_id": "QiVO1CAXajUamfYhjimaew", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/16/2017", "text": "When my dining partner wanted to try a good ole DSM establishment for lunch, I suggested Centro due to its popularity, ambiance, and most of the time, consistency. Centro has the big city restaurant feel with the floor to ceiling windows, well known DSM chef, and pretty decent food. We stopped for lunch on a busy  afternoon. Our hostess was not the mostest and couldn't even muster a \"Hello, how are you?\" Her manager had to repeat to her twice where to take us, then after she seated us, she just walked away without the \"Enjoy your lunch\" line that most restaurants train hostesses to do. The server more than made up for the hostess's lack of verbal communication: she was bubbly, energetic and knowledgeable.  I set my sights on the Kill Bill pork sandwich with the tomato bisque. I've read rave reviews on this sandwich and knew I had to try it. When the sandwich came out, I immediately started to drool. Super crispy Niman Ranch pork, pepper jack, bacon , ham and George's famous bread, it was far from amazing. It was just ok due to the fact my sandwich was barely like warm. Unless it's supposed to be served lukewarm, I was a bit disappointed. Nonetheless, I persisted and managed to finish most of it. The tomato bisque was interesting as well. It was rather thick, like oatmeal texture thick. The flavor was great, but I couldn't get past on the texture. I spent over $30 for lunch( sandwich, an $8 craft beer, Coors Light, and tip)  didn't feel it was worth the money. Here I am trying to show my dining partner a great DSM establishment and I felt I kinda failed."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/centro-des-moines?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
