We have been back a few times since my original review, and have tried their pho. They have legit pho!! The broth is a little richer than I'm used to but it's definitely not a bad thing. They serve it with all the right \"fixings\" too. Hibachi is still delicious and we enjoyed having the owner as our chef one night.The atmosphere is simple but welcoming. Wine, beer and sake are on the menu, as well as dessert (which we haven't tried). Definitely our go-to for pho and celebratory hibachi dinners!"}, {"review_id": "lBev3CVmgW8EY29mbyS4PQ", "user_id": "iDbhVDSUqkl_MIh3k62Eqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/18/2017", "text": "I haven't tried the sushi or \"hibachi\" offerings, but the pho is excellent (although I'll ask for an extra dash of fish sauce next time). The friendly and attentive owner was also my server, and his wife is Vietnamese, so they know what they are doing. At lunch, only pho (four options) and a few appetizers are offered, but the pho is what I was after. A pleasant surprise. The owner also said that they would be doing bahn mi in a few weeks on a trial basis, and I am looking forward to it."}, {"review_id": "l5C9IUZ5EcHt6PEaRMo9qw", "user_id": "vEdVAn1vtEZMRMSx3KJ1vg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/10/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We were seated upon arrival.  We enjoyed unagi nigiri, hibachi dinners and fried ice cream with our ohana for my birthday dinner.  Service was excellent and food was delicious.  Thank you for being a part of making my birthday special!  This evening so thankful to meet Amber, another patron, and her daughter."}, {"review_id": "wu7CX_7rWLymlBBulkIMxw", "user_id": "n6EihuO5ZDJJBIkM0cJY4w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/28/2016", "text": "Best pho in Montana!

I've tried them all. Living in Seattle spoiled me, and this is the only good pho in town. I ate some tonight from another place, on 24th near costco, and the beef is horrible.

My wife and I love Japanese food and spotted this spot on the way to school one day. It is small and on the corner of a little shopping strip, easy to miss. I am so glad that we found it though. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by an extremely sweet lady who seated us.This is one of the hibachi type japanese restaurants where everyone sits around the grill and the chef cooks up the food. These are sometimes a little over the top, but the guy working here did a good mix of showmanship and getting the food out quickly to us. They have a nice selection of appetizers, sushi and food to choose from. We were feeling overly fancy and got the samurai special, steak and lobster tail. It is pricey but very worth it. I do like my meat cooked well done, the chef joked that my beef jerky would be right up. It was cooked perfectly. We shared a double crunch roll which I really liked, being a huge sushi fan we always try new things and this is one I would surely eat again. They also offered us some of the house mustard sauce which the chef said would be great for the meat, he was spot on, on this one, it was amazing. Most japanese places I've been too in the southeast give shrimp sauce, this was a pleasant change. With the meal they serve you fried rice which was great, and grilled shrimp for a little treat while you wait. For dessert my wife opted for the green tea ice cream which she just loved. I was too stuffed to consider any for myself, of course I ate most of the sushi. I tend to be a sushi hog if I don't watch myself. This is hands down now my favorite place to eat in Billings. If you are a fan of japanese food or want to give it a try for the first time, give these guys a shot. I can almost guarantee you will not regret it. We will surely be back."}, {"review_id": "RAND-Isde9wkbXdnLxhDjA", "user_id": "PVVHZjS0WPK62UOnwdkbqg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/16/2015", "text": "The Pho here is excellent, and very filling.

The chef was personable, and the food came quickly. However, the steak and shrimp I ordered was pretty bland, and I noticed that the other Hibachi chef used seasonings, and ours did not. The sushi was good, and the Montana roll was unique with the use of beef. I would most likely only go back to try the Pho, but I have had better Hibachi in town."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/samurai-japanese-steak-and-seafood-house-billings?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
