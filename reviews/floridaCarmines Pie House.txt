Split a 10\" Chicago deep dish with a friend (has 4 slices total) and got 1 NY slice to go with it and holy MOLY this pizza was so good. (I only ended up eating 1 slice of deep dish and the 1 NY slice. Took the remaining deepslice home)Deep dish w/ pepperoni: the portions were great, especially for its price. Some places tack on mad bread but this place ain't finna cheat you on that. Mad sauce, mad cheese, mad ronis inside. Hohmygudness. Dat sauce was next level. And even the outercrust had cheese oozing out. Super lit.NY slice w/ cappicola: honestly comparable to a slice from Pizza Time in st. Augustine. Cappicola meat was aite but the slice as a whole legit blew my mind on the first bite. The proportion of crust sauce cheese and meat was a perfect ratio and I literally praise the Lord as I ate that bite. So. Bomb. The interior vibes are kinda weird tbh but i guess some people are into it. They make the pizza fre$h so we waited like 20-25 min for the food to come out. Recommend getting a drink or app to keep you entertained until the main pies come out if you're with a group.Super lit pizza. Will be back to eat more."}, {"review_id": "E6Smh1HKbq66kll5yHFG0A", "user_id": "ksMkMJGntUubMNIwY45LZA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Man this place is fantastic. Whether you're looking a calzone, deep dish Chicago style or just a good old fashion thin slice, this place is worth whatever drive you have to make. I've been here about 5 times now, and each time the quality is has been the same or better. As you walk in you're greeted by the owner, instantly making the place feel welcoming, something they pride them self on. Be warned though, the area is small and you can easily be waiting 30 minutes for a table to open up. However if you're just looking for a quick bite, the bar is almost always free and a slice to go is always an option.So far I've had their calzone, calamari, and a number of their pizzas. My recommendation would be the pope of Greenwich, a pesto base pizza with basil and an array of cheeses.If you're looking for the best bang for your buck, the calzones are where you want to be looking at. For 9 dollars it's fast track to a food coma, or atleast leftovers for your next two meals. Add some cheap beer and your night is set."}, {"review_id": "UOzdQ9VM4LAVne1WtSRTPw", "user_id": "nJ98L406n88sh1YZp6Sq_w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "This place has been our local go-to 'Za joint in the neighborhood!!  Damn good pies!!  Consistently hot & fresh ingredients.   We've sampled things as we've ordered to-go but stopped in last Sunday for a sit-down meal.   The interior is quite unique ... a must-see visit is the only way you'll understand it.  The menu is plentiful & challenging as they have such a wide variety of choices.  Phineas was our server & what a great dude - prompt, friendly & has a watchful eye for the table but not hovering!   We started w/ an order of fried Mozzarella stix ... let me just say these are NOT frozen.  They cut some slabs of mozza then bread & deep fry these things - served w/ some homemade marinara sauce!  Our table had a huge slice of cheese Za, a B-52 Bomber & the \"Bird-in-da-bread\" Chicken Parm sandwich ... and added 1 order of fries!  Everything is a LARGE serving.  We ate 1/2 our sandwiches & all the freshly made French Fries ...

We were a table of 5, a friend and I shared a Chicago deep dish with meatballs, green olives, and bacon, one slice is plenty to leave you satisfied! My other pals orders pasta dishes, and one is basically on a keto diet and ordered a salad. Regardless of your preferences there is definitely something here for everyone.One of my favorite things about this dive pizza house is that all of their beers are served in pint glasses, something to note because it feels like there is a lot of value in ordering a double IPA that is so commonly served in a 10ounce pour, for about the same price elsewhere. Our server was fantastic, and I also appreciated the manager doing his rounding on the table, the vibe at this place is mellow, and its just simply enjoyable. I will definitely return for more!"}, {"review_id": "sszQc6TJa_e5G8Mw9hX7rg", "user_id": "W5zxMffW2rVQT3e54RuY1w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "First time here and totally love  The Pope of Greenwich Village pizza.  The flavor was so good!  The staff was very accommodating.  We had to rush out to get home after receiving a phone call and they took care of us right away to get us checked out and food ready for the road.  Can't wait to go back to try many other items on the menu and sit and enjoy it without having to rush out."}, {"review_id": "sWX0U8wCmEQIkupPoJ2knQ", "user_id": "eJcmMnqfpcCG42abVpcjxg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Eh.. they the pizza doesn't have any real flavor or art, it's just mounds of sauce and cheese that melts together in a plate full of lard.

For a busy Friday night, these guys were tuned like a well-oiled machine. As soon as we stepped inside, an owner or manager was there to greet us and find us a table. You can tell they care about the customer experience. Our server was knowledgeable, prompt, and funny as hell. She definitely upped the ante on our visit.Food...talk about the food!To start, we ordered Zucchini Fries and Cheesy Garlic Bread. The former were some of the best I've had. Honestly, they rivaled regular fries. The batter was absolutely perfect. The latter was very good, not necessarily a must order though.Onto the 'za. I was skeptical when reading the menu because it said a 10\" deep dish specialty pie would feed 2-3 people. Boy, was I wrong. It might be difficult to tell from my photos, but this pie was a behemoth work of art. Isabella Rosallini - Rosetta Sauce, Bacon, Garlic, Tomatoes, Basil, & Mozzarella. Oh. My. God. This is one of my new favorite pies in all of Jacksonville. There, I said it! The rosetta sauce was prepared by angels themselves. Almost too delicious that you want to savor every last bit. Almost.I couldn't be more impressed with Carmines, and I'm really banking on becoming a regular here. Also, I love the eclectic decor, which reminds me of Lola's down the street. Time to plan my next visit!"}, {"review_id": "OEwlikAo5ejdRlNE_HV72w", "user_id": "9dVBIyt--axJu4YedVnybA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/7/2017", "text": "Had to write a review after our define great experience here :)This is a place for love and delicious food haha we ended up coming here on a whim and turned out to have the same amazing waitress we had on our first date! Val is now part of our adventure----always delivering deliciousness with a smile, patience (we took forever to order once) and a sense of humor hahaWhen you walk into Carmine's, you are transported into a world that looks like a dive bar but smells like fresh pizza. You'll find everyone here:  Families, couples, groups of friends, vegetarians, Yelpers, business types, artists, that one person who reads at their table alone......all in one room having in common a love for Carmine's cuisine.  The menu is pretty extensive, but each time I haven't had a bad dish. The Train Wreck pizza was perfect, but there is a different pizza for every taste---or you can make your own!The calzones are huge and full of goodness, customizable with yummy things to fill them with. My only critique is the \"fresh garlic\" option: As a huge fan of garlic, I do not like that they used the pre-chopped garlic from a jar.... I could totally tell and didn't enjoy it! I was expecting cloves of fresh garlic either squashed/shredded and mixed within the ricotta... Even if I got big cloves of garlic in a bite,  that would have been better but that may be an acquired taste, maybe people don't generally like their garlic as fresh as I do lol Otherwise, delicious! Everyone is friendly and laid back.
