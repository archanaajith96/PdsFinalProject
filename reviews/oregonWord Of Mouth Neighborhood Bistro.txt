Of course when there is a really good gem in the City of Salem, there will always be a line out the door. Let me tell you, good things really come to those who wait. Anything on their breakfast menu is a winner for me. Be sure to ask if you could sample their French Toast Creme Brulee, you will thank me. You might feel a little guilty afterwards, but it is absolutely delectable.I have invited some family there for breakfast, and my mother went back for 2 more consecutive weekends. Great customer service for a busy bistro. Make note, after church hours on Sunday's are usually very busy. However, it would be worth the wait!"}, {"review_id": "x3Ste-UiZRXoW-yoSNxHSw", "user_id": "Aj6qSk6t8E3JVDJ7QxMTAQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "If you are in the Salem area, this place is a must! The waiter gave us some recommendations and they were amazing. The bacon was to die for! We went on a Thursday, and only waited about 15 minutes for a table. Although it was a week day, it seemed pretty busy if you had a large party. The staff were awesome and super friendly. That's always a make or break it point for me. I really enjoyed looking around at the quirky decor.. I mean who doesn't love pictures of dogs everywhere! It's a super unique place that I will be coming to again!"}, {"review_id": "EP0_NkXuBFoaJcRk5Ym6wQ", "user_id": "yjURK15O5YN8bvxyEzgIhQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "This is a must if you are in Portland.  It is located in Salem Oregon 45 minutes to an hour drive from Portland.  Let me tell you it was worth the drive!!!!  Since never eating at Word of Mouth asked what they would recommend.  The one that everyone said was the Plate of Love.  When we sat down our server mentioned the Cinnamon Roll Pancake.....Whaaaat.  So we decided to get the  Cinnamon Roll Pancake as an appetizer.  It was worth every single calorie that went into my body.  Then ordered that Plate of Love.  It was a Creme Brûlée Vanilla Custard  French Toast with two eggs and get this, not a misprint Filet Mignon Hash!!!  Decided to wash all down with a cup of Joe.It was by far on of the best breakfast in any restaurant within the USA!!!!The service and employees were awesomeMy complements to the owner on a well deserved name and an awesome menu and great staffI do not live in Portland, but when traveling to Portland it will become a must for me.Chao"}, {"review_id": "uH6PzSdh-lAeEHf-HyQBxg", "user_id": "xMRxrczHZEZEIBNJUX488g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "It's always nice coming here. Staff is super friendly. Food is amazing, and if you go on a Thursday for brunch you don't have to wait hours lol (well at least for my boyfriend and I haha) we ordered our food and quickly after we ordered we received a delicious treat on the house! Jicama slaw tostada with House made refried beans OMG delish!! Axel got the bacon cheddar avocado omelette with a home made biscuit and Yukon potatoes yum!! He also ordered a delicious! Amazing Spanish coffee! And later ordered a Salem mimosa. I ordered black coffee which was very tasty, Plate O Love with the filet mignon hash! Sooooo good! Super awesome costumer service here! And we only waited 10minutes to be seated! It has probably been at least 2+ years since I've been here, and I'm still in love with the food and the service!

About an hour later they texted us and we walked right on in! Starting off with the mimosa, definitely a lot of champagne! (Which is always a great thing!;) they then presented us with a giant cinnamon roll pancake, on the house! So sweet and pretty darn filling! (We split it between 4 people) I had ordered the eggs benedict which were very good! NOT GREAT but I was Pleased:) I'm comparing them to other eggs Benedict I've had before where they load them with plenty of different things on top but i received a pretty plain eggs Benedict on a bed of spinach I believe. The hollandaise sauce really made the dish. The potatoes that came with the plate could have also been a hell of a lot better but even those were plain. I guess I'm just use to very elaborate plates with plenty of ingredients but make no mistake, my tummy was very happy after the meal!"}, {"review_id": "zp5IEKqSXwVzKyc9s7XJJw", "user_id": "y5b8e-82pITyu4dJV8Eitw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "Oh my goodness.

My friend who lives up here in Oregon brought us here because we wanted an amazing breakfast, and that's exactly what we received. As expected (as we were told), the wait would be long... and it was. It was about an hour and 30 minutes, but they have a texting system in which they can notify you when your table is ready. We had plenty of time to kill, so we walked back into Salem where the Hooplah basketball tourney was going on (my friend participated in it), did some shopping at the local mall, and then returned in time for our table. EVERYONE here was SOOOO freakin' nice and friendly. We definitely commented on it several times, and made them aware that this kind of hospitality is truly hard to come by back home in LA. We really appreciated their efforts in making us feel welcome and since they knew 2 of us were visiting for the first time, they even brought us a complimentary pre meal dessert with white chocolate oozing off of a biscuit-type breading cake. Was delicious and so cool of them to give to us. The whole time, and with every server or staff that came by, we were always having a nice convo and I truly felt that I had one of the best breakfast experiences ever here. As for the food, our meals were extremely good! Although, it is probably not THE best I have ever had in my life, it is definitely up there in the top places I have been to. Aside from the food, experience, ambience, and other things obviously all play a factor, so I feel like this place does everything perfectly all around the board. I ordered a bacon, cheese, and avocado omelette which came out tasting just amazing, especially since they bacon they use is so thick and juicy. Take a look at the photo of my friend's HUGE breakfast sandwich... the bacon flyin' outta the sandwich is so mouth-watering! Again, I really appreciate the generosity and friendliness displayed by the staff here, and would return to this establishment in a heartbeat if I ever find myself back in Salem... or Oregon for that matter! Y'all were truly insanely nice people. Thank you again!"}, {"review_id": "sHkqnAe7-iy8h484CQGqMQ", "user_id": "r3DpIMfxF-wqarGWFC6YqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/28/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This place takes your name and phone number and utilizes an online wait list so you can go do other things while you wait like driving around town playing Pokémon GO!  WOW! - The atmosphere is intimate and cute. Quirky with a side of inspiration and savory delectable menu selections! The fresh fruit cups are exceptionally fresh and fruitful. I feel required to order the fresh fruit cup as a side just to feel like a kid in a candy store eating it. :DIf you love hot chocolate, you are in for the most amazing experience involving a spattering of colorful sprinkles and a tower of whip cream! Simply divine and playful. Compare whip cream mustaches with your date! The servers know their menu so well they don't even have to write down your order. I have yet to see them not smiling! If you ask a server they will gladly help you find what you may like on the menu and give you a tidbit of history of how the wonderful Word Of Mouth \"house food\" came about. Think comfort food without the regret. You will leave feeling satisfied and fresh. That is unless you order the cinnamon roll pancake! HahaThe staff is very sweet and friendly and if you get a chance to sit up stairs, it's a wonderful quiet atmosphere and they give you a taller water glass!This place is of the best in Oregon for breakfast food!

Yes, this places has a wait, but it's for a good reason: the food is great with generous portions, and the restaurant is in a cute house. They do what they can! It's owned by a family, and they won't ever make the restaurant bigger because of the style and environment the location provides. Pro tip: get their early (or earlier than you want to eat) and put your name down. Then come back around your estimated wait time and check back in. Even if they skipped you you'll be next for a table!Also, order to go. They can do everything to go, and you don't have to wait for your food. My recommendation: the cinnamon rolls pancakes, the creme brûlée French toast, hot chocolate (see yelp pictures) or the plate of love.

(We went next door to this small antique shop and the owner is sweet but that's another review).Thirdly,  1.5 hour wait turned into only a half hour wait. Got to love that!!!Now on to the most important - yea that would be the food.  I got the vegetarian benedict with their amazing fresh potatoes.  Divine ok? Eggs perfect too. Muffin was scrumptious. Not sure, but maybe it's homemade? I know their bread is.The restaurant is in an old house with lots of cubby holes full of people eating at their tables. We went up some stairs and were in this cute little room that had 3 small tables.  Also, the women's bathroom is the coolest place to hang out in. It's full of vintage mirrors and frames and hanging lamps. Finally, the customer service was amazing.  I was suspicious though. They were so wonderful I can't imagine they are not family to the owners.
