The slices came out piping hot, cheese were gooey, and tons of pepperoni. It was damn good. This is as close as you can get to a NY style pizza and being in California. Verdict: Definitely worth recommending to someone. The only place that, in my opinion would rival this place, is Colosseum New York Pizza. BUT, there are very subtle differences between the two. If you're a dough person, A Slice of New York has better dough. If you're a sauce person, Colosseum New York Pizza has better sauce.  You can't go wrong with either or, but definitely a place I would revisit regularly."}, {"review_id": "4jokEMDFmLINmunNVEIP8w", "user_id": "PiV7fiSeS9Au4WH_pGISrQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "The Pizza: If you're looking for delicious New York style pizza in the Bay Area, look no further. I have yet to find a place that competes with delicious combination of high quality ingredients and perfectly thin crust of these pizzas. (5/5)The service: Professional staff. They get the job done, but at peak dinner hours, expect to wait about an hour for your take out order (large pizza, duh)(4.5/5)Minor Complaints:Three times I've ordered pizzas, waited an hour for the prep, and come by to see that a mistake has been made in the order. Gotta fix this.(4/5)Over all, great place. I recommend it to friends regularly. :)"}, {"review_id": "X-RffWLPY4cCrM_EkPiGBg", "user_id": "WDAqa-sz-M2iHXKofUUCkg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "THE GOOD: The pizza is New York style, obviously, which is my personal favorite. They offer pizza by the slice, which is cool if you want to stop by for lunch and grab a bite. I have never gotten a full pizza here, but the slices are pretty good, so I would imagine the full pizza would taste even better. The ingredients are fresh and the slices are decent sized. They have a slice and drink combo if you come in the middle of the day. I don't remember exactly what it is, but I think it's a free soda if you buy two slices around lunch time. They are also open pretty late most days. I think they are open till midnight on weekdays and till later on weekends. THE BAD: I am not a big fan of the customer service. It's not that they are necessarily mean or anything, but they seem stuck up or full of themselves. For example, they have a \"wall of shame\" of some sort, and its understandable why some people are on there, like they stole a bottle of hot sauce or something. However, some people are on there for writing a bad Yelp review, which seems ridiculous to me. If you show up on the wall of shame you wont get any service. There is also some Hispanic guy that is somewhat creepy. At first, I thought he had a staring problem because he thought my girlfriend was attractive, but I returned alone and I guess he just likes to stair. I am not calling him out because he's Hispanic or anything, since I am Mexican myself. He's just the only none Caucasian working there, so its an easy identifier.I am also not a huge fan of the location. They are next to a salvation army store and a some kind of bar, so the crowd there can be weird if you come late at night. The location itself is also pretty small, so plan on taking your pizza to-go. BOTTOM LINE: The pizza is really good, so I would recommend trying it out, but the customer service isn't necessarily all there at times."}, {"review_id": "NaklFzA2oE9frtFseKSIAA", "user_id": "nC4x02Sv0YYT9CV0UcMSxw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "From all tithe good reviews here I expected way more. It was a big Disappointment tonight when I came here. I ordered the Stromboli and a slice of pepperoni pizza. The pizza is just ok nothing special , I like my thin crust  pizza a little more Crispy when you bite into it and not soft like the crust on the pizza here. The Stromboli looked good but there just OK, the Stromboli's off Monterey Road across from the Capitol Drive in  are 2 times better. I'm just glad I got to try this place out cause I drive by here a lot and always want to know how the food is here. Don't think I'll be back here again.

It took them about 2 mins to reheat the slices and they came out piping hot so be careful.  The slices look large but the nice thin crust made it less filling.  The margherita was amazing. The basil cheese tomato sauce and garlic was a perfect blend. The pepperoni mushroom was also very good. The this crust was crispy on the bottom just the way I like it.The service was excellent and the decor was typical of some NY pizzerias I have visited.  Cool and eclectic.  Parking and seating can be an issue but I am glad it is 5 mins from my home.  I will be back for sure."}, {"review_id": "nLESj4uAT6IGWAwtwY4eSQ", "user_id": "QiuDuofllCP_JMc5jFM-Rg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/19/2018", "text": "We've been so enticed  by the near perfect ratings of ASONY, decided to give it a try a few days ago and had high expectations.The place is easy to miss, parking can be a little challenging too. We can smell the warm aroma of fresh yeast dough, cheese and garlic before entering. The place is small and cozy, only a few seats available, most people just do take outs. People are very nice and friendly, I like the fact it's owned by employees.We picked two slices each of the margarita, and one with bacon plus 6 garlic knots. Everything was reheated before boxed, we walked out with a lot of food for $26.After arrived home 20 minutes later, we couldn't wait to try them with  beer already chilled in the fridge; we were somewhat disappointed that the pizza didn't have the crispness and were still limp even after being toasted again. The garlic knots after re-toasting were crispy and yummy. Perhaps we didn't pick the right pizza; we'll probably go back some other time but unfortunately we didn't have a 'wowed' first experience."}, {"review_id": "3RzZTMsih0wY-0AYewhNYA", "user_id": "2vOPQU1tisd_UtUB69EbMA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Tried this place out last night and it was amazing!

I'm starting off with that, because it's true. I went this past July to New York, tried several spots including Bleecker St Pizza, Joes, street vendors, other random spots in NY. But nothing wow'd me like here. Their crust was thin, crispy and dry on the bottom, and perfect layer of cheese on the top, and topped with delicious thinly sliced toppings. I had their buffalo chicken, pepperoni, cheese, jalapeno pepperoni, etc. It was all good. You get a giant slice, they reheat it in the often for a few minutes and voila, you get yourself a traditional New York style pizza. It's delicious. I want more! Please open a few locations in Seattle,  we need pizza like this readily available! Besides the delicious pizza, the staff was super sweet and helpful. It was easy to find and walking in, you feel like you're in New York. The walls are covered in New York style signs, art work, etc. It's definitely like walking into New York!

Though thin, the crust was missing some crisp. next time I stop by, ill ask them to leave it in the oven a little longer for that pleasant crunch."}, {"review_id": "1Z75P1u2cjykSP-R8AflqA", "user_id": "0VYzR15p6G18-2_KCsvuEw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/11/2017", "text": "Get the margherita pizza.There are not many veggie options, so margherita was the obvious choice for me. It's HUGE and on the thinner side...but so delicious especially because mine came right out of the oven. There was only one other veggie option on display when we got there for dinner, so margherita just sounded more appetizing, especially since it was fresh too. Boo got the Sicialian which is the square-shaped pizza with sausage and other meat. He said that he preferred my margherita...so jury's out!The pricing is a bit on the higher end for pizza, even in San Jose. Our slices were $4-$6! That's crazy expensive for pizza. BUT this pizza is totally delicious and always a good choice. You won't be disappointed with the quality and slice sizes. We sat outside at the few small tables because inside is basically standing space. Most customers I noticed bought full pizzas to go, which sounds bougie but delicious. I grew up eating Papa John's when it was pizza night at home. They serve soft drinks and even have some small dessert options if your sweet tooth comes out to play. It's a great place to get some nice quality pizza once in a while, but this isn't my \"local haunt\" or else it'd break my cheesy bank! There is no restroom that I know of, and no wifi. They do have chili flakes and extra parma cheese on the side if you'd like to do more toppings. Great chill space if you're looking for a quick bite that isn't a full sit down meal like other restaurants nearby."}, {"review_id": "SrBGPcXXXthF8pkUGRULcg", "user_id": "dAkUZDgs0vKkNxCN_lH4lQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Was here for lunch today.
