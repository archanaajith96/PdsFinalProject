Amelie is a very cute and interesting place. With so many pastries to go and a few gluten free options, which makes me happy. The fact that they stay open 24/7 is great. They offer gluten free bread for breakfast sandwiches, so obviously I went with that. The bread was buttery and held it's own very well. On the sandwich I ordered egg, bacon, cheddar, spinach and tomatoes. Everything was good until I realized they forgot my bacon, by then we were on the road already. My husband had a croissant which he thought was perfect. Coffee was delicious and we took some pastries to go, including the famous gluten free salted caramel brownie."}, {"review_id": "rTWJEMOJlJGmnUcLcjhirg", "user_id": "EaRd_4nFnPs8Fei-H2ZmVA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "What to get: pastries, salted caramel mochaService: 4/5Atmosphere: cafe, study or meet up spotWait: 10 mins (Saturday 8PM for 1)Parking: shared parking lotThe Experience:It was around the end of my solo trip and though it's easy to secure a spot most places for one, Charlotte on a Saturday night gets crowded no matter where you go. At least all the well-known places do. So tired of potentially waiting for 30+ mins for even a spot at a bar, I headed over to Amelie's to have dessert for dinner.This particular location is in a strip mall with multiple businesses, so it's a large, shared parking lot.Biggest perk is that this place is open 24 hrs. Therefore, I can see it as a great place for studying late nights or getting together to meet up and chat with friends. To order, you'll likely line up by the counter, but it moves constantly.A lot of their pastries looked great. I tried a fruit tart and multiple flavors of macarons. The flavors of macarons weren't posted, so I just picked based on color. The cookies are actually pretty fluffy and moist, even after a day or so. The tart was fine, but nothing particularly special.Their salted caramel mocha latte(?) was actually the highlight for me. I'm always up for anything different they have on their coffee drinks menu and this one was well balanced. Mellow and slightly sweet, which made it easy to have with or without any treats to along with it.Pretty cute spot and a nice haven to get away from the crowds at dinner time."}, {"review_id": "Qimi_QJ6vZVXQeiTKVsCfg", "user_id": "WFKODeGrrISSTbzBYGxgrQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "What a beautiful gem right outside of downtown Charlotte. Located in a little business park, it doesn't look like much from the outside, but as soon as you walk through the front doors, you're welcomed by the smell of fresh baked French pastries and surrounded by quaint French decor. It's always busy, but that just speaks of the quality of everything Amélie's produces. I love their French macarons and mini tarts. I got an assortment of the macarons and a mini dark chocolate raspberry tart. All of it was utterly delightful! My mom had a strawberry, vanilla mousse cake (I can't remember the actual name of it) and it was melt-in-your-mouth perfection!The staff has always been friendly and the line can get a little lengthy, but come and relax. Enjoy the ambiance, French pastries and a cup of tea or coffee."}, {"review_id": "oKoInEsD5rCdSnc4yJHZVQ", "user_id": "QGOtNZfasBwWCuawKjypYA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Amelie's is a Charlotte staple. You can't find better pastries. The original Amelie's is my favorite. The rest don't quite measure up. The Petit Fours are over of my favorite things to get. They also have great macaroons and seasonal cakes. Their fruit tarts are good and let's be honest, is there anything that isn't? The salted caramel brownie is the most popular thing, but I don't like chocolate, so I can't speak for it. I also love coming here for a sandwich at lunch or for brunch. The seeded roast beef and Croque Monsieur are my favorite sandwiches. Their soups are also very good.  The eclectic decor also can't be missed. The downside of this location is that there isn't a ton of seating for the number of people that come to work at a table by themselves.

I've also have had their sandwiches and yummy drinks! The service is usually friendly as they try to assist you and yet move you along. I went last night and was slightly disappointed. I ordered a couple of items, including the bread pudding which i was told takes 13 minutes, which i get every time so that was no issue. I also ordered a key lime pie which was perfect! Also a chocolate croissant ,which i usually Love, was a lot less chocolate than usual and in my opinion was toasted too long. We started eating the pie and croissant as we waited for the bread pudding. 20 minutes go by and nothing. My husband went to the counter and asked about it and was told that it is on its way. 25 more minutes go by and finally it arrived. I don't know if they forgot about it or what but 45 minutes for a little thing of bread pudding was ridiculous! Luckily it was delicious but not worth the wait!"}, {"review_id": "OzwvIgyoCEfoHTBjY6wIJA", "user_id": "QMv3G0xwD4u4me0_nWXTng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "The cutest bakery I've been to!

The thing that sticks out to me most when I think about this place is quality. They truly put their passion behind their products to make the highest quality french pastries, cookies, pies and other confections. My favorite thing to do is to pop in and just buy one tiny treat for myself when I've hit a big goal or really need a little pick-me-up. Because the desserts are so well made, I know that every calorie is worth it. They also have coffee and tea and delicious made to order sandwiches and salads. As with the baked goods, these are also crafted with care with high quality ingredients. I have to stop writing this review now because just thinking about this place is making my mouth water and I don't want to drool all over my keyboard.

Where else are you going to go to get a chocolate croissant at 2:30 in the morning? Wait, why do you want a croissant at that hour? None of my business, it's yours if you're in NoDa!Located at the corner of 28th and N. Davidson, Amelie's is everything you've ever wanted in a corner side cafe. They make premium coffee, tea, and desserts as well as many lunch offerings. My hands down favorite for lunch is the Chicken Salad croissant: chunky texture, very little filler (just for binding), buttery flaky pastry, excuse me for a moment I need to take a drive back there now!How about sweets? Mixed berry Macaron is a crowd-pleaser. Be sure to ask the counter staff about all of the macarons on display. The Salted Caramel Layered Torte is great, as long as I didn't have something too filling to eat before because this thing is as rich as it comes. If you're familiar with the Salted Caramel Brownie, add laters of mousse in between with more chocolate. WOWMad respect where it is due, with this being the original location, but I'm a much more frequent patron of the uptown location. Not due to proximity, because I'm much, much closer to the NoDa site, but because of the typical crowdedness of the place. Forget about sitting anywhere near the service counter unless you want to be brushed up against by dozens of people you don't know! Even the back is iffy sometimes if they're really busy as the line can easily back up 50-60 deep. They're doing the best they can, trust me, it's just a really busy spot. Don't even think about going here after a N. Charlotte event or a NBA game, you're doomed. When it comes to crowd control, they're a victim of their tremendous success.Yes, logic would have you believe that the Uptown location would be busier, but it's almost always the exact opposite. Still, sometimes I'll pick a time I know it won't be too bad (think very, very early on a weekday, like 5am) just to enjoy the ambiance this location offers, knowing that I'm sitting in the middle of Charlotte history, and wondering where they'll pop up next (please be University, Mallard Creek even better!).To all the people who thought a 24/7 bakery in the middle of NoDa would close down within 3 months, look at them now. Break bread with your neighbors and join in the pride of watching this great QC brand continue to grow and wow you with enticing treats!"}, {"review_id": "Tzvwvjiothaz2Of6LnQg3A", "user_id": "N9hqTPQu2bmI8c2Pj8F1ww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/30/2017", "text": "Why does Charlotte love Amélie'? because...obviously..1) This one is around the clock 24/7.2) The roast beef on a croissant is over-the-top.3) Everyone raves about the salted caramel brownie.

Of course, the desserts and other edibles and drinks are always a delight and the vast arrangement is extremely pleasing to the eye and will make you want to buy more desserts than your body could take. The macarons are always a classic and I have bought tons for a party before and they are definitely a crowd pleaser! The salted caramel brownie is a classic favorite and one of my new favorites. The tarts are amazing and the espresso cake has the perfect dash of coffee. They also make cakes when you need one for a big event and the prices aren't too bad!

After a long night clubbing and eating too much cheese at the cheese and wine party, you tend to want something sweet at 4 in the morning. As big as Charlotte is, you'd think there'd be more 24/7 places. Amélie's has always been a staple delivering fresh handmade pastries, my favorites being the chocolate hazelnut tart and the salted caramel brownie. The workers are always helpful and don't mind telling you what things are. And after seeing the lines wrapped around the building, they still greet you with a smile. The only thing I hate is the parking, although it looks ample, you may be looping around a few times till someone leaves.
