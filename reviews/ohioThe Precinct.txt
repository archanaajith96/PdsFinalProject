If any aspect of your visit isn't amazing, please let someone know promptly. They will make it better than right. You are paying for that special experience, allow them to make it that. Anyway, my wife and I stopped in this evening, around 515pm. We had some over cooked Mac n Cheese for our app. Let our bartender know right away, and the Sous Chef checked the product for himself, and agreed and remade the entire batch of Mac for us and a few others, that was personally delivered to us by the GM. Bawe  Shinholster, Corporate Director of Quality Assurance, even stopped over to check on us, and say hi, without being aware of the MAC issue. Thanks for the hospitality to the entire staff at The Precinct. We thoroughly enjoy our date nights with you!Todd & Jeri F."}, {"review_id": "sHE-hlqeN3plDdo48_7Dkg", "user_id": "oQdPW2CJdcin4-mHxyNPiQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "I'm 49 years old. I travel and eat in fine restaurants all over; I have for many years. The meal I had last night at the Precinct was one of the best I've ever had. The service I got from my waiter Donnie and his assistant was world class.After a long week of travel, I picked the Precinct last minute for an impromptu celebration dinner with a colleague after a successful week of meetings. We were both blown away with the experience from arrival, through cocktails and on thru every course. Great oysters and scallops, signature salads, and out of this world dry aged bone in filets 3\" thick, cooked perfectly.At one point during the meal I managed to spill a full glass of red wine on the white table cloth. Our waiters reset the table in no time and brought replacement wine and a \"so sorry\" glass of Stags Leap to apologize for my self-inflicted misfortune. :-0What an amazing experience. I'll be back any time I'm near Cincinnati.Thank you, Donnie and the whole Precinct crew. I'll remember that dinner always."}, {"review_id": "vgCjfXisjRmVqzbmuczDwQ", "user_id": "G-SPQORkO9GfFh7GjiifQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "There's is no other rating you could possibly give The Precinct other then 5 stars. They're the epitome of 5 stars. It makes me question all the other 5 stars I've ever given out before them.. yes they are that good. I took my husband to The Precinct for his birthday. He loves steak and I wanted to get him the perfect steak for his birthday. I've heard so many people rave about The Precinct I knew this is where we had to go!I made reservations, we were promptly seated when we arrived. The decor is cool. It was an old police station originally, so they have some pieces that reflect that, as well as exposed brick and really elaborate stained glass windows. I will say the tables are a little snug together so you can hear the people next to you, however it wasn't too distracting. Although unfortunately for us, we did have a table of about 6-7 next to us, that had quite a bit to drink so was getting a bit obnoxious and crude towards the end, which was a bummer, but certainly not enough to take away from our experience, or play any part in deterring us from coming back. Our waiter was Chris who was phenomenal! As well as his assistant (I think that's what you would call them?) Linus. They both were so thorough, gave suggestions, and described things in detail. They were always paying attention to us, guessing our needs before we would need anything, always clearing the plates right away and refilling drinks. If you've read my reviews before you know my top concern is service. And this was the absolute BEST SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!! Incredible!The food was outstanding as well. My husband started with oysters and shrimp. I'm not a big fan of either so I didn't indulge, but he said they were fantastic. Another pretty cool thing about The Precinct that differs from other steak places, as well as the other Jeff Ruby locations, is that you get a salad and side included in your meal! No adding anything on for an additional price. We both ordered the Freddie Salad, delicious! I also got the Jeff Ruby Burger with fries, and mac and cheese (which apparently they're famous for and they've been featured on the cooking channel for it!). The burger was HUGE, I was defeated after a few bites in. So flavorful, cooked perfect (but could you expect anything else?) topped with cheddar cheese and bacon, magnificent! The mac and cheese was lovely as well, baked with 6, yes 6 different cheeses, it melted in your mouth, bursting with so much flavor!!My husband got The Lachey Steak (our waiter said it was his favorite steak on the menu). When my husband took his first bite, it looked as if he died and went to heaven. Happy dance and all! My husband loves, loves, LOVES steak, and he said this was the best one he's ever had. I was so thrilled. As I mentioned we went to celebrate his birthday (you can select your reason for celebrating when making your reservation). Near the end of the meal, Chris caught my eye and asked if we celebrating my husbands birthday and I nodded yes. A few mins later Chris brings out Ricotta Doughnuts and a champagne toast to celebrate. I was floored. This is what 5 star and unbelievable customer service is about.. talk about going above and beyond. We were so touched. Overall I would have to say that was the best dining experience we've ever had, as well as the food being incredible. Honestly with all we ordered wine included, our bill wasn't bad either. We would absolutely go back, I encourage anyone who hasn't been, you must go. You won't regret it. I truly wish I could give them an even higher rating! Well done The Precinct, well done."}, {"review_id": "2M7JEU5NfJxqFUC0Ll1-fw", "user_id": "LX4kfKg0wU3rc3iTlVCssg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "After my last review, one of the Jeff Ruby employees reached out to me to get some more information about my last experience, since I mentioned I was kind of underwhelmed with my steak. Side note - I have always loved the food and service here, just this one time the steak didn't seem as tender as it usually is. After speaking with the Ruby's employee when he reached out to me, he apologized and wanted to make it right, so I ended up getting a gift card in the mail to come back! What great customer service, they definitely want you to have a great experience here and won't let you leave here without having one! This time, I got the Chris Mack, which is a blackened ribeye with a horseradish sauce on the side. This steak was perfection! So juicy and flavorful! I'm not sure what they use for the blackening seasoning but its probably the best I've ever had. This time we tried a new side to share - the fried vegetables, which was cauliflower and brussles sprouts and it was one of my favorite sides I've gotten here. We got cake this time for our dessert which was really good too, but I like the cheesecake the best! Thank you for the great service, we had a great time!"}, {"review_id": "fvbMATXA3aYF2wxpDKe44w", "user_id": "Rw6wf2GtSl-vzWSbYWePYA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/29/2017", "text": "The precinct is quite a nice establishment. This is my second time here. The first time I had the bone in ribeye, which was seasoned to perfection, very nice medium rare on the inside.The house salad was amazing. I was more impressed with the Caesar salad which had a bacon infused dressing that was absolutely a delight to the palate.  Meal complemented with a nice bottle of red wine.My counterpart order the filet. It was noted that the ribeye was far more superior in regards to flavor as well as texture.The second time around, I ordered the precinct burger. It was a good burger, however if I were to come back, I would only come here for the steak.  This time around, I had the time to several of the appetizers. First off, the crabcakes were outstanding. Flavorful, full of crabmeat, not a lot of filler. Next we had eight of the Raw oysters. One of them came out rotten.I ordered two old fashions. They were very good, on the pricey side, however, you're at an expensive steak restaurant.The phrase came out piping hot. Although I would've preferred them to be more crispy on the outside and less soggy.The burgers I've now been split from the single patty to two double patties. As I did not have the previous version I can I compare.Overall, the bar side of the restaurant has a great ambience. I really enjoyed sitting at the bar.

Go for the seasonal cocktail for sure: Fire and Ice Old Fashioned.Now that the intro is outta the way.....I've been to The Precinct several times since moving to Cinci for varied occasions: Anniversary was most recent but also for large group business and bday dinners at the formal dining room, reserved dining area and the bar and it has always surpassed expectations! The staff always delivers on service, presentation and knowledge of what they offer from food to drinks. The are a great representation of the Jeff Ruby's brand. Some top selections are: Old Fashioned cocktail, wine recommendations/pairing by the server is always exceptional and easy conversation to request within \"x\" budget per btl, Freddy Salad (of course), Arancini, oysters, garlic mash and the mac n chs.I didnt forget the steaks!!! Highly recommend: Steak Collinsworth (my go to) and for a larger appetite yet curious tastebuds, try the Michael Graham. Any dessert is delicious if you still have it in you ;).Ambiance: This place is so high-end cozy. And you'll feel like a King/Queen. But not to fret about the dress code. Although I enjoy dressing the part; if you find yourself just craving a fine steak, a great cocktail or daring to impress \"on-the-go\" for biz or date, feel free to go to the Precinct. They will be happy to enchant you in a tux or in jeans and the quality remains. Also, they have a pit in the patio which makes for a great cigar setting which they also carry for sale.

( I am kidding about the animals, but you get the point :) ).This was my first time going to this Jeff Ruby's location and so far, I like this location the best (this review is based on my one time experience here, so it is subject to change). The service was wonderful. The hostess treated us with respect and the waiter was attentive and caring by providing us with some celebration freebies (a taste of wine and cheesecake). First off, if you plan on ordering a steak do not get fooled into ordering an appetizer if you wish to eat your entire steak meal. They provide FREE bread (THE TRUFFLE BUTTER IS DELICIOUS) and a salad and side portion of mashed potatoes is included with your steak meal. Surprisingly, the salad was DELICIOUS (I have never used that word to describe a salad). I believe it is the home-made ranch dressing that provides an abundant amount of flavor, making the salad quite enjoyable to the point you feel the desire to devour it all. THE MAIN EVENT--( ********DRUM ROLLLL********* )STEAKSI ordered the Steak Collinsworth (8 oz Fillet, King Crab & Asparagus with Béarnaise & Bordelaise topping) and my date ordered the Chris Mack ( FULL POUND of Blackened Boneless Ribeye with Horseradish Sauce). Both dishes were wonderful. The fillet was THE BEST I have ever tried; they cooked it perfectly medium-rare. The texture was flawless and the toppings added additional flavor. As for the Ribeye, it was cooked to perfection as well, and each bite was packed with an explosion of flavor and juiciness, it was quite divine. If you are looking for a tender, melt-in- your-mouth, texture the fillet is my recommendation; if you prefer a more meaty steak that will punch your mouth with it's juice-packed meaty flavor punching gloves then order the Ribeye. Both steaks came with a side dish of mashed potatoes (they were good), but of course, the steaks stole the show.After eating all this food, magically the waiter turns into a Dessert God  and comes out with a vanilla cheesecake topped with whipped cream and a candle. We were horrified (we were so full we felt like we would explode) and delighted (I did not think a restaurant of this caliber would provide a freebie) at the same time. Since they were gracious enough to provide a dessert, we developed second stomachs to finish the whole entire slice of cake and each bite was worth it. Overall, this was a great experience, the steaks are phenomenal and I highly recommend you to order one. The calories, overeating and quality of food are worth it for the price and experience."}, {"review_id": "yVdJepe98Amez-x_sXxfvQ", "user_id": "3nqXlwr3pRlXDk4GalEWbw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "I normally just use Yelp for information on what to expect when heading into a restaurant aka I never write reviews, but i had to make an exception for The Precinct.  I had high expectations going in and all of them were either met or exceeded.  They treat everyone like royalty and the steaks are some of the best you'll have in your lifetime.  Obviously you pay a slight premium for the experience, but it is worth every penny.  Thank you for making our 5yr anniversary one for the record books!"}, {"review_id": "5PvpZAgoDGVlmPDwYnwZHQ", "user_id": "_HeyAW4UwTe1x_a9Fl5dhQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Ruby's Precinct,  Went above and beyond in helping us celebrate our daughter's  10th Birthday!  Special thanks to our server, Anthony and Sous Chef,  Stephen(Boomer).  It was an evening that will be difficult to top!"}, {"review_id": "HVyHXAIdC_2_1t6gETQSug", "user_id": "bvuxor346zDAen3poNl9qA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2017", "text": "Great food.

We were not disappointed. The last time we were there was way back in 1998. It's just not close to where we live so we usually stay closer afield. But we wanted GREAT steaks!Our reservation was at 6 pm, but we arrived early to check out Mount Lookout. The valet service was fast and welcoming, but we should not have been so quick to surrender the car. The Precinct is about a mile from downtown Mount Lookout and there is really not much to see so far south. We gave up after a few minutes and went in to check out the Precinct's BAR (maybe a hat tip to the Browning Automatic Rifle that the police used back when this building was Precinct 6 of the CPD?).Your first impression of the building is that it's REALLY cool looking. It was built around the turn of the 20th century by the same Samuel Hannaford that did Cincinnati's Music Hall, City Hall, Observatory, and the Cincinnatian Hotel. It really is a beautiful structure inside and out and is listed on the National Register. The late fall had made the outside look a little scruffy, and they missed some great opportunity for holiday lighting, but it WAS Thanksgiving weekend and I'll give them a pass on that.Inside though was a different story. The holiday decorations had gone up that morning and it was just lovely. Very tasteful and totally stayed within the mood of the place. The host staff was attentive, friendly and very flexible offering to take us right to our table despite our early arrival. We chose the BAR instead. Up a couple of short flights of steps and through some old fashion swinging doors is a GORGEOUS watering hole crowned by a magnificent, antique Brunswick bar. The room is rife with memorabilia lining the walls, the bartenders were super friendly, and they had an interesting menu of themed drinks, BUT, I had heard that they were good with appletinis, and we were feeling nostalgic. They came quickly and were good, but not great and not generously sized for the $30 (with tip) price for two. One tiny negative tick, but not a big deal.Just a quick mention of staff here: They were all friendly, greeted us without fail, wished us happy anniversary, and made us feel like royalty. And they run the gamut from really attractive to outright stunning. Just great looking people all around.We went downstairs for dinner and this is where the real show began. Our waiter, Jake (über handsome), showed us to our table, presented menus and the wine list and got us some ice water. He offered suggestions on various wines, but I had quickly made up my mind on a Stag's Leap that we really enjoy. Off he went for the wine and we decided on dinner.He returned to present and pour the wine (it was excellent) and we ordered. For her: Steak Collinsworth (medium rare) with garlic mashed potatoes and a caesar salad. For me: The Brenneman (medium) with garlic mashed potatoes and the house salad. We also added in the baked mac & cheese to share as Jake raved about it.For the rest of the meal, the timing was spot on. Our wine and water was replenished at the right times. When the wine was poured, our glasses were always kept at exactly the same level to within less than a millimeter. The salads came out when we expected and were wonderful. We were allowed to enjoy those at our leisure with the excellent house sourdough and salted rye. And once the salads were cleared away our meals were served with no errors.The steaks were just divine. My wife took the first bite of hers and said, \"Oh my gosh, this is embarrassing.\"I said, \"What is it?\",  expecting a spill or a slashed finger from my lovingly clumsy better half.\"I came.\", she said with a coy smile. (The steaks are THAT good.)We took our time enjoying the meal. The garlic mashed potatoes are probably the best I've had anywhere. The mac & cheese, though tasty, was just too rich for us both. We took it home to our daughter who claims to be a connoisseur.The meals were then cleared away and the table meticulously scraped clean for our complimentary slice of house cheesecake with a single lit candle. We made a wish, snuffed the candle, then dug in. It was fabulous, but my wife has a thing for crème brûlée so we ordered that, too. It was also really nice, but I would have preferred more cheesecake.We finally surrendered as we just couldn't eat another bite. Jake quickly packaged up our few take home items in one of their swanky handled bags and we settled the bill. The whole affair came to around $300 all in, which for us puts The Precinct in a \"twice a year\" type of category, but we will definitely be back sooner than 19 years. We commented during the meal that we rarely have a perfect experience, but this was about as close as you can get."}, {"review_id": "caOW-wLcG2PbBEukYjfbrw", "user_id": "v8x8O1sM7VtD5ZKxM2H3zg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "It was our first time here and it was The BEST Filet I have ever had!
