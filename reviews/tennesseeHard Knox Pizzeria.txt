I avoided the place for years because of that, because they were just never on top of the process. I doubt I will be back after this visit unfortunately. It's taking forever just to get through the line which consists of a guy and his little girl. Update: Finally made it to the register. Nothing fast about the process. Once there, I was informed the thing I wanted to order, which was on the menu online, was no longer available. I turned around and left. Terrible decision by management, I suppose based on not wanting to pay wait staff, but ends up screwing both staff and customers. I won't be back."}, {"review_id": "o3vCVDRjJop_IeCSNa9VeQ", "user_id": "N0b80z4s7Lq2Ithlt4oLYw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "No bags, napkins paper player.. grease went over my car seats:(( customer service was a bit off ."}, {"review_id": "OAyz72yEt1pH41szXR7-GA", "user_id": "nqU4B1IcjjD-iyiligF_Vw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "My service was great.

The first and 3rd times we had it it was FANTASTIC, but the 2nd and 4th it was nothing to write home about. What is going on here?! This pizza is too expensive to not know what quality you're going to get. Knocked down to 3.5 stars.Original: I love hard knox! I ordered the caprese this past time and was so impressed by the quality. Couldn't believe how ripe the tomatoes were considering it's May. The barbed wire pizza is my favorite I've tried.l, I was blown away by the deliciousness. The only downfall is your tab can get high for a pizza place quickly when you are washing your meal down with the craft beers. I'm so glad they expanded into the space next door - it's much more pleasant to eat in now.Note for Chrits: the sausage is the crumbly kind"}, {"review_id": "vQqhqkKQDgC7H6eXBfEceQ", "user_id": "ocTUbbzOoZ7ALNMC0HfKcQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Do not go here.

Tell it like it is and call a spade a spade. So here goes...I came to this establishment for a YELP Elite Event. For attending we were given a free pizza each and two free drink tickets! Yea!Each Yelper went up to a pizza bar and were handed a pizza board with a hand-tossed crust on it. BTW, the dough guy knows how to throw dough! Anyway, the options for the top of the pie were ample: red or while sauce, bacon, sausage, pepperoni, olives, onions, basil, fresh mozzarella, shredded mozzarella, Parmesan, mushrooms, and a few other things. Our server took the pie and within 5 minutes the pie was on my table ready to consume.Here's my thing. We put our hands into each of the containers to fetch out our toppings. When I asked why we weren't wearing gloves, the server responded that the health department agrees that a pie going into 700 degrees kills everything and stated that the cooks don't wear gloves either. Can I go there for a second? People that fail to wash their hands after a restroom visit...okay...I cannot go there...even at 700 degrees.I would have liked to seen the menu, truthfully. I stated that I felt this location was no different than any of the other 5 min pizza joints in town (no names mentioned but super popular). One of my fellow Elite Yelpers stated that their menu items exceed the homemade selections we tasted. On an upside the environment was nice. It was also clean...including the windows which are a BIG DEAL for me. No TVs crowding the walls. People had to actually talk to each other. The servers are super friendly and predictive. They brought to-go boxes without us having to ask.I'm not sure what else they had to drink other than beer because there were no menus and the only thing offered was water and beer.I have to admit, this restaurant isn't on my list of places to return to."}, {"review_id": "iE4AweNGoVn1Mu-OIZgidw", "user_id": "_DWut2imFV3BL692WzgI5A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/21/2017", "text": "Beautifully crafted, perfectly made, genuinely enjoyed. I had the best Sunday lunch at Hard Knox. The atmosphere was laid back, the staff was friendly and accommodating, and the food was fresh. Their pizza, salads and appetizers are an art form. We ordered the Roni Rolls for the first time ever and now I have a new staple/tradition. They were unreal. Perfectly cut so you can enjoy them in a few bites or lack them up to have later. Now, there are few things I love more than pepperoni + mozzarella + Parmesan/garlic dough...but this was better than pepperoni app I've ever had. For our main, we then split a Rocket salad (+pepperoni, chicken) and a Great White Hope pie. I can't even express how awesome the combination of all of these items was. What a dream meal. If you're not a pizza-eater or if you're low carb, get a full Rocket salad with protein and you will be satisfied for sure. If you are a pizza-eater and love pesto, Great White Hope is a MUST. The only thing I don't love here is the price. It's just a little expensive for me, so I can't eat here a lot. That being said, I'll be back in a few weeks for another perfect meal because I firmly believe it's okay to splurge on a perfect meal every now and then!"}, {"review_id": "1J0AknKo2y9FQDhW21gJaQ", "user_id": "YzGDHAhPJX_xc6wzWsPmzg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2017", "text": "Solid pizza.This is not the best I've ever had, but it was pretty darned good.Bonus that they do 8-inch lunch size pizzas.

Hard Knox does a pretty good job of pulling off a truly Italian pizza (even if I ordered non typical Italian toppings).

The pizza is good, but not as spectacular as I'd expect for the size-to-price ratio. Decent beer selection that changes up frequently. Salads are way overpriced, IMO, but don't let that stop you if you're craving leaves. Their meatball appetizer is so good you'll regret not ordering one to eat all by yourself... I shared it with my Constant Dining Companion, and he had the nerve to eat his half much to my consternation! Cool, industrial interior but loud even when they aren't crowded.

The crust is so good. The cheese is so melty. And it's a great show to watch the line prepare pies, toss them, and blaze them in the oven. There are several options to build your own or you can pick from their own creative selections. I love Marciano the best. The Hawaiian is also really good. This isn't going to be a fast food cardboard pizza spot. Call ahead or arrive early. Because there will be a lineup crammed at the counter. If you can, try to get a seat outside when the weather is nice and a band is scheduled to play. All of the ingredients are high quality. This is the closest you will get to gourmet artisan pizza. You know, the kind that's so fancy you eat it with a fork and knife. Don't let that scare you. It's time for you to outgrow fraternity style cardboard pizza anyways."}, {"review_id": "axiNG_q1ECWJ_EglGhrrUA", "user_id": "buHW5XWga929RG2pdOQ6Kg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "So delish!!
