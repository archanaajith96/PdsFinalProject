The chorizo is amazing. Fish tacos outstanding. The new cali fries are to die for.   Beef burrito beat anything we have had on the east coast. The pork on the taco salad was so perfectly seasoned. All of this in a super clean, very warm and friendly atmosphere.Two big thumbs up.  Can't wait to return and try more."}, {"review_id": "fz2_C6ylCbkB2uzZesUvjg", "user_id": "gnJDOrXo2cJ8xkRXU7GUWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/1/2017", "text": "Why does the best taco spot have to be located in the Quad Cities?? Man this place has some of the best Al Pastor I've ever had and they have a pork belly tack as well. It's located across a gas station along a busy road. Now let's get to the food...My first time here I ordered 2 al pastors, steak and pork. The Al Pastor was seasoned and flavored so nicely that I totally forgot that it didn't come with pieces of pineapple. Usually Al Pastor has pieces of pineapple FYI but that didn't hurt the flavor of the meat at all. The steak was cooked perfect and seasoned just as well and so was the pork. My second visit I had all Al Pastor with Pork Belly taco and it was Taco Tuesday so they had ground beef tacos for 99 cents, so why not. The ground beef taco was amazing and I wish I ordered more but the high light was the pork belly that came with some green sauce on top. Wow! Wow! Wow! The flavor of that crispy pork inside that taco was on point. If you're ever around the Quad Cities, do yourself a favor and be sure to check this place out. Trust me it's worth it!"}, {"review_id": "UtDZhagKZAsjlGkJKvZyYg", "user_id": "bxi6kc_hxtvZcGhOF1pYXw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2017", "text": "My wife and I were in Davenport to play at the casinos and just have some fun and we decided we were craving some Mexican food so we decided to give this place a shot. The menu is very short and is one of the no combos menu buy individual. Not an issue just more interesting. My wife got 3 steak tacos and I got the carnitas burrito we had chips and salsa to share. The tacos were of good size and the steak looked perfectly cooked. My burrito was massive and the pork was amazing. The salsa was spicy and you could tell it was home made. They had green and red salsa that is all not hot mild or anything like that they said it was all the same spice level all depended on what kind of tomatoes were used. I myself loved the green salsa my wife loved the red. Everything had great flavor and you could tell it was homemade. All in all I'm sure I'll be back if in the area."}, {"review_id": "sVccnjUCPqqlkp0tlA7KCg", "user_id": "DgLOt08hV0dwCKg3nGNGzw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/27/2016", "text": "This is the only place I noticed that is within walking distance from the hospital. Of course I was not sad to find a good Mexican restaurant with authentic tacos as my nearby option!I did not try the tacos though, the torta was calling my name! I chose the barbacoa torta and was not disappointed. The meat was juicy and tender. The bread had a nice grilled crisp. Everything was just the perfect amount to add flavor and not overwhelm the other ingredients.Service was just ok.

It's served cafeteria style and will set you back a little more then most other Mexican joints. The area is pretty sketchy as well. Food definitely makes it worth eating there. I had pork belly, chicken, and carne Assad's tacos with a side of Mexican rice it was delicious.

Everyone was happy with their food. This is my second visit and both times I've been impressed with the fare and service.Tonight I got two street tacos and an avocado tostada. My tacos were delicious, and I liked that there were roughly 10 choices available for filling. I got carne asada and spicy pork. The pork wasn't too spicy, but was definitely tasty and probably my favorite. The tacos come with chorizo and onion, but you can also choose to get them \"American Style\" with lettuce, cheese, and tomatoes, which was nice because it met my mother and grandmother's expectations of how a taco should be dressed, and kept everyone happy. The tostada was a little light on avocado and heavy on cheese for my taste, but I still liked it.The fact  that the parking lot was a madhouse right up until we left 20 minutes before closing time vouches for the quality of the food at Los Primos.

The food here isn't bad, but that's all there is to say. I am well traveled, and having relocated here a few months back, I have decided:*the Quad Cities loves their south of the border eats, as everyone I have spoken to on the subject, speaks with enthusiasm when asked about their favorite Mexican restaurant. *the Quad Cities version of Mexican cuisine is bland as tofu-slathered-rice cakes. *having dined in the roach coaches in L. A. to the finest 4 star cantinas in NY...the prices here are surprisingly high. $10 for 4 street tacos is pricing on par with most almost any high end Mexican establishment from coast to coast.

We didn't receive silverware, so my husband asked for some and received 2 plastic forks. Not to mention, it was probably about 60 degrees in the restaurant. The beans were watery and bland.
