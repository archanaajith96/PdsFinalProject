I am so happy with this restaurant. They are always so kind and don't take offense if you ask for your rolls with/without an ingredient, which is something I've experienced at other restaurants. The servers are helpful, the restaurant is very clean and tidy.They have happy hour on food and drinks that is divine!

I like the fact that they have good portions of the sushi and it is generally fresh. Unfortunately I remembered why I stopped going there before. I really cannot understand why they would water down their soy sauce since this is such an important part of the sushi experience. Fortunately my experience improved because the waitress was kind enough to bring soy sauce in the \"to go\" packets. I really hope management changes this policy because I am sure they are losing customers over this. I have visited hundreds of sushi restaurants throughout the United States and in Europe and this is the only restaurant that has watered down their soy sauce. If they don't deliberately water it down then they are simply buying an inferior product from their vendor."}, {"review_id": "XOqyVDB2E3XTsUdux6FsyA", "user_id": "n_iZLTP5qLt1W1RyyNdpgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "This is our favorite sushi restaurant in town!  The special rolls are delicious and enormous.

I've been to Japan many times and I have to say this is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the States. Service is excellent. Try their Sushi sample if you like sashimi/raw fish.

Who had two thumbs and doesn't pack or eat breakfast AND snacks? YO! YO does!Originally, my husband and I were going to hit an Indian spot in Gulfport but I didn't read the hours and they were actually closed for the day. He mentioned that he could go for sushi and being the little avid Yelper I (want to be haha) am, I went straight to my bookmarks. We decided to come here because we are trying not to eat at the same places.They have good reviews so we decided why not. They'll be decent at most! Right?We were immediately seated in a completely empty restaurant. Which didn't stay empty because soon after folks started coming through.Alex was our server. Very on top of things. Drinks came out on time, he checked on us a few times. There was one disconnect tho. We were finishing up our appetizers (veggie tempura, agedashi tofu, osumashi soup, salad, and edamame) and then he asked if we wanted to bring out the rolls. My husband and I kind of looked at each other like, were they waiting? Maybe we should've told him to keep the orders rolling. Other than that, he was very nice, attentive and we never saw the bottom of our drinks.The menu is kind of big. They have a wide variety of wines and sakes in the front of the menu. They give you a sheet and you just check off what rolls/apps you want.We ordered: Veggie roll - cucumber, mushroom, oshinko, and some kind of leafy green. I LOVED this roll! Nice and crunchy!Pacific Roll -  \"Seared albacore tuna, jalapeno, cucumber & smelt roe rolled inside, topped with fresh mango & avocado,  nished with red tobiko and served with our special creamy sauce\"I LOVED this roll too! Tuna was slightly seared which was perfect for me because I typically do NOT like seared tuna. It was spicy! So good!Spicy tuna roll - spice was right, we like it on the spicier side. Tuna was mixed well and wasn't chewy!Crazy Monkey Roll - hella spicy! Loved it!The rolls are def on the pricier side however, the rolls are big and not stuffed with hella rice. The veggies are crunchy and the fish is fresh. It doesn't smell, it's not chewy. It's balanced! The rice was cooked perfect and the seaweed was fresh.We enjoyed our time there catching up after being part for 10 days and we enjoyed our dinner.Will definitely be back...Hey, Mississippi? I'm sorry for everything I said when I was hungry... You're not thaaaaat bad."}, {"review_id": "83x_Go0pvPJeDtcZABH1YQ", "user_id": "Eu8v5sKWOya9apB-KL4pIA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/11/2017", "text": "Patrick, my server, was great. Attentive but not overbearing and helpful with recommendations. High quality tuna, luscious avocados, a solid wine list and a menu you can get lost in. Here's where they lost their 5th star: The rice was notably tough/old and there was a TON of it on the roll. The nori was so tough I could not bite through it and ended up disassembling my roll. The togarashi/furikaki seasoning on top of the roll was very heavy handed. Normally I'd give this a 3 star but the fish/produce quality and service were excellent enough to bump it up. I'm hoping I hit them on an off day."}, {"review_id": "C2NT_6nWoMKlI-SV_cQWWg", "user_id": "4sktx-TKd5fUUWjK51gawQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/18/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "My favorite place to get sushi on the coast.

Saw some good reviews for Samurai so we made plans to eat there. Nice looking inside with a relaxed atmosphere. Server was friendly and knowledge and was a great help in making our choices. Simple green salad with ginger dressing was very fresh and tasty. Miso soup, first time trying it, was awesome. We had a variety of tempura, chicken, shrimp and vegetables and all very flavorful. Teriyaki chicken was tender and done very well with a superb sauce, not overly salty like most teriyaki can be. Too bad we're leaving town soon, or we'd be visiting again for sure.

The sashimi was perfect, and I enjoyed every bit - even the yellow tail, which personally I  normally don't care for. The salmon sushi was great, though a bit small portioned. My gf is a huge fan of salmon so having a bento box fixated around salmon sushi and sashimi made her very happy; even more so when we found out the high quality of the fish. The inside of the restaurant is nicely decorated and lit. The staff were all attentive and helpful. My drinking glass never hit empty, which is always a big plus in my book.
