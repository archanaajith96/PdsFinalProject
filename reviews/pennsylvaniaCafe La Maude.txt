The place is small but so nicely decorated. It has a cool mediterranean feel. There is also outdoor seating when it's nice out. The menu has Lebanese and French spins on classic brunch favorites. The coffee and espresso are excellent. The service also cannot be better. I came here with my fiancé and sister this Sunday. The place was packed. A very nice man, who appeared to be the owner, told us the wait was 40 minutes, but we were seated in 30, which was a pleasant surprise. We were seated outside, and the service could not have been more awesome. Our server was nice, attentive, personable and very knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered a latte with a double espresso. It was literally the best latte I've had in Philly. For an appetizer, we ordered the grilled cheese sandwich. It was out of this world. The baguette was fresh and amazing, and the halloum cheese made the sandwich divine. For my entree I got the brunch style Cordon Bleu. Our food came out in a flash, and it was so tasty. The flavors were complex in the best way possible. Everyone really enjoyed their meals. I could describe each dish but the photos speak for themselves. You have to come here to experience Philly brunch at its best."}, {"review_id": "wIW2_c3YoI4kWkHsqeT5cg", "user_id": "pu2UlNlMpirGHXT6dlpiJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Tried this place thanks to a recommendation by a friend. We arrived with a group of 7 and were told the wait would be about an hour. The host (I believe his name is Yani) was super sweet. We decided to put our name down and wait outside across the street so we didn't crowd the narrow sidewalk. About 15 minutes later we decided we may go to another restaurant but Yani came out and came across the street to let us know he would have us in in a few minutes. We were in about 10 minutes later. So the service was exceptional! Food: I got the huevos ranchero and it was amazing. The different sauces were great compliments. My friends got various meals and everyone loved their dishes. Make sure to get the vanilla iced latte! The best I have had from anywhere."}, {"review_id": "mYPpwq95ZT3N19ZWUTBVDw", "user_id": "oR5az_eNCnfN7e49H3ONhg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Came here a couple weeks ago for brunch as a welcome-back celebration after leaving the continent for vacation. This place's website title boasts \"Philadelphia's best brunch\". Wow, making some ballsy claims now, aren't we?I chose this place on this day particularly because contrary to my usual brunch situation where I can't get my shit together until AT LEAST 2pm, I knew that I would be starting the day off early and thus, I figured my chances of getting a table at an expedited rate would be improved. My GF and I strolled in, and I'm going to pull a comcast timeframe rn because I don't recall specifics, but between 11am-12pm on a Sunday during the cusp of spring and therefore PRIME brunch hour. My heart sank and my stomach LURCHED when I saw the groups of people waiting by the entrance. FMLLLLL. I hate waiting, especially when my peptic ulcers are gnawing. Much to my astonishment, there was a seat for two that had by golly just opened up near the entrance and we were seated.......get ready for it.....IMMEDIATELY, at cafe la-fucking-maude. I must have done something good recently to deserve this good karma but god only knows what that is. OMG maybe it's bc ppl r starting to recognize me.Anyway, the options are bountiful and with a mediterranean twist which breaks away from the usual boring brunch mold. After some serious carb indiscretions on my vacay, I needed to get back into keto ASAP so my selection was narrowed and thank god because I'm both extremely indecisive and I also have limited attention span when it comes to reading. Both Tinasaurus and I went with the vegetarian omelette,\"quatre fromage\" consisting of fontina, mozarella, gruyere and tartufa cheese with a few avocado slices on top and hugged by salad and za'atar potatoes. The omelette itself was good, I would actually prefer the avocado be immersed from the cheese within but oh well. Combo of cheeses provided a good, cheesy flavor. Fruit components was heavily represented in the salad and the dressing was tasty. I only had ONE POTATO CUBE and it was delicious. This place is BYOB and they give you a cute like purple bag with ice to put your 'pagne in. BYOB-ness helps shave down the bill. Overall this place was good and the depth and uniqueness of the menu is hard to find in Philly but I would have to respectfully disagree with the \"best brunch in philly\" claim however this is a SOLID brunch choice nonetheless."}, {"review_id": "Itq-1yi20MZRE4Y6pStPlQ", "user_id": "TO0bPuHD4La4L1xcqd5z9Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Finally got around to trying this spot out. I was a little nervous reading the other reviews about the wait but we really didn't have an issue. The owner/manager was very friendly and made sure we got a table in time. He told us to walk around for 20 minutes and come back to check in with him and he had a table waiting for us just in time. Super funky decor and photographs all around which was nice to see. A lot of similar items as Parc's menu so it's a nice option for this area or if you're looking for something similar. I went for the Croque Maude--$18.50 - It was just as good as Parc's version and I think the price is around the same as well. It's the closest version in Philly I can find to the Madame Frieda at Jack's Wife Frieda in NYC. Make sure you come hungry if you're getting this dish it's HUGE and has fries and a small salad with it. (French ham, bacon, and a cheese blend served on grilled pain de mie with Mornay & avocado sauces, sunny side up egg,  side of fries & crudite)We also tried the Berrylicious Pain Perdu--$17.00 with the mascarpone cheese which was insane. (Stuffed brioche, with mascarpone cheese OR Nutella, crème brûlée bananas, topped with warm berries & passion fruit sauce)Coffee was really good too! They do have some limited outdoor seating for when the weather is nice.

I came here for birthday brunch with my parents on a Sunday morning.  Since I hang out with old people, we arrived there before 9:30 AM and avoided the notorious Sunday brunch lines. The cafe is tastefully decorated.  Simple, and french-ey, I guess (Idk, I have no interior design skills).  Menu has some cultural flair. For some reason I kept thinking French-Lebanese cuisine but I literally have no idea what I'm talking about most of the time and could be completely wrong.The menu is HUGE. If you have any issue with making quick decisions I would suggest reviewing it online the day before- or maybe a week in advance if you're anything like me.  There are egg plates, sandwiches, salads, and sweet stuff.  There are plenty of options to go for a healthier breakfast or in the opposite direction with something like creme brulee oatmeal which sounds delectable. Anyway- on to the food!!!!: I ordered the Green Shakshuka and was very pleased. I can't recall ever having shakshuka out before; I've only ever made it for myself, so it was nice to know what a real dish is like. Bonus points for making me feel healthy AF while also indulging.  It had all the vegetables. I think they may have tried to pull one over on me and gave me normal redtomatoes instead of green ones, and they could have been a bit more liberal with the tahini sauce and feta, but I was happy enough so I didn't say anything. The price may be high, but the quality is great and the portions are huge.The rest of my party enjoyed their meals: the N-Liberties (basically egg + breakfast meat+ potatoes on crack with some hummus and a salad thrown on there too), the El Beit (also a healthy choice and delicious as leftovers (I ate my mom's)), and the Sweet Potato Benny (could have done with more hollandaise but no complaints).  My only regret is not convincing someone at the table to order something on the sweeter side so I could try it. Service was fast and friendly.  Bonus points for being right next to a plant store. A SIDE NOTE: This place is not an average-priced brunch spot.  Plan to pay around $20 for your food and that's not including any coffee drinks. SECOND SIDE NOTE: it's BYOB, so at least you can save a little here.  This would be a nice spot for a small celebration, a date, or just your average meal if you're going with someone who's loaded."}, {"review_id": "7pnYe3EC3W6PLah4DSOK8w", "user_id": "aD5fQCKXWaGcT_kcVny-sw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "I HAVE TO GIVE THIS PLACE 5 STARS- if there was an option for 10 stars, they would get it. I came here with a large group, 9 girls during a bachelorette weekend. They don't take reservations so I knew it might be some trouble. The guy tells me the wait might be about 2 hours but because of the reviews I knew this place was a must. I told him that we would wait and if we have to be split up 5 and 4 that would be fine. We wait approximately 40 minutes and they were ready to seat 5 people. We walk to the back and BOOM- he [the guy, not sure if he's the owner but he had a cap when I was there] figured out a master plan. There was a couple seated to the left of our table and he asked them to move, combined the tables and all 9 of us sat comfortably. 9 girls, in less than an hour. What I really loved is this place had vegetarian options. I ordered the tiramisu pancakes and they were DELICIOUS. Extremely sweet but every calorie was worth it. Their Le Chef is also extremely tasty, one of us got it. The French toast is also worth the mention- absolutely amazing. Honestly, not one complaint about their food. I believe my server was Andrea [if not, she's the Venezuelan]- AMAZING. Her ability to help us pick what would be best for us to drink and eat was impressive. She asked what we liked- gave us the best option, and she was right every time. This places dirty chai and vanilla chai is amazing. Must order.

This place came highly recommended on Yelp AND a couple of my friends co-signed the recommendations so I was excited to try it out. Stuff definitely seems a little 'close quarters' but it was quite cozy. And the establishment is bigger than it looks from the outside; there's more seating in the back. I LOVED my lebanese stuffed grilled pita. When I first read the description on the menu, I didn't think I'd enjoy the vegetables (broccoli and zucchini) IN the pita and was originally told that they could be put on the side...server returned and told me actually they had to be included. At first I was salty at the misinformation but the pita ended up being AMAZING. And so filling. No space for dessert (although to be honest, nothing on the dessert menu really excited me). My husband tried the gaufre chicken cordon bleu. I don't think he knew beforehand it was going to be a variation of chicken and waffles but he was definitely satisfied. And their breakfast potatoes are bomb, I usually have a problem with breakfast potatoes being too salty but not here. While it is more pricey than other brunch places, I definitely want to try this place again: how could I not be drawn to their interesting menu and flavors?

We're here regularly! My check ins do not show how many times I've been here! They would be a lot more. This place is quieter on the weekdays so if you can make it there then, I'd suggest it!! It's open until 4 and parking is surprisingly easy to find around the nearby streets. However, if you can't make it there until the weekend, definitely expect a wait! But you could order coffee from their cafe while you wait. Also, On another note, when you are done with your food - be courteous - pay and leave yo!! There are people waiting for tables  Their coffees are delicious. Their chai lattes are one of the best I've ever had and I'm a coffee shop snob ‍. Food is great - portions are big but it's so good that you'll finish it all. But if you like to try different things, order a couple of dishes and do family style! The pancakes are definitely for the sweet tooth. They have so many flavors that all go so well together. Some of my favorites brunch dishes are the chicken and waffles, Mediterranean platter, lamp chops, and petit steak. Chicken and waffles are a twist to the traditional ones - they have eggs and sauces - and I actually get them with no ham so I assume they're even better with ? ‍ chicken is nice and crispy - not soggy! Mediterranean platter is a great option for when you're hungry but not starving. It has hummus, labne, zatar pita, eggs, and veggies! And you're basically putting things together or eating them separately. I loveeee it! Everything just goes so well.   The labne is creamy, hummus is light and yummmmy, and zatar pita is just delish! There's a small piece of grilled halloumi hiding on the plate tooo - if you're a halloumi fan, you may want to ask for more. Lamp chops! So, some of the best chops ever! They are cooked so well AND most importantly, there is so much meat on each chop. I usually find lamp chops to never have enough leaving me to want more. It comes with eggs and grits, which are more on the saucy side than creamy so you're basically dipping and or covering the chop pieces in the sauce and enjoying it like that. If you're familiar with shakshuka, their's is a bit more runny than I've had at other places. So, it just depends on what you like. The petit steak is an interesting mix of ingredients. Eggs, steak, potatoes, veggies, apples and mangoes!! And then with sauces and truffle oil and balsamic vinaigrette! And it all goes really well together. I'd say the The steak pieces are cooked well, which would be too cooked if eating alone, but it works with this dish. The Mediterranean burrito is a very large and filling dish. However, I've proudly finished all of mine on several occasions. It has your standard burrito ingredients except it's on a open face pita - but it's all very flavorful!"}, {"review_id": "hVJbuRjcwM7Ps0odjcqjEw", "user_id": "5uWz5_PITe7Kjfeoo5z77A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "A really cool breakfast joint in Northern Liberty. The owner was super friendly and knew all his customers. The restaurant itself was classy without being overly pretentious. We had the seating by the windows and they were the best, having a lot of sunlight as you enjoy your beautiful morning breakfast.The price was high but for the area and the quality of food, I doubt anyone is complaining. Everything on the menu looked delicious and we couldn't decide. Our waitresses was very knowledgeable and helped us picked some awesome dishes. We got the sweet potato benny and petit steak breakfast with a side of applewood bacon and French fries. We also ordered vanilla chai latte and the berrylicious French toast for the dessert.If I could only use one word to describe our food, it would be \"beautiful\". I did not expect art on a plate for breakfast when I came here. The colors and presentation was very clean and appetizing. My sweet potato Benny plate was very good. One of my poached eggs was over cooked but everything else was simply delicious. I love that the hash were made from sweet potatoes, they added a sweet contrast to the savory Lebanese sausage. The petit steak breakfast had similar elements to my dish but tasted even better. The steaks were tender and perfectly seasoned. I really appreciated the fact that their hash came with mango chunks. They really nailed the balance of flavors here, sweet and savory. The French fries were very crunchy, just the way I like them. The Apple wood bacon was crisp throughout the meal. This place really knew how to elevate simple ingredients!My vanilla chai latte was one of the best I've had and again, the presentation was just beautiful. My favorite dish however, was dessert. We had our waitress to thank for that, I apologize for not asking for her name but if the owner is reading this, just know that your waitresses were terrific.The berrylicious French toast came with hazelnut spread and brûlée banana with finely chopped mangos and berries topped with this sweet, creamy sauce that tasted like heaven. I had no complaint on this dish whatsoever.Overall, this was an amazing experience and I recommend everyone to check the restaurant out.

I've been here a couple times and I have been underwhelmed on both visits. The first time I visited, 3 of us came on a Friday morning for brunch and had to wait around 20-30 minutes, which was particularly annoying because there were a few tables that had not been cleaned after guests had left.They had both inside and outside seating. A table outside opened up first, so that's where we chose to sit. Outside seating is on a slanted sidewalk, which was very uncomfortable. During my second visit I sat inside, which felt tight and small, but it felt a lot nicer than sitting on a tilted, wobbly table. Because of the wait, I had plenty of time to look at the menu and read reviews. What surprised me was the prices, as this place is notably more expensive than similar restaurants.
