Tucked on the corner of Church and Bank Street, Dobra is the perfect place to read, buy and drink tea. I especially love the nooks, dim lighting, low tables and pillows to drink tea or snack. My only regret is not finding this place sooner and staying longer.The staff was knowledgeable, friendly and patient with those unfamiliar with tea. The shop sells an assortment of herbal and black teas, allowing you to create a custom blend for $5.50 per ounce: they also have prepared mixes.

I've been three separate times now and each time, I have either been completely ignored or couldn't find anyone to help me. Last time I went, I even sat myself down at a table (inside) and waited for 10 minutes but no one ever showed up. I know I'm short and people can't see me but I just want some tea! I love tea and tearooms in general so I'm really bumming that I apparently can't try it. :-( but I still give Dobra 2 stars because the decor is awesome- I wish my house was as cozy and cultural as this place!

I enjoyed the service and appreciated the vegan options. I will say the bubble/boba tea lived up to the reviews I read about it here on Yelp - it doesn't seem like they make fresh tapioca pearls which is disappointing. But maybe it's hard to make fresh batches if so few customers order bubble tea. My only other issue would be I wish they had more comfortable chairs."}, {"review_id": "G0ToRMJINsvTxQu3UPgEpg", "user_id": "PR2aF-8bOk4rIujGhTbwJQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/16/2017", "text": "The atmosphere and the tea was wonderful.

My son and I stumbled upon this place after a day of college tours - my son loves tea, so we decided to check it out.  I walked in with a cup of coffee from another coffee house. We were seated and after a wait our order was taken.  At no time was any mention made of the cup I brought in BEING A PROBLEM.  My son's chai and truffle were delivered and after more waiting, the cookies I ordered were delivered. At this point the server (dark beard & glasses) decides to tell me that I can't have a drink from elsewhere \"or they could get shutdown.\" It was baffling and such a turn off.... if they had said something before we were seated / ordered I would have understood, but it was about 15 minutes into our visit. I stood outside to finish my drink, my son finished his chai alone, bought some loose leaf tea & we even tipped these silly people. Very negative feeling, we won't be back. Bad Karma."}, {"review_id": "u1L29mEde1s_5ptizWWS9w", "user_id": "jbme6UoDggF7NtkItZZyhA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/5/2015", "text": "Get ready to read.The menu is a book, but a book full of information and descriptions of each tea. They offer a lot.They give you a bell to ring when you're ready to order. I'm not a big tea nut, but my sister suggested we stop in. The tea I got reminded me of Tazo Passion Tea and it was pretty good. No one had any complaints. We also tried some of the bakes goods and they were really tasty. Maple glazed donut, baklava, and some kind of lemon cake I think it was, that was really good.My only complaint was how dim the lighting was. Usually it's nice but it was to much. Staff was friendly. They also had teas and tea related items you could buy.

Everything from the music to the seating to the pots that the tea are served in is wonder and promotes a relaxing place to stop in on any day.

I realize this is like an ancient tea house and bubble tea is a modern fad, but if you have it on your menu and are charging $8.50 for it, you should know how to make it. Or don't offer it--that's an option. They make it with whole milk which is fine but sweetened condensed milk (a tablespoon) is preferred for the silkiness it provides, but I'm from the West Coast so what do I know. Next, boba pearls need to be fresh. These were old and stuck together, also breaking down so it was like chewing on peeling skin. Gross. These tapioca pearls had been sitting out for a while. Boba are only good for like an hour after you boil them. Then, it's a fourth of a cup of boba, not two tablespoons. But thankfully it was only 2 tablespoons because they were yuck! Finally, I asked for some honey to be added to my drink which did not happen."}, {"review_id": "3N38ddQOeCFoxaMicwHGTQ", "user_id": "epEeyQ_5S1WEAJL1CKB0BQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/14/2016", "text": "An authentic tea room with a blush of therapeutic vibe.

We just picked one since there are just too many. Besides tea, they also serve little appetizers. So we picked the hummus plate.You get the learn the art of drinking tea, it is so cool, but of course, something we dont have the patient to do at home.The hummus plate was good, i was just hope they have walnut and mint instead of carrots, celery, and cuccumber, but oh well, its not exactly meditarrian kind of place.I definately wanted to come back here again."}, {"review_id": "fPl6NYfy-LfsQh1_dWET0Q", "user_id": "AHRrG3T1gJpHvtpZ-K0G_g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/3/2015", "text": "Just as I imagined - pillows for lounging, charming elements like a table side bell to place your order, huge and informative menu that could equally serve as the Bible of Tea, granola-eating patrons and employees and a coziness that is certain to thaw you out no matter how could it is outside.

The whole ordering, consumption, etc. process makes you feel welcome enough to stay all afternoon. I opted for the Jasmine Pearls tea and my date, the Chai. I can't speak for the Chai but the Jasmine Tea was just what I was hoping for - light and refreshing with a pot of hot water to keep the party flame alive.According to my accomplice, the matcha ice cream is where it's at - in fact, she told me it is only made for Dobra by a local creamery.
