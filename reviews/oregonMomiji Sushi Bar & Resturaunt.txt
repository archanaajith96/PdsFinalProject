I've had sushi in different cities and states and nothing can compare to the value and taste at momiji. I don't live in Salem anymore but I make it a point to go everytime I am in town.  My go to is the salmon premium roll and the miso sexy roll,  while my fiance loves their Salem roll. The salmon premium roll is perfectly seared and can actually fill you up by itself because they pack it with so much salmon!  Their lunch special is such a good deal as well and get the rocky salmon and the oregon salmon roll when I opt for the lunch special.  Do yourself a favor and do their unlimited sushi deal though.  It already pays for itself if you order two of their premium rolls and apps!  You can't go wrong with this place and since moving to Minnesota where the sushi selection isn't the best,  I miss this place more and more!"}, {"review_id": "9JLEDF5MeDd6DIv2o2Ivag", "user_id": "Hkp0MIuflnYsOL984QwVXw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "This is a TINY sushi restaurant in Salem, Oregon.  Parking lot was small (being shared with a convenience 7-11 like store adjacent to the restaurant.) There were only about 5 tables for customers to sit along with 10 bar seatings.  Despite its limited capacity and outdated decor, there were a constant flow of customers.  Seemed like a popular local favorite. Place was noisy and it was hard to hear each other speak.  Good thing we were hungry for food and not conversation. The sushi was decent.  The salmon and tuna were delicious but the yellowtail seemed frozen.  Tempura shrimp & veggies were good along with the miso soup. The menu had a lot to choose from which included CREPES. This item seemed odd to us since this is not a typical option we see at other Japanese restaurants we frequent.  Heard the servers say to other customers (and us as well ) that they had ran out of a certain item on the menu.  For all you can eat option, we were not surprised.  The wait for our food was long but they gave us dilled cucumbers for appetizers to hold us over.  Good place to stop if you are craving sushi because there are not many other sushi restaurants to choose from in this town."}, {"review_id": "lTqFE-AJQcu393Ca8Pcq5A", "user_id": "mInYIQ3KszR0WZA0UHekwg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "BEST sushi in town and they deliver!

Poor service. Just Drove all the there to pick up my to go order only to find out their machine isn't working for card. They wanted me to go inside to take money from the ATM when all I brought was my credit card. When I explained that it's ridiculous for me to have to go inside and pay fee's because it's not my fault they didn't do anything to help. I just drove there and wasted my time.

First off, I don't understand why there aren't more reviews for this location. It's super busy, has a drive-through.Negatives are that it IS a small location, limited parking and seating. But WORTH the wait.for all you can eat follow the rules. I'm posting a picture of their menu taken on 1/14/2018.Portland doesn't have any good sushi, and if it does it's Super expensive, so just a drive down south or up from the coast to Salem on the I-5 is worth the drive.

It's literally a hole in a way kind of place, located in a dark and small complex. However, once you step inside it is well lit, clean, and intimate. Woah! It is also a drive through sushi joint?! That's way cool  I've never been to a sushi place with a drive through option. Service: 5/5 fast, prompt, friendly. Price range: 5/5 (we came during happy hour 5pm-8pm so the nigiris orders are only $2.68/ea) AYCE Price range: $$ Pricier than most of the places I've been to (it is $27.98/person) I personally would not opt in for this Sunomono Salad: 4/5 nice crunch, refreshing, different from the ones I've had! Seashell roll: 4/5 refreshing, fish quality are fresh, good texture + taste to rice, wish they went easier on the rice  Ika nigiri: 5/5 well seasoned, I like this! Hamachi nigiri: 5/5 pretty good for the price rangeSake nigiri: 5/5 not fishy at all Spicy scallop nigiri: 5/5 nice kick of spice, scallop tasted freshIkura sushi: 4/5 a bit too salty Ahi Poke: 4/5 a little light on the seasoning, not fishy at all Overall, I like this place! However I'll keep in mind to ask to go a little easier on the rice for the rolls + nigiri. The rice quality is really good too btw, don't get me wrong. Wished they had uni on the menu though!"}, {"review_id": "ox44XCFkRB5IR8i_NGFD4Q", "user_id": "fxUn9wMgttCCevpy36L3-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/13/2017", "text": "OH MAH GAWD their sushi is amazing. Also-probably the best hole in the wall place I have ever been to. The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, and is on a dark lit street if driving around at night. But it's well worth it! They have an assortment of great sushi rolls, tempura, sashimi, CREPES (yes I said that right), and also do an unlimited sushi option for $25, that basically covers the entire menu. I've done that multiple times and it's always worth the money. Also helpful things to note: they do to go, they can substitute things in their rolls, they have a lunch special, and special deals if you follow their Facebook. They do deliver in the area, and have a drive thru! Free miso when you ask for it, they do serve some alcoholic drinks, and Jeff, a sushi chef there, is an awesome guy. It's helpful to also know that there are multiple Momijis in Salem - and they are not all the same franchise! Don't make that mistake of going somewhere else and settling. Make the trip out here."}, {"review_id": "0MoFUjcWePXkZej0uB0pIg", "user_id": "Zh1AnW8FB9pi99gDgWUUvw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/2/2017", "text": "Why do I keep going back to Sushi over and over again? Because of places like this. So good! I've driven past this place my whole life, and finally decided to give it a go. From the outside, you don't expect much, but upon entrance into the business, you're wowed. I kinda liked that surprise. Mysterious. Anyway, our waitress was super friendly and helpful (gave us some really solid suggestions), the fish was fresh (always a trait you want when eating raw), and the whole experience was just legit! I would have liked the edamame we ordered to come out a bit earlier, but that's no big deal really. Next time I think I'll try a crepe for dessert!

I live 2 blocks from the South Momiji's and I drive to the Silverton Road one, that should tell you something, if not, Google Map it. This place is definitely a dive in the best way possible, as with most dives, the biggest downside would be the limited seating which makes it a good place for 1-4 people, more than that and it's probably not going to work,  unless the sushi bar is totally empty and you can all sit there(not likely), but they also do takeout, delivery, and drive thru as well, so those are good options.   We typically come here as often as possible for the last 5yrs. Though obviously that's not all of the time, money constraints lol. I have never had a bad experience at Silverton Road, which is saying a lot for a place this small, and a place I frequent, the only other pace I consistently have had great service at in town(I grew up here) is 'White's' or the 'Kondetori' , and those are old diners, totally different. I eat sushi all over the US, anywhere that I go, and I travel a lot, I haven't been to a place that has as consistent service, great food on the whole, and has a good overall feel to the place, outside of 'Oregano's', which is an Arizona Pizza Bistro chain. Momiji's Silverton Road also typically have good deals throughout the week, they  also have 'All You Can Eat Sushi', if you have 2 or more in your party, and the rules are reasonable, you must finish 75% of your food before ordering another round(there are a couple more as well, pay attention). I recommend, if you want to try a lot of stuff on the menu, and you're very hungry, it's a good option. Otherwise, there are usually good specials, and on the whole the menu is very well-balanced price-wise.  I have tried a majority of the rolls on the menu, and while I may not like everything, it's a matter of personal taste, not quality. Momiji's is well known for their ' Salem Roll' they're the original, but I'm just not a cream cheese person, everyone else I know loves it, and their's is, by far the best of all the other Salem sushi bar versions I've tried.  My personal favorite rolls are 'Ocean Bounty' because it really is just a sea food roll and I love sea food, 'Spinal Tap' it is, to be the best balanced fried roll out there and I'm not a huge fan of fried rolls, and 'The Double Sexy' for its overall balance of flavors. The avocado boat and sushi tower are also two of my favorite things to get outside of regular sushi. It is also worth mentioning that they will do low rice on any roll you order if you ask, that's not something I can think of any other sushi bar doing, its a nice option to have. While every visit may not be stellar(a visit a couple of months ago had an unreasonable wait time for food after we ordered, but that has only happened that one time), it is never mediocre, the food is always great, the ambience is good, and the staff are usually friendly and helpful. If you don't mind little 'hole in the wall's type places with cramped quarters, and you like good sushi, I see no reason to not come here. Otherwise, you may want to steer clear if you're claustrophobic(though I was highly claustrophobic and was okay).

Or even all the way up to Portland. We have never been disappointed.The restaurant is very small, so large parties are a no go! They have a drive thru which is pretty awesome. The parking lot is fairly small, so you may have to park across the street. We have had to wait about 3 out of 5 times we've been, but every time it has been worth it. We've never had to wait longer than maybe 20 minutes because they're pretty quick in getting out the sushi.The menu is full of lots of roll options - you've got your basic rolls, semi special rolls, and really special rolls. They've got rolls made with soy paper so you have the option to sub the regular rolls for it. They're very friendly about substitutions! If you ask at the bar, they'll make suggestions or new rolls even for you. The sushi tower and chicken katsu are good... And the crepes are really good too! Salem Roll, Volcano, and so so many more are amazing.  The pricing isn't bad - obviously if you get all special rolls it can get pricey but it's not too bad.We moved to Wilsonville but still make the drive to get this awesome Sushi!
