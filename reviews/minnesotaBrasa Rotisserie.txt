Seriously good! With my dad's recipe of mayo and salsa as a garnish. Amaze! Get the creamed spinach and red beans and rice (not what I would normally order, but surprisingly wonderful). The brisket!!!! I got the feeling that most everything is good here. My greens were bitter, is my only criticism.Let's talk about the catfish for a moment! Consistently flakey and moist and crispy, OMG I cannot believe how delicious this is! My favorite thing about the catfish is the sauce. My dad used to have catfish fries every Sunday in Texas and he would mix salsa and mayo. This sauce made me feel like I invented it. Bravo! Love all around and I will continue to support this business. In fact, a good friend of mine is having Brasa cater her wedding."}, {"review_id": "rjvR62H7tB0FdXFa6wav2A", "user_id": "ifBTJB2BPa3bu_k1OUoU6Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Service was slow on at Friday night, and portions are small given the price.Large guacamole needed more chips.

That's the good news. The bad news is until just recently we haven't been here for at least a year or more. There are so many great places to eat here in the Cities. Brasa is one of the best!If you haven't already heard, the rotisserie chicken here at Brasa is the best in MN. Maybe the best anywhere. It is just excellent! The dry rub is Full of flavor! We usually order way too much when we get food from Brasa but it is always so good. The surprise to us this time is the smoked beef. My wife who usually does not eat a lot of beef was totally not sharing! So yes I acted like a spoiled kid and complained. :) The smoked beef was smoky, sweet and a little spicy and really melt in your mouth tender. We also had beans and rice which was as good or better than you will find in the south. The spicy corn masa cakes while are not that spicy are crispy and delicious! The guacamole is fresh and as good as you would find at any Mexican restaurant. I had forgotten about the green cilantro type sauce that they service with their chicken. Not only did I dip my chicken in this, yes I ate it with a spoon too. Over the years we have tried some different items like their sandwiches and bowls, everything has always been fantastic! While about 99% of the time we get food to go, the one time we ate in we noticed that there were some specials that were not on the menu. Ribs were being made that time.While Brasa is not the least expensive meal you will have, considering the quality and decent amount of food, in our opinion it is well worth it. It was so good and nice to know that they consistently provide great food. We'll be back sooner than later next time!"}, {"review_id": "x4_Cn58Kd_eYIXfz4FX1lQ", "user_id": "LgfYQDegm0ruOsE04Lnnig", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "We made it 20min before close but they were still willing to serve us which was cool, I know how it is when you're about to close and a customer walks in. (Cmon most of us know the feeling) our waitress was super quick and obviously had a great memory because she didn't need to write down our order. Food came out quick - delicious. My favorite thing honestly is the YUCA - yum yum yum! Rice, beans and Mac n cheese were super tastey. I should go more often just for the yuca, If you haven't had it you must try it here."}, {"review_id": "8o-tw0K4JshmtvRKET1nWA", "user_id": "kFtpOzWygqAENd6oKrkefw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/23/2017", "text": "I traveled to the Midwest to eat a satisfying Caribbean meal, go figure! Serving mouthwatering dishes like SLOW ROASTED PORK seasoned with garlic and citrus mojo as well as PULLED CHICKEN doused in a delicious gravy, straight up comfort food would be exactly what you can expect from this place. We started with PLANTAINS and their amazing YUCA FRIES that once dipped in the magical green sauce, you'll swear by it and probably smother anything and everything in it. Seriously, it would be a crime not to bottle and sell that dip. When the aforementioned meats came which we ordered in ¼ and  1/2 lb respectively, so did the sides. Their CREAMED SPINACH won me over in its hint of spice and a pleasant twist of it being in a light watery sauce vs the heavy cream I am accustomed to. The Asian in me who eats rice almost daily loved the YELLOW RICE & BEANS which paired well with the pulled chicken and roasted pork. I thought the CATFISH was alright but that MASA CAKE though...I dig it.As cold as the climate is over here, the warmth from the staff and their fantastic local brews we got on tap were enough to keep us toasty and comfortable as we dined here. A solid choice for our first restaurant stop in the Twin Cities, I'd say."}, {"review_id": "_Yp7kDW2D7nQ30KuplkJ4A", "user_id": "LKd5fN25pspDpo_LZFA_iA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "After eyeballing this place for a while, I found the food was pretty good but perhaps not worth the price for me. We tried the pulled chicken plate (pulled chicken with light cream & pepper gravy), sweet corn cornbread, side of Mac & cheese, side of romaine & fresh mozzarella salad, and the side of brown sugar candied yams. The pulled chicken was good, but you only get about a cup of it and ours had a couple small bones in it. Not worth 11.95 if you ask me. The cheese sauce on the Mac & cheese was grainy, not a texture I prefer in sauces. The side salad was straightforward but unremarkable. We both agreed the brown sugar candied yams were a bit too sweet and too mushy for us - might be more appealing to bigger fans of yams (I'm impartial to them).What we liked: the sweet corn cornbread and the house made grape soda. We opted to buy the \"growler\" of grape soda to take home. I'm still enjoying the soda today. (They also had a house made pineapple ginger soda if you're curious). Kudos to the employee, Thor, who made the soda!The environment is very open, you can even see back into the kitchen when you walk in. It made the ambiance a bit loud, like being in a sports bar. The presentation of the plated food was very no-frills (as you can see in the pictures) - I'm told this is part of the style of being \"down south\" and supposed to feel like you're eating southern mama's cooking. I'm setting the review at a 3 Star for now. I still want to try the rotisserie chicken plate, garlic toast, & scrambled egg & andouille sandwich.After all that, the bill for 2 people was over $37 without tip (not including $13 for the growler of house made soda)."}, {"review_id": "knnrHWn61vxt-GmO0nVTwQ", "user_id": "6eC3-_eRVoXRFAScfgZL6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/1/2017", "text": "Limited menu with their own take on Caribbean food. Not the traditional food I was expecting but flavorful nonetheless. We tried the pork and beef with the yellow rice and beans. Meats were well flavored, rice was a win, the beans were not the greatest. They had no flavor and it looked like semi-smashed whole beans so I'm unsure if it was overcooked or just refried beans. The grilled corn cake was like an arepa with the cheese on the outside on top. The candied yams were delicious as long as you're okay with the texture of soft mashed potatoes. They are not stingy with the sweet plantains which are my favorite! Seating is offered inside or out. We left smelling like smoke from the pit that was coming inside.Service was mediocre, never refilled our drinks and waited on the check.Would recommend and try again."}, {"review_id": "6DMSiwNAcIRHjmIKLQPxqA", "user_id": "IYTI876BCN2WaGnTyixgqA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/18/2017", "text": "I said I would be back and I was serious.

A MILLION times YES.  If you have not tried Brasa, you are missing out!QUICK TIP: Order the Yuca Fries, an extra side of the green sauce, the Pulled Pork and over easy egg bowl and a sangria. TRUST me, you'll thank me later. Brasa serves a combination of U.S. Caribbean and Mexican style foods. And I cannot stress it to you enough how bomb.com this place is. I take all of my out-of-state friends and family here and they get super jealous when I post it on snapchat. All the food taste great, but my favorite is the pulled pork. This place is trendy, the service is great and the atmosphere is chill. The parking lot is small, but its free and theres free street parking as well.

I don't mean to underestimate the restaurant with only a 3-star rating. They do what they do very well, and it's a great place for a group that wants to share a variety of things. Whenever I'm wandering up and down Grand Avenue, looking for a place to have dinner, Brasa is often the first place I'll try. In some ways, however, I'm underwhelmed by the lack of variety. Once you try Brasa, you'll know exactly how your next experience at Brasa will be, and the next one, and so on. I think the restaurant delivers extremely well on its concept, but I'd love to see it expand beyond the concept and challenge me to re-think how it delivers its experience."}, {"review_id": "KHZglOLBCl2868Y-hOOJag", "user_id": "nUVWQ2wWZw4fHAbw2Mi8Dg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "I've been wanting to come back since I first visited two years ago, and Brasa did not disappoint. Although we were initially told the wait would be an hour, it ended up being 20 minutes. We ordered family style and were STUFFED at the end. The chicken is amazing, so is the cornbread, and the regular sides were good as well. The yuca is one of my favorites along with chicken, but the sauce that accompanies everything is literally my favorite sauce. I think it was cilantro lime mojo? Something along those lines. The barbecue sauce was exceptional as well."}, {"review_id": "9ohpSZVfabKWewObYDLXug", "user_id": "1nPWKDDP-cCCPf6KY5V5Pw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/7/2017", "text": "Never change, Brasa!This was the first place we went to on a recent trip to Minneapolis. Twice in two days, actually (second time to the St. Paul location), as we had a British friend in town who wanted to eat something healthy and delicious.Go here especially if you have a group of people so you can order family style - get 1/2lb of meat per person, and many sides. The best are the pulled pork, pulled beef, and pulled chicken, but others (and specials are usually on-point, too). Make sure you get the yucca fries, sweet plantains, sautéed greens, and any other sides that float your boat. Finally, desserts are good enough (not amazing, but they don't need to be); the butterscotch pudding is utilitarian but does the job nicely to cap the mea.Ancestral/primal/paleo?

I was with my husband and cousin. The food is served family style. The pulled BBQ beef was tender and delicious. It was my favorite meat. I'm allergic to catfish but had to try a little taste because everyone kept raving about it. Heck, I didn't want to be left out. It was worth the Benadryl I had to take, too! The rice and beans, mac & cheese and collard greens with smoked chicken were down home like your grandmother made it good! I ordered a glass of red wine and was disappointed that my stomach got full so quickly! I wasn't crazy about the apple crisp dessert, though. Regarding the atmosphere, it was busy and it was Saturday night. The restaurant isn't very big so voices carried. The noise level was really high. I had a tough time engaging in a casual conversation. I'd prefer if the atmosphere was a bit more relaxed. We waited for a table for about an hour. I'm not sure if they take reservations, so you may wish to check before going. It's probably not as busy during the weekdays, but I'm an out-of-towner and have no idea if this is true.
