We could not finish our food, and should have packed the leftovers to go. Don't be shy about it, we saw several tables doggy-bagged their leftovers. I could not decide between the Queen combo (because it had corn beef hash) and the chicken and waffle and the Irish benedict (again corn beef hash). In the end I had the Irish benedict. It came with 3 eggs! Most of the dishes came with 3 eggs - just too much for me in one sitting. The Irish benedict was really good, eggs were poached perfectly with runny (but not too runny) yolks. The home fries (like hash browns) were also good and the corn beef hash was yums.My friends had the pancake combo which was one of the few dishes with 2 eggs. The pancakes were fluffy and looked like those you see in commercials or ads. I tried the blueberry pancake which was so good. The place was crowded when we got in but the wait was not too long for us, maybe around 10 minutes. Take your check and pay at the counter near the door. The experience was all good until payment time. The guy manning it (probably the owner) was a bit rude. He tried to stereotype us and kept guessing where I was from and being totally wrong. He did not look happy when I said to add 15% tip to the bill and kinda forced us to increase it to a round number. I thought that was quite uncalled for. Then again \"Welcome to America\"."}, {"review_id": "TrycvL4XRYw38O5ch1uhsg", "user_id": "GdSElCd8doJp1faBCcwi0g", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Have been frequenting this establishment since 2010, and for the first time, my party of four decided to stage a wall out because our sever, Nick, turned out to be extremely racist.We were seated at the booth at 1 PM by the hostess. The server came to our booth at around 1:10 PM. We ordered and he went away and he came back with my coffee. The next time he stopped by our table was around 1:30 PM and said he is going to bring us water and our shakes. 5 minutes later he came back with the water.After 10 more minutes, we gestured at him about our shakes and our food and he comes to our table and says - \"Guys, I treat all people the same way\". We informed him that we had a pregnant lady with us and we have been waiting for 50 minutes for our food. We got up to walk out and we see him making the milkshakes.We complained to the manager. Brownstone staff has always been friendly, so this was a very frustrating experience.I hope the management takes some disciplinary action against the server for his blatant racist comments."}, {"review_id": "-YkjUvMll7XWzr-3MugrFQ", "user_id": "tMOjPiFpn47o7vOZsBZF1w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Service is fantastic!

They have parking here but most of the time it is full. This time was no different and so we had to find street parking.  There was still a wait when we left around 1pm!Now for the food... I ordered the chicken and waffles and my wife ordered the blueberry pancakes.The chicken and waffles were on point! The chicken came on the bone which is the classic way of doing it and it was great. The coating of the chicken was crispy/salty while the meat was juicy. This could have been good on its own. The waffle was on a drier side but still pretty good. They went very well togeher. Solid dish.We heard the pancakes were what they are known for (hence the name) so had to try. So many options for pancakes but went with blueberry. There were very good. They were on the sweeter side and tasted a little like desert rather than breakfast!Overall, this was one of the better diner experiences we have had. Solid solid diner and it warrants a 4 star rating."}, {"review_id": "z87B-G5XCFW4IpPvU6lg5Q", "user_id": "lkErq-I0zXd-JYsDgMT16A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "I usually stay away from places with long lines/waits that have don't have food worth that wait.I've been in Jersey City for a couple of years & visited Brownstone a couple of times.Today, I went because it was rainy & Ihop was crowded.

On a Sunday afternoon, you can imagine that this diner was extremely packed. Despite that, the wait for two people was only about 15 minutes and it actually seemed as though we were seated faster than that. Upon seating, we were instantly greeted by a waitress who was seemed to have a lot going on. I felt like we were being very rushed to hurry and order. As you can imagine, like most diners, the menu is pretty extensive and takes some time to look through..whatevs. For our drink, we, of course, went with the fresh OJ and although I asked to check if there was OJ with pulp, our waiter only came back with regular OJ (without even saying if they had pulp OJ or not). For our meal, we ordered the old fashion pancakes, grits, western omelette, turkey bacon, eggs over medium and home fries. With all of that, I just felt as though everything was pretty mediocre.  I guess, based on the raving reviews, I was expecting to be blown away by portion sizes, taste, and everything else. I will say, I am willing to give this place another try because of the extensive menu. One thing that was amazing was def the pancakes.. super delicious and so fresh.

Luckily for me, I was visiting a friend just around the corner, so we were able to walk right over to the diner for breakfast.I'm a huge breakfast fan, and if you're like me, this menu will not disappoint you. Honestly, it was overwhelming, there's just too much to choose from! Eventually I decided that I just had to try myself one of the pancake rolls. Giant pancakes, rolled up and stuffed with eggs, sausage and cheese. Yes please!The pancakes are super soft and fluffy. I usually don't opt for a sweet breakfast, but since it was stuffed with a savory breakfast, I had to go for it. And, it was awesome! A giant portion too, which for me was exactly what I wanted.Our waitress was a super sweet lady, but the service knocked this down a little for me. We got coffee right when we sat down, and our food came quickly, but after that our server kind of disappeared. No coffee refills, no water, and the toast was left out of our meal. Since we couldn't hunt down our waitress, the toast ended up being a lost cause. She was really nice overall, but when I'm out at breakfast, I rely heavily on coffee/water refills.Worth checking out and trying the pancake rolls for sure, though!"}, {"review_id": "9qnaAkes2_ZehgWJlVzObQ", "user_id": "draIOch8l4nLsa6nXPgm7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Excellent diner style restaurant and food for those who would like to eat on the Jersey side of the river.

We told the server who then asked us if would like another replacements but we were quite off already and didn't want that. We didn't push for it also- we just wanted them to know that some ingredient is off the mark! Hopefully no one gets sick.

It was packed when we got there but we managed to get all 3 cars parked in the lot - people go in and out a lot. We had to wait a while for our party of 8 to be seated. They had some seating in the front to wait in but not much and it was very cramped. The owner and servers were very friendly, although our waitress was a bit forgetful. The food didn't take too long but we did see a table of 4 that arrived after us get their food first, which was annoying. Anyway, the food was amazing! Everyone got very different things but we were all so happy with the food - from eggs Benedict with grits, to coconut pancakes with turkey bacon, to breakfast sandwich and plain pancakes, to kids combos (Mickey shaped pancake and 1 egg), to French toast, to chicken and waffles - everyone was happy. I got the show stopper and a side of Home fries, both of which were perfect! Can not wait to return. It was all pretty reasonably priced - Only $112 for 8 people, with huge portions and everyone had leftovers to take home.A little annoyed they wouldn't split the check for us but it was very busy so that's understandable. We were able to use Venmo and I put the whole thing on my card.

The service is fast and efficient so they really get people in and out of there. One thing to note is that the booths are a bit on the tighter side -- we had 5 adults in there (2 on one side and 3 in the other) and I don't  doubt they'd try to seat 6 in there. We ordered a variety of pancakes, two eggs benedicts (original and lox) and two different pancake wraps (the original and cowboy). Everyone was really happy with what they ordered. The wraps are HUGE (see pictures) and each of the guys only ate about half of each. Pancakes were light and fluffy, not too sweet. The turkey bacon was basically tossed on a hot grill to get grill marks but otherwise not cooked so I'd pass on that next time. I was originally confused at why they charge for compote, but when they brought it out it nice and warm, it was a sizable portion...that we took home in a to go coffee cup....with the rest of our leftovers. Looking forward to going back to explore the rest of the menu! Two things to keep in mind, there is a parking lot, but it's overflowing on the weekends. Also they will not split checks so be prepared with cash or Venmo."}, {"review_id": "r0S_Tx3VkH4t7XSwzMZ-CA", "user_id": "Hg5J-w6M0aSVPh9duetNmg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/20/2017", "text": "I wish it was easier to get into this place!

Chicken and Waffles? Chicken and waffles.\"- Goku from Team Four StarSeriously though, this place has GREAT chicken and waffles. It's a low key diner in Jersey City serving a variety of food in large portions. They have fried things, pancakes/waffles, and even Greek food!Decided to start my vacation with chicken and waffles. The waffle is crispy and fluffy, and it doesn't get soggy quickly when syrup is poured over. Also portions are big - my cousin told me they only give you 2 pieces... instead we got 3 large pieces equivalent of half a chicken. The chicken was delicious, so moist and juicy, yet crispy on the inside. This ain't yo KFC.We also got the Greek sampler share - large dish for 4 people. I'm not experienced in Greek cuisine, but everything on that platter was delicious. Their spanakopita has a delicious flakey crust to compliment the savory filling. I also particularly liked the dolmades wrapped in grape leaves. Seemed like a really good vegetarian option!My relatives picked me up Saturday morning from EWR and we headed here for brunch. They have their own dedicated parking lot, which is pretty nice albeit small and difficult to find a spot when it's packed. Luckily folks were leaving and we only waited 15 minutes for a table. Service was friendly and attentive - also, in order to speed things up you pay at the front as you exit.After a 6 hr red-eye flight from SF, this was a great way to start my day on the east coast.

I took a bite of my tuna melt. It had been decent. But, it had a hair in it. A long nasty hair. I went to the manager to complain about the drinks and the hair. He had our drinks delivered right away.The manager graciously took the soda and coffee off the bill. Not the tuna melt. He reasoned that I had eaten the whole thing.

I try to frequent Brownstone as much as I can but I'll admit, their food is heavy so it's definitely a once a month kind-of deal for me. Typical diner atmosphere, you eat and then pay at the register. Servers are friendly and efficient, it helps with the table turnover process. AKA you'll be seated ASAP. Food portions here are large, to give you food coma. I personally don't think it's large enough to share but my Uber drive thought otherwise. Waffle combo is my fave here, the waffle comes with a side of butter, eggs (your way), three strips of bacon and sausage. Pancakes here are solid as well but I'm more of a waffle type of gal.
