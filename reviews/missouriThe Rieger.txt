We sat at tables near the kitchen and watched the staff prepare meals. It was very interesting to watch. Somehow we missed the dinner menu and only received an appetizer menu. I think it came with our seat locations. Probably had to make reservations to get a real table. We didn't complain because the meal size was just right for all of us. All our meals had some heat to them. Even Marie's ham and eggs. I didn't mind but she had to scrape the sauce off to eat it.  But the flavor was really good. See the photos for our orders. Dessert was a cherry we all shared.Water glasses were always full.

Went for valentines weekend dinner. They called a hour before and told us they screwed up our reservation. In the end they got us a table in the bar area. Annoying, but Im willing to overlook it.Then they failed to give me a scallop in my entre. Upon asking why there wasn't a scallop the manager immediately accused us of picking it out and eating it, then complaining. The manager, then slapped the bill down and said since \"it was our word against his\" that he took $6 off the bill - the value of the scallop.Why I'm I paying $30 bucks for an meal when its worth 6 bucks? also if it was also $6 then why not just give us another scallop?We weren't trying to get free stuff here, just wanted our meals to be right. It was shocking how immediately aggressive and rude the manager treated us. It made me feel like they were scamming us.

But I think that's the vibe they're going for. That aside, everything else here is incredible, including their drinks (Rieger G&T for the win!).  Highly recommended if you're anywhere near the area."}, {"review_id": "PmmbgKyZm2vEuhIpgLddBQ", "user_id": "g_w1eNmUMXjVcuekS5eKow", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Smoked goat and the pickled potatoes were awesome.

The atmosphere combined with the food is truly a great experience. Classic dishes with a great amount of detail.

There were many standout dishes (and apparently they change it up often), but here are my recommendations: *Half Butternut Squash, to share ($18): green mole, squash seeds, shallot, GDF fresh cheese. Beautiful presentation and tastes even better than it looks. People thought it looked like bone marrow at first (lol)... but it's actually vegetarian!*Seared Foie Gras ($15): parsnip, pear, fried walnuts, brioche, Espelette pepper.

Highly recommend.Next, the bison ragu filled tortelli. There were exactly 5 plated on a marinara-like sauce. I don't feel like it is enough food for a meal, but enough to share as an appetizer. The pasta comes al dente so be cognizant of that. I wasn't a huge fan. We tried our had at one of the shareable meals for the main course, and were glad we did. We got the Crispy Campo Lindo Chicken. It was a whole chicken, cornbread stuffing, and gravy. Excellent flavor. Dessert was just okay. Fried apple pie sounds amazing but it was basically phyllo dough with a few apples and a scoop of ice cream on top. Overall the reason for the 4/5 stars comes down to not having a desire to go back for awhile. While everything here was good, I didn't feel like it was unique to this restaurant. It was a good experience, a fun atmosphere, but the quality:price ratio isn't where I'd like it."}, {"review_id": "FxD79TpAk1wsIYMkDie7Gg", "user_id": "SWkVApZ67tSs4a3nI9BCgQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "So excited to try this place.

Overall, I thought this place was a great place to get a good meal and socialize! I ordered the cavatelli which was pasta with braised rabbit! The rabbit was cooked well but since it was shredded into the pasta dish, I couldn't get a good sense of how it tasted. (I've never had rabbit before). The only problem I had with my pasta was that the noodles were cooked al dente. I'm not a huge fan of al dente pasta, but otherwise the dish was delicious and I finished everything on my plate! A word of caution though: their pasta dishes are smaller portions. So, if you go here and you're starving, I would order the pasta and another dish! My friend also got the rabbit polpettine which I got to try a bite of. The rabbit meatballs were delicious! The rabbit was a lot meatier/gamier than chicken but still well cooked. The rabbit was also topped with a spicy marinara which complimented the rabbit well! The sauce wasn't overly spicy but had a good kick to it. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in KC! It is not my favorite, but the history of  The Reiger and the food make it a standout place in KC!"}, {"review_id": "74H_ch7ue_hNOobim1MfEw", "user_id": "62t-bPD25lY--mLXaLQslw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/11/2017", "text": "The Rieger was recommended to be by a friend, and I'm very glad it was. Overall, it was a great dining experience, and I would be happy to return.The bar is at the front of the restaurant, which creates a rather loud atmosphere. However, once I arrived at my table, the volume was much more pleasant. The lighting in the restaurant is dim and intimate, and each table has small candles to augment the soft lighting. The dress is classy yet not overly formal; this would be a good place for a nice date.The food, too, was very good. As cautioned by the waitress, the pastas are not large dishes. This was not a problem for me as I was not very hungry, but if you are, you'll probably want to order an appetizer as well. I ordered the risotto, and I was impressed. The peppers and onions were perhaps a bit too long, but they had great flavor and really added to the dish. The sausage, similarly, was firmer and more crumbly than I had expected, yet was still delicious. Overall, I'd recommend The Rieger to anyone looking for a nice meal and a nice atmosphere.PS- The cocktail lounge Manifesto sits in the \"basement\" of The Rieger.

The food itself is farm to table style and is remarkable.  Menu items change with the season, but you are always going to be satisfied.  We enjoyed the charcuterie board, pork soup, and walleye.  Everything is beautifully prepared, though most of the dishes are a bit small so keep that in mind when ordering. For drinks, there is a wide selection of wines and beers, but be sure to indulge in a house made cocktail with Rieger distilled spirits!My only disappointment was the lack of knowledge and hospitality from our server.  The menu can be a bit daunting and she wasn't able to tell us much about the food to clarify.  I'm sure other servers are more knowledgeable, or perhaps she was having a rough night.

Of course the restaurant had a wonderful aesthetic. It was a very warm, cozy space with dim lighting, though the noise level was a bit loud for my liking. Our party had 8 people so it is was a bit hard to talk to people at the other end of the table. But, our waitress was very helpful and went to both sides of our table to give us recommendations from the menu and to make sure that we could all hear her. I ordered the cavetelli, a small pasta dish with rabbit, bacon, corn, mushrooms, and basil. The rabbit was cooked wonderfully and blended well with the rest of the dish. The saltiness of the bacon contrasted the sweetness of the corn while the soft rabbit added a new texture to the firm pasta. Personally, I did not like the pasta cooked al dente though. I also happened to bite into a piece of bacon that was extremely hard. When I popped it out of my mouth, I found something whitish in color. I'm not quite sure what it was but it was way too hard to chew and left me a bit disgusted. Overall, the dish was just lacking flavor. It tasted quite plain to me, even with the rabbit, bacon, and corn. As mentioned by a few others, the pasta dishes are definitely a small portion. So, if you are anything like me and always have leftovers, this dish is the perfect size. Otherwise, I would suggest ordering something else to add more substance. Would I go here again? Probably not. The prices were a little too high for me to receive food I did not really enjoy."}, {"review_id": "AYcrwxPwNXjB0z_-GgvVHw", "user_id": "OfNyx0kb-g5FxjzGPnUvFg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Meh.

Chef Howard Hannah has a seasonal menu, so it changes almost entirely every three months, with a couple of standards always in place (e.g. pork soup.)One of the best things about the place is the kitchen view seating at the kitchen bar, which has about 6 seats, but there are normal tables, too. There is an intimate upstairs bar on the restaurant level, but also a (super secret trendy) intimate place downstairs that requires separate reservations. The booze is great.The food is better- think farm to table American season with named producers and precise execution. Lots of charcuterie, and their pasta courses really shine to me. Its not dainty at all, so expect good-sized portions of amazing flavorAt one time, I was so hooked on braised then grilled octopus served over a bed of hummus that I stole and shamelessly reused the idea with many types of protein. Now, I still do that, but I'm a a smidge ashamed.The restaurant itself is a little loud and seating is tightish, but not uncomfortable.I really love this place, and was reminded to write a review, because I am going to lobby my party to go there tonight.
