The Pad Thai noodles are the best I've ever had. Though a bit pricey. The Thai Tea is amazing. Try it.The crab Rangoon here is the best I've ever had -- they do it better than Chinese restaurants.The atmosphere is cozy and nice, but only a few tables can take more than 4. There's been a waiting line at times, and you'll notice the constant flow of take out -- it's that popular.The staff is friendly, although not nearly as as attentive as Bangkok pavilion Thai. Here rather than greetings up close -- you may get fingers pointing you where to sit from the bar. I don't think it's a disrespect, but a busy staff.

Food tastes great, it is authentic, and usually pretty fast. My only beef here is that the spice levels are inconsistent. I generally get my pad thai chicken anywhere between a mild plus and a medium, depending on how I am feeling that day (and if I am sharing with my wife, but that is beside the point.) Last time I was there, I got it medium and literally couldn't finish more than a third of it because it was so hot. It tasted good, don't get me wrong, but the heat was much spicier than previous times that I had gotten a medium.

I've previously been to Thai Place, so it's not my first rodeo.After a long morning of moving, we decided to eat lunch here. First thing I realized as we were walking, lunch specials are only during the week - lame. I don't know why restaurants do this - oh right, it's for profit. I mean, I guess charging full price on weekends is the best time to rake in the dough. Lunch specials are meant to drive people in, but it was rather disappointing to find out that they don't do them everyday of the week, and it doesn't say so anywhere on their website.The good news is that if you are paying full-price, you will get very large portions. The bad news is that you may end up at the awkward, \"Should I finish it or box it up to take home?\" stage. I ate enough to not really warrant leftovers, but I definitely didn't want to waste the food, so I ended up eating it all - probably not the best idea. I have gotten the Pad Thai and Pad See Ew here, and while I liked the Pad See Ew, I found the Pad Thai to be a little too sweet for me. Traditional Pad Thai isn't that sweet, which is what I am accustomed to. My fiance loves the Pad See Ew, and Thai Place is not his favorite KC-area Thai restaurant because is. He said, and I quote, \"It wasn't sweet.\" I think it is sweet, but it's not overwhelmingly so like the Pad Thai.We also ordered the Far East Trio, which is an assortment of Spring Rolls, Crab Rangoons, and Egg Rolls. The Spring Rolls don't come with peanut sauce, which was disappointing. I also found it was stuffed too much with the greens and not enough noodles and meat. The Crab Rangoons were actually surprisingly good. They were slightly sweet (not sweet enough, IMO), which is how I prefer them. Unfortunately, most restaurants in the area don't this, I've found. The Egg Rolls were okay, and I would not have gotten if I had to order them separately. The restaurant is fairly small, and it's fairly awkward if you're sitting in the center of the restaurant, as it's fairly cramped. Booths line the sides of the restaurant and are definitely the better seats in the house. Since I live so close now, I will likely be frequenting, but getting takeout only.Overall: 4/5Food: 4/5Service: 3/5Atmosphere: 2/5"}, {"review_id": "Ud3N4lndSBOfw3RivUDfHg", "user_id": "dSEKEGtyXZXofsCOPh42Xw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Amazing!

Literally, its just sauce. -menu is wrong. Here's a few tips: the chinese brocolli is kale, they put bacon in their pad thai without telling you, another unexpected and frankly very poor business practice, since many people can't eat bacon who would otherwise have pad thai, and no one is expecting bacon to be in that dish to begin with. -when they haven't executed a dish well, they disguise it with spice. If you ordered mild, too bad I guess-veggies are sometimes undercooked-Bankgonk Pavilion is way better-McDonald's is openJust my opinion. I've eaten here several times so I feel pretty confident in giving it a poor review. I really gave it a good chance. I tried several menu items. They just don't seem to care very much about the quality of their food.UPDATE: I am late for work on account of how sick the food made me the last time I hate there.

They also give you tremendous portions of food, which is always a plus for me. WARNING: the spice level at this restaurant is no joke. I usually order medium spice at other Thai restaurants, but I ordered it once here and I felt like I had an ulcer for the next day (and I have a pretty high spice tolerance).  The food however is delicious. I generally always get the pad Thai here, and it we'll balanced between sweet and savory. Not too sweet and the color looks natural here (so many other places I feel add coloring). I have to say though, I'm not a fan of their soups. I had the thom yum soup amd it was moderately unflavored and mostly broth. There's plenty of vegetarian options too.

We met at 5:30, and I'm glad we came early because this place definitely fills up in the evenings. I have traveled extensively around Thailand, so I consider myself a bit of a Thai food snob, and this place is a solid option. They didn't have my favorite dish, which is a street-food style spicy soup, but they did have a lot of other options. I typically go for a yellow curry if I'm really hungry, but prefer to choose fried rice if I want leftovers! My table all ordered different items so I was able to try a few curries, the pad thai, and my own yellow curry fried rice. The mild fried rice had zero spice, so I will probably order medium next time. My main con with this place is the price point. I feel it is about 3-4 dollars too high per menu item for what you get, compared to similar restaurants I have enjoyed in more expensive cities. I assumed this would be less expensive than my favorite Thai spot downtown, but I was wrong! Bottom line, I'll definitely come back if a friend suggests it, but if I am choosing Thai for dinner, I will choose elsewhere."}, {"review_id": "afpRPv-iz6bw41ODkiWW7g", "user_id": "CE-Fvm0BR_ytAYR356cgTg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "11/27/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Oh no!

The first not-so-great thing that happened was they didn't time our meals correctly and brought my hubby's entree out first. We were told mine would be out soon, but after a few minutes of waiting, I asked my hubby to start eating so his food wouldn't get cold. When my entree finally arrived, it was the wrong entree and it was served up with an extra special long black hair draped artfully across it. Yuck! They offered to remake my food, but by then, I had no appetite and the hubby was almost done with his food.After this experience, I am scratching them off my Thai restaurant list.

It's nestled in a little shopping complex down in Overland Park. They have excellent options from noodles to curry, truly something for everyone. We started with the Far East Trio. It comes with spring rolls, Crab Rangoon, and egg rolls. All three were great. The spring rolls were so fresh and had a surprising flavor that you don't get to until bite two. We had first written them off as so so but as we had the second piece they really became the surprise on the plate. When ordering entrees you can pick from a variety of spice levels which is something I greatly appreciate. I like a little bit of heat, but not so much you can't taste any of the flavors of the dish. I ordered chicken panang curry at mild plus. It comes in a bowl with a side of rice. It had a stronger peanut flavor than coconut milk flavor, but it was well balanced. It was the right spice level for me. Little heat and I still had all the flavors of the dish. The bell peppers were crisp and gave good texture to the dish. Gary ordered chicken pad Thai and he picked the hot level. He loved the dish, but it was definitely HOT. He drank so much water and his sinuses were definitely kicked into gear. I had a few bites of his, but couldn't get past the heat. We will definitely be back to try some of their other dishes. Great meal, fast service, very happy with our experience."}, {"review_id": "1u4zQZ-i-jKHnagwsItNHQ", "user_id": "UO6lLJ9GEEmWom-x5wHkEg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "food:our entree items (mussaman curry & beef grapow) were fantastic. like we assumed, mussaman curry was a sweet peanut sauce curry with chicken, potatoes, and other veggies. my friend selected 'mild'. i would add again, the sauce is distinctively sweet*. i personally loved it, and so did my friend. however, there are some of you who prefer savory, so this dish is not meant for you.i loved my beef kow nha lhad grapow. i asked for medium heat, thinking i can take the heat (let's calibrate for one minute. in my mind i think, 'kimchi heat' is not even a thing, but jalapeño peppers are definitely spicy), but the waitress advised well to recommend something between mild and medium heat! she brought sauce on the side in the case i wanted more kick. loved my dish! i enjoyed it bite by bite. i was going to select 'chicken', but asked about the more popular meat choice. it is usually either pork or beef, of which i changes my choice to beef. the minced beef sautéed in brown sauce was so satisfying, and i loved the sprigs of basil leaves mixed into the dish. the portion of my dish was very generous, great for famished reatauranters. my friend and i split the coconut shrimp appetizer. i am sorry to say i was not a fan of it. the battered shrimp tasted like it was fried in old oil (i am not* suggesting poor food hygiene, let the reader understand), and the bed of sweet potato tempura fries tasted undercooked. quite a bummer! i am sure it was only one of those one time, unfortunate experiences. i am open to give it another try!service: delightful, delightful staff! they were attentive, friendly, and quick to deliver. full house and, still, nothing less! know that you will be taken care of"}, {"review_id": "UlMRrGv0WaC1I33b-6R6sA", "user_id": "cZ4EJBoLQrOk_H7HAscECQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "I ordered the red curry with chicken, medium spicy.
