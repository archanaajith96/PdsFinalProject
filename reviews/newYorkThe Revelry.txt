Overall, this is one of the best restaurants and dining experiences you'll find in the Rochester area. The food, drinks, and service are all top notch; the Andouille Dogs appetizer is one of the best starters I've had in a while (and the purple mustard might be the best condiment I've ever had), and I don't like corn dogs. The sole reason I give it \"only\" four stars is because the restaurant is quite pricey. For a couple, you should expect to spend $100+, including tax and tip. For a non \"dressy\" restaurant like Morton's or the like located in Rochester, I wouldn't have expected to pay over $100 for a reasonable meal. $29 for fried chicken (albeit delicious fried chicken) with a side of carrots is a bit overpriced.Overall, highly recommended, but make sure to visit the ATM before you arrive!"}, {"review_id": "v6n60_BhlsjATBlBKEfRfw", "user_id": "z8qZwKtAo-cVf0zzA4wWuw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Service was fantastic. All servers and workers were so nice and respectful. The right-of-way was always to the customer and they were very apologetic and kind if they had to cross your path.My boyfriend ordered the Iron Smoke Cocktail and it was a mix of coffee and whiskey with a little cream on top. He said every sip tasted like a different ingredient and it was very boring/overpowering at the same time. Underwhelming at most. He also ordered the duck for his meal and it was extremely fatty and cold. The table next to us ordered the same dish and their duck had 1/4 of the fat on it as his.I ordered coffee to drink during my meal and it tasted like such bland, \"diner\" coffee. I also ordered the fried chicken dish that came with brussel sprouts and rosemary gravy. The rosemary gravy almost had a numbing sensation as I ate it and the brussels were unevenly cooked.I hate to give this place such a poor review because it was so beautiful and everyone was so friendly but overall,I expected more from The Revelry."}, {"review_id": "_X8SIDyygj5BObUAmBLPuQ", "user_id": "3Khr6shEQy1kz9nM5EXk-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "My girlfriend and I aren't from Rochester, but we like to venture out here from Buffalo once and awhile for day trips to explore a sister WNY city. We have been for brunch a few times to the area, but The Revelry is the only one we have returned to so far. And, it certainly won't be the last visit.The cocktail game is strong with a variety of palette pleasing elixirs that are undeniably unique. But, if that's not your thing, the full bar offers all the classic standbys, with modern, elegant twists. I opted for the Mountain Goat (rum, cascara tea, cocoa-infused honey, and lemon), while my partner got the East Ender (gin, lime, sugar, cucumber, and mint). The food was also fantastic. On our last visit, I had the shrimp and grits, which was wonderful. This time, the chicken and waffle caught my eye, and let me tell you, I have had a few chicken and waffles in my day, and these ones were up there with some of the best I've had. The perfect combination of salty/savory and sweet. My girlfriend got the brunch burger, which was perfectly cooked (she has a difficult time having burgers cooked the way she'd like) served with just as perfectly done fries.All this on top of a homey atmosphere, a modern style with classic flair, make this brunch spot a feast for both the mouth and the eyes. We will return!"}, {"review_id": "ed3szL-jE66Atf3wrkR-Bw", "user_id": "PH02kJ4nz7DuHJSR9JcrzQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "This place is a favorite of mine. Their drinks are great and made with very fresh ingredients. I got the Vega, which was made with a berry purée. We got cheddar biscuits and deviled eggs as appetizers. The biscuits were delicious, and came with two delectable spreads--one was a pimento cheese, while the other was a sweeter one. The deviled eggs are made with beet, which I think complements them nicely. They were a tad bit heavy on the mustard though. For dinner I had the lobster, which was very buttery and cooked to perfection. It came with greens and a type of ravioli and the flavors all complemented each other very nicely. The whole meal was a tad bit small, so if you do not fill easily, I would get something in addition to the lobster. Luckily I get full very easily and was satisfied. My friends had the fried chicken, which was a huge portion--they basically give you half of a chicken. The chicken was seasoned to perfection. Very good service.

I liked how when you walked in they had a glass floor so you could see the wine below. The drinks here are very good. I got two; one I forget the name a French something. It was a number following but I forget. It was pretty good. I then got a French 75 as my second drink. This is gin and champagne with lemon-probably my favorite cocktail. I was super excited they had it here and really enjoyed it. The cocktails are pricy here but I was expected this as it was more of an upscale restaurant. I tried a deviled egg and it was good. I was at first scared because it  has beets infused into the white part but the taste of it wasn't overpowering. I then had some oysters from the sea food platter that my brother in law ordered. The west coast oysters were awesome! The east coast oysters tasted too much like the sea for me. I'm more into less fishy tasting seafood so the west coast oysters hit the spot for me. I got the burger as my main course. Since it was an $18 burger I expected more. I felt like this burger tasted the same as a $10 burger. I felt like the quality of meat could have been better. Our waitress was nice and attentive. When we got the bill we noticed that they gave my brother in law the large sea food tray when he thought he ordered the small. Probably a miscommunication but he didn't mind too much as this was his favorite part of the meal. They also charged them $20 for bringing in alcohol. They didn't mention they would do this and felt when they saw alcohol from elsewhere first told them before just adding it to the bill.Overall the drinks and west coast oysters were great-don't get the burger."}, {"review_id": "kdRUm1zjg8APEwHFZ-8qtg", "user_id": "SDQHrOZ1lhOgV8BYzuNTNQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This is easily one of the best places in Rochester. The dishes are creative and unique, the service is top notch, and the style and decor is gorgeous. They serve dinner and Sunday Brunch, both of which are worth a visit.Food: The food is mostly southern-inspired (think: oysters, fried chicken, cornbread), but with a unique twist. From this, you get things like beet deviled eggs, parsnip hush puppies, or creamed corn with jalapeño cream cheese. They consistently have new specials, and the specials are often better than the regular menu items, so you are bound to find food worth its salt. Go for their raw oysters, deviled eggs, frog legs, and quiche.Location: This place is located in an old brick building in an area of the Neighborhood of the Arts that is really growing. Within walking distance, you can find Muller's Cider House and Radio Social (bowling), so you could easily spend a day of fun in the area. The inside of the building looks as if a New York-style warehouse loft and an old-money New Orleans villa had a baby - it is modern and old fashioned and beautiful. With the open space, though, it can get fairly loud - so if you are looking for a quieter area, see if you can get a seat at the back of the second floor, where glass wall panels block some of the sound.Drinks: The bar is a very popular place to be after 5pm and they are known for unique cocktails. These are again mostly Southern-inspired so you won't find similar drinks most other places in Rochester. Go for their wine, beer, or cocktails and you will be hard-pressed to find a bad drink."}, {"review_id": "g7z8pThYQIAn9AV1j8FavQ", "user_id": "V6R0djDaUBqSDEXPhEI6eg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/1/2017", "text": "In my opinion the bar is the main attraction at the establishment. Artisanal cocktails and affordable wine list make this a great place to gather for socializing with friends and other patrons. When I visit Rochester, I will often stop in for a beverage. The food reminds me of a gastropub that is at an experimental phase. Ingredients overwhelming each other. Flavors not perfectly balanced and fighting on your palate to be recognized. Employees here are quite friendly and attentive. A good experience but the menu or ingredients needs to be revamped."}, {"review_id": "V_FqdF9NqU5iMuSQ-s4kKw", "user_id": "bhsK4UvQwqr3bj_PBXEK_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "Wow, an absolutely perfect meal. I cannot recommend dining at The Revelry enough!My dad and I came here for a celebratory dinner, and every course was exceptional. We started with a bottle of the Carmel Road Pinot Noir, and the wine was the most enjoyable red that I have ever tasted. Personally, I am not the biggest wine person, nor do I know much about matching with foods, so take this with a grain of salt, but I would highly suggest this wine to people who are interested in getting more into reds, like myself. The Carmel Road wasn't very dry and definitely had a sweet streak; however, I certainly would not classify this as a super sweet wine. For an appetizer, I tried one of each of the oysters they currently had at the raw bar: British Columbia, Rhode Island, and Maine, as well as the chilled lobster tail. The lobster was juicy, and the Old Bay-spiced butter was delicious; you can never go wrong with lobster. The oysters were nicely chilled and sufficiently meaty. They were so good that I ordered an additional quartet of the East coast oysters. The raw bar had run out of the RI oysters at this time and had begun serving oysters from Prince Edward Island, and I am happy to say that the PEI oysters were probably even better than their predecessors. Definitely the place to come for an excellent raw bar. For our entrees, my father ordered the Alaskan Halibut, and it was phenomenal. The only fish that have even come close to this delicious were swordfish, Chilean sea bass, and grouper. An absolute must-have for anyone that enjoys fish, especially if you are a huge swordfish fan. With that being said, my entree was also fantastic and comes highly recommended: massive seared scallops in a thick buttery broth with diced squash, dark potatoes, and littleneck clams. I don't think I've ever name-dropped my waiter before, but our server, Nate, was stupendous: gave us time with menu, did not overly check up, struck up solid conversation, validated our wine selection, never once made us feel rushed, and brought out a complimentary birthday dessert (the special: Apple mousse with custard that was topped with a nut tart - don't even bother ordering another dessert). The meal would not have been such a top-tier experience without his service. Do yourself a monstrous favor and check out The Revelry, one of the best restaurants in Rochester.

We also had the deviled eggs (pretty sure every other table ordered them too lol) and cornbread for appetizers. Both were good but the cornbread was a definite standout.

As always, every expectation was met. I would like to note, every time we've gone, the service and hospitality have been at its highest. Everything from the location, to the décor, the quality of food, and presentation have been spot on. Started off with a couple east coast and west coast oysters. These were very tasty, and no need for cocktail or vinegar. For appetizers, we also started with the cheddar biscuits which were great. Very light and airy. For mains, I opted for the Aukra Salmon. This has got to be one of the best salmon dishes I've ever had. All the flavours worked brilliantly, and the salmon itself was moist, and poached perfectly. An amazing dish, and absolutely delicious. For dessert, we ordered the flourless chocolate cake and red velvet cake. Both not too overly sweet, and a great way to end our meal. I want to give recognition to our server 'Sasha.' A genuine and very kind person who made the already great experience even better. Definitely recommend. 10/10"}, {"review_id": "sKj3nB1NvSKtSPGvc3IX_Q", "user_id": "Oxds7I97cKoHP0KlFnZ3Xg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/12/2017", "text": "Fantastic time at this place!

It was my first time here. It was a really great experience. The ambience of the restaurant was southern and put together beautifully. The service was really great even though the place was super busy at the time. For three people, we ordered the seafood tower in platter portion, the bigger portion of gumbo, crab croquettes, brussel sprouts, and a crème brulee. That was way enough for the three of us and we even had leftovers. Below is what I thought about each dish:  The seafood tower was one of the standouts of our meal. It included oysters, shrimp, snow crabs, and a lobster tail.  Everything was really fresh, and truly delicious. It came with three sauces which is great for someone like me who likes sauces.  The crab croquettes were another highlight. It was fried just the right amount, and the crab was really fresh. I also enjoyed the sauce on top of the croquette with seasoning on the bottom of the plate. It all paired well together. The brussel sprouts were really great, as well. I could be partial because I love brussel sprouts but they were perfectly roasted, and the flavors were wonderful. It also included some carrot pieces and sausages in the dish.  The gumbo was probably the most disappointing of the meal. It was good but for someone who has been to the south before and had real gumbo, it was not as flavorful as I have had. In essence, it tasted like creamy tomato sauce with rice. I also wish there was more okra in the dish. The one positive was that a lot of shrimp was included in the dish. For drinks, Mr. Mule and the East Ender were both ordered and they were both delicious. Mr. Mule was a Moscow mule and the East Ender was similar to a mojito. They offer a wide variety of drink choices and the bartenders know exactly what they're doing! Yum! Last, it was also my sister's birthday so we ordered the crème brulee. It was also made deliciously. The top was torched perfectly and the custard was not too watery. All in all, it was a great experience and I would definitely come again."}, {"review_id": "tn6oCtSr05OlLdRvzjnqaw", "user_id": "Qyt2kxARsCAvZdB0nE3bVw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "11/16/2017", "text": "I have experienced better at The Revelry back about a year ago.

A starter salad one of us ordered came at about 6:30 and then nothing for another 40 minutes.
