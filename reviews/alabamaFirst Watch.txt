I however am going to try to base my review as if I've never eaten at a First Watch before. I am from Chattanooga Tn and First Watch is in our top 5 places to eat. It is phenomenal...in Chattanooga! We were traveling home from Florida and stayed in Montgomery to cut our trip shorter and when I got up this morning, searched on yelp for close by places for breakfast and was ecstatic there was a First Watch. Without hesitation heard that way. Here's my experience:Upon entering the building, there's no host, only a hosts stand.. we don't care about that until we continued to wait for 5-7 minutes before a server came to seat us. She wasn't rude, but wasn't friendly either. Just blah.. \"Two??...\" grabs menus, walks us to a table and says she will be with us in a minute. She didn't offer coffee or any beverages. There's 3 occupied tables in the building, it's 9:45 am yet the team doesn't seem set up. We wait quite a while and she comes back and ask if we want coffee, we say yes and she starts to walk away and I say, \"we'd like to go ahead and order please.\" She seemed annoyed, but turned back to us and said in a drawn out \"oooohkay..\" I ordered the avocado toast with a slice of gruyere cheese, side of bacon. Her entire demeanor while taking our order was a demeanor of annoyance, like we were bothering her. She treated me like my order was complicated. Have you not ever heard of upsale??? The higher your ticket price is (especially when a dang piece of cheese is 1.49, and bacon is 4.00+!!!!) the higher your tip is! But I guess when you're obviously annoyed serving your guest the ticket and tip amount just isn't a concern, right?? Anyways, she seemed annoyed with the ordering of cheese, asking me where I wanted the cheese and wanted to \"explain to me how it comes..\" I replied, I know how it comes, I eat it nearly once a week.. I told her I wanted the cheese melted on the eggs, \"well how do you want your eggs?? Basted?\" I replied, over medium please. I don't eat the bread, I just eat the avocado, eggs, cheese and bacon. When my meal came the cheese was melted on the bread, topped with the avocado. I'm very easy so I didn't say anything and peeled the cold (bc when you add cold avocado to hot cheese it doesn't make it melted cheese anymore‍) cheese off of the bread and placed the slices on my hot eggs hoping it would remelt it some. It didn't. The meal was delicious, even with the not melted cheese... same yummy coffee.. oh let's get to that part... when we sat down and she brought our coffee, there was no other creamer available but hazelnut, and there was no silverware rolled so we didn't have a spoon. We didn't see our server anywhere so I got up and robbed other tables of their creamers and tried to find a spoon, to no avail. I finally saw another server bring out a handful of rolled silverware and placed at the host stand, I got up and went and got silverware. Our server only returned once to ask if we wanted coffee to go (thank you, that was appreciated!) she then returned with to go cups and our check. The food was spot on and delicious. Our service experience was beyond lacking. I feel at 9:45 on a Monday morning with very few quest, it shouldn't be hard to hit customer service! I personally couldn't care less if my food was awful and they completely screwed everything up if my server was nice... finding staff that offers that should be key!"}, {"review_id": "LyyyEWLValeuRmFqGu2bQA", "user_id": "sZo-AQkZgrcBjYKFlfB5nQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "You know the feeling of being on the road for too long and needing families comfort food? That's what we needed today. Started driving from VA yesterday, and after all that driving, early am breakfast at First watch was just what we needed! The place had just opened for the day - service was quick and very friendly. I had  the smashed ava Adi toast ( asked for a single egg, but got 2). Very yummy. The chickichanga was delicious too, as were the fried potatoes. We also shared the carrot pancake - love it in the va locations, here it wasn't very successful. A few stringy pieces of carrots in an overdone pancake, zero flavor! Only reason I docked a star.Otherwise, the place made me very happy. We left very energizes for the remainder of our trip to Baton Rouge."}, {"review_id": "dou_xS2kBomnYtyMc9cnKA", "user_id": "afapBXYTOu34mw_ZFbJd3w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Solid brunch spot in Montgomery.Food: lots of options, particularly breakfast foods.

I ventured for a late breakfast and arrived around 1030. They were pretty busy, but since I was alone I was seated immediately. It took well over 5 minutes for a waitress to even come by to take a drink order. Meanwhile other tables were being seated around me and had their orders taken before I could even tell them what I wanted to drink.When she finally came over I asked what teas they had available since the menu just says \"herbal tea.\" She had no idea and looked dumbfounded that I would even ask. She instead brought me a box that she said had everything in it that they had-- a hibiscus flavored tea, green tea, orange tea, and a chamomile. Umm...no English Breakfast? No Earl Grey? Okay.....She took another 10 minutes before she came back to take my order, at which time she brought my tea cup, hot water, etc. I immediately noticed that the lemon that was already put in my glass of water and the lemon on the plate for my hot tea was rotting. She also brought a \"clean\" tall glass for some reason and left it at the table. It was so cloudy with water spots, dried food and LEFTOVER LIPSTICK/CHAPSTICK from the previous user. You've got to be kidding me. My food arrived after literally every other table in the room had gotten theirs (mind you they all arrived after me and I was the only single party there). My eggs were cold, the toast wasn't even toasted- just a bland slice of bread, and the potatoes were so overcooked they were complete mush that you couldn't stab with a fork no matter how hard you tried. They were over-seasoned and in some places burned, so their flavor was terrible! Efficiency is also clearly not their strong suit as every table that I watched with 2+ people would all get their food at different times. One table had a guest who was completely done with her meal before the guy she was with even got part of his. If I'm eating at a restaurant with someone, I'd like to actually eat at the same time as them. Novel concept, I know. When it finally came time to pay, the hostess left me standing at the register for over 10 minutes while she proceeded to seat everyone that was crowding the lobby. A cook from the kitchen finally came out to lend her a hand. Add in that I requested to speak with a manager and I was told, \"I'll have to try and find them.\" My waitress never came back with a manager. To have had such high ratings and what appeared to be a phenomenal menu, they didn't come close to giving me an experience that I would attempt again!"}, {"review_id": "nsdaSwV3_WomOSzBik7yrw", "user_id": "jSukFePJ-CZl8xpTwEUtOg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/17/2017", "text": "Temporarily stationed at Maxwell AFB, I was really looking forward to eating at First Watch.  We've got one at my home station, and I always enjoy the unique tastes of the fresh food served here.I really hope that my experience here is not the \"normal\" other people experience.4 stars - Food 3 stars - Service  1 star - Front house efficiency1 star - Back house efficiencyDuring our visit, we had a party of six.  It took an extremely long time for our food to come out.  The restaurant wasn't all that busy either, but in their defense, there were two large groups that had arrived before us.The host/cashier was undergoing training, and I noticed several of my colleagues (more than 15 people in line) in the previous groups had to wait over 30 minutes, standing in line to pay.  He chose to seat patrons rather than have customers pay their checks.  Having previously worked in the service previously, I know that this is extremely bad for business, because the more fed-up patrons get, the more likely they are to walk out on their checks."}, {"review_id": "m-824VPJmK6xaqslLvnV_Q", "user_id": "IF6sh6fcD1oqxEjY0iuMgQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "It's a classic!

Overall the restaurant is nicely decorated. Our party of four was shown to a table and our drink orders were taken. After reviewing the menu, we gave the server our orders. It didn't take very long for three of our orders to come out - and we figured the other would be out shortly. Nope. When our server delivered plates to a nearby table, he glanced our way and it registered that we were missing a meal. He quickly said it would be right out, and then brought our daughter's boyfriend some toast and jam while he waited. The plate came out pretty soon after, but at least 15 minutes must have passed before the server realized we were missing a plate. Throughout the meal it was difficult to get anyone's attention, although our server did ask  us once about refilling our drinks.The food was very good. My daughter especially enjoyed the potatoes which accompanied her biscuits and gravy, and the Millionaire Bacon was delicious. My only complaint regarding the food would be that the Avocado Toast comes with eggs, which I did not realize, and they did not ask me how I would like my eggs. They brought them sunny side up with runny yolks, which is my least favorite way of having eggs. Since I wasn't expecting them anyway, it wasn't that big of a deal. I didn't eat them.Usually breakfast is the least expensive meal of the day, so we were a little surprised when our check was over $64, before a tip. Three of us had coffee, which was served in a carafe at table -- but we were charged $2.69 for each cup, rather than a flat fee for the carafe. When we left, I mentioned to the cashier that the food was very good and we were looking forward to visiting the restaurant that is planned for Pearland, Texas, not terribly far from where we live. She kind of shrugged her shoulder and didn't really acknowledge that in saying that I was complimenting the restaurant's food -- I can't say service because I wasn't overly impressed by that.We will give the Pearland restaurant a try since it will be a new establishment with new staff that may be friendlier and more attentive to the patrons' needs."}, {"review_id": "WDMnGdrP8tyClwigi76zTg", "user_id": "L185-2okoRM95o08Z907yA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/19/2017", "text": "Loved it.
