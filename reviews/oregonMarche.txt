We split an almond croissant to start out and it was the best croissant I've ever eaten. SO good. I had the smoked salmon hash and, aside from the small hair I found on my egg, it was one of the best things I've ever eaten for breakfast/brunch. The flavors were perfect! I can't wait to go back and eat it again! The staff here were also all very friendly and welcoming.The one part of our visit that made me very sad (again, aside from the hair) was that they ran out of beignets. I was really looking forward to having some (I thought about them for weeks leading up to our reservation) and by 2 p.m. on Easter Sunday they were all sold out. Oh well. You should know that for me to give a place a 5 star review even after finding a hair on my food, the food must be amazing! Hair in food is not something I take lightly (unfortunately it happens to me a lot) but I'm telling you the food is so good that I didn't even care. I'll gladly be coming back here."}, {"review_id": "QYsfWN9GrRc9whSeFAysDg", "user_id": "jH2z7_ERZ8mD-aI38hsthg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Marches is what a restaurant should strive to be. Great service and amazing food. If you sit in the main dining area enough you'll hear the chef and cooks handle service like a symphony.

Used to be our place to go for a nice breakfast. Went today for a Valentine breakfast and the bacon was like leather  and I couldn't even get my fork in some of the fried potatoes. I am not one to complain but when the waitress (who was wonderful) asked how everything was, I told her the bacon was pretty much burnt. She immediately took it away and I heard her ask the kitchen to cook some more bacon that was not crispy. Well, it came and was extremely crispy - not leathery like the first but definitely way over cooked.  Granted we were there at the end of breakfast (10:30) but come on. It's not hard to cook bacon. It's like it had been sitting around all morning. Sorry, but hearing some other people that have also had problems with Marche' in the last few months, I think we'll rethink going there again in the future. It's a shame because it used to be exceptional!"}, {"review_id": "bBTK8BkQ-kPvfY2VpLXXbw", "user_id": "ZzBfI4gJBgRG13Yu2OZa3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "It felt like the paintings on the wall..the murals.  Its romantic and enchanting.  You can ride elevator to the third floor and sit or walk up there and its beautiful.

I like it but it doesn't always like me. It was a treat eating here and at the risk of sounding uppity, this was my intro to how sophisticated Eugene can be. The restaurant has a warm and inviting glow about it. Everyone on staff was lovely and our server was superb! Super attentive, made great recommendations with wine and the dishes we settled on.We shared the meat lasagna with a béchamel sauce, a squid ink spaghetti with Dungeness crab and creme fraiche. We also had fried Brussels sprouts with Dungeness crab (it's the thing to eat up here) over a bed of frisée. I cannot and will not going into my utter distaste for frisée. I'll just say this dish would have been better served without it in a smaller bowl. Husband had Oregon coast oysters-a must if you're into oysters. We shared an apple crumble with salted caramel ice cream. Everything was spectacular. It took every ounce of will power not to finish off those dishes. Very rich Indeed and not something I'm used to eating so it was a rare indulgence.The wine list was excellent at a fair price point. We settled on an Oregon Pinot for $70 and it was great. They had a lot of local and French wines. I would have normally gone with a French varietal, but tend to drink locally whenever I'm in town.The restaurant is located in a charming little center that was next to our hotel. I would go back and practice more restraint with the super rich dishes. Everything here was totally on point."}, {"review_id": "w4zmKO_Y3lWgnv0KXrcV9w", "user_id": "edmgGA-sEet44btFq-J77g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Wife and i both came on Sat morning.

The ultimate date night with a candle lit setting, attentive waiters who don't rush you (quite the opposite in fact, they encourage you to take your time, which I appreciate) and delicious French food that you can't even begin to understand the descriptions of. We had a bottle of champagne, oysters to start, the lamb plate and the gnudi, and the baked alaska and caramel apple crisp for dessert. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the braised greens, but overall, everything was delicious- especially the gnudi and the oysters. The menu changes seasonally I believe, so you probably won't see those items forever. I am also interested in trying the \"Le Bar\" on the other half of the restaurant, with slightly more casual fair. Will definitely return for another special occasion!"}, {"review_id": "UKlcc9oTE9WDGWzV9wY7ww", "user_id": "2M2GdA9HzcXI5cqECZDqgg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/12/2017", "text": "Parking is super convenient, with space available int he adjacent lot, on the street or any one of the free parking lots around 5th Street. The service is good and the staff if very friendly, consistent to ask if we have everything we need, if were enjoying ourselves, and refilling our water. The food is delicious, as is their coffee. I would recommend having a latte and the french toast. The french toast is very filling and very flavorful. The restaurant is good size so you don't feel all squished together like sardines and there is a lot of natural light, which I love. If the weather permits it and you are brave enough to endure the cold, there is outdoor seating."}, {"review_id": "w9JlX1QUT6Mg2HW3_UFhjA", "user_id": "nEnvPEBoZE5pR5700Afw7A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Ok restaurant food plane and greasy over price.I don't really find it enjoyable.

I'm a big fan of Provisions, but New Year's Eve was my first time actually dining at the the restaurant. My husband and I ordered a handful of starters and boards: olives, pickled plate, fish board, Brussels sprout salad and oysters. All were excellent, especially the fish board. Everything was timed out perfectly-we never had too many items on the table and we could nibble slowly.We ordered the lamb trio and the lobster special. The lobster was one of the best dishes I had all year. The lamb was great for meat lovers, very minimalist and lamb was the highlight.Cocktails were great as well, and the server helped us pick out wines to match our food. Overall, a great experience. Worth the price, especially for a nice celebratory dinner.

It was OK.  It wasn't exceptional.  To be honest much of the food was really salty.  The environment is pleasant.   They have an open cooking line where you can see the chefs and cooks.  It's comfortable.  It's a high end bistro.If I sound unenthusiastic,  it's because I am.  The food was decent, but only just so. For the money, it could be and should have been a lot better.  The thing that kind of bothered me was a sense of pretentiousness about the place.  It could be really good.  It should be really good.  But it just isn't that good.  Listening to the waiter's language, everything was phenomenal, the scallops 'shine', the Oregon truffle slices add magic to the meal.Yawn.Meh.  I know Oregon trufffles.  Perigord, yes.  Alba, yes.  Oregon?  No. They can have a reasonable fragrance but the flavor is not durable and they're just not the same thing and they shouldn't be represented as being all that.Also, while I'm at it,the Charcuterie plate was uninspired and offered a 'selection of salami' but in fact I had to choose between just one salume and a coppa.  The chicken rillette was bland.The restaurant owners know all this because they're well traveled and actual gourmands.  So, why go overboard?  Just to raise the check value?  I suppose...Eugene may not be Manhattan, but I think the people who dine at Marche have sophisticated palates and deserve better.  Either that, or call it what it is, but don't go overboard on the descriptions and pretense."}, {"review_id": "4XNrhzc87o2kXVHOF_-T1A", "user_id": "6cWASvHRufQ9m_gTi1Eakw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Their breakfast is awesome!!!!

The appetizers were perfect, and I can't complain about the flavor.  The cassoulet was perfect for that cold night, however, I had no meat whatsoever on the pork belly. It was just straight fat. Everything else about the cassoulet was delicious; wrap it was moist yet crispy, The sausage was spicy and perfectly cooked, and the beans were soft and blended well with the other flavors.I also ordered a bottle of Old World style red wine for the table.  Unfortunately, upon tasting the first bottle it was skunky.

I usually get the omelette with goat cheese and mushrooms but everything I've tried here has been scrumptious. The eggs are always cooked to perfection and since I'm an egg lover/snob I know this means they really take their time to cook  your food. My boyfriend ordered the pork belly eggs Benedict the last time we were there and oh my...it melted in my mouth! I love the lattes that they serve in giant bowls with beautiful latte art on top.
