We have been in Tulsa for many years and haven't found a bar that makes better drinks than Valkyrie. If you are a cocktail aficionado then this place is for you! The cocktail menu changes every season but don't feel obligated to follow the menu. They have the option to tell your bartender about what you are in the mood for with over a dozen key words like \"fruity\", \"smoky\", or \"refreshing\" and your bartender will make up a drink just for you! A few favorites there are the classic \"El Diablo\" - with Sombre Mezcal, tequila, crème de cassis and home made ginger beer - and the Port-au Prince a great rum drink with lemon juice. The only issue is that the place is so good that it is packed on the weekends! So make sure to arrive early on Friday-Saturday nights if you want a seat. The bar is fairly small and only accommodate about 60-70 people. Otherwise this is a perfect place to unwind and socialize!"}, {"review_id": "pJ9NV5drtao5Hy2E9vEWbQ", "user_id": "dxMIsuPJQjTjKYoKZJ3W6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "Valkyrie has become my favorite stop for drinks to kick off a fun night out. Or to end a night. Or smack dab in the middle. Okay, really, there's no bad time for a cocktail here. I love their rotating specialty cocktails as there's always something amazing that is seasonal. And when you go back wanting the El Diablo months later, they'll still make it without hesitation. Everyone needs to try the El Diablo. Mmm.One of my favorite options on the menu, though? You pick 3 adjectives from a list and they create a cocktail just for you and how you're feeling that night. Love the personalized touch on basically telling the bartender to pick something for you.Great beer list too!Couches up front need to be replaced, but whatever. Have another El Diablo and you won't notice."}, {"review_id": "zabg0Tw___QNVLVQ--aP_w", "user_id": "W_jCVmCPoKEG8vQlXQwvDg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "This place is amazing and deserves to be a 5 star stop on the Michelin guide.By far the best cocktail bar I've ever been to, highest quality bartenders with the best selection of spirits.It is a MUST EXPERIENCE  when you're in downtown Tulsa."}, {"review_id": "hVMx_3T-vudntTbWCU4ajA", "user_id": "K3_WldcPvvzuqsyMp-FD7Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Awesome music, craft drinks and atmosphere!

Great ambience, dark & classy with a fantastic bar, booths & couches. The bartender will give you tasters and help you select new things to try out. My sons were there for scotch (they enjoyed a fabulous Japanese scotch), but there is also a huge handcrafted cocktail menu, as well as beer & wine. If you can't find something to drink here then you're just not really thirsty! It's not a restaurant, but there is cheese & charcuterie to accompany & complement your beverages. Great place to hit up for cocktails & conversation before or after dinner - or both!"}, {"review_id": "2LPLP-OStQezRdUujTXNtA", "user_id": "a7CxSg2_xRXO8AwHWxOLHQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "They have this really cool thing where you list a few personality traits (i.e. playful, complex, etc) and/or tastes you like (i.e. sour, sweet, fruity) from a small prompt and they make a drink based on a what you select.

They know how to make a stunning old fashioned, amaretto sour, and to embellish, if you tell them what you like.  I come and go in waves, depending upon the season.  I have tried the season of tequila, gin, and whisky drinks -- all the same.  They also feature a splendid beer lineup.  But, with rare exceptions, I always order cocktails here.  BTW - they will make a terrific mocktail if you have a DD or non-drinker in your midst. This is a real diamond in the Brady district.  I remember 3 years ago when there was nothing here, besides Brady Tavern, a few subpar dining options, and Glacier confections.  Things have changed.  The Brady district is alive and well.  Long live Valkyrie !"}, {"review_id": "jS-WVLnwXp0N_DhnIrgPxg", "user_id": "9jk4X1St6Sdm2uEYeZWKtw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/26/2017", "text": "Fun after dinner drink bar.

I'm not a big drinker but I did really appreciate the Lord Nibbler, which was my favorite drink. This place can be a bit overwhelming if you're a noob with your spirits and drinks, but the waitresses here are great and super helpful with helping you find the right drink. The main reason I also appreciate this bar, at least compared to California is that there's so much space!! This bar was the most crowded place I saw in Tulsa, but even then, I never thought the bar itself was crowded or too empty. There's a cozy couch area to sit on, or massively large booths. Pretty neat decor and set up."}, {"review_id": "7TwHtVnnrwHX4XepmMzt9A", "user_id": "Wv4h3Nwb4dQgVL4LCRU_dw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "Every time I'm in town I definitely enjoy checking this far out.
