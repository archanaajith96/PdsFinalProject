We use to live in Washington DC which not only had our nations capital, but so many varieties of food - including delicious Vietnamese. But this place is wonderful. I normally get #16 and my husband gets #22, but I'm a huge fan of both. The spring rolls are pretty tasty as well. We have had their warm sandwiches (I can't remember the number), and they're very good as well. Whether you eat inside or get carry out, you won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "FbsSmQx0rlHCuZdXGt78NQ", "user_id": "4QGfZc15B9Fn2lSOz4f_KA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "10/22/2017", "text": "For sweetness sake! I went with my go-to order, the pho tai (eye round steak) in the large size and was pretty disappointed. Great pho is judged by its broth, comprised of the earthiness and long simmering of bones and meat, complemented by spices and aromatics. So, I don't like to directly add hoisin sauce, siracha, or anything into the pho because blasting it with these additional sweet and spicy flavors, before giving it a chance, is sort of criminal. At first slurp, the broth was unusually sweet! I asked my friend, who tends to prefer her broth on the sweeter side to try it, and she agreed with me too. My other friend, who ordered the pho dac biet (combination of beef cuts) also thought her broth was sweet. As for the main components, the meat and noodles, there was a good amount of steak pieces but they were all well-done and tough to chew *sad face*. The noodles on the other hand, (my second favorite after the broth, of course) were cooked to the perfect silky-ness, and I wished my pho had more! My friend even made a comment that my bowl looked like it had less noodles than my other friend's bowl, which was also the large size. I was glad she was willing to share some of her noodles with me though :)Despite the friendly and efficient service here, my expectations of its pho were not met. The competitor, Pho Factory across the street is still my favorite and also cheaper, without compromising the quality of its pho or service."}, {"review_id": "viS1Z6feNUkLATasDASBaA", "user_id": "3Br2kVqplyN3jbnqwsR2kQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/20/2017", "text": "Drove an hour from Omaha specifically to try this place out on a cold, dreary day. Totally worth it, the pho here easily beats all the pho I've tried in Omaha. Got a large pho for a little over $9 and it definitely hit the spot. Broth was flavorful but not very oily, meat was tender, noodles were perfect, big plate of bean sprouts offered. Only thing is that I love tendon and wish the pieces were a bit bigger, but that's minor.Wasn't hungry at the start of the drive but the hunger pangs really started hitting me halfway there so I was extremely grateful the service was fast and friendly. Might've helped that we got there around 3PM and there was only 2 other tables there, but literally another server came with our waters like 5 seconds after someone sat us down.There are quite a few tables and it's not the most modern place, but it's pretty clean and well lit. Actually how I prefer my pho places because I always find the best pho aren't in the fancy looking restaurants.Another thing I thought was a little weird was that for the pho sizes, it went from small to large to XL. What happened to the medium? Haha."}, {"review_id": "9qxK-CzSoz-oMFOcA9iegQ", "user_id": "DI1c1uVvkYcHWzThWWWL5w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/20/2017", "text": "The service is friendly and nice.

Maybe the other items on the menu  are good. However, the pho had the oilest broth I've ever had with a bowl of pho and I've ate a lot of pho in southern California and Arizona. I literally did not feel well after eating. The pictures of the rice vermicelli and other dinners looked good and I would try that sometime but stay away from the pho."}, {"review_id": "LvVAK4FGLYT8qKh9H9VURQ", "user_id": "_aRCHvQvuC6nCTYjFfaMww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/9/2017", "text": "We ordered pho, bun bo hue, and coffee. the pho was okay, not very flavorful , too little meats, i had way better meat balls but did came with fresh basil and bean sprouts. Bun bo hue - i ordered Bun Bo Hue, what was given to me did not taste like Bun Bo Hue.  It was good but it was not Vietnamese Bun Bo Hue. Tastes more like tum yum noodle (soup had tum yum flavor, no pork leg (gio heo), very little meats, has beef flank which is used for beef stew not Bun Bo Hue, and not the right vegetables - only bean sprouts and basil which is for pho.) the Vietnamese coffee was good. Quick services. We came during lunch time on a Saturday and it was not busy. Average priced. Overall, this is not the best choice if you're looking for authentic Bun Bo Hue."}, {"review_id": "2hbi9LNPrYXMKz35WhlfbA", "user_id": "nTLjPTyMQYmm6Mai6vN18g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "Pho is very good.

Lincoln is 3/3 on my pho tour, while Omaha is still at a sad 0/3. Therefore, while visiting family in Lincoln, we are always sure to make a stop at one of the great pho establishments they have there. I am aware Lincoln has a larger Vietnamese population than Omaha does so it is not surprising that they have better pho too.Vung Tau's broth is clear and oil free. The aroma is healing in itself, that is, if you have any sort of ailment (a cold, a hangover, etc). I did think it had a bit of a sweet taste which was not bad, just a slightly different style than I am used to. What really impressed me was the meat in my combo bowl. There was not any extra meat or anything, but the cuts and cooked-ness (is that is word?) of the various meats in my bowl were wonderful. Thinly sliced and the texture was awesome I could tell they were slow cooked and cut with care. My bowl had brisket, flank, tendon, 2 kinds of tripe, and meatballs with tendon. Many times establishments can over or under cook (read: too chewy) tendon and tripe.This is a family run establishment and I would recommend them for your next pho craving."}, {"review_id": "1HN6butFq-Dj_LB7ekz1XQ", "user_id": "9wHAA5s2kCgUyjc6ycxe6g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/11/2016", "text": "This place is wonderful and I've never had a bad experience.

I arrived at around 11:30 on a Sunday morning. There were only a few other patrons there at the time and service was great. Upon the server's recommendation, I tried a medium-sized bowl of the grilled pork pho. He said this was added to the menu at the request of diners. The pho was delivered promptly. The broth was much darker than at other places I have been to, but was absolutely amazing. Slightly salty, but I figured that would definitely help my hangover. The grilled pork surprised me, as it had a slight sweetness to it. I'm not sure if it's marinated or rubbed with a sweet glaze, but it was brilliantly charred and delicious. The charred bits even held up well to the broth and provided a nice contrast in textures. I had to ask for a fork because I'm normally not bad with chopsticks but I was too hungover to properly function without slopping noodles all over me. Next time I'm in Lincoln I'll be stopping here again. Best pho I have had so far in Nebraska."}, {"review_id": "beXZLrnui7GXGQqKnd79rw", "user_id": "c3-0alWrQKTN6clB4QinHQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/19/2017", "text": "This is my favorite place to eat in Lincoln.
