The waitress - Amanda B - was super friendly and answered any questions we had.Paloma Mule - This cocktail packs a punch! You are definitely in an Irish Bar with this one!Jenkinstown Cottage Pie - This was really tasty. I would have liked to have seen more meat and veggies though. The mashed potatoes to meat ratio was just a little too high for my liking.Irish Travelers Chicken Cordon Bleu - This thing was massive! You can definitely make a couple meals off of this one dish easily. It was packed with ham and cheese and lightly breaded.Sticky Toffee Pudding - I would lick this stuff of the floor if I had to. It was so SO good. Save room, get the to go box, but you have to get this!"}, {"review_id": "PT0rlRyqG1qVGObl4g5adA", "user_id": "qRvsaSrw72KfzTnVn1t3Og", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "I have never been to Ireland nor to an Irish pub, but this place is pretty spectacular for existing in good ole Oklahoma! I absolutely love the decor inside. The giant wall of liquor, the authentic feel of an Irish pub, the books everywhere... it's such a fun experience. I am a huge fan of the chicken pot pie and the Irish nachos (potato chips instead of the traditional tortilla chips). The bread pudding is delicious as well. Any place that bread pudding is available, I order some. This place does not disappoint!I think some live Irish music would make for a really fun Friday or Saturday night experience."}, {"review_id": "lhGo4JVPZJUwY15Zu9nd8Q", "user_id": "MCg4_V6hKyrDRrZ3Uwzk5A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "We love Kilkenny's!!! Okay, I'll say it again, we LOVE Kilkenny's!! Before this, I didn't know what Irish food was! Or what good Irish food was! I mean, what the heck is a boxty? Thanks for opening our eyes, Kilkenny's! We have been here twice having moved to Tulsa recently, and we have not been disappointed. The fried pork ribs is the bomb.com! So juicy and crispy and nicely seasoned. How they make the meat so juicy on the inside while encased in the lightly battered outside I don't understand. It was a nice portion for appetizer and great to get things started. The oysters shamrockfeller was also amazing! I tried the craigue, the seafood (lobster, shrimp, and crab) boxty last time I was there. And all I can say is wow! I didn't know stuffing shrimp, crab, and lobster into a potato entree of goodness smothered in creamy Alfredo sauce would produce such explosions of flavors in your mouth! It was like a giant crab cake that never ends. The beer selection can't be beat either! Come here and you won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "5j5xkI0pnbED1ibnwSEvQA", "user_id": "FqNJxZ3zkcF-o-QUXz4yeg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "This is where we held the After-Rehearsal Dinner for my friends who are getting married today & what a great choice! This is also the place my friends had their first date so it's perfect that we held the dinner here. The place was crowded for a Saturday night. Business was running well. Service was fantastic & the people I was with? Amazing! The food was very good too! I had the Kilmacow, which is seared beef with Irish Whiskey Sauce, Boxty (Irish pancake-type delicacy), sauteed mushrooms, & a side of veggies. Very delicious meal! Perfect for this Irish girl! The cocktail I had was the Flirtini. It consists of Vodka, Pineapple juice, Raspberry liquer, & Champagne, & wow, was it good?! I would definitely have it again! This place is very accommodating to large groups & the prices are reasonable. I would definitely come here again."}, {"review_id": "7rSluEVH_eAfGwb70XpNmw", "user_id": "4ARtF0gMTrhEeBLIR-3VHw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "I'm not a huge fan of Irish food (even though I'm 1/3 Irish...shhh), but this place probably had the best Irish food I've had. I got to try a few things I've never had or even heard of before. This place helped me prepare for our trip to Ireland later this June. I enjoyed trying two different boxties the rueben and the seafood. The scottish eggs were very good and the so were the bangers and mash. The place was pretty busy, but they got us in pretty quickly which I appreciated since I was starving! I will definitely go back and now I'm even looking forward to the food on our trip!"}, {"review_id": "F34gPInusMeBIpyWS2ZFzQ", "user_id": "-1N7JCvz7wiawaF6N_aBzQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Traditional Irish everything! We went for brunch and it was for the most part, delicious. Someone in our party did order the biscuits and gravy and said the biscuits were burnt and hard and they were not a fan of the gravy.  I however, had a waffle with bananas and a side of home fries.  It was golden on the outside, served hot and soft on the outside and it was fulfilling. I also started our meal with Scotch eggs as they are one of my favs, but hard to find.  They were a bit over cooked, and only came with honey mustard (I traditionally like the brown sauce), but the sausage flavor was outstanding. My husband had the traditional Irish breakfast and he ate ALL of it. Bangers, beans, Irish bacon, and blood sausage.  It's not quite like eating in a pub in Dublin, but it's the closest we have gotten in Tulsa.  The overall result was an Irish aura, good service, and food that fills you up. We will be back!"}, {"review_id": "fo7wALlFEAjxwGAPKCoxbQ", "user_id": "QQ3_cLwCBFe436-bHQlwCg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Huge portions. If you like floats, they make a pretty neat Guinness float, which has vanilla ice cream on top of the beer. I got the chicken pot pie and it came with two sides, which was sooooo much more than what little me can handle. But it was delicious. Their baby back ribs for appetizer is cooked to perfection and just right to whet your appetite.

The center of Cherry Street and home to a fabulous and unique menu and bar. My love of Kilkenny's has only grown over the years. With the discovery of the late nite menu (served from 10pm-2am) and Irish brunch (served Saturday and Sunday from 9am-2pm), I have come here more than I'd like to admit. Boxty's are still my staple here and recommendation to anyone trying Kilkenny's for the first time, but there are lots of other tasty options on the vast menu depending on your mood. The fish and chips here is killer. The Galway oysters and Reuben rolls are my favorite appetizers. For dessert, the Irish balloons are heavenly. Great food and great atmosphere are truly what make Kilkenny's special. Ask any local Tulsan if they want to come eat at Kilkenny's and usually their face lights up like it's Christmas!"}, {"review_id": "EWm7lP5HJPPJfcKAdIlb-A", "user_id": "R_mF7GdN1I32TszgW7_nxg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "The atmosphere and food are the best.

I love how versatile Kilkenny's is - whether you're wanting drinks with friends, a place to watch the game, a chill date night, this pub does it all! I was very surprised to see how big the place was on my second visit when I was seated in the quieter section of the pub when I came with one other person, but I've also enjoyed hanging by the bar when I'm there catching up with friends. The atmosphere is definitely one of the most enjoyable features of the place. Now let's talk food. Their menu is pretty extensive for pub food so I was a little overwhelmed, but I decided on having the sandwich with meatloaf and bbq sauce, which was delicious if you're a lover of bbq & onion rings in your sandwiches (I know I am!!), but I was even more impressed by my friend's bayou burger, which I can't wait to go back for! I also had their oyster stuffing which was an amazing addition to my meal! The service was great, too, and there's really nothing I can complain about. Can't wait to head back!"}, {"review_id": "ngZOLNQ361oIIEFd6AlbYw", "user_id": "0B7nBoDzaU1gvJ41JPbaPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2017", "text": "I may not be Irish but I sure felt like I was after I left here! First time to Kilkenny's and it was absolutely great! We came during St. Patrick's week, my friend Anna F. went ahead and made reservations since this place gets packed! Good call on that! Parking is a bit tough for cherry street area so there's more parking right behind Hideaways Pizza. We walked in was seated in the middle of the restaurant. The decor was very Irishy! I loved it! Felt like I was at an Irish pub in Ireland! The menu and the drink menu was intense! I opted to get the fish and chips (lunch portion) which comes with one big thick piece of Cod! It was really great. The batter on the fish was thick, fish was moist and very flakey. So good! Dessert was amazing. We ordered a bit of everything. My favorite was the Creme brulee! Not overly sweet! Service was great. Everyone was very friendly! Definitely will come back and try more Irish food!"}, {"review_id": "JDR9zn0UZSViPZnAv92e0w", "user_id": "i6aQ6pv7iD6jl4okgrJEXw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "A couple of friends had introduce my husband and I to this place and we went to try the burgers there.

Our fish and chips had an enormous thick cod plank and the chips or potato wedges were really good. Leesa enjoyed her meal as well.For dessert, Leesa ordered the Bailey's Irish Cream Cheesecake and we ordered the Irish Creme Brûlée. We received the Guineans Chocolate Cake as well, but we're not charged due to only ordering two desserts. The food was delicious and it really felt like visiting Ireland.

My husband and I went around 9 PM on a Saturday night and we were slightly worried we wouldn't get a seat. We were happy to find there was a spot right next to the bar and we slipped right in.We ordered our drinks and sat in awe of the restaurant, I have never been to Ireland, but I imagine this is a near exact replica of what an Irish pub would be like.Our waitress was very helpful when choosing drinks and food. Service was fast and pleasant.My husband ordered the oysters and a salad. There was a large amount of oysters and the appetizer, all of which he ate and reported were delicious.I ordered the boxty which I had never heard of before and it blew my mind. It's a mashed up potato that is like a wrap and stuffed inside it was corn beef, cabbage, carrots and potatoes. On top it is drizzled with the most delicious sauce I have ever tasted. I also ordered the corn and lobster soup unfortunately they both came at the same time so I  didn't get to enjoy the soup but I did have a few sips and that too was delicious.Overall this restaurant is a  five-star, for service, atmosphere, food and drinks. This is a must when in Tulsa , Oklahoma."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/kilkennys-irish-pub-tulsa?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
