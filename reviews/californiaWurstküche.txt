Words can't describe the level of happiness I tasted. Street parking nearby was only $1 per hour which is beyond terrific for LA. There was a long line as we entered but it moved really fast! There was also someone who passed out menus, helped answer questions, and took our drink order in line to help expedite our waiting/ordering process. I don't think waiting is an issue here, at least when we went for Saturday lunch. I liked how they categorized the menu by classic, interesting, and exotic (lack of better or actual terms). I was feeling less ambitious and went to the Chicken & Spices sausage with sauerkraut and grilled onions as my 2 toppings. Personally, I'm not too big on sausages or meaty things but this was pretty darn delicious, juicy, and flavorful. I tried it with the different types of mustards in the fun back seating area (which probably has a bigger capacity than Grand Central Market) but I thought the original flavor of the sausage was too good that it should be enjoyed without extra flavoring. I am definitely coming back for more sausages!Two other wonderful consumables to note: Their Elderflower soda is bomb dot com! Their super thick fries are also incredibly tasty!"}, {"review_id": "ZxpfrPylchu7eRjtePSamQ", "user_id": "J7yrodx4X_ptycfYf7DsMA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "It's been a while since I've been here, specifically, because there is a similar place in Santa Ana (unrelated to this place) but this is a satisfying place for meat eaters and veg-heads alike. Parking is a B for this place, unsurprisingly, my boyfriend and I parked like, a block and a half away. Not terrible, but keep it in mind. You order at the front counter where they give you a number to find you later. There's a bar in the back and too, so you don't have to order beer here but there is the option. I get the vegetarian Mexican chipotle with sauerkraut and sweet onions and later heart burn because of it. Worth it. My boyfriend and I split the large fries (which come with two sauces). My boyfriend had the blue cheese sauce that has bacon in it and made mmm mmm mmm noises so he obviously loved it. The fries are delicious. Make sure you grab all of mustards you can! Honey mustard is my personal favorite."}, {"review_id": "bpX3zwEfIWaA0WvqT2r7NA", "user_id": "1aZLYbjfRqEN1SQkumeHYQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "I love this place, and there's really not much (if anything) to criticize.

I also highly recommend the hot link.   The space is pretty big and I've never had trouble finding a table.

Adding some spicy peppers are an awesome way to spice up the food and the mustard offerings are great. There are classics and gourmet are great options too. On the  gourmet side, the Filipino Maharlika has a nice sweet and savory flavor that reminds me of Filipino tastes.The Belgian fries are nice addition to your meal and for a little extra, the white truffle oil takes it to another level.

But I do not hate standing in line for this location. (My original unposted review.)I caught myself coming to this location at least once a month. Unfortunately they no longer carry the vegetarian Mexican Chipotle sausage. This is what I would always order. I did not enjoy the mango jalapeño (not vegetarian). I tried the vegetarian beyond hot Italian sausage and it was ok, it's better than the mango jalapeño. They now carry the \"beyond\" vegetarian brand. They have 3 flavors. Overall I'm sad they no longer have the Mexican Chipotle sausage. And I'm sad to say that this will definitely stop me from visiting this location as often as I was."}, {"review_id": "qGK_mOkW0eNO19-81ogrrQ", "user_id": "3hse6Ud4QZaEITqe6NsAFw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "As a Wisconsin native, I have to say that Wurstkuche might be some of the best sausage on the west coast that I've had in the 3.5 years that I've lived here.My boyfriend and I came here for some late night food and the possibilities were endless!  Wurstkuche has so many interesting combinations of sausages that you want to try a sample platter of all of them - maybe they should add something like that to their menu???  I had the vegetarian smoked apple and sage sausage and I really enjoyed it.  It had a beautiful smoky flavor, and the potato base was so satisfying.    My boyfriend went with the duck and bacon sausage and he absolutely loved it.  The buns our sausages were served on were hefty, and we both really liked having the options of having multiple types of mustards available to us.  You'r also able to choose multiple toppings - and I'm pretty sure I went with multiple types of onions.  The fries here are also an absolute must!!  Thick, crispy, and crunchy.The space itself is fantastic.  The space for ordering is fairly tight quarters, but after ordering and taking a number to a table in the back - I was floored with how much room there was! Long tables lined up with paper table cloths that people were drawing and writing all over.  There's also another bar in the back for ordering drinks.  The two of us loved this place and will definitely be back to try more!"}, {"review_id": "yUhcVVci2DN9yjJCG3A4sQ", "user_id": "ZA23ZpszWKhEeCs_ivR9Vg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "This place is a hidden gem. With so many different flavors of hot dogs to choose from, it makes eating a hot dog fun! Each purchase comes with 2 toppings (see menu for toppings). Prices are reasonable anywhere from 7.95-$10ish. If there's two of you, one large French fries is big enough to split. You also get 2 sauces with the fries. They don't have traditional soda, only German style bottle sodas. However they have water machines on the walls mixed with cucumber that is REALLY good & free. For two of us the bill was $28 which jncluded 2 hot dogs, 1 large fry, and 1 bottled soda.

But the condiments are amazing! The spicy ketchup and grain mustard were both great addition to the hotdog. And the fries ARE INCREDIBLE. Definitely one of the best fries I have ever had.

The fries looked wonderful (classic fries with a golden crisp), but saving that for another time. My friend and I split the Austin Blues, drawn to the idea of smoked pork (and a nod to lil' ol' Austin). The sausage was really tasty and the whole grain mustard was excellent on it. To be honest, I couldn't taste much heat or smoke, because all I could think about was how juicy it was and which mustard I could add... (tough call between the honey mustard and whole grain) One note is that it gets pretty loud inside, you're practically yelling to be heard. Bring some cough drops or get outside seating if you're planning on having a conversation. And while the line can get pretty long on a weekend night, it moves pretty fast and you can sip on a beer while you wait."}, {"review_id": "4mwE9WC9o-vBRCaLGChBkQ", "user_id": "cG1kodPs5fadvKBFHH8zmA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "This place gets packed! Lines out the door (literally). Of course parking is atrocious in the area but it's worth the hassle to go here. I am a lover of hot dogs and beer so this place is for me. Only thing is that it can be pricey but its worth all the different types of sausages and all the different kinds of mustard (although I admit I am use to my regular $1.50 costco hot dogs). Sausages are categorized in three categories for classics ($7.50), gourmet ($8), and exotics ($9.50). Came here with my boyfriend and coworkers around 2 pm on Saturday. Ordered the lamb and it comes with TWO SAUSAGES. Kinda made my day those two sausages. The fries are killer...really delicious and the curry ketchup and aioli were really good dips.  Beer seems to be around $8 and I was impressed by the different cups for different beers. It's quite cute. There are also crayons on the tables which I enjoyed (I'm basically a full grown child). There were long picnic tables and some smaller tables. I saw there was a small DJ turntable but no one playing. Bar in the eating area so you don't need to get back in the first line. I WILL BE BACK!!!!!!!!!!

Paired with their extensive selection of mustards and sauces (definitely try the chipotle aioli), every bite feels like a chunk of heaven. The beer menu is also huge, ranging from $3 PBRs to authentic German beer that I can't even pronounce. Also they serve you beer while you're waiting in line, which is a game changer. Pro tip: the regular fries are practically the same size as the large, so unless you're doing it for the extra dipping sauce, a regular will probably be enough.

Reading about this store on Yelp was like \"sooo exotic\" \"so good\" \"best hot dog I ever had\" it prepared me for something amazing and something I have never ate before. I decided I would get a hot dog that was different and I never heard of. I got the Rattlesnake and Rabbit Hot Dog with Jalapeno Peppers. Hot dog- Very average. I think it was more like a burger in a hot dog shape. The meat didn't taste different. It tasted like a meatball of some sort. I mean it was still good, but it didn't impress me. I also got the sweet peppers and onions on top of it which made it pretty yummy.Overall, I don't know that I would come here again. Just get the $1.50 hot dogs from Costco. It also has a drink so that's nice.

I'm not a big sausage/meat eater, but the tastiness of the food keeps me coming back! The sausages are cooked to perfection and packed with juicy flavor, the onions grilled perfectly, and the sauces always round everything out. There's a wide variety of interesting sauces that will suit whatever mood you're in, whether you're feeling Whole Grain or curry ketchup. I love the Bratwurst and Sundried Tomato and Mozzarella sausages the best, along with the Le Trappe beer. You can grab a beer as you wait to place your order, and other than the sometimes lengthy wait times, dim lighting, and loud music, it's a great place to catch up with friends, chill, bring out your inner child drawing on the tables, and eat delicious sausages and fries foremost.

My party & I ordered the Duck & Bacon w Jalapeno peppers and the Rattlesnake & Rabbit w Jalapeno peppers ($8.50 each). You also get to add 2 toppings (caramelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet or spicy peppers). Both of the hot dogs tasted okay. There was nothing special about the bread or meat.
