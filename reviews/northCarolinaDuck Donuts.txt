I was running kind of late and didn't really know what to order, but the staff at Duck Donuts were really helpful in explaining the pricing structure and giving flavor suggestions. As someone who gets ordering anxiety when I am in a line, no-one wants to be that annoying person taking forever, I really appreciate that they offer a paper menu where you can stand off to the side to mark your order. Ended up ordering a variety of donuts including maple bacon (the best thing ever), lemon/coconut, oreo cookie, and strawberry. Not sure about how they all tasted, but there were no leftovers which is a great indication of the quality!"}, {"review_id": "jzdR2aC2K-dNbdfOJS1tEA", "user_id": "1W3UHZt5vKhR75AZOpz6Ww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Great donuts! The maple bacon one is our favorite! They put like a mountain of bacon on there, fresh delicious, glistening, golden bacon, not the dry bits that some other places offer.There are more of a cake donut and they are denser, yet airy at the same time.  It's such a cool place. You can see them making the donuts and they're always nice and warm!We almost went to some other place, but it was closed so we found this place and we were ecstatic."}, {"review_id": "WXAgsgvqdqAjVhqRNPmojw", "user_id": "7yDDAnthr-3RFuhGjgxD8Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "I came to visit from out of town and heard raving reviews about Duck Donuts! Checked it out online and knew I had to try it! It surpassed my expectations!I live in Toronto and we have a lot of popular donuts shops! There's a particular one closer to my house and I've just had it so many times that I've been craving for new ones! I absolutely love Duck Donuts! What I liked about it most is that they serve it warm! Sooooooo good warm! It just melts in your mouth! We informed the person working there that it's our first time. He was very friendly and explained the menu to us and how it worked. And even gave us some recommendations and what some customer favourites are! We went with flavours that we would typically like and absolutely loved it! The flavours weren't too empowering, it was just right! We wish we could've brought some home to share with our families (or not)!"}, {"review_id": "DJuYM-9fQrONNAQTVPe-FA", "user_id": "ayVBf253VsV2Es7tD-rgug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "I mean really what is there to say negatively about duck donuts. I have been to this place multiple times and never once I have been disappointed. I was craving something sweet when I realized I hadn't stopped in for a while and boy was I glad I did. I got my regular strawberry glazed with Oreos crumbles on top but got even more excited when I noticed they had a key lime glaze for the spring time. I didn't even know this existed and knew I had to try it. I got the cinnamon sugar donut with key lime drizzle on top (a suggested flavor). It was everything I could ever imagine with amazing flavors and soft dough texture. I will be dreaming about that key lime glaze for a while now"}, {"review_id": "ItnHGvOaXgo185bHH5kJwg", "user_id": "2ZFIUlwwvMHxLOpARwLSFA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Wow.

I had two!!!  They were so warm and soft. Not like any other place I've been. I thought there's no was this town has better desserts then NY where I'm from. Uh. Wrong. Best I've had ever!!!! The batter is has to have magic in it lol. The taste is soft buttery and melts with every bite. I'm so tempted to book a flight back.

I love a yeast doughnut and I'm not a huge fan of cake doughnuts. But Duck's doughnuts are delicious. They're hot and they're not dry like some cake doughnuts tend to be. You can choose a variety of glazes, toppings and drizzles. I opted for a maple glaze with bacon and salted Carmel drizzle. It was so good with the warmth of the doughnut mixed with the sweet and saltiness of the Maple glaze, bacon and salted Carmel.

I was excited to try them after hearing about them several times the previous week. Alas, they didn't send me to the moon. They were nice and I was glad they weren't too sweet, but the dough texture was much less fluffy than I like; the donut actually felt a little lumpy. Also the frosting didn't taste like the chocolate or cream it appeared to emulate--it was bland. Don't get me wrong, I'll take a free donut any day. But I wasn't enticed to go back for a second. Gotta say, though, I did love the theme and am always stoked when a retailer supports science, regardless of whether or not there are commercial underlying motivations."}, {"review_id": "4D2SN06vzR4rd7OYc10UsA", "user_id": "dpzAqLprtex54rXlCU-OTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/3/2017", "text": "If you're a regular in the Dilworth or South End neighborhood and haven't been to Duck Donuts, you don't know what you're missing! They serve hot, made to order custom donuts. When I say custom, I mean anyway you want it. How about a vanilla glaze with coconut flakes and raspberry drizzle? Don't be shy, they cater to your preferences.If you know you're going to place a big order with a lot of different flavored donuts, go ahead and grab an order sheet on the stand as soon as you walk in and fill it out. That way you can hand it to the cashier when you're ready and keep the line moving. Make sure to grab whatever they're sampling near the service counter as well!First time here? My suggestion is the crowd favorite Maple-Bacon with Salted Caramel Drizzle. A bit more plain but my favorite is the Cinnamon Sugar with Raspberry Drizzle. You really can't go wrong with any combination you choose. You even get to watch them make it right in front of you!Can you get cheaper donuts in Charlotte? Maybe.

Our donuts were warm and fresh. The thing I was most surprised about was the price. I expected it to be overpriced and a treat, but it was reasonable. Two donuts and two coffees for about $7 bucks. I would definitely recommend if you like rich and sweet breakfast! :)"}, {"review_id": "Ig_iypUbf-agDqfpHzVQqg", "user_id": "F4Abg96un5mT019hdstmVA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2017", "text": "Couple donuts from Duck's and sugar rush is sure to kick in !!
