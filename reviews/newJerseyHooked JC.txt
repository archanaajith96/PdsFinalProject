From the outside it looks like an old time dive bar. On the inside it looks like an old time dive bar but one with a lot of kitsch nautical items dotted around. However Hooked isn't a dive bar, it doesn't even have a liquor license, (BYOB from the liquor store a block away) instead it's a casual fish restaurant, offering an interesting selection of seafood all cooked and served up as if you are in an actual fish shack at the beach. We went for a Saturday lunch and I was surprised to find it fairly busy considering it's out of the way location. The owner was there and he went out of his way to make us feel welcome and explained in detail about the daily specials. The staff are friendly, you order at the counter and pay and they bring your food to you when it's ready, and we didn't have long to wait until our seafood feast arrived. We each had a platter which comprises a fish item which comes fried, grilled or blackened (we had fried shrimp and fried oysters) and is served with hand cut french fries, hush puppies and coleslaw. Everything on the platter was excellent, fresh, tasty and generously portioned - so good! We also ordered a pair of blackened crab cakes which were superb, full of sweet crab meat with no filler.There's a big back room and Hooked JC would be a great place for a large group. Prices were very reasonable and there were lots of small things that made this a cool spot such as the 'fake newspaper' the food is served on, the selection of home made help yourself sauces - cocktail, remoulade etc, and the free fruit infused 'fancy waters'. It was very welcoming and had a very homely vibe as well as great food. If you haven't been to Hooked JC yet you should, it's worth the journey!"}, {"review_id": "27elYniWrAk-DvDjpkxnbQ", "user_id": "-T44q0D6oPaq0CJMZcmmjw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I went here and ate the fried oysters and crab cakes my wife had the prawns, it's a little quirky spot a rose between many thorns, located basically behind liberty state park, the food was very good large portions and well cooked the chips/French fries were excellent and the hush puppies were awesome, the oysters came by weight and were a generous portion as were the prawns, the crab cakes we had blackened and enjoyed too lots of flavor going on there.The decor is very nautical inspired and fun with wood paneling throughout with nets, floats and pictures and all manner of nautical artifacts.Service was good order at the counter and pick up or they bring the food to you, friendly staff and owner.Conclusion good value for money seafood in a developing area of JC, yes I will go again also BYO"}, {"review_id": "Jw7NzP15RLPYhF5PX-wZpw", "user_id": "yF8icCBqkJGmvrcX0yGbjg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "If you are a seafood lover like I am this is a good spot to try in Jersey City. From the outside you can miss the place entirely if you don't pay attention. There is some parking around the corner from the place.

They have some infused fruit water for the customers to drink. This is a BYOB place and I came here during lunch time. You basically go order in the front and they bring the food to your table. I noticed that you clean up yourself with the two trash bins in the restaurant they provide. I ordered the lobster roll platter with fries, cole slaw, and hush puppies. I also ordered the blackened scallops by itself. It was pretty pricey but you can always expect seafood to be. The lobster roll was delicious and along with the blackened scallops as well. They both came with with a small spring salad mix with both platters. Overall, the food is good but not something you can eat everyday due to the price of seafood. Its really once in a while you can treat yourself food spot. Also, the area is kind of sketchy so I would recommend going with a couple of friends to eat.

After all of the great reviews I've been wanting to try this place for quite a while. We found parking on a side street around the corner so that wasn't too bad. Upon entering we waited at the counter to place our order. We ordered a blackened monkfish platter, a shrimp po' boy, and a side of Mac and cheese. They also have some refreshing complimentary fruit infused water that was great. We gathered our condiments, cutlery, napkins, Â and took a seat in the rear dining room to wait for our order. I tried the Mac and cheese first and it was creamy and very tasty. The Shrimp Po' Boy had perfectly fried jumbo shrimp, the bread was fresh, the veggies crisp and the remoulade sauce was really delicious. The fries were ok too. The monkfish was flaky and delicious as well and I also enjoyed the hush puppies. As far as the restaurant itself I'd definitely say it's a dive, how it looks on the outside you'd never expect such good food inside. Having said that the employees were all great and the food was delicious... I would definitely go again.

Can't get any fresher!Food: I ordered the fried shrimp and oyster po boys initially but while standing there i noticed the taco of the day and figured that would be perfect for the ride home. So i added one of those, fried pickles and hush puppies. Everything fried was awesome! Stayed crispy and warm all the way home. The taco I ate in the car and it was just alright. I wish it had some sort of spice. Sauce alone just wasn't hitting it. Next time I'll ask for it blackened. Coming back for sure. The daily catches change 3-4 times a week.

Came here for dinner on a rainy night with the family and it did not disappoint. When my sister mentioned fresh seafood in Jersey City, I thought she was out of her mind. This place is in the middle of nowhere. Literally. Once you walk in, it has a dive bar feel to it. VERY casual. There are seats by the bar, up front and a bunch of tables in the back. As soon as you walk in, you place your order and take a seat. When your order is ready, someone will call your name and bring the food to you. The lady who took our order was so friendly, patient and informative.We had the lobster roll, grilled tuna platter, fried pickle chips, seafood gumbo and the crack & cheese. Best lobster roll ($18) ever. It was perfectly seasoned and very fresh. Not too much mayo or butter. The bun was packed with lobster. This beats all the other lobster rolls I have had at other famous joints. The fried pickle chips ($7) were so addictive! Best paired with their thai chili aioli sauce! I didn't try the gumbo but my sister loved it. The crack and cheese ($13) was delicious as well and my personal favorite. Who doesn't love mac and cheese and crab cake?! Best combo ever. It is a little pricey but it is very filling. I also tried the hush puppies from the platter and that was pretty good. It tasted like a mix between a cornbread and mashed potatoes.The sauces are made from scratch and the thai chili aioli is my favorite. If I didn't live so far from this place I would've packed some to go! Will definitely be returning whenever I'm in the area. Make sure you try some of that fancy water too!"}, {"review_id": "h2d_6xp7rY0NdvB7siEKQQ", "user_id": "dMhhSGloGEM0mObSm6hvlQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "I've had this place bookmarked for so long, and I am so disappointed in myself that I did not come sooner. If you are an avid seafood lover, this is the joint for you. Fresh seafood, including fresh local catch every day from our shores!First off, I ventured in on a Tuesday evening, and the place were pretty empty, one two other tables being occupied. The set up is very causal, and informal. You pick your seat, menus are on the table, when you are ready, you head up to the register to order & place. No servers to keep costs down, which I am all for. I opt for a blackened chicken over the house salad, which include field greens, roasted tomatoes, fried capers, sunflower seeds, and house dressing. The chicken are so flavorful, and moist, it was truly magical. I'd come back simply for the salad it self! My girlfriend decided to do the lobster roll platter, which include the roll, fresh cut fries, and coleslaw. She was truly a little monster when it came, and demolished it. The lobster roll was a cold roll though, so I am a bit bias because I do prefer hot rolls, however the amount of lobster meat is unbelievable, it was overflowing, when do you ever see that? Next, we decided to share an order of blackened crab cakes. The crab cakes had huge chunks of crab! The blackened flavor adds depth to it. Next time, I will pair it with a salad though. The person who greeted us, and took our order was one of the owners, Troy (If that isn't the name, I am so sorry!), he was super friendly, and informative of the menu items. There actually is even a binder they created of all the different types of fish they serve, and it was honestly cool to learn about what they are offering. And they have \"FANCY\" water for you aka water in jugs infused with fruit. My water was infused with pineapple, and it was quite fancy and delicious! The experience was overall a fantastic one, the food, vibe and people were all great."}, {"review_id": "-FSjT2xD8rNJDyOw-Yfeug", "user_id": "5AySt8pgPB9qzu_pxiFuHg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "Heard of this place by word of mouth and saw it here on Yelp and finally gave it a try tonight.

Tucked away from downtown, this divey seafood place is worth the trek. It's bigger than I'd imagined, with a front area and a much larger dining room in the back.We brought the kiddos and they had a great time with the crayons and coloring books the waitress brought over. You order off the menu based on what the catches of the day are and they shuttle the food over to your table when ready. We ordered the fried pickles, a shrimp po boy, and the grilled fish. Fried pickles were yum, and I think I tried every sauce off the sauce table (all good). Pickles were perfectly breaded and the ratio of breading to pickle was awesome.The shrimp po boy didn't disappoint - and surprisingly on par with some of the best po boys we've had in New Orleans. Bread was good, shrimp was meaty and well flavored, and ratios of fillings to bread was right. Grilled fish was delish too. Only minus was the fries. They handcut their fries which means the fries have to be fried and delivered to your table almost right away because the longer they cool, the tougher they get which was the case for us. But kudos to them for making the effort to handcut fries!

I don't eat fish, but I saw that they had a few vegetarian options on the menu, so I was still looking forward to it.We almost missed the restaurant when we arrived - it's at the corner of a very dimly lit intersection and pretty easy to miss at night. We walked in and it was much smaller than expected, but really cozy - what I would expect from a local seafood shack in a fisherman's village. My family used to vacation in Gloucester aka home of the Gorton's fisherman and this definitely reminded me of my summers there as a kid.The servers were extremely helpful in explaining the different options, the three different fresh catch of the day that are overnighted from different locations, and how they recommended each one cooked. She showed us where their \"fancy\" water with strawberries and basil was and all of the different sauces. We ended up ordering fried pickles, mac and cheese, fried mahi mahi poboy, and a grilled vegetable platter. The HUGE serving of fried pickles was so crispy and not at all greasy (we ended up with leftovers of this). The mac and cheese was alright - probably our least favorite dish of the night - just kind of average. The mahi mahi was light, not fishy at all, fried perfectly and the portion was so generous my boyfriend could barely fit the whole poboy in his mouth. It came with fries, as did the grilled vegetables, and they were well seasoned, but could have been a little hotter.I had no expectations for the veggies, but they were so flavorful and you could taste the char on them, which I love. The hush puppies on the side were out of this world, especially with the honey butter. The jicama apple slaw was also really delicious. In fact, it was the first slaw that I actually liked.Overall, you can't beat the quality and quantity of the food here for the prices they're selling them at. Most of the items on the menu cap out at $12 and that is an entree with a side with the exception of the lobster. Unbeatable deal.Oh, also, we didn't know it was BYOB before coming, so heads up! Otherwise they have the number of a local liquor store that will deliver."}, {"review_id": "cYowqh1wWryHqtbx-FXPdQ", "user_id": "U64HvXaOCnheuy901GAUyw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "If you want fresh seafood THIS IS THE PLACE!
