Every time I come to Montana I make a point to stop at the Good Food Store. Their grocery selection is spectacular and their Deli is out of this world. Even the most food sensitive individuals will find they can find something to eat here without having to suffer through tasteless or undesirable options. Good food store also has a lovely cafe for all of your coffee craving, fresh smoothie, daily juicing needs. Baked goods are delicious and offer a large array of vegan and gluten free options. The staff are always very friendly and knowledgeable. Don't be afraid to ask for help.Stop by once and I guarantee you will make any excuse to stop by every time you can."}, {"review_id": "NoSBkCpm3-R0ETP_7MoBQw", "user_id": "b8Z2N_iv2j8rZy3Q8_kPfw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "While there are some pros and cons, I do feel one outweighs the other. The staff is very friendly and helpful, especially at the front desk; although, I did find one bad apple - a cashier - who let a bad day get the best of her. The food selection is unbeatable considering the competition, but when it comes to the prices, Good Food Store sometimes seems like a rabbit in a race won by a turtle - it's a hit-or-miss. The prepared food section offers a pretty decent variety of options that are fairly priced, especially when it comes to their hot-and-ready vegetarian pizza selection; but, if you're in the mood for dessert too, you may find yourself paying more than twice as much for something less than half the size. Altogether, it feels pretty good to shop at Good Food Store. It's not the best, but it's still pretty good."}, {"review_id": "gLI5X65WuHJt4_uGyw9vfw", "user_id": "7FpIGmlgLiFLbLf3V_A21g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "It amazes me that this place is so popular. I know it hits Missoula's sweet spot but the prices are amazingly high for groceries and I see people buying specialty dog food there. We went in on the recommendation of our daughter who loves their Deli food. The food in the Deli is okay but nothing to write home about and the prices are just incredible for what you can get elsewhere the same quality and far less. I guess there are lots of snowflakes who have the money to support it."}, {"review_id": "D3biKERwh3peFLQfcTpqYg", "user_id": "b2EKKi3vc995j01rYYYtYg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Good food only problem is that very popular and kinda busy.

My husband and I came in to get lunch and ordered from the sandwich counter. They had great vegan options, including Tempeh, Tofu, Veganaise and GoVeggie Cheese. They have a huge buffet style section, some vegan options as well. The store is a good size, well laid out and clean. I didn't do any other shopping, just lunch but I like the store.

Most likely in the order too. That's the essentials in my house.Great selection at their cheese counter, they're always out of burrata for some reason but there's plenty to select from. The freshest fish in Missoula here and the butchers are always super helpful and friendly. Bakery is amazing, excellent find for treats, breads, and rolls. Wine selection, oh how I love thee. A little bit for everyone but amazing import selection with fair prices. I wish the produce section had just a little bit more, I know they focus on what's seasonal now and organic but it just feels like it lacks most days. It is definitely the most expensive produce in town too. I don't consistently shop here but Good Food Store is definitely the store for the select items and it's worth the price most days for quality."}, {"review_id": "QveLNtZykzgoftQGjc99OA", "user_id": "1A1xAfIytuGADGa-05zjzg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/18/2017", "text": "My go to grocery store when in Missoula, outstanding quality food and great prices.Simply put, the place lives up to the name.

Better than a \"Whole Paycheck\" (Whole Foods), less crunchy than a local co-op, it has all the things for those on special diets or those just wanting organic and a higher quality of product.This store, while as expensive as the main competitor, is the perfect place to buy gluten free, paleo, organic, probiotic, no sugar, lactose intolerant and other food allergy specialty foods. In addition to an amazing bin section, it has some of the most gorgeous produce, a full service deli, cheese, meat and coffee bar (which is excellent coffee, btw) a bakery, as well as a salad bar, hot bar, olive and soup bars. There are many options, sometimes so many I cannot decide and end up spending 3x the normal amount just in my indecision.There is a enormous wine and beer section, highlighting local brews and wineries from the area, and a warm cafe area. There are seats outside, and during the summer it is a gorgeous spot to sit, eat, drink coffee or relax. This visit, it hovered around 10 degrees with snow so I took a pass on the outside views. Also, a very well stocked natural herbs and organic wellness products.Staff is extremely attentive and involved. In each section, there was a friendly smile and eagerness to help you find the perfect item. They must treat their employees like gold, or pay them well, or both, because I have never had less than stellar customer service.The trade off is the high prices, but sometimes you do get what you pay for."}, {"review_id": "AgYnv6spuYQ_XxnysXL06A", "user_id": "k1w5WnbHMN3Ur62novFimA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/28/2017", "text": "It's Missoula's \"Whole Foods\".
