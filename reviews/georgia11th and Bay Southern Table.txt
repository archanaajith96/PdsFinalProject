Decided to give this place a try based on their location and was impressed from the moment I walked in till I left. Sat at the bar and immediately was offered a menu and the girl begins the bar was ready to take my drink order. The complementary biscuits and jam were delicious as a small start up dish. I got the pan seared redfish which was served with a wide range of veggies."}, {"review_id": "VtTOSQBAFHxnNizBpsKM6w", "user_id": "C1FlWzWHTYFtQf8xIWphLw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Delicious, local, and reasonably priced? What more can a person ask for?!I have been several times with family, friends, and/or coworkers. Each time, everyone in the party has been very pleased with our food. Personally, the scallops are my absolute favorite. My husband is a big fan of the oysters. I love that they have a great selection of local beers, too. Also, as an added bonus, the little biscuits they bring as an appetizer are always delicious-- nice and fluffy!11th and Bay is also perfectly located, right near the water. A great place to stop in for a bite after a day on the river or enjoying the riverwalk!"}, {"review_id": "9qWvI5CT-toz9oO5E4G1ZQ", "user_id": "J23x-Y2E6URxCfbNKCxh8A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "We thoroughly enjoyed last nights dinner at 11th and Bay. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. We started out with the smoked whitefish dip that was devoured in minutes because it was so good we couldn't stop eating it. The warm biscuits that they bring out with a basil jam was delicious. I wanted to take home a jar of that jam; it was that good. I originally wanted the Soul burger but was told it was unavailable; would've been nice to have been told that at the beginning but I opted for the Lamb chops and my husband had the Osso Bucco. Both we're outstanding. My lamb chops were cooked to a perfect medium rare temperature. And the Osso Bucco was fork tender. For dessert we shared the creme brûlée which was delicious as well. The service was a little slow, our server would disappear at times and wouldn't return to check on us as often as we would have liked. But the overall service was good. We will definitely be returning her and hopefully soon! Couple mentions; they only serve Oysters Monday - Friday. And they run out of the Soul Burger pretty quickly, so if that what you're going for. Keep that in mind."}, {"review_id": "EtldZAmD97yykz3AKZ8ZCg", "user_id": "P9EK1Lr9ZXy8OdiFW_cAQQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "Love this place, there is ALWAYS a wait.

It was awesome! They have a bit of a wait on the weekend so calling ahead for a reservation is highly recommended. I came on a weekday and had zero issue with being sat right away. The staff from start to finish were superb! I had their fresh shucked oysters and talk about delicious! They were so light and tasty. The waitress didn't lie when she said they were made to order! I had their beet salad which was a great pairing with the oysters and my main course was the NY strip. My steak was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. The chef definitely knows how to prepare the food. The wine pairing was perfect with every course as well. It was definitely worth the price because the food was delicious and the staffs knowledge made it worthwhile."}, {"review_id": "8rHwsXrwk2_FJOyVXrwb-w", "user_id": "KjiFT7-KTT4FcqLePK6quw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "We came here on a Friday night for some drinks and appetizers.

We were seated. We waited. NO ONE came to our table. We waited 15 minutes and the men with the group decided to take our business elsewhere. The decor is beautiful. Constructed of all repurposed material. Open ceilings with ducts exposed. They have farm tables and small tables. Very nicely designed. The menu sounded great. I was intrigued by the chicken and waffles. And the tequila drink. Unfortunately due to lack of service I didn't get to imbibe on anything from 11th and Bay.

I was a bit indecisive on seating when I arrived but our host was patient and willing to cooperate after we requested a switch from outdoor seating to indoor seating. The ambiance was incredible and the lighting was perfect for an intimate meal with friends and family. I didn't sit at the bar but appreciated the decorative concept and neatly arranged liquor selection. The dining floor had a neat layout. The tables were seemingly sporadic but everyone had ample space and no seating areas seemed too closed off from others. This aided in comfortable dining as well. The biscuit and apple butter combo was a great start to a delicious meal. The topping was just right and not too overpowering or sweet to take away from the mini biscuits. While waiting for our meal we enjoy a glass of wine and a Jack Daniels on the rocks - nothing special, although the drink menu didn't look half bad. I had the Redfish, cooked perfectly, accompanied by fresh greens and a unique form of grits I'd never tried.  It also included citrus flavored peas to help balance all of the salty flavors. Everything paired well. My fiance had the Fried Seafood Platter which included fried catfish (I believe), fried shrimp, hush puppies and a coleslaw. The fish was a little tough, perhaps a little overcooked but the taste made up for that. The shrimp were a nice size and the hush puppies were tasty. She didn't care much for the flavor of the slaw but I thought that it was a refreshing addition.Our waitress was quick and polite, the prices were great, and the food satisfactory. I would definitely come back here to eat!"}, {"review_id": "kAIxA3NN0Yw_HkDKva6PUw", "user_id": "3Gd7C9R39K-dIR_YJXvWBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "This is was my first time here and I would definitely rate this as one of my top 5 spots in Columbus and a new favorite.

It was Friday night and the restaurant was 50% occupied. We found this weird considering the fact that the big parking lot and street parking were full. Service was inconsistent and our server forgetful. He came over our table to apologize and say \"it is everything ok?\". We had to remind him to bring what he offered minutes ago. Food though did not meet our expectations. The southern caprese appetizer was the dish we liked the most. When we ordered our entrees, the restaurant was out of some items (Oysters, and some beer). Server did not offer any choice but say \"sorry\". The quality and the size of the Shrimp N' Grits entree did not match the expensive price tag. It was not a flavorful dish, more on the bland side. Fried chicken was ok but needed the chutney to taste better. Again price did not meet the expectations. My family loved the renovated old building look. The decor is definitely very inviting. The ambience inside the restaurant is great. However, I will probably not come back because the food experience was nothing to write home about. They need to train better the staff so they can offer a better quality service for the price and location."}, {"review_id": "uGAQx-Av5aU2RT4KD3XF6Q", "user_id": "SgYPkh4THEXwzHsGgDbEoQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "The chicken and waffles are so good plus the biscuits and peach basil jam.

The food was fabulous, the Omaha Brewery draft delicious, and the setting was great - close to the riverfront area.
