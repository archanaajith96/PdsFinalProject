I have to admit that I LOVE diner food, though living in Southern California, It's hard to find a hard-core diner!!! Well here it is folks, came here for a research conference and I believe I started out my trip with a highlight that will be tough to beat! I ordered the chicken fried steak which came with hash browns, 2 eggs, and your choice of bread which they of course butter up for you!Anyhow this was the best chicken fried steak you could imagine; nice and crispy on the outside, oh so moist, tender and well seasoned in the Inside with the right touch of kicked in spice! And that sausage gravy on top.... ohhh hell noooo.... and Mr. Hashbrowns? Delicious! Someone mentioned that they preferred theirs crispier, which I would have to agree, but they did it oh so perfectly that I have to hand it to the purists of this place. Anyhow, my husband is crazy jealous as I have sent him the before and aftermath of this battle! Satellite Diner 1, Caroline 0  I'll be back! Was a bit disappointed in my coffee which seamed watered down, they needed to add some more roast to it! Come on, this is Washington, lol! Oh well everyone hs their days and I LOVED the food here!!!"}, {"review_id": "ijZ8vjd5BlXFxxDzHSx5AQ", "user_id": "EU2OpuOh9BgDm2ojHgcaOg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "The Satellite Diner is a cool, funky little place downtown that has a great breakfast menu that's served all day and other diner fare. The bar side seems cool enough but I didn't venture over as I was there to eat. The food was pretty food and I could see myself grabbing a bite before enjoy a few adult beverages later on. It's downtown, so parking may be a bit of a challenge, but if you're already down there for other activities, it's not a bad place to pre-game and grab a bite."}, {"review_id": "9sJa2GaQdlF9PhGgNnWF6Q", "user_id": "nbPN5ahpmR0wdObhZsf6xg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "One of my favorite late night and breakfast spots from back when I lived in Spokane. Was just back for a quick weekend trip, first time in over a decade, and figured this was a perfect spot for breakfast close to our hotel.  They were training a new cook that morning but warned us that they were running really behind on orders, that left us the choice to stay or not so was greatly appreciated. Luckily, though hungry, we were not in a rush that morning so decided to wait, and it was definitely worth it as it was as delicious as I remembered.  Love the amazing and unique pancakes, almost like they use malted waffle batter but as a thin pancake, had forgotten how good they are.  Coffee was good, service was attentive, we were forewarned about the issues so that was not a problem for us, and we left full and happy."}, {"review_id": "ppuo2eu1PCLMPWAuS8GASA", "user_id": "U5o67DKc-muUnn0aYW5J6A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "The Satellite Diner was an amazing experience. This Diner is an American classic, I had the Ham & cheese omelet with hash browns, it was one of the best omelets I have ever had, if not the best I've ever had.

Haven't had a bad item yet.  Heck, even mix it up a bit. Get some pancakes to go along with your beer....they won't judge you, and it's actually not bad.Some of my go to items???- The homemade soups, especially the lasagna soup on Wednesday- Grilled pesto and cheese- Any of the burgers- Breakfast sliders- Grilled ham and cheese- jalapeno bacon!- bacon chocolate chip cookiesBy yourself or with friends, the Satellite doesn't disappoint."}, {"review_id": "Evj14TFSTrUFKHDeksK1Cg", "user_id": "nsEfVMG4jR_N0VihObPT9A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "First time here for breakfast.

Look no further than Satellite. We walked here from our hotel nearby for an early morning, courtesy of our early rising toddler, breakfast. Breakfast can be a tough meal out for little ones so I was pleased to find they had crayons  and placemats at the ready. Service was friendly, quick and efficient and the toddler pancakes were served with a blueberry smiley face - a sure hit with the younger crowd. There are tons of the typical breakfast options on the menu from eggs to pancakes to oatmeal. I had an omelette with bacon and cheese which was a huge portion and really good. The hash browns could have been crispier. But otherwise this is a good choice for breakfast."}, {"review_id": "IZMtF1WC7XfJj7UNwBOPvw", "user_id": "OxTQ9Ov4Lon8MXt4lNNfOw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2017", "text": "Hello to the diner eating lifestyle in downtown Spokane!It was a Saturday evening, and we were at a Cirque Du Solei show. We kept figuring out what to eat for dinner when we finally realized that most restaurants seemed to close by 10 PM. It was already 9:55 PM. I happened to come across Satellite Diner in downtown Spokane, and I saw the good ratings plus the awesome all-night opening hours. Let's be honest here. I don't do diners a lot. I thought it'd be a good experience for me since I need to be casual for once and quit going to fancy restaurants for a break (haha). Apparently, this diner is connected to a bar. You can either sit at the bar (there're booths available) or at the diner itself. The food itself was very good in portion and flavor. Duuhhhh! Anything is good with cheese, cream, and gravy! I let my craving giving in by ordering gravy biscuit. Hello! I devoured that thing without any mercy. My boyfriend had his jucy burger in buttery buns and potato fries. It was the best decision for the late-night munchies. Before I walked out, the diner (or the bar) blasted Fetty Wap's Trap Queen. I liked that! It was lit! Haha!"}, {"review_id": "IXtGy1ZNup_e44jB0oT2yw", "user_id": "ivOEI9h-h21WylmiiOS5Kw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "Came mid morning on a Saturday, was greeted and asked to wait not blocking the door or entrance to bar, but there isn't really anywhere else to wait. Told wait was about 15-20 minutes. After about 5 more minutes another server told us that that there was a 40 minute wait for food. Menus were dropped, in needed of a good cleaning but the coffee was decent and server made sure our water glasses stayed full. When she pressured us to order, she mentioned food would take 40 minutes. Ended up waiting an hour. Portions are large, restaurant is busy and loud, floors are still greasy and slightly hazardous. Would I go there again, maybe.

Got some weird looks from the locals like WTH are Asian people doing in Spokane? But they were harmless. Staff was friendly and cool. Ordered the country fried steak with hash browns, sunny side two eggs, and English muffin. The CFS was one of the best I've had. It was thicker than usual which to me is good and the batter was crispy and delicious. Meat was tenderized and good. Hash browns were cooked with a lot of butter so didn't come out as crispy as I would have liked but at 1 am after a long flight I really couldn't complain. English muffin came out of a bag but was better than your run of the mill orowheat or Thomas's. About $14 for the whole shebang. Other than the weird looks everything was cool."}, {"review_id": "I7c1BltDUO_anxZ-4oTv5w", "user_id": "sIwTezVKMhCAhHmUT9VoDw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/16/2017", "text": "We have always been hesitant to bring the kiddos here, now I wish we would have done it sooner!

A Sunday evening seemed like the best time to come back in the future based on the emptiness at that time. Food was at our table within 10 minutes and perfect! The food was of course hot just what we all had been had been craving and more! I would like to repeat our server was as sweet as they come.
