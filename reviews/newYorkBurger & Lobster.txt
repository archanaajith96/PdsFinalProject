This place overprices their burgers and the quality of their beef isn't so great. It pretty much tastes like your classic Applebee's burger, except you have to pay $12 more.

When the bill came she asked us \"what kind of tip do you want to leave? 18%, 20% or 22%? I'll just write it in for you, it's easier for me.\" I initially said \"no thanks, I'll just write it in myself,\" and she actually pushed back! I decided to just let it go because I did not want to cause a scene. I thought that she was just going to add it into the bill electronically, but she literally wrote out the tip in pen and did the math for us. To boot, the 18,20,22% tip calculations were already on the bill!In my decades of going to restaurants I've never experienced this before. Her asking (and really what she's doing is guilting the customer into feeling like they need to leave the tip that she asked for) is a terrible practice, and quite frankly it's very insulting. Oh and by the way -- she forgot to put in one of our meals. And she was nowhere to be found to tell her that a meal was missing, and we had to ask another waiter that was walking around. But that type of thing happens all the time. Not mad about that. It's just funny how someone can be so entitled to think they deserve whatever tip they choose."}, {"review_id": "eOjlQyu_Wqjr1tnzVXGimg", "user_id": "cY1WWo-FB-M9AlPIxYdOHQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Love the concept here. What do they serve? Burgers & Lobsters!! The place is large, with a fun vibe. We were promptly seated & a waitress quickly brought over water. Ordered: 2x Lobster Bisque ($10 ea)2 LB Lobster with lemon garlic butter ($42)The Beast Burger ($31)Prosecco ($13)Where can you get a 2lb lobster in Manhattan for $42? I also love that everything is served with fries and salad. Truly adds a little extra value. The lobster bisque hit the spot, and had a decent portion of lobster meat. The lemon garlic butter was delicious, normally I would need to squeeze a decent amount of lemon on my lobster, and this took that step out of the process.  My husband enjoyed his burger. Seafood is not his thing - but being in a place where lobster is in the name, he had to try some. Personally, I dont understand the surf and turf combo sandwiched up, but to each their own! The prosecco was meh, the brand was Carpene, so I know to skip that next time. Will be back for sure, seems like a great place for a large group to get together."}, {"review_id": "p6tPDs3GTqMv5dDxv_hDpg", "user_id": "9C-KJOsxuUauCEj0tdbpjQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Heaven for lobster lovers. Oh and if you are into burgers. There r basically 3 items on Menu: lobsters, burger and lobster roll. You can choose steamed or grilled lobsters, and clear butter or lemon garlic garden for dipping sauce. They give you all the tools you need to crack the lobsters so dont you worry. Burgers are huge. I didnt try it so this piece of review is to be updated in the future, cuz im definitely coming back.Lobster for $30, Lobster + burgers+drink for $35(wat this is such a great deal). If you r not hungry at all you can get lobster roll. Good for small party or large bday parties. There were at least 3 bday parties happening while i dine there. You can also take funny pictures with props downstairs. Good for the gram and for the memory."}, {"review_id": "pKOKv4_AToK4p0tQeFWbKw", "user_id": "BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "I ate here out of sheer hunger when a serious case of the hangries struck on a humid, sweltering New York day and Burger & Lobster was the first air conditioned sit down restaurant I saw. I had zero expectations so I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of my meal. The massive restaurant has plenty of seating so I can't imagine there ever being a reason you'd have to wait to eat here. The menu was large but not confusing and since it's always a good policy to order whatever is in a restaurant's name, I got the burger and lobster. My burger (a pitiful 5 ounces of meat) was good but not memorable. I asked for my bacon crispy and it was, but for the price I wish I had a choice of something other than Kraft singles \"cheesefood.\" No real cheddar or swiss? That's blasphemy when it comes to a real burger lover! My burger was topped with a lobster, which was a cool gimmick. I ate the seafood and beef separately but I did see some folks chowing down with it all in one bite. To each his own! I broke bad and ordered a side of fries and they were fantastic. Hot and crisp and salty. I also ordered a $13 glass of prosecco but I was super disappointed when our server brought out a can of prosecco. I wouldn't have ordered it if I knew it was a low quality sparkling wine out of a can. Their iced tea was fresh brewed and delicious, served with plenty of ice and a big lemon wedge. HOWEVER, drinks are charged PER GLASS so my one iced tea with one refill was a whopping $6. Minus another star for that. The prices are high because 1. lobster is in most of the dishes and 2. this is New York City. Our lunch for two cost $109 BEFORE tax and tip! Everything could've been cleaner and the joint looked as if it needed a good scrubbing, so I'm docking a star for that. The table was sticky and there were crumbs all over. The restrooms were bad too. I understand this is a big city, but I always worry that if the dining room and restrooms are dirty, the kitchen must be a mess too."}, {"review_id": "HiXsd94m3qJ4q4gnDDMStg", "user_id": "nynCdsDYV1yQm69fkkCdwg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "So disappointed!

If you don't know, the Beast Burger is a 10oz beef blend created by the restaurant along with pieces of grilled lobster, melted cheese and truffle mayo. Sounds great right? Well... it was super dry, the cheese was overpowering any tastes and I ordered Medium Rare for the burger so that's supposed to be juicy. I tried dipping it in ketchup then I had to order a side of lemon garlic butter (delicious) just to finish it. Hauling down a waiter/waitress for the lemon garlic butter took around 5 mins since everyone's walking quickly and laser focused on what they're doing but not on the customer. Our waiter just tried to rush us out of the restaurant when approached about my disappointment with the Beast burger by bringing us the bill... I was debating between The Beast & the Combo For 1 which is your choice of a 1lb lobster steamed/grilled  with a 6oz burger and fries and salad. My friend got the Combo For 1 which I usually get the Original Lobster steamed. Should've gotten the Combo For 1 *sigh* because my friend enjoyed the heck out of that while I had the sad Beast Burger."}, {"review_id": "fBtNEUwNO1_yE-tcCuZcwg", "user_id": "VtFmy8XwOEWBjnr7EshHFQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "I came here around 5pm Saturday for an appetizer, drink and dessert. The place was empty and we were seated immediately. I do have to admit the restaurant looks better at night. We had the Burger Bite which came with a mayo sauce and the Lobster Bite which came with a sweet sauce. Both were delicious! I preferred the burger cause it was juicy, full of flavor and so addicting. The lobster was not as memorable in comparison. For drinks we had The Fling and The Ball Drop. Both were good and strong. They don't have an actual dessert menu but if you ask some options from what I remember include chocolate mousse and gelato. We ended with a Strawberry Cheesecake Mousse. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GET THIS!!! It was small and a bit pricey ($7) but it was shockingly good. The strawberries tasted fresh, the cream was light and the graham cracker bottom was a nice touch. I so sad that it was gone in seconds. I'm sure even if you are stuffed from dinner, you can definitely fit this small treat! I've had their burger, lobster and lobster roll in the past back when it used to just be $20 each. The menu sure has changed and it's still just as delicious.

We started with lobster bites, which were just bad. They were cold and had a strange consistency. I had the po boy, which was fairly flavorless, while my husband had a burger. Their menu options for adding to burgers are limited- you won't be able to add peppers or mustard for instance. Also, they don't have regular sodas, which, believe it or not, go really well with both burgers and lobsters.

Had the seven samurai lobster roll and it was solid. Only small complaint was that mine was a little understuffed compared to the others which were positively overflowing with meat. It was still very tasty so it didn't detract too much from the experience, but I would hope that it was just a fluke. Per the server's recommendation, I got it with a side of lemon butter which was a little naughty but oh-so-tasty, especially as a dip for the fries or the already buttery brioche roll.The servings are not small, but honestly not as huge as they seem. It comes out plated on a big tray and kind of spread out which gives you the illusion that you are getting a ton of food. Still, for ~$20 including fries and a salad, it is a decent value for what you get.Would love to come back next time with a few friends and try \"the tower.\" ;)"}, {"review_id": "siAhUFBUHw-tSUagBa4Hew", "user_id": "6n4zKJJFjWWo5nUDs0b-KA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Finally got to give this place a try after having it bookmarked for over 2 years! We arrived for lunch at around 12 on a weekday and there was no wait for a table for 2. It's a pretty spacious venue so I don't think there would ever be a long wait but I guess it wouldn't hurt to make a reservation anyway just in case. Very comfy booth seating available and the tables/utensils were clean. Our server Brian was literally the best! I go out to eat a lot (surprise surprise) and the service here was definitely the best I've encountered at any restaurant. Super friendly, always checked up on us, and made sure all our needs were met. We were going to share 2 of the entrees and when we ordered, he even offered to help us cut the entrees in half to make it easier for us to share. How thoughtful! In terms of the food, we ordered:The original burger- I wouldn't go as far as deeming it the best burger I've ever had but it was definitely remarkable. It may look small but it's really filling. We requested the patty to be cooked medium rare and it was done perfectly. Condiments all complimented each other very well. It sort of reminded me of a grass-fed beef burger that I had at BRGR.The original lobster roll- Hmm kind of on the fence with this one. To start, the roll was nicely buttered and delicious. As for the lobster itself, I would say I really liked the texture of it, even more than the one I had in Boston. However, the flavor was a little lacking. The menu says there's Japanese mayo added to it but I couldn't really taste it? Because of this, it ended up tasting a little bland. Had to add some lemon juice to it just to give it some flavor.Both entrees came with fries and a salad. The salad was pretty good but the fries were a little underwhelming. They were too thin and greasy. Sort of like McDonald's fries but slightly better.I would say this was decent meal. I definitely liked the burger more than the lobster roll. Prices may seem expensive but I think they're standard. For comparison, here it's $25 for a lobster roll, fries, and a salad while in Boston's Quincy Market it's $29 for a lobster roll and a clam chowder. $20 may seem like a lot for a burger but bear in mind that a burger at Bareburger is close to $15 just for the burger. Here you're also getting fries and salad in addition to the burger. Overall, food was ok. I think what made this a really enjoyable dining experience was the service. Top notch!"}, {"review_id": "dmX2ciozBaBDz9QKuay9oQ", "user_id": "1Fz_cBKvFGyTZ4YYZkQ_6A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Sorry to disappoint, but a better name for this place is \"Average Burger & Equally Average Lobster\". If I had to dive into the details, I ordered the Burger and Lobster (shocker). The burger tasted of equivalent quality of Five Guys (without all the delicious toppings you get on a Five Guys Burger). The Lobster was just mediocre, couldn't give it much of a comparison. The Fries tasted like a less addictive McDonald's Fries. The place was small, crowded, and HOT. It was the Time Square location, so I am curious if the Union Square location shares the same deficiencies as this location (because I heard good things about that location).On the bright side, the customer service was quite good.

Although pricey, it is worth the bucks because you get a ton of high quality food. Had to knock off a star for the LONG wait and unwelcoming host.

I ordered the Seven Samurai Lobster Roll (chilled lobster dressed in ginger mayo with cucumbers, cabbage, and togarashi) with a Madison Park Punch. My friend got the 1 pound lobster, grilled. Honestly, I was satisfied with my order, except I wish the lobster was served warm instead of chilled. The brioche was a good complement as the bread of the sandwich. Very light (because of the veggies) but filling. My friend though - poor her :( the one pound lobster she ordered grilled came literally charred. Also it was very hard to get the meat off. Usually she finishes before I finish. She spent almost 20 minutes just trying to get the meat off - what little remained that wasn't charred.
