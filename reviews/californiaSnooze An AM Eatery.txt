Took a bite of my friends omg French toast and died & went to heaven. You definitely will need to have a sweet tooth but sooo tasty with my savory Benedict meal. Iced chai was great, too!

Snooze AM is a good name since they open at 5:30 am! We got there at 6:30 and I thought that was early. We took Lyft so didn't have to worry about parking. We only had 40 minutes so the person at the door suggested our sitting at the counter. We were greeted with menus and we told the server about our time crunch. She said no problem if we ordered now, so we did. We chose pancakes (hubs asked for plain) and I selected eggs, bacon and hash browns. The coffee came and was good and in a bright yellow mug that would wake me up even if it didn't contain caffeine. The food arrived fast and looked good. There were 3 eggs, 3 bacon and a strange, round has brown. I hate wasting food but couldn't eat all the eggs. We shared the bacon so that was fine. The hash browns were interesting in theory but had only a slight brown on outside and inside was not browned and not my favorite. The pancakes had a sweet flavor-maybe vanilla, which made it a too sweet for my husband. Maybe our fault for not having the time to read the menu. I really appreciate the staff for helping get food in our gullets fast. I see all the good reviews and hope I get to come here again to try something else...just maybe not so early."}, {"review_id": "MpcTccsaSjIYrrFt4DXgzA", "user_id": "BgeiRH8aZajFliVuRS6QtA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Obsessed! Came based on my fellow Yelpers reviews on my vacation and you didn't disappoint!Expect difficult parking and a wait. But know it's worth it. Park on street if you're lucky, or you can grab a garage/lot. We waited about 30-45 mins on a Friday morning but totally worth it. The vibe is awesome, this location is super open and lofty. There are couches and booths or high tops and a full serve bar. Fun brunchy drinks!Menu is great and unique! Everything everyone got was big and looked delicious.

Not hot and freshly toasted, almost like I had been served forgotten cold toast.The OMG French Toast, which I had been looking forward to the most, was not nearly as impressive as the last time I had it. It was good but nothing special. The breakfast burrito was big and good, I strongly recommend the green sauce and adding avocado and/or some meat to the burrito (super bummer that not one of those is included in the price) The food was all good but nothing had the wow factor that I expect from Snooze. I'll be back, but I hope next time the food deserves the hype, the wait time, and the price."}, {"review_id": "mHta1A5a5e10edMWSpsyvg", "user_id": "Rm7fMYFT-EIUdUjiqnw3bg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This is an updated review. I still stand by my opinions on the amazing food and waitlist. But after visiting again, the service was much more polite and friendly. Our table was attended to fill coffee and waters. It did not take long to put in our orders or receive food. Definitely a better experience than the last, and I'm happy that I gave Snooze another chance.FOOD:I had the blueberry danish pancakes, which were amazing. The pancakes are soft, fluffy, & buttery. Then add that blueberry cream cheese topping and you have a pancake that is to die for. I also had the caprese benedict which was also amazing, I have had many of the other benedicts but I think the caprese may be my new favorite. The great part about Snooze that I love is that you can do half orders on their pancakes and benedicts. So instead of 2 flapjacks in one pancake order you can get a half, and only receive 1 pancake. Same for the benedicts. This is great for me, who loves the savory and sweet aspects to breakfast. WAITLIST:It is no secret that Snooze always has an enormous waiting list. We waited about 2 hours to be seating and then the service was actually quite slow to receive out food. Maybe an hour wait is worth the food...but 2? That's pushing it. However, if you do intend to bare the wait they do have complimentary coffee inside."}, {"review_id": "rxK5rRlsn-0c2Da_TWkESQ", "user_id": "vF4kLTg3W9dO4tSdXLWMLw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "If you're in the mood for dessert for breakfast or lunch, the pancakes at Snooze will NOT put you to sleep.

Breakfast!The restaurant usually has a line out the door, but if you check Yelp's online 'Waitlist' & get on that before heading out, you'll get there just in time for your seating to be ready. And that's just what we did. Walked right in..sat right down in a comfy booth! There is also outside seating in front, along Fifth Avenue, if you so choose to sit out in San Diego's always perfect weather. I had what was described in the menu as the \"Ham Benedict III: The classic evolved with our signature English muffin topped with shaved hickory smoked ham, perfectly poached cage free eggs and smoked cheddar hollandaise.\" Snooze has about a half-dozen or so different Bennies & if you can't make up your mind, it's fine with them if you want to split them into two different variations. Every Benedict comes with a round hash brown patty-type of thing that has a subtle rosemary herb flavor throughout. The outside has a nicely-browned crisp on it & when you break it apart, it's perfectly cooked real-deal potatoes smell & taste absolutely heavenly. The Ham: Oooh, that Tender Belly Ham! The thinly piled smoked hickory ham is placed over crisped English muffins & that's when it all starts to come together with a subtle crisp on the edges of the ham. The ham has a slightly sweet & moist-tender mouth feel.Next, it is neatly combined with two nicely poached & perfectly formed cage free eggs placed on top. It all comes together with their Smoked Cheddar Hollandaise poured over-top & sprinkled with a dusting of Smoked Paprika. When I cut into the eggs, I was pleased with the perfect amount of runniness to the yolks that allowed me to mix it with every component on my plate. I also chose to have a side of Sausage, which came with three links. The Sausage had a little kick of spiciness to it that was very tasty. If it was browned a tad more, it would've been perfect in my opinion. It still was very good & I enjoyed it along with the other components of my breakfast. To drink, I completed my breakfast with a nice big glass of iced tea. Best Benedict in town! Everything about that Benny was perfection!Since Snooze encourages their customers to feel free to customize their meals, it shows they're just the kind of laid-back that I love. Can't wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "VCaml_2aF1GGigsTiaKuDA", "user_id": "HeiAMoNFdLDPrDoQ97VnPw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "This is an overly popular brunch spot, with horrendous waits on weekends.

Staff was pretty nice and there's not many people in at that timeI decided on the breakfast tacos. They come with egg, hash browns, a chili sauce, green onion, and cheese. You get 3 of them, and well, they're just okay. The size isn't too impressive, and they may not fill you up completely if you're hungry.

The perfect amount of sweetness! Pineapple upside down pancake - good, not very sweet but not something I must have. The OMG French toast - the name says it all.. OMG. This French toast is tasty y'all. If you like French toast.. this is a must! Their current special pancake of the day was blueberry batter pancake. This has banana whip cream. The pancakes were good, not a must, but the banana whip cream? So good! I had a side of hash browns and egg over medium. They cooked the egg perfectly.

These are only seasonal so I had to think about what sounded good to me. ~~~~~~~Instead I got chocolate chip pancakes and the girl got me the chocolate and maple syrup. Here's the thing. I would rather of used just the maple syrup. It was sugar overload. The maple syrup would've been better than both. ~~~~The waiter came by and checked up on us and I told him the pancake were too sweet with the additions. He asked me if I wanted something else. I asked him if he could read off the bennies. Then I asked him for the traditional. There are plenty to choose from. ~~~~~~~~~~~~I loved them for several reasons the ham was super tender and had some bites of crispiness throughout both bennies. The hollandaise sauce needed some salt but it had a thin texture that I liked. I thought there was just enough paprika sprinkled on top that hit the back of the throat that I enjoyed. The eggs were huge and there was a lot of flavor after I took the knife to pop open the eggs. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ THE ROSEMARY HASH BROWNS ~~~~These were served in a tall circular disc. I thought these were better than house made potatoes. The bite was spot on. I used them to go along with my bennies. The hash browns were seasoned that I could taste the rosemary herb.

I added myself to the wait list on Yelp before leaving the house, so I only waited 15-20 minutes once I arrived there for a table. The parking situation is some metered street spots and a structure across the street, I picked the structure for convenience (nothing appeared open on the street and I didn't want to keep looping around). I sat outside on a lovely day, and my date and I had a great view to people watch. I knew I wanted a breakfast sandwich, but the problem was, I liked elements from many different sandwiches. Luckily, they let me customize mine. I ended up get the B.E.A.T sandwich, which normally comes with tender belly bacon, but I asked for pulled pork instead. I also prefer my eggs scrambled, when they normally come fried on this sandwich, and they accommodated. I added avocado. The result was exactly what I asked for, and exactly what I was craving! I would like to come back to try some of the delicious sounding pancakes.My date did the Benny Duo since he couldn't decide which one to get. He really enjoyed both and said he would try the others next time.The service was a little slow, our waiter was trying, but it was busy and he had a lot of tables to serve. The whole experience took about an hour and a half with the wait, so this isn't your quick in-and-out brunch joint, even on the weekdays.

My party of three got the Sunny Mimosa, Chai Iced Spiced coffee, Reuben, Chile Verde Benedict, Breakfast Pot Pie, French Toast, English salad, and another plate I forget. We each got two entrees because we wanted to try the menu and just took the leftovers home.Verdicts: Salad - amazing. Eggs were perfectly poached. Tomatoes ripe. Just enough dressing. Fresh avocados.Reuben - too salty. Pickle that it came with tasted like t was pickled for a day - it was very cucumbery.Breakfast pot pie was extremely buttery and flakey - great texture. It doesn't come out in a tin or anything - more like the filling on top of a flakey croissant.Must get the French toast. Sooooo good.Chile Verde - I got half and half barbecoa and pulled pork. It was good. It came with hash browns. It was good but I wouldn't get it again, does that make sense?Mimosa was okay but my friend loved his coffee.Come here for the ambience and the hype.
