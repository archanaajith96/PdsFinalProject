The traditionally decorated restaurant with its Chinese television stations is super charming. There are two options: a take out stand or you can be seated and dine in. Either way, the service and speed of service are second to none! When I came home to visit after being away a few years, I noticed that they remodeled. Albeit, their Boba is still the best in town... I was a little bummed at their new lunch combo! The little plastic cups all around the meal made me feel wasteful and made the meal feel like it came from a lunch lady in elementary school. The egg roll and hot and soup were as tasted as always, but my cashew shrimp seemed gooey and over sauced. The service was as great as ever and the prices are unbeatable, but I didn't get the warm fuzzy feeling that I usually get after eating there. Pros: BOBA, service, prices Cons: cashew shrimp Overall: I will be back to give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe my tastes have changed and I need to mix it up. I'd still recommend them for yummy fast Taiwanese food!"}, {"review_id": "mazALOd3jDBkLdz175ODTg", "user_id": "GSmBRZrsx1Kjk6E3Usl95g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Not having visited Reno several times for work, this is a very common stop for me. The food is very decently priced and the quality is great. I really enjoy the pig feet dishes they have for lunch and as a stand-alone dish. Slow stewed in a peanut soy sauce style it's so easy to eat. Had several other Taiwanese dishes that were equally good. I did get a papaya milk only to quick realize the flavoring is entirely artificially flavored. Avoided that mistake the second time and gave their regular milk tea a try and it was decent. Highly recommend for a good home style meal but I'd avoid the drinks myself next time I'm around."}, {"review_id": "cH9s57cmXshYuYWJSHNF1w", "user_id": "vHc-UrI9yfL_pnnc6nJtyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The term \"lunch box\" doesn't just describe those nifty metal, plastic or fabric containers that you carried into grade school! At 101 Taiwanese that term describes an incredibly diverse and hearty meal with so much going on you just might leave with your head spinning!See if you're like me, when faced with a menu filled with delicious and unique options, you need ONE that offers you just a bit of everything. Enter 101 Taiwanese's lunch boxes which combine a protein of your choice, steamed veggies (because health), Taiwanese pickles and preserved veggie, rice topped with a minced pork stew, and half a tea boiled egg. Since I first started coming to 101, popcorn chicken has been a must order on every occasion. So when I started to visit at lunch time I had a problem. I mean, ain't no one gonna get through the app portion AND an entree, and make it through the rest of the work day! That's when I discovered the lunch boxes. I could get my popcorn chicken fix and feel like I enjoyed a whole meal. Walking in tonight I thought I was getting Zha Zhang mien, but the smell of the five spice infused pork belly braise smacked me in the face as soon as we opened the door, so I knew what I had to do!\"Lunch boxes\" ain't just for lunch y'all! I mowed that pork belly box down for dinner and didn't regret a thing! P.S. these boxes are slick for takeout too!"}, {"review_id": "EQiXeMO2B4cv4OOIgcrugQ", "user_id": "Hm0diOkWwpo9zotlJlqMUQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "Authentic Taiwanese dishes...Up until today I've only stopped by here for boba drinks. On my 4th check-in we decided to dine here before heading back to California. We walked in and we were told we could sit wherever we wanted so we sat by the window. We were given menus and after deciding what to get we placed our order with the server. Service was pretty quick here. Got served our wonton soup first then the main dishes came shortly thereafter. We ordered the following:Taiwanese Style Wonton Soup - didn't really like this soup. It had different taste and had bean sprouts and other veggies. I could handle the loads of veggies but not the bean sprouts.Crispy Pork Roll - appetizer that came in six big pieces and sweet sauce. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to taste it to comment but Mom enjoyed it.Pork Fried Rice - delicious and tasty! Right amount of ingredients mixed in with the rice. Was debating whether to try their Spam fried rice or Hawaiian fried rice. Next time :)Salt & Pepper Pork Chop, a traditional Chinese dish and one of my favorites! The portions were big and it wasn't too spicy for me. I liked how they prepared this dish.Of course, as we wrapped up our dinner I had to order boba drinks to go. Love their smoothies w/ boba. The service was fast and the food was great. The only thing I didn't like was they don't put ice on their drinks. I had cold water but not ice-cold water served to me. Parking is limited. There are some private parking spaces that is shared with a Starbucks and other businesses but there is also street parking available.Review #0961"}, {"review_id": "WI5mAtI6BnDGc807YjfrGQ", "user_id": "-RL4YW0WujUEqqMo5KfsUQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "We came around 530 pm, there was only one other table in the restaurant. Promptly seated, menus given. Props for bringing sealed water cups for the kids. There was huge menu to choose from. We ended up ordering a lot of appetizers and a couple of entrees. Eats: fried calamari tasteless- Popcorn chicken nice and light and not too greasy- Scallion pancake light and crispy but too oily- Beef wrapped pancake not available so substitute with pork it was ok but too greasy.- fried pork intestines very smelly-wonton in chili oil not a fan it was plain wontons in chili oil with seasoning salt on top.We also ordered the beef chow fun, nothing like what I'm used to. The Hawaiian fried rice was ok, just wished there were more chunks of pineapples. We had the green beans with minced pork it was ok. Stand out dishes were the sweet and sour pork and the salt and pepper chicken wings. Sweet and sour pork was light and crunchy and had the nice flavor to it. The salt and pepper chicken wing were more like wings nuggets but had a nice hint of garlic to it.  They also served bobas tea, the almond milk tea was ok but not enough ice in it. Other people in he party orders red bean slush and the mung bean slush and they both like them. Overall service was pretty good and welcoming but food wise not quite there."}, {"review_id": "5u6gxVDvjunYTsVakQHr5Q", "user_id": "TS5o5JBI9mN-5K6s5HIlTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Local hotspot for real authentic Taiwanese food.

This small establishment could easily be missed if you're in a rush while driving because it is located on a small acre lot bundled with a few other businesses on the corner of 5th Street and Nevada Street. Just look for the Starbucks on the corner and you've arrived at this destination! The parking lot is very small (maybe 10 parking spaces) so finding front row parking here can be tough at times but no worries; there is a larger parking lot located across the street and there is also street parking. We got lucky and found a spot right in front...score!Even though this was our first visit, we knew where we were headed as soon as we walked in because the drink station was clearly marked. While standing in line it was also clear that this place is a favorite to many....next stop in will definitely be for food. I did forget to snap a picture of their menu but they have a large variety of flavors to choose from so you're sure to find a flavor that will please your taste buds. The thing I was most impressed with is how fast our orders were made. From the time we ordered and drinks were handed to us; I kid you not...5 mins flat for (4) drinks. There are a few other places in town that we've tried and the average wait time is about 15 mins to get drinks in hand.

Restaurant is still packed as always for dinner service. They've changed the menu since our last visit, adding some new items and slightly raising the prices. Quality of the food has gone way down. I ordered the Beef and Tofu in Spicy Chili Broth (boiled beef is the more common name). Looks intimidating with the whole red chilies swimming in chili oil, but it wasn't that spicy at all. I had to supplement the spice with spoonfuls of added chili. Also found the dish a little bland and absent of Sichuan aromatics.My friend got her usual Braised Pork Rice Bowl and said it wasn't as good as she remembered.Scallion pancake is one of those frozen ones. It wasn't fried long enough and ended up super soggy and greasy without the crisp. I liked the dipping sauce though! Hate to give a subpar rating since the service was top notch. It's just that the food is nowhere near as good as it used to be.

First, the seating was quick, even though the restaurant was fairly full. It was Me, wife and 5 kids. We tried a variety of items as Kids love to try new items. Wife and I have visited Taiwan many times And we love the street food there. We had : onion pancake, oyster omelette, beef wrapped pancake, crispy pork roll, sweet sausage fried rice, house chow fun, salt pepper pork, braised beef noodle soup, sweet orange pork ribs, basil century egg and Taiwanese style Clams. Total Bill was $120.00 before tip. The food was really good. The Orange Ribs were as sweet as candy. All 5 kids commented too sweet. The Century eggs were very salty, but good flavor. We would eat every dish, other than the orange ribs again. So why the 2 Star? Portion size. I was amazed at how little was given for the price. $13 for tiny ribs that barely gave each member of our family 2 tidbits. Thats about $3 for the length of my finger. The oyster omelet had 4 oysters in it. That's like $2 per oyster. We had to cut them in half. Not one dish was over 1/2 full. The clams were delicious, but again not even 1/3 of the bowl full. We left after spending $120 and kids were still hungry.  So if portion is not an issue, eat here. Over priced, small portions, but delicious."}, {"review_id": "YaAfm1xpSwmTBKMy3Vpefg", "user_id": "aiJG7jeyygfXg-oznRe5-w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/18/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I feel like this place has gone down in quality.

A majority of them are Americanized Chinese dishes, like orange chicken, lemon chicken, etc. The authentic Taiwanese dishes are great, though.

The atmosphere is very laid back and calming as I welcomed there. The concept is much similar to your local Chinese restaurants across the U.S. although inside it's much Taiwanese flare filled with Chinese letters and decors across the whole interior room. Much modern and spacious.The employees here from servers and cookers are doing a fine job for making the customers like me a good service! No cons at all!Now onto the food! I ordered two items on the menu: the Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken and Almond Milk Tea with black bobas. As I ate and drank it, it tasted good although it needs something to enhance the flavors and improvements. The goods: the Popcorn Chicken tasted irresistible! It battered perfectly and eatable to bite which I did feel the chicken meat inside especially the scent of basil. The close calls: the Almond Milk Tea with bobas. The flavors of almond milk tasted fantastic, but the ice content is lacking. I wish it needs to add more ice cubes to make it more cool instead of being too humid and melted the drink. Also, the black bobas chewed closely better than I expected; not too harden to bite! A fine late night app dinner!Parking at 101 Taiwanese Cuisine cal be quite challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface street parking nor the smaller parking lot too. You can also ride a bike, walk or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.To conclude, 101 Taiwanese Cuisine is a good, average local Taiwanese/Chinese restaurant that I've ever visited for the first time while traveling to Reno. Perfect for friends, family and co-workers gathering. A well visit.

We got the pork wontons (not fried ones, the ones that come in soup) and a scallion pancake as an appetizer. Presentation is nice but the taste was great. Usually pancakes can be too oily, but this scallion pancake was only lightly fried. I would recommend.My husband got the chicken leg bento. It basically came with nearly half the chicken! I ordered a \"pot roast pork\" bento, but they brought out a pork roll instead. We didn't try it as we told them that wasn't our order. I wasn't sure what Taiwanese pot roast pork would entail, but it was 3 strips of braised pork belly. Each bento comes with sides of pork over rice, (almost no pork) pickled vegetables, a half of a hard boiled tea egg, macaroni salad, an orange quarter and a piece of cabbage - for a little less than $9.I'd go back again if I was in Reno."}, {"review_id": "x0Z9QfasKDBzEcRJO-e5OA", "user_id": "SOr-rhijc_y_P-ulfpSHIg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "A rare find of Taiwanese restaurant out in Reno.
