Surprisingly I've never posted a review. Lynnhaven is a great choice for only 7.99! Biscuits and gravy are the best you've ever had. Pancakes are moist and fluffy at the same time. There's a large selection of eggs Benedict's and they never lack flavor! There's typically a special that's not on the menu that always looks appetizing if you don't want to get your norm.The staff is ON IT!!! These girls know how to tend to your party and make everything a pleasant experience. There's a great selection of mimosas and other brunch spirits. The bathrooms are clean and actually have paper towels! Not the nasty blowers. Expect to wait minimum 25 minutes during prime times 9am-130pm or so. If you're an early riser... there's no rush at opening. Do yourself a favor and treat your palate to incredible food. I've never had a bad experience at either location. Food and staff are always consistently great."}, {"review_id": "5Sf13wZL-Gm2vqlrNtzjyw", "user_id": "I2xm1Zy9UZOWwaxPfnsksw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Ok this review breaks my heart. I love their other location down the road and I mean love. We went to the other location on a Sunday where it was a 1 hour wait so they told us it was a shorter wait at the original location. So it's Citrus how can it be bad? Bad very very bad. To start it's small, dark, our waitress was rude and unpleasant. Everything the other place isn't. Since I always order the citrus pancakes so I strayed and ordered-Southern Chicken Benedict w/ Poached Eggs, Hollandaise on the side. 1st attempt- my order comes out doused in Hollandaise so much that I couldn't even see the food underneath. The waitress was like sorry but we are really busy. I insisted they remake it. She comes back with the same plate saying it's gonna take the kitchen a long time to remKe it are you sure you can't eat this. 2nd attempt- it comes out with Hollandaise on the side but also the eggs are scrambled. I hate scrambled eggs. I said it's wrong again and she said I don't think the kitchen will remake it. I tried to eat it but I gave up this was just awful. My friend ordered the Citrus Chicken salad which was a disaster except for sweet potato fries.We love the fresh squeezed juices at Citrus but this location served it super warm just kinda blah.Our main reason for going that day was to buy 2 containers of the Citrus Syrup and a quart of fresh squeezed juice. But after tasting their juice we skipped and bought 2 syrups for $6.99 each Somehow our bill was over $58 plus tip! What a waist and for what? I will now just wait at the other location in the future. This one was so disheartening"}, {"review_id": "Ty-mqKeAoWZqq4g2A9ZfRg", "user_id": "nvxBLssCyMfAEDNqr2x6zA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "I have such a love hate relationship here. I want so badly to love this place, because the food is pretty good, but THE STAFF MAKES ME NOT WANT TO EAT HERE. And you should read why before you do. Let's start at the beginning: THE HOSTESS: We have had this same young lady each time we have been here and her rude attitude makes me wonder why she still has a job. She is curt and cold, very snobbish. And for someone who should be the \"face\" of your establishment, on the first impression she leaves so much to be desired. I am sure she is a wonderful young lady, but I don't think she likes her job. THE WAITSTAFF:  While I have not had a 'bad waitress' I have been unimpressed by the service. At this particular location, you are very rushed; everyone is crammed in their booths like sardines and they are busy and not afraid to make sure you know it. Let's talk UNIFORM: I get that it's a \"beach vibe\". But the fact that the staff's shorts have their rear ends hanging out as they are cleaning tables... i don't want to see that. And I am perplexed as to why there is not a higher standard and why the beach booty shorts are allowed. A one inch inseam does not seem appropriate, and maybe that's the point.. but Grandpa ogling the teens in tiny shorts creeps me out. I am not a prude, I just don't like seeing these girls picking their shorts out of their butts and constantly pulling on their length then touching food. How gross. While this is not the uniform \"rule\", as the staff wear pretty much any bottoms they want, they certainly have made it the norm.The Food Runners:  HERE IS WHERE I TAKE PARTICULAR EXCEPTION. Not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES in two visits they have brought us a wrong order, a half order... or like last week when we were brought two 'bowls' with soup that were literally from the bottom of the she crab bucket. They split what was left between my mother and myself and didn't have enough for the cup of soup that my grandmother ordered. Our food runner said they had given the last to my mother and I, which was less than a normal bowl each, and they had to make more... instead of just waiting for another batch to be completed they brought us whatever was left. I would have preferred to have placed a new order or waited, than to pay $9 each for two bowls of she crab that wouldn't fill a cup. That's poor quality control. Speak up and tell you food prep to get their acts together. Communicate with the waitstaff when you are low on something, and don't bring half portions and try to pass them off as whole. On that same day, they brought my daughter the wrong order - it looked just like her 'little citrus' but larger portions. She didn't notice and had begun eating when the food runner came back for the plate to take it away. She did not have the correct order with her. That took a while longer. I'm not sure what she did with the first plate, but I hope she tossed it. However I am not confident that is what happened because THE FOLLOWING DAY, Sunday we came up after getting my husband from the airport and the same thing happened only this time, he had just cut into his omelette with a spoon, when the food runner came back and took the plate away from him before explaining it was the same item but wrong order. Then!!I WATCHED HER TAKE IT TO THE WINDOW, HANDED IT TO THE FOOD PREP HE \"CHECKED\" the appearance and GAVE IT BACK TO HER AND SHE GRABBED A SECOND PLATE AND DELIVERED THE MEAL TO ANOTHER TABLE!!! After my husband had already used a utensil he had eaten from on that same food she placed it in front of another customer... HOW DISGUSTING!! That's a health code violation. Once the food has been touched by a customer you can not serve it to another!! She knew what she was doing, too. The prep knew what he was doing. Instead of tossing the mistake they served the dish anyway!!! It makes me question how often they do this. I have to wonder if this restaurant has a manager that walks around because I have never witnessed one making rounds. If they were, they would know how their staff was operating.Why am I being so critical? Well, when I am spending, on average, $115 on brunch for a family of 5, I have an expectation that comes with that price tag. Citrus is failing to meet that right now. I think the popularity/draw is the all day breakfast, cocktails available and Food Network exposure. I have had a much better experience over at the North Great Neck/264 location. Not rushed, good team work, no problems with our orders. Skip the shore drive/West Great Neck location and head down there for a better experience."}, {"review_id": "Lxxp7CIqAciy_Mgs_9EgiA", "user_id": "ksr22rFUZbL0ybzMquFnpw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Early Sunday morning breakfast was good.  This is also a dog friendly restaurant.  I managed to get there before the Sunday rush.  I ordered the French toast with eggs, bacon and grits.  My food came rather quickly.  This was my first visit to this restaurant.  It came recommended bt the hotel staff at the Va Beach Hotel and Resort which is just a minute down the road.  The staff, well let's just say that the all the young ladies are very attractive.  Hmmm, i wonder if that's done on purpose ..  I give this place a 3.5 stars."}, {"review_id": "4tZVyGf5KhEmy0w9dvTJ7Q", "user_id": "sqxx1GRQxBgKHAb5KpfQ8A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "Love the food here but hate how busy and packed this place gets especially on weekends.

It is pretty busy on Sundays. We were fortunate to get seats at the bar instead of waiting the hour wait. I order an almond milk cappuccino. I was surprised that is costed the same as one of the speciality mimosas. It was tasty, but not worth $6. I also had the fresh orange and grapefruit mimosa - fusionmosa. It was perfect. Delicious. If you go, get several different signature mimosas. I would have ordered more if I didn't have to drive. I had the special breakfast flatbread with egg whites, feta, avocado, and scallops. It was remarkable. I would eat it again and again. I didn't think I would want to wait for food, but Citrus is so tasty I would do the wait."}, {"review_id": "XORznFgA1mCSe_NQlovt3A", "user_id": "gYpA_ntjChTTD-ypJ03P0Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "This place isn't good at all.

I have been to Citrus before, but at the other location they have in Virginia Beach. We came here on Saturday, and there was a bit of a wait, so we went to the bar and got some drinks. I ordered a bloody mary and my friends ordered a mimosa, one of the specialty ones. The reason for my only 3 star review is this - the mimosas my friends ordered has nothing in them but grapefruit juice and they had ice!?!? Mimosas are not supposed to have ice first of all and on top of that why would they get charged for an alcoholic mimosa when there was no alcohol in them? We decided to just wait and get them new ones when we sat down, luckily we were being paged our table was ready. This was at about 10:45am. When we sat down the server came over right away and got us waters and go our drink orders, now keep in mind, my friends did not drink their \"mimosa\" because it was not a mimosa. We explained what happened to the server and she said she would get them two new right away, we thought Great! She came over, got our food orders and brought over the new drinks (they were made correctly). At this point it is noon, and we still have no food? Now we have been in the restaurant business before and we know things get crazy and busy, but we ordered at 11:00 - it should not take a hour for simple breakfast. We finally got our food, and of course, everything was amazing and since we were starving, I think we would have ate it regardless.Now the time comes for our checks, we pay and leave. As we are leaving and walking to our car, my friend told me they got charged again for a mimosa?? Honestly, it may not be a big deal to some people, but when mimosas are 7 - 10 dollars a pop for the special ones, and you get charged twice, but they were only made correct once - that is a waste of money! The server could have let them know that they were being charged again.I think I will continue to go to the other location rather than this one. It was just not a good experience."}, {"review_id": "CCYwRZ1AhrO23peflS2iGw", "user_id": "_Z9Mkbq0nN_gvsJFRvQqEw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We love Lance and Cheri and the restaurant.

I was in Virginia Beach with a friend and we were looking for a brunch spot. We tried a different place that had good ratings, but the wait was very long and we were hangry. We stopped at a gas station, and Citrus was walking distance from the gas station (and also had great reviews), so we decided to see what the wait was like. They told us 15 minutes but we were probably seated within five minutes. The interior is cute-- think updated diner.Another thing we did't know was that Guy Fieri was at this restaurant for DDD! Their famous dish is their soft-shell crab benedict and their was also citrus pancakes were also featured on DDD. Their mimosas were pretty cheap at around $4. One of their specials was a mahi-mahi benedict which is what I ended up ordering. It was delicious! My friends parents got the soft shell crab benedict and loved it as well.

Things were quite different. I ordered the Horseradish Beef Panini  and she had the Half & Half Soup/Sand combo. Her she-Crab soup was wonderful and the sandwich was also pretty good.  My sandwich was pretty inedible. First, there was WAY too much butter on the bread which made it soggy. The horseradish flavor was absent. The beef was tough and bland. I asked for some more horseradish sauce and was told it was in the cheese and I'd incur a cost for more cheese. There was cheese on it? I didn't ask, but the manager was alerted and came over she was pretty unapologetic. We waited for 15 minutes just to get the check. Guessing this was a one-trick pony. Very friendly atmosphere, even though they were mad busy. Food was phenomenal. I got a \"Daily Special\" Shrimp Salad. 6 grilled shrimp (nice spice!), greens, mango, avocado, strawberries, grapes, pineapple and a creamy goat cheese. Make sure to get the \"House Dressing\", a mango/citrus concoction that was spectacular!For desert, I had a German Chocolate cupcake that should be illegal. Make sure you bring your \"X-Large stomach\" with you. You're gonna need it.  Any cons? The shrimp were a little tough and I would've preferred a little more whipped cream with the cupcake, but in all honesty, you can never have too much whipped cream."}, {"review_id": "yL3MkQCrkclUIPQupmMtcA", "user_id": "c1XI3DmyevGeUUenaloHow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/19/2017", "text": "My family and me are here for breakfast. -The food was amazing. -This place was pretty popular so the wait was about 30 mins-the food came out in a timely manner-each dish was seasoned very well. **More description on the picture caption** thumbs up for this restaurant."}, {"review_id": "kv7Hm8UIwFnIfmqKFa5NJA", "user_id": "Sh_vUlHHY2Kuj14eF8NYZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/15/2017", "text": "Fantastic breakfast experience.When we arrived, the parking lot was full but I was thrilled to find that there's free valet parking on the weekends.

For brunch I ordered the croissant with mango and slivered almonds. A different and delectable brunch option. I enjoyed it immensely with turkey sausage, shredded hash browns, and scrambled eggs with cheese as my sides. My friend ordered the soft shell crab benedict and french toast. The benedict was good, but soft shell crab just isn't my thing. The french toast was delicious and presented beautifully. My friend ordered cheese grits on the side but we were a little disappointed to find out that not only were the grits not seasoned, but there was also a sprinkling of cheese on top as opposed to having the cheese mixed in. There's a big difference between \"cheese grits\" and grits sprinkled with cheese. It took us a good 10 minutes to doctor those grits up and make them palatable... but we made it work.There are so many unique and creative breakfast and brunch options offered here.
