I frequent all the big name steakhouses  but WOW this place was on par with a Michelin star restaurant! I regret not taking more photos but I was enjoying everything so much!Great cocktail list and extensive scotch selection that I would consider for the varsity squad. Nothing jr about this scotch selection so bring your discerning taste.If Oysters are your thing, do order from here. The variety is diverse and overall their seafood selection is super fresh! I can't wait to go back again to see what oysters they have next. Our waiter was fantastic in guiding us in our selection and his service was professional, genuine and attentive.I had lobster and my husband had some special aged ribeye filet. It was the best steak I have ever had, cooked and seasoned to perfection! We had some nice potato side with the meal that was very flavorful but all my attention was on that steak and lobster. We also had a lobster add on to the steak with this perfect savory sauce that literally gave me a food orgasm! If you are a foodie you get what I'm saying here.  Every bite of everything is perfectly balanced to hit your palette perfectly.  I thought about that dinner for days. It's the type of meal that makes everything in life satisfying! Then dessert, get their signature dish. Again, all the flavors work perfectly together. It's not too sweet it's perfectly balanced. I forget what it was called but it will catch your eye as you see it being brought out to practically every table. This is the perfect place for a date, boys or girls night out or business meeting. It's a sophisticated place with modern decor and impeccable service and well trained staff. You absolutely need reservations, the more notice the better for the weekend! I cannot wait to dine here again. On par with a Michelin star restaurant!"}, {"review_id": "pDkz8uZXsH7cGswprLG9MA", "user_id": "spNaK0MRO5wxyjfS7Gy8EA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "The Best Steak I have ever experienced!Wow!

Although I dislike long reviews, this one of mine might be a very long one so apologies in advance! Reserving a table was easy breezy thanks to the Open Table app.  Got seated soon after arriving which was very nice considering that the restaurant was super busy. It didn't take very long until it became evident that the table is in the middle of the way where even our waiter almost dropped the menus while passing our table. Yes, it was that bad. To make things even worse, there were plenty of LOUD guests that just wanted to yell instead of talking normally. I perfectly understand, perhaps one of the most precious traits that we Homo Sapians Sapians have, is the ability to speak. Having said that I don't enjoy being in super loud places while eating. And that is exactly where this visit started to change course. After letting the waiter know that we would like to be moved, we were approached by one of the managers named Jake. He apologized for the situation and directed us to a dining room in the back of the kitchen area that was called the \"800s room\". The room had no more than 8 tables which was perfect and lovely and away from  alllll the loud crowd. Soon after Josh our waiter and his assistant, John introduced themselves and made the dining experience very pleasant. Now, it is worthy to review the food itself. The super food salad was tasty. The Jumbo shrimp cocktail was Double Super Jumbo. I am not sure if these shrimps are genetically modified to be this jumbo but they were delicious. As for the main course, it was suggested to us to order the off-menu special of wagyu steak. The suggestion was accepted and ordered sautéed corn as the side of choice. The wagyu steak was amazing. Although I am not a big fan of medium cooked steak, the plate that it was served in was soooooo HOT that the steak was cooked to my liking after is was served which was perfect. If you ever visit Phoenix, you should try to dine at this restaurant. I have had plenty of great tasting steaks in the past, this steak is among my top 3 steaks that I have ever eaten. If the Triple Js (Jake, Josh & John) were not involved in this dining experience, this review would have been a solid 3 star review, but they saved the day or night along with this review!"}, {"review_id": "uD4tu9hYC5CBlG-Ab9Ruvg", "user_id": "pgUQjUl_2G5L9EreDzIjSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I always find an excuse to dine here, date night, anniversary family get-together, birthday because the service, food and atmosphere is always consistently incredible.I came here to celebrate my anniversary.

I must say that I was extremely loyal to Mastro's City Hall before I started coming to Steak 44. This place is basically the same in terms of quality of food and service, the difference is the ambiance. At Mastro's you feel like you're in a stuffy old money ultra high-end steakhouse. Steak 44 is fun, vibrant and lighted! Lol.My favorite is the Wagyu NY, I've also gotten the Kansas City and the Tomahawk. Their sides are insane, I recommend them all. The appetizers are also absolutely nuts too!One thing you have to get is the beignet tree. These beignets may be the best beignets you can get outside of New Orleans. They're a great compliment to a heavy meal. Steak 44 fits Arcadia perfectly and it's also a great experience when I go."}, {"review_id": "KxNmrDgEi6GGDrOI0UzOyA", "user_id": "2VOWNrWndTG-og33u5t7hg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Wow. Best steak I have had in Arizona. My lovely wife and I were hosting an out of town friend who loves amazing food. We had been waiting for an opportunity to show off steak 44. We were all so impressed by our wonderful dinner. We stared with the crispy shrimp. A touch of heat, crispy, tender shrimp with a sweet glaze. So good. Their bread is super yummy. Soft, with crispy exterior with a nice yeast flavor. We all had steak and shared our sides. Each steak was cooked to perfection. My wife and I had NY strip. Perfectly cooked at med rare. Just melt in your mouth goodness with super beef flavor you don't get with a filet. Our friend got the wagyu which he was very impressed with. He said it was as good or better then most steaks he's ever had.We shared sweet corn, Creme Brulee corn, Hasselback potatoes, mashed potatoes and wild mushrooms. Wow all were so good. We don't drink, but I know they have one of the best wine selections in the valley. Service was world class. Not one mistake was made. The bathrooms were spotless. Wow what a great time.

Worth it? Totally! This was one of the best steak dinners I've had in a long time! My husband and I went to Steak 44 for the first time to celebrate our anniversary. It was a Sunday night and the place was packed! Good thing we had a reservation because there was not an open table in the place and there were a bunch of people in the lobby.We were seated in a section that was just off the bar. I would have preferred more of the \"dining room\" area but considering how busy it was it was fine. Our waitress was great - very attentive, gave good suggestions and overall very friendly.We started with the crispy shrimp. OMG. I couldn't stop eating it. So delicious. They also brought out warm, garlicy rolls. Again, delish. For our main course we went with the poke and split a filet. They were nice enough to split it ahead of time and they even cooked mine a little longer than his so we each got it done the way we like it. The poke was super fresh and flavorful and the steak was done to perfection. For a side we got the hasselback potatoes. Just like everything else, they were fantastic. As if all this wasn't enough, for dessert we got the s'mores in a jar. It was - you guessed it - awesome. Just the right size for a taste of something sweet without being huge.From beginning to end, the meal was outstanding. The next day they even called to thank us for dining with them - a nice touch, I thought. I think we found our new go-to for special occasions!"}, {"review_id": "isGEV1fLk-C3Tf4mN20I6g", "user_id": "IW9PODn_2g_15nkhQcRVdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "The steakhouse is top-notch.

I probably had the best bone in filet of my life. It was tender, flavorful and the peppercorn truffle sauce paired with it perfectly. The experience I had is the reason for the 3 stars. We probably had the worst table in the restaurant. I was there to celebrate my birthday. The hostess knew this so I was expecting a much better table location. They sat us on the aisle across the rail from a table placed in the bar. It was like we were sharing dinner with strangers. Then when the manager came to their table to discuss their status, the conversation was so loud and annoying. He stayed there quite awhile with that couple. We literally had to wait until he left to continue our own conversation before we could hear each other. When our  server (Megan)was taking my order, i  kept getting interrupted so someone could pass by her. Another annoying moment. Then when she took my husband's order, she asked him if we were sharing our entree. I was straight up insulted by the implication. My husband ordered the sea bass and was told, they were out. This should have been told to us when we were first given our menus.  Not after giving us ample time to decide what we wanted.  It was disappointing. He ended up picking the salmon as a last minute decision. She also never came back to ask if we wanted a second drink. When another mgr came to clear our table my husband had to ask for another drink. When she brought his, she still didn't ask me, again, I had to ask her myself. This experience left us feeling like our table was an afterthought. It was not the Birthday celebration I was expecting. It was extremely disappointing."}, {"review_id": "NS-ts-q_Kvv3Y5V2GH518g", "user_id": "BBv8OzOwgIMOpnVoFN6u3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/23/2017", "text": "My friend found this place on Yelp on a whim and BOY am I glad to have come here to celebrate my 25th birthday. It's definitely a $$$ spot, but you're getting premium cuts of steaks, chops, fresh seafood and delicious sides, so for special occassions, it's most definitely worthwhile. Come with a stacked wallet and an empty stomach!I'm from California and I've had my share of steakhouses in the Bay Area, but never have I ever had steak that tasted SO GOOD in my life!!! It's unbelievable how awesome Steak 44 is, I really want to come back to Arizona and eat all of this delicious food over again! All of their food was mouthwatering, and I mean everything was just cooked perfectly and deliciously seasoned. Here's the breakdown of the good good:Steak:I tried three cuts while I was here because my friends and I sampled each other's food. By far, my favorite is definitely the rib eye. Rib eye is more on the fatty side. When it's cooked with the bone, it is extremely flavorful, fatty and tender. The meat really should be enjoyed rare to medium rare, there's no better way to eat it. Second favorite of mine has to be the filet mignon. You can't go wrong with that cut. It's less fatty than the ribeye but it's very tender as well. The New York Strip was the last one I tried. Of the three, it was my third favorite. Don't get me wrong, it was all REALLY GOOD. I mean you're getting high quality beef for a great price and many different cuts, I can't complain about any of it!! Add-ons: Add different types of butter to the top of your steak for MAXIMUM flavor! There's truffle butter (damnit Nicki Minaj, had to go and ruin this for everyone), blue cheese, and black truffle green pepperorn. You can make it a full on surf-and-turf dinner by including lobster tail for $38, crab cakes for $16. For fancier people, $18 for that foie gras. Didn't get to try the add-ons but if I'm looking to go all out next time, you'll definitely catch me on that fancier side. Seafood:Oysters available on the half shell - Blue Points, Kumamotos and the Kusshis. Blue Point Oysters are probably the bigger ones of the three. $4 each and its serve with mignonette, horseradish, cocktail sauce and not quite sure what the last one was. Comes with minature tabasco sauces, so cute!Appetizers:Braised pork belly was one of my ultimate favorites of the night. Glazed with honey and chili, the pork belly was sweet and juicy. And the bed of spinach below absorbed all that wonderful flavor, it was a hefty bite no doubt. Sides: Mac and Cheese - I could eat this easily on its own! I like my Mac and Cheese chunky and not watery so this is cheesy melted perfection. Creamed Spinach - you really can't enjoy steak without a large fill of creamy and rich spinach.Crispy Hassleback Potato - I mean, to be able to get crispy edges and keep the middle soft and cooked perfectly? TEACH ME YOUR WAYS!!!Roasted Brussels Sprouts - mmmmmmmm bacon and brussel sprouts has to be the most perfect pairing in the whole world. Creme Brûlée Corn - THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST. Creamy corn with a little sugary crust, torched beautifully so the sugar hardens, I can even.....I left the restaurant smiling and ultimately satisfied. Had to take a lot of the food home because I was simply stuffed to the max. This was one of the best meals I've had and my friends and I each stared at each other in disbelief while we ate the delicious food. Looking forward to the next time I'm in Arizona again!!"}, {"review_id": "AXFLHaPw6-ZA2EujHtd1wQ", "user_id": "B0muVEQdT02pR7no_JmzOw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/25/2017", "text": "This, my friends, is a high end steakhouse that lives up to all expectations.My in-laws were in town and treated us for my husband's birthday. We had reservations for 5:15, and when we walked in at 5:10 we were immediately seated and met our server, Scott. He continued to give us extraordinary service all night.For appetizers, we shared the buttered rolls that were included with the meal, as well as oysters and beet salad. We also shared a bottle of Merlot recommended by Scott, and it was excellent.My main course was the Shetland Island braised salmon. Wow. Perfection. Along with that, I enjoyed the shared sides of mushrooms and Brussels sprouts. The thick-cut bacon with the Brussels sprouts was the real wow factor there! My 12-year-old son was quite happy with a side of macaroni and cheese (I'd love to know where the noodles come from!) and some fries. My husband rated his steak as among the best he has ever had.Even though we were all about to explode from good food at that point, we had to share a dessert. My husband was kind enough to go with my preference off the dessert list: brioche and chocolate chip bread pudding.This is up there with the best bread puddings I have ever had. The brioche had a wonderful texture and stayed in lovely big chunks. The top was kind of caramelized in a glorious way in addition to a drizzle of sea salt caramel, and there was a generous amount of semi-sweet chocolate chips (high quality, by the taste) throughout. A big scoop of vanilla bean ice cream topped it off. Thank goodness we were sharing that among four adults!Steak 44 was a five-star experience in every way."}, {"review_id": "vNlFSAGpigeii8JOO6KD4g", "user_id": "QHUWSRFuJ-HIueDB5kl4SA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Phenomenal!!  From the moment we were greeted, service and the food!  Steak 44 offers veal, which is not offered at many places these days."}, {"review_id": "yj4OM8DqfpJWXTUGrhouTw", "user_id": "XOk0Wx1X2qzK5GQq05Aaww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/10/2017", "text": "Whenever you go to a fine dining establishment, you expect certain qualities.

The atmosphere in the bar is active and chic with beautiful lights above you and plush chairs at the bar. The happy hour menu has several bites to share, but most of them are fried. I indulged in the shrimp cocktail which was served with three sauces, absolutely delicious. The shrimp was fresh and colossal. We also ordered the bread served in a pan. The bread had a Parmesan and garlicky taste, dipped in their homemade ranch was crazy good. My husband ordered the hassle back potatoes and a 12 oz steak and loved them both! The potatoes were crispy, but tender and were accompanied with an amazing chive butter/cream. The dessert was also amazing! It was a butter cream cake served hot with caramel and melted ice cream. Lastly, the drinks are strong and crisp. You definitely get what you pay for.I look forward to going back. This place is worth the money!
