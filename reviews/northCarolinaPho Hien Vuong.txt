Ordered a fresh shrimp spring roll. It was very fresh and the shrimp were large inside. The whole roll was a good size and it came with a yummy peanut sauce. I tried the chicken curry with rice and it was very good. Spice level just enough to make my nose run and taste buds scream with joy. Amazing dish! The bamboo shoots were plentiful as well as the chicken and there were yummy cooked onion slices in there which were a nice touch.Very very tasty! Servers were friendly and food arrived faster then expected. Check it out folks!

It comes with your choice of egg, clear, or rice noodle. I would suggest rice noodle because that's how I traditionally eat my pho. It comes with bean sprouts, basil, cilantro, lemon, and jalapeno pepper on the side. Add these to your soup to your liking. The pho looked really good and I'm definitely trying it next time. They all said they liked it.As for me, I ordered the beef vermicelli. It's thin slices of beef stir fried with lemongrass and onions over steamed vermicelli noodles. It's served with bean sprouts, cucumber, peanuts, cilantro, lettuce, and homemade fish sauce. The fish sauce comes on the side and you can add as much of it as you want. I was pleasantly surprised by how much beef and noodles they gave me. I recommend mixing all the ingredients together before eating it.Paying was easy--we paid up front separately. We are definitely coming back!"}, {"review_id": "fKc9O32b57ND0wh7N05-_Q", "user_id": "29rJDnZk2dDKMpb5eQ2PXw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "This place is a true DIAMOND in the rough. And by rough I mean out in the middle of nowhere surrounded by nothing. Pho hien vuong reigns as one of the best spots in town that is no longer a secret and well worth the drive out to its far af location.  The vegetable curry with coconut milk and bamboo shoots is one of my favorite dishes of all time. (See pic). It is not vegan, though, as I was told there is dairy in It as well. I am not giving It 5 solid stars because the pho soups could be better, and because there are many great items on the menu but also many lackluster items. If you choose carefully though, you will be glad you went. And you'll probably order something to take home for later"}, {"review_id": "NfV-1TifuyXss5jw9aKrKw", "user_id": "4tkZqKFbzVs778cGY3tF8Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Best pho in Greensboro!

So with the help from Yelp, I found this restaurant to fix my craving! I tried Special Beef Noodle Soup. It came with bean sprouts, jalapeño, cilantro, lemon, one other greens, and house-made sweet brown sauce. I usually put all bean sprouts & jalapeños and add sriracha & the sweet brown sauce. And the result is perfectly sweet/spicy and brings the best out of pho!This place didnt disappoint me! My next Greensboro visit, I would try their pho again :) My interaction with the employees were pretty positive. Two things I noticed about this place is: 1) Parking is limited, especially during lunch rush hour. 2) No napkins on the table for my runny nose :( I asked someone to get me some, so it was a no big deal.. but I was struggling with my spicy bowl of pho at the beginning without napkins!"}, {"review_id": "YoYtG86NuMrE6E1g8FGH3Q", "user_id": "bKDhSlfFPuCLpRjRZe4Akw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "We checked out this place as we were craving for pho to warm up. It was packed on a Saturday afternoon around noon. The restaurant itself was very clean and well-maintained. We ordered fresh spring rolls and the PH3 special beef pho (w rare beef steak and beef meatballs). Service was good and food came out relatively fast. I would skip the fresh spring rolls and try the fried ones next time.. I wasn't a huge fan. The pho was very good. Compared to a lot of other Vietnamese restaurants I have been to, this one seemed a little pricey.

My biggest complaint is the parking. This is a fairly large restaurant with a good amount of seating, but parking is much more difficult provided they have such a small lot.

I had the Beef Stew Noodle Soup with pho noodles, which consisted of beef chunks, carrots, lemon grass stewed in tomato sauce, served with bean sprouts, basil, cilantro, lemon, and jalapeño pepper for $9.95. There were a lot of fatty chunks in my bowl, but otherwise, I LOVED my meal. The carrots were cooked to the perfect softness in texture that I prefer, I was given plenty of meat and noodles, the broth was delicious and full of flavor, and the size of the whole meal  was awesome! I was definitely full by the end. It was incredibly tasty!I've been on the hunt for some good pho at decent prices, but it's hard to come by in North Carolina. So far, this place is at the top of my list! I would love to try their lunch specials. They have a wide variety of other menu options other than pho. The parking is limited. The venue is pretty big for a pho restaurant. Also, they offer military discount!

I couldnt even finish it and i still have some for later.. this restaurant is usually packed .. that's how you know when a redtaurant is good, my friend even warned me that we would have to park at the back of the restaurant.. i understand why.. with food this good they must stay busy all day long.

I also appreciate the consistency of the quality, quantity and the fair pricing. This establishment not only suits my need for Vietnamese food but it also starts to deliver dishes from other parts of Asia. My personal favorite dish here is not the pho. In fact it is the beef with green beans. I do however enjoy the occasional street noodle stir fry, which is what I got for this visit. The noodles were perfect, well seasoned and packed with flavor. I was brining a friend here who happened to be new to Asian food. I was glad that he enjoyed his food as much as I did, the saki perhaps made it better.

My husband ordered vermicelli noodles with egg rolls and pork. The pork was great but the eggrolls tasted weird. The sauce that came with it has been sitting for a while as well since there's a ring of dried sauce on the side of the bowl.
