Sign me up.The place was packed at 11:30. I was lucky and got a seat, others didn't fare as well. A few things annoyed me and the food was totally ok, but not fab. Annoyances:1) No water refill2) The soup didn't meet my dietary restrictions, so I ordered a different kind. I am all for charging for the upgrade, but seeing that soup comes with a meal I feel the upcharge should have been less than had I not ordered an entree. In other words, charge $2.50 for soup, or $2 if you order an entree, but swap out the soup. It was not this way.3) The pad see ew did not have the right noodles. Or every other Thai restaurant I've been to has the wrong ones. They used the noodles that comes in pad thai.4) There was pepper all over my meal. It was on the menu, I didn't read it right. But it was not good.I agree with Ken D., the noodles were dry. Needed more sauce.Fast."}, {"review_id": "b7dbiUotdSfTh5jLtq-BJA", "user_id": "ieL1LQvMYTdUwAmF1RcKcQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "I was here with 2 friends, and I ordered the most common dish \"red curry w/ coconut milk\".

I love their crab rangoons. It has a sweetness to it. Their plum sauce are also delicious! I normally always get their fried fish dishes or their larb. Yum!!! When getting the larb (I prefer beef) pay a bit extra for the Shrimp chips to eat them with. It's delicious. They get super packed during lunch time. I wish they had peanut curry.

A few of them had never experienced Thai food, and now, they love it! The restaurant accommodated our group with no problems. I did call ahead several days in advance to make sure they would have enough seating. Saturday evenings are the best for larger groups of 10-14. The food was impeccable! Hot, delicious, and very nice portions. Always a cheerful, welcoming staff. I recommend Amarin Thai Cuisine when you don't know what you want to eat, or when you know exactly what you want to eat! JUST EAT THAI HERE!"}, {"review_id": "qjUZ104N9ls9g7G4sgOmvw", "user_id": "_3f_c--sTg9L4ikS2uuafQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/12/2017", "text": "If you want Thai food, this is the place. Portions are ridiculous, always flavorful, and most importantly they are consistent with their food. Chicken Pad Thai is in point. Must try pineapple fried rice with chicken. Mostly do carry out orders but on the occasion when we can dine in the place is clean and the help is pleasant. Sometimes a bit of a wait for your server but what do you expect from a place that's so damn busy."}, {"review_id": "LxKZmzzEqKfPIxAlI9uYgA", "user_id": "N--OQqLEjW24WHZrDfI_JQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/29/2015", "text": "Went to Amarin for a work lunch.  Close to the work site, our boss called to ensure a reservation of 11 could be accommodated.   They were just finished setting up the tables when we arrived a few minutes later.  Good mix of tables and booths.  Nice varied menu with lunch dishes, various types of fried rice, salads, and soups.  Ordered a chicken stir fry with medium hot brown sauce with the additional egg roll and fried rice (normally comes with white rice).  Most of the dishes arrived pretty quickly, surprisingly for such a large lunch order.  The stir fry looked and smelled delicious, and it tasted as good!  Price for a lunch special was under $10, not including tip.  Worthwhile restaurant to try and I look forward to trying more dishes when we move closer next month.  Will repeat and recommend!"}, {"review_id": "LUzB_dfrdCS36AiViDKV0Q", "user_id": "Q__Rk5HzNY6sOtLjUiGEbA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/6/2015", "text": "This is one of my favorite Thai places in the area.

Never cared for hot food besides wings in my life. I went to my buddy's and he had me try some leftovers that he had from his chicken Pad Se'ew. Oh my lord it was a life changer!

Some nice woodwork and a few statues strewn around offer a comfortable enough setting. There are booths and tables. It doesn't feel like you're sitting at Shogun or Ronin or some other Asian-themed fare restaurant, but it's good enough.I went with my dad for lunch and we were sat right away, around noon, but then waited 10 minutes just for waters. The lunch rush is real and it's real annoying sometimes, as most people know. Most of our time spent was actually waiting to order, and then waiting for the food. They need one or two more waitresses to keep things going swiftly, in my opinion.The food, though, is plentiful and the $7.50 lunch specials are great. I ordered Pad Thai with a medium-plus spice, as I read others said their spices aren't as hot as other places. It had a good kick to it, not excruciatingly powerful but it did make my nose run a couple times, ha ha. The food itself was great and I ate it all. Nice portion, especially for lunch, and you can add meat (pork, chicken, tofu) or shrimp ($1 extra) to add to the flavor.We also ordered spring rolls, which were OK. The plum sauce wasn't bad, though I don't know if i would order it again.For two meals and spring rolls, the bill was less than $20 for two. Not too shabby. The food, although not nearly the best in the area, is more than adequate. If they can speed up the lunch service, it could be five stars for what this place offers."}, {"review_id": "RFy2d03gCdySdl-mT6prvQ", "user_id": "GX4R9SIz3JsRrQdqzYP9bA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/27/2014", "text": "This place opens at 11:00 am and it was already pretty full when I arrived 15 minutes later.  My first thought was crap, there's only two servers on the floor with an almost packed dining room.  The ladies working the dining room were on it though as no one seemed to wait for anything and I didn't either.There's lots of other pluses here.  The Tom Yum Soup was flavorful and it wasn't just a broth with a few things floating in it, but a fully loaded soup.  The Pad Thai was pretty solid.  They had the balance of flavors down to a tee so someone in the back knows their stuff.  Another plus was that I ordered very spicy and got it.  I've eaten a lot of Pad Thai and this is one of the better versions I've had.  Another good thing is the price for a generous sized portion....$8.50.  Awesome value here.The stats on this restaurant:  83% of the reviewers give this 4 and 5 stars.  Pretty impressive isn't it?  I'm going with 5 as I'll be damned if I can find anything bad to say about this place."}, {"review_id": "oSrynpa_gWCnK5gSg0AiEw", "user_id": "LtEjUWihbp12ctTl-x5xDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2017", "text": "Great service, food is fantastic and will definitely make it a point to come here more often!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/amarin-thai-cuisine-warren?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
