It also has a capsule of activated charcoal that turns the drink jet black. Mezcal, Cointreau, yellow chartreuse, egg white, activated charcoal, lemon.4.7/5: The Trinidad sour: No longer on the menu, but it's a standard cocktail that any bar can make. Rye and very heavy on the angostura, with orgeat, lemon, egg white.4.7/5: Pisco swizzle: No longer on the menu, but they might be able to still make this one; verify that they remember the ingredients: Pisco, green chartreuse, pomegranate syrup, egg white, lemon.4.7/5: The old fashioned continues to be solid, made with secret house-made bitters.4.7/5: Pathfinder: Excellent tiki cocktail:. pineapple rum, absinthe, orgeat, bitters, egg white.4.6/5: Maverick: A great aged rum cocktail, with a slightly unusual flavor. Aged rum, Averna, cognac, honey, lemon, orange bitters.4.0/5: Third shift: Good coffee cocktail. Vanilla infused vodka, with St. George coffee liqueur, does the trick. But it's merely good; no \"wow\" factor.3.4/5: the Duuuuuude! is a Tiki drink with elderflower, which makes it taste like bathroom air freshener. It's also a little too sweet. Rum, elderflower, orgeat, angostura, lime.2.7/5: az85: a waste of St. George Spiced Pear.2.0/5: Koyo: it's a watered-down version of a real cocktail.2.0/5: the Bohemian: Terroir, grapefruit, rosemary.

I am sure they must have had a good experience, but this was our experience.I went through their menu and 'tried' to order 5 items. They ran out of every single one. Finally, we got the vegan chicken burger. That burger tasted worse than the ocean. It had so much salt that five more bites and my friend would have puked.I couldn't help but notice how we were treated compared to others. We are 21 years old and indian but we look like we are 18. However, that does not mean that we should be treated differently. They were giving complementary bread to every single table but ours, why? Our table was in the center. She gave the bread to our left. She gave the bread to the person behind us on the bar. And she skipped right to the people on the right.I would love to come here again, only because of their menu. But if I am treated differently than others, I don't think they deserve my business."}, {"review_id": "KjR502ycBZlye-TMLuID9Q", "user_id": "JkWQ0Q9wdvkKdoJ1iry_rA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "With this review I've completed the Stump World Tour. I've dined at and Yelped all of Jim Stump's three restaurants: The Vesper, Forthright and now The Table. I'm a big Vesper fan. Not long ago I went to Vesper every day for an entire week. Sunday to Sunday. That's how much I love that place. On the final day I was hurting in many ways, but the high fives I earned from the Vesper bartenders made it all worthwhile. But this is a review for The Table and now, having visited a few times, I can rightly say I'm a big fan of The Table and plan to make it a regular weekend dining spot.On my most recent visit, the day was bright and the air very sweet and cool the way it always is during early spring in California. My friend and I sat on the patio and we enjoyed the weather. Metro Silicon Valley readers voted The Table patio one of the best in the Bay. It all felt very vivid like life in high definition. I've travelled all over the United States and only California feels so real. On this day, there was silver and gold metallic confetti all over the ground and one of the servers worked hard against the wind to sweep it all up as the wind worked equally as hard to blow it all over the patio. The server was happy and she asked aloud to no one, God, whoever was within earshot, \"Where did this confetti come from?\"\"You're doing a great job,\" I told her.\"Thank you,\" she replied and then she gave up and let the confetti blow away on its own.Our actual server came less than a minute later and greeted us, but I noticed she wasn't looking at our faces as she spoke. The server was looking down at the table where my friend and I had spread out two 23andme DNA testing vials full of our own spit, a gold plated pocket knife with pearl handles and one of those decorative cushioned pouches that people store their weed and glass pipe in.In spite of the sordid DNA and switchblade party happening at her table, our server, Madeline was very sweet and pretty. She had chestnut brown hair, pulled back away from her face and hazel green eyes that looked like they could see through time. She wore a long sleeve t-shirt, which confused me, because she was wearing a strapless bra and I thought those were only for when women wore dresses with exposed shoulders, but the total effect was attractive and my friend and I enjoyed watching her lithe, studied movements. She was a dancer that day.\"She seems nice,\" my friend said.\"And yet here we are.\"\"What are we? Not nice?\"My friend and I were both high and buzzed already and held our server hostage for something close to ten minutes asking questions about the menu and the meaning of life. Satisfied with the profound truths Madeline shared with us, we ordered drinks and food.We ordered broadly from both the happy hour and dinner menus. The server brought us the bone marrow and chicken liver pate and we enjoyed both, but when no one was looking we covered our toast in pate and piled the gelatinous marrow on top. Feeling especially bold, we dipped our crispy wedge potatoes in the pate. We came at the same time.We really did The Table right that day. I'm not sure you can do it wrong, come to think of it.Best regards from your friend in fun,Philip C."}, {"review_id": "92BPpEHq78jaYJ1OYCQ1kA", "user_id": "CnLUGaCsH4htuFGZq-5hlg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I absolutely adore the vibe of this restaurant - everything from the service, the decor & all the way to the menu selection!

Totally disappointed in myself. What you won't be disappointed in is coming here for brunch! Thank God they have a convenient check-in process on Yelp which allows you to add your name on their waiting list even before you arrive; that way you can come right in as soon as you get there. It's the perfect way to guarantee a seat upon arrival if you plan accordingly. I'd ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes.It was the fluffiest pancakes I'd ever had. Lemon flavor was subtle enough to satisfy your expectation and it paired perfectly with the ricotta and blackberry preserve. Wish I had the room to order their Lavender Lemonade.

I will concede that the wait is justified since the place is really popular and the food is really good, so I will say that it is worth the wait. We ended up waiting about an hour to get seated, but once we were seated our food came out in a timely manner. As for the service, our waiter came off as though he really didn't want to be there and it made me reluctant to ask for more water or juice if he walked by. To be fair, it was pretty packed the day we went, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.So the food. Their freshly squeezed orange juice is something I highly recommend getting! It's fresh and sweet and I could probably drink it all day long. The food is quite flavorful and you can tell what is made from scratch. My boyfriend got the traditional breakfast and I got the lemon ricotta pancakes with their seasonal preserve, and we were definitely not disappointed. I LOVED the seasonal preserve that came with my pancakes, I really wish I had asked for more. My boyfriend cleared his plate before I even got through half of mine!

There's not much to do around either while you wait. I'll be honest I came for the smoked salmon eggs benedict, but The Table has the most expensive smoked salmon eggs benedict I've seen anywhere. The item is $20 BEFORE tax and tip. I'm willing to pay a bit more for good food, but that's a little too much. This place should be 3 dollar signs. I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes with lemon curd and blueberry compote, my friend ordered the special of the day (avocado uni toast with scrambled eggs and arugula), and we both shared the other special of the day, pull-apart monkey bread with salted caramel dipping sauce. Pancakes were yummy but there was no wow factor, it was honestly a very okay experience. They were just pancakes, nothing that kept me thinking about them afterwards. Can't speak for the avocado uni toast as I can't bring myself to eat anything avocado related, but my friend said it was just the right amount of food and delicious. The monkey bread was delicious - crispy on the outside, and soft and fluffy on the inside, and the salted caramel dipping sauce was a nice complement.

I didn't try the first two dishes I mentioned but out of the Benedict and loco moco my favorite was definitely the latter. If you like island food I highly recommend.

The food, the hospitality, the ambiance, the neighborhood. Everything about it just screams at you to go in and take a seat.I made a reservation via Yelp for a Valentine's Day brunch. (Dinner times were all booked already, but make lemonade out of lemons, amirite?) We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation time, but they found a table for us and seated us within 5 minutes. The place was packed and buzzing with merry customers eating and drinking and having a grand ol' time.Our server came by right away and asked if we wanted anything to drink. V-Day calls for bottomless mimosas, so you can bet your bottom that my eyes made a beeline for that on the menu. The boyfriend/DD chose a non-alcoholic option: apple cranberry soda.Honestly, everything we ordered was divine.Roasted Bone Marrow. Definitely one of the more unique items on the menu and ohhhh soo good. It's seasoned and cooked perfectly, and it took all my willpower not to pick up the bone and eat it like a dog. But V-Day date etiquette, so... I behaved. Scoop the deliciousness out, spread it across the charred ciabatta bread, find yourself drooling for more, rinse and repeat.Fried Chicken Sandwich. Sounds like nothing fancy, but this was seriously one of the best pieces of fried chicken I've ever had. Crispy on the outside and super juicy on the inside. Plus some Sriracha to give it a nice kick.Sugar Dusted Ricotta Beignets. Soooo fluuufffffyyyyyy. These beignets are a bit denser than the usual beignets, but that doesn't mean they're less tasty. A set of 5 was perfect to share, and the lemon curd that came on the side was a perfect complement.Bottomless mimosas. The real deal. Our server was super attentive and refilled my glass without me ever having to flag her down.Apple cranberry soda. Sounds boring until you taste it and a burst of spices hits you. This is like what would happen if you turned apple pie into a soda.Totally worth it to check The Table out for a meal! Make a reservation if you're scared of the wait, or check for counter seating that's first come, first served."}, {"review_id": "Pd1Qu27pt7hIZEU9X4Bjsg", "user_id": "K2w3CTa-KiXRYA3DoRZthg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "I came here a few weeks ago for Sunday brunch with a friend.

My friend got the corned beef hash - she said it was delicious and super filling from all the potatoes. I also got the Kentucky Express - a bourbon drink with coffee liqueur - it was strong! Had a good kick to it ;) I would come back again, maybe on a warm summer day outside - the patio looked nice and perfectly situated at the street corner. We luckily found street parking out 3-4 spots away from the entrance. Also, the bathroom (fit for one person) was spacious and nice! I will say the tables are kinda close to each other, so watch your step if you're squeezing out. There's also at least one Â spot for diners inside with a sofa and a coffee table - looked hard to have a meal there. There's also a spot outside for larger parties - a L-shaped bench with a matching table.

The brilliance of yelp let me get on the waitlist at Table before I even got to the restaurant.

The restaurant features dinning inside and out, along with a bar. It was 11am on a Sunday with a toddler so we opted for indoor seating. They give kids crayons and a coloring sheet. Props for the crayons being in a new sanitary pack! Now on the food. We split the lemon beignets and lemon ricotta pancakes. Both delectable. The lemon curd with the beignets was scrumptious. For my entree I got the special which was a uni scramble toast. A bit steep for $22 but very very good. Â I could have eaten 3 of em.

Only small annoyance is probably parking as it can get very packed but that's not the restaurant's fault. For brunch, I got the fried chicken biscuit with hash browns (instead of potato wedges) and my boyfriend got the hangtown fry (egg, fried oysters). I really enjoyed both of the dishes. The fried chicken wasn't overcooked and dry, there were flavor and seasoning in every bite (even in the thicker part of the chicken) and the egg was made perfectly (not overcooked, flowy egg). Hashbrown was unique (and full of flavor!) in the sense that they mix the shredded potatoes with onions. It was on the thicker side, so top part was crispy and little mushy on the inside.

Â Well yelpers, after nearly two years of visiting frequently, I feel confident in reporting to you that The Table is my default restaurant in WG because of the following \"A-B-C-D-E-F's\":- Ambiance: The table is just 'comfy'. The dining area is big enough where you don't feel too cramped (unless perhaps on a busy Fri/Sat night or during a weekend breakfast rush). The space between tables is adequate, and it's rare that you'll be unable to hear your eating companion's delightful insights over the noise from the crowd surrounding you.- Bar: The lounge/bar area is my go-to spot. There is usually plenty of room at the bar, high tables near the window overlooking Willow, a small secret couch in the back (don't sit there it's mine! ;), and a large outdoor area at the corner of Lincoln & Willow that offers tables, a fire pit, more high tables and when it's cold, the heating lamps do their job.- Cocktails: So I've had my share of craft cocktails (My best friend is Michelle C. ;) and while my palate is not refined as many of you fine yelpers, the sheer volume of cocktails consumed gives me some ability to rate these delicious potions. The bartenders are friendly, fully-capable mixologists. Yes, I said mixologists. They know how to make a cocktail, and you should see the thought & refinement they put into each cocktail they offer. Only the best cocktails that are sure to appease your taste buds get the privilege to be displayed on their often-updated cocktail menu.- Diligent Personalities: (This point really should just be labeled Personality, but I needed a word that started with \"D\" to keep with the theme of this review). I can't say enough good things about the entire team at The Table. Seriously - everyone is great! They are attentive and responsive to all requests, genuinely care if you are enjoying yourself, and are always friendly and just as important - genuine. I'm selfishly sad to see when folks eventually leave to pursue various ventures. - Ego: There is none. Love it. - Food: Absolutely delicious and consistent(!). You can tell that the fine folks in the kitchen care about what they serve you. I've tried just about everything, but my favorites are the Shishito peppers, the cheeseburger (I add an egg on top), and the corned beef hash. Although, I am a big fan of a number of their soups too... Anyway, if you've read any of my reviews you know I tend to keep them short. Obviously, the Table deserved something just a little bit more to give them a ringing endorsement. I appreciate you taking the time to read this review."}, {"review_id": "CxbuU2aWg32oOw0mOxXjbg", "user_id": "2_WgyMLMPD0XAYrtiw7S1g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "I'm not going to say it was bad, because it wasn't, but it wasn't SUPERB.

Out of all the brunch spots in Willow Glen, this one always appears to be the liveliest and most crowded. I was looking forward to seeing what all the hype was about.First of all, there's the long wait times. This is to be expected on a Sunday morning. I believe we waited about 90 minutes for a table for 2. I didn't mind because it was a beautiful day outside. We walked down to Starbucks to grab some coffee and killed time by checking out all the cute dogs in the area.We eventually receive a text that our table is ready and to check in with the host. Cool. We waited a couple of minutes because there's two random girls standing in front of the host station. Once we realized they weren't in line, we walked up to the station and waited ANOTHER couple of minutes to get the host's attention. He was there doing nothing important. Not sure why it took him so long to acknowledge our existence. He tells us to check in with the host inside. Ok, maybe the text should've been clearer about who we needed to check in with. So we walk inside and the two random girls from outside follow us. The host inside acknowledges them first even though we got there before them and seated them first. I'm already starting to get mad because we waited over an hour for this table and now I feel like I'm being ignored. We waited ANOTHER couple of minutes for them to get the table ready, even though the text said our table was already ready for us. Hmm, maybe we wouldn't have to wait so long if they didn't seat those girls before us.I order the vegetarian chilaquiles and bottomless mimosa, of course. The food was fine. I'm glad the server asked if I wanted my poached egg to be cooked a little bit more, but besides that, the food didn't blow me away. Maybe I'm spoiled by all the awesome brunch places in SF and Oakland, but it was just ok. I think my experience was mostly ruined by the bad service here. When I order a bottomless mimosa, I expect my glass to be refilled every single time it's empty. That's the definition of bottomless and that's how every brunch place I go to works. The server did a horrible job at doing this. By the time we were eating, it wasn't super busy anymore. We watched her do \"busy work\" like folding napkins and etc. I used to be a bartender, so I know what it's like. You try to keep yourself busy when it's slow, but our glasses were empty and there were empty plates on our table. The server's job is to ask us if we're done with the plates, so they may remove them, and to refill our bottomless mimosas, but she was too busy folding napkins. We ordered the beignets as dessert, but I wish we hadn't because they were already rushing us to pay and leave. I just wanted to enjoy the beignets and have some more of my BOTTOMLESS mimosa, but I no longer felt welcomed here. The server already left the check and was checking back to see if we paid but didn't bother to refill our drinks. We weren't obviously done if we barely just got the beignets.I would've came back despite the food just being ok if the service was better, but I honestly don't want to come back here again. There are so many other brunch places in the area, so why bother?"}, {"review_id": "486voeYNIyJzi_07263Z6w", "user_id": "A5LiLVxDDEoTDCqGjRTbfw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "My second time here for happy hour on a Wednesday evening with one of my girl friends.
