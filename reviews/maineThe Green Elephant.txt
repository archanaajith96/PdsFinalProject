Green Elephant is five star material.A few weeks ago I was feeling like life was kicking me in the face. I figured that takeout noodles and soy nuggets could boost my mood, and DANG WAS I RIGHT.I ordered online, and the food was already waiting for me when I arrived ten minutes later. I was nervous about how the food would hold up as takeout, but it was FABULOUS. The soy nuggets are to die for, as well as the sauce they come with. The Singapore noodles are life changing. They are just necessary in life.I also ordered delivery through 2DineIn recently. The website estimated an hour delivery time... and they showed up with my piping hot, delicious food in fifteen minutes! I couldn't believe it.Great service, and the flavors of their dishes are unparalleled. All hail."}, {"review_id": "FGkM2HSmsZ7FI-1q4W2g-Q", "user_id": "o7phut4nClZ74kcXKsfVEQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "The Green Elephant offers amazing food with a variety of plant based meals to choose from. Inside, the small restaurant is bright and lively, but calm at the same time. As for the food, it was delicious. I ordered vegetable dumplings which were mild yet flavorful, with the perfect amount of spices. On the side, I ordered Brussel sprouts which were perfectly cooked and tossed in soy sauce. The service was excellent as well. My food was served quickly and the waitress was attentive and friendly. This will definitely be one of my new go-to lunch spots in Portland!"}, {"review_id": "oiZt6PK4K2J12YW-SRmkFA", "user_id": "uDBnapEGywTQ0ovaCu7Orw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "Sunday night for dinner-time needed no reservation at all. Largely open setup with lots of space for groups of any size.Looking over the menu, was happy to see the lack of seitan in the dishes (not a fan). Between two people: ordered the Hot & Spicy Soy Sticks ($7), Singapore Noodles ($13), and Thai Basil Fried Rice ($13). Soy Sticks came out first - two \"drumsticks\" covered in a sweetish spicy sauce. Surprisingly juicy inside, and wonderful to dip over again into the plate. Entrees come up next; Thai rice has a sticky texture with bold spices. Noodles have a more balanced taste, making them pretty good to eat together. Tofu was cooked well in both dishes (slightly crispy). Solid all-around service and food. Would recommend for any vegetarians in the area."}, {"review_id": "3whi-38nnrVJO_LlR6O5EQ", "user_id": "l6RlZ31H6_a9GPvY83Y3Iw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "High quality veggie fare. My companion had the pad Thai which was incredible; I had the tofu and vegetable stir fry. Perfect portions--not huge that we felt gross eating our entire dishes, but not small like a fancy bistro. Just right!  Also, the sauces are not goopy, thick greasy feeling Asian sauces you find at some low end Chinese take out. The sauces on both our dishes were light and full of flavor, just the right amount of sauce to cover everything but not sloppy. I find that is often a tough fence to straddle. Dessert shone like a diamond. I had the chocolate orange mousse pie. See the photo. It was creamy, smooth, and developed the most amazing flavor. Yes, this place is delicious and you should eat here. Beware: the French press coffee they offer at dessert is so good, you'll cry when it's gone. My only wish is that this restaurant also offered meat dishes because I bet they could cook the @&$% our of it."}, {"review_id": "3lJqnGO0q4KEVUZyFZiGzA", "user_id": "reOsjVoPYkAQyVVau2crFg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "A small quaint spot and a gem in Portland, Maine. I am so glad we went for our first dinner and meal in Maine.Mom and I found this veggie bistro in town, was about a 25 minute wait, but we took a pager that allowed about a 2 block walk for range. We started with the tofu veggie summer rolls, peanut sauce, of course and added some hot sauce on my portion, was delicious. I had the tofu and veggie with green curry, was so tasty and Mom loved her tofu Pad Thai, mild, of course."}, {"review_id": "3R3NppkBqzOT2xaIfI2a6g", "user_id": "mGTLj3FGCCtXAK8-W4Cw5g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/16/2017", "text": "I love it here. I'm not a vegetarian (that's NEVER going to happen) but every once in awhile, I like to take a month and go a meat-free. This is the place to go! I was skeptical of soy-meat because it doesn't look good and it really doesn't have a taste, but it mimics the texture of meat and that's enough for me. If you come here, you MUST try the brussel sprouts. They are out of this world good. I was slightly disappointed with them last night because they weren't cold, but they also weren't hot. They still tasted good, but I wish they had been warmer. We also tried the chive dumplings which were also really good. They didn't look like any dumplings I've ever had before, they were flat!The service is really great here. Because of the rain, the restaurant was empty so we had our choice of tables and even though the waitstaff weren't busy, we didn't feel rushed to order and they didn't hover. It was also great that when my boyfriend ordered a spicy soup, but it wasn't really hot enough, they gave him a little bowl of chili oil with the warning to go easy with it. My noodle dish was really tasty. Spinach noodles with vegetables in a spicy ginger sauce. The ginger was in long strips and looked just like a noodle. There were quite a few times when I had a mouthful of ginger. I didn't mind because I love ginger.I was so stuffed at the end of our meal that we didn't even attempt to order dessert even though the waiter described a special dessert to us that wasn't on the menu and it sounded really fun. I would go back for the flower pot filled with edible dirt and granola. It's great that Portland can sustain an all vegetarian/vegan restaurant. I didn't feel like I was missing out by not having any meat in my meal."}, {"review_id": "-qUB8jBJ8jnQisFdzjSHqQ", "user_id": "Ad8gbzerN_nWwMuxxJmFbQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "Whenever I'm in Portland, I try to stop by the Green Elephant to get my favorite salad.

It was busy, but they were very capable of keeping up with the crowd. I ordered the Tikka Masala and 3 months later am still dreaming of it. If I lived in Portland, this would be my go-to restaurant. I also had the orange chocolate cake, which was really delicious! So much so, that I ordered one as a gift to send to the table next to me on my way out because they were admiring it. The waitress was really friendly and helpful, since I hadn't been there before and I was indecisive. I keep hoping my employer sends me back there so I can have that tikka masala again!!!

Moderately spicy... now I like my food pretty spicy so I asked for them to make it a 3 out of 4 stars, but next time, I would go for the full four stars as it was barely warm.  That was my only complaint about this dish.  This MASTERPIECE had so many delightful yet subtle flavors going on that I could not stop eating it.  And the crunch on the soy filet was like it was made in the skillet of somebody's grandmother in the deep South.2) Tofu Tikka MasalaSpinach, edamame and chickpeas in a Masala curry sauce. Served with brown rice seasoned with curry powder, peas, carrots and shallots.  My wife ordered this one and didn't share very much... and for good reason.  This had a wonderfully warm Masala curry and the perfect mix of vegetables to add texture and crunch to the dish.3) Peanut CurrySlow cooked in coconut milk with soy-meat, chickpeas, sweet potatoes, carrots and onions.  Another WOW dish that we all enjoyed. We were going to bring home some leftovers, but when we looked down... magically it was all gone.We hope to return to Portsmouth one day and will definitely make this a return spot for lunch and/or dinner."}, {"review_id": "VIRV1BdUZPIGcONjyQBOXw", "user_id": "D05jzLKZanNPQ-OJknvQAQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "The Green Elephant is a really amazing restaurant! We walked in to order some take-out on a Tuesday night and it was packed with people.

The food came out in 20 minutes- not a bad wait time at all! Each of the dishes were flavorful and well-made, but our favorites were definitely the Thai Ginger noodles (the slices of ginger added the perfect amount of spice and bite) and the Mango Curry (the curry paste base was to die for).

I'm not a veggie, but can appreciate good vegan cuisine. This place really nails it. I wish I had spent more time in Portland to visit here a second time so I could have tried more of the menu. The brussels sprouts were a nice start, as well as a tempura fried fiddlehead salad special. It's so nice to have seasonal ingredients highlighted and this salad had a nice light flavor to it that we kept using the brussels sprouts to add to the flavor. Yes, the flavor of the brussels alone were good but there was something about the salad special that just made everything taste that much better. We split the banh mi (another special) and the veggie citrus \"spare ribs\" dish. There were leftovers and we were fighting over bites of the veggie citrus spare ribs the next day. The banh mi was great as well - Green Elephant really got the bread perfectly, which is most of the battle in that sandwich. Cute space, amazing food.

The Green Elephant was recommended to me by all the Portland, Maine residents I had the pleasure to talk with. When I walked into the place, it immediately reminded of the trendy, funky restaurants I often dine at in my home town of Asheville, NC. The staff was quite friendly and the service was prompt. The menu was an eclectic mix of Thai themed dishes. I honestly couldn't decide what to try so I decided to order 3 appetizers and a dessert! The appetizers included spring rolls, wantons and soy based nuggets (all with individual sauces). The nuggets were pretty amazing. The spring rolls and wantons were definitely top quality but were honestly a little bland for my taste (this is coming from someone who has an intense love of salt though!). It would have been a little helpful if they had salt and pepper shakers on the tables...but maybe adding your own spice is frowned upon? The dessert was chocolate orange mousse pie and it was hands down one of the best desserts I've ever eaten! I would go there again just to have another slice of pie. The menu prices are definitely on the higher side but you are paying for high quality ingredients and expert preparation.

I was a little disappointed in the serving size since I was still hungry when we finished eating. But that could be my fault since I am not a dainty person.

The place was hopping and full of happy looking hipsters, which always a good sign, right? I ordered the Singapore rice noodles to go and they were amazing. They were spicy (I ordered a 4 out of 5 on the spice level) and chalk full of fresh crisp bok choy, bell peppers and snow peas. The bits of tofu were stir fried and delicious. My only regret was that I didn't more food!
