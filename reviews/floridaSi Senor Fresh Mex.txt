Last night We visited this place for the first time and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The ambience inside was fun and festive, and the food was great. Between the three of us I tasted the shrimp quesadillas, enchiladas, chimichangas with chorizo and beef, and Asada fries. Everything was excellent and flavorful- even the rice, which is usually bland at other Mexican places. All the food was seasoned well and was very fresh. All the salsas were flavorful and it was obvious that they were house-made (definitely worth the extra charge). I also had two margaritas- they were perfect blend of sweet and sour and were balanced well- not watery. The only thing I didn't care for here was the fact that you have to order at the counter and then have food brought to you after you seat yourself. I'm not a big fan of this, and I'd prefer a full service format instead, at least for dinner time. Granted, you don't pay tip this way, but it's just my personal preference. I also would've liked more interaction with the waitstaff. I mean, they were courteous, but not necessarily warm and conversational. Aside from these things, everything was great. The live music was also great and added to the fun. Each night they have different entertainment and it starts at 8pm. This is definitely my new go to Mexican place!"}, {"review_id": "0NuzIP2BPvYNoHf0-C--jA", "user_id": "AMrhEi4bLvaAcC2XggeBsg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "This is my most frequented Mexican restaurant in Jacksonville. I am so glad that they just recently expanded. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food (I know, unpopular opinion) but this place does satisfy my picky palate. I usually get the shredded chicken chimichanga or quesadilla with rice.I like that they have a salsa bar here so you can try a bunch to find your perfect one. My boyfriend and I always get the guacamole here as well, it is always delicious and fresh. I like that they have variety here and that its quick counter service, you can come here for lunch or dinner easily."}, {"review_id": "Sy0aRHVcKAK3O5UaM8t9Eg", "user_id": "L39R59V83SMtntSqcK8E3g", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "After reading a bunch of the reviews on yelp we decided to try this place. I came with  a fairly large group. I opted for the larger sized carne asada fries with guacamole. My portion was small even though I got the larger size. . My food was cold and tasted nothing like carne asada should.  The fries were probably the cheapest worst fries I  have ever tasted. One of the our groups food didn't come out, even though we spoke to the cashier twice. We had to ask for a manager before the food finally appeared.  We had to ask for our chips about 3 times and it came when the food came. The experience was so bad, I stopped eating to write this review. The concept is decent but the execution is very poor. It's self service where you order at the counter and they bring the food out. The guy cashier with the curly hair was nice. Only reason for the one star. Based on today's experience, I wouldn't recommend and I'm definitely not coming back."}, {"review_id": "PWoAnJ_PrF3u5G5p5hvcbg", "user_id": "CHzrqfoktd1_z3paHRKuRA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Haven't been here since the remodel. The prior visits were damn good but this last one was a little lackluster. The carne asada mexican tacos on double corn tortillas were just ok. Meat seemed skimpy and didn't really have that much flavor. The corn tortillas also didn't seem that fresh. Maybe it was because we had lunch at 2:30 but to me, that would mean the lunch crowd went thru and everything should be fresh.The remodel looks really good. I did like the old feel and set up as it was more local. You can tell that success has been good to this business and they obviously invested more into their business. While this meal wasn't as good as I expected, I do have a soft spot since they are local and prior visits were spot on. Hopefully it was just an off day and my next visit will be more of what I am accustomed to."}, {"review_id": "XKruHx2ql0jV1zsW_FLHpg", "user_id": "PTVLT2wEUrFgr_hT5uldoA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "Si Senor Fresh Mex brings it! This was my first time visiting. My friend wanted Mexican so I got on the Yelp app to see what was close and this place popped up.You order your food at the counter and then find your own table. The cashier was friendly and asked if I would like some guacamole and queso to go with my meal. I love guacamole so I wanted to try their's and I am so glad I did! The guacamole was brought out before I even found my table. It made a wonderful appetizer and the little that I had left I put on my entree. I love guacamole that has tomatoes and onions and basically flavor. This was one of the best that I have tried!For my entree I ordered the #4, Tacos Ranchero. I had one chicken and one steak. There were rice and beans with cheese served as the sides. My entree was bursting with flavor. Both the chicken and steak meats were prepared nicely. And I was pleased that the steak wasn't all grisly like a lot of places. Don't forget to check out the homemade salsa bar. You can help yourself to any of the six salsas. They range in heat and you can tell by the number of peppers displayed by each name. I had the Ranchero and Poblano salsas. Both were excellent!We were there on a Saturday and received a bonus, live music. I loved the decor and vibe of the spot. If you like Mexican you should stop by and check them out."}, {"review_id": "41D87F_TXXdHgok8JkJ_QQ", "user_id": "NyKnTQPZj_OcZAXHpQBaWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "This was my first time in this restaurant, I must say it's pack and full! First I think it was because of Cinco de Mayo but nonetheless their food was amazing. It's a little bit pricy comparing the amount of food that they give you however the quality of the food is top notch so can't complain. They have variety of beers including modelo.

The portions are pretty big especially the burritos! Big ole bundle of joy. I love how they offer Mexican Tacos with onions and cilantro or American Tacos with lettuce, cheese and tomatoes. A taco is not just a taco! Here the choices are almost endless...pork, steak, fish, shrimp and grilled chicken....Want to add on rice and beans, no problem. Gosh I get so full when I eat here. Did I mention salsa bar? Each salsa has a unique and flavorful taste. Each salsa is labeled as well so you know what you are getting.Radishes, peppers and onions are on the bar. Tacos are $2.50 each on Tuesday.

I love Tex Mex so the expectation isn't that high because I know how much I love the food so I figured it's gonna be good regardless. I opted for the larger sized French fry thing with steak and all the fixings. $10.99 My wife got the burrito, $8.00 I paid $3.75 for exactly 2 fl oz's of queso. My wife had a veggie burrito and I tasted it, the rice and refried beans had very little flavor- really bland. My portion was small, I mean really small. I had opted for the larger size and it barely fills a small dinner plate. If the large size is small, the regular size must come on like a coffee saucer. It tasted exactly as you would expect food service seasoned fries would taste if you put nacho toppings on them. The idea is solid but this isn't exactly gourmet so why so small?It's self service similar to Tijuana Flats but no where near as friendly. The menu is like poster board on a wall behind the cashier, nothing you could hold and study and hard to read. The cashier is not friendly and was impatient. So ultimately you have to just kinda rush and order something to keep the line moving. So it's not a full service restaurant which is fine except nobody will tell you that . Tex mex is my absolute favorite food group so it's pretty hard to screw it up for me. Based on today's experience, I wouldn't recommend and I'm fairly certain I won't come back."}, {"review_id": "6R5PjlV6SFMsJI5EyDkc1A", "user_id": "od0fu1L9OqE5E9XywRffZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "Things started off shaky when two different servers gave me the wrong dish twice, but I didn't have to wait too long before finally getting my order. I ordered the Si Señor tacos with grilled chicken. The menu says the order comes with 2 tacos, but I received 3 (not sure if it was to make up for the mix-up). The tacos were delicious! The ingredients were simple but the flavor was extraordinary. Usually, the tacos that I have from other restaurants barely have any meat with it, but these tacos had enough meat to last me to the last bite of my tortilla. My friend ordered the carne asada fries for us to share and that one was a winner as well! Overall, the prices were reasonable and the portions were large enough to make you full or, if you're like me, full with leftovers for the next day. :)"}, {"review_id": "qm0mZXU44-rWsvG63d8Uqg", "user_id": "LWww6A5boixkH9ehLPm6FQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Three words: CARNE ASADA FRIESTheir tacos are really good too.I have yet to eat inside the restaurant, but whenever we order for pickup the food is always ready and packaged neatly."}, {"review_id": "nNHiybES-TR0pv6xv1QzSA", "user_id": "2Sp0QCuZS_jADqXBW0sdkg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "NEW AND EXPANDED DINING ROOM.
