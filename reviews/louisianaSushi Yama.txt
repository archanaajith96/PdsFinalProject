My wife and I gorged on more than a few dishes and were super thrilled with what we got. Service from the wunderkind Megan was over the top good- so thanks!  Started with a really great charred brussel sprout appetizer- think buttered popcorn but healthy. Bomb. Sashimi was cut thick and freshness was apparent- it's clear that they are not holding on to their fish here- quality is paramount. Our main event was the off-menu (but you must get) Korean sushi entree. This is a platter of spicy tuna, perfectly seasoned rice, jalapenos, nori, garlic slices where you can make your hand rolls! It's so amazing and so fun. Again it's off menu- but they'll hook it up- it's a great deal for the amount of food at $30. Pineapple saki was stellar and large Kirins always go down smooth. Pumped to have this in the neighborhood. Keep doing you boo."}, {"review_id": "xX1vB7gXgkwpJ4hDAmQZLg", "user_id": "9GNozgkzqjlg3rWO_poELg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "Thrilled to have this delicious sushi place so close to home. Sushi is my favorite food. I'm new to town and have tried tsunami, umami, masa and now here.  Sushi Yama is my favorite! The fish was very fresh, the rice was great, warm, perfectly cooked with the right amount of rice vinegar and the service from Megan was incredible. The prices are expensive but I think it's worth it. My favorite dish was an off menu item \"The Korean\" - build your own hand rolls with spicy tuna, garlic, cucumber and jalapeños. The house cold sake was a fruity joy as well. I'll still go to masa when I want that AYCE vibe.. but I have a feeling I'm going to be a regular at Yama. So.

This is a sushi place for raw fish lovers. They do serve the freshest fish. The little rice roll is pricey but totally worth it with all the fish that comes stuffed in it, and it has an amazing dipping sauce that is light and pairs with the roll perfectly. The off the menu Thuyvi roll is a more elaborate roll with only a small amount of tuna but includes a spicy guac, which is interesting but great. The cucumber salad before you order and the pineapple slices with your check are a nice touch. The ambiance and service are nothing to brag about, but their fish gives this place all 5 stars."}, {"review_id": "wYMyGtqcrdvsxXx3JGZO3Q", "user_id": "7qRSEw8FU-wzw_SCniB_ww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/4/2017", "text": "Sushi Yama is simply the best sushi in all of Baton Rouge. Some may like a better view or a bigger location, but Sushi Yama has the best food by far. The fish is always incredibly fresh. The special rolls are inventive and a great mix of flavors.

My two favorite items are the spicy tuna lover which is a big bowl of raw tuna and avocados and the Fuji mountain roll."}, {"review_id": "fDV9xsuR_3yXqU8gKITN0g", "user_id": "FdBMqbmkWwav4soZcaHwlw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/20/2017", "text": "My go to place for sushi as sushi options in the city can be quite limiting. Love the salmon here. Frequently order pink lady roll, George roll and the sashimi salad. If coming in during busy time, order can be inconsistent. We'll find our roll break apart whenever picking up a piece w our chopsticks. Although prompt when taking our order. Service is still lacking. I believe it has to do with being a popular place in Baton Rouge, there is lack of care from the servers. It's common to either wait the long time for server to come back with the check or they don't bother asking our table whether we're interested in dessert."}, {"review_id": "3TScLMo5oWuZMutJWylLBg", "user_id": "JN-zGqEp3VrSXKqfTEG9jQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2017", "text": "I have been here so many times and they always exceed my expectations with both service and quality!

I was introduced to this place by a friend who loves it and eats here regularly and then, not long after I made my first visit, I was talking with another friend who spent 17 years of her life in Japan and knows a thing or two about quality Sushi. She said that this place and Ichiban are her top picks in Baton Rouge - with this one being her first choice. So - don't just take it from me - take it from someone who knows what she is talking about and - if you're a sushi lover - you need to check this place out. So what makes this place memorable for me? For starters, the food is fantastic. Creative combinations, fresh ingredients, and attractive presentations make for a satisfying meal every time. I've had about 20 different rolls here, I suppose, and have loved everyone of them. Some a little more than others! Today I tried the Crunchy Roll, the cucumber salad, and the seaweed salad - delicious as usual. The seaweed salad is fresh, cold, and comes in a generous portion size. The sushi rolls always stand on their own, flavor wise, but come with plenty of ginger and wasabi if you want to play with the flavor and heat intensity a little bit. Secondly, the service is first rate. The wait staff are always friendly, prompt, well-informed about the menu, and are very accommodating.  Thirdly, the extras are a nice touch. I'm old enough to remember when \"lagniappe\" was a regular part of many people's businesses - and not just restaurants - but all kinds of places. It's nice that when you sit down here they bring you a nice sampler of their cucumber salad right away and then, at the end of the meal - some fresh, sliced pineapple wedges to balance out the palate with a little sweetness before you depart. These \"bookends\" make for a nice welcome, and a friendly farewell - and leave you with a good feel about the place - which you would have anyway from eating here. But it's that little something extra - that sends a strong signal that says they are thinking about their customers. Always a treat to come here..."}, {"review_id": "yfvz4Gwn0GKlKZOt7ZcqHw", "user_id": "lnPbUzNdV64A3tUsPH9qEw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/24/2017", "text": "Best sushi in Baton Rouge.

Small dining room packed with tables with a tiny 6 seat bar near the restrooms and a sushi bar that can't seat more than 10.  It was very crowded.  Which it being a Tuesday night, did intrigue us. Another thing that caught our eye was the specials board.  Interesting sounding rolls  like Mafia and Silver and other things like White Fish Ceviche sounded interesting.  We perused the menu and were a bit disappointed with the Sake selection.  (We always get sake with sushi...Is there any other way?)  I remembered another Yelper writing about the Pineapple Sake, so we went with that. It was served cold and had a definite pineapple flavor. Not too sweet and not to dry. We liked our choice.After talking to our server, we ordered the Mafia Roll, Silver Roll, Sexy Roll and Whitefish Ceviche.  The whitefish ceviche was so good.  Slivers of fish, with fresh jalapenos and orange slices drizzled with oil.  We were equally as pleased with our rolls.  Unique flavors and texture combinations in each one that just melt in your mouth. Smokey, spicy, tart, sweet, crunchy..   We have eaten a lot of sushi and we both agreed these were not your run of the mill rolls. No basic California roll here.  We didn't even use soy sauce or wasabi.  That is a first for me....We ended our meal with Green Tea ice cream and again were surprised.  I like green tea ice cream, but this was different.  In your face green tea flavor with just a hint of sweet.  If I didn't know better, I would have thought I was chewing on green tea leaves.  We left full, satiated and planning our next trip to this place."}, {"review_id": "PUJcdfu0Cp7kATGiG-MWkA", "user_id": "OMvvGynfXhz4E65gE3TjsA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "Very nice place.

It's one of our favorite places for sashimi/sushi. We're not big on rolls with rice so majority of places we go, we like to try things that are simply fresh. You can definitely tell that the fish here is the freshest you can get from any sushi spot in town.Since we usually do sashimi or sashimi style dishes, most of our food are apps. We ordered the Atlantic Salmon, Tiger Shrimp, a yellowtail dish that isn't on the menu, hamachi Kama, and the sushi chefs usually send us something random every now and then. I also love Uni but we usually go on Saturday and by that time, it's sold out. First of all, you get a complimentary cucumber/crabstick salad. Simple and refreshing. The Atlantic salmon, is a must try. There's salmon sashimi with mandarin, pine nuts, scallions, a soy/ponzu concoction, and truffle oil. De-freaking-lish. Anytime someone tells me they're going, I recommend this.Next we got our yellowtail dish. We request for slices of yellowtail, jalapeños, and ponzu. We order this everywhere we go because yellowtail is mah faveeeee. This never disappoints.Our hamachi Kama (yellowtail neck) came out shortly after and it's always pretty good. Basically a fried fish neck with a dipping sauce, which I forgot to take a picture of because the plating is sparse.The tiger shrimp is an awesome textural change to balance the texture of raw fish. It's a shrimp wrapped with noodles and fried topped with spicy mayo and eel sauce with a lightly dressed salad underneath.Tonight, one of the chefs sent us the spicy tuna lover, which I believe is on menu. It's a tuna sashimi appetizer with avocados in a soy based sauce with masago and jalapeños. Pretty good, will order again. After the meal you also get a complimentary slice of pineapple, which I have no idea how they pick the perfect pineapples but they're always ripe but not overly ripe! Overall, we love this place. It's a little pricey but when you can actually taste what kind of fish you're eating and the freshness, it's so worth it!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-yama-baton-rouge?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
