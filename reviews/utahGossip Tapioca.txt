The shrimp wasn't as fresh and charred. You can tell it's a different chef than the last time we were in. I got the shrimp chow fun bowl. It was meh. Not gross not exploding With flavor. I should have went With my nose and ordered the pho. 4/10I also ordered the tropical drink. It was bland and a lot to chew 3/10. We liked the shrimp spring rolls. Fresh with a flavorful sauce. Loved the fresh mint leaves 10/10"}, {"review_id": "xUPIYF9LBugCud7syr5eJw", "user_id": "LS4v_pJ0FHJA4uQ9KYwbsQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Updating. Pho was delightfully on point!!!  The flavor was very good and not underwhelming like other places. It also didn't taste like concentrate broth either. Will come back when I'm in the area. I got a regular sized coffee, at least what I thought was a coffee... they gave me the option to have it blended and because it sounded fancy, I took it. Yum. It was like a Vietnamese coffee Icee. Bomb!"}, {"review_id": "aKmEbGlsiavNFMCjqTnhbw", "user_id": "dFsdMDye7h319z8hzRGrTg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Since it very first opened, I've been to Gossip more times than I can count. In the beginning, they only had boba, which is what I would come for. What originally made me a fan was that while the other big boba chain that was (is?) in SLC at the time only used syrups, Gossip uses real fruits. I've tried too many of the boba flavors to count, but my go to is the blended coconut with the mini tapioca (I prefer the mini tapioca to the normal size).After a while, they remodeled and expanded their space, and started serving food. I've tried pretty much everything on their menu. Their menu includes the usual suspects at a Vietnamese restaurant: pho, vermicelli noodle bowls, rice plates. They also have some Chinese food options as well, like flat noodles and sweet and sour chicken; I wouldn't come here for the Chinese food, but the pho, vermicelli noodle bowls, and rice plates shine. The food is always consistent and tasty at a good price. It kind of has a whole-in-the-wall feel to it, which is good in my opinion, since all of the best Asian food is found in such places. The staff is generally friendly. One thing to note is that when it gets busy it takes a long time for your food to come out, so I wouldn't recommend this for a quick bite; this makes sense since its a small business with a little kitchen.Overall, it's one of my go-to's for a meal when I feel like I want some Vietnamese food."}, {"review_id": "k0JpoTdEn3m8BD7HQNnmAw", "user_id": "jHnUM2Uti7r_TjFudsw6sw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Not sure what I was expecting by going here.

I have heard this statement before and after visiting and trying various flavors I agree it is the best. They have so many flavors to choose from and even have creative combinations that isn't typically seen elsewhere. The smoothies are blended well (no ice chunks) and they aren't super sweet so or have a fake taste which has me coming back. They also serve up Vietnamese food and rate well in my book. I like their spring rolls too, they use both pork chashu and shrimp in theirs. Beef pho has a really nice flavor too."}, {"review_id": "ZyeenCvaG7w--Yd2wO-nLA", "user_id": "BOh5IKXk8cjJ2YifaoxEuw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "They've got the best boba in town. They have a wide variety of flavors to choose from. You can get milk teas and refreshing fruit flavors. You get to choose if you want the ice blended (so the drink is the consistency of a slushie) or uncrushed. I really enjoy the peach tropical, but unfortunately, they're oftentimes out of peach. I like opting for any of the drinks with some type of berry, such as the strawberry mango. It's got a nice blend of sweetness and a tart zing. I mainly drop by for a boba drink as a dessert and dine in less often.They've got some of my favorite restaurant fried eggrolls! They're really crunchy and a guilty pleasure. The fish sauce that comes with as a dip is also always good.They've got a full menu of Vietnamese and Chinese dishes. Their pho is a good pick, so is the vermicelli with bbq pork. Always large portions, you may have to take some home, and you'll definitely feel full."}, {"review_id": "i6K4p-3QQ9WVGlbsJ_n1jw", "user_id": "2fGOqwxGP-76niUDfooGKA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Omg , I thought this place was pretty good tbh. I'm Vietnamese and thought I was going to walk into another American Vietnamese restaurant like that place oh mai or whatever but I was wrong ! I was very satisfied with my pho. For someone who grew up in ca & there's literally pho places everywhere. I gtta say they live up to it. Oh they even have boba drinks. I ordered the durian smoothie and thought it was ok, could've been better. Maybe they didn't put that much durian? Idk. Anyways. My friend also ordered the springrolls . I didn't try it but it looked sub par. Nothing special :/ but then again maybe I'm just critical because I grew up making super bomb springrolls at home and or always got springrolls from brodards in oc. Anyways lol I ordered a rice plate for take out for my boyfriend and he said he enjoyed it. Service was good and prompt. I'll definitely be back!

The food and service were great and the consensus amongst all of us that we'd definitely come again. We started with an order of tofu spring rolls and pot stickers. I only had the tofu spring rolls: they were delicious! The peanut sauce that it came with wasn't overly sweet like a few that I've had in the past. Everyone else seemed to enjoy the pot stickers that were pan fried. Moving all the the main course: a variety of things were ordered. Some of my friends got some pho while others had noodle bowls. I had the vegetarian chow fun noodles. Yes I know that this is not a traditional Vietnamese dish; however, there were not that many veggie friendly options on the menu. My one other veggie friendly friend ordered the noodle bowl with tofu. I didn't want to get the same thing so that we could at least try off each other. Anyway, that's the reason for the one star reduction. Honestly it's more like a 0.5. Anyway, my meal was amazing! It had the right mix of veggies to noodles. See picture. They also have bubble teas and smoothies. I wanted to get one but definitely didn't anticipate one early enough to stop stuffing myself with noodles. I did try the coconut banana chocolate boba drink from my friend. It was amazing just like the food.  I will be back to try a beverage in the future for sure!"}, {"review_id": "j96fExV1Lbor6LkBpF-F-w", "user_id": "iFIQBnR5fJGmldH2ZxY2kQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/6/2017", "text": "Whoo hoo Viet represent! After a week in Utah, I was homesick for good rice plates, boba and eggrolls. This place made my tummy happy and my heart warm. Cha goi/eggrolls had the crispy rice wrapper instead of the yellow egg wrapper. They are generous with the filling. Served with picked veggies and nuoc mam. The pork chop for the House rice plate combo was super tender and flavorful. The chow fun noodles with char siu pork was okay. I don't like allot of bean sprouts and this had too much for me. The white chocolate coconut banana smoothie is BOMB!  They should rename that one WOMD for Weapon of Mass Destruction. Super addicting and smooth down the whistle. It's sweet and is considered a liquid dessert. Only if you like the lingering taste of banana though.

I probably come here at 10+ times a year. Mainly for the boba, my favorite is the tropical fruit mix. This is me usual drink and it hasn't changed other then removing a few toppings.

The pho and bun bo hue are good, but not the best. I do love their cream cheese wontons and egg rolls. Their spring roll sauce is starting to taste watered down.

Take your girlfriend here. Or your wife. Or your aunt. Or your sugar baby (she won't be impressed though because this place is not expensive. She'll still have a good meal though!). Maybe you'll run into me and you'll say \"hey, you're that girl from yelp!\" And I'll say \"omg!\" And we'll fall in love. I could be your future wife. YOU WONT KNOW UNLESS YOU COME HERE.
