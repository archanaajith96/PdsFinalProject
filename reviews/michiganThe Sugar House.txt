I wanted gin, and our server, Nick, came back with what I perceive as one of my favorite gin concoctions that I've ever had. In fact, two of them! One after the other , by the way , not at the same time! Ha ha HaThis place , right next to slows BBQ,  is outstanding with the craftiness of their drinks. There's a number of new places in town that are known for their craft cocktails and I have to say that this might be my favorite. Every single creation was truly fantastic in its complexity and taste.  I know that sounds corny for some folks, but it's the truth. It seemed like I was hit with about a half a dozen flavors with the first one and it all came together in a fantastic drink. Kudos to Nick for his ideas on what he thought I would like after I described to him the types of drinks that I like with Gin. Nick didn't make the drinks, but he understood what I might like and came back with perfection.  OUTSTANDING BAR."}, {"review_id": "TruegGcodpmbSW7Q8vwxpA", "user_id": "e2Wj6mfpPdfGg_M4oFW1Zw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Went here for a whiskey bourbon tasting so not a typical evening review.

Reminds me of a speakeasy vibe, without the uber trendiness that other places strive for. They don't need to try that hard here. Vast and unique drink menu with interesting flavors and combinations. Even better, the waiters/bartenders are fabulous at knowing exactly what to recommend. I said I loved tequila and spice so surprise me ;) I wish I could remember the name of the drink but let's just say my taste buds very satisfied. My friend ordered the Romeo and Juliet and loved hers as well. She loves a gin and tonic so this drink was an elevated, more sophisticated version of that. We ordered a couple bites from the menu and were pleased as well. (See pics). Nothing better than a simple cheese platter and pickled veggies to pair with some sexy drinks! ;) We will def be back."}, {"review_id": "nZX3-eH7uKKKftNINxmpeA", "user_id": "tflJHBJbObwyfqZhlsp54Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "This is one of my favorite watering holes.

Finally, I managed to go last weekend. It was wonderful! My boyfriend and I sat down at the bar and began to look around. Very cool ambiance, with dim lighting, classy feel, and fairly masculine vibes. The bartenders were very skilled and impressive to watch. We even saw one making a cocktail involving pouring flaming liquid back and forth between vessels! So cool! They were also very friendly and helpful in describing the cocktails and making recommendations. Very knowledgable and fun to talk to!The menu was very impressive, beginning with a list of seasonal cocktails inspired by great American novels. Very cool idea! Following that, there was a very large list of classic cocktails. We decided to go for the seasonal cocktails, as they sounded so impressive and interesting! I had the \"To The Lighthouse\", which was actually a scotch-based cocktail. Very unique! The egg white gave it a nice creaminess, while the nutmeg and masala syrup added some great flavor. So good! My boyfriend had the \"Grapes of Wrath\", which was pisco-based. He loved it! We certainly would have stayed and had another cocktail, but we had some more places to try on the agenda. I would definitely love to return, though!"}, {"review_id": "WHrPZZpo1dvQWtl4OkAQPA", "user_id": "A21q3ZenowJP27kOgnUsGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/30/2017", "text": "The best bar I have ever been to when it comes to drinks. When I say I have ever been to I mean literally this is the best Bar ever !!All of the bartenders here seem to be Mixologists or whatever you call it. Each of the drinks I had here took time to make....not cause they are slow but because they are perfectionists..So just be patient and enjoy the ride :). Even ordered a Ramos Gin Fizz and they nailed it to a tee. Usually bartenders hate making that. They have over a 100 craft cocktails. I really wish more lounges and bars shared the drink menu that is offered at the Sugar House. Check out the pics and Videos...hope they attached.This place gets packed, so you might have to wait. It's definitely worth the wait. They have interesting decor all around....I am not a fan of all the animal heads but whatever :). Good Company is always expected where i go , so it's on me. Good drinks is where Sugar House comes in and Great times is what happens when we mix it all up.Enjoy!"}, {"review_id": "whQUPg89ptdGODX1QZChEA", "user_id": "2B87F-KOoG4V17iTQ8r-pQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Drinks were good but service was horrible.

I had been wanting to try it for a while and finally got to today, a friend and I did Royale with Cheese for dinner, in Midtown (another first visit, for me!), and then drove over here for drinks.Drinks are not cheap: expect to pay anywhere from $8-14. However, the concoctions are quite marvelous, and also very tasty. Waitservice was great too, with our waiter frequently checking in on us, and he offered us different drinks if we didn't like what we ordered; my friend took advantage of that, as their (seasonal) cotton candy drink kind of tasted like straight alcohol. I had one of the seasonal drinks, which had gin and watermelon in it, which was good, and then a Brandy Alexander, which was fantastic. They have 101 cocktails (yes, you read that right ...) on the menu, not counting the 10+ seasonal drinks, which were circus-themed this summer (summer 2017). Atmosphere (speakeasy-esque) is definitely reminiscent of The Oakland (Ferndale) and The Last Word (Ann Arbor), but I liked Sugar House best out of all of those (with Last Word coming in a close second). I'll be coming back here sometime soon, most likely. They also have a small plates menu if you're hungry and want something to eat with your cocktails."}, {"review_id": "6H-lIGkyueXJiZsMXN_lnw", "user_id": "_CI76MQGtM4XGevZycZpRw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "Very sophisticated vibe.

How often do you find that in any business?They have a small food selection, and I'm really glad it's not any bigger.

Unique, but not \"out there\", these drinks won't push you far outside your comfort zone, but you certainly won't be bored. And with well over 100 libations on the menu, you'd be hard pressed not to find something you love. Of course it's expensive. Of course you'll have to wait for a seat on a busy night.
