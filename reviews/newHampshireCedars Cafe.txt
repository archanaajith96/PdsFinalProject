Stopped by Cedars Cafe for lunch recently and decided on the falafel wrap due to a slew of rave reviews. I was impressed with their prices as $5.99 will buy you a pretty decent-sized wrap with tomato, pickle, onion, and tahini. Other than the affordability of my meal, it's hard to find anything good to write about. My wrap was a bit dry and salty. The falafel was dense. While my wrap didn't completely suck, it was a far cry from the amazing descriptions in other yelp reviews.Service at Cedars Cafe is alright and the ambiance is meh. Considering how the food is just average, I don't understand how ratings are so high. More concerning are the claims that Cedars cooks up the best Mediterranean food in the state..."}, {"review_id": "DLJlFgQsvotNH5hrlCSkQA", "user_id": "dYKSZPf5x-5mza1D8pmyOw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "What a lovely surprise this little cafe was. Owner is super kind, helpful and prepares excellent Mediterranean food! Falafel was delicious as was the shawarma...and if you have kids who are picky eaters fear not there are crispy french fries as well. We sat and dined there, small place to sit and very casual which was great since our kids were just running around. Food was genuinely authentic and worth returning back to for sure! Support local fare eat good food!!"}, {"review_id": "Yp_eIWRgdoDoZ1gBptduqQ", "user_id": "_gv7jcJVr7UkA_JpqzBy3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "This place has the best falafel wrap in town!

Sure enough- they do have good falafel but nothing amazing. Their hummus and tahini that comes with the falafel is pretty good. I enjoy their tabbouleh- its nicely marinated with lemon, cracked wheat, parsley, and thinly chopped tomatoes. It tastes very good each time I visit.Their chicken kebab is probably my favorite thing on their menu- very tasty and unique spices. The service is fast, the food is reasonably priced and the taste is pretty good! Plenty of parking too"}, {"review_id": "NSeWZWnFca3If001Ln5ifw", "user_id": "OsGSPo9T7Nm075MzR434EA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "The food was fresh and tasty.

Dined on a Friday afternoon around 3 p with a friend. No one was in the sub shop when we arrived. A young lady and gentleman greeted us immediately and handed us menus. A variety of choices had us debating what to order. We decided on the lamb kabob dinner which comes with a choice of salad or hummus over rice and we chose salad and asked if fries could be substituted. The young lady looked to the gentleman who we learned was her dad and he gladly said \"yes\"...I can do whatever you want. We also ordered the chicken and beef kabob combination plate which is served with tabouli, hummus and pita bread.You order at the counter and seat yourself. There were about 8-10 tables ...all of which were available. They asked if we preferred our salad in advance and we said yes. It was served in a clear plastic takeout container but they did give us plastic plates. The mixed greens were very fresh with grape Tomatos, red onions and shredded carrots. A lemony vinaigrette dressing on the side. Our lunches arrived shortly in styrofoam takeout containers. The lamb kabobs were supposed to come with the fries but instead it was over rice. When we reminded the daughter that we wanted to substitute the rice with fries, she called over to her dad (also the cook) and he immediate apologized and happily started a batch for us.  The hummus was the best I've ever had.  I understand it's not hard to make (I've never made it myself) but this was unusually tastier than any I've ever had but I couldn't pinpoint what made it different.  The beef was very tender and cooked medium, our preference, the tabouli was very fresh and just right, the chicken was also very tender and had a nice char from the grill.  The rice was topped with thin slices of onions and peppers, a little too soft/mushy for my friend but perfect for me.  My friend thought the lamb kabobs were a bit overcooked.  I'm not a fan of lamb so couldn't comment on it.  She was also disappointed that the fries weren't hand cut.   5 stars for service and friendliness!  3 stars for environment (more of a sub shop than restaurant) and cleanliness.  Overall, we thought our lunches were very good with leftovers to boot! Total:  $31"}, {"review_id": "ga0JUycWdFB_dZHxg0xtYg", "user_id": "YHseo7g67rr0cgSd-sPtBA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/30/2017", "text": "The strip mall location next to a chain restaurant hides this little gem.
