We frequently talk about lobster among other foods and he said I should try this place. So I take a Lyft here, about a 13 min drive and upon arrival, my 2 friends and I are looking at the place like where is everyone? It looks semi deserted. I still walk in and after opening and walking through about 4 or 5 doors, we arrive in a dining room that has maybe about 2-3 other guests sitting at their tables. I'm immediately thinking, where did this guy send us? It's probably going to be terrible! Lol It gave me Italian mob meet up place feels lol...No but seriously! So we take our seats, look over the menu (which was very affordable by the way if you're comparing with California pricing). We order and grab salads from the mini salad bar adjacent to our table. Best salad I've had in AWHILE. It tasted like all of the elements of my salad were from such fresh quality products. The servers were very helpful. I dropped a couple of tomatoes while placing them on my place and was slightly embarrassed but they were so nice about it.Fast forward to halfway through my salad, I look up and it seems as if every table around the dining room had been filled. People were on dates, after work co worker dinners, I mean the place was packed! I figured we arrived at the perfect time. I had no idea this place would fill up like this! The food arrives!!! I ordered the Seafood Pallea, my friend ordered the baby back ribs with a side of yellow rice, veggies and mashed potatoes and my other friend ordered a steak with a side of yellow rice and veggies......Can you say huge portions of food! Again for a very affordable price!!! It was sooooo very good, all of it! We all took home doggy bags of food and I can honestly say that I day down and ate my food in 2 other sittings...that's how much food I had. And I'm no stranger to downing some food lol. I am absolutely planning my next trip here the next time I'm in town and what I will be trying next!"}, {"review_id": "4cdZM-SUc3F-Y0oZ1jwVHA", "user_id": "yayGaZ1JF0QDGWvLrOeqDg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "My Fiance suprised me and brought me here a few weekends ago. We didn't make reservations so we had to wait for about an hour. We found a place at the bar and grabbed some drinks while watching them cook the rodizio meat. It smelled amazing! We came in here with the intent to get a lobster and steak but quickly changed our minds!Our buzzer went off and it was time to eat! The bartender was no where to be found and the other 2 ignored us. It took us about 10 minutes to finally find her and get cashed out. This is my only complaint, the bartenders just weren't very attentive. Once we were sat we ordered the rodizio and everything happened pretty fast. Thank goodness, we were hungry!Everything we tried was phenomenal. So much food just coming at you non stop and it's all to good to turn down! My only suggestion is come here on a night that you don't have any other plans.. food coma central! Hope to make it back one day."}, {"review_id": "7T0RUoNIfbF2q2iiMu1ITA", "user_id": "vf09i6qL5BmSaCUZ2cwHHQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Fernandes is a giant operation in a less frequented side of Newark. There's a grand entryway, there's a downstairs dining room, there's an upstairs dining room, there's a large bar area. Despite the size, make a reservation if you're going with a large group. Our group of eight was seated upstairs. While incredibly noisy and warm, the upstairs dining room gives a great view of the rodizio being prepared. The name is misleading. Nothing about the menu leads one to believe this is a steakhouse. More accurately, this is a Portuguese restaurant that also happens to serve steak. The menu is extensive and a bit overwhelming due to the size. Vegetarians need not apply; there's literally nothing on the menu prepared without seafood, meat, or poultry. The menu is pricey but the portions are made to match; for example, an individual order of paella could easily feed two or even three.For starters, the group ordered garlic shrimp, clams in green sauce, and the cold antipasto. The garlic shrimp, as expected for a Portuguese restaurant in Newark, was delicious. While I don't eat clams, I dunked my bread in the green sauce a number of times and was happy with the result. The cold antipasto looked like something you'd get at a mediocre Italian restaurant. For my main, I ordered the rodizio (when in Rome, right?), as did two others at the table. We were provided with family style sides of rice, beans, French fries, and fried plantains. I was very disappointed that there were no Portuguese chips, as you typically are given with your meal in Ironbound. Unlike other rodizio restaurants, at Fernandes you are only given one pass at each meat. The more expensive cuts at given towards the end of the experience, so leave some room. I was satisfied with the preparation and temperatures of the meat; I like beef on the rare side, and was usually able to grab a slice that was to my liking. The table ordered red and white sangria. Both were too sweet for my taste and not properly balanced.While there are about 800 people working at Fernandes, the service could be improved upon. A few of the servers did not speak English, so they were unable to understand our requests for more water or bread. Multiple drink orders were incorrect or simply forgotten. It was not communicated to the table that the salad bar was included in the meal."}, {"review_id": "7Q5XuViH66yvRyMawJxWTA", "user_id": "WrmUzCpfiwU7_kW5MEDqyA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "This place is good, but expensive. I think it's worth coming to on a special occasion. It has valet parking only, which is annoying, but this isn't an area of Newark you necessarily want to park and walk over, so it's just part of the system.The food was great! I got the rodizio which is a good bet if you are hungry and love meat. All the meat I had was so full of flavor, but a lot of that flavor was salty, so delicious on the lips, but I felt super full by the end of the night. The salad bar they have is small and not worth visiting if you are getting the rodizio. We also got the mussels appetizer, which is really good in the white sauce and the chorizo I would have scarfed it all down if I wasn't having more meat later.From the rest of the party opinions, the cod was okay but the chips with it were amazing, and 1 person had lobster and it was great, the other had seafood paella which was mostly just the lobster, he expected more variety. They don't have a soda fountain, so soda is only by the bottle with no free refills.Overall I thought it was a nice night, and for a special occasion you can be a little gluttonous, but it might be a bit much for this to be a regular place to visit."}, {"review_id": "vCAIzTXi7IbkZYvD8mTWuw", "user_id": "JMqdDjXybyqdX5SpDl92ww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/8/2017", "text": "Came here last week in a group of 7 for rodizio. The food was great with a variety of options, multiple rounds of meat. The service was good. We had the red sangria which was tasty. They salad bar included was minimal comparing to other rodizio places in that area. Unless you are for the salad bar, the meat was great, various cuts of steak, chicken, pork, chicken heart and of course the pineapple at the end. The bread was served warm but no pao de queso lime some other places. Overall we enjoyed it, did not bring the kids but imagine it would be fine.

Always a good start. Because you get the salad bar, we only ordered one appt. The sausage was amazing and we devoured them. The usually nice sized salad bar was pretty empty this evening and wasn't replenished during our stay.Entrees were excellent. Surf and turf. Twin lobster tails. Racks of ribs. Sea bass. Tile cooked sole. Perhaps lobster was overcooked, but everything else was great.Desserts were very good as well and we split a few to end the evening with a sweet taste. Service was excellent.

This restaurant is in a little sketchy part of town. It doesn't help that it is not very well lit and that you are not sure where the entrance of the building is. I definitely power walked from my car to the resutrant to realize that I was at the club, to turn around and Power walk to the other building. Overall, the food was really good.  When you first look at the menu, you might think that it is really expensive, but when the food comes out, it's worth it. That staff was extremely nice and very organized. The only other draw back is trying to open the doors to get in and out of the restaurant. There is a strong wind tunnel which vacuums seals the doors shut.

I'd recommend it as a place to grab a bite to eat before or after an event at red Bull arena, prudential center, or nj pac.Food: 3 stars, they have a large menu almost similar to the diner style menu. Large selection of meats, fish and poultry dishes. I find the quality of their food to be around the median when compared to surrounding Iberian restaurants in the area. For instance, my sautéed pork filets, while having a magnificent presentation was overcooked hard and rubbery. It was drenched in Iberian gravy which tastes wonderful but I believe tries to hide the flaws in their cooking. They have also inflated their prices by at least 40 percent since the revitalization of Newark without improving the quality of their food. So go figure.Decor: 2.5 stars, Fernandes has a European spanish decor. The first floor has a tavern style feel while the second floor has a more European village feel with views of the kitchen roasting rodizio and a self serve salad buffet. So my biggest complaint here is that the second floor is an oven. It is uncomfortably hot upstairs. Service: 2.5 stars, the service is sort of mayhem here with waiters swarming around trying to take care as many tables as possible and no structure. Very similar to other restaurants in the ironbound. This leads to slow service when place food or drink orders."}, {"review_id": "KTZIRFo1RP152_Ahq9PGGA", "user_id": "NktxRBTtU3Gns0yDG21Ing", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "From the moment I walked in my partner and I were treated with plenty of attention.  They honored our reservation despite it being valentines day,  and having other people waiting who did not make a reservation.  They sat us right away.  The service was really good, they seem to have a system where a few waiters tend to an area in the restaurant.

Vegans need not apply. This is the place for huge portions of meats, grilled to your preference, solid Sangria in a variety of flavors, and friendly (if somewhat quirky) service.If you're truly hungry and want the rodizio experience Fernandes will be happy to steer you toward that. All you can eat and then some, but no sharing with other diners who've opted for something less than the $37.95 endless rodizio (32.95 at lunch mon thru thurs).I went for the grilled meat combination platter at 27.95, which was plenty of meat, with a side of delicious fries, veggies, and a great salad bar. The latter is included with most if not all entrees.You're going to end up springing for about $50 a person here, if you dine as most people do. However if you want to save some cash, sit at the bar and order any entree and one salad (or salad bar) between two people, and you'll easily have enough for two hungry people. Just don't ask to share the rodizio because they won't allow that.Our server, Rick, was friendly and helpful with a good sense of humor to boot. He delivered what we asked although it was apparent that he had too little support from one or two of the bus boys -- who acted as if they were working here on a  90 day community service sentence.We also tried the red sangria, which was delicious and enough for four people ( we're not big drinkers). The atmosphere in Fernandes is family friendly and a bit more upscale than many Newark eateries of this style (many of which have gone down hill in the last few years).Two in our party opted for the Rodizio, and they truly enjoyed the variety of offerings. All of the steak items were especially delicious, with a nice exterior char, but tender & flavorful center. We all left full & happy. Fernandes has plenty of monitored, onsite parking, although it's mandatory that you go valet -- which I don't care for -- but if that's how they need to control the onsite parking, so be it. For something different, and to bring out your inner carnivore, Fernandes Steak House is a great choice."}, {"review_id": "Y7IBmfKBOlZbDFSJCy45TA", "user_id": "_EEgJgZjx68Eso_T2XL4IQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/8/2017", "text": "This place was great, service was on point with everything from serving dishes where your food is still cooking on it and preparing it for you to making sure your drinks are topped off.  I know it's a steak house by name but the seafood is my favorite, grilled octopus and my favorite whole red snapper keeps me smiling.  The atmosphere is awesome with the people and all the little historical things around the restaurant make it pretty cool."}, {"review_id": "ka7YvG6SA_JK_rlKDrCrVA", "user_id": "cdDnhPsk5Yws9qa7q2D8cA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "I came here for a birthday dinner last month.
