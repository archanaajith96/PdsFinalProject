You are going to wait to eat here, for longer than you'd like.You'll wait outside, you'll wait inside, you'll salivate. You'll ask yourself why you are subjecting precious vacation time to wait on a line - there are surely other places to eat. However, this is serious southern comfort food at its best and since it's only open Monday - Friday, 10:30-2:30, a whole lot of people have to cram into a short window. This is a no frills cafeteria style restaurant. As you snake around the line, spy all the famous people who have eaten here before and ponder...did they wait too?When you finally make it close enough, you get a glimpse of the weekly menu.Practice and rehearse so when you finally get to order you waste no time. For me, it was the *chicken and dumplings* as my main. This was seriously one of the best stews I have ever encountered on earth, the broth is so deeply flavorful, chicken endlessly tender, and the dumplings just melt in your mouth. However, towards the end of the lunch shift - I could tell the vat of this stew was at the end too. Unfortunately, I didn't get as many big hunks of dumplings and chicken as I would have liked, as ultimately delicious as the meal was. Mac and collards were flawless. The chocolate chess pie was the grand finale, almost brownie like in consistency with a crispy flaky crust.Jeff couldn't resist the meatloaf and it was the best he's had in his life - even better than mama's. He even let me snag a bite of his fried green tomatoes, with an excellent crackling coating and creamy dipping sauce. The pecan pie was perfect - I can't give this meal enough praise.If only the line was shorter I would be here every day of the week!"}, {"review_id": "59Y8vOhfyytsj8cTIeTSSQ", "user_id": "duN44_ytFbs0WB0EF_F3xg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Arnolds is a staple in my life. Working down the street, Arnold's is a frequent lunch choice.For those who aren't familiar with Arnold's, they may be put-off by it's initial 'look', but the food is good and consistent, and it is what you'd expect. I have never actually sat-down and eaten in the actual restaurant, I always do take-out, which is nice because you skip the line. Not sure It's worth waiting in line for their food, though. Good for a quick pick-up and take home or to the office to eat. Make sure you double bag, though, because it will spill allover the place!"}, {"review_id": "iiGDzVCMWXuzSBfk68mkDg", "user_id": "l_KCiv1LVHfYMxuBUJEHjQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "Wow! If you haven't already, do yourself a favor and go eat here NOW! I can't believe it took me almost 3 years of living in Nashville before I checked this place out. Regrets!This cafeteria-style dining hall is situated in its own small parking lot. Come during operating hours and parking is free. Lines are always long but it moves quickly. I've waited between 15-20 minutes with a line out the door. You pick and point at what you want and you're handed a plate of goodness. Find a table after you've received your food and paid. Then prepare to feast!OMG THE FOOD WAS SO GOOD. I am a self-proclaimed salt-aholic so everything was seasoned perfectly for me. May be salt overload for others. So far I've been able to try:- Meatloaf: FREAKING MONEY. Easily one of the best I've had. Seasoned perfectly with roasted peppers too. So good.- Chicken and Dumplings: Flavors are spot on. I just wish I had more actual chicken and dumplings in mine. My bowl was more like soup. Dipping my corn bread into it was heaven though.- Mashed Potatoes: So much flavor! You definitely don't even need gravy.- Squash Casserole: So good!- Turnip Greens: I had a huge bit of pork fat in mine so you know it was good!- Fried Green Tomatoes: Awesome with their ranch dressing!- Broccoli Casserole: Another one of my favorite sides!- Bread Pudding: OMG tastes just like a cinnamon bun. Freaking addictive.- Strawberry Pie: A nice tarty/sweet combo!Their menu also changes daily so check it out prior to coming if you're set on getting something specific. Heck, I think everything was bomb so you really can't go wrong. Prices are reasonable and you will NOT leave hungry.Service was also fantastic for a cafeteria set up. Friendly food line people. They had a very friendly gentleman going around cleaning tables as soon as they cleared. One of the owners even stopped by our table several times to see how we were doing.Overall, fantastic food and experience! Can't wait to come back and try more! Bring friends!"}, {"review_id": "w6AP9I9e1RQ0ZiJD4s-Vqw", "user_id": "bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "I was so excited to try Arnold's that I headed here straight from the airport- they're only open for weekday lunch, so plan ahead. Each day has different featured dishes, and Thursday's choices allowed us to grab a plate of country-fried steak with sides of mac, mashed potatoes, and greens for the classic meat-and-three experience. Everything was generously portioned and cooked homestyle, ie don't come intending to stick to a diet 'cause everything's fried, covered in gravy, cooked in bacon, or all of the above. But it tastes so damn good. I shared the meal with my mom, which helped limit intake.TIP: Add on a slice of the Hot Pepper Chocolate pie if it's in stock though.

He really enjoyed his meal, I thought we wasted a meal in Music City. After visiting family in Alabama, we made a quick shoppin' stop and the gentleman recommended Arnold's as a go to local spot. Indeed, only moments after opening this place was filled with hungry fans. Classic country cookin' is served cafeteria style. It's not an inviting atmosphere - it's exactly like a school cafeteria. It even has a daily schedule. I didn't really find the food to be that much above either. I instantly regretted choosing chicken over the roast beef, but damnit I'd been *craving* fried chicken. That may have been a mistake. The mashed potatoes tasted like powdered mix and the gravy was watery with no flavor. The mac was runny and flavorless. The cornbread was dry and had a weird plastic taste. The pie was just cheap. The staff was incredibly friendly and the owner was out talking to tables when he wasn't on the line serving food. The energy in the place was great and it was cool to see all the acknowledgements and awards on the wall. I was excited to try a local legend, but disappointed it didn't live up to the hype."}, {"review_id": "BVs3qUVOe2vys6IThGcNJg", "user_id": "wPLqMcBw9lQNxHo2BpuDqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Amazing food!

Sad to say that the last four times I've eaten there over the past couple of years there has been a sadly steady decline in the food overall. Since the expansion, it seems that Arnold's is attempting to serve a hugely increased number of diners every day without any expansion of the cooking or serving capacity, and that is not a good thing.Last week roast beef was dry, and the portion I got was mainly crumbs from the cutting board-not a single independent SLICE of beef at all. Should have brought it back, but didn't. The cornbread was not at all fresh, the Country Fried Steak (yeah-I got TWO meats) tasted only of salt and maybe clove or allspice. Turnip greens were very good, but the fried green tomatoes tasted like they were fried in overused old oil-not up to snuff.God bless the place for being recognized, loved and for just being there period.

And when visiting and only have time for one place, you have to go to the one that's on the top of any foodie list, Arnold's! The hype is real. First, super easy to park, free large lot right in front. Get there early. It gets hopping! We got there around 11 with no wait. The Arnold's team. They all looked so happy to be there. I know it's Nashville and all, but it's real southern hospitality at its finest. So, I hate to be the one with those annoying food restrictions...but I know soul food can hide meat where you least expect it. I asked which sides were vegetarian and they quickly steered me in the right direction. Those candied yams though. Wow. So glad I got a double portion of you sweet things! Also got the mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. Both were great too. Not sure if hubby will also review, but just in case he doesn't (we only have about 30 places to review from Nashville), he absolutely loved the roast beef and got a side of the chicken and dumplings. No veggie sides. Yup 1.5 meats can be done...(and opposites attract I guess). Of course, I didn't have enough southern goodness and also picked up the banana pudding. Get it! Even had a nice little merengue mixed in, of course chock full of bananas and nilla wafers. I miss cafeterias.
