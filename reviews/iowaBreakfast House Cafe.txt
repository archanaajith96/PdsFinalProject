Totally order the American fries instead of the hash browns...they are much better! See the picture of the sausage biscuits with gravy on them as those have American fries on the side. The strawberry stuffed French toast was good. But I didn't care for the eggs Benedict because they poach the egg until the yolk is solid. Probably to avoid salmonella but I like the egg yolk in my poached eggs to be creamy and runny. That's the only thing I wouldn't order again. But the hollandaise was excellent and the ham slice was huge!"}, {"review_id": "ZWkhlN8Uk6YdaPh8Ahsznw", "user_id": "Euhl0ywRm-kiJ3nGl06L0g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/28/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "They changed their hash browns and so I'm dropping my rating.This has been my favorite Saturday morning place for quite a while but now I'm have to try some other spots."}, {"review_id": "SrRZ9MCwqyD8z7CLoNwZBw", "user_id": "IcU2n6r43RD9rbyeULyjGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/9/2017", "text": "Dropped into this place after we hungrily scoured Yelp for somewhere to eat. We were starving, but didn't want to spend a ton and definitely wanted breakfast food. Long story short: we'd go back and try different things, but it's not much different than any other diner. The building is older, but recently remodeled. A sign on the window advertises \"under new management\" and \"free coffee Monday- Wednesday 6-8am\". The inside is clean and modest. Like others have mentioned, there is an open kitchen.  It was busier than I would've expected for a Wednesday morning. Maybe they were understaffed, but the service wasn't great. We weren't well attended throughout the meal despite the place being so small. The food itself was pretty good. It's worth mentioning - there is only one person working the kitchen. My boyfriend got the scrambler meal - 2 chocolate chip pancakes, 4 sausage links, and scrambled eggs. I ordered the cowboy omelette (ham, onion, green pepper, Swiss cheese) with rye toast and fruit. Everything was tasty and the portions were very generous, however I had to stop eating the omelette because it seemed undercooked. I would guess this was because of the melted cheese on top, but still unappealing."}, {"review_id": "K3rE-GArDCcfjCpXTIjd9w", "user_id": "39ob3TUuT8AVi4Y_POIJnQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "7/10/2017", "text": "Oh god where to begin on this place. This is probably in the top 3 worst service experiences I've ever had. We dropped in around 1, so they weren't super busy. Our waitress forgot BOTH our drink orders repeatedly and had to be reminded. After we'd been waiting about half an hour, she popped back up (still waiting on our drinks) to tell us that they had \"run out\" of chicken and so could not make me the chicken and waffles I'd ordered. To make matters more convincing, she asserted (while handing me a menu to pick something else) that she was pretty sure the chicken WAS in the back somewhere. 15 minute later she still hadn't come back to get my reorder, but she apparently mouthed \"we're good\" to my boyfriend from across the restaurant. 15 minutes later our food arrived.The food itself was a mixed bag. My boyfriend's eggs were done perfectly, and my waffles were delicious. The chicken, however, was a super market premade and frozen style chicken tender. My hash browns were badly undercooked, still white almost everywhere (the boyfriend's were nice and brown, so they clearly do know what they SHOULD look like). No apology or anything for the service train wreck, but she was quick to bring our check by the minute we stopped putting food in our mouths. Needless to say, we won't be back."}, {"review_id": "JDzqSOjhjbeRa8zld_9YHA", "user_id": "dImHZAWN0h5DQ48ae8TT9Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/30/2017", "text": "Wait was long, but we were told it was worth it.

I'm from out of town. The place was packed so I thought that was a good sign. Waits don't bother me but they don't have a hostess/host so you just form a line. That could definitely be improved. Once I sat down, the waitress came over. She was very sweet. I ordered coffee and water. I only received the water. I assumed it was brewing. She took my order.Fast forward thirty minutes, no coffee or food yet. She came by and said the food should almost be ready. I asked for coffee again and finally got it.She came back and told me that they lost my ticket.  About 5 minutes later, she said they found it. They ran it as to-go.10 minutes later I got the food. It was cold and bland. The eggs were rock hard. Gravy was freezing cold.Another waiter came by and asked if something was wrong so I told him I couldn't eat it. She came by after, and I also told her. She told me that they took my food FROM the to-go box and plated it. That's why it was cold. Very odd. I didn't pay for anything but the whole experience wasted 2 hours and made my stomach turn."}, {"review_id": "2EKGfQrFduIj21YGk-0Jgg", "user_id": "1jehePZ-ETmIxSO-V1mpJQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/19/2017", "text": "Found this place on Yelp, somewhat close to our hotel, we were in town for a soccer tourney and had 3 starving 15yr old boys who wanted real breakfast food aka protein!! Breakfast House did not disappoint! It's a small establishment and an open grill. You seat yourself. All the wait staff was extremely helpful. It was crazy busy!! We knew that was a good sign. From when we walked in til when we left it was 75min but so worth it. The boys raved about the food and people just kept coming and going there was a constant wait. I have nothing negative to say!!

Sausage gravy with no seasoning, and little sausage. Over toasted sourdough bread. The eggs and hashbrowns were decent.My SO ordered the steak. They crossed off 'tips' on the menu, when it originally stated 'steak tips.' It was like that on all 4 menus at our table. She got steak tips, nice misdirection. She ordered eggs scrambled hard, got eggs over hard. Her toast and water were decent.Moral of the story: maybe get eggs?

The staff is friendly and quick, my coffee cup was never empty which is a huge plus for me. The eggs and hashbrowns were cooked perfectly. This is not a sit down and drink coffee all day, kind of place. It's a place to get good food, quickly and keep moving, but it's worth it.

Hot, fresh and fast with prompt attentive service. I had the Sausage Biscuits Breakfast which was like two huge sausage & egg sandwiches smothered with sausage gravy containing big chunks of sausage. If you like breakfast sausage biscuits & gravy this is the dish for you. Served with hashbrowns, it was more than I could eat.The restaurant was nicely done, clean and well kept.
