I had this place bookmarked for a while. After a spontaneous extended Sunday evening at the casino and rushing back home this place was still open at 10:30 PM. There were 6 other patrons; 4 dining and 2 others going for take out as well. There were still options of meat on the rotisserie. The guy even went in the back to slice up an avocado for me. I really appreciated that simple because....20 mins till closing usually people only have leaving work on their minds. Everyone was polite. This place isn't fancy but it's very spacious. You can bring kids here and have a nice family meal. They have great dessert options and Brazilian(I think) candies if you'd like to try their goodies as well as gum for an after meal fresher. Food was tasty. It hit the spot. I wasn't blown away but I was satisfied with no complaints."}, {"review_id": "dKYyTISWrQmz4dBOfZiyKA", "user_id": "BoFWCatLv9HDXQbNFCSLfQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "I don't know why I haven't reviewed this place earlier. Whenever I'm in the area, I HAVE to go here. The plantains, beans, rice, veggies, all delicious. The meat...oh, yes. They have a choice of chicken, brisket, steak and I think sausage. I normally get the steak, which is always flavorful and normally tender, and with the steak, they give you a choice of having fat or no fat. I've gotten the brisket before, but my pallet is used to brisket done a different way, so I wasnt impressed. But I always walk away full and happy. I've even had my family pick some up for me when they come down to visit - they drive it the 6 hours it takes to get to me. (They put it on ice) It's that good.Why 4 stars and not 5? Because of parking. The parking is crap. They've got a itty-bitty parking lot that is always full (after all the food is delicious) and then you have street parking. This is where you are forced to park in front of people's houses and not block their driveways. The parking situation I'd horrible, but the food is worth the effort."}, {"review_id": "wmZJ0UXp3CbwJLWoW91EVQ", "user_id": "UBLmYc34g7ES6Of5QI8l7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "This is the type of place a lot of people on Yelp live for.......wow!Litterally in the middle of what would be considered a fairly sketchy neighborhood and to back that up, as I was parking, there were police cars with lights flashing and a couple people laying on the ground outside but DO NOT LET ANYTHING STOP YOU FROM COMING HERE.WHY?!!?!?Because this:- Food is cheap- Food is authentic - Food is good (actually more like amazing)- Food is tasty- Food is great- Food is foodAND the service was super friendly and inviting making you feel right at home.But what is so good about this place other than the food?The food of course!Alright getting a little more serious now, sorry I'm just so happy I found this hidden gem.They serve the food buffet style and you pay BY THE POUND so don't forget to stuff your plate with the best of the best.QUICK EXAMPLE: A pound of brisket is the same price as a pound of salad.IF YOU COME HERE AND DO NOT GET ANY GRILLED MEATS THEN YOU SERIOUSLY NEED TO RECONSIDER YOUR THOUGHTS.Yes, the grilled meats they offer such as their Brazilian style brisket, pork, steak, beef ribs, chicken and so much more are all amazing. Even the sausage was good, EVERYTHING was good!I got to try the steak, brisket, sausage and from their non-grilled section I had black beans, rice and oxtail stew.The oxtail, beans and rice were great but the brisket and steak.............my God.For this price? (About $45 for 5 people who stuffed themselves so about $9 or $10 dollars per person)100% worth it, I was stuffed, the food was tasty, my wallet was happy, the staff members were great, the food was of course made with love.THE FOOD WAS MADE WITH LOVE.That statement above should be my entire review.In fact, I'm gonna end it here since you get the point and I'm not telling you more so that you can go there and find out yourself.Thank me later and give this place a try."}, {"review_id": "x2wHReoWNM8X-Q0r2oQqAA", "user_id": "GOEiQzQAqAXTxHh6BDsnVg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "The food here is always great.

You can take to go or dine in. I usually go late night mondays and the food is always consistent. Go for the steak with some fat on it, gives it more flavor. Here I chose a mixture of white and yellow rice with black beans, steak with fat, French fries, and their passion fruit nectar/juice. Great flavor, didn't even use the steak sauce. The plate in the background has bacon covered chicken, potato salad, white rice and pico de gallo.

It's in a bustling neighborhood. They offer a buffet by the pound or all you can eat for $22. The shrimp ceviche on the buffet was so tangy and tasty. I kept going back for more. They also offer table side \"meat delivery\". Fresh cut meat right at the table from the rotisserie. They offered ribs, a bit on the fatty side for me. Steak medium or medium well.. I'm a midrare kind of girl. Pork and chicken which were both tender and juicy. They also have rice, beans, salad, chicken hearts-so tender, fried yuca, and different daily items. They offer my favorite Brazilian soda Guarana, and tons of other choices. Seems to be a real hopping spot after Sunday service."}, {"review_id": "YcC-7bygAlEdUlCcemWBJw", "user_id": "8zTwc96vobu8eCEhMWWj2Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/29/2017", "text": "I've been here a few times. We always seem to end up while we break after work before we have to get back for some lackluster teacher meeting.  The location, for me, is easy to get to and there's always enough parking.

(my favorite)  After the salad bar, is an array of Spanish cuisine.  Rice varities, beans, some stewed chicken or beef. Plantanos or maybe fried potatoes.  I was disappointed last time because there were no chicharrones and those are my jam.The meat selection varies but is always good.  Last time I had some steak and some bacon wrapped chicken.  Both are delicious.Also, the chimi sauce at the salad bar is delicious. The staff is friendly and polite and you don't feel bad about piling on the food or shoveling it into a to-go container.  They weigh it at the register and have a cooler of drinks or specialty juices off to the side.The last time I went, I had enough for two meals and with a water, came to around $11.00.  Not bad at all!"}, {"review_id": "c1K77-eXqEHpgvykM23MBQ", "user_id": "-NzfJpnbp9AVnd9NRCj5SQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Great steak and grilled chicken, some tasty guacamole with onions and tomatoes.

Pantanal seemed to fit the bill perfectly.To be honest, we walked in a little confused as to how this worked. Buffet style cold and hot bar with a slew of fresh BBQd meats to choose from.  I appreciated the fresh fruit next to the salad.The owner, working the bbq, was very welcoming and offered to answer any questions for us. He cleared our confusions, and we immediately started filling our plates.Among the 3 of us combined the weighted total was about 29 bucks, which I'd consider a steal for what we got.  Really enjoyed the bbq sausage (Chorizo), yellow rice, and sweet plantains. The place is simple, no frills, but most importantly clean.  Ample seating. Every worker was friendly. We left full and happy. Took notice that a large amount of the crowd was of Spanish-speaking descent-- that's always a good indiciator of the food's legitimacy.

I opted for the well-done beef with no fat, fried fish, broccoli, chicken hearts, greens, onion, and white rice. Admittedly, i'm not a fan fan of chicken hearts, but never the less, i tried it and basically its an acquired taste...the beef was tasty and somewhat dry, which is understandable, because I requested well done. I also enjoyed the veggies, but the fried fish, unsure of what type, after one bite, was extremely salty and the rice was also salty...Overall, it was a  decent experience."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pantanal-restaurant-bridgeport?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
