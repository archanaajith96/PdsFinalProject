The baked goods are excellent and they offer a lot of variety--I always appreciate a vegan option, and their oatmeal pies and cupcakes are both excellent. I especially love the lemon cupcake. The coffee is great too. I highly recommend getting a lavender latte. Something not offered most places! Also a great choice of teas if you want something caffeine free. Lots of seating and board games too though I haven't made use of them, it's nice that it works for studying, just swinging by to get a snack, or hanging out with a larger group of friends."}, {"review_id": "7IBcT1c-_xoMjhKKk31fMQ", "user_id": "tvlfj7qLgl_GdozEX29xEA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I've never left a review, but I couldn't keep this to myself. I have gone to Crimson & WC on and off for 3 years but recently they have gotten extremely stingy with their prices. I ordered an Iced Coffee and it cost almost $4. Which I thought was a little pricey for iced coffee but didn't mind it too much until she called out my order and it was an actual 4 oz cup. I paid almost $4 for 4 oz and it was just iced coffee. Absolutely awful. I would never pay that much for that little. Iced coffee is usually the cheapest item and this was definitely a rip off. I'm disappointed and would not recommend- there are other places that are reasonably priced for way more coffee."}, {"review_id": "STa6R2Ak2CBIkRZZaVLflQ", "user_id": "-EjteXrl-1RqgpGo9wGqIQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "This is a lovely little coffee shop. A friend and I stumbled upon it walking around the university. It was one of the only places open on a Sunday, so we stopped in. I had a chai tea latte with almond milk and a lemon bar. The lemon bar was SUPER tart and great. Loved it. My friend had a small pot of tea and a crumble bar. She ordered a raspberry bar, but got blueberry :/ womp womp. The atmosphere was relaxing and I love the big open window to watch the baker."}, {"review_id": "NgB9gHy0KLv3NkSSkuyvCQ", "user_id": "y4yN3mHMaEa7vSGlbJwtyw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "Another cozy place in the heart of campus corner. We actually thought it was an ice cream shop. Glad it's not. The white tea and peach is amazing and smells great. The food isn't half bad tho the scone was a little dry. They also make vegan deserts for those who don't eat dairy products. Glad we were finally able to stop in and try this spot. Give it a go of you're in the area. I don't think you'll be upset about It! #Boomer"}, {"review_id": "GvgILl-RlE3LmQCPuHUh8Q", "user_id": "Ut9lUZc-DuO14bEIbNX4-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/27/2017", "text": "Crimson and Whipped Cream is one of my favorite bakeries in town, hands down. The pastries are to die for - I haven't had a single sweet there that wasn't absolutely delicious and on par with anything in OKC. The coffee is also absolutely great. One of my most favorite things about this place is just how great it is for groups. There are lots of board games and table space, so it makes for a fun group outing. Best of all - they even have an adorable branded photo booth!"}, {"review_id": "yPNzwuKrUBPzxMCHmOWmTw", "user_id": "XjjVD-9z-JmUt0yxUYd6Lw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "I stopped in for an afternoon latte and was pleasantly surprised!

They're so good, I had my sister bring them to Texas for me while I was living there.  The coffee is hot and tasty, staff is cherry and friendly and always has good advice on what's good for the day.  All of the baked good are fresh and tasty, and there are always lots of options.  A great place to stay and study or catch up with a friend, or even just to grab and coffee and an afternoon snack.  Love this place!"}, {"review_id": "Co_JZNtZPyVIOKs7ZXoZ-A", "user_id": "DYJmLo4rTABUpVjWvJL7Og", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/22/2017", "text": "If you LOVE baked goods, then Crimson and Whipped Cream is likely to have something for you. Small, large, bread, pastries, frosted, nuts, \"healthy\", they will have you covered. Of the dozen or more items I have tried there over the past couple of years, none have let me down and the hot and cold coffee are not too bad either. The seating is a bit limited, so getting something to go is not a bad option.If you have any kind of a sweet tooth you won't be disappointed or you need to reevaluate the term \"sweet tooth\".

Not all the fancy macchiato, or lattes, or French press. I didn't want it with soy or almond milk and I definitely don't do the skinny. I didn't want any chai latte or froth or foam. I don't care about Splenda or Stevia or agava nectar. I wasn't searching for Kopi Luwak or Molokai coffee. I just wanted a cup of iced vanilla decaf coffee with real cream and sugar, and I wanted a huge cup of it! I'm talking 32 ounces of creamy, sugary, ice cold vanilla flavored delicious coffee. Surprisingly, this proved harder than I thought so I settled for a miniature cup of decaf Americano that contained a tiny drop of cream, a few sprinkles of sugar and enough ice to make a polar bear happy sans any vanilla flavor at all. Four swallows and it was gone. Good thing I like to eat ice.I'm really surprised there are so many coffee shops in Norman that don't have decaf coffee."}, {"review_id": "rBEq0v3djvYe_RW7bBgF-w", "user_id": "U92JuJYY1gH4vGtISHi-_g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/13/2017", "text": "I walked.

The ambiance was also lovely: large windows letting in light, white but not sparse walls, a ceiling with old-timey finishing, crisp and clean tables. It was very welcoming and friendly. Plus? You can mosey on over to Postscript through the adjoined doorway if you have any card, stationery, or paper goods needs while waiting for your coffee.

Cookies were absolutely delicious with perfectly baked chewy texture and large chocolate chips. Lattes were perfectly prepared in nice large thick ceramic tea cups. I'm not a fan of soy milk that is sweetened a lot and it's usually hit or miss when ordering soy lattes as many do but I was pleasantly pleased here as I believe I tasted soy that was not loaded down with processed sugar. The inside of the coffee shop was beautiful with hues of low key color coordinated furnishings and low key music that all led to a very peaceful enjoyable experience. Great service, clean comfortable interior, delicious reasonable priced drinks and food. I'd recommend this establishment to anyone."}, {"review_id": "Ss72QftRC7_ggifKyw81Fw", "user_id": "Ho3C0JeutrtFjxlLorodfQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/23/2017", "text": "I came here to study and it's definitely a cute place to do so. I came in Saturday morning and it wasn't very busy. I can see how it can be a hassle to park (You have to pay meters on weekdays). But since I came during the weekend, the parking around CC was free. I tried the cold brew latte and it was just okay to me, a little too milky. I tried the lemon almond cheesecake coffee cake which goes went well with a regular cup of coffee. I also tried the chocolate chip cookie which was delicious! This is a random, but I think it's unique how there's a sliding door for the bathroom. Friendly place. Their other desserts looked really good and pretty reasonably priced so I'm sure I'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "hJK08G8kSxb-FuENhNIIng", "user_id": "h6UlOSRiEMcDTZT7mSzoSA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/16/2015", "text": "The second I took a sip of the cold brew coffee, my life was changed and I was hooked forever. Five years later and living in OKC, I'm still going back for more. The cold brew is one of a kind and the closest I've ever gotten to a cup that compares is in San Fransisco's Blue Bottle New Orleans style cold brew. Be careful, once you have one cup your life will never be the same. Opt for the large and you'll be wired all day.The cookies are also excellent. They're perfectly sized and perfectly moist (every millennial's favorite word). The chocolate chip is my personal favorite.
