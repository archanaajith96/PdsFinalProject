Big, open and roomy dining and bar and nice outside seating over looking the water.  Staff was friendly, service was good.  I ordered the Irish Root Soup, get the bowl, its fabulous.  One of our party ordered the Irish Chips, thick cut fries that come with one of two sauces.  He chose the sweet curry dipping sauce and I can confirm he chose wisely.  I had one of the best Reuben Sandwiches ever, my wife ordered a very excellent Guinness BBQ sandwich, pulled pork, coleslaw piled on top of mashed potatoes served open faced on a thick slice of toasted brioche.    Ha, she chose wisely too.  I left completely stuffed and we both left with half a sandwich which reheated well for dinner.   Don't visit Green Bay without stopping here for lunch or brunch."}, {"review_id": "p5oW4zeN40dGntgngwXSeg", "user_id": "704FCmH3QryfTyBqZkofQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/24/2017", "text": "My go to place for drinks or bloodies. This is a great place to go with co-workers. They make a mean pot roast and a great stew. If I need a good beer on tap I'll be here. Great for large or small groups of dinner, drinks, or both.

My fiancé and I came in for dinner after it being highly recommended that we did, and we couldn't have been happier! The service was outstanding, the food was absolutely amazing, we started with the mussels(best I've ever had), for our entrees I had the meatloaf he had the chicken cordon bleu special, for dessert (on the house) we had the vanilla bean creme brûlée. We'd drive the 9 hours just to do it again! Thank you so much !!!"}, {"review_id": "qS-7gs9EpDbaJJ6tsPvpdw", "user_id": "WV5XKbgVHJXEgw7f-b6PVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/16/2016", "text": "I have always liked this place. Stopped in for an appetizer the other night and was served a huge plate of mussels. At least 20 plus on the plate and they were great. Served in a cream sauce they were packed with flavor. I appreciate that they gave us two plates with the main giant plate so we could share. In previous visits I have had the steak which is always cooked the way I like it and the Irish stews too. I bit pricey but you pay for quality."}, {"review_id": "JCcGD34tSKSyLMvfUpEYPw", "user_id": "jz7WiRo8zgLDVSWjnwJEkA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2017", "text": "The meals at St Brendan's are great.

Room was a good size with a beautiful bathroom and huge shower. Room was extremely clean and smelled wonderful! I wish they sold their cleaning products. I definitely would have bought some.

The bar has a lot of specialty drinks to choose from and the menu also had quite the selection. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip which was very good. My husband ordered the meatloaf with gravy and baby reds. The meatloaf had a great flavor but it was overcooked and dry. I ordered the Ale Haddock sandwich with fries. I had asked for the cheese and the coleslaw on the side. When I received my meal, the fish was extremely soggy from the coleslaw (that I had asked to be on the side) and I never received my cheese. The fish was tough in spots as well. There weren't many people in the establishment, so these requests shouldn't have been a problem. Will I go back? Probably not."}, {"review_id": "Z-AWREj-n7Pr7HR5iH86dA", "user_id": "oG4T4zWuiGTqahmvLSrJTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/23/2017", "text": "Well, St Brendan's hits the spot! Best Reuben I've tasted in the area ($11.) Copious amount of corned beef in the sandwich. I ordered mine with sweet-potato fries. I enquired, \"Stephen, (our super- bartender/waiter,) can I have them lightly-dusted with cayenne powder?\" No problem! My Sig-Other enjoyed a large portion of braised lamb-shank, (mouth-watering,) served with mashed potatoes and gravy ($18.) I had to have a bite! There are many Irish-fare offerings (shepherd's pie, Irish stew, Guinness pot roast to name three,) many premium beers on tap, (I had a Guinness,) top-shelf Irish-whiskey, scotch and other spirits, albeit, my Sig ordered a glass of Chardonnay. The dark, wood paneling and soft lighting bends one's mood into  laid-back tranquility. Good prices, great food! We'll go back again and again. Erin go bragh! Check St Brendan's Inn out!"}, {"review_id": "n6VKGTdvwozKVwnEfGz8UQ", "user_id": "QE37cXTKckN7CX0duMYnhg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/11/2016", "text": "Dined here a number of times over the years and never a bad experience. Authentic Irish Inn. Have never stayed overnight, only dined. Not a large menu but well-prepared, timely, good portion sized, and delicious. Some typical Irish plates and other entree's with an American flair. Take your time to enjoy your meal. Not a huge but definitely adequate selection of both Domestic and European beers with many specialty drinks unique to Ireland. Have always enjoyed good service. Reasonably priced considering the quality of food, service and ambience. One large dining area which can be loud when busy but beautiful woodwork and stained glass windows."}, {"review_id": "5nR_Pd6HEmWRxyOiUP6Qpg", "user_id": "RgPiBDtMOtw_A4XnCx9uug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/1/2017", "text": "I came here for lunch today and it was excellent. I've been here for dinner before, but lunchtime was just as good. I had the orange roughy (special) and it was delicious.  Later, I told the waitress to send my compliments to the chef.  The dish came with wild rice and steamed broccoli.  My husband had a burger with mashed potatoes and our friends had a burger and a rueben.  They loved the sweet potato fries.  We all shared turtle cheesecake for dessert.  The environment and lighting are really nice here too.  We love the partially stained glass windows. Our waitress was kind, attentive and helpful.  The bathrooms were clean.  For our leftovers, we were given biodegradable containers (instead of awful styrofoam that other restaurants give).  This restaurant is run well and the staff seem proud to work here. Five stars for sure!"}, {"review_id": "STxpvkbYKiiOtkqGvoRw-w", "user_id": "4_Uw2Tt9YRv9y-a5f_XvSA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "11/25/2017", "text": "This was the second time I have been here.
