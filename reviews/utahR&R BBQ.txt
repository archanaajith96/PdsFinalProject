It took about 30 min standing in the line before I could order. The place was bustling, the guys behind the counter hoppin', choppin', running and grinning - workin' their butts off. They had one old guy standing in the kitchen, near the order line, whose sole job was to whack sausage. Bam, bam, bam, bam! He had the knife and everyone was polite. So, I get my basket with sliced brisket and ribs - ugh, it all smelled so darn good. I got my Uinta beer and found a seat on the counter by the window. My mouth watering, I reached for the nearest bbq sauce bottle, squirt a bunch on everything, and dug in. What a glorious treat. Ribs - perfect! Brisket - tender, juicy, perfect!! Smoked Beans with meat chunks - perfect!!! Up until now the best BBQ I ever ate came from the woods of Jasper, TX. I was 21 years old then, and could eat a horse. I'm 40 years older now, but the memories of that great food was equaled today at R&R. Good job guys, and thanks for makin' BBQ DONE RIGHT!"}, {"review_id": "8ivMk1NNH7ygDmf-epdq3A", "user_id": "E3ToIpXyJhoSmY_TB3n2xg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Had the ribs and sausage here.

The \"One Meat\" combo comes with a side and hush puppies for $13.99.  The \"Two Meat\" combo is only $1 more.  The \"Three Meat\" Combo is bargain at $15.99.  I got the brisket, pulled chicken, smoked sausage, hush puppies, and a side of their spicy BBQ baked beans.  Everything was delicious, specifically the sausage, pulled chicken, and BBQ baked beans.  The brisket was a little dry, which I didn't expect because I had a moist and tender brisket the last time I was at their South Jordan location.  The overall meal is weighed and hooked up at R&R BBQ.  They don't skimp on portions and the overall quality of their BBQ is possibly still the best in Salt Lake City, Utah."}, {"review_id": "eQHa2gwEB5EzzAAxEON68Q", "user_id": "HyecqwXeafZ9umTSw5WdOA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "A quick and easy lunch spot when you want barbecue food fast! It's a quick service restaurant where you order your food and fixings while they are basically making it for you as you move along down the aisle to the register. You can order food by the pound or just a sandwich with sides. I hit up the pulled chicken sandwich with all the basic toppings they offer and baked beans on the side. Would definitely recommend both of these especially the pulled chicken. My friend had issues with it because she is not a fan of dark meat but I really doubt you can go to any bbq place and get all white meat. They don't like wasting food! The sandwich was extremely plentiful with the meat, and the beans were nice and thick. Not too watery like I've had at some places. This location is a little cramped especially around where the soda machine and extra utensils are located. But the staff was nice and it looked clean in the restaurant."}, {"review_id": "1ajzbD2V06b92iYhQYX5_g", "user_id": "jEpXcqp4klHO1QSaqCk7vw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "I used to come to R&R regularly when they first opened and for a couple of years afterwards and would take all our friends here. However, I took a hiatus just from happenstance and came back a couple of weeks ago on a Monday night and was so disappointed. I heard someone behind the counter say they were running out meat so that might have been why our plate consisted of a quarter cup of brisket and a quarter cup of pork even though we ordered a solid pound of it. My partner and I usually just split that with some fries. The fries were still crispy and good and our table was well stocked with BBQ sauces. But driving home hungry after paying top dollar for good BBQ convinced us we needn't come back again.In hindsight, we should've just asked them to reweigh the meat and ask them why the portions were so small but the moment has clearly passed."}, {"review_id": "SiSoozE1MGkKItvKxevd_g", "user_id": "z4OaDgJ88joTi038EM59sg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Got the 3 Meat plate...Double Beef Brisket with the Pork Ribs.

That's how I feel about R&R BBQ.Never did I imagine that this place would seem like the ol' original so quickly.

I've been in love with the chopped brisket lately.

I sat near the windows, and there were dozens of flies that were hanging out in that area. I mentioned it to one of the workers who just shrugged.

(This is pulled pork and brisket) Sorry. Ate the ribs already.  The bowl used to be my red beans and rice. I ate that and used the bowl to mix up a custom sauce from their selection of four. I liked the original with a bit of heat. The Carolina is thin but does add some vinegar to your mix.  Make your own mix!The red beans and rice is a way to get to taste their sausage without ordering it as a separate meat.  The sausage was very good in the red beans and rice. The beans and rice are simple not what' a Cajun might expect but doctor it up with some of the sauces and it can be quite good. I like this place!  Give it a try! I will be back!Oh, and they have a nice craft beer menu too! Always a plus in Utah! Which has a great craft brew industry.Only a four star because it is my first visit.

The fried okra was excellent and definitely the highlight of the meal. The okra pieces were pretty small but the batter was salty and fried to perfection.The hush puppies were totally disappointing and had no flavor whatsoever.
