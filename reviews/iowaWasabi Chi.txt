The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere and is kept clean, which made for an excellent experience!We were served fairly quickly and the waitress gave us plenty of extra ginger when we requested it. The sushi itself was delicious. Some might say one roll is small, but I found two rolls to be the perfect amount for me. The prices are pretty reasonable, too! We will definitely return here again when we need our next sushi fix. Probably some of the best sushi I've had in a very long time!"}, {"review_id": "BasfCb3hTJNv1QMzdRCyCA", "user_id": "A0BGiVfqJRWBnjY7eN7y-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Heard it was some of the best sushi in DM, and it didn't disappoint. The rolls were tasty and creative and the service was attentive and quick. Prices were also decent. We ordered enough apps and rolls to fill four bellies, and the total was just under $80.

I had the Green Peace roll without the eel sauce, by far the best roll there! I also enjoyed the sweet potato and veggie roll, both great! The wasabi tasted fresh and not pasty. One mishap was my veggie roll was served with a gnat. They took the whole plate back and took it off the plate. I hope they just didn't take it off and put it on another plate."}, {"review_id": "tgGvio2WYp4CY3qZS3x0FQ", "user_id": "LoYkNtumz8SPpxqgfV3xKA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "I think this place is amazing!

When myself and two others showed up, we tried it and all ordered the same. It was refreshing, and visually appealing. We checked in on Yelp and received a free order of the spicy edamame. My favorite edamame in the city. We also ordered the Brussel sprouts, shrimp ragoons and pork potstickers. Everything was DELICIOUS. I want all appetizers again. For sushi we had the Yaki Sama Roll - not the prettiest to look at but tasted ok, Out of Control Roll - a table favorite, the Marilyn Monroll, another table favorite, and the Sweet Potato and Godzilla rolls. Service was quick and attentive. Recommend to anyone looking for sushi in Des Moines."}, {"review_id": "qUtOSkn1j4nU3McZ6TNu0Q", "user_id": "o-od9fMsys1OzY0j9dKDtw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Awesome sushi, great prices.   A small restaurant so hard to get into spur of the moment  on a Friday & Saturday.  Good drinks too."}, {"review_id": "obDghZBAx5LP2E4KsswKmg", "user_id": "DtytvLBu5M7ma8uzr1Aglg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Wasabi Chi is our go-to for fresh, creative sushi and amazing service. If you go, I recommend trying the beef negamaki appetizer: green onions, rolled up in steak, grilled to perfection, then drizzled with teriyaki sauce and served over a bed of caramelized onions. All of my dining partners have raved about the seafood platters, which are show-stoppingly artistic and delicious. The parking lot is small and the restaurant stays busy, so going at slightly off hours will get you easier parking and faster service.

Nice and quite experience each time. I've always had really good food. Lots of rolls are always very good and this last time I shared a plate of pad thai that was also highly recommended if you are into that kind of thing. It worked out good to each get 1 sushi roll and share the plate of pad thai. I have really started to love Wasabi Chi more and more each visit. I would recommend this to any one looking for a new place to try or to come back and try more!"}, {"review_id": "RRWZCmcchg8Psclbl7CYNg", "user_id": "QWkMoZSt0dVUBXLoTSdPHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/26/2017", "text": "If you like sushi, you HAVE to give Wasabi Chi a try. We came in on a Friday night, and each ordered their 3 course dinner. We got to try their dumplings, a smoked salmon appetizer, chef's choice sushi, the NYC roll, creme brulee, and mango sticky rice.The appetizers were both great, but our favorite was the smoked salmon. It was stuffed with crab (I think) and had this great sauce underneath. The NYC roll was fabulous, and so was the sushi. The shrimp roll on our sushi platter was probably the best piece of sushi either of us have EVER had. There was so much flavor, and it kept developing as we chewed. A++++The creme brulee was good, but was a let down considering how amazing the rest of the meal was. The mango sticky rice was a good end to the meal.We are already debating coming back again for dinner tonight. If we could, we would eat here every single day."}, {"review_id": "yHjKLJMopfmQUQbBbEj08Q", "user_id": "jl7o7b2OyiJ8foeX_ai4tg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "There may be a sushi place or two in town that can compete with Wasabi Chi but I haven't had better.

The jalapeño yellowtail appetizer is fresh, complex, and flavorful without neutralizing the flavor of the fish. The freshness of any sashimi can be gauged by the uni.  Well, it was remarkable. The texture and creamy flavor indicated it was not last week's urchin. The remainder of the sashimi was super fresh and presented beautifully.  The rolls ordered by other members in my party looked delicious and were huge. The spider roll was a bargain and HUGE. My mother, a connoisseur of soft shell crab, said it was outstanding. Finally, there was no sticker shock when the bill rolled in... very reasonably priced considering the superb quality and outstanding service.  Nice work!"}, {"review_id": "3bqohz70Qg7F4fF1fJDfwg", "user_id": "4wKuzrI7mnJc0DEF2KIj2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/9/2017", "text": "This has to be one (if not the one) of the best sushi bars in town. When we decided to introduce the grandkids to sushi, this was the logical choice. The Kani salad is great with spicy crab for an appetizer. Not to mention free edamame when you check in. The rolls had various names (which grandpa can't remember), but they were all delicious. Highly recommend the place. Five stars all the way.

I really enjoy how cozy the atmosphere is here. This one of my favorite sushi places. I live on this side town so they are convenient. They have pick up which has worked out really well for me in the past. This visit was a dinner visit and we had a 4 top. The diner lunch was picking up but we got right in and seated right away. The waitress was very attentive and made sure that we all got what we needed. Bonus if you check in on yelp they currently have a free app of edamame. NOM! We tried the spicy this time and it was really good. Not as spicy as we were thinking it was going to be. Had my usual soup and we all shared sushi rolls. Really that is the best way when dinning with friends. Rolls to share so you can all try something new. The sushi is priced really well for what you are getting. We were all really happy with our rolls. We had a really good visit this time. They do have non sushi meals for those who choose, but really if you are just starting out on sushi, get a cooked one. They are so full of flavor it makes me do my happy food dance in my seat each time I eat here."}, {"review_id": "SS45i5yxQlwL3Hx_eRy0oA", "user_id": "JhfEL3efJOL_wI9tl2Mc9A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Best sushi in Des Moines.  Or at least top 3.
