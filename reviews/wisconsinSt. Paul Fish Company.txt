Patrick took care of us at the bar and was very outgoing and friendly and quick with the drinks!We saw a couple across the bar from us order lobster rolls that looks UNREAL delicious and decided we had to split one ourselves. We placed the order with Patrick who recommended the calamari steak appetizer to us as well. We said we'd start with the sandwich and think about it. Next thing you know a calamari steak is rolling out to us (we were so hungry we decided to just eat it instead of making an issue about how we didn't actually order it). It had the potential to be delicious (and I'm definitely going to give it a second chance) but unfortunately it wasn't warm when it got to us. However the lobster roll was so good!! It took some time to get made (however the place was packed at 5pm on a Sunday) and I really appreciated that they split it in the kitchen and plates the two halves separately! We each got a generous serving of fries and a cup of coleslaw (both which were average). Overall a great time and I'll definitely be back, maybe at a less crowded time!"}, {"review_id": "Wd0R42BYzz2Beww5toy2zg", "user_id": "wKVDdhoQOBkG1cnLYmUPeg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Being one of the most packed places in the Public Market. Scratch that: one of the most packed places in the Third Ward. We had to finally try it out.We love scallops and lobster and fish and shrimp and basically everything seafood. More importantly, we had to go on Thursday for 1/2 off blue point oysters. After waiting probably an hour for a table (seriously so busy) we got seated. Everyone was super nice but definitely rushed. Oysters were delicious and we also ordered the lobster dinner with fries and cole slaw to share. Really really good.Only complaint would be because of how busy they were, our server forgot our drinks, forgot how many oysters we ordered, and forgot to bring us extra plates. He was very nice but seemed too busy to pay full attention to any table.Looking forward to going back and trying other things!"}, {"review_id": "PdGVgQQhySMdt_xRW_KipQ", "user_id": "-KAjEfH_pMGPHDhBOIx2FA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "So happy I found this place on Yelp! A coworker and I had just drove the 3 hrs from Steven's Point to Milwaukee and wanted GOOD food. St.Paul's hit every spot. When we first walked in, we were fascinated that this place is apart of a large market. There was wine spot, ice cream spot, cheese section, everything! None of the other food spots grabbed our attention like the fish company. Our wait time was about 30 minutes, this place was pretty busy for a Wed evening. My coworker and I ended up ordering the same thing (boring), which was the salmon meal w/ sautéed vegetables, rice and a butter sauce. I ordered my salmon blackened and he chose the regular grilled. Omg, everything had such great flavor! Halfway through the salmon, I was so full, but I just had to finish my meal (fatty) lol. I really enjoyed my food and it was only $14.95! They have great deals on seafood entrees, lobster dinners, crab dinners, etc. In my photo attached, my food looks pretty basic but don't judge a book by its cover! If I'm ever in Milwaukee, I'm headed to this place!"}, {"review_id": "Ds0pF2zPNv8MT60QdxHlAw", "user_id": "XruSaC6Yj188idiio5N2Ww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "I came to Wisconsin for travel and was only in town (near airport) for 3 days 3 nights. I had one meal to spare before my flight home and decided based on yelp reviews to try the St. Paul Fish Company for dinner. The open air market atmosphere was quite nice! very cool spot to visit , and i wish i had more days to explore some of the other food items offered there. But cutting to the chase, I had lobster roll and calamari. The calamari was VERY good. The thought of 'this is the best calamari appetizer i've ever had' crossed my mind. The style of calamari is not the 'onion ring' breaded style, which was great because you can focus more on the flavor of the calamari rather than a mouth full of breading. The added sauces they provided went well with it, and I wish I would have known to request for more! The lobster roll was very reasonably priced and was a great value / taste for the price (i think it was around 13$?).  You can easily spend 20-25$ at other companies who sell lobster rolls or food trucks, but for the price, I was amazed at the taste and quality from St. Pauls.  Never did I say to myself 'yea this wasn't worth the price'.   With these two items already in my stomach, i did not get to finish the accompanying fries and i'll say the fries were 'ordinary'. Nothing mind blowing about it, but i'm glad i filled myself first on the calamari.  The service was friendly there. I took my order to go so I didn't dine in, but it look like a friendly place."}, {"review_id": "pZr9mD62R_jzxD8vgun4_A", "user_id": "qNgmvqt7zuLt1g9o-TFSdg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/4/2017", "text": "Baby Friendly 4 starsKid Friendly 4 starsWe had a great lunch here yesterday.  I wanted to try this place, because it has so many great reviews.  I wasn't disappointed.We started with a salmon on a stick.  We planned to get one of these to go instead of one as an appetizer, but we were really hungry.  It was really good.I had the grouper based on the recommendation of the server.  It was good.My husband had the grilled salmon sandwich based off of Yelp reviews.  It was fantastic!!!  I think this is our new favorite sandwich anywhere.  I highly recommend this.  It's also a great deal, it was half the price of my entree.I'm calling this baby friendly because the market is baby friendly and there is a changing station in the bathroom upstairs.  They also put as at a 4 top table so we could have the stroller next to the table.I'm calling this kid friendly because there are all kinds of good tasting fried options, and other foods that can be eaten with your hands!  What kid doesn't like eating with their hands?"}, {"review_id": "4Ausyrd1Rk1bhBFaHnlmZA", "user_id": "TMicvRQkQwtd8FfhUdicqA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Excellent sea food and atmosphere.

I used to be a huge fan of their Lobster Dinner, which is a great deal and an old favorite of ours, but I've come to love their lobster roll! The lobster roll is pretty much an entire lobster's worth of meat served smothered in a delicious slaw sauce and stuffed in a huge slice of buttery Texas toast. They also have an impressive beer selection as well and have regularly seen local beers as well as Ballast Point on tap and in cans; one of my favorites.Tips:-This is also a great place for date nights since the food is delicious, lively atmosphere, and a unique experience. -Make sure to show up early since this place fills up fast and the wait can get pretty long pretty quick. I'm not sure of they take reservations but no worries since you can easily spend a lot of time wandering through the market. -You can also grab a can of beer from them while you're waiting for your table. -Park in the Public Market's parking lot and get a discount on your parking if you validate your card. This is much more convenient and ends up being very inexpensive.-Check our their website for their daily specials. They offer some pretty good deals."}, {"review_id": "5xr8mdk2bsADw_8cHnYx1Q", "user_id": "XXQujYqgH5hXo7uYu8_1hw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/19/2018", "text": "Seriously, this place is awesome! Located in a shared warehouse space the restaurant is towards the back area and validates parking (win!). We walked past several great looking options, but I had my heart set on fried clams. The restaurant itself isn't that large, but there is extra seating at a bar area near the fresh seafood counter. We were lucky enough to snag a table next to the fresh lobster tank. Our server came over pretty quickly (he was very cool) and took our drink and food order. We ordered the fried clams, fries, and a small cup of seafood chowder. Within 10 minutes everything came out FRESH and hot!The clams were amazing, larger due to them being Diggers possibly? And were not too overly seasoned. We tried them with the remoulade sauce and tartar (very good). The fries were crispy and very very good as was the chowder.Grand total for this seafood spot? Less than $15 including tax. This will definitely be on our list for out next trip out to Wisconsin.

I have not tried it recently and it might well be as good as in the past. Their fresh lobster served in the restaurant, also, is quote good. Probably 5 stars. Over all, their dine in food is quite good. The reason I am giving them 1 star is for the quality of Chilean Seabass that I got yesterday and Salmon I had gotten in the past. Also, the people are not too friendly.. they get very defensive, when I ask - can you show me which fish came in today or last night.. They don't like to answer that question.. instead, you will be given a lecture about how they supply to restaurant and that it is not important when the fish came and it was more important that fish is stored properly! They lied to me yesterday, about Chilean seabass being delivered prior day.. Btw, for storage, All I see is them putting fish on ice.. not the best - they don't seem to have a proper display cooler sytem - as do Sendiks, Whole foods etc. I am more interested in knowing how many days that cut of fish was sitting on ice.. they are not telling me the truth or they are giving me lectures instead about how good they are! That's why 1 star! Yesterday, I bought Canadian lobster tails, Crab claws and Chilean seabass for home cooking.I have not yet tried the lobster tails. I have tried their Chilean Seabass and it was NOT good! Comparision - just prior day, I got chilean seabass from Sendiks (who told me that they simply thaw out frozen seabass because fish from Chile comes frozen). St paul people said that they get fresh seabass and frankly, it was far inferior to the thawed seabass from Sendiks! I had cooked both in identical method - Next, the Crab Claws - they were strawy and stringy.. some of the worst I have tasted - meaning - they are probably very old or what ever.. Both, I cooked, using Sous Vide technique.. Same as I did for the Sendiks' seabass. Sendik's fish was excellent.. but not the same from St Paul's"}, {"review_id": "cuW68SQOy7MYZxANlH9zgA", "user_id": "zqU42JFEzVhIx_lVMmI70A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Couldn't resist the lobster roll while walking through the market.

This place is fairly pocket friendly while giving you a top dollar experience. They also have a fish monger that will advise you on what they have that will fit your dinning desires so that you can take a little something home to enjoy there too.

It offered a generous quantity of luscious, fresh crab salad on a \"just like New England\" soft roll. The cod didn't seem as fresh, my dining mate felt there was an \"off\" aftertaste. The coleslaw was standard, not too exciting.We also each tried a soft-shell crab for $5.99 each. It was lovely, perhaps the meatiest soft-shell crab I've ever had! Overall, loved my visit here.
