I have heard great thing and I wasn't disappointed. I started with the Braised Short Ribs Gnocchi app. The Gnocchi were excellent and the shredded Short Rib had great flavor. For the entree I had the Roasted Monk Fish, I think it is a RW special, with Lobster and saffron broth, Mussels roasted potatoes and cauliflower. The entire plate was great. The Fish was flakey and flavorful, the broth (more of a sauce) was great and as a non-fan if cauliflower, I was blown away by the Roasted Cauliflower (maybe I'm a fan now). My wife got the Pot Roast (regular menu item). The Roast was outstanding and he accompanying vegetables (carrots, turnips and onions) were great. The Parsnip and Potato mash was at another level. There was a great sweetness at the end of each bite. Our server said the chef is very liberal with the butter (great idea) so I can only assume it was a sweet cream butter. The dessert was on point. The flourless Chocolate Cake was delicious and the addition of the raspberry gelato was a nice surprise. My wife's Lemon Pudding Cake with Coconut gelato hit the spot."}, {"review_id": "LzK8vzkw8WM-SxasSM14rQ", "user_id": "X7AVL_5WMOb_wy9s3QBd6g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "What a sweet surprise !Ambience: 5/5Thoughtfully done, tasteful fluorescents, huge windows, great view Location: 5/5Super walkable from our hotel, near brown and RISD Food: 4/5 Food was not super tasteful but unique so -1point.

It was good but not great. I didn't get the classic paella feel - wasn't a lot of rice, wasn't really baked into the bowl and pretty watery overall.

That was probably the most amazing stuffed lobster I have ever had! Amazing presentation, fantastic flavor, and great selection of sides...chili glazed cauliflower and grilled broccolini. Excellent customer service and wonderful authentic atmosphere. You are going to pay for it but it is definitely worth a special visit for anniversary, birthday, or lobster fix!

Their specialty - seafood - is great. Shrimp cocktail was very fresh and tender. Where they lost a star from me is other kinds of food - I got a grilled vegetable panini. It was what it said it would be - grilled veggies with goat cheese, but it was missing an element to tie all the ingredients together. Thus, all in all, a nice place for a business meeting or a date, located in a beautiful area near a park and the river; good for what it's know for - seafood. But I'd so much appreciate some yummy vegetarian/vegan options."}, {"review_id": "HUVSGIHNyXIxITyc6DyHQA", "user_id": "U7RCnO4Y_SbuKLsFvwTIww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "This 4 star rating is solely based off how much I LOVED the lobster mac and cheese. It was sooooo yummy, with huge pieces of lobster, served in the actual lobster shell. Not coming cheap, this cost roughly $40, but every bite was so delicious that it was totally worth it. We also had fish tacos, after the lobster mac and cheese. They were good and generous portion but nothing to brag about.The real star of the show here is the lobster mac & cheese.

It seems to be a restaurant that many parents would bring their colleges to when visiting (several colleges namely RISD and Brown University are very close to this restaurant). I was extremely impressed by their seafood selection. The special they offered when I was there was a lobster already broken down with the meat stuff back in the lobster along with mix of other seafood. It was extremely delicious and memorable. Also, you were able to break open the lobster even more with the remaining meat they did not crack out.Hemenway's is rather pricey, and I would only ever go here if with my family and visiting Providence again. Out of all the places I dined in my New England, this was the most notable, and I would recommend it to anyone else visiting Providence."}, {"review_id": "Kwk25PIbLSS-KkfvjfgZpA", "user_id": "EHFeppvwTT2SPwfUiGaEZw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "Real good seafood in a very nice upscale setting. The cold dishes were good especially the oysters. The clam chowder was flavorful with plenty of clams. The crab cakes were good but a hair lacking in the crust. The shrimp was a bit over seasoned. The zucchini chips were excellent, but the salt and vinegar homemade potato chips unexpectedly stole the show for the sides.

Bring your pocketbook, this place isn't cheap, but you get what you pay for. The service is top notch, the restaurant is sprawling and not cramped. There is a paid parking garage next door and street parking. I do not know about valet.Everything from appetizers to desserts (we had desserts!) was wonderful.  Grilled octopus was very hearty and with no fishy taste at all. My husband's lobster bisque was creamy and wonderful. The key lime pie was very tall and the crust was a graham cracker crust, almost like a thick, solid cookie. It was very good.Our server was fabulous! Excellent date night location, or just go get some rocking seafood.

I always look forward to my visits because the space is beautiful and open, the staff welcoming, the food and drink superb.  Tonight, I was seated in the side front area, with views out to the adjacent park through the huge windows.  The Christmas decorations were festive.Homemade warm soft rolls and sweet butter arrived immediately upon being seated.  I began with a large bottle of Pellegrino ($6) and a classic cocktail, the Old Fashioned ($12).  With dinner, I drank a delicious dry French Sancerre G-Pascal Jolivet ($14).  My waitress Kira is a charming and attractive young lady.  It always amazes me that women in their 20s can be so poised, professional and well-spoken, yet friendly and down-to-earth.  Her polite attentiveness made my dinner even more special.I dearly love oysters and I stopped by the shucking station in the front of the restaurant on my way in to see what was available today.  I began with three briny fresh Barnstable, Cape Cod oysters ($1.75 each), the largest of the day.  I also had three good-size Cherrystones from RI ($1.75 each). Hemenway's always serves oysters and clams with two sauces: mignonette as well as the classic red cocktail sauce.  Next, another classic, the Wedge Salad ($8) with delicious blue cheese dressing & crumbled egg. Simple, fresh and well-prepared.  I choose the Grilled Octopus Special ($34), served with sliced Andouille sausage, Brussels sprouts, small roasted potatoes and crispy small chunks of sunchokes in a beet vinaigrette. The octopus was grilled and slightly charred, but tender and delicious.  All the other ingredients were roasted or grilled to perfection. I have had octopus and squid prepared many ways.  I have never had this combination nor would I have ever imagined it.  Executive Chef Max Peterson's choice of ingredients was inspired!!  This dish was superb and deeply satisfying. I always get excited when I have an excellent dinner.  So, let's keep going!   I opted for the Lemon Pudding Cake ($9), a small 3-inch round dessert, garnished with sliced strawberries, orange zest, candied pistachios and a Grand Marnier tuile (I had to look it up. Tuile is a small French wafer-cookie.)  Accompanied by a pot of French-press decaf coffee ($5.50).  My total bill was $110.97 before tip.  Final notes on service and quality of the Hemenway's staff.The managers and the chef here are actively engaged with their customers.  During every single visit, one or even two of the managers has always stopped by every table and asked: \"How is everything?\"  As I was early, I observed one of the managers checking every glass on the empty tables for water spots.  I have seen the chef come through the dining room at least one time during every visit.  This is attention to detail.One of Hemenway's best attributes is that every waiter/waitress serves every table.  You will never hear \"This is not my table\" at Hemenway's.   I was seated in the front section and all the wait staff in that area had to pass my table to access their discreet computer ordering station.  Every time one of them passed by, they glanced at my table.  I was asked or helped by six different wait staff and servers during my one and one-half hour dinner.  This is extraordinary service.Finally, I have observed that Hemenway's staff have never addressed their customers as \"you guys,\" a term which always grates on me, as both men and women these days are often called \"guys.\"  So, the servers here are not just polite and professional.  They are educated, well-spoken and yet accessible and down-to-earth. Hemenway's offers the perfect complete dining experience: a beautiful space, warm and inviting. Professional and friendly staff.  Superb food and drink.  And fair prices.  I always leave here feeling blissful and contented."}, {"review_id": "K9IQ7SNkybn0sqxKgrYq7w", "user_id": "M95qnKrCt07Ihnp0KOM3vw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "First off: pop dat rose bottttttle.
