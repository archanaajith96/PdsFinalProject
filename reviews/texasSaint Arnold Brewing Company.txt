The beer is great, they have a great variety of beers and the staff is always so friendly and helpful in helping you pick out the beer that best suits your taste.2. It's a kid friendly environment, you can have a beer without the people around you scolding and judging your parenting skills.3. The food is good and the prices are cheap.4. You can also bring outside food, which is always a plus.Definitely recommend for you to stop by if you're in the area !"}, {"review_id": "w_EaLRH_tVOD2gkvzA3wwA", "user_id": "OaaVDpKPFfXsuz9TzOB5lA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Came here for a tour on a Friday afternoon. The guide was funny and engaging but the tour seemed a bit short. Maybe it was because it was a Friday and they had no production work going on. The beer was definitely good though. We enjoyed each on we tried. The food was tasty as well and they were happy to accommodate my wife's dietary restriction. We were very impressed and appreciative. A nice thing they did was once you opened a tab you could use it for the bar, gift shop or restaurant. It was really convenient."}, {"review_id": "uMHUzr2KcSRmASDcAfn0gg", "user_id": "KYO3_9ShHmdoJlWHt5td8A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Huge Texas size craft brewery and tasting room. Atmosphere is super casual and this brewery has that spot on not too fancy style. Living in H-town for a long time, drank a lot of Saint As and was already familiar with all their standard brews like Art Car IPA, Elissa, Lawnmower and Santo.  Like em all.  First visit to the brewery.  Enjoyed trying Icon, special IPA.  Really nice.Parking is easy.  Staff is friendly.  Beer is good.  Didn't try the food but the dogs looked good.  Only negative was lines.  They had another bar and if opened would have made lines reasonable.   Long lines for tasting is not a good look."}, {"review_id": "Mj4sV_tPdW0rsPxHuyCW-g", "user_id": "ze5gfLQhZc6G_ZxT0kFNxw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "First time touring St. Arnold's Brewery... the artwork is amazing throughout the building and in the beer hall. I did not like how their coin or token system was set up. You were limited by ounces and variety more than the normal set of rules at breweries so I decided to just start a tab. They do however, have a Happy birthday pint glass and Free beer token if you go on your birthday. *Be prepared to present them with your ID to prove you aren't just trying to get a freebie.Beer selection was great, a couple of my suggestions include: lawnmower (kolsch) and the Cryo IPA."}, {"review_id": "nGsXpT13zEGPrg5K_2IqiQ", "user_id": "P3wxZaI8n4aGWqRHNx6K_w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "come here for various art shows.

The parking is across the train tracks as there is a whole lotta construction for their future restaurant. The hall itself is full of wooden benches and tables which allow people to eat, drink, and be merry. At Saint Arnold's, you're allowed to bring your own food if you want and not obliged to purchase from their kitchen, though the menu looks enticing. At the bar, you can grab your your tokens for drinks, some one and some two per drink. I've had the pleasure of having the chocolate milk stout, the weedwacker, the pub crawl pale ale, and art car ipa. I'm a big fan of both light hoppy beers and beers with hints of chocolate or coffee. The chocolate milk stout was wonderfully brewed and easily my favorite. I was hoping to see more sours and more local collaborations with businesses that Saint Arnold's could brew up, maybe in the future? I also attended their free tour, which starts upstairs and then down although the space is quite small and the guide was difficult to hear clearly due to noise levels. It was definitely not as interesting or engaging as other brewery tours I've been to and I was expecting more, even if they have to charge a small price for it. The restrooms were well maintained. The photo booth and murals on their walls were good photo ops. Would return to try out more beers and maybe food, but skip the tour."}, {"review_id": "YOqi-FfzBTbFEpgW-V6Zdw", "user_id": "kafwhwn4sBOr8FkqlyNkUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/14/2017", "text": "The Yelp Texas Tour was gracious enough to invite me to one of the tours events at the St. Arnold Brewing Company.Another outstanding tour as far as I am concerned. Had the opportunity to taste three of the beers. Fell in love with Santo beer. Very tasty, nice hoppy flavor. The Chocolate Milk beer was very reminiscent of Guinness Stout. Nice undertones of sweetness and chocolate.Their flag ship beer Amber Ale was just not my cup of tea. I also tried their house root beer. Sweet taste of sassafras. Had lunch too. The crawfish roll. Kind of like a lobster roll but with crawfish. Meh, just ok. Nothing to write home about. With tasty fries including tax $14.07.Was a great day visiting with other Yelpers.Enjoyed the conversations as much as anything.They had a tour of the facility which I did not go on as my cane and flights of stairs are not compatible."}, {"review_id": "7Dr_cAcET9i9NNd11xIfWw", "user_id": "1btE8njNXjtyUA0WyY2Avw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/4/2017", "text": "I came here with a big group as part of an organized tour, and everything about the experience was wonderful. Our tour was running a little behind, so we all grabbed a beer and sat down in the enormous German-style beer hall to enjoy our drinks. I tried the Christmas Ale, which was good, and the Chocolate Stout, which was great. As we prepared for our tour, our guide insisted that no tour was complete without a full glass of beer, so the bartenders topped off our glasses free of charge and we set off on the tour with beers in hand. The tour itself isn't too long, but I loved getting to see the huge kegs and learn more about Saint Arnold & brewing in general. All in all, whether you're coming to take a tour or simply to hang out and enjoy a few beers, Saint Arnold is a really awesome place to spend an afternoon. Also the perfect place to bring out-of-town visitors for a fun experience and to get a taste of Houston beer!"}, {"review_id": "fKA8UcfPsAnadg7kIQ8_Gg", "user_id": "QSIoCtJ1emofP1My3BfmHA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Hubs and I were in H-town visiting family and were recommended to visit this place for our love for craft brews.

I had the daily special ($23+tax) today which included beer/ale until 2:00pm Along with a two course meal.  I highly suggest this choice. Today's daily special included some good Israeli Couscous (despite whatever they choose to call it) along with a good chicken and vegetable curry over rice. I even stuck around after lunch for an enjoyable brewery tour (the tours only take around 20 minuets and they are free). I forgot to mention the free photo booth.  I am extremely happy with my visit to Saint Arnold's Brewery and look forward with anticipation to my next visit here. If you work in downtown Houston and are having a slow day at the office with nothing important going on in the afternoon then this would be an absolutely great place to come visit.  No need to pull your car out of the parking lot.  Saint Arnold's is close so grab a Taxi or an Uber and enjoy yourself."}, {"review_id": "zN4LiT_argncBsk6rZo-dg", "user_id": "WhgZtJF4maYx-F1-UVRHnw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "So unique! Walking inside your a bit sketched out, at least I was. This place is an old church but looks like a big warehouse inside. Once up top the venue is open and nothing crazy. There are long areas of seating and at the end... dah dah dah... THE BAR! Haha We enjoyed a few solo drinks to start and then I paid for the drink tokens and a souvenir glass. This was pretty sweet cause I got to try a few different drinks and, from what I remember, started to feel it pretty quick. While drinking we ordered a pretzel with cheese from the food place next to the bar. It was pretty great and paired well with the drinks. We enjoyed the photo booth they had too. It was fancy and you could send the pics right to your phone from it. It was a in feature to remember our visit there and to the city. They offer free tours of the plant and our guide was hilarious. Besides the fact you get to enjoy a walk around the brewery and see / hear how it's made you also get to enough a your brew the entire way. We had several laughing moments during the tour.

We ordered some pretzels with cheese which was really good.  My husband had the burger with jalapeño cheese fries. The bun on the burger was really good, made locally by Slow Dough. I had the bratwurst on a pretzel bun and plain fries. We're not big drinkers so we had the all you can drink free root beer.The tour was only 25-30 mins but informative.  He explained the brew process and showed us the fermenting warehouse (no open toed shoes in the warehouse). Wish we could have seen the bottling warehouse though. The place is super casual. The tour guide even had a beer during the tour.

We didn't eat because we brought food in for the party, but I do want to return to try some of the items. Families were bringing children, brought their own chairs and table and just hanging out.  Love the hours on Saturday of 11a 3p especially if children are present. Monday to Thursday. Friday 11a to 10p.  Closed Sunday.The root beer is delicious, by the way, but they don't do diet so I just tasted hubs.  The real deal is made with cane sugar.  Love the photo booth, as well.  What a wonderful venue.  I want to bring the kids when they visit and we have let others know who don't live in Houston city proper.    Super venue.  I can only imagine having this place to decorate as a home.  Not the brewery part, the main building.  Just a phenomenal old building with so much character."}, {"review_id": "Rr5sAwQgvFWBTsjPrNEVUg", "user_id": "-IxgIdBBL4ah3JNSrAV4nw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/21/2017", "text": "Seasonal beer - Icon Red Märzen Nice open seating area with long tables...you can buy glasses with tokens or just order drinks at the bar.

The event itself was fun but that's in another review. Here I'll talk about the place itself. This place is located just east of downtown, and parking is pretty easy to find. Walking in you'll notice signs pointing to the beer hall so at least that helped me since I got lost the first time. You're not obligated to eat only food from the place, so feel free to bring the food you want. I got a truffle fries the first time, and at the bar you can trade in your tokens for some beer. I have had the pleasure of trying the chocolate milk stout, which has creamy, deep rich inner tones of chocolate and a nice dark flavor, cut and bread pudding, which had a touch of cinnamon and vanilla and was lighter and sweeter tasting, and he amber ale which is my favorite of the three, with I think caramel hints? The truffle fries were  a little lacking in flavor, though so was a little disappointed in those but I'm still willing to try other items on the menu. They have great places for photo ops too, and I took at least one. The tour itself...was not as engaging or exciting as I hoped and I wish they had given some samples. I mean it's a tour of a beer factory (??) right? I'd come to chill with friends and have some food and drinks here but I'd pass on the tour. P.S. They have a gift shop too for some memorabilia too!"}, {"review_id": "ZK1CdmVcUeTdrwPtNBNfCg", "user_id": "b9AWdZKry6pAHcMyErr2dw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/17/2017", "text": "Biased because it was first brewery tour back in the day.

Plenty of seating to go around and obviously fantastic for large groups. This was definitely the busiest and largest of the breweries we visited while in Texas. The free Photo Booth was fun and a nice touch. Saint Arnold definitely had my favorite beers of the breweries I visited too - especially their seasonal winter beers, the White Noise and the Chocolate Milk Stout (don't knock it til you try it). Also a solid food menu too. The artwork on the wall is really cool and gives the whole place a church-y vibe. It's worth noting that they do offer tours but they also close early so plan accordingly."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/saint-arnold-brewing-company-houston?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
