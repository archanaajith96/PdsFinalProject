Happy hour venue?  Pretty good!  Bar? Pretty good!  Restaurant? Meh. Comedy club?  Fun place!  Party venue? Yea pretty good!  So yea, it fits in several categories, and does some of them well...but not all.  I guess that's a 3... The venue itself is pretty huge, and you can get tables for pretty big parties, whether it's the big table in the bar, the huge tables way upstairs, or the large reservable area in the back with pool tables and what not.  There's also a cozy comedy club in the lower level.  For regular sized groups, there are plenty of other tables in the bar area, and a really fun layout in the restaurant seating.  (Check out some of the pictures).  The food?  Eh. I'd say hit or miss, but to be honest it seems to be mostly miss.  Average bar food.  If you're looking for mostly bar snacks, appetizers and drinks, maybe it's OK.  Personally I'd steer clear of the main menu until they get things better figured out (been waiting on that for a long time though).  My last meal there was a burger, because I figured that was safe.  It was big and pink (on the red side, really), but just tasted kind of funky.  Didn't end up finishing it.  The little lady's chicken wrap was the opposite...dry.  The bar area?  Pretty solid.  It gets loud, but there's a good number of TV's, and they have a fun selection of their own beer to explore.The staff?  Overall I've had pretty solid experiences on that end.  Last guy was very flustered by the size of our group (which they were not really prepared for, despite the reservation well in advance), but I've had pretty good experiences elsewhere. Will I be back?  Maybe for drinks or happy hour, but not for dinner."}, {"review_id": "lkfVvlDHj1OrSzfALAxMxA", "user_id": "YWB5HV5VFWXz4TOYBMmiEg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "In downtown Hartford is the 3 story City Steam. On this particular day we were greeted and seated right away. That is pretty much where our take of speed and efficiency ends. The waiter who was also the bartender took our order for drinks and more than 10 minutes later brought our drinks and took our food order. I had the quesadilla burger and it was delicious. The beef was fresh and cooked very well. I also had a salad that was fresh and well tossed. I had no complaint with the food but the  service was painfully slow.  There were few tables in the restaurant and they were either understaffed or they need a different service method.  Our food took forever like almost an hour  forever. The kitchen is on the third floor maybe that has something to do with it. The server was nice he just wasn't very attentive or quick about anything. For example a friend and I split the salad and the burger and I asked for an extra plate when we ordered. Not only did he not bring a plate but he \"went\" to go get one and we were all done eating prior to his return. The food is good but I wouldn't go back. Two and a half hours for lunch is a little excessive even on vacation."}, {"review_id": "AwVlx4PGv26xZZZMApSbdQ", "user_id": "cVrM2BvOvPV0Vi_rC8kepQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "A professional organization I belong to had a wonderful time at our group dinner in City Steam's Pool Room.It was a fun private room with, yes a pool table, plus two 'Pop A Shot' basketball games that delivered a lot of entertainment for a few quarters.Our buffet dinner started off with some very tasty chicken quesadillas before the main course was served- green salad, green beans with cherry tomatoes, sliced turkey with apple stuffing and gravy, roast potatoes, and salmon. The food was excellent, the servers were super polite and pleasant, and our bartender was great.We had six beers on tap at our bar - Colt 46 (a light lager), Naughty Nurse Amber Ale, Naughty Nurse IPA, Blonde on Blonde (Pale Ale), Export (a German Lager), and my choice -Norwegian Wood (a spiced dark lager). I was pretty darned happy with Norwegian Wood- it was delicious. In fact, as Lennon and McCartney wrote - isn't it good, Norwegian Wood?

After having bad experiences here over the years and swearing off the place, I was convinced to give it another try by some friends who wanted to meet for dinner. We got a table up on the top floor near a window (freezing) and ordered some appetizers and drinks from a waiter wearing a ski hat. There was nobody sitting near us, so we asked if we could move to the next table over which was larger and not near the drafty window. The ski hat waiter said \"sure\" and we moved - about five feet away (this part is important). So there we sat for who knows how long before our drinks came and our dinner order was placed. And we waited for our appetizers. And waited. And waited. And then, lo and behold, here comes our dinner. We hadn't seen ski hat waiter in awhile so we were never able to ask where our apps were - so when dinner arrived, we asked the woman who delivered it where our apps went. She seemed annoyed and went to check on them and then came back and said because we moved tables the appetizers couldn't get delivered. ????? First, we moved ONE table over in an otherwise empty section of the restaurant. Second, we NEVER saw anyone come up to the area with any appetizers - in fact, we never saw anyone, including ski hat waiter, until our dinners were delivered. The snippy woman seemed upset that we had the nerve to ask about our food and said she could bring it out if we still wanted it. We said no, since we had our meals, it didn't make sense to have appetizers now. The food was just okay - I had the flank steak and it was tough and not seasoned at all. We didn't see ski hat waiter for a long time, even though he was helping a group near us who had arrived toward the end of our meal. Overall, not much seems to have change at City Steam, which is a shame because it's a cool building and would be a great place to hang out in downtown Hartford."}, {"review_id": "BzrL-jbxxTRQOZkMlzF8OA", "user_id": "Au29vfQvZ659KguGGT6cMw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Decent spot for happy hour and drinks. But the food has been going downhill for a while. Recently hit rock bottom with the worst fish and chips I've ever had--Mushy, soggy, floppy, and overall depressing since it was the entree I used to rely on. I don't find any of the bar bites worth it except for the Mac and Cheese. Nachos are hit or miss--sometimes you get the perfect spread of meat, other times you have to go treasure hunting. My favorite app is probably the pretzel sticks, usually warm and buttery.Still have to give it 3 stars for the friendly vibes, good service, and well-priced beers."}, {"review_id": "hVz62Ljp3-TZQ9jr9U_khQ", "user_id": "mymPIHev5TzyuZW4D4dWGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "This review is for the bar staff, manager and jungle IPA.
