You are sure to be satisfied by the delicious appetizers, yummy pizza and great customer service! Our waitress Laura took the time to explain the menu, help us find the best beer that paired with our pizza and even went above and beyond making recommendations for pizza and local favorites! They make the  Mozzarella there daily and it's really cool to see the chiefs prepare the pizza.It was a great experience and I would gladly recommend this place to anyone looking for a yummy pizza in Tulsa! Just be sure to bring your appetite and friends to share all the delicious food!"}, {"review_id": "7VvkM62qNtiZnUNkhV7pSA", "user_id": "MpZbUUXYLMkIiynAvu7kRw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "What follows is a review that reflects my poor experience at Andolini's this evening. However, I changed my rating because I really appreciated the owner contacting me crazy quickly and apologizing and explaining what steps he took to make sure that doesn't happen again. That goes a long way, and I appreciated it. Sat there a little over ten minutes and our drink order wasn't even taken. The restaurant was not busy, all other tables already had their orders. We thought perhaps they were short staffed...until a couple was sat at the table immediately next to us and a waiter hopped right over and cheerfully took their drink order after we had been waiting ten minutes, no waiter to be seen. We got up and walked out, although I wish I had stopped and spoken to the manager, just so they could be made aware. This was an unfortunate experience given it had taken me a long time to convince my husband to try Andolini's again."}, {"review_id": "eYowZ8wJYPZDMEfM63uTRA", "user_id": "bne4hBh1s4nAgoUczniVVg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Great atmosphere?

The pizza was delicious on each occasion and the service was top notch. They have an outdoor seating area that is nice during the evening if it isn't too hot out. Inside the ambience is casual with a cozy feel. Their pizza selection is vast and offers something for everyone. Our party also got the garlic knots, which I highly recommend to anyone craving some extra carbs in their life (so you should get them)! They also have a great beer menu! Overall, I enjoyed my time at Andolini's and would definitely return if I am ever in the area again."}, {"review_id": "7c45foaJ3GvwhwelPZXy3w", "user_id": "qmuJYskpQf-FwOMwBriu5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/29/2017", "text": "So this is Wonderful Pizza. We started with an Appetizer of Fried Mozzarella! Mozzarella is made in house. Delicious We then ordered the Andolini's Combination Pizza. Pepperoni, Salami, Italian Sausage, Beef, onions, green peppers and we left the mushrooms off. It was amazing. The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable. You can watch the pizza being made from the dining room.  We travel to Tulsa just to eat here."}, {"review_id": "RLQscj8jqvcIqiOR_z3fGw", "user_id": "YZ7pRLc1rYsBVoEfJvUMAQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "This is my favorite pizza place I have ever been to! The pizza and service here is always phenomenal, I've been here multiple times and the quality of the food and service is always a 10/10. The pizza here is so good that you can either dine in or order it to go and it will taste amazing either way!My family of 4 always orders 2 large vegetarian pizzas because 3/4 of us are vegetarian, or occasionally we'll get 1 large vegetarian and 1 large Demarco of Brooklyn. The Demarco of Brooklyn is a bit pricey for a pizza, but it's huge and truly the best margherita similar pizza I've ever had! The vegetarian pizza here is so so good, I've moved away now and I can't find any place with vegetarian pizza as good as this. We've tried nearly every pizza on the menu, and two of my other favorites are the Vesuvio and the Andolini's Combination.I've visited the newer Jenks riverside Andolini's, and the pizza there is good but not nearly as good as this one on Cherry St. This one also has way better service than the one in Jenks.Overall, Andolini's has by far the best pizza in Tulsa, and I will for sure come back the next time I visit. Anyone who hasn't tried Andolini's is seriously missing out!"}, {"review_id": "OO3aqC994oiLyEpKTtOfeg", "user_id": "GGCYVl-YRF84-FKHJ9I5NQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Thus was our first trip to tulsa and wanted to try a pizzs place as a last minute choice but were certainly glad we did. We were seated immediately and within a few minutes the appetizer (garlic knots) and our drinks were out. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was being charged for marinara nd ranch but didn't deduct any stars as it was probably written do where in the menu.  Fast friendly service with generous portions. Great atmosphere with a good amount of lighting. Our waitress introduced me to my new favorite beer, kronenbourg 1664 blanc! The pizza was also quite good with a lot of whatever topping one would choose.

The food here is just knock your socks off amazing. Of course Andolini's is known for having delicious pizza but they have several other dishes than are fantastic too like salads, garlic knots, and the chicken Fettuccini Alfredo is the best in town!The by the slice starts at 10pm on the nights they are open later. One night a week they show a movie up on a projector which is fun for friends, family, or a date. You can also watch them make the pizza through the glass at the front which is a fun thing to do regardless of your age, and it adds to the fresh/local vibe.In addition to fabulous food and great ambiance, the drink menu here offers a vast array of libations sure to quench your thirst no matter what your mood. There is a good bear and wine selection, but what's really to brag on is their cocktails menu."}, {"review_id": "x2IERP_9Lx12IlU9vWbLYA", "user_id": "mvC01wnuUxkk8OWVcxYoDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "This visit was the result of owner Mike Bausch reaching out to me due to a poor review I posted on Yelp of an experience two weeks ago at the Jenks Riverwalk location. I give Mike big props for making contact to get details and the make-up visit offer was very generous. This review is an honest opinion of the make-up visit as I would write it no matter the circumstances.There was no fumble on this visit on the part of any member of management or staff. The greeter automatically connected us with a floor manager who was totally aware of why we were there and everything was top notch for the entire experience, from the greeting to packing up leftovers to take home. Mary Beth, the FOH Manager, was in contact with us throughout the meal to ensure a great experience. I did notice she was also very hands-on throughout the house, not just our table.We started off with the garlic knot appetizer with both the marinara and the alfredo sauces for a maximum flavor experience. This is definitely the best selection for a first-timer. Drinks were the usual pinot grigio for the wife and a craft beer for me - Dead Armadillo Amber. This brew will definitely get your attention but it really stands up to strong flavors in the usual pizza. Highly recommended!!Our pizza for this evening was a custom combo of ground beef, speck (smoked prosciutto - gotta have it to appreciate it), Kalamata olives, & red onion strings. These strong flavors are why the craft beer paired so well with it.We wrapped up the evening with the Italian butter cake for dessert shared between the two of us. Very rich and a lot was boxed to come home for later enjoyment."}, {"review_id": "qDTq7IaUTvzrSBjceN23XA", "user_id": "I_6or9vQiL9qoSz5PuW4fg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/8/2017", "text": "Well to be fair the actual pizzeria is not yet open, apparently they are Renovating and decided to keep their patio open and serve slices from their food truck. This is all cool except the menu was pretty tiny and for dealing with so few customers the service was slow. They couldn't serve cups of water, but the waitress didn't inform us of this, or that ordering water meant a $2 bottle. We each ordered a Caesar salad which was made with what looked like those yellow bottom parts of all the romain stalks they had left. I asked for tomatoes on mine and it came with three sad little cherry tomatoes. All served in plastic containers. The pizza I must say was very good and giant slices, but for $5 a slice it should at least come out hot, and also with napkins. I will probably pay them a visit in the future when they are done renovating, but  for now, I'm not a fan of the over priced pizza truck patio they have as a replacement."}, {"review_id": "1AAR2ZVlN7gjdJO5Ir0WNw", "user_id": "gGqeRx6lyIhOcMPSMJ8_TQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "Finally made it in to try and definitely will be back. We had great service and everything was hot and tasty. We started with the garlic knots which were super delicious however could've used some more garlic. We ordered the TENBYSIMMO pie which was really good. Crust is crunchy yet soft and foldable, tons of toppings. If I was to complain about anything I thought the sauce was a little too sweet.

Was slightly worried when my boyfriend ordered a small pizza for us to share because he's a big football playing dude, but the pizza came out and my concerns were gone. It was HUGE!!! We decided on half vegetarian (but added Canadian bacon lol) and half BBQ chicken. The vegetarian was great, but the BBQ chicken is a MUST if you come. They pile thin fried onion straws on the bbq chicken that made it so unique. Great crust, great chicken, great sauce! (And I'm a sauce gal so that says a lot). Ended up only having room for two slices each, and taking half a pizza to go. Worth the prices- amazing quality and wonderful service.

The area is great and has plenty of options for places to eat and hang out. A pizza place is a must! The options were unique and very yummy looking and the portions were rather large, which could be good or bad depending on what you're in the mood for. The atmosphere of Andolini's is vibrant and the staff was friendly and accommodating all across the board. This was my first time in Tulsa and I must say that everybody was very friendly. We ordered two pizzas. The first was the wild mushroom and it was delicious and very shareable. On the second we had them do half and half of two different pizzas which some places won't do but they did here and that was very nice. My brother had the mac and cheese and my father had something with a lot of meat. They both enjoyed and we had plenty of left overs!"}, {"review_id": "FvjmRjjBHyqpoh28SUID1A", "user_id": "wgEOOpaIxNTWc82PGp1qaQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "We love the Demarco of Brooklyn.
