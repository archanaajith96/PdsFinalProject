Comprende? Use your hands, do not fear the mess that will be on your face, and just go for it - own your moment. I ordered the Deli Egg on a plain bagel, a mix of Deli meats and cheeses in an omelette style served on a bagel. I really enjoyed it! My girlfriend ordered the Lox and Cream Cheese Bagel, on what bread I can't tell you as she inhaled it so fast. It was gone within seconds.. That good!The coffee we had was special of the day, the autumn breeze - which tasted amazing! Caramel, hazelnut and a hint of pumpkin spice blend. Yum! I also picked up a carrot cake cookie, which wasn't what I expected. It was more like a cake than a cookie; soft, moist and delicious regardless.The guys n gals behind the counter were friendly, quick on serving and had the whole \"we're busy but we got this\" down. The queue was out the door the day I visited! Restrooms were clean, restaurant tables were wiped down, the condiment section fully stocked up.I'll leave you with a 'dad' joke.

Having been to many businesses in the same area in Norfolk, it's a pretty high-power food area. So, I was hoping the bagels would really live up to their hype. Alas, my search for a decent bagel somewhere in Hampton Roads is still afoot. They did not live up to the hype at all. It probably depends on what you think a \"good bagel\" is - the style here is very much the old-school east coast boiled, dense as crap bread style. Much more Maine than NY basically. I ordered a salt bagel toasted with cream cheese and it pretty much tasted like a brick, then settled like a brick in my stomach. If I hadn't been starving, I probably wouldn't have finished it. To top it off, this place is crowded - and not necessarily with the nicest clientele. We witnessed almost two all out fist fights while waiting in line for my subpar bagel. When a pregnant woman and a four year old are clearly waiting for a table, maybe the four 20-something hipsters could not push us out of the way to claim a table? Manners. Geez. Overall, not impressed. I probably won't be back. It did look like they had a lot of vegetarian and vegan options if that's something you are looking for -- just can't vouch for the quality of any of them given my experience."}, {"review_id": "l5wrX27k6qZLw_2h1BX1cw", "user_id": "9z5usckSb_uB_CEsk9L9Cg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Great, low key spot with tons of inexpensive vegan options.

I neglected to try it for so long, perhaps because it seemed to lack the sex appeal of some of the more trendier restaurants in the area. Shame on me.It is located at the intersection of Colonial Avenue and 22nd Street, at the end of a strip mall which also houses the New Belmont House of Smoke and a Muy Thai studio. Parking is limited in the front, but additional parking is available in the rear and along 22nd Street.A new owner, Greg Peterman, who was also a general manager at the No Frill Grill, bought Yorgo's a decade ago and reopened it in January of 2006.  He has successfully steered it to the quality and popularity it enjoys today.Moving counter-clockwise as you enter, there is a display of various flavored coffees and mugs on the right, a rack of tee shirts, a case of specialty beverages, and a self-serve soda machine.  The display counter up front offers a wide assortment of delicasies, including homemade cookies, breads, cream cheeses, and juices. Their bagels are hand crafted fresh daily with 100% organic flour and available in at least a dozen flavors. In the opinion of one local food writer, Yorgo's serves the \"best bagels south of Philadelpia.\"  In additon, they serve a variiety of wraps, burritos, sandwiches, soups, salads, and vegan dishes, all of which can be customized to your wishes. Their menu is a masterpiece of variety and economy, with each indvidual item priced at less than $10.After placing your order at the counter, you are given a receipt with a number and take a seat.  When your number is called, you go up to retrieve your order. Sometimes they bring it right to your table. So far I have sampled the following:THE PETERMAN:  Named after the owner, this is a vegan dish and is described as a tofu scrambler with hash browns, house made sausage, diaya cheese, and red onion in your choice of wrap. Their choice of wraps includes whole wheat, sun dried tomato, jalapeno, and spinach.  I chose the spinach, which was very satisfying and eye catching.  This was my first time tasting vegan style scambled eggs, sausage, and cheese. I was pleasantly surprised at the tastes and textures they delivered. The tofu scramble was a bit bland for my tastes, but a bottle of Texas Pete on my table came in handy for giving it a little more kick. My Rating:  4 Stars.VEGAN BUFFALO CHICK'N:  Gardein brand chicken strips, lettuce, tomato, onion, herb vegenaise, and buffalo sauce.  This can be ordered served in a bagel, wrap, or house made challah roll.  I chose the jalapeno cheddar wrap.I had never heard of Gardein before and looked it up. Their web site describes it as a \"sustainable protein brand that delivers the same great taste, texture, and nutrition of meat with no cholesterol, less fat and calories.\"The similarity in the taste and texture of the chicken strips to real chicken was remarkable.  I enjoyed the remaining ingredients, and the buffalo sauce in combination with the jalapeno cheddar wrap delivered a mildly spicy taste that exhuded with warmth. This is my favorite of the two vegan dishes I have tried here so far.  My Rating:  5 Stars.LOX AND CREAM CHEESE ON A BAGEL:  Served with capers, red onion, and tomato \"for a real taste of New York\" as it says on their menu.  I chose the jalapeno flavored bagel and the jalapeno cream cheese. The bagel was quite large with a texture that shouted with freshness as it sang to my taste buds with the heat of jalapeno. The cream cheese did likewise and was proportioned just right without being overpowering. The lox was divine. Indeed, the flavors of the tomato, red onion, and capers came together nicely for that \"taste of New York.\" My Rating: 5 Stars.THE SO CAL: Smoked turkey, bacon, Muenster, tomato, sprouts, and avocado.  This item is listed as one of their Signature Sandwiches, and I chose the jalapeno cheddar wrap for this one. The flavors and textures came through well, and the crunch of the bacon was an enjoyable highlight. My only wish is that I would have preferred a stronger presence of avocado. My Rating:  4.5 Stars.THE GRINDER:  Ham, capicola, salami, pepper jack, lettuce, tomato, onion, and pepper relish.This is another one of their Signature Sandwiches, and I chose the sun dried tomato wrap for this one. Overall, I would rate this one as my personal favorite  It was profoundly delicious, rich with the flavors and textures of its ingredients.  I'll let the photo do the rest of the talking, as I'm running short on space. My Rating:  5 Stars.The counter service I have experienced here has always been warm and friendly. This quiet and unassuming little restaurant puts out a quality and well conceived product.  Based upon my visits so far, I am pleased to give them a well earned 5-star rating."}, {"review_id": "l2XpSppZqEAWYh6xcV2CDw", "user_id": "mqW8bOWaf4flutPewjagzw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "*My rating is 2.5/5, but since that's not possible on Yelp I'm giving them 3/5*I'm visiting Norfolk from out of town and when I looked up \"vegan food\", Yorgo's came up. I was excited because the Yelp reviews are good, the vegan menu is pretty extensive, and my friend I'm staying with recommended it.I bought a breakfast burrito and carrot cake cookie sandwich to eat there, and 1/2 pound containers of cream cheese, chick'n salad, and egg salad, everything vegan. Burrito (2/5): Decently sized and good filling to tortilla ratio. However, it was overly salty and didn't have depth in either flavor or texture, making it boring and flat. I like to have variation, like the crunch of fresh vegetables, creaminess of hummus, tang of lemon or lime, etc., but the burrito had none of that. Carrot cake cookie sandwich (4/5): Pretty good. It tasted like a normal carrot cake, but nothing exceptional. There wasn't enough frosting in the sandwich, but with the cream cheese I bought it was good.Cream cheese (3.5/5): The texture was like regular cream cheese, but the taste, although accurate, was faint. The tanginess of real cream cheese wasn't strong enough. I overheard one of the managers telling someone that it was just Tofutti cream cheese that they bought in large tubs and then portioned out, which is very disappointing. Egg salad and chick'n salad (2/5): Taste was overwhelmingly like mayonnaise. The textures were a little off, with the chick'n salad being a little rubbery and the egg salad being like a cross between tofu chunks and ground beef. My largest complaint is that they make it seem like the spreads and salads are made in house because they're sold in clear plastic containers. After hearing that the vegan cream cheese is just Tofutti, I'm questioning how much is actually housemade by the restaurant. If you look at the vegan menu, many of the meat substitutes aren't house made, but rather from companies like Tofurkey, Daiya, and Gardein. To some this might not be a big deal, but the difference between making something from scratch vs. from a large company is that the food from scratch is usually made with simple ingredients, while the food from a large company is more likely to be processed. This is especially true for vegan food. For example, homemade vegan cream cheese can be made from tofu, cashews, or coconut yogurt. Here's Tofutti's cream cheese ingredient list:water, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, isolated soy protein, maltodextrin, tofu, nondairy lactic acid, sugar, locust bean, guar and carageenan gums, salt, vegetable mono and diglycerides, potassium sorbate (added as a preservative).Look, I'm not going to put all the blame on the restaurant. I could've asked where the spreads came from, but I just assumed they'd be from scratch. I do think that they should make it clearer if they're just reselling items that they bought in bulk. If I wanted to buy Tofutti cream cheese, I could've just bought it at the store, and cheaper to boot."}, {"review_id": "Es3OzIvFZTzT5TSSqn0yIA", "user_id": "lipjyEgy4XdboNuGRdOFKA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2017", "text": "Great options for multiple palates for lunch and breakfast and even coffees, lattes, cappuccinos, and unusal sodas ( like pomegranite, blueberry lemondae) and fresh juices like beet and orange juice.
