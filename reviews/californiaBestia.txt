We only ordered five items on the menu, but the names are too complicated for me to remember. What I DO remember as REALLY good are the Cavatelli pasta and the lamb belly.The lamb belly just melted in my mouth, it was so savory! The grapefruit was a great addition to the flavor.The Cavatelli pasta was probably one of the best pasta we ever had! All the flavors balance each other out so perfectly, I'd definitely order this one again - maybe even two next time. If you come here, this is a MUST.I also recall the veal tartare from the antipasta menu. This was quite delicious for me, it had a somewhat gamey taste. Very strong flavor I'd say. If you haven't had veal before I'd order this one.The Agnolotti (lamb ragu) wasn't as good as the rest of the dishes, but it was enough to satisfy the taste buds. If you're not too into heavy lamb and cheese flavoring though, I'd forego this dish and order something else.Last but not least we ordered coffee + donas. If you want the table setting to be slightly more romantic, this is a nice dessert to finish the dinner up for two. It was a delicacy and isn't too sweet or too much.Bestia is impressive to say the least! We'd totally come again. Maybe for the dry-aged $130 steak :P."}, {"review_id": "dDxxcdEF0vbLGTemaFRvQA", "user_id": "YkN5jUU6KYENBhCIlZpsSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "What can I say? Even after 3 years, Bestia is still the best-ia (cringe, sorry). My last time eating here was 3 years ago which left a memorable enough mark on me that I had vowed to come back here one day. Fast forward, my boyfriend and I finally made that happen! We were able to make a reservation for a Tuesday night only a week in advance, but that was most likely because it was for a weekday. Weekends here are pretty booked so be sure to call way, way ahead if you can (they take reservations up to 2 months in advance)! Parking in the restaurant lot is valet only for $8 + tip, but you can also just snag a spot on the street (however, it may be a little risky because of potential theft according to other reviews so beware). My memories of my first time here were foggy so I was worried that it wouldn't be as great as I thought I remembered it to be - but nope, it was definitely still delicious! The staff and service were fantastic of course - our waitress was very communicative about planning our meal accordingly so that each dish's unique flavor would follow the previous' harmoniously.We ordered 4 dishes to split between the two of us plus dessert and drinks. We got 3 antipasti: Charred Broccoli di Cicco ($15), Salumi (price varies), and of course, the famed Roasted Marrow Bone ($19). We also got the Cavatelli alla Norcina ($29) for pasta, a Crème Fraîche Panna Cotta ($9) for dessert, and an Old Fashioned and The Disappearing Act for drinks. Literally everything we ordered tasted amazing with my favorites (aside from the bone marrow) being the broccoli (which is actually broccolini) because of its salty and sour sauce and the cavatelli for the delicious black truffles. This was seriously a decadent meal and it was definitely worth it, especially for a special occasion not only for the food, but also because of its very intimate yet cool ambience."}, {"review_id": "eZpiHBh4OBJ_BILYDlLO9w", "user_id": "Sd357RRT7uLQ3v52aQaLqw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "This is a very hip sort of place. It's dark inside with hipster table selections. We were a large group, and we were seated along a long irregularly shaped wooden slab table. The cocktail list is not extensive, so it's fun to choose from, but the wine list is quite extensive, and if you don't already know what you want, it's good to know your server can make excellent suggestions as well as describe what you are thinking of getting. Overall, the appetizers are agreeable, but not terrible special. They taste good and are very solid, but what I found particularly special were the pastas. It tasted like they made the pasta fresh that day, and every combination was excellent. The lamb neck was also quite good. My friend asked for a knife, and the server even scoffed at the request -- it wasn't necessary -- the meat was so soft! Make your reservations far in advance -- if you wait too long, only the later times are available. A lot of menu items run out later in the evening! We got the last lamb neck of the night -- we ordered it at 7:45. They did not run out of their \"coffee and donuts\" dessert, but they did tell us we could not pre order it, despite a label warning it could be ten minutes before it came out, because it often runs out, and they don't want to promise people that they can have it, just in case."}, {"review_id": "SKi_QwYlCPdr1kZdgLlGTw", "user_id": "4gbukolWWt_fjuJ0rd9SNw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "I had a conference in LA and had heard amazing things about Bestia (including from my sister who lives in LA). I have tried to eat here over the years, but they never have reservations before 10 pm. So, when I found out about my conference, I marked my calendar over 2 months in advance to make reservations. Therefore, my 4 stars is based on the fact that my expectations were held so high. Don't get me wrong. Food was really good... just not sure if it was worth the wait for the reservation. Here are my thoughts by item:Veal tartare crostino: so creamy and the flavors were amazing. Rendered us speechless. This is a must have.Salumi- they make their charcuterie in house and it is fantastic. I would have ordered two boards if I didnt have more items to try Mussels and clams: some of the best broth I have ever had. The 'nduja sausage really enhances the flavor and spice level (it is hot)Kohlrabi and cucumber: simple salad. Added some freshness to the meal but really wasn't memorableMargherita pizza: good pizza. Nothing to differentiate it from other good wood or coal fired pizzasCavatelli alla Norcina: this should be on your \"must order\" list as it was fantastic. The black truffles really enhanced the flavor Spaghetti Rustichella: description says Dungeness crab, calabrian chili, and thai basil. Sounds phenomenal right? Unfortunately, on the bland side. Slow roasted lamb neck: so tender and the lamb was cooked just right. Prime ribeye: my other favorite dish of the night. Not only was it perfectly cooked to medium rare, but the apple balsamic and brown butter really elevated the flavor profile. I would only recommend getting this if you have a large party or if you're not planning on ordering much else. This steak is huge!!Dessert is also delicious. I loved their riff on donuts and coffee.Also of note, this place is extremely pricey (worth it though). Even white wines run $25/glass.If you are in LA and are able to get a rezzie easily, definitely check this place out!"}, {"review_id": "D-_YdkD8fFH2jNMBCAtnvg", "user_id": "cPcStFGBlk-6lWWsttIfVQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "4.5.Turned away on our last LA trip, so we were definitely determined this time to not let this trip stop us.

Burrata & Snap Peas - Burrata was surprisingly light yet stiff. The snap peas had a crisp, light flavor. Roasted Marrow Bone - Was not as rich as what the waiter told us. The texture of the gnocchi was fabulous.Lamb Neck - Humongous! Way too much for 2 people to share. The meat was super rich, oiled to the right amount, and fell off the bone with the slightest touch of the fork.

I could've eaten 5 of them just myself!The pasta dishes were good, but for the price, they were not worth it. The cavatelli had a delicious truffle flavor and was cooked well, but it was so small for what it was. The spaghetti rustichella had a unique flavor profile which we liked, but again, was too small to truly be enjoyed. The creamsicle torte was unfortunately pretty disappointing.

The bone marrow dish that's famous here came out tasting like pepperoni pizza. I didn't want to mention it at first because I had two guests who were visiting Bestia for the first time and I had hyped up the bone marrow so much. After a few chews my friend said, \"Do you know what this bone marrow tastes like? Pepperoni pizza.\" Then no one really wanted to eat it anymore.We ordered a few more items, most of which were unmemorable by the time of this writing (it's now May). The chicken liver pate was probably still the best thing we had with the rest being meh. The service and wait staff were great.

Owned by two of Israel's most forward thinkers, everything from the interior to the music seems to be hand-picked for a purpose, much like the ingredients used in their menu. The Cavatelli, hands down, is the best pasta dish I've ever had. It was like watching a movie you just don't want to end because it incorporated drama, comedy, romance, and even sci-fi. This cavatelli had everything I could ever ask for. Al dente to perfection. Bestia does truffle right. Not overpowering, but nuanced in a way that puts all other truffle applications to shame. The servers make some taste recommendations such as finishing the bone marrow before moving on to the mussels & clams, but I would recommend saving the cavatelli for your last few bites. The broccolini had such an accomplished fish sauce flavor that trumps Chicago's Girl & the Goat's fish sauce green beans. I thoroughly enjoyed dipping the blackened bread in the spicy sausage sauce of the mussel & clams, more so than eating the mussels and clams themselves.The Spaghetti rustichella was a definite second to the cavatelli, but I wish we had been served the dish before the cavatelli so I could appreciate it on its own. The dungeoness was tender so the dish is fit for any seafood lover. As for the bone marrow, in terms of flavor, the ratio of marrow to pasta was so off - I'm not even sure I was able to taste any. This dish provides the least bang for your buck, as one small bone is provided, making it my least favorite dish of the five we sampled.Your mileage will probably vary in terms of experience with Bestia, so try to do all you can to make sure you focus on your food. If you can't make a reservation 60 days in advance, be comfortable enough with bar seating, which took an hour wait for our group of 4. Stumptown is conveniently located around the corner so enjoy a nitro cold brew while you're at it. The service is great, as their bartenders knew every detail about their dishes to give actual recommendations rather than suggesting their most popular dishes. I give the cavatelli 5 stars on its own."}, {"review_id": "fZslgFQAvB1QLBTNGeaGwg", "user_id": "bNjAsdsi3gjSzK30r-j-ng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Bestia is the best!

My bf and I got the popular cavatelli alla norcina and the mussels and clams dish. Cavatelli alla norcina - ricotta dumplings, housemade pork sausage, black truffles, grana Padano (tastes like Parmesan cheese). I was skeptical, how good can a tiny pasta dish at $30 taste? The answer is.....AMAZING. Holy crap. The savory sauce and bits of truffle coated each perfectly chewy dumpling. The sausage was full of spices and juicy. It was love at first bite. Truly truly have to try this. Mussels and clams - housemade spicy sausage, fennel seed, preserved blood orange, grilled bread. At around $20, you get a heaping bowl of mussels and clams in a spicy, savory, lick the plate clean sauce, accompanied by slices of grilled bread to mop it all up. Highly recommend this dish too, that sauce was out of this world. Really great starter. We wanted to try the bone marrow, but they were out. The ambiance here is pretty fun and lively, they were playing hip hop music and it has an industrial-ish vibe. Steep prices with a casual atmosphere. Service was great, they were constantly refilling our waters and attentive.

Yes, they are salty and meaty, and all the good things, but to me, they aren't the main attraction. I loved this plate because of the toasted/grilled bread with amazingly delicious pork fat and date paste on top, making a killer combo of salty sweet goodness. (3) Genevieve's Little Gems [3.5/5] - Very refreshing salad with excellent ingredients, but also nothing particularly special. Still, really enjoyed it. (4) Roasted Marrow Bone [5/5] - Just the act of scraping the marrow and tossing it with the spinach gnocchetti was pure bliss. Then you try it, and oh my god, it's a religious experience. (5) Margherita Pizza [4/5] - A classic done well. (6) Cavatelli alla Norcina [4/5] - Definitely a fan favorite, and it was very very good, but I have to say, I didn't understand the hype as much. Like I'm team truffle and it was rich and yummy, but it wasn't my most favorite thing on the menu. (7) Agnolotti alla Vaccinara [5.5/5] - I LICKED THAT BOWL CLEAN. No shame. (8) Cucumber Melon Salad [5.5/5] - This was a seasonal item on the menu last summer, and my god was it good. I was so impressed that I wrote down all the ingredients and sent the recipe to my mother via email exclaiming, \"CAN WE PLEASE RECREATE THIS SALAD!?\" It was just the absolute perfect combination of flavors. **ADVICE: Do not go here for the desserts.

I've been a handful of times for special occasions, and every time the food continues to impress me. The seasoning on the dishes, the flavor found in each bite, always leaves me extremely content when leaving.I almost always start the meal off with the bone marrow appetizer. The roasted bone marrow is extremely rich, and the spinach gnocchetti goes incredibly well in this pairing. It's crispy and creamy.Pizzas:Burrata: Their burrata pizza is one of my favorites - the dough is super chewy and the burrata complemented by the olives and chilies gives the dish a burst of flavor with each bite.Salami Calabrese: This is a bit more balanced of a pizza, also great in flavor. I personally prefer the burrata (but I am definitely biased, I love burrata!)Meat dishes:Slow roasted lamb neck: I'm not generally a big eater of lamb, but this lamb neck is very well seasoned and very lightly game-y. The meat is super tender and juicy with a crispy exterior from the roast. The lamb neck is also huge - between the two of us when I ate it, we could only finish about half of it.Grilled whole branzino: The branzino is solid, but I wasn't particularly impressed by it overall. Flavors are not as heavy as the other dishes I've had.Grilled Dry Aged Ribeye Steak: The ribeye steak was also solid, but did not leave as lasting of an impression as the lamb neck. The meat was well cooked at a perfect medium / medium-rare, and quite tender. The flavors were decent, but I wasn't overly impressed by how the dish was done. Portion size is solid though.Overall, I am excited for my next chance to eat at Bestia. Their appetizers and pizzas are incredible and at reasonable prices. The meat dishes are pricier but portions tend to be quite sufficient to fill you up. I still have to return to try out more of the appetizers and some of the pastas!
