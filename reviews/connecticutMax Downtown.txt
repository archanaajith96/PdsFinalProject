Despite a some food misses on my previous visit, I'm happy to report this time was much better. I really think Max Downtown is one of the best restaurants in CT (and the best Max restaurant in the group!)We came for dinner and sat in the dining room this time. While I am still not a crazy big fan of the new decor (sorry!) I have to say it's growing on me. Service was fabulous as usual. Everyone is so friendly and nice every time I'm here. The Iberico ham, Caesar salad and gnocchi were delicious. The gnocchi were pillowy and light. For entrees we both got steak. My filet was tender and perfectly cooked. Loved it. Excellent wine list too.I'm happy I live so close to Max's. It's a great spot for a fancy dinner in the dining room area, but also a great place to sit at the bar if you're in the mood for something a little more casual. The service and food really set them apart. Highly recommend!"}, {"review_id": "8Tz1qFXOoQVdp6UZxe9IPg", "user_id": "kDJ9U6gsYuBjmoLoXJrjmg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "We went here as a Valentine's day dinner after I got a gift card as a present. The menu was simple, as it was a narrowed down selection of just a hand full of appetizers, entrees, and desserts to ease the kitchens busy evening. However, in the options there was surely something for everyone. I ordered the lobster bisque, the \"surf & turf\", and the creme brûlée. My company ordered caesar salad, steak au poivre, and strawberry cheesecake. Everything was, in short, delicious. The lobster bisque stood out to me as particularly delicious, perfectly seasoned, flavorful, and decadent. Combined with the fresh baked cheese bread they're dishing out, it is heaven. The creme brûlée was perfectly prepared and was the perfect end to the meal. The cocktail of choice was some sort of vodka lemonade concoction, but was delicious. The service was prompt and friendly, and they even offered to take a picture of us together posed in a corner they said was photogenic and it came out lovely, great evening provided by a great place."}, {"review_id": "xliADh4j9PA1Flb91myDig", "user_id": "if_rQj80tu3qrKV9XMpBdQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "Love this place.The new vibe, post-reno is classic, while sleek and modern.Service is perfect as usual.This time I got the shrimp tacos... excellently prepared and perfectly spiced.Always come here!"}, {"review_id": "d30OKoZ0D2amWytMAhDofw", "user_id": "DuNi6Rgk8eZjFahCyFxp6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I've only been in for a night cap but I love this place for putting me on to what is now my favorite wine.

Our server was so nice, knowledgeable about the menu and drinks, and attentive. We loved the bread, if they gave them in a basket (instead of individually), they'd probably be all gone before our appetizers came. Every one of our appetizers were delicious. Entrees were mostly great too (I'd recommend the prime rib over the sword fish which was a little dry). While the desserts were generally on the sweet side, my group tried all 3 on the Taste of Hartford menu, we still loved our experience.The second time was more of the same, except that the service was only good, not amazing. I would definitely come back and try their regular menu.Reservations are a must though, as it can get pretty packed.

The filet mignon was to die for. Amazing size for a good price. The mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese were full of flavor; tasty and filling in every single bite. I ordered the Pat Lafrieda burger and let me just say that I feel guilty about not having finished it! I'm angry at my full stomach for this one! Or should I blame the burger for being that good? Either way, it was amazing and everything I hoped for. I would have finished it but I was on the verge of blowing up. The creme brulee was creamy and delicious. I also recommend their wine selection. You will not be disappointed. Service was amazing and prompt. Friendly and attentive staff; phenomenal! This is how you run a business. Classy atmosphere and very clean. I cannot wait to come back.

Went after their massive renovations and it is gorgeous inside. Gone are the white tablecloths. Enter a more upscale casual look where jeans fit in with the suits. But it is still THE place for a power lunch. A place to be seen. And the place to impress and be impressed. Had a lunch with a freshened menu too. Sure the old favorites are there including the Cobb salad. But there's new items too. I tried the Branzino. And just wow. Never had a dish that looked quite like it. And add some shishito peppers and you have a dish for the 2017 crowd. Service was outstanding in all ways. Some of the best professional waitstaff around. Welcome back Max.

The bar was really nice and the bar tenders were even better. I tried the Local Lemonade and it was stellar. Just sour enough, not too much liquor. Wasn't disappointed in the slightest. I would absolutely recommend it to others who aren't huge fans of strong alcohol flavors. My partner got something else that was a lot stronger but was still yummy. Additionally, we ordered the soufflé, which much to our surprise was delicious. It was cooked perfectly and the center was exactly what you'd hope for. My partner has been looking for good soufflé for quite a while and he was surprised to find it here. The bartender told us it would be about 20 minutes because they make and cook them from scratch and we really were happy we did.

We started with a creamy mushroom chowder. It was quite rich and filling and my favorite part was the parmesan croutons...yum. For dinner, I had the filet mignon with cheddar mashed potatoes and roasted root vegetables. The steak didn't have much seasoning on it but it was cooked a perfect medium and honestly, it's a high quality filet mignon---it really doesn't need much. My husband had the Hawaiian blue marlin and really enjoyed it, especially the subtle flavor of the coconut carrots. For dessert, I had a delicious vanilla bean creme brûlée with an espresso. Finally, I have to mention that while the food was expertly prepared, part of what made the experience special was the ambiance and service. I almost never mention service in my reviews unless it's exceptionally good or bad, and our waiter was so friendly and personable that he made our night out even more enjoyable.

The place is very elegant, fancy and mature. I loved it. Andrew was our waiter in the tavern. We had never been here before so I had him bring us 2 different martinis that they were known for. We came back with an Espresso Martini and a French Martini. They were very good. We will surely be back for their dinner!Well, I'm back! I came here for Valentine's Day with a special someone. The hosts accommodated my special needs (putting the roses I had given them out on the table so that they were present by the time my date and I sat down) and I really appreciated them for doing that. We started off with a bottle of wine, calamari and a bowl of their carrot bisque. The calamari was the absolute best I've ever had. I will get it every time I'm here. My date had the King Crap Alfredo and I had the 16 oz. New York Strip with a side of truffle fries. It was good, but not worth the $39.95 that it costs. I'll try a different cut of meat next time.
