If you're not sure what to order you have to get their camarones culichi! BEST SAUCE. EVER. My friend got their carne Con papas and loved it as well! And the server was patient with us and helped describe the menu to us since we were new customers. Their menudo is also very flavorful. Been wanting to try their pozole, but every time I go they're always out!! So that must be good!"}, {"review_id": "D7LEk1jJD7KaHY7AAwJSSw", "user_id": "_2h9MazCl88U4Bnry1jHFQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Wow. Solid 4 stars for quality and friendliness  stepped in to get some take out after traveling. Ordered the chimichanga carne asada. Done very well, not a long burrito style but square   Salsa is to die for. People there very friendly. Only a few tables and Spanish TV on but really adds to the authentic ambience. Must try."}, {"review_id": "QMePWGP0SdZVhUGShOlTXQ", "user_id": "2hJZvem-Nj0HJ0wHi8BxAg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/23/2016", "text": "This place is a funny little free standing building that screams Mexican food. Our waitress was really nice and gave us some good recommendations. We tried their horchata, which is definitely from a mix, but it was still good, little on the pricey side though. I really liked their chips and salsa, the chips were warm and extra crispy, we definitely ate two baskets of them. I had a variety of tacos, each 1.50, chicken, carne asada, barbacoa, and al pastor. The pastor was by far the best one, then the chicken, barbacoa, and carne asada last. Usually I love carne asada, but the meat here was super gristly and bland. They had a good salsa bar with limes, cilantro, salsas, radish; and everything was very fresh. My husband got a carne asada burrito and it wasn't the best either. Tacos were pretty good, just steer clear of the carne asada."}, {"review_id": "5FDGh6te8cxpQEtv_dxFvg", "user_id": "9mAOWRr_NiSzY5S9BIA3vw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/12/2016", "text": "This place isnt bad at all. I have been on the search for a good place that serves ceviche. Our waitress was fast and very attentive. We ordered the ceviche and super nachos. The nachos are not the best that ive had but the ceviche was pretty good!

You are seated and have a waitress even though it looks like the kind of place you might order at the counter. Everyone raves about the ceviche, which I thought was good, but the torta I had really blew me out of the water. The bun was fresh and perfectly toasted. The meat quality was pretty good, and the overall flavor with the beans, avocado, and onion was delicious. You can get decent aguas fresca and also great chips and salsa too."}, {"review_id": "w8GcUMu9x7hg4c4Og_B6bA", "user_id": "U_rqhic-HUcNRzk8VWNvAA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2016", "text": "The name says it well...Authentic.  This is a true Mexican restaurant, family style.  I went here based on the reviews on Yelp, and they were right!I will warn you, it is hard to decide. There is a photo board menu, and what you see is really what you get (unlike McD's fake photo food!).  I had the Carne y papas with warm flour tortillas and green sauce. Wonderfully spicy meat that went well with the tart peppery green sauce.  Washed it all down with a Pacifico cerveza. I felt like I was at the Mexico border, not in Utah.Definitely worth the trip to the West side of SLC. I will definitely be back!!"}, {"review_id": "R2Qi2nQJUmiEpFGrctpObA", "user_id": "7hT49AS1e4l3au3kzwQsbg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/16/2017", "text": "Authentic mexican food is always the best.  Menudo and oysters are what I usually get here but haven't tried anything else.

A couple of highlights, a couple of lowlights. I thought the chips and salsa were excellent and both came free with the meal. The salsa had a great flavor. I ordered the Mole but they were out. Bummer. My second choice was the tacos. I tried three types, among the multitude of offerings: al pastor, carnitas, and carne asada. I enjoyed the carnitas the most. The carne asada didn't have a lot of flavor (thank heavens for the tacos condiment bar) and the al pastor seemed really fatty. One highlight was the refried beans, which were very tasty. One lowlight was the overall cleanliness of the space - it was pretty dirty.

We also ordered the barbacoa and it melted in your mouth.  The fajitas were fantastic and something I will order next time we go.The service was outstanding and the waitress was very attentive and proud of the food.
