Since I first started going in 2013, its grown so much! Since my last update, they have expanded the counter space thankfully, making it wider, not longer, giving people a little more space to eat comfortably since you sit relatively close to folks. There is more space in the dining area, but besides that, thankfully, nothing else has changed! They have great lunch options, my favorite, the curry chicken salad continues to be amazing, delicious and satisfying--along with their other goodies, they continue to be a consistent quality presence in downtown Chucktown. Quick lunch spots dont need a bunch of variety. They need consistency, and Persimmon's got it."}, {"review_id": "bQ2ZzO5GBQ7CGoxe7xcvvA", "user_id": "-itSuxMtbcCterX4CR00dg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "I've tried a few things here & as I make my way through the menu choices, some items stick out more than others for me. The adult grilled cheese is savory & I liked the apple addition. Dare I say, it could've been cheesier? Not a big prosciutto fan, so I probably wouldn't order it again. The crab sandwich I had high hopes for, I pictured a creamy mixture of crab salad, melted Jarlsberg, and sherry gastrique. My imagined version was tastier than the real thing & I think what the real McCoy lacked was a greater sherry flavor. Understandably, sherry is one of those things where a little goes a long way, but if it had been kicked up a notch here; I really think it would've made all the flavors of this sandwich come together. The chicken curry salad with balsamic on the side is straightforward & simple. And it works. The curry flavor is upfront & the bright cherry tomatoes add a nice acidic pop. The portion is large, easy to share or split into two meals. The Greek sandwich is different, the large chunks of turkey seem out of place with the other typical Greek salad players (feta, cucumber, tomato, romaine, red onion). It's served open faced on naan (pita like) bread. While you could roll it & eat it like a Gyro, I simply ate it like a salad & only had bits of the tasty naan. I'm not big into sweets, but the Twix Chocolate cookie is to die for! It's a large cookie, good for sharing or stealing away pieces throughout the day."}, {"review_id": "82LGDuDxbxXjE3XE2HwDZQ", "user_id": "VZsPfTXTjTAFbNa4gq21OA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Met some friends for a quick supper on a chilly night. This is a tiny, row style diner attached to a laundry. Row style dining is difficult when you have more that 2 of you, making chatting difficult.The adult grilled cheese was small, but as I'd had a heavy lunch that was fine. It was tasty, and a good crunch on a thicker white bread. The tomato soup was coolish - which I don't mind, but, since it is a restaurant and with food temp rules etc... could be a bit dangerous to let your food cool like that. However, the flavor was exceptionally good.Parking is a pain.

The seating is just 2 long bar tables parallel to each other with metal stools (about 20-25 seats). You can sit with a view of the street or a view of the canvas pictures on the wall. Or I guess you could eat in the laundry area and watch dryers tumble clothes :-)Parking was sparse with just a few spots in front of the laundromat so need to find side streets with open spaces. Ordering is pretty quick with a very efficient lady working the register.  Food delivery was also pretty good considering all the take out orders and dine in waiting they had at the time. The food was excellent! The curry chicken salad was so packed with chicken the sandwich would compress with the attempt to allow it to fit in my mouth! It's a very tasty sandwich once you get it in your mouth!  The grilled cheese was good too with the apple slices inside. Highly recommended for a nice of sandwiches, salads and/or soup."}, {"review_id": "v2W3oTReza236dh-64pfsQ", "user_id": "7KGgPOw4UGsUGrXMHD-6ag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "After looking at several reviews of eateries around MUSC, I was intrigued by several for Persimmon, especially when I saw they had Curry Chicken Salad - and I was not disappointed.

Today, I decided to give the adult grilled cheese a try. Smoked Gouda, cheddar, prosciutto, and green apples with a side of orzo salad. The orzo salad is yummy! Love the cranberries and goat cheese! The sandwich was a little disappointing. It wasn't as cheesy as I had anticipated and the prosciutto was very salty and over powered the whole thing. One bite, and I decided to pull it out of my sandwich. The apples would of balanced the salty meat a bit but there were only three half slices, so they just got lost. Served on a Texas toast style bread, it was too bread heavy. I'll go back for the chicken curry but I'll give the grilled cheese a pass. 7/15/17Recovering from minor surgery I was stoked to find out they deliver!The app they use, think it's called Chownow, was easy to navigate and includes tip options. I prefer to tip in cash, but it's nice to have the option if you don't have cash on hand! I ordered my usual, curry chicken salad, orzo salad and basil lemonade. You can the curried chicken as a sandwich if you prefer. I love the golden raisins and the bits of onion in the curry. Nice combo! If you like goat cheese the orzo salad is a must have! Poor kid that delivered made apologies for the absence of my Basil lemonade. Some accident of some kind. He told me they would credit back the $2.  Before I got halfway through my lunch I received notification that my card was reimbursed. It's not fancy pants. It's just simply good food."}, {"review_id": "Vs8a5oovKNf5A_qvMhFEyQ", "user_id": "eeP54ol-8vc-fsQHZi8VYw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/6/2017", "text": "Being co-located between the Medical District and the College of Charleston on Calhoun Street, this location draws mostly healthcare employees and students.  It is also located inside a Laundromat, so there's that too.  There's not much seating, so it's a good thing most hospital workers get theirs to go, you know, due to the short lunch breaks they get.  Poor kids!  I'm one of them, but somehow I manage!  They have basil limeade and vanilla lemonade to drink!  Both are so delicious and addicting.  Unlimited refills, too.  Most of the menu consists of soups and sandwiches.  It's written on a chalkboard and they usually offer some sort of specials daily.  They have started offering MUSC staff and students a 10% discount with badge.  Not sure if that is also extended to CofC, but probably worth a look.  They also have a punch card.  Their food is freshly prepared and they infuse creative combinations into their offerings.  Take those drinks as an example.  Who would've thought to come up with those combinations?  But, I'm so glad they did.  We usually walk from the hospital so parking isn't an issue, but there is only metered street parking and a few Laundromat spots available on-site.  I have noticed that the metered spaces nearby are never completely full so don't let that scare you away.Servers are always friendly and greet you with a smile.  They never seem bothered, even when there is a huge line at the counter trying to order.  You don't have to wait too long for the meal to be prepared, and can even watch them fix it.  I know we frequent this establishment at least a few times every month for lunch.  I hear they also have nightly specials, but I'm never around to take advantage of them.  They also offer catering and delivery downtown."}, {"review_id": "ABsd9RurZRiyd1KteYX14A", "user_id": "ZdizwYwPiIlhK3G2u-fZnA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/17/2017", "text": "My first time ever ordering/ eating food at a laundromat. It was neat getting to do a little people watching as Persimmon Cafe seems to be frequented by mostly local students from the College of Charleston.I got the grilled zucchini sandwich (without cheese) and a fresh berry custard. It was my first time trying custard, and I was expecting something super thick but it reminded me of soft serve. I would order this again on a hot day.The zucchini sandwich came out hot, and even without cheese, it was a pretty decent vegetarian sandwich.The service is definitely what sets this place apart, in my opinion.Everyone was all smiles and helpful. Despite this being a casual joint, the owner was there and he came out to check on us to see how we were doing.Overall a solid lunch spot on the cheap in an unassuming spot!"}, {"review_id": "TvxswKJ9drFXHcczKxTpVQ", "user_id": "O3nhfuz6W4wlmIQgM_Oo2g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/7/2017", "text": "In search of some refuge from the heat, we were excited to dip inside Persimmon Cafe for some AC and... clean laundry? What an interesting combination of a local coffee shop and laundromat. It makes for a fun instagram photo, that's for sure. I ordered an iced green tea (which they don't typically have, but they used hot water to steep the tea bags and added ice) and a HUGE loaded cookie. It had Cap'n Crunch bits and white chocolate chips and it was chewy and buttery and was washed down well by my tea. A cute little spot with limited seating but a great local shop for a quick bite and refreshment...

So much has changed in my life since then, but 1 constant is that I still love Persimmon with all my heart. My standard order for a while at Persimmon was the curry chicken sandwich (red onions, curry chicken salad, and golden raisins, $7.50). I'm a sucker for curry chicken salad, and this is one of the best you can get. It's got a very strong curry taste, so if you're sensitive to that, I'd recommend one of their other sammies instead.My other favorite sandwich is The Greek (thick-cut turkey, Greek-style salad, sheep's milk feta, mayo, warm naan bread, $8). The sheep's milk feta has a unique taste, much different from regular feta. It's creamier and goes really well with whatever dressing they put on the Greek salad (I'm assuming Greek dressing??). The whole sandwich is a work of art.No matter what I come in for, or how hungry I am, I always order the orzo pasta salad. It's got a great amount of tang from the vinegar that's balanced out by the creaminess of the goat cheese. It's heaven. I also love the rosemary lemon tea. They use a lemon-rosemary simple syrup that they add to their freshly brewed tea, and it is unique and totally delicious."}, {"review_id": "wa7p5R-3cAR4wOvjEzoghw", "user_id": "OrYgrJcq43BYrOxuqSumBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/23/2017", "text": "Persimmon really deserves it 5-stars.

Then, you'd hear everyone talking about how great it is and how delicious the food is, so you have to check it out. The food speaks for itself!Every time I go, I'm impressed with how good it is. The paninis are so flavorful. I started with the adult grilled cheese. The tart apple with the melted smoked gouda is the perfect combo. I really liked it, so I refused to get anything else. Recently, I've started to branch out and I tried one of the new sandwiches with chicken, pesto, and fresh red onions. It was so good. I hate that I can't remember the sandwich name and I can't find it listed on the online menu. Anyways, I also tried the orzo pasta salad! OMG so good. I could eat a bucket of it. Very yummy. Crumbled goat cheese on the top really adds to the flavors!Okay....When you visit Persimmons you MUST MUST MUST try the Nutella and Toasted Marshmallow custard. It's seriously the ish. Just FYI a mini is going to be plenty. I know you're going to want to go big on your first time, just try the mini first. I'm in a food coma after this bad boy and I have no regrets. It's that good. Overall, I'd recommend Persimmons for lunch, dinner or take-out. It's a solid spot! I just hate, how like Chick-fil-A, I always crave it on Sunday...because they are closed."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/persimmon-cafe-charleston?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
