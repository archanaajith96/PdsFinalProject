Their food is actually very delicious and it seems like they put so much care into making it. The owner guy came and talked to me for a bit, we chatted for a few moments, finished my meal and walked out the door. It was a great experience and if I am ever in the area I will definitely come back to this place for some bomb homemade hummus and some flavored jasmine rice with lamb and veggies."}, {"review_id": "bfiF7VZUEEvZFF32xpz58Q", "user_id": "Qz7XU2bJfdAR_va18B5Ulw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Went here for lunch because of all the amazing reviews and it sure did not disappoint. We walked in during a slow hour and were immediately greeted by the owner. He was extremely friendly and chatted with us for awhile, which I really appreciate because it added to the homey atmosphere the place already had. We sat next to a group of four who welcomed us and praised the place. I believe that it speaks volumes when the customers there are regulars and feel comfortable welcoming other customers to the restaurant. Two of my friends and I shared the Middle Eastern Combination for the appetizer because that was recommended by the owner and the other customers and absolutely loved it. The falafel was the most flavorful falafel I have ever had. I generally don't like it because I thought that falafels, in general, do not have much flavor. Now, I think I've just been eating bad falafels. The outside shell was crisp and firm but the inside was moist and smoky. It was honestly wonderful.For my main dish, I had the chicken shawarma sandwich and added the fries because the other customers suggested I do so. The sandwich was pretty much a pita bread with chicken shawarma piled on top. It was worth every cent and more!! The veggies on the sandwich were very fresh and the chicken was hot and delicious. I ended up eating it with a fork and knife because there was too much stuffing for the pita bread to hold (a very good problem in my opinion). The fries were skinny and extremely well seasoned. I thought it was odd for the restaurant to make fries, at first, but I would definitely recommend them to anyone coming for lunch."}, {"review_id": "z67_AHC1l4HKWdJVp1n6bw", "user_id": "DMa98XYCPM2j0bB67q-iOg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "We've lived in the neighborhood for a couple of years and we've frequently passed by this restaurant. We kept saying, \"We should try that,\" and we're so glad we finally did!Cafe Paprika is tucked away in the corner of a small shopping center, but it is far from being a \"hole in the wall.\" The interior is small yet intimate, with beautiful decor and friendly staff that make for a truly warm and welcoming environment. We had the immense honor of being waited on by one of the owners, Chakib, who greeted us with a big smile, made pleasant conversation, and recommended the best items on the menu without being pushy. At Chakib's recommendation, we enjoyed the Middle Eastern Combination appetizer (hummus, baba ghanouj, and falafel), two tajines with saffron rice for our entrees (the kadra with lamb, potatoes and garbanzo beans, as well as the vegetarian with olives, artichokes, and assorted vegetables), and m'hencha for dessert (puff pastry phyllo dough stuffed with almond paste). What really made our meal special was the Moroccan mint tea, which we'd never had before, but we each ended up having several glasses and now can't imagine how we'd ever dined without it. All of the food was expertly prepared and I've got to say that the tajines were by far some of the best culinary experiences I've ever had. The flavor profiles were impeccable and since the meal is a type of stew, I do recommend splurging on the extra rice to soak up all of the sauce. Our evening at Cafe Paprika made for a memorable date night and was worth every penny. If I could have done anything differently, it would have been to either 1) come with a bigger stomach or 2) order more of the lamb because it was so tender it literally melted in my mouth. Thanks, Chakib - keep up the good work!"}, {"review_id": "UHJ1eIB8qFUyRUou--5XVA", "user_id": "1_UZSw5lYH0HOxnoo6R-OA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Thé couscous was amazing! Thé pastilla was the best I have ever had. Thé hrirra soup was hot filling and fresh. The owner was so hospitable and pleasant. If you are looking for a good home cooked meal this is the place to go. It gives you that home cooked warm feeling inside. Vegetables and meat were so fresh. Moroccan mint tea was poured high into the cup just like traditional Moroccan style. I highly recommend this place. Def a 5 out of 5"}, {"review_id": "uhieq-qlO_u3C9BxnJEYZg", "user_id": "BpQfXnk5flVJ43UvKkdM2g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Wow. This place is utterly fantastic. And inexpensive. Authentic Moroccan food, the place is run by a very pleasant, man from Fez, Morocco.

The owner was our server, and I can't remember a more hospitable host in recent history. I'm shy, but even so, I felt comfortable chatting with him. Nice mural inside, which was a welcome contrast to the strip mall exterior. We started with the Chicken Bastilla, and I recommend you do the same. I've had Mediterranean food before, but never anything like this! The owner told us that every wedding or celebration in Morocco starts with this dish. The mint tea was lovely, and served traditionally in small, faceted glasses. My gyro sandwich was not the best I'd ever had, but still quite good. However, I will sample something else the next time I go. And there WILL be a next time!  M'hencha for dessert was another new dish for me, and quite tasty. Prices were slightly higher than in the pictures shown here, but still a good value for the food. They've been in that location for 24 years, and it's no surprise why they've been successful!"}, {"review_id": "-KPP4ip33BjNtFSxdf4HwA", "user_id": "kkTmo4Ic0GY2UyCWJyAGxA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Absolutely blown away.

We were the only folks in the place, and were able to have some nice chats with the owner (20+ years in business).  We watched a food/travel show on Tangiers, so had searched for tagines, and this place came right up.  At first I thought I had misplayed it, as the lunch menu did not include the tagine, but the owner assured me that they could do it.  I opted for the lamb tafaya tagine, and my veggie gal opted for the mediterranean sampler with those excellent falafels (green chickpeas!), and a really good baba ganoush. My tagine was just excellent - I opted for the rice base, but was tempted by the couscous too (next time!).  The lamb was cooked *just right* and easily pulled from the large leg bone to dance with the mild spices.  You could tell that this restaurant adapted to the older, more limited palate of Denver by muting some of the spice profiles but that the methods used to prepare the food were evergreen. We topped things off with a very tasty housemade baklava and more of that excellent mint tea. The place is quite small but nicely lived in, with cool murals.  I bet it would get quite loud when full of families, but that would be fun too.  Overall a really solid option out in the very interesting belt of ethnic restaurants in Aurora - kudos to the owner for keeping it going all these years!"}, {"review_id": "uCcDLnjfRe7J9ULNReoc3Q", "user_id": "g31bFjnUN9VoWbZI8Ox1UQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/4/2017", "text": "Wow I was amazed!!!!food was delicious very friendly and excellent waiting ...actually the owners take care of customers.

Was with a colleague and we ordered the hummus/falafel/babaghanous app. It was wonderful. The pita that came with is was pillowy-soft and chewy, perfect to scoop it all up with! Opted for the soup vs. salad and it was really good- totally on point with big flavor yet light. Used the few left over pita strips to dunk. I had the lamb shank over rice and it was delicious. Not fatty at all and the veggies and sauce all worked together to make a beautiful melange with the rice.My partner had the apricot chicken over couscous and I (of course!) Sampled it- that was very tasty and honestly the best couscous i've ever had.The mint tea and coffee were excellent as well. Food and service are excellent. The location is strip mall and it's nothing fancy. It is pleasant and quite so ok for casual dating. Again, not much ambience or even music however it is great food with wonderful attentive service at very reasonably priced choices. If I lived there I could see myself being a regular.   Oh, and they also do take out!"}, {"review_id": "LiUN8siq1WPH1UqJX0e_jg", "user_id": "NEjcbCaS6j6R6QN0MvnM9w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/18/2017", "text": "The food is great!
