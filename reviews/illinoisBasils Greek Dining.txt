Angelo answered the phone took our reservation and asked if we were celebrating a special occasion, it so happend that we were indeed celebrating my Daughter graduation from college.We arrived at Basil's and was greeted by Angelo.  We were escorted to our table and to our surprise the menus were custom printed for my daughter. The entire staff was spectacular our guests were treated like royalty. I can not rave enough about this place.The food was outstanding as usual. This is as close to my Yia Yias cooking as I have found over the years. This alone is the reason we keep coming back. Thank you again for making my daughter's special day even more special."}, {"review_id": "cDx5DGsFV7J6RftlkoHUsA", "user_id": "ZvOq4_jErHRaL7O7OflLvg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Loved this place!  First time here on a Sunday night.  The food was great and our server was awesome!We started with the Saganaki (flaming cheese) since my mother had never dined at a Greek Restaurant.  It was typical - good, we ate it on our bread.  We also had the Dolmades (grape leaves stuffed with lamb and beef) as an appetizer, even though it was only on the dinner menu, they were happy to oblige.  They were large, bratwurst size and very good.I had the Beef Kabobs - very tender filet with peppers and onions.  They also came with rice and potatoes.  Way too much to eat at once. My mother had the 12 oz Rib Eye, which in my opinion was more like 16 oz. My husband had a grilled Mahi Mahi special and also thought it was great.Wine was reasonable - $10 for a nice Petit Syrah from Napa.  I almost never get dessert, but our table shared the Chocolate Mousse Cake with Oreo crust.  I highly recommend it. All in all a great dinner.  A little more than we usually spend, but worth it. We will definitely be back for a special occasion."}, {"review_id": "9IS3Ic-QRQwqTCzhXfBooA", "user_id": "nVtdDUZXSr0vLtMUdzii_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "I should have written this review several years ago. I had been to this restaurant several times with family and had fantastic experiences every time. We were so impressed with the food, the service, and the ambiance of the restaurant that my husband and I held our rehearsal dinner here in the fall of 2014. It's been a while, so I cannot remember our servers' names, but they were so fast, accommodating, and very friendly. The private room was cozy and sparkling clean and perfect for our party of 40. Most importantly, dare I say our dinner here was more delicious than our actual wedding reception dinner!!! We gave our guests a choice between the Basil's chicken and salmon and both were hits. Our family and friends were raving. For the price we paid, it was also a great value. The owner gave my husband a military discount, but their full price was still very reasonable. I was planning a wedding from out of state and Basil's was so accommodating and easy to work with.Thank you, Basil! Now that we are back in Illinois, we will be returning!"}, {"review_id": "Bf_J2Etk0ORfhDHtuRvQLA", "user_id": "NlFLOMZy03NTDqjjWhllnw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "My friends and I decided to try this restaurant for Restaurant Week and was very pleased with our meal.

Amazing Greek food that can hold its own with any restaurant in Greektown. Tender lamb dishes each and every time.  The trio of spreads is excellent as well as their speciality bread and basil butter.  The service is impeccable, helpful and friendly.  Will continue to come whenever I crave delicious Greek food.  I'm impressed with the consistency of both the service and the food.

I know it will be good every time and I wont be leaving unhappy. Great atmosphere. Large outdoor patio in summer and nice indoor bar. Good selection of craft beers and wines. Great service.

They take reservations however I found that weekday lunches aren't very busy so probably not needed. Service has always been great. Prices are reasonable. Both times I had the chicken kabob which comes with rice and potatoes. I've also had the cream of chicken rice soup. The ambiance is nice such that you can go for a casual meal or something a little formal for a celebration. If you're looking for good Greek food in the Naperville/Aurora area, I would recommend Basils."}, {"review_id": "iDSWBzhtlhbmoTtkVq3bDQ", "user_id": "YuTW2rwcwl4CT8c2AMpa8w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "This place is outstanding delicious! Worth the price though! If I want to eat cheap I would go to a food truck! This is a fresh, fancy dining with a friendly atmosphere. My fiancé and I go there for celebrations and enjoy the food omg what a treat! The place is also so pretty and inviting. We had been there about 5 times! The first time they gave us a $20 off coupon if we order about $50. We were aware the place was not cheap but the flavors of their food made us go back more!

We were on a date night and thought the upscale atmosphere and classy feel would be perfect for a drink and dinner. The host set the tone with elegance but after that things sort of fell apart. I ordered a Manhattan and hubby ordered an Old Fashioned, but when our server brought our drinks, she set them down and declared that she forgot the garnish on one. Oh well, no big deal. After a bit, she came back and said she'd mixed up the drinks and given my to hubby and hubby's to me. Honestly, we sipped them again and it was difficult to tell which was which! In our previous visits, we have felt that cocktails were not really the strong suit there and this didn't help our impression. Then when our food came, the server awkwardly sort of tossed our silverware by our places. Kind of jarring, considering the elegant greeting upon entrance. On to the food: we ordered two apps and a main, intending to split all three. There used to be a veggie-type sampler on the menu but no more. I'd never tried the Eggplant Parmesan, and was dreaming of the usual assemblage of eggplant, cheese, sauce and breadcrumbs. What arrived was slices of eggplant stacked up with a little cheese and spaghetti sauce, with a side of angel hair pasta, very lightly dressed with sauce. It was so bland and disappointing, not what we expected. The beets and skordalia were tasty but surprisingly salty and pungent. Well, skordalia should be pungent with garlic but this was oddly sharp tasting. The saving grace was the lima bean dish, always delicious, with spices and other veggies in a tasty tomato based sauce. Frankly, we were disappointed and feel that the quality has diminished over our last two visits. That plus the awkward service situation made us feel it wasn't worth the price tag. Sorry to say we won't be back."}, {"review_id": "hn_LVBmnbI6RFpDFUUVHsA", "user_id": "RBIAAOUNVLJ26ziIZ9dlcg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/3/2017", "text": "After a busy week Basil's is a nice venue to relax and enjoy good food. On this trip we decided to sample something new. Our adventure led us to try an octopus app, saganaki, avgolemono soup and lamb macaroni & cheese mostaccioli! As usual the food was above average and good size portions for the price point. Be aware, the lamb mac & cheese has \"pulled\" lamb-meat which definitely offers a different bite for the palate. Great service, great eats, and a great time at Basil's!"}, {"review_id": "CQYXtIZs8w3Ymg9NSZVHWA", "user_id": "X2yAxfQrjJTYfz-FVJuzwg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/17/2017", "text": "Naperville/aurora Greek dining at its best.  Love the lamb chops done medium.You might as well get five because 3 is not enough once you try them.
