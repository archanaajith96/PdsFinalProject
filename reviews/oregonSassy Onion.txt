Never been to this place before, heard great things about this place but we got screwed.  My son and I got seated out at a small wobbly table in a back room with a loud family of 12 including small children against a wall where dishwasher guys were  banging on the wall entire time.  The room was like for large parties, there was multiple empty (large & small) tables in the 'normal' part of the restaurant. But instead, I got to look at the bathroom door for my expensive meal. We got seated minutes after the large party did so we all ordered together & spent our entire meal there with these loud people. In this tiny room. Our waitress did her best to make it accommodating. The manager clearly saw this was absurd yet didn't offer to correct the situation. Thankfully the food came quick, it wasn't anything special, I thought it was going to be amazing from the reviews, but no. Just regular, but worse cause the atmosphere.  Oh, & not that it's the restaurants fault, but wow this large loud family was so rude!!!  Even to the waitress, \"um, waitress, this food is beyond cold!\"Like, how rude. There's a dozen of you & she's doing her best, over your loud tablets playing tv shows and annoying women. HORRIBLE FIRST (& last) IMPRESSION!!"}, {"review_id": "Ywna6T9QlkBs7eB8exdfOQ", "user_id": "ypvO5jyuvC-EbDZqoDXtuA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/11/2017", "text": "Big, home cooked breakfast.

And for my college freshman (Go Bearcats!), Sassy Onion was a great break from on campus dining. We hit the weekend rush just right and missed the long lines that formed just after we were seated.He had a Berry Bliss fruit smoothie and their \"World Famous French Toast.\" There are several options served all day and he chose the Fresh Fruit Fields Forever with strawberries folded into sweet whipped cream. Personally, I prefer a more traditional presentation when the too aren't mixed together, but he enjoyed his meal. It was good, but \"world famous\" is a bit of a stretch. I think most people 'Combo Up' adding eggs and bacon or sausage, because without a side it is one large piece of brioche with the topping.I chose the Breakfast Tacos and added 1/2 an avocado for $2 extra. Very tasty and I would definitely order it again. Prices were fine with most entrees around $10 before add-ons or extras and the smoothie was a bit pricey $6.00.This will be in his college rotation when the parents come to visit and while I prefer Word of Mouth Neighborhood Bistro, this is a fun casual option just steps from campus."}, {"review_id": "mZsbALAh6owqGM2jxKjsAA", "user_id": "zrnerPfo00r6fWH_cMWr7g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Only reason I'm giving a 4 and not 5 is because my kids and I went for biscuits and gravy and they were \"ok\".

Tastes likes a grapefruit soda. First time I've seen colored sugar on the side of a drink. Probably wouldn't order again but then I'm not a big fan of grapefruit.The Bloody Mary's are HUGE: \"Solid\" I hear. Slightly better than average. I'd probably try this in the future. Banana and Walnut French Toast: I hear it's quite good. Would probably try this next time. Mixed Berry French Toast: thick toast! Berries don't have too much flavor but I'd say the dish is decent. Wouldn't order it again though. 3 stars. Bread is too thick. If you order the double stack it'd be WAY too much. Homemade strawberry jam: FABULOUS!! OMG. Make sure to put this on your French toast to add another 1-2 star experience. This should come standard on the mixed berry FTFratata: I hear they are tastier than expected.Fresh fruit cup: Meh. Decent but not worth the price.Side of sausage: Good!

How are you and Does she like pancakes?  Five minutes later the cook personally comes over with great joy and pride and hands my daughter a plate with a pancake.  That's customer service and taking pride in the quality of your work.Fast forward... We get to Sassy Onion maybe a little bit after 11 am.  I get my daughter situated and ready to order.  The waitress hands me a menu for me and her.  I look over her menu which has a small listing of things to eat.  Okay cool, they have one pancake and a side of bacon that I know she'll eat for sure.  I tell the waitress I want to get her that.  Then I get... \"We stopped serving breakfast at 11 am.  Sorry.\"  I get bit irritated because I know pancakes don't take long to make at all.  Plus it's a kids pancake... I'm not asking for a stack.  Then I am like alright... I look at the menu again and I see eggs and toast.  Easy enough right... my daughter will eat that... they can make eggs anytime and they even toast bread for sandwiches.  Sold!  \"Once again we don't make breakfast after 11... plus we put the toaster away and we can't get it back out.\"  I about lost a gasket.  I held it together and ordered her a cheeseburger with no bun.  Funny enough, I could order a banana french toast with candied walnuts, eggs and bacon.  Which I did.  You know what I did... I shared that with my daughter because I wanted to try and keep my promise.  Even though I wasn't happy with the situation I wanted to try start my day off in a positive way.When I was finished with my meal, we quietly got up.  Went to the register.  I told the cashier when he asked me how my meal was I told him I wasn't happy with it for the reasons stated here.  He looked at my receipt and said \"Well I am sorry but you got here after 11 am and we stopped serving breakfast then.\"  I said \"It doesn't take much effort for the things I asked for.\"  Most places do accommodate to things like that even if it is begrudgingly.  I wasn't looking for a free breakfast, lunch, coupon or discount on my meal.  I was more looking for \"Hey we could of done better or checked the back.\"  It was all about the effort.  So with that said... he gave me the receipt to sign.  I signed it and gave them $4 tip on a $20 something meal (which most people wouldn't have done) and we walked out.That will be the last time I spend or send another dollar their way.  Sadly enough I was one of the people rooting for them after the fire."}, {"review_id": "rXv3khC9QLDWSY4fQF7RLw", "user_id": "Qn7P7AbjZz6qqYuqViPj2g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "We were in Salem for a couple days visiting Willamette University Bearcat Days and decided to find a spot for breakfast in town.

When we arrived they were surprisingly not too busy. When we were finally acknowledged we were told that they would get the room ready for us (isn't that the point of making a reservation? There were only 6 of us) Almost 10 minutes later we were finally seated. Our order was taken & our food arrived fairly quickly. After receiving our order that was the last we saw of anyone. No one checked on us, offered drink refills, boxes, etc. After finishing our lunch & waiting a good 15 minutes for someone to come check on us one person in our group had to go up to the front & ask for our checks, box & to go order!
