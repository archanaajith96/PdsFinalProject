Once seated I asked what's good and my waitress told me to try the speciality pizzas. I ordered buddy's bread, cheese sticks, bbq chicken pizza and deluxe pizza. Buddy's bread- This was like garlic bread sticks with marinara sauce. It was a good appetizer to start my dinner experience here. Cheese sticks- This were amazing for some odd reason. They weren't your typical frozen fried ones... These were fresh and would crumble easily because they were freshly made. BBQ chicken pizza- This Sicilian style pizza was delish! The tender pieces of chicken and barbecue sauce matched perfectly. This is a great pizza to try!Deluxe meat pizza- This pizza had all the meats and was a little too heavy for me. It had all the meats you can think of but like I said it was heavy. This restaurant definitely has lived up to the hype and I highly recommend this place."}, {"review_id": "e6cB97h9SpgC4jPI7A3cdQ", "user_id": "b0zgSrXBDq8hsamvmjqEqA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Buddy's has been doing Detroit Style pizza since the 40's.  I ordered a four piece margarita pizza and a chicken tenders appetizer.  Pizza - square style only at Buddy's.  Which I love when I'm in Brooklyn or in any of the five boroughs. In Detroit, not so much.  It wasn't awful, just didn't do it for me.  The crust was the highlight. It was crunchy and Parmesan crusted.  The dough, sauce and cheese were just ok.  Chicken Fingers- ok, these were awesome. Lightly breaded and they looked made to order and fresh.  No frozen chicken here. They were the highlight of the meal and I would eat here again just for the chicken fingers. The staff was friendly. Place was retro funky and they have arcade games which gets them bonus points."}, {"review_id": "-Pfk6bNXCYDXrDcKip6Bug", "user_id": "AsNIsOI8uthp6qfQhW36_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "If you're from New York, you tend to argue New York pizza is the best kind of pizza.If you're from Chicago, you tend to argue Chicago pizza is the best kind of pizza.It's reason to believe if you're from Detroit, you should argue Detroit pizza is the best kind of pizza! I enjoy Chicago deep dish and I love New York thin pizza, but there's something magical about Detroit Sicilian style.Buddy's prides themselves on being the original since the 40s (1943 if memory serves me?) and I can see why. Their menu does include your standard appetizers (best thing is Buddy Bread!), salads, sandwiches, and entrees. But the best thing on their menu is Detroit pizza.Buddy's offers a variety of pizzas - classic Detroit, thin crust, and gluten free crust. But this is my favorite Detroit pizza because the sauce is more of a sweet marinara and the pizza itself is fluffy, but not too tall (so you 're not terribly full after 2 slices). They use fresh mushrooms (not canned!)"}, {"review_id": "jOyIQxzMMm91yh9LvZZ88A", "user_id": "GX4R9SIz3JsRrQdqzYP9bA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/18/2017", "text": "The six of us arrived for dinner on a busy Tuesday evening and we were seated quickly with our server arriving at our table before we knew it.  With menu perused and decision made, I found myself saying:  \"I'd like to order the Lake Huron 4 square with a side salad with Italian dressing and a New Holland, The Poet, Oatmeal Stout please\".Now beer is beer and salad is a salad but I was there for some of that unique Detroit Style pizza that I can't get at home.  My Four Square came out perfectly crisped and cheesy with that flavorful Motor City cheese blend, spinach artichoke blend, roasted tomatoes and fresh spinach on top.  My fork and knife made short work of that pizza.  I could almost pretend that I was eating healthy as I sat there and stuffed my face with that hot and gooey deliciousness.Pizza, beer and good friends just seem to go together don't they?  Buddy's is a great casual place to meet up with friends and enjoy some time that always seems to end much too soon.  Thanks to Laurie H., Tod H., Susan M., Amy B. and Mr. \"Center of Attention\": Blake H. for sharing some great food and great company.  I had a great time and I'm definitely up for another visit sometime soon.Buddy's Pizza is always a solid 4 stars no matter which location you go to."}, {"review_id": "jVwMAxAtNHDg6n5QJHiQiw", "user_id": "l2UG7LCUc--94cx2aqNC-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "I haven't been here in years unfortunately.

Unfortunately, Loui's is closed on Tuesdays so we relocated to Buddy's. I haven't been to this chain in over 20 years. I had two 20 oz Buddy brews (4.5% ABV) which is a pale wheat ale brewed by Griffin Claw. You could definitely taste the grapefruit flavor in the beer.  I'm a huge fan of fruity beers and this one went perfectly with my pizza. The 4 square meat deluxe specialty pizza (pepperoni, sausage, ham, bacon, and ground beef) was a perfect Detroit style pizza, which is a square deep dish with a thick, crunchy crust. I ate three squares but could have easily eaten the last square. The waitress was wonderful. There wasn't any awkwardness waiting for the drinks, food or bill. I'll have to return to try their antipasto salad. It looked really good. It was great meeting Mike, Laurie (her grandson and hubby), and Amy."}, {"review_id": "OUcyU7WJ0LNxkTJjvvcyaw", "user_id": "oOMP1ZF7DHV-Uts35xxkVw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Buddy's!

This gluten-free pizza surpassed the last one. Hands-down the best GF pizza I've ever had. I'll definitely return next time I'm in town. Kudos to fabulous gluten-free pizza!  I went knowing it wouldn't even compare to their excellent non-GF pizza. I was proven wrong!  House-made dough that certainly stands up to their non-GF pizza. My only complaint is I ate too much. I will definitely be returning when I come back to town. I should note, for those that don't know, Buddy's regular pizza is some of the best pizza around. That is the opinion of my family who has not lived here in over 20 years.

I was warned that it was a deep dish pizza but this isn't your traditional Chicago style deep dish. It is somewhere in between so a little less thick and less heavy which I like better. It comes in square format and I ordered their specials 8 squares but they were able to let me do 4 squares of the Lake Ontario and 4 squares of Lake Erie. I must say the Lake Ontario pizza was unique, it had a sweet and savory because of the pineapple and Canadian bacon. I also ordered the Antipasta which was mostly cheese and meat but it was still good.  Definitely worth coming back again if I am craving pizza. btw this place gets busy in the evening, so come early!"}, {"review_id": "32hxZ35Glozns7MGNBbA8A", "user_id": "MHIKS3Op3Mmf0LFtihuUpg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/16/2017", "text": "Buddy's makes a good pizza. Really they do. The problem is, over they years, the former greatness has faded. Believe me, Buddy's was the place for pizza in the 1980's. Big hair and all. Not anymore. My biggest beef? The size of the pizza has shrunk and the cost has inflated two fold. They use quality ingredients but have trouble assembling a consistent product. So my big three criticisms of Buddy's Pizza are: inconsistency, too small and too pricey.So don't go out of your way for this place anymore. Don't feel sorry for them. The place is still packed with crowds. Especially at lunch, all the GM Tech Center middle-managers eat here, dropping coin on the former glorious. Plus the big hair 80's people are now in their fifties and sixties and have indoctrinated their grandchildren into the Buddy's Cult.Beware of the militant Buddy's cult floating out there, blindly supporting it's every whim and ready to fight at any criticism, swooned by pizza romance, denial, hyperbole, and all that kinda stuff.  That said, I stand by this review with samurai pen in hand."}, {"review_id": "eCqcAWebHZLCLjI3wi_psQ", "user_id": "h83zxgXSvi4inSQ6POfNeQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2017", "text": "Buddy's, what can I say, it's a Detroit institution! I've been to various locations around the Metro Detroit area. The first one I went to was their original location on McNichols and Conant in Detroit. Along with having some of the best Detroit style pizza, they do have other items on their menu. Very few people look past the pizza, but their pastas and salads are excellent. The thing I like about the Warren location is that most of their waitstaff has been there for many years. That means that if you have been going there for a while you get to know the waiters and waitresses that give you excellent service. If you are visiting from out of state, make sure you visit a Buddy's location to sample our great pizza."}, {"review_id": "7PNk7eS8FcPLPoq161PxDg", "user_id": "Z1aqfuadxbOCR87dPItefQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "11/8/2017", "text": "Beware of going off the menu during a pizza party.
