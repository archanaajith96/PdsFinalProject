The pide, Turkish pizza with the edges of the dough are folded in to make a boat-shape, is wonderful. The most interesting thing is the way they serve it. It comes on a long wooden board (like 1 meter long). I tought I would never finish it. I did! It was so good and beyond better than what I expected. I also tried the butter and 2 eggs pide (Item # 22). This pide comes in a round shape. This traditional Turkish meal turned it into my new favorite breakfast. The eggs and cheese will melt in your mouth. Make sure you try the lovely Turkish tea and feel as though you are in Turkey ;)"}, {"review_id": "Si7QCY79Voh4Q_PdNPa6lQ", "user_id": "ewHZnpWChCh38FtLmvvOuQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "This shop is located on a stripe with many other stores. We could have easily missed the entrance if it wasn't for my friend to point out where it was. They were friendly, n the service was fast. Best yet, the food was amazing. The little pickled appetizer came up first but it was too spicy and sour for me since I don't really ear spicy. My friend and I both had pide. She had the one with spinach n cheese and I have the one with ground beef. I had never had a pide before so the whole cutting it on the broad with pizza cutter was so awesome. I loved the vegetarian pide. It tasted really fresh. The thin crust was so crunchy and nicely baked it was like a party in your mouth. The food weren't expensive at all. We both got a bunch of food to go so we can pig out later at home! Woohoo this is definitely a win for Turkish food. And I will definitely come back!"}, {"review_id": "SOhqXpqPN1gQUlDtpBMcCA", "user_id": "otEUiu4QmtOC6ewul-3FAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "Taste: 5 starsService: 5 starsPrice & Quality: 4 starsNo need to say anything!

As soon as we entered, we were greeted and seated. It was the middle of the weekday around 1 pm. Our hostess/waitress was dressed casually in jeans and a T-shirt. We ordered the pide and lahmachun. I don't eat lahmachun, my wife does. The Pide was excellent. And of course we were served traditional Turkish tea. The food did not take long to come out and we enjoyed the Turkish music videos  playing in the background TV. Our waitress, was okay. I felt like she could have been friendlier. But we had our 1 year old son sitting on a high chair at the table and he was dropping napkins, bits of food and utensils on the floor. I caught her staring at these items and making a face like, \" I'm going to have to clean that up.\" I was actually thinking I was going to clean up what I could of what our son had dropped at the end of our meal. Her attitude rubbed me the wrong way and that's why I didn't give this place 5 stars. It bothered me so much that I left a smaller tip than I usual would for the cost of the meal and service. So while this place is affordable and has appetizing food, you might want to rethink coming here if you have children under 4."}, {"review_id": "qrgnBrIF1fuiY7mYzroKHw", "user_id": "pYabD-1Gfv0AU4nmJnwa3A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "I visited this place twice, they have the best Pide (Turkish Pizza) I have had.

The bill came to $17.00, we wanted to pay by credit card. This BITC% takes our card, comes back and says, \"sorry $20.00 minimum.\" We like \"OK, no problem,\" we pull cash and casually tell her, you should really post the minimum credit card charge, she said \"You should ask,\" and were like, \"how are we supposed to know?\" This girl says, \"it's not my problem,\" we ask her to give us our change, and tell her we are not coming back, she says, \"That's OK\" - worst of all the owner is right their watching the whole thing.

The place is clean, the staff friendly and I get the sense that the mostly get local Turkish people, so I am guessing it is pretty authentic. The mostly have a similar dish called Pide (pastry with different filling) so I will have to go back and try some.Came back a second time and had the ground meat pide, it was very good. This time they gave me some spicy pickled vegetables which were really yummy. I think I prefer the lamachun because I like the contrast of the cold vegetables."}, {"review_id": "2932EJ6q7LH0XYT6p9Y_uA", "user_id": "_Ied-xo8n13y6jL8vwqXIg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/3/2017", "text": "Very friendly staff only one person speaks English.
