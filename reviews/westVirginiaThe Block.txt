My salad with chicken was only $11 and an excellent portion size. Stopped in for lunch during an afternoon trip to Charleston. It was a sunny day and the patio was open. Very nice atmosphere and extremely friendly staff. Food wait was slightly long, but that's due to them cooking everything fresh, and the wait was worth it for the quality of what came out."}, {"review_id": "SDRSbA0LizjN6ZvwomqLUg", "user_id": "7v9NcIi3xVTEzIOMXfGGgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "I'm a WV native, but I've lived in NYC for the past 6 1/2 years, so my restaurant standards are pretty high. I must say, I'm extremely impressed by my first experience at The Block! The service was fantastic, our server was friendly and attentive but not over the top. He was knowledgeable about the menu, and really helped make our dining experience pleasant. They have a great selection of wines, and a handful of creative cocktails. We ordered a cheese plate and tapas sampler to start. The cheese plate selection was on point (try the Smoked Gouda!) and the tapas plate was the perfect pairing as it had charcuterie, olives, marcona almonds, and arancini. For an entree - I ordered the 6 oz fillet and it was prepared perfectly.  The mushroom risotto side dish is a must-try. My mom got the sea bass and my dad got the cubano with feta fries - they were both equally as pleased with their meal as I was. The portion sizes are what NORMAL portion sizes should be, not obnoxious portions like you would find in some other establishments. Also, the presentation of everything was aesthetically pleasing. Overall, I'm really pumped to have The Block in Charleston as my new go-to spot when I'm missing the food culture of NYC (which is pretty much all the time haha). I'm definitely heading there for brunch soon to try one of their salads!"}, {"review_id": "x_NojHA86tlSghRXmzfmag", "user_id": "swusleWKg9xt0br-x-voCA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "Visiting Charleston and stopped in here. Got a sampling of things so I could do a proper review. Overall, very good food and experience, but a few comments re improving a few of the food items.1) tapas sampler. Overall, pretty good array of apps. The star by far were the Marcado almonds! Toasted and salty-- they were delicious. The marinated Olives were very good too. Arancini is what you would expect-- nice flavor to the marinara. Hummus was a dud; no flavor/no salt. If I had to do it again, I would probably forego the sampler for just the almonds.2) trio of meatballs. These were huge! Definitely shareable for like 5-6 people. The pesto pork and beef marinara meatballs were terrific. The chicken one was terrible; the white sauce on it was gummy with no flavor, and the meatball also needed more flavor. 3) arugula salad. Pretty average. Was a little disappointed that it had canned mandarin oranges on it instead of real oranges, but I dealt with that. I was between this salad and the goat cheese one and would probably go goat cheese next time.4) Chilean sea bass. Very strong dish. Fish was cooked properly. The sweet carrots though made this dish and made it came together. Recommend this one.5) didn't have any of the wines but their selection seems stellar. As a sparkling water snob, the lurisia bottle they carry is very high quality. Service and ambiance was great. You should visit this place."}, {"review_id": "wlfFz4Ny21VmDo4BLNMvRw", "user_id": "_MEl132zRnv85RaRKcvcRA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/10/2017", "text": "Pleasantly surprised to find a nice restaurant open for brunch in Charleston on Sunday at 11am.....Ordered the Smothered Grilled Chicken Sandwich, w/fontina, sautéed mushrooms, bacon and drizzled honey mustard. Quite delicious and cooked to perfection. The menu is somewhat limited but covers basic brunch items, plus they have drink deals, $4 bloodys and mimosas.

She was a little less impressed with The Block Salad which was little more that Arugala, Red Onions, Parmeasan with White Truffle Oil.I had their Muffaletta Sandwich and it was outstanding but it's not a Muffaletta.  A Muffaletta Sandwich originated with the Italian Dock Workers in New Orleans and the word Muffaletta itself refers to a rather thick Scilian Bread.  It's really almost a loaf and very thick. A Muffaletta also has a variety of meats including Mortedella and is finishted off with an Olive Tapenade.This Sandwich which I love has two types of Salami and Serrano Ham and have the profile of a Rueben. It does have a pickled vegetable dressing of which olives may be a component but does not have the distinctive Olive taste to it.I don't care what you call it. It's a great Sandwich and I've a fan but don't call it a Muffaletta.The sandwich can stand on it's own, it's that good."}, {"review_id": "JANc5cCXKROFxVuMH62nBA", "user_id": "bghHHClqFLPeopBcqi_8XA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "Very impressed.  Excellent wine list for location.  Friendly and knowledgeable staff.  Had short ribs- better than expected.  Reasonably priced and cool atmosphere.

Luckily for me, Charleston Restaurant week rolled into town and I was able to finally give this place a go. After a quick over glance of their regular menu, a three course meal for $30 per person is quite a steal! Most of their dinner entrees alone (or \"gran tapas\" as they refer it to) starts at $16 and goes up all the way to $47 dollars. The Block offered two choices each for appetizer, entree, & dessert. Hubby & I thought it would be fun (and the waitress also greatly appreciated us for making things easier on her) to just order each of the choices. Appetizer:*Spinach & mushroom gnocchi with prosciutto in light parmesan cream sauce- Tasty! but I would have liked it if the gnocchi was a bit softer & fluffier. Cream sauce was indeed light but still oozing with flavor. I didn't see or taste any of the prosciutto. Ah well~*Seared jumbo scallops with tomato tartar and wilted arugula- My, my! This was definitely a GREAT start to our meal. The two pieces of scallops was simply not enough! I wanted more! The scallops were cooked perfectly and it paired beautifully with the tomato tartar. Not sure what sauce was on the arugula but it was divine! Our of the two, go with the scallops! Hands down! Entree: *Chicken over grits with caponata salad- Chicken was WAY too tough. My arm got sore trying to cut it into pieces. It would have been better if the grits were a smoother/creamier texture, but it still tasted good. The caponata salad was a bit too tangy for my taste. I didn't think it meshed well with the overall creaminess of the dish. Too much of a contrast. *Pork chop with white bean cassoulet and glazed carrots- Porks chops were also a bit tough, but not as bad as the chicken. The meat was seasoned well and the dark glaze was delicious. The white bean cassoulet was definitely the star of the dish. I hate beans, but this one was amazing! Perfectly creamy without being heavy.Out of the two, go with the pork chops (mostly for the cassoulet).Dessert: *Tres Leches- Not my style. Definitely not the restaurants fault. I just don't like soggy cake.*Blackberry creme brulee- Custard was delicious and the sugar was caramelized to the perfect consistency. Out of the two, go with the creme brulee! Interior:Whenever I passed The Block- I only saw it from the bar side, so I didn't expect the restaurant to be as big as it is. The dining area has an elegant gothy feel with the all-black booth cushions. Me likes. Service:Our waitress was good. She was efficient with service and dropped by our table multiple times throughout our meal to check on us (as did the manager, I believe)."}, {"review_id": "dSpgOkWtu2WspTPoinB4og", "user_id": "BMM52y_Dy09nCw31MaRA5A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2017", "text": "The best steak I've had in a while!!!

However, it's happened so consistently that I had to share my experiences. In the past, I've had issues with my salad missing ingredients and when I asked the server about it, he/she had to check with the cook. It was only then that I am informed they are out of that ingredient. I find it strange that I was not informed of this when ordering or that the staff didn't notice the dish was incomplete. Both times the restaurant couldn't have been more than half full so it's not like the staff were slammed. It felt like they were hoping I wouldn't notice. In another instance, my group ordered the brownie skillet - classic dessert dish. However, it took 40 minutes to arrive, and when it did, the brownie was extremely dry. If there wasn't any ice cream to add some moisture to our rock of a dessert it would have been inedible. Most recently I dined there tonight and while the food was good, a couple of my colleagues had issues. Ones scallop entree was so salty she had to send it back, and another had her appetizer forgotten. I ordered a hot water with lemon and ended up being charged $2 for it. The waitress claimed it fell under the hot tea category. If that's the case, then where was my tea bag? While $2 ultimately is not a lot in the grand scheme of things, on principle it just doesn't make sense to charge for hot water and equate it to a hot tea. It's small things like this that have built up and made me reluctant to dine at The Block again"}, {"review_id": "pe5-pQgKPDaKK9keO2Z9CQ", "user_id": "F5JAmndBjJ_hUXRmaKJecg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/5/2016", "text": "Coming from the great Cleveland food scene, the bar is pretty high for me.

Go for the cocktails and stay for the amazing service!! Visiting town for a wedding and I stumbled upon the Block on Yelp. Upon arrival the atmosphere was great! Nice decor in the bar area and a wine wall in the dining room. We started with some great signature cocktails...sazerac, ginger goose martini, French 75 and a great beer selection. All were very well made really hit the spot. We moved onto the cheese course with a very tasty Gouda, Manchego and Brie. The salads were excellent! Three of the four of us had the goat cheese brûlée which sounded like a lot in reading the description but it was not too sweet and the fig balsamic dressing worked nicely. We shared the salad and were glad we did as the portion was quite large. For dinner, three of us had the short rib which was tender but the sauce was a tad thick. The fourth person had the ciopinno and the fish was a little overdone. For dessert we had the skillet brownie and ice cream which was just enough to share for four. While the drinks were excellent and the meal was quite nice, the experience was really topped off by the AMAZING service from Jeremiah who was attentive and helpful and had the warmest hospitality all evening. He even offered to keep an eye out for our Lyft driver when dinner was over. Shannon, the manager, also stopped by and checked on us which is always a nice touch to complete out a great service experience!

Everything else was 5 stars. The first time I went here, it was great.  My boyfriend and I sat at the bar with the friendly bartender and got delicious drinks. When we went back we sat at a small table by the bar. There was a different bartender (a younger woman with long dark hair), I ordered the exact same drink (strawberry basil gimlet) but it was totally different from the last visit.  It was a very watered down version of the previous one- there was zero basil taste and barely any strawberry.  Kind of annoying but no big deal, sometimes this happens. I told the waiter (he was actually the bartender from our last visit and is a great server) who said he would get me a new one. When he went behind the bar I could clearly hear the bartender ask what was wrong with the drink then made snarky comments about it to our waiter and other customers at the bar.  We were shocked. I rarely send anything back but have NEVER experienced such unprofessionalism. Such a turn off for this place considering we had such a great first experience."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-block-charleston?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
