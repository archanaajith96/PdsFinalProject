The ambiance is very relaxed and chic (if that makes sense). The staff were very polite and nice. I ordered a Turkey burger and fries and a side of the fried jalapenos. The Turkey burger was not soggy at all... very well put together and hot. I love the fact that the fries were hot and seasoned well. The fried jalapeno's did not have too much heat to them they were just right. I want to give a 5 but then also I want to give a 4. The reason for the 4 stars because it took a long time to come out with the food. Which isnt a major issue because the food was very fresh and was seasoned well if you have a bit of time to wait for a lunch break."}, {"review_id": "qYJPz-fAMqNIUdUAPf3asg", "user_id": "2kfq_A6pcX1F_uWYSJM-SA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "I was in a class in downtown Augusta for a month, and I think I ate at Farmhous at least once a week, if not more frequently. I've never really been a huge fan of burgers, being very picky about the juiciness and toppings, but Farmhous is definitely the first place I think of when I want a burger.Everything is locally sourced, which means it's very fresh and delicious. They have specials each month that will make you think you're in heaven (I would beg, borrow, and steal to have the venison burger that was the special the last time I went again).The sides are also super tasty, and the employees are friendly. I sat at the bar most times I visited, and when I just wanted to read and enjoy my meal, the bartender was polite in checking up to make sure everything was as desired, but otherwise left me alone. When I wanted to chat, they were more than willing to talk while not helping other customers.All in all, I have dreams about this place and will miss it dearly when I move."}, {"review_id": "CZwiHCm6V6yUsC_0q20EyA", "user_id": "rDyMtKDY9lxYv5GlxFO8VQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "Now this is the place to get a delicious burger. Everything is locally sourced. There's a variety of items to select from the menu, such as hotdogs to boozy milkshakes. This is a must try when in the Augusta area.

By no means am I even a big burger fan, but Farmhaus is soooo good. The level of customization is astounding--I usually get the egg on top as well. Also, the hype is real: get a boozy shake. These aren't for the faint of heart either--they definitely had a healthy kick to them.Especially since Augusta doesn't have much of a foodie scene, the city should be very happy that it is home to a great gem like Farmhaus.PS. get tots as well!! yum."}, {"review_id": "TGRMEYtJt6LEitqabMDxcQ", "user_id": "zkW3DLrMu2ocUfqfEh27Mw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Came by in a Saturday night around 7pm. Honestly, we weren't downtown for this place, but the other two places had an hour wait! No thanks! So we decided to check out Farmhaus - it was downtown and had burgers which my husband was craving. Check check. PLUS they had a couple open tables. I've been here before, and didn't remember loving my burger. Today I did enjoy my burger ( The Haus Burger #1) but, my husbands was better. He had the burger with the chili. We shared fries and a drink. The total was around 22- Def a bit princely, but the ingredients are fresh and the burgers are good. It's not a weekly thing for us, but I enjoyed it. I've had their boozy milkshakes before and they were good! Though I couldn't finish one on my own. I think that's just me though, I think most people would be fine with their own. We'll be back especially when other places have an hour's wait!"}, {"review_id": "qCOVfVj4HAtNwodc6p-tvw", "user_id": "6Ha14bCSAywmX4ezE1VpcQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "My family and I have been to the Broad St/12th St location twice now.

I don't usually go for burger places when I'm traveling. However, my friend strongly suggested how amazing this place is, so I had to give it a try. I ordered Turkey Burger and Sweet Potato Tater Tots. We got a number stand which we placed it on our table until the food arrived. Oh my goodness! It was one of the most amazing burgers I've ever tasted in my life. Turkey was juicy and well-cooked, and sweet potato tater tots were simply too good! Tater tots were crispy outside and (pretty) hot and soft inside. I LOVED it!! My meal came with a sweet sauce, which went well with both my burger and tater tots. I added bits of Sriracha on my burger and tater tots, and it was super delicious. They have good amount of outdoor sittings, so sit outside on beautiful day and enjoy the food! Farmhaus knows how to make a good burger for sure!"}, {"review_id": "YcP4TcKxHip9TS9tFsRnkg", "user_id": "5HAFGFAnAqRc8sqCk1A8jA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "I wasn't impressed.

Tonight was definitely a good night to visit if you are not a fan of crowded places. There were very few patrons. A total of four including myself and my date. The burger I had was absolutely delicious, very very unique. I found that their grill cheeses are something I would not at all call a grilled cheese because they had meat on it, let's call it a melt please! But then again I am more of a purist. I ordered the Chili Cheese. Very messy, but worth it. I did not have a chance to try one of their boozy shakes but hope to on my next visit. Yes, I shall visit again but this time with someone who doesn't eat before I arrive"}, {"review_id": "8y3ptXWJW7hqGdO4DoXGNQ", "user_id": "Oo2t2ReYnQ6k1pGM2E9eug", "rating": 2.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "When you travel to another town you want to eat where the locals eat. This place was recommended by the visitor center as having a vegan burger that was so good. Well off we went. The place was super crowded!!! Now I'm not much of a complainer when standing in line but the noise was a bit overpowering, in fact it was echoing!Finally got to the front asked about the burgers and the very nice young lady raved about them so I ordered one for me and my bride. We waited and waited and waited. Folks that came in after us got their food before us. Now that rubs me raw! After 45 minutes our vegan burgers show up. They looked good, the bun was amazing! After mt first bit of a cold under cooked vegan burger it fell apart in my hands! Yep I blew up, folks around me knew how i felt about the service and the lousy food!Jackie ate hers because she was hungry and i tried to find someone to talk to me about this meal but to no avail.When i did find a young man who was a server, ours never came back!!! Told him what happened and he was sincere in his apology but I knew it wouldn't go any farther.Will I go back? Oh gracious me never! Why didn't I give it one star? Super cool rest room! Clean and funky.

For around $7 you can make your own burger with free toppings like onions, lettuce, tomato and with fancier toppings such as different kinds of cheese and avocado just to name a few. Add $2 more to that to make it a meal. Their fries came out crispy and salted, and the burgers tasted fresh.
