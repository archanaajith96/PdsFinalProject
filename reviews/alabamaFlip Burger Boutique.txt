My husband and I met another couple here for dinner on a Friday night. We didn't make a reservation, which I STRONGLY encourage you to do! We waited at the bar for a while, and we really enjoyed chatting with the bartender. He was a super nice guy, and he was friendly and professional.By the time we were seated, we were ready to get some appetizers. We ordered fried pickles and onion rings, and they were awesome. We loved the dipping sauces they came with. For my entree, I ordered the bison burger with fries (and shared my husband's sweet potato tots). Everything was super good. My burger was mega-messy, though, and I ended up eating it with a fork and knife. My only taste-critique is that the bison burger didn't really taste like anything special. My burger could have easily been made with Angus beef, and I wouldn't have known the difference. My husband agreed that he didn't think the bison was very impressive.Otherwise, we had an awesome time. The staff was nice, the food was all-in-all really delicious, and I would 100% go here again. Next time I need to save room for a milkshake! I have had the Nutella one here years ago, and I remember being in love."}, {"review_id": "l1UZ4L5VdOt91n-DZj3SlA", "user_id": "rnTrGEA3qKqsyOtglam2TQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Was in town for some errand and decided to try this burger joint and boy it did not disappoint!Granted it's a little on the pricey side, my burger along is about 10 plus 4 something for the sweet tater tot. One of the reasons we went there is because the Nutella shake and I LOVE Nutella, but after seeing the 7.5 price tag I decided I can make my own at home..I had the RBK (I think?) which has the brisket with the patty and it was delicious!!! Hubby has the classic with added egg ($1 extra) bacon ($1.5 oextra) and cheese ($1.5 extra). Come to think of it, mine doesn't come with any cheese... what kind of burger doesn't come with cheese???Having said all that, we left happy and satisfied if you asked our stomach, not so my wallet .."}, {"review_id": "U-9YXuIXBDFD4bB6o07HfQ", "user_id": "kDp2PDUvinZViUBJm1to4Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "I was so excited to go to Flip Burger upon returning to Birmingham! The last time I went was 3 years prior so I was ready for my Flip Fix!! Our waiter was kind, personable, and happy to answer questions. I ordered Angry Orchard (the only cider option) as well as the sweet potato tots with marshmallow cream to start. I was so hungry and I heard these tots were good! They didn't disappoint and I ate nearly the whole cup while they were still piping hot. I got the Royale which included two burger patties, melted cheese, cooked yummy onions, Flip sauce, and I was even able to get a gluten free bun! I also ordered fries, and ended up taking almost the whole cup home because I was too full from my tots and burger! The food is great and tastes the same as it did three years ago, which is awesome. I like when food is consistent like that. I liked that my waiter knew whether things were gluten free or not. The only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating was because: a) the white seating is looking a bit worn and dirty and needing replacement, and b) the young teenage hostess (who was not the same pleasant and friendly one who seated us upon arrival) was constantly on her phone at her post."}, {"review_id": "r0TeT93JMSeV3iQQAup0Ag", "user_id": "utBSeTC2ZT5Gl33G1UiaHw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "This is the place for burgers in Birmingham! All the ingredients are high quality here, and you can tell by the fresh taste. The Alabama burger with pimento cheese and fried green tomatoes was delicious, as were the sweet potato tots. The food came out quick and service was good. I have to knock a star for the price though as $35 for two people with burgers and a single side is a high price regardless of how good the burgers are.

We were served by a very bright and outgoing as well as very cut young lady named Emily. She seemed a bit over qualified for her job so lucky for us or we would've never had the pleasure of meeting this wonderful person. The food was fanominal. The cooks were perfect. The atmosphere was laid back and joyous.  So I highly recommend that, if anyone shopping at the Summit, wants to eat at a great restaurant as well as be served by one of the best in the industry check out Emily at Flip Burger. You will be very pleased you did."}, {"review_id": "u65lcvj_1PhYzdhwpkDBQQ", "user_id": "HANKJzWSq-7jVlDwCk0hXg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Our first time here. Busy Saturday night, adding to the busyness with some HS prom goers chowing down. Big open room, quite loud with people noise and loud music. Many TVs with various sports. Cool ceiling mural. I had a lambburger, one of their signature items. My wife did a build-your-own bison burger. She hates mustard. There was a big dollop of mustard on it in error. Couldn't scrape it off, as it had invaded every nook and cranny of the patty and the bun. So they remade hers. She was happy except I was finished eating when hers came. So I am Yelping while she is eating. My lamb was good but not so good that I'd order it again. Probably get a regular old school burger, or maybe a turkey burger."}, {"review_id": "fxNKFhCLKrdCQabjJq2KyA", "user_id": "fwkwT4NSW4proYOZugUYnQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/4/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "My last visit to Flip was less than stellar and after leaving a review on the food and service, I was reached out to by a manager to give them another chance, so I did.

She checked up on me consistently without protruding on my company and I's personal time. I had the trio sliders and shared onion rings and fries with my company.

They've got the Classic or Stack burgers for those who like a burger with a more traditional vibe, a few options with minor twists for those who want something a little different, or Tartare, Shrimp, Lamb, Chorizo, or Bison for those who are craving something other than the American classic. They also have some fantastic sides to accompany the burgers that are large enough to share. You can't go wrong with the sweet potato tots, classic fries, or onion rings.The milkshakes look amazing, but I'm not the type to want a milkshake with my food. However, when at Flip, I wish I was.The service has been on point each time I visited. Prompt, friendly, and just the right amount of attention.Along with the views, I love the privacy of the floor to ceiling booths."}, {"review_id": "JCU92hSWv2nBIq5Wpn-wLw", "user_id": "WHKs2f9F8MjIi14v4PceUA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "I think I and my family had hands down the greatest night that we've had in a very long time recently and it was kicked off at this upside down hamburger joint called Flip Burger and the most beautiful, bubbly, charming server named Emily.

Ambiance here is nice as well very open space and bright so you can see the food. Staff is friendly and there is usually never a long wait.

We hadn't even planned on eating here until we looked up and decided to see how other Yelpers reviewed the place. The menu selection and creativity in their burgers, in addition to the delicious looking pictures of their milkshakes was too much to consider the Seasons 52 and two other intriguing restaurants within walking distance.I ordered the tuna wonton crisps as an appetizer, nutella milkshake, and a beef tartare burger. I only ordered that particular burger because our waitress said that out of my final 3 selections, this was the one you probably wouldn't find anywhere else. The other finalist was the oaxaca burger. In hindsight, I should have ordered that one, and was being too bold with my choice. It wasn't bad...it just didnt fit my taste palette. It was a very weird texture and taste, but in a way okay. It goes to show you how much I respect and still trust that yhis place overall if superb, even though I didn't order appropriately for my taste buds.The nutella shake was unbelievable and the burnt marshmallow topping was clever. In fact, the presentation of my burger with the fried egg on top was amazing.Cool space, excellent menu and creativity, and amazing, mouthwatering menu items. Unfortunately there are only 3 or so locations, but if they ever open up anywhere convenient to us in Dallas, or if I am ever anywhere on business with one nearby, I will be sure to be back to try the other option burgers and that Krispy Kreme milkshake."}, {"review_id": "31pHmXKriQ-zv7_eCoMLAw", "user_id": "obnisDinrJHoIpKO4Nw3jg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/5/2017", "text": "This place is a very unique concept on burgers.

I have to say the food is great and the service is on point! The only point of downfall is the  stupidity of whoever designed the parking layout of the Summit. I got the Bison burger with the fried egg on top. It is a messy burger, but the gaminess of the burger with the egg and grilled onions were like a symphony!
