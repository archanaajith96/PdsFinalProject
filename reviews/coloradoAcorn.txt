It is located in the RiNo art district. The inside is modern with an industrial interior design.I first dined at Acorn almost three years ago and the food was so exceptionally prepared I remember the exact meal three years later! My most recent trip to Acorn, I ordered wagyu beef tartare, wood oven roasted clams, and the 24 oz bone-in dry age CAB ribeye. I've never had a beef tartare that wasn't served with some sort of bread. This dish came with sunchoke chips and we were told to mix it all together prior to eating. It was a unique twist to the beef tartare, but mixing it with the creme fraiche and egg yolk made the texture almost too creamy when eaten with a complete opposite texture (the crispy sunchoke chips). It made it hard to decipher the different tastes in my palette because all I tasted was creamy and crunchy but almost lost the flavors between the tartare, creme feaiche, and egg yolk. The oven roasted clams were well season and complemented the sun dried tomatoes, saffron, bacon and pine nuts well. The only problem I had with the clams being served on the bread instead of on the side was that they got too soggy after the first couple of bites. I must say this was plated the most beautifully out of all the dishes I ordered here!Last but not least, the 24 oz dry aged ribeye should have been the star of the night, but I found it the most disappointing. We ordered the steak medium rare and it came out rare. It's a minor complaint if I was ordering the steak from Outback Steakhouse, however I expected an upscale restaurant like Acorn to be able to cook such a nice piece of meat properly. At $100 a price tag for the ribeye, I expected perfection. The ribeye came precut, and with two types of salads. The bitter greens with lemon vinaigrette was delicious, but the side salad with the turnips had several that has gone bad and were mixed in the salad, almost ruining the taste of the whole dish. The whole dish was disappointing overall and I would say to pass on the ribeye all together. Overall I gave Acorn 4 stars because of the inconsistencies between visits. Some days the food is prepared spot on, and others have been somewhat disappointing. Acorn still has a place in my heart, but I believe your dining experience will heavily depend on how their seasonal menu changes."}, {"review_id": "nbbavXbPQ5IgyHd72f9EHA", "user_id": "qNeMBnzJc3Kwk8Z39TDZEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "mid day is a weird time to visit any eatery, but I was on a long layover and in search of good eats... and boy did I find them.Acorn is located in the super hipster, trendy part of Denver, in which they are quickly building high rise condos and apartments for those in search of a perfect work/ life balance.  Inside the \"source\" you find local eateries,  florists,  butcher shops,  and artists. So why not set your ass down at Acorn and try some great food and drink right?I had a great local craft,  the Kale salad,  and the meatballs.  The bartender suggested I get a 1/2 salad because the full was enough for a meal by itself.  He was totally right.  The salad was perfection.  I loved how they finely chopped the Kale, and the dressing was delish.  Those meatballs tho...omg. if there was one thing to try here,  get the meatballs.  I kept eating because it was so tasty long after I was full.  Great ambiance,  stellar service,  and food to die for.  Five stars all the way!"}, {"review_id": "nIleRvhaB2OLjUjvPYfufA", "user_id": "BITSY30wombID1ClQUmUwQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/30/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "How the mighty have fallen!!I was with a group of 5; 4 of us were heading to the airport directly after the meal. The last time we were here, da wife and I had lunch and it was some of the best food your boy's ever eaten (see previous review). So all that week, what am I doing? Hyping Acorn up to my 2 friends who've never been there. So we get there and find that they're dinner menu/service/pricing is different than lunch . . They serve all entrees tapas-ish style, meaning they're meant to be shared. The entrees' portion size is somewhere between tapas and family-style, though more close to tapas size. We were a bit surprised but decided to roll with it. Below is what we ordered:Shrimp & Grits (c. $18)DELICIOUS. A bit on the salty side but super creamy and the shrimp had a thickness and mouth chew like an A1 steak. Best dish of the night by far was the general consensus.Roast Chicken with mashed potatoes & Bread Pudding ($39)Very good dish. A good portion of chicken with a side dish bomb mashed potatoes. The bread pudding were like balls of savory, fried dumplings-I liked them a lot. Great comfort food.Bone-in Rib Eye w/ Arugula Salad & Sun chokes ($100)That's right, $100. This is where the meal veered all the way left . . The dish comes out with the steak pre-sliced, which is fine. The sun chokes were excellent; the first time I'd ever heard of let alone eaten them. The arugula salad was simple and fresh but the citrus garlic vinaigrette it was dressed in was insanely good. However, the steak was very rare. We ordered medium. When we brought it to the attention of the manager on-shift named Maggie, she acted as though we were in the wrong and asked what we wanted to do. We said we wanted it sent back. Now let me ask you: When you send a steak back, don't they usually make you another with the correct doneness? That's what we expected. A few minutes later, she came back WITH THE SAME STEAK!! She said the just threw it in the broiler for a few minutes to make it medium. Mind you, this would've been absolutely unacceptable if the steak was uncut. But remember the steak had been cut, which makes it impossible to reheat without losing ALL juiciness and tenderness. Sure enough, it was tough. We complained that this was a reckless way to handle a poorly cooked steak and she comped 50% off the bill. But then she took the steak (which was only 1/2 eaten) back to the kitchen! Why would you take the steak off our table?? What's the hurry? When my one local friend asked for it back not 90 seconds later, Maggie said it was already thrown away. Doubt it. I'm sure she had steak and eggs with some pomme frites the very next morning. So we paid $50 for half a steak that was even cooked right! Maggie needs some extra training on customer service.Hate to say it but we'll never be back. It's too bad, too 'cause I really liked Acorn."}, {"review_id": "dpER67_rH7rVtePOPbrZsA", "user_id": "0TBK4KcAg6Nnskqi32EYYw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "After a few hours of brewery hopping, we stopped by Acorn for a hearty meal on a cold day. Their mid-day menu was pretty short (about 5 entrees), but it made selection much easier. The menu wasn't my total fave -- lots of comfort food with weird hipster flair. Can't say I loved it. My shrimp and grits was good, but certainly not tasty enough to warrant a return. I did appreciate the extensive artisan cocktail menu. Plus the service was top notch. Acorn is located in a co-op-style gallery of other eateries and shops! Pretty cool to walk around and check it out before or after dinner."}, {"review_id": "cuDurRtHB8dNfZWUQm-LCg", "user_id": "ccvBBQRrGd_WDtYVSVoHiA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "We found ourselves at The Source this last weekend, so decided to finally try the much-talked-about Acorn.I'll be honest, we got off to a shaky start. The host seemed preoccupied and abrupt, asking us to wait so he could finish a conversation with a staff member, and then seating us hurriedly. It took over 15 minutes for our drinks to be brought over once our server came to take our order, but our server was running around because she was closing out multiple tables. This was just a really annoying beginning as this is an expensive restaurant, and the customer service did not reflect this. Also, I've been a server and I get it- just take the time to stop by the table and let us know what's going on so we're not just sitting there. We considered leaving once the drinks were brought because spending a lot on lunch when we were already unhappy seemed silly, but decided to stick it out.I will say, I am glad we did. The food was really good. The salmon lunch plate was the perfect size to be filling but light, and my husband's burger was out of this world, complimented by the world's fluffiest tater tots. The service improved once our server was freed up a bit, as well.All in all, the food was great and I am glad that we ate here, but I won't be back. For the price you can get far superior service, and comparable food elsewhere. I will say again, the food was really good- especially the burger- but the experience did not match the price tag for us. Maybe for some people a $100 lunch is no biggie, but for us it was a special treat and honestly it felt a bit wasted when there was anxiety right at the start. Not disappointed that we came here at all, but in no hurry to repeat the experience."}, {"review_id": "PVyHtcwkgHZLU2QkScmVQw", "user_id": "iBhjhnk2klRkru6qGPnu0w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Acorn is located in a former warehouse that houses several restaurants (and maybe a brewery). It is one train stop away from Union Station so not too bad for those coming from downtownWe arrived to Acorn on a Friday night and it was already busy. The ambiance is very trendy and urban with the majority of the base being young, nicely dressed millennials. The menu is simple, yet speaks for itself. I suggest ordering 3-4 shared plates if you're a party of two Ordered - Wagyu Beef Tartare (5/5). Excellent. The dish has raw beef, with jalapeno, mushrooms, egg yolk, and chips. The key is to stir well and get all the ingredients mixed and ready. Be warned - the beef will literally melt in the mouth with full goodness. It is one of the best tartare dishes I've had - Duck Confit (4/5). I enjoyed it overall. The duck was tender and juicy, though I was not feeling the turnips. The texture was difficult to get used to and I think more herbs (or mushrooms) may make it taste better - Pork Belly (5/5). Yummy! Premium pork belly at its finest. Three pieces of heaven with a perfect balance of crispy skin and fat. The garnish is also a game changer and provides the veggies for the day - Tomato Braised Meatballs (3.5/5). Ehh. It was alright. The meatballs were fine and of quality. The only remark is the ratio of cheese to meatballs is off balance. There were only three meatballs which it is a bit cheap. The sauce is also too saucy Good stuff overall. I enjoyed Acorn and it is a nice introduction to the food scene in Denver. We sat near in the bar area with full coverage of the grill and chefs cooking so it was a win to see all the action"}, {"review_id": "IXflK5yLqngU_RoOCKQK2g", "user_id": "XwGAPzNEqgQlnv57Nb8RcA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "This was exceptional!!

The Source building is a little out of the way but not far. Apparently the building was once a foundry used in steel industry in Denver which has been renovated and retrofitted to create a unique artisanal collection of restaurants, market, etc. Once getting to The Source, Acorn is just inside and on the right. The space is intimate and creative with an great exposed brick wall with graffiti street art. Their bar is fantastic. Great beer and wine list but more impressive is their truly original cocktails that are skillfully crafted and taste amazing. They are known more for Tapas share plate style with ~2-3 dishes per person in the group being a perfect amount. Definitely recommend the Kale Apple salad, wood fired clams, pimento cheese, and Icelandic cod.

I know it was voted one of the top restaurants in Denver, but there are definitely better ones around and better ones that don't require a drive down a deserted roadway still under construction. We ordered pretty much everything off the menu and it was all a little too oily, too salty, or the flavors were just all over the place. There was way too much fat in a lot of the dishes and I'm not one to shy away from butter, but when you see the fat and oil floating and congealing as the dish cools down is a bit unappetizing. Another piece of advice... don't order the desserts. We ordered the pumpkin mousse and chocolate custard and the table next to us ordered all three and both of our tables could not eat more than a few bites to taste. The pumpkin mousse looked like a deconstructed mess and there was very odd pumpkin shavings that belonged more in a stir fry than a dessert. The chocolate custard was so meh that we didn't even both to eat any of the custard and only ate the whipped cream and blackberries."}, {"review_id": "g-DZp03iY0GmdqkmxtniRg", "user_id": "-1F3_s7VVphcJJWjE6RUIQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "I usually don't feel obligated to write a review unless I have an extremely spectacular or mortifying experience.

Food was pricey, but nothing to rave about. Restaurant gives off swanky hipster-ish vibe which may command a certain amount of appeal, but the food is not memorable. I'm giving this place a solid 3 for a number of reasons. It was a bit of a struggle getting to the Source from the light rail station (38th and Blake). There's a lot of construction going on in the area and the walk is not exactly a walk in the park...yet. Best way to get here seems to be driving. Maybe in the future this won't be such a drawback. Buuut, on the plus side, for a Friday night we were surprisingly seated right away. Service was as I would expect from a swanky place (so very good), though it took a while to get our order placed. Our food came out within minutes of ordering, so that is an impressive testament to the efficient operations of an upscale restaurant. My beef with Acorn isn't really about the service or the location, though. It's the food and whether it warrants the steep price tags. We ordered 5 plates: the curry pretzel, fried pickles, hamachi, beet salad, and the wagyu beef tartare toast. Overall, I wasn't blown away by any of the dishes--the hamachi was probably the best dish we ordered and even that was nothing to write home about. But the wagyu beef toast was probably the worst offender of the night for my stomach, because the beef was really really salty! And it was served on such a thick piece of toast, I felt like I was tasting more of the bread than the actual prized meat. Not a fan, but to each their own. At the end of the meal, I was kind of disappointed that we had to spend so much money to get some okay food, not to mention the inconvenient walk to get there. The price range on Yelp is $$, but this is inaccurate if you plan on actually eating a substantial meal and getting drinks. Plan on spending about $30+/person."}, {"review_id": "u3hA99z_ypAJol2j3hvtGQ", "user_id": "LRgGFFhWOc1PlNKKeTGKgQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Few meals are life changing, but this was one of them.

A friend and I split the half chicken dinner, beef tartare, and some veg sides, all of which were delicious. Service was on point the whole night, solidifying Acorn as one of those really cool places in the city that you'd want to take your in-law's parents if you wanted to impress them. The restaurant has dim lighting, but it doesn't feel pretentious. It's a good place to have a real conversation with your meal.This is certainly not an everyday place that someone can eat, and I think that the $$ is really a stretch here. This is a $$$ place with a lot of small plates that add up quickly. It's totally worth going to, but prepare yourself for sticker shock if you're expecting a typical $$ place.
