Crispy. My heartburn would hate me for eating an entire order.And, it's kinda weird, but we all agreed that this place had THE BEST Caesar salad we've ever had, no arguments. I had a small one initially, just to eat something green that day, and it was so good, that we all decided to share a full one, lol.Not that the etouffee was bad, it wasn't IN THE LEAST, but I could have bungled on the Caesar salad and the beignets, and been a happy camper.Note: This place is tucked away in some corporate buildings, too, a little hidden!"}, {"review_id": "VUoEhDWM2WSomizmGLlzxg", "user_id": "4Bmxx88iA4qPlzMaOYmuVQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I was disappointed with this place, especially given the review on here. They were out of the things we ordered, including their special and the free shooter given through the yelp check in, but didn't tell us about either. The wait staff was also very inattentive (even though we were sitting right by the front desk), and unpleasant.

My sister ordered the shrimp and grits.  Now I've had the shrimp and grits here before and no joke, it's a party in your mouth.  The reason why I didn't order it this time around is because I wanted to venture out and try other menu items, plus I knew she was gonna order it and I'd be able to sneak in a bite or two or three.  The shrimp and grits are like no other that I've had before and quite frankly, nothing compares.  There's so much flavor in every bite.  I'd probably get two orders of it the next time around just because IT'S THAT FREAKING GOOD!"}, {"review_id": "mtK7qomzVWx0vT40QUpH2A", "user_id": "kTZM0eQwSi4GnOLNX78eaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "There's a reason why this place has 1700+ reviews and is averaging almost 5 stars.

Which she does not. But can you imagine if she did? OMG what an absolute dream.Anywho. Back to the food.Here's what I've tried so far: * Jalapeño corn bread - deliciously corn-bready, with jalapeño bits and just a hint of that jalapeño flavor* Beans & rice - the flavors in this little cup was just superb. Large sized beans, perfectly cooked rice.  Don't forget to savor that piece of sausage delicately laid atop of that cup of goodness, because it just tastes so good with them beans and rice.* Shrimp and grits - hearty and flavorful, grits are perfection (and ironically, not gritty at all), shrimp size and portion was plentiful and generous, A++ would order again* Taste of Etouffee - this seems like a seafood lovers top choice. Includes the Crawfish Etouffee and rice, and I opted for the fried catfish which was absolutely phenomenal.  It had a drizzle of house-made Tartar sauce, which was tasty AF.* Sweet tea-suuuuuuper sweet. Pairs well with their food.Tips:* lots of parking* indoor and outdoor seating available* takes reservations100% we will be back.

San Diego traffic is CRAZY!Inside is decorated with hints of Louisiana here and there. You can instantly smell the kitchen when you open the door. Boo-yah indeed.The menu here has a nice selection of all your favorite Cajun favorites including the classic Po Boy. We just missed the breakfast version which looked interestingly good. It even had Cajun style Breakfast Burritos on it. Must try one next time.We ordered off the lunch menu and started with the Fried Pickles and Grilled Alligator Sausage Appetizer. It came with a homemade jalapeno tartar sauce and some spicy Dijon mustard. We both thoroughly enjoyed it.My wife decided on the Crawfish Etouffee plate and yours truly ordered some Soft Shell Crabs with Etouffee covered Rice. Decided to get a side of the Jambalaya seasoned Potato Salad as well.The food was extremely delicious and we were both impressed with the portion sizes and the reasonable prices. Everything was freshly made and it had some really nice southern flavors.Service was excellent and very friendly. Growing up in the Houston area I was asking several questions about the recipes and some of the product they were getting from Louisiana. Our server was telling us about the owner and how they were originally from down south. He even hooked me up with a package of authentic Boudin Sausage to take back home.Definitely recommend this place with all my heart. They do a great job of treating the customer right and cooking up some incredibly delicious food.

The first time I came here, I was seated outside where the decor on the patio was very quaint with charming lights. I ordered the jambalaya and friend order the gumbo with a side salad. I think the place is pricey for the casual style food they served. In the addition, the taste was average, but not a wow jambalaya dish.I did try this place again for lunch, wishing they had a lunch menu. The items were too large and heavy to eat during lunch time. The pricing was the same as well, which a bit too much to pay for lunch.

We got quickly seated and helped out by our server Wesley. He was very friendly and kind. Check-in on yelp for a free oyster shooter. My brother loved the oyster shooter! We will probably get some next time when we come back. For lunch I got the Shrimp and Grits and he got the Crawfish Étouffée. Both dishes were under $18 and their portions were huge! The food came out quickly and we were so pleased with our meals. The shrimp and grits were creamy and extremely well seasoned. I was afraid the dish would be too filling, however it was just right. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and the sauce complimented the dish well. The crawfish etouffee was flavorful and also very well seasoned. My brother practically licked his plate clean. Both entrees were so great, I'd highly recommend them! To finish off our meal, we got an order of beignets! They were light, fluffy, and great!

Its location is a bit odd being off Balboa Ave and Ruffin Rd on the edge of an industrial park. Parking is not an issue at all, just pull into the adjacent lot north of the restaurant before you reach the corner of Viewridge Ave and Ridgehaven Ct. The menu prices are very reasonable (e.g. no entree more than $20) for creole and cajun cuisine which happens to be one of my favorite styles of cooking.Most of our group ordered the same item, A Taste of New Orleans, which was a crawfish etoufee with a different side accompaniment. My side was a fried soft shell crab. I also selected a cup of cajun jamabalaya as an appetizer. The server was very prompt and attentive to our table, and the food came out pretty quickly.

He made recommendations, he was patient, and brought us French bread when I asked. I then asked if there were loaves for sale at the front, but he did they were all cut.

It's like a gem you find in the dark, there is not much around this place and you might question yourself as to where you are heading to in the dark. But Oh man you're lucky if you find this place.I was here for Valentine's day dinner and I don't think there can be a more perfect spot for the occasion.Food: We got the Shrimp Bourbon street for appetizer, it was perfectly seasoned and the side of orange marmalade sauce was the right pairing with this.For Main-course we got the Pasta Mardi Gras which was exceptionally yummy, creamy yet not filled with cheese, tomato base sauce yet not very sour, good balance between cream and sour. We also got the Chicken+Grits, It was amazing too. I liked the sauce the chicken was cooked in and the Grits, Man we could have seconds, it was so creamy and smooth.For dessert they had a valentine's special dessert, a chocolate decadent - flourless dark chocolate cake with white chocolate, vanilla and strawberry sauce on the side. This thing was sinful. Service: I do not remember the name of my server but he was a very polite and attentive man. He came up to us occasionally and asked if we needed something else and he was the one who suggested the special dessert. Great guy.Ambiance: Nice and cozy, nothing too fancy. They also had outdoor seating with pillar heaters. In-all: I am sure you know by now that I am super happy with this place. Will go back here as soon as I will be able to. Wish I could go back again today. Ya it's that good.Recommendation: I would totally recommend trying this place. You will not be disappointed.
