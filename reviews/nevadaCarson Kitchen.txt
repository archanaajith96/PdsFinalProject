The neighbor a doughnut shop jumped out at us with a large sign.We were seated immediately. Our arrival was mid way between lunch and dinner and there were several available tables. Our server promptly provided water and our cocktails. Initially the noise level was loud due to a table of six people. Once they received their food the talk level declined. Our server explained the menu and advised the food would come out as it is ready.We ordered the followingKiller ShrimpSecret Sunday ChickenThe Shrimp came out first. Very taste and crunchy the pepper creme and sliced jalapenos added some nice heat. A very enjoyable dish. The chicken was ordered without the bun because we heard that it's a large breast. Right on it was large. The fried chicken was the best crunchy breast ever. Delicious!  Our table was in full view of the open kitchen and we could see them repeatedly check the chicken with a thermometer to insure it was cooked just right. The chicken comes with tater tots that are deep fried grated potato balls. They were crispy outside & soft inside. Goes well with the aioli or ketchup.The wait time for the chicken was exceedingly long. At one point our sever brought over a complementary order of baked mac & cheese and apologized for the delay. Don't know what happened to cause the delay but when the check arrived there was no charge for the chicken. I questioned our server and she stated the chicken  was complementary due to the long wait. I was not expecting that response.The baked mac & cheese is a large portion that easily feeds 2 people. I tried the mac & cheese but not being a fan I can only say it was tasty and filling..One improvement I would like to see is padded seat cushions. Wood chairs become uncomfortable after a while."}, {"review_id": "jtNeptSqY_q2wqgPhI0-lA", "user_id": "Lngygc5fUOfXXNwaQ5Y2MA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "We stopped in here for some tapas. This place had a very trendy atmosphere, very social gathering inspired. The wait staff was wonderful. Each food item was delivered and a description given, by different staff members. It was impressive how consistent their food delivery presentation was from server to server.    This place has something going for them, innovative tapas. The menu is a social or sharing menu, meaning you order several items and share them amongst your group.    We ordered a bunch of items, Bacon Jam, fried chicken skin, gyro tacos, charred octopus, and kicking shrimp. All of our food was very good and interesting in concept. The Kicking shrimp was exceptional, one of my faves.   We also order the donut dessert, which was out of this world. It is worth a visit just for this dessert.    All in all, this is a great spot with some creative takes on tapas, worth a visit."}, {"review_id": "johKctwn7ePERiQCJ_kmSg", "user_id": "5qBTq4XLs-3ch4AxRXXNmg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Absolutely loved this place! The inside was very small but in a cozy feeling and not over crowded! I was seated at the bar which I loved because I got to see straight into the kitchen and watch the chefs prepare the food. Overall the atmosphere was like a young, hipster, upbeat vibe. It was spaced out very all and had a nice aesthetic to the place! The waitress told me that these meals are supposed to be sharing dishes, which created a fun atmosphere! We ordered the meat pizza (forgot the exact name) with the risotto which both were to die for! The food was prepared quick and all prepare fresh made. The service was great as well. The waitress was very friendly and helped answers all questions since this was my first time going!

Carson Kitchen is definitely a top 5 meal. I came here for Nikki B.'s wedding reception. We occupied the outdoor private patio for the evening. It was nice that it had a separate bar and our servers tried to make it as comfortable as possible for us with blankets and patio heaters for the unseasonably windy/chilly Spring evening. But, let's get down to business - everything was so dang good. There was seriously not a mediocre dish on the menu. The wonderfully curated menu is also a product of Nikki B's fantastic tastebuds, so shout out to the bride as well! *Crispy Chicken Skins (smoked honey): The chicken skins were beautifully crispy and delicious without being oily. The touch of sweetness from the smoked honey was perfect. *Bacon Jam (baked brie, toasted baguette): Definitely burned my tongue on this dish because I was being hasty and I wanted to try it ASAP. Delicious combination with the sweet and savory bacon jam and creamy  baked brie. *Tempura Green Beans (pepper jelly cream cheese): The pepper jelly cream cheese reminded the table of pimento! Yum. The green beans were perfectly battered and fried. *Wild Mushroom Flatbread (basil pistou): I love me some mushroom and I love me some flatbread. I really enjoyed the pickled red onion on this. Helped to add some zing. *Rainbow Cauliflower (garlic, lemon): Definitely leaned tangy from the lemon, but I enjoyed the palate cleanse. *New York Strip (cocoa-espresso, red wine demi): PERFECTLY cooked. It was so tender that I didn't even need a steak knife to cut it. Also, cocoa-espresso is some next level Food Network stuff -- meaning I'm too lazy to make it myself at home, but I see it on the time on TV. & now that I have finally tried this combo, I feel like I can't go back to plain ol' salt & pepper! *Chicken Thighs (mint chimichurri): Very tender! I also loved it with chimichurri. I don't think I've had the combo of chicken & chimichurri before. *Black Rice Risotto: Yum! Great foundation for all the great protein we had. There were 3 addt'l dessert items, but we were all so full that the delicious wedding cake was enough. WHEW, it was a food marathon and we were champs.

I guess I didn't realize that this was like a secret place. After driving down 6th St. looking for some signage we decided to just park it and walk. Thankfully the dude at the Doughnut Bar told us it was right next door. No signs, nada. You walk into a modern design restaurant with a separate bar area from the main dining room. Not a big place at all, very intimate. You can see the kitchen, and all the action taking place which I love. We weren't greeted all that warmly and had a short wait then were shown our seats. We sat at a community table, which isn't my preferred dining style. Fortunately we had a corner which allowed a little more privacy. The couple that sat next to us disliked the seating options even less than we did. With limited space, it's necessary in a restaurant like this. Our server was nice, but didn't offer up a ton of suggestions after we told her it was our first time here. So winging it we decided to order the veal meatballs and the bacon jam to kick things off. Our apps were solid. The veal meatballs had a little gaminess to them and the cream sauce was really tasty with a hint of heat. The bacon jam was a solid app, definitely got more than we expected. It could have used some more brie though. You get plenty of bread to dip, the jam itself was really good, sweet & savory. It's served in a cast iron skillet which is a great touch.For our entree we decided to share the Short Rib grilled cheese. It was good, but didn't blow my mind. Short rib was tender, Gouda was a good combo, but it just didn't knock my socks off which I was expecting. I'd probably try something else next time.The dessert we ordered was outstanding. We went with the Bourbon Fudge Brownie which is a brownie (no nuts!!) that has a fudge layer on top, gooey brownie underneath and is served with the most amazing butter bacon ice cream to compliment this concoction. It just works. It works so well. Definitely the highlight of the meal for me. We left Carson Kitchen stuffed and happy. Definitely will give it another go down the road when Grandma decides to offer up another opportunity for a day date."}, {"review_id": "Da87r9vBAZiypUxUS5u3xg", "user_id": "fxrQSMhHlBv6eJVRdchG9Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The food is incredible!

It comes with toasted baguette and this delicious bacon savory spread with Brie cheese. So good.Baked Mac and cheese ($13): another sharable side. The truffle flavor wasn't as strong as in other Mac and cheeses I have had, and the serving size was a bit on the small side. It was very good with the bacon jam on top though.Gyro tacos ($12): would probably skip this next time. They had a nice Greek flavor to them with lamb, tzatziki, and feta, but didn't wow me.I also got the butter burger ($14), which was a pretty filling burger. I liked that they came with tator tots, which was a nice change from the usual fries.Their desserts looked super tasty as well, but we were too full to try them.

From the street, it didn't appear as though the restaurant was open, so I called and confirmed that they were open. Once inside, we were promptly greeted by the hostess and seated. Our table for two looked like it belonged in a tiny house. Instead of adult chairs, we had little stools. As a curvaceous woman, I was like what kind of nonsense is this?! But I digress. Just know that there's no back support for the seats.Our server was very attentive and accommodating. I wish I knew her name.Right now, I'm refraining from eating meat, so coming here may not have been the best idea. Most of their vegetarian dishes are merely side dishes. Here's what we tried: Baked Mac & Cheese, Rainbow Cauliflower, and a Wild Mushroom Flatbread. The mac was the best dish of the night, the cauliflower was WAY too lemony, and the flatbread was just okay. The portions were small just like the little chair I was seated on. Even the prices seemed a bit inflated and we were not in a high rent area. Plus, it didn't look like much money went into the decor either.Ugh, I hate to be that one, but I wasn't blown away.

Other than bacon and Brie, I'm not sure what else is in it but it taste like a bit of heaven to me. Comes with several slices of toasted baguette so you can slather on that heavenly goodness.Gyro tacos: topped with feta cheese and diced tomatoes. Wasn't a huge fan of this one. It just tasted kind of blah. Grilled cheese short rib: perfectly cooked. Short rib was tender and tasted excellent with the cheese. Bread had a nice crunch to it without being too hard. Comes with a side of spicy tator tots. These tots are seriously the most delicious tots I've ever had. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I'm in love with them.

Caramel and rum covers a light fluffy donut.  Just enough to share with the table and get a few bites to satisfy you.  We liked it so much we nearly licked the bowl clean!  The Bourbon Fudge Brownie was outstanding!  Super rich dense chocolate flavor topped with ice cream and bacon bits.  Out of this world.   The desserts were by far the stars of our dining experience.  The check arrived along

poised for expansion, location number two set for Cory Harrwell's home state of Georgia, it was along with familiar dining companions that lunch was enjoyed at Downtown Las Vegas' most important Restaurant, a baker's dozen new or reprised plates representing one of the biggest  menu changes to date.For once catching the full team on-site, Cory and Matthew Harwell covering both the pass and floor while Scott Simon headed up the kitchen, it was just prior to noon that a low table in front of the chef's counter was occupied, beverages filled quickly by a young woman wearing a Slayer T-shirt before Matthew presented the cleverly titled \"Communication Breakdown\" so-called for its international blend of Spirits that come across as crisp and unexpected as Led Zeppelin's 1969 track of the same name.Holding onto classics like the Rainbow Cauliflower, Bacon Jam and Chicken Skins, many rarely or never offered on a Las Vegas Menu prior to Kerry Simon and Cory's downtown debut, Spring 2018 once again sees the staff at 124 South 6th Street putting novel ingredients in a more accessible context by way of Trout Rillette mixed with Mustard Seeds and Pistou intended to be spread atop bread while two types of Peruvian Peppers form the base of a vibrant Cream Sauce that gives Killer Shrimp v2.0 a texture not unlike Chinese Walnut Shrimp but with a whole lot more complexity.Unafraid of bold flavors, the idea of umami not lost on Carson Kitchen's plates but a degree of refinement preventing dishes from being one-note like so many other American \"Gastro-Pubs,\" it was  once again embracing foreign spices that a dish titled Charred Octopus saw the team place tender Tentacles atop Potatoes like the Spanish before adding spreadable Italian Salami, a twist of Lime available to those looking to brighten things up though the better bet would seem to be pairing the dish to either the minty Strawberry & Cucumber Salad or \"Broccoli Crunch\" that features creamy Green Goddess Dressing marrying the Crucifer to toasted Seeds and dried Cranberries.Taking on Tiki Drinks for Spring's only other new Cocktail, Matt's fondness for Velvet Falernum paying off with the fruity Tricky Vic that could easily see guests stumbling out the doors given its light drinking despite a lot of Alcohol, those looking for a good Vegetarian entree would do well to consider the seasonally inspired Wild Mushroom Flatbread while Omnivores will once again find 'Nduja on the Calabrian Flatbread that looks a lot like typical Pepperoni Pizza but tastes more like \"Meat Lovers\" with extra Cheese and Peppers.Rarely impressed by Salmon, the fact that Fish at Carson Kitchen usually performs well as a result of good ingredients presented simply notwithstanding, it was alongside local Beer that the crispy skinned Filet was presented and filled its role as a Pescetarian/Soccer Mom staple, though those looking for something a bit less \"safe\" would be wise to invest in golden-brown Chicken Thighs served with Mint Chimichurri or a $20 Pork Chop that is big enough to share...or perhaps not considering just how well the juicy grilled Meat goes along with a topping of Rhubarb Chutney and base of Apple Mostarda.Rounding out savories with another riff on a famous Fast Food Sandwich, the Mmm' Rib tangy and tasty despite its context being lost on diners who have not tasted the original in over two decades, it was only after finishing off an order of Cory's famous Macaroni and Cheese plus briny Spring Asparagus that Dessert was presented, the Banoffee once again in hibernation while Donut Bread Pudding  and the Bourbon Fudge Brownie are joined by smooth Panna Cotta topped in Granola and housemade Rhubarb Jam cooked down with Riesling.***** While it is true that other Las Vegas concepts have managed to expand outside of Nevada there remains something special about Carson Kitchen's place in the community that makes Cory's success particularly important, Spring 2018 once again showing no signs of declining creativity or interest in changing a successful formula that has seen many imitators but none nearly as good."}],
