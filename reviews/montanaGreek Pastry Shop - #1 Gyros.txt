We needed something quick, near downtown, and delicious and this place delivered on all fronts. Went with my family and we all ordered gyros and a side of their battered fries. One side of fries can easily be shared. Super tasty! They are not shy with the tzatziki sauce, so maybe get in the side if you like it lighter. Service was super Montana friendly. They seem to have a great crew. Even though the inside is small- they have a cute outdoor patio with picnic tables."}, {"review_id": "4l-qwbVJep_h5kYsLw31_A", "user_id": "qjJw3Lh53-o0DrCokrzPyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "The most delicious place in Missoula to eat!

The wrap tasted good overall but either my chicken was a part of fight club or the chef had just gotten back from a camping trip, because I found a small wood chip inside one of the chicken pieces. The fries are good if you're a fan of tzatziki sauce with a strong punch of garlic. I'm going to give this place the benefit of the doubt and assume their chickens aren't always lumberjacks. I'd recommend this places if you're looking for a decent fix of Greek food."}, {"review_id": "at1s88OBj5A4gYw4kLyJjg", "user_id": "akF6KoNRZaJe_GCFyF1d4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/10/2017", "text": "I was highly impressed with the taste and quality of the food here.

I was not expecting much based on the small building and location, but don't judge a book by its cover. The food is excellent. The staff is attentive and friendly. The seating and dining area is cramped, and can feel a bit overcrowded at times, but the food is well worth it.

This has created a gold-standard for me which has been a double-edged sword. I compare all Gyros to these and I honestly believe that these are the best and anything else that doesn't meet this standard, doesn't get a good review. What I love about these Gyros:-The vinaigrette-The generous amount of feta-The onionI love the fries and the baklava too. There is no comparison. The only thing I don't like about it here is that they aren't open on Sunday and I'm always here on Sunday now that I don't live in Missoula. But these are still the best Gyros in town and in Montana!!"}, {"review_id": "UK9HC2EVKOYp0sib8H1-PA", "user_id": "jKxRiUxH665TjdTPt1KOdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2017", "text": "This is a great little Greek restaurant.

The meat is both crispy *and* juicy (often you get one or the other), the tzatziki sauce is perfect (not too tangy or yogurty) the bread to die for and the people are so kind and friendly. Make sure to also have a piece of baklava :)"}, {"review_id": "-3WzsEZ_5HdXRHKhCjSY3g", "user_id": "RkcJMDEPtmSdDC07w6_V9g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/11/2016", "text": "An unexpected surprise in... Missoula??As an East Coast food snob, I was certainly not expecting to find really good ethnic food (of any kind) on my first real trip to Montana.The shop isn't much to speak of. Small, a little crowded. The staff is very helpful and pleasant. There was a pretty good line at lunch on a weekday. That speaks volumes!The prices are fantastic. Very inexpensive, though probably perfect for the location.On to the food! The Gyros were spot on. They are roasting the meat right in front of you, and it's delicious. Also, they make a very good baclava. Perfect.5 big sky stars!!!"}, {"review_id": "jJuRoHrHobYqVFXW740IMg", "user_id": "o44OT39VcwiqKt8avk-RGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2017", "text": "Really love this restaurant.  The Greek fries are amazing and the staff is friendly.  The prices really can't be beat.  Nice to have a Greek place is a small town.  Parking can be A little challenging but a little stroll in Missoula never hurt anyone."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/greek-pastry-shop-1-gyros-missoula?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
