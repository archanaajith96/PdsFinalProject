I have what I like burned into my buds and when other flavors come in it can upset me. Everyone else says it's just me so I say try it. The E 2 faye is what I go for almost every time.  Never gets old, always fresh. Then of course there is the Shrimp Buster. At least every 3rd trip involves me getting 1 of these. I think back in the early 2Ks it was every time, with an occasional cup of gumbo to wash it down.The decor might make you think it has been there for 100 years, but I think it just hit 80. Mostly Louisiana with some clues about worldly travels can be found. Be prepared for a wait.

Despite the suggestion from my hotel to go the the \"other\" popular restaurant I see popping up on Yelp reviews for Shreveport, I opted to visit this spectacular \"hidden gem' some other Yelpers wrote about. The restaurant was cute, especially the patio on the side. Staff was extremely personable - service was good. But Unfortunately the food fell way short! I got the Thursday special - a shrimp poboy and the seafood gumbo.  The gumbo was cold, tasteless (no creole seasonings) and honestly tasted like it had been sitting for while in dirty water. Two bites in and I couldnt bring myself to eat any more. My poboy, also disappointly bland! It was two huge butterflied shrimp on bread. No seasonings, no nothing. Just the shrimp on the bread! After three bites of that, I kindly declined when my waitress asked to wrap it up for me, paid, left, and went to another restaurant for lunch.I'm not certain what all the 5 star yelpers ordered, but I was so disappointed with my selections."}, {"review_id": "zrifLU4wThiO5iV_cLoC4g", "user_id": "9LUuvv16dO3OGmVY9sQStg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "I'm not really sure how this place has so many good reviews!  We came here while we were in town bc of all the good reviews and bc we wanted some good cajun food. We were disappointed to say the least.  We ordered the ettouffe/gumbo combo and their \"world famous\" shrimp buster.  The ettouffe/gumbo combo had way more rice than anything else.  The shrimp platter was nothing more than flattened and butterflied shrimp in batter, on top of a slice of french bread, with cole slaw and fries. I felt like the shrimp had more than double the batter than shrimp.  And there was nothing special about the sauce. If you're looking for good cajun food in the area, I would probably try something else.  I'm still confused about all the good reviews."}, {"review_id": "AwYn1TyOEqIqx_8m2cC4ow", "user_id": "GwM8M0XCV_Lmx3vWPGSDug", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Sometimes you don't find the hidden gems, they find you.Whilst driving through the Southland en route to Birmingham, AL, we found ourselves in Shreveport, LA and decided to stop for some soul food.Full disclosure, the spot that caught our attention on Yelp was actually The Blind Tiger. It seemed to be large enough that we'd be assured a table immediately which was imperative as we are almost always on a tight schedule. However, we had overlooked one small detail. It happened to be St Patrick's Day, the booziest of all fake holidays. Shreveport was turnt and so was The Blind Tiger. So off we went to our second choice, which turned out to be a very fortuitous turn of events indeed.Nestled in the heart of what appears to be some kind of no man's land, Herby K's might be the vibiest little hole in the wall of all time.The staff were awesome. We drank local beer out of ridiculously heavy goblets. The food was fried and salty.

Have you ever ate food so bad you get more upset every time you think about it?  Well if you would like that experience for yourself this is your restaurant!  Yelp is normally on target but this place...  Yelpers got this one all wrong! The seafood gumbo was literally the worst I have ever had!  It was served lukewarm for starters.  The roux tasted like dirty dishwater and the so called shrimp are the tiny little ones you would find in a cup of ramen soup.  Couple that with NO FLAVOR at all and you have a dish destined for the bayou by way of plumbing !The crawfish ettoufee was bland cold and gross.  The look of the roux reminded me of baby apple sauce.  Which is honestly an insult to the apple sauce. The same ramen soup shrimp and overcooked rice as the gumbo.  Disgusting!  A pure disgrace to a region known for its seafood dishes.  Try any frozen  brand at Walmart.  I guarantee you will be better off.The shrimp buster!!  In one word Horrid!  A beat up butterflied shrimp fried in a batter with a rain runoff water base.  Captain D's is literally light years better!  The catfish and fried pickles were both decent.  They were literally the only edible things I ordered.  I don't know how this place has stayed open since 1936.

We drove through a couple blocks of vacant and run down buildings that looked like they haven't been touched since the 50's, but then you turn the corner there is Herby-K's with a line out the door. We were able to snag two seats at the bar in front of the pass through window to the patio. Seeing all those delicious plates of food go by definitely built up my appetite. We started with a Red River Hey Ryde ($6) which is a wheat beer and served in a huge frosted mug. Then we had the Shrimp Buster with onion rings ($12.95 + $1 for the onion rings) and the small Crawfish Etouffee ($8.95). The shrimp buster came highly recommended, and it was good, but its just flattened butterfly shrimp over toasted bread. The batter on the shrimp was great but I would have liked some veggies on the po boy to give it some crunch. Now those onion rings is where its at. A nice thick and flavorful batter and you could easily bite through the onion without pulling it out of the batter or needing a knife. Hands down best onion ring I've ever had! The crawfish etouffee had a ton of crawfish in it and that roux was bursting with flavor. The small is still a pretty good sized portion too.My only disappointment was that I didn't know they had bread pudding (my personal favorite) and didn't save room to try it.

I ordered the half shrimp and oyster po boy with the onion ring option for an extra $1. And this is where the real disappointment registered. Their was one piece of leaf lettuce and one tomato slice, 2 shrimp butterflied and pounded paper thin, a couple smallish fried oysters, a dollop of mayo, all on a toasted white bun. The shrimp were so thin that the breading was all I tasted. Compared to the fried oysters I had at John's Seafood on Jewella for lunch, these were half that size. And not as tasty. The most memorable impression, aside from only 3 coolish onion rings, was how very dry the sandwich was.
