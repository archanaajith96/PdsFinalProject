We found this on yelp, and due to reviews gave it a try. My wife had the lamb gyro, and I had rosemary garlic gyro. We both had the side salad, and a drink. Let me start off by saying the service was great. Friendly staff and lots of smiles. The food was great and well worth the moderate price."}, {"review_id": "4jcVwJhNAa441shavF4KgA", "user_id": "do0Bh_KWYUWQnckn32pdpA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "I loved when they had their food truck in front. Their gyros were delicious and fresh, albeit a bit heavy-handed on the spice they add at the end. I'm not sure what happened when they built their brick and mortar location. But when we recently ate there as a family of three, we were all a bit disappointed. My husband had the gyro plate, while my daughter and I ordered the lamb gyro combos (lamb gyro, fries and drink). The chunks of onion were overpowering, and the feta and sauce they add is a scant amount.The fries also have too much seasoning."}, {"review_id": "nmdDlOCUSUfike-3Kx6mIg", "user_id": "h4W1fFr35s4z5KAEwgs75g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/4/2017", "text": "We really enjoyed our stop here!  My husband and I split the chicken platter.  It was a ton of food and easily filled us both us.  I especially loved the greek salad that came with it and the chicken was moist and tender.  My son ordered the beef pita and he also loved it.  Service was excellent and the staff was very friendly.  I would definitely stop again if I were in the area."}, {"review_id": "EhVsO4RdYVk11ncYobGjrA", "user_id": "70mH6WOn8vqtQ_Wklgbe2g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "Love the unique food options.

I do, but wife doesn't. Easy to access, on one of the major streets in city and across from the biggest mall. The service is fast and friendly, very clean but small dining area, and food is delicious being the fact I really like Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food. The gyros are big and selection is good, concerning the size of business. Give it a try, you might just like it as much as I."}, {"review_id": "qlX-gR9gfm_0qmWE_eJe-A", "user_id": "vqWjLDWE-lF8HZI0baf5-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Great service and authentic food.  Huge portion sizes.  Lamb is excellent and so is the chicken.  If you like stuffed grape leaves, which I do, this place has the best.  Their taziki sauce is also really good.  Take it from someone who knows Mediterranean food, this place is the best around!  I'll be back for more."}, {"review_id": "t24SyQU3aH31_7Xw914oxw", "user_id": "C0UOIzgnmQ3DGLy5WzCI6A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "I love this restaurant.

They were so patient with my cautious relatives who were hesitant to try Greek food for the first time.

The Greek salad was delicious and very fresh. The lamb was flavorful as well.

This establishment easily tops the list and rivals (if not surpasses) the authentic Greek experience I had on Patmos. It has been a favorite for work food runs and in fact I must admit I've never actually been there, but I've had their food close to 10 times. I just wish they were open on Sundays. As for the food, the portions are plentiful and everything is very fresh. The price will be a little higher than \"fast food\" but not as high as a typical chain sit-down restaurant. I enjoy supporting this business."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/paizis-gyros-fort-smith?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
