I've now ordered take out from here twice and let me just say that this place is \"Pho\" real. The restaurant itself is really small and located within a shopping strip. The good news is that the herds of Albuquerque foodies haven't flooded this place yet, so now might be a good time to try it out before it gets packed. The food here is really good and portions are plentiful. The price is just slightly more expensive than your typical Pho restaurant but like I said the plates are a lot bigger. The interior of the restaurant is clean and staff are very friendly. I hope to soon drop in and actually have a meal at the restaurant rather than order out. This is one of the best Pho establishments that I've come across on the westside thus far. Grab a buddy and have some dinner \"Pho\" two. Highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "fX_1IqW_9PC3zu7-flam3A", "user_id": "fZxkZArwohI4RsisGULMcw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "Great place to stop for lunch.   I have tried several different flavor of pho and never been disappointed.  The vegetable pho seems to be made with frozen veggies so not the best, but the flavorful broth makes the taste wonderful.  The spring rolls are a great way to start off the meal.   The owner is friendly and appreciative of the business.   The only negative I have is the inconsistency in service.  Seems many new staff and takes a bit to get them trained.   If you feel like Vietnamese, try this place you will not be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "1r4ysjMp3FanbOm6lSV-yQ", "user_id": "yGUcQnKCr9K2vbAUNeW_Vg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/25/2017", "text": "So glad this place is close to my house!

The family enjoy every bite no complaints. Food came out on time and the environment was perfect to music playing in the back ground. Restroom were clean and location to parking wasn't full at all. Will return and try new entrees.Don't be surprise the menu is huge but I do want to try them all.

So far this place takes top along with two others. The beef pho was really good, broth was just right, service was great, Thai ice tea was just right, and no complaints. Would have liked the jalapenos to be hotter. Everything was good and tasted fresh. I was not disappointed at all. Sometimes trying new places could be weary, but I'm glad to have given this place a chance."}, {"review_id": "5H0NRDpkqTipHKumnGzNVA", "user_id": "ekDObg89-br5ec4Ks4EGfQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "If you are into pho at a reasonable price this is the pace to come to.

We arrived with 3 adults, one infant, and a teenager on Sunday a little after 1:00pm. The infant needed a diaper change, unfortunately they don't have a changing table in either the men's or women's bathroom. Not a big deal. So they took our order, we ordered pork spring rolls for an appetizer, our teenager ordered a grilled shrimp rice dish, and the three remaining all ordered rare beef steak Pho. About ten minutes later another group of three arrived (very small inside, it was very tight) and were seated next to us. We had the spring rolls, they were very fresh, but lacked texture (noodles and greens). Then our teenagers grilled shrimp arrived, unfortunately it was cold... ten minutes later, and we still haven't got our pho, and our teenager is done eating his meal.... Then, to our surprise, the group next to us all get the pho they ordered 15 minutes after we ordered. We decided to pay the bill and leave, accepting that sometimes things happen. We were told our food is almost done, and the other group had ordered a different soup.... Unfortunately, as good as the pho might be, we didn't get to try it and we will not be back because of the terrible service received. The owner followed up, and wanted to fix it. changed review"}, {"review_id": "wkUzWGh7myEaJU_hRfXPAw", "user_id": "nMQK3Z1W9Myh-8tgFjUBIQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "Staff was very friendly.
