It was late because we had just left the casino so not that many places were open, but they were so we came you order food from the window. Jason got fried shrimp combo and I got the catfish combo. while we wait for our food we were laughing and talking with some girls that were leaving the club which is right next door. So next time we said we would go to the club and then gets some food. They cook everything to order so it was a bit of a wait not to bad though. We got our food and was headed back to the hotel we tired a shrimp and it was pretty good couldn't wait to eat. Finally got to our room my catfish was still hot crispy and seasoned welled not over cooked just right and the shrimp was the same it was prefect expect for the fries they were soggy, but didn't matter because it fish and shrimp was good.We will be back"}, {"review_id": "XCCauAbfGIoh0hqX0EyS3g", "user_id": "EjAS3mgpjzRPt4htOF8Z5A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "First time I was like OMG this chicken is soooo good.

Your 5 star reviews were spot on! This place is a hidden gem. The only downside is that they just have a few small tables inside and a table outside with several comfortable chairs. This isn't a fancy - looking place to impress your date your 1st time out. You get your food in Styrofoam containers. I suspect most of their business is to-go.The owners (Dennis & Debbie) are extremely friendly and more than make up for the above mentioned downside with their warm Southern hospitality. Then, the food! Wow! I went there with my wife and 2 small kids and we all shared their Combo #6 which comes with 2 fish fillets, 4 chicken tenders, 4 wings, a lot of fries, and 2 drinks for $23 and we added 6 fried shrimp for an additional $6...and a couple more drinks. When the owner found out we wanted to eat at the outside table, he went outside and straightened everything up and took an additional chair out for us. Also, as we were eating, he checked on us several times to make sure we were satisfied with everything and if we needed anything.We were very hungry big-eaters and we all left stuffed. Shane's Seafood and the other local fish and seafood places need to come learn from this guy. He knows how to fry! None of it was fried up ahead of time. Everything was perfectly seasoned and extremely moist with no strong fishy taste. I can't overstress how delicious everything was. Do yourself a favor and go try this place soon. We'll definitely be returning."}, {"review_id": "E2U-Mc9Kxv17nBscEVJojw", "user_id": "et9vbfZKZcJ7hHc9ehXcKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/8/2015", "text": "Dennis and Debbie have made \"I Fry\" a labor of love. Our family stopped in for lunch while traveling down I-20. We ordered a #6 combo and found that for $23 we were amply fed. The catfish is white and flaky, the chicken lived up to its billing as the best tenders in the area. The seating area is small, you won't get more than 3-4 people at a table.Along with generous portions for the money, we were also offered several sauces: hot, tartar, Ranch, honey mustard, and ketchup. While there we got to meet several of the regulars, which added to the experience. If you are looking for delicious fried food in the Shreveport area, look no further. I Fry is an excellent choice, and close enough to the interstate for a quick stop."}, {"review_id": "jgzuVvYPJ32cuo6hAvfIkw", "user_id": "L2VpWNkB87RbP7HuBlTY0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2016", "text": "This has got to be some of the best fish and chicken I have had in a long time.

I saw I Fry on Yelp and decided to give it a try for lunch. I'm glad I did. The food was tasty and hit the spot. I got the chicken tenders combo and added 4 wings. The owner threw in a free meat pie for me to try...I wish he thew in a couple more. The tenders were delicious. The wings were crispy and breaded...I prefer breaded wings over naked wings. The meat pie left me wanting more. The owner was very friendly and likes strike up a conversation while your food is being prepared. The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because it's take out only. There are a couple tables in there to sit and eat but it doesn't real feel like a place you would sit and eat. Don't be put off by that fact though and give this place a try. I'll be back to try the catfish and get more meat pies."}, {"review_id": "AALjqMpkFfJRvoesQsdtmw", "user_id": "W8eIqbboMZ5I0BUIUAfz0Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/14/2015", "text": "Great customer service...

We met Dennis, and he was very friendly and professional. The catfish was the best we've ever had. The shrimp was cooked well and tasty. The coleslaw was fresh and crunchy and tasted really good, although it had a little too much dressing for me and my wife. The tarter sauce and cocktail sauces were really good. The french fries could have been cooked a little longer (I like mine a little crispy). The chicken tenders were just as advertised; the best in town. The corn dog was good and cooked well.
