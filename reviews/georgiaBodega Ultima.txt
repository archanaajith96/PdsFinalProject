I've been trying to find a place to study besides a mainstream Starbucks and the atmosphere in Bodega is so cool. They close at 2:30 on weekdays but I'll definitely be heading over to chill & study on the weekends when they close later. The menu had a wide variety of tastes ranging from a simple burger to Indian tandoori chicken to Vietnamese style banh mi to mediterranean falafel & hummus! (Yes, salads are available too). This was really exciting to see. I thoroughly enjoyed the pork banh mi sandwich as it had amazing flavor. I'll definitely be coming back to try the coffee which I've heard is amazing."}, {"review_id": "5Lum1_Cj1a0AzxVEXTtCZQ", "user_id": "zJMYjYMaj7wERK-uH2gfPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/17/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I've already said it before, but I love this place. I've tried several things and they've all been good. This morning I had the smoked salmon BLT and a caramel breve and it hit the spot. I'd gladly order that again for breakfast. It's hard to order the same thing twice here because I want to try everything at least once. I'm ready for warmer weather already to get back out on the patio!"}, {"review_id": "iw3LgjXH1s051Cl5b6FY3g", "user_id": "GPNojpFW_tUw5voNeZz0lQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "I am in town for work and needed a space to get some work done outside of my hotel so I looked up coffee shops in my area. To my surprise, this place does not only serve coffee but also serves food as well as alcohol (full bar). I ordered a cinnamon and honey latte and sat outside as you can see in the picture. I loved how spacious the outdoor seating was and how convenient it was for me to get work done there. If you're looking for craft coffee, I wouldn't suggest coming here as the latte I ordered was not by any means craft but it was a great experience nonetheless and met the needs I was looking for."}, {"review_id": "S913JWgTzGDUvkLS2ZqhLw", "user_id": "KVrbcPx__XH7tJEshRfRiw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "Absolutely love this place! Coffee is excellent! Brought a friend visiting from New Haven and he could not stop complimenting the drip coffee. The brunch food is delicious, i love the salmon lox or garden toast if you want something light. This place has a chic atmosphere with the drinks to match. I would highly recommend a Bloody Mary-- my favorite in town. If you're looking for huge hearty portions and that old school breakfast this would not be your jam, but this a is great contemporary spot with delicious food, breakfast services all day long. If you're visiting Augusta, i would recommend."}, {"review_id": "_FqQFhjRFNOGhHWVTNlnRQ", "user_id": "iNdj-vYPXmJ88LXPZqGpGA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/12/2017", "text": "I do not know how it is I am just writing a review for this place. Maybe it was a subconscious desire to keep it all to myself, but I know I can't be selfish. Plus, plenty of people have already found it. My first visit was a few weeks after they opened and I have been impressed from that moment on. For anyone familiar to the area, the Surrey Center is easy to find. What some may not know is that there are two \"levels\", the cluster at the top of the hill and another group of businesses at the bottom. Bodega will be in the middle of the bottom one. Parking is for all of the Surrey Center so just find the closest spot.     Now immediately you will see the outdoor space as you walk up. The area between the Bodega and another business is an open lot, with part of it covered. Comfortable chairs await as does the garden fountain at the opposite end. If  you want sun, got it. If you want shade, got it. This area is also dog friendly.     Now walking in the door is the tricky part. To your left you will see a wall with items varying from coffee beans to mugs to olive oils (the bodega part). To the right is indoor seating and the bar. And straight ahead will be where you place your order. On a normal day a line is already formed so you can just join right on in. A couple of things you should note: 1) the lunch special is on the side out front on the sidewalk, 2) the menu's for both breakfast and lunch are on the bar (to the right of the cashier),  and 3) the soup's of day are on a  tiny side to the left of the cashier. Put these together and you have all of your options. Also note that breakfast is served all day.     I have ordered both breakfast and lunch and will only say this, I have never been disappointed. Whether it was a fried egg with a perfected yolk on top or a Chicago sandwich with a succulent au jus sauce accompanying or the  house fries, it was all excellence on a plate. Then we have the coffee. Though not a local roaster (from New York), it is a quality bean. I usually have one cup before and during my meal and another afterwards (unless I am drinking something else). I love a great cup of coffee paired with my meal.      The bar is extensive and comes with some great selections. You can choose what is you favor, but I will recommend trying John Bowman bourbon at least once. It is out of Richmond (VA), has sweet notes, and is the perfect end to a perfect meal. Also, it is hard to find in this area.*Insider's Tip-My favorite time to come is on Sunday's, between 10-11 am. You miss the breakfast crowd and beat the lunch crowd, giving you plenty of options for seating.-Water and silverware are located directly to the right of the cashier, against the wall. Condiments for your coffee are to the right of the cashier, on the bar."}, {"review_id": "oSHi9GBxqWnDLCJP2bNkzQ", "user_id": "wQxDEtAIlFJ15UF-SI8pdg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/4/2017", "text": "Cool, hip and trendy.

I was in the area looking for housing and searched on Yelp for good coffee shops in the area. I ended up enjoying breakfast and coffee at Bodega on my first trip and I've been a frequent visitor since. I love everything about Bodega: the ambiance and style, the large outdoor patio, the delicious food, and aromatic coffee. This place is perfect if you can hit it early before the lunch crowd rushes in. I love enjoying coffee and a bagel out on the patio. I've had multiple meetings and friend dates at Bodega - it'll forever be one of my favorite meeting places in the area. I have simple taste when it comes to coffee, but I definitely have high expectations. I've ordered a few lattes at Bodega (which have been great), but I usually go with the drip coffee, which is always hot, fresh, and delicious. Bodega is a little on the pricier side, but they use fresh and local ingredients. I've tried several sandwiches, which have all been packed with flavor. When meeting friends or just wanting to get out of the house to work on stuff, I always hit up Bodega. Definitely a great find here in Augusta!"}, {"review_id": "JcXyOX6Q8Uuk689j3RUTSw", "user_id": "hdQ0F6hqLZpdLteky0RzgA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. It is my go to place for lunch anytime I have an out of town visitor. They never disappoint. Service is excellent and food (in taste and presentation) is stellar. The Mediterranean and Kale salads are healthy selections and delicious to boot. The Reuben sandwich is by far the best I've ever had. Can't wait until they are regularly open for dinner.

This place was simply amazing. I really enjoyed the unique menu items and having a good list of things to choose from. This establishment is very welcoming with its modern decor. It was a nice spring evening therefore my friends and I opted to sit outside. The outdoor area is very scenic and spacious. The restaurant is located in a well known area call Surry Center not far from The Augusta National which is known for the Master's golf tournament. The restaurant has just recently just started serving dinner and it seems to be very popular already. The staff was very nice and explained the menu items in detail. This is a tapas restaurant so when looking at the menu  please order more than one item and enjoy."}, {"review_id": "H0877wAzhAxPLqHCT9GIkA", "user_id": "QjNjVF-ZdWr-P4zUzXwpVA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/2/2016", "text": "I really want to like this place more but it's so crowded and messy on the weekends. The coffee bar pickup area is a bit hectic-they call out your coffee order and sometimes people forget what they ordered or sit down expecting people to serve them their drinks since they have number tags. The decorations are beautiful and the word \"rustic\" suits it very well. I appreciate the full bar 'cause who doesn't need a Rye Manhattan at 9 a.m. on a Sunday morning? I'm not sure what the dinner menu is like since I'm only here when I pass by in the mornings hoping for a really good lox bagel. The lox is usually delightfully thinly sliced and pairs nicely with the everything bagel. I suggest sitting outdoors if you have the opportunity. There are so curtains or shade for the inside so you have to put on sunglasses when the sun hits the windows just so but the outdoor is covered in a brick tunnel which is wonderful to sit underneath during the summer."}, {"review_id": "dzOUDXFuYY-o3L5Bf7dGYw", "user_id": "7_wcUpp2n8BAKkL820l-Nw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/5/2017", "text": "The patio is awesome!We've come here for breakfast and for late night drinks.

We stopped by after church on a Sunday because we needed free wi-fi to do some work. It has a nice ambiance and was pretty busy for a Sunday. I had a cold brew coffee which I loved. Didn't even. We'd to add cream and sugar because it was so smooth, which I like since I'm trying to cut down on the sweeteners but am having trouble giving up coffee. We also had the breakfast burrito. It was good, nothing special about it but the taste was good enough for us to finish it. There was a decent number of outlets spread out throughout the inside of the cafe for those that require it. Also a nice patio seating area to hang out.

Also a great place for a nice brunch or luncheon with friends. (They have a full bar so don't forget your vino or mimosa!)I ended up getting the basque sandwich on their breakfast menu after having biggest debate about whether to wait for their lunch menu to be served. My friend did wait and got the kale salad off their lunch menu. I highly recommend both! Her kale salad was large enough to last almost two meals.- Greek whole grain toast: Loved this combo! I was pleasantly surprised by how good this was!- The Basque: Filling enough for a brunch and delicious! The chorizo was amazing.- Bagel & cream cheese: I'm a fan of the garlic taste but if you're not, be warned that the herb cream cheese has a very strong garlic flavor. - Lox: They give you the lox, cream cheese, capers, onions, etc to build your own lox bagel. - Smoked salmon BLT: So good! I loved the avocado and mozzarella with the lox."}, {"review_id": "D1THdAM7Zx4cCyNrex4N0Q", "user_id": "234NXNhTQabPp9rqLWgDuw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/9/2016", "text": "What a cool place!  The rustic decor is very inviting and just begs for patrons to sit for a little while.  Located in Surrey Center, an awesome wooden door greets you at the entrance of Bodega Ultima.  The employees are super friendly and open to answer whatever questions you may have.I came here on a Saturday for breakfast and had an expertly made latte and the Basque sandwich.  The sandwich was delicious-- it had ricotta cheese, egg omelette, tomato, avocado, and chorizo.  There are other options available for breakfast as well as a lunch menu that looked amazing as well.  For lunch you can even get beer or spirits as they have a stocked bar.  Bodega Ultima has a lot of other things for sale including proprietary olive oil, mugs, Tervis tumblers, etc.  It's a great place to eat a nice meal, read a book or to hang out!"}, {"review_id": "9ivNvzhM7_r3zrka2C1H2w", "user_id": "_kZ0tGhxgHU8qOtENAUsAQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/26/2016", "text": "I have been on the lookout for an amazing coffee shop in Augusta and when I heard about this one I was hopeful.
