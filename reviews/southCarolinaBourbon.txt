However, it's very rare that they won't.   So  her!!!She typically works the far end of the bar(towards the kitchen ) she and her beautiful red hair make the most magnificent Dark &Stormy and Heart of Darkness\"!  Every visit here has been great. It is one of the nicer spots in Columbia that host a real bar and operates after 10:00. Though we don't venture out much on the weekday, we try to get a few date nights during the weekday to avoid the mad dash on the weekends - so this was ideal. Though there is nothing typical about the food, typical  fare for us is usually:Hush puppies, Boudin w/ Braised Greens, Sausage Board, Charcuterie board, Manchester Farm Stuffed Quail, Duck Noodle Bowl, Lady Edison Pork Chop and Brussel Sprouts. These dishes have always manage to please on any given day.

I hear the wait can be long. So if you don't like to wait, time your dine appropriately. My main was the \"Bison & Bulleit - Low-Co Smoked Carolina Bison Rib & a Shot Of Bulleit Bourbon\" - $21 (see photo) Very tasty. Finished the meal with a Heart of Darkness. See the description in the photo. I watched several get made at the bar, but having it delivered to, and \"assembled\" at the table, was even better. Unique and tasty drink. Good finish to the bison rib. Excellent service.Note: Only reason I am not going five stars on this first review is I did not try enough of the food to be comfortable going \"As good as it gets.\" But, I'm pretty sure I would, if I ate here again. Especially if I could get in on the \"Beer + Bulleit + Burger = $10\" special everyday from 4PM to 6PM. Bottom Line: Very happy with my niece's suggestion of Bourbon."}, {"review_id": "qZXTn0rI_ingPEiyqQpuCA", "user_id": "cooyyc2ckSXgWvr8q01GMA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/26/2018", "text": "This place is cute. Well \"cute\" seems inappropriate since it's masculine yet quaint. It's a whiskey bar so it has a classic prohibition look and feel. Lots of wood and craft cocktail ingredients...right up my alley. My mom and I stopped in for brunch late one Saturday morning last month. There was plenty of seating at the bar so we decided to dine there. Our bartender was really attentive and also just an all around cool guy. We both started with drinks. I got the \"Frankly, My Dear...\" which has Makers, vanilla syrup, black walnut bitters (that I didn't know was a thing), and a flamed orange peel. It was awesome. My mom had the Moscow Mule but swapped the type of vodka and said it was fine. I also tried the Duckin' Felicious (say that 3 times fast) that has Jameson Black Barrel, sherry, ginger syrup, lemon, orange bitters and orange zest...YUM-MY!!!For brunch my mom had the Fried NC Catfish and absolutely loved it. She couldn't get enough of the bean medley mixed underneath the fish. I had a dish I don't believe is on the permanent menu. I'd be lying if I even attempted to remember what it was called but it was bowl of beef, collard greens, a potato hash of sorts all topped with cheese and green onions. It really should be called \"Bowl o' Heaven\" because that's how amazing it tasted. I absolutely cannot wait to go back the next time I'm in Columbia!!!"}, {"review_id": "yftHwrtSe2hI0q58Xyi0dA", "user_id": "PeuCOprqoFEtSjj-pLlLZw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "One of the best spots on Main St! Bourbon is pretty intimate, good for a date night or happy hour. It's usually pretty busy so expect some wait, but it's totally worth it! The food is amazing! I had a burger and Mac n cheese and was totally blown away! Great, quality ingredients and so much flavor in their dishes. I tried the brussels sprouts as well and they were the best I've ever had. They also have a good drink list, I had a French 75 which was pretty good! Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is really nice.

Atmosphere is a casual pub. They have an extensive bourbon selection. Our friend really wanted to try the Pappy 2 ounce flight for $120. Smarter heads prevailed. The service is really good here. Our waitress did a good job with our group of six. We had the bacon board as a starter. Bacon, how can you go wrong. My wife had the hash, and someone else had the shrimp and grits.

Sounds good on paper but it's all one note and just doesn't taste well together. The biscuit of champions was also only alright. The chicken was dry and the only thing saving me from dehydration was the sauce it came with. We got an extra side of tater tots and it was really good and crunchy. The drink specials were also not bad with $3 mimosas.

I think the food at bourbon is great. I have had great starters, entrees and desserts. The drinks, however, have been inconsistent when I've been and are overpriced, in my opinion. There's also an unappealing smell around Bourbon, and I'm not sure if it's just me or if it actually smells like sewage. The restaurant is generally overcrowded. The building is cool, but it simply doesn't fit the people they allow in. The community tables in the middle of the restaurant are really my worst nightmare.

Super small space, average food. Not bad or great. Barely any crab in the crab cake, pork belly was good but very greasy, Nola shrimp were gross, but the burger had good flavor.

The restaurant has a nice upscale feel and makes you forget you're in Columbia. I've been for brunch before and although it was packed, I was able to grab a seat at the bar. The servers are all friendly and honest about different selections on the menu (which I greatly appreciate).On this particular occasion, I was celebrating a friend's birthday and it happened to be restaurant week so they had a three course special for $29. I ordered the pork skins (1st course), salmon on jambalaya rice (2nd course), and banana pudding (3rd course). I'm not crazy about pork skins so it's my fault for ordering them, but I tasted my friend's fried green tomato and that was the much better option. I really enjoyed the salmon, although I feel like they could have given more rice. The banana pudding was good, but not great. It had more whipped cream than I like. I also could have had more vanilla wafers since that's my favorite part of banana pudding.I will definitely be back to Bourbon but I'll probably stick to the shrimp and grits, jambalaya, and etouffee."}, {"review_id": "ebzuKwrqxUmFFfx7QWnhBQ", "user_id": "n_HCxZpyeWpOY4gqyedK8g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "This is my third time here at Bourbon and it has been consistently fantastic!

Except for the fact that I had no idea they have two different menus. One for lunch and a completely different one for dinner. :'( It's a small little bar with a few booths and a good amount of high top chairs at the bar. Their selection of liquor is very very extensive as well. So drink up!! Hahaha. I have nothing bad to say about any of the food we ordered during BRUNCH TIME. The steak and eggs came out amazing, we ordered medium rare and got a nice juicy medium rare steak. The crab cakes were small, but filling, also very delicious. The burger was soooooo filling, I could have went with the one patty, but my eyes are bigger than my stomach. Desserts - everything was sooooo yummy. There were five of us, and we ordered one of each. I believe there's three or four different choices and I have to say the banana pudding was my absolute favorite! I wish their gumbo was served all day, I would have loved to have tried that, but it's a dinner item :'( If I ever come back to the area I will definitely be coming back here for dinner!!"}, {"review_id": "anvIo9KMvdssl9RhGd3mng", "user_id": "ZuDFRLhpwDJsAvNtRyzohg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Aggressively average. This place's saving grace is their selection of brown liquor. Their food wasn't all that great. I wouldn't recommend the brunch experience. The biscuits of champions was decent but the gravy was lacking. I had high hopes for the quail and waffles but was not impressed. The quail was done well but the hot honey was lacking in quantity which left an overpowering flour taste of the waffle on the tongue. The service was weird. I didn't talk to the same waiter/waitress twice.
