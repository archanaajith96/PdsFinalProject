Deli isn't always great if you need to eat gluten-free - but we needed something quick before the Devil's game and had been told to try Hobby's.When I asked the (delightful, friendly) waitress my standard gluten-free questions she called over one of the owners and the two of them made me feel incredibly safe. The owner's wife eats gluten-free and so not only does Hobby's stock GF wraps to use instead of bread or pita, but the kitchen team is well-versed in keeping things separate and the owner went back to supervise them making my dish. Looking forward to going again next time I'm in the area."}, {"review_id": "zQZxBRGjUzfScshPub4E-A", "user_id": "ClKfn1F1pPCOuCzDDYtAYQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "Top level.

Hobby's Deli is what I'm talking today. This review is a bit late but accurate. First the parking...it's downtown Newark so it's on the street and metered. It was a little tough but not crazy. Now the food the first time I had a chicken soup to start. The main course was the Kansas burger with fries. The second time I had the Poutine with the turkey and a side of onion rings. All I can say WOW !! It was super delicious both times and I was not able to finish the food either time.         I STRONGLY recommend eating here. Some would say the place needs a remodel but it has its history plus you will forget about that once the food arrives. Oh and I had a stuffed cupcake SUPER WOW !!! These people can't do wrong."}, {"review_id": "-pwTpURil0GjVWnSEYTy6w", "user_id": "w4a12OYuImh084MNF3pGMQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "So, coming into town from Ga I was longing for an old style deli.  My niece and her husband took me here! Open bowls of pickles and pickled tomato on the table. The combo pastrami and corned beef w/ slaw (creamyy) was out of this world.  Meat wasn't dry or old and stacked high like a deli should. I did have the manhatten clam chowder and that wasn't  good at all.  I think they waved the clams over the broth and 1 or 2 fell in by accident. Friendly service and I regretted not having another day there."}, {"review_id": "NsegfUBx2t4vykkDIpnRAQ", "user_id": "gpaD7PS_rCPjbUKq7fCyhg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/9/2017", "text": "My First time at Hobby's, I have been to so many Devils games and I cannot believe I have never walked a couple of blocks to go here. I love when you walk in you are treated like family, and the inside made me feel like I was at my Grandma's house. They leave out the must have pickles at the table, so you don't have to get up and go the the pickle bar. I got half corned beef half pastrami, and the sandwich was excellent. Usually 17 bucks for a sandwich is steep, but the corned beef and pastrami were prepped perfectly, and piled so high I couldn't see across the table. I could have had half and been happy, but it was so good I ate the whole thing. They a ton of specials named after devils of new and past. A must stop for any Devils fan!"}, {"review_id": "0IB8ad00byjhIOo6jqIjBw", "user_id": "iW0IOhRw_iAuOuQT-bhoUA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/17/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Stopped at hobbys for lunch when I had jury duty in Newark.

This place was recommended to me by a fellow NJ Devils fan, and it did not disappoint. The guys here really treat you like a family. Their corned beef sandwich was huge, and probably the best I've had anywhere. Super fresh and still warm. A real old-school Jewish deli, a diamond in the rough.

My three meats were Corned Beef, Pastrami, and Tongue served on Rye bread (of course); with my side salad being more coleslaw.Cut into three sections, this regal sized sandwich was so delicious. My favorite meat was the corned beef as it was deliciously fatty (not too much) and had a nice subtle salty brine taste which really shined through. The pastrami was very solid with a delightful spicy pepper outer edge, but some pieces were a bit lean. Finally the tongue was super tender and had a robust beefiness to it.The rye bread was excellent too with a flavorful Caraway seed taste still prevailing through all the other flavors of the meats and Russian dressing.My sister had the Reuben slider dish which serves up three varieties in the Brisket Reuben, \"Chico\" Reuben, and Pastrami Reuben along with French fries.Each was very delicious, notably the very tender brisket slices and the \"Chico\" Reuben with hot sauce and Pepperjack cheese.My sister's favorite was the Pastrami which she saved to eat last to savor the experience. Her pastrami was a bit fattier (and therefore tastier than my Pastrami) and made for a great Reuben along with some assertive sauerkraut.We ended the meal with a complimentary dessert through checking-in on yelp, but be warned, the dessert is only limited to several cookie selections.Finally, service was nice and efficient with no issues.I could also see both of the owners walking around the restaurant helping the waiters and also talking to customers at each and every table. We had a small conversation with one owner and he was super nice and appreciated out patronage. Delicious food and definitely worth another foray into Newark!"}, {"review_id": "LS-Di9YhEyKpWYR10JgHiQ", "user_id": "Z64vWUm-rErQbf_fvg_Eng", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "Excellent deli.

Huge portions and amazing service.  We were greeted by the owner as we walked in and were taken very good care of by our server.  The owner, Mike, even came over and chatted with us as though we had been in a hundred times before.  Marc, the co-owner, gave us a bunch of great ideas of things to do to help make our trip a real NJ / NY experience!We highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great food and great people!.
