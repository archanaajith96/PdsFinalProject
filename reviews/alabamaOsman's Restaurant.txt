The food and service are outstanding.The prices are very reasonable - the highest is $35.00.Osman is the owner/CHEF.Mickey is the owner/chief server - there are only three but wait times are truly minimal.Meals come with salad, rolls, entree with potato and vegetables.Alcohol is available with other typical non alcoholic beverages."}, {"review_id": "UH2GDMIZxU53tmth_EakIA", "user_id": "N786yykDvvJCyzl1poo8Yg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/21/2017", "text": "Hubby and I went to Osman's for dinner on Saturday night!  This is a quaint, intimate, romantic restaurant with limited seating, so we strongly suggest reservations!We were greeted by Mickey, Osman's wife and taken into the dining area.  Things were already feeling pretty special and then the Universe delivered Sabina (Mickey and Osman's daughter) to our table as our server.  Obviously she has the inside scoop so we went with all of her suggestions.Appetizer - Shrimp Gorgonzola -my  hubby, who is Italian, said this was by far the BEST he has ever had!  We liked it so much we considered ordering the entree to take home for lunch on Sunday.Soup/Salad - Hubby had the house salad with Ranch dressing that must have been home made.  He said it was incredible.  I had the soup of the day, asparagus, and it did not disappoint.Entrees- I had the Smoked Salmon Fettuccine and it was pasta heaven for me.  I kept tossing  the pasta in the creamy sauce and the flavor continued to expand.  Wow!  Please note, I brought half of it home because of the huge serving size!  I am not complaining - yummy lunch.Hubby had the catch of the day, redfish.  I believe there were 4 options for how one could have it prepared.  Being a New Orleans native, he selected blackened.  The fish was drizzled with a Balsamic reduction, served with a side a vegetables and he loved it.We went with Sabina's suggestion, and finished our fabulous meal with a Bosnian Cream of Wheat Cake.  It is very similar to Italian Tiramisu but the flavor is vanilla instead of coffee.  It was fabulous.  Mickey is the baker and Osman is the Chef.If you are visiting Mobile - don't miss this one!  It is truly a European restaurant in style and flavors!They are only open for dinner with a very small dining room, so make reservations!Full bar, extensive wine list by the bottle and a by the glass menu is also available!Everyone was dressed for dinner so know that this is not a shorts/baseball cap sort of dining experience."}, {"review_id": "3O8sNarw_nBbZboIMIS-5w", "user_id": "ucJkdCmf5eEj-BWxXTRJLQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/16/2017", "text": "Oh, Osmans...where have you been all my life! I wish I could give this restaurant an extra star because it is truly a culinary delight. Osman, is a extraordinary chef that clearly understands how to marry ingredients to make even an ordinary salad dressing so much more than you would expect. The entrees are unbelievable and the serving size is very generous. I was told by their daughter, Sabina, that her mother Mickey prepares the deserts..... and I have never been disappointed with my desert selections either.Osman family....you rock!!!"}, {"review_id": "9g9ERYQR8Hfix8fYnfyh9Q", "user_id": "YO9G7vPqqADnCWPclTWgLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "Amazing small little spot for a romantic dinner.

I have never been disappointed with the food or the service,one of the best restaurants we have in Mobile! I highly recommend the Gnocchi Gorgonzola it is heaven in a bowl served with Gnocchi pasta covered with shrimp,ham,peas and a Gorgonzola cheese and cream sauce. It's to die for!! Everyone of the soups are amazing and you cannot go wrong with the brown butter steak with balsamic glaze. Make sure you make a reservation and prepare for a culinary treat!!"}, {"review_id": "FSj7JPWNIjs6SBfcIMlo-Q", "user_id": "zw4gXwFSUYkB4km3MpXs3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Love Osman's.  Has been our special place to come celebrate birthdays and anniversaries for several years now.

I do agree with what some people are saying -- my filet and veggies wasn't a huge portion, but my mom and husband both had huge portions.

It is inside a house and the dining room is beautifully lit and surrounded by art and wine bottles. The restaurant only has perhaps 12 tables for dining which makes for an intimate experience. If it wasn't for the ambience I would give the restaurant 3 stars.The food, although very WELL PRICED for the portion sizes (we were two people and more than half of what we ordered was left), The mussels were too salty, nearly inedible.

I have so say that Osman's is a place everyone should try once. The food there isn't necessarily Italian. There are many Eastern European dishes there as well. I would definitely classify it as European cuisine however. Don't judge a book by its cover when you arrive. I'm not going to lie it looked like a double wide in the middle of a feral cat farm. I guess it is tough to find a nice plot of land for really anything in West Mobile, but once you enter the restaurant it is extremely private and romantic. Recommend calling ahead as there is limited seating and only bring your special someone. We were seated next to a large group and their conversation takes over the small room. I highly recommend Osman's, and only wish it was in a better location."}, {"review_id": "yHf_a-Tx44tVlKtclwNQXw", "user_id": "a5shTWfNEAwQOXupzWahSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/26/2016", "text": "We have enjoyed this restaurant for YEARS.  It is one interesting/pleasant/exciting surprise after another!  Upon first glance it seems a bit humble and in an unusual location...walk inside and it is a treat on so many levels!  There are not a lot of tables so call for a reservation if you can...if not, it is worth the gamble to swing by and wait for a seat.  EVERY SINGLE THING we have ever ordered here has been delicious (food and drinks). Another of those little surprises I mentioned is their extensive menu.  And as I said, there have been no bad choices. Some things worth mentioning are: the roast pork gorgonzola; any of the schnitzel choices and the brie appetizer.  (but truly you could close your eyes and point, and you would be thrilled with the selection!)It is not inexpensive, but it is consistently worth the price.This is definitely a 'MUST TRY' (and try again!) for Mobile AL"}, {"review_id": "wNoJ6ygQ0Grc42hkxTVfDQ", "user_id": "JmSLZiU41GaW_jkPKr0tFA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/22/2016", "text": "Went here for our first anniversary and it was amazing!
