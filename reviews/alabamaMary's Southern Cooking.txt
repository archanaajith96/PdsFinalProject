My husband weren't sure what to expect portion-wise and had smaller appetites when we went in so decided to share and we got plenty of food for both of us. We got the baked chicken, mac n cheese, and mashed potatoes. Without going into great detail about each item, I will just say it was all excellent and we're dreaming about going back."}, {"review_id": "ysnD-x-dpbtU07EMJj__0A", "user_id": "kPgNVSxXnhkyWBkqTcW45g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "I'll give it a solid 3.5 for now, and I may or may not have momentarily feared for my life while tracking down soul food, alone in a strange Mobilian land! But Yelp said that Mary's Southern Cooking was the place to be for the best soul food in the city, so I popped the address into the GPS and blindly took on a 20 minute venture to take a crack at it. I've gotta hand it to ol' Mary, the food is pretty good. It's cafeteria style and I placed a carry out order of the oxtails and rice plate. Although the oxtails were definitely more fatty than I like and not falling off the bone, the flavor was on point. The greens, sweet tea, and macaroni and cheese were pretty good also. I'll definitely stop back in (with the hubs in tow) to give a few more items on the menu a whirl! It's good, but I can't give it the crown just yet.

This is a simple place, with the specials written on a board as you enter and then all laid out buffet style- but with someone serving from behind the counter. My husband got a fried chicken plate- which came with three sides (he got macaroni, Lima beans and peas). The chicken was wonderful!! The sides were delicious as well. I got the spaghetti and meat sauce, which came with two sides (I got peas and cabbage) and also a piece of chicken. The spaghetti was a bit sweet for my taste, but delicious all the same. The sides were yummy. Excellent meal- huge portions for a great price."}, {"review_id": "bkwtLCZIh4u2sT2vJtz3hA", "user_id": "RHzo2vW5dxtj7Ld3Z7ysHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "This is probably the best soul food you'll ever eat.

Fried or baked chicken, steak, red beans & rice, conecuh sausage, turnip greens, green beans, mac & cheese, baked yams, corn, fried okra, etc.   OMG!  Each entree' came with 2 or 3 sides, depending upon the entree.  Finally, I decided upon the red beans & rice with conecuh sausage, turnip greens, cornbread and Mac & cheese.  Portion sizes were huge!  I knew already that I would have food for later meals.  Yes, I said meals...plural.My beau chose fried chicken, mac & cheese, green beans and cornbread.  Foolishly, he ate his entire meal because the food tasted soooo good.  Even though I didn't eat my entire meal, we both felt the same (so full) afterward that we wanted to take a nap.  I believe that feeling is normal after eating a lot of good soul food.  This place will be a treat for me when I visit Mobile."}, {"review_id": "gTgl7JwDtSUfQszGuTkRVA", "user_id": "QQnW8PmIY3DkECvywA0CxQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/28/2016", "text": "Home cooking/soul food is what you will find here and it is exceptional.  This simple restaurant has a small cafeteria serving station where they plate up your food (which is plenty per person).  We had baked and fried chicken, homemade mac and cheese, greens, and mashed potatoes w gravy and a roll. Everything was delicious although the mac was too salty imo. They also had meatloaf and gumbo. On other days you can find chicken and dumplings or oxtails as entrees according to the cashier. The interior of the restaurant was very simple with tables neatly set up and a big screen tv.   Beverages included sweet tea and water. There was also a small selection of bottled sodas.
