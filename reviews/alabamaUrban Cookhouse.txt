All the workers were friendly and accommodating. I had the white bbq chicken sandwich (recommended by Chad whom taking my order) and it didn't disappoint. The bbq sauce is home made so I recommend getting a little extra on the side because it's great. It's quick, light, healthy, and best of all pretty cheap. To add..... Chad (employee) was really awesome and helpful"}, {"review_id": "k61-_gq0MJrQgPd1jSOyiw", "user_id": "tere929rRn8ZyGwY-1TuDg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/29/2017", "text": "This place was amazing! The service was fast and friendly, the restaurant was very clean, and most importantly, the food was delicious. I ordered the white BBQ chicken sandwich at the recommendation of the person taking my order. I was a little skeptical at first because I came in with the intention of getting the pork tacos. I was not disappointed. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and the white BBQ sauce was on point.  White BBQ sauce is something unique to Alabama and they nailed it here! For my side, I had broccoli salad. It had just the right amount of dressing on it and the grapes that were in it were an interesting touch that complimented the salad. What made it even better was knowing that everything was made fresh with local ingredients and that it was very budget friendly. They also offered a military discount. I did not have my kids with me, but it was nice to see that it was a family friendly establishment. They had crayons and coloring pages you could grab by the door and high chairs readily available. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place and I will most likely be coming back sometime before heading back to Colorado."}, {"review_id": "q0Mhy42SrG7UEegnU5dnfA", "user_id": "nLyaTQ9XHHPtz1VSpAUqAQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Beautiful ambiance.

Food was great tons of flavor but I wish the portions were a little bigger. I ordered the Shrimp Kabob and Rice Pilaf dinner with an Ice Tea. Tea was good. Buuut.......I was still left hungry after paying $14. Salad was also good. I ordered takeout and it wasn't much rice like only a scoop of it. Update: Customer service was awesome! I went back today and ordered the Steak and Rice meal. I enjoyed everything about my food. And the presentation ( I ordered to go again) was great. It didn't look slopped together and the portion size was great. Also, I had know idea Urban Cookhouse had an Drive thru  Not unpacking 3 babies in the future will be great  I would choose this restaurant over any burger fast food joint. 1. Healthier selections  2. Order to go-Drive Thru 3. Love the prices of the food"}, {"review_id": "Aaepnj66jW4Hc8wWfFotQQ", "user_id": "in1pIFVDl8WoPbQvz3mAcQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/12/2017", "text": "After fleeing from Irma, we found a good place to get some decent food.  It's a part of the new trend of restaurants, wholesome food with a modern flair.  I had the ham sliders with cheese, cheddar pasta and side of fresh fruit.  We also had their orange biscuits which we very good.  The staff is professional and polite to talk too.  The place is clean and bright.  The food was great.  I would only suggest they turn down the music a bit, it's hard to carry on a conversation with music that's too loud.  Totally recommended."}, {"review_id": "befI7N0vPZR5uHNfb4ZW4g", "user_id": "pq8hKpl-FSbTihJJWx0UQw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/23/2017", "text": "Good selection for decent price especially considering that this place is more like a Starbucks when it comes to tipping.

I got the pineapple ham, smoked turkey, cheddar pasta, broccoli salad, and orange roll meal--sooooo good. The most flavorful broccoli salad I've ever had, and the cheddar pasta...think grandma's mac and cheese. Comfort food at its finest! The portions for this meal were probably actual recommended portions, like what your average person should be eating for one meal. To me this is not a bad thing. Saves room for dessert which, by the way, was also amazing!

I started looking on Yelp and nothing was standing out except the Urban Cookhouse. Once again, Yelp for the win. I had the Grilled chicken special which came with a salad and rice pilaf. Everything was amazingly fresh. The salad dressing was a vinaigrette and had a wonderful flavor. The rice pilaf was also wonderful. My husband had the chipotle pork plate with cheesy pasta and broccoli salad. He who doesn't really care about food remarked about what a great decision we had made in choosing to dine here. The biggest thing that stood out was how fresh everything was. And the food looked beautiful. It honestly made me want to look at bringing a franchise to the Atlanta area where I live. So good. You won't go wrong in choosing to eat here.You order at the counter and they bring the food out to you. The place has an industrial loft kind of feel with exposed ducts and high ceilings. Everything was clean and well maintained."}, {"review_id": "8iM2xI877EaJXK7ORieB5w", "user_id": "EBAdO-RmnUg4fAjkpb4FTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/9/2017", "text": "Amazingggg food!

The steak was perfectly cooked, we didn't care for the cheddar pasta, and the orange roll was good. Two of the girls had the Irish Red Porter beer and loved it too!!Though a bit cold, the restaurant was clean and inviting. The booth we sat in was comfortable. The restroom was pretty clean too. The prices were awesome!!  They have a to-go/drive-up window for take-out orders. They have some retail items for purchase such as shirts, dry rubs, jellies, and beer glasses.  They also had some pre-packed food for purchase.

A new upscale fast casual chain pushing the local food and artisinal vibe. Nice selection of sandwiches and plates as well as wraps and salads. The sweet tea sucked on my visit but the food was a great value for the price. I had the Urban Cowboy which was a marinated steak sandwich with a chipotle sauce, peppers and onions, very reminiscent of a Cuban on a semi-pressed bread. My dining partner enjoyed her shrimp kabobs. They also have this awesome dish with the pretentious named Hot Cheddar Pasta otherwise known as macaroni and cheese. Really good. Plates come with little \"orange rolls\" which have a subtle sweetness. I didn't like them as much as I anticipated but nothing wrong with it either.This eatery has a spartan design scheme with metal and wood. It's very nicely executed though. Clean (ish) bathroom. Coke products. Outdoor seating available as well as as drive thru.This is classic fast casual where you order at the counter and they give you a number and both being you your food and bus your table.Bottom line: really impressed. As far as pure taste I might rank only 4 stars but the price was GREAT for a place offering upscale atmosphere and ostensibly quality ingredients. I would definitely return to try one of the wraps or plates."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/urban-cookhouse-montgomery-2?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
