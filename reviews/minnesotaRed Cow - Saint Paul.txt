I called and explained to Nicole(who answered the phone) and she said she was certain it would be honored if I came in. Unfortunately, I did not have time to dine in as I work two jobs and was putting in a 14 hour day. She said that normally they do not accept the birthday coupon unless you come in and dine. I explained how busy I was and did not have time to do this. She said no problem we can let you get it to go this once as you are to busy to dine in.  I called in my order about an hour later and she recalled our conversation and took my order. I went to pick it up and the restaurant was really full and very busy. To my amazement, I was helped immediately upon entering. told her who I was and she went to get my food. I took it back to the office and enjoyed it very much! I have always said Red Cow is in my top 3 burger places in St Paul, and I will continue to be a customer for years to come!"}, {"review_id": "rSftb9YBxCME-rOYd9ZxYg", "user_id": "iMVFT-Uex2zTpzQ2FkwOFg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "We were seated right away. Upstairs next to a breezy balcony. That was the best part. I ordered the veggie burger and my friend ordered the steak ceasar salad. My veggie burger was supposed to be curry flavor. Instead it was a weird chipotle rice and chickpea Slop on a bun. The flavors didn't complement well. I drank two stowaways. This was a fabulous choice. My friend ordered the hurricane and that was a collossal fail. Gaaahhhrosss. Her Cesar salad tasted good but looked like a poor woman's meal at best. Steak was too rare and required significant gumming prior to swallow. Drinks are good. Service was slow. Food was not impressive enough to justify the slow service. We did order the pickle fries. Those are good. Get pickle fries, a stowaway and then be on your way."}, {"review_id": "DcvBs27Jp9dEVHSacWWU2Q", "user_id": "ifBTJB2BPa3bu_k1OUoU6Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Coconut squash soup was tasty, though the bacon could have been chopped up into smaller chunks.

We came to Red Cow and I was shocked they had Cuban burger on their special. Of course I had to order it. I want to make it clear that I like Red Cow burgers but this one was not good. I seriously think they tried really hard.  The pickle was way too sour and it was a big slice too. The ham was super salty.  Besides all that I  liked their pork meat on the Cuban Burger though. I did not finish it. I ended up eating my fries instead.  We also ordered fish fry with sweet potato fries. It was good. The only thing I liked was their homemade beef jerky. Pretty tasty. All Red Cow locations are always packed, this was my first visit here. So expected to wait about 30 to 40 minutes. It  is located in one of the best neighborhoods in St Paul. Parking is small but you can find street ones. Staff are very nice and quick."}, {"review_id": "jpSSMoIl30XMb8UUB-NFOA", "user_id": "fCc93_Bt7hcPRo4o1SUuxg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "As of my recent visit to Red Cow in St. Paul, I have officially dined at each of their five locations in The Cities. The one on 50th street is meh, downtown Minneapolis has great outdoor seating in the summer, and the happy hour at their newest location in Uptown wasn't the happiest experience for me. I have been to the RC at MSP, but I refuse to review it because it's a conflict of interest (MSP-based flight attendant!)I wrote a review highlighting my disappointment at the Uptown location. I used to live across the street from it...literally. Dustin, the GM, reached out and invited me to return, promising a better experience.I unexpectedly moved to Lowertown, St. Paul. Red Cow was no longer across the street from me, but not too far away. After returning to this local franchise, I must say, the St. Paul location has far and away been the best experience.We were able to make the tail end of happy hour, which was nice. Some of the specials I still consider to be a little spendy, but whatever. Our server was one of the friendliest I've encountered in a long while. She was enthusiastic about the food and engaging with all of her customers. Having been to RC quite a few times in the past, I knew we had to start out with an order of the ahi tuna crisps. They also happen to be the best happy hour app deal. Six never seems like enough, but as an appetizer to a forthcoming meal..it's perfect.My boyfriend ordered the Barcelona burger; one I've ordered many times. He thought it was brilliant. I've been veg-ing out these days, so I ordered the vegetable Rueben. The sandwich was loaded with earthy beets, cabbage, cheese, and creamy Russian dressing on pumpernickel bread. As a Polish girl, there's nothing not to like about that. I would've preferred a few more beets on the sandwich (lots of bites were just cheese n sauce) but otherwise it was a great choice. I know some of you are rolling your eyes at me for ordering a veggie sandwich at a burger joint, but so what. Most of the time, vegetarian options at hamburger diners are really subpar. I need vegetarians to know that the meatless options offered are on point !...Which leads me to the showstopper of the evening...: The soup of the day. I ordered a cup of it as a side to compliment my sandwich. It was described as a coconut curry sweet potato soup, which again includes everything that I love. It was seriously amazing. Like, I could eat a gallon of it. Forget the burgers, forget the drinks, forget the service, forget everything ...but that soup. Who knew ?Anywho, I'm officially a fan of RC again. I spent $100 on happy hour in Uptown....and $60 on two sandwiches, a cup of soup, an appetizer, and 4 beverages here. I left full and happy. Can not wait to come back!"}, {"review_id": "mXeyuxtpGReZIOQyAHsHzA", "user_id": "uoyKo_UM89IqxBlj5fZ_Sw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/19/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "A cow with gills! I'm definitely no stranger to Red Cow and it's no secret to anyone that know's me that I love the food that this culinary team is producing, especially their exceptional burger creations. But, I was consistently going to Red Cow for those signature burgers and always passing on the fish - the burgers are just so darn good. Why would I want to try anything else? What a big mistake on my part! Good sized fillets and the batter was cooked to a golden, crispy and seasoned goodness. Maybe a tad greasy for some, but still a delicious meal. Their tarter really made their fish even more enjoyable. A house made, drinkable, yes drinkable tarter sauce. I used to stay as far away from tarter as I could, but the more house made creations I come across, the more I find myself craving it. A top 10 list inclusion for sure! Oh, and while you're there, make sure you get some Scotch Eggs too! Oh man are their's yummy! #knowbeforeyougo"}, {"review_id": "0heYVtFWoW2kYm9VsLKtPg", "user_id": "HveWFVvoMU4F-O7pWgrfXg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "Yelp reviews sent me this direction while in the area and it did not disappoint.  Sat at the bar for a quick bite - nice setting inside, casual and trendy, but not overly so.  Very good draft beer selection spanning all the styles including a nice selection of dark beers.  Went with the Deschutes Black Butte Porter - a very solid porter selection served from what was a very well dialed in draft system (right temp, carbonation and freshness meaning clean lines and the right PSI).  While the burgers looked good, lent sent me the fish tacos route.  They were very good - lightly fried cod pieces that were not greasy at all, topped with some greens and pickled onions.  A nice sauce added just the right amount of spice.  A very cheery bartender provoked very good service throughout  - a good visit and I will be back for a burger!!"}, {"review_id": "XEaxCldAQwUkk5e-XsqTEg", "user_id": "FtFmC_cYO8NsCItbgEb9sg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Started with fried pickles and cheese curds, both were outstanding. Red Cow's take on fried pickles is absolutely wonderful. Often fried pickles and cheese curds are an afterthought on a menu but it is clear great thought, creativity and execution went into the fried pickles and the delicately beer-battered curds. The selection of beers was also created with great care. The burgers? Spot-on and perhaps as good as any I've had in my lifetime.

An extensive burger list where you really can't go wrong. In this visit, we had the Double Barrel burger and the Turkey burger.

They'd been before and talked it up, but I had never been! I was happy they exposed me to Red Cow! To start, we ordered the Surly Beer Cheese and Pulled Pork Poutine! Either I was starving, or they REALLY hit the spot. It was probably a bit of both! They were gooey and flavorful, especially the pulled pork on top. Though, for the diehards, this isn't really poutine. It's fries with cheese and pork on top. Just so you know what you're getting into.For my meal, I ordered the Blended Burger which had mushroom mixed into the burger and it just... wowed me! I have been a bit \"over\" burgers for awhile. It takes a good burger for me to be happy with it, and this one I really enjoyed. I had the sweet potato fries on the side, I enjoyed them, but they were nothing special. To finish, we had Sticky Toffee Cake, which was apparently new to the menu and it was GOOD. So good, we were a bit surprised by all our first bites. Order this if you go.

Caramelized Bacon Puffcorn!?!? Yeah I just said that, it was so delicious, and even a day or two after still oh so yummy! We were given a lot and it was inexpensive compared to other things on their menu.Not that I'm complaining, but things were a little higher priced, but it was delicious, so I can't really complain. My friend got the Ultimate Burger, which is really a fancy version of a California Cheese Burger. I got the 60/40 Burger, which is a fancy version or a Bacon Cheeseburger. Again, not complaining, because we both agreed we would recommend this place, and definitely eat here again.  It was packed when we went about 230 on a Sunday. The wait was about 30 minutes for two people, but we were told the bar is open and full service. We decided to sit there and snag the two remaining seats at that moment. This was a great place to try, and we are definitely going to go back. A little loud at times, with the bar being crowded, but over all a very nice experience, and fun time."}, {"review_id": "g3nShB-nEZBafEJOOR4g7Q", "user_id": "o51mY5dByTXx5T1TQ3VbLA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/14/2017", "text": "Have dined at red cow for several years and just getting to review now. The highlights are the crazy unique burgers, apps, and large rotating tap beer and bourbon selection. Ahi tuna crisps, hummus board, puffcorn, and Japanese sticky wings are some of the best apps. Any of the cab burgers are excellent, and they will make them rare upon request and come with excellent fries and unique ketchup and sauces. Expert tip is to split a meal with your partner! This allows you to try more things, abd you often end up with more meal in total and can even accommodate different cooking instructions on the split at no charge (think how you want an egg and burger cooked). Portions cab be fairly large.Have also been here once for brunch. Would recommend the chillaquiles, red flannel, bloody Mary and cold press coffee. Or ask if there is a coffee stout nitro on tap.Great local spot, great to have this gem in the neighborhood instead of costellos."}, {"review_id": "XXFvrAfQonPfVZDZm4FjXg", "user_id": "Tn2l9b4W4Yb9eiS_kQRTdA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "Brunch was a really nice experience at Red Cow. Our table dined on Biscuits and Gravy, Chilaquiles, and Smoked Salmon Scramble along with brunch cocktail essentials; Mimosas and Bloody Marys. The highlight was the Chilaquiles, it is a dish that gives you band for you buck and big flavor. For those unfamiliar, think Huevos Rancheros on steroids with hollandaise. The disappointment of the meals was the Biscuits and Gravy, the gravy was watery and the sausage in the gravy was light. It was a cross of the basic B&G you love with a modern take on B&G (which I also love) but it doesn't land. Bloody Mary's and Mimosas did the trick.
