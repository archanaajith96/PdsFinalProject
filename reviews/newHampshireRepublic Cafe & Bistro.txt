I was there with my wife and 2 children. Matt offered suggestions for everyone. Also, since we were sitting near the kitchen, he showed us various entrees as he was delivering to other tables. Several staff members interacted with us throughout our meal and everyone was hospitable.My children enjoyed their flatbread and and falafels, fish and chips were great. Great salad was freshly prepared with a generous slice of feta on top. If you are in Manchester, check them out.

The falafel is really good. Veggie burger was awful. The wait staff is extremely iffy.  We've had some bad experiences with waitresses leaving us for long period while we need something and or waiting on bread/drinks while standing behind us talking for about 10 minutes straight about personal issues with a table behind us. It was quite aggravating.  Another waitress just straight up seemed to be bothered by us being there.  I know it's not the entire staff - I've seen a couple waiters wait there tables in a completely different manner - friendly and attentive. Food is good. The one conversation we had with management was positive but the wait staff always seems to want to be anywhere but waiting your table."}, {"review_id": "6XVlQbBTrS45EQqJ5kHVwg", "user_id": "QAMUxsZ0-atYwfzpKu7hXg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "Very cool menu. We've been to many Greek-inspired restaurants in the New England area but this one is hands down one of our new favorites. The dishes are incredibly unique and even more delicious.

The restaurant had the #1 rating and the menu looked great. We were seated in a booth for lunch and the environment felt cozy.It took our waitress a hot minute to get over to us and we decided to start with the garbanzo taverna with mint and feta. The chickpeas were ok, we couldn't tell if they were soaked or from the can. The mint and feta were barely there and the seasoning was very light. The waitress did not check back at all.Finally, when the waitress came back we decided to get the falafel plate. Whenever you get a falafel plate, you wonder how it's going to come out. This was a bit of a surprise with it's 6 small balls of falafel with chunky hummus in the middle. There was a bunch of undressed lettuce and drizzled tahini sauce that was not plentiful enough.We also ordered the polenta with a mushroom ragu. This dish was pretty good. The polenta was cooked well and grilled nicely. The mushroom ragu had a good flavor but could have used more seasoning. Again the waitress didn't check back on our dishes. It's not like it was even busy. We could see her standing around chatting with other staff directly in plain sight. That's a major no-no.This place was just ok."}, {"review_id": "udMN0RsFwy-qxRWvk0JAHw", "user_id": "2-iZ3lifB5gGWcpP6EgCCw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Fantastic.

We sat towards the back of the restaurant, a little too close to the kitchen for my liking. Next time I'd like to sit closer to the front of the restaurant. The service was excellent. They delivered some really good almost Naan style bread (complimentary) with oil. I had my eye on a couple of the flatbreads on the menu, but my dining partner and I both decided to order off the specials menu. She had scallops and I had a dish with gigante beans in tomato sauce. Both were phenomenal. My first bite was a little cold...I'm just assuming my dish came out too early and sat a little too long. But the flavors were delicious. There was a quinoa (I think--some type of grain) cake with dressed spinach at the center of the meal. It was delightfully light and refreshing when added to a relatively heavy base (the beans in tomato sauce). I appreciate their thoughtfulness in that way. Yum. Although the portions might seem a little light to some, I thought they were perfect. Order an appetizer if you're worried about it. (:I would absolutely return to Republic. I'm dying to try some of the things on their regular menu. I love that they are committed to locally sourcing anything they can. In my opinion, that's something worth paying for."}, {"review_id": "vfcOxOtQN5YYWf-tw_zL0g", "user_id": "6dzzAKFtuweo-uc7FLLI2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/26/2017", "text": "Yummy beat salad and rolled cabbage with rice and lamb.

He was snarky and disrespectful to me when i told him the bathroom had public hair on the toilet, the toilet paper was empty and they were out of cold brew and I wondered if they had more. He made fun of me from a distance with the waiter & another girl. I ordered a spritzer and it contained grapefruit but I didn't order it with that. Asked for another came back with yet again the wrong order. I am completely embarrassed for this place to be recommended to me by so many people. We took home desserts because it claimed to be amazing it was the most dry inedible dessert we threw it out. I would never go back. I am only honest in my reviews & previously was a restaurant manager this would never fly at my business."}, {"review_id": "yPQSTbj0oswWMOSXNXhs7Q", "user_id": "53PjYuZ4KJgiYNUnrG75hQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/17/2016", "text": "I'm honestly quite surprised. Considering the slew of positive reviews, Mediterranean menu, farm-to-table philosophy, and solid drink selection, I thought I would fall in love with Republic Cafe & Bistro. Unfortunately I did not really enjoy my meal. Chef Edward Aloise is a well-traveled individual and that is undoubtedly reflected in his dishes. With items such as Spanish meatballs, Turkish chicken, and the popular Greek doughnut called loukoumades, one could literally pop into the Republic Cafe & Bistro and embark on a culinary journey through the Mediterranean. My father and I opted for the humus, eggplant with tomato sauce and cous cous, and the Kellie Brook ham panini.  -Humus with pita and olive oil: The pita was great! It came out nice and warm and it sopped up their flavored olive oil rather well. Speaking of which, I'm a fan of that flavored olive oil. Interestingly, their hummus was thick and paste-y as opposed to smooth and creamy. In fact, it looked like ice cream at first. Not really a fan of the texture...-Eggplant with tomato sauce and cous cous: The eggplant was breaded and fried. I really didn't detect much flavor with the fried eggplant and found the texture a bit offputting. Additionally, the sauce was also...well...not \"flavorless\" but it longed for something. That sauce felt dead to me. Cous cous was alright. -Kellie Brook Panini: Came with baby swiss, campo sourdough, onion jam, and a poached egg. This was my father's and he didn't really like it.Maybe we ordered the wrong things. I could see myself giving them another chance, though. The menu is interesting enough and their atmosphere seems cool. Maybe their tables are a bit too close to each other (I don't want to be close enough to other customers where I can hear their conversations that clearly), but everything else about the dining space was ok. TL;DR: Loved their dedication to supporting local farms, their menu concepts, and their overall vibe. Despite Republic's merits, the food was not as appetizing as the descriptions led me to believe."}, {"review_id": "zoAWN4HCUnswqwpZTRWlLA", "user_id": "A4YezivT1kw2wF0TGJgKlw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/16/2017", "text": "This place is beyond fab.
