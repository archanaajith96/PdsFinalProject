We had the almond, apple, and chocolate croissants which were amazing, so buttery and flakey. Then moved on to a banh mi sandwich which was light on ingredients but made the perfect combination with the freshest baguette I probably ever had. Bought some additional baguettes to bring home and a steamed pork bun to try. Highly recommend this place!"}, {"review_id": "M9_bDw6MP-x7op9TAOqZjA", "user_id": "hzUyxsPx9j9_Ln8T1giBmw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "My favorite French bread and croissant place!

I had been wanting to try their banh mi for about a year now, but seem to always miss them. Their hours aren't great, but it's doable if you take PTO from work(like some people *cough* me *cough*). I got there around 8:30am, and grabbed a $3.50 banh mi. The owner was so nice, and the croissants looked great, but I needed to focus on my banh mi tour. The banh mi was actually pretty good, but it also helped that it was going for a decent price. I would not have paid anything more than that for this banh mi. The bread was super delicious. It had a nice consistency and flakey the way french bread is supposed to be. Some downs, I wish the banh mi had more meat and vietnamese mayo, and there was an option to have it custom made because I don't normally eat the combo type banh mis or the ones that are already made. Overall, I'm glad I tried it. I might be back for those yummy looking croissants next time."}, {"review_id": "Ei-9y-2iUwdl4mGeXVCmCQ", "user_id": "_KTJ1Et48VHCgHq70B9lyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/15/2017", "text": "Amazing light buttery flaky and delicious.  The best croissants ever!  I love the almond croissant, it's filled with marzipan and covered in almond slices and powdered sugar.

Today, I headed to Trung Nam and my dad was confused as he said 'Isn't it closed?\" Indeed, it does close very early (1 PM) but this establishment is not going anywhere. I'd recommend to visit before work, on the weekends, or like me, take PTO. Trung Nam specializes in bakery and has some of the best banh mi and croissants that I've had in the state. We wanted to sample the store, but limited to ourselves to a several banh mi, apricot, and strawberry croissant (carbs galore). Yummy. There is something about the croissants that leave your mouth watering for more. The bread is fluffy, fresh, and beautifully shaped. I am not an expert on bakery, but know that everything you get here is of quality.Prices are inexpensive (e.g. $3.50 for banh mi, $1.50-2.50 for croissant) and the family operating it are super friendly and welcoming. Overall, this is one of the places that define French-Vietnamese breakfast cuisine and I look forward to making regular visits. Try it."}, {"review_id": "vN9HQImuTb85RUGyn3SLHg", "user_id": "ryt0GszEzZFi6yLlAH_pKA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/20/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We finally made a return trip to Trung Nam to try those croissants. We arrived at about 10am on a Wednesday and they were hopping busy. We got the last spot in the parking lot and cars were still pulling in. We ordered a chocolate. almond and apple croissant. The apple and the chocolate were flaky and buttery however we all felt they could use more chocolate and apple. The winner was the almond croissant as it was slightly crispy on the outside yet buttery and flaky on the inside. There was a sweet glaze on the outside that help balance the rich buttery inside. The crunch of the almonds added a nice texture. Overall I would get the almond croissant again but given the choice would probably still select a doughnut."}, {"review_id": "nyEOJr01ty-ywbtOFfVwJw", "user_id": "R05ZRXWkYuEcvRGok5fiDA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/14/2017", "text": "Take all my money.

Technique on them is perfect.The young guy behind the counter was very kind too. There was a line (I mean, duh, with baked goods like that, no wonder they are busy) and he unnecessarily apologized for the delay.

The most authentic croissant and baguette in Minnesota period! They even follow France's baguette pricing rule of making baguette affordable to everyone, $0.70 (7 inch baguette)! I've been going to Trung Nam for over 15+ years since I was kid. Nothing has changed food wise. I still stock up on the sandwiches (Bahn mi), usually buy 4-10 for the week. Crispy and delicious. Please note they only accept cash to keep prices low, respect it and understand credit card transactions aren't cheap for restaurants. Taste:Crispy and light buttery taste. You can't go wrong with their croissants. I prefer the Strawberry or raisin but most of my family likes the almond which I think is their best seller. Their Bahn Mi is the standard I use when I compare to other restaurants since it's the one Bahn Mi I never get tired of eating. Tip if you save them in the fridge, just toast the sandwich to re-crisp and dip in a little soy sauce to add an extra layer of depth to the sandwich.Food Quality:Consistent to a 'T', delicious and crispy. Made fresh daily. You'll always hear a crunch when you bite into them. Please note, if you prefer sandwiches without the jalapeno just tell them, they usually have two versions spicy and non-spicy already prepared.Restaurant Appearance:Classic and simple French, nothing too fancy. It's a simple shop with food you'll enjoy.Recommended Party Size:1-4, orders are prepared for people on the go.Service:Usually there's only 1 person in the front who takes your order, super friendly people. Pricing:Super cheap, affordable for anyone looking for a simple meal that'll satisfy them. $3.50 for a Bahn Mi and $2.25 for regular croissants. The almond croissants is $4.75, idk why though."}, {"review_id": "i_11lLGBwfZnHo55Gk-5qg", "user_id": "7hTeJL-s83cAcf8ESr6ZHQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/10/2017", "text": "This is 100% the best bakery for fresh and soft croissants - probably the best croissants I have ever had.
