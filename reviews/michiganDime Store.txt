They over charged her $5 and the cashier argued that what she charged was correct, we had to ask for the manager.  My omelet, which i ordered as a scramble, was missing the capers I asked for, I caught that before I left.  When I got to my desk I realized it didn't have the cheese I paid for though.  The poached pear salad one of us ordered had only two little pieces of pear in it and no goat cheese :-(.  The bacon on the bacon parm truffle fries was barely cooked at all.  The eggs in the hash that was ordered were supposed to be over easy, they were over medium for sure, maybe cooked a little longer than that.When you do a carry-out its hard to make these types of corrections once you get all the way back to your desk.  Sometimes my food here is excellent, but sometimes I have an experience like this.  Not sure I'll go here for carryout anymore."}, {"review_id": "9-Mhzg8Z9-OJmYfk-gwjjQ", "user_id": "iKgHft-nhfUu5VWqGe7r9w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Service has gone down the drain here.

I've seen this place get pretty busy but I've been seated fairly quick. The place is quite small, so you're seated pretty close to people. Hey, you might even pick up on some juicy convos. (kidding!)Ok to the food. Started off with spicy korean fries. It was really good, the shaved steak was cooked perfectly. For the main dish I got the cold-smoked salmon Benny. It was delicious! If you don't fancy salmon as much, I wouldn't recommend though. The English muffin was the perfect texture. You can also get the fruit bowl as a substitution side.

The food here is fantastic. The place is very small and seating is limited but I guess that's part of the Dime experience. Every time I have been here I've waited about 30 minutes minimum. Today we tried to beat the lunch rush and came in at about 11, the wait was only 5 minutes. That was a delightful surprise. The service tho, wasn't as good as usual. Our waiter wasn't the nicest and very rushed. I do understand that they're very busy and he was trying to manage all these tables, but really too rushed. Nevertheless, the food was perfect. Sure he was rushed, but remained precise and didn't mess any order up. Between the three of us we ordered omelettes and a chicken sandwich. Which were amazing. The white bread was so light yet coated with some type of oil to make it have that perfect crunch (ugh so good). You can't go to Dime Store without getting truffle fries. So we got a full order for the table. They're amazing. Especially with that aioli dip. I've had that at several places and 100% Dime Store is the best made one yet. (Jolly Pumpkin is second) That full order is definitely a lot to share. The fruit bowl is also definitely fresh and tasty. Being allergic to everything, my ordering can be complicated, but I would say they handled my food allergies very well. The latte was amazing! They were out of coconut milk unfortunately and so I went with almond milk. I usually hate the nuttiness of that in my coffee, but their caramel coated it very well. The cup was pretty strange for a hot latte. I at first thought they messed up and made it cold. Guess that's just how they do it. They validate parking at the Financial District Garage, but only if you enter off of Lafayette. just make sure to ask your server for the card to scan afterwards."}, {"review_id": "oE4pl3JQL3Y8crzZSUt4sA", "user_id": "sp8qDLqrKz1nFQLd3OyAVQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "I went to Dime Store around the time it opened.

Been here multiple times for brunch each time food was fresh, tasted good, hot and creative. The only draw back at times when they're busy, service lags a bit (on the most part our servers we're attentive as possible). I came down on a Friday afternoon for their Porchetta Sandwich, all the ingredients inside the Sandwich complented the Porchetta beautifully the only bump here was the bun altho fresh did lil to complement the whole sandwich it kinda overwhelmed it (too much bread to meat/ingredients ratio) maybe a toasted Pretzel bun or thin slices of toasted sour dough bread, I ended up enjoying it like an open face sandwich (took the top half of bun off). I also ordered the Parm, Truffle & Bacon fries, here they are always on point! Best in town hands down! The saltiness of the parmesan cheese, bacon and the truffle oil (no they are not greasey) on the fries make for a nice balance (here the base aka Fries shine, a thicker cut potato and stays crispy with a mashed potatoe center, Perfect!) I'll always keep coming back if for anything else the Parm Fries alone. My servicer (I sat at the counter) Mike was very informative made a good drink (Tito's & Cranberry lime twist) and \"chatted me up\" which I appreciated(makes for excellent customer service). Only four stars this time around for the bread issue alone, a bit redundant yes but when you take the time to make a Porchetta you need to take the time to present it appropriately.

Reviews were good, and the photos showed good food so I was excited to try a new place down in Detroit. There was a 30 minute wait. No big deal. When we were brought inside I eyed the place and it was pretty cool. Great looks, cozy and good vibes. We did have a run in with a staff member but bygones will be taken care of. One thing I liked about the place was the bar. It could have used more than 2 beer choices but nonetheless a cocktail looked pretty easy up there. Another cool thing was the menu, there's rumor of local farms which is better but just looking at the menu was good enough. It was very eclectic and nice, cool niche dishes. I jumped right on the lamb benny. It was very delicious. Everything was cooked well. Everyone else enjoyed their dishes as well. I would recommend this place as I believe it is one that is going to be there as Detroit surges back. It's in a neat location and brings an awesome flavor to the city. I wish there was somewhere like this closer to my house that i could stop by on the way in to work."}, {"review_id": "U9ZPzfiii1T4jQPp-IY5Kg", "user_id": "dLs5hRZOgJY7yk7WxuEhqA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/12/2017", "text": "Best...breakfast...ever!  Enough said.  For those that have not eaten here, this place is worth driving into Detroit to experience.  Located in the Chrysler building, this restaurant is as hipster as one can get, but this place is not just show. Our table first shared their, \"Melted Belgian Waffle\" and it was amazing: freshly made waffle, soft and buttery, with local syrup that you can tell is the real stuff, not that fake sugary stuff you buy in supermarkets.  The waffle was already cut up into four hand sized slices, perfect for the four of us.My main breakfast entree was \"Cold smoked salmon sandwich\" with fried egg on brioche bun; I opted for their side of potatoes but one can order a side salad instead. This sandwich was also amazing: buttery, light brioche bun with a perfectly fried egg (with crunchy edges - yum!), chive cream cheese, onions, capers and arugula. Although the potatoes look really boring, the taste is really out of this world. They cut up the potatoes into really small, square pieces making them faster to cook and more edges that can be crisped up on the pan.Wish I can say the coffee was also out of this world, but it was decent, light coffee; (I prefer my coffee bold and robust, so it could just be my subjective preference).One other noteworthy thing: the clientele was really diverse. It has been 13 years since I last was in Detroit, and I am amazed at how ethnically diverse the demographic has become, and this restaurant was no exception. As a Filipina-American who grew up in California, that was really nice to see. Last shout out to our waitress, Christina: she was amazing!  Very courteous and chill, with really attentive but non-intrusive service. Much appreciated.  As a yelper who has eaten in so many places, this restaurant is my number one favorite breakfast place. A must eat.  (Note: the wait is usually an hour on the weekends.)"}, {"review_id": "68cUvBvxueIwPtIL42y1rQ", "user_id": "GO9qZlnCbkl-yRj2sW0peg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/7/2017", "text": "We've been wanting to try Dime Store for a while, but due to scheduling issues, we never seemed to make it there.

We waited almost 45 minutes, but didn't mind is too much, as Bon Bon Bon is Also locates just down the Hall. If you must wait, wait with chocolate. Anyways, we did get in and sat at the bar, right in front of the kitchen. Now normally I would be afraid of sitting right in front of the kitchen where they're preparing this much food for this many customers, but this kitchen was on point. I was so impressed by the focus and warp speed that everyone worked with. They were churning out an incredible amount of plates, and doing so with care and precision and teamwork. There was no yelling or panic. Just incredible team work. I was impressed. Next, the device was top level. Yes, the place was insanely crowded and packed with hungry people, but our server gave us his undivided attention and was helpful and never made us feel rushed. He gave great suggestions and was very friendly. The food. Oh the food. I expected the food to be good and e plain the hype, but man. This place knows how to do flavor. Both of us ordered brunch like dishes and were both thrilled with our choices. We devoured our food and neither one of us spoke the whole time we were eating other than \"oh my gosh this is so good. You're not getting any.\" All in all, we were thrilled with Dime Store and can't wait to come back and visit again.

Amazing food, Good vegetarian options (more like eggiterian for breakfast). Weekend street parking is free. Sunday morning Mother's Day breakfast. The place was Super busy. When we went there were at-least 20 ppl waiting. Luckily we were only 3, so we sat almost immediately. . The wait area is comfortable it's the lobby of that building with ample seating. The staff is super friendly and nice. Starting at the front door, the hostess. Who was helping ppl pleasantly even during this busy morning. So the food: The days special - cheese cake and strawberry waffle. - Wow!! Delicious but it's a sin, at least 1 million calories. Lol. It was delicious. I never imagined that combination. But surprisingly superb. We all loved it.  Veggie hash - very good, A bed of crispy cubed potato hash with some sauté veggies, amazing seasoning, topped with two eggs. And a side of biscuit. Perfect dish. Just how I like it. The biscuit was little dry through! Veggie omelet - awesome. Something special about the way they cook the cheese or the type of cheese. Makes the omelette super yummy. Again served with hash and toast. They serve zingerman coffee- I was not a huge fan. But i was ok. They replaced it for a capachino for my wife. They ambience is trendy downtownish. I liked the roman style sketches in the wall and the rustic industrial recycled style furnitures. Basically we loved the place.
