The pho broth is so on point. I ordered a Pho tai bo vien and can't barely finish because of the amount of noodle and meats. Definitely worth every penny. I added a coffee drink with my order. The cafe sua da has a strong taste of coffee to my liking, not overly sweet. I got a few more items to go (not pictured) like Mi do bien - seafood egg noodle soup and Banh Canh do bien - seafood udon noodle soup. Everything so delicious. I wish I had more time to try out other items on the menu, I will stop by when I visit okc again."}, {"review_id": "Vrvkw0fQxzeX_5FXR5e1Cw", "user_id": "tunRUxvabMIHCxxofWAdXQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "An OKC classic. I crave this place once a week! Great quality, great portions, GREAT COFFEE. I wish it opened earlier fo breakfast because pho and ice coffee with condensed milk is how I want to start my day. The interior isn't much, and parking can be limited, especially when this place is busy, and girl does it get busy! Cash only, but there's an ATM right next to where you pay incase you forget. I'm coming back tomorrow. No shame."}, {"review_id": "6DpH3Zu6cAjzyKTRVWQDaQ", "user_id": "A84BDSbdQPdqtvS_DHx62Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Pho Lien HoaThis cash only casual spot on 23rd hits the mark with fast & friendly service and tasty Vietnamese fare. Whether you are a meat eater or veggie eater only, this place has you covered.  Their menu is extensive. They offer pho, vermicelli noodle bowls, rice plates, speciality dishes and kid meals. I've always enjoyed a good bowl of pho here whether it be meatball pho or chicken with quail eggs. I also really love their vermicelli noodle bowl with marinated beef and crunchy spring rolls or their chicken vermicelli noodle bowl. I've gone with large groups before and everyone always leaves satisfied, as long as you order ingredients that sound appealing to you. (They have some really unique menu items that I probably won't ever venture to try). They have several sauces on the tables along with very petite bowls. Be sure to sample the variety of sauces while waiting for your food. Some of these sauces can really elevate your dish. They serve up their yummy food in a very casual family friendly atmosphere. There are a bunch of tables in the dining room and tables can easily be pushed together to accommodate large groups, if needed. You can ask for a fork if eating small slippery little glass noodles in broth with chop sticks isn't your jam. Your server will be happy to give you a fork, no judgement. They are cash only, but do have an ATM on site or there is a Chase Bank nearby if you prefer to get cash from bank ATMs before you head over. They are open 7 days a week and have pretty long hours so you can come by for an early lunch or a later dinner. They are open until 9pm each night of the week. They are also great for take out. Vietnamese on the mind? Give this place a try! ---------May 2018"}, {"review_id": "iIWkNe3RSvUhG8S_t5mi8Q", "user_id": "yGRnqKlnIHjbcodjGJMkug", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/4/2017", "text": "I came in after work for some pho before heading home.  The server took my order and the food showed up shortly after.  That was the last time i saw my server until i got the bill.  The bowl of pho looks delicious but lacked flavor.  Definitely had to add so much just to get it up to par.  The portion was generous and i was full when i left so two stars for that reason. When it was time to pay, all i had on me were my cards.  I never carry cash on me.  This place is a cash only place.  I had to take out cash from the ATM inside their restaurant.  Got hit with like $2.50 convenient fee and then my bank hit me with another $2.50 non bank ATM withdraw fee.  The bowl of pho cost like $9-10.  With the ATM/bank fee, the tip i left, and the price, that was one of the most expensive bowl of pho i had to pay for here in OKC.  So just a note, BRING CASH or you'll get hit with $5 work of fees depending on your bank."}, {"review_id": "k-8E1zzDBQbv4DN5OySwvQ", "user_id": "XmS7Tq1ZM2S-Jq4vVFG3GA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "First and foremost: CASH ONLYThe place seems to be crowded all the time; however, service is very prompt and tables turnover quickly even though the staff does not rush you out. It's a no frills, extremely casual establishment, just how I prefer my Vietnamese restaurants to be. My order of a small bowl of Pho Chin was $7.50, which was the perfect size and so comforting on a rainy day. The ratio of meat to noodle was just right! The highlight of my meal was the spring rolls (cha gio), which is 2 for $2.50. The rolls are long, skinny and extra crunchy. The accompanying sauce (nuoc cham) was a good balance of sweet and savory. You'll definitely want the whole order to yourself. To cap off the meal, I also tried their Vietnamese iced coffee, which was pretty standard and gave me the right amount of caffeine buzz. I will definitely be back next time I'm in OKC for the good food, reasonable prices and laid back atmosphere."}, {"review_id": "CsvnPS_SVVHtUVfzlxD3vw", "user_id": "1JzYj8hWt2sgQEYPHYkIPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "I loving eating here whenever I come to OKC. This restaurant located in a Vietnamese area. They have tons of choice to choose. I personally like the \"Bun Mam\" which is very tasty and flavorful.

Their broth is delicious, and they are generous with the noodles and the meat. If trying pho for the first time, I recommend ordering P11 (Pho Tai Chin) with meatballs (Bo Vien)! To make the broth even more flavorful and delicious, don't forget to add hoisin sauce, a little bit of lime juice, and Sriracha if you like spicy! You also get a selection of herbs as well as bean sprouts that you can add to your pho! For the adventurous, P1 (Pho Dac Biet) is a good choice as well! Service is quick, and the food is inexpensive! The prices are based on the size of the bowl rather than the ingredients you choose to put in your pho (unless you order add-ons), so you're getting a good value! If you don't like/want pho, they also offer many other noodle-based dishes and rice platter dishes. They also have a good selection of Vietnamese smoothies and desserts!Con: They only accept cash, so be sure to bring cash with you. They do have an ATM machine at the restaurant, but there is a small transaction fee."}, {"review_id": "CUc-KopBq7Wri5nOlt_MOg", "user_id": "QPwxfkHZjaFsdLf2b6JIcQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "This is probably the best place to get Pho in the city. The selection of noodles and proteins is so wide, you'll want to come back a few times. The main Pho options come with rice noodles, so they're gluten free. They also have a vegetarian pho with optional tofu. The prices are based on the size of the bowl, and a smallest size was around $8 and too big for me to finish.

It's almost impossible to get a waitress or waiter to the table. I understand that sometimes they're very busy (everyone is here for the same great pho) but maybe it should be staffed better during peak times. The food is still as good as I remembered but it's pretty unfortunate how the service has turned out to be recently.

Service is no good either. They tend to forget about you. Will not check back to see if everything is good. Will just take ur order and you will not see them a second time. No drinks are refilled either. They don't take cards as a form of payment. ONLY CASH. but they do have their own ATM so you can just take money out from there if you ever forget.... The charge I heard was about $2.xX a transaction. MINDBLOWN. WOW. Also don't ask for your check cause you're not going to get one. Lol you will be paying up front at the cashier. They do everything by hand so sometimes they can charge you extra without you realizing it. It had happen to me once. Just for a lookout. Other than that everything on the menu  is pretty decent. Not very amazing. Lol not too fond of the service. Egg rolls are good. Dry egg noodles are the best here. Pho is not good. Hieu tieu is pretty decent the rice plates are good. And the vermicelli is good."}, {"review_id": "Q6Mh-Wst1kJCDMUkVWwN6A", "user_id": "cON8ZWeEfLco6O3h6qeOoQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2016", "text": "Pho Lien Hoa is hands-down the best Pho in Oklahoma City.

Each table has a lazy susan with several sauces and spices to use on the meal (if you need anything besides the broth, etc. itself).
