They have two locations: one in Dundee and one in Flagship Commons. Both locations serve great food, but I prefer the Dundee location due to its atmosphere.My go to order is the Doner Kabob on grilled flatbread with green sauce. I find the green sauce to be the right level of spicy for me. The red is a bit much for me, but on occasion I will get it, and I sweat profusely. This is served with tabouli, pickled red cabbage and carrot chickpeas. I love these sandwiches and probably eat them too much. I've tried a couple of other kabobs around town and theyre nowhere near as delicious as the kabobs at Amsterdam.I've never been to Europe so I couldn't tell you how Amsterdams kabobs compare to those. However, I think its ridiculous to expect the food in Omaha Nebraska to taste exactly like it does in Europe. 5 stars. One of my favorites."}, {"review_id": "QRoYTEi26qBXUUzyI8JXRQ", "user_id": "IxkKMwhl2DmulhWgIWWGFw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "Maaaannn ooohh mmaaan does this get my tastebuds rolllin!!!! What I love about Amsterdam is that it is unique, every plate has more than one flavor, but absolutely explodes with color as soon as you take a bite. Each bite has a little something different but is more than satisfying. FOOD : We got the hummus plate with chickpea patty falafels, and the spicy green sauce with garlic sauce, and curry fries on the side. Like I said above, the plate was full of flavor and was completely savory and worth every minute. The food was fresh and surprised me with how good it was. Would definitely go back! ATMOSPHERE : The location is in Flagship Commons at Westroads Mall. It's actually a very nice atmosphere for a mall. It is really aesthetic and nicely placed. Absolutely loved this place. Great for any casual date, grab and go, or to bring the kids. Would highly recommend! Fast service and good quality."}, {"review_id": "Y10x3gQfA5GPNQ_KyOX-kg", "user_id": "hFuyKEJKdJs0NqACqca-yw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "I have been to Amsterdams several times over the years, with the most recent visit being today. The overall quality of food has stayed consistent and I have enjoyed the Kabobs every time. I got the lamb/beef donor kabob and this was served on a torta style bread with chickpea salad and pickled cabbage + herb sauce. While it is still a bit different than some of the kabobs in Europe, this one is still solid. The curry fries are also tasty.Good value, fairly fast service, and good flavors."}, {"review_id": "UxDXaa_Cm8ZITYQ1yy9aIw", "user_id": "QZPjXnOVZ3TIOneo22K_KA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Walking through the mall during lunch time and wanted to eat something different. I decided to give them a try. I ordered a plate and falafel as my protein and garlic sauce topping. They also added parsley and red cabbage as ingredients. Well made plate and the people working there are very efficient. The curry fries are nice as well with light seasoning. I ordered take away as well two mini falafel sandwiches and feta fries. Overall nice food and great service.

There is a teeny lobby, sandwiched between the menu, the ordering counter, and the door. It's a pretty simple menu for the falafel and kabob dishes. First, you pick a style: sandwich on grilled flatbread, salad on mixed greens, or a plate with hummus. Then, you pick a filling, either classic/spicy falafel or a beef and lamb doner kabob. Last, you add some sauces, including garlic, herb, spicy green, and spicy red. Oh, and of course, don't forget the extras menu, which includes both the regular curry fries and the feta fries!Thankfully, I went with my family on this trip, and we tried every style for you! We had the falafel on sandwich bread, on a hummus plate, and on a salad. I had the spicy falafel on greens with herb sauce and spicy green sauce. The presentation of the food is clearly fantastic. All of the falafel dishes are served with cabbage, couscous and chickpea salad, and tabbouleh. My sister had the sandwich, and while it is advertised to be served on grilled flatbread, she thought it more resembled a sandwich bun. The overwhelming critique was the dryness of the food, namely, a lack of sauce. My salad featured a variety of textures and flavors, but the lack of sauce made it hard to have a balanced dish. My mom had the hummus plate which suffered even more from this problem, the dominance of chickpea wasn't balanced with the curry sauces. The falafel itself was great, crispy on the outside, really large, and flavorful on the inside. But, the lack of sauce was disappointing. Don't worry, I didn't forget the fries! These fries are dusted with curry powder and served Belgian style, with a little teeny fork and ketchup and mayo on the side. My Midwestern palate never thought mayo would be a potential dipping sauce for fries, but it definitely is! We all loved these fries, they are unique and cheap compared to other dining options in Omaha and they are consistently awesome. This is a perfect spot to satisfy a hungry customer. The menu is customizable, made-to-order, but also simple. They have quick service and the prices are incredibly reasonable. The quality of all the ingredients is awesome, but make sure to ask for extra sauce - Amsterdam could spend some time perfecting the ratios of ingredients. Or, you can come here and only order fries. No shame for that, friends."}, {"review_id": "q0GN1eNtJVjnjS1nxz92Qw", "user_id": "YXPhJFHXnsaMS8d6yfYz7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Absolutely my favorite place to grab a falafel, kabob and their truffle fries.

And indeed, we were not disappointed. The menu is simple with quick three steps. Choose your kind ( Salad greens, plate or sandwich), choose your protein( falafel, lamb or beef) and choose your sauce ( herb, green and more). I went for sandwich with falafel and garlic sauce with curry fries. The curry fries were absolutely yummy and I loved the sandwich. Only thing was the sandwich was too big and it was hard to eat for a person like me who is all about taking small bites. Next time if I am here, I will go for a plate option which seemed more suitable for me. But the food is great for taste and quality and it is not very expensive.The staff is good and helpful.

However, below are my reasons for the 2 stars.Cleanliness & Hygiene - This past week I had a 20+ min wait (normal and happy to wait) and hence observed the prep space and food handlers more closely. For example, I noticed how one of the gentlemen with rather long hair (below his ears) only had a baseball hat on. A fishnet style hair net or a pony tail would be more ideal to keep his hair together. The two 'chefs' are also working all aspects of the kitchen including handling of cash, credit cards etc. and cooking. I personally would prefer if they used gloves when handling salad greens, fries etc. This is probably common in most kitchens but given that the kitchen is totally visible here, it stood out more for me. To make matters worse it was 100+ degrees (felt like 115) last week and it was quite warm, stuffy and sweaty inside the tight space with weak  air conditioning. Once again, not ideal for food prep and handling. Also, I am used to my gyro meat sliced off the rotating griller and served on the pita, salad etc. For some reason, here,  the meat was being sliced and then dropped briefly in a deep fat fryer. If some of these changes were incorporated, I am sure I'd be back again!"}, {"review_id": "rpnohOT6TLuwani_qXgTrQ", "user_id": "p1nQdgzvp6_SGPrPpQUEVg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/25/2017", "text": "Totally a fan of this place!! I just love their take on this Middle Eastern food. The falafels were crispy, seasoned perfectly and quite \"meaty\" tasting. The portions were just right. I had the salad with spicy falafels and herb sauce. The pickled cabbage in it was such a great complement to the richer flavors and the tabouli was to die for. All the elements of the salad tied together so well. My boyfriend had the beef and lamb kebab plate and that was also delicious. We loved the curry french fries.

Mc-something or other types)."}, {"review_id": "HNS9EH0IISdAQIBq5juLvQ", "user_id": "t-U0Vmoxe7WpEbeK9YZDtw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "This is for the review for their Dundee location. Get here early if you're going to order lunch because the place gets packed. If you don't find parking right in front - don't get discouraged. Drive on down the street a bit and you'll find ample parking. Definitely get the curry fries (even if you're not a big curry fan). I've had the falafel and the beef/lamb donor kabob sandwiches and both were delicious. I've tried them with the spicy red and garlic sauce. I prefer the spicy red although it might be too spicy for some people - I didn't find it hot at all. The portion sizes are HUGE so take that into consideration. Service is fast and friendly.
