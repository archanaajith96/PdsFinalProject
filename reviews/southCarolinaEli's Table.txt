The staff was extremely nice and helpful since we had a stroller and the restaurant is not super big. The food...THE FOOD...was amazing and I'm not just saying that (look at my other reviews). I split (with my wife) the fried green tomatoes, chargrilled salad and coffee rubbed ribeye...cause diet right?? We both loved everything and the steak was cooked to perfection, it was truly a great meal. A few other members of our party ordered a couple bottles of wine and based on the recommendation of our server which was a hit.We will definitely make a habit of eating at Eli's Table every time we are in town!"}, {"review_id": "F0lIKE3Giqfyu6YbfvVv1Q", "user_id": "hk2Rc23e4VqF-stkHBydUA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Unfortunately the best parts of our meal were overshadowed by an underperformance by the server. An hour into our dinner I received a well done plate of significantly overpriced food. Burnt asparagus covered with a frisbee like piece of cow. The server's attempted recovered was to hesitantly offer to maybe, possibly remove it...if I insisted. The truth is that this was probably a timing issue. We came late and the rest of the meal was very good. Unfortunately, the way this was handled was poor and this is not an example of the food I had heard so much about.In a city of amazing food I was left sitting on a street corner choking down a McDonalds burger. I know I missed a chance to have a great meal with my lady in a romantical setting."}, {"review_id": "S1zzKMsp_mZfDbg9YCzeng", "user_id": "VoHt3x3e7l7z6U2lb5yqXw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "A yummy downtown Charleston brunch spot with a nice outdoor patio and overall great service. I think this place has the potential to be perfect with a few menu improvements and a couple changes in service. My girlfriends and I stopped here on a whim on a Sunday and were immediately seated around 11am. The patio filled up before we got there, and the restaurant as a whole was packed by noon. My only true complaint with the restaurant was the service. Our waitress seemed absolutely clueless at times and took a while in between visits to our table. Thankfully, the managers were awesome. They checked on us frequently and the general manager kept cracking jokes with us. We ordered the lemon-berry mimosas and bloody marys to drink. They were good but a bit overpriced. For food, we ordered the breakfast hash, avocado/egg sandwich, and Eli's breakfast. Eli's breakfast and the avocado/egg sandwich were fine, no complaints. The breakfast hash needed something like added herbs or just salt. The rice risotto just tasted like tomatoes and I think it could be improved for sure. Overall, this location was pretty yummy. It's in a great location as well. I think with a couple improvements here and there, Eli's table could be phenomenal."}, {"review_id": "N-NRHJ15T5ZPLKeqvH3mXw", "user_id": "fRrzNbgjavrgHYrdFU0ohw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "This place has been on my list ever since I moved here. They have a pretty great social media presence, so I'm always liking a picture of a steak sandwich or some brunch cocktails while I'm scrolling. I've always thought of it as a little higher class (well, relatively) but touristy at the same time given their location. That still stands. We were fortunate enough to get a table out back (a patio is always a plus) and we were waited on quickly. The menu has lots of things you'd expect to see on a brunch menu (eggs and bacon and...Gouda grits) along with a few unexpected things (Charleston red rice hash). Just expect to pay a dollar or two more than some other places. ($15 per order) We got the red rice, the classic breakfast, and a side of those Gouda grits. The food was all great, but here's the single reason they dropped from four stars to three stars. We got their bacon Bloody Mary (pushed by the waiter) and a mimosa. And good god when the check came...most expensive brunch drinks I've ever had. $13 bloody and $11 mimosa. Most other places charge that for bottomless. So Eli's Table, you've got a good thing going, but if you're gonna charge me that much for a brunch drink, at least put a little more vodka in it."}, {"review_id": "LyBe_GuAUt7nsiCqvrrYZw", "user_id": "F_xqjAyMw1OPexsJDUF5fg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Absolutely Delicious!

Visiting Charleston in the middle of the week at end of February to beginning March sure had its perks and one of them was low-traffic brunches. Eli's Table has a quaint ambiance with beautiful paintings on each wall. Really aligned with our quick trip getaway vibes.I had the Charleston Red Rice Breakfast Hash. I loved the two over-easy eggs drizzling yolk on to the smoked sausage and red rice risotto. The creme fraiche on top was delicious as well. Boy got the French Onion Benedict which came with two poached eggs, grilled tenderloin medallions, caramelized onions on texas toast with a side of breakfast potatoes - all drizzled in hollandaise.All-in-all a great find and a truly delicious breakfast. Service was quick and attentive even when The Boy and myself were the only customers at the time."}, {"review_id": "TfQt71fLyA-lj1QrKl7cLw", "user_id": "iPN75JUgQ9jvaEz31FADvA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I never write reviews but because of our amazing time at Eli's Table, I decided I will write my first Yelp review.My girlfriends and I had the best time at Eli's Table. Our server was Johnny and he was the best server ever! He kept us all laughing, engaged in conversations with us, gave us great tips about the menu, and brought us champagne on the house! At the end of our dinner, we also received desserts on the house! He gave us tips on what to do for the rest of the night and suggestions on what else we could explore in Charleston on a Sunday night. Definitely 5+ stars for Johnny! What made the experience even better was the food and drinks! The food was amazing. My favorite dish was the Duck and Waffles. It was delicious and the duck was juicy, not dry like many other duck entrees I've tried before. The cocktail I got was \"The Botanist\" and it was amazing as well. Can't go wrong with Gin and St. Germain! My favorite dessert was the Caramel Cheesecake. So delicious!Before we left, we made sure to take a photo with Johnny to document a great dinner experience. My favorite dinner of my weekend trip was definitely at Eli's Table."}, {"review_id": "3MDcer8sd-5OdcmwVZYMvA", "user_id": "P4lxtPFN39xscTMOeLhIkQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/14/2017", "text": "My friend recommended this resteraunt to us we needed to find a dog friendly resteraunt where we wouldn't freeze.

Even though I ordered a dish with seafood I was not prepared for the fishy after taste Usually salmon, atleast to me, does not taste fishy.

They are very appreciative to have your service and welcoming. Ordered the beignets and fried green tomatoes as appetizers. The beignets were small but delicious, the tomatoes were good and paired perfectly with the cheese and sauce. I got the sweet potato pancakes for main. They are very filling so I'd recommend a half portion (2 pancakes) or split the full(4) like I did.  Topped with cinnamon butter pecans and powdered sugar. They were DELICIOUS, some of the BEST pancakes I've ever had! Fluffy , flavorful, thick, and just so good!On the side I got some grits and breakfast potatoes. I'm a potato lover and these were great! They were perfectly salted and had a good texture. The grits were THE BEST ive ever had!

Not sure if it's because of the high expectations I had based on reviews or just a rough day at the restaurant. We were a party of 4 for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. We ordered coffee which took forever to come by. The milk took even longer which was sad. We had no napkins or paper tissues on the table and when asked for them we were told they would be served with our food plates. However when the food arrived we still had no silver ware or napkins. I got the chicken sandwich. It was alright. The chicken was dry. My friends god the crab cakes and liked them. We ordered for dessert and I kid you not it took 30 mins to get us dessert. We enjoyed the dessert and the yogurt parfait. The check took another 15 mins despite a lot of request and walking up to the reception. Overall; the service was poor. Food was a hit or a miss. Honestly if you are visiting Charleston and are debating I'd say visit Poogan's porch instead."}, {"review_id": "dl6In2HAQQ8BgxBAtxYinQ", "user_id": "VWWUgxOomvlUgs9kyaKxuA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "The drinks and food were great but the service was terrible.

Tomatoes were very crispy. Cheese was on the mayo-y side, cut with the sweet tangy balsamic.Fried oyster sliders (4 stars): with a broccoli based slaw that was really refreshing. Oysters were well fried and tender. Came with 2-3 small oysters on each of 2 small slidersForagers salad (3 stars): with kale and blackberries. Decent salad, although massaging the kale could have improved it's texture significantly.Key lime \"pie\" (3 stars): it was like a dense dulce de leches cake flavored with key lime. Interesting take but was overall a bit too dense and sweetService: I get it- no one wants to be working Christmas Day. But the hostess was not particularly warm and accidentally gave away our reserved table to the only other Asian couple who were waiting for bar seats. Once we got to the bar though, the bartender was really nice and even split our shared salad into 2 plates without asking. The overall feel is what New American cuisine was in the 2000s, but well executed."}, {"review_id": "AdltS8aXhJTMTbN7OgdpdQ", "user_id": "2U4t-rA5AY2gq08x7wRghQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Worst shrimp & grits ever and far to expensive compared to places that actually k ow how to cookAmbiance just so so"}, {"review_id": "ry62KPXeBpKXOYDgTqR9pA", "user_id": "sDZ4vvKthUUNgqU926VhMQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "My friend and I came here on our last rainy morning in Charleston after a crazy fun weekend! Eli's was close to our hotel and it was pouring so it was super easy to run a block from the Mills House Hotel. We were able to sit outside even though it was raining because their back patio is still covered. It was a Monday morning and the restaurant was pretty quiet when we arrived. Even still, our waiter easily convinced us to order a carafe of the \"best peach bellinis\" because we hadn't consumed enough alcohol over the rest of the weekend, we said sure! The menu was amazingly delicious and our waiters \"favorites\" were not what we were eyeing to order so we went with our guts. We started with an order of beignets because YOLO, when in the south, right? They were good, but they were no, New Orleans good. However, the Avocado Toast Egg sandwich, albeit messy, was unreal. Everything you could want, and on a croissant! I was on vacation, so it was calorie free too. My friend ordered the French Onion Benedict. She swapped out the poached eggs for scrambled. When I tell you it was the most beautiful brunch dish that I've ever seen, I'm not joking. She struggled and gave her best effort to eat it all, but it was too big and simply could not be done. We left Charleston satisfied and in a food coma, thanks to Eli's Table. Definitely would recommend this place!"}, {"review_id": "tM3_6vz8qAY1-adPzIfdnw", "user_id": "PIniBYZGBFBa72cJmUD3Cw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "We had an a pretty good brunch here.
