I usually love large breakfasts, but I surprised myself today by going for a quickie. Walked around the corner from the Biltmore, and stopped in here. The baked oatmeal tasted like a pastry or cake, in the best way. I took a bite of my wife's kale feta croissant and it blew my mind. It was delicious in a way kale has no right to be! Her latte was not too sweet, and my coffee was brewed delicately. Not sure what blend it was, but definitely non-acidic, a good one to grab first thing.There was a steady stream of customers, but they nonetheless filled my to go order in a no-nonsense and courteous fashion. I would return for sure."}, {"review_id": "COjhZztQSPydhhLwdXSdCQ", "user_id": "CIZGlEw-Bp0rmkP8M6yQ9Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "This clean cut(e) little bakery goes a bit beyond its upper middle class moms who quick lunch with items like pork belly sandwiches and ginger cookie sandwiches with lemon creme.. The place feels conscious of itself, in a smart college way.  It seems to take itself seriously with its smart menu and carefully behaved above average staff that feels like t might have catered a million high maintenance baby showers. I almost got a pastry that was dipped in chocolate and filed with hazelnut pastry creme but it was 5$.   The central downtown location makes a good pitstop for good coffee and above average snacks. That ginger cookie sandwich rocked my world, with just right oozing of delicious lemon creme."}, {"review_id": "HYlHethubyJVNRjf97xOjQ", "user_id": "mmiSQ_UtTETmtjmx6m2eHQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "Struggling with wedding favors, not wanting to burden our guests with something they don't necessarily need and/or would just simply collect dust over time, perhaps end up in the trash, the folks at Ellie's Bakery had just what we were looking for. Both of us connoisseurs of macaroons, Ellie's has a great line up that met our wedding theme of showcasing the flavors of the season, in this case between Summer and Autumn, as well as that of Rhode Island. Able to produce the macaroons in our wedding colors plus provide recyclable, firm-plastic packaging that would allow our far-away guests to easily transport the macaroons home, our wedding favors turned out to be a big hit such that the favors left on our sweet-heart wedding table were swiped. We had to ask some of our local guests to return one to two of extras that they had taken just to get a taste of the sweetness that Ellie's makes. Highly recommend, be sure to check out their monthly macaroon line-up for ideas. Folks at the bakery are quite accommodating, awesome, and willing to spend as much time as possible listening to your needs."}, {"review_id": "JT53R94782oZFYD2FuUkGA", "user_id": "j3y978-sbppUCOIqgntdmg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Waited twenty minutes for the small breakfast sandwich that came with definitely no tomato jam :(can't believe it.

Easily one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. Everything from the warm, soft, buttery English muffin, perfectly cooked egg, salty Canadian bacon and topped off with their absolutely delicious tomato jam, perfect. The tomato jam is a game changer. It's a slightly sweet, slightly tangy better version of ketchup, just delicious. I'm only here for 2 days on business but now I know I have a go to breakfast spot on my next trip. Didn't get any but their homemade baked goods look amazing too. May have to swing by on my way home and grab a few for the family."}, {"review_id": "82OotqQXXKoPD-fJlTgUuQ", "user_id": "_Ah7xsFhGnZt8B2VeUvd0Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Great bakery to visit while in the Providence area.

The place was cute and quaint, and had a decent selection of many items. I settled on a mushroom quiche and cappuccino. For desert, I had a little chocolate muffin, which tasted like a brownie. I thought everything was pretty good and reasonably-priced. The service was a little slow, and they forgot to give my friend her meal. The place was a little tight squeezed and just seemed busy and loud. Nothing stuck out in my mind as anything I couldn't live without."}, {"review_id": "RsspCZWIGOXsn0LgsaXb0g", "user_id": "NAH8YYMRDszNoZq0IagTlQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/16/2017", "text": "Cute little bakery in a great location on the main drag of Washington street. Variety of pastries available such as chocolate croissants, honey glazed whole wheat bread, canelés, and other delicious bites. Hot food available for order to eat-in, great for breakfast, brunch, lunch, or a quick coffee and pastry to-go order on the run. Table seating outside is nice, especially if you have a 3+ group or more and want to face each other while eating (tabling inside is mostly bar-like seating against the wall and window). Venue is a bit on the small side so finding a seat is often a challenge, and trying to order with those waiting for their orders to come out makes for a tight squeeze at the entrance and around the side of the counter. A bit on the pricey side, you'll pay about $24 for a dozen macarons, but there is definite novelty in the flavors: irish cream, lavender, matcha, etc. Nice place to snag a small gift with cute and local flare. They have misc jams, jellies, spreads, packaged chocolate, and truffles for sale."}, {"review_id": "VgtDKiPJzCdt9H9B4uO4Lg", "user_id": "D3tlA4HCVuPZNImT-bSNsA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Delicious creativity meet at Ellie's. It should be named Ellie's Bakery Heaven. What a wonderful experience to start my day. I have been wanting to try this place every time we've been in Providence,  and this was better than I had ever hoped. I am a pastry / baked goods fanatic and unfortunately way too picky.  At times that can ruin my experience and enjoyment. Ellie's filled every pastry point I desire. The flakey yet moist burst of flavor with a crunchy exterior (what?)... A glaze that isn't so sweet that it overpowers the overall taste. How did I never make it here before? I won't be missing a chance again.  Thank you Ellie's"}, {"review_id": "81xhiHY9UAB87YEJapfGDg", "user_id": "tfBdA1jELmlYs_g61QeHLQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2017", "text": "This cute bakery/cafe/coffee shop is a quick pit stop location, if you simply want to grab some baked goods, a cup of coffee or a bag of coffee. I walked in because the macaroons called my name.  We had the Irish coffee and because it was St. Patrick's day we got one for free. We also got the coconut leche and matcha red bean. The macaroons were slightly chewy but good. The best was the Irish coffee.  For the matcha red bean, I could hardly taste the matcha or the red bean. The coconut had shavings of coconut in it which gave it texture.The crown jewel is the wooden carved hen in front of it.

It's sort of retro meets home.   they have giant mugs for your coffee that just makes you want to curl up on a sofa (gripe no sofas just high tops). Ps their house coffee is delicious. No macaroons compare to laduree or Angelique but this place comes close. They have great seasonal flavors. Like Kentucky pie. Apple cider. Chocolate peppermint. A bit flakey at times but always a good amount of chew. The cream piped into each is lightly sweetened and gives a nice consistency to each bite (especially if you end up with a slightly overBaked one). I always like to poke in to see what's on the menuAnyway as far as savory foods, Their pork belly sandwich is stellar. Thick cut of porkbelly between fresh ciabetta.
