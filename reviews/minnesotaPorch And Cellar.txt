I've been twice so far. First by my lonesome - but I wasn't lonely thanks to the great Irish bartender (who's name has slipped my memory) who's cordiality was a blessing. The second time I brought family - I am proselytizing unofficially as a Porch and Cellar devotee and semi-officially as an Ordained Dudeist Priest. Did I hear a wedding reception dinner bell on the front Porch?I can without reservation recommend the fried chicken in any number of ways it is served. I would imagine everything else is fantastic as well. I've had the chicken both times I've been there. Time to go back, try something different, and thank the Almighty Dude for a restaurant that really ties Rochester together. This dude abides when it comes to proclaiming the Good Brews brought to you by the good folks at Porch and Cellar."}, {"review_id": "-zYrFBDs-V2TeUxEx45Y3Q", "user_id": "aU6YBBZZmREajVLKFsriLw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "My family went here for Sunday brunch.

We went for lunch, it wasn't crowded, seat yourself style dining. I ordered the Kale salad, with green goddess dressing, and grapes. It was actually quite delicious, although I'll admit I'm a huge fan of kale in almost any form. I also ordered two pieces of their fried chicken, with a biscuit and their honey butter. Wow, biscuit was perfect and the honey butter will gave you coming back again. My husband ordered the turkey BLT with mashed potatoes. The bread was crisp, the bacon crunchy, and the mashed potatoes savory.This place is really fantastic. It feels like homemade Southern cooking. Even the inside will make you feel like you've been transported to another place. A note about the cellar part of the restaurant. Downstairs they offer a bar area that has the feel of a speakeasy. It looked really cool, even though it wasn't open at this time of day. Definitely put this place on your list of places to try."}, {"review_id": "R3vqn9is5w8RtAFjyHX0Zg", "user_id": "mhiG7sp5vM9ORV6kTZcX2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "UNFORGETTABLY AMAZING!! That is the best way to describe porch.  Espresso rubbed BBQ pulled pork, freshly made biscuits with honey butter and a fried chicken plate that isn't greasy, rather it is perfectly crisp without being hard or dry. I don't normally choose BBQ but this place was right across from where I was staying so we decided to give it a try.  Friendly service, warm clean atmosphere and a nice choice of beverages alcoholic as well as non.  Give it a try but make sure you save room for the oatmeal ice cream and apple pie."}, {"review_id": "7DmvpR3AHe_sfMI94ilOAA", "user_id": "g-Xna86QPWi7GUoHKPBCYg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/3/2017", "text": "Finally got to check this place out. I'm just going to list out what we ordered and go from there.Corn fritters - This is a fried ball of corn pudding. It was good but also expensive for what it essentially is.Fried chicken - It was good. Not out of this world like others say. The chicken was tender and the honey butter gave it that extra 'something' smeared on top of it (my wife ate the leftover honey butter with her spoon so apparently she REALLY liked it).Cold mac and Crack - macaroni salad with fried chicken batter sprinkled on top. Again, it was good. If you like macaroni salad, I would recommend it.Justins cowboy potatoes - essentially doctored up hashbrowns (I know there is more to it, but that's the best I could come up with). I wasn't a huge fan of this but my wife really liked it and has ordered it in the past.If you see a common theme here, it's that everything tasted good... but nothing blew my socks off. I thought the food was kind of expensive, so I don't think I will be in a hurry to come back again -- but I am definitely open to giving it a other try at some point in time. The atmosphere was very nice and service was great too. This place is really close to 4 stars for me."}, {"review_id": "40jVrdP4mTVSGVn-aYTFEA", "user_id": "36csViAqVU_CDkFNN3ySOw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Stopped in for lunch today and had the meatloaf sandwich (sans the bread), spicy broccoli, and the prime rib and Gouda soup. Everything tasted amazing, but I can't say enough about the spicy broccoli! Lemon juice, red pepper flakes, garlic, oil and some other ingredients I couldn't identify blended together perfectly and the broccoli itself was lightly cooked, with plenty of crunch. I recommend the soup as well, creamy and flavorful.

Get it otherwise there is no point in coming. I've had a lot of fried chicken before and this place is up there with the best, if not the best I've ever had.  There brisket is also very tender and flavorful.  I love their biscuits and honey-butter.  I'm not a huge fan of all their apps and sides. The corn fritters are good but taste a little odd. I wish the Mac side was hot.  The Cowboy potatoes though are tasty-they are kind of like cheesy hash browns. The coleslaw and chilled BBQ carrots are great! The feel of the place is cozy and casual. It's really nice to sit outside in the summer evening and inside in  when the weather gets cold.Cellar: I had been wanted to go to the Cellar ever since it opened and I was happy with my experience. The abundance was cozy and trendy, which I really enjoyed. There isn't a lot of seating, similar to the upstairs (Porch) but it worked.  The menu is not set up family style and is less focused around fried chicken and BBQ. I liked the Curly Fries, especially the sauce that came on the side with them. I also tried the Chicken wings. The meat was very tender and the outside was perfectly crispy. I wasn't the biggest fan of the sweetness of the sauce but it wasn't bad by any means! The herb yogurt/mint dipping sauce was a great complimentary. I also split the \"God Bahn Mi.\" It was a sandwich with shaved prime rib, some Asian veggies, jalapeño (I think it could go without), sauce and a over easy egg (love).  FYI the habanero aioli is quite spicy. I didn't try it but I was told that the Fried Chicken Sandwich is the same fried chicken was upstairs (super good) so I'm sure that's a great item as well."}, {"review_id": "Ul8xAvKzP4_CsLgxC9Zksg", "user_id": "NvDrK2fvNlRfOOMMEoAFCg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/26/2017", "text": "I had very high expectations for this place given the reviews, particularly of the fried chicken. It. Outshone. All. Expectations. PARTICULARLY the fried chicken. I wasn't even really craving fried chicken - and genuinely this is the happiest I've been in a very long time.For a place this well known it was exceptional how fast we were seated since we just walked in (didn't even use the online waitlist which is a cool feature). Service was quick and very friendly which already sets a good scene.The fried chicken is the best I've ever had. Hands down. Which surprised me in Rochester, Minnesota, but hey. The coating was crispy, not soggy or dripping with grease, and the chicken inside was perfectly moist and juicy - no idea how they managed to work that magic but I am all for it! We got the family style 8 piece to share and between 3 of us, along with 4 separate sides, it was perfect, particularly with the biscuits. The honey butter is a match made in food heaven to both chicken and biscuits too. Genuinely euphoric after the meal.As far as sides go - Green beans A+, Brussels sprouts and beets both get a solid A, mac n crack (although admittedly I'm biased as I'm not a mayonnaise fan) A-. Pimms pitcher was the most delicious summertime beverage complement as well, perfect for two people sharing (one of us wasn't drinking).All in all I wish I were in Rochester longer just so I could frequent this place.

She went to get drinks, and then returned to tell me they only had a mint or fruity tea. No black or green.... So, water for me. We ordered the chicken sandwich with mashed spuds (very good, very hot when it arrived), and the meatloaf sandwich (way too much Caraway seed in rye bread, but good flavor, good tempature. )  Not too much attention from waitress, clearly a hipster place with their strange pairings.

That is all I can say. I have traveled around the country and have ate some of the nations top restaurants. This place is some of the best food I have ever had. Rochester is fortunate to have such amazing food in this town. Upon entering, we could smell the amazing scents of fresh food. Once inside we were greeted immediately and placed upon a wait list for a table. This was expected and we decided to stop up at the bar for a drink. The four of us were seated soon after. We ordered fried chicken, multiple meats, and sides. All of the food tasted fresh and cooked to perfection. The portion sizes were large and fed our table plentiful with multiple leftovers. My favorite part of the dining experience was the multiple jams, sauces, and spices. All of this only added onto the perfect food experience. On top of this, we received some phenomenal service from our Server, Mattie. She made recommendations on food and was extremely friendly. Also, beer is made available by the gallon (amazing). I recommend ordering all of your food as a family style. You can share what you like and sample multiple menu items as a group. The location is open at 4 pm daily, so make sure to get out there early to ensure a spot at a table.

All good signs. Then we talked to the hostess and it was the weirdest interaction. She asked if we wanted to sit in Porch or Cellar, we decided Porch and then questioned if seating was available sooner in Porch. They are in the same building but separate menus, so we decided to stay with Porch. She kept telling me that yes, I was at Porch. I understood that...I wanted her to find me a table. Finally my fiancee sorted her out. We were told it would be 10 minutes and wanted to grab a drink at the bar while we waited. It was a good choice, it ended up being a half hour wait. The bar and drink menu was just average, the old fashion served neat and warmed quickly since it was served without a large ice cube. We ordered the deviled eggs, the fried chicken, the crack and mac, the cowboy potatoes, and the meatloaf patty melt. The deviled eggs were okay, the egg white getting very hard. The chicken was just average. Growing up in the Midwest, borderline South, I like to believe I know what good fried chicken is. The boneless chicken breast (which is weird, why don't you serve whole pieces of chicken?!) was  better than the chicken leg and was made better with the honey butter melted on top. I've had much better at places a mere 70ish miles away in the cities. The cowboy potatoes are run of the mill hashbrown casserole reheated. The best part was the meatloaf sandwich. It tasted like it was also smoked and if I were to come back, I would forgo the chicken and get the meatloaf.Overall, it's just average. I would come back if someone else wanted to go,  but I wouldn't put it at the top of my list."}, {"review_id": "tVyrEI1WAKhHIyFnvmly7A", "user_id": "xwGSlbBAz2_FBiRB_N2wYQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/14/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "They are officially offering brunch every weekend now.
