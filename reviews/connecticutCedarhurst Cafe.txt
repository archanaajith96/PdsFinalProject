Egg sandwich is everything and the cappuccino was perfect! The coffee: The temperature was perfect. The coffee was not bitter at all. They actually knew how to steam the almond milk to make it frothy and delicious; most places over steam and burn. Egg sandwich: I got an egg and cheese on an English muffin with avocado. The egg was cooked perfectly. The cheese was melty and melded perfectly with the added spices. The muffin was not soggy or too crispy. The place: Great vibe, great music. Not too loud, not too busy. It wasn't terribly difficult to find parking. The staff was pleasant and delivered our food and drink quickly. I did not have the same experience as previous reviews. We found our new weekend spot!"}, {"review_id": "shUl61YBWka4XzIT9m1ljA", "user_id": "18lwedcQL0pVNKlwm_BMpg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Cute cozy, little side-street cafe in New Haven close to the University. Tried it on a sunny,winter Saturday morning with a light student crowd. Coffee was very good and the panini style egg sandwich was a real treat too. Perfect place for anyone looking for a quick continental type breakfast. Lunch menu looks great too with many sandwiches and wraps. They do have WIFI but I didn't bother asking for the password."}, {"review_id": "8ODfT-0BtVpYhqa2bqTZdQ", "user_id": "lpNJVV3gFvKcQWGaXA1zgA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "I'm very upset to rate this place 1 star, I won't lie this place has great coffee and great food. I work at Yale new haven hospital, 15 co workers of mine wanted to order smoothies and coffees during our busy work day. We ordered at 3:55pm the cafe closes at 5pm. Our total came to $120, we received a call from Grace who said she had to cancel our order because they don't take grub hub after 4pm (even though we still called before 4) I don't know any type of business who turns down money. Made the business look bad not to mention not care about their customers satisfaction.Not nice Cedarhurst, you guys declined $120 & made 15 excited medical staff members hangry! Thanks a lot!"}, {"review_id": "-1OeF3JGXlW9VHFx9Sw1mQ", "user_id": "V4VYZ2CohgjOJJzi0FGX6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Wonderful people in a wonderful café.

Very cute and comfy aesthetic with nice service. I ordered a plain Belgium waffle, along with a tropical something (can't remember the exact name) smoothie with a yogurt base. These items, understandably,  took a tad bit longer time to make than the rest of my families egg sandwiches and coffees but it was still pretty fast. The waffle was tasty but I really enjoyed the smoothie. If I am ever in New Haven again, I will return to the Cedarhurst Cafe!"}, {"review_id": "W8qngyv4kQrzBnFxvlk3-A", "user_id": "Rf6aiS-w3kNCA5UWjI1ojg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "One of my favorite places to write.

Came here to study and I really enjoyed my time here. They have a nice selection of pastries (muffins and bagels) and even a few gluten free options. I didn't try and of the food, but they offer breakfast and lunch options as well as smoothies, coffee, tea, and açaí bowls. I ordered a preset smoothie (you can create your own and there are A LOT of choices) and I quite enjoyed it. It was 7.00 for a small signature smoothie (not including tax and tip), which although pricey was worth it because of how long I stayed at the cafe. I didn't see a LOT of outlets here, but there are definitely a few around in case your laptop is dying. The best part about the place is the yoga balls that you can sit on while you work. Truly helped keep my posture good during my time working and also was just a lot of fun. They have the radio on in the background, but no loud music so that it's a pretty quiet environment. Very productive space!"}, {"review_id": "tsdme9QMLL3i2I8Q2mYUwQ", "user_id": "z03iTOSGVPox3JxAs41yLA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "This place is your typical cozy coffee shop (not in a bad way). It's got a more modern feel though. For example, they use yoga balls as seats for some of the tables. Another unique aspect of this place is that they allow dogs! Prices are a little high and service is a little slow. But all in all, not a bad place to grab a coffee and hang out with your (or someone else's) dog."}, {"review_id": "nvn75--8I0UIDRdDRZdOFQ", "user_id": "TVLPtacyHBLpl8Qqjn9Ojw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Kind of a hit or miss. You will almost always need to wait at least ten minutes for a drink. The chai lattes are watered down half the time, the other half they're pretty good. The inconsistency is frustrating because you don't really know if the food/drink is worth the wait. And with prices as they are, you'd expect to have consistently good food and drinks. Atmosphere is cute and they allow dogs so that's cool."}, {"review_id": "hU9dPrDPmIN7LwainH70wA", "user_id": "H_U19Ls7CElAJ2YXvBSZHw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I really enjoyed my experience at CH. I'll start with the parking. Street parking. Suggest you use 'Go NewHaven' app to park. Allows for you to enjoy your time in new haven without concerning yourself with parking. Location is nice. Not many surrounding places open early like CH so congestion not an issue. The people were very nice. They care about their food, cleanliness and customers. The bathroom was very clean. The store was very clean. All their messaging was clear. Signs to help out customers help them. Dirty dishes, wait time expectation and pricing/branding. I got the waffles with strawberries and cream, BEC on bagel and light roast coffee. Very good food. All fresh ingredients and the saltiness and sweetness were killer together. Coffee was good... not great. But with coffee it's preference so nothing to hold them to there. Would go again. Looking forward to trying their banana Nutella waffles."}, {"review_id": "P89lmePlBxpiqwLpSoq9TQ", "user_id": "cViR4D08GYvigj9KjyG70A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Only two days in New Haven and I already got a \"regular\" badge for my check-ins here.

My girlfriend even had a minor issue with one of her orders and the staff didn't hesitate to compensate her with a new one! A perfect representation of what great customer service looks like.

The decor and the menu looks at variance to other cafes. The price is a little high but could match for the quality of the food being served.I tried the Belgian waffles with Nutella, banana n whip cream! Amazingly delicious everything was gone in a few minutes! I also got an almond latte... Omg so creamy n delicious...My husband had a plain bagel sandwich, it had cream cheese, onions, tomatoes! He said he liked it! Good big sized bagel! They had three to four variety of bagels..And for my little one, he got a carrot muffin... He loved it so much n he ended up finishing the whole thing, where I just got one bite to taste. Huge size n heavenly things loaded in there like the coconut, carrots, cinnamon, raisins... Yum.. Reminded me of Indian plum cake!I also saw many orders of the avocado toast, will try it next time!Would love to come back again."}, {"review_id": "KWd18tKJucF9GfDO14Qodw", "user_id": "4YemMsrI26nkSCrbvxNagw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/20/2017", "text": "A cute shop to drink and do some work in. I only stopped by to get their nitro brew so I wasn't able to enjoy their work spots and cool bouncy ball chairs. The nitro brew wasn't outstanding but it wasn't horrible either. It was a well balanced iced coffee and not acidic at all which is a plus! If you have work to do, this place seems like a quiet place and everyone around were doing their work.

My wife and I stopped in here one morning on a weekend when we were in town and were not disappointed. Seems to be a largely student-driven crowd coming through here but everyone was quiet and respectful; maintaining a study-friendly, work-conducive environment. The staff was friendly and helpful. The prices were decent. The decor was modern-industrial-hipster. My wife had coffee, I had apple-spiced chai, and we both had prosciutto/egg/cheese on a croissant. We had a lovely time. Great place for a quick and tranquil breakfast or a long, slow, burn with some studying/work to do. We would return if in the area again."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/cedarhurst-cafe-new-haven?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
