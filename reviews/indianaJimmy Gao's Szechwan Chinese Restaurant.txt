You've found it right here at Jimmy Gao's!They rolled out the red carpet for our group of 6. We dined family style while enjoying two bottles of wine, 2 apps, and 4 entrees. All in before taxes you're looking at $150 or so. For all that, I would consider that a steal being the food was amazing and so was the service.This is a well-known establishment to Evansville. Moveover, the local following is well deserved. It's no wonder they've been in business for so many years! If you're lucky, maybe you'll run into Jimmy himself.

Good Szechwan is hard to come by, and this place is very authentic. Ate here a few times now and never had a bad experience. It's definitely the best Chinese food in I've had in Evansville, by a long shot. Go around lunch time and you get an entree, rice, soup, crab rangoon, and spring roll for like $7, really great deal.Highly recommend the mapo tofu, it's the best I've had anywhere."}, {"review_id": "rFrUnWq0fZp_c1h04Pnijg", "user_id": "vZDl4ZM5W3WjyIV4z8mBUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2017", "text": "The best Chinese food in Evansville hides in an unsuspecting strip mall by ChuckECheese.

This place is a gem, and I never even knew about it until today. (thanks yelp!)I got a variety of things to take home so I could give this place a fair shot, and hoped it would live up to the hype, and oh my god, did it ever. I ordered the dumplings, the chicken fried rice, and the empress chicken. Dumplings were the best I've ever had.Chicken fried rice was really nicely cooked and tasted so fresh. Empress Chicken is my new favorite thing.  Breaded white meat chicken, with mushrooms and broccoli and a slight kick. I got take out, and it was so much food. They really give you a lot here. All of it is so fresh, and so great tasting, I can't say enough great things about this place.The customer service was excellent. Such nice people, and totally willing to help you find the perfect dish. Really welcoming environment, full of really nice people.I am sure to be back, and I encourage all of you to check out Evansville's little hidden treasure. I'm so mad I didn't find it sooner."}, {"review_id": "l07peFUjt1-XmlHNI08a2Q", "user_id": "iu9weawrXuh0e9-erNwaYg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2017", "text": "Excellent!  This was our first visit and we were very pleased with the quality of the food.

Man 'O Man......is it NOT now. We all hate it after tonight. Jimmy sold it a while back and it has steadily slid downhill ever since. Tonight, after a long day at the office, I decide to call in a carry out order. I go in and pay around $30 for one meal, some dumplings and extra rice. We get home and no rice. I try to call them and now they refuse to answer the phone. I let it ring forever. Then we decide we will just cook some rice at home (which will not be the same). The honey sesame beef if so tough that we can barely chew it. It tastes old and reheated or something. The soup was ok but my son got to the very bottom of his bowl and...I kid you not.....a small roach is floating in it. I try to call again....no answer at 6:30pm. The two guys working there tonight must still be thinking of the $50k they all won in the lotto last week (a big copy of the ticket is at the register) and not their customers. I hope that cash lasts them a while because if this is how they are with customers, this place won't last much longer.

Without doubt best Chinese I had anywhere in the Americas or in Europe. Hard to believe that we have such great Chinese restaurant in Evansville. In the end when get your bill, you'll be happy. Still no cheap buffet here; if you want quality come here if you want quantity then you better go to one of the cheap belly busting Chinese buffets that are sprung all over the tristate."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/jimmy-gaos-szechwan-chinese-restaurant-evansville-3?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
