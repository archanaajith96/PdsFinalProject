Their calamari appetizer is great and the mopu tofu is very authentic, smooth and creamy. They will make it as spicy as you want. The red pork sweet and sour was quite good, not cloying or stiff. The Jin duis (sesame balls) are unique for this area and done authentically.We find their seasoning is refined and cooking style to our liking. Service was very good as we ate an early Valentines' day dinner. Bet it is crowded later. This still rates as the best Chinese place in the area"}, {"review_id": "OXk-1ZwvfaRb6iFyqm43Jw", "user_id": "6wd2YRPbmK91g9r8V5Xxew", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "I have to say, this us probably the best Chinese restaurant I have tried in Meridian/Boise area.  However, still a bit disappointed.They offered 2 menus.  One of them has more specific Szechuan cuisine, and dishes Chinese people like more.  I looked at both and ordered Garlic Shredded Pork which was great!  I also ordered Chow mein with pork, stir fry rice noodles, and my favorite Chinese vegetable dish - dry sautéed greenbeans to go.They are alright.  The greenbeans dish is good, but I realize they use lots of soy sauce in every dish, including my greenbeans dish.  So at the end, they all tasted the same.The service was descent.  I was not offered the fried wonton skin chips.  Not sure if they forgot or they thought I was too Chinese to have it?  I love those chips!Parking is kind of hard, especially during lunch hours.  The shopping center has lots of 30 min. parking spaces, but many stores such as tanning salon and restaurants.  How many people do eating or tanning in 30 min.?  Regardless, this is by far the best Chinese food I have had since I moved out here.  Perhaps, I will try other dishes next time to see if there's still lots of soy sauce."}, {"review_id": "rscYEnszZsalXXf3WNdfew", "user_id": "u19zEK9boYM-OWuaz_HXNQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "Definitely better than I thought it would be.

As someone who is seriously watching every calorie in, this place has great low carb options-- protein and veggies with a little sauce (sauce never hurt anyone... or did it)?!? Walking in the place seemed small, nice, and clean. Everyone was friendly. The order taker came almost immediately, pen and notebook in hand, ready to take my order. She was new and I thought it was sweet that she was so attentive, but I didn't get the menu open yet. Another server brought fried wonton chips and sweet and sour sauce. They had three different servers on staff and every few minutes one came over and asked how we were. The young ladies were trying very hard for excellent customer service, and I would never be rude, but it was way too much. I counted 11 times someone came to our table that wasn't our waitress. Again, great customer service, but too much. The food came. It was a nice portion and had good flavor. To me, it wasn't anything special. I ordered the double mushroom and I had 8 mushroom pieces. So, the original mushroom must only have 4? I substituted the steak for chicken. I had my choice of dark or white chicken, which was nice; I chose white. The chicken was moist and very good. I ate some and had plenty to return home with. You're also given your choice between white and brown rice, but I skipped the rice. My dining companion got the mongol beef and thought it was very tasty. He would rate the restaurant a 4.  On the wall hangs their shirts that they have for purchase. If you're a big fan, be sure to buy one.All in all, I would give this place a 3.5. There wasn't anything special. the customer service was too much (hard to say because they were amazingly nice and helpful) and the food didn't rock my world (double the mushroom people!). However, many of my favorite yelpers rated this place higher than I; therefore, I vow to visit again and give it another chance. If you're trying for a healthier lifestyle this place has many options."}, {"review_id": "1XCNJILcDsVDQafJnEHumg", "user_id": "SsSg2BASS62MdhBsDBbKVQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "We were really sad when our favorite Chinese restaurant closed four years ago. We have been looking ever since and finally four years later found something even better. The fried rice is Amazing! The portions are a lot bigger if you eat in the restaurant rather than do take out. We also love the spring rolls. The service is fantastic."}, {"review_id": "s6cyeJeuY1poU2Ru4wGpHw", "user_id": "9gXr360kwqpT0uAOk5OoFA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/29/2017", "text": "This is one of the best Chinese food in town. It's rather original from taste perspective. The only issues are with service (ain't that good) and hygiene (ain't that clean).Pls ask for original a Chinese menu as they have 2 menu.Our favorite appetizers are Happy Couple (beef-tendon mix) and calamari. Both are tasty.Main dish \"must try\" is sweet & sour fish and salt-pepper pork. Both are really delicious.We also like their noodle (stir fry) and soup.Try to come during lunch... as dinner could be pretty busy (slow service)"}, {"review_id": "KHK62zONVqo1fc_-GiTOnQ", "user_id": "tqG3KWWvkXU7r0lGhMi98g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "I saw good reviews and wanted to try it. The service was haphazard and impersonal.  We missed lunch ($7.95) by 30 minutes so we had to order diner ($11.95) so it totaled about $25 with no drinks.  The chicken fingers (part of the diner) were the basic minimum and the egg roll another basic minimum with a small amount of cabbage in it.  We had a choice of 3 different rices, so we chose the one the waitress suggested (chow rice).  It was a large portion but minimally a cheaper grade of rice,(sort of bland).  The main dishes were reasonably good. The decor is nice but we were seated about 8 feet from the area where they put the dirty dishes or should I say throw the dishes.  Some of the sounds coming from there actually startled me, several times. We decided not to return."}, {"review_id": "CNDnVfYxJ6wpCSTaCPMSnw", "user_id": "1tZYp9b97jFNOVMZIJAihw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "I'm Chinese  ,I'm looking for a good Chinese restaurant in .

Excellent all the way around on last visit. Yippee!----The first time I tried the Red Pavilion, I was like \"I HAVE TO REVIEW THEM. YES.\" Then I face planted into my food and forgot to take photos. That process has repeated itself several times. Just so you know. I'll get my nitpickery out of the way first: the only reason I didn't give five stars is because there have been some small mistakes. Very minor, like lite veggies instead of no veggies (I know they're flavor! But bean sprouts are sneaky and masquerade as noodles, and nobody likes that! Unless you like bean sprouts. Which I don't. If that wasn't obvious.). Service is always fantastic, and they do get to know you, which is something I really appreciate. They're also super quick. Which is nice when you're in a hurry to devour the whole kitchen. Somebody back there knows how to prep! I don't think we've ever waited over ten minutes or so for food. Despite the snappy food delivery, they don't rush you along. The atmosphere is nice, and modern. Dark brown and red work well together. The food itself is fantastic. The end. Haha just kidding. I could probably talk about it for far longer than is necessary. Are you surprised? No? Moving on. I've been looking for a good Chinese place for what feels like a thousand years, but is more like ten. I know, everybody has their favorite around the valley, but I never stumbled over The One--the one you go back to every time someone says \"I think I want Chinese tonight.\" Being something of a weenie, I prefer my Americanized fare, and I'm never disappointed. Favorites are the cracked pepper pork (okay, with some veggies, but only for flavor!), the lo mein, and chow rice. However, if there wasn't enough awesome to be found here already, they actually do have a separate menu with authentic food. Everybody who orders from it seems to enjoy it, though I haven't personally. And probably won't. Because weenie. So, all in all...eat here. I will probably adjust them up to five stars next time, as by then the instances of perfect service and food will have far eclipsed the nitpicking."}, {"review_id": "I2NysX9X-672MSNAbKb_IA", "user_id": "Oa7KgrLhAfT3L8NxcBHLVQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "This is my new favorite Chinese place (in the Treasure Valley)!

I ordered at 2pm for a 5pm pickup and got my food around 6pm. However it is Christmas Eve and everyone had the same idea as me to get Chinese food. In the hour I waited, I got to chat with some pretty cool people also waiting and it ended up actually being a good experience. As far as the food is concerned: WELL WORTH THE WAIT. Boise doesn't have many great Chinese places but this place is legit. Even with the enormous amount of orders, the quality was still great and we were happy as we sat around in Christmas jammies stuffing our faces full of food we didn't have to cook. From what I understand, the food is generally very quick so I look forward to testing out that theory in the future. I know that I will most likely be there again next Christmas making friends!

Coming from an area that was filled with Asian and Chinese restaurants this Lacks big time in both food quality, Beverages and customer service. The jasmine tea we ordered tasted like water. It had a yellow coloring but literally tasted like it came out of the tap and was heated up. Food portions are big but are lacking in flavor. I'm glad that they don't use MSG but they need to add some more spices. Heat was good because I like my Chinese food spicy. But my overall feel of the place was that I left not getting anything close to what I walked in for."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-pavilion-mandarin-cuisine-meridian?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
