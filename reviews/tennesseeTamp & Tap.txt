I appreciated the decor, and the fact that they had several vegetarian options. I had the Maxwell sandwich, with was literally one of the best veggie sandwiches I've ever had. I also tried the earl grey/lavender tea latte which could have used more flavor, but was overall pretty good. WiFi connection was easy and relatively fast, and there is plenty of parking in the area (paid). Overall a great casual environment with easy and delicious food and drinks."}, {"review_id": "sJoI9EZp-pzX6-Fg--IRlw", "user_id": "2yvbLOQQuGKpQSJwunMEdQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "A great cafe and breakfast joint with a chill vibe. Breakfast waffles and English muffins and flakey and delicious, but I think the waffles came with pancake syrup, not real maple syrup. The americano was decent.

They have a bunch of great coffee options, I got the Hi-Octane which is expresso with vanilla coke, it turned out to be really good!. And also, they have this classic videogames which you can enjoy while drinking your coffee. It is definitely a cool and fun place to visit."}, {"review_id": "q1qRASjnGKNmNI1S3G7YdA", "user_id": "ylW8UudFH0e4dwKg9IvONA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "I have been to this particular location several times. I like to reserve my opinions on a place until I can see if it was just an off day or....... not. It was not. They make decent coffee and I have had breakfast there twice I even posted my breakfast on instagram  . No matter how many times I have gone these things remain the same. No one will say good morning, no one will assist you in any way, no one is pleasant, there are now rules on the door so... now there is really no need to speak.  So if you want a ok cup of coffee, great breakfast and not interested in customer service here is a good spot for you."}, {"review_id": "X6UGvr9dK4hZvXHD_d_iEQ", "user_id": "MzB4PSD7FXhpKFRFQ4uE2A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Not impressed.

I've been here two times and I think that the environment is perfect for spending a morning or afternoon working on an assignment or reading a book. I've had the nitro cold brew and the iced tea, both of which are great. The iced tea is out on the bar, so you can also refill it if you want.The last time I came here, I got a smoked turkey sandwich (Stanley), which I felt was a bit pricey at around $12, but it definitely tasted really good, for what it's worth. That artichoke aioli!!!! So good. So flavorful. It definitely made the sandwich. I didn't even know artichokes are supposed to taste so good tbh.I think the best part of this place is that it's in a great location. It's really close to public transportation, the riverfront, restaurants on Main St., etc., so it's a great place to go as a first stop on a longer day out. It's also just down the street from Beale St. if you're planning to have *that* kinda night but I mean, just a fun fact. Overall, I'm a big fan of Tamp & Tap, it's just a *tiny* bit pricey compared to what I'd like."}, {"review_id": "zM0fxqBoj-rIwjt7bTpSlg", "user_id": "1VcPCT_3R0PTFA59Comtgg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "I've had the Imperial sandwich at least three times here and I love it each time. The price range for this restaurant is $ but I think $10.50 for a sandwich (with no drink or sides except a piece of romaine lettuce) is a little excessive. Aside from that, I thoroughly enjoy the experience here. The cured salmon in the Imperial sandwich is alone worth 5 stars. The portion size is medium. I suggest that they play around with their prices or at least add a complimentary side like fries. The coffee options are nice and relatively cheap and I applaud them for that. The atmosphere feels like a modern wooden café and it's very appealing."}, {"review_id": "wJLN6PYX4snnU9g7PIYu0w", "user_id": "CiLgTymlbUwuDSH3_b55HQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Wow...having seen the reviews I thought this was a slam dunk.

The place is very cosy and hipster. It was a sunny day and maybe because the windows or lack of AC but it was very warm inside. Lay out is great. A guitar player set the atmosphere.You have to order at the counter reading from a screen that my eyes could not read and I don't even wear glasses. Instead I went on their website on my phone to check the menu.I ordered the frittata and got it quickly. The side of arugula had little balsamic dressing, seriously needed more. The frittata was lacking taste, had burned pieces. The size of this dish was the best part. The lady next to me ordered the regular frittata and got a nice melted cheese layer on the top. I had tiny bit close to burnt. I ate tons of ketchup with it to flavor it.I enjoyed sitting down and their endless supply of outlets for all students and people that need to charge their phone. Atmosphere was great. Food a disappointment."}, {"review_id": "7pU_m2_NMs8PpEYStQvIIw", "user_id": "0mM5WfjfBOjuiw0eELmpbA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/4/2017", "text": "This is a chill spot for a coffee or a beer.

He samples a little for himself and says it's fine and just generally acts annoyed. Wha? Don't you know Starbucks is right around the corner? You can keep the tamp 'cause I'm tapping out.
