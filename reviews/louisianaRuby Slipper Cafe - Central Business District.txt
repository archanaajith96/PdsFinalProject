We came here around 10ish and the line was super long. We were 97 on the waiting list with a wait time of 1 hour and 45 minutes! Crazy!!!We had the fried chicken eggs Benedict, scrambled eggs and bacon, and ice coffee. Can't go wrong with scrambled eggs and bacon. The chicken fried eggs Benedict was delicious. Chicken wasn't greasy or heavy.! It had a nice light batter. Great experience! Best time to come around is before 9am or after 12 noon. At least that's what I've been told."}, {"review_id": "Wx-6nIPGmeMQ_6Nj2fImdg", "user_id": "1qH2WaKPOQJQk_XZbo7LQQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "5 Stars for food and service. Waiting time took that last star off. The wait was totally worth it but again...45mins-60mins is kinda annoying if you have other plans as well. Food was definitely great. I ordered a latte and Shrimp Benedict which came with their signature Fried Green Tomatoes. Did not disappoint at all and the server was very friendly. Would definitely recommend this place to my friends."}, {"review_id": "cTT7TFOxMvs1DplXUOwXtA", "user_id": "XgtJ8xWKttzR2xvkI6g0_w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "The Ruby Slipper is a staple in New Orleans. They have amazing fresh squeeze mimosas with the option to mix grapefruit or pomegranate juice in addition to the traditional orange juice+champagne. They have unique options for eggs Benedicts over a homemade buttermilk biscuit vs the traditional English muffin. The egg conchron was pulled pork with thicker non-traditional sauce and the fried chicken Benedict lacked flavor. Overall, the food was pretty average."}, {"review_id": "VMIKLdOSI-ZLegUEj9ix8g", "user_id": "D03upeuF2ujZrkOGvG9S9g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Not impressed. I say this restaurant was very average. It was very busy and they serve alcohol very early so I think that was a big draw for many people who go here. Myself excluded. They are very popular for their Bloody Mary's which I normally enjoy trying but unfortunately wasn't feeling upto one. To me the food was just average, the service was poor, and after waiting 1 hour to be seated, than another 30 mins to get our food it wasn't worth it. Also, the food came out lukewarm and sloppy presentation. If you do go here, definitely reserve your place in line on yelp. If we didn't we probably would have had to wait an extra 30 mins to 1 hr. Which is crazy. This restaurant is definitely very touristy, but wanted to try it since it was walking distance from our hotel. They have another location down the street so they do a lot of business. To me the food wasn't good enough for the wait or the price. I'll pass and don't recommend it."}, {"review_id": "ZHH2PoQ_AIGLOaw0CAF09w", "user_id": "WeU7KUoyVNUQrb2NtesaBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "This place has spectacular food options.

We arrived roughly around 10:30 AM on a Thursday and the place was packed! I read reviews beforehand stating that they don't accept reservations, but through yelp we can join the wait list. It confirms your place in line, tells  you a return time, and the # of parties ahead. The smaller the group the easier it is to be seated because they have bar seats that had a fairly quick turnover rate. We returned by the estimated time the wait list provided for us, but unfortunately still had a 30 minute wait. When your table is available, you receive a text.I ordered the Trifecta which is the perfect dish for those wanting to sample all of Ruby's signature Egg Benedict dishes. It comes with a serving of Eggs Cochon (slow-cooked apple-braised pork), Chicken St. Charles (fried chicken breast), and Shrimp Boogaloo (shrimp sauteed with pork). My friends got the Peacemaker and Chicken St. Charles. We also got two sides of pulled pork and breakfast potatoes to share. This was the perfect amount (if not more) for the three of us. The crowd pleaser of this meal was definitely the slow-cooked pork. The pork was extremely tender, but lacked a bit in taste. The shrimp was good - had a bit of a spicy kick to it. The Chicken St. Charles was mediocre in my opinion. Overall, Ruby's Slipper was a solid staple to our NOLA adventure. Unless you're pressed on time, definitely stop by (after putting your name down on the wait-list)."}, {"review_id": "fh60rUrLPZTIs_QhoUO12A", "user_id": "f-iREBx-5CznQjIMWmoOkw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Touristy and average..in my opinion.Service is Great but Can't Stand the Wait!Food looks great and the dishes are great pictures to share with friends to make them drool.

Even sent one back and asked for a runny egg. Still came back over cooked. Also had a pancake. But the edges had granulated flour and the center was dough.

Strong coffee, variety of menu options, available outdoor seating and really great service. It wasn't a 4 or 5 star for me because NOLA just spoils you with so many great spots for food. There are so many delicious options for breakfast and this spot just fell short for me compared to the others. Jimmy J's Cafe was by far my favorite spot for breakfast and I would wait in that line all over again for the food. I came here because it seemed like a staple spot in NOLA and had to come see for myself. I added myself to the waitlist on Yelp and that was helpful to see my place in line. We went on a Monday around noon specially to eat breakfast. We got seated sooner than expected which was a nice surprise. Order & Reviews: *Coffee - strong, hot, yummy. *Blackstone Benedict - solid, not the best Benny. *Peacemaker- (order 2 Benedict's of your choice, good idea for a menu item) I got the...        -Salmon Benedict  - No! Don't bother.         -Chicken St. Charles - Yes! Out of everything this was my favorite menu item. *Regular French Toast - solid. Pros: Friendly service. Option to add to waitlist through Yelp. Coffee and Chicken St. Charles Benedict.  If you're someone who has FOMO (fear of missing out) like I do then come here and try it for yourself. Either way you can't go wrong with food in New Orleans. ;)"}, {"review_id": "lWcVQEVnnWjmG7IHhk9eIg", "user_id": "lJafwHcYWdxA5e0rqhg_Kg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "This was another place that was recommended. The food here was great. There are several locations is the city and waiting times can be very long. Our order consisted of:the bam bam biscuit - a fried egg, pepperjack cheese, pig candy bacon and a fried green tomato on a buttermilk biscuit. The bacon was sweet and delicious and the biscuit was nice and flaky. The hot smoked salmon omelet comes with goat cheese and is topped with a dill hollandaise sauce. probably one of the best omelets I've ever had. The crispy chicken sandwich was good. I didn't care for the coleslaw. Glad we asked for it on the side rather than on the sandwich."}, {"review_id": "sIOVa4NSD7AFtEUWEAQPCA", "user_id": "RfbE5yot-BYnxJh3lpxAhQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Yum!!!

The food was so good and definitely filled me up until dinner time. Just a heads up, the line gets pretty long so I'd recommend getting on the wait list beforehand so you don't have to wait when you get there. I came here for brunch and had a pretty difficult time deciding what to get since everything on the menu looked amazing. I ended up choosing the Chicken St. Charles- fried chicken served on buttermilk biscuits, topped with two poached eggs and a pork tasso cream sauce. This dish was so incredibly tasty. The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The buttermilk biscuits were flaky and buttery with a slight crunch. The sauce tied the dish together- it was creamy and super savory. I'd highly recommend this dish. In addition, I had some breakfast potatoes and they were pretty good, but they were a bit under seasoned in my opinion. I also tried the french toast and I really liked it! To be honest, I feel like you can't go wrong with anything at this restaurant. Solid place to satisfy your brunch cravings."}, {"review_id": "E-8dA-1u7L8_0RfDPlEn1w", "user_id": "BzLUyHSJrl-lUVWw9rqlvQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "Ruby Slipper Café is a very popular lunch spot in New Orleans near Harrahs Casino.
