So many places that came up on Yelp were already closed by 3-5 PM but luckily we found one that was open until 8!If you sign up for their email you get a voucher for a free tea or coffee emailed to you that you can use right away.We each got a small pot of tea and a crepe with yogurt and berries, which was pretty big! Definitely good for sharing if you are coming in for just a light dessert.Our waitress was very friendly & attentive!"}, {"review_id": "vbmzpAmCcKjsvMf_US39mw", "user_id": "6pTHuzch57b5uvHDqjMvqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "What a great spot! Went here for a birthday brunch with some friends and I was so pleasantly surprised!  For tea I tried the halo blooming tea.  It was light and fruity, and just beautiful!  You place the tea bundle in the hot water yourself, and in minutes it blooms into this beautiful flower. Very impressive!  I have a dairy intolerance and was so excited to find out that they can make most of their crepes vegan!  The crepe was also gluten free, and the texture was actually great.  We will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "Ejn07EmzHeuf-32qHDMHsw", "user_id": "EbGjrHDrbVlSiN8z3gB8Eg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/9/2017", "text": "Clean restaurant, nice hostess/waitress, and yummy crepes. I didn't know what to expect when I found this place on Yelp but I was curious and hungry for some crepes! The Elephant Room is essentially a tea and crepe nook for catch-up with friends and/or for regulars who live nearby. The place is pretty dim (in the evening, they didn't seem to have much lighting going on) and small, but all the much cozy.Parking was tough because we were only visiting Cranston/Providence area and were unfamiliar with the town, however the hostess was very nice and gave us some parking pointers for the next time we stop in. She also answered menu questions promptly and essentially knew what she was doing. I ordered a Nutella and banana crepe and it was awesome! I only wish the serving size was bigger for how much we paid. Plate presentation was great and the taste was even better. I would definitely come back the next time I stop in the area."}, {"review_id": "jcp3KW-H2mP0Uww7cgvbDQ", "user_id": "iVU2lvfap9W6ceUWIxKbgA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/15/2017", "text": "Thank Gawd for Yelp... and my friend Cara. Cara was needing a bite and we were in a hood I was unfamiliar with. Enter Yelp. They pointed us here, and thus we went.To be honest, The Elephant Room looked closed from the outside. Not sure why this was. The glare of the sun. The dark interiors. The shop/place next to it had its chairs on the table. Just didn't look very welcoming. But we entered anyway. There were two folks sitting on the first level, and a ramp that went up to the counter. When I saw the menu, my internal dialogue was like, \"meh.\"(It was all crepes. Crepes... and the occasional non-crepe, but like 92.8% crepes.) Cara, the hungry one, was like, \"This works.\" So I smiled and went along with it. I'm such a good friend.So glad I went along with it! The lounge space on the second floor was very cool (both esthetically and temperature wise). A great room w/ awesome, comfy sofas and chairs, complete with some plants and a newspaper rack. It was a great combo of comfort and swank. One could seriously spend a few hours here with a good book. I also found the elephant motif sweet, yet sophisticated.My tea - Iced Lychee Peach - really hit the spot. Cara loved her peanut butter english muffin. And our waitress couldn't have been nicer. It was a welcome respite from the sizzlin' sunny day outside. Special Note: While we were sitting there, the gent next to us received his tea... along with a mini hourglass timer to ensure appropriate steeping. A nice touch."}, {"review_id": "EqvmI-bcLEtvpycSr6ac4w", "user_id": "Qf4Rkt1fq0kir9-7o25PAQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Th service was great and the food was amazing.

They have the largest tea selection I have ever seen. You can get your own pot and it comes with the most handy little tea timer so you know how long to let the tea steep! The crepes were also amazing. I wish I could have tried them all! They are like little pieces of art but taste even better!! I highly recommend the white peach tea and apple walnut streusel crepe (autumn special) or the yogurt and berries.

I'm not a crepe person but my cousin really wanted to try it and I gave it a go. I thought it would be a fancier place but that didn't matter, I wanted casual and simple. There are two levels to this place...upstairs is an open floor plan with stools and bar, a couch here and there. We went back down the steps to choose a regular table and seating instead. They have an extensive choice of teas on their menu! If you love tea, this is the place for you! They have cute, little tea brewing minute hourglass markers which I thought was interesting (Well, maybe b/c I'm not a tea drinker and I didn't know how fancy tea operates) :pI ordered the Fig & Proscuitto crepe which was tasty. It came with mixed greens salad atop of the crepe. After testing it out and wondering if I liked it or not...I realized I enjoyed it after the fact. I liked how light it was and didn't make me feel heavy at all after eating it. My bf got their ham and cheese, basic but good. Yes, I will go back...I have been trying to go back but everyone's work schedule conflicts! I can't believe I'm actually craving a crepe! I hope they don't get rid of their fig & proscuitto one!I'll come back and give this place 5 stars if I get hooked on their crepes!"}, {"review_id": "neywGk5fCA3pSkIPjAKh-Q", "user_id": "5jaZeBgfuLXxHNRu-l0W7g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/31/2017", "text": "5 stars for the food, great every time!  Service sometimes could be a little better, but the food is so good it's forgivable!I've been to Elephant Room many times, and i can say that food is GREAT!  Highly recommend it to all my friends!  From the crepes to the teas and even the salads!I've tried a few of the crepes and my current favorites are Nutella/Banana and the Fostered Banana.  I haven't tried the savory crepes (though my friends have and they love them) because i feel like a glutton if i order 2 crepes (savory and desert), lol!I ordered this tea (forgot the name) but it is a coconut flavor.  I had tried it cold before, loved it, and decided to try it hot this time.  It was really delicious, especially with adding the little pieces of Ginger the restaurant offers. I was there on Saturday with friends for brunch, and i ordered the spinach salad (asked for turkey on top but they forgot).  The salad comes with mandarin (walnuts, but i am allergic so i ask them to not include them) and a yummy vinaigrette.For crepe i had the Fostered Banana, a crepe version of banana foster desert, which had a caramel sauce that i am still thinking about!  My only complaints were that they forgot my turkey on my salad, and that they brought me my crepe first!  I didn't want to eat \"desert\" before my salad, so i had to wait for the salad.  Overall i love their foods and will definitely go back!  Maybe one day i will try a savory one."}, {"review_id": "lHZbBYCJQo6B5B38cdlOGg", "user_id": "bwiPgaZTFS0BTcB3FNx5pg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/11/2017", "text": "Absolutely coming back!!

As soon as you walk in all you want to do is get cozy with one of their amazing teas and or delicious crepes. It has quite a few seats in the front and some couches in the back. The overall feel of the place is just comfortable and peaceful. It's a place for conversation and relaxing. They have some great pastries up in the front that always catch the eye, but how can one ever pass up their crepes. My boyfriend got the banana Nutella crepe, which was a huge portion. I had the cajeta (Mexican goats milk caramel) with roasted almonds. When I tell you I couldn't stop eating mine, it was just heavenly. The cajeta has a very earth tone to it from the goats milk and the flavor just lingers on your tongue. We paired it with their coconut tea, what a beautiful set up with the timer and the delicate glass tea pot. The prices are so affordable, just seven bucks for a crepe!

My friend had the French press coffee which was just the pick me upShe needed. For crepes I had the creamy spinach and mushroom my friend had the coconut dream. My crepe was the perfect size and came with field greens on the side. The spinach was still crunchy and was the perfect proportion with the cheese and mushrooms.I'm sad I've lived in Governor Francis for many, many years and this was my first stop in.

This time I kind of realized the downsides to this place, especially after my last review. These guys literally skimp on everything. Last time I got a teaspoon of cream cheese for my lox crepe, this time I got a sprinkle of cheddar on my margarita crepe. I also paid extra for naan bread but it ended up being super dry and overpriced. I literally could throw cheese on a piece of naan bread with a slice of tomato and call it \"The margarita\". Also the salad, it's a big pile on your plate that ends up falling on the table. Lastly, as nice as some of the staff are, the service is extremely slow. It took us about 45 minutes just to get our food and the chef actually ended up running out the food I believe so that he could be personable and address any concerns, I just wanted to get out by then. Getting the check was another task.
