Almost everything was unique. The papaya salad tasted fresh with a nice tangy flavor. The raw oysters are seasoned for you, and they were sweet and refreshing. The Laotian fried chicken was crispy and reminded me of Korean fried chicken with a Vietnamese flair. The ahi tuna bruschetta came with sweet soy sauce that was delicious. I was very impressed by how balanced all of the flavors were in the appetizers. I got the kurobuta pork chop which was a thick cut and cooked to perfection and seared in a sweet marinade. It was one of the best pork chops I've ever had. The only thing I was not a big fan of was the duck pho. It may be because I'm too used to traditional pho, but I found the broth to be too sweet, and the noodles were too soggy. Fusion food often times goes wrong, but this restaurant pulls it off extremely well. I'm so glad I got to experience the food here."}, {"review_id": "dEQUp4eai9HQsNxHc9-HEQ", "user_id": "GA6RAfSkRQuHAV0qIs_1Lw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Based on the crowd, reservations are a good idea.    We had one at 11:00 which was the only 'lunch' time I could get.  They actually open for lunch at 10:30!   We started with the Green Papaya Salad with Shrimp.....  well, without the shrimp I should say.  They forgot the add-ins so we had to wait for the shrimp to be grilled.     Next we both had the Pho French Dip sandwiches.  My husband looooves French Dips and he said this was one of the best he ever had.   I thought it could benefit from a little more hoisin and veggies though.  For dessert we had the swirled soft serve (nothing special) and the chocolate crinkle cookie (warm and fresh)."}, {"review_id": "ldPwhl1o6Kh0zr5CiElYVQ", "user_id": "QuiMVjuG_weTnbQVTamKEQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Classic case of overhype. My friends and I were seated but not greeted by anyone at our table for at least 5-7 minutes.

Generally on the food, the drinks/appetizers were the stars of the night and the entrees not so much. I would still recommend coming here, and just be sure to order the right thing (or go with a big group like I did to sample a lot!). Good value for the food as well. THE SERVICE: Mark was fantastic. He was really funny and chatted with us throughout the night. THE COST: $336.84 total (including tip) for dinner for seven (my split was $42.11). MUST-HAVES: Ahi Takati on Spanish Toast, Lemon Ricotta Ravioli, Sundae Funday.THE FOOD:VIRGIN DRINKS* Horchata ($4) - 4 starsLoved this, great flavor, not too sweet. FIRST THINGS FIRST* Big Eye Ahi Tataki on Spanish Toast ($12) - 4.5 starsAmazing! The surprise of the night, and probably my favorite dish. Intriguing set of flavors, with a nice kick of spice from the wasabi.* LFC Wings ($11) - 4 starsIncredibly juicy, w/ a nice light crisp skin.  * Nori Chips ($10) - 4.5 starsMy other favorite dish! Love the pop of the fresh, juicy roe, and the flavor pairings were great.SMALLS* Chicory Salad ($12) - 3.5 starsFine for a salad option, a bit heavy on the bitter flavors.* Weekend @ Burmese Salad ($13) - 3.5 starsGood texture, a fusion-y version of burmese salad. Liked, didn't love, but if you're big on burmese salad generally (not me), worth trying.SPECIALTY NOODLES & PASTA* P&L Pho ($20) - 3 starsMeat was great, very tender & fatty, but broth was a bit on the sweet side.* Pork Ragu Tagliatelle ($24) - 3 starsPasta was quite al dente, meat was tender but could have used more flavor. * Lemon Ricotta Ravioli ($24) - 4 starsThe surprise entree of the night, my favorite one! Loved the sharp lemon flavor. Really great!OFF THE GRILL* Smoked Pork Jowl ($35) - 2 starsProbably the biggest disappointment of the night. The pork was dry and lacked flavor. Overall a bit of a boring dish. OFF MENU* Chicken Fat Rice ($4) - 3.5 starsOff-menu item. I'd read about this on other reviews. Nice side to have, and comes with a fatty chicken broth flavor. Nothing extraordinary to go out of your way for. DESSERT SWEETS* P&L Sundae Funday ($11) - 4 starsPic doesn't show the hard chocolate shell. This was tasty, but the soft serve melted fast! I actually don't remember being asked if we wanted frozen custard, sorbet, or swirl so I'm not sure which one we had."}, {"review_id": "7WYyAfDAxpDLb1WniCaE4w", "user_id": "cTCYvfHsNf4E0dr9wFj1Ww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Who knew that Hipster Vietnamese food was a thing??? Sweet vibe, located right in the heart of chinatown and some of the most unique vietnamese food I have ever had. the P&L Pho French Dip  with  Pho broth as the dip was out of this world good. The hoisin & sriracha glaze was delectable and the broth to dip it in was flavored with what tasted like Calamondin (Kalamansi for the filippino peeps out there) and had a really distinct kick to it. Definitely good sized portions too! Pro tip: Get the laotian fried chicken on the side as well.

Came for dinner and realized they didn't have the basic pho but had duck pho. In a group of 3 we ordered 1.5 share of the duck pho (yes you can do that!) so that turns out to be $30. The pho does not come with a veggie plate but all is in the bowl (they used calamansi instead of lime!)Also ordered the betel leaves/octopus sausage and Laotian fried chicken. LTC good to try but my favorites are the rich duck pho and flavor blast of the octopus sausage (although salty and fish sauce galore).At first I was skeptical about about $18-$20 bowl of pho since I usually spend $6-8 on a bowl on the mainland, but I can see how worth it is! We were full and satisfied with 3.5 dishes. I will come back to try their lunch menu. Make a reservation!Parking in Chinatown can be very difficult on weekends, but doable on the weekday in the late evening. You can park at Walmart and parking is validated up to 2 hours with $10 purchase."}, {"review_id": "uNhmTvCCw3zQ-5mIIoHGqA", "user_id": "iIxVkZmTWmdzFSjtiIYudw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Finally made it here, thanks to my new job across the street, and it was well worth the wait! Close to noon, my 2 co-workers and I were lucky to get a seat at the bar, otherwise it would have been a half hour wait to get a table. Make a reservation or get there for an early lunch (11am) if you don't want to wait...Tempted by the Vietnamese Charcuterie banh mi but didn't feel like all bread so opted for the Hanoi Bun Cha BBQ set ... loved the pork three ways: grilled, meatball and wrapped in betel leaves. It came in a bowl separate from a bowl of vermicelli noodles and aromatic herbs, and I wasn't sure if I was supposed to pour the entire pork bowl into the noodle bowl. Our server suggested making lettuce wraps but the leaves were shredded for salad, not large enough for wraps? But however you eat it, you won't be disappointed at the amazing flavor explosion in your mouth!But wait, it gets better! Their dessert menu is packed with intriguing sweets - gonna have to come back for the Yuzu Semifreddo, Chocolate Pot de Creme and Sundae Fundae. Our choice, the Guinness soft serve topped with a \"Magic Crack\" chocolate sauce that hardened after pouring elicited jealous looks from the diners next to us.

Everything we ordered was excellent, but I wanted to highlight these sausage and octopus bites.

Pig & the lady place was highly recommended by so many people. So glad we got reservations because there was a wait! We ordered the Laotian fried chicken and the ahi tartare on toast for starters. Let me just start by saying that seriously made the meal. The LFC(Laotian fried chicken) is out of this world. SO FLAVORFUL and delicious. Like seriously the best fried chicken ever!!! And I'm not a big fan of fried chicken either. Also the tartare was soooo good tooo!!! My mouth is salivating as I'm writing these reviews haha.. anyways on to the main course! I ordered the signature pho which had duck in it and it was good too! Not as amazing as the appetizers though lol. I think I could have eaten more of the LFC and tartare and would have been good.

My local friend was talking about it and the way how his eyes lit up while speaking about it. I just had to give it a try. Hostess was very friendly as well as our server. Very attentive and friendly the staff were. We started with some Hibiki neat. Had the Laotian fried chicken. Which was fried chicken with a marinated sauce over. It's hard to capture the crisp of the chicken with sauce on it. But they did this pretty well. Had the ahi tuna tartare on avocado toast. Which was quite interesting the toast they used was a Vietnamese crispy rice called \"xoi\" I liked the whole concept but with the xoi was more crisp and more flavor. We tried the pho. The meat was nice and tender but the broth was way too salty not too sure if there was msg but it made my mouth numb. We wanted to try their pho French dip thing but apparently it was only available during lunch. Maybe I shouldn't have expected something spectacular.
