It has a bit of a dive bar atmosphere and the food is both fun and delicious. I recommend the veggie dog to any vegan/vegetarians out there. It tastes like Italian Sausage and the texture is spot-on, unlike a lot of meatless options. Topped mine with Pimento Mac & Cheese, Bugles, secret fry sauce, & pickle relish.The tots are also fun with unlimited sauce choices. I recommend the garlic aioli & secret fry sauce."}, {"review_id": "lKDxoKOD9cAyT1JTa11Ssg", "user_id": "rRGDy3Z8kkU8dvn79GeIfw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "I FREAKIN' love this place. The vibe of laid back \"hey man, everything is everything just be cool\" is how I wish the world were. How many toppings can you put on a hot dog? Let your taste buds run wild at Happy Dog because the list is a whole page ling with even more on the back. And, please do me, no, do yourself a favor and get the tater tots. And if you think this is your grandfather's hot dog you are so far from the truth I can only say....nope. The 1/4# locally made \"hot dog\" is a beautiful blend of whatever top end of whatever does get stuffed in that meat sleeve.  So I say stuff your own gullet and wash it down with one of the many rotating craft beers. Mm'....Mm'....good.  Invite me when you go."}, {"review_id": "odrBrSL3Qh1mvrFnSkT2Zw", "user_id": "QGOtNZfasBwWCuawKjypYA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "We had a great dinner here tonight. The menu is quite extensive with 50 different hotdog/burger toppings. They are all build your own. They also do build your own fries/tots. I loaded mine up with chili, man and cheese, sauerkraut, buegals, bacon, cabbage, cherry pepper relish, better cheese fondue, Spanish onions, success diced tomatoes, and black truffle honey mustard. All of us loved our hotdogs, but the service was not very good. The food came out fast, but everyone was missing toppings. My mom had to send hers back to get the rest of the toppings and they had to remake it twice so the rest of us finished eating before she got her food. Normally I would give a lower treating for this, but they gave all four of us out meals for free. They also have a couple of pinball machines at the back of the restaurant. If you're looking for cheap and delicious food, this is your place. We will definitely be back again!"}, {"review_id": "RKvW2Iq_jtrZGnXenuDnUA", "user_id": "NlAgGEmoFP9T-6WLjYM26A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Very good hot dog joint.

You order your food at the bar and when it's done they bring it to your table, if you're lucky to get one. TIP: PUT AN EGG ON IT. You won't regret it.

For $6, you can get a fully loaded hot dog with everything from macaroni and cheese to pickled items. I think it's a great value for allowing you to put pretty much whatever you want on it and the service was fast and attentive. While the location isn't the most convenient, it's a great place to grab a quick and casual bite with a reasonable beer selection.Bottom line, if you want a dive bar, this one should check off all of the best parts of the dive bar with great hot dogs, but possibly a bit loud when the band comes to play."}, {"review_id": "9m3kWO1GnN0UOs7i2nkX7w", "user_id": "7Po_Q3mnRK5O4F-z7VGpog", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/17/2017", "text": "So good ! Where else can you basically create the hot dog of your dreams -- with over a jillion of options . I had the dog ( minus the bun) with slaw, bacon, cheese, hot peppers, and some incredible sauces. Ditto the same for the tots we had- we smothered then in cheese, chili, and drenched them with sauces on the side. My son managed to create  the tots of his dreams- with bacon and mac and cheese. Super yummy.The prices are so reasonable- 6 dollars and 4 dollars for the hot dog and tots. The beer selection was great and I was happy to have a gluten free beer- yummy.

It's fairly accessible to both east and west siders, so the location choice is pretty nice.I went with my friend, seeing how this restaurant has an average 4.5 rating on Yelp with so many reviews. I wanted to give it a try to see how I felt about it myself.The service is a ok, though I had to wait quite a while to get served. It may have had to do with the fact that filming was going on that day for a commercial, but the wait still was an upwards of 20 minutes even with plenty of open seats.I find it pretty cool that you can order a hot dog and put as many toppings as you want on it. You can also order the tater tots with as many dipping sauces as you'd like. I wanted to try something different, so I got a vegan dog with chorizo chili, mushrooms, sunny side up egg, tomatoes, onions, chipotle ketchup and \"Korean BBQ sauce.\"The resulting hot dog was so large that I was unable to hold it with my hands - I had to knife and fork it or make a mess on myself. While I do like the high levels of customization, I found the flavors to be... fairly standard. The hot dog didn't stand out to me as anything extraordinary. It was still tasty, but didn't taste any different from any hot dog I could get at any restaurant.A cool restaurant to visit, for sure, but as far as the flavors go, fairly standard."}, {"review_id": "wfcn1n1l_EjFjfZFLJgFHA", "user_id": "_RvnZGbEYhnJjcPumlQaFQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "if u just wanna chill and get some reasonably priced drinks, this is a good place. also the hot dogs with unlimited toppings - AMAZING if you're a meat eater. tho some vegetarians have told me to avoid their vegetarian hot dog."}, {"review_id": "6NThnLSBVjri8K1CGdvh6w", "user_id": "yBDKWxJTnwBdbl8Yma8qqg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/13/2017", "text": "This place is so chill - trapezoid bar in the center of a small dance hall-dive bar, serving up big hot dogs, burgers and brilliant baskets of tots made to your own custom specifications across varying categories of toppings and sauces.

This place has the hipster culture in full force - pinball machine, random Elvis lamp, and bartenders with hoodies, slouchy hats and that poet-esque skinny jean.

But I digress so - delicious toppings that are must tries in no particular order...obviously the aforementioned fried egg, the spectacular southern bacon spiked greens, the pimento Mac n Cheese, that ridiculously good white cheese fondue, spaghettiOs and don't judge yes I said SpaghettiOs, Momocho mole sauce, homemade in-house sloppy Joe, Bourbon baked beans, just pick some numbers and try it out you can't go wrong!

And I say that in the most flattering sense of the word. Located on the eastern end of Gordon Square, this bar/hot dog stop looks like your favorite neighborhood bar. Happy Dog boasts a solid selection of local brews and a surprising array of ways to make a hot dog a meal, accompanied by tater tots or fries with an impressive assortment of condiments for both.Being from Chicago I can never pass up an opportunity to make a mess by ordering a Chicago Dog. Purists would object to the celery salt being optional but everything was there, and it was delicious. These are delicious, butcher shop quality dogs (there is a vegetarian option also), quality buns and a dizzying number of combinations for toppings. I also had fries with an aioli mayo...and a platform brew called \"Kishka\" that was also featured at the Dyngus day festival.Events at Happy Dog are also weird in the good way. Music, sure. DJ, sometimes. Pop physics lecture? Regularly scheduled. There was a presentation on wind power for Cleveland the night we were there. Happy Dog is community engaged, fun, but responsible. It's like a college bar that grew up and it's totally worth a visit. happydogcleveland.com for the menu, schedule of events, beer list. You will have no regrets.
