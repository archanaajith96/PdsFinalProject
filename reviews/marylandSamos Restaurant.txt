Direct your friends and family to the fast casual Samos locations and let's keep this one a Greektown secret. I've wanted to go to the original Samos for years, but I never seem to have cash and this place is very upfront about being cash only. A fortuitous decision to get cash back at Walmart, a hidden $20 in my wallet, and the stars had finally aligned. We went around 8pm on a Saturday. They were busy but we were seated in the dining room quickly. It's very cozy and reminded me of a Yia Yia's dining room. We ordered drinks which I had to go up to the front and ask for, since our salad came before the beverages, but it's fine. They were busy and possibly understaffed. I'm not mad. The Greek salad was huge and really fresh. We split the sausage and peppers appetizer which was really nicely presented. Someone took their time to slice everything and arrange it *just so*. Quite good. I was pretty much full at this point so consider that. Still, the Gyro and Souvlaki platters we ordered arrived and we ate. You may balk at the $16.50 price tag, but it's two full meal's worth. Plus I got a nice helping of vegetables so there are major health benefits here! Total for two people's drinks, one app, and two huge entrees was $48 before tip. There is an ATM in the back but it seemed a little sketchy and I'm not sure I'd want to put my card in it."}, {"review_id": "4zeFcZb_i9cY85bUzLzMVQ", "user_id": "q3q4CJ1UcvdTBJKZwuFRag", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Remains the standard for Greek cuisine in Baltimore. From fresh pita and sauces to mind blowing gyros and lamb chops.Only knock i have is that I brought some family here this past weekend for their first time. I had raved about Samos and their grilled calamari many times to them. We placed it as an app order, but what was brought out didn't reflect anything I've had there before. What used to be a generous portion of calamari grilled on a flat top to perfection and lightly coated with olive oil was now a mixed bag of a small portion of charred-burnt calamari/tomatoes/onions... couldn't eat it. That is my single knock. Perhaps chef had a bad night, but seeing just how different the dish was, i fear the recipe has changed."}, {"review_id": "sDWvQweZX0lhD-pIYFjHaw", "user_id": "wALWN-0m9wviE6vmgr1LFw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "Still the best anywhere.Excellent food, service with a smile.Only cash works here, and, it is way worth it."}, {"review_id": "Jh-m0K_DCPkHQ6fN3OPeaA", "user_id": "upH0prqVHNOcVB9bHC0owg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Bring cash, they don't use card.food is great and service is fast.

Do not confuse this with their second location in Canton Crossing, although it is owned by the same people, the original location is still superior. We tried a few items off their menu including the grilled octopodi (perfectly tender with simple flavorings that highlighted the octopus' flavor), the soulvaki platter with lamb and beef (deliciously tender and well seasoned, it also came with THE BEST potatoes in Baltimore), and let's not forget their gyro pita wrap (flavorful and juicy meat contrasted with crisp, fresh vegetables).Special mention goes to the delicious house-made salad dressing, which they actually sell separately in bottles. Take it home and you bring the bottle back for refills!Just writing about this place is making me want to go back, I think we'll have to visit again tonight and explore the rest of their menu!Other things to note: The restaurant is cash only, but there is an ATM in the back. It can be difficult to find parking in the area on busy nights, so give yourself an extra 10 minutes to find a spot when making plans."}, {"review_id": "ZLKYoxajD0rPb5Qh0biyuw", "user_id": "W1tLvceQ3fy7ckQyjliLbQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/10/2017", "text": "Favorite restaurant in Greektown!

So flavorful! It comes with warm fresh pita bread! We also ordered a spanakopita to share. Delicious! So flaky and just good! We both ordered our own shrimp halloumi, which is shrimp with rice, halloumi cheese, and more pita.

A friend heard about Samos offering their 'Tour of Samos' and figured it would be the perfect group outing. After the nine of us coordinated our schedules, we made plans to try the Tour of Samos.The tour started with Tzatziki and Pita for the table. The tzatziki was creamy and the pita was warm, it was the perfect way to start a meal.Each person also got a Greek Salad, the salad was good, but nothing remarkable. The feta cheese was super creamy and tangy though, I love feta cheese. Next up was the Calamari, I personally don't eat calamari, but the group really enjoyed this. The calamari wasn't overpowered by the breading. One of my favorite parts of the meal was the Spinach Pie. Flaky fillo dough, creamy spinach and feta interior, what's not to be smitten by? I've had spanakopita at a few different spots in the area, and this is one of the better renditions. For me, when I see it on the menu, it's hard to resist ordering it.Next came a plate of Garlic Shrimp and Dolmades.I don't eat fish, so I stayed away from the Garlic Shrimp, but everyone really loved the flavor and grill on these.Dolmades, are stuffed grape leaves. These were filled with rice, scallions, and fresh herbs then drizzled with lemon-dill sauce. This was my first time eating dolmades, I can't see myself seeking them out again, but they were pretty good. The last plate to come out, was the Meat Plate, this was probably my favorite because meat is wonderful.One of the items on the meat plate was Chicken Souvlaki, the chicken was tender and flavorful. Also, eating chicken off of a stick is one of the best ways to eat chicken.Usually, I'm not a huge fan of Lamb Gyro, but this was delicious. The meat was crispy and flavorful, I would order this on a pita as a sandwich in an instant. My ultimate favorite part of the meal however was the Lamb Chops. They were flavorful, tender, and cooked to a perfect medium. When I return to Samos, I would probably just order this. The last portion of the meal was Roasted Potatoes, they were lemony, garlicky, and like the rest of the meal, wonderful.If you want to try a little bit of everything in Greektown, head over to Samos for the Tour of Samos."}, {"review_id": "_UVxmJGBQqqH22ob80l8lg", "user_id": "CSp47tpEZLV2hbf7dudGaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2017", "text": "CASH ONLY (they have ATM on premises) Awesome !!!

The food at that hospital is not very appealing, so after checking with a few nurses, we decided to order from Samos. Unfortuntely, they only deliver catering, so we had to leave the hospital to get our food. My mom had eaten there in the past and remembered the food being very good. The restuarant is on the corner in a neighborhood and it was very hard to find a parking space because of the monumental amount snow we received over the weekend...30 inches :-o     My mother went in while I double parked.  A minute later both she and one of the women who work there came out and told me to park in one of the nicely shoveled out spaces that had a place holder.. Anyone from here knows that you just dont take a parking space that someone has worked so hard to dig out . In any event, the woman from Samos gave me a sign to place in my windshield which stated 'Im in Samos, please come in when you arrive and we will move our car\".. Or somethign like that.  She said that they have an agreement with their neighbors to help their customers out in situations like that.  So back to the food. When we walked in, it smelled incredible.  Yummmm!  Its pretty small inside and not fancy, but  cozy.  While we waited for our food, the women in the front were incredibly hospitable. They talked to us the whole time we waited and they shared how they had both been long time employees because they just love working in the restaurant so much.   My mother was given a cup of coffee on the house (you give that woman some coffee and shes hooked).  While we did not eat in, I wish we had.  We ordered a large Greek salad, chicken gyros and 2 Chicken Souvlakis.  The salad was very very fresh.  The dressing was a little diffrent than the normal oil dressings you receive with Greek salad.  It was creamy, but not creamy.. If that makes sense.  The Gyros were really really good.  The pita bread was flavored very well.All in all, it was a very pleasant experience.  Great customer service, good food and good prices.  I will be back soon, and next time, I will eat in to get the full experience."}, {"review_id": "_dDYgGhNTZYsbeDozvtJug", "user_id": "Mo9frQ6jrMh_fK8zUkrv5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "Literally the best Greek in Baltimore (or anywhere I've had for that matter).
