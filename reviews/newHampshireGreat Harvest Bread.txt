I love the cinnamon chip bread. I bought the Vermont cheddar once and used it to make grilled cheese.... orgasmic! It's not just the bread and sweets though. Stopped in for lunch a few times and it's always amazing. I'm eyeballing a jar of apple butter right now... it might come home with me."}, {"review_id": "zNpTv5L6tkcT2mJF1UeMAg", "user_id": "KIVrqBeHdNsdSv3Ksdfbrg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "BEWARE: Customers with food allergies - avoid this Great Harvest location at all costs! I almost ended up at the hospital due to the careless of several employees here. After telling the cashier I had a nut allergy, I was served the WRONG sandwich (even with an almost empty restaurant) which of course, was loaded full of pecans that I didn't see until I'd already taken a bite. Dangerous, reckless employees who put others health at risk."}, {"review_id": "2nWmZRNpI92WNmsAFbp07w", "user_id": "dfu26HVVB_eHsIr-_YyzSA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "We had lunch here yesterday and though the bread was wonderful on our sandwiches, the customer service was extremely disappointing! We waited to order our lunch for too long and then the female cashier/server got up from a table where she was socializing, came up and asked what we ordered. She thought we were checking out!  When she realized by the puzzled looks on our faces, she said,\" Oh, you want to order.\"  We ordered BLTs which were supposed to be toasted and were not! We were charged for 2 BLTs and 2 drinks $19.25 but we only got 1. When we asked for the other BLT and specifically said we wanted it toasted, it was not toasted AND my friend was charged again.  Luckily I caught it and the 2nd charged was reimbursed! I do NOT recommend this place simply based on the terrible customer service.  It seemed like the cashier and cook were high because they were lackadaisical, forgetful and clueless, poorly dressed, and just couldn't careless!  Extremely disappointing."}, {"review_id": "0vgPDNbnTv4flEHtMWSqmQ", "user_id": "B9mUMOgvJBW0rqFhDDJPuw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2017", "text": "Love stopping by for a coffee and scone before work.

Very Very Good, Not sad at all, this is Not Very Fake News. They serve sandwiches a little pricey but they make their own bread which is Very very good. I think it is very very worth it.

They also give out generous samples and I've enjoyed everything I've eaten there. The one minor issue I've run into multiple times is if I or the person I'm with orders lunch and ask for any changes, it's never correct. I try not to be a pain when ordering but I don't think adding tomato or holding the mayo is a big deal. They are quick to correct but it happens more often than not.

WE LOVE IT. The options are excellent. They have lunch, desert and a coffee afterwards. They are all friendly. I think they could definitely expand into a larger building and be very successful. I love the character of their little barn like building. We both got the half and half lunch. I got the tomato cheddar soup and a roast beef sandwich, and he got the chicken salad sandwich with the tomato cheddar soup. We both loved whAt we got. Will go and get pastries after we are done. We also got a pumpkin chai latte that is DELICIOUS. We are very impressed.

The staff was uber friendly, she smiled the entire time and was knowledgeable of what they had to offer. I had a turkey sandwich on cheddar garlic bread. The only thing I would have like a little more of was more mayo. There was only mayo on one side of the bread, maybe because I ommitted the spicy mustard.

Seriously, it's heavenly. I tried the cheddar garlic, honey wheat, and the high five whole grain. All were so good. I ended up buying a loaf to take home as well. I had the tuna sandwich which was perfect, not too much mayo. My dad had one of the roast beef sandwiches which he loved. The staff is extremely friendly. It's a low key little place with indoor and outdoor seating. You can pay before or after you eat. If you're unsure on what bread you want they give you whole slices you can sample. They are primarily sandwiches but also do soup, and salad. I'll definitely be going back."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/great-harvest-bread-nashua-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
