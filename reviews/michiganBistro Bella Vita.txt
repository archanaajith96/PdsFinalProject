The ravioli itself is chewy and hearty, but the veggies are SO GOOD. They're perfectly roasted and charred with a hint of sweetness- I absolutely love they put these on top of ravioli because it makes the dish so much more substantial.With a starter of their tomato bruschetta which was also delicious, and their freshly made focaccia bread, then ending with their tres leches cake which was pretty good, I had such a delicious meal!"}, {"review_id": "tEzN0YODv8scz4uIuNSl1Q", "user_id": "aBZBPKOau_VoDDOYYYMe2Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "I've had a dish similar to this one at Palio in Ann Arbor (not the GR one, they make it different!), which was heavenly.

But it was kind of disappointing for what I paid for it! What I will say though is that Bistro is an absolutely beautiful restaurant with a very classy atmosphere.

There were about nine of us, so they pulled a few high top tables together in the right corner of the restaurant. Our service was very prompt and our waitress very attentive and wonderful.I ordered a Lemon Ginger Shrub for my drink. I have never really had a shrub before so I didn't know what to expect. The criteria I gave the waitress is that I didn't want anything too sweet. I will say the drink reminded me of Apple Cider Vinegar and not Lemon or Ginger, but I like Apple Cider Vinegar so I did not mind one bit.I ordered the duck breast and really enjoyed the other components to the dish as well. I ate the whole thing right now. The duck was a bit chewy, but still moist and great flavorful, but just a bit chewy like most duck is!I will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "hk3JhybgWwpx44XvKPzzDg", "user_id": "Ik6o9PgayxmAoS2gL2Rn_Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "So first things first.... I'm not an Italian foodie at all, by choice.

With all of the breweries in town it's refreshing to see a long sprawling bar with real dining tables and a semi-open kitchen.Their martinis are SO good. Crowd favorites are the Ginger & Juice and the Prickly Pear, $11-12 but they're $3 off during Happy Hour, annnnd they shake them for you right at the table!GET THE BREAD... fresh house made focaccia bread with salted herb oil to dip in. So worth the $1.50pp to add to the table.Their entrees are decent and clock in at about $20. I've had the chicken fusilli pasta & my friend ordered the beef brisket which are both huge portions. The calamari would taste perfect if they took it a bit easy on the sauces they drowned it in.Tiramisu for dessert was just average.. lacked coffee or chocolate flavor but the texture was spot on. Our server was kind and tried to touch base often despite how busy they were. They had a lovely live band playing, and the atmosphere was a great change of pace!"}, {"review_id": "nOqcNvLQmeDrVxsbJyVFFg", "user_id": "bkV4p0fffknkwP46cIhjuQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/16/2017", "text": "My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate his birthday, we aren't from around there so we looked up a place on yelp and this place seemed to have good reviews. The atmosphere seemed very almost hipster chic and the service there was fantastic, we went during their restaurant week so, my boyfriend ordered the special they were having, and although it was apart of their restaurant week, the serving sizes for extremely small.  Now I ordered the pasta that the waitress recommended, and although it tasted better than what my boyfriend was having, again it was such a small portion and the price was not worth it.  I do understand it is more upscale of a place, but with the food just being okay and the portions being small, and we were seated very close to the family next to us, I don't believe I will be returning"}, {"review_id": "XjVjPDzuvGrHQvAUBRn58Q", "user_id": "5E7HGoI8XXqx6rRmpB0SAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "What a great restaurant!

The service is better than average and the food is consistently good--from soup to pizza to pasta. I particularly enjoy the ambiance, both inside and on the patio. It tends towards the pricier side, so I'm always deal-hunting.Happy hour is a great way to eat here more cheaply. The specials include \"contorini\" (side dishes), pizzas and drinks. A pizza plus one or two contorini makes a nice dinner for a couple at a reasonable price. For lunch, the pasta pronto special--soup and a pasta dish with dessert--is always a solid choice.I don't visit often, but whenever I do, I always leave happy."}, {"review_id": "AOe5UoMS7VbbyVlUfQ5VGw", "user_id": "4wce2AL0t8SKgaeY_0EzGA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/2/2016", "text": "The ONLY reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the pricing. We started out with bread for two -which consisted of four pieces of focaccia and herbed olive oil. It was very good, the focaccia was baked well and had a good chew. We also ordered the Beef Brisket Bourgogne and the Fusilli Con Pollo. The brisket had a stately presentation and was divine! It was served with perfectly cooked root vegetables, all set on top of a fantastic red pan sauce. My fusilli pasta was also very good -it's a favorite of mine that I always order, tender pasta and chicken are decadently coated in an amazing creamy pesto sauce. The food is definitely 5-star -but the prices are a bit steep. To be honest, we would come more often if the prices were a smidge more reasonable. Bread for two: $3Brisket Bourgogne: $26Fusilli Con Pollo: $19We did not order drinks or salad: $0Preston, our waiter, was ah-mazing. His verbal and nonverbal waiter skills were on point. He was very genteel with his service. My only other advisement: bread, soup, or salad are not included in the price of the entrees. You will have to pay separate so plan on adding ~$10 extra to your entree bill if you prefer these with your meal."}, {"review_id": "BNSKU50u07by_ybEwiRQAg", "user_id": "rGUV4Z2hx1ga2XvEhR0AHQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/30/2017", "text": "Food: Lovvvvved the quality! We ordered the pay per person bread and it was really tasty but we would have loved if it was warmed. I came to this restaurant specifically because it had carbonara on the menu. The carbonara taste was amazing - it is more creamy than most other carbonara's but this spin is refreshing. The ingredients were unique while working great together. Probably one of the best I've ever had. Service: awesome, attentive, and friendly Ambiance: unique and definitely not the normal Italian restaurant feel. It is a modern cafe style decor.

The staff was all very helpful and friendly. We found parking a little difficult but that's pretty typical in cities.We had tomato bruschetta, house-made foccacia, maison, and the salmon. I honestly didn't care for anything besides the foccacia. The salmon was okay, slightly overcooked, but was served on some of the runniest mashed potatoes I've ever encountered. I think that was the main complaint at our table. Plus they used the same balsamic vinaigrette on ALL of the food except the foccacia. It was definitely one of the most bitter balsamic vinaigrettes I've tasted and I didn't really care for it with the the salmon especially. It was a very nicely decorated place and, I felt, very accommodating with the bride and groom and their families and the staff truly were kind. If I was back in the area I would try them again and maybe I would enjoy something from their regular menu better."}, {"review_id": "JnFRJL7OEeo5zz1l4-x5Rg", "user_id": "B9jt--a2ZzAplfhl2CFn7A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "The wine was amazing, didn't appreciate that I was treated as if I didn't have money to pay for the order.
