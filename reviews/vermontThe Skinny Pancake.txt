Because the prices are so reasonable I truly didn't expect my crepes to fill me up, but they did and then some. In addition, I ordered another crepe dish to split with my sister but was unable to help put a dent in it 'cause I was so full beyond capacity from my initial order. Fresh. My meal tasted so fresh. And the coffee was great to boot. I never knew I liked crepes as much as I do until the Skinny Pancake. I live approximately 4 hours and 30 minutes from their location in Burlington, so when a craving calls I can't just hop on a bicycle and call it a day. But let me tell you something: my sister, who turned me onto the Skinny Pancake, made me crepes a few weeks ago when I told her I had a craving. She might actually be able to put you out of biz, but thankfully (for you) her aspirations take her in different directions. Thanks for being awesome, SP. I look forward to my next experience before 2018 reaches its end."}, {"review_id": "YCN93EXHHjU-jlQkS58xFg", "user_id": "-SYiyzPXaWJe8XZGT-TqGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "I have always loved the Skinny Pancake.  If you come here, come prepared to wait a while. There is usually a line out the door to order and then after you order, you have to wait another 15-30 minutes for your food. The crepes are so good! They use locally sourced ingredients and they are generous portion sizes.  They have sweet and savory flavors and something that everyone will like.

Many lunch options were closed for the holiday weekend, so we stumbled upon the skinny  pancake. My boyfriend and I have never really had crepes before so we were a bit nervous. We ordered two dessert crepes (brownies in bed and the heartbreaker). The crepes range from ($8-13). We ordered at the counter and took a seat; this restaurant has amazing decor and a small stage for some live performers. Our crepes were made fresh and they were delicious. My heartbreaker one was filled with bananas and strawberries with chocolate and whipped cream. The brownie batter one was a fudge brownie in a crepe with chocolate sauce, icecream and whipped cream! We gobble them up! They have free water and ice stations here; but you can also order breakfast sandwiches, some lunch options, and coffee!"}, {"review_id": "V6qoCjiAmXlOXC-KVS8aaw", "user_id": "QxM76aU2aMkH8_YXgNm7HQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Yummy and different! I had the pesto chicken crepe and my boyfriend had the Cattle Rancher. Both were good but could have had more seasoning. For $3 more you can add a side salad that has goat cheese and apples, it was a nice addition to the meal. You order first and then find a table where you identify yourself with a number for delivery when your food is ready.

There were four of us on a chilly Saturday morning and we had no trouble getting a table. Place has a great vibe and we didn't have to wait long for our food. All the crepes looked great. Only complaint was it seemed like my crepe was prepared in a rush. I had the sasquatch filled with squash, chevre and apples. I would say that the filling was disappointing- poorly balanced and not generous.

The portion was good, I actually ate the whole thing!  I would totally come back and try more crepes or enjoy the outdoor seating (it was rainy today)."}, {"review_id": "kBI07oTFPHzqIBBT4yhccQ", "user_id": "hbrZAIK4tuwsg7uc5cJOdg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "The best crepes I've ever had in the US!

Both experiences incredible. You're going to wait in line and you may wait for a table or the food and it's all worth it. They have a full bar, both sweet and savory crepes, and non-crepe stuff too if that's how you're feeling. Emphasis on local stuff and they have a GF option which I didn't try (normally I'm GF but I was feeling indulgent) so I can't comment on it. Coffee is okay, won't change your life but won't wreck it either. I've had both iced and hot. My boyfriend got hash browns and I got the purple hash - beers and carrots - and oh my gosh the purple hash was amazing. I liked it better than his. For my crepe I forget the name but it had ham, Cabot cheddar and local apples and I asked for a side of syrup. Awesome. He had beef (brisket? I forget) with some other stuff in it that he loved. Awesome table in the sun watching all the beaten down marathon runners go limping by. Absolutely love it there, can't wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "uYhnWUsv8hxfGmCnj8drvA", "user_id": "WQpslfOEBYRl-2ov_gHeQg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "I have to be honest I wasn't as impressed as everyone else in this town seems to be. The food was just par for the course, though the ingredient combinations were a tad bit inspiring. I feel like the prices were a touch high for what the offerings were.

The restaurant's vibe and local ingredients was great! So was K's large Bloody Mary and the pickled peppers garnishing the drink! The bar looked extensive and a lot of people were remedying their hangovers with the hair of the dog. But the food was not as amazing as advertised.The Skinny Pancake has an extensive menu of savory and sweet crepes. They also sell alcohol and kombucha.We had the -Deja Vu (local sausage, Cabot cheddar and apples with VT maple syrup)-Cannelloni Crepe (savory crepe with homemade ricotta, sausage and spinach, topped with marinara sauce and local mozzarella)-Cattle Rancher (braised beef, caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, Cabot cheddar with chipotle sour cream).The crepes came thin (and chewy/gluey and used as lasagna) or thick (calzone quality). The ingredients were amazing! And the descriptions sounded so savory and mouthwatering! But tasting each of these dishes, something was missing or didn't gel. Maybe it was the consistency of the crepe, or need of something sour or tangy in the Deja Vu? The food afterwards left me in a food coma but a little disappointed."}, {"review_id": "wmdULxK77nGb70zB3ojm1g", "user_id": "hrKAvOC01k5v2hDVPXzwmg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/11/2017", "text": "A wide selection of food, smoothies, coffee and snacks.  The food and quality is good.  Staff is friendly and this place is local!"}, {"review_id": "UlBFmGNs8BCB8AmkHGR05A", "user_id": "pVjVoTgSqzNtqLBcSnSYoQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "Fresh.
