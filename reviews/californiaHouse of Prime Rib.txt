It was a great experience to have and I look forward to future plans here. THE SIDES: Basically 5 sides accompanied by your choice of cut. My boyfriend and I were introduced by the most beautiful piece of sourdough bread. It was hot to the touch and even hotter on the inside. When I cut open the bread, I just had a great waft of sourdough goodness. It had a nice, hard outside that made a nice crumbly noise. The inside was soft and spongy too. Pair it with some butter and it is he most delicious bread you can haveNext up was their house salad! A very nice sour, creamy, dressing that complimented the vegetables. The only outlier that caught me off guard about the salad was the julienne beets. They added a nice bright red color to the dish. Very simple salad with some salt and pepper! I chose the baked potato over the mashed. Our waiter was very generous with the butter, bacon, sour cream, and chives and I was totally on board with it. A simple baked potato that tasted fluffy and flavorful. Along with the baked potato, I opted for the creamed corn over the creamed spinach. The creamed corn tasted cheesy, salty, and a little spicy. However, the texture of the corn felt stale and a bit overcooked. I had to chew for a few seconds to get it down rather than having that crunchy texture that comes with corn. Finally, their famous yorkshire pudding. It looked beautiful with its crunchy exterior and creamy interior. It had a nice bread like texture to it and I loved how it soaked up the au jus from the meat. It was a great break that cut through the fattiness from the meat. THE MEAT: Prime Rib Cut (medium size)This amazing and succulent cut of meat was amazing. The chef gave me the perfect medium cooked piece of meat that I asked for. With a small bone holding it in place, this meat lived up to its name. Although lightly seasoned, the meat was so easy to cut and chew. It basically melted in my mouth with it's beefy flavor. When paired with the sides, it just became even more amazing and balanced. I definitely underestimated its size and I will be ordering their smaller cut in future visits. Try out their horseradish (mild, medium, hot) with the meat because it enhances the flavor of the meat and gives it a little kick. THE DESSERT: Warm Apple CrumbleThis apple crumble was the perfect sweet end to our meal. With a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, its crunchy and cinnamon-y crust, and its warm apple inside, this was a great dessert. The apples were soft and a little sour, but with a scoop of ice cream, it became so addicting. Lots of textures going on and the sweetness of the dessert was in the perfect range for me.Overall, I enjoyed my first experience at The House of Prime Rib. The food here is really a nice treat, just know your limits. Enjoy the food and company and I'm sure you'll have a great time as I did."}, {"review_id": "8soQVlydMMSxck-mHMuUdQ", "user_id": "JJIJImbqqXXH6sk93yH7hw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This go round was a little sucky to be honest.  We had 2 birthdays in the group, made reservations months in advance.They called to confirm and we confirmed so that was all good.They went to seat us, but the table really wasn't ready, so we had to wait at a side bench for 5 min while they actually got the table ready.We were seated, and while settling in we noticed one of the water glasses was dirty and sticky, which we set aside and told the waiter.  He took the glass away but never brought a clean replacement.  We were having drinks and i ended up sharing my glass with my wife, but yeah, that didn't materialize.I wanted the cream corn and they gave me spinach, and didn't check on us for me to swap.We ended up getting the extra portion and after that was served the waiter asked to drop off the check... we weren't done and planned on getting dessert.We got candles on our birthday desserts, but the waiter left and no one came to sing, but they sang for 4 other parties in the room with birthdays.  The check was dropped off with the dessert.We felt incredibly rushed to finish dessert, pay and go.  Really weird and crappy service this time."}, {"review_id": "vB8K5ARcBnwffDjTj4XnBg", "user_id": "0jIzdLZacwhNiPtvrG06rg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Mhmm. I thought I wrote review for this HOPR but it's all good, will do now.I'm giving this place a 4 because the food was good but my experience was lukewarm.First,I made reservation way in advance but upon arrival, we still had to wait for a good 30-45 mins. Wow...okay then what's the point of making reservation in advance?Second, once we got seated...guess what? We had to wait some more. Another 20-30 mins. Then finally, we were able to order our food. Third, once we ordered our food we then had to wait another 20 minutes. Talking about starving us. By the time we got our food, we were so hungry but hungry to the point where we couldn't eat as much, well that's more prevalent with my friends. I always have room to eat.Let's talk about the food. The meaty part. The prime rib was good. It was soft, tender, moist, and juicyyy. I am a saucy person so I like my sauce. The au jus sauce was yummy but I wished they would hook it up and give me more. But that's just me. Their sides were good but be careful because those are fillers. If you get too full off of them then you won't be able to finish the prime rib. Me, I finished everything plus I got a second. The second prime rib was a downer. They gave me a thin ass slice versus a regular slice. But, I guess that's their trick. I still get a second piece so it's all good.I still recommend this place. It's not popular for no reason."}, {"review_id": "Kmpq9ksqqJZ_u7LtjzAolA", "user_id": "YNZcLev-cVsAtC4p2gozwg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "HOPR is the perfect example of why some good things should never be changed, walking in here is like walking through a time portal back to the olden days when going out to eat was a treat and you got treated well, the whole dining experience goes beyond just the food and great service.Put this on your must do list when visiting the bay area."}, {"review_id": "manIThLfWAPc8jZPlKo1lQ", "user_id": "6ge446UtI_M0yzQa-I66Vg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I come from a family who cooks prime rib on the regs for special occasions and I have to admit... this place is legit! Finally! I have made it to the House of Prime Rib! Special shout out to my friend and SF host, Lyn C., for getting us reservations a couple weeks in advanced. Made seating quick and easy. I'm big boy and come with a big appetite, so I decided to go with the bone-in King Henry VIII Cut. As expected, it was an \"extra-generous, thick cut of prime beef, for king size appetites\". Literally as soon as I rested my knife on this beautiful cut of protein I knew it was going to be tender, juicy, and easy to eat. Probably the best cooked prime rib I have ever purchased. Every bite was perfection all the way to the bone. The cut included two sides: baked or mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. But you also get bread, salad, and Yorkshire pudding  as well. My friend knew they sometimes had off-menu corn bread, so we got some of that too. All the sides were delicious, though I will say the Yorkshire pudding was just alright. How much does all this madness cost? ~$50! Yes, you read that right. Super cheap in my book. Perfect because we also got a bottle of wine to supplement this amazing meal. Overall, super legit spot with great food, perfectly cooked prime rib, and outstanding service. Quick Tips 1. Make reservations! I hear the wait could be long if you don't. 2. They offer you complementary seconds if you are still hungry when you're done - even on the meat.

So many of my friends have talked about this place and how you should order things from their \"secret menu\", so I went into dinner with high expectations.Even with reservations (for 4 people), we had to wait about 15 minutes, which is fine and shows how popular of a place this is. While we waited, we headed over to the bar and ordered cocktails, which were great.So here's how the menu works. Everyone gets a plate of their salad, you choose between a baked potato or mashed potato (secret: you can ask for the baked potato fixings to be added to your mashed potato), everyone gets yorkshire pudding, and everyone gets creamed spinach (secret: you can ask for sauteed spinach or creamed corn instead). As for the meat, there's several different cuts of prime ribs available, which represent portion sizes and style of the cut (thick or thinner slices). One of the secrets is that you can get a King Cut and ask for it to be sliced English style, meaning you get the portion of the King but the thin-sliced style of the English. You also get the bone that comes with the King.Another off-menu option is that you can also ask for your prime rib to be seared, which will really lock in those flavors and give the meat a more steak-like taste. But note that if you want your King Cut seared, you can't get it English style because they won't sear each slice for you. And they will give you the gravy sauce on the side instead of pouring it over your prime rib.Getting my prime rib seared was my favorite because the flavor was so rich. I also tried some of the normal prime rib, as I finished my prime rib and received a small complementary slice of prime rib (this is available for anyone who finishes their prime rib, except for the City or \"Princess\" Cut), and it definitely tastes amazing too, but personally seared is the way to go.I hope you get a chance to eat here, getting all of this food for ~$50 (+tax and tip) is pretty good, and you definitely won't leave hungry.

I was surprised that I liked the salad so much too! The creamed corn/creamed spinach were bland so I wish they didn't take away the salad :( I got the house of prime rib cut because I like a thicker piece of meat rather than the English cut, which is supposed to be more flavorful. My only regret is not coming on an empty stomach because I would have totally wanted seconds (which is free) on my prime rib! The flavors are great and I really liked their smoked salt.

This San Francisco native had only been to Harris' Steakhouse as a kid and had never tasted the roast beef delights a few blocks away at HOPR. Now I have seen the light and with encouragement from Harvey K., I booked a table for 2 on a late Sunday night. We valet'd the car out front, were greeted by the host and were asked to wait as the table I reserved, wasnt ready yet. We made our way to the bar, ordered a couple of drinks and took them to the high tables in the seating/waiting area. It was perfect as the NFL playoffs were on the TV. Shortly after we were seated at a booth in the main dining room.Shar was our waiter and he was great. Being that it was our first time dining at HOPR, he took us through the menu and gave us suggestions, as well as told us what were the most commonly ordered cuts and accompaniments... I went with the House of Prime Rib Cut with mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and the requisite Yorkshire pudding. First off, all the prime rib dinners come with these sides. You can also choose a baked potato or creamed corn. And they also come with the tableside spun salad bowl which makes for a great show.The house salad was great. I liked the dressing and the greens. It was a great way to start dinner. A bread loaf and butter was also given at each table. My prime rib order was delicious. It was a perfect medium rare and was a thick cut. It was flavorful and easily the finest prime rib I have ever had. It was tender and aged perfectly. I've been to the Lawry's restaurants in the LA area and HOPR is much better IMO. That's not just my San Francisco bias talking. That's my taste buds telling you. HOPR is the BEST. The mashed potatoes with gravy and creamed spinach were great compliments to the prime rib. The yorkshire pudding was as good as expected also. It was a perfect meal. What a great restaurant institution in San Francisco.Service from Shar was great. He was informative, friendly and professional. We really enjoyed our dinner even more because of him. It was such a good night. The valet (Filipino) guys were great too. Our SUV was out front when we exited the restaurant waiting for us. 5 BIG stars for House of Prime Rib. We'll be back again soon... Thanks for the tips Harvey K.!

It's just not good enough for me to eat here since I only like the meat. They already pour the gravy on the mashed potatoes and on your steak, which I do not like. I prefer my steak without that sauce. Maybe next time if I ever go back again, I can ask for the meat and mashed potatoes without their sauces. The salad was not so great either. I think the waiter said there was romaine lettuce and after the recall, I was scared to eat it. I also didn't like the dressing and the beets. It was fun to watch the waiter toss the salad though. Their sides are also underwhelming. Mashed potatoes were decent but the cream of spinach just was not good. It seemed so cold too and didn't taste like much. The bread pudding was actually alright. Luckily I enjoyed the meat here. That's what most people look forward to and I can say it was delicious. I ordered the meat medium rare, and it was perfectly tender and juicy.
