The burgers are great and and the shakes are super. The major problem I have is the parking situation. Go on off hours or during the weekdays if you don't want to fight for parking and deal with the headaches that come along with that. -1 Star for parking when I can go up the road to Oak Barrel and have plenty of space any time of day."}, {"review_id": "pRm5QLj2p9BVCWJPw-W-2Q", "user_id": "78isc6ie8vrMZKrAfSefdQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Checked the place out on a recent trip to the DCU Center.  It's right up the street, has a ton of parking and very easy to find.  We had a 10 minute wait, went to the bar to ordered beers and a couple of sodas.  The bartender actually, are you ready for this, did NOT charge for the sodas saying that we would get charged at the table and no sense being charged twice.  Who does that?!?!  What an incredibly classy thing to do.  We all had burgers, which were delicious along with fries, which were kinda average but still good.  The atmosphere is good, not great, but not a deal breaker.  It's your typical pub with TVs everywhere.  I do like the uniqueness of the set up.They need Keno....just sayin'.They have a great beer selection on tap and give you an up to date list of what's available.  Not sure why some places can't manage this, but they figured it out.  I was also very surprised at the price.  Very reasonable.We hit Worcester periodically and will definitely be back when we do."}, {"review_id": "9vLT6yXfrsjsJMorJyIdPA", "user_id": "V34zCO6Fk142wsH3vg3Uog", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "I had heard great things and the menu was impressive but I was a bit disappointed. Nothing was terrible but just not as good as I expected. I got the Greek style lamb burger and the bun was dry and the meat didn't taste like lamb. The goat cheese was also just globbed on and not evenly distributed. I got the side salad which was good but I tried my partner's fries and they seemed under cooked.I was impressed with the drink selection and was happy with the cider I got even though it wasn't the one I ordered but my partner wasn't too impressed that his second beer never arrived but showed up on the bill. The waitress did take it off but he was looking forward to trying it.Overall I would try this place again but I'm not in a rush to go back. I think they are trying to do too much so nothing ends up being spectacular."}, {"review_id": "ic2dgInEVN4f7Si4eC6s-w", "user_id": "akgHS3a9NFQ6DFEeAA891w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "I found myself in the middle of Ma waiting to pickup some family members at a \"halfway point\". I was hungry so I turned to yelp. Another great score. In an old industrial style building they have carved out a really nice spot. I sat at the bar since I was alone. They have plenty of TVs to keep the sports fans happy. The staff were all really nice and looking around at what everyone was eating was making my mouth water. I had a great burger - The Mushroom it also had grilled onions, arugula and gruyere cheese. I opted for the cole slaw on the side and was not disappointed. The menu also had lots of great looking salads and the ice cream shakes looked amazing. So if you find yourself in a town you don't know so well turn to yelp to feed you and you may get as lucky as I did and find the fix!"}, {"review_id": "L5vOu5x4v8U8wYxmQ3xWZQ", "user_id": "lyIwECTGiPb2SNrryJFPmg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I was hoping for a nice burger here but only got an OK one.

We always get the same thing but every time it is delicious. I get the veggie burger with cheddar cheese and the Fix mac sauce. It is so good. The veggie burger seems to be made of chickpeas and other veggies (there are chunks of the veggies in the burger as well). You can get many different sides but I go with the mixed greens. This last time I went, they had a shake that was a play on the Shamrock Shake. This one included Jameson. It was delicious and creamy. Not a big Jameson fan but it blended really well with the ice cream and the mint.During the summer, the Fix has a promotion where you can purchase a \"burger a day\" card for $250. With this card, you get a free burger (up to $15 with). Only caveat is that you have to sit at the bar unless the bar is full. The bartenders are all amazing and friendly so this is never a problem. It does get very busy during dinner time so I would suggest getting there early."}, {"review_id": "ZQ06uxEUAPSHARk4D4itQQ", "user_id": "xirjSwnrFjF87rYT97EG4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/26/2018", "text": "First time going here last night.

If we had questions about a certain beer he helped us without being be of those snooty/condescending bartenders. Very knowledgeable! Also their beer selection is pretty damn good! GET THEIR NITRO BEER if you're into that. Sweet potato fries are \"en pointe\" as well :)) For 6 beers and the fries, our bill was $47.

We were seated quickly. Service was pretty good until we had to wait five evers for a box/check. Was hoping to be blown away because all the good things I've heard about their burgers, but it fell short. I got the Enzo burger which has chicken. Overall, it was lacking in flavor. I had to throw a lot of ketchup on it. The bun was also somwhat too tough for my liking. It definitely needs some more flavor. It was dissapointing because they're pricey too, but mediocre in taste. Sweet potato fries were ok, nothing crazy. Kinda too thin cut for my liking. My bf got the phenomenal burger. He felt that was also mediocre.The strawberry milkshake was delicious though."}, {"review_id": "y_M7q12NERotWAQxtcT5JQ", "user_id": "BvBhLkZNlIYFtgaiZ-BfeQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/5/2017", "text": "My cousin and I tried this place for the first time and had a great experience overall. To start we ordered the poutine fries which were amazing!! Then we each got a burger and a couple of drinks. The drinks are small, but pretty strong.  The spiked milkshakes in particular are to die for!!The burgers were good and pretty generous in size, but weren't anything super special. This place loses stars for a few reasons.  First, the wait was 45 minutes with nowhere to sit while we waited. Second, much of the menu seems overpriced. And finally, while our waitress was really good, she was over attentive and kept checking in on us literally every two minutes. I'd go back, but maybe go for some less expensive options so I feel like I'm getting my money's worth. The poutine and the spiked shakes are definitely worth the splurge though!"}, {"review_id": "wotlNZu9SHdu9b3cSUaRXA", "user_id": "EhWPugJIfXTlPnBP9RiaIg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/30/2017", "text": "I have been to both locations and I want to give this place a better review, but for a restaurant that specializes in burgers - the burgers are nothing to write home about.

I ordered the Green Chili Burger sans the fried corn tortilla strips. It was good but it was not GREAT, you know?

Burger came well done as opposed to the RARE that we asked for but we waited so long that we ate it even tho we voiced our opinions. Waitress tried to do good by us and offered a dessert on the house so we opted for decadent layered chocolate that was as dry as my kids sandbox-local firehouse should have hydrated me with their truck! Great ambiance and bar so for that I give them a 2...their make do if the cake on the house didn't do it for me given the bad dry taste. The FIX didn't fix our appetite and sadly unlike many other reviewers, we won't be back. We travel for good burgers but this doesn't even make our top 20! Let's see if they can FIX that!"}, {"review_id": "8FVliK0H0olrMQm2_QmQeA", "user_id": "5KuG4w0OkCL9_Jl_eQZSuQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Excellent service and food.

Overall, I enjoyed my experience here. The food was delicious!! We got the sampler to share as an appetizer (pickles, wings, pretzel bites and fried polenta) which came with 4 dipping sauces. The fried polenta and pickles were my favorite part. The dipping sauces included ranch, spicy mustard, buffalo and horseradish mayo.We all got burgers and the verdict was unanimous: the burgers were all delicious. I got The Spartan but swapped out the lamb for chicken. Sooo tasty! I think it's wonderful that you can swap out the protein in the specialty burgers for a different protein. I don't eat red meat so this was awesome for me. The reason for the 4 stars is for the service. While there were no major issues, our waitress kept forgetting things. Again, no major issues, and our orders came out fine, but she wasn't writing things down which I guess would have helped her remember. I will definitely come here again!"}, {"review_id": "MZ6CeZ6IPsOyNuwqFggDdQ", "user_id": "F0lpflAkhzkFIEfgcMO4Lw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/15/2017", "text": "After seeing many tempting segments of this restaurant on Phantom Gourmet, we knew we just had to try it.  We arrived a few minutes prior to our reservation time (I read that reservations are recommended for weekend nights) and were immediately whisked away to a table in a back dining room.  We were glad for this table in the back where we could converse without screaming at each other because, while walking through the bar/main dining area, we noticed that the noise level was very high.Upon the recommendation of our waitress, Dara, Sis chose a Wormtown Brewery IPA; I had an Allagash White.  We were both very happy with our choices, and Sis even had a second.  Both of us had a Bacon Blue burger, which contained plenty of crispy bacon and blue cheese, and the addition of Frank's hot sauce was marvelous.  Although the burger patties were a bit thinner than I thought they would be, they were juicy and very flavorful.  For her side, Sis opted for the house-made potato chips, me, the standard fries.  The chips were deemed okay, but the fries were really good---hot and crispy.  Service by Dara was terrific.  She was genuinely pleasant and very helpful; we did not feel at all rushed.  While we both thought prices were a little high, it was fine because this was a birthday celebration.  We'll most likely return for more burgers and brews."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-fix-worcester-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
