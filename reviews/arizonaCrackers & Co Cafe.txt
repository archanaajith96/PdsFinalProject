Immediately upon entering the cafe', I was greeted by a friendly hostess whom politely asked me for my name and explained it would be a 15-20 minute wait. My husband and I took a seat near the hostess station. It wasn't long before we were called. We were seated in the back at a nice table where we were handed menus and our waitress introduced herself to us. She was friendly and has the same name as our daughter--Rachel. She took our drink order and brought our coffee, cream, sugar with cold water right out to us quickly. We perused their delightful menu for both breakfast and lunch. They serve breakfast all day until they close at 2:30 pm and they serve lunch beginning at 10:30 am.We chose Belgium waffles. I ordered only the Belgium Waffle and my husband ordered the Belgium Waffle breakfast that comes with a choice of sausage or bacon and two eggs prepared anyway.We waited about 15 to 20 minutes for our food as it was busy. The wait was worth it! The Belgium waffles were thick and hearty. The syrup was yummy. The butter on top was really good. Everything was delicious and melt in your mouth goodness.We definitely will return in the near future."}, {"review_id": "1C4_d93Rn-P6pBe09dZW8g", "user_id": "uthxOuTofP5Mv3s1Q68tmw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "They were having construction going on in the small parking lot.  Some spots are reserved for other businesses.  Luckily, we found a spot on the left hand side that's open to everyone.  We had a 10-15 minute wait because no one wanted to eat outside in the cool 80+ weather around 9am.The waiter/server, Levi, was funny and almost served us the wrong order... but ours was the next in line.   No big deal, but it was funny.  We ordered four different breakfast plates, and they were delicious.   The scrambled eggs were cooked nicely, the bacon was just right, and the French toast was soft in the center, but too hard on the crust.   I almost couldn't cut it with the butter knife they gave us.  The Arnold Palmer drink was just right too.  I would go back to this place for breakfast the next time I'm in town!"}, {"review_id": "5p8lE-MGjFunSWqLRyGmbQ", "user_id": "PbFae0pDPnX_8j7s4zwPdg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Crackers has been my families go to breakfast spot for over 10 years. With an assortment of great options this restaurant has something for anyone who loves a breakfast. Craving a savory protein breakfast? You can't go wrong with one of their skillets, my personal favorite is their Southwest Chorizo Carnitas skillet. Looking for something more on the sweet side? Look no further than their Cinnamon Roll Pancakes. They offer traditional dishes as well that are equally as delicious and appetizing, but it really isn't a surprise for a well rated breakfast place to have a good cheese omelet."}, {"review_id": "hbufnSgKX640OzzCIOyZ7g", "user_id": "zXBH5QYe1WJCvQdkYBs9JQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Wow this food is amazing!!! I was given a gift card for this place and decided to try it out for lunch. We arrived at 1pm and figured we still had a little over an hour to dine in since they do close at 2:30pm. I had never seen this place and let alone didn't even know that it was located right behind the Home Depot. It was pretty busy when we arrived but we were seated right away. Our server was attentive and very kind throughout our whole lunch. We were so indecisive on what we wanted to order since it all sounded so good. We ended up ordering:Mushroom burger with a chicken dumpling soupBacon cheeseburger with fries Their monthly special of prime rib with mushroom sandwich and a potato soupBoth soups were delicious! They were very hot and both were served with crackers on the side. Both burgers were great and full of flavor! The meat patties were both very thick and juicy! We did ask for them to both be well done but both our meats still had pink in them when we bit into them. The prime rib sandwich was so good and the meat was perfectly seasoned. The French fries were sooo good we had to order an extra side of them. We will definitely be back again but will come at an earlier time to try out the breakfast!"}, {"review_id": "sdt9dhvR5gXE6eVmS3MEig", "user_id": "G3g5OdmKI3kWTZCnLXJ0Nw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "This place has been here forever, like since the 80s, and it's tucked away off of Country Club and the US 60. You wouldn't expect much from an obscurely located restaurant, but Crackers and Co is a hidden gem! The cons: It is packed on the weekend and the place is in dire need of some interior updating (the tables are wobbly and seating is a bit claustrophobic). Did I mention it's been around for 30ish years? You sort of have second thoughts about your food choice, like is all this chaos worth it? The answer is yes. Heck yes. 5 stars just for the food! The food is amazing. The portion sizes are hearty. I love their scrambled eggs and bacon. And for the record, don't count calories when you're here because this is home style cooking, everything has flavor and you will leave stuffed and satisfied. The Soutgwest pork carnitas breakfast is one of my favorites. Service is friendly and quick. The prices are second to none in relation to food quantity and quality. They also do catering!"}, {"review_id": "EoC4y4tij0GZBQ2A-DMSoQ", "user_id": "0HbZyyPZIYFnxR_N9wwvZA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "All I have to say is go here. Bring your friends, bring your family, bring a stranger, a date, anybody. Any excuse to come come here I go. It's also so good, ordered anything from pancakes, French toast, omelette, crepes, and their eggs benedict. EGGS BENEDICT! Get them! Delicious! And their potatoes are amazing as well. Can't say anything personally about the dessert as I have also been too full to get to it, from what I have seen of it going to other tables it looks just as good as all there food. If there is a wait, wait for it. It's worth the wait. The staff is always nice, and even when they are super busy they are all organized. Quick kitchen all the time, always pleasant experience, the best breakfast place I have found in Arizona. Stop reading my review and just go, you know you want too"}, {"review_id": "STd28qcyd_--brgcB1rW4Q", "user_id": "F9J6talz-68lPfVyEQzBfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "I'll run down the highlights.....Very nice atmosphere! Great, friendly service. Hubby and I sampled the southwest and California Benedicts. Wonderful flavor!!! We split and had one of each. Can't pick a favorite.

This is by far the most delicious way to eat carnitas that I have found. The southwest chorizo skillet is killer too. And the bread pudding is divine! The service is quick and friendly. The best part is the food quality and taste is consistent, therefore it is never disappointing. They have amazing specials. I really wish they would bring back the chicken and jalapeño waffles with jalapeño gravy. It is hard pressed to get something here that if not delicious!"}, {"review_id": "2bEiWJQgCeUJw5vjmSTc5Q", "user_id": "DyJZ0etShyRd7SGgpF5LjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Awesome service!

The California eggs Benedict delicious ! Great rich blintzes! The French toast was... ok... they kinda sacrificed custardy richness to achieve fluffiness so if that's your thing you'll like it, for us personally it felt more like fluffy toast rather than true French toast, not sure we'll order that again. Good service, friendly faces, decor is a bit dated but takes a backseat to the great food.  Will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "Ib-BgnEBEiuETnei9V5zbA", "user_id": "87LhHHXbQYWr5wlo5W7_QQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/16/2017", "text": "I found this place hidden away in an industrial business park using the Yelp app.  It was awesome!  We were warmly greeted, and immediately seated.  My cousin had coffee in her hand immediately, and I was served my iced tea.  I went with the carnitas huevos rancheros, and man was it ever good.  They definitely don't skimp on the meat.  My cousin got the garden omelette and they were happy to substitute avocado for the broccoli.  I'm not often in the Mesa area, but if I was I wouldn't hesitate to eat here again."}, {"review_id": "sP24DKwFeMIVNk8orWiblA", "user_id": "-VjNPxxqadc-jWQ-uOlOdw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Yummy breakfast option in Mesa!
