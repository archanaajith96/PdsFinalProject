Service was welcoming, prompt, friendly and accommodating. Our sweet waitress went on & beyond and even modified one of pasta dishes despite it says on the menu \"no add ons\". I ordered a mista salad and it was drenched in dressing- I am recommending having dressing on the side. Beer on tap & water glasses were never empty! I loved that I could see the wood burning pizza over from my table!Everyone who was over 21 got a super yummy shot of lemoncello- ON THE HOUSE after dinner. The ambiance was cozy. I would recommend making reservation since there were not that many tables.

They offer several vegan (or can be made vegan) options (pizza, pasta, bruschetta, anti-pasta and of course salads) and use what I assume is Daiya vegan cheese. The vegan pizza has a nice thin crust and excellent tomato sauce. They put the cheese on a little heavily though, so it can get a bit overwhelming. I usually ask them to cook it well done so the vegan cheese melts completely. It's not the very best vegan pie in town, but it is tasty! I've had the bruschetta before as well, and it's a meal itself. I believe the minestrone is vegan (it's marked as vegetarian) and tried it once, but wasn't that impressed. It was a bit bland. The bread served with it is excellent though!What I really appreciate is how clearly they've marked the menu to indicate what is vegetarian and/or vegan. It makes ordering so much easier! The service is always great, and the location has a nice covered patio for the days and nights when the heat isn't too overwhelming. Most of the parking nearby is metered, and it can get very full during school days because it's so close to ASU's downtown campus. There's usually not a problem finding a spot in the late afternoon or evening though."}, {"review_id": "HRmrpt5RoSxQBkeN0h4WXw", "user_id": "KZSvfiZesxhS90ZHN4Af7Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "I have given this place 2/5 because I think it has potential to do better and be something good but here is what I got from my experience...I ordered take out from here using Uber eats and was super underwhelmed. After looking over pictures of their food posted on yelp, I ordered what would be potentially a new pizza spot as I had just moved in not too far away. I ordered the bruschetta trio and the peppino pizza. The bruschetta trio, which is suppose to be 3 distinct different types of bruschetta came as a two piece duo. Not only was there one of the three missing, but the two that were present were the exact same type. The two identical bruschetta in this duo was comprised of what was on its way to being two lonely pieces of old bread that had a mountain of tomato dumped onto them and had a few pieces of soggy cilantro within the tomato clump.The next item was the peppino pizza. That was actually decent, their dough and spicy salami made the pizza but the absence of cheese that was replaced with grease was disappointing especially after seeing the photogenic photos posted on previous yelp reviews. Even when considering what was good about the pizza, the price point of that pizza was definitely above the quality of what was delivered. Definitely upset that the first place I tried after moving into the neighborhood was a huge let down. With so much food competition in downtown Phoenix, they completely dropped the ball to gain a customer.Since yelp has encouraged me to write more, I present what I hope the company's manager and web designer will find. Somewhere down the line this restaurant has lost its recipe of what is \"AUTHENTIC NEAPOLITAN PIZZA HANDCRAFTED IN THE TRADITION OF OLD ITALY.\" The signature style of Pomo Pizzeria definitely did not create an unparalleled pizza experience. In fact it very well blended into the mediocre pizza that is available on every other corner. The absence of their advertised authentic flavors is clear, but it also hurts their proclaimed techniques handed down over generations which after eating that can't be more than a child attempting to work in the kitchen for the first time. Their ingredients and pizza making process will not take you on a journey to discover Neapolitan pizzas unless it's through the steps of screwing up how to make pizza and decided \"whatever, let's give it to paying customers anyway.\" What ever \"true tradition\" that goes back hundreds of years and thousands of miles to Napoli, Italy is not present at this location and I wouldn't be surprised if it was absent from their pizza chain. The Pomo family recipe has taken a hit in quality if this is what is to be expected. I hope whoever certified you by the Verace Pizza Napoletana and Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani, you find a way back to your authentic Italian dining experience outside of Italy itself."}, {"review_id": "K3hi2tWvoOJMT89nI1Qasg", "user_id": "5HmK6riLkciM0Xxo1ycNTg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/11/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We've been lots of times and always had a great experience. This visit was not the food and service we've grown to love at this place.- Burrata salad- creamy, but didn't have much flavor. Salt helped the cheese, but nothing could help the tomatoes. The tasteless chunks were flavorless and far from heirloom quality. The homemade fig jam listed on the menu was missing from our plate. Not worth $15.- Kale-Romana salad- ($10)- the name is a little misleading. There were a few pieces of kale, but it was mostly romaine lettuce. Fine, but disappointed by the bait and switch.- Ortolana pizza was good (better with a bit of crushed red and parm).- Carbonara pizza was OK. There was plenty of creamy sauce and chunks of crispy pancetta, but if there were onions or egg (as the menu listed) I didn't notice them.The place was busy, but it always is, so not sure why service was a little scattered. We waited 35 min for our salads and there was a really long lag between the two pizzas, even though there didn't appear to be any others going in and and of the oven during the interim. The second round of drinks we ordered never arrived and we had to ask for our water to be refilled. Definitely not the norm, so I would return to give it another try. Hopefully this was just an off night."}, {"review_id": "pGSfexktpgeu6AIHZHTrfg", "user_id": "0FqzWjGOuX5_nVPqW0CkFw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Atmosphere was like a home away from home!

The pizza is still great!!! One of my top 2 favorite pizzas in the entire world. Only second to Juliana's Pizzeria in NY (The Original Grimaldi's). But lately the service there has been less than satisfactory. I used to go there every week and the Manager Maurizio took great care of us as did Selene and Desiree. But since Maurizio and Selene left and if Desiree isn't waiting on us the service is not very good. I took some out of town friends there the other day and they ordered the meatball appetizers and they came out cold. The manager apologized and sent us out another order on the house and they were cold as well. As much as I like the pizza I might have to find another lunch spot if something doesn't change."}, {"review_id": "cutussFM7ahu-TTb7_amlQ", "user_id": "WE3juJ0iRPsQ6e18VynwDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "After a morning at the Farmers market, we sat and relaxed for some pizza and water at Pomo.  The pizza was EXCELLENT!

However, since the Glendale restaurant has recently been bought out and rebranded, it looks like we've come full circle and are back to dining in Downtown again.Make no mistake about it - Pomo makes a great pie. We've always known this. From their use of quality ingredients to the slightly charred and flavorful crust, it's easily one of the better Neapolitan pizza options you can find in Phoenix.As always, we typically start with bread and olive oil. It's nothing spectacular, but it's fine for what it is, I guess. During our most recent visit, they gave us a dribble of balsamic in a dish (and I do mean a dribble). We had to request the olive oil for some odd reason. For pizzas, their bufala verace is easily their best, which is basically the proper form of mozzarella that is sourced from buffalo milk as opposed to a cow. Being the purist that I am, I can definitely say that this is the way it should be done.I won't go into too much detail with the menu. There's your usual white and red pizzas. Everything is traditional and dare I say, playing it \"safe\" for the sake of authenticity. You won't find any of that barbeque sauce, ranch dressing, or chicken toppings here. When your pizza is good, there's absolutely no need to cater to corporate flavor - which is something that I wish the majority of the pizza makers in Phoenix would learn. The only thing that's odd about Pomo's menu is that many of their pizzas all seem exactly the same, with the exception of either adding or eliminating a single ingredient and changing the name. House made desserts are also traditional - and while none of them really blow my mind, they're all respectable options. I like their Torta Nutella and Semifreddo. However, there's just something about their desserts that seems \"sterile\" to me. It's almost as if they're so safe that they come off as dull.In the past, this Downtown location was particularly special due to the complimentary limoncello shots and fried dough that were served to you after you finished your meal. None of the other Pomo locations do this (at least to my knowledge) and I feel that it's an awesome touch that plays a significant role in people returning.The man responsible for this concept (Matteo Schiavone) was bought out by the majority owner. During a recent visit, the limoncello remains, but has either been stripped of the alcohol to cut corners or we simply received a botched-job. The fried dough, unfortunately, is gone - so don't let the old Yelp pictures deceive you. They don't do that anymore. Despite these complaints, I still feel that they serve up a pretty spectacular pizza that will always be a forever favorite of ours.Highly recommended for the pizza!"}, {"review_id": "R0UGp49ZNQgulnrxlxUo2Q", "user_id": "_qq8Wb0rPIdhXzlpoX8WMg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "We came to Pomo on a whim and I am glad we did.

As we finish our appetizers, the server comes over and says they have been on of GF pizza since yesterday. Really?

Both were equally delicious. My boyfriend tried a German tap beer and I tried one of their signature drinks the Mulo- figazia vodka, pomegranate juice, lime juice, ginger beer. I really like the cooper mule drinks. This particular one tasted like fruit punch.Overall we enjoyed the atmosphere, food and drinks. Very touristy.
