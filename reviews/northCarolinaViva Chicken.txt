Parking is free and right across the street. You order at the counter and although there is a line, it moves extremely fast. I wasn't even ready when I was called up to order. Generally very clean space with two rooms to sit and eat in.I tried the quinoa-stuffed avocado first. There were a lot of ingredients on top of both the quinoa and the avocado that I didn't really see either until I started eating. Not quite what I expected, but I loved having so much avocado at once. It's interesting to try, but I think one time is enough.For my meal, I had a quarter chicken, cilantro-infused rice, and plantains. The chicken was juicy, tender, and flavorful. I also appreciated that it was dark meat. I was surprised by the cilantro-infused rice since I've seen other versions make the rice green, but this was more of a stir-fry with carrots and peas. I also love plantains, so you can't go wrong with those.  I ate this so fast and finished it all, which is unlike me. I honestly could have this multiple times a week and not get bored with it. I secretly wish I could get a slighter larger servings for the sides to fill the plate more, but I'm thankful for the pricing I got for the meal.Highly recommend frequenting Viva Chicken if you're in town."}, {"review_id": "ijaUrbTwZuKO7XETXB_Tfw", "user_id": "Mm3dizKXCm3pow3wRmMbtw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "Loved having lunch here! My chicken was cooked perfectly and the cilantro rice side went with it perfectly. I'm not a huge sauce person, so I had the chicken plain and it was delicious. I also had the chicken soup, which I would pass on in the future since it had a lot of raw onions in it. However, Viva gets lots of bonus points for the cilantro explosion in the rice and soup-- love it!Loved eating outside on their patio as well. Beautiful and delicious place to eat."}, {"review_id": "tmMZOHPf0lnkF-jlWIs9Vw", "user_id": "4nPT9BnlMBG4MR81TAhgzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Charlotte. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and everything is reasonably priced to boot!If it's your first time here, the pollo a la brasas are highly recommended as this is a \"Peruvian chicken place\" after all. The rotisserie chickens are incredibly juicy and come in a variety of different portion sizes ranging from 1/4 chicken with 2 sides to a whole chicken with 3 sides (\"family style\"). Yet somehow, no matter what portion size you order it always ends up being too much to finish in one sitting!In addition to the rotisserie options, Viva Chicken draws heavily from \"chifa\" (Peruvian-Chinese) cuisine as well in the Classic Saltado and Arroz Chaufa options. Both are delicious, but I wanted to highlight the Arroz Chaufa in particular as it puts the fried rice in all the Asian restaurants in Charlotte to shame (and I've been to a lot of the Asian restaurants here). When I'm craving fried rice, I come to Viva Chicken for the Arroz Chaufa.Last but not least, no visit to Viva Chicken is complete without the churros!! Though some conscious eaters may find these a bit too indulgent, these caramel-filled, cinnamon coated treats are definitely worth the guilt!"}, {"review_id": "PUwF2eG9l-WIhSPLs6T2Bw", "user_id": "swe3cf9ObJW428Jv3DVuMA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I have gotten several things from viva chicken and finally decided after getting the soap de polo yesterday I will not be back.

I took the \"soup\" back and got my money back. This place is always packed and reviews are great, I just don't see what others are seeing. My coworker's chicken was way undercooked.

The best thing on the menu by far is their stuffed avocados. A normal dish comes with two halves of avocados stuffed with Quinoa over a bed of lettuce (get chicken on top). Doesn't sound like a lot but I couldn't even finish the second half! It is a great healthy lunch that isn't too much. Their chicken in general is very delicious.

You can order anything from a quarter chicken - full chicken, salad, chicken stuffed avocados, wraps, plantains, rice, etc! I really enjoy their wraps and the stuffed avocados the best. I find that this place is much better as a lunch spot than a dinner spot because of their casual atmosphere. They turn food around quickly and have friends and accommodating wait staff.

We came here for lunch on a weekday and it was packed! We ordered for 4 people the whole chicken with 3 sides: solterito, plantains and the cilantro rice. Ok, so the solterito is basically a salad with corn, edamame and tomatoes that is on point! Both the rice and solterito came in big portions, but the plantains were in a small container, so I'm not sure about that for the side portion size. Ok, I know this is weird but the FRIES are amazing. We ordered an extra side of these. I don't know what they coated them with, but they were crispy, hot and perfect. We weren't able to finish all the food with the 4 of us! So good portion size!Chicken was really good, white meat was a bit dry but, nothing was too salty. I think it's a great deal. I asked about the drinks b/c I would have gotten them if they didn't have sugar in them butttt they did, so I opted out just b/c I'm trying to eat less sugar!"}, {"review_id": "QWAcUA6hszsthWGP_hg8Bw", "user_id": "uy4oHzC_4zqEAn95Kv27Ag", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/24/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because there is never enough seating! The chicken is absolutely amazing and I love all the different sauces they offer! They have so many healthy options on the menu! I really love the chopped salad with edamame on it. During my visit yesterday a sweet lady came around to our table and suggested different sauces to us and refilled our waters. Great customer service and they even accommodated my allergy needs without problem! Updated Review: Still always a solid choice for lunch or dinner and recently I discovered the stuffed avocado which is to die for! I always love coming here and don't guilty after eating because most of the menu is very healthy. I seriously love the green beans which have ginger in them!

Families, college kids, old people, basically everyone was here.  definitely a cross section and diverse clientele..... great vibe.The staff was very helpful and Jocelyn went out of her way to make some recommendations and also to walk me through the process.The cashier recommended a sandwich, but I want fried rice, and also the 1/4 dark rotisserie chicken.  Eyewitness her recommendation for the green beans the plantanes, but when I sat down and was waiting for my food Jocelyn asked me if I had gotten the French fries. After trying the green means I probably should have gotten the fries.The chicken was very tasty.  It's tender and has a very good seasoning. The plantain's were excellent, and perfectly cooked.

I have no idea.  I feel like I've been missing out on life for so long.  I first attempted to order via Postmates, but the place was so busy that they cancelled my order and stopped taking new ones.  So... I hopped in an Uber and made the short drive over to the restaurant and picked up my phoned-in order.The minute I walked into the restaurant I knew I'd made a good decision.  The place was insanely busy and it smelled amazing.  I was able to quickly pick up my order via the dedicated order pick up line.  Make sure you throw utensils inside because they didn't include any with my takeout order.I ordered a 1/4 chicken combo (comes with 2 sides for under $9!) with a chicken soup and sweet potato fries.  The rotisserie chicken here is probably the best I've had anywhere, including a few Peruvian restaurants in NYC.  It was extremely flavorful and almost didn't need any sauce to go with it.  The chicken soup was also delicious, but for some reason all the veggies were almost raw - not sure if it's supposed to be like this.  The sweet potato fries are pretty standard and slightly soggy.. might taste better if you dined in.  They have 3 sauces with different bases, but you can choose from mild, medium, and spicy.  I went with medium, which was a lime/cilantro flavor with a kick as well as the spicy, which was more creamy and pepper based.  I liked both, but neither are like the green sauce I've had at other Peruvian places.I saw a lot of people get their fresh drinks... may have to try that next time too.Overall, an excellent deal for delicious rotisserie chicken and sides.  The menu is pretty clean too and nothing too unhealthy (you can choose all white meat, too).  YUM!"}, {"review_id": "zm2pJ_tdgDLeE_tudImWPA", "user_id": "9--gp4NnGQhNSQP4kAprFg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "I come to Viva Chicken for the Arroz Chaufa.
