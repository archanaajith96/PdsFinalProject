In cities like Grand Rapids and Chicago, good cocktail bars are everywhere. I wanted to find a place that could stand against cocktail bars in more progressive cities.Wine Down easily has the best cocktails in Fort Wayne. My favorite so far is the Mai Thai. They definitely make sure the alcohol is at the center of everything they do with their drinks."}, {"review_id": "xXa5ZXSfX1ukPZ7UEiJieA", "user_id": "DDt67ulRHr3cCRD9MdgCEw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Ahh my first time at Wine Down was great! I can't believe i haven't been here when I literally live by it LOL! My friends and I sat at the bar and the bartenders were so friendly and attentive. Unfortunately I didn't get to try their foods or wine BUT I will be back for it. I love the atmosphere. Very chill and cozy. I can only review for the drinks and boy were they strong! Looove it! Moscow mule was really good. I am excited to come back here with my bestie. Parking may be difficult to find but you can always park by cityscape flats :)"}, {"review_id": "VNzMzRfJWgPtBucPFoVTwg", "user_id": "bbdFpJySSuVpUoITrekRgA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "I can only speak for the drinks, since I haven't tried the food. But in general, the service was pretty slow - we sat right at the bar last time I was there and it still took almost 10 minutes to get our order taken. Additionally, none of the cocktails I've tried have been spectacularly good. I will say that they do make them strong, so that's a saving grace. It's a nice atmosphere if you have plenty of time to sit down. It'd be a decent date location because most of the booths are secluded and the decor is pretty upscale - but for a quick drink with friends, I'd recommend going elsewhere."}, {"review_id": "DAZuZ7fkC9ultZ8slUgtfA", "user_id": "xCOoicoiJUGOUL1nR1bzPw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/24/2017", "text": "I love Wine Down! The atmosphere is super cozy, with dim lighting and the space is decorated flawlessly. You can grab a seat in the bar area, ask for a table with comfy leather chairs or even splurge for a more private spot in one of the alcoves. Either way you won't be disappointed! The staff is very friendly and they walk you through the concept of the restaurant if you have never been. I mean who doesn't love a self-serve wine bar? But if you prefer, they will serve you by the glass or you can order a drink from their full bar. I recently ordered the cheese board. Amazing cheese, fresh fruit and baguettes. If you prefer, they also have gluten free options! Then for the wine, I love the option to try a few different kinds. I typically grab my card and go up and pour myself a few samples. Then I can decide which I like best, return and get a larger glass. I love this idea! If you haven't already, stop in and try this place out!"}, {"review_id": "gDcbJ8hwewM-sJCFqSW8rw", "user_id": "q90_LFQYEOzU2cQCxq0LbA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "This is high price for low quality. Sopressatta was more fat than meat. The chef said, \"That's just the way it comes.\" I'm, sorry, but no it doesn't. The charcuterie plate ($22) comes with two cheeses, three mustards, one pickled hard boiled egg, three meats (if you call the fatty sopressata a meat), cornichons, and a few pistachios sprinkled. It came with 4 slices of baguette. More bread, which anyone would need, is $2 for four more thin slices (see attached photo). A bit much, I think. The high point was the waitress Rachel. Super sweet and attentive."}, {"review_id": "YrR436nk84lkjaB08zrW8w", "user_id": "UOAkp38YlLpjmTpGmd492g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Met some friends here for our first time, service was exceptional and drinks were good, really like the self service wine.

I walked in the door and immediately felt at peace. This is a wine lovers paradise and yet somehow I didn't have any wine...more on that soon. The atmosphere is cozy, modern yet an old school vibe at the same time. Unique seating arrangements isn't bar area from half moon booths and half room high tops around the wine stations. It was quite empty on my Monday evening visit, I'm ok with that though. I had outstanding service from Carl the head bartender. He carefully went through the entire menu with me from cocktails to food. He educated me on some spirits I was unfamiliar with and that's what made me lean towards cocktails instead of wine. I mean I can have wine anytime but these cocktails were quite unique. Cocktails: I had two and both were suggested by Carl after discussing my  likes and dislikes. First I had the Spring Fling, it was light l, citrusy and perfect hint of basil. I loved every sip. I didn't think another cocktail could top that one but Carl proceeded to blow my mind with drink #2. At his suggestion I had the Gjallahorn, don't ask me how to pronounce that. It may sound strange and complex and trust me it is. It's green and tastes fresh and earthy, but the coconut water gives it a nice balance. It actually tasted like it was healthy for me. Again, I loved it!Food-I was struggling to chose because so many menu items sounded great. Ultimately I chose the Shrimp N' Grits. The gouda grits were creamy and divine with pieces of smoked baked and topped with a sunny side egg that was perfectly cooked. It was truly delicious. Everything about this dining experience was outstanding. I'm only in town for a few days and I'm really tempted to go back because yes it was that good!"}, {"review_id": "k1Q2A97Vrz2jl-8WUmyihw", "user_id": "Sk25lZ8THvUtltgMtKtCLg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "The atmosphere was amazingly calm.   There was a slightly upbeat tempo playing over the speakers, and the staff was very welcoming from the moment we entered.  Rachel was extremely attentive, and the drinks were not your average watered down drivel, but potent and well thought out creations(I chose not to partake of wine, but rather spirits).  The food arrived timely, and was exceptional in flavor.  I had the filet burger, which was exquisite.  The burger was prepared as requested, and the aioli and gouda complemented the burgers juices quite well.  Definitely would return if back in the area."}, {"review_id": "jbvfitVGmB58PgDRUSB7Ow", "user_id": "-GZOYbSZ6aSKgEPbEGnClQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "This was our first time here.

Plus, you have to love that another restaurant has located downtown, adding to the list of quality non-chain places that make it feel like a semi-revitalization is occurring.  Wine Down has the requisite selection of wine, including the pay-as-you pour station.   Its craft cocktail list was much more interesting than the wine; not the typical sugary-sweet concoctions that you see elsewhere, but cocktails incorporating smoke, bitters, and a heavy dose of quality spirits. The craft beer list was very small and not very diverse, although I surprisingly found a Taxman B-Keeper listed alongside the Miller High Life.I am more a fan of Wine Down's atmosphere and drinks, than the food.  You're in Indiana, so it's more meh Hoosier-influenced tapas (creamy artichoke dip, buffalo chicken, pulled pork tacos, etc.) than European/Spanish type tapas. I think Wine Down should take a risk and offer more creative plates, like the duck flatbread and the charcuterie offerings.  Of the plates I sampled, the flatbread was my favorite, with a vinegary-sweet balsamic reduction drizzled over roast duck, gouda, mushrooms, and caramelized onion base.  The same reduction was not used on the sauteed brussels sprouts, which tasted like they were drowned in plain vinegar. The sprouts dish needed a bit more browning and bacon, plus the stems trimmed; maybe roast instead of sauteed? I recommend checking out Wine Down and ordering a creative cocktail & the dishes you won't find elsewhere in Fort Wayne. Why order a buffalo chicken skewer when there is a wild game meat & cheese board to sample?"}, {"review_id": "LNV8_LeDzIAa20c8oS2cOA", "user_id": "xTsSKVALx9I73njz5dYm0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/28/2017", "text": "I am thoroughly impressed, unassuming from the outside.
