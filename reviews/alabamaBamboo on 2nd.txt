Typically when I'm in the area they aren't open during the day. I sat at the bar since it we just a party of one and I figured I'd get my food quicker by doing so. The ramen bowl was every bit of delicious and hearty as I'd hoped it would be. Perfect blending of pork broth, mushrooms, scallions, cilantro and a soft boiled egg; accompanied by pieces of seasoned pork belly. There are several cuts of meat available for an upcharge to add to your ramen bowl. The fried green beans were awesome and aplenty. The creamy, spicy sauce was yummy and kept me reaching for more. I can't wait to visit again and try other menu items, especially the sushi!Bar service was good! Loved the sleek, modern ambience."}, {"review_id": "koQiV-jWuZzEtXMip88QbA", "user_id": "Qz7XU2bJfdAR_va18B5Ulw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "Came here because the Yelp reviews were so good and everyone kept recommending it to me. Honestly, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't worth the price. The small plates are much too expensive for the amount of food that you receive. If the quality were better, maybe the price could be justified, but I would not recommend. Maybe my expectations were too high and so I'm unusually disappointed. Small Plates:Tuna Tataki: 8 slices of tuna for $12; I could honestly buy much more at Whole Foods, slice it myself and season it a little and it would be the sameMomos: They're labeled as dumplings, but it's not what I would expect for dumplings. I've never had Nepalese dumplings, so that might be the problem. It could also be that this is an Asian Fusion place and I was expecting Asian. The filling is very bland and again not worth the price. Skewers:Grilled Chicken, Korean BBQ sauce: It tasted fine, but it's nothing I couldn't just make myself with some chicken breast and any bottled sauce from the Asian market. I could get 1 lb of chicken breast and a bottle of sauce for the same price, so why would I come here. Main: Ramen Bowl: Which was the best out of everything else. However, there is only one option for Ramen which is a little restrictive considering how broad Ramen actually is. This may be the only food that could be worth the price."}, {"review_id": "Momxhm0hPf3m-WTaUXA47A", "user_id": "2DCKZKJhVuHPaT7_tf0Khw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "First visit here so didn't know exactly what to expect. First, if you are planning on coming at normal dinner time on the weekend plan on a wait. They don't take reservations and you will probably have upwards of an hour to two hours wait to get in. Note: Head over to Collins Bar (next block down across the street) and grab a drink or two while you are waiting. I should also add, I'm struggling to give them a higher review because food was served to us that was raw (not sushi - turkey) and only because we were paying attention we didn't eat it). I could easily update this review and score higher after another experience or two. Seating inside is distributed between tables and the sushi bar counter (where we ended up). There isn't any outdoor seating. Staff was friendly enough, but I felt like we were a little rushed to place our order. We asked for extra time, but they were constantly on top of us asking what we wanted to order. I'm guessing if you hit them when they aren't as busy this isn't the case. (3/5)Drinks:Ruby Fresca- Deep Eddy Ruby Red Vodka, Fresca, Fresh Lime- ($9) - Overall a pretty refreshing drink. Was better when you squeezed the fresh lime and mixed it in.....It was good enough to have a couple of them. (3.5/5)Started with a couple apps:Momos: Steamed Nepalese Dumplings with Ground Turkey, Veggies, Spices,Tomato Vinaigrette ($9) - This order was a problem and would typically have lowered this review to a one star. This food came out raw. There were 5 total dumplings on this order and 2 of the were undercooked. The Turkey was actually pink and juicy and hadn't even began to ball up yet. They took these back and had the manager come over to apologize for the improperly cooked food. They took care of this and brought out a fresh order that was cooked properly and was actually quite flavorful. (first batch 0/5...second batch 3/5 probably better but once you have had a bad experience it's hard to rank it higher)Bamboo Skewerss: Garlic Shrimp, Korean BBQ Sauce ($9). The skewers were really good. Three total skewers with 4 shrimp on each one. Flavored nicely and a good starter. (4/5)Entree Rolls: Electric Eel- Crab, Avocado, Cucumber, topped with Seared Eel, Eel Sauce ($14). Could see them prepping this and using a torch to scorch the eel. This one was really good. I still haven't ventured a lot into the uncooked realm of sushi, but am really liking some of the variety of cooked options places have. This one was really good and I would order it again. (4/5)Crunchy Shrimp- Shrimp Tempura, Cucumber, Masago, Avocado, Eel Sauce ($10) - Another good cooked roll. Plenty of flavor and the ingredients were equally distributed through all the pieces. Very good and would order again. (3.5/5)Overall, aside from being served food that wasn't cooked properly the experience wasn't bad. I would go back and try them out again. Ultimately the way they handled the situation was pretty good. I wouldn't hold this against them for a return visit or recommending somebody to try them."}, {"review_id": "2koQXCJ7ZkCIkjqvL-nIqQ", "user_id": "kSMtqwnnrxH2GSEyNaq5bQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "My girlfriend and I decided to come here to celebrate my graduation. Based on a friend's recommendation, we started off with a bowl of fried green beans. It was a huge bowl of light fried beans that came with an amazing sauce that really complimented the beans. It came with so many beans that we didn't even finish till the end of our lunch. We then shared a role of spicy tuna sushi and a bowl of ramen with chicken. The sushi was absolutely my favorite part of the meal and tasted great. I honestly would have been fine with just sushi and the green beans and be perfectly happy. They make great sushi. The ramen was okay and nothing special. The chicken we added to the ramen was not that much and slightly disappointing. I did not think it had much flavor in it but my girlfriend enjoyed it so it all depends on the person. In all, it was a great meal and very reasonably priced."}, {"review_id": "4i7iqj7JjWV_hl0iMpxrew", "user_id": "j2Y9IQ60xP1KtpWNeJWVpg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "As an Asian who visited Alabama on the way back to New York, the sushi wasn't bad.

Only thing was this spot was extremely expensive for just some sushi.

This place may be my new favorite. I came on a Thursday night around 6:30 thinking it would be crazy crowded; turns out we were able to get right in with no wait. It got busier once we arrived though so I would recommend arriving by 6:30 or before. The Food: Excellent. We ordered the fried green beans as an appetizer and they were perfect: lightly breaded with a tasty and creamy siracha sauce blend. My wife got the Thai Chicken salad and I ordered the Sapporo roll(spicy tuna, smoked salmon, cream cheese, beer battered...you get the point) and we were not disappointed. The others who came with us even shared their rolls. The Fire Roll was even better than mine but I wasn't complaining on mine. Â The Service: Excellent. They brought everything out to us in a very quick amount of time. Our server even recommended certain items as well and we all followed them. They were friendly and courteous to us all. The atmosphere is cool too-it doesn't feel like a typical restaurant it Birmingham. They have some cool Asian decorations and different seating than normal but I like it. If you like meeting new people, I recommend the bar area or the Community Dining table area near the front. I will definitely be back-no doubt."}, {"review_id": "U8_9xZYYU8Zh96Qw0-lThw", "user_id": "Teky9fPBdjSxsJPTka3cTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "It had been far too long since the last time I visited and this experience topped it! I went on a date after a fun time at a Yelp event so it was pretty late( maybe 8:30 ish). We were immediately seated and our waiter, Bradley, was super nice. Since it was less packed, I was able to appreciate the decor. We sat at a half booth, half table. The atmosphere was very nice and classy. I felt like I was getting a super expensive restaurant experience for cheap. I had already looked at the menu and knew exactly what I wanted to order: the veggie ramen bowl. I had seen people get their ramen bowls before and knew nothing else would do. My date ordered the oh so popular, fire rolls. The food was out within minutes and I dug in! I'd never had a ramen bowl before, but wow. The waiter was kind enough to give some spicy sauce on side if I wanted to give the tofu some flavor, but I didn't need it. It was so flavorful and the veggies were delicious! Needless to say, I finished mine. My date really enjoyed his sushi. He hasn't had much, but it was definitely the best he's ever had. We will definitely be back! Great food, great date place!"}, {"review_id": "Ys5ucmkfh1LmJkqme7o_Ng", "user_id": "SfMQS15KXPK0mUMlGvnR_g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/28/2017", "text": "A great restaurant in downtown Birmingham, Bamboo, has all foodies talking. Now I know why. Our table of 3 ordered as many different plates as we could eat and not one was ordinary. Small plates, skewers, sushi, and miso soups were all packed with flavor. This place does not take reservations and the wait can be for hours, so get your name of the wait list early, they will call you when your table is close to being ready. It is worth the wait. Did I forget to mention service? Our waiter, Bradley was knowledgeable about all foods on the Bamboo menu.

I do still enjoy the community table! The service was really good. The drinks at the tables stayed filled to the brim which always makes me happy. The parking was just ok, but it's downtown so the couple of blocks you walk helps add to the urban feel. My food was great!

We love the cool, trendy atmosphere. You can dress up and not feel out of place or go casual. I recommend going before the heavy dinner rush. The seating is limited but the service is very quick. If you so get stuck with a long wait then head across the street to Collins for a drink!There are many options for starts. They're served tapas style. Try the momos- or dumplings. Large portions and very hearty! I've tried many different things here. The Spicy Miso bowl and Ramen are incredible. There are many layers to the flavors. The spicy miso doesn't play- there's a kick to it but it does not overwhelm the other flavors. I usually go for sushi. The sexy lady is my favorite!I highly recommend Bamboo. Prices are a little high- especially the sushi. One order is not filling but paired with an app I tend to be satisfied."}, {"review_id": "mkTztWU3_wBphBIwGIQPwA", "user_id": "wWEfUq839pFMLhLVJ5XkLQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "Absolutely amazing! We started with \"momos,\" a steamed Nepalese dumplings filled w/ground turkey, veggies, and spices. The dish was then covered in tomato vinaigrette which was almost better than the dumpling itself. It was slightly spicy which I really enjoyed. My only complaint was that there were only 5 small dumplings for $9, but they were so good that I'd definitely pay that much to eat them again. For my meal, I got the vegetarian thukpa bowl for $10, and it was really flavorful and filling.

Had the tako salad, egg rolls, the Godzilla roll, and the take roll tonight and will have to say everything was delicious! Arrived right around 5:45 on a Wednesday and there was plenty of seating which was nice since this place is usually packed to the brim. Although everything was flavorful, I wouldn't necessarily suggest ordering the salad and these two rolls together because it was a pretty high level of spice! Will mix it up more next time so that my mouth won't be on fire. Flavors were delicious although I wish there was a little more crunch to the take roll for a combination of textures.

The group I was with got 3 different sushi rolls and they all raved about them. I got the Thai Chicken Salad, and it was a towering heap of salad goodness! The dressing was very tasty, with a bit of a kick! There was plenty of grilled chicken strips and sesame seeds as well.

Prior to having restaurant served Ramen... I didn't realize how good that stuff could be! Having the expectation of \"I'll try it because it's gotta be on the menu for good reason right?\" and being completely blown away was definitely a welcomed surprise! So much flavor!!! A plus here is that the portion sizes are definitely large enough to have some to take home, depending on your appetite!The decor and style of this restaurant is also done very well.
