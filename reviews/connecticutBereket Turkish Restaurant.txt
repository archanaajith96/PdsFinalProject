And have faith that your Yelp community knows their good food! That is the approach you have to take if you're searching Yelp for some delicious Turkish eats in the Bridgeport area. We love Turkish food and since moving out of New Haven we miss having Saray and Istanbul Café (now closed!) in our dining out rotation. I actually didn't catch that this tiny restaurant is attached to a Valero gas station, and if I had communicated this to my wife she probably would have ruled it out. But I'm so glad we gave it a try and she is too! We have been back a few times since and even made the drive out here when there are 2hr+ waits at all our favorite Westport restaurants. The food here is authentic, delicious, and everything you are seeking in excellent Turkish cuisine. Everything in the cold appetizer meze platter is on point. The hummus, haydari (Turkish tzatziki), antep ezme, eggplant salad and babagannush. All are done to perfection and bursting with flavor. My favorite of the bunch is the antep ezme, which is a spicy tomato salad puree. It's like if the countries of Turkey and Italy had a cold crushed appetizer baby. Another thing that I love about Turkish cuisine is their culture's bread. Light and airy with a lot of big bread bubbles in the dough, it serves as the perfect high-surface area vesicle to scoop up the variety of mezes. The falafel, kebabs, and yogurtlu dishes are all fantastic too.One last note, don't confuse this place with another Turkish restaurant in Bridgeport with the same \"Bereket\" in its name. This spot is Bereket Turkish RESTAURANT. The copy-cat place is Bereket Turkish CUISINE. Their website leads with \"We Have No Other Branches\" because it's clear that this other spot named their restaurant to confuse people and potentially steal away customers who assume they are owned by the same people. Of course I'm making assumptions here as well, but in talking to Bereket's staff about this potentially brand stealing concept, our waitress responded in the most humble and non-confrontational way. Bereket in the Turkish language means \"abundance\" and the owners here aren't threatened and feel that they should be grateful and happy with the abundance of what their gods have given them. This message of love not hate just makes me loves this hole-in-the-wall place that much more!"}, {"review_id": "Vm5UCUW9D83Xmep4qoi53Q", "user_id": "Expvo1RBt51-uQ33LHMtSA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "We had a mixed selection of cold appetizers/mezze and a feta-parsley borek. Everything was outstanding. We then decided to give dessert a try, picking the baked milk pudding; what a fantastic creation!! I can't wait to go back to this place. What a gem!Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, it's an odd shack attached to the back of a gas station, which only adds to the charm."}, {"review_id": "KGx17br8XjldErgF7UoT6Q", "user_id": "qKWoI6cQ9zmSearBXtSuaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/12/2017", "text": "By far the best Kebabs and Turkish food I had.

The food is always served piping hot. The bread is fresh baked and served hot.  The portions are large and the prices are reasonable. Some favorites are the chicken soup, mixed appetizer plates, baked borek, chicken chops, and lamb chops, and the falafel is also great.  In my opinion, Turkish food (like Persian or Afghan) is far better than typical middle eastern cuisine due to the far more subtle spices.  You won't be disappointed by the food.  If you are going at dinner time, with more than 2 people, you might want to call ahead and ask for a reserved table."}, {"review_id": "1j7kp_SUTbNHWrbiypoKFQ", "user_id": "-IgW0DMcfAw-wDxc0CB-sw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/13/2017", "text": "Bereket takes gas station eating to a whole new level!

However, I was disappointed. It is located behind a gas station for starters, and goes downhill from there. The eating area was warm but crowded, certainly not a great ambience. I had the bonita fish, hummus, borek, and lamb chops. The food was ok but nothing special to be honest. I have had better Turkish food in West Haven. Also, the service was slow and the waitress often forgot about us. They don't even have tap water to serve because apparently it's unfiltered, so you have to buy bottled water. Overall, I will not be going back and do not recommend going."}, {"review_id": "vey-vHzzPY7TgDIhmszyPA", "user_id": "lIiXhe2bTyFoTJ1NhgGHnA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "Food is good.

It's located in Bridgeport off the beat and path hidden behind a Valeria gas station. Not easy to find but I am glad we did.They have some outdoor seating maybe 5 tables, and a few tables inside. This is not fancy but has a neat feeling. We ordered the shepherd salad which was exceptional, very fresh ingredients, great flavor. Also had the falafel which was great. Main courses my wife had churrasco, she is Latin and doesn't like to take risks. I had the sampler platter which included some lamb, ground beef, chicken, and sirloin. Everything was totally fresh and had great flavor. You could tell they probably used organic chicken or high quality. It  was very soft and tender. The bread they served was fresh and crunch as well. One thing I wasn't crazy about was the Hummus, not bad but not great and I have had a lot better. For dessert we had the baklava which was delicious. Great find we will defiantly be coming back."}, {"review_id": "JDylesFELAXsriY9C-6jbQ", "user_id": "CGwlI7N3jMnEzSnoHYlbcg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/10/2016", "text": "Came here for lunch with hubby.

Besides, it's the only place where chicken kababs aren't dry.I absolutely recommend their chicken kababs, beef kabobs, mixed grill (minus the kufta inside), lamb shank (available on Fridays?), stuffed eggplant (sometimes available), kazandibi (desert - fried custard). For the adventurous, try the Ayran drink with (and only with) your dish (it's really sour).Things here that I personally don't like: kofta kababs (meatball), fried liver (their style is a bit sour for me),"}, {"review_id": "JpyJvH6rZz85MPsNmPe3qA", "user_id": "u0sSzKqNnQVDwhhEbEfGyQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2017", "text": "Not a great place to sit but great food!
