($13.99 each for the plentiful lunch portion). We also chose the lobster corn chowder as an appetizer ($6.99) which was very delicious!  I ordered the creme brûlée for a dessert treat but they must have forgotten to add sugar because it had no flavor. I had to send it back but the waiter was gracious about the mistake. His was the only time I've ever had to send anything back here.Still deserves a 5 Star review. Biaggi's is a very good restaurant. Good service, good menu selection and reasonable prices."}, {"review_id": "FkOrqvnMtw5PZoLphoz1-g", "user_id": "y-a96vxKm-j3vWJwknSB-g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "We walked into a beautiful building to be \"greeted\" by two women... but not really.  Two very rude young woman, the blonde looked like she had eaten shit by her facial expression as we told her we had a party of 5.  The other person mumbled I'll take you to your table, where we followed; she was completely silent, placed the menus in the table and walked away without a word.  After a couple of minutes our very friendly waiter Dalton greeted the table, offered his knowledge as we had never been there before and promptly took drink orders.  He brought the bread to the table and poured olive oil onto a plate with Parmesan cheese with cracked black pepper.  The French bread was odd, and the other potato bread gross.  The French was odd because I don't expect to see it on an Italian table but with the oil it was good.  We ordered chicken parm, chicken with honey, basalmic, cheese ravioli, pork chops, and tilapia.  The food is solid, but seasoning was all over the place, the pasta was bland, basalmic reduction too powerful, but other than that the dishes were decent.  During the meal a man came to the table... did not identify himself, but asked how everything was going, we said good, he asked if I needed a new drink, and I told him that would be good, then he left.  Awkward... my daughter said \"who was that creeper,\" to which I said \"maybe the manager.\"  We continued to finish up our meals, pay the bill, and head back to the hotel.   In the service industry first impressions matter, identifying oneself matters, and quality control in the food industry is a given.  I understand this is a chain, but don't rely on other locations to carry you.  Overall okay food, great wait staff, bread 1/2 good, oils mix boring, greeters need to go, and the manager either needs a name tag or basic lessons in etiquette.   Dalton exceeded expectations, but the food didn't, therefore we won't return.  Cheap version of Carrabba's, but better than Olive Garden."}, {"review_id": "cGeHt_JG_iAB0KN0uQquQQ", "user_id": "6HyP4NICoRtoU9ayxpqxpA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I was expecting a little more flavor in the food and a little more attention from the staff for being an upscale restaurant.  Food was not real good.  Surprised I didn't like it.  Restaurant was clean.  Bathrooms were clean.  Staff was friendly.  Just not impressed with the quality of food.  Sorry.  Maybe next time."}, {"review_id": "9PCw7aDwhgE0zuUKSibn_Q", "user_id": "aXbE5xBGWhXqVRcrgknSXg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2017", "text": "For fear of glutting my critiques with a mess of chain restaurants, I always look for something unique to yelp about.Today, Easter Sunday, my tolerance for crowds, waiting in line, or dealing with congestion in general would not allow me to eat out for dinner. So, we opted for take out. When we called to place our order, the bar staff explained curb side pick-up. We were able to pay over the phone to quicken the experience even more. I pulled up in the designated spots, called to let them know I was there, and all from the comfort of my slippers and pajamas. I ordered a family-sized pronto pack with the black noodled fettuccine and lobster - always delicious. I also ordered the chop chicken salad with extra dressing. If you have kids, their kids' meal options are great; the pizza is awesome, but we usually get the kids' spaghetti. Kids' meals come with a drink - my daughter loves ordering Shirley Temples, complete with a maraschino cherry. They also come with an ice creme - the chocolate being the best, in my opinion. Don't forget to ask for whipped cream and a cherry! If you have ever dined there, the breads they serve as an appetizer are awesome. I request just the baguette bread along with an entire extra loaf with whipped butter and oil since it is their best, again, in my opinion.Don't forget to ask for plates and eating and serving utensils to save yourself any clean-up! Follow these tips for all the deliciousness of a Biaggis' meal without the hassles and annoyance of being around people."}, {"review_id": "kIt6w62quuN7bfmYr7GD4A", "user_id": "Sd8-2WtDQwXiDq0rekR2wQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Best Italian food in Evansville!  The staff are all friendly, and the atmosphere is elegant and warm.

We had a guest speaker, Tom Lonnberg, Curator of History at the Evansville Museum. He was entertaining and educational. The facility was perfect for the size of the group and , again ,the staff was knowable and helpful in setting up the equipment. Oh, by the way, did I mention the staff was great?

It was a hearty, rich, creamed-based dish; he had to take home half, which was neatly packaged for him. Of course, his over full belly MAY have been related to the 3 pcs of Amaze-balls focaccia bread.  Seriously, self control is difficult with that focaccia bread service!I hope you have as enjoyable of a meal as we had!  We'll be back."}, {"review_id": "MyDGG2Y-qOYTJrz1QDtKCA", "user_id": "ZkFyGnaqJt9P2giH_UJpoQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/19/2017", "text": "Solid Italian chain.

We were once steady customers to the Evansville location. The service is first rate. We had established somewhat of a relationship with some of the help! But the past few visits, we noticed that the quality of the food had begun to suffer. Our last three visits ended with complaints to the manager about quality of food. She is very professional, and offered to not charge us, but we politely declined. She presented us with a $15 gift card, and ask us to please return. We decided last night to give it another try.  The first thing we noticed upon arrival was that the former Executive Chef had been replaced. The menu seemed to be back to a more traditional Biaggi menu. As ALWAYS, the service was top notch. Immediately, Steven came over to our table, to catch up on the last 10 months. Our server was prompt, professional, and polite.  I ordered the lobster and fettuccine. It arrived hot, delicious! The only complaint I could possibly have, would be that the service and food was so timely, that it shortened and otherwise delightful dining experience!  We are once again frequent clients of this eatery. I recommend them to anyone dining in Evansville, and looking for fare that is better than the rest!"}, {"review_id": "rrpvMS_gtAb2zkvyS95_6g", "user_id": "VhI1iA_3o11AkdJ4sKl8VQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "6/21/2017", "text": "Oh look a stupid chain \"Italian\" restaurant.

I even scraped some of the cheese topping off to see what it tasted like without it, and it was still amazing!  I loved how they seasoned and spiced up the pork chop and then tossed it on a grill.  Even the veggies were good. The service was good both times I've been here.  Can't remember what I ate the first time but I remember it was great as well.
