This is one of those places where everything about it is great. The food, the drink, the space, the feel, the people and the service is all fasntatsic. The garlic knots are probably the best part but the bruschetta is also really good. Both made with their dough and excellent. The salad is also really, really good. The house dressing is a poppyseed mixture. You can find locals coming in with Noli jars and buying/refilling. I was told it's the founder's mother's recipe? Who knows but it's great and it's served in little Chinese food boxes :) I've had just about everything on the menu sans deserts and it's all real good. Then you gave the pizza.. So, so good. Any of the combinations are great and you won't be disappointed. I've had all the specials and several menu combos but my staple is pepperoni, meatball and caramelized onions. Grab some habanero oil at the counter and dip the crust. Yum :)Oh, and the restaurant strives to have as green an impact with supplies so almost everything is compostable including plates, cups, forks, etc.. so use the composite bin instead fo the trash :)"}, {"review_id": "1_aaJjzHCVR28mIKGcA_VA", "user_id": "5JpvIWhtaaSr8rrE7keK6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Visit. Grab a seat. Have a beer. Sit in satisfaction with your pizza of choice.My favorites are the fungo, bianco, margherita... to be completely up front, everything we have enjoyed the pleasantry of eating has been absolutely satisfying. The prices are more than your everyday spot but that is of no concern considering the elements involved. Simply stated good eats at this establishment. We appreciate slice options so that the four of us fulfill our individual tastes while also being free to sample as much of the menu as our eyes desire and/or our stomachs can handle...I do not recommend take out here - the crust is so delicate that we have found, however delicious the result and short the trip back to Dundee is, their pizza doesn't maintain adequate \"pizzaness\" once home. Eating in is a different story. Take that delectable pie of love down fresh, as it should be done. The new space is enjoyable, but parking is not. We do not visit during weekend evening hours. Service has always been pleasant and accommodating."}, {"review_id": "U9ppduqxUybf7iwMhmhnmg", "user_id": "NJI5H_TDKATECh_PpafB4w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Noli's is hand's down the best pizza in Omaha. I love coming here for their lunch specials (I think it's two slices and a soda for $8). Their slices are very big, and their crust is perfect! The lunch staff is always amazing, friendly, and makes the pizza perfectly so that the crust is crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. They also have flavored olive oil - garlic, basil, and habenero - which tastes amazing on the crust! They're also vegan friendly and offer vegan cheese! Lunch is always perfect!I had to knock off one star, however, because their dinner experience is unfortunately not the same as their lunch. When I came in for dinner, the girls up front were inattentive, our order came out wrong, second try came out undercooked (basically dough), third try came out good. They didn't offer any apologies despite the fact that it took three tries to get the order right and we were there for an hour for two slices of pizza. The cook was making AND running food, while the girls hung out up front, occasionally wiping tables.The atmosphere is trendy but comfortable. They have bar seating, along with several tables and a few booths. There is one large TV at the end of the bar. I also think it's great that they have bins for recycling trash (drinks are served in plastic cups/aluminum cans, and pizza is served on paper plates). TLDR: Definitely check out Noli's lunch specials for the best pizza in town!"}, {"review_id": "TprnVjN5x1-IV94UZudPRQ", "user_id": "mUQSraz9VstMRHhbdT8D-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I love pizza and this is the best pizza in town! Nestled in Blackstone with wonderful urban appeal. The atmosphere is warm inviting and a pleasure. The service is always spot on friendly and helpful. The pizza is made in the stone oven so the crust is crispy with great chew, not too doughy but not too thin, just perfect. There is a great balance of crust with the toppings. It is never greasy or soggy. It's always fresh and tasty. I also recommend the garlic knots! Little garlic jewels of flavor!

It's the type of \"quick eats\" that you need in the Blackstone district when your night out is hopping from bar to bar, or you need a quick daytime bite. Casual, fairly fast, and made to order. I was recently there after a night of drinks and fun at 4-5 other Blackstone businesses. I was totally ready for some food to settle the booze in my belly. I ordered the pesto/olive/sausage pizza slice and a beer for my friend. My total was around $11 which is reasonable. I watched the staff construct the slice and pop in in the oven. Minutes later, greasy piping hot bliss with a perfectly cooked crackled crust. I've gotten more \"to-go\" full pies from Noli's historically, and this is the first time I actually stayed in to eat a slice at the bar. Not surprisingly, it makes a huge difference in the experience. Hot, fresh pizza is meant to be enjoyed in the moment and I recommend this to anyone who wants to have an equally stimulating experience. Def a top three pizza joint in Omaha for me."}, {"review_id": "Uz4HRVT0M0xHPWisw8OwXA", "user_id": "aV534F2PLHgSvLEs6wi2fA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "Best pizza in Omaha. Period.

The outside of one of the knots was burnt and they tasted kind of doughy overall. Glad we got them for free with my coupon, as they cost $5. But oh man, the DiManzo pizza for the win. The balsamic glaze and filet mignon just paired perfectly together with the mozzarella cheese and fresh basil. The pizza wasn't burnt and the food came out relatively fast considering how a steady stream of people started walking in on a Thursday night around 6 pm. The slices are big. Think, Costco size or Sam's Club size big. So if you want to go for just a slice (or two) they have that option rather than getting a whole pizza.Street parking is pretty easy to find on Farnam. And if there aren't any spots there's also plenty of parking in front of the apartments lined along Harney street."}, {"review_id": "9BgFM4tIIqYfmMnG4rTnxA", "user_id": "o3i2TWhlI9gyUBDDzozHAw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "Noli's is by far one of my favorite pizza places in Omaha!Order by the slice or a whole pizza, and you won't be disappointed!  The dough is made with imported water (read about it when you get there!) and is the perfect balance between fluffy and chewy with a little crunch.  I highly recommend the Bianco, Margherita, or the Fungo.  Also, don't forget to try some of the homemade infused oils (garlic, habanero, etc.) they have on the bar area!You have to stop at Noli's if you're ever in the Blackstone area!"}, {"review_id": "XRmbzNFJb9YUsRGTflq4-g", "user_id": "5FAD2Yq7DLBQ_-ef1iDA-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/2/2017", "text": "Family and I stopped by Noli's while making our way to Denver. If it was not for the Yelp world, only God knows what dump of a restaurant we would have ended up at. Once again though, Yelp led me to a winner.We stepped inside and were immediately greeted by the pleasant young lady behind the register who explained the ordering process in detail and took our order. We started with some drinks and took a seat to wait for our order (included garlic knots and pizza). Within 5 minutes or so, our knots were on the table. They were tasty, covered in butter with a side of sauce. As stated, they were good but priced a little high in my book.After about an additional 7 minutes or so, our awesome pizza arrived. Our pie was ordered with pepperoni and meatball and sides of ranch. Our family loves the ranch action and for the record, theirs is dang good and creamy. The pizza crust was perfectly dough like and had just the perfect light crunch. The meats were so flavorful and the amount of grease was just on point. Even with a slightly high price point, I had no issues with paying for such quality. As for the setting, the inside was very comfortable and had a good sized television to watch some sports games. The vibe was energetic but relaxed. Overall, really happy with our experience and would recommend to any friend in the area."}, {"review_id": "iJvLcuuBUP4c2x16vBcYOg", "user_id": "qf2mm_oOG91ui01bCXmRyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "How have I not tried this place before now!?!?!?  I'm buying into the hype and saying the water makes the difference!  This is some legit NYC pizza.  Just thinking about it makes me crave it.  Located in the Blackstone, it's not too big, think a bar and 8 or so tables.  Expect it to be loud, but it's all part of the atmosphere.  My only complaint is the ordering process at the counter is a bit cumbersome when it gets busy, and also makes it a little annoying to get another drink.  That said, the pizza is so damn good, it's not even funny.  I straight up loved it!  Hands down the best thin crust NYC style pizza in Omaha."}, {"review_id": "uRmcLLJpiFBPvzf0_5i2gA", "user_id": "hum9KGlN0R1nMFb2kYZL1A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/6/2017", "text": "Noli's delivers some of the best pizza in Omaha!Classic pizza with some of the best dough I have had in Omaha.   Actually it is the best in Omaha.  #1  This place is it  Badge, Award, Ribbons they earn the #1 spot.Everyone is super friendly and helpful, you will get some awesome service.Toppings are perfect and the olives area amazing!!

It is on the outer edge of Blackstone so parking is easier to find. There was plenty of seating and we were able to choose where we wanted to sit. They give you menus and then you order at the counter, although this process wasn't actually explained to us so we were confused about what we were supposed to do at first. We started with an order of garlic knots and I ordered a small side salad with poppyseed dressing (the salads come in either small or large). For our entrée, we split a slice of the meatball pizza, a slice of the Margherita pizza, and the Bolognese pasta (tomato sauce with meatballs, sausage, and mozzarella. The garlic knots were served with marinara sauce and were alright. The salad was fantastic, though. Both slices were decent sized. My husband and I both agreed that the meatball pizza wasn't very good, due the meatball not having a ton of flavor. The Margherita pizza was very good, though. The pasta was amazing, and was easily the best thing I ate here. It is also a very generous portion, and could easily make 2-3 meals on its own. It appeared that the food came out as they made it - first the garlic knots, then the salad a couple minutes later, then the pizza, and about 5 minutes later, the pasta. We were fine with this, as it worked out well with having a toddler and a small table, but I know it is a pet peeve of some people when everyone's meals don't come out at the same time. Probably my least favorite thing about this restaurant is that all of the food is served on paper plates and the drinks are in plastic cups, which seems wasteful (even the salad was in a cardboard box). The total for our meal was just under $30, which was reasonable for the amount of food we got. Overall we really enjoyed the food and it was moderately toddler friendly, so we would definitely come back here."}, {"review_id": "_ZQZHoDkB_B3Vl34OISjcg", "user_id": "BwsxSf3j2lPaQkQs3jpt0A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "I'm a huge pizza fanatic and this place is one of my new favorites!

I was impressed with the atmosphere which was laid back yet clean and modern-rustic. My buddy ordered one of their specialty pizzas (some kind of meatball pizza) for us which was a bit on the pricey side but it was ready to eat in 15 minutes. The pizza was neopolitan style and pretty delicious. I was glad they didn't overwhelm the pie with cheese. The service was friendly and helpful at all times.They had a small selection of local brew which made me happy and they also had a live cellist playing in the dining area which was actually really great.

I have been to Noli's a handful of times now and all I can say is Iove their pizza! The only reason I can't give it a 5 star review is because this pizza does not do take-out or reheat well. This is a pizza best eaten straight out to of the wood fired grill, and when you do it is amazing. EVERY TIME!I have tried several \"choose your own\" toppings pizzas on their New York Style dough and have been so happy every time. I have also gotten pizza by the slice which is also amazing.

Great location in black stone and family friendly. Staff was very kind and loved the window seating we got. Jack Noah and I tried a slice of pizza and explored the proper method of holding such a huge slice. Joseph and grace split the penne and meatballs. Reviews in and this place gets a 3.8 aggregate score from my crew. It's a must stop I Omaha for a fun night out. At a total of 31 dollars for a family of five it's a value for sure.
