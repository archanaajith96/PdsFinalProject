That's unheard of.  It's hard to resist this hole in the wall place that is always advertising $0.99 Ricos Tacos.  The special only applies when ordering from the taco stand outside.  The regular taco price is $1.30, still very affordable.  They also make cemitas, tortas, tamale, burritos, and quesadillas. The menu is in Spanish so here's a cheat-cheat:Arabe Taco - a Pueblan specialty with Middle Eastern influence, feature juicy cumin-marinated pork in a warm pita-bread wrapperAsada - grilled marinated steak stripsCabeza - cow headCarnitas - Shoulder of pork that's been seasoned, braised until tender with lard and herbsTCemita - sandwich made with egg-rich bread topped with sesame seeds.Chorizo - pork sausage, red from paprikaCubana - deep fried chicken filet, chorizo, hamEnchilada - Chile-marinated porkHawaiana - includes pineapple and hamJamon - hamLengua - tongueLomo - tenderloinMilanesa - deep fried breaded cutletPollo - chickenPastor - shavings of marinated spit-roasted porkPierna - legQuezillo - cheese and avocadoThey have both indoor and outdoor seating.  Complimentary chips and salsa when dining in, but not carry out.Credit card minimum is $8.....| \\      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,      .../  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \\ -  ;  ;  ;  , _    ..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .  (   ` - ` -  ' - '   '  - - - ' ' ( _ / . _ ) - ' ( _ \\ _ )"}, {"review_id": "-sEJKME6q6vb7kU8vQDzrQ", "user_id": "yNBWjO-iUobbSzVCsgMuRw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/23/2017", "text": "I'm excited about this place !! I live for places like this ! It's a little old joint painted up real nice like some Mexican shack set deep on a Caribbean beach ! But get this ,,, your in a neighborhood with no other businesses around ,and down the street from Garth in  Wayne's world . Yes ! It's Aurora Illinois.  2:00 Saturday afternoon, the place is dead . My better half and I pull up . I look at her and wonder if she's getting out of the car . She's got caviar taste . She asks me \"Are you sure ? What did the reviews say \" ? I Yell \" MIXED !!         The three Salsas were certainly homemade and the best I've ever been presented with at any Mexican restaurant. 1st one was a Mango w/Avocado chunks -Awesome ! 2nd was a jalapeño type -to die for . 3rd -Tomato base , not all watered down . 1st chips free then u pay . I asked for Guacamole. Not on the menu . Cook made it fresh 3$. 1st Bite into my Aberas Taco was like no other Taco I've ever had . Aberas Taco is pork meat with a chipotle sauce that is from the state of Pueblo Mexico. It is delicious, rich in flavor kinda teriyaki/ Barbecue sauce . Steak taco and Al Pastor tacos were good as well. By the time we left the joint had gotten quite busy . Please go and check it out it's a fun little excursion . Again, Thanks Rooster for another good turn - on"}, {"review_id": "L1P_JWj9vQjdm6vvlXiq5Q", "user_id": "xYVKd66qtLjYVXRqo6mQvw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/16/2017", "text": "Las Cemitas Poblanas is a modestly sized, L-shaped, brightly colored taqueria which serves the real deal. If they've got tripas and lengua tacos on the menu, you know the kitchen is familiar with the cuisine. This is my kind of place. My server was super nice, though working solo through the lunch service. I didn't get a lot of attention, as most of it was showered on a 10-top next to my table.It's a real dilemma coming here - deciding whether to get a cemita or the tacos Arabe. And yes, I could have hedged my bets and gotten a cemita Arabe, but I decided to jump in headfirst and get two tacos Arabe with the chipotle salsa and one carne asada taco (large size).The carne asada steak was chopped very finely, and was delicious. It was in a double tortilla, just as you'd expect. The stars of the show were certainly the tacos Arabe. The seasoning on the meat was delicious, and the chipotle salsa was a perfect complement - it brought the heat too.The food here is really great. If you like your Mexican food authentic, you really should give this a try."}, {"review_id": "sGM5A8eYUSk0cqgtiAMfnw", "user_id": "uZbIzVlYLu8Etg8wUXyRlQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2017", "text": "Caught this restaurant on Yelp when a colleague suggested fast food and I vetoed that right off.Awesome and authentic Mexican that was expertly prepared and loaded with flavor. Very low key place but the food here is the star. I went with a mango aqua fresca (I later got a Jamaica)which was delicious and then ordered an el pastor, chorizo, carne asada and an arabe taco. While we waited we were served chips with three types of salsa, two green and one red. All were amazing with the salsa verdes being the better since they were spicy. All were amazing and amongst some of the best tacos I have had. Plenty of fillings without being over filled and just enough condiments to add flavor without overpowering the meat. The corn tortillas were smaller but doubled up so you could enjoy all of the amazing filling without having it seep through the tortilla. If I had to pick a favorite it would be the asada or the arabe which were spicier and satisfied my craving for some flavorful food in a land of far too many chain establishments. Service was very friendly and the prices were very reasonable. 8 tacos and 1 burrito plus 4 drinks for $29.

On the friendly host/server's recommendation I tried the breaded chicken milanese one on my first visit. It's chewy and crazy delicious with all the toppings like cheese, avocado, chipotle sauce, lettuce. Today on a work break I got the steak cemita. Excellent as well, it's a close second to chicken milanese.Your run of the mill cemitas are about $6 but you can get \"super tortas\" with 3 meats for $8+.Also on visit one I tried some fish tacos and they were...bueno.They've been a little slow on my two visits but the gal is so friendly and everyone's so nice that I can't gig em a star. Maybe because I'm half Griego and also just got back from Mexico, people speak Espanol to me, which I don't speak (but should sit down and learn, doesn't seem too hard and my pronunciation is good apparently)."}, {"review_id": "JSc_j57mC7fkHn6jFaTYsQ", "user_id": "82flOcx1_xWjbwDN3nLLZA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "I love their tacos!   Two weeks ago I called because they shorted me a taco.   Not a big deal, I called and they said they would replace it next time.  Well I ordered tacos today and told them about the taco they owed me.... \"no problem we'll take care of it when you get here\".  I picked up my order...they charged me and I left.  When I got home, I was missing another taco!  When I called they said they didn't charge me for the one they owed me....which was true, but they didn't give it to me either and still shorted my order for today.

Honestly, I'm still not certain what the difference is between cemitas and tortas, but we got two pastora cemitas and it blew our collective minds.If you eat there you get chips and salsa, along with an impressive spread of three great salsas. Their normal red salsa is out of this world, the orange one had quite a bit of heat that snuck up on you, and the green was also great. Our food came super fast, but I definitely could have stuck around and snacked on chips for eternity.The pastor on the cemitas was incredible, I definitely plan on trying some tacos next time we come, which hopefully will be soon.

They're like the classier, more attractive, bigger sibling of the torta. I fell in love with cemitas in the city, and i hated not being able to get one in the suburbs, that is, until i visited Las Cemitas Poblanas.I stopped in on a whim, i mean, it's a little place in the middle of a residential area, and the place seemed pretty low brow. the food however makes up for it, especially the al pastor. A lot of the options on the menu are pretty typical Mexican fare, but the cemitas are as authentic and filling as they come. The Al Pastor cemita is roasty, has a good chipotle smokiness to it, and the flavors are balanced out with the generous toppings and cheese.The sauces on the table are a chipotle red sauce, similar to the sauce that the pork appears to be marinaded in, and an avocado jalapeno green sauce that seems to have a pretty nice kick to it. Service is incredibly attentive and friendly.
