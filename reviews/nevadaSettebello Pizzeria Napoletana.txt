Everything on the pizza tasted so fresh and amazing.  The brochetta was so delicious especially with the pesto sauce. My first time having it and it definitely won't be my last. I had the most amazing pizza as well. Didn't really know most of the ingredients so I just asked our server Tyler what he recommended and he said the Settebello which is a sausage pizza. Their sausage is made in house btw it was amazing. But I love my pepperoni so I added it on to the pizza, it's only $3 and it's totally worth it. But here they call it Calabrese (Calabrese = Pepperoni) But it's sort of a bit spicier pepperoni. OH MY GOD, best pepperoni I've ever tasted. So fresh and crisp and it has a lil kick to it. So freaking good !!!!!! My pizza also came with bacon, olives, pine nuts. And the tomato sauce is so delicious and fresh. I loved it. My boyfriend got the Vico pizza with the marmalade on the side. And that cheese on that pizza was so yummy. It's like a sweet and creamy cheese. It has no tomato sauce on it. Comes with prosciutto, he's a big fan of that. But honestly, the pizza that I got.. the Settebello was the best pizza I've ever tried and you should try it to. I realized that I've been to this restaurant before but in Santa Monica at the marina. And the quality of the food and service is exceptional at both locations. If your craving some authentic and fresh pizza, you gotta come to this place."}, {"review_id": "zikMXy73Fr6rixaX6uYWQg", "user_id": "xOARkxnnSOkmBrXFDYWqKQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Before I ate here the waiter explained to me the crust was thin, crispy, yet chewy and the cheese was a \"wet\" mozzarella.I'll try anything once.A unique pie with unfortunately soggy wet floppy crust was presented to us.

It's kinda soggy and definitely not crunchy at all. When you hold up the slice from the crust side it sags down and needs to be folded to be consumed, which was a surprise. The insalata grande was very good but I wish the pizza was better. The ingredients were quality but I was disappointed that the crust had no crunch.The cannoli dessert looked great but didn't taste as good as it looked. There was an overpowering taste in the cream that I couldn't put my finger on but really ruined it for me.Overall not a great experience."}, {"review_id": "DXWXw7dS9LRAtSCT7igOJw", "user_id": "wGD3H-uSkyhJtJnWaIvJBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "Proceed with caution, may be habit forming.

They have an extremely high quality product at a reasonable price and will definitely continue to visit on a regular basis. This is undoubtedly authentic Neapolitan style pizza paired with so much more for a full dining experience. The interior is understated and industrial, warmed with marble tables and comfortable seating. It reminds me of a no frills- let the product speak for itself east coast pizzeria. I love their lunch options because they offer any pizza on the menu lunch sized and lunch priced at $9, or the classic Marg at $7. The menu features classic pizza styles and many specialty varieties; my personal favorite is the brisket pizza. The flavors are smoky and spicy, complemented by the creamy cheese and chewy, slightly charred crust. I have also tried the Panzanella arugula salad; the flavors are really good, but for my taste the bread component was a little too soft (not enough like a crouton) and ended up soaking up too much of the vinaigrette dressing, making them a bit soggy. The full bar is a huge perk for me! And not always a given at a pizza restaurant. They have a great happy hour as well and all day, daily specials on top of that. Mule Monday's and Margarita Thursday's will ensure I'm a long time patron! In my honest opinion, the service etiquette is standard at best, sometimes maybe even a little detached and perfunctory; but at the end of the day, it is a pizza restaurant, service has always been accurate and never caused any inconvenience or issues so it's not something that dramatically affects the experience- I'm there for the incredible pizza, not for a 5-star service acumen."}, {"review_id": "AzkCHFJOksI9AbRcuCDeCg", "user_id": "1rhTFP_DJ8HI3vdLWSPgSA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "Located at the next block over from The District, it is a quick and convenient walk to enjoy a light bite. This restaurant is a little difficult to find as it is quietly tucked away behind Cheesecake Factory and other eateries that can be seen on the Main Street, but finding this is worth it! We ordered the Margherita pizza, which can easily be split between two people. It is large enough and hearty to fill your bellies without being uncomfortably full! The dough and mozzarella cheese were the best part of the pizza, the sauce was a little watery...however it seems like they make the sauce from scratch as we could see chunks of fresh tomato as we were enjoying our slices. I wish the sauce was a little thicker and less watery since it made the sauced part of the pizza less crispy and I prefer my pizza to be crispy throughout. The prices are comparable to others at $13-$15 per pizza, and they offer a nice variety of dessert varying from tiramisu to gelato (dessert prices range $5-$10), which we will return to try one day. This block has its own free parking lot shared with the other restaurants and Whole Foods."}, {"review_id": "iLeMZRcK9jBoPoyC1FM9sg", "user_id": "85yijeKaN2KxF-QY-x6Alg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "After watching David Chang's show \"Ugly Delicious\" on Netflix. I was craving Lucali Pizza. Or anything of the sort. We usually go to Pizza Rock for a good pie but I've been meaning to hit up Settebello for years but never made it there. Finally. And regret-tingly. Why didn't we go there. We had the salads which were full of flavor. But they filled the plate so much that it was falling off. I don't mind because I wipe down the table with germx anyway so I had a big table sized plate. The Lunch special was spectacular. You can pick any pizza for 9 bucks. Wife had Marg DOC and I had the 4 Cheese. The crust is up there with the best we've ever experienced. Not had. Experienced. Because that's what it was. An experience. Money can't buy that. Panna cotta dessert was spot on but the \"whatever the name is\" dessert with a gelato choice covered in espresso and caramel was one of the better desserts I've had in the last few years. Service was good enough to warrant a decent tip. She came just enough to not wonder where she was. Will def be back. Make the dive and visit ASAP. Even if there's a line. Can't be longer than the 2 hour lucali wait."}, {"review_id": "DAuCCm5aK5lM1F_pN9ul8Q", "user_id": "tm2ZW0fMczxDCT_wyFJkww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/29/2017", "text": "This was my first time trying Settebello Pizzeria. I'm originally from Naples and therefore have a thing for traditional Neapolitan pizza. Settebello did not disappoint. I could tell from the moment that I walked in that the aroma of fresh tomatoes was in the air.I ordered a Margherita DOC pizza which came with buffalo mozzarella as any good pizza should. This was spot on and delicious, everything from the flavor to the crust and texture were perfect. For dessert I ordered a tiramisu which was delicious as well. The tiramisu was very creamy and good, but I thought the mascarpone was slightly too heavy on the coffee for my liking. Ultimately this is a personal preference though and the tiramisu was still amazing despite this.My only comment was about the service which was a bit lacking considering I went during lunch when there were just a few other patrons in the restaurant. Once they served me my pizza they didn't really come back, so I had trouble flagging someone down to order dessert and ultimately get my check. From where I was seated at the bar I noticed the staff sitting in the back playing on their phones so this caused a bit of delay. If the slower service was due to a lot of guests that's one thing, but to have 10 patrons in the place max and still have to flag waiters down was disappointing. Other than this it was a great experience and I'll definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "gVhkdyGGcTKJxx3PY9LAGA", "user_id": "8la7DygWKVkfpDatXztktg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/3/2017", "text": "Been several times. Always great!The pizza size is a hearty meal for one, or a delicious part of a meal for two.My date and I usually split a pizza and a salad (the Beet Salad is a fave!) and that is plenty for two big guys. If we're still hungry, we'll finish up with one of the delicious deserts.  Last night, we shared the seasonal special - the Ripieno Autunno, which was absolutely fantastic! One of my favorite things ever!\"Ripieno\" just means 'stuffed' - and \"Autunno\" (as you might guess) is 'Autumn'.This stuffed and folded pizza was truly special. Sweet squash combined with sausage and a generous amount of fresh sage stuffed into a perfectly baked crust made for a perfect cool-weather repast. Stuffed with Autumn, indeed!As a bonus, we happened to be there on a Thursday - when the drink special is Margaritas of several different sorts for the extremely reasonable price of $4. I had the \"Italian\" Margarita - which had Amaretto and orange juice. Unusual, and I don't know if I'd call it a \"margarita\" - but I liked it! (I had a second). Four drinks, the Ripieno and a very large salad came to just under $50 - which isn't cheap, but is quite reasonable for the quality of the food and the nice-casual vibe of the restaurant."}, {"review_id": "abm4b7HcJcFpCAkRaioUAg", "user_id": "YfcXpAQtz0n84aqw_CtNvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Love their pizza!

The salad is so delicious with fresh beets. They give you the red and orange ones and well dressed arugula salad. I ordered the brisket pizza. It was good with melted white cheese and brisket beef with onions. I do feel that the pizza gets kind of soggy in the middle which was a little unpleasant. The crust though taste great if you dip it in vinaigrette. My friends all got the setebello pizza which was good as well. I do feel like it had a lot on it also making it pretty soggy, but it could be because of the rustic dough they use. Overall, good lunch spot with a good pizza deal and salad.

It's the perfect combo of sweet plus spicy and you won't regret your choice. The marmalade is just a light glaze on top, it does not replace the sauce. Settebello Pizza: Heavy on the meat, lacking in flavor. It was just a regular thin crust pizza with heavy toppings, but nothing special. Skip it and go for something that stands out a little more. The Summerlin location has a fig marmalade which beats the jalapeno.
