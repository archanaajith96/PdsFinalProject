The displays are fun to look at while you walk around picking out your food. They have a wide variety of food selections and their food is fresh, quality is high. Each station was clean and decorated nicely. Their seafood was stacked to the top, and their meat sauces are containers that flow out.  I love their dessert section, there's so much to choose from, and they have so many flavors of gelatos. I literally took one of each dessert to take a bite and try everything. I was like a kid at a candy shop.  Last year when I came here with my girls and we waited on the line for 40 minutes just to eat dinner. A few weeks ago, I bought the VIP groupon brunch deal for 2, which included 2 mimosas and no wait in line. My husband and I got there around 245 and stayed till after they started serving dinner. Got some of the dinner meats before we left. This is also the only buffet where they take your picture on the line so they can try to sell photos of your memorable experience to you while you're eating. No thanks.  I'm glad I finally brought my husband here because he was tired of me telling him how amazing it was that my girls and I had food comas on the table after dessert last year. This year he was almost passed out on the table."}, {"review_id": "5Byr2WaE2AUPbtvUMpxHqQ", "user_id": "9jusjnPSisIssrk1RQ1ZAQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "After all the years running an All You Can Eat buffet, you'd think Caesar's Palace would figure out how to take a customer's money quickly and seat that customer promptly.  But they apparently haven't figured that out yet.  Hardly any people in line, yet it took 7 minutes for me to reach a cashier, then 5 more minutes in a second line waiting for a table.  For the outrageous price, you'd think a cash customer deserved better service.The food is diverse, with some unusual items like Osso Buco, Bone Marrow, Har Gaw, Escargots, Menudo, Green Tea Gelato and others.  All of these are very expertly prepared, so that part is good.  It's that lengthy wait that  prompts me to rate them three stars instead of four.If you prefer a traditional diet instead of the exotic fare mentioned above, you can find a better priced buffet in Vegas than the $55 that Caesar's charges.  It's your choice."}, {"review_id": "WBqN36oYYPEww7ugqIKx2A", "user_id": "guo4xumyo3ZLa6z49hyh0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "This is my all-time favorite buffet in Las Vegas. While many others choose either quality or quantity, Bacchanal is able to serve up both!Came here on a Sunday around 1:40, and was able to get both the brunch and dinner menu in the time we were there.I always start off from the back, mainly going for a few dumplings, sushi, and making my way over for some crab legs, which are always nice and sweet. It's in the back where you can get the hot crab legs.  I grab a cold pressed juice and that will be my first plate. Then I go for some of the meats! They have wagyu beef and bone marrow. You eat that and a couple of crab legs, and I think you've covered the cost of your plate! If I have room, I'll most likely  get something at the noodle station or go straight for dessert. They have crepes, gelato, and a huge variety of cakes and other miscellaneous desserts. Being an avid creme brûlée fan, I'll usually go straight for that and some gelato!It was $75+ when they first opened, so I'm happy to see the price has gone down. I'm worried that it'll start affecting the quality of the food, but it hasn't been too bad, and it's still my favorite. The staff is also great which just puts this place over the top! Like others have said, there is a line, but it'll all be worth it!"}, {"review_id": "Pz03T9Bh55264AyE7rpByg", "user_id": "Rg2J4V438Tmpl5W317D3oQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I have eaten here several times and have been very satisfied every time. This place is located inside beautiful Caesars Palace. This last time we came for brunch..we had a Groupon and I highly recommend using if you want to save a few bucks. I'm Diamond with Caesars entertainment, so I get ViIP entrance weather or not I have the Groupon. The pictures I have taken over the years speak a thousand words! There are too many incredible things to list and I wish I had a bigger stomach so I could eat more when I come here! But, I have to say, it really is my favorite of all the buffets in Las Vegas that I have tried. The service is excellent and the seating is more upscale than other buffets and comfortable. I recommend the seafood bar that has oysters and hot crab legs. The stone crab is amazing but can be challenging to crack! I Love the lobster Benedict that comes on a fluffy biscuit. I also went back for more shrimp and grits. Then there are the meats! Get a cut of the bacon slab, the prime rib, and the Waygu beef. Everything seasoned perfectly and tender and juicy. Pancakes, chicken and waffles, this brunch has it all and all you can eat! Move on to the desserts! Oh My! Fresh made crepes and chocolate soufflé while you wait. The choices of gelato are amazing. Check this place out when you are hungry! Be sure to give yourself plenty of time to savor the moment! I will be back!!"}, {"review_id": "aAKA1VX8lLkSw8mzU9KqFg", "user_id": "SoiacX2r2mvHqIh3GgRMUw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I am finally getting to redo this review.

We went during Easter weekend and it was a bit pricey that entire weekend at 59.99. There's always a line at Bacchanal but they do message you when it is your turn to come in. The buffet was divided into different section including asian, italian, seafood and dessert. I am sure I missed a few sections. They had quite a bit of exotic fancier foods such as bone marrow, elk burger and American Wagyu during the Easter special. There was also a taco and crepe station that was made to order. They also had a noodle bar that was custom made and included noodles options such as pho, wonton soup, laksa, ramen and few others as well.

By the time we got seated, they were serving dinner. This was a win for me because I got to enjoy the crab legs! However, the disappointing part about the crab legs is that they aren't self-serve like the rest of the buffet. Depending on which server you get, there is a chance that you may get a plate full of water and very few legs. I'd much rather prefer to get my own instead of having to make multiple trips to get a decent amount. The warm crab legs are in the back near the pizza area, while the cold ones are in the front. The wait time can be long, so be sure to get there early if you have time restraints. I went through the VIP line and was still in line for about 45 mins before being seated, which is the exact time that the hostess quoted. They have a lot of your typical buffet items with the addition of some not so common items such as softshell crab!This buffet is probably one of the more expensive ones, so I recommend checking out a groupon or other sites for deals. I enjoyed it and was worth the money in my opinion. I used a groupon and got the brunch for 2 for $88 which included 2 drinks each."}, {"review_id": "B6Yd2fZhK7bVJSp6lFHAaw", "user_id": "NO7hzgi7ZS3b2D5gNi2Gfg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "This was only the second time I've been to Bacchanal, so I'd forgotten how many OPTIONS they have! I brought some friends from out of town here so they could experience a \"true Vegas buffet,\" but places like Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan are different - I like to describe them as \"smaller portioned gourmet.\" By this I mean most of these dishes are already portioned off into a small bowl/plate, but as with any buffet, you can obviously choose how many portions you pick up and eat. This, in my mind, helps me float around and really sample more without getting overly full right off the bat.They have multiple sections in their buffet; seafood, American (Elk Burgers were a unique sampling), Latin foods (they had a killer Posole), Asian, Italian, etc. Some of my personal favorites were the avocado toast with lump crab, the deviled egg with bacon, while I don't like horseradish, the bone marrow was surprisingly scrumptious (for my first time ever having bone marrow). The crab never fails, either. Within each entry there was a significant range of options, so I never felt limited to  chow mein, Mongolian beef, and fried rice, like you'd see at most buffets: there was an Asian Soup Bar, for crying out loud! Finally the desserts: aside from the gelato and crepe lines, there were miniature portions, absolutely beautifully presented, of everything from cheesecake, dulce de ledge flan, crème brûlée, and so on. Absolutely comprehensive across the broad, and most importantly, they did not sacrifice quality or taste in this endeavor. Highly recommend for anyone, and be sure to try the peach green tea!!"}, {"review_id": "e9gYrXwl-EOpssIAMlrmCA", "user_id": "WXDj6mmyrJi5q5nHKJ6H7w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "With all of the places to go on Valentines Day in Las Vegas, my wife and I decided to engorge ourselves at the Bacchanal Buffet 8-)We went through the VIP line and had no wait. We ordered some waters and juice and began our trek through the maze of foods from all around the world. Near the entrance there were quite a few interesting items I had to try: frog legs 4/5, bone marrow 2/5, fried octopus 4/5, oysters 3/5 very big, a couple plates full of crab legs (get a cracker as they are not easy to peel) 5/5 and plenty of shrimp 4/5. Next we ventured to Asia to try some sushi 4/5, fried shrimp and rice, bao buns and dumplings. Then off to Europe for some pasta and meatballs 4/5, pizza and polish sausage 5/5. After about four plates of food we decided we better head to the desserts before we ran out of room.For dessert we stayed in Europe and had crepes made fresh with a variety of toppings and some macaroons. On the crepe I topped mine with fried bananas, candied almonds and a caramel sauce. It's a must to top it off with powdered sugar and whipped cream ;-) 5/5We tried almost all of the dessert items between us including donuts, cream brûlée, cheesecake, chocolate dipped strawberries, cookies, flan, sticky buns, gelato and they also had an assortment of candy bars and candy. We asked for wheel barrows when leaving but they were fresh out. Thank you Bacchanal Buffet for a World tour.We decided to walk around the strip after our meal to work off some of the calories we in-took.

Everything from amazing seafood to an excellent carving station to a huge array of dim sum, sushi, and Asian noodles. I loved that many of the dishes were plated as nice individual plates rather than a large tray. The attention to detail was spot on and everything was delicious. My favorites were the lamb t-bone and all of the desserts. If you're planning on coming make sure you have an empty stomach because you'll want to try everything. The service was phenomenal; everyone was very friendly and attentive. Literally every time I went to get food, when I came back to the table my dirty plates were taken away. This has probably been one of the best dining experiences I've ever had and I am not exaggerating. I came with a group of friends from school and I can speak for everyone that we all had the time of our lives and had a truly memorable experience and meal. I will definitely be coming back here in the future when I'm in Vegas again.

You wait forever to pay sky-high prices for so-so food. If you came to Vegas to feast, this is not the place.We hadn't ate all day in anticipation for this meal. First, we joined the online line using the app. When that line was done, we had to wait in an actual line for 30 minutes at the entrance of the restaurant. You pay upfront, $60 per person for dinner. I thought I was insane to pay that kind of price, but I read about this being a once-in-a-lifetime experience.The place was huge and very crowded, but we had a nice table. We waited in long lines for food and everything was laid out in a messy way (food remains on the counter). They had so many cuisines; I can't even try to name them all. However, nothing was great. The sushi was not fresh, the crab claws had a strange taste, and the oysters were just inedible. Quite liked the lamb chops and salmon though.I had five plates of food and don't remember most of what I had. Afterwards, two plates of dessert. I was disappointed though. I saw a \"chef\" literally unloading macarons from a plastic container, like the kind you get at Costco. Cheap and not made in-house! Many were broken too. I really wanted a souffle, but none were out that night. However, I did see some failed ones behind the counter. Chefs can't even cook a souffle!Service wasn't great. No one ever came to refill our drinks until we chased a waiter down. All-in-all, incredibly overpriced. Walked out so full and threw up later that night. Probably my own fault, but I really wanted to get my money's worth.
