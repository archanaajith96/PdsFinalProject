The toast is intertwined with layers of sugary cinnamon, topped with peaches, pecans, butter and whipped cream. Their plain French toast is the same dreamy cinnamon pattern with powdered sugar on top, a pitcher of maple syrupcomes with for sweet tooth maniacs. Imagine Cinnebon French toast ++.     The corned beef is lean and tasty, with creamy gravy, hash brown potatoes and scrambled eggs all done perfectly.    The bacon is twice lifesize and the scrambled eggs are done just right.   They specialize in Benedict style eggs and they have 20 different combos. They also serve huevos rancheros and related Hispanic breakfasts.   Just a hint; They really get busy after 8:30 AM on weekdays but the number of servers more than doubles. We arrived at 7 AM and they were busywith two capable servers.    For selection, taste, and service, these folks are the best."}, {"review_id": "RD-h2L4moxfqJFm2VrtfUA", "user_id": "sgHqcP8Oqt0iSwef8cKihQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "my SO and i decided to try the location on campbell and it is now our fav breakfast place to date!  it is bigger, obv newer than the broadway location, and just brighter and less...worn.  the food is fantastic.  we have been there twice; i had the blueberry pancakes, which were done perfectly and arrived steaming hot.  the ice tea wasn't watered down and refills were offered frequently.  my husband said his ham and basted eggs were great and the coffee was good and hot. although the bean wasn't his all time fav, it wasn't weak.  service was not rushed (a tues morning around 9am) and our server was really quick, super pleasant and recited the specials without our needing to ask her.just love this place!  check it out if youlove breakfast as much as we do. :)came back to tucson (while chicago was fighting a blizzard...mid-april) and baja never disappoints!met friends who live in tucson and had never been, so pleased that they loved their breakfast as much as we do!  our orders were perfectly executed, service was terrific and refills were given without asking.  clean and inviting, a super place to eat.thanks, baja!"}, {"review_id": "9UkWmShQQxxwzf4CYRNJjw", "user_id": "CUAeSShXPnmwdV6OBTU7qw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "TIP: DO NOT ORDER THE BLOODY MARYS. Worst bloody Mary's I have EVER tried. They taste like salty bad tomato juice. Unless you want to die of sodium poisoning, if that's you, go ahead and drink them. My husband and I both ordered the huevos rancheros with brisket, it was definitely delicious and the reason why im giving them such a good rating. Additionally our waitress was very nice and understanding when we sent back the drinks and since she couldn't get the drinks off our ticket, she gave us a complimentary pancake.Wait time was reasonable but I'm definitely very upset about the bad drinks.

(Union Station) to Tucson - AKA; I was starving. We arrived at about 8AM, so there was no weekend rush right. We were able to get seated right away, and I couldn't wait to devour on some good breakfast. They had a huge breakfast menu, but what caught my attention was the extensive list of benedict options - I must've died and went to heaven! I ordered The Leprechaun, which was phenomenal. It had corned beef in it, which is already a winner in my book. My fiancee had The Tombstone, which had a TexMex flair, but was also delicious (I snagged a bite or two). My cousin ordered I believe what was called 'Welcome Home', which instead of an english muffin, it was supplemented with a tamale style pancake; MINDBLOWING! I didn't rate this a 5-star though, because unfortunately the service didn't match up to the level of the food. I understand that people have their bad days, but our server was just not doing it for us. I'll update my review when I go back again."}, {"review_id": "OkPPRDtuJ_8NdeTldu4ixg", "user_id": "lBWWgqiJ6h7mm1szGhMz0g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "At first the hosting service was turnoff but 1 Staff/ wAiter turned it around and was awesome!

Best place to go if you're an early bird, grabbing brunch or lunch with your friends. I ordered the Tucson burger and snickerdoodle pancakes. The tucson burger has guacamole, green chile and bacon and it is DELICIOUS. I don't know what it is about their bacon but it is to die for! Do yourself a favor and order a side of bacon if the meal you're ordering doesn't include it.The snickerdoodles pancake is huge and can easily be shared between two people. The pancake is so good you don't even need syrup. If that statement doesn't want to make you try their pancakes then I don't know what will.Another bonus is that they have an outdoor patio! We love to take our dog with us and the staff are always so accommodating. In summary, 5 stars on food and service.

Their menu, specializing in variations of eggs Benedict and pancakes, have a wide variety of items on their menu. As you can read from the many reviews here, Baja Cafe does them all right.I had the \"Anomaly\" eggs Benedict. Here's the description:Mac and cheese waffles placed over a tomatillo green chili sauce. Topped with a combination of julienne bell peppers,  fire roasted green chilies, caramelized onions and our house smoked habanero chicken sausage. Finished with poached eggs, smoked gouda cheese sauce and pico de gallo.Yes, did you read that? \"MAC AND CHEESE waffles.\" Did you oooh and aaah at that description? I did, too. That's why I ordered it. Bonus--since it was my first time there, I got one of their famous Snickerdoodle pancakes gratis. The Anomaly was tasty. The mac and cheese waffles were interesting and gave a good flavor balance. Because of the chilis, this meal definitely has a kick to it. Baja Cafe really does a poached egg right. The yokes were perfectly creamy. The whole eggs were nicely oval all the way around, not flattish as you would have a poached egg done in your pan at home.It also comes with a side of hash browns. I'm pretty picky with my hash browns and these were excellent. The Snickerdoodle pancake was amazing. Not too sweet.The service was great. Our waiter was friendly, informative, and attentive. The lighting was surprisingly dark. It was dark. You get used to it.I would go back just for the poached egg. But I look forward to trying many of their other menu items.5* = A top favorite. Mind-blowing good. I will definitely return and I will go out of my way to go here. Worth every dime of my money.4* = Outstanding. Tucson-top-tier. Some elements not quite as good as it gets, but it still is worthy of my regular business.3* = Good experience. I might do repeat business if it is convenient, the only option, the only one in its category, or on a whim, but would not be among the first thing to come to mind. Would definitely recommend you trying it to get your own take on it.2* = Not so good. Would not recommend at all. Waste of money.1* = How are they still in business?

I have to come back here any time I visit or bring a friend who's never been to Tucson. Baja Cafe has the best selection of eggs benedict. Hands down. Theres no competition. And I'm not talking about your classic poached egg, hollandaise sauce, and English muffin. Depending on what you order, the Benedict's can have avocado, duck, smoked/pulled pork or chicken, chorizo, veggies, and some house sauces that are extremely tasty. They also have a new featured benedict each week. These are some of the best that you can get. I had an empanada benedict with pulled pork when it was their featured one, and it was amazing. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Their pancakes are absolutely delicious (snickerdoodle, cinnamon swirl), their Belgian waffles are to die for, and if you're still not excited, they have a dish called the \"KingKong\" that is a meat lovers dream. And if I remember correctly, they smoke all their meats in house.All of their food is jam packed with flavor and no matter what you're feeling, sweet or savory, they will definitely have something for you.

I don't really remember much of anything except for the fact that, it being my first visit to the location, I was given a free pancake with a sweet sauce layered on top, and I really enjoyed it. My dad did not enjoy his pancake as much and he felt kind of blah about his breakfast. But I am intrigued to return and try more and check it out.
