The empanadas were great and the \" Chicharrones\" were so fresh! Also the steak was awesome. The meat was tender and vey well marinated and seasoned. Also the Fried Plantains were very well done. You can tell they weren't pre-frozen!"}, {"review_id": "fmyfNO4ojKLAcrQwcl7VsA", "user_id": "X8dDYSX_xwK3-91g_qWyWA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Surprising in such a \"small\" location. But my wife and I were very pleased with the food, and the modest atmosphere. Forget the atmosphere- the food was great!  We tried to share several things, but they were too big and too good to finish. Try this place.  You will not be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "q5x64SyI0nWbcFFhMl89DQ", "user_id": "M2NS_aQbMY2apoYjTlOCng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/3/2017", "text": "Owners Adriana Scarpetta and Triny Silva and their Colombian restaurant were some of the unfortunate victims of the Sept. 5, 2015, arson fire that destroyed the Boise International Market at Curtis and Franklin. Like a Phoenix, El Cafetal has risen from the ashes 15 miles away on Garrity Boulevard, near the Nampa airport.The restaurant specializes in many dishes that may be unfamiliar to locals whose only exposure to Latin American food is American-style Mexican. Arepas (filled masa pillows), empanadas, Colombian tamales and beef, chicken and fish entrees are all on the menu. My friend Drew recommended El Cafetal and I drove over from Boise as soon as I could. What a treat.I ordered a fish dish that wasn't on the menu but which I had found pictured on El Cafetal's Facebook page. Whole fish paired with yuca and coconut milk in a rich sauce and served with smashed plantains and avocado slices.I also ordered a guava drink.Everything was delicious and the service by the owners and another employee was friendly and efficient. I'm really glad I discovered this gem of a restaurant and will return soon."}, {"review_id": "1dN52to8UQRn5lNEBLvcjA", "user_id": "7pG99hFW0eRH_XBvvd7xIA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/20/2017", "text": "Seriously if you missed the Colombian Restaurant from Boise International Market then you found it! Food is still great and friendly service! We had the sampler plate and it was delicious if you like everything fried. I had the guava juice because it's one of my favorite tropical fruits. It closes early unfortunately and I was not crazy about the location. Nampa is known for their Mexican heritage so not sure how many people even know there is a South American restaurant in Nampa. I think if it was in Boise it would have gotten more attention. Anyways!

It wasn't busy and very clean inside. We liked the interior decor and furniture. The menu is interesting, as we'd never had Colombian food before. Something to note is that nearly everything is fried or deep fried. We got the appetizer sampler, combo #2 & #3, and corn cakes. Combo #2 was absolutely delicious; it was a stuffed potato with plantains, guava, and cheese. The sampler was pretty greasy but my family enjoyed it. Would recommended-- especially if you're tired of Nampa's narrow food selection."}, {"review_id": "FZuBUnkqtF8p334N2wF2mA", "user_id": "Oa7KgrLhAfT3L8NxcBHLVQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2017", "text": "This place was a big hit at the Boise International Market.  It's a longer drive now but the food is worth it.

I've traveled around Colombia, my mother is from Bogota, and I am familiar with the cuisine. My daughter and I loved it all. It's the real deal. Both ladies working were friendly. We ate a traditional tamale loaded with meat, potato, and vegetable. These are bigger than the Mexican style tamales.  One can be a meal in itself, especially because they serve it with a side of rice.  The carne with arepa and salad was standard fare with a generous portion of meat. The highlight was the papas rellenas. This is one of my daughter's favorites. It wasn't fried into a perfect sphere, but it tasted delicious.  The meat was seasoned just right.  The outer layer of potato was crispy and the inside soft.  I had to stop her from eating the entire thing.  They serve Lulo juice, which was a pricey but surprising treat to see on a menu in Boise. We can't wait to return to try the arequipe, platanos, and stuffed arepas."}, {"review_id": "j52bq-W0vqZqtwRcU16rVQ", "user_id": "A6vYPqPYugnVHeFYYZu_ig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2015", "text": "Went here today for lunch.
