When we looked up Doo-Dah on Yelp, there were 432 parties ahead of us and the wait was days.  Not to worry.  We checked in with our phone number to hold a place in line, and when we arrived we were only about 10th in line.  Be sure to sit at the counter."}, {"review_id": "0GQUNu8lv5A0nrWYCPDfaA", "user_id": "L0GbCPzB_5MkdNINiCIyrQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "I'm a fan of the Doo Dah.  Got a recommendation from a local and arrived just after opening.  Love to see the early shift so dedicated to getting the locals off to work with a full stomach, so I tried the local grub.  Based on a review I tried the corned beef hash.I sat at the counter and talked with the wait staff as they did their chores and watched the cooks go about their business.  Everyone was professional and the food all looked great.  Coffee arrived in seconds, and that's where the rubber met the road.  Flat line!  No flavor at all, but it didn't taste bad.  Then someone else brought some monkey bread.  It was good but I guess I wasn't in the mood for something so sweet, so I only ate half of it ;-).  Apparently the hash is made to order, and I have to say it was pretty good.  Not as tasty as I thought it would be even with the chilies but overall good.  The eggs were perfect and the biscuit was maybe the best I've had in a long time, especially with their special jam on it.  The guy next to me had pork belly with grits and eggs, enough food to last a guy for 2 days, but I have to say it looked pretty good and was meant to sustain a hard working guy through a day like today is shaping up to be.This wasn't the best food, or breakfast I've ever had but it is made with care and served by the nicest wait staff.  I will be back."}, {"review_id": "ZD-05IcXu6de6UztWDjPfQ", "user_id": "fuslIq-ZJCd-qornjEokUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "At the recommendation of several locals I made my way to the Doo-Dah Diner for breakfast. Plain and simple, I was not disappointed.The service was great, the food lived up to the hype, and I'm very excited about making a return visit when I come back to Wichita.I am a sucker for corned beef hash and eggs. If it's on the menu I'm more than likely going to order it and today was no exception. In my experience, I have found this dish to be very hit or miss depending on what restaurant you're eating at.

Monkey bread: I know it's poor form to complain about something that's free, but it was not as warm or soft as I expectedChicken and noodles: 1 note, flavor and texture-wise. It was akin to a chicken pot pie filling, heavy in sauce. Biscuit: moist and dense, which I like. Coffee: weakCrab cake Benedict: lacked crab and overall dish just had mushy texture; best part was the poached eggChicken and waffles: house-made white meat tenders were well-seasoned; waffle was nothing special I hope that you go and are pleasantly surprised. If you do, definitely call ahead or use the Yelp check-in to decrease your wait time.

Oh, our server Robin is the best! She's funny and attentive most of the time. If she forgets something she says that's what happens when we have an \"old lady as a waitress\".  .

Seriously. We, however, were sat immediately...without call ahead. We came on Sunday, for the brunch buffet, it'll cost you $20/head but I'm not gonna lie, it's worth it. If you need to skip eating a couple days, don't hesitate because you're going to be sad when you're full. I promise. No matter how much you manage to eat, you'll mourn that moment when it is finally your last bite.On to the service, friendly, quick, attentive, and non-judging. Which, let's all be honest, is half the battle when you have a server at a buffet. The food...first of all, there is no menu service on Sunday, but there is a small cook-to-order menu that can be selected from, included in the buffet price. This food comes out relatively quick and is hot and fresh. The monkey bread shelf life is short though, so eat it quick. Once you place your drink order, and any cook-to-order items, you may enjoy the buffet.The buffet has a stack of fun mismatched plates that plays into the charm and gives you the feel of going to your country gramma's (not grandma) house for Sunday feast, and when you start down the line, the charm continues. Get the pig plate because...it's cute. There are many things to choose from, I'm not sure what a regular week looks like, but this particular week was quite the spread. Scrambled eggs, fried potatoes*, corned beef hash*, hash brown casserole*, pepper maple bacon*, jalapeño bacon*, sausage patties, waffles*, berry compote sauce, bananas foster sauce*, biscuit*, sausage gravy*, green chili sauce, chicken tenders*, steak fingers, meat loaf, mashed potatoes, green beans*, white gravy, cheese grits*, fruit, salmon, and I'm sure I'm forgetting stuff. I know I must be. I starred things I tried. On the cook-to-order menu, \"limited\" options... include crab cake benedict*, steak and eggs* (also benedict, not indicated), another benedict dish, banana bread French toast, two eggs cooked to order, monkey bread*, omelette (made with your choice of toppings...you've got like 12 or so to choose from), possibly a couple other things, I forgot to take a picture of it. You can order as much as you want, and as I was lamenting my full belly that could eat no more, our neighbor diners were being served an excellent looking banana bread French toast which WILL be a selection on our next visit. My hubby has a different philosophy to buffets than I do...I take a little of everything that looks good...he grab a good portion of everything thing looks good and orders anything that sounds good. I probably wouldn't have tried either of the benedict dishes if he hadn't ordered them, but I did. If you like benedict, you'd probably like them. I, however, am not a fan of hollandaise sauce, which each dish was generously smothered in, despite this, they're probably some of the better benedicts I've had. I still didn't like them, but I don't like eggs benedict, so don't hold this against DDD chefs, it WAS beautifully made. You gotta love crab to like the crab cake...which I do, but it's weird for breakfast to me. I don't know. On to my favorites: Corned beef hash, it's good, it would still be good if it were just hash without the corned beef. The mix of veggies and potatoes was excellent, and had good texture. Fried potatoes...simple and tasty, went back for seconds. Biscuit...is a meal all it's own. This is a stout and tasty biscuit. Chicken tenders...after sitting a while had good flavor...but when they are fresh...oh my nelly...so good. I ate them with my favorite part of breakfast...waffles with banana foster. I don't do sweet breakfast, I'd rather be hungry most days than eat sweet breakfast...but bananas foster waffles from Doo-Dah Diner could quickly convert me. Do yourself a favor and make this place happen for you. Their hours are obscure, but not impossible. I apologize for not getting this review out sooner, as they are closed already today, and the soonest you could get in to check them out is Wednesday at this point but definitely get yourself there if you're in the Wichita vicinity. Totally worth the effort, and if you're worried about a wait, call ahead."}, {"review_id": "-_d6FApNte_HUf4jfmXfKA", "user_id": "nJ1WUaxa6BZnyEWy13KZnA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "I am a breakfast snob and when in Witchita this is a must stop.

Every freaking thing was out of this world! Bite after bite my eyes were rolling in delight! The server was so on top of her game and so nice and eager to serve! I just don't see that level of service anymore.  I had smoked salmon that would make you weap!

Their coffee is bottomless, I think I left there on a caffeine high as the waitress continuously filled my cup- not a bad thing! I ordered an egg white omelet with a home made biscuit... ORDER THE HOME MADE BISCUIT, its really good! The omelets was decent I was annoyed that all the ingredients were a fee, there were no bases that you could go with, so it could get pricey if you added all the items. Really fun place.
