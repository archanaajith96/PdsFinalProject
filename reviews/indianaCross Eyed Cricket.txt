I'm just being honest maybe when I go back again I will update this review but it wasn't a good experience While you're trying to have breakfast."}, {"review_id": "Qp7nELk_ru2dwgxJffWpZg", "user_id": "888kU60LXoTG3jL31GxNHQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/17/2017", "text": "I've eaten here in the past and knew they had good fried chicken so I convinced my husband that we should go here for Sunday dinner and to get pie that he wanted for his recent birthday.They were under staffed but the waitress was flying around like crazy trying to accommodate the several tables that were in there. It took a bit of time, but this isn't a fast food restaurant. We had all ordered fried chicken as white meat. At the last minute, waitress came and told us they were out of white meat and it would be another 20 minutes if we wanted to wait. My husband decided he'd accept dark meat and we were served our food shortly after. Chicken was hot, but a little dry. Mashed potatoes weren't great but okay. The macaroni and cheese was fantastic and my green beans were perfectly seasoned and tender. Dinner rolls were pretty bad.It was a Sunday, and you get a free slice of pie with a purchase from their Sunday menu which is 11.98 for an entree and 3 sides. I think that includes a drink unless the waitress had forgotten to charge us. My pie was chocolate and was good, but I wouldn't consider it a full slice, it was small. My husband got coconut and he liked it, too small. We noticed the pie is $5 per slice, so I hope if you order it, that comes in a bigger slice or I'd be really disappointed.Over all good, not great or memorable."}, {"review_id": "ri0oSWFAsAu_gIYzgRB-sA", "user_id": "uf--NcUIlEMTAeP34KDNFg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/21/2017", "text": "Do not come here if you are looking for table cloths and squeaky clean environment.  If you just love food ... come on in!  This place is always crowded when I am here ..Saturday and Sunday breakfasts are my regular visitation times. The staff is polite and keeps my tea filled with lots of lemon.. haha and that is important. Next let me say Bacon .. yummy .. thick slices and lots of it.  No skimpy portions.  I love that when I order sliced tomatoes, the staff lets me knowIf they are not in season!  I have had grits, gravy, eggs, chorizo skillet, bacon and I have never had a complaint... They have homemade pie they were giving away with lunch on Sunday .. yummy.. too bad I was there for breakfast. Parking is always crowded but you can usually find a space.. sometimes if they are crowded you may have to sit with someone else at a big table .. just sayin 4 stars because I know that one person out there is going to go 5 stars really!?!
