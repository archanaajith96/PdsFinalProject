We received a warm welcome and seated right away. The sushi was better than I expected for mall sushi in South Dakota. We shared 4 rolls - crazy eel, salmon roll, spicy crab, and dynamite roll. All of them were pretty good, but I probably wouldn't order the dynamite again. The miso soup was also a little too salty for my taste. The customer service and cleanliness were a big plus for our experience here."}, {"review_id": "LlOCBY55mKk2CiSqwzsq4A", "user_id": "sxEzazybwfF86Mv8Dm3tgw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/8/2017", "text": "5 stars for the delicious poke bowl, ($19.00), and the great service!  They were behind at the sushi bar when we arrived, but our waiter was up front about it and apologized that there would be a bit longer wait than usual.  Staff checked back on us several times and kept us abreast of the situation.  They handled it very well.  It happens.The fish was perfect!  And plenty of ginger with the poke bowl...

If you come afterwards, it could get expensive. There is a lot of fish in the sushi rolls which is a plus because a lot of places skimp on the fish while overloading the rice. This place doesn't do it which is always a plus. The reason why I give them 2 stars is because I got really sick after eating here one night. I've never had a problem in the past but there was something wrong with the fish that resulted in me puking and running to the toilet numerous times throughout the night."}, {"review_id": "fZkbrKJMHKFTfBqS6VRa-g", "user_id": "S3nlJPj53-0SLjoAwler_w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/9/2016", "text": "Okay, this place won me over the instant it served me sake in a champagne glass. How delightful and unexpected from a place attached to a mall in Rapid City! The sake was fine, but the options weren't anything to write home about.The sushi is also surprisingly good considering it's in the middle of the country. I try not to be a snob, but I definitely did not have high expectations heading in. I had the Red Dragon Roll, which is basically spicy tuna with a spicy tuna topping. It was very good! The edamame I ordered with it was a bit oversalted, but eh, it can always be wiped off.Definitely a good, cheaper place to stop for a quick sushi fix out in the Black Hills."}, {"review_id": "jeh7m5mw8guIsRVlqbmvgA", "user_id": "J7xfPnLSszk8jilmlQRNfw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "Fantastic lunch specials that just keep me coming back for more!!

I have to say, that here in South Dakota--a state I associate more with walleye and northern pike than ahi and hamachi--we found a gem of a sushi joint just a short drive from Mt. Rushmore!Our takeout sushi meal was prepared with all the skill and refinement you might expect at a schwanky sushi place in Culver City or Pasadena. The fish was as fresh as we could want, the rice was perfect with just the right amount of vinegar and sugar, and the rolls were downright pretty.Prices were not bad, either, considering the efforts that must be taken to ensure that fish arrives and is served \"sushi grade\" just east of the Black Hills.Inside, you'd swear you weren't eating at a mall; for our part, it was easier to get everything to go and dine on our motel beds than traipse-in with kids and donning road trip garb.Speaking strictly as an out-of-towner, more likely to take campy pictures at historical landmarks and marvel at the pheasants and pronghorns hanging out along the highway, I was pleasantly surprised and satisfied with our decision to Mack on some maki, with thunderstorms as background ambiance. Big city living is different than my extended family's small town on the other side of the state, but when you're on vacation, you sort of roll with it.We didn't have to roll nothing to enjoy these rolls and sushi treats. Good eats, and I definitely recommend if you're ever in Rapid City and looking for a viable alternative to Arby's."}, {"review_id": "8Ks6GHPe0ErCdW26uy90Nw", "user_id": "NA7qzMehJUf4KGq3DY6OVQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/18/2017", "text": "Amazing!!!

However, for someone who knows all about sushi and a ton about Japanese food and culture, the food was mediocre. The egg rolls were burning hot, and a member of our party even burned her hand trying to eat one. The rolls weren't bad per say, but they just lacked general flavor. The ponzu wasn't that great either way. They made their kanisu (which they call the Naruto roll) with ponzu, which I've never seen before (it's usually eaten with rice vinegar). The bubble tea smoothie was good, but I was disappointed that it came only as a frozen smoothie and not in a milk tea. However, the highlight was by far our waitress. She was sweet and funny, and we talked about Japan and gave us suggestions of places to eat there; I even got to speak a bit of Japanese with her, which was delightful. Overall, my whole party agreed that the best part of the meal was the service; unconventional, but not bad either.UPDATE: 6/17/2017So apparently, they did not charge us for our side sauce, which was my mistake. However, another waiter informed us that side sauce was extra, so that has been very confusing."}, {"review_id": "MIxhY5-Ve5PuL8fPnD2-2w", "user_id": "mCVZ8WjEVOVjvx33XKko8g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/12/2017", "text": "Located in a good location but hard to find based in GPS or address.Special Rolls are excellent.

The special comes with 3 variations of salmon sushi.  An Avocado Salmon roll, Salmon Sashimi, and sliced raw salmon. Man it is good!My wife gets another special from the back of the menu.

Server #3 on our receipt), and she was sweet, bubbly, attentive, and delightful.

I've eaten at all the sushi places in the area, and have to admit that I had been making concessions and lowering my sushi standards because well, SD. I just came from Seattle where there are probably more sushi places than American restaurants and felt like most of the places I've tried so far were not very fresh and had at least 1 disappointing roll on my plate. It sucks to feel like you've wasted money, but this place almost made me feel like I gained some money and actually had a few rolls that are better than in Seattle! I've been so impressed as to come here twice in one week! Best things I tried/ very unique: Sweet potato roll (deeply flavorful, warm, and with a sticky sweet sauce/ crispy sesame seeds) Pineapple Sake (chilled, house marinated pineapples come with the sake) Avocado peanut rolls (never heard of these before but crunchy roasted peanuts inside add some good texture and protein). As a vegetarian who loves and craves sushi, I am deeply appreciative to find a place that uses almost as much brainpower, creativity, and passion for the veggie menu as for the regular menu. I hope they continue to innovate in this area! The atmosphere is cute and would be a good spot for a date. Despite being in the mall, you really feel transported to a stand alone tropical dining room. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family in Rapid City- we are lucky to have them!"}, {"review_id": "9WcOoRg3-xHOH7AUKzWlfA", "user_id": "2lL_NphrhQTJy2nW_k4x-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/5/2016", "text": "They have an awesome happy hour deal every day from 3-6, my boyfriend and I can get dinner and drinks (glasses of beer, sake, and wine are buy one get one free!) for under 30 bucks, including the tip.
