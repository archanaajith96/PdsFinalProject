The crepe is just the right amount of crispy and doughy for that delightfully light texture. Kimchi flavors of the crepe gave it that tiny bit of zing which helps keep the flavor fresh. Galbi short ribs were tender and meaty with the cheese, sour cream sauce and sauteed vegetables making for rich bites. French fries had nice crunch to them. Great combination of flavors.Service - 4/5. Friendly and quick.Value - 5/5. The crepes are delicious and a pretty unique fusion flavor. Portions are large and come with a choice of side for $12. Good value.Parking - Street (Free)"}, {"review_id": "jYJqwOaH-Yfae0rFS5GLDA", "user_id": "2wrhCKtUXRlZadkg8dXhEA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "There was one point I came here 4 times within a month. Taking a break but this place is really good. It's close to the grove path train. The place is relatively small so sometimes you may have to wait. Most of the time there's always a seat. Just don't plan to bring a huge group.  If you do you might take up the whole place . The food is korean with some other fusion. I've tried the bibimbap, tacos, nachos, crepes, etc. They're all delicious. The amount of food you get is pretty big. I always have to pack my leftovers. Definitely a good spot."}, {"review_id": "nj5KB0wrzc9uhRwOjpZB2Q", "user_id": "AA08rmnSkJobHaBQbAu8Qw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "I remember coming to Kraverie years and years ago.  I'm glad this place is still here and thriving!  I recently had the kimchi fried rice.  The fried rice was amazing.  The bacon was so soft and it went really well with the fried rice.  The fried rice was also not too spicy so that was good.  It was like a fusion toned down version of kimchi fried rice.  I got my rice with an egg and fish.  The egg and fish went really well with the rice too.  It totally hit the spot and it's definitely comfort food.  This dish would go great with a nice cold beer.  I also got some kimchi fries and they weren't as good as I remembered.  So give that a pass.My dining partner tried the seoul cheesesteak and said that was good as well, but nothing like the cheesesteaks you get in Philly.  If you're in the area and looking for some fusion korean food, try Kraverie!  It's not authentic korean so don't come here expecting that.  It is very fusion and Americanized korean food."}, {"review_id": "bIOyb4TU5qG5SbuzoXkF8g", "user_id": "cpcPXemvDaZaDuQh5j-bfg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Wings, wings, wings! This place does the best wings!!! They are so succulent and oozing with flavour! You can get 8 or 16 wings and  I usually get 8 because we almost always order kimchi friend too which are super yummy. The fries are drenched in cheese and kimchi goodness. I ordered these two appetisers yesterday for take out. The fries are generally better eaten in the restaurant as they stay fresher but that's not to say they aren't good when you get them home/delivered. I usually also order the kimchi fried rice which is so yummy too. I don't like to get extra protein as I think the bacon and fried egg is more than enough. I would love to try other things on the menu but I just cannot deviate from the moreish wings and kimchi fries!! The restaurant itself is pretty small and can get packed but turnover is pretty quick. Cannot wait to return!"}, {"review_id": "d5sjiAWxJxwpf36kebP2OQ", "user_id": "cVKH5IDFCk6Lo0mywCtrfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "This was my first time here and it won't be my last.

The first time I ordered from Kraverie, I got take out of the Kimchi Fried Rice which was pretty tasty. Better than normal white rice as it had more flavor, but I wouldn't consider this a full on dish considering it's all rice and one egg. There's no real substance to it because the whole meal is just plain rice with a little bit of kimchi. The second time I came here I ordered the bibimbap and it was delicious. Egg fried to perfection, the rice and all the vegetables on top were paired so well. I was very impressed. So impressed that I wanted to come back here a third time. Today I came for my third time and I ordered the Bibimbap again and I added an extra fried egg to add more protein. When I got my first order, the egg was fried, but SUPER runny. Now I know people like it like this, but please refer to my photo. There is still a ring of uncooked egg white around the yolk... usually sunny side up eggs are egg white fried through. I asked the waitress if the egg was always cooked like this and she said yes. However, I know for a fact that is not true because of the previous time I got the same dish and because I went with my sister and her egg was actually fried eggs. They did graciously offer to cook it more for me so I was very appreciative. Another downside is my sister bit into cracked eggshells in her dish. I'm just going to leave it there. Then when they recooked her meal, her original nicely fried egg became sunny side up. I'm slightly confused by the inconsistency here. Although I was really disappointed with the cooks and the appearance of my food, the waitresses are all very nice and accommodating. Our waitress felt bad and offered to give us blooming tea on the house. The blooming tea honestly didn't have that great of a flavor, but it was a really nice gesture on her part. All in all, the food is hit or miss (even for me, each time being different), but the service is always good."}, {"review_id": "Yb2XxMDjnpJXLxP1RcV2xw", "user_id": "MqLUJ-7vayZPHJLlItLHmw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/26/2017", "text": "My boyfriend and I came on a Friday night after work and the restaurant just had one family in it, so we got to sit by the window which was nice. The staff was super friendly and helpful with whatever we needed.As for the food, my boyfriend and I split the dumplings-- they were nice and crispy and they came out steaming hot. For an entree, I got the glass noodle dish with spicy pork and it was great! It could have been a little bit spicier, but it was so flavorful. My boyfriend got the kimchi fried rice with the beef, but he was a little disappointed because there was too much bacon in it that it over powered the dish; however, he enjoyed it.

For starters, we got the Kimchi Cheese Fries (seasoned fries topped with caramelized kimchi, and melted Cheddar and Monterey Jack Cheese) ($7), which was very good. It had a mix of cheese and caramelized kimchi on top, which went well with a Sriracha and ketchup mix. For the entree, I got the Kimchi Rice (caramelized kimchi, sticky rice, scallions, topped with a fried egg on top) ($10), which was a hearty portion that two people could have easily shared. It was absolutely delicious and filling. My friend decided to go for the sweet crepes, ordering the Tiramisu Crepe (Nutella, Tiramisu, strawberries) ($8.50 w/ ice cream), which was also great and actually tasted like Tiramisu. I'd recommend this for dessert if you still have room!- Service: Honestly the service wasn't ok. The waiter brought everything in a prompt manner and nothing went wrong, however the waiter just wasn't welcoming at all. No greetings when we sat down, menus and silverware was just placed on the table again without any greetings and we did have to wait a bit before being asked about drinks to start off. While I'm glad the food is really good here and would come back because of that and the atmosphere, I really wish the wait staff was more friendly. - Atmosphere: Kraverie is a pretty small place and it was consistently packed on the Sunday afternoon we visited. However, people always found a table and didn't have to wait long. The atmosphere was a fun and lively one, with many robust and loud conversations and laughter going on around us, which added to the quality of this place. It was a bit hard to have a conversation without your companion speaking up a bit, so not the best place for deep conversations but certainly a fun place for a group or just a casual meal to lighten up your day. Loved the food and atmosphere here and will certainly be going back. Only thing I wished was different was friendlier and more attentive wait staff."}, {"review_id": "38tBVZmU9r45Aio8oJ7kNw", "user_id": "P59zTx192QvpO_lLiqDclA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "They have the menu right outside the door which is nice.
