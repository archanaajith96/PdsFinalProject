I have seen the same people working there for years which is rare in the industry.2) The games are cheap and kept in good working order.3) The food is surprisingly good.4) The crowd is pretty mixed.This place might not be for you if you want to eat super fancy and tiny food on oddly shaped plates or want to be seen around beautiful people. The crowd tends to be a bit nerdy (which is why I like it)."}, {"review_id": "YTo9pGOSCWrGZ6g4lNXZjQ", "user_id": "pLDtK_a7kk4vLW10JhDGBQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/12/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Yelp has never failed me like it's failed me at this place. One of the people's food was forgotten, it's not a bar, they don't have many games at all, everything is overpriced, very crowded. The food was ok.... at best. Very disappointed.

They have allot of semi affordable options with food and beverages. The waitress was very attentive and helpful with the menu when ordering and kept drinks filled. Another server was awesome and I just got the feeling that they are all around friendly people. Enjoyed the atmosphere as well. I'm somebody that doesn't usually go to bar and grills because of my own preference and I don't like the crowd being only middle aged or old wild people..This place had a good mix of everyone. Bathrooms was cool looking and clean. I didn't play but they have a SPLENDID selection of arcade games which was awesome to me. Food was big portioned and very good!! Maybe a new fave place for me to drink too! Recommend if in the area for sure!"}, {"review_id": "8vz2EJfMnoP2f1PSqkNP2Q", "user_id": "mIBj3k1KYlyjCYZVUfPWOQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "The coin jam is a great place with a cool atmosphere. Retro arcade games and beer is a combination I don't think many people would complain about. I had a lot of fun when I visited, but the only negative I have is that the games were pretty pricey and didn't stay as long as I would've like because of that."}, {"review_id": "Xi_U5A18nnF9O2qwSfm_Aw", "user_id": "GSYebjxwcaDhLvlkQ16WBA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Extremely disappointed. Ordered burger, usually a safe order. I was told they come cooked medium, which is great. I prefer medium even rare. This burger came out too thick to take a bite of. I cut it in half to find an absolutely raw patty. You could smell the raw meat. Waitress seemed offended that I didn't love their food. At the end of meal I didn't eat but no worries, she took 2 dollars off out bill!!!!!! There is way too much competition around to even consider coming back."}, {"review_id": "T65oXrt9zcHXV_Eb0iaaTw", "user_id": "gqu9UMPOin2BOJOLBHBVow", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "One of my favorite places. Starting with the food. Ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, and it's probably the best I've ever had. For the main course I tried the Mac n Cheese, and it was pretty amazing as well. It comes in a small bowl, but don't be fooled it's a lot of food. The fries were delicious as well. Nice selection of beer, but not a lot on tap. Got an IPA and it came in a can, and my only issue was the beer wasn't very cold. I did get a cold glass though. And the arcade portion was a lot of fun with a lot of new and classic options for game time. Was a little crowded, but overall a good place to eat, drink, and play. Oh, and even though no one brought the check, the staff was great for service."}, {"review_id": "P6H1biS1AI7IPCFeTEKsNw", "user_id": "JdM1bc3x_7fiumJvyXfrMA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Fun place to get drinks and food. Food and drinks are much better than you would expect from a bar with games. The garlic fries are amazing. They have some nights where some games are free.

We went there once while driving past Salem. We also had their taco special which was pricey but yummy. So when my husband and I past through Salem again for the total eclipse. We stayed at Salem the whole day just to have fun. Then they told us that they don't have the free pinball that day.

I now live in Orange County and every time I visit I love coming here. There's nothing like this AND they upgraded my favorite game...buck hunter! You can now play with other players in the USA! It's so much fun and so nostalgic. You can also order food and drinks so what's not to love. They have so many arcade games I love it! I love their walk in freezer how it's Star Wars. Salem is coming up that's for sure and it's making me want to fly down and visit more often.

The food was not great, but okay. I had the smothered fries and only thing I can say is that it needed a bit more sauce because it was dry.  A quick fix was a couple sides of ranch, however, the avocado sauce was  really good and wanted more.The staff was awesome and super friendly.  I will be going back for sure."}, {"review_id": "vL9-9NapOKmCUbEKDXZR8w", "user_id": "aqXbApBao2UHjQh6RBwzew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/19/2017", "text": "The perfect spot to get drinks, eat food and play video games.
