I've had ramen at countless places now and none of them measure up to Magokoro. We recently visited since it had been a while and they updated their menu to include a green chile chicken cheese ramen. Oh em gee. My spousal unit called that blasphemy  but it was amazing. It was like a green chili chicken enchilada and the most amazing ramen had a love child. The BROTH was green chile broth and it was the amazing, peppery goodness you would expect. They have recently upgraded a bit of the decor which was pretty non-descript before. If you haven't been yet, there is something wrong with you. Just do it."}, {"review_id": "LQZqQsP9kfvNSQV4kjIfIA", "user_id": "d4KJ0P0g9VWIfFXEDesjdA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Tiny, small, little restaurant.... BIG, HUGE, GINORMOUS FLAVOR. The curry. The curry. Wait, I need a moment. THE CURRY! Mouth explosion much? Well if you needed that home cooked, just out of your mama's kitchen experience you need to come here. The care, love, and notes of happiness await you. You go in, a little apprehensive because the place is jam packed and you're not sure if they can fit you in. You're in luck because there is a spot at the bar. I happened to be there with my 18 month old and was EXTRA nervous about lugging all his extra stuff around. We settled in at the bar and luckily I brought his little chair that strapped on to the high bar chair. Okay we are in. Now what? A sweet server helped us with the menu, she recommended the Chicken KARA-AGE. It's marinated chicken which is perfectly crispy and juicy with a side of rice, a little salad and the star, CURRY. I've never experienced Japanese Curry. It's much different from any other curry I've tried. It has a thick gravy consistency, the depth of different flavors bounce around your mouth and a little spice tickles the tip of your tongue. You just start dipping every bite into that tenacious, rich sauce and never want to think about life before you knew it existed. Back to reality. Baby next to me, chowing down on some of my chicken. Mama and baby both happy. Before you know it we've devoured our meal. We pay, I buy a shirt because I want the world to know how much I love Magokoro, and we leave better humans. We can't wait to go back and visit for dinner to try the ramen. I did go back and have the curry with the tempura veggies and tofu and I think I liked it even more that the chicken if that is possible. Heck just the rice and curry is a meal worth fantasizing about."}, {"review_id": "YlpNJROHtME8XSvY_LO9Nw", "user_id": "wJ-lAqXvk-bp1joQ5aqGSA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Magokoro. Or for those of us who remember it, Kokoro for the old timers! Hands down my favorite spot to have traditional Japanese fare. I think its as good as it gets for Albuquerque!First of all, all the food is homemade fresh daily with time and care by the cutest little asian lady you'll ever see. Also, you will find they have two menus, the lunch menu filled with Japanese Curry and Donburi bowls along with specials on Tue, Thu, Fri & Sat. Their curry is the best I've had in town. It is so savory and thick and always the perfect temperature, HOT. Which I love because it stays hot until I'm done with my meal. You can have it with alone or with chicken, pork or my favorite, breaded and fried tofu. Their portions are well worth the price and you will never leave unsatisfied.  They offer ramen for dinner which I have yet had the chance to have but have it on my list! It's a small spot with lots of fans so you'll find the dining room fills up quick. Make sure to come early or make sure you have a little bit of time to spare waiting for a tablet open up.The dining room is always clean and the service is never bad. They have been doing some work with a local artist as of late and you can find Magokoro memorabilia for sale. They have the cuteset shirts and baseball caps for those who want to rep! I will have to report on the Ramen after I collect some recon."}, {"review_id": "XJ4qku0lz2u0e_p797Eykg", "user_id": "ftxnU2PaDUMo8-Bq6nE6yw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "While ABQ doesn't have lot of selection of traditional, non-sushi Japanese food, it thankfully does still have pretty good offerings. (as an aside: Hibatchi and \"Japanese Steakhouses\" are almost always *not* authentic or traditional).Magokoro serves ramen at night and curry for lunch. I had apparently been there for both, but I do not remember the ramen, so I will only talk about curry.I first fell in love with Japanese curry on my trip to Japan last year. It's very different from other South- or South-East- Asian curries. The sauce is thick (usually made with a roux) and very flavorful. Magokoro's was no different. Lots of flavor in their curry sauce with a rich backbone.They offer lots of options for lunch but when I started asking the waiter between curry and something else, at least three patrons in the small space spoke up to say \"curry!\".I went with seafood and was pleasantly surprised by the amount of meat in there. That included a nice chunk of octopus (tako in Japanese). My wife went with the tempura veggies and tofu which she enjoyed a lot!They also give you a nice serving of rice and salad with a delicious dressing (it could have used more dressing though).If you're looking for curry, or if you've never had Japanese curry, check this place out"}, {"review_id": "kmhtNEbxZ5kcEYuJH6H_bg", "user_id": "9v183_UbvxeWvJsl-ovZBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "I really love this little Japanese cuisine spot. It is smaller inside, so have to get there early during lunch. I am pretty sure there is only the one little lady in the kitchen who cooks everything and one waiter/cashier. The food is outstanding. I got the gyoza (pot stickers) and chicken cutlet. I love when pot stickers are steamed and then fried just on the one side. You can tell they were made in house. The chicken was far from dry! Juicy and delicious. The curry is good too and served in a dish that maintains the heat/warmth of the curry, so it does not get cold on you or thicken weird as it starts cooling. Of course the rice was sticky enough that you could easily eat with chopsticks and not struggle."}, {"review_id": "r7wavsUfRf2TH20hh5Gn7g", "user_id": "D75QkD2rhT8en3As_g0ABA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "My dad and I tried to eat at this fine establishment a few times.

The rice perfect and the pickled sides I got (sorry I should have got the names of them) were pickled things I dream about.

It also had a much fishier taste to it than we were used to.  I would come back to try out their lunch options but we weren't very impressed with their ramen.

When I crave Japanese curry, I go here. This is probably the best tasting Japanese curry in Albuquerque. It's a hole in a wall, family owned restaurant - menu is simple, food is very tasty and the server is always very quick. The place is tiny though, so if you have a large group, good luck on finding seating. They probably have 4 or 5 tables only (if that) and some seats available if you don't mind sitting on bar stools. The portions are big and the prices are reasonable. The main thing I always order is the CURRY, it's the best! Trust me. Kara-age chicken, grilled chicken, and katsu, with curry - they are all good. I haven't tried anything else on the menu so I can't really comment on other items on the menu.

It was a small place with nice, wooden tables. My work buddy claimed it was one of his favorite places to eat. It was only my 2nd time trying sushi, but I decided to take his lead and order sushi also. Salmon seemed like a safe bet. It came on a small, rectangular plate but an ample amount for lunch. Remember how I said it was only my 2nd time trying sushi? Well, while my friend chatted on, I shoved a big spoonful of a green glob in my mouth thinking it was guacamole. You guessed it- it was wasabi. Immediately, my eyes teared up and I couldn't breathe. That was an experience. I tried taking my parents there later that summer. They were willing to try sushi too! For some reason, Albuquerque was more crowded that Friday night than usual. The line to Kokoro's led out the door and waiting times of up to 30 minutes, so we turned around. We tried an Irish pub down the street only to be told the same thing. We opted for Applebee's instead and went home (later than usual after all this adventure, but full and happy)"}, {"review_id": "Mtw3piLVjsA9GkzqezgRiw", "user_id": "og6DDC6bx3v4Us9sCvDuQw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/19/2017", "text": "I came across this place in a desperate search for an alternative to eating at O-Ramen.

On this day, it was winter-like and nearly every place that we wanted to eat at that served ramen was packed to the gills. Trusty yelp led my shivering soul here. Let me just say that this place is extremely small and we were lucky to have got a seat. There is seriously like 6 tables and a bunch of bar-style window seating packed into a tiny single room. The service was kind of slow, but understandably so. They only have one waiter working here and the poor guy was working at a fever-pitch to please everyone. Now to the food. I thought that the food here was extremely good. The portions were huge and the flavor was amazing. All of our party of 4 cleaned every bowl dry. I would definitely come here again.

And.... in ABQ of all places?! This small family owned and operated joint is God's gift to the Burqueños. From the moment you walk in you can feel the hospitality and so much care they put on every single customers walk in. Every time I visited there's always same guy working the counter, taking orders, running food, basically doing everything in the front of the house. Even though the place is packed every time I visit, he doesn't seem to be in hurry or rushing anyone out. He touches each table and each guests to see if all the food taste alright and if they are having a great time. They offer two different menus for lunch and dinner. Lunch menu offers more varieties of dishes- donburi, curry, rice plates and some apps. Dinner menu is mainly their specialty Ramen. I've tried almost everything on their menu and wasn't disappointed a single time. They are very very busy during lunch time so understand there will be little bit of wait due to the limited seating.Oh! And the beautiful photographs on the wall is taken by the guy working the front. I just found out he is one of highly talented local artist!!
