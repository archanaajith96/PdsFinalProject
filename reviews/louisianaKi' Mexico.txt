The guacamole was very good, and the accompanied salsas were all so good I couldn't decided between the four which one I liked best. The elotes were amazing, and served on a full cob. I have had authentic elotes from the west side of Chicago, and Ki' Mexico takes it to a whole new level.Tacos:Gringa - Amazing. If you like cheese, highly recommended. Great flavors all around.Biste - really good steak, if you like steak tacos this one is for youCochinita - the best pork I have ever had, melts in your mouth. Perfectly shredded with the spicy salsa - just amazing!Poblano - perfectly cooked chicken, more of a creamy cheese sauce. I could eat this taco every day!"}, {"review_id": "WgADKB8pptrTqBDaL1SHpw", "user_id": "K5sEuK5055nwvsGENc3cow", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "Great atmosphere with great food! The tacos have vibrant flavors, and I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. I've tried one of the pork tacos and the shrimp tacos. Both good! My only wish is that they made their own tortillas. Homemade tortillas are my love language. But they do have refreshing margaritas!We also brought our dog with us and sat outside, and I loved the fact that one of the workers brought her a water bowl! A great added touch."}, {"review_id": "nW4Nuf3nkXfXAEtIHXi0bg", "user_id": "jHEV3qmUNsiaJ3Aq4mskGw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Visiting from Houston and this little restaurant just hit it out the park. Delicious tacos on wonderful slightly toasted but soft corn tortillas, great vegan options (I had the Silvestre and the Nopal), life-changing guacamole (don't skip that), flavorful salsas, yummy rice and black beans, super super friendly and helpful staff, wonderfully clean bathrooms, all with style. Only wished I had tried a cocktail because I am sure it is delicious too!"}, {"review_id": "smwIJsb90S0PFAnjZsML1w", "user_id": "10U4NHzFH1XyIbDlnbPaFw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "One of the best places to eat in Shreveport!

The tacos combos were very creative and for the most part well executed! The only one that I didn't love was the shrimp taco, flavor just was off. All the rest were great!It's an order at the front place where you take a number. Also, alcohol had to be purchased separately at the bar which has an excellent beer selection. It has ample inside and outside seating.Service was awesome!"}, {"review_id": "r4IqvM2pqYvcF5coR4BgUA", "user_id": "37IjySWnUsSLchKU75P-pw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "Let me just say the food here is scrumptious but there are a few tips you need to know. If you don't want your food to beat you to a table and you are planning to have a bar drink. You need to go to the bar first and enjoy you drink because the food will beat you to the table.  I went last night and my food was waiting for me while I was still ordering a drink at the bar....this is frustrating. They need to change this somehow. It would be nice to order bar drinks at the main ordering place and they get delivered to the table as well. Next time, I will order drinks then just an appetizer. When all that is done then order your main dish as you have to get up and order each time. Once again the food is great and a cute vibe!!"}, {"review_id": "z6c6aBLOeX6vKzXDN7aUXw", "user_id": "5lcuORSIxLQOUM2PI7t0Jw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Amazing authentic Mexican food.

I tried the cochinita (pork), poblano (chicken), and biste (steak) tacos and the rice-cooked-in-corn-side dish. The rice serving was small for $3.42.   The tacos were in the $3.42 - $3.65 range.  Overall, a quite nice carryout dinner.  The restaurant itself was quite vibrant and busy I thought for a Thursday evening.  They had live music too - a guitarist and cellist tonight.  The noise level in the place is also a bit elevated. They've apparently been in business for only 2 years and it looks to be a popular business for their higher end tacos.  Overall, it was a good stop for me."}, {"review_id": "3NBmHccaS6suxYQ7l-d6UA", "user_id": "Bq3j9M1s9F2LNJEmdZSOXQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "The sides are way overpriced but the tacos are great and worth it.

The atmosphere is fun and energetic. The restaurant is a bit loud, especially when there is a live band, but it's still a great spot to go.

Food was good, service was good, drinks were good too. Chill and casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating.  Location is in an older shopping center that is kind of hidden from everything.So here, u order food at counter and they assign u a number and will bring food to your table. For drinks, u have to order separately at the bar. Happy hour is only on tuesdays! I forget the exact time but I think around 4-6pm. If you haven't been here yet, i do recommend trying this place, it's pretty good :)!!"}, {"review_id": "hrX6_q2eTVhKhra7WPwN_Q", "user_id": "NIJBxGqf3IFQKbZV9NbmUQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "Came to Shreveport for a work event and found this place through Yelp.

We also ordered the guacamole show. That came with guacamole, chips and 4 salsas on the side. The flavors of every portion were great! Guac was a little overpriced but we enjoyed every bit.
