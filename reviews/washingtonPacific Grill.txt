My family and I decided to try this place out for the first time for her birthday. We were not aware that there were two separate menus after 9:00PM which is when only the Happy Hour menu is served. However our server made an exception for us and allowed us to order off the dinner menu.We ordered the Oysters on the 1/2 Shell, Filet Mignon, NY Cab, Wild Halibut, and the Hokkaido Scallops. Each dish was absolutely amazing. There were 4 different kinds of oysters and none of them had any sandy flavor. The steaks were cooked perfectly and had a rich flavor. The scallops were my favorite.I would definitely go back again."}, {"review_id": "xXqWJgaw02nZ6i7tT4QTHg", "user_id": "iePIVIN8BMmVM8-yjcSSWQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "If you are older than 25, don't bother. 1 star for beautiful ambiance.- 1 star for it taking 15 minutes to see my waiter make eye contact with me for the first time.1 star for a large menu boasting gf and vegetarian options available. - 1 star for it taking an hour to get our food when the place is empty. 1 star for prompt and polite hostesses who saw we had no drinks. - 1 star for no refills on water even after we asked for them and accidentally dropped something in my one of ours.

I called at 11am on a Sunday and the very nice host on the phone was able to set us up with an 11:30 reservation for 2. When we arrived they were preparing our table so we waited about 3-5 min which was not a problem at all. Once seated the server promptly came over to introduce himself and take our drink order. He was friendly, knowledgeable, and he didn't hover over us constantly. The service was one of the best we've ever had and I can't wait to go back. Food:I ordered the Dirty Fries and my other half ordered the PG Benedict with smoked salmon. Both had amazing flavor, and I love that their hollandaise on the Benedict was house made fresh.

Towards the end he came around more regularly but still took forever to order, get our meal, get boxes for leftover and our check.The food itself was good. I got the BLT+A and it was good. We all loved the garlic fries and the fried garlic bits. Another friend got biscuits and gravy which was good, but geez... the frittata was pathetic. It was seriously like 1cm thin and came with a mini salad and thank goodness my friend wasn't that hungry or else he would of gotten hangry and it was $16. Absolutely rediculous. Seriously, if you're going to serve a frittata that small and thin, get rid of it. Would I come back? Nope but then again, i'm rarely in Tacoma and this place was close to our hotel"}, {"review_id": "Z8j-BGBhLnU-ceZN47XqXw", "user_id": "_lromAt-ZtXX_OPaQINLTQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "Great venue.  Attentive and quick service.

The food was tasty, and there is plenty of variety on the menu. This is an affordable option to go to when dining out in Tacoma.

The menu is a great Pacific Northwest twist on brunch fare. My favorite meal is the Hot Mess- pastrami, hashed browns,braised cabbage, sawmill gravy, and eggs; a fabulous spin on a breakfast scramble. We adored Tempura Bacon so much, we ordered more. We adults couldn't resist their brunch cocktails, a perfect complement to our food.Now I just need to get there to try other meals they they offer."}, {"review_id": "u_r1ngJZ5rPGH9kbo81kig", "user_id": "wZ1zh1ow-xMiS5CFl2-wiw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "An excellent breakfast brunch place in Tacoma.

It's in a prime Tacoma location, the decor is decent, the waitstaff is lovely, and the drinks are pretty solid.The food... Was profoundly flavorless. The texture was all there, but it was like eating nothing. I wasn't even mad, I was that impressed as to how bland it was. The fries came with literal branches of deep fried Rosemary? It kind of looked like the beach at high tide. I don't know. Anyway, go for the drinks, but skip the food. You'll end up paying $90 for crunchy nothing.

We had the private room reserved for a meeting during lunch time. First of all it's too narrow for people to walk back and forth without disturbing those who are already sitting down. Then the second waiter who brought the food was confused about the order of people sitting and kept on interrupting the meeting! I ordered the Asian chicken salad from the limited menu and holly hell, someone went a bit loosey goosey with the ginger. It was so spicy that I had tears running down my face and I can take some heat normally!I think one good thing they have going for them is the HH menu."}, {"review_id": "qCBGCK0Vjw5SMDOog8ZaQw", "user_id": "Nq38iHhlwLVgsVYNuduNJQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Came here for our 26th wedding anniversary. Just picked it because it was in the area. Best choice we've made in a long time. Food and service were perfect. We had the steak salad, halibut, and Hanoi eggplant and the round it off, the rock and roca blondie Sunday. Best dessert EVER!!!! Our waiter was Greg and he was great! It is on the pricey side, with main course ranging from $20-ish to over $40 for the Filet. Still a great place to celebrate something special. They do charge a 20% service charge that's basically the tip, with 15% to the waiter and  5% goes to the busboy etc. You can tip additional and that goes directly to the waiter/waitress. All in all, a phenomenal place you should go to at least once. p/s they gave us a card saying happy anniversary and a free dessert for a future visit.

It's a neat town and we enjoyed walking around after the flight.The Yelp! app brought us here (how did we do this before the app?) and we landed right around Happy Hour time. There were people at a few tables and everything in front of them looked yummy. Because our bellies were still on Central Time, we knew we had to eat before even thinking about dinner. We definitely landed at the right spot!Cassandra tended bar that day and totally helped us select our meal, particularly when it came to portions. The chilly day drove me to order the onion soup (du jour) that was really interesting and flavorful. I presumed 'French Onion,' and instead received something as rich and textured in a creamy style; very yummy! We also ordered happy hour tacos and sliders, which rounded out the meal very well.A local at the bar (so embarrassed that I didn't note his name!) bought us drinks when we realized that were all 1-sports fans and 2-lived in Michigan once upon a time. Frankly, a great bar is measured by its regulars and this fellow was the tops!Street parking is very reasonable and the food is terrific. Cassandra is a terrific barkeep and took great care of us.

We used to love PG, even on the busiest evenings, we could count on good food and great served.  On our last visit we immediately noticed the service had dramatically changed. Our food took forever and our server didn't even try to pretend she cared.  We asked another server if there was a manger on duty because we really were shocked at the behavior. A manager never came. We spent our mean trying to figure what was wrong with our beloved PG. Well, our questions were answered when we got our bill. You see, they've switched to a mandatory 20% tip system ( and for some crazy reason you can't tip on a gift card). This was not advertised anywhere and the service team clearly didn't get the memo that they should still try to offer good service. I usually like the tip included system, but the PG service team could use a lesson or two on why and how it works."}, {"review_id": "9SpahLSt5oGpz_ewgnfRZw", "user_id": "enLudLqA64AftfG7A0dmww", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "I thought I was going to a fine dining establishment - I was wrong.

Kind of a shot in the dark but we were all pleased with the room, service and the food. It's a busy place, called three days ahead and our choices were 4:45 and after 7:00, we went early because our guest was in from the east coast. And, surprise, at 4:45 the place was busy, not crazy busy but things were hoping. Traffic from Seattle was a bitch and although valet parking was 10.00 it saved us from leaving our guest wondering where we were while we searched for one of the few on-street spots. So, service was good, bar did well on drinks and the by the glass wine list was long and had some nice bargains. Good deal because after tanking up on delicious cocktails none of us was up for a full bottle.And the food- I had the winter pasta, tasty but not sure where the field forged mushrooms were hiding. The others had the short ribs and they cleaned their plates. So, while not particularly dramatic the menu is ample for a range of tastes and what we ate was well prepared and tasty.  Good bet for out of  area guest and a nice combination with a trip the TAMs and several always other museums just down the street. Added bonus is a sort of off to  side room that was quiet enough to actual talk."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pacific-grill-tacoma?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
