Also, we've even considered making the entire four-hour drive from home just to eat here.From the superb hospitality to the chicken shawarma balanced perfectly between chew, tender, and crisp; the fresh salads, smooth hummus; and now the innovative Lebanese iced tea that throws rose water and pine nuts into the mix for an exotic treat; and all at an affordable price at lunchtime and still reasonable at dinner, Albasha has absolutely everything. Even in Houston we haven't found a Lebanese place this good and we judge every dish we've eaten here by the standard of how it's made here."}, {"review_id": "nQaZQrQTscAA-MmEYCDH8A", "user_id": "JHqSDxJ1B0RBO4lGrJYeqg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/16/2017", "text": "Great food and service, every time I come here.  The combination platter is my standard choice and it never disappoints.

I called for a refund on a side that I paid for and the employee on the phone sounded agitated about my request for a refund. It was a simple request because I'm not paying for something that I didn't receive. This isn't the first time they have left something out of an order we placed for pickup. It happens pretty much every time we get food there. They also slathered my salad in dressing resulting in soggy lettuce with a small amount of feta. When I said something about the salad I was told to request dressing on the side next time."}, {"review_id": "XHkpYGDcu19_0Iol59GR5Q", "user_id": "iWNII6QXYbJBLDnTGRLfuQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/21/2017", "text": "My absolute favorite Greek & Lebanese restaurant!  Born and raised in BR, but moved out of state a few years ago and since then I've been searching for a restaurant like this where I live.  Haven't found it.  When I come back to BR this is where I go...multiple times.  The chicken schwarma salad and the chicken schwarma plate are my favorites, but everything there is so so good!  The staff is so friendly making this one of my all-time favorite restaurants.  Albasha management - please expand up to NC!  We need you up there!!"}, {"review_id": "SDQeeRkePWqL6JUjZ5CiuQ", "user_id": "6NBJprU8lxCbiR8Y0wp-Vw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2017", "text": "In my travels, I've visited a lot of different Greek and Lebanese Restaurants, but I always find myself craving Albasha.  The food and service are great, and if you are in the area, stop in to try the Chicken Shawarma.    I also recommend the falafel.  The restaurant is clean, the service is efficient, and the prices are reasonable.  I enjoy visiting the restaurants with three or four friends, as it is the perfect place to enjoy a nice conversation.  I've never found the restaurant to be loud, even when it is crowded."}, {"review_id": "g7cX2weVP_yKCndjvJa46w", "user_id": "VFKNROgdHMa7_KXJJpkbSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2017", "text": "Passing through Louisiana  we were directed to this restaurant to satisfy both vegetarian and carnivorous appetites.

My lamb was very dry and already all cut up when it was brought to me on the plate. And when I asked if they could take it back, it was brought back even drier than the first time. This time, however, the lamb shank was cooked just right. Very moist and fall off the bone tender. With rice, hummus and pita bread, and a salad. The luncheon was a large portion so I couldn't even finish it all. Cost me ~$15 but it was good and satisfyingThe atmosphere is nice.. It's small and cozy inside. Definitely a hot spot for lunch!!

I've already written a review for their location on Bluebonnet Road, but this location is a bit larger and a bit nicer. The value for the portion size and quality of the food is pretty outstanding. I typically order the vegetarian platter (enormous) or a side of hummus, falafel and a salad. This is always way too much for me to eat, so this time I just ordered a falafel sandwich and they let me substitute a fatoush salad for the salad or fries that normally comes with. This is the perfect amount for lunch, and allows for enough room to have a cup of their delicious lentil soup, too. As I've mentioned in my review for the other location, their hummus and falafel are both on point. I was thinking about a place in New Orleans I went to recently for a hummus/falafel sandwich and the quality was so poor and the price so high.The only reason I docked a star was because the side of olives that I ordered were obviously picked out of a vat of feta cheese or something (perhaps picked out of a salad?) and this made them inedible because I don't eat cheese and find feta to be extremely unappetizing. I could have sent them back I suppose, but the fact that they came out to the table like that didn't leave me wanting for more. Also, the bathroom here was too filthy for me to use. It's such a lifesaver to know this place exists in Baton Rouge, which otherwise isn't the most vegan/vegetarian-friendly city."}, {"review_id": "O_fL8v7yPlN4b96o2cXABQ", "user_id": "ADohMwMk4a6oe_AYvSIY9g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/20/2017", "text": "Albasha is a very good Greek and Lebanese Restaurant. I want to say up front that the reason I'm only giving it 4 out of 5 stars is because this was my first time there - I'm a fan!I ordered  the Chicken Shawarma Plate and that was plenty of food for one person. Actually, it was more than enough. I never expected to have so much chicken included in the go-box that it was a nice surprise. The chicken was moist and well seasoned. The hummus was more than enough too, and I loved that they included the seasoned yogurt to dip my chicken into. When I picked up my order, I noticed that there were plenty of families enjoying their dinner there, so it must be good for families. I had a great meal, and the employee who helped me was extremely friendly.
