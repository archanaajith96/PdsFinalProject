Those are bold statements, but there's no denying Fiorella's Jack Stack Barbecue role in the KC BBQ scene since 1957 ... or in Overland Park since 1997. That's a fact, Jack!Because I wanted to fully baptize myself in the Jack Stack experience, I expanded on the diet-bustin' KC Combo with 4 meats instead of the normal 3.  * BBQ Baby Back Ribs (3 stars)Sweet and spicy, but not falling off-the-bone * BBQ Burnt Ends (4 stars)Crusty, fatty, and yummy smoked Beef Brisket Tips * BBQ Beef Brisket (5 stars)Tender, juicy, and beefy bliss * BBQ Beef Ribs (5 stars)My favorite! Like Rose in Titanic, I was screaming, \"JACK!!!\"The starters and sides were pretty darn tasty, too.  * Smoked Jalapeno Corn Bread (3 spicy stars) * Cheesy Corn Bake (4 cheesy stars) * Fried Onion Rings (4 stacked stars) * Fried Mushrooms (5 huge stars)Jack Stack Barbecue in Overland Park, KS was a blend of spiritual hype and holy BBQ. The slow-smoked, spice-rubbed, wood-fired barbecue meats lathered in tomato-based BBQ sauces should be sacred for any devout barbecue lover."}, {"review_id": "9fkVp5oMHFrPzm-GD4bjlA", "user_id": "Iz38YSWYPZXFTD4W4N_ipQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "If you want to talk quality, I have to say this is the top place to go in KC.  The food here is by far the best.  The atmosphere is great too.  It feels like such a nice and comfortable place.  And the food is to die for.The beans here have a flavor I have not had anywhere else in the world.  Amazing.  But all the food is great.  Whether it be ribs or brisket, you can't go wrong.I've only been here twice, but both times were amazing.  The first time we were a bit annoyed as we made reservations and still waited over an hour past our time, but it was *somewhat* understandable as they were incredibly busy and we had a fairly large party.  The second time I went there for lunch, and it was much better (less of a wait and much less folks in the place)."}, {"review_id": "QCxh4qrdP6sBPHR93loq_g", "user_id": "Qco4F0hPEiBI5gYSzKTV5A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Came here today for my dad's birthday and it was such a splendid time! We went on Monday night and there was no wait to be seated for dinner. For starters, we had a house salad and lemonade for my little sister. The lemonade was tart on its own, but you have the option to include flavor shots into it! (And free refills)We ordered 3 full lamb ribs, and 1 KC sampler with two beef burnt ends and one lamb ribs order. The lamb ribs were smoked so well. It cut like butter, and had the BBQ taste infused into each bite. We accidentally only got one order of burnt ends, but it tasted amazing. The pieces were crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside. For sides, we got baked potato and two orders of cheesy potatoes. Cheesy potatoes are the best!!Since it was my dad's birthday, they brought him out a chocolate cake a la mode. It was very sweet of them. Overall, I really like Jack Stack, both for lunch and dinners. It is such an intimate place, and we always receive great service!"}, {"review_id": "RXNnAxC7dY93OKFWwX1JKw", "user_id": "6Dca_QIXdvHH3lIHHPcyxw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "My first intro to KC BBQ was Jack Stack, and it was a pretty solid first taste.Jack Stack is definitely way more upscale than your typical BBQ joint, but I didn't realize that until I rolled up, straight from a workout class. Oops. No one really cared, but I will say there are a lot of people here eating here on business trips (after all, Sprint HQ isn't too far).A pretty unique dish at Jack Stack is lamb ribs, which were nice and tender. I also got burnt ends to supplement, and I was pretty happy with how they came out. For sides, their cheesy corn deserves a shoutout - I love any sort of creamy corn side, and theirs hit the spot.While a bit pricier than most BBQ places, Jack Stack is a very comfortable place to dine that will cater to almost everybody. Solid spot!"}, {"review_id": "zbHOdc_pbPYlRqbWBAf2Eg", "user_id": "mj0y5iq-yxcyMdPyRR_MtQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Out of town for Biz trip.

Yes, a favorite of mine. The prime rib is rare, just as I like it. The salads with the house made blue cheese dressing amazing. We are able to split a 12 oz prime rib and it's quite nicely filling. The wait staff is so obliging they serve us two salads because we are unable to eat the other sides since  we are on low carb diets. I just keep coming back, although my usual location to frequent is the Martin City Jack Stack.

He asked if we had been to Jack's Stack before and I embarrassingly admitted that we were in KC for a 2 day business trip & had stopped at Jack's in Martin City for lunch and had enjoyed it so much that we wanted to enjoy one more meal at Jack's before we left town.  To be honest, I really came back because I wanted to try the crème brûlée.I ordered beef burnt ends with a side of fries and the creamy corn. My coworker is vegetarian so she ordered a veggie kabob, A side salad and the cheesy potatoes.  I barely ate half of my meal but not because it was not delicious.  There was just so much food and it was all fantastic!!!!  The crème brûlée did not disappoint either!!  It was creamy and just the right temperature with a fine layer of hardened sugar on top.  I was in heaven!!I'm not sure where Jack's finds it's waitresses and waiters but they definitely hire the best!  We engaged Ernesto in conversation and he shared that he had worked at the restaurant for two years and he loved it there. You could tell that he was very proud to be part of the \"family\"!  I leave Kansas City today but The good news is that Jack's Stack ships their barbecue anywhere in the US!!! I took one of the catalogs so that when I get future cravings, I can definitely have some Kansas City barbecue sent to me in Texas!"}, {"review_id": "EJGV2lZc2NSzNTI5BXG7vg", "user_id": "kc8K4ZFX1jiv7llxXQmuFw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Really disappointed with the pulled pork.
