Get reservations because without them, the wait was 1 to 1.5hrs, so we decided to have take out from them instead. Take out was supposed to take about 15 to 20 minutes we got our food after 30. The problem is the food came out in a paper bags but needed to be reopened at the door and checked again. We thought it was odd and inefficient to have people in the kitchen package everything and then have to reopen the bags again. Suggestion, maybe you guys should label your containers and don't send it out of the kitchen until people's entire order is done.The place was extremely busy with people overfilled in the patio and crowded around the bar. Appeared to be a trendy place for the college crowd. Average age was probably 25. Extremely loud, you couldn't even hear the person beside you. The game was on near the bar. Despite all that, the food was delicious. We split the medium size of the half and half fried tofu (spicy wasn't as spicy as I expected), smoked beef brisket (so good), fish taco (good) and the sweet potato nest (surprised they were able to get sweet potatoes so crispy and loved the hint of cinnamon), Bao buns (3 in the order), and brown rice as sides. This was enough to share between 3 people with left overs. Food was (5/5), Ambiance (1/5), service (3.5/5) and therefore over all was about 3.5/5."}, {"review_id": "VP2K-Hf28xJsqc6bkuQuAQ", "user_id": "8Bbwc5fAgGE1ekL1JVzcPQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Food is delicious, a little over priced.Drinks, bar, and outdoor activities are great."}, {"review_id": "43c0EzpEMMbvnYlukDbZjw", "user_id": "XnlQAgKJUAQZMCxGIX9P5Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Yes, yes, yes, and yes!

The Spicy Wings were delicious, similar to Korean Fried Chicken wings we get at other places, so we were very happy with these. A Kimchi Pork Taco was also very tasty, though a little harder to share as it was a single taco. The bulgogi kim bap (not sushi!!!) was very good. We also had spring rolls, crispy and oh-so-good.  Their menu changes a bit from time to time, but something I always see on it are the Green Tea Sugar Biscuits.  Don't hesitate. Get them for dessert. Hell, get them for your appetizer, your meal, whatever, just get them. Sugary, crispy, cool, and melty all at the same time.  Yum.We will be back in a few months when we are in town!

Specially love their spicy sauce, actually not that spicy for me. But their kimbab(not sushi!), squid kimbab is pretty spicy. Ordered bulgogi and squid kimbab but like squid better. When I tried squid kimbab before, it was not that spicy as I remember. Just be aware when you order squid kimbab, it can be very spicy sometimes. The pork belly was awesome! The balance of crispy skin and tender pork is perfect. First time to try and you should try if you love crispy pork skin. Kim-chili was spicy chili with kimchi in it but not as spicy as squid kimbab! This is my favorite place with outdoor game area and good food. But it will be good to avoid certain busy times as it will be so packed and bathroom lines will be too long lol"}, {"review_id": "fujI3iia0c6-8vuTucI2Lg", "user_id": "EaRd_4nFnPs8Fei-H2ZmVA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "What to get: half and half soy garlic and spicy wingsService: 4/5Atmosphere: bar and snack place, large, busy spaceWait: 20 mins (Friday 7PM for 1)Parking: street parking, some small parking lotsThe Experience:This is actually a 3.5, but I like rounding up. This place is very popular and a great spot for drinking and snacking. I love my Asian snacks on a Friday night, but so does a lot of people in Charlotte. Be prepared to wait during their popular times, even if you're coming solo like I did.Parking was kind of tough. I circled twice and you have to read some of the signs to be sure you're not parking illegally. A neighboring company does the pay mobile app on your phone, but if you're there, it charges for overnight fees by dinner time...so I'm unsure if other people also paid the overnight fee or just parked without knowing.The place itself is extensive. There's the indoor dining area, an outdoor front patio, and a back patio with games to play. They also have karaoke. Perfect place for college kids. Although you probably want to bring groups here, it can get tough with the wait, even if you're going to just sit at the bar.I'll cut to the food. You get the wings. I personally liked the soy garlic wings, which had a kind of thick crust on it when fried. The spicy wings were tasty as well. You can order wings as half and half so you can taste both.I also tried the potato swirl, which was kind of fun. The cut was thinner than I thought, so it was like eating thicker chips. Plus you get a sauce to dip it in. It's fun to try, but I wouldn't get it again.Flavored soju was a bit expensive, but it's only right to wash it down with either beer or soju. Lychee soju is lightly sweetened with a few lychee on a pick for you.Lastly, service is courteous, but can get swamped. I try to go easy on them and be extra patient when it's busy, but be sure to wave them down every once in awhile. Sometimes it takes awhile for them to get to you.Overall, a fun place, especially for happy hour, drinks, and Korean-influenced snacks. I probably won't be back for awhile, but I hope that they can possibly open another location to alleviate the crowds. I'd love to see it grow."}, {"review_id": "kY81v3R3AXcwd_S7avLImQ", "user_id": "meIvUYEEOUBUvQ-QVMat-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "What a fun place.

Where else are you going to get fantastic food, beer and games in the back, as well was Karaoke?! No but really, this place was so much fun. The food at Seoul is mostly wings which all I'm going to say about that is, between my 12 friends I tried just about every flavor and loved them all. Here's the cool part, all you vegetarians out there, they have tofu wings! And this is coming from my somewhat picky vegetarian girlfriend, she was a fan of the tofu wings so dig in! I'd also recommend getting the sweet potato birds nest, it legit looks like a birds nest with the fine bits of sweet potato - it's a winner for sure. Now that we covered the food, time for Karaoke! Yes this place has 3 private Karaoke rooms with a designated waiter to each and you never have a bad time at Karaoke. I'd recommend going on a Sunday, it's half off the room rent so it's $30 an hour as opposed to the usual $60, and with a decently that's dirt cheap. The rooms are, for lack of better verbiage, LIT. The night we went also had a tent up in the back with a bar and all sorts of games from beer pong to table tennis and such so that was definitely a lot of fun! ProTip: Get a reservation for big parties, this place is busy busy busy.

Best in Charlotte (BBQ / sauce based)- Great tasting food / Meats. Remember it's NOT traditional Korean BBQ.- Fun atmosphere. Cool karaoke rooms.Longer Review:Food: 5/5The wings alone are worth the visit. Definitely get the 1/2 and 1/2. I usually get a take-out order of wings each week so yeah, I've done thorough research. You're welcome.  A note for my fellow discerning wing connoisseur: you can request all flats (boo!) or all drums (the best part of the wing) for $1 more. The other non-chicken wing meats are delicious too. So are the non-meat food options. The birds nest is another go to for me. Location: 4.5/5I like that it's a bit tucked away from the main street (South Blvd) but still convenient to get to in South End. Parking is usually not an issue and there's plenty of bars a short walking distance away.Value: 5/5The price is moderate and well deserved given the quality, quantity and taste of the food. Customer service has always been friendly during my visits, especially my take-out orders.Service: 5/5Top notch service over at Seoul. Very attentive and the wait times for picking up your grub is usually around $20. It's become more popular so you may want to RSVP if they do that.Atmosphere: 5/5I've been to Seoul since it first opened and the updates they've made are pretty solid. There's some pretty dope karaoke rooms with awesome ambiance courtesy of wall paintings. You soak up the sun and your adult beverage outside while playing a plethora of games outside like corn-hole, etc. This spot is pretty legit for tailgating since it's in close proximity to Panther's stadium."}, {"review_id": "JOrjvqLZobs5TOL_44YuXA", "user_id": "0cG35-H4SbjjTTSlNoK3fw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "Oh Seoul, you know the way to my heart with your Korean flavors and innovated dishes. It all started with a coworker bringing some of your wings into our office and I was hooked. Came hear for happy hour and some bites to eat. The environment is cool. It's a clean industrial wood look, with music videos playing on several flatscreens. Our server was great and answered all of our questions. The food is served family style and comes out on the same tray. And some items may come out faster than others. Think Korean tapas style. The menu has a lot of unique items so be sure to ask questions. They also have a variety of adult beverages and local brews on tap. I ordered a bulgogi taco, chee chili ramen and collard greens. The bulgogi taco was my favorite. It was messy, but massive and packed a punch of flavor. The bulgogi was sweet and delicious. It had crunch and spice. It took me back to when I had the best bulgogi of my life at a food truck on the North Shore of Hawaii. The greens were spicy and had plenty of pork belly. The chili was interesting. It was a little spicy, but reminded me of a chili Mac. On the bottom was their take on Mac and cheese using ramen instead of macaroni. Service was on point. They were great at keeping our table clean and our cups full. We eventually moved out to the patio. On the way we saw the private karaoke rooms which you can rent by the hour. I love karaoke! On the patio, there's a bar and tons of games: giant jenga, cornhole, and oversized pool game.  I haven't laughed so hard in a long time while playing pool. It's pool, but with soccer balls and is harder than it looks. We're already planning to come back to eat and karaoke.

It was unusually warm out today, so I decided to schedule a happy hour here since they have such a good patio. Unfortunately, even though it was 75 outside, they had a tent up over the patio still. I feel like this was a pretty busy oversight since the sides could easily be rolled up. We ended up sitting on the front patio so that we could be outside. I love their food. I've had a large portion of the menu in the past. The ramen Mac and cheese is one if my favorites and the tacos are also quite good. All of the meat I've had are amazing. The wings are my favorite wings I've ever had. They are crispy and delicious. I love the soy garlic and my husband loves the spicy BBQ. We of course had to get them this time too. They have $1 sides until 5:30 which is a great deal, so we had to get something. We decided to go with the soy pickled deviled eggs and they were amazing. They are now my favorite deviled eggs. The soy added great flavor.  Our service was pretty bad this time. We did have a really big group, but I couldn't get more water the entire time even though I asked multiple times.

The silver lining for this place is their wings. As many others have said in their reviews, their wings are pretty damn good. If you skip out on the wings, you will probably be curious as to why this place is always packed (pro tip, get the Korean BBQ flavor). The drinks...I ordered an old fashioned, which is pretty hard to mess up, but boy did they mess it up. After 10 minutes the waiter brings out what looks to be someone's drink that had 2 sips left, to which I asked \"is this someone else's drink?\". He laughed and replied with \"that's just how it comes\". $13 in the hole for this crap; I was not laughing. It was a watered down mess. I think a nun that's never had a sip of alcohol in her life could probably make a better one. The beer I ordered was also a joke, brought out in a 10oz plastic cup and charged $6 for. $20 later and didn't even have a buzz. The rest of the food is certainly different and I think it just tries too hard. Their version of chili cheese fries are the kimchi fries. It's a muddled mess of flavor that doesn't mesh well with french fries. Their version of \"burgushi\" from Cowfish is not exciting at all. Bulgogi beef with no flavor that's wrapped in rice and kelp is just a terrible idea. If you have to put a warning on the menu about it \"not being sushi\", then it's probably indicative of something that's just a bad idea all around. Seoul Food Meat Company looks like it should be a killer spot. Unfortunately I think the best thing about this place are the cornhole boards out back.

For dinner, we split two half-options of the brisket and pork belly along with 3 sides. The boys ordered the butter beers (heavenly - a must try for HP fans), and the girls ordered the house margarita (happy median between sweet and sour, with a surprise coffee-tasting \"drip\" of sorts on the side - random, but it worked!). Needless to say we rolled out with very happy bellies. The atmosphere is very casual. Food is served in recyclable (I assume) baskets, which I find kind of strange - is there a reason that real dishes aren't used? Seems like a lot of waste. Aside from that, though, the atmosphere is vibrant and fun, and we also discovered the karaoke rooms in the back hallway heading toward the outdoor patio.
