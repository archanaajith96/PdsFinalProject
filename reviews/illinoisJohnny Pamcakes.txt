It was super busy when we went but with good reason service was fast and friendly and food was good. I eat a lot of food so I was satisfied that their skillet was almost more than I could finish. Biscuits and gravy we're also delicious.

I added a side of bacon to make it tastier )Chilli : 10French toast :10 they are huge!! I think the skillets/ eggs will be better if the hash browns were crispy . The food is very inexpensive and I think that is the reason why this place is always crowded( it's the first time I went but I overheard someone else saying that's the way it is all the time ) There is a little bit of a wait when you get there (about 15 minutes ) but the service is  really fast and they make sure you always have your coffee cup filled ."}, {"review_id": "fqkV7E8jyjAxZMzXp64yLg", "user_id": "YLXtmMLhNVJBPgwPlppaLA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/6/2017", "text": "This was plan B on the fly when my first place ended up not being open with yelps posted hours. The place looks like a repurposed restaurant from the past with a front sun room and a drive thru on the side.Parking was easy just after opening and seated was the same, please wait to be seated by the way. I was promptly seated with menu and water, plastic cup which I hate by the way. The place can best be described as an old school diner because it was dated. It has the lunch counter up front with booths and tables in the rest of the place and the crappy carpet mixed with that fast food brick looking floor tile thing. The menu has all the regulars and I was hoping that the chicken fried might be the needle in a hay stack real one, no frozen like 99% of the places that I ask if its a real one. Well I'm going to play it safe and just get the sausage patties with eggs, hash browns and sourdough toast.The food came right away and the sourdough toast looked great, not the I can't tell if it's white bread of sourdough when looking at it kind. The eggs were perfect sunny side up and the hash browns were good and cooked nicely. The sausage patties were juicy and not cooked to dry/death with good flavor, not the boring bland kind. The sourdough toast was good with that nice little chew which is my favorite toast option.Overall it was a solid breakfast and I can see why it filled up while I was there, not every breakfast place is a solid one believe it or not. I would have no problem going back for breakfast and my server was ok for how the place filled up."}, {"review_id": "PO5JEXamxMwtr4p_IT9Zyg", "user_id": "Z7KymKjOlcHuDJ9QsfT44A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/7/2017", "text": "Love love love this place.

I pivoted and headed to the counter.  A friendly waitress took my drink order and gave me a menu.  I asked for recommendations and I ordered the Southerner.  The food was served fast and with a smile.  The biscuits and gravy, eggs, and sausage were good.  I really liked the bacon which was thick and had a good smoked flavor.  Overall, a good traditional breakfast at a reasonable price.  Plus I love the name of the restaurant...very cute."}, {"review_id": "qvDrS3fNwkxEgnPeMuPmeA", "user_id": "GI8KqK_bUyc2oWJ-uhYcLg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "We would definitely come back here for the food.

They have some of the best skillets ever. They have a few different selections to choose from but they all sound so good which makes it hard to pick which one you want! The portion is very big & for a very good price as well. Their french toast is also great! Nothing too fancy, just plain and simple french toast. You can also add toppings to them if you'd like. The dining area is not that big. It can get cramped in their very quick, especially on the weekends. I usually order my food to go because it is so packed. But the food tastes just as good to go.

Great for breakfast and lunch, plus the portions can be good enough to share. Depending on what you get. I have been here a few times along with their newest location and both have been consistent.

The omelets really are good though, especially if you get an egg white omelet!  Can you say yummy?  I can!  \"Yummmmmyyyy!!!!\"Also I would recommend getting coffee because it's pretty good coffee and they refill it free of charge, like many other diners. Like many other diners, as well, Johnny Pamcakes is a bit old-fashioned with its interior decor, but to be honest that's kind of it's charm. Admittedly, some of the cushions would do well to be replaced and fixed, but I sort of like walking into this way old-fashioned diner.  It makes me feel like I'm not living in a completely modernized-technology-driven society.  To go on about the food just a little longer - the regular and Swedish pancakes are thick and hardly dry.  This is the go-to spot for anything and everything pancakes and breakfast.  The prices are also super reasonable - two people can dine here for around $10-15 at breakfast!  Aside from the food and atmosphere I should mention that the owners, John and Pam as the restaurant's name conveys, are super sweet and always helping out at the restaurant. If you want to support your local community then you should definitely do so here at Johnny Pamcakes.  They deserve your business and you, my little jedi, will come to understand the power of Johnny Pamcakes for yourself once you wander in.  This is definitely one of my favorite places in all of Rockford and I do hope you try it!  It's legendary...at least in my books!"}, {"review_id": "vG6MKMAUBxz9HHSIN5pw9Q", "user_id": "aFHoc8JGImkeHC65pOrxew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2016", "text": "I liked this place.

There is no chance I would have come here without the help of your people.I share the same sentiments of other yelpers in that this place needs a serious update. But as far as the food goes they are spot on.I ordered the Swedish connection which comes with 2 slices of bacon, two sausage links 2 eggs made how you like them and 2 Swedish pancakes. I've been to Stockholm Inn and have had their Swedish pancakes and as far as taste I don't think one rivals the other, but Johnny's are significantly larger. Yaaaas!!!! The only thing I would have changed is I should have ordered fruit on the side to accompany them. On the down side-their OJ isn't fresh squeezed. Comes straight outta a machine. Sad face. When we came there was a slew of people waiting to be seated. We thought it would take forever. Surprisingly it was as the hostess said, ten minutes. They seem to move people in and out quickly. Our food came out equally as fast. I think the trick is to know what you're ordering as soon as the waiter/waitress comes to your table. They also make breakfast to go if you wanna swing by in your pjs and eat it at home.Nom nom nom!!!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/johnny-pamcakes-rockford?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
