There is a very small stage in the window area for bands in which it was tuesday and wouldn't ya know Blue Yonder was just getting warmed up.  Yay!  The music definitely made the scene!!  Bartender dueled as server. He was very knowledgeable, cool, and killed the perfect Manhattan!!!  Before we ordered any food and had gazed at our menus which seemed like we were just drawn in by the descriptions, my husband looked at me with a twinkle in his eye and said \"Babe, this place has really good food!  Im excited!  Im so glad you found it\".   Bluegrass kitchen has an amazing menu!  It was very hard to decide, my husband ordered 2 appetizers immediately Canadian Pub fries along with Beer Cheese Fondue.  Both were great portions!  Canadian Pub Fries were very tasty but could definitely use more gravy!  Maybe a side of it or just more .  There was not much on the fries maybe a couple spoonfuls drizzled across the top but very little beyond the top layer.  My husband was so hungry though he just used the beer cheese fondue to eat what fries were remaining in the basket.  The Beer Cheese Fondue was tasty, smooth and a great set up to share.  The sliced beer bread is paired well with the cheese, but my hubs preferred just to eat the cheese with the fries.Band ended 1 set, took a break, we snuck in a smoke break ..but not before putting our dinner order in.  I read the menu atleast 3 different times and debated through drinks and appetizers what I wanted on my palate.  We asked the bartender for his recommendations (so sorry I wish the manhattans would have atleast let me remember his name but there was only 1 this evening) His first choice was exactly what I was thinking - I love when people know good food!  I chose the Pickle-Brined Fried Chicken served with braised kale and whipped cauliflower.  Let me tell you, THIS IS THE BEST FRIED CHICKEN I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!  OMG!  Lets start with there are no bones.  2 Fried chicken breast.  I don't even know how to describe it but the chicken, as you bring it to your mouth you can smell all the hard work put into this dish.  The aroma is amazing!  As I bit into it, my teeth sunk into the many layers of preparation.  This thick crunchy buttermilk layer coating this juicy so flavorful brined chicken breast blew my tastebuds away.  The whipped cauliflower was oh so delectable and surprisingly I have never had them but I love cauliflower too so why not and now addicted to whipped cauliflower like that! The kale had its own amazing contribution to the plate.  I can honestly say I wouldn't be surprised if this was voted the best meat/chicken dish in Charleston, WV!  However I am biased to this dish and will prob have to make a trip to Charleston in the future just to have another taste lol My husband ordered the meatloaf.  It was served with mashed potatoes topped with green tomato gravy and french style greenbeans.  The meatloaf was very tasty.  It seemed like an old school recipe, maybe jalepenos in the mix..... definitely tasted like delicious homemade comfort food.  My husband totally killed it and most of my plate too lol But comparing these 2 dishes just isn't so.  I tried the meatloaf after my chicken and it should have been the other way around as my dish blew my tastebuds away!!!!!At this point I am going to explode, since we are in from out of town for just 1 night, leftovers just are not an option, so no crumb was left behind.  My husband decided to end strong with a slice of their key lime pie for dessert. I seriously thought he was crazy but as soon as it was laid before my eyes, I submissively picked up my dessert spoon and happily dug in.  The creaminess of the whipped cream/ice cream not sure what the yummy concoction was but it was the bomb!  Perfectly paired with the key lime.  The graham cracker crust!!!  It was the crust of all graham cracker crust thick not too soft not too hard, PERFECT!   Awesome way to end dinner and it coincided with the end of music, so we couldn't have planned it much better.    This is an amazing place.  Casual or dressy come as you are!  Great vibe Great people Great music, and most importantly Great Food!  It does take time for orders to make it to the table, but you cannot rush perfection and well worth the wait.    Definitely recommend to everyone visiting Charleston, Wv.Here are a few pics."}, {"review_id": "TQF0Y1-e3gENECcboE3-kA", "user_id": "55DgX1ZhaJ6Z9Cdp7QSYQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Ive been here a year now and cant believe I just came for the first time.

It's a colorful collection of flavors and sights that treats all the senses. My favorite offering here is the fried buffalo tofu. The tofu seems to be marinaded in that spicy vinegary buffalo sauce. The breading is crunchy and the texture of the tofu is almost like mozzarella cheese except it doesn't melt and pull. The Reuben was also fantastic. Tender corned beef and flavorful thousand island dressing. Served with a generous amount of fries. Avoid the taco salad because it's very lackluster. Also avoid their famous blueberry pie which sort of tastes like a pecan pie if you're not into to overly sweet things - though I must say the fresh vanilla cream is amazing.  I can just eat a plate of that cream."}, {"review_id": "ez-7VkIXmkzsVcZpQL60UQ", "user_id": "Ohr_XR1uiFE8UvpL6ID2Kw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/2/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "One of the best qualities in any good restaurant is consistency. Bluegrass kitchen has that. The quality of the food, drink and service is impeccable. We've been here with friends three times now: twice for Sunday Brunch (oh the Bloody Marys are GREAT), and once for dinner.  My bacon and eggs breakfast with potatoes and rye toast was wonderful. For dinner it was the BGK Reuben; the Meatloaf; and, the Organic Tostada with Grilled Chicken. All were good but the Tostada wins hands down. I'm ordering that next time. Great organic and locally sourced ingredients here!"}, {"review_id": "2Az0sf1CqpjbKep1jxXsqQ", "user_id": "iwnn6BRsv9gdGy6HzzAAWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/21/2017", "text": "I was in West Virginia for a couple of days and was recommended this place. IT IS AMAZING. The food is so fresh, staff is very friendly, and they have a variety of local beers, which is a must for me personally when traveling to new cities. We shared three plates: the trout, the pork chop, and the fried chicken. They were all delicious, but personally, the fried chicken was my favorite. It was crispy and juicy, without being too greasy. The pork chop was my second favorite, it had a delicious sweet taste to is that wasn't too overpowering and tasted so fresh! Oh and also, for dessert, order the blueberry buttermilk pie. I suggest getting your own serving because it is so good, you won't want to share!! Our server was very friendly, explained to us where all the food was and how fresh it was! Definitely a must when in Charleston!"}, {"review_id": "yi9Gl8FjdoOlopfrtpGy2g", "user_id": "NzsQ48rZSNSo5CogINxLFQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "Stopped in on a work trip to Charleston!

But since it's local and trying to be different, I'm ok with 3Arrived at 2 pm for Sunday brunch. Almost immediately seated and given water. And then service basically disappeared for 15 solid minutes. Finally got to order and told the waitress that I had to be at the Charleston airport by 3 ish, was there something on the menu that didn't take a long time to prepare. She suggested the corned beef hash. At about 2:20 I FINALLY got a cup of coffee. Food comes out about 2:35. And it's almost cold. I went ahead and asked for the check and began to chow down quickly. Honestly, the food was fine but a bit bland. I added an egg to the dish at the waitress's suggestion, and wasn't asked/didn't think about how it would be cooked. I think it was poached. I don't mind runny eggs but I was kinda surprised. The berry preserve was excellent but the bread was boring white. I'll go back again. Not while I'm on a tight schedule though. And I'll not be shy about being a bit more politely verbal about the lackluster service. Keep trying BGK! You're on to something but need to dot the i's and cross the t's IMO."}, {"review_id": "pMt4tQMb7ccWriAMkb35Ow", "user_id": "vjrH8shO5ybyZ7zvw7c-7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "Great food and live music.

We were promptly seated and given menus. It was about time for lunch, but the breakfast burger, which the waitress recommended, sounded appetizing because it had an egg on it. So that's what I ordered. I overheard the waitress telling a customer that the fries were tasty while they're hot, but they lose flavor as they cool off. The fries were unremarkable.When I received my burger, it was burned on the outside and well done on the inside. I ate it anyway, despite the mild char flavor. The bun sort of fell apart too. My dad ordered biscuits and gravy, but it was bland. The bacon was burned and basically turned into powder in your mouth.  Didn't taste good.We visited Charleston, WV to watch a high school playoff football game, but we didn't know exactly where it was being played. Well, our waitress knew exactly where the game was and so off we went. She was very helpful.The food here is okay, but could be a little better.  It's tough to compete with the amazing food I'm used to in Cleveland."}, {"review_id": "yMoXTzQfo7TmH3zKSf4yqg", "user_id": "q4wDRjJPKWT6ieF7b680JQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/30/2017", "text": "Had some meatloaf.

The brisket tacos, chicken tacos, bread pudding, house made hummus and draft beer were all so good!
