Mr. B's BBQ Shrimp is truly the best served anywhere!!!  And what do you do with all that delicious buttery sauce served with the shrimp?  No worries, you'll get as much freshly baked bread as you need to sop up every delicious drop."}, {"review_id": "DnUVCgncXcOvOJME3mF-Og", "user_id": "4o31ime-5ID31uUNYuRlow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Two words: BARBECUE SHRIMP.For real.

Ordered the fried green tomatoes and Crawfish Pasta, husband had the seafood gumbo and the Mr.B's Barbecued shrimp. Before I even get to the food, let me just say that the service here is impeccable. We had 3 different people waiting on us. Normally, this is a mess, but at Mr B's, they all communicated with each other. We got our food quickly (drinks took a little bit longer but we were hungry so we didn't care) and thy apologized for that. As soon as you leave for the bathroom, one of the waitresses comes over and  folds up your napkin-Michelin star style. The MrB's BBQ'd shrimp was my favorite, very smoky and peppery and full of flavor. Hey also provide warmed bagged bread.

It just fit. We were a little ahead of the post-5 pm dinner crowd so being seated was no problem. Although we did not visit it, the bar looked very inviting.They serve a freshly baked small loaf of bread to munch on while reviewing the menu. Nice crunch to the crust yet soft on the inside. The have a good selection of drinks from the bar - beers, wine, and cocktails. I was pleased with the properly cold Sam Adams Lager. Twice. I wanted a small plate as we were going to a musical later and I did not want to have to fight off the urge to nap at intermission. I ordered two appetizers, the crab cake and the fried oysters. The crab cake had  ample claw meat in the filling and a nice, lite crust. Tasty. The 6 oysters were  crispy on the outside yet not greasy. The light batter coating had good flavor while the oysters themselves were still tender. My wife yielded to the temptation of the 8 ounce filet mignon which is served with roasted Idaho potato slices. The steak was lightly coated with a truffle butter. She loved it and I agree. (I was coerced into eating part of it.)The service was professional and friendly. We are going back so I can have a filet all to myself."}, {"review_id": "tbmUhDmU8R5mAYMDlGag6w", "user_id": "4MJ7go3WJwIcak_17vWw9w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Came here for our last big meal before leaving NOLA. It was Monday and we came for lunch. The place is really big so we were able to get a table for 8. The service here was very good. The drinks were pretty good but I have to say the BRANDY MILK PUNCH was the best. We ordered a bunch of entrees. The most popular item was the bbq shrimp which comes with a bib and a hot moist towel with lemon slices to clean your hands afterwards. I was hoping to get my shrimp and grits but unfortunately its only offered for dinner. I settled for the SHRIMP & ANGEL HAIR PASTAA pan sauté of Gulf shrimp served atop angel hair pasta tossed with garlic and herb rich butter sauce | 18.5 - It was done very well with plenty of shrimp. Not too much food but enough to fill you. I enjoyed it but nothing too special. Definitely would have been happier if I got my shrimp and grits. I would give this place another try if I was in the area. Located in the French Quarters. Very classy bathrooms downstairs."}, {"review_id": "jjSqitnwEf5b9kjxWk-BNg", "user_id": "xSlBsTTPtPvwlclBIvAjYw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "A classy and classic restaurant in New Orleans.

The menu isn't huge but it's nice and the weekly specials are a way to keep locals returning.  Started with the Royal Street Salad , crisp romaine with blue cheese and bacon that's tossed in good herb vinaigrette.  The Spicy Shrimp Arrabbiata was perfect with plump shrimp and italian sausage , sliced garlic,  red pepper and tomatoes tossed with penne pasta.  The sliced garlic takes on a different flavor compared to minced garlic and gave the dish nice twist. Service was very good today with Morgan,  Eastin and Raushaz and I'm sure they were beat after Mardi Gras and Valentine's Day the next day.  The only complaint would be staff not busy talking to loud about what they did last night."}, {"review_id": "dZ0k7Y_Wq8CbeRzkED_dYA", "user_id": "Elx7e4mAovPHNa1cahN6MA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Great jazz Sunday Brunch!! The food is excellent and the 3 instrument floating jazz band is awesome. The band is comprised of 3 older gentlemen who are fun, talented & play an assortment of tunes. We had 2 cappuccinos and split a muffuletta and the bread pudding. Both were delicious! The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is the price. $22 for a muffuletta half the size of the one at Central Grocery but then again, you're paying for the ambience as well.

While visiting the area this place was recommended by our Lyft driver. She said they had the best BBQ shrimp and bread in all of NOLA and I was up to finding out if that was true!We arrived right when they were setting up for dinner. I was able to check out the menu and knew that I wanted to give their three course meal a try. You get a bowl of gumbo yaya to start your meal, BBQ shrimp and bread pudding for dessert. I wanted it all. The gumbo yaya was fantastic! So much flavor and a perfect compliment for the crusty bread they serve. The BBQ shrimp were also a huge win. So honest moment here, the shrimp come with their heads on - apparently that's where all the flavor is...I'm just not ready to take the head off of the shrimp. Sorry, folks! But I asked that the dish they come without the heads and they happily obliged. These shrimp were large and prepared perfectly! I'd absolutely recommend this dish! I was too stuffed to try the bread pudding. I'm sure it's good. Overall, this place is worth a visit if you're in the area! And it's perfect if you're planning a date night or girls night out!
