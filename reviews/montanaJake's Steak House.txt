Seriously delicious and craveable!! They get busy but get you in and out as quick as you need.Dinner is exceptional with a solid steakhouse vibe. You can't go wrong with the steaks, and I had a delicious prime rib. Their potato cake side is very different and incredibly delicious! They even tried to serve us a bottle of wine that had turned and they were very professional about the entire situation.Great spot to just stop in for a drink or late night bite to eat too!Service is always good. Bar area is great for lunch, dining area wonderful for dinner, even the back dining area which is in their back bar. Intimate and quiet, perfect for a nice family meal. Kid friendly."}, {"review_id": "neEg8qidgEy3sMnYcmsUag", "user_id": "ouDR5CnFknY-CTTlHtz5gw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "Ate here early on a Saturday with a 5pm reservation. We had two children with us under two and they sat us perfectly so that we had space. I found it to be very kid-friendly. Most of the table ordered a seafood option. The special was swordfish was excellent and prepared nicely. The blackened shrimp is wonderfully seasoned and cooked well. The salads are generous and have quality toppings. Their house wine selection is good. I ordered a house Chardonnay which was floral and bright. It was nice to have a good option on the low end. Everyone in our party was pleased with their meals and the accommodation of our children. We stayed for 2 hours and did not feel pressured or rushed to leave."}, {"review_id": "8LPOzeVMP5vCdGn7S_28hQ", "user_id": "p8X7Ltp7RX1hygYFY6Ux_A", "rating": 1.0, "date": "10/24/2017", "text": "This is one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long time....except this is something like a $25 a plate joint so you'd really really expect better. We waited about a half hour for drinks. Now I can understand mixed drinks taking slightly longer because bartenders get backed up. However, the drink to come out last was a diet soda. How long does it take to fill a glass with soda?Ordered food which of course takes a while. When it comes out, 3 of the party of 7 received cold meals. They offer to reheat the cold meals but as you can imagine, reheating steak and fried shrimp makes it really delicious. The food that was hot ranged from \"really good\" to \"meh\" but mostly \"meh.\" One of our party went to speak to the manager, she made a point to go out of the dining room so as to not disturb other diners. However the guy apparently hasn't attended management school 101, and instead chose to argue with her and basically call her a liar. He even says he had plated some of the meals himself and they were not cold. If he had wanted, he could have come over and stuck his finger in the damn food. It was cold. She came back to our table and he followed. One of our party pointed out that the food had just arrived and we'd been there over an hour. He says \"oh so now it's been over an hour\". Are you kidding!!! By this point the reheated food comes out and he stands there and asks with a very condescending tone, \"is it hot enough now? Are you sure?\" I ask him to not patronize her please and he says he was only trying to make the situation better. Well, count that as one of many fails tonight. They did end up not charging for the shrimp meal since the reheated rubber wasn't eaten. We shared our meals with that member of our party so she wouldn't have to eat that crap. They also comped 20%  of our bills. I felt sorry for the waitress as for save maybe the soda taking forever, it probably wasn't her fault and just made serving us uncomfortable....plus she has to work for that jerk of a manager. I can't imagine."}, {"review_id": "bARKxDeXLm435x6Q4uQekQ", "user_id": "ZPpkQqd1eBu6Kbohacub8w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "This is probably one of my top 3 restaurants in Billings Montana. Sharing with my daughter a gift certificate that was given to us we had our drinks first a bottle of a beautiful wine paired with shrimp cocktail and a huge Lobster that was way too expensive but market price it was wonderful. My birthday was complete. The waiter sorry I forgot his name but he was wonderful. He was funny classy helpful and confident always offering service anytime we needed it without being overly intrusive. Unlike other restaurants he didn't try to give us our check too early and didn't try to push things on us to fast. He was quite a delight. Another reason I like this restaurant is it wasn't too loud the music was just right and it was quaint at the time we went. My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. Thank you to Jake's I enjoyed my birthday."}, {"review_id": "-q6Vg2uJ0jGqIJKy477Z6w", "user_id": "Bj7fulvocUEvgJqlLxNKyA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "I have eaten here twice and both times my prime rib has come out over cooked.

No worries, we let the first four start while I and my client sat talking another 20 minutes. Once the food arrived I was more than pleased. I ordered the Ribeye Steak. They char the outside while the inde as a perfect medium rare. For desserts we split four between us in order to all have a small taste. It was fun and very good.

Started with the coconut shrimp appetizer. Very good. 4 butterflied jumbo shrimp with a crisp coconut coating. The habanero dipping sauce had that just right combo of sweetness and heat. Would def order this again. Moved on to the halibut caprese salad for both of us. Not great. The greens were crisp and fresh but not exciting. Just romaine with sliced tomatoes and mozzarella. The tomatoes were not ripe and were flavorless. The halibut had no sear at all. In fact I couldn't detect any evidence that it wasn't boiled. It was tough, chewy, and really over cooked. Jake's is probably great for beef and that's likely the route we should've gone -but we both love halibut and had high hopes. The salad sounded amazing on the menu.

Anyway, 415 miles or not, we were hungry by the time we entered Montana's largest city.We took the North 27th Street exit to take us to City Center, allowing us views of such vistas as the Women's Prison, Pizza Hut, and the Lucky Cuss Casino. At last downtown greeted us, and when we saw Jake's, we made a quick decision to park at a nearby garage and go in. At first we were excited - this seemed like a classic steakhouse, where one could get any type of slab of meat they wanted and pick up a bit of the local gossip while they were at it. Well, Jake's was indeed that way in certain respects. Unfortunately, the joint didn't exactly greet us. Upon walking in, there was no indication as to whether we were supposed to wait for a greeter or sit ourselves. One waitress vaguely gestured to us that we could go wherever we wanted. So we did, only to be intercepted by another waitress who looked rather pissed, who guided us to the table we had intended to sit at. Yes, that is one of my pet peeves.Our apparent cardinal sin of not knowing the seating protocol may have been the reason why our service was at best indifferent, but I'm chalking it up to drawing the wrong waitress. I will say that my buffalo burger more than met my expectations, and although the fact that Billings is one of the more isolated towns in America sports-wise, televisions were attuned to a number of ESPN-like stations, which I appreciated. And in spite of the restaurant's name, there were some vegetarian options, in fact it seemed one could order almost anything they wanted."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/jakes-steak-house-billings?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
