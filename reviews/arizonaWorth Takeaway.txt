Since Anthony has taken over the menu and sandwich design, there isn't a sandwich I haven't tried that I haven't loved! The bread has a great texture/chew and every sandwich is flavored to perfection. The most recent sandwich I had was the bahn mi - the pork was incredibly seasoned with the best pickled slaw melody I've ever had! My go-to is their french dip (YUM!). Go. Eat. Enjoy!"}, {"review_id": "gGGlauAQ-6Uv1TYxHqmhQg", "user_id": "rIBKugmqaHr31-puHAk7cg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Fresh from panning for gold in Apache Junction, we stopped in Mesa on our way back to Scottsdale.  We were  hungry and looking to trade our treasures for good food.  At first, the wife thought we were lost, seeing only a string of car dealerships, car washes and car repair shops.  Then, a giant \"sandwich\" sign was visible on the horizon, though largely obscured by overgrown trees.  We parked the car and made our way inside what seemed like an oasis. Free bottles of cold water!!! Kids food for $4!!!  What sort of business is this?  A fantastic one. My wife, connoisseur of buffalo chicken sandwiches, says \"the crunchy chicken, the slaw, the sauce, the bits of blue cheese... this is the best d*** buffalo chicken sandwich I've ever had.\"  My children cannot understand how potato-y the chips are.  \"Have we always been eating potato chips?  What were those other things?\" they wonder aloud.Satisfied, we load back into the car and spend the remainder of our trip home talking about the food from this place.  Turns out we had to pay with real dollars.  But check those cacti -- some have a little fool's gold in their jars!"}, {"review_id": "wo_9bGUip82cpOZQ_sv3YQ", "user_id": "tPQo0fqYdJiI1BQvto5qXw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Never heard about this place till I saw them on the IG @bestfoodphoenix then decided to check on the reviews and was saw the raving reviews and 5 star rating! I knew it was a place to check out the hype. So we drove out to the restaurant, easy finding parking and it's right in front of the light rail station. When we first walked in, it was a small cute dining area with a walk up ordering. The server was SUPER friendly! He took really good care of us since it was our first time and recommended the crispy chicken sandwich and spicy pork. We even got to sample their house made beverages and they were very refreshing! So we ordered the two sandwiches and got them in a timely manner. The first bite was absolutely incredible. I liked how our food was right off the stovetop and into our mouths. The sauces for each sandwich was incredible! Overall, a fantastic experience and did not disappoint! Definitely worth checking out! Heard they will have a Louisiana fried chicken special coming out soon"}, {"review_id": "90UQqaLCFK4iIEDXINKNJQ", "user_id": "r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Wow!  Loved the sandwiches.  My mom got a French dip and it was delicious!  I had the crispy chicken and it was excellent!  Great customer service!  Cute, small place, but there are tables outside (bummer for summer).  I highly recommend!  I live in Gilbert, and it was worth the drive!"}, {"review_id": "l6kaCWTqGNqD-q4cMArjFA", "user_id": "WhgZtJF4maYx-F1-UVRHnw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We took another trip here today and MY OH MY I LOVE THIS PLACE MORE AND MORE! haha Literally everything is extremely delicious, fresh, and the flavors are bold and mouthwatering. I have never been disappointed with anything here. I, of course, indulged in a spiced honey iced latte and it was refreshing and tasty as always. The spiced honey is a great flavor and I can't wait till they expand their coffee to start using some of the other flavors offered. The vanilla or chocolate nib would probably be awesome! I should have gotten a bottle to take home. I just have one complaint - WHY AREN'T THERE MORE!

Everything is about $1 higher than a year ago. Still, the consistent high-quality of their food was something I appreciate, as well as their great customer service.I had the cold brew with a dash of almond milk, and was pleasantly surprised as the spicy kick it had. 9/10.Veggie Sandwich: This was good, and you can tell a lot of thought goes into choosing what goes in the sandwich. The ingredients work well together (and look pretty). 7.5/10.Spicy Pork Sandwich: Honestly... this was disappointing. It wasn't spicy at all. It was quite bland, to be perfectly honest. It was cooked right and the ingredients were quality, but the taste was underwhelming, especially for something titled \"spicy\". There was honestly 0 spice. 5/10.Crispy Chicken Sandwich: THE STANDOUT SANDWICH. Seriously, this was amazing and made my review 5 stars. If you are having trouble choosing what to eat off the menu, do yourself a favor and just get this one. Seriously. 10/10.I'd come back because I am curious about trying the pudding. Unfortunately, only 1 out of the 3 sandwiches I had really wowed me. I'd get the cold brew coffee again, because the spicy kick really interested me!"}, {"review_id": "kUq8DRdpbNVNHmjsOUDROA", "user_id": "EEBwD-y9SkpxdALajzOTYw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "We stopped in here to grab some food before leaving town.  Got my daughter the peanut butter sandwich.  The bread was really great...fresh, flavorful and crunchy crust and lots of really delicious, fresh peanut butter, too!  My picky eater loved it - which is worth it's weight in gold!  The house made chips accompanied it and they were pretty good, too.I had the cold brew latte - it has a pretty strong cinnamon taste that I didn't realize it would have and I didn't really care for that, but it was a good quality of coffee, so thumbs up.  My husband and I each got a breakfast burrito.  The potatoes were well cooked and I love that they grill it before wrapping it up.  Really large portion, too.  And it comes with a tasty, not too spicy verde sauce. Overall, pretty good!

Small menu. I wanted some spice, most things were just spicy sauces, no jalapeños :/ Got the fried chicken with spicy chili sauce, was very good, but needed more heat. On a scale 1-5, id say it was about 2. Kind of like a fancy chicken sandwich from that fast food chicken place. Also got the spicy pork, the right about of spice in the sauce, but the pork lacked flavor.

Each one has been even better than the last. Worth pays extra attention to quality ingredients and owners are super nice. Each and every visit, I have been greeted by employees that are welcoming and take the time to make sure each guest leaves happy. The delicious sea salt potato chips are made in-house. As is, the pickles and seasonal jam. For what Worth doesn't made in-house, they have teamed up with local places like Proof, Danzenisen Dairy, and Steadfast Farm. Sending localists over the moon from all the AZ love fest happening in just one spot. Whether, it is for an awesome morning start with a tasty Breakfast Sammy, to amazing lunch with a unique twists on classic sandwiches like Crispy Chicken and Grilled Cheese or an evening snack of yummy homemade Bread Pudding for dessert, Worth Takeaway is a great option any time of day! At the start of the new year, Worth added new menu items so looks like I'll be back to try even more!"}, {"review_id": "RmCHPUSOtWFnRYAfMdaUgw", "user_id": "2VOWNrWndTG-og33u5t7hg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Wow this place is delicious!

Combined with the horseradish crema, provolone, greens all squished in between a cold cut ciabatta. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.Just a good mixture of flavor, nothing overpowering, but a burst of everything in your mouth when you bite into it.Not sure if I was starving that night, or was it that good?I Devourer the entire sandwich without hesitation.Price $9.75. definitely on the more expensive side, but you get the fresh meat and ingredients.Definitely quality at this place for the price.Would like to come back and try all their other sandwiches.

I was in the Mesa area today and getting hungry so when I searched lunch on my phone, Worth was only 2 miles away!! YIPEEEEE!! I went STRAIGHT there! It has been in my bookmarks for so long but I just hadn't made it out to Mesa to try it! I was literally the happiest camper. I ordered their roast beef sandwich and you guys - it. was. SO. dreamy. It had house made roast beef, horseradish crema, imported provolone, Steadfast Farm greens and giardiniera, served on Proof ciabatta. Can you say local love?! So many amazing local businesses are supported at Worth and that makes my heart so happy. It is also worth noting that the sandwiches are very large! I was super hungry so ate it all but could definitely be happy with a half as well. I will definitely be craving this sandwich on the regular. I also had their house made chips and those are a MUST. So yummy and salted to perfection. I'll make a point to come more often now that i've experienced their amazingness!"}, {"review_id": "1DebmgqV3u7wlE0GeSiwzw", "user_id": "siVtjO8xrSxbrK-zqXCGew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "This is our new go-to sandwich shop.  They have a great assortment of sandwiches, as well as a special of the day.  The second time we stopped in, I got a swordfish sandwich that was absolutely to die for!  I love that they offer bottled water for free with your sandwich.  The house made chips are crisp with just the right amount of salt.  If you come during the lunch rush, it might be hard to find a table.  Never fear.  Head a few doors down to Oro Brewing and grab a beer and eat your sandwich on their patio."}, {"review_id": "XypDwoJHa4qjPWfCg4-8_w", "user_id": "Olo_x4fV1sFBtlj6COf9Wg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/10/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Got here on Ramen night last monday (once a month) and hit the Shoyu Ramen (I talked to the chef - they're doing a different ramen each month - hey - when's Kitakata ramen night?  :-)).Wow - really great - good noodles, great softboiled egg, tasty char shu pork, good broth.Only thing that would've made it better would be a spoon with the hook on the handle that keeps the spoon from going swimming in the broth  ;-)If you're in the neighborhood on ramen night, make it a special point to go (if not, go anyway - the sandwiches are really good)."}, {"review_id": "2aZRA1FTYawYiQ9jRSYGkQ", "user_id": "WWOiE3X0hNC7x2R7Q-xK1g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/29/2017", "text": "Cute little sandwich shop in downtown Mesa.  Totally surprising find. The Reuben and the chicken salad were sandwiches of choice.  What was nice about both sandwiches was the filling was not overwhelmed by the bread. The chicken was on sourdough and the Reuben on a nice ciabatta roll.  The only suggestion I would make is ease up with the salt in the chicken salad. The salt level was pretty high and distracted from the sandwichThe house chips were a delight to eat. They were crunchy without being greasy and they were sprinkled with just the right amount of salt"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/worth-takeaway-mesa?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
