As far as Korean food goes, this is some of the best I've ever had. The interior is really cozy with dark wood and exposed brick. It is a café style restaurant so you order at the counter and wait for your food to be delivered so keep that in mind in case you were hoping for a more relaxed sit-down experience.I ordered the shrimp shumai and the jap chae with chicken. The shrimp shumai were really flavorful with nice plump shrimp inside. I had never ordered jap chae before but I was oh so happy with my choice. The sweet potato noodles melt in your mouth and the veggies and chicken were grilled to perfection. So yummy! My friends got the bibimbap and ramen which looked equally delicious.I have to come back soon because there was so much on the menu that I wanted to try. The Den Den monkey balls are next on my list!"}, {"review_id": "LOYAXIl-9AZbBc0rqyEDKg", "user_id": "0MFyg4QIUCZ03YZ0A2lyAA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/1/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Whatever you do, do NOT order the soft tofu soup (sundubu-jjigae) with seafood or squid!I have always enjoyed the food and hot beverages at Den Den during the few times that I've been but since yesterday's visit, I have started to reevaluate my opinion. Usually I get my spicy tofu soup fix at Sun & Moon but it was closed so I decided to go to Den Den as it was the closest option. Mokban's tofu soup is OK but it would not have satisfied my craving.Anyway, let's cut to the chase - the calamari in the soup was like chunks of a tire that looked like sliced mozzarella but tasted like clams. There was another animal in there that slightly resembled a mussel but tasted like a rubber duck with the scent of the ocean. I had to get my money's worth so I chewed it until I finally had to spit it out. Would I go again? Most likely. Would I order any type of seafood from Den Den ever again? Absolutely not."}, {"review_id": "yQlgxFI8sLMUCv5KQBfDJA", "user_id": "5ctu-O-T2OeozZTCzbv47A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Best Korean place on college Hill. They do Japanese as well but I haven't tried any of those options. Favorite dish is the barbecue shirt ribs by far. Great flavors with good mix of meat and onions. The bi bim bap is always a safe bet as well. I'm a big fan of the tofu stew. They have a pretty large variety meats for the stew which is perfect on a colder day in Providence. The agedashi tofu is all right. You are seated and then go up to the counter top order the food which is a little weird but not that difficult. All in all, great place to come by if it's not too busy. They tend to attract a line more often than not."}, {"review_id": "C9C5a-YCLbtWGS1-k47gAg", "user_id": "8MdLRHSKok2RzD2PkeXCOQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Delicious food served. .

The hostess took our name, told us 20 minutes and that we could order drinks but not food if we wanted a table. We waited in line for 5 minutes to order 2 beers, which were just ok and very overpriced. After 20 minutes, of standing because there is nowhere to sit while waiting, we were seated. As we were handed the menus, we were told we'd have to go back up to the counter to order food. So back we went. And after another 10 minute wait in line, we placed our order and expressed our disdain for the overall flow. The cashier even acknowledged it was inefficient, especially during busy times. The food came out quickly; I ordered the seafood Bi Bim Bap, which was just ok, I've definitely had better. Not impressed with Den Den at all. On top of the ridiculous way to order food, parking on Benefit Street is for the birds. If you go, Uber it."}, {"review_id": "d-SgwuM4EEy7Ny2JKrPywg", "user_id": "vHD6gH1GU9-qtTP_b-hypg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Came here on a Friday night at around 7pm. We thought it would be packed with a wait (that's what they told us over the phone) but there was actually 4 or 5 tables empty so we got a seat right away.We were looking forward to eating some asian food in Providence and were happy to see that this place is owned and operated by koreans. The service structure here is a little odd though. I got there before my co-worker and they showed me to my seat and gave me a menu. The server did tell me that i had to order at the counter but I was confused because she gave me a menu at the table. But yes, you do order at the counter. The funny thing is they bring you your food and kept asking if we needed anything while we were eating. So... maybe you should just take orders at the table too? :)I ordered the japchae with beef. It had really good flavor was super tasty. However, the beef was pretty dry. I probably would order it next time with chicken.My coworker got the short ribs. They were slathered with a very sweet korean style bbq sauce that was flavorful but we both agreed was too sweet. He's korean and he said it was pretty authentic though."}, {"review_id": "yA-IYP0uf-ACm1csUHN93A", "user_id": "2J5wxMjU9d68JvxToUpmUA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Good but honestly not great.

I had the Korean beef bibimbap with a fried egg and a peach soju. It was super flavorful I love how the bibimbap is served, in a sizzling bowl, so it remains nice and hot throughout eating it! Comes with kimchi and the kimchi is made very well. My BF got the same meal only with chicken and no fried egg. He loved it too! The service was wonderful. We went around 6 on a Friday and it wasn't too packed. I'd like to try some other dishes next time. My only con is it's incredibly pricey the soju was like $15! Oops.

Parking is a bit of an issue. I have never lucked into a spot in their tiny lot. I just drive down Benefit street until I find a spot on the street and then walk back. Walking on Benefit Street is an added perk. Just build in a few extra minutes so that you are not late.Order at the counter and then they deliver it to your table. Everyone is super friendly. The space is great with exposed brick and wooden tables that can easily be pushed together to accommodate groups of more than 4.

I wish that I could have had a server but you have to order your food at the register and then you sit down and wait for it. This might be ok sometimes but after a long day at work I just wanted to sit down and relax! There also seems to be some mix up for who is ordering takeout and who is ordering to sit and eat at the restaurant. It's a bit squishy inside and was packed for a Thursday night. The parking nearby is also difficult. I got lucky and found some street parking after searching for a few minutes. This was my first time trying Korean food. The dumplings were my favorite. The bibimbap was pretty good also. It had rice, veggies, spicy chicken, and a fried egg. I love the bowls that the food is served in. I'd go back to try something different.

The times I've been, the meat portions have been really generous, too (though the pork can be pretty fatty). However, I really wish the banchan were more variable and available. I tend to judge Korean restaurants by their banchan, and Den Den's just doesn't have a lot to offer. In addition, service could use a bit of help. I think the staff is really overworked. For example, when my friends and I were trying to place our orders, the person at the front had to walk off to take care of something in the kitchen/in the back/in the drink area (this kept happening). Overall, don't expect to get a super fast dinner at Den Den -- the line will be long, and it might take some time for you to order/get your food. That being said, the food will probably leave you happy. :)"}, {"review_id": "Nn6f9mnhkZUYiQ2sr8r05g", "user_id": "AFGPdJgVP0EnmOxZnC-fJA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/5/2017", "text": "Den Den is a solid fusion of Korean & Japanese food in Providence. The restaurant is modernized as a fast casual set up (order at the cash register, and food will be delivered to your table). + DEN DEN MONKEY BALLS ($9.95): There are about 8 pieces of deep fried mushrooms with spicy tuna topped with their special house sauce. This is a great appetizer, and perfectly fried to a crisp without being too heavy or salty. + HOT STONE BIBIMBAP ($12.95): We tried their Korean beef, which is topped with plenty of traditional Korean marinated vegetables and a sunny side fried egg. The beef was tender and full of flavor, there was variety and plenty of vegetables, and the egg was perfectly fried. Because of the hot stone bowl, the rice was extremely crunchy at the bottom too! ~ BENTO (CHICKEN KARAAGE): Their bento options come with a bed of rice, Japanese pickles & veggies, and choice of protein. The chicken karaage was perfectly fried in a ginger garlic coating with very tender chicken. I wish there was as much variety in this option as the bibimbap!
