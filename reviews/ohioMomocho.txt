The real stars of the meal for me were the guac sampler (definitely a must order) and the queso.  I was pleasantly surprised that neither of these items, nor the chips for that matter, were overly salted.  I want to note that we had one of the friendliest and helpful servers (without being intrusive and over the top) that I can recall.  I can't remember his name, but props to him for being a genuinely nice dude."}, {"review_id": "iiuuWCQjyCe-_llO8rd5Bg", "user_id": "5zIJVK5kjp40GBa0sUXlWQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "I really wanted to love this place. The space is  quaint and cozy and perfect for a quick bite or drink. The three stars are only for the atmosphere and cucumber margarita. The food and service left a lot to be desired. During my first visit on an uncrowded weekday night, the weight staff hastily took our drink order without asking our preference for sugar/salt (they offer various toppings for rims.) It was disappointing to receive a fight of margs clean rimmed.The food was mediocre at best. We started with guac (which was tasty) but the pineapple \"salsa\" tasted like chopped canned pineapple, and the chicken tamale had not only a human hair, but also unidentifiable chicken parts -- something I didn't realize until I warmed up leftovers the next day. Not sure I'll be back anytime soon; not for dinner anyway."}, {"review_id": "HShFwY_biCFexIpFOCvCig", "user_id": "YkZarGOu8P9r3ISxya_BIA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Yum! Taco. This is a great place to come for Happy hour. Be sure to get there early because there's often people waiting when it opens. And there's not much room to wait in the front, so you might have to wait outside in the cold. We arrived a little after 5pm on a Friday with a group of 6, and we were able to be seated right away. Happy hour here is awesome. It's $5 margaritas, $2 tecate, half off taquitos, and probably a few other things that I forgot. The margaritas a big and they pack a punch! The fun thing is they have a few different types of salt you can put on the rim. We tried the chili lime salt (tastes like a seasoning you would put on tortilla chips) and Hawaiian black lava salt with freeze dried ants (yes, ants like the bug! They're ground up so you don't see legs or anything). Both were okay, people probably liked the ants more than the chili lime. The taquitos are like mini make it yourself tacos. A small plate of meat comes with two different kinds of sauces and 5 mini soft tortillas. You can ask for more tortillas if you run out. I really like the shrimp and duck, but they're all delicious! They're big enough to make a meal out of, but we usually like to share a few taquitos and also get some guacamole."}, {"review_id": "Cjie6aR15wEqFAIyZbzCjQ", "user_id": "haT-IuuJcLbpTuG_tqwn_w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "We made reservations at Momocho for my birthday dinner, as it came highly recommended by two of my friends. We were seated upstairs at a romantic table. The whole place is quite small, but cozy and inviting. We wanted a relaxing dining experiences, hoping to take our time. We started with margaritas. I got the classic, which was excellent, and my husband ordered the mango margarita. He liked it but I thought it was a bit sweet. We ordered the guacamole sampler, which was very generous in portion size. My favorite was the goat cheese guacamole - who would have that would be so delicious? We split the shrimp tacos for an entree. So why the four stars and not five? Our server was not particularly attentive. Although we did want a relaxed dining experience, after we ordered our guacamole, she did not come back to the table and we had to ask another server to get her attention. Probably would have ordered more had we had better service. Regardless, it would be worth visiting again."}, {"review_id": "05qknKS85yxedTHFzFV2-g", "user_id": "JYY4nIwYIVHDFZm5mdw-5g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "I'm a self proclaimed taco expert and I have to say I'm a big fan of Momocho. The only downfall is the small location, wait times here can be a pain so if you're planning on heading there on a weekend I would be sure to call ahead! Good news is that they've recently renovated so there's now more room upstairs. I was intrigued by their list of interesting margarita flavors, so naturally I had to order the sampler. I tasted the spicy mango, blood orange, and pomegranate! All three were excellent but the spicy mango was next level - this would probably be my go-to on a return visit. I'm a fan of all things spicy, but this drink only had a hint so anyone could probably handle the heat! The taquitos are divine and the serving sizes look small but both times I've been I've struggled to finish because the portions are so hearty. We dug in to the carnitas and the machaca and I don't have a bad thing to say about either dish. I was hesitant to order the machaca because coffee braised beef sounded intimidating but it ended up being my favorite. We also had the crab guacamole which was great but I would love to try some of the other flavors. Momocho doesn't disappoint and it's a popular spot for a reason!"}, {"review_id": "Gy7uQNKyfTR11kga4ID7Ng", "user_id": "lB_inWGuc-lnIPVBHyfZJQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "On Saturday, my fiancé, her best friend and I went to Momocho for dinner.

Hands down, this is the coolest and most drool worthy taqueria in the city. When I went with my dude, we put ourselves on a super long waiting list, and I was hangry to say the least. We walked around the neighborhood for approximately 10 minutes, came back, and the hostess ran out and told us they snagged a seat for us. I was beyond grateful. We get in there, and the ambiance was so trendy. The bar is so lavish and cool, I didn't feel worthy to sit at it. We ordered the smoke trout guacamole, he ordered the beef tongue tacos, and I ordered the al pastor tacos. You can add an egg to any plate too, which is so convenient, because I love eggs on EVERYTHING. I wanted more after eating the entire meal, that's how great it was.

If you're from out of town like us, it was fun talking about places around town to check out.The dining pace is slower because the chef IS ALSO your server but you take more time to enjoy your food.Cons:Essentially all of the pros can be made into cons depending on your mood.You may night want to see the chefs work if you have issues about how your food is made.   You may see something that surprises you.If you're not in the mood for small talk throughout dinner, this is not the seat for you.If you're in a hurry this is not the seat for you.We enjoyed it as a special occasion thing when we do, and I recommend people trying it once.Aside from the Chefs Table, overall the food here is AMAZING.  The guacamole is fantastic and they have like 6 different flavor to choose from.  The goat cheese is my favorite.I got the tempura fried Chile relleno and almost died when I ate the first bite because it was so good. The previous year I got the Remolacha taquitos which were fantastic !  Also try the blistered shishito peppers as an app!We were too full to try the desserts (except for the complimentary flan for my birthday) but the fried ice cream looked awesome.  Downtown Ohio city is a very short walk too, to help walk off the enormous amount of food you're sure to eat!"}, {"review_id": "P_RQv2lYe74ZKlLprJSXyw", "user_id": "gkBgWDlx6eYMq_ot9FBxeQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "Wow!My Daughter told me to hit this place, on our recent trip through from Buffalo.

Momocho has a great environment (it has a really modern feel though the restaurant is definitely on the darker side haha), and the employees who work here are incredibly friendly and helpful with the menu. I wasn't sure what taquitos were, but our server did a great job explaining these to us - basically, they give you your guacamole/meat with a side of soft corn tortillas and you build your own roll/taco things. I ended up getting the pescado taquitos. The mahi mahi was soft and cooked deliciously, and the pineapple guacamole made for a unique sweet and savory dish! I also had the margarita and sangria here, which were both sweet, tasty drinks. You can also pick the rim you want for your margarita - they have salt, sugar, vanilla salt, chili-lime salt, or you can also go without a rim.Overall, I'm so happy to have discovered this place. It may be a bit out of the way for me, but I had a great time here, and I can see myself coming back here when I'm looking for some solid Mexican food! The deals are pretty great for happy hour, I would try to make it out during those hours if you can. Otherwise, I'm such an indecisive person, I definitely would like to come back and try their guacamole and margarita samplers in the future :)"}, {"review_id": "r7HcyZ7HqP8zIqPyos_ZXg", "user_id": "Jv2W0ho85soOfV5jOJQGBg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "It was better the 1st Time I was there.  The food was o.k.,  the service was great.  Portions not the biggest but the atmosphere and setting were nice."}, {"review_id": "uwjEFJllsqCKc5jSi0N8Zw", "user_id": "GPDskOvUTkPu6FynM1KP3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2017", "text": "Momochofication complete.  I finally see what the kids are talking about.  As others have extolled, by the end of your stay at this upmarket modern Mex establishment, you will already be planning your next visit.  They have, by far, one of the most generous happy hours in the area.  $5 margaritas, served smooth and balanced in tall glasses.  Half price on all of their taquitos plates--not those greasy fried tortilla cigar-shaped things, but actual petite sized soft corn tortillas served in a stack with accompanying fillings and sauces for you to assemble.  You could easily make a hearty meal out of a taquitos plate alone.  The rules for these special deals are that you must dine on the first floor, between 5:00-6:30pm, Tuesday-Friday.  You should definitely make a reservation (people were lined up outside to get in right at 5pm) and don't be late, or they may give your table away.  Every step of the meal reads quality and generous portions.  Tortilla chips come out warm and perfectly salted.  Guacamole is mounded high into the serving cup and deliciously nuanced with whatever flavors you've chosen (the smokiness of the trout add-in was a surprising hit for me).  In the camarones taquitos, sweet plump shrimp have a garlicky edge.  The smoked gouda tamale dumplings are little flavor bombs.I will continue to dream about this food until the next time I can schlep back to Ohio City.  This is one of my favorite restaurant experiences in Cleveland."}, {"review_id": "ibVBnexqFsF1ZTd4siIztA", "user_id": "fSP4q0CMwpYDyBXpRNnYqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/24/2017", "text": "Guacamole, salsa, and margarita flights - it's my Mexican dream come true!

With 5 or 6 types each, gotta do the samplers. Combinations of the salty cream goat cheese or the aromatic pecorino were nicely mixed with fluffy, creamy bowls of avocado. The assemble-your-own taquitos (not the  tex-mex rolled, deep-fried variety) were inconsistent among them (shrimp was a bit too saucy, tongue was chewier than even tongue should be). Beet and spinach was a flavor highlight with roasted beet and cheese and mixed well with the just-right moist taco-size corn tortillas and salsa verde (fresh bright herbs and a slight heat). Portion size overall was smaller than expected for the pricing. Think medium sized tapas plates.Service/atmosphere: Service was great. We were seated early by very friendly, professional and thoughtful staff (from host, to bartender to table staff). Really a top service experience. The upstairs room is quieter, but at peak time still got louder for quiet conversation. Nothing unusual, but got a little hard to hear everyone at even a small table."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/momocho-cleveland-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
