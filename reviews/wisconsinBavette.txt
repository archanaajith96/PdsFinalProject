We shared the Steak Tartare, and I ordered the Prime Rib sandwich, while she ordered the Cubano sandwich. The Steak Tartare was beautiful first and foremost, and it was also delicious. Not quite as rich as I expected, just really well executed and served with perfectly toasted crostini.My prime rib sandwich was an add to the menu for that day, so I took advantage of the opportunity, and it didn't disappoint. Nothing fancy about it, just tender and delicious cuts of meat served on a brioche bun, and it came with a bag of kettle chips. I remember on my first visit many years ago, the chips cost extra. So I've got that going for me. LOL!I love this place, and now it will be harder to get into, since Chef Karen Bell was named a Finalist for the James Beard Award for Best Chef in the Midwest. It's well deserved, and I love seeing how this business has grown and developed from my first visit to my most recent visit.There are a dozens of things on the menu that I would love to order, but there are only so many opportunities to dine out, so how about 30 of us go there together and order one of everything and each take a bite. Then when the menu changes, we can do it again. Deal?"}, {"review_id": "7ay4dfqx7MEMmPYS3nMdVQ", "user_id": "iwL_Kz0WVgTW4BFMohy80w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Bavette is a great place to stop in for lunch in the Third Ward. It's end cap spot even makes the dreaded parking in this area tolerable. When you first walk in, you're greeted by a case of fresh meats and the wafting, lovely smell of what I can only describe as bacon.If you're headed in for lunch I would plan on two things. 1 - make a reservation as there are only a handful of tables indoors and they fill of fast. 2. This isn't your 45 minutes and scoot Applebee's lunch - this food is  make fresh and takes more time to prepare. If you have to be somewhere - give yourself about an 1:15-1:30 hours for lunch. The interior is decorated what I would call a modern rustic. Gold deer stencils on the wall sunken into a teal blue background - the tables are heavy butcher block style. The walls are decorated with very unique pieces of art.Every meal I've had here is beautiful and delicious. I've taken a strong liking to the Mediterranean style salad with garbanzo beans and baba ganoush. Prices are reasonable for fresh and large portions.You're doing great Bavette - keep it up!"}, {"review_id": "pWMc6KxmLnBPgbw7546JuA", "user_id": "O8QinIvzaCKTvawdxkaf0Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Been wanting to try Bavette since it opened.Finally got to try it last night!! Great friendly service that left us to our own too when needed. We got seated in the back near the bathrooms, which apparently some people don't like. We didn't mind, it was quieter and close to the bathroom--perfect for when you need to use it. The place is clean so no offense there at all.My friend and I decided to share some plate, as we usually do. We wanted to try the Chili Fish Sauce Caramel Chicken Wings with Cashew but they were out. Instead we switched for Bresaola (made in house) with Black Olive Tapenade & Parmesan. Smoked Trout with Beets, Citrus, Pickled sun chokes, Fennel & Avocado Green Goddess. Finally, we ordered the Steak Tartare with Chimichurri & Harissa. This was accompanied by their made in house Gin & Tonic. We finished the meal with the Nutella Bread Pudding with Chocolate.A perfectly delicious and satisfying meal! Lots to choose from that is overly a good price and deliciousssss!!!"}, {"review_id": "DYYDEijNLh4ByGWw_C2G_g", "user_id": "wqF8xUF7TBPfIu8d1hDVTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Wow. I was blown away by this place - it's a butcher shop as well as restaurant, in a cute location in the Third Ward. The butcher items are all local, and pricey, so we haven't tried. The restaurant was amazing though. They had a selection of $5 wines for their 5 year anniversary, and I tried both the rose and red blend, so good. The food was the real standout. We started with soft pretzels with a shallot cream - so good. The pretzels were soft and glazed with butter, and the shallot cream was delectable. We also shared the mushroom schnitzel and the steak, goat cheese, and avocado sandwich, and both were so good! This place is reasonably priced too, with entrees and sandwiches priced around $15. I am so excited to try this place again!"}, {"review_id": "oG8jsONY7SuthYDpcaE86g", "user_id": "Cls75x5zB0uihJYX6_Lofw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "After moving to Milwaukee, I've been keeping an eye out for our next charcuterie place. We finally wandered down to the Third Ward to check this place out on a Friday night for dinner. Didn't think we needed to consider reservations, but luckily there was a place at the bar. Immediate impression of a very open concept, hip, modernized butcher shop/restaurant! There's just so much to look at-- from the Shop list written out on butcher paper up on the wall, to the decor, to watching the staff do their thang. We had really great service!Onto the food... Oh my goodness. I don't think I could bring any vegetarian friends here because that would just be indecent (they do have 3 vegetarian salads, but I personally don't count cold option only for vegetarian friendly). There are so many delicious meat options. But we came for drinks and charcuterie! The board was damn beautiful! My DH and I also split an order of sweet potato fry & beef poutine, which was decent. There are so many interesting options for sandwiches that I'd go back to try. Overall, a perfect place for drinks and cured meats!"}, {"review_id": "NQbD6_ndvKB0JniudQLHig", "user_id": "4qYuZmlndclYBVy7o_xokg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "Ended up going here for lunch one day and it was nice.

I ordered the smoked-trout, deviled eggs to start, which were perfect - with a nice light filling and thinly-sliced smoked trout that was just enough to flavor the dish but not enough to overpower it. For my main meal, I had the beef tongue reuben, which was the real standout. This was my first time having beef tongue, so I have nothing to compare it to but BOY was it good. Tender and juicy! Just don't let it fall out of the sandwich or you'll be able to tell what you're actually eating.

From the artsy wall decor, to its industrial facade of deli equipment right up behind the counter, to the very cool Produce List presented on this HUGE rolled sheet ala toilet paper :), this place exudes a very modern take on minimalism !! Pair that with a rather energetic location to call it home, the whole scene fits a young and vibrant concept.Food : So their staples seems to be salads and sandwiches which on the outset screams your average Panera Bread (Not a bad thing though at all). But here's where the similarity ends. The unique and upmarket ingredients used, the quality and freshness of said ingredients, the complex flavor profile matching is what makes this place unconventional. For lunch we ordered the Bahn Mi (With Chicken) and Braised beef sandwiches. Let's start with the Bahn Mi. I love Bahn Mi and cant imagine anyone who doesn't. But unfortunately they ran out of Pork Belly so we had to \"settle\" for little ol Chicken. And boy were we in for a surprise! The chicken was beautifully cooked and had a Curry flavor to it that worked like symphony with the aioli and pickled veggies. The spice from the chicken dancing to the tangy tunes of pickles was music to our belly's! The beef sandwich was served like a burger on what seemed like a well made brioche bun. The meat was cooked medium rare and thankfully had a great fat component to it to get that melt in your mouth result! Now this was my first time trying a duxelle pairing with kale and roasted onions and get this...GRAPES! On paper, it should not work because of the sheer number of flavor profiles all vying for your attention. But IT DID!! The duxelle did not overpower the beef, the kale was not bitter and gave a crunch to the sandwich, the onions lent a smoky aftertaste and that spice was balanced by the sweetness from the grapes. A very very interesting melody and one I have to suggest you try it for yourself!Both dishes were paired with this exquisite side of  fingerling potatoes mixed with a light onion and tomato dressing. A very refreshing balance to the savory sandwiches.And how you can be done with such a dynamic meal without an equally dynamic dessert! Say hello to Butterscotch pudding (And he faints..)!! I've never had a Butterscotch anything with this level of intensity of the flavor. Holy heavens of sweet, such an incredible and almost alcoholic impact the moment you taste it. The caramel pairing on it was so perfect that it intensified that flavor even further. It's a good thing then that it's served with a dollop of whipped cream to get you down on planet earth :)If you've stayed till here then you probably know my next thought. You have to try this joint, like now!!"}, {"review_id": "g49ZinIg0Tps9fRCvjKWjA", "user_id": "TWhhzClV_TMiHuC4EPYv3g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Neat little restaurant / meat shop.  High quality stuff on the meat side.  Stuff is expensive but fair based on quality of product.   Interior is modern and clean.  Good drink menu.   Definitely worth checking out."}, {"review_id": "Sa64yBlEWH0iTmXvxgDp0w", "user_id": "0CX0RSoz8NkPlOTo7Ckqdg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/20/2017", "text": "The first time we went to Bavette was for a beer pairing dinner. They featured Boulevard brewing from KC and it was one of the best pairing dinners I've ever had--and was also one of the least expensive. I couldn't leave a review based on that, though, since it wasn't their typical menu. I've eaten there twice since and have to say they have my favorite sandwiches in the city! Seriously, so delicious. For one of our visits, we started with the steak taretar, which was fresh and perfectly seasoned (very lightly). I love chimichurri, so I always could use a bit more than what's included. The salad was big and well-balanced. Really great flavors throughout and nothing was bunched together so that we had to do any mixing or spreading out at the table--just dug in with our forks and couldn't stop 'til it was gone! I had the bahn mi. Great blend of flavors, really well done. I lived in Asia and have visited Viet Nam and have had some good bahn mi in the past--this is the best I've had Stateside!I'm also obsessed with Cuban sandwiches (thinking about it now with the bahn mi and Cubans I suppose I like that mean n pickle taste). We had that as well, it was very good. We also had bean salad and fruit salad as sides. Seriously, everything was on point.The one gripe one might have is that pricing is a little high. $12 for a sandwich is a little steep, but when you taste them and know that the meat is locally sourced and not from some scary big farm in Brazil with who knows what kind of conditions, it suddenly becomes so worth it.

I took my boyfriend's mom (from out of town) here for lunch, actually per recommendation from a host at Morel (another restaurant I absolutely love). I wanted to show off my superb restaurant picking skills and that Milwaukee does have bomb eats. Bavette did not disappoint. We had a reservation for the early afternoon on a Saturday, and it didn't seem to be needed as it was probably half full. We started off with the charcuterie plate. I couldn't tell you which meats were on it, but the three selections we had were fantastic. It also came with these little jam cubes (maybe apricot flavor?) that were so sweet and yummy. My bf's mom ordered the roasted carrots with garbanzos, baba ghanoush, dates, olives, feta &  pistachio dukkah salad and I ordered the roasted cauliflower & grape salad with pickled pepper vinaigrette, almonds & parmesan salad with the sausage, white bean & kale soup with parmesan. Honestly, I could have probably done without the soup because they give you a generous serving of salad. I had so much arugula that I couldn't even finish it all. I was curious as to how cauliflower and grapes could go together, but they were in perfect harmony in my salad. The soup was simple yet so savory and light. I'd probably opt out of the parmesan for next time since it didn't feel necessary. My bf's mom's salad was an absolute dream, the baba ghanoush was wonderful texturally and the flavors really shined.I am definitely coming back to try the other items on their menu. Bavette, you can bet on my recommendation any time."}, {"review_id": "nZDawR2P-II1QSjaVN0gHA", "user_id": "Yeyz7FOasUzDNquLWi3kUQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "I take three elderly friends of mine out to a new Milwaukee Restaurant about three times a year.  Bavette's was the 12th restaurant in what we call our \"Dinner Adventures Tour\".  We loved it!  We loved it!  Just outstanding food, service, ambiance, and vibe.  But let me give  a BIG shout out to our the young lady who waited on our table.

The place has some seating outside, tables inside, and a bar that overlooks the food prep area, and we decided to sit at the latter of those options. The menu is nice and compact; cheese and charcuterie, salads, larger plates, sandwiches, soup, and desserts. It isn't too large, but it does have more options than other places I have been to that I would compare this to. Everything on the menu is unique, and they certainly take on the modern gastropub approach to food. While I was surprised by some of the options on the menu, I was more surprised they prices were all reasonable. I seemed like everything was about $12-$15, and we were each full after one dish. They advertise a farm to fork approach, and it is cool to see them take meat out of their butcher shop display to use in the food they are cooking. Their sides were all fresh and very flavorful. I got the beef tongue reuben, and it was delicious. The meat melted in your mouth, and the spicy sauerkraut had a nice kick that balanced out the rich protein. I had perused Yelp before visiting this place and saw numerous pictures of things I saw that looked delicious, but a lot of them were not on the menu anymore, so they obviously change their menu quite often. We only glanced at the display of fresh and cured meats, cheeses, and other deli items that they had on display, but they all looked delicious. Their extensive list of products is up on the wall with prices. The service was fantastic, and their crew is a nice mix of professional and outgoing. For delicious, fresh, and inventive food choices in a bright and spacious setting, I've never been anywhere that can top this place. I would certainly come back here if I find myself in Milwaukee again."}, {"review_id": "Pa5lPIp7jgppXkXjVXTm6Q", "user_id": "wekoBbbxJz2GRTepRnDsfw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2017", "text": "We are from Chicago and have a buddy in milwaukee who speaks very highly of bavette with frequency., so going in our expectations were pretty high and bavette did not disappoint. our server lisa was so helpful and adorable and put up with all our annoying questions which stemmed from us wanting to try every single thing on the menu because it all sounded so amazing. we ordered pretty heavily for 3 people (half portion of soup, trout deviled eggs, sauerkraut pancakes, 3 sandwiches) but also ate all of all of it. the prawn bisque and the corned beef tongue reuben were the stars of the show. don't be freaked out by tongue because you probably wouldn't even know if  the menu didn't say! i was a little sad they didn't have all the apps that i'd seen on yelp (lamb heart carpaccio  and chicken livers) but I fully appreciate that menus change seasonally and that everything wouldn't be exactly the same. we loved it so much we left with t-shirts and honestly might take the train up just to eat here again!"}, {"review_id": "t-ZnlDa_WIm_pDmEfHlIPw", "user_id": "KqYPw_V3OFNcoU9lhSeA5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/18/2017", "text": "Bavette's meat is outstanding, but they are as fluent in veggie as any restaurant.

If you've never had pickled kohlrabi, do yourself a favor and get it here. They cut it into thin sheets, either with a mandolin or very precise knife technique, which made for the perfect amount of crunch.As far as the sandwiches go, they're exceptional. Don't let the beef tongue scare you, their reuben is terrific, and it's a good introduction to one of the most underrated parts of a cow.

I went on a week night and ordered a meat plate as well as the pork belly bahn mi. Maybe this was my mistake for not ordering the right thing, but I just didn't love it. I thought the pork belly in it was great, but the toppings/sauces/seasoning on the sandwich to make it a Vietnamese style were lacking. The meat plate was tasty but I felt that there was much more bread/crackers/other toppings compared to meat on the plate. I know that this is normal but I would have loved to have just a touch more of each of the selected meats on the plate to even things out. That being said, my boyfriend had the sweet potato poutine (I believe that is what it was called) and it was so yummy! I personally wish that I had ordered that myself! I also think that if I go on burger night again, I will order one of their burgers -- They looked pretty delicious when coming out to other tables. The staff was nice but slow (especially on refilling drinks/water). We were at a table outside, though, so that may have delayed the process a bit.
