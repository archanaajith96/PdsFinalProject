This is real food, with good quality ingredients at a fair price to boot. A friend recommended this place when we had moved local, and when we finally tried it I told my wife I'd drive an hour for this sandwich!"}, {"review_id": "gLq-iBJE5Mdd2r_0elpskA", "user_id": "7pxNh0wYVimPR9Bmr1Bziw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to give this place a try maybe 4 months ago and we were pleasantly surprised at how good the sandwiches were. Authentic Italian ingredients, inexpensive, and wonderful customer service. Today we went again, pleased to see the same lovely woman, but surprised to hear that the place had been sold to a younger guy who was there learning to use the register (to say it was his 2nd day would be a stretch). We were told the menu would not be changed, but even today upon returning home and trying my sandwich, the quality is PLUMMETING.

Newer to the area and was craving a good old Italian sandwich. I had been to Mirabella's earlier in the week and to say it was awful is putting it mild so when I drove by and saw a small sign for this place I decided to stop in. I got a raging bull for my husband and the Italian stallion for us to split to go. I had a hunch it would be good when I saw the owner making the buffalo sauce for the raging bull from scratch... got home and WOW!! The sandwiches were amazing. On the Italian stallion the meat was so fresh, the dressing light but full of flavor, thick fresh slices of mozzarella... it was to die for. The bread they make these sandwiches on melts in your mouth, soft on the inside with a nice crust on the outside. My husband loved his sandwich, he said he wished he had another one for work for lunch. This place is a gem! The owner (I believe) was super nice when I went in and had patience as I read the description of every sandwich. Can't wait to go back and try more! Highly highly recommend!!"}, {"review_id": "hrzAoho3shLFxKSpT1oMPg", "user_id": "6zktXAC4Hx9pw389dyO3MA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/24/2017", "text": "I would say this place is just OK .The panini I had was relatively small with only 2 slices of Turkey and a couple broken peices of bacon along with very little lettuce.  The taste was good but between taking 20 minutes (it was empty) and the cost the value is just not there. At a price of $9.75 there are much better lunch places.

Anthony's is at the end of a mediocre strip mall and the restaurant sign is a faded mess, but once you go in and see the menu you realize that you can't always judge a place by its exterior. The food is absolutely fantastic - my Italian Stallion was comprised of sausage, fried eggplant, banana peppers, red peppers (and something else I think)...all on a large crusty loaf of bread. I also had the pasta fagioli and it was equally delicious. My wife had an Italian (they have a lot of different variations) and my wife said it was fantastic.We spoke with the owner and he said that he goes to the market almost every morning to buy his inventory as he's very picky about what he selects and wants to make sure everything is fresh and up to his standards. The next time I'm in the area you can be certain that I will stop in.

It has roasted red peppers and rabe and the meat is so tender. I love rabe in sandwiches but oftentimes it's watery and makes a mess...not here! --------------------------------------------------------------------------I went here today for the first time after seeing it multiple times on yelp and reading all the good reviews.My husband and I stopped in for lunch sandwiches to go. He got the Milano and I got the Venetian. We both agreed the bread was awesome...just chewy enough and it didn't crumble all over the place. My sandwich, which consisted of capicola, soppresatta, sharp provalone, and a mixed olive salad, was delicious. The olives were more of an actual component rather than a condiment-type afterthought...there were tons of them! They could have used a bit more meat, though, for the $7 price. My husband's sandwich- prosciutto, mozzarella, tomato, basil, and olive oil- was good although the prosciutto they used was very different from the Parma prosciutto we're both used to. It was cut much thicker and didn't have as much of a cured flavor. Still tasty, just not as expected.It was hard for me to choose my sandwich because they all sounded so good. I definitely want to try more!This spot is tucked so far back in the plaza that it's invisible from the road and the sign isn't particularly large or eye-catching. I've lived here for 5 years and do all my shopping at the neighboring Stop and Shop and I.M. Gan's liquor store and never once noticed it. I couldn't believe it'd been there this whole time when I finally decided to find it today!Anyway...definitely worth it!

But not here they took the chicken and it was grilled it had that nice smoky flavor to it and there was a touch of black olive. So after eating half of that sandwich I then tried the Italian and it was fresh nice cuts  of soppressata, capicola , prosciutto A medley of olives and spice with a touch of olive oil. Anthony has the bread made freshly at a local bakery just for the deli. I just found out that they do a Wednesday night BYOB ($2 fee pp) but that will unfortunately be ending soon for the summa and will begin again in the fall. If you live in Eastern Cranston, Warwick North or South Providence side try Anthony's.PS the people were great!Pss try the sandwiches with a bold red wine!"}, {"review_id": "l_Pk0HeiDQD2P-EWa8ABBQ", "user_id": "0ruZdeni0-7AUw8nvRE46w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/1/2016", "text": "Starting a new job close by and not sure where to get good lunch.....until I found Anthony's.
