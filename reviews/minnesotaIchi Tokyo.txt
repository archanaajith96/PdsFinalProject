I don't recall that ever happening before. The lunch buffet is a solid deal for $16.99, especially if you eat a lot.  There is a specific list of appetizers, hibachi meals, and sushi, which is available for the lunch buffet specials.  There are also non-buffet lunch specials.  The sushi & appetizers were all decent.  Nothing spectacular, but I got full, and definitely got my money's worth.  The smoked salmon was my favorite.  For the dinner buffet, I know more sushi options are available.  The service was a little on the slow side.  I've been to AYCE sushi places before with faster service, even with a large crowd.  It took awhile to get waited on, and I was the 1st person in the restaurant for lunch.I also think it's kind of lame that you can only order 3 rolls at once.  Especially if one pays, as a customer, for uneaten sushi.  I understand why it is done though.  People will probably get tired of waiting for refill orders, so they in return will leave."}, {"review_id": "WU4oRv0J-pyHenvEGW_Ubw", "user_id": "qZeX1ZZkN7DXk10keuGOhg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Like others have said, you won't expect to find such great food in an unassuming strip mall, but Ichi Tokyo will surprise you.If you can't make up your mind, the Bento Box Dinner (or lunch) will let you try a little of everything. They actually do a great job with the batter and frying of the vegetable tempura. The chicken I ordered with my bento box was marinated well and tender. The gyoza dumplings were filled with pork, delicious without being decadent. The bowl of noodles comes with either ramen or soba noodles. I must say it was the least impressive of all the dishes. The broth itself was bland, as were the vegetables in the soup. Perhaps it fell short of our expectations because we were envisioning more of a bowl of ramen with a spicy broth that was rich in flavors, which this wasn't.Service was great, and it was almost full on the weekday night we were there, so clearly this place is a go-to for many people!"}, {"review_id": "UygkoDPHuuHwCqAKH3TUpA", "user_id": "xCExmgwp4kPCkCQI8QMGww", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "Sushi is good for Rochester but below average for a real city.rice isn't cooked properly, which is a pretty grave sushi-sin if you ask me.

Even when my cousins and I were first getting into sushi, this place was always the best - all thanks to their delicious volcano roll. I've tried several rolls including the new crazy, Rochester, and American dream rolls. All delicious! Both locations have beautiful decor. Very modern, but still has a cozy vibe.

Ichi Tokyo is 10/10 would recommend."}, {"review_id": "WBmRTBknfmhjnsNxQPWFRg", "user_id": "qCFECCxKq0pqJcwQ18IdXQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "Some of the tastiest Sushi I've ever had!

What drew me to this location was the 15.99 all you can eat sushi lunch. This is a great deal for Sushi anywhere in the nation. The general setup of this location is average (in a strip mall) and the seating seems rather crowded. The service was actually great but I was rather unimpressed by the Sushi. The Sushi for some odd reason did not seem fresh. I am not sure if I came on the wrong day or what the situation was, but I was not impressed. Even with the 3 (average) rating I again was impressed with the service and will give it another shot."}, {"review_id": "DW5oqMzGNwmLN2Bl83icVw", "user_id": "btdMwcbzwNPbsCcI-cLl4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/26/2017", "text": "The best all-you-can-eat sushi in SE MN! For $15.99 (lunch), you can get unlimited made to order rolls, sashimi, appetizers, dessert - you name it. It's one of the better lunch deals in town, as everything is fresh, tasty, and affordable. I personally love the shrimp tempura, salmon teriyaki, and yellowtail and spicy tuna rolls. Staff is accommodating and water is refilled often. You really can't find much better in Rochester (or anywhere in MN that's not the Twin Cities). Highly recommend for families and sushi lovers!"}, {"review_id": "cjrVkgOJNt8Ny1BUDh240Q", "user_id": "ZyCVSXpVWUpYxxD8XxjtGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/23/2017", "text": "Larger than it appears from the outside.

Unfortunately, if you are from anywhere outside of the Midwest you will be able to call this place out on their horrible sushi with a premium price.

This particular location on south Broadway is definitely worth a visit if you're a sushi fan. Inside you'll find well organized and comfortable dining hall with extra long booths for large groups. My first sushi order to most new places is always sashimi because it gives you a sense of the quality of fish being used. The sashimi platter is 12 pieces of chef choice cuts with a side of rice. I fortunately got salmon, tuna, white tuna, and red snapper - some of my favorites. The salmon was definitely the best of the bunch, an excellent fatty cut full of rich flavor. The tuna cuts were quite lean but nevertheless still very good. Last place was the white tuna cuts, which we lean and not very flavorful. I don't think I can entirely blame them for this as white tuna is pretty mild to begin with. Service was excellent and pretty quick despite a busy Friday evening. Presentation was what I expected given the prices. Prices were definitely higher than I expected but I guess its hard to get fresh fish into Rochester. If there were partial stars I'd give this a 4.5. I'll definitely be back to let them earn my 5-stars!"}, {"review_id": "hug3kv98bsUOR3zjwG7rxw", "user_id": "IyMzu9KX9kxqCEkAlCKrpg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2017", "text": "I think this place made me fall in love with sushi ^_^ . I went to Ichi Tokyo twice this month because I couldn't get over Rochester sushi rolls. While taste is ultimately what matters but so the presentation. The food presentation here is always wow me !!  I recently came back for mango dragon sushi, the presentation was on !! point!! . I can't wait to comeback to try different rolls. Food at a reasonable price for me ( the taste of food is worth of my money). However I disliked the fried rice, just looked plain. Hopefully the restaurant can improve fried rice (add colors by adding more vegetables) . Also I used their carry-out food service. Call them and order 15 mins before you come to pick ur food so you don't have to wait.
