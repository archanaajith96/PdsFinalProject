It seems like this dish now comes with three crisps instead of how it previously came with two. ALOT more tuna tartare per crisp as well. Who can complain when you are getting more food than you actually had expected right?I tried the French Onion soup dumplings for the first time, and while the soup was delicious and cheesy, the dumplings themselves were super chewy. I had to basically eat around most of them. Overall would definitely come back, next time I want to try the eggs benedict!"}, {"review_id": "Q0FF5J2xhmSOCrx5fswCFA", "user_id": "BsaVcojJce-cUeaglIb9yA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Really disappointed to be writing this review. I've heard a lot about this place throughout my time in JC and i thought I'd finally give it a shot. Service was subpar, I had drinks at the bar prior to sitting down and the gentleman who helped me was very apathetic and hard to get a hold of when I wanted to pay. After moving to the table we ordered a lot of food which was all decent, nothing exceptional though. Our server, though sweet was equally inattentive.I had to walk towards the back where she was rolling silverware to pay.Not worth it."}, {"review_id": "yLZl7OX4NNL9Nbac3H7bPg", "user_id": "CcNJAGO6c85gC-5PDGKHmw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "My fiancè and i always pass by this place and decided to try it out for dinner this time. Walking in, we noticed it was a Cute place, with a nice ambience - low lighting w tealight candles at each table. There was no host in the front, so we looked to some of the employees to at least let the host know were waiting. They made eye contact with us and no one moved. Finally, when the host arrived, we were seated. Looking at the menu, i didnt expect for most of it to be sandwiches. There wasnt much entree choices. I dont know if they had dinner specials as they were not offered to us. So we just went with what they had on the menu.Appetizer: Truffled Egg Pizza $15... \"Sunny side egg, panchetta, spinach & mozz on pizza dough\". This was really good... egg was cooked well, crispy crust, oozy cheese and quite tasty. Since this was good, expectations were high for the main course.His order: The Inn Burger $12... \"100% Organic, brioche bun w Fries\". He wanted it cooked medium. Its a burger. Simple enough... how can they mess it up? When it arrived, at first sight.. it wasnt on a brioche bun, instead it was a sesame seed bun. The bun was very dry and a bit stale, so if it WAS a brioche bun, we couldnt tell. The Meat wasnt cooked as ordered... his burger was cooked medium well to pretty much well. He complained of the outside being burnt and \"charcoal-y\".  Needless to say, he barely ate his order.His extra side order: Mac n Cheese $9... tasted and looked like box mac n cheese topped with some grated cheese to make it look \"made from scratch\". It was bland and watery. My order: Salmon $27 ... \"Salmon w Butternut squash risotto & pumpkin seed oil\". When the dish arrived, all i noticed was a whole lot of risotto and a singular, piece of salmon that looked dry on top. The risotto was cooked well, but it couldve gone without the pumpkin seed oil. The salmon was okay... a bit over cooked, but still edible.All in all, we rated the foods taste (with the exception of the appetizer) and presentation was quite underwhelming. As you can see in the pictures, we didnt finish a good amount of our meal. It was definitley not worth the almost $80 check. The only reason we gave it 2 stars was for the appetizer and our waitress's good service."}, {"review_id": "zTy3EeZvxxXyBwlP0MnGAw", "user_id": "QVnWHK7Hgu2N86u-7q7qyA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Genuinely, anyone who gives this place more than 3 stars hasn't eaten at a normal restaurant or any place beyond a suburban diner.I lived in the city for 12 years, and have lived in Jersey city for a few.  There are some great restaurants in Jersey City.  Unfortunately, Hamilton inn isn't one of them. I live very close by and have given it 4 or 5 tries giving them the benefit of the doubt maybe they've just had an off day.No. The staff here just literally can't cook. I should have known when they asked me \"how would I liked my turkey burger cooked\"? Perhaps - cooked? Nearly everytime I'm there they've run out of several menu items (usually what I'm ordering) - and the servers never seem to know upfront.  Even basic bar food, like nachos, is bad. I'm giving it two stars purely because the space itself is cute and there is a semi decent bar.  But it is a horrible restaurant."}, {"review_id": "as_cSxT7mvGCzLmIoTNqMA", "user_id": "3qQhzn7ILIAfrTDJ9xj3Pw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "It's good, don't get me wrong, but I think it has a lot of hype surrounding it.  When I went, I waited over 45 minutes (though they told me it would 35-40).  We finally got our seat and as we were walking, the hostess got pulled over by a waiter.  He then did a 360 and took us to a different table. Turns out the table was incredibly drafty and someone asked to switch, so they decided we were the ones to do it.  Fine, I lived with that.We ordered the french onion soup dumplings, which were REALLY good, but the portion was just too small for $12.  I ordered eggs Benedict solely because it came with homefries, and if I ordered them separately, it would have been an extra $5.  It was good, but nothing to write home about. My friends got the chilaquiles, which was definitely delicious and unique. One other friend got a meatball sub with truffle fries (which are also good, but I do not like truffle).Overall, I think it cost more than it was worth.  The $5 mimosas are good, but small.  I am not a cheap person, but this was a pricey place for average quality and portions."}, {"review_id": "s8TpeCAAa5eCCYDdMKqNIQ", "user_id": "zZEHLG7H_92Y1YP_tN-7-A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/7/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Food is great HOWEVER the service is disappointing.

So refreshing and crisp and definitely gets you feeling nice. ( I'm a lightweight ) Everyone seemed to be in the mimosa and bloody mary mood but I was into the champs. For apps we started off with the french onion soup dumplings & delicious steak nachos that had everything you would want on them. I really enjoyed both of those.We all went different ways when it came to ordering our main meals... I obviously went for the eggs benny but opted out with canadian bacon and got regular. The truffle home fries were amazing!!!

We went on a Friday evening around 8pm and were seated immediately. Good thing we went when we did because within the next 30 min it was completely packed!! We got a table for 2 in the front of the restaurant in the corner so it felt pretty private, which we liked along with the dim lighting. We both started with 2 vodka dirty martinis. It takes a special bartender to get this jusssttttt right and he got it justtttttt right! Great start before ordering food. We then split the french onion soup dumplings and the potato goat cheese perogis. Both were delicious and special shout out to the creativity of the french onion soup dumplings. Only thing I could suggest would be to get smaller spoon to fit in the holes of the escargot gratin dish to get all the broth. For entrees, I got the tuna burger with a side salad and P got fish tacos (3). Taco dish was way bigger than he expected. Flaky white fish and great accompaniments. Tuna burger served rare was spot on. Loved it here and definitely coming back for brunch, dinner, and happy hour/weekly specials!"}, {"review_id": "cK_z9-c-bvQDs8VP92C7uQ", "user_id": "fUMfR-ljz1904fJLlxKSow", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/26/2017", "text": "Got brunch here today for the first time.  Usually very crowded I hear, but it was a holiday weekend so only had a 15 min wait for a table (they don't take reservations for 2 people, only for 3+).  A quaint brunch place and I was impressed with the quality of the food.  Got some simple hot black tea and eggs Benedict.  English muffins toasted, Canadian ham slightly grilled, eggs perfectly poached and hollandaise scratch made.  The home fries were little crispy half moons of seasoned potatoes that were creamy inside, served with a little tin of ketchup.I was very tempted to have the peach Bellini for $5...the menu also looked like it had great burgers and sandwiches so looking forward to coming back."}, {"review_id": "rHQQm8_EwRYWdagLD6_TXQ", "user_id": "-i4hxIx735DxANj1JR5NxA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Ate brunch at The Hamilton Inn not too long ago and it was pretty good!

Came here with my fiance to celebrate his birthday. It didn't go over so well (but that has nothing to do with this place and everything to do with my texting constantly during dinner to plan his surprise birthday party once we got back home). Anyway, the staff here is very friendly and checked on how were doing throughout our dinner. I love the ambiance here, it's very quiet, dim, perfect place for a romantic dinner. They have both outdoor and indoor seating (with lights decorating the outside) and a pretty expansive bar. My fiance ordered the Rueben and I got the Mexican Torta. My fiance thought his Rueben was okay - very oily, it was dripping while he ate it. The mexican torta was okay, I thought there were a bit too much crema sauce in my sandwich, which dulled a lot of the other flavors.Overall, not a bad spot.

I called Hamilton inn and they said it is first come first served and we got there in 10 mins, the wait would be no more than 20. When we got there, it took about 5 mins for the host to talk to us (note, no one else was waiting in front of us to be attended). Then we were asked if we had a reservation which confused me because I was told t was first come first serve. So I promptly went on opentable and there was a reservation open at least every 15 mins so I promptly made one. We were finally seated and were told that the booster chair will be brought out shortly for my baby nephew. They mentioned that twice more but it never came which was not a big deal because the nephew found a way to entertain himself. I can't complain about the service after we were seated but the experience upfront had me jaded a little. Food was good/average, nothing great.

What more could you ask for?The Hamilton Inn is a Jersey City staple, and after a few visits it's not surprising to see why. I've only ever been in for brunch, and the menu is phenomenal. You can take the brunch route and go with a classic like eggs benny or avocado toast or take the lunch route and enjoy anything from a lobster roll to a turkey burger. Basically - the menu has a ton of options.On my most recent trip, I ordered the truffled breakfast pizza. Confession, I had been drooling over the Instagram pics all morning. The insta-cravings delivered, and this pizza was nothing short of incredible. The egg and pancetta were crispy, and the melty cheese and spinach added the perfect texture. My mans went with the steak eggs benedict and finished every last drop. They've got some great brunch drink deals, and you can snag a mimosa, bulldog or bloody for 5 bucks. I've been in for a few brunches, but next time would love to try dinner.
