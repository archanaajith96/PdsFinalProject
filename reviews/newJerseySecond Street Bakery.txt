Thank god a man overheard our conversation and told us that we were headed to the wrong spot. Both names are similar, both spots have sandwiches, and both are within a millisecond of each other. But for a real deal Italian sandwich on the cheap Second Street Bakery is where you want to be. I've heard alot of hype about it over the years and am so happy that I finally got to experience for myself. And the verdict? It's totally worth the hype. The menu has a ton of different hot and cold sandwich options plus other bakery items like rolls, breads and focaccia pizzas. My fiance and I went splits on a meatball parm sub and a focaccia pizza. The fresh baked bread was soft and doughy (my favorite, hate when bread is crunchy) and the meatballs and tomato sauce were delicious. The sandwich was topped with fresh melted mutz. The focaccia was also delicious -- way better than a slice from Two Boots or Helen's in my opinion. Looks like Second Street Bakery may not only be my new sandwich go-to. I could see it being my new pizza go-to as well.Not only is everything delicious, it's also incredibly cheap. They are cash only, we only had 8 dollars and were still able to walk out with a large meatball sub and focaccia. Sandwiches are something like 5.90 which really can't be beat. I'll be back soon!"}, {"review_id": "Vk7WZPGHRHv3DZjT3Z37kw", "user_id": "eycJ0Pb9Ba0ETRRcZL8zuw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "I look forward to working remotely - the sole purpose being that I can pick up a sandwich at Second Street Bakery. First off, it's like a piece of old school deli heaven. The nice lady always greats you with a smile and instantly makes you feel at home. Today, I got the #3 sandwich and that was definitely #theyummytimes. I also had a taste of their cheesecake bread - which was heaven. The huge sandwich, cheesecake bread, and a Snapple was $10. Something yummy and reasonable? This is almost worth moving to Chilltown.

I've been twice now, and no roll yet.I'll have to come back to try their famous cinnamon roll among other things. I came at lunchtime and waited quite a long time only to find out that they were out of everything. The woman was really nice about it though and she gave me a pretty good Stromboli thing with a meatball. I didn't love it and I'd really like to try their famous cinnamon roll and other Specialties before I properly weigh in on this place but until then I will give it a neutral four star rating.Speaking of weighing in, I'll weigh a lot if I eat here too regularly."}, {"review_id": "httxuBpYzN-GdhU1jADPyg", "user_id": "ssjEL_HEDKRwzUeCEkSjDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Unassuming place with delicious homemade breads.

Well the texture of the bread is amazing and chewy but at the same time sturdy enough to hold the contents of the sandwich perfectly.I plan to try every single sandwich here but having a difficult time moving away for #3 or #6 large.  Yumm just writing this review is making my mouth water..is it lunch time yet??"}, {"review_id": "_KuKV7UgCdkeRA5x4aQnbw", "user_id": "tgqGxNHh_-itqDBrxJuDHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Easily the best sandwich spot to go to in that particular area of jersey city. I've had a variety of their sandwiches both breakfast and lunch and have had no complaints. Their prices are cheap and hand out a lot of food, you should definitely try their chicken rolls if you get there early enough during the day. 5 stars for price, convenience & great tasting food overall."}, {"review_id": "91tmirrzYUg9NCUS5EMPOQ", "user_id": "wEE-YMx5pmSuagLtNxMPKA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "My last review of this spot is 2009, and it's time for an update. But, not much to update other than that this place is still legendarily epic. It embodies everything about the past, in the best way possible. Cheap prices? Check! $6 or less for a huge sammy stuffed to the gills with meat and cheeses. Amazing sandwiches? Check. Whether you go traditional deli meat style or the eggplant or chicken parm, you can't go wrong. But that chicken parm hero, yo!Friendly service? Check. The owner still holds strong at the front. She's sweet, she's been there forever and is a part of JC history. Talk to her, and she def won't accept tips, but nice try.That sausage bread, yo! Dammmmmmn.That cinnamon bread loaf.... damnnnnnnnn. I miss living in jersey city and I think 2nd street bakery and everything it embodies is one of the many reasons! If you haven't been, WTF are you doing. If you have, how can you not agree?!"}, {"review_id": "f9XlJRIu1fRIoivBDU_8IQ", "user_id": "SVuiykqjYor6m_bHbu-EsA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/8/2016", "text": "Wowowowowowow. WOWOWOOWOWOWOW. I don't think this place is as well known as it should be. Second Street Bakery is (as its name suggests) tucked away on Second Street with a quiet and dark storefront. In fact, I would have thought this place was closed if I didn't see someone inside. Immediately when you walk in, you're greeted with the tantalizing smell of fresh bread and cinnamon. It's a small place, just enough room for a few people to order and go. The lady at the counter is so friendly and smiley. Already you know this is going to be a fantastic experience.Second Street Bakery is known for its fresh bread and sandwiches. We ordered the #6 cold cut sandwich (large), chicken parm sandwich (large), cinnamon bread, and baguette. So much food and the total was only 16$! The sandwiches had the perfect ratio of meat to bread, and wow was that bread good. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. The cinnamon bread was also amazing! Tasted kind of like those cinnamon pretzels from Auntie Anne's, but crunchier and also softer because this bread is in a whole different league from those pretzels. The baguette is a great size and perfect if you want to make your own sandwiches. So many wows at this place. Highly recommend and will definitely return!"}, {"review_id": "_uK4_zRxBCW6SgUzdB85Zg", "user_id": "2FFV6At1U8w2nefNiI15vw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/23/2017", "text": "A hole in the wall but who cares, it's all about the stuffed breads here.  Upon leaving and before I could even get the car started we were already stuffing our faces with a little meatball concoction of some sort.  Then arriving home - the real pig out ensues later when we were once again stuffing our faces but this time the wife with stuffed sausage bread and me with stuffed cinnamon bread.
