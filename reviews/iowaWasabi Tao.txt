We meet for dinner at 6:45 pm and was told it would be 30 min for a table for 4, but was pleasantly surprised when we were seated within a few minutes. We started with an appetizer of crispy rock shrimp with  yuzu cream sauce, served on a bed of spinach. It was so delicious that we ordered a 2nd appetizer of it to share.The Sushi lovers ordered 4 rolls to share, out of the 4 types all agreed the Italian Stallion was their favorite ( shrimp tempura, spicy tuna & mango wrapped in soy nori w. spicy kani, served w. yuzu miso & unagi sauce). I ordered Chicken Teriyaki served on caramelized onions. Served with rice and mixed vegetables. The food definitely deserves a 5, however I had to rate a 4 due to a few observations made.  The space of the restaurant is very narrow, which would made it very hard to navigate if you were on crutches, in a wheelchair or a little on the fluffy side. In addition, it was very dark in the restaurant and as someone who experiences vision issues, it was hard for me to walk between the tables. In addition, this would not be a place to bring children to, as there is no high chairs (or place to put one) or booster chairs. Which would be nice if you were looking for an excuse to hire a babysitter."}, {"review_id": "Zm43gP9TxK9w7j_k6FcQ3w", "user_id": "Rb8EigKqxMj_etgICnEepA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/22/2017", "text": "Undoubtedly our favorite sushi spot in Des Moines! The rolls are always fresh, and the menu offers a nice selection of vegetarian rolls, too. If you go this route, don't miss the Green Peace! My fiancé has traveled all over the world (including to Japan), and he has mentioned multiple times that Wasabi Tao is among the best sushi he's had if not THE best.The drinks here never miss either. We recommend sitting at the bar, where you'll likely meet Bruce, who's great! The ambiance of the space hits the mark, too. It's great for a date, a night out with friends, or even a business meeting. The space offers a variety of seating options with varying levels of privacy, and there is even a small patio to enjoy if the weather's nice. Bottom line: If you're looking for sushi in Des Moines, Wasabi Tao is your spot."}, {"review_id": "5WYqHweDZfMbDBNZLyoVJA", "user_id": "JIOthYFa_PT5N2TZ42mPpg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "After living in Hawaii for 15 years, I would have never thought to get sushi in Iowa; however, came here for dinner while on a work trip and thought the food was well prepared and the staff friendly.

This is not the first time I've been here but it has been a long time since I've been back. They have outside patio seating and inside is decent for size. Bathroom is just one stall for women...the mens I have no idea lol. Their food was okay. We ordered some edamame, spicy squid salad, ginger dressing salad, miso soup, and sashimi with some rolls. The squid salad was delish! The sashimi I felt could of had better quality fish and the rolls were ok. Their sister restaurant off of Merle Hay Road I feel has better food and selection. I probably won't come back to this Wasabi place but will definitely be back at the Merle Hay location. If you are around downtown and craving sushi definitely give it a try. You might have better luck than me on the food!"}, {"review_id": "W09bScjVWSmRE8fV9cVyqQ", "user_id": "4Xx773iUjHd0Fjs0kdKt1w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/9/2017", "text": "Another great sushi place. The sushi plates where you can sample different things are great deals. No complaints on food, drink, service, or cleanliness. However they need to remove a table or 6. There is not enough room to stretch if you needed to. I barely had room for my purse along with the food. The spacing is awful. I actually had wait staff apologizing for elbowing over our table & being in our personal space. I would not want to go to this location with a group of when they're busy. The Johnston location has more space & I would recommend it first than the downtown place. Until they expand or figure out the spacing issues, I'll stick with Johnston."}, {"review_id": "4UViMUtzjWJO2VnhAPutLg", "user_id": "Mhte3PwkHHfMPpidIddNiQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Generous portions of sushi with rolls and salad.

Was already downtown having beers at El Bait Shop so I made the short trip over to Wasabi Tao.Cozy little place on the corner of Walnut and 4th. Not a huge seating area but big enough. I stopped in around 9:00pm on a Tuesday night and sat at the bar. TV behind the bar was showing tennis at the time which seemed to be gathering more attention than tennis should. Ordered a Kirin to drink. Not really a impressive selection of draught beers but it's a sushi place so I'm not going to hold that against them.Ordered the Angry Tuna roll based on the suggestion of the bartender. Came with a salad with ginger dressing which i couldn't stop eating. I wanted to pick up the bowl and slurp the rest of the dressing down but decided that probably wasn't a good look. Roll was placed in front of me about five minutes after that. Presentation was on point. Flavor was fantastic. Loved the different sauces used and the tuna, you could tell it fresh. I was extremely happy with the bartender's advice.I used to think Waterfront was the king of sushi around town. But Wasabi Tao has changed my mind on that. Will be back again that's for sure."}, {"review_id": "_HwAXUSn-wGFrUvluBlf0g", "user_id": "NZUosyHUyOHOFJRbPdLYng", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/12/2017", "text": "Stopped in for a quick lunch on our way out of town. Their lunch special was two rolls for $10, which included soup or salad. What a deal!I opted for the salad and it was the best ginger dressing I've ever had. I practically licked the bowl clean.Seaweed salad was delicious and huge. I couldn't finish it. The rolls were equally delicious.Our server was very knowledgeable for my companion, who has a gluten allergy, so that was much appreciated and a bit surprising."}, {"review_id": "mkyGP1mzV8i5uCangSMRQA", "user_id": "f28l9MexcHkHp2aedHcmfA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "LOVEEEEE! I went here last week around 8:30 pm and was seated at the sushi bar. We were immediately greeted by a super nice waitress.
