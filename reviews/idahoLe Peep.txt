This is my 393rd review on Yelp. Hi fellow Yelpers all over the world, and my fellow Idahoian Yelpers-- if you're looking for a great breakfast place, that offers all-day mimosas than this is your place! I've seen a few of the people I follow--shout out to Lino, Mitzi, Ophilia (miss you girl),  Charles F., and Cassie and many others,  I've felt like I NEED to try this place. It's perfectly located on Eagle and Ustick. I work out on the HP campus, and this is the perfect location to go visit friends for lunch. Walking in, the staff was friendly, and the menu was mouthwatering. I was working, therefore, I didn't try the mimosa's but my dining companion gave them an A! I did order the turkey sandwich with no bread. The ingredients were high quality, not lacking value and overall excellent tasting!The best part, for me, is that they care about our pockets! They have a punch card. For every $10 you get a stamp-- once you get 10 stamps, you get $10 free!! Additionally, if you link your credit or debit card to YELP, which I have, you get 7% cash back-- heck that's good! I always take advantage of YELP's cash back, and check in offers-- free money... count me in!"}, {"review_id": "0gYsbXlh5WlzHGL-4ynfYg", "user_id": "SsSg2BASS62MdhBsDBbKVQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "My family and I have been here several times and we have never had a bad meal.

When we walked in we were amazed by how open the area was and how lively it was. We ordered an orange juice to shard which was more than enough, they give you options on how much you want. Mr. Euro ordered a scramble and I ordered my usual, the chicken fried steak. He cleared his plate. Absolutely loved it. I liked mine, although I'm used to chicken fried steak not coming  in bulk from a box. If they could learn how to make their chicken fried steak from scratch it would be ten times better. The store bought taste doesn't cut it anymore. Other than that, it was a great experience. Service was kind and efficient. Prices weren't bad either. I would definitely give it another shot."}, {"review_id": "s7FVP7ZxNZqO0to0HncXfw", "user_id": "UwfnmYkohjEzcBEctJpF2w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/8/2017", "text": "This place was soooo good.

The staff are extremely friendly and professional. As a business owner myself I was impressed with the communication with in team members. Initially we were told that there would be 10 to 15 min wait. Within 2 minutes we were seated. The most amazing thing was we were helped by 5 different servers they got EVERYTHING CORRECT. Food was hot and delivered very quickly. I even watched as a patron was rude and demanding to the staff. He even blanantly lied to the manager, I know because I overheard  the conversation. Over all I would love to give them a 10 STAR."}, {"review_id": "aJ-AjtceiA5sLF_Vb9HN6w", "user_id": "8yO92iRFqrR5lMCHturopQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Used to love this place. We were super regulars. Like extreme regulars. 2-3 times a week. Still love the food and some of the wait staff. App used to worked well. Now two times we have come and showed up when there were one or two parties ahead of us still on app and they tell us when we get there they took us off the list. Today happened again, checked in on the app at 11:02 am. we got there with two parties ahead and the girl at door says when we go to check in, oh I can't find you, you weren't here when we called so I took you off list. I am frustrated but say ok. Then she says well you can't all check in because your whole party isn't here. Annoying because I knew what everyone wanted to eat but I didn't say anything. Then we watch group after group go ahead of us. I figure they are smaller parties than a party of six. She seats another group of six. I ask her what is up. She gives us the snottiest smile and says you've only been wait x long. I said that is not correct I know when i checked in via the app and it's a lot longer than that. She says your whole party wasn't here. I say, you told us before that we were no longer on the list so that is not the accurate time. She says again with a snotty smile yes it is. I go to speak to the manager who has seen us eat here forever. She takes the hostesses side. We left. NEVER AGAIN.  That is what loyalty gets you at le peep. Two times that an app is right over a customers word."}, {"review_id": "wENZjm7dthuub4LkYt2X6w", "user_id": "FxZkV57Rb0hq2Z2bxmfKVw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/27/2017", "text": "If you're looking for a Bloody Mary/mimosa-style brunch, just don't. This is not the place for you. Both beverages are more tomato juice/orange juice with a hefty price tag attached, but I'm going to set that aside and review the food and service for now.They have quite a big selection of savory/sweet options, which was nice. I was in the mood for sweet and ordered the Monte Cristo crepes. My partner ordered the lumberjack breakfast, complete with eggs, bacon, potatoes, and a short stack of chocolate chip pancakes. The wait time to be seated plus the wait for our food was a bit on the ridiculous side, but we didn't have anything pressing, so we waited, and waited, and waited. When the food came out, mine was pretty good. The crepes were assembled like a traditional Monte Cristo sandwich. I had to pick through the potatoes on the side, though, to avoid excessive crunch, and the garlic breadstick was completely unnecessary and went untouched. Half of my partner's dish was served at the same time. He started eating while waiting on the pancakes to be delivered. He described it as just \"okay,\" but had the same issues with undercooked potatoes. The chocolate chip pancake was dropped off once we were pretty much done. He took a few bites, but the \"short stack\" was literally larger than his head. Seemed like kind of a waste. Overall, the extensive menu may work for families with a range of tastes, but the atmosphere and food quality weren't a match for ours."}, {"review_id": "vX-bfi5OxzWR5KaZdj8PyQ", "user_id": "vGUMCWWxRukldJpUiSUpnA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "Great place for a friendly breakfast.

Instead of just frying potatoes, they bake them chopped up, so none of the greasy taste.  All of the other choices disappeared quickly from the plates.

Decided for some brunch after checking out some of the other businesses on the block and settled on LePeep. From the outside it looks as if it will have a smaller layout and a ambiguity to it that is interesting. The inside is clean and has a very \"corporate\" feel to it. I'm not sure if it's a chain or locally owned, but it runs like a larger company. The food was very generous on portion size and price. Ordered a breakfast burrito which was massive and a side Belgium Waffle. I thought the burrito would be smaller so the double order was fine. Let me tell you it was massive and full of flavor. Really enjoyed my time here.
