It took 2 weeks, and I'm not kidding. We stopped here on our way to the airport. We were looking for some good coffee after mediocre cups all week long, and chose Lux Central based on the reviews that raved about their coffee. This place is hard to find. To find parking, you have to turn down the side of the building, and you'll see their lot. When we got there, the lot was full, so we ended up parking down one of the side streets. Luckily, someone was leaving. This all happened before 11am on a Friday morning. Their coffee was not good, it was watery and lacked taste. Sure, I'm a bit of a coffee snob, but I was sure anything would taste better than the hotel and resort coffee I had during the week. I was wrong. So wrong. Disappointing. We ordered 3 breakfast egg sandwiches, 2 without bacon. They forgot one of them, and we had to spend another 10 minutes waiting for it, on top of the 20 we had already waited because it was so crowded. Boo. They only had 1 cook working? The sandwiches were hot, but they were soaked in cheese and left a rock in my stomach for 2 weeks. My girlfriend couldn't even finish hers. They have a pretty extensive breakfast menu. Perhaps the other menu items are better, but I think it's pretty hard to screw up a breakfast sandwich. If you're looking for some good coffee and a breakfast sandwich in a hurry, look elsewhere."}, {"review_id": "oP1dzkAzvOZp7XfdHYry2g", "user_id": "qhTF3WAcdXh4e8OjaZaRkw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Good but not worth the exceptionally long wait for your food and coffee.

There was no line whatsoever. I ordered the coffee cake and a cup of iced coffee, and in the line with me was the former Mayor of the City of Phoenix. He was kind enough to buy me breakfast! He was raving about the place to me, telling me that he enjoys everything they sell here. The coffee cake definitely did not disappoint, it was a decent sized piece, that went amazingly well with the cup of delicious iced coffee which was perfectly made. The interior is adorable, with options to sit on a couch, chair, or even at the bar."}, {"review_id": "cUCfCgcqLZctNhEiXUwdTw", "user_id": "I35RdKHkhdUHuBjBnzikXQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "I really enjoyed the atmosphere here.

If it's your first time here, the entrance to Lux Central is hard to find. You can slip through the crack alley in front of Pane Bianco to get to the door or you can go in from the side street and hit it from the back side. Another way to know you're in the right place... It's in the building next to Undefeated. The line on weekends is constant but moves quickly. We were near the door when we started and were at the register before 10 minutes were up. Someone will come up to you in line, take your drink order on a pad of paper, then you stay in line to pay at the cashier. A minute or two later, your drink is ready. Lux Central to me is like a hipster version of the Friends' Central Perk. Exposed wood beams, grey brick walls instead of red brick walls, couches and weathered wood tables. The seating consists of chairs and couches of various styles and upholstery with people eating, studying, talking or playing board games. A fun, vibrant place that has a constant buzz but no annoying loud noises or people. I ordered their iced coffee which is more like an Americano. Two shots of espresso over ice. You can get it with two shots, four shots or six shots. They use and roast their own blend of beans that are sourced from Ethiopia, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Panama, Sumatra and Brazil to make their espresso and coffee drinks. They even make their own chai! For tea, you would just picking from a selection of Republic of Tea offerings. They did a great pull on my iced coffee. Just tell them beforehand if you want to leave room for cream or not. They do not make a cold brew here. They have a considerable assortment of pastries and breakfast menu items but I didn't have any so I won't comment on those. If you are looking for a good cup o' joe and want a fun place to hang out with friends, study, or break the awkwardness of a first date, Lux Central is super stellar for all of that!"}, {"review_id": "XfIg1zLP2Z0_9wX10k3__A", "user_id": "KNaUnmmFbw4h6X_EOWoOEg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "Hipster watering hole! Lux was my neighbor growing up but since I grew up \"poor\", I only discovered it's existence as a young professional. Slightly salty. Objectively speaking, the open kitchen concept, raw ingredients and urban clientele makes it a Phoenix hallmark.*ENTRANCE is not on the Main Street.They offer a wide variety of food (breakfast-dinner). Also have a bar in the back!! I love going to chat with a friend or for solo studying. Mainstay are their quick bites, Mac and Cheese for $8. If you want to visit, I recommend.1) flexible schedule especially peak hours, after work and weekends. -long lines & order wait times, time prowling for prime seats. 2) headphones, always either at a hum or loud. Entrance: very easy to miss. It had a modern flat design with a main entrance facing the parking lot NOT the main street. Parking is free- also street parking since the lot gets packed.Clientele: Best part of Lux is the ambiance. It's a hodgepodge of urbanites; students, young professionals, intellectuals. Space: One main room, two smaller wings and patio seating. They have a variety of seating options; grouped tables with chairs (study friendly), non traditional benches and arm rests. Guesstimate interior seating alone could fit about 80ppl."}, {"review_id": "xsYBViHnbAhR_t_BNI8DTQ", "user_id": "LmoYySdaAO7XBEajSAytGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "This café is probably the most eclectic café I've ever encountered - and I sample cafes everywhere I go, around the country and abroad.I think the vibe is very tough to describe, but I will tell you that I loved it! We stopped by around 8-9 pm on a Saturday night and there were people of all ages from children to retirees. It was also fascinating to see people of all ages working side by side on their laptops on long tables. I guess Im used to seeing college/grad students to young professionals who choose coffee spots as work places, but it was fascinating to see how well all the age groups blended here! The seating is super fun aside from the long tables - there are couches spread throughout the café and people were just meeting up and having an awesome time. It's basically divided into a main hall and then there are a few smaller rooms with couches and tables, on of which you can actually reserve. In one room, old TV shows and sports were playing off a projector on to the wall. The unique thing here is you can order a full meal (breakfast/lunch/dinner), get dessert or baked goods, coffee/lattes or a drink from their bar. The kitchen is open, and in fact, barely separated from the seating area so you see people working away on your food and drinks. I got a velvet latte which was a white chocolate latte - done very, very well with a strong hint of coffee in it and the taste of white chocolate was subtle but recognizable. From desserts, I got a Nutella thumbprint cookie which was super tasty, especially with the coffee flavored whip cream that went with my friend's flourless dark chocolate cake (which was also excellent!) The wall art is super random and fascinating! You would have to see for yourself to know what I mean, and it does make you think. The place is VERY hipster, and people come here totally casual, and it sounds cheesy, but it is definitely a spot where you are welcome just as you are!"}, {"review_id": "Y_t3dBNqt4Az7u5mzjAPXw", "user_id": "_MpXTX4QsxVn06JpZ5biuA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Stoped by today on 3rd of May with a friend.Place was a little crowded.

Served in this giant mug that makes you feel super warm and comfy.Also, like I mentioned before, the place is massive and the space was filled in with people sitting, chatting, working, etc. Thankfully, finding a seat is not difficult.

I also went when there were no other patrons waiting for food and it took over 20+ minutes for them to make my meal. Vibe is hipster but casual and not pretentious.

You can really get creative with your lattes here and their selection of desserts is always interesting and changing. The space itself is what really makes Lux a winner. The place is surprisingly huge with plenty of seating, but it gets crowded quickly, especially at peak hours so be wary of this if youre coming in with a big group or to study. That being said, Lux boasts one of the most homey and earthy, yet diverse interiors of any local downtown coffee shop, which makes even the large crowds worth bearing. Come in the fall or early winter time for some lovely outdoor seating or come in the evenings to enjoy a DJ and watch this place transform into a chill late night hangout spot. Parking here can be a bit of a strain and even trying to find it when driving down central. I always seem to miss it the first time. But alas, maybe that's more my incompetence. Things I would recommend here besides the coffee? The jalapeño Mac and cheese definitely. The coffee crumble cake is also an unexpected delight. I'll be returning to try some more of their wide assortment of pastries so more reviews of Lux must-haves coming soon."}, {"review_id": "ESSlIPjl1TSYk8YF_DK1XA", "user_id": "Rle40NWIi6wcctjG6cPdEw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "I have been going to Lux for years, and I find it to be one of the most soothing and hip atmospheres in Phoenix.

Lux doesn't make it by hand. it comes out of a box. even starbucks \"only\" charges 60¢.- for some reason, you and everyone else in line to order wait in the exact middle of all the foot traffic in the café (???) and the menu (a standard-size sheet of paper taped to a glass wall among other non-menu sheets of paper) is easy to miss. - even after the morning rush, the inside of the restaurant is always packed and dimly lit, making the space unpleasantly loud and claustrophobic.- all the food i've ever eaten at Lux has been middling at best. the croissants and pastries are nothing special tending toward flavorless, same for the plain bread/toast, avocado toast was unseasoned (ie. no salt)the ugly:- staff are rude, condescending, aloof. holding up the loooong line to have conversations with customers (wtf dude, c'mon), being disdainfully told to \"read the menu\" then \"just order a side of veggies\" when asking about meatless options... ohhkayyee, thanks. based on the reviews of other yelpers, Lux is clearly aware of the problem and have done nothing to discipline or train employees. no it's cool i actually want to be talked down to by 22-year-olds who all seem to follow the same instagram makeup tutorials and shop in the same urban outfitters."}, {"review_id": "HVPY3F24kgHhuGioo5ZeRg", "user_id": "90xbeYFy-0TpRiCCFr8CtQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Eating breakfast with a DJ playing indie cuts is quite a unique and refreshing experience. . .
