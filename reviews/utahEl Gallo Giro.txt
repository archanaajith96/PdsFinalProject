The restaurant is really cute inside with wooden tables and little Latin festive decorations. Felt cozy and traditional. They have an out door patio seating for the summer as well.The food was alright. It wasn't the best Mexican food I've had but they weren't bad either. The prices are decent for the amount of food and quality your getting. I personally ordered the carne asada plate and the meat was so tender that I really loved it and would order it again. My friends got the street tacos and said they were pretty good. So all in all if you're in a little Mexican food craving I think this place would definitely satisfy your needs and you won't leave wishing you'd gone somewhere else. So definitely try them out!!"}, {"review_id": "jXXzRInxl9y4oERsaWwBqQ", "user_id": "5NtHIjk72C9DoEedgpf7Aw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "Before I go into why this is only a 3/5 star, let me tell you some of the things that deserve to be a 5/5!First off, the gentleman at at the front taking our order, was super kind when he saw we were here. He took our order and even helped me get something more cost effective. Thank you! Also, our waitress Precilla, was super kind!!! She made sure our table was clean before sitting and thought of us while eating and just brought over napkins. Super nice. Alright, now for the unfortunate part... the food just wasn't up to par... the tacos, great taste, but fall apart. The enchiladas, yummy but I guess I just prefer a white tortilla. And lastly the beans and rice.... just not a favorite. Anyway, still a solid place to eat! Just not a favorite!!"}, {"review_id": "oX_ae0xgIo1_1o2fLpcuKw", "user_id": "99XCrbxA9CD9cEDhnDNJLA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "WOW! This place is AUTHENTIC! The people who work here were SO friendly and nice, and the food was all amaaaaazing. My husband and I went with my parents, and we ordered a parrillada to share. It was a TON of meat, all of it really delicious and cooked perfectly. Couldn't finish it, I think 6 people could share it. José was serving us and was so helpful and cool. They have fresh horchata, strawberry and mango juices. It's sad that we have never been before and are just about to move!

What can I even say about this place to really convey how amazing it was? I'm not sure but I'll try. If any of you grew up in southern CA and then moved to a place where everyone claimed there was good Mexican food (ahem Utah..), you know that nothing really compared to SoCal. I had completely given up hope of ever finding Mexican food in Utah that was the real thing. El Gallo Giro changed my Utah world. It's everything I ever dreamed of finding. The chicken... so tender, flavorful, juicy and perfectly cooked. The carne asada... flavorful marinade, tender meat with edges grilled to a perfect crisp. Should I continue? Because I could go on all day describing how delicious that food was. Whatever you guys are doing, whatever cooks you have - don't change a thing."}, {"review_id": "dRYAixVT5yeFemIVl5V4-Q", "user_id": "Fk9s1KCA37yxumu4FL11gw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/30/2017", "text": "QUEST COMPLETE!! My wife and I were on a quest for the best Mexican food in all the land... and the winner is EL GALLO GIRO. This place was incredible. Let's start with the marinated half chicken (my meal). It's $10, huge plate of food, and fresh made tortillas. The rice and beans are absolutely perfect, and the meat is tender, full of flavor, and literally melts in your mouth. The Carne Asada is just as good. Huge portions and perfectly seasoned. Now here's what put it at #1 for me, the Horchata. I am a horchata snob, I hate the mix and I can spot it with a single drop. The horchata is authentic, sweet, and unlimited. Yes, UNLIMITED. The staff was friendly and helpful, the place had nice tables and wasn't crowded. We WILL be back. As long as this review is live, I haven't found a better Mexican food place in all of Utah County and Salt Lake County.

This place is insane!!! Soooooo delicious! My brother took me here and I was skeptical but after the first bite I was sold 100%. This place easily the best and most authentic Mexican food restaurant in Utah valley but without the price tag. Im sitting here not even done with my food and I'm already excited for my next visit. Delicious salsas, with a lot of variety. They also have agua Fresca! This place is decorated well and feels nicer than it the price reflects. Come here and try it!

A town server who gave the best service I have seen in a long time. Every restaurant should have servers as happy and attentive as Christian.The fresh guac was good -could have used a squeeze of lime so be sure to ask for it. The flautist we good and so we're the enchiladas.

Once the employee can't take it anymore, he or she will quit. Any form of yelling, swearing, put-downs and screaming is verbal abuse and should never be tolerated. Also STOP LUSTING AND START RESPECTING your female employees!!** Teach your employees about basic health & safety rules.

Let me preface this by saying we just moved here from San Diego, home of amazing Mexican food. We have been searching for something resembling authentic Mexican. Fresh ingredients, homemade tortillas, real refried beans, good chile verde, etc....Well, these guys fell way short. The only thing that seemed somewhat fresh was the agua fresca, and even that tasted like canned juice. Tried the half chicken with rice and beans. Chicken was over cooked and extremely dry. Beans were tasteless and seemed canned. Rice was okay. Corn tortillas were disappointing. My son and daughter got the California burrito. Holy Cow......it was so bad. I'm so surprised that this place has as many stars as it does. I'm sure it's good to some people, but it's just bland, uneventful food. I'm hoping there is better Mexican food in Utah.

They bring you out fresh chips and salsa too. I usually always get a water cup when I go out to eat, but you HAVE to pay for a drink. They have fresh Hispanic drinks and the Horchata is to die for.

Tons of people and the conversations were flowing. The food on the other hand was sub par. My wife and I ordered the 1/2 chicken and it was very very dry. It seemed like they put it on slow cook all day and didn't take it out until we ordered it. There is plenty of food to feed us both. I could even get it to go in a to go box and have the leftovers. I didn't want to do that because it was so dry.Everyone else seemed to like their food but not the best place they have ever been too. The cleanliness of the place could improve as well. I looked back in the kitchen and their were dishes everywhere and maybe me think twice about my dishes and utensils I was using.
