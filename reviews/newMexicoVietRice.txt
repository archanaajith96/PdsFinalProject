On the westside there are three strong options, Siagon 2, Pho Bar and Viet Rice. Viet Rice's location is the most convenient to me (I'm in Corrales). I usually order the Pho (pronounced f-uh not f-oh) The meat is fresh, the veggies are fresh and the broth is really good. Try getting a little side bowl for a hoisen and srirachi and lime mixture to dip your meat into before gobbling it all up.Service is a little slow, which knocks a star off the rating."}, {"review_id": "oTt_8Btyxk9xDMN86QHx6w", "user_id": "fo8WK5uLkgTga5gFSabkSw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "This place has gone downhill.  I used to eat here a lot when I first moved here because it is near my house and it was decent.  My family & I have since found a place that serves good pho and their broth is rich and has a lot of flavor. So a month ago we went to our favorite Pho restaurant only to find out they were closed for the day.  We ended up at... Viet Rice.  I ordered the Pho Ga (chicken) and it was not all that great. It pretty much tasted like chicken noodle soup out of a can. I didn't even eat half of it.  We also had spring rolls and that was OK. I think my Campbell's chicken noodle soup at home tastes better."}, {"review_id": "McRNZW7smEpFuDwst-Rf2w", "user_id": "fZxkZArwohI4RsisGULMcw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/6/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "When compiling a list the best comfort foods pho would have a top spot on my list.   As far as the west side of the river Viet Rice has the best pho you can find.  This gem of a place it worth the short drive up to Rio Rancho.  You I'll find a friendly staff who will never let your water glass get below half way, and the best pho you have had in awhile.  My favorite is the vegetable pho but the other flavors are also top choices.   The rice dishes, chow fun and spring rolls are must try as well.  So far I have not had anything that I would not order agin and I have tried many many things on the menu."}, {"review_id": "kjRKyNzQIv6Pao_eN6R64g", "user_id": "VazGBHQdDKTBg39XsDrLaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Absolutely love this place.

I'm impressed...this place has been under new ownership and congrats the new owners for reinventing this establishment. The restaurant has been renovated, it's clean, and the food is way way better than I remembered from years ago when I used to come here. Whenever a Vietnamese restaurant brings you very fresh vegetables, it shows they take pride in their food. That's one of my indicators. Very friendly service. And I have to mention that they have a loyal following. A customer who sat in the corner we were told comes every day for his daily soup, EVERYDAY...As for the people who left bad reviews, it would probably worth your time to try this place again."}, {"review_id": "s0e6zqtMUEujS1WyAFM6Yg", "user_id": "7btK5Uvsgk05i4zcfP-2Tg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/10/2017", "text": "This is my go to place if I am craving for Pho! Their selections are pho-king awesome! I always order the same thing: wonton soup and fried egg rolls, and the grilled chicken with broken rice, and a Vietnamese iced coffee. During cold weather season, I get the combination Pho. Soooo delish! The service is always great and quick. It's located in a strip mall, next to the Smiths on 528 in Rio Rancho. I also recommend the fried noodles - there's something about the sauce they use, just yummy! I ordered a tray of their fried egg rolls for my daughter's birthday party and they gave me a few extra rolls in my order for free."}, {"review_id": "cHtpSJ4GEz3KT6ZbKGVx-g", "user_id": "u8nHOiRxwmYowee7iSahZw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "I stopped in for lunch & had their Spicy Lemon Grass (with chicken) and rice. The mixed veggies & chicken stir fry was indeed spicy, being liberally laced with red pepper flakes & ginger, and well flavored with fish sauce. The rice was the usual long or medium grain white rice. The portion was plenty big. It may look smaller in my pictures because that plate is 14\" diameter, I think. They use HUGE plates, so it creates a bit of an optical illusion.Loss of a star due to the rice having a somewhat chemical taste, like chlorine almost, when first sampled by itself. I assume this is due to using regular Rio Rancho tap water, which in my past experience can register a strong mineral or chemical taste on occasion, to make the rice. Not really the chef's fault, but still... Another inconsistency was that the taste of the stir fry varied from bite to bite, as if it hadn't been well mixed in the wok. The bites all tasted good, but some were stronger with ginger while others brought more fish sauce flavor. While they still have flan cake on their menu in the restaurant & online, which I'd hoped to try, the waiter explained they no longer make it due to it taking a long time to make. Bummer.I found the interior space pleasant, well lit, and efficiently laid out. I think it would make an inexpensive & pleasant venue for a date or dinner out. But I was there mid-afternoon so can't speak to dinner time noise level. I give them a bit of a demerit for having tv sound as background when I was there instead of music, which is a personal preference. The waiter was pleasant and extremely conscientious in his job, keeping my water glass filled & checking back a few times to insure that all was well. Easy five stars for service.Price was in line with food quality & very pleasant surroundings, just shy of $10 including tax for lunch.BOTTOM LINE: I would gladly return to Viet Rice to sample their pho or other dishes. I like the space and, especially, their service."}, {"review_id": "nWXzNyciyIbSctihtzAxkg", "user_id": "1mmqVuu2VE_cx0EYARlfdw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "We went here based on location (close to where we live) and the reviews.  Food was ok.... nothing spectacular.  I ordered a rice plate (com tam) and expected much better, considering \"rice\" was in their name.  Also there wasn't that many rice platter options.  Their typical com tam also doesn't come with slices or wedges of tomatoes.  What I really wanted was the steamed egg meatloaf (cha trung) and I didn't see that as an option and if I wanted them to add an egg (which I was sure wouldn't be cha trung hap) they would charge me a $1 extra.My bf ordered the soft-shelled crab rice dish and his crab was all fried and a bit too salty.  It was so fried and salty you couldn't taste the crab meat.  We were charged for asking two extra small bowls of fish sauce.... which I thought was Americanized.  Also the prices are a bit expensive for a Vietnamese restaurant.  I've been to ones that offer more food for a better price.  I need to find a more authentic, hole-in-the-wall, mom n pop viet restaurant in this area.  Otherwise, service was good and the servers were attentive.  What surprised me is they serve is Bun rieu, which I have never seen as an option at a Vietnamese restaurant.  So if I do have the craving for Bun rieu, I would have to give that a try there."}, {"review_id": "tjg-wNcAxTZj4RaqV-AOLQ", "user_id": "knOSHR2J0o36FzmxjZiHgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2017", "text": "We are stoked to find awesome Vietnamese Food in Rio Rancho.

I've been dining here for as long as I can remember this place existed in Rio Rancho. I would order my usual Chicken Vermicilli Noodles. As of these past couple of years, I've tried to be more adventurous and order other items on the menu. Today, I ordered the chicken Vietnamese spring rolls, an avocado shake, and the chicken broken rice dish. All the food lacked in freshness, even my shake had a brown spot! The \"fresh\" spring rolls were not fresh. The sprouts in the roll were browning, nearing being rotted. The chicken was stringy and dry, and the rice paper was chewy like rubber. The peanut sauce is the only condiment that gave this unappealing appetizer some life. I chose to order the broken rice dish because according to the menu it comes with a side of vegetables. Ive been trying to incorporate more veggies into my diet but I laughed when I received my order. My vegetables consisted of a leaf of lettuce, four slices of cucumber, a few strings of carrot and jicama. Lastly, my avocado shake was tasty as usual but as I mentioned before, it had a brown spot (maybe made with an old avocado)? I truly want to support local Rio Rancho businesses but I also want to be fair to my fellow Yelpers and to the restaurant owners... it will be important to maintain quality and freshness in their food. Otherwise more and more folks will continue to drive down the hill to Albuquerque.  On a positive note, their raw beef pho is the best I've had and that dish was fresh. I guess just like we have our good and bad days, so do restaurants like Viet Rice!"}, {"review_id": "rwfXjf_KKvl5ASXLYge2kw", "user_id": "5AG7yvoCMZpb9yaGlAVWJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "Best pho in Rio Rancho and better than many places around Albuquerque.
