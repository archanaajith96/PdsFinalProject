Their pizza is tasty classic New Haven style without the pretentious-ness of some of the better known spots. They have lots of different types, but I always go for the funghi. Da Legna is also a secret gem for brunch. I've tried all the brunch pizzas and love them all, though I'm very pleased with the lox quantity and the pizza with mashed potato.Decent local beer list. You'll find something you want to drink, including their new collaboration and first beer!Quick service. Sometimes competitive for a table, and waiting at the bar can be tight. It's also on the louder side but still great for small or big groups."}, {"review_id": "wTeS5Zuto4AMOXbR7taOXA", "user_id": "rAhR6ZoEjde7IKvPW7oCjg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Their Pizza by itself is probably a 5, if you overlook cost. Pome of the pizzas are incredible, but they're a bit pricey. It's best to go with a pair of people or small group, get Tapas and a couple pies to share.Da Legna shines by having pies with vastly different toppings than the rest of New Haven, allowing it to create a perfect niche for itself among tough competition.Honestly Da Legna is a great place to bring out of town friends or a date. The small plate setup and unique pizza offerings make it one of the less conventional and most delicious restaurants around."}, {"review_id": "z6e9-ib8Zd0UuO0LC0Lfwg", "user_id": "xCFxH1cITD1mIro4AV0H5Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "When you're in the vicinity of Pepe's and Modern it's tough to really compete, but this place surprisingly holds it own. With pizza it's tough, because everyone had their own preference of what *type* of pizza they prefer. Let me say this place is maybe a hybrid of all of them. The pizza is delicious and the crust is crispy yet doughy (that was my favorite part of the meal). Bottom LineDon't think just because Pepe's and Modern is right in town that you should skip over these guys. This place is delicious and in its own right stands out against the others. Definitely recommend."}, {"review_id": "uW1xN-mDFIsDw1xxK4huVQ", "user_id": "Ib3uXHSWeBed2kK-BKLGSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Absolutely delicious. Best vegan pizza I've ever had. Waited about 20 minutes for a table on a Saturday night in April. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. My mom ordered the lasagna while my dad and I shared a custom vegan pizza. We had large vegan cheese pizza with red sauce, vegan pepperoni, peppers, mushrooms, basil and garlic. Each slice was perfectly equally topped with toppings! I was so impressed! It was delicious. The dough was charred but so doughy with that salty bite. I would say these pizzas are doughy-er than most New Haven pizza places. But god it was delicious! My dad who loves a thin crust LOVED this doughy pizza! The pepperoni was delicious and better than meat pepperoni in my opinion. The cheese was so convincing that I thought it was real cheese at first. We will definitely be back!!"}, {"review_id": "y1MBTdP59Zwh0IvSLH92IA", "user_id": "mDIiJFbG5cNz9-taiGAASQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "There's just something about New Haven pizza. Perhaps it's the chewy dough, the most-perfect amount of cheese, or even the slight char. I really can't put a finger on it but it's likely a combination of things that make New Haven my go-to pizza spot...even when I no longer live in CT.There are so many awesome pizza places all over the country. But you haven't really had *real* pizza until you've at least had a bite of what New Haven has to offer. Now I know everyone has their favorite spot; whether it's Pepe's (my favorite), Modern, Sally's...but Da Legna most certainly ranks high on the best pie I've ever had. I won't give it 5 stars because Pepe's has my heart (and the prices are a bit steep for the sizes). However, this place makes a killer pizza. Deliciously chewy crust with the infamous slight-char, slightly tangy sauce, and a perfectly proportioned amount of cheese. If you still haven't tried the pizza here, you better run on over...even if you live 2 hours away like me. I promise you it's worth your time."}, {"review_id": "vnc7EM-6sL3MDYOtwPyrVg", "user_id": "QqZoiKd2lT4Joec-E6YCyw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "I'm a New Yorker and, while my favorite slice is in my city, my favorite pizza is in New Haven at Da Legna.  The fungi pizza is perfection made out of flawless wood-fired crust, burrata, ricotta, mushrooms, and truffle oil.  While the fungi is my all-time favorite.  The other pizzas also have a lot to offer in terms of deliciousness (particularly the Clark Street).  Splitting a pizza and a salad with a good friend makes for a five-star meal.  My favorite salad of theirs is the blackberry burrata - so many fun flavors that party in your mouth.  Plus the atmosphere is nice and the service always friendly."}, {"review_id": "dmFe5jCuMm_Tuh7T45FBmw", "user_id": "8FDeCOicvjKbzTytSldIBg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/15/2017", "text": "I came here with a friend after hearing all these wonderful things about this place!To make this story short: this place has honestly one of the best pizza's I have had in CT. It has a lot of competition in the area from bar, sallys and modern pizza but still holds its own. So what makes this place different then the other new haven pizza spots? ..Da Legna serves an innovative variety of new haven style thin crust pizzas. You can go as basic as the Margherita pizza or go fancy and order a pizza with different types of protein such as prosciutto and various other meats, even a pizza with truffle honey if your feeling adventurous.After moments of contemplating on the many speciality pizza options I decided to go for the state pizza. This was a combination of pepperoni, mushrooms, meatballs, bacon, sausage, peppers, onions and garlic. The pizza was baked to perfection with a perfect buttery crust, and cheesy goodness, you just cannot go wrong!While the quality of the pizza is amazing the prices were a little high. Also parking may be an issue but that is as to be expected in new haven. Will be returning soon!"}, {"review_id": "0d2-czSE0Px6h3WDGUuWWA", "user_id": "XhGpTNuBRr8qReua3yyhvQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Excellent service and ambience - worthy competition to Modern Pizza down the road - try it !!"}, {"review_id": "467R2zLgvehUBWeY2YLxaw", "user_id": "Mfhk2DbSVUHGUWPqv1tH1A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "A unique twist on delicious classics. Da legna is another one of the well established pizza joints in NH and it rightfully deserves all the praise. The pizza here is great and they serve delicious thin crust pizzas topped with both your traditional items as wells more modern flavor creations. We ordered the honeypot and Marinko. The honeypot was a unique pie: tomato, sliced hot peppers, onions, mozzarella, and thinly sliced sopprasetta topped with a drizzle of truffle honey. Now, what sounds strange was actually super delicious. The ingredients all work well together, you have spicy peppers, salty/tangy sopprasetta and the aromatic and sweet truffle honey that just tames all the strong flavors and mellows out your taste buds. This pie is highly recommended.The Marinko is a meat lovers pie. topped with all the meats you can think of. None of which was over powering or overtly salty. It was great classic meat pie. Both pies had a delicious thin crunchy chewy crust. The center of pie was not soggy and it was floppy. Overall, an all around delicious pizza. If you want to try something different aside from the classics, come and give De Legna a try. Also, don't just come here b/c you couldn't get a seat at Modern. TBH, De legna is just as good and in the case of some pies, they're even better!*You also order via an IPad which is pretty awesome. You can see pictures of all the menu items and you still have the option of talking to your waiter/waitress."}, {"review_id": "vYjVHGHMiBHiZNZJugOKyw", "user_id": "RCBnPqv-QDjQ_HPJO8oWVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "This place has outstanding pizza and a great atmosphere. The pizza is light, crispy, and packed with flavour. There are tons of different topping options including vegan/vegetarian \"meats\" and cheeses. The margherita pizza is a must-try.  The cheese and sauce are both perfect and it is seasoned well with garlic and basil. The potato and bacon pie can be made with vegetarian bacon, which I tried and was rich and delicious. The pasta fagioli soup is packed with pasta and was a satisfying starter that was vegetarian friendly. The chipwich for dessert is a sandwich of ice cream surrounded by warm fresh cookies. There are many pizza places to try in New Haven. Da Legna may very well be the best of them all. The service and atmosphere are also outstanding. Dining here is a really great experience.

Since the pizza had some heat, there was no way I could make out even the remotest hint of truffle.  It could have been plain 'ole clover honey from a SueBee Honey Bear for all I know.Also got a Margherita, and while it wasn't special and could've used more mozzarella, I appreciated that it reheated really well.  Surprisingly, my favorite was the Tonno, which perfectly balanced the distinctive flavor of tuna with its other ingredients.Fwiw, we began with an Arugula Salad topped with Burrata and Blackberries that turned out to be an unwitting ace backing my insistence to hubby that most of the time, restaurant starter salads aren't worth it.  Sure once in awhile, you wind up with with something really revelatory, but 99.9 percent of the time you wish you'd ordered the Fried Mozzarella Sticks or their equivalent instead.  This was one of those times.  Other random thoughts:  I liked the relaxed ambience v. the mayhem I usually encounter at Pepe's.  Lush that I am, I also appreciated the fact that this spot serves cocktails v. mediocre wine and beer at Pepe's.  Too bad I couldn't detect even a hint of tea flavor in the Matcha cocktail I chose.:(TL;DR:  If you're into creative pizza toppings and a diverse menu, you could do a whole lot worse than eating here.  But don't go expecting it to change your life or anything like that."}, {"review_id": "h7JsU5nQcAp5NGb54nLRBQ", "user_id": "0auqluusTrYQ0mEVUWbFvQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/21/2017", "text": "So far my favorite pizza in CT.

I've never had a vegan pizza, but it was honestly made so well that I couldn't tell the cheese was vegan at all.  The crust was perfectly charred and the dough had a lot of taste.  I'm not a crust guy, so the fact that my plate was empty after 5 slices is very telling.  To top it all off, we split one shot of Orangcello and one shot of lemoncello.  Both were the perfect ending to a perfect meal.Our waitress at the bar, Taylor, was polite, fun to talk with and looked a bit like Alanis Morissette.  The vibe in the restaurant was homey, especially on a cold night, and comfortable to spend time in.  The volume level from the crowd was actually pretty tame for a Saturday and it was great that didn't need to fight over obnoxious voices to have a nice conversation with my girlfriend.For the bottle of wine, the salad, the pizza and the limon/orangecello's it cost about $70 (which is incredible for how terrific the food was and how much we got).I'll be back to try Da Legna's regular pizza in the near future, but based on the extraordinary service, food quality and atmosphere it will be sooner rather than later!"}, {"review_id": "S6rn4hOeproHFYM6S02zBw", "user_id": "CDDFzJTqqtf6IIcfgQmv4w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "I had high hopes for this place and I have to say I was completely and utterly disappointed in both the food and service.We started with the Stilton salad, which was delicious by all means, and the poached pear salad, which was also good, but the walnuts on the salad were not candied, but instead thoroughly burnt to the point where I avoided eating them. Decided not to say anything because the salad was still good without them. As for the pizzas, we settled for the vegan pizza number 3 (with arugula, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, tomatoes, broccoli etc) as well as the vegan pizza number 7 (buffalo tofu and roasted red peppers). The pizza came out and both had the potential to be really amazing, except that pizza #3 was extremely burnt. I tried to let it go because I'm not one to complain, but after one piece I couldn't eat it anymore and told my waitress. She went on to say how she was sorry but apparently there is a disclaimer on the menu that says the pizzas may come out a bit charred due to the way they are cooked, some more than others, and there was nothing she could do about it. I begin scraping the toppings off of my pizza because I couldn't eat the crust. There are probably 2 pieces total that didn't have inedible crust. Some time later, who I presume to be the manager comes up to us as we are finishing up eating and offered a free pizza. No thanks, we were almost done already! He then proceeds to offer a free dessert. My friend doesn't eat dairy so that was a no go as well. Nothing was comped from the bill. All in all, 3 stars because there is potential here, but my experience didn't live up to it."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-legna-new-haven?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
