I want to like it more, but it just doesn't have the same oomph as Korean food in LA. ____________________Swung through with soondubu in mind because I'm riding out a cold. I'll be honest that I was dreaming a little of restaurants who focus on soondubu in LA, but I was glad to even see it on their menu. Also LOL because this was probably the largest gathering of Asians I've seen here aside from when a group of friends came to visit. Oh! And they take 10% off the final bill as their way of sharing God's love - such a great service, and very aligned with their branding because they also close early on Mondays to serve with a church ministry.FOOD/DRINKS-- Banchan: You get 4 items, but they're not the same for every party (I glanced over at the couple next to me and they had different stuff than what I got). Standard stuff.-- Soondubu with beef: Honestly, a little disappointing. Don't get me wrong - it tasted pretty good and was satisfying on a cold night, but the broth wasn't cleaned (skimmed) and didn't have much gochujang in it because it (1) wasn't spicy at all (I order mild anyway, but the menu said it would be spicy..) and (2) wasn't very red/opaque. The egg was already cracked into it too, which I don't mind but could see as an issue for someone with an allergy. Anywho, still satisfying, just a little lackluster.-- Salmon roll: I'm not really a sushi/raw fish person, but it wasn't great. The fish was room temp and the presentation was lacking. Could've passed on this. BUT I know this isn't a sushi restaurant (although they did have a sizeable list of rolls for not being a sushi restaurant...), and I did appreciate that the waiter let me know it would take a little longer when I ordered.-- Orange for dessert: They bring you half an orange per person that's cut up and it comes with a little umbrella. It's lends a quirky and homey touch to the end of the meal.STAFFFriendly and polite but busy - maybe a little short staffed?SPACE/LOCATIONStreet parking. There's a lot off the side of the building but I don't think much of it is theirs. The wait can be long and there's not much space to stand around to wait. I came in on a Saturday evening right around 6 and the place was packed. If you don't mind that though, they're very quick to clear and clean tables once a party leaves."}, {"review_id": "qx6CZ_l8ZgMxZPRj3JeZKQ", "user_id": "OKRpYU4iqKthmYeNHVemzQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "Their contribution to feeding the homeless in Salem is well documented.

This is the worst Korean food I have ever eat in my life! I am an Asian, and love to eat Chinese, Japanese, and Korean food. But for Happy Bibimbap House, I will never eat here again! I ordered House special combo box with short ribs. The ribs are really hard to chew so I have to spit it out to my plate. My friend ordered noodles, it just like instant noodle that everyone can buy for 99 cents, and cook with some carrots! Overall, the food is horrible! I have heard they serve food for homeless every Monday, that's where the one star is earned! I am thinking, if they cannot serve good food or even eatable food for people who paid to eat, what kind of food will they serve to homeless people?"}, {"review_id": "DCAsQkTOvJuS3lyw70pGuA", "user_id": "HiXuhQdHHvEnNcKerLrOaw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "If I could culturally appropriate a culture, Korean culture would be in the top 100 for sure.

Tonight was not its finest moment. First, patiently waited to be seated. Stood at front for 10 minutes- No problem. Got seated in back room and no menus. Server came to get order 10 min later- So we waited again. Made order- ordered sushi, server suggested they were busy and it would take long. We later decided just to order it. Food came and forgot the Kalbi ribs. It was a struggle to get things like water, soda, fork, etc....Food was not the same. Something off. Usually satisfied, tonight was just not its best moment. Server explained that she needed to go to other table and then come back to give us kimchee. Explain that we had an order of Kalbi - \"Oh, I didn't hear that.\" But I did across the table and it seems like we it was a hassle to request more kimchee. I get that your short handed, but win over with customer service and a smile. Especially when we been here over 20 times introducing more to this spot. Might just travel out of Salem for Korean Food. Hope they do better next time. Maybe some extra server will get their spirits up.15 minutes later...and this edit - And then here comes the owner who saves the experience with her hospitality and smile. Had to pick this up to 4 stars from the original 2 stars! This is what we have come to expect.

That's about it, unfortunately.  No refills - they'd say sure, and it'd never come.  The food we ordered was ok (bibimbap) to really bad (galbi).  The worst galbi I've ever had in my life and I feel bad saying this because this place tries. They are just not ordering any ingredients that aren't bottom of the barrel. Tough, gristly, inedible - a quarter of the galbi is meat, a quarter fat, rest gristle and bone.  And it was near impossible to chew through it; some we left there, some we swallowed in large pieces.  And $17 for it isn't \"well priced\" - it's an ok price for a on the larger side of totally inedible meat.  Order better meat, offer less of it, or charge more.  And don't price items on the menu without taking banchan refills into account - this is standard Korean restaurant etiquette!  Not that banchan issues aren't a huge problem all throughout the Willamette Valley.Super disappointing, and the 10% off the bill isn't really a fix or makes me want to do anything but warn people off.  The owner (I think) and waitress both came out, said sorry and told us to enjoy our meal as a response. Um. The quality of the food ingredients was so low that we started worrying whether the oranges they bring with the check were ok - are the umbrellas reused? It looks like the umbrellas are reused.
