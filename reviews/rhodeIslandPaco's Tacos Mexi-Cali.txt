I was close to walking out. There were two women behind the counter, one at the register doing very little other than ring up orders and the other doing all the work in the kitchen. Were they short-staffed? Were the women not capable of working together to get the orders moving more quickly? What was the problem? Add to this the fact that the restaurant was so cold that we ate in our car. Was the heat on???Having said this, the food was friggin' great and affordable. I will give this place another shot because I'll do anything for good mexican food like this place serves, and besides this is a great little out-of-the-way mom and pop type shop that makes the Chipotles of the world look like what they are: bland purveyors of crap. We should all support these kinds of small, local businesses that put their own individual touches on the food they serve. I want more Paco's in the world, but they have to give me a bit better service the next time I come (please!)."}, {"review_id": "yaAitgziDMUAGYqh3GW3-w", "user_id": "PGD0YwdRS57zAXZmj1OkQQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "This was the best random pitstop.  Since moving to New England from L.A., it's been a big struggle to find good Mexican (or even Mexican-American) food.  This place's self-designated title of Mexi-Cali is quite accurate--it almost tasted like we were back in California!  My party each got different burritos, and they were all good.  Decently sized as well.  The best we've had in the North East, and we'd come back if we didn't live so far away.  For real.  I know it's random, just believe me.The home-made salsas weren't all great though... and they came in too-tiny containers.  I'm usually a green salsa person, but I thought it lacked flavor, and actually preferred the red.  It would be nice if they just put them in squeeze containers or self-serve scoop stations so you can get the one you want in the quantity that you want.Get thee to Paco's if you can, and get thee a burrito.  It will be muy delicioso."}, {"review_id": "u2FRYfiUvrVss-tvRFtreg", "user_id": "tvLA159SsQgYJug4mDEtzw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Yummy Tex Mex, which s hard to find for this Vegas girl in New England!When he said he styled his crispy tacos after Robertos, I knew exactly what to order!"}, {"review_id": "j5hN4aFfSEpVy6yhz2_PHQ", "user_id": "i_SHm_KjSYQw-5M-r2-yvw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Paco's was nothing special.

The first time I had one of their burritos I experienced a burrito unlike anything I had eaten in over 25 years. It was their California Burrito. And I am  well travelled and fell qualified to make the above statement. Their Tres Leches dessert is to stop your heart or die for. Well done across the board.

First time i had the torta and i must say it was the best torta i've ever had , so naturally as i got hungrier later that day i decided to order paco's on uber eats but maybe try something different! This time i ordered their crispy chicken tacos and a pork chimichanga and tres leches cake for desert . I know , i know ! Thats alot of food for just one person ! But i was hungry and that torta had left a great impression on me ! I received my food at a timely manner and although the food was good it was not as great as the torta and they forgot to give me any utensils. Would i be back? Ofcourse i will! But only for the torta . Everything else was average! The tres leche came was pretty great too!"}, {"review_id": "WMafIaWUxZ4Cyda2-uuKNg", "user_id": "AmW5t2LjZb2zKKdyztxeoQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/5/2017", "text": "Just moved to RI recently and was in the Warwick area when my husband wanted to grab dinner. Looked up anything close by on Yelp and found this place and decided to check it out. It was empty when we walked in but had a few groups walk in by the time we were finishing up. Got excited when I saw California Burrito so I got that; and they have Jarritos! Not only that, they had my favorite Jarritos: fruit punch! I really don't see that one except at Latino markets.The CA burrito: awesome! Great carne asada with crispy fries. The size of the burrito was pretty big and was surprised I actually finished it since I didn't feel that hungry. They have a variety of hot sauces on the table such as 3 types of Cholula sauce, Tapatio, and a few others. My favorite was the Cholula green pepper salsa; added a nice kick to my burrito! They also had  homemade red and green salsas on the side; they were good but wished it was spicier. Can't say anything about the tacos since I didn't get any but look good. My husband also ordered some Poblano rings, which was an interesting take on ring-shaped fried foods. Very tasty!All in all, a solid place for CA burritos and have a feeling I'll be back here the next time I'm in Warwick."}, {"review_id": "RojkJ8uLOTnmN10L2lnUFQ", "user_id": "H7_6Xbh4VxqLbzavqKg_0g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "So, so good!

We ordered three tacos, the pepper rings. The shrimp tacos contained maybe two shrimp per taco and the other tacos were equally skimp on the proteins. I think the pepper rings were very unique and crispy, but I could barely take more than a few bite given how salty it was.  The staff seemed nice, but the lady up front was new and couldn't give us much information. At the end of the day, even though there were some cute outdoor seating, the view to the open road was less than picture perfect and I will think twice before returning here."}, {"review_id": "ZzgaavIMttn_NcQK-DBwZQ", "user_id": "oJEM0j96AecUPR0POvTkgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/21/2017", "text": "Knew they had a food truck didn't know there was a restaurant .

Thankfully it is right next door to my favorite pizza place, so I am never without delicious food options! Paco's serves a variety of California style Mexican dishes- think taquitos, burritos, churros and delicious nachos. Prices are very reasonable especially for the portion sizes. I recommend trying the fried poblanos as an appetizer and the steak asada nachos for entree or to share with friends. So flavorful! I also overheard the cook saying that the food does not contain cilantro- I know many people hate the taste so that's something to note. The seating is bench style- so you may have to share a table with another party; but I gather that it's mostly a take-out spot since I haven't seen the place packed. Give this place a chance!

I know his is starch on starch, but this is delicious.Shrimp Tacos, Bowls, and multiple other California Mexican dishes are on the menu.  I only was able to kill a burrito since the thing was bigger than my forearm and I was stuffed.We ordered a side of Poblano Rings (Poblano Peppers sliced into Onion Ring style slices and fried) which were a great starter.I highly recommend checking it out.  Only issue I had was the place was not very well heated so whenever the door opens the cold breeze cut you like a knife.  Just bring a jacket and enjoy getting stuffed."}, {"review_id": "gD_H69UEN1qlKUJyEnP1kg", "user_id": "KF8QNsxNTdpB8TE405KOPg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "Great, made fresh, Mexican food!  Large menu selection including some not so common Mexican foods and great ingredients.

The staff was great!12/29/2017  Just had another great meal. This is our third time. It's 16 degrees outside, not much warmer inside. Had to eat with our winter coats and hats on. The food was as great as the previous two times we ate there. Just wasn't as enjoyable sitting and eating in that cold of an environment.
