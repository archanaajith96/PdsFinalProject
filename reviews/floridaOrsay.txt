If I could come back by myself just to enjoy everything on the menu I would! To start off, a group of 9 girls is an absolute distraction to my love affair for your food. It tastes absolutely divine. Orsay offers French cuisine and oh boy, do they deliver high quality food! I came here for brunch on a Saturday. What a delightful experience! Their menu is extensive, perfect for when you have absolutely no idea what you are craving. Their french toast is unreal, buttery toast with a semi crisp that doesn't dampen and fall apart when drizzled with maple syrup. I ordered an an omelette (Lardons Et Cheddar - eden farms bacon, aged cheddar, thyme ) as well as my favorite: shrimp and grits (Wild Local Shrimp And Anson Mills Grits - roasted corn, jalapeno, and eden farms bacon relish). The omelette had a generous amount of thick baby chunks of bacon per bite and was perfectly paired with a side salad to make you feel better about your gluttonous bacon loving lifestyle. The shrimp and grits were nothing short of perfect. It wasn't a boring meal at all! It was fresh and had vibrant colors, a rare picture of when I take one of shrimp and grits. The usual shrimp and grits have a unilateral flavor; you get a delicious gravy flavor with every bite of shrimp. Unlike the others, Orsay offers the shrimp n grits that had a well balanced \"meaty\" taste (alas, more bacon chunks). The corn and tomatoes added texture and complexity to the dish so the meaty flavor didn't seem so heavy. I absolutely fell in love with this dish!Finally, the creme brûlée. Just dig in. No disappointments here. I just wish I had more room in my belly for more desserts!"}, {"review_id": "80yU1vhndQ8guw6fxlDhIQ", "user_id": "hy1taOP0VzQ9rTSLs0uDyg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "I've heard SO many great things about Restaurant Orsay and I am blessed I had the opportunity to stop by this past Sunday. We ended up as a group of four, for Luke's sister's 21st birthday, and we had such a great brunch experience. Not only was the food amazing, the service was superb!I made a reservation via Open Table for 12:15, to be on the safe side. Luke and I arrived around 20 minutes early but sat right away. We relaxed until the rest of the party arrived. I was able to take in the cute, quaint layout, wasn't too opulent but simple enough to get the job done.Upon the arrival of Luke's sister, Jon brings out 4 complimentary glasses of champagne for her birthday! This was a wonderful gesture, especially the fact the entire table had a drink to toast her 21st!We then order some drinks, chat, share an appetizer of escargot and our food comes out. The drinks were marvelous and very tasty! I ordered the Siren's Song for myself, and the combination of fruits and tart with the champagne was a refreshing start to my day. The Escargot was cooked to perfection, and I LOVED the bed of mushrooms the shells came on.My main entree was the bourbon and orange French toast. The baguette soaked up enough egg, and there was enough orange to give it that \"oomph\" to stand out from a basic French toast to something amazing.I would LOVE to visit Orsay again- probably for Happy Hour! Bruch weighed heavy on my wallet, but totally worth it!"}, {"review_id": "k2O-8mSOuHlv7lFSX5jCMg", "user_id": "AMrhEi4bLvaAcC2XggeBsg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Great spot for elegant dining, seafood and French cuisine. If you're looking for quality seafood with an upscale feel, this is the place for you. The restaurant is pretty small and fills up quick, it's a popular spot for date night and group celebrations so make sure to have a reservation if you're really counting on eating here. I had the PEI mussels with fries and creme brûlée for dessert. I absolutely love my shellfish and it's awesome that they source from Prince Edward Island in Canada. The white wine and garlic butter sauce complemented the mussels and enhanced their natural flavors. The creme brûlée was also delicious, perfectly crispy sugar top with smooth and creamy creme underneath. Overall, this place is one of my favorite date night spots in Riverside."}, {"review_id": "vuzcyOq9PL4-QDSmDjz-pA", "user_id": "tmIy-aMn3W5eySu0IaaoNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "We came for happy hour and sat on the couches.

First time was for brunch, where I enjoyed the food and the alcoholic beverages. The second time was for happy hour. For HH, I only had drinks and shared appetizers. Both times I sat at the bar. That being said, I don't have a solid opinion on their dinner menu at a regular table with waitstaff, because I have only been served by the bartenders. The bartenders and particularly the manager, Joshua, have been friendly and helpful when ordering. When asking for recommendations, staff members had plenty of options to recommend and their personal opinion on each.While there, I had the oysters and French onion soup. Oysters were great but the French onion soup was truly divine. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I will definitely be having dinner here as soon as I can."}, {"review_id": "_uSRGBKCNcieXN6R0TVnRQ", "user_id": "9uPAZL6Akjg81gtG89nrPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Deep in the heart of Avondale off Park Street, one might not naturally think of Restaurant Orsay as ideal for small plates, I am absolutely obsessed with their Cocktail Hour menu as it has a little bit of something for everyone.   The menu is essentially their Happy Hour menu, but has an expanded menu of small plate options for extremely reasonable prices and discounts on their various craft cocktails.  On Saturdays, they have Cocktail Hour from 11 AM - 7 PM, so naturally, that's my favorite day to hit up Orsay.  Amongst these small plate options includes their always delicious Potato Croquettes, the very popular Steak Tartare, and incredible Oyster's Orsay, topped with smoked salmon roe, crème fraiche, lemon, and finished with micro greens.  However, I'd be remiss if I didn't highlight my favorite small plate on their menu, the Mac 'N' Cheese with black truffles and Mornay sauce, which comes in an adorable miniature cast iron pot with oozy cheesy goodness that's brought out hot and bubbling.  This is a must-order dish!    If you can't make it for Cocktail Hour, have no fear....they still have plenty of small plate options available as appetizers on their standard dinner menu that are sure to leave you satisfied.  In addition to their superb raw bar offerings (tartare, oysters, calamari, etc.), they also have a lot of the same options that are on the Cocktail Hour menu (although with a steeper price-tag attached unfortunately).  Saturday brunch = winning.  I'd highly advise making reservations (you can make them through Open Table), especially for brunch.  For all of the small plate fans out there, try to stick to the Cocktail Hour menu so you have a wide variety of options (and your wallet won't feel the pain).  Cocktail hour = 4-7 PM daily & on Saturdays = 11 AM-7 PM.  Corkage fee is $15."}, {"review_id": "0_GgTMDFqnHoxF4Gy2AFSA", "user_id": "-IwXD0Ii6qrK5SGe_WogBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "High-end French cuisine, but GO FOR HAPPY HOUR.  Their happy hour is the best in town, because you can make reservations, sit anywhere in the restaurant, and still get the happy hour pricing and menu.  Most higher-end places don't let you do reservations and/or make you sit at the bar, but Orsay is really accommodating with their happy hour.  Their small plates-esque happy hour is perfect for sharing with friends, and their cocktails are amazing!  My favorite is their classic gin & tonic, and a second favorite would be Hey Jealousy.  Try them both!I've been for a few fancy meals, and I've always been impressed.  One that stands out is when my husband and I had a great bottle of wine, and for my birthday, he made a reservation with the name and vintage of the wine, and they really went out of their way to make sure our meal paired with the wine, even changing some of the dishes.  They gave us complimentary glasses of champagne when we sat down (I think this may be something they do for all big celebrations, but I'm not sure), and they went above and beyond the whole night to make sure we had a great evening.I've also been there with some friends after work for happy hour, and they treat us exactly the same.  They are always pleasant and welcoming, even if you're not the big spender and are just there for some happy hour specials and plan to leave before dinner.  I think that's what I most appreciate about Orsay - no matter when you show up, or what you're planning to spend, they never make you feel like you're not important."}, {"review_id": "3W1DshztgooSDk0-YYpMmA", "user_id": "4sUwhhWyR1Bt8B5IfB8z_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I should've written this review a long time ago! Orsay is one of the BEST restaurants in Jacksonville. It's one of my husband and I's top 3. It's one of the places we go to celebrate something or to treat ourselves. We've never been disappointed!Today we went for brunch, and it was spectacular. I had the eggs ala Orsay, which is their eggs benedict. The eggs and hollandaise were absolute perfection. The prosciutto was thin, crispy, and delicious. It was served with shaved truffles on top, which was the perfect touch and not too overpowering. It's served with lyonnaise potatoes (which is basically cooked with onions and white wine). I also tried some of their pastries and a latte. Everything was awesome and I can't wait to go again!Normally when we go for dinner, I love the pan roasted fish. It's served on grits with lobster butter and it's always perfect. It's hard for me to get something else, but their croque madame, steak tartare, mussels, and oysters are all great.The service is second to none. We always feel like friends are waiting on us. Even when we bring our toddlers, they are welcomed and well cared for. Excellent suggestions are always made.You can never go wrong with Orsay."}, {"review_id": "2DYXpAHGmVCi1KPaDcL7Xg", "user_id": "Qa2SGSbqqP1E7iqnQ-9vXQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Purely one of the best, if not the best dining experience in Jacksonville.  Orsay bills itself as a French restaurant~ but it is so much more.  This place is the best brunch spot this side of the River but as far as date nights are concerned- it can't be beat.  Start with the atmosphere:  there are two dining rooms done in a somewhat modern style.  The bar area is beautiful classical designed straight bar ( best set up from my bar tending experience ).  The bartenders know what they are doing.  Every cocktail that comes out of that bar is on point 100% of the time.  Add a great wine list to phenomenal cocktails and you have drinks at Orsay!What about the food mon ami?It is tres bien!Ok so my attempt at humor  here is a little lame but this place is a 10 guys.  Seriously, this place has something for everyone.  My favorite dishes to order are the beef stroganoff , best I have ever had, the steak and eggs and the pork chop for Sunday brunch.......   Let's talk about this pork chop shall we?  It is pounded thin then lightly battered and fried.  Served with an egg and potatoes - it's good enough to make an atheist find religion.The staff-Everyone who works here is a menu expert and delivers fantastic service.  The key to making it as a waiter starts with menu knowledge and ends with personality, these servers have both in spades. Shouts out to Tony- some of the best service ever.  I was very impressed with the relationship the front of the house and the kitchen share.  They operate like they are the same team- if you have ever worked in restaurants you know how rare that is.  You will NEVER have a bad experience here.Listen friend- do yourself and whoever is important to you in your life a flavor...errr favor- and make the pilgrimage to Orsay for amazing everything"}, {"review_id": "xh1gS8_cVTEX9lCXbOkxHA", "user_id": "3d4fac-e3Plyib8QUEmHNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "This was my last meal in Jacksonville, and OMG - a great way to end my trip.

Then it was also served with red onion marmalade, oh geez lol so good!!!! I wish I still had some...sigh. My friend got the French Onion, which I had a taste of it - it was perfect! Very delicious. My wife enjoyed her Sea Scallop Tartare and Bouillabaisse as well, although I prefer a more brothy bouillabaisse - still tasty though. Very enjoyable meal, and our waiter was awesome too.

A MUST FOR BRUNCH is the biscuits and gravy. LIFECHANGER. You may think you've the best elsewhere, but Orsay's is THEE BEST. Homemade biscuits and a really rich and luxurious gravy. What I love about their gravy is that it's not super thick, and the thickness comes from the generous amount of sausage and onions. The flavor is also more herbaceous than traditional southern gravy. I also love that they don't pour the gravy over the biscuits so that you still get some of the crisp, golden brown deliciousness and it's not soggy nor mushy. All of their omelettes are really good and decent portion. My other fav is the Eggs a la Orsay cuz how can you not like eggs benny?! In addition to brunch classics, their full bar and good majority of the dinner menu is available. Brunch service is also just a great."}, {"review_id": "NDoUEoN28p3xI14oQsOaDQ", "user_id": "m9RSjJRuwNud2elncMWf2w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "I have been putting off visiting this place for E V E R and finally had the chance to go in.

Oh, Orsaaaayyyyyy!Although I have been eyeing Orsay for a while now, It actually wasn't part of the plan to eat dinner here tonight. We wanted some ramen and, after finding out they were closed on Mondays, we stumbled onto Orsay's doorstep. Best unplanned visit. Ever. I am so happy that the ramen shop was closed! Who needs noodles swimming in oily broth when you can delve into various dishes made from (what I can only assume) is heaven's kitchen. Dinner time on a Monday night was pretty quiet, so it's a good time to visit.I was overwhelmed with the menu, I won't lie to you. It's physically big and packed to brim with a wide variety of French cuisine. Frankly, as a girl who eats Publix subs regularly and whose idea of indulgence is eating another Drumstick ice cream cone, this place is just fancier than what I am used to. I can usually pick what I want right away from a menu, but I had a hard time deciding here. But...I was willing to pretend like I order $31 dishes on the daily. It helped that the waiter was very knowledgeable about the portion sizes and the ingredients.  We started out by splitting a hot plate of escargot paired with some beautifully sautéed mushrooms. It's a simple dish - escargot, butter, lemon. But it packs amazing flavor! I got creative and poured the butter leftover in the shells onto some bread. It may not be perfect table side manners, but I fully encourage sopping! But can we talk about the star of the night? My entree. I'm salivating as I am reliving this moment in my head. I was torn between the Scallops, Carolina Trout, and Pan Roasted Fish. When my friend decided on the trout and I found out the scallops were a small portion, I landed on the Pan Roasted Fish. Dude, when my dish came out, my eyes lit up! Clearly sight is the wrong sense, but (check out the picture I posted) even the very look of it can satiate your hunger. When you take little bites of each ingredient...together the flavors just explode in your mouth. The crispy fish is evened out by the mushiness of the grits. The sweetness of the corn is evened out by the speckles of bacon. And the surprise flavor that anchored it all turned out to be Lobster roe butter! Did I taste a bit of sour atop the Upland cress too? We tried each other's food and equally decided that my dish was the winner of the two. Flavorful! Masterful! I don't ever get dessert. But I just wanted more. Creme brûlée was delectable. I'm not a huge sweets person, so it was a bit too rich for me. Which is why sharing that bad boy was warranted! Fantastic meal. I'm coming back. That's all I can say."}, {"review_id": "8USOPCZPbev8wX2wIwdNnQ", "user_id": "s7z5o9wS1EhN0G_ebiCIrg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Best. Brunch. Ever.

Service is above and beyond the standard.  Food is incomparable. We like to come during happy hour (4 pm to 7 pm), sit at the bar, and get a few things from their discounted happy hour menu. Tonight, I tried the seasonal sweet potato mule. It was refreshing and flavorful. We had our standard trois foie mousse (a must try), the scallop tartare, and the roasted oysters. Everything was delicious. Hubs added to his repertoire the banh mi sandwich which he swore was amazing. I was unable to stuff anything more down my gullet since we were pretty stuffed.

Well my first question after visiting you the other night was \"How have I never been here before?!\" Because goodness me! This place was extraordinary. For any of you reading this review, if you are debating whether to go here or not spare the luscious details and start heading to Orsay now! You won't regret it. But anyhow, about my personal experience: I decided to come for a take-myself-out kinda date night and I wanted to take advantage of Orsay's happy hour (which runs from 4-7). If this is your first time, this is a really great way to check out the place. So, that being said, this review is based on my happy hour experience which was lovely. I was kindly greeted upon arrival from the bartenders and was given a double sided \" Cocktail hour menu. All cocktails are $8 which is a splendid price for the quality of the drinks. I ordered the Hey Jealousy , which is a gin based cocktail and without any hint of exaggeration, that was the best cocktail I've had in the last 3-4 months. As for food, I was a bit overwhelmed by what to choose. Everything looked so good and I was really quite conflicted. I started off with a half dozen order of the east coast oysters. They were from Maine and were so fresh! For my second order,  I decided upon the Bresaola ( which is like a little personal pizza ) with fresh Parmesan, tomatoes and arugula. They really had quite the variety on their cocktail menu so I cannot wait to try something new next time I go!  So overall, what can I say? I left cheery, full and extremely thankful I finally decided to stop by. Thank you Orsay! Until next time!"}, {"review_id": "rrcLeYpTdaoki8zAk-rH5A", "user_id": "4e9-roUfqfa7fp3zdMKDvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "I had an unforgettable dinner at Orsay this past Friday. My wife and I had reservations for 6:30pm and were just in time for \"Cocktail Hour\" which is from 4 to 7pm. The Cocktail Hour menu features reduced price small plates and cocktails. This menu also included half priced Oysters which we were quick to order as a starter. Three different kinds of Oysters were being offered: One from the Gulf coast, one from the east coast, and one from the west coast (The west coast was not half priced). We ordered four of each. These were some of the best oysters I have ever tried. The oysters were very fresh, flavorful and paired perfectly with the in-house made sauces. Next we had the Escargot which were probably the best I have ever tried. The escargots were perfectly tender and served in the shell. The escargot lay on a bed of tender juicy mushrooms marinated in a lemon-garlic butter sauce. The mushrooms could have been an amazing appetizer by themselves but were taken to a whole other level when paired with the escargot. I had the Filet Mignon for the main course. The steak was tender, juicy and cooked a perfect medium rare. It was paired with a side of creamy truffled mashed potatoes, tender mushrooms, meaty bacon pieces, and crisp roasted Brussels sprouts. Finally, we finished dinner with Ice Cream which featured three scoops of in-house made ice creams. Ours included Pistachio, Strawberry, and Vanilla with Caramel and Cacao Nibs. The ice cream was phenomenal, creamy and sweet. During dinner we also had a good selection of cocktails. Overall, if you're looking to splurge, have a date night, or celebrate a special occasion, I highly recommend Orsay."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/orsay-jacksonville-4?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
