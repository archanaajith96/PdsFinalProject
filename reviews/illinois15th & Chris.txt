These burgers were delicious. If you want creative burgers this is the place. Their fries are also amazing. The way they are seasoned and fried are not your mommas fries but way better. Its got some sort of magic seasoning that definitely caught my attention as foodie.They also have shakes, hot dogs, and even ice cream. They are locally owned and even have a food truck as well. The burger I had was called the Royale and it had a beef patty and seasoned shrimp on it. It was worth the wait and I would have ordered more burgers to try but I wanted to contain myself for the next burger on there menu for next time.Overall, this place has great creative burgers and a unique flavor of fries to die for. They have  flavored shakes and ice cream as well. They are also involved in the community which is something this city needs. Good job guys!! I'm definitely coming back for more."}, {"review_id": "FUJAb4hWhgF1SHf_u4sxLA", "user_id": "EBVFwYeeG_CO3rBNEP84PA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Awesome place!

Place was clean, everything NEW, the whole area around the Restaurant is 5 star. BUT. PLEASE get some new pop mix or just sell cans. That pop mix tastes like total piss & the shake mix is old as hell, ( Hello 2018? Happy New Year old mix? Maaay ooold shake mix beee forgot). I had strawberry. BUT the food is Gourmet 100%. I'll be back here again soon (BYOP) Bring your own pop,lol).What an excellent diverse eating experience.Great Job 100%.."}, {"review_id": "-Oh3Y-7_5Ks2uogDllUQ0A", "user_id": "i6JiLIFlXWcKVkWJsUzO8w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/28/2017", "text": "This was surprisingly good! The burgers are cheap, the service is fast, and the fries are amazing!We got the 205 and the Boogie burger. Both had a very nice, soft bun, and had some good flavors. I felt like the flavor of the patty itself was a little lacking but it all came together well. For $8 you get the burger and fries. The fries are hot, crispy, and are rolled in Parmesan. They taste amazing! You could easily pay $6 for these by themselves at a restaurant. Additionally, we were able to get in and out within 15 minutes even though there was a line. That's fast service!Check this place out. It may not look like much when you first walk in but I was very pleasantly surprised."}, {"review_id": "EQfCmljEb_tSKjfZKhX7GA", "user_id": "c_9Xpqw-fdX0P-4xMgJexQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Heard about this place on the news, came to check it out while we were in town.

Fries are always awesome but I have to say..for the price you pay for the burgers they're pretty skimpy with the fries. Unless you get the combo with wings - then they're a little more generous. I remember the first year, the wings were huge and now they are pretty small and boney IMO. Still delicious. All in all, I'll keep coming back.

It's very small on the inside. No seating on the inside but there are a few picnic tables outside where you can sit & enjoy your meal. I always get the basket combo when i come to 15th & chris. The basket comes with a burger, fries, 2 jumbo wings & a 16oz drink! The burgers are a decent size. Fries are nice and thick, Very crunchy & amazing! The wings are freshly fried, lightly salted and crispy. The first time I came here, there were so many options to choose from. I tried the flaming Jack burger which was very good & not too spicy (at least for me). It had a good kick to it though. James (the owner) also gave me the option to have the wings tossed in either BBQ or hot sauce, instead I got them plain with the sauce on the side. He also gave me the option to have chz, bacon, etc on the fries but I also got those plain. After my first visit, I was hooked! I try to get different burgers each visit and the last time I was there, I tried his milkshakes. I was very indecisive so I told James to surprise me. He made a green apple caramel chocolate milkshake which was slightly weird but surprisingly very very delicious!"}, {"review_id": "TN36plSW-JmR4kylTnrpXw", "user_id": "aCaeBj_jZZlEP33MVrwwHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/3/2017", "text": "Great burgers and even better fries and wings! My husband got the 205 burger and I got the German Shepard as a basket with fries and hot barbeque wings. My husband's burger came with an order of fries, which we hadn't been expecting. I'm not sure if all their burgers come with fries as a standard, but it was a pleasant surprise if not. :)Both burgers were great, but let's talk about the wings. They were AMAZINGLY good. They were large and fried better than any other wing we've ever eaten from Wingstop to Buffalo Wild Wings. Super juicy and crispy! The spicy barbecue wasn't all that spicy, but it was damn good. We'd come back for the wings alone.And the fries? Hands down the best fries I ever had. There's some kind of dry seasoning thrown on the fries that's both cheesy and not overly salty. Whatever it is, we couldn't get enough of them!The staff is very kind and friendly. A young girl took our order and she was very polite and responsible for someone so young! One of the employees handed out a free sample of fries drizzled with barbecue sauce for the 8 customers in the shop to try as we walked for our orders! Great hospitality! We'll definitely be back again!"}, {"review_id": "sdivA7mtizUW5iBCAK5dzw", "user_id": "2HljfvKvPF-4VDhw-454Lg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/3/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "When the line is out the door at 11:30 you wait.

I had the Mackavelli burger it was sooooo juicy. It had BBQ sauce, mayo, cheese and onion rings on it. All the flavors balanced out so well. Not one flavor was overpowering.

Ive been hearing about this place for a few years now. I finally decided to take a trip in to see what its all about (yes i drive an hour + just to try a burger). It definitely didnt fail. The selection is great. The different styles and combinations of burgers and sandwiches is amazing. I had the 205 which is the burger, Italian beef, gardinera, melted mozz and onions. Everything was extremely fresh and the best part is the bun didnt get soggy and fall apart eddhich is very important.  Fries were out of this world. The owner James is great too. He made the whole experience worth while. Friendly ,professional and really down to earth. He came out multiple times and spoke and cracked jokez with me and my friends. Hes doing a great thing for an area that i lived in previously that doesnt always get the credit it deserves. Hats off to you sir for bringing phenomenal food and a place where everyone can get together and have a good time. I'll definitely be back sooner than later. If ypu havent been here i suggezt going ASAP. 1000% worth it"}, {"review_id": "AKg2yYqPEmZEB7zgPuTbBg", "user_id": "5KG825bHDNa1FgqOz4Y1mQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/1/2016", "text": "I kept seeing this place show up on my FB feed and heard so many good things about it. Definitely a one of a kind burger joint in town.Only open certain days and times, so make sure to go when they're open. My husband and I came here to try it out and he is a burger enthusiast. Always wanting to create his own, to his liking. I ended up getting the Wrecker combo that came with fries and 2 pieces of fried chicken and he got the first lady as he loves mushroom & swiss burgers. We got take out as it was still chilly out and they don't have a sit down area inside.Everything was still good by the time we got home. We were definitely blown away by the flavors and the portions for the price we paid!An added plus to our trip was how great of customer service James was to us, I believe he is the man behind this place. They have a TV that played an ol skool song that my husband liked. He overheard us talking and told my husband if he could sing the whole song word for word, he would get him a free ice cream. Hubby was too shy for all of that, but it was still a nice gesture!"}, {"review_id": "gPTyJyX2fuXg97QSWq61QA", "user_id": "ilubbK_Y77c1AZG6A09xMQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "11/9/2017", "text": "Honestly...I don't know what all the hype is  about.  These burgers tasted funky.

I work down the street so I figured I'd check this place out. Looks a little sketch but didn't feel that way once you enter. The owner is so nice and funny. They do good business here. Pretty crowded at lunchtime. Lots of business looking customers. The line was almost out the door. I feel I got my food relatively quickly. I ordered the CeaseFire. It has a hint of horseradish on it. Amazing. All the ingredients are fresh and creatively paired. Good quality food, good amount for the $. Fries come w your burger and they are crazy good. Not sure what they do to them to make them taste so good. I got a burger, fries and lemonade for $9. Stop in and don't forget to show the Yelp check-in offer for a free drink.
