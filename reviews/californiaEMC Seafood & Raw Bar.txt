It used to be the place to go for lovely fresh oysters and other seafood late at night. The last four visits, two during late afternoon, and two at night, it was clear the oysters had been shucked earlier. Tasted like it was done pretty far in advance. All the oyster liquor was gone, what hadn't already dried up was drained into the ice because of the way the oysters were placed, oysters shrunken against the shell and with a clear \"NOT FRESH\" film on top. Do they really think customers won't notice?!? Or that we would mind waiting an extra five minutes to have fresh seafood delivered as it's meant to be served, and as they used to serve recently? It's not that they tasted bad-but when you shuck an oyster and let it sit around? There's simply no reason anyone should pay for it regardless  of varietal or time of day. We can get close to that quality with a jar of oysters from a good grocery, and much better quality at other local spots. Regular dishes were fine. But really ONLY fine given the apparent recently declined standards at EMC. I may like their fried zucchini and sashimi, but it's been very inconsistent lately. Had to return a scallop sashimi recently because it was obviously not as fresh as their normal standards and just wasn't good. Do they have a different person in charge of the kitchen? Guessing that must be so. The service and bar are still excellent. But come ON! There are other places to go that offer beautifully  fresh seafood, even late night in KTown. Wish EMC would get it together and live up to its previous standards. I'm  obviously bitter only because this was a local jewel that could be counted on until recently. And obviously, if you're spending $60 per person for a late night meal, you're hoping it will be up to a certain standard. Extremely disappointing to see this decline and hoping it will be corrected."}, {"review_id": "5mtWkhgratb16WXYWAG90Q", "user_id": "o0exBsBaHnS4O9SHjwwpOQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "EMC, nice set up: high bar seating as well as standard height tables & chairs.

We just caught the late night special reduced price menu.  1) The fried catfish w/ sea salt & pepper was in a thick bready batter, not exactly light & crispy. Catfish was on the bland side. Side of \"louis dressing\" which is mostly mayonnaise & colouring of ketchup.2) Fried clam had the same bready batter. Side of ketchup & horse radish. These weren't Ipswich style fried clams so very little savory ocean minerality. 3) Fried soft shell crab slider on a brioche style mIni bun garnished w/ salad mix, wedge of lemon to add a gastrique, mayonnaise was pleasant, but had no particularly  interesting taste 1-3a)  Three Sakè (sah keh) Flight: Yuri Masamunè; Snow Maiden Nigori/cloudy; Jo-to-/Highest Quality Junmai Daiginjo- class.

I love seafood and koreatown so I keep wanting to really like this place but honestly, it's just ok. I've been here several times but haven't been blown away by any of their food yet. Their happy hour items are a pretty good deal- price wise. I think the dollar oysters are their big thing but they taste very average every time I get them from here... not the freshest or the most delicate in flavor or texture. The lobsters here are very small and don't have much meat. They taste fine just like everything else but noting exceptional. I also know people like their uni pasta. I've honestly have had so many better versions elsewhere and feel the noodles here are too thick and starchy. I've also ordered the uni separately and it was creamy but not the freshest. Same w the sashimi sampler platter. The best dishes I've had here (not the best as in compared to other restaurants but best as in within EMC) were the seafood salad at lunch and the sea bass. The sea bass dish could certainly stand to be plated better though... not doing it justice by bringing your tastiest dish out on a round, silver baking pan."}, {"review_id": "dFUsYqTql9l1h-EdTGWRjw", "user_id": "Nfp5VrZwnms_whEFBpX9VQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "This place was established in 2013. It's placed in the Korean district of L.A where many seafood goers come to dine at. Slurp up some fresh aphrodisiacs or crack into live sea urchins or even better yet, order the seafood tower that will leave your mouth watering and stomach grumbling for more. My friend had suggested we come here for a late night dinner one evening. She raved about this place and so I wanted to see what all the hype was all about. We both walked into the restaurant and wrote our name down. We waited for about 20 minutes for a table, but it was a busy night so I didn't mind the suspense. As soon as we got seated, I started observing the interior decoration of the dining room. The ambiance had an intimate feeling to it. The lighting was dimmed and there was a lot of conversations happening at once. They had a raw seafood bar where people would order oyster shooters. If I wasn't mistaken, I believed that the interior of restaurant resembled a lot like a Japanese pub. A perfect place for hospitality workers to go after hours. Our server introduce herself and took our beverage order. She then came back to with our beverages and finished up taking our orders. My friend and I had both agreed on some of the few items that we could share. We got a dozen of shucked oysters, fried calamari, uni pasta, and salmon carpaccio. The food reached to our table in a fairly decent time. I was a bit ecstatic to try these items from the menu. We first tried the oysters and you could immediately taste the high quality oysters that they were using. The freshly squeezed lemon juice and cocktail sauce were the perfect amount of tang and sweetness. We started next on the fried calamari. They were crispy but in my opinion over battered. Didn't really care much for this appetizer because I felt it was too greasy and didn't have much taste to it. The sriracha aioli didn't justify the dish either. I tried the Uni pasta next and holy mother of fish cakes, that was one of the best tasting pasta dishes I have ever had. The uni had a sweet and briny taste to it. It had a creamy texture which blended very well with the spaghetti noodles. It had a super rich taste but I really enjoyed it. A well executed dish! The last plate we had was the carpaccio. There were thinly sliced salmon doused in a sweet soy vinaigrette. They added mini fish roes that was placed on top of the salmon which gave it a nice salty component to the dish. A perfect balance of sweet and salty. My overall first time experience at EMC was superb. Awesome customer service and stellar dishes! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves seafood.

Highly, highly, highly recommend if you love eating uni (sea urchin) like me.We also got some Fat Bastards (oysters from Seattle, Washington) which were yummy and yes, fat. Which is how I like my oysters. They have an amazing happy hour where oysters are $1 off. Are you convinced to go yet? You should be.They have an underground garage that they validate for so make sure to park in the right spot.

The restaurant was not busy so we got seated immediately. There are two bars and I've heard it gets pretty busy at night especially during happy hour. There's a view of the kitchen too so you can see your food being prepared.Since they're known for their seafood and garlic noodles, we all decided on similar dishes. We ordered the seafood pasta, shrimp garlic noodles, and the fresh lobster garlic noodles. To start off with, we ordered the zucchini fries with yogurt ranch dipping sauce. The fries were ok, not crispy enough but because the zucchini is filled with water. The batter isn't too thick either.The garlic noodles were tasty and pretty garlicky. We had to grab drinks from CoCo across the street to drown out the taste. The lobster seemed a bit fishy although I was expecting a fresher taste with the description of \"fresh lobster\".I've also tried the truffle burger since it was recommended by the server (who is a vegan o.O). Surprisingly, he delivered a great tasting burger. It was portioned well tooOverall, lunch was good and there are still lots of items on the menu to try especially the advertised raw oysters and alcohol."}, {"review_id": "B99f9LxsxMX-Rv22NFZf1w", "user_id": "Ird7rofV8OwL5iDyfAcgSg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "This is a pretty popular spot in Ktown for raw bar, and Happy Hour.

The last time I came here, I was in a party of 9 so it took about an hour for our table. But it's okay because you can walk around the area and they'll call you when your table is ready. Even with a large party, the food we ordered came out pretty quickly. My favorite was the truffle fries with the mushroom aioli... that aioli was addicting and I want to eat that with everything! I also enjoyed the shrimp garlic noodles that were perfectly cooked with so much flavor! However, the lobster roll was okay, I appreciate the brioche bun but it was quite small (even though I ordered a large) for the price.

My only complaint was whoever shucked them, broke a few, 8 out of 24. * One sea urchin $18 - so fresh and nice that I wanted to order another had it not been for my rush to get to my movie on time. * Garlic Braised Pork Belly $8 - comes with 5 very thin slices and way to salty to be a starter dish. I struggled to finish this dish. * Old Fashioned cocktail cost $15Service was quick and prompt. Everyone in general was nice. The bartender even noticed when I was trying to clean off soy sauce splatter on my shirt and brought to the table with a glass of soda and napkin would so I could clean myself up.

The shrimp were well-cooked and the toast was buttery....but really $12 for some buttery bread and 6 pieces of shrimp?I also ordered 8 oysters for the Happy Hour price ($1 each). As you can see from my pictures, the sizes of the oysters varied. Some were a decent size, but a few were tiny. I was super excited to eat these oysters, but most of them turned out to be sandy. I guess you can't really beat the $1 price, but I just wish they weren't as sandy.My friend ordered the Fish Tacos, which came with a Fennel Salad and Tartar sauce. Unfortunately, he wasn't the biggest fan of the tacos and thought they were alright. He also ordered oysters and agreed with me.
