If you want Greek food, this is the place to be in the New England area.I would bring friends here from out of town and they're always asking me to bring them here ever since. I usually order the rice bowl version since they pack so much more and you'd get your money's worth!It usually gets busy on the weekends after the bars since it's opened so late! So if you want your drunk munchies stop by here. I highly recommend their gyro fries to share or for yourself."}, {"review_id": "Uo9grg9kSDu9Dy7KS0j4vA", "user_id": "r1M84A56bViGJKKuxr1_PA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "10/10/2017", "text": "Sorry, G-Spot. I'm not seeing the hype. I think after living in Manchester, NH for 1.5 months, I've come to the conclusion that Manchester is devoid is really great restaurants. I am usually a huge fan of gyro - REAL gyro - and tzatziki sauce is my sh*t. Maybe they had a bad day but I was not impressed with my beef/lamb gyro. I'm from Dallas, TX and while we aren't known for Mediterranean or Greek food...the gyros I've had from home are far superior to Gyro Spot's.The tzatziki sauce here is rather mediocre and the gyro itself was seriously lacking in tzatziki sauce. The meat was on the dry side and had a tough texture. I wasn't tasting the great flavors you should get either. Gyro meat needs to be juicy, tender, and full of flavor. The tomatoes and onions were good but it's not like much preparation goes into tomatoes and onions - you literally just have to chop 'em up. So...Gyro Spot stuffs french fries into their gyros which sounds amazing but the mixture of fries I had in my gyro were not impressive. I got some hard, over-fried pieces. Like, if you're gonna do french fries - do them right. Crunchy/crispy on the outside, mushy potato goodness on the inside."}, {"review_id": "Kb_R6rY4Vn1WcyYRTtXJAA", "user_id": "KA_WU2j-R4a9gVwJDOrNQw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "Love to go visit my in laws over New Hampshire just to have a taste of gyro spot.

Having been fortunate enough to enjoy authentic Greek Gyros in Greece this is hands down the best I've had stateside, although I must admit I shamelessly added mixed greens to lessen the guilt. I requested my fries on the side although having them on the gyro is the correct way to enjoy this meaty goodness, bcz I wasn't in the mood for any and wanted my taste buds to enjoy the flavors of the meat, bread, and sauce. Boy did I get it! I tried the lamb and  original. The tzatziki sauce could've done with a little more garlic but everything else hit the mark!  I was pleasantly pleased and happy to close my eyes, take a giant bite, and pretend I was back in Mykonos.  Have one!

Downtown on a Thursday afternoon for business with the hubby so suggested trying this. Parking was easy, metered street parking on Elm and we took our lunch to go because of a waiting dog in the car.We told the young lady at the counter it was our first time and we saw the feature on PG. She was very pleasant and when asked \"what should one try for the first time?\" she quickly suggested the traditional \"pork\" Gyro so we ordered two plus a small order of the hand cut fries (my weakness). It's an open prep/cook area so we could see our Gyro's being carefully made. The mouth was starting to water.There were a few patrons dining in and a constant flow of patrons ordering to go. We waited less than 10 minutes for our order.Our thought was to eat and drive since the Gyro was in a wrap. Once we opened it, we couldn't stop eating long enough to drive. The flavors were absolutely amazing (tender, flavorful shaved pork), chopped red onions and fresh Tomatos, hand cut fries rolled in the freshly made thick pita with their delicious tzeke sauce. A very generous portion of crispy handcut fries accompanied our Gyro's. What a great find Phantom!  Around $24 including two drinks from the self serve cooler.We'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "cr-zojdfjZCANfEzyd1WiQ", "user_id": "by9lKS_MjkNwRxGprSdEXg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2017", "text": "I was really excited to try this place after seeing it on Phantom Gourmet. My sister and I got the lamb as well as pork gyros with all the toppings included. It was a nice atmosphere with tables and chairs to sit inside or outside of the restaurant. The gyros themselves were good. I preferred the pork to the lamb because it was less salty in my opinion. But both meats were very tender . I have had better gyros that were more flavorful but the gyros here are more than sufficient for a gyro fix when I need it. Next time I will try their baclava and fried dough balls... yum."}, {"review_id": "wwnhRZXyjjgOcEsfXNAudg", "user_id": "X4yhFB7wluoNyykE-MivKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "As also, the chicken gyro was delicious, maybe slightly spicy than before.  Staff is friendly and meal was ready as stated."}, {"review_id": "LehTa7AfbyB81zoACgzhGw", "user_id": "-5WF88OBjPOFTsxHO0TGuQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "Always delicious.  The feta fries are awesome and the nutritious gyro is always spot on."}, {"review_id": "2lRKu6pss5FpujDfG7kFjQ", "user_id": "MbSO1uZOlKC3uzRgJsh7LQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "Thought this place was just ok, they had a very light hand on the amount of meat (I chose pork), and the meat was already sliced and in a mstal container, instead of being freshly sliced - what's going on with that? They put fries in their gyros - I should have asked for the fries on the side instead of the the business' policy of putting them in the sandwich; however, putting fries in the sandwich makes it look bigger and masks the relatively small amount of meat. I also felt the meat lacked juciness and was underseasoned; he accompanying pita was nicely grilled and warmed, but there wasn't enough sauce.

When I ordered a cup of water I was charged $1.99 for a bottle of water as part of our total check; when no cup was forthcoming I was explained the above, and my $1.99 was refunded (but not the 9% meals tax; guess they get to keep that). Also, had I been asked I would have gladly handed over a penny so I could be given two $1 bills; instead, I was given a single dollar bill and a fistful of coins.Next, I ordered a pork bowl, but was served a pork gyro, requiring me to send it back for a do-over. In general, the demeanor of the staff in responding to what will forevermore be known as The Water Fiasco and The Rice Bowl Fiasco was blasé bordering on put-upon. Sorry to have inconvenienced you!Finally, my dining companion's pita was burned in spots, which has been our experience the past two or three times we've eaten here.I'll give them another try in 2018, no sooner."}, {"review_id": "6KEowaa0_rWHhiSIYwOtGw", "user_id": "oWx7A9EEkptOn1RuQTWC5A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2017", "text": "Holy moly, quite possibly the greatest fries/gyro combination I have ever had.  I have traveled far and wide and to find this place in Manchester,NH of all places is quite the find I ordered the gyro fries and pad the .50 extra for feta added to it.

I found the place fairly easily and got lucky with a parking spot too.The menu is simple gyro, salad and sides. The customer service is great so they will def help as soon as they realize you are first timer. I went with chicken gyro with olives and feta . I also got a side of Trio spreads which were Hummus, Spicy feta and Taziki. all 3 of them were nice and came with the regular pita bread warmed and grilled on the open grill. The gyro was pretty big with chicken , veggies and their special G sauce (not spicy at all) and not to mention french fried. Overall the gyro was good i could barely taste chicken with all the sauce and fries so cant differentiate if the chicken was good or different from other places. Overall it was same as other places nothing that would separate from other gyro makers at least on the chicken part which would be really the only thing that could have been totally different from other places as the veggies taste the same everywhere but it was still good and filling. Once request is to really make a homemade spicy sauce that would take the gyro over the top. Def will make another stop sometime."}, {"review_id": "PucPusBd7EnuoFwielxwuA", "user_id": "03rRTBvZ5ZPtltZYXic3iA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/25/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Really fresh and great Greek food.  Perfectly priced too.  The feta is authentic.

Secondly, the lamb meat mixture wasn't juicy and tender. Instead, the meat was darkened, dry and some pieces were hard. Lastly, the fries were so greasy, dark, and crispy that I couldn't even eat them, which is so usual because they are usually fresh, slightly crisp, and taste like potatoes, not grease. I noticed Sara wasn't there.  I can tell you that she makes the best gyros in my opinion.  Perhaps, it would be effective if all your employees are trained the same way.  I feel Sara wouldn't have served me what they did yesterday.
