In an unassuming strip mall in the heart of Aurora, sits this beautiful restaurant. Delicious wings, even better sides and service, this gem is my go to spot for wings. My only complaint is that I end up ordering too much, and hating myself for indulging too heavily in this fried food fare. Try all the wings. Get the Gumbo. And finish it with the funnel cake fries."}, {"review_id": "uMp6MFdtc6z7J0bTPPPLcw", "user_id": "6GQOSwqwqsjsX15tmEz3wA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "The sauces here are very good!  Keep in mind that the wings are smaller because they are locally sourced.I recommend getting a basket with sweet potato fries and funnel cake fries as dessert.

One word - BOMB. The wings are like DROWNED in sauce  It's a beautiful experience tbh. The staff is so great! Shout out to the girl being ever so patient with our group and taking our order.

Overall, we were pretty impressed. It is a very relaxed environment.The wings were good, and we're fairly crunchy on the outside. I like a crunchy skin on my wings. The sauces were good, and there was a great selection.I give four stars for one main reason-the wings were very small. They sell wings by the pound, so some would argue that the size of the wing wouldn't matter because you're still getting a pound. However, the smaller the wing, the more bone per pound you get. Each wing had maybe one small bite of meat on each one."}, {"review_id": "I3VTGnf3ZBCM7BpKtmImng", "user_id": "3HExwCjYt98AueWY_HJaEA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Amazing selection and quality.

They have the best wings in town and I have spent a great deal of time trying to make a jerk rub just as tasty as theirs! Such great variety and they have many different beers always rotating in from local breweries which is wonderful!

We visited the Aurora/Denver area on our year long travels around the US, and though we made a lot of meals at home, it was awesome to have some yummy wings! We got a combination of the buffalo tenders, garlic parmesan, and mango madness wings. They were all moist and delicious! We also got a side of the jalapeno goat cheese dip which was really good and different, and HUGE so we had leftovers for a few days! The staff here were super friendly and it was a cute little spot with a bar serving many craft brews.  We would be back if we were in the area again!Feel free to follow our travels at tandaintheusofa.com"}, {"review_id": "Syhqtti4QOJ1XbPQKWnXbg", "user_id": "FjqtSuGb6ueHG95mEgDL4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/17/2017", "text": "Wow. I think I discovered my new favorite wing place. We met up with some family here for lunch today, grabbed a seat, and the guy working welcomed us and explained the menu and sauces. They have a lotttt of sauces. If you are eating in, the process is to walk up and order when you're ready. Nice casual environment with lots of cool craft beer decor. I started with an epic brainless raspberry beer, got a large order of the boneless wings because they let you do half and half on different sauces if your order is a large or bigger. I got the bee sting and pad thai. My guy went for the fire ranch. Also curly fries and a Caesar salad to share, hey we were hungry.Food came out in about 10 or so minutes and everything was soooo good! The sauces I ordered were on the middle of their spicy scale and I was glad they were by no means uncomfortably hot, in fact next time (because there will absolutely be a next time) I will probably go up a spice level. But um as far as flavors go, I couldn't pick a favorite, they were both outstanding.Prices were also very reasonable, friendly staff and cool vibe."}, {"review_id": "TPaHfI07wGT90n8dYPdVMg", "user_id": "fIftNBks-bulpoYISrowUQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Well, don't want this review to be biased since I've known the guys (Caleb Roddy n Jarod Riggs) since they were kids in So.

Whether you're eating on site or ordering take-out for, say, Dry Dock Brewing, this place is a solid choice when you are in the mood for wings.My favorite sauces so far have been the spicy pesto-Parmesan and the bee sting (a traditional hot sauce mixed with honey). I love that they sell wings by the pound too, which means that you end up getting a better deal if the wings are on the puny side. Also, a lot of the small bites are totally awesome. We like the hush puppies, but we got the mac and cheese bites on our last visit and they are life-changing.

First off, they price their wings by the pound. Why is that a plus you ask? Well have you ever ordered six wings and had them come from the smallest chickens that must have ever existed? The ordering by weight helps with that. While yes if you get smaller wings you're still mostly paying for bones, but at least you get more of them and don't feel jipped.  My favorite flavor is the Spicy Parmesan Garlic. I've tried some others such as the fire ranch, but that one left me with a lingering burning sensation on my tongue and got my glands sweating. They also do a great job with their sides, with both the curly fries and hush-puppies being a perfect partner to your wings. At some point I'd like to try the red beans and rice, but then I'm stuck with the choice of what to cut from my perfectly crafted meal."}, {"review_id": "_VQ6GBwY-xrttxghXH0PDQ", "user_id": "h9bmvs0AMigbb0K6qlkqbg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Wings were good but not the best I ever had. Didn't even serve them with celery!  What wing place does that. The line was ridiculously long, but I guess a lot of people do like them. Wasn't happy with the fact people were cutting in line and the employees did nothing to stop it. The customers behind us finally said something about it but it shouldn't have come to that. The place is very small, so it's probably best if you call in your order and pick them up to go if you come here. Good wings but I hope this town has better."}, {"review_id": "I_zChoPocnFrWha8SmcIQw", "user_id": "ysYUk15l9ATD44XBU6KAuA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "Food was great! We had the honey mustard, bee sting, hot ranch. Liked them all! My favorite was the honey mustard witch is on usual for me. I usually like a lot of heat witch these didn't have, but the smoke flavor was really good. Quite surprised. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the needed more help in the front of the house today.

They're all good, but the chili lime ranch is AMAZING. They can mix any spice, seasoning or sauce with ranch. They have a menu full of Cajun food (red beans and rice, gumbo, jambalaya, po'boys) as well as burgers and bicker sandwiches.

The bee sting bbq has a buffalo base with a sweet ending and the Asian was sweet almost like a honey taste, so good!!! The curly fries were the best I have ever tried and so was the hush puppies!
