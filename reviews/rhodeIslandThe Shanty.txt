Staff: lovelyAmbiance: cool & hip and also cleanFood: squash soup was VERY bold, smokey and a bit over salted. Lobster roll with fries- the lobster was SWIMMiNG in mayo and sat in a soggy pool of shredded lettuce on a buttered bun. I've had my fair share of lobster rolls being from New England- this was not a good example. I have to say the hand cut fries were delish.Chicken yellow curry- again very deep and smokey. A very interesting twist on yellow curry."}, {"review_id": "-u-PWVRf_m5omMVDQGcw2w", "user_id": "SBXkQ8K_yEce7DN-ELzwrw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "Found this place on Yelp. I was looking for something close by the airport, as I had met some friends in town. The ambiance is lovely. I enjoyed light feature over the bar, I wish there were more throughout the restaurant. It reminded me of being inside a barn- very cool.We dined on a Monday; The special was a burger with arugula and feta cheese (if you ordered a pint, the price of the burger was $9). It was one of my favourite burgers ever!! Great service.I look forward to coming back here to try out the rest of the menu. Very cool spot."}, {"review_id": "1wytccJY2fSWk7Z9E_oU0Q", "user_id": "prwyxkl4AtVUcI0cCqe2cQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "A pleasant surprise for an out-of-towner to discover this gem.  The \"TV dinner\" is a delightful and whimsical entree.  And the choice of local beers is broad enough to satisfy just about any beer-lovers taste."}, {"review_id": "3SpIVmj8lF3tieM68xANZQ", "user_id": "imGQirCh-t_Kftb4U7VuUA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/18/2017", "text": "After a long day of travel, I really had to convince myself to drive from my airport hotel to The Shanty, but I'm really glad I did.  These are the types of local spots that make for memorable visits.  The minute you walk in the door, there's a warm greeting at both the hostess stand and the bar.  It's a warm and inviting space with soft light that puts you at ease upon entering.  I was impressed with the varied draft list and solid wine selection.  The list leans local, so a couple tasters were greatly appreciated and helped me settle on the an Octoberfest from nearby.  As a little snack, I ordered the pickled vegetables, which were very good and a generous portion (green beans, carrots, red onion and pickles).  For my entree, I had to go with the lobster roll and subbed in a side of the crispy brussel sprouts.  First off, the lobster roll is massive, delicious, and loaded with large chunks of lobster.  The brussels dish is no slouch either.  Perfectly cooked in duck fat with just the right amount of salt.  I really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere as a single diner at the bar, the service was very friendly, and there were no missteps with the food.  This is what a great local restaurant and bar looks like."}, {"review_id": "hSS_ZNoqqjtOdt-WCqgjIA", "user_id": "B4rOTWNA7a2dbN0GP6oggw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/16/2017", "text": "Don't let me the last know come to mind when I think about The Shanty! I remember hearing about this new place in RI that was serving \"gourmet TV dinners\" I even remember seeing pictures and seeing it featured on The Phantom Gourmet but still I never went, it's wasn't until it's hard to believe but this place has been open 3 years that I finally got a chance to get the infamous TV Dinner!Never had something looked as close to what you seen in pictures as this. I hadn't had Cornish hen so was a little unsure, tasted like chicken but a tad dry, the star of this plate to me was the macaroni and cheese which was perfect, also came with a few other little sides which are swapped out pending the season and no TV dinner is complete without a little dessert! Beautiful rustic interior and the place was busy for a Thursday, Love they took reservation and the server was so attentive and friendly. Will be back as the menu is ever changing and hope to upgrade it to 5 stars!"}, {"review_id": "eVjaQ8NJPXiRlmsS2nre_g", "user_id": "NYUzNW2JMJu9OYpBn7GTTg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "My husband and I stopped in before an appointment to check the place out. Loved the decor. Very  much my style. Beautiful rustic chandeliers above the bar. We stopped in during the Sunday brunch and the mimosas didn't disappoint. I tried the Beet juice mimosa and the husband got the pomegranate mimosa. Never would've thought of a beet mimosa, but I just love it. (I may or may not have also tried the fully loaded Bloody Mary... it was also amazing, but sooo filling) I ordered the fish and chips. Huge portion. Good fresh fish with an excellent batter. Very flakey. My husband got the French toast. I assume it was good, because it was gone long before I began struggling to the finish line with my own. Hopefully we'll have to time to make it back again soon!"}, {"review_id": "UleHaVSwpCmGRDQx765e7Q", "user_id": "xJvZAMZS4j7_WJr4rwq_Xw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "I really enjoy the shanty for after work drinks and a good meal at a bar. Their menu has that farm to table feel with a variety of ingredients. I enjoy their menu very time they change it. My husband who enjoys a more classic approach to food doesn't prefer it. But they always have a burger on menu it seems so he makes it work. I recommend the shanty to any foodies who enjoy something a bit different. Their bar staff are always friendly and local. It's a prefect example of how in the smallest state a small local place makes up for their size in character and taste! They do brunch but I've never made it, but I've personally heard great things from other locals."}, {"review_id": "cm_hcKVa_-8gYcR1xrcXQg", "user_id": "MUwqO0xhkN6mdGVLwQJ-3Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Delicious brunch last weekend.  Had the red flannel hash with over easy egg.  Definitely could have used something green along with, a small salad or steamed vegetable of some sort, but what I had was good.  My dining companion had the bacon & Brussels salad with lobster added which she claimed was delicious, too!  Recommend a reservation on the weekend.  Thankfully we had one as it was mobbed!"}, {"review_id": "96ZYsyMj5dlrx62oyHBBOg", "user_id": "DaPoCcxgNAA0balyW8Ajsg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Best place I've been to in RI for breakfast/brunch.

Our servers name was Aly and she was very attentive; she answered any of our questions in such a friendly, informative manner. We started with the chicken mole tacos. The flavor was outstanding. I just wish they came with some type of creamy fresh saucy side. Just felt like it was missing a condiment. A bit dry. I got the scallops which were a 10/10. Absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked. My boyfriend got the steak with what ended up being fried celery root. Ehhhh not fantastic. Cool different flavor but they were far too greasy. He ended up ordering a side of veggies instead. Steak was A+ though. All of the food is fresh. Last time we went I remember it being the same way. The drinks are fantastic too. I have to give an extra shoutout to our server Aly. She apologized for the app coming out late. We didn't notice because we were enjoying each other's conversation. The app was comped. We were pleasantly surprised. Not only that but she gave us the green beans for no charge. We were expecting to pay seeing as we ordered them and it wasn't a mistake from the kitchen. But she said that she wanted us to thoroughly enjoy our meal so she didn't see it necessary to charge for the green beans. This is perfect customer service and this is the type of waitressing that brings customers back. Thank you Aly for giving us a great dinner and being such a sweetheart! We will be back."}, {"review_id": "5ixD7ZI9WzRh_j6vKCmO-g", "user_id": "-CA2Pqp0WtLZ7zXZscgOEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Fantastic little spot with a great menu and friendly servers.

There's parking although might be difficult if it's busy. Very cool ambiance and interiors when you enter. Relatively small place. Service was pretty good. Got seats at the bar.Got 2 loaded Marys' which costs 14$ and the drink itself only tastes alright although has quite a few garnishes/additions. Also tried a pomosa and adult chocolate milk both of which were pretty good.For food, got the breakfast burger (medium rare) which was amazingly delicious. One of the best I've had so far. Fries were pretty good too. Also got the lobster roll. Decent amount of lobster present although a bit too much mayo and costs 21$. Not sure if it was thaaaaat good.Overall great experience here. Tad bit expensive but we also got some pricey items.

We were in the mood for seafood and we all decided on eggs Benedict with Jonah crab. It came in a reasonable time and we were not disappointed. Good eggs and a generous amount of crab, with a side of home fries. The fries had sea salt, so if you don't like a lot of salt ask for less. We liked them, though, and the crab and egg combo was delicious! Very good services. One note: we came there at the tail end of lunch time on a Saturday and we still had to wait a little while, since the place is kind of small.  Also check out the decor and the cool Edison light/ wood door combo over the bar!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-shanty-warwick?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
