We were surprised when we walked in because I had been to this place when it was a diner and it had a complete renovation! Our server was awesome, I wish I had gotten her name . I accidentally ordered the wrong appetizer and when I told my server she smiled said it was fine and replaced it with the app I meant to order. What a doll!!!!!! The food was excellent, we got a complimentary half glass of wine, which looked like a normal pour to me! I had the Mousakka and my mom had a chicken dish with peppers and rice. We started with the Lima bean app. Everything was incredible including the service. Can't wait to come back!"}, {"review_id": "87N8iizg7Ol6Zp9xumgmSQ", "user_id": "gfht5MTuyYKPwMD3pTtLbA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Went for dinner here for my son's birthday-the food was excellent and the service was superb-server was super and friendly.

Came here after a wedding bc we're still hungry. Food and service and ambiance was excellent! We got: Avgolemono soup- almost ordered some to go. That good. The five app platter- everything was so good. Especially the feta Mykonos. Omfggggg. It's warm feta block, wrapped in phyllo, baked and has a honey syrup on top. Not too much- but just enough to capture the sweet and salty sides. Soooooo good. Grilled octopus was nice. Best moussaka I've ever had. They don't over tomato it. The bechemel isn't runny and has a nice firmness to it. It was seriously excellent. Bf got the baklava and I was surprised about the portion- huge! The waitress was on point with food and requests. The food came out really fast which was odd being that it was a decently packed place for a sat night. Not complaining duh- again saying how on point it was. So glad I got to eat here!!"}, {"review_id": "sJdDB_RqkPCoOvPbXU4aGw", "user_id": "kVSKrOn2H8jvfVxPlcRHpg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Impeccable food and service. Can't ask for a much better BYOB in the Valley. Really love the Avgolemono Soup and Chicken Souvlaki.

We live in the city but were visiting friends in Allentown and ordered for pick up. The chicken souvlaki sandwich is amazing - the chicken is perfectly marinated and so tender. I am also a huge fan of the pita-it is warm, fluffy, and flavorful! My husband is a picky eater and loved the gyro. The tzatziki is about average - The Greek lady in philly is better. The fries are herbed up and awesome. I would definitely eat here again.

I am giving this restaurant four stars based solely on their food, not the service. The atmosphere is more upscale than I would have thought.  To start we ordered Avgolemono soup, grape leaves (dolmadakia), and the combination five hot appetizers. The soup came out hot and steamy. It was very creamy and tasty. We could tell it was homemade. The grape leaves were a bit of a disappointment. They only have rice grape leaves. They were big. The leaves were a bit softer than I like. But overall it was a quality dish. The five hot appetizers were my favorite! With the exception of the calamari, the flavors in each sample were amazing! I truly enjoyed the variety. Our main course consisted of beef/lamb gyros with French fries. I did  expect more meat on them being this is a Greek restaurant. The lettuce, tomatoes and onions were very, very, fresh. I felt that the onions were strong and over powered the meat flavor. The tzatziki sauce was wonderful! Very creamy with a full flavor! There was also free dessert which came with our meal which was a nice surprise. Our server seemed inexperienced. She took our appetizers to the wrong table. She did not put in our main course order until we were completely finished with our appetizers so we sat for 10 minutes between courses waiting.  She did seem to know the menu well. Overall, if we were to return, we would go for dinner and try different dishes as it seems they put a lot of effort into preparing the meals."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/nostos-greek-restaurant-seafood-and-grill-allentown?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
