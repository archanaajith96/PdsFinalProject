Â I needed a place that was family friendly and also served adult beverages ( for me).I searched on Yelp and found this place. Phew, what a great find. First of all the parking lot was PACKED. That is always a good sign at 2:00 pm on a Sunday. Once inside, the place was huge, room after room and big parties in all of them. The menu was huge too. There was SO MUCH to choose from. Because of the Yelp reviews and my nephew's recommendation I choose chicken tenders( something I probably never would done)and I'm really happy I did. Tender and perfectly fried all white meat chicken. It comes with a container of commercial duck sauce, but it somehow worked. Our dinners came with a really good Greek salad, sweet potato fries, which could have been a tad crisper and we opted for a cole slaw that was absolutely perfect creamy, tangy and crisp.Pita bread and dinner rolls were in a bread basket but unnecessary really given that we all ordered fried food. Next time I return, and I will, I will order more nutritionally responsible . Perhaps the lamb kabobs I was eyeing at the table next to us and that really good Greek salad."}, {"review_id": "F-vR7tqQQuNQrjmR5j46aQ", "user_id": "jEjRc0OfpUVCg73MhTcdrQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Really disappointed! I had pretty high expectations (I should've read the Yelp reviews) but it was really average. All of the staff seemed very disinterested and honestly they were not very friendly. Our waitress really bothered me because she was very very impatient with my elderly grandmother! You would think given the demographic of their customers she would have been more kind but maybe she was just ready to go home? All I know is that the way she acted it was like we were an inconvenience. The swordfish was just okay, but my favorite was the vegetable stir-fry or should I say the warm raw vegetables served over rice! Next time order I'll order a garden salad with Teriyaki dressing because that's what I got for lunch. Some serious room for improvement."}, {"review_id": "HiDwxDk995Ii0a6p55XH-w", "user_id": "r1M84A56bViGJKKuxr1_PA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Chicken tenders and fries are typically what people get when they don't know what to order from the menu since it's a \"safe\" bet...for non adventurous people anyway. But hey, no judgement there when you're dining at Puritan Backroom since they specialize in chicken tenders. Puritan Backroom puts out some mean chicken tenders - I never woulda thought I'd find some of the best chicken tenders in lil ole Manchester. If the plain ones are too boring for ya, they also have spicy tenders, buffalo tenders, and coconut tenders.I have to admit...I drove past this establishment a few times and thought \"what a peculiar name\" and when I discovered it was a restaurant I was like \"yeah...not sure I wanna be dining at a place called 'Puritan Backroom'.\" But luckily, my school catered from this place a few times and I was instantly hooked on their tenders. Ya girl don't play around when it comes to fried chicken. I am a huge fan of their spicy chicken tenders. The batter is really flavorful and it's not over-battered. It actually tastes great without any dipping sauce. I'm not a huge fan of the duck sauce (their signature dipping sauce) that it comes with...it's just okay. I prefer dipping my tenders in a \"creamier\" sauce like honey mustard. Their fries are pretty standard - not bad, not great, just solid enough to neither make or break your meal."}, {"review_id": "2Aqs7k82SEJlFKBSLsfyDA", "user_id": "4_GvCkAq7UcsYJWcypldnQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "If you are looking for some amazing chicken tenders than look no further because this is your place to be! The Puritan Backroom is a nice American cuisine restaurant in Manchester, NH. This place is very large and has a ton of seating. So if you are looking for a good place to bring a larger group than I would highly consider the Puritan Backroom.I first started coming her about a year ago after my step mother just couldn't stop raving about their chicken tenders. I always thought that chicken tenders were a simple food and that the taste rarely varied from one place to another..... Well let me just say, I am so happy that I came here and ordered the chicken tenders as they are absolutely fantastic. They have a few options, the traditional, the spicy, buffalo, and coconut. If its your first time, I highly recommend sticking with the traditional, however the others are also very tasty.With the traditional tenders you get a side sauce which I believe is a homemade sweet and sour. This is amazing!!! Also the portion is HUGE. This is a meal that you can easily share with someone else or have left overs for later!With that said I will also note that ALL of the portions here are very large! So come hungry!Also, I can't forget to mention the mudslides. If you are a mudslide fan, then you will be in heaven here. They have so many different options..... from Milky Way to Almond Joy to Churro..... and many more. I'm pretty sure I have tried them all and they all do have a unique and delicious taste.All the staff is always friendly and there is plenty of staff working and available to help you if needed. Next time you are craving a mudslide or chicken tenders make sure you come here.... you won't regret it!"}, {"review_id": "8JLbALx2K015k_DG55Bfqg", "user_id": "8Hpq8GWTQINliD76ttYohw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "Oh the Puritan Backroom...if you can get pass the name, which basically sounds like a colonial-themed adult entertainment room, you are in for an epic experience. First off, the Puritan Backroom is known for their mudslides and chicken tenders. Their mudslides are literally amazeballs and come in every flavor you can imagine. Churro mudslide? got it. Snicker mudslide? YUP. Almond Joy, Milky Way...just think of any candy bar and they have it in mudslide form. They even have some mudslides with fireball and Grand Marnier in them. My personal favorite is the Snicker mudslide, which is incredibly good. All the mudslides come in a decent-sized glass however, be prepared to drop $11 for one.Secondly, the chicken tenders. The tenders are primarily why my husband and I make our way to the Puritan Backroom, because they are really good. With the chicken tenders, you can get original, spicy or buffalo. I prefer the spicy which has a really nice seasoning, but I am not totally crazy about the buffalo. Each chicken tender plate is served with a house-made duck sauce and comes with fries that are deliciously crispy! Although they are known for their tenders, they have a variety of other options on their menu. They have sandwiches, pasta dishes, and other diner-like food. Now the ambiance...I can't quite place the aesthetic of the restaurant. When you walk in, you instantly get a diner feel with the red/maroonish carpeting and the rustic lighting. However, they also have these beautiful modernized wooden beams that almost seem out of place. Then as you look around the room, the walls are swallowed by paintings...paintings of a man wearing a sombrero, paintings of a geisha, modern/abstract paintings...the aesthetic is kind of all over the place, which almost gives the restaurant a quirky charm, but for me it ends up just being distracting and odd. Overall, this is a great place for some mudslides and diner-esque food when you are in the Manchester area. Definitely some place to check out, even if it is to admire and/or contemplate the odd decor."}, {"review_id": "AM28gJJhu08LYCcUVwXS9w", "user_id": "zoQwKvJIgV88r43KDKoEYw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Chicken tenders are all the reasons why all my friends and myself come here for. I usually get the spicy tenders with a side of Buffalo and BBQ sauce. The traditional ones actually had more flavor so sometimes I get that. I got something different one other time, but it wasn't worth it so every time I drive 45 Mins to Manchester, I get the tenders. Also getting the meal portion with fries is more than another for one person for me. Place is always packed and you usually always have to wait a while on busy days."}, {"review_id": "wBHsSp_kqxEKzFddmFktpA", "user_id": "IBPNYI3P09-Kf8sXg2YHlA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "So I know my opinion is probably in the minority here but the thing this place is best known for is their chicken tenders, and frankly I think they are overrated. Never crispy and always kind of soggy in texture can only be partially saved by the admittedly excellent side dipping sauce. the rest of the menu features a nice array of items but the pricing felt a bit steep given the overall quality of the food and portion. The saving graces for this establishment in my eyes is the atmosphere is always nice, they make some really excellent mixed drinks, and the ice cream is always great. Be sure to arrive early as this place is always packed."}, {"review_id": "66W-0xhWGIyG1oV3V_cegw", "user_id": "jyw4ezhRsN9jzMvYm7-o6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Mudslide and chicken tender heaven!! Sounds like an odd combo, but you will mostly see everyone with a plate of tenders, a Greek salad, and a snickers mudslide or local IPA to wash it down.

While I can't say that I know of another place around that cooks up a superior version, I'm still unimpressed with Puritan and actually somewhat concerned that I live in a fried chicken desert.They certainly fill up your plate with food and I appreciate that they used whole chicken pieces instead of ground meat, however, I thought that the chicken was annoyingly sweet for me. This problem is compounded by the fact that their dipping sauce is a sweet duck sauce! The exterior wasn't crispy either so that was disappointing. I can't really call it \"average\" since it just seemed so strange compared to other chicken tenders I've had, but I just can't call it \"good\" either. Throw in some underdone fries and lukewarm bread and you have a recipe for a massively disappointed John B. To top it all off, my mother ordered the jumbo shrimp dinner which consisted of three pieces of shrimp, butter, mashed potatoes, gravy, and some other stuff. We knew that there were only three pieces of shrimp, but you'd expect them to be a bit more substantial considering this was $18. Also, the mashed potatoes seemed powdery as if they were made from some instant mix. Yeah...won't be back."}, {"review_id": "yrlP4mSScXprvUCja5itJw", "user_id": "Amxl2FmWW4-u120WeoyPHQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Awful food and awful service.

It was probably 4 p.m. We were seated right away. The waitress Niki was exceptionally fantastic. The food, on the other hand, was so bland and poorly prepared, that I was very disappointed. I chose for my meal, the broiled chicken tenders Â tossed in their special house sauce, with rice and soup to start. The soup was a fish chowder. It had absolutely no flavor except fo the cornstarch Â that they used to thicken it. There was fish in it, I Â saw it, but there was no taste to that fish. So disappointed with that. The rice had zero flavor. Not even salt and pepper! Total bummer.My wife had the baked Haddock meal with mashed potatoes and a Greek salad to start. The mashed potatoes were decent and the Greek salad was the highlight. The fish was absolutely tasteless-as if the chef went on auto pilot when preparing it. Â Double bummer.On our way out we did grab some vanilla ice cream which was fantastic. So based on the above that is why I gave it two Stars. Â I know a lot of locals love it for their fried feta and for their fried chicken tenders, and maybe one day I might drag myself back there. I don't foresee that day being anytime soon though. Severely let down with this place after all the other good reviews that I had heard from the locals."}, {"review_id": "Fu_kuq1402QgWtNgE-v4Sw", "user_id": "3_nwPDGsnwceJtbKpFPCRA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Burger came out under cooked & our pizza came out burnt on top raw on bottom.
