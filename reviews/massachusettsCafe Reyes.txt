The vibe and decor is great, and the food is amazing. It's an intimate little cafe with a great mission.I've visited twice, and I must warn potential patrons... service is slow. Be prepared to wait. It's usually busy and you may begin to get antsy waiting for your food. Knowing the food is worth the wait is important!The only other negative... hubs tried to get Ropa Vieja on both visits & after placing the order was told they no longer had any available. Hopefully next time!I would definitely recommend Cafe Reyes for a casual dining experience when you've got nowhere else to be. Enjoy the moment!"}, {"review_id": "IE24fGRfEt2zeyBcuyF7Wg", "user_id": "nXw4H8wqs0iFxLZuELf_yA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Was very excited to find a Cuban restaurant nearby.  The service was a bit slow, but everything we ordered was worth the wait!  We had a Cuban sandwich, vegetarian sandwich, and flan.  While waiting for our food, I learned that the restaurant serves as an on-site training center for residents and graduates of the Hector Reyes House.  The Hector Reyes House is a bilingual/bicultural treatment center for Latino men in recovery.  Not only do they have tasty Cuban food, but they do great work as well!  I recommend and will definitely be back sometime soon!"}, {"review_id": "0nDxN7Zlp3hVZzHem9W8dw", "user_id": "4DxbckokfLAdXW8BTE6ZGg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "The tuna sandwich was delicious. The only thing to make it better would be melted cheese on top. The tuna was mixed perfectly.The plantain chips were not overly salted and the right crispiness. The chicken soup was very good. I love the flavor. It looked like it was spicy but it was not. The chicken was flavored well.The black bean soup was good but it was on the bland side for me. Everyone else raved about it but it just tasted like black bean to me.The veggie sandwich was good. In my opinion it had too many onions. The fried plantains were good. The restaurant was clean, and fresh looking. The staff was friendly. Biggest gripe is the that there is only on street parking, which makes it difficult at busy times to eat."}, {"review_id": "rSHohklxH70XnOcNJQyUxg", "user_id": "EhWPugJIfXTlPnBP9RiaIg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/18/2017", "text": "Very cute restaurant with a great mission and cause. Came here for the first time today and was enchanted by the cute decor and friendly staff! We came here while an event was going on, so the restaurant was pretty full in the dining area (we sat by the bar stools). My friend informed me that usually the staff are all males. On that day, however there were both male and female staff (perhaps for the event, or maybe because they are expanding). Apparently the menu has grown as well, something my friend was VERY excited about.There is a breakfast and lunch menu available, and the coffee is wonderful! And can I just say how much I enjoyed their infused water? It was very zesty, infused with both lemon and lime and a hint of mint. It sits upon the bar counter and patrons are welcome to help themselves. Yum!On to the food.......I got the Tortilla Española, an omelette with potato and my friend got the nutella toast with bacon - don't knock it til you try it! Both were flavorful, savory, and delicious. We must have spent an hour and a half there, catching up, and talking, all while enjoying the atmosphere and the wait staff checked on us periodically and respectfully so (you know some places they come too often, almost making the experience less enjoyable). Definitely worth the food and experience, I will be returning verrrrry soon."}, {"review_id": "GdxkFIpNDD4IzAFeR0rR_A", "user_id": "3_7yIXTK-0SP9rcjTdZDSA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/22/2017", "text": "The concept of this place is amazing. It warms my heart to think these guys who work here are getting another chance to make their lives better. It's as authentic Cuban as one will find in Massachusetts. The server was attentive and very good at his job. We asked a handful of questions about the menu before we ordered. If he didn't know the answer, he was sure to get it from the manager or the chef.We started with an empanada. It was fabulous. It tasted fresh and flavorful. We also had the Cubano Desayuno (without the ham). The sandwich was good and warm. The plantains were FABULOUS! We had a side of seasoned home fries. Unfortunately, those came out at room temperature. They were not warm in the way we wished they were. Also, do yourself a favor and be sure to drink the water--it's infused with lime and mint. Great concept. Great guys. Great atmosphere."}, {"review_id": "b2IZsFEM3eqq5dM-c1nVqA", "user_id": "zyOJ1BS4Mj0_HqjWpNYzTQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/16/2017", "text": "Finally had the Chance to visit Cafe Reyes today. The food was great and the coffee was as well. The service was 5star and the server was very knowledgeable of the menu.

Bright colors, meringue music playing, clean and friendly atmosphere-we quickly forgot that it was Winter, that we were in Worcester and that we were sick! Someone greeted and seated us right away, which was great as we avoided 3 other breakfast joints with long lines. We were lucky to get a parking space right out front , however parking may be scarce next time around (maybe next time we will park at Picadilly plaza and walk over?) The Cafe con Leche was yum! I ordered the 2 eggs with cuban toast and potatoes which was delish, served on nice bright plates. Friendly waiter who was quick to serve us. Everything was neat and clean. Pleasant experience, we will definitely be back to try lunch, maybe a cubano sandwich? And this place helps the local community as it is part of Hector Reyes, a sober treatment house. It's a win-win situation!"}, {"review_id": "SruxL7KE8M7vniqg6HpPiQ", "user_id": "splfcS_Z6XSMmS0j0c2Y6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/17/2017", "text": "This is an interesting concept ... A halfway house training restaurant for Latin American men in a substance abuse/drug treatment program. I like it because you can do some good while eating tasty Cuban food.Nobody would ever mistake grungy Shrewsbury Street for Little Havana but once you step inside Cafe Reyes, you feel like you walked into Miami for a bit.I went on a quest for the perfect Cuban sandwich while I was in Miami. The Cubano I get at Cafe Reyes is honestly as good as anything I tasted in Miami ... And I hit all the well known spots there.They have authentic Cuban coffee and espresso, which are hard to find. I wish they had decaf espresso but only caffinated espresso is available. The coffee here is good ... I don't know a single place in Worcester where you can get actual espresso like this, though.The prices are ridiculously inexpensive. A sandwich and a coffee is around $10 with tip. The sandwich is pretty big and comes with plantain chips on the side.All the servers are very nice and friendly. That was my biggest question the first time I went here. How would the staff be? Clearly, everyone who works here is happy to be a part of this restaurant. The service can be a bit slow because it is a training restaurant so the staff is learning as they go. I'm sure many of them will go on to own their own restaurant or other good things. Nobody here is going through the motions and you will feel like a valued guest here.Overall, it couldn't be any better, except for the parking situation. You might be able to find street parking if you are okay to parallel park ... Or you can park in Piccadilly Plaza a block away and walk. Plenty of outdoor seating on nice days ... The inside restaurant is cozy and clean, although a bit loud."}, {"review_id": "zhGo9YvfHK6oKKVruD-N_A", "user_id": "JMprFcVRRdpOtTHS13Hckg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "The Cuban Sandwich is delicious, and the ropa vieja is so yummy, the prices are very reasonable.

Walking in you're greeted with nice cool colors that are carried through out the place.There is a nice variety of coffees to pick from.  We the had the Cafe frio, which was smooth and the double Cuban cortado, which had a nice kick and it was sufficiently foamy.The place is a bit loud from preparing drinks in the blender and from the staff communicating with eachother; however, we were not bothered by it too much. The staff is friendly. We were greeted when we walked in and shown to our table and our orders promptly taken.We will definitely be back and plan on bringing our breakfast club with us to this Cuban themed cafe. We love that the restaurant is part of a local recovery program for Latino men.P.s. Make sure you ask for a glass of water.  They infuse it with mint and lime and it's really good and refreshing."}, {"review_id": "R_2SoFSN4jqrTA6OP3c6xA", "user_id": "kiAlshXpwj2B8cpZJy_y4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/21/2017", "text": "I've been here probably half a year ago and it is honestly delicious, the guy working there saw me taking photos with my professional camera and asked for a review and I did one on Facebook, but just now remembering I never did one for yelp.
