This business is family owned and you can tell they take pride in their business. I ordered the Gyro plate, The Veggie Plate, hot tea, and Turkish Coffee. Everything was delicious.Usually I'm not a fan of Gyro meat. Often times it's very processed and that means a mouth full of salt. However the meat they use here is very delicious and without salt. The rice was cooked well and the bread and salad that came with the dish were delicious as well. The Veggie plate was a huge surprise! It was delicious!  Everything on the dish was delicious! The hot tea was very strong and very bold. The Turkish coffee was also perfectly prepared. It was delicious as any coffee you'd get in Istanbul or any major city in Turkey. This restaurant is also a specialty Turkish/Middle Eastern goods store. You can venture in the back and look at some of the items they carry. I bought a small copper pot that is used to cook Turkish coffee! I love it! There is a reason why everyone here leaves very pleased and write great yelp reviews. The owners are hardworking individuals who take pride in their restaurant/store. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is warm and welcoming! You can't go wrong with Quality Turkish Market!"}, {"review_id": "ZIYXn87dGWEAaBQgMERTZA", "user_id": "ciDEVtT9olQYdNvjNMc9uQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "I have passed this place hundreds of times. It's easily missed- A small place tucked deep inside a kind of dumpy little strip mall, tucked between a bartending school and an eyebrow threading salon. Don't let the appearance fool you, though. I can honestly say that the meal I had there was one of the best I have had anywhere- And that is saying a lot!\\ They have a banner out by the road advertising their Doner Kebab- Something I have wanted to try, but never had a chance to. We've got a few 'favorite' spots along Kingston pike, and whenever we're in the area, We go to them. It's usually AFTER we've eaten at one of those spots that we drive by this place. Well, I finally stopped. And I am glad I did.Until today, I could count on one hand the number of places that I have eaten where I have had an almost uncontrollable urge to lick the plate clean after eating- Most of the time, these have involved 5-star dining and checks north of $300... Not little hole in the wall places like this.It is a very small place- With an open kitchen, a counter with some stools, and a handful of tables. One thing I noticed was that the place is impeccably clean (and has a health department score of 100 posted). It doesn't feel like you are in a restaurant, but like you are in the owner's kitchen. And- The owners are incredibly friendly.The 'Main attraction' here is the Doner Kebab. For those not familiar with it, think Gyro. It's very similar, except it's the Turkish version. The meat is a seasoned blend of beef and lamb, cooked on a spinning rotisserie. It is shaved off when you order. The Doner meat was good- But the rest of the meal was outstanding.I ordered the Sultans platter. For $12.99, you get to try pretty much everything on the menu. The portions were HUGE, too- Almost too much for one person... Almost. It was so good, there is no way I could have left any on the plate. Other than the Doner meat, everything else was served cold. There is a small house salad. Next, Piyaz- A salad made from white beans with onion, parsley, and sumac. Tabboulleh, which is a salad made from bulgar wheat and vegetables. And- Fresh Hummus. But the real standout, at least for me, was the Babaghannouj. It is an eggplant based salad, and here it is absolutely incredible. I think that it may be my new, all time favorite food. Everything on the plate was great, and it was also a broad range of tastes and textures. You can taste the freshness of the herbs and seasonings used- everything is obviously scratch-made right there. It's small size does have some drawbacks- First, there are only a handful of seats. I don't know if they get busy, but it would fill up fast. Drinks are in a can, or bottle. They seem to do very brisk carry out business at lunch time. This is a place that can't be missed in Knoxville. I WILL be back- Soon. It's almost an hour away from me, but I'd make that drive without hesitation."}, {"review_id": "0VfUQyTGrAWLImiGf5kpYg", "user_id": "Nl5mbLq9XT9tCfgIfGjVwA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "This is definitely a \"hole in the wall\" place that you gotta try!

Medium sized shop that features a restaurant in the front and a limited grocery store in the back. Tons of parking outside and service is very friendly. THE BLACK AND WHITE: I came here during a cross country road trip helping out a friend moving to Denver and we stopped in Knoxville. This place is tucked away in the foreign shopping center mall which is super cool.I ordered the Doner kebab and it came out pretty fast. On the plate, there was a heavily sauced salad, doner meat, 3 quarter sliced pitas, rice, and tzaziki sauce. Everything on plate looked amazing. The salad...even though it was heavily sauce fell short. I was a big fan of the pita. It was warm and tasted freshly made. The Doner tasted a little dry though.The kitchen is open display meaning the chef is right there prepping and cooking in front of you. A lone tv sits above the chef showing Turkish music videos which are super trippy.Note: If you are looking for the bathroom, it is tucked in a maze in the back and once you get in. It seems like you are transported to a wood outpost. The wood wall paper looks surreal.THE FINAL BAMBOO: For the Doner Kebab combo meal, it was $10.82 including tip/tax. Flavors were good but I did have some stomach issues afterwards, not sure if it was the salad or just sitting in the car forever..."}, {"review_id": "Hy8JDx2oCaAswIaU-8n44A", "user_id": "Jd0eh_c9-fMLTLYdebcZWA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I love little dive hole in the walls and this place is exactly that.

I finally decided to try this joint after having it bookmarked for so long. I called asking for catering and he hooked me up! I stopped by to pay and he gave me a free platter so I knew what I was getting into. He chose to pack everything individually so everyone was able to get even portions of everything. The discount he gave me was off the roof! Baklava: Extremely flaky, flavorful, not too sweet, not overwhelming, totally binge-able and it hits the spot perfectly as a dessert. The pistachio pieces to honey ratio were perfectly balanced - you can taste every ingredient and nothing is dominant over the other. It's also a great size but it doesn't help that I had more than one..Way too addicting. I ate these tiny suckers like i vacuum movie theater popcorn. This is exactly why I need to do cardio. Soma (Grape Leaves): not homemade, Aj told me he gets it delivered from Turkey but he makes his own sauce. This was the BEST soma I've ever had. Maybe it's the combo of his sauce? No idea, but I can officially say I'm a fan of somas! It was moist, mushy? but there was just something so different with this soma compared to the numerous amount I've had. Veggie Platter- Tabbouleh (bulgur): not what I expected, it tasted very healthy but not bland, just the way I like it. Talk about a great side of grains! - Piyaz (Bean Salad): nicely seasoned and protein rich! - Babaghanous (Eggplant): this was very different from all the other babas I've had. The consistency was chunky as compared to other babas that are blended and creamy, similar to a hummus dip. Another HUGE difference is that it's smokey! It will taste super acidic initially but after a few more bites, it will hit you. Enjoy that smoke now! - Hummus: on the creamy side. I like mine thicker. =p - House Salad: homemade acidic dressing, tomato, pepper, lettuce, feta cheese. I've had a number of salad with similar dressings but was never fond of it because of the oil proportions. This was definitely a great twist to the dressing. - Pita bread: warmed on a griddle!  Overall, the food was great because it had such a simple distinct taste. I loved when dishes are not bland were I feel like I could have duplicated it at home but at the same time not too flavorful were I feel gross after consuming it. This is something I can eat on a daily. Their choices of spices were spot on. Besides the great food, the family is extremely sweet and you'll get a very clean feel! I asked why they didn't make falafel for the veggie head community and they told me how much of a pain it is and I now appreciate restaurants that make falafel. Love the food. Truly a local Turkish gem in Knoxville."}, {"review_id": "bmyaf3dpGbQU4fyBizgNeA", "user_id": "QvXnV4tPsKLvoeMP5TsclA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/19/2017", "text": "This establishment will have repeat business from us for more than one reason.

I called there knowing they were closed and I was planning to leave a message. The owner answered and told us someone found it, and he'd be there for a while and we could come on by. We drove the 25 minutes from Oak Ridge there and he was waiting outside for us. He didn't have to wait for us, we would've come back this morning, and so that's why I'm giving this place 5 stars!

Im on the hunt to find a spot in Knoxville that I can go to all the time. Im not a fan of American style Mediterranean like Taziki. I really was looking for an authentic place. This place is a family owned business and they have a small market section inside as well. The owner is the one that makes all the food and you can tell that it's been made with love from tasting the food. You can ask her what's in the food or ask for suggestions of what you would want. I got the vegetarian platter and it was so good. It wasn't overly zesty. It just was the perfect balance of everything put together. The grape leaves, never had them before but it was also so good! Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything here. If you want a meat platter, go with the one that has some meat but also has some veggies because I think the meat platter is too heavy for me. The baklava is also very bomb. Has perfect chewy and crunch to them. And has pistachio in them too!! You order food and you sit down. She will bring you the food. And if you want baklava, you just go up to counter and get it. And if you want a drink, you just go in the fridge to get it too. You pay everything at the end. You also can't complain about the prices. It's a very good deal!!
