As I've come to know it, when you say a cheesecake is New York Style that means it is incredibly dense. Take this paragraph from a Chowhound article for example: \"What makes a New York cheesecake official is its dense texture, which feels so smooth and rich you can't eat more than a small-to-medium slice without regretting it later. Because it's heavy. Haters compare it to a brick or a slab of cream cheese on crust. But pro-New York cheesecake enthusiasts are adamant about its superiority.\" bit.ly/2Kpg4IeIf you like a light and fluffy cheesecake then feel free to give this one a try. Maybe it works for that kind of thing. Personally, my craving for the dense wonder that is a NY Cheesecake was left unsatisfied. I didn't even bother finishing the slice, which I've never done before."}, {"review_id": "urjebRzBPheR73l4lmuBzg", "user_id": "G4V9Fj3fMvLsQ3TZpYl3Ug", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Four stars for awesome cakes and pastries.-1 star for the prices.The staff is welcoming and service is fast.

I highly recommend a visit to this tiny but famous bakery whether you're a local or not. Don't be shunned when you see a line out the door. This place is really tiny, but the line moves at a decent speed. I have yet to try everything, but I can speak to several of their desserts.I will note first if you are coming by around the holidays, expect a long line out the door. Order ahead if you want something guaranteed. Also, they serve pies in the morning, cupcakes in the evening, and specific flavors on certain days of the week. I have tried numerous things here: the mini key lime pie, key lime cupcakes, peanut butter cupcakes, brooklyn blackout cake and cupcakes, red velvet cupcakes, chocolate/vanilla sprinkled cupcakes, holiday themed cheesecakes, coconut creme pie, chocolate mousse pie, tri-berry scone, chocolate chunk cookies, and oatmeal raisin cookies.Everything is amazing. My personal favorites are the key lime cupcakes, key lime pie, and chocolate mousse pie. Their selection can be limited or sold out by certain times of the day, so your best bet is to come in the morning or early afternoon, except if you want cupcakes. All their cookies are large, soft baked, and delicious. Their creme pies have a wonderful texture. The list can go on, but I would recommend their creme pies and cupcakes first. I love this place. It's become one of my favorite neighborhood spots. For parties, I've made sure to stop by and get some dessert to bring. The reaction has always been positive. It's a definite must visit in the Upper East."}, {"review_id": "Cn-r4xhpRN8yAXYRPCB5ww", "user_id": "IDlDi16EOMJ9U87f_XNkUQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "I just had the best cupcake!

Well their red velvet cupcakes are to die for! My second review, still the employees are okay.Location: 5 minute walk from 86th station. The bakery is small, seating is probably around 10 people max. The interior is nice, feels like a countryside vibe! Service: The employees are still not that great. I felt like I was discriminated at some point. They smile at certain race but when I came, no smile at all and just ask for my order. Hopefully this will change cause indeed they sell really good pastries.Food: Cupcakes are a must! They come around 11am that is why I don't have pictures! But try the red velvet, brooklyn blackout and carrot! Anyway every flavor is good! I tried the eggnog before it was soo good! For today I had almond cherry scone, which is good! Huge chunks of cherry and almonds in there! Mocha latte is good too! Cakes are a bit pricey!Price rating: 8 out of 10. The only expensive here is the cakes, 15 dollars for a very tiny cake. Other products are okay price.Get the cupcakes!! They are soo good and moist! A must visit bakery in upper east side!"}, {"review_id": "w1aLFQdyuYMIlhWVZHADhQ", "user_id": "gqZoP_DovqwsUJSs1CjfCg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Wow!  WOW!That was my exact reaction when I took my first two bites into their Brooklyn Blackout cupcake.  I can honestly say this is the BEST cupcake I have ever had.  The cake was fresh and moist, the frosting on top was delicious, and the filling inside was fantastic!  I feel bad for any cupcake I try after having tried Two Little Red Hens' cupcake.  It was quite obvious this is a fan favorite as well considering my wife and I took the last two when we went there, but I have a good feeling they do a good job keeping these bad boys stocked-up.  I also had a cup of their coffee and it was very good too.  It went very well with my coma inducing cupcake!If you are looking for a desert option I'd highly recommend coming here and I'd highly recommend the Brooklyn Blackout.  If you're not a fan of chocolate or prefer other flavors they have plenty of other cupcake and cake options to try.  One disclaimer I would make note of this place was very busy mid-day Sunday and the line was starting to go out of the door.  The wait wasn't too bad but do expect a wait during lunch and dinner times with limit space in the store.  There were maybe two tables to sit out so I would not recommend hanging around to eat your desert.  Not sure when I'll be back in NYC, but I can guarantee that I'll be stopping here the next time I am in town."}, {"review_id": "4MnwX1PLaccqup9uincOfQ", "user_id": "6JOgO-HYN90eR9g-c6kNfw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Wow.

And boy is it perfect. It is the most perfect texture. Moist, soft, and not too sweet. I was worried about the pudding on the inside, that it may be overly sweet, but it was perfectly balanced. I was so incredibly impressed. The chocolate flavor really comes through. It's a small store, and just as I ordered, 10 people filled up the space in no time. Absolutely amazing.

First time recently stoping by, small little shop right on the street.

The coconut cream pie cupcake was to die. It was a perfect combination of cream pie and cake! I was skeptical to try it at first thinking the pudding in the cake might be gross, soggy- but it was absolutely delicious! Highly recommend trying it if you're a coconut lover.  The banana cupcake was also insanely good! It taste like banana bread with a yummy cream cheese frosting, it was not overwhelmingly sweet which is a plus for me! The vanilla fudge was as expected, cooked perfect, yummy homemade frosting!  They are available for orders and if you want a specific Cake, full pie I would order ahead!

I was craving cupcakes on a Saturday night and stopped by here after hearing others rave about it. It was getting close to the end of the night for them since they were starting to run out of things, but I was able to get 4 of their cupcakes. Red velvet, key lime, coconut, and carrot. All of them were so good and I'm so glad I got all 4. Although they were all amazing and i would get all of then again, my favorite was the key lime. It had the most perfect sour key lime filling, with a light vanilla frosting....So good!! I also really liked how much the coconut flavor stood out in the coconut cupcake. I got a mint tea with my cupcakes, which was good, and we were able to grab a table inside but they only have a couple tables so most people take their dessert to go.

The lattes were wonderful and the baked goods Devine! Absolutely loved the maple latte. It was a perfect start to each morning in the city. The cupcakes (which don't start coming out until 11am) we're some of the best I had ever had. I was devastated when I found out they weren't selling them yet before leaving the city. I wanted to bring them back home for my family. Instead I brought home some muffins and scones which were also incredible! The scone was moist and soft and delicious which can be difficult to achieve with scones. I had never seen a pear ginger scone before and knew I had to try one.

I love everything about this bakery...the quaint space is so charming, but the baked goods, well... they will keep you coming back over and over. My favorites are the cupcakes... ultimately, the Brooklyn Blackout is my winner. However, the Red Velvet, Banana, Coconut, Peanut Butter, the plain chocolate cupcake with the buttercream frosting is lovely too. Over the fall, they had a Spice cake cupcake with a cream cheese frosting that was yummy.. yet, let's move on to the other bits... The cheese cake is amazing, toppings or not, depends on your preference.. the cookies are great, scones in early mornings and I'm a fan of the mini Coconut Cream pies too, as they remind me of being a child when my mom or dad would make them...They offer cakes in several sizes and flavors, smaller pies, cupcakes in a few sizes and typically coffee/tea, & water.. Early mornings.. they serve scones and muffins, they're gone by mid morning typically. Then, the magic starts happening with the cupcakes. On typical days, I will stop by for a coffee and a cupcake, or have picked them up  with family, friends to stay and share... or alone to take home for a later time.. after having a bite next door. You really cannot beat this place... it gets busy and they will run out of the favorites by early evening, depending on the day, or around holidays. Don't get discouraged about the line... you typically just walk in and there is a line to order, so I would recommend that you spend this time figuring out your game plan when it's your turn.

On any day of the week a line can form at this little bakery with people just waiting to get their hands on some cookies, cakes, cupcakes, coffee, etc. Don't be surprised if they are out of some things because of high demand, especially by later in the day. They offer a few seats, but it's probably best to take your snack to go during peak hours. Everything sold is a very reasonable price for the quality they are (i.e. a small cake of about 4\" will run you about $15).

It was my husband's birthday and I got him his favorite yellow cake with Swiss vanilla buttercream. I tried to ask for no sprinkles but it seemed not possible. It was a good idea to let the cake sit at the room temperature for a while and let the buttercream soften.I have also gotten a slice of cheesecake and cherry pie. The cheesecake was indeed again the best in NYC! The cherry pie was very good and I was able to tell that they made the sauce in-house. About two days prior, we went there with one of my coworkers. We got a mini chocolate cupcake, a regular yellow cupcake, and a carrot cupcake.  Normally, I don't like carrot cakes but this one was very good!

We came here around 6pm on a Wednesday and stayed for about 45 minutes to relax and enjoy our delicious treats. The line NEVER died down during our time there and the workers are very efficient! They also never ran out of a flavor. As soon as one ran low, they immediately restocked it.There are displays of their cakes to go (3 different sizes), cupcakes, and pies. I love that they have mini versions of all their cupcakes! It's really the perfect size if you want to try multiple flavors.Since it was PI DAY, we could't leave without getting a slice of pie. We got an apple pie + mini brooklyn blackout cupcake + mini peanut butter fudge cucpake for the two of us.EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS! - Brooklyn blackout is definitely a chocolate lovers dream - rich chocolate cake with a lighter chocolate pudding? inside, topped with chocolate frosting. Half a mini was definitely enough for me. This looks like the most popular flavor here- Peanut butter fudge cupcake is a PB lovers dream (aka me!) - chocolate cupcake with light peanut butter pudding? inside, topped with chocolate and peanut butter swirled frosting. LOVED this!- Apple pie was standard, but delicious nonetheless. Not sure if all their cupcakes have a filling inside, or just the ones we ordered. I would definitely come back to buy their round cakes for a special occasion. The 4 inch ones are so cute!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/two-little-red-hens-new-york-4?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
