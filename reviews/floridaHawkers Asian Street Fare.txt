Went in on a Friday evening, the area and restaurant was busy with a 20-30 minute wait. While waiting, I went to a nearby rooftop bar and grabbed a drink. By the time I completed my drink, our table was ready. The waitresses were extremely attentive and knowledgeable of the menu items. I had a few questions and wanted to know what was recommended. For drinks, we grabbed sake flights and all asked for fruity sake versions. Clearly this was a girls night out. All of the sake provided and recommended were delicious. This was a first for me as well. I don't remember the names but the flavors were apple, pineapple, and banana. For food, we grabbed Pad Thai, Roti Canai, 5-Spice Beans, Chicken Egg Rolls, and Kin's Prawn Mee.I love everything except the 5-Spice Snap Beans, I was highly disappointed in the taste. Spice to me is not what that was. They were sweet and tasted like sugar and cinnamon it was a very indifferent and unique combination. I had to send them back. Otherwise, the food was great. I loved my noodle soup. It was so tasty! I will definitely be returning to try some different items."}, {"review_id": "jetF1wBxUvOe3thILGmBVA", "user_id": "MDYQ03GNceQ2nXxfLdIeGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "So we were a party of four on a Friday night with no reservation. The girls at the hostess stand were super sweet and i gave my name and number and she said it would be about 30 minutes but they would text me. We went to the park across the street (picture perfect with birds in a pond with 2 big fountains) and 15 minutes later got a text that our table would be ready in the next five minutes!After we were seated, we met our server named Blue. She went over the menus with us because it was our first time and recommended a few dishes. My mother has a very severe allergy and they treated her wonderfully and made sure our apps were shellfish free just in case we would share.We had the twice fried wings and OMG YES. The garlic sweetness is so right. The garlic chili pepper edamame was also very good. Everything came out quickly, just like our drinks.The only negative i have about our visit is the hair found in the lettuce wraps. Blue had the manager take it off the bill (though the manager never made a table visit). Also, we thought a plate of satay tenders came with the lettuce wraps but apparently one of the food runners got the table wrong. The particular food runner did have like 3 inch long nails that almost went in my husband's soup (also a negative).The overall taste of the food and service received was 5 stars. I will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "Z3GYRenh0QIvSlMbbr47kw", "user_id": "AiqG2JzKlmjzYaBxXAGcJQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Hawkers Asian Street Fare is in my top ten list of my favorite places to eat in Jacksonville. The roti, Korean twice fried wings, duck bao, pad Thai, chicken lo Mein, beef haw fun, and ginger cheesecake are all amazing. Like 1,000 stars amazing. The service is fantastic and they serve the food just how I like it, immediately when it is hot and ready, so be prepared to get your dishes at different times. This concept is perfectly fine for me, because when you eat here, the wait time for a table is super long (at dinner about an hour) and by the time you sit down you are so hungry you are willing to eat the napkins. As far as alcoholic drinks go, they only serve beer and wine, which ain't no thang but a Korean twice fried chicken wang because their craft beer list is bomb and their wine/sake list includes some yummies.  If you haven't been to Hawkers, pack a snack for your wait and go get some delicious food.

He finally got out with the help of two coworkers with the lady being the one to step up first #obvifem.The food was dope!!!! I got the one with chicken shrimp and steak, let me look it up really quick....Hokkien Mee..so damn good! Ugh I miss you Hawkers come to me in Indy! We also got their Hawker 5 spice wings and they are delish with cinnamon and nutmeg sugar love and extra love. I'm sure garlic and some other lovely baby but they were so damn good. They also only sell Asian beers and the one I got was perfect and smooth. Check out my pic if you're interested.Oh I forgot their beautiful recycled furniture and lovely lighting.

Also got the twice fried wings and chicken egg rolls. I caught myself eating the last little bit of pad Thai like I was at home. Bowl up to my lips scraping the pieces I couldn't pick up with my sticks right into mouth. It was very good and wish the portion was larger or came in different sizes.  The wings and egg rolls were cooked perfectly but nothing special to me about the flavors. Kinda loud and busy place but nothing I can't tolerate.  Will definitely eat here again04/01/18Easter Sunday and I'm back again. Today I ordered Prawn Mee a spicy seafood soup. Very flavorful, right amount of heat...tasty. Also tried the roti with curry sauce. Mine were on the greasy side, not at all light and fluffy. Kind of like when you put something in oil that hadn't heated up yet. The curry sauce had a light curry flavor and seemed more thin like a broth. I seen others rave about this particular dish and it was just ok for me. Maybe I got a not so good batch but won't be ordering those again. I'll still come back and venture out further on the menu."}, {"review_id": "RYQjYFKl4YBuYA_580dBLA", "user_id": "f3Udg7gI8sBkIL2_yUBDFg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "There's a first time for everything. I was a little bit afraid while ordering at Hawkers, as it was my first time visiting the restaurant and my first time trying food I've never heard of (I know, sad). But it all turned out great! Their menu offers so much, and if you don't know what they're talking about, it can be a bit confusing. I ended up asking our server about what to order, and she was great help! The restaurant offers shareable small plates, which is great as it adds to the variety of foods to try. They also give you the food once it's ready, so your plates might arrive at different times. But this is a good thing, because it guarantees that it's going to be served hot and fresh- just the way you like it. Their food is delicious, though I've never tried anything like it to compare it's taste to other similar foods'. I highly recommend the Roti Canai (Malaysian)- it's a personal favorite. I also ordered some noodles and dumplings, and they're just as flavorful. Our experience was great; our server knew about every food on the menu, and she was quick to help us. The restaurant has outside seating. So if you want some fresh air, or a romantic setting during nighttime (they have outside heaters), this is a great place to try. My only advice is to never be afraid to try foods you've never heard of, because you will for sure do this in a restaurant like Hawkers. I did it, and I loved the experience."}, {"review_id": "GA_ljmO5oMSjZ-hKSEd3Iw", "user_id": "f3FRmcrdSO3i2y03OZZ5WA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Hawkers is me and my husbands favorite date night spot, it's always crowded but the food is always good and so is the service.

We got the roti, golden wontons, five spice naked chicken wings, wonton noodle soup, hokien mee noodles, and the mango sticky rice for dessert. The roti will continue to be my favorite. Keep in mind the $3 price only comes with 1 so if you want more (which you will) to get more for an additional amount. The golden wontons are fried to perfection and so full of minced pork and shrimp. The dipping sauce is an Asian sweet and sour chili that goes really well with the wontons. The five spice (which I've had before but with a different meat) was a lot better than I remember! Maybe because I love chicken wings but the sweet and salty taste of the seasoning was surprisingly satisfying. My least favorite had to be the wonton noodle soup. The wontons and noodles were very starchy and i felt as if I was eating bits of flour with every bite. The soup was a bit bland but adding some chili oil (ask for the spice rack!) helped a little big. While it was a big portion of food, I probably wouldn't get that again. The Hokien mee is a stir fry noodle with veggies, meat, and seafood. It was delicious. If you like the charred flavor from bbq a grill then you'll love this! The flavors were rich, smoky, and deep. The noodles were cut very short but the flavors made up for it. And lastly, the dessert. The sticky rice is mixed with coconut (it's purple rice!) and then topped with a mango sorbet with pieces of fruit. I thought the rice was a bit hard to chew but the mango was super refreshing. We had a great experience (thanks Avery! You were the best waitress).

It's a love affair I never want to end. I want it to be hot and heavy, continually in the honeymoon phase, never to crash and burn. I'm not 100% certain, but if I had to bet money on it, Hawkers is the only restaurant that I've eaten every single menu item. You heard that right, every menu item. Essentially, Hawkers should take money directly from my bank account on the first of each month. That's how much money I spend here.I have my favorite dishes, but nothing can top the Roti Canai. It's absolute perfection. It's served atomically hot, and I burn my mouth upon each bite. When it comes to Hawkers, I have no self control.Pad Thai, Chow Faan, Kimchi Fried Rice, Miso Ramen, Wok Fried Lettuce, Curry Mashed Potatoes, Siou Yoke, Bulgogi Tacos, Seared Octopus, etc. To be honest, it blows my mind how every dish that made the final cut on their menu is solid. The only logical complaint is their overwhelming popularity. I'm incredibly proud to be a regular at Hawkers, and humbled by their growth and expansion in the Southeast. These guys deserve every penny they earn.Jacksonville wouldn't be the same without Hawkers 5 Points. It's the most reviewed restaurant in our city for a reason!

I still remember being introduced to Hawkers by a work-friend, and now, I cannot remember how many times I've been there. Recently, I've also been there twice in one day, which just tells you how addictive this place is. There's nothing you can complain about at Hawkers. The ambiance, consistently tasty food, constant new additions to the menu, wide variety of drinks and great service - Hawkers is the best at everything. To have a good experience, you should arrive to this place as early as possible, in order to find a parking spot closer to the restaurant and also avoid any possible wait times. I have tried almost every dish on their menu - new and old, but I will try summarize some best 'not-to-miss' ones. You have to start off with their signature Roti Canai even before you place an order for drinks. It is almost like a pre-appetizer, and will get you all worked up for the orgasmic food experience you're about to have. For appetizers, their meat skewers (specially, the Bulgogi Chicken/Beef) and Korean Chicken Wings can never go wrong. If you are a vegetarian, Hawker's Delight will surely leave you delightful - stir-fried tofu and veggies in their signature sauce. A few other appetizer favorites are - Coconut Shrimp, Mashed Potatoes with Curry Sauce, Meatballs with Curry and Sichuan Wontons. They have a wide variety of menu for Entrees. If you are a noodle-soup person like me, their Curry Laksa and Prawn Mee will satisfy all your cravings. If you are a noodle person, Char Kwa Teo (I hope I spelled it right, haha), Singapore Mei Fun and Pad Thai are the best ones to try. Their Kimchi Fried Rice is a big hit as well. Hawkers is for food lovers, who always crave for delicious food experiences. The food here never disappoints you and the staff are real friendly. They know their menu and surely suggest you their best dishes if you're over whelmed by their huge menu!"}, {"review_id": "1YN37znOAYG4W7FAM_HJUA", "user_id": "zsFwn0cq22i5lSr4w6J-kQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "In town for a family wedding. Very close to some friends that we never seem to have time to visit when heading down to Florida. But this time we were close to them and had a few hours to kill be the event. This was just about the best decision that we made on the whole trip. The entire experience was AMAZING. We started with some local beers of course.  I got the Funky Buddha Floridian Hefeweizen, a 5.2% ABV and my man got the Swamp Head Big Nose IPA, a 7.3% ABV. Both of these were very good and we will definitely try some more once we are back in Florida. Most everything here is a small plate that is great for sharing with friends or family. Between the four of us we shared five different small plates and both couples shared another small plate. They we all shared one of the noodle bowls. We started with the Five Spice Green Beans. Which were lightly battered and fried up nice and crispy. The batter was so light it was white and flaked off of them, but again they were amazing. Then we got the Curry Mashed Potatoes, self explanatory. Not too spicy but just right and plenty to share with even four people Next were the Sichuan Wontons, which came with at least six. Again more than enough to share. Each one was filled with chicken and shrimp and veggies. The dipping sauce was amazing. Then came the Roti Canai, which is Malaysian flatbread that came with a side of their signature curry sauce. The sauce was not too spicy but just perfect. The order came with one piece of bread and then you could add additional pieces. So we got three extra pieces for an extra charge of course. It was totally worth it and I know at least me and my man could have eaten another piece or two each. Each of us couples got the Five Spice Fish Tacos on recommendation of the server and the locals we ate with, of course. It came as two perfect size to have on top of everything else we had already shared. They were amazing. Each had two pieces of fish, cucumbers, red onions and some type of white mayo/sauce and a sprig of cilantro. Next to last were the Korean Twice Fried Wings. The plate came with four or five wings and topped with garlic Gochujang sauce, peanuts, sesame and cilantro. They were super crunchy and the flavor just like everything else was incredible. We finished off by sharing a bowl of noodles, the Singapore Mei Fun. Which was comprised of curry rice noodles, shrimp, chicken breast, eggs, onions, bell peppers, scallions and bean sprouts. If you were lucky enough to be in the area so you could eat here regularly, this would be the perfect sized lunch bowl. The flavor again was insane, everything was cooked to perfection. We had more than enough to share between four people. Overall, this place is amazing. If you live anywhere in Florida it is worth the trip to stop by and get your grub on. The prices are very reasonable as well. We picked up the tab for all four of us, so it also included two additional beers and two Vietnamese Coffees. Still we all got more than enough to eat and got to have some drinks and the total was still under $100. We will definitely be back and hopefully soon. My mouth is watering just thinking about the food and wonderful flavors."}, {"review_id": "ArqH8IsLmo6wr0Lhmuwuqw", "user_id": "yEDIBPu1xQE2tDieqcTttw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "Hawker's is one of our local favorites.
