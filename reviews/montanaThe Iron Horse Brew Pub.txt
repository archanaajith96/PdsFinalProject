Been going to the I-Ho for years and the food is delicious and portions are good sized (only place with larger portions is Tamarack), and the atmosphere and service are always great. Wonderful place for families and/or to watch sports. The summer seating is awesome and has a lot of shaded areas. Food-wise: Buffalo Chicken Salad and the Griz Burger (pictured) are my top choices but like I said, never been disappointed."}, {"review_id": "sMsUIQ8FiL4J6g3e9Z_nlA", "user_id": "ajJUmmi5wDHpJK8Bw88aKg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "We went to the Iron Horse for lunch.  My biggest annoyance was that when we asked for some ranch dressing it took forever to arrive (meal half eaten) and then they charged us $.75.  This may sound trivial but it left a bad taste in our mouth, so to speak.  Also the coleslaw was ridiculously sloppy and had an overpowering sour taste. I could not finish it. On the positive side the salmon BLT was great. My wife also liked the salmon wrap although it had a bit too much rice in it.  The sweet potato fries tasted fine. The service was mediocre. True, the restaurant was busy but the waitress could've done better.  We will definitely look for better places to eat in downtown Missoula."}, {"review_id": "PjWAAIknjjGRFjJfFKVeTw", "user_id": "dKCEIzXWKjQoorZ4R6PBvg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/4/2017", "text": "We ate here twice while in Missoula. They do a great job with burgers. My husband had a regular old meat burger and I had a black bean burger on a GF bun. I rarely get to have a gluten free veggie burger so when I do it's a real treat. I had 1/2 garlic parmesan fries and 1/2 sweet potato fries the first time. Both were really good so next time I asked for them to do a garlic parm sweet potato fry...out of this world good. My husband is still raving about the Kettlehouse Cold Smoke Scotch Ale he had. It was so good that we went across the street and got some to bring home to Seattle. The staff was really friendly and accommodating and the umbrella seating on the front patio was perfect for a warm summer day. We will definitely be back again next time we are in town."}, {"review_id": "bANs-xY4BisfF6iqwAqb1g", "user_id": "vx7Emd2mQArTUH0jwzHYog", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/12/2017", "text": "Love it!  Great location, great service, great food. Their steak salad is my fav. The only tip is don't sit outside if you have a bee allergy like me. As you know, bees are critical to our food supply so we should not mess with them and we should let them bee (pun intended). This restaurant has THE nicest outdoor sitting space with beautifully maintained foliage that provides some shelter from the hot August sun. . . If you don't mind an occasional visit from a hard working bee."}, {"review_id": "NLcaeJbdijAiHTrq70RaHA", "user_id": "hiktUFKmtYkn_aVDlDknUg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/10/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "New menu, much better consistency, and FINALLY aren't giving out styrofoam to-go containers!!!

The service was great, but I got the feeling that our server was disappointed. We told him up front that we just needed to cool down and have a drink. We had a cold adult beverage and an appetizer, spicy avocado hummus. It was fabulous! The menu is very sports bar and nothing stood out to me as being something I couldn't live without. The table next to us had some stuff that looked pretty good. All in all, for a drink and an appetizer, it's not that bad."}, {"review_id": "ScEAuwaEAfUkYS2V8MFAYg", "user_id": "PKP_hw7Qo45zZN3m1FhyxQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "This place has all the signs of an absentee owner.  Not terribly busy at 11 pm, a waitress was quick to tell us we couldn't sit in the only nice quiet area of the pub as it was closed, but she was nowhere to be found when it was time to order. Went to the bar to order, bill came to $22. I handed over two 20's. Bartender gave me two fives and seven ones, and disappeared. I left a two dollar tip anyway, and called him out on it later. Bathroom not dirty, but not tidy. Beers basic, not too expensive.

Pretty much starts to fill up and overflow in summer around 7pm, and winter around 6pm. Then students, yuppies, Barflies, hit the bar for happy hour. The dining options there are pretty good. Their cheeseburger and fries are good, as well as crab cakes, and chicken tandoori salad. I also like their quesadillas a lot. I like to get there by noon to avoid their lunch rush. I avoid the nightlife there if possible it's a great way to blow too much money then have to walk home or take a taxi."}, {"review_id": "plfjftq2I5GmViSWiE15kg", "user_id": "2V38uXzhv1hALwOFtDognA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/9/2017", "text": "\"Bless this poor California boy's heart,\" my waitress probably thought, when I asked what kind of creature a buffalo elk was. Apparently a buffalo elk burger is actually a burger made from both buffalo (the animal, not the city) and elk. I'd assumed that a buffalo elk had the head of an elk and the butt of a buffalo, or, I dunno what I thought but doesn't buffalo elk sounds like a thing? Or a Neneh Cherry song? No? Anyway, it was delicious, served on a brioche bun with Gouda and apple compote. I would like to not think about them smooshing a live elk and a buffalo into each other, I mean, I bet it would hurt -- ugh, bottom line is that I don't want to think about the mechanics of it but I wouldn't mind eating a burger that killed not just one but two delicious animals again."}, {"review_id": "330Wiegdw1JtvZYuCFJDUg", "user_id": "1A1xAfIytuGADGa-05zjzg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/18/2017", "text": "This downtown pub is legit.
