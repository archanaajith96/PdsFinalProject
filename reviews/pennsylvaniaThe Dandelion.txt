British gastropub food can be heavy and bland but the Dandelion did the classics well and had some seasonal additions that were fresh and lovely. Husband had the burger which was a perfect hot/salty/sweet/soft/meaty/vinegary melange. The spring version of a green salad with tasty, varied lettuces, avocado, and lemon vinaigrette made me feel better about consuming the Mac and cheese after. Pro tip- get a half portion as a side. Blame it on your kid but they end up eating half the branzino with farro, beets, fennel and grapefruit. It was delicious and perfect with a glass of sparkling rose (for mommy of course). We walked in on a Saturday at 6 and were quoted an hour wait. I'm glad we didn't bail because they called us back in 20 minutes. Perfect to shop or chill in Rittenhouse square while you're waiting for the table."}, {"review_id": "dbzNYJQjZdOLySdg-dRu4Q", "user_id": "GmQR50bIII7gDNRYEgfXfA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "The Dandelion transports me back to London. Starting with the space - it almost reminds me of something in Harry Potter; it's a dimly lit with wooden floors that a bit creaky & the walls feature wall paper and antique-like fixtures. I'm sure my memory embellished that a little, but it's charming. I love that the menu is classic gastropub, but sprinkled with Indian influence like. I recall having the best Indian food of my life in London so I appreciated the nod! We had the following cocktails/snacks/entrees. I also really enjoyed the starter bread! *PIMM'S DELUXE (pimm's #1, bluecoat gin, lemon, muddled cucumber): This cocktail was great. Refreshing! *DEVILED EGGS: I don't recall what flavor it was, but it was a good deviled egg. Came with 4. *BEER BATTERED FISH & CHIPS (line caught cod, tartar sauce and triple cooked chips): Wow, so flaky with just the right breading to fish ratio. I also loved the savoriness of it; they definitely made sure to salt the cod! *Corn Porridge (corn, tomatoes, hen of the woods): Got this dish because of the hen of the woods. I LOVE hen of the woods and Dandelion prepared it beautifully. The smoky char was fantastic with the creamy corn porridge (kind of like mashed potatoes!) and tomato. Yum. 124/365"}, {"review_id": "gP_U7--fBfk135b2-oS_xA", "user_id": "-WGIh3Tf_9ulKFIBXIt24w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I was here on a work trip and decided to check out this British gastropubThe resto has a cute British vibe and often hosts high tea every day .

Over the years I've had, Macaroni & Cheese, Duck Bolognese, House Made Ricotta, English Style Cheese Board and a few others. As the food fares, I've never been blown away. Every experience here has seemed pretty bland. The only reason I go back is for the Deviled Eggs. It's quite peculiar. On one hand I'm not a fan of Curry (it can be overpowering and I can't handle heat), yet their blend of spices for the filling are bold, savory, and well balanced. It's a shame this place doesn't give off a better experience considering it's not cheap but nevertheless maybe one day they will rise to the occasion."}, {"review_id": "4X42uhj7YJW_bGlh8PXQBw", "user_id": "WMK-2Su_q2GoxhchmotOsw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "This is a brunch review only. I've been wanting to go here for a while and it did not disappoint. I ordered the English Breakfast because I wanted to try the black pudding. It reminded me of scrapple and now I'm a huge fan! I was expecting more of irony taste to it but didnt really get much. Also came with eggs, bacon, sausage, fried bread, tomato, mushroom and baked beans. Bacon was melt in your mouth crispy with a slight smokiness to it. Never thought I would enjoy baked beans for breakfast but I can't knock it. Fiance ordered the Royale and he was very happy with it.Bloody Mary fans will love the Dandelion's bloody. Super fresh and you can get half or full. I went with the full because it's basically two bloodys for $14. This is a steal compared to most other restaurants charging $10+ for one.Service was excellent and attentive. Loved the quirky decor that created a homey feel. Nice outside area right in the sun for a lovely brunch. Next time I'll bring my dog!"}, {"review_id": "q4gGDlqp1aBiHYCZha9YWw", "user_id": "NcOobrUnuD0PMMieAA49TQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Was able to snag a spot here before seeing Seinfield over the weekend. We were seated right away and I have to really say that the service from start to finish was A++. I have never had a better experience with staff and they were all very welcoming and honestly I give this place a high rating because of this experience. We tuckered down into our seats and I decided to try one of the cocktails. Once I was slightly inebriated , I decided to order the bacon wrapped pork terrine for the table.  While we waited for our app our waitress brought us some amazingly fresh bread to munch on. Then the terrine came out with even more bread and honestly they should just let you use the table bread because that's already so good, but at least I was able to mix and match the bread combo, haha. For entree I wanted to be reminded of my pleasant time across the pond and chose to order the rabbit pie. I was fairly disappointed that the \"pie\" was really a flaky bread on the top of the dish, as so many restaurant now a days tend to do, instead of a completely encased rabbit pie. It was pretty tasty but was only a pale shadow of the pies I was able to experience in London.  Though I digress, I would check this place out if not for the food definitely for the wonderful service they give."}, {"review_id": "QfmFCYMBH13UqpGG5XU8LA", "user_id": "C2nzoqU60AcRPHpCBsEScQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "I ordered the House Blend Aged Beef Burger.  I asked for a medium temperature - came out more on the medium rare.   Comes with cheddar, pickles, bacon, and a church hill sauce.  I thought that this had too much bun.  The chips (fries) were good.  Thick cut of potatoes and well seasoned.

The atmosphere and ambiance is very unique and there are multiple rooms with different decorations inside. We got three dishes, the English Breakfast, a salmon pate, and bangers and mash. I enjoyed the salmon pate because it had a nice salmon flavor without being too fishy, and the fish was not too raw or too overcooked. Overall the texture was very nice.Unfortunately I liked the bangers and mash less. The sauce and gravy itself was decent - salty with a strong onion flavor. The two pieces of sausage included were less great. I felt like they lacked a lot of sausage flavor and maybe were too bland. The English breakfast had bacon but I felt like it was slightly too smoky. The sausage in that dish was very similar to the bangers and mash, and it also had a very mild 'gasoline' type flavor. The egg also could have been fried a little more.Overall the prices seemed a little high for simple food. The main dishes were around $16 but I did not think they were too special. The final conclusion: Good for the ambiance and maybe small appetizer dishes, but don't come for regular brunch food done well."}, {"review_id": "Khj39QXPQYId2rChoWMlaA", "user_id": "QuXY2IRH9aIdexbc2ClN4Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "I had quite high expectations for the Dandelion, as I've heard multiple friends rave about it. Unfortunately, I'm not sure it lived up to the hype. We came around noon on a Wednesday, and despite the restaurant being relatively quiet, it took over an hour for us to get our food. Admittedly, we had a large group of 11 people. It wasn't so much the slow service as the lack of it, however. I wanted to order something on the side to help balance out the saltiness of my dish, but the waiter never ended up coming back, and we had to ask the hostess to bring the check. In terms of the actual food, we tried a couple different appetizers: a cheese platter, prawns (with cocktail sauce), and the house ricotta with sourdough bread. The first two were good but nothing exceptional, but the ricotta spread was rich and creamy and paired well with sourdough. My entree was the shepherd's pie, and as mentioned above, was extremely salty (and TINY for $18.50). I wish it came with something else on the side, even a piece of bread, since it just felt like it was incomplete. The flavors were good, but I couldn't finish as it was just too salty and I had drank all of the water at the table. Overall not a fantastic experience at one of the more popular restaurants in town. I could be interested to come back some time in the future as my experience seems unusual."}, {"review_id": "SMJv2Vfo-s-Pvx2-9btQsw", "user_id": "WO6L5yMX5LEeJuMNMjerRQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "Dinner: SUNDAY ROASTAny other time: gotta do TEA TIMEDinner:Came here for Valentine's Day and had an amazing experience.

The setting is a historic three storey house that could have easily been set in Diagon Alley in Harry Potter. We ate on the bottom floor near the bar and didn't really get to experience the other floors too much but I imagine they are all equally as inviting. The hostess is on the second floor so we had to check in there and wait for a table since we didn't have a reservation. If you don't have a reservation and have to wait, don't get discouraged since the food is really worth the wait. When we got seated we got the opportunity to really look around and appreciate the the lovely little fancy English teatime touches like bread plates decorated with what looked like hand-painted ivy borders and some pretty cool boar's heads mounted around the bar. Now on to the food. We were served some delicious honey oat bread, which had hints of molasses and some salty sour dough. Both were delicious. This was served with what I believe was a house made country butter. This place carries several ciders and since I'm not a fan of beer I really appreciated that. I tried the magners pear cider and although it doesn't come on tap I tried it and enjoyed it. It was reminiscint of this non alcoholic pear drink called peardrax that I remember having for a treat as a kid. My friend ordered the seasonal chai hot cider and was a huge fan. She said it was one of the best things she had ever drank. My friend wasn't that hungry, go figure, so ordered the Bibb salad which she said was really good. The salad came with pomegranates, apple slices, Stilton cheese and a spicy walnut honey vinaigrette dressing. I opted for the fish and chips since it seemed like the right thing to order at a traditional British place. Although this was a little difficult to eat with a fork and knife, it was flakey flavorful and delicious. I eventually just abandoned my fork and knife and picked up my fish and ate it like a savage. :) I must add that the food presentation was well thought out and inviting. The dessert menu was interesting offering such things as molten lava cake and treacle tarts. We tried both of these and were not disappointed. Ice cream and sorbet is housemade daily but we will have to try those next time we are in town. There was a flapjack ice cream on the menu that I'm interested in next time.Staff was attentive. Decor was on point. Well located in a Lovely historic building on a street corner in downtown Philadelphia. I don't have to say much else. Can you tell that I'm a huge fan of this place and intend to return."}, {"review_id": "fpjg2IbMXgbLNCVPoEJYDw", "user_id": "kmh26B5KG2zLTh0l5WgZ_w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The manager reached out and explained that the weird slimy thing that we found in our dessert was a harmless vanilla bean.

When we informed our waiter of the table's allergies he was quick to apologize for not separating the dishes and took it back.

It didn't really live up to a British pub or afternoon tea experience, but I appreciated some aspects of home.Disclaimer: I just came for Afternoon Tea so I did not try any of the meals here, though the menu did look appealing.Firstly, the decor was quite cute and quirky. I had no idea that the restaurant had so many floors, but as we were led up some skinny stairs to a huge third floor area, I felt as if I was walking through a house in Harry Potter. The place did feel somewhat like a British pub, which I appreciated. The dog decor on our floor was an added bonus.I was a little disappointed about the options for afternoon tea. The tea selection was somewhat limited and the scones were completely not my thing. I am an avid scone-lover and will have them at least once a week while I'm in the UK. These were definitely American scones, with extra sugar on the top and everything. They were thin and hard, and just not what I think of as a scone, which was really disappointing. The sticky toffee pudding was more British, but still not quite satisfying.Overall, I enjoyed the vibes of the restaurant, and while it may be British-inspired, it is definitely an American twist."}, {"review_id": "bT2ghqmkb_90kKW6kyi73Q", "user_id": "TBtZ0m-FG22_tjaZRVOauQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "I can't write about the lunch and dinner menu but the afternoon tea experience at dandelion was excellent.
