All you need to know is they are all very decent)We booked our seats on opentable and ordered the usual tasting menu as well as the vegetarian tasting menu. The amuse bouche is a cabbage flavored chicken broth shot with cheese mousse. As a chef myself, I've nothing but respect to this first dish. The cabbage is well cooked to remove the earthy bitterness yet preserved it's unique sweetness which is well represented in the chicken broth. The cheese mousse added an additional layer of texture and salty flavor the the already-amazing dish, bringing it to the next level. 1st dish (non-veg) is a cold cut scallop. decent1st dish (veg) is a veg soup. refreshing and decent2nd dish (non-veg) is lobster with vegetable. The lobster meat is so tender and perky. The flavor is well contrasted by the hint of bitterness from the vegetables (asparagus, among others), highlighting the sweetness and savory of the meat. Respect!2nd dish (veg) is citrus topped with nuts and sauted vegetables. THE BEST citrus dish i've had among all the fine dining place and def one of the best veg dish.3rd dish (non-veg) is seared fish with daikon. The dish is extremely untraditional as it almost tastes like a Chinese dish, yet extremely well-done within the scope of New American cooking. 3rd dish (veg) is a salad highlighting the roast carrot. MY ABSOLUTE favourite. The dish is meticulously balanced to induce the sweetness and the sophisticate texture of the carot. It's always hard to cook a vegetarian dish cuz very few vegetable can be the backbone of a fine-dining-level dish. Tonight, I'm delight to see Gramercy taking a shot at it and give such amazing solution. I'd go back again just for this dish4th dish (non-veg) is cheese & bacon ravioli. Very decent dish, amazing flavor. In general, you could hardly go wrong with cheese and bacon. So this is almost like cheating :)4th dish (veg) is a vegetable raviolo. Frankly a disappointment. The vegetable is not fully cooked and hard to chew down. The raviolo is also not well cooked5th dish (non-veg) is duck breast. Well cooked, the flavor of the duck is well presented. If you've been to Hong Kong, you might find the flavor to be close to a Cantonese roast (in a good way).5th dish (veg) is brussels sprout salad. Frankly another disappointment. As the main dish, it fail to surpass the 3rd dish in it's flavor or it's texture, thus causing major disappointment. To be honest, I'd even say the SweetGreen salad is no worse than this.I'm no expert in dessert, so I'll leave that part to other reviewers.Overall, I'd say the non-veg tasting menus is super strong and well worth the price, while the veg tasting menus has a strong start but went down hill after 3rd dish. From the entire experience, you can definitely see the emphasis on vegetable in both menus and the innovative use of them. I salute such brave trials cuz I don't know how to structure a vegetable based main dish either. It's a world class problem in the culinary space.Will I come again?Yes + 1 hundred times. Dining here is like talking to the chef and constantly learn sth new. A restaurant with such long tradition yet so innovative and forward looking deserves frequent visits"}, {"review_id": "cB5JR6cdMitXP_KExbp9bg", "user_id": "TmYkvvBaC-zmcTVz5qaMTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "This place really went above and beyond to make my dinner anniversary super special. They were able to accommodate me to an earlier time so we can make it to a comedy show. We got seated right away and was served two glass of champagne. Then we got the 3 courses menu for dinner. They cost $129 plus tax. Gramercy Tavern is a non-tipping restaurant. Hospitality Included. Every single thing that we got was cooked to perfection and zero complain. This place definitely earned their five stars. At the end, we got a coconut meringue cake with Happy Anniversary sign.

I arrived around 1:30pm on a Saturday afternoon was able to snag a seat at the bar within 10 minutes and there was a party just finishing up. I plopped myself down at the end of the bar a few minutes later and ordered the Gramercy Tavern Burger ($31) by chef Michael Anthony... Which might be the best burger I've ever had! It's made with simple ingredients without all the razzle - a beef burger topped with cheese and bacon - but it definitely dazzled my tastebuds. I could tell you about the light and airy bun that is freshly baked in house and made with Yukon Gold potatoes.Or I could talk about the generous layer of nutty molten Cabot Cheddar which is first emulsified in a skillet and then poured over the entire patty resulting in a cheese that holds together without being overly oily.Or I could even describe the strips of house cured bacon that are perfectly cut to the right thickness and then cured in a sugar and salt solution before being smoked and grilled so that it is crispy but still has a nice chew with just the right amount of fat.But what I really want to talk about is the smokey beef patty which is butchered and ground daily in-house. It is a lightly packed combination of top round (50%), brisket (25%), and short rib (25%) resulting an extremely sweet and beefy flavour while still having an incredibly moist, juicy and light texture. My first bite of the patty immediately released a burst of juices that began to spill out onto the plate. Jaw droppingly good.The burger also comes with crispy duck fat fried chips which are delicious on their own or if you want to up the flavours even more, you can dip them into the smoked onion aioli which have a nice kick of jalapeño.Apparently they only make a limited number a day (I've heard between 25-40) so try and get there early. $31 might seem expensive for a burger but I guarantee it is worth every bite.Oh! An added bonus... Gramercy Tavern is a NON-TIPPING restaurant! Hospitality is already included in the price! Love it! So European!"}, {"review_id": "dsYHKU9dRM4YQWbKzIoqDA", "user_id": "opPpHVIp8SKHMJg3_y5Lew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Came back again, and this time for dinner.

I had a birthday dinner here, and the entire experience was exceptional from start to finish.We came here a couple minutes after our reservation and waited for a bit at the bar while they got our table ready. The place was absolutely packed, with many patrons just waiting for their tables or eating at the bar. The restaurant is divided into a more casual 'tavern' near the bar, and a slightly more formal dining room. Both the spaces are really well done up, and the tavern is livelier though the dining room is more intimate. We were seated in the dining room, and our server was with us shortly. He was really polite, and had a bit of old-school formality about him. The dinner started off with a butternut squash puree amuse-bouche that was really tasty, and the softest bread rolls you'll ever taste which were paired with some delicious herbed butter. For appetizers we tried the smoked trout which was fresh and flavorful, and the ricotta cavatelli that had a hearty delicious beef bolognese. For mains, we did the lamb loin which was perfectly cooked and juicy, and the pork loin and belly - which was a pork dish done three ways, all of which were brilliant! For dessert we had the passion fruit tart which was fruity and sour, and the chocolate custard which was rich, smooth and tasty. I also got a complimentary coconut cake for my birthday, and some chocolate truffles and granola bars to take home at the end.This has to be one of the best, if not the best meal I've had in the city. A special occasion spot for sure, and well worth it."}, {"review_id": "FBuKxRmQaFk4oXNKn167zA", "user_id": "TVQO1ut1mpJ0CYYdef3sbw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Gramercy Tavern is known for their fresh and seasonal ingredients and tasting menu.

We were worried the restaurant would close but luckily they did not and as a bonus they had a \"sNOw\" corkage fee special so we ended up BYOing our wine. Of course, that didn't stop us from enjoying one of their excellent cocktails. I opted for the seasonal tasting menu while my sister had the vegetable tasting menu. Honestly, there was not one thing that we disliked about our food and it's hard to pick my favorite dish of the night. The tortiglioni pasta was everything a decadent winter pasta should be with earthy mushrooms, specks of bacon, and perfectly crafted fresh pasta. My duck was cooked to absolute perfection with a crispy, well-seasoned skin and delicious accompaniments. Perhaps the surprise favorite of the night for me was the smoked Arctic char. The Arctic char was lightly seared and covered in a horseradish cream. Every bite of the dish left me wanting more!We indulged in a cheese course before dessert which was a fun addition to the tasting menu. We went with a chef's choice selection of 3 and our waiter expertly described each of the cheeses, breads, and garnishes to us. He recommended starting by pairing the cheese with the matching garnish and then having fun with the combinations. We did exactly as instructed and devoured it all. Coincidentally, my dessert came with a cheddar cheese ice cream and guess what - I could still have eaten more cheese and more cheese ice cream. Back to our waiter, he and the rest of the staff were absolutely superb. Everyone was friendly, attentive, and seemed to genuinely care if we were enjoying ourselves. The dining room decor could probably use an upgrade as the tavern decor really outshines that of the dining room which reminded me a bit of a hotel restaurant."}, {"review_id": "LUJZ4RQbn5iBCGfjqWEz3A", "user_id": "SqVUNVeYJblyoUz4e-Fiqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "The service at Gramercy tavern is the best I've experienced. The staff is incredibly courteous and polite. We felt like royalty dining here. Everyone was attentive and made sure that we didn't need to lift a finger.For starters, we shared the beet salad. It was simple, earthy, and flavorful. It was topped with nuts and small pieces of popcorn to add a little crunch as well as lonza adding some savoriness. For the main course, my girlfriend and I each ordered a burger. It was made with very high quality beef leading to a juicy and flavorful burger. It was exactly how I'd like - just a bit short of medium rare. It was topped with cheese which appeared to be melted down with steam as well as bacon. It was an outstanding burger!For dessert, they served me a complimentary toasted coconut treat for my birthday. I also had a cup of chamomile with my dessert.

I've been here twice, once in the Dining Room and one in the Tavern and both experiences were amazing. Dining Room:Waitress came extremely frequently to check in on us and our water cups were frequently refilled. The waitress also provided excellent menu recommendations and all dishes had really nice flavor profiles and were presented beautifully. My favorite part of the meal was actually the dessert though I really love sweets (I got a raspberry themed dessert). At the end of the meal we also received truffles and a complimentary Gramercy Tavern granola type bar to take home.Tavern:Came on a Sunday to try their secret menu burger which did not disappoint. Didn't need to make a reservation although we came before 12pm. It is a huge burger and if not super hungry would suggest sharing it between two people so you can also try a few other things on the menu. Also got an cobbler/walnut/ice cream dessert which could have potentially been too sweet but the slight sour taste of the cobbler balanced it out nicely. They gave us complimentary bread which was also really fresh/tasty.I would recommend the dining room experience to anyone. It was one of the best experiences I've had. If I return I would probably just get dessert in the Tavern though since that was one of my favorite parts of the meal and many of the dining room dessert options are in the Tavern."}, {"review_id": "qtUtbIe61dg13l7nu2fmjw", "user_id": "ipufAX2UdjpkydKXT_lX5Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/4/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Reliable, classy, beautiful, quintessential NYC restaurant. I've been to the Dining Room twice and went to the Tavern side, and both sections are equally great. Dining Room is perfect for special occasions, the Tavern was perfect for a nice lunch date and an especially good burger.The Tavern doesn't take reservations so you can expect to wait, but luckily we went on New Years and only waited 10 min. We started with a roasted broccoli salad (5/5) which was crisp and charred and had a lot of terrific components. Then a few vegetable sides including a miso sweet potato (4/5) that I wish was a little more savory and more miso-y, and also roasted cauliflower (5/5) which hit all the right notes of salty, sweet, and sour. The primary goal of this trip was to get our hands on the burger, which apparently sells out around 3pm daily. It's apparently one of the best burgers in NYC. Well I can tell you with confidence after my year-long burger quest, that the Gramercy Tavern Burger (5/5) is one of the best, if not THE best burger. The meat is juicy, rich, yet balanced in a way that's not as beefy as Minetta Tavern; a blanket of sharp cheddar adds enough funk, and the bacon actually doesn't overwhelm. Apply special sauce if you want (I did for half of mine). The chips are super crunchy and good, but I still kind of missed my fries. Ended on a sweet note with Pear Cobbler (3/5) which was the only disappointing part of the meal. Oddly it was very bitter, the stewed pear itself was not sweet and the crumble on top was more of a whole wheat muffin top - going for a healthy dessert? The madeira ice cream was amazing though, and definitely boozy. It is a little pricey at first glance, but the prices include gratuity. And the service is still awesome. They check up on you as needed, refill your water seamlessly, and are kind and gracious. I loved the holiday vibes inside the beautiful space, and it is one of my most highly-recommended restaurants in NYC."}, {"review_id": "uMfEFYALsVzCjDnefQGC2A", "user_id": "AghKXr53xNvKjh_A5Ur1GQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Fantastic atmosphere and food.There are two portions to the restaurant - the area in the front, the 'tavern', does not accept reservations and it is here that you can order a-la-carte and smaller items.  The area in the back is only a prix-fixe or tasting menu which costs significantly more, but is well worth it.To begin with, the atmosphere is cozy and fancy at the same time.  The staff are so amiable and knowledgeable with each ingredient in the dish.  We tried the three course prix-fixe menu and each tried different items, and all were mind-blowingly well done.  As expected, the portions are slightly small, so you will likely not walk out holding your stomach up, but the portions are just right for me.  Do not overlook their seemingly simple options (ie.

If you've seen it you will FULLY understand my comments on the illustrious Gramercy Tavern. I experienced Gramercy Tavern way back when Tom Colicchio was at the helm, and many times after the hand off to the current chef Michael Anthony.  Gramercy Tavern was one of my favorite restaurants but tonight's experience left me puzzled. The service is still impeccable. We had a wonderful server and about five assistant servers who always kept our glasses filled, always asked if we needed anything, etc. The sommelier provided top notch wine suggestions. So why the 3 stars? The ambience, food and decor. It's been years since I last dined at Gramercy Tavern. Years ago it used to be chic, trendy and delicious. But tonight it was just plain tired.  I thought I was dining at a franchised hotel restaurant.  The food we ordered was fine but there was nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing refreshing about this meal.  It was so boring that only my dining companion prevented me from falling asleep while chewing. Instead of dessert we opted for the cheese course. That was a mistake. I didn't enjoy a single cheese or flavor pairing. How do you go wrong with cheese? Here's what I liked foodwise: the chef's amuse bouche was a cabbage broth with cheese foam -absolutely delicious, and the truffle chocolates they give you as a courtesy at the end of the meal are quite elegant. So, Gramercy Tavern, technically precise cooking and good service, but about as boring a menu as I've seen and a dining space that is so uninspiring I suppose I understand the menu now."}, {"review_id": "MkD1IQr2efT1gWwPrgludQ", "user_id": "kFtpOzWygqAENd6oKrkefw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/5/2017", "text": "Service was top-notch. Having decided a little too late for reservations in the dining room, Tavern seating was our only option. That also meant being on the wait list. We happily imbibed on a few too many glasses of wine in the waiting area and while doing so, the receptionist kept us posted on the timeline until our table was ready. He was friendly yet professional and made us feel like truly valued guests. He even freed our hands from our half-filled glasses as he walked us to our table when it was ready. Just impeccable.In the midst of all the action, the energy was riveting in the tavern compared to the fine dining section in the adjacent room. The menu was simple and short as opposed to having the Tasting Menu option on the formal side. We started strong on the apps with the rich and luscious Duck Liver Mousse ($22), beautifully Grilled Octopus ($22) with a crunchy finish from the pine nuts, and my favorite out of the three - Brown Butter Cavatelli ($19) with smoked mushrooms, pecorino, and squash. If your goal is to be satiated, this dish will get you there (also available as a main entree).I saw rice on the menu and I let the Asian in me get swayed to pick it as my main. Smoked Pork Fried Rice ($34) it is. Sadly, it was more appealing on paper. The Wagyu Meatloaf ($36) was not my cup of tea and I may have to blame the poblano sauce or the meat texture for that. On a brighter note, the Sea Bass ($35) was a knockout. The mixture of clams and chorizo added outstanding flavors to the fish that was impressively cooked. This plate was my ultimate high but if you prefer red meat, I'll let you in on a secret. Their Bacon Burger ($29) is an off-menu item which is going to blow any burger aficionados' mind away. Even those potato chips on the side were killer. Michelin awarded them with 1 star while I give them 4 solid Yelp stars. I may have to return and try the Tasting Menu for that last star."}, {"review_id": "SwQ1x1I8uTmTB3aEPgyI2w", "user_id": "9OofA8DV80h2ykCVQmb5cg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "We came here for a special occasion, and despite all the hype, we were unfortunately disappointed.
