BUT, after you visit Mudhouse, you'll think of a delicious, chocolate and espresso filled cup that gives wings to your day and a halo to your outlook.I love the Mudhouse. I've spent many days there studying and doing horrid group projects, but somehow under the glow of the coffee-house lighting, dairy-free latte in hand, those soul-sucking group projects don't seem so bad. It's a small storefront, parking can be a little tricky, but it's worth it to grab a seat and enjoy your beverage in an atmosphere that offers a calming ambiance. You'll be relaxed and jazzed at the same time, which is just about the most wonderful way to feel."}, {"review_id": "f_JGzzYy74Cw0Oy6oqiG5Q", "user_id": "pnTiEaqM4slogpY97n9Kvg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Many locals consider Mudhouse one of the most notable coffee shops in Springfield, and it collects the dollars of college students (or their parents' money) on the reg. I camped out there for several hours looking to hire someone and got caffeinated, got a bite, and finished some work.Things to know:*****I. LOCATION & PARKING: This institution resides on South Avenue aka the main artery of the city. Parking, though, is available all around. Finding it from the street, too, shouldn't be an issue.II. FOOD & DRINK: They offer fresh baked goods, soups, sandwiches, and roast their beans. They also create crazy espresso-concoctions. I tried the following: *Snickerdoodle Latte: Comes with vanilla and cinnamon, it's like ingesting a snickerdoodle cookie with your coffee. It was fun to try once, but I wouldn't do so again.* Espresso: Super strong and tasty. Not necessarily memorable, though.*Cold Brew: Smooth and not acidic. I would recommend this.**Peanut Butter Cookie: Yes. Give me all of the carbs.III. SERVICE: I didn't have any problems with their service. I found Mudhouse's staff to be polite, and I got my order without waiting too long.FYI, their wifi is a bit spotty. They need to upgrade their service to increase the bandwidth or something. IV. AMBIANCE & DECOR: It has the same aesthetic as the coffee shop from friends. It's granola-y, fun, and welcoming. V. PRICES: Affordable. Nothing outrageous here. I think you get your monies-worth. VI. OVERALL: If you're in Springfield for a couple of days, I think checking out Mudhouse at least once is a must."}, {"review_id": "AaodIwEHuM6GIlC_eiEe7g", "user_id": "VX3snb-jAwXcDIgpQ4-Nig", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Went for the first time today and had an Iced African Safari Tea. It was excellent. However, while paying for the tea my friend made a comment about chick-fil-a being closed because it was Sunday. The service worker (a petite young brunette woman) asked \"Do you go there on any other day?\" The woman continued to speak on her opinions of the company and had a terrible annoyed look on her face and her speech switched from a sweet tone to almost a preachy tone. To say the least it was annoying. Regardless of opinion of the company, it has a time and place. Other than that the place was wonderfully peaceful and filled with great products."}, {"review_id": "m65zlu_8mDjMwRY2MxtrtQ", "user_id": "2KfMecCRNpHKyW4uzGv44w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "They have above average drinks, but prices that are inflated. One thing that stands out for the non-coffee drinkers is the peanut butter and chocolate flavored iced shake. However, for the coffee drinker the drinks are equal to and similar in taste to other coffee shops downtown. The atmosphere is great for a quick meeting over casual issues, but tends to be a bit noisy. The esthetic is brick and grunge and well decorated."}, {"review_id": "UDiBTVbjH_zppvAUn_FldQ", "user_id": "mphvb6MRmPgnIT8pmU-x0w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/15/2017", "text": "Mudhouse is a chill, large cafe that attracts the likes of students and hipsters and those that are in between.Our friend invited us here to chill after dinner, and she had mentioned that they served alcoholic coffee drinks. Unfortunately, we had mixed up this spot with nearby \"Mudlounge\" so they were purely a coffee/tea shop with a smoothie on the side.I ordered myself a Chai Latte ($4) to nurse myself back to health after being in a vehicle for tons of hours. While I wanted a deliciously, fragrant chai beverage, I ended up getting a watered-down cinnamon spice latte that really didn't do much for me. I made the comparison to Starbucks and said I'd rather have their version! Definitely a pass for me.However, my friend's all enjoyed heir chocolate smoothies and coffee that they got from here. Listen to them and go for the pure caffeine or sugar, and not the in-between. You'll be better off at the Mudhouse that way."}, {"review_id": "sOl9ZUcpDBhCH2vyOXUeYw", "user_id": "o-JAM9xF3Y4qWAS_9gpePg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "This is absolutely the best coffee shop I've been to in Springfield. The people are very friendly and helpful and the prices are cheap. The sound is very peaceful and easy to work in. They have a lot of different tables to sit at to accommodate different sizes. I ordered an almond honey iced latte and it was incredible.

But this is an awful place to do any real work unless you want to be around a lot a lot of people not doing work. I don't think I have every seen a coffee shop or restaurant this busy in the town of Springfield. And people from all age ranges, but lots of college students b/c of State. It's also slightly dark inside with not a lot of natural lighting, but there are plenty of yellow lights. I think this is one of the oldest coffee shops downtown. It is less modern than the other ones around the block like European, Ethic, but it's cozy. It is clearly the most popular one. People are also super friendly."}, {"review_id": "Ynx1QYlBEkGsHm1iNFdjRA", "user_id": "OumpM0S3etq4rgMSAGnbGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/19/2017", "text": "Came to Mudhouse for coffee and some breakfast for the kids.

It's spacious enough for studiers to spread out with their laptops, tablets, books, have a group discussion or sit solo and enjoy a hot cup of Joe with your freshly prepared lunch. I opted for the 1/2 Veggie Love, no cream cheese of course & Mud Moka shake-like smoothie. The Veggie Love came loaded with fresh greens, mushroom, tomato, roasted red peppers, red onion and a light sun dried tomato dressing all stuffed inside a spinach wrap. My Mud Moka was a dark chocolatey conception of coffee, cinnamon, peanut butter, almond milk, banana and other tasty ingredients I can't recall. Just know it was heavenly. My dinning partner chose the 1/2 Cranberry Turkey sandwich 1/2 Greek Freak salad both of which he absolutely loved. The service was very friendly and hospitable, the café was nice, clean and well organized. They offer a plethora of bulk teas along with free wifi, calendars, great artwork, unique furniture pieces, pastries, cold brew filling station and more. Give it a whirl,~Christy"}, {"review_id": "Rzi2HmHmAo0r52XxS8AizA", "user_id": "4eGKlaOUc00gGzEcifl1PQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/10/2017", "text": "Only stopped by while driving through Springfield.

Their \"mudhouse\" coffee is a  blended iced coffee shake made with their cold brew and served up in a pint glass. And, boy, does it pack a punch! The regular coffee shop looks great as well, but I wanted to try something unique. The atmosphere is relaxed and with enough outlets to make it perfect for a few hours of studying. I can see how this place can become a great hangout spot in town!"}, {"review_id": "aItyjTEiBRzqdRCvEWZweA", "user_id": "gMVRGfXeOud4nJz00vcePQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2017", "text": "Nice place for coffee/tea/smoothies/pastries. They have a wide selection for you to choose, and the pricing is okay. The environment is nice, and the decor is intriguing. The lighting is kinda dim, but there is a lot of lamps. There's also a light decor above the restroom hallway that stood out to me. They have a wall of tea selections, and I tried the mango mate.
