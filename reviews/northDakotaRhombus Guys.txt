Rhombus Guys will offer that perception challenge. The good part of Rhombus Guys: ingredients - fresh, varied, and well coordinated on most pizzas.  Their mushrooms aren't your usual canned stems and cap pieces found on so many pies, this is apparent on their best pizza, the Wild Mushroom.  It's vegetarian, and you'll never know it. The sauce on the Thai Chix has a nice spice to it as well.  They have a wide range of saucing and topping mixes, some of which hit peak savory like the Wild Mushroom to the grease box killer T-Rex which somehow won some awards, but perhaps I'm just getting old and don't see the appeal of puddles of grease on a pizza. Lots of good beers, family friendly atmosphere.  The bland part are their sides, nothing too special and meh at best.  It is a pizza place after all.  Get the pizza.  Be happier. The ugly can only be the wait times.  Sometimes there are too many people crammed in waiting, but show up in the summer when the rooftop is open and seating is much more readily available. Great place to be with friends, good pizzas, and a couple of beverages.  I can't wait to try some of the other more ambitious pizza makes."}, {"review_id": "V6Y1Hv6ewAVrVc8dxH1a2A", "user_id": "bxdJSHB_5TQgVXyujl5h6g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Stopped in with my teenage son for supper last Friday night.  We arrived around 6:30 and only had to wait a few minutes for a table.  We always head back to the foosball table to kill time while we wait to be seated.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  We ordered a half T-Rex and half Thai Chicken large pizza.  The pizza itself was fine.  The Thai Chicken is my go-to and I've found lately that it seems a little on the dry side.  The tables are covered with disposable paper and they give you a fistful of crayons so you can doodle or whatever to pass the time while you wait for your meal.  With the pizza and 2 sodas our bill came to just under $35 pre-tip.  Overall this place has a good vibe.  There are a number of TVs situated around the place.  In addition to tables and booths there is seating at the bar.  If you have trouble finding a parking spot just park in the lot across the street by The Depot (after 5pm and weekends)."}, {"review_id": "wAmkNLaum1YPiiZS6ywwFg", "user_id": "marLCP7m8mKaMZTZm3Mi-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/27/2017", "text": "A favorite father daughter place to go, we like the specialty drinks and building our own pizza.

It's a great place for kids and to ditch the wireless devices for crayons and color on the tables! It's also got roof seating which sounds great; I've never made the upper deck, but sometime this summer we will. Service is typically great! Cleanliness is spot on! And the flavors will never let you down!!! We will return (we've been there over a dozen times) and would highly recommend anyone of any age check this great Za Joint out!"}, {"review_id": "u7e9XZSdtTKOFkKRMeUZbA", "user_id": "TOAJx-tD_q1JWtZ-eMe7oQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/14/2017", "text": "My husband and I come here off and on and we always enjoy our meal. Today I had the portobello grilled cheese on ciabatta bread with side salad, and my husband had boneless wings with kettle chips. Friendly, timely service. Tasty food, exactly as described on the menu. I love drawing on my table with crayons, who doesn't? (People who don't worry me a little)Only thing I could pick on, the menus weren't very clean. A bit used and abused. I don't like having to touch menus in most restaurants, but especially when I feel a slight stickiness. It gives me the creeps a bit, but that's probably something most people wouldn't care about."}, {"review_id": "H8tyt3Rpt0xvdEM1eRxG4g", "user_id": "CLLGsZIcC0wXJ0AV2buXAA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/5/2017", "text": "Visiting from San Francisco, I'd like to think I'm a tad bit of a food snob. Vegetarian, high maintenance & quick to decide wether or not I'll enjoy my meal just by the service... but, this restaurant pleasantly surprised me every step of the way! Great service!!! Vegetarian friendly pizza & one of the only places I've been too in North Dakota that serves veggie meat & that also serves my favorite whiskey! This place really helped cure my late night craving!!!

Brought my team of 30 in and allowed them to order their pizzas for each table. Waitstaff was incredibly through and so pleasant. My team loved the high quality food they were served in such a fun relaxed atmosphere. I loved that I could get vegan cheese for my co-coach's dairy allergy as well as my other allergy concern athletes were able to find multiple item menus that accommodated them. Food was really affordable for serving as many as I was. Appreciated their speed and awareness of what ingredients were in what products.If you're looking for dairy free, the thin crust and vegan cheese were both PHENOMENAL- even great cold the next day!"}, {"review_id": "WoV8nHiUh1c0AZxSD7m27w", "user_id": "12tbbYb_-T0tqJAcZrJleg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/8/2017", "text": "Heard it was the best pizza in Fargo.

They have a great beer menu as well. The rooftop patio is open in the warmer months and a fun differentiator for Fargo restaurants. I've never had outstanding service, but it's also never been terrible. The crust is tasty and the toppings and combo's that they have put together are outstanding. I would recommend the Chipotle Steak Supreme, The Rockefeller, Blue Heaven, The Farm, and as odd as it sounds, the Tater-Tot pizza is a fun twist on a Midwest classic."}, {"review_id": "dNYo7_0NKwarBy2_vSweyA", "user_id": "msyH4LoryNwlJiU3pTn35g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/16/2017", "text": "Went here for dinner with my girlfriend and roommate for dinner. Great food in a really chill atmosphere. The music was pretty good- they were playing some cover songs of popular music and it really just helped set the mood. Good brews there and good staff made the whole experience worth having by making sure we were happy. As a unique touch, the tables have paper on top that you can draw on with crayons or whatever and the decor makes you feel like you're a local.

It's a full bar too so we enjoyed some brewskies with our zaa.The breadsticks were lame tho and idk i think its like a North Dakota thing but the marinara they give you is like cold Ragu. This happened to us 3 times, at 3 different venues so we were seeing a not so bueno trend. Meh.  But the pizza man, the insane combos they make are pure genius! I love the innovation bc lets get real, you seriously can put anything on pizza and they really scored.Happy hour and late night specials running (i swear this state has the best happy hours i have seen in my life) and its big inside so I'm sure it gets poppin at night and on weekends.
