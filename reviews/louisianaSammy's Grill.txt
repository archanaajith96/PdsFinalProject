I can eat 10 lbs by myself (proven) SO I was surprised at how full I was after having the 4 lb crawfish special. It's a \"special\" because it comes with a piece of corn and 2 small potatoes lol. Woo We started off with the fried pickles.. Pass. Much too salty and needed more overall spice. I guess I've been spoiled with good pickles elsewhere because I find that I'm rarely satisfied with this appetizer dish at most restaurants. But the crawfish were FRESH, HOT, BIG and yummy.. I think BECAUSE it was freshly boiled though, it made the spiciness well.. extra spicy. My lips were on FIRE and I could barely talk at one point, because I was so choked up on spice. I really thought my lips were bleeding. They weren't; they were just red and humongous. However, it was still darn good? Our service was quick and friendly. However, at $5.25/lb of crawfish- I'd rather grab crawfish on the go from somewhere else for much less and enjoy it in the confinements of my own home."}, {"review_id": "jA8zTn7szu1wk44WQHVHvg", "user_id": "_fXxvfyE0errA8yPx_cIFg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "We started n the bar with friendly bartender who was very helpful.  We ordered fried pickles and beer.    Our wait for table for dinner seemed short because we were having such a good time !   The atmosphere was festive and fun.  We ordered boiled crawfish with potatoes and corn.  It lived up to its billing.   Wow it was so tasty.  My hat is off to the cook staff.    Brandon the manager is doing a great job.  We plan to come back every week during crayfish season.  The waitresses and bus staff were spot on and made our meal perfect.  Little touches make a meal experience.  Even though they were slammed with business, all staff took time to make us feel important.   My money will come back and back."}, {"review_id": "S2SjjlVhNLr37LgHYFgnsQ", "user_id": "hmNSAnVNUmJi8gVCjzTZrg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Poorest service experience in my 40 years.We had called ahead to check if they could accommodate a party of seven. They said yes, but when we arrived, we waited ten minutes for a table. The person who called ahead expressed some disappointment with this and probably annoyed someone because the rest of the stay was crazy bad. We sat and were provided menus. We waited some time before our waitress, Janice came and took our drink and appetizer order. The two gentlemen ordered a beer a piece and one woman ordered a mixed drink. Somehow, the ladies' drinks came fairly quickly as did the appetizers we ordered, but the first beer took about ten minutes time and I inquired about my beer and received a blank look. So I again ordered my beer and she left to get it. About five minutes later she returned to tell me they didn't have that beer. So I ordered the same beer served to the other gentlemen. That beer arrived after another fifteen minutes of waiting. We received our salads after we let our server know we needed to get to an event. This was about 40 minutes after we had arrived and about 25 minutes after we had ordered food. So we think the order had never been placed until we complained of needing to leave at a certain time. There's usually not a lot of salad prep time. So we eat our salads, which were quite nice. I especially liked the house dressing!We waited for our next course, which was a typical entree order. That course came about 50 minutes after we sat down. The first mistake was the other gentlemen had ordered a chicken-fried steak and he received a chopped steak with onions. Yes, not the worst error, but I didn't get my entree at all. So naturally I ask her about it, even mentioning what I ordered, an Acadian catfish. She says she'll rush it. Ten minutes later, another waitress arrives with a crawfish po-boy. I thought this was a mistake, so I sent it back also mentioning I ordered the catfish. So naturally, I get a catfish po-boy five minutes later. Again, I had ordered the Acadian catfish, but damn I was just ready to eat any kind of food. At this point, the rest of my party is getting up to leave and I'm just going to Uber to catch up with them later. Instead I scarf down the catfish out of my po-boy and leave with them. Our server did offer to buy us dessert as apology, but again, we were in a rush.We are continuing to laugh today about just how bad this experience is and frankly unsure if it was malice or amazingly inventive incompetence. I tipped Janice decently because she was somewhat apologetic, but never during this entire time were we engaged by management, so perhaps that lends us to conclude we had pissed off the employees and were receiving our due Justice."}, {"review_id": "v3hmL1l644I04C5gQJyWAA", "user_id": "xclE2za5Dp6E5V0IjXpK1Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "My daughter goes to LSU and took my wife and I to this awesome Louisiana restaurant.

We got there right when it opened and I am glad we did because it got busy and filled up quick (the reviews don't lie) it is a great place to eat and drink!

Came in on cinco de drinko and was immediately greeted by our server Gabby. She was friendly and gave some great recommendations. I had 2 beers which were both ice cold and my girlfriend had a margarita. The margarita was not too sweet and strong enough to feel like you're getting your money's worth. Food was delicious. Had the gumbo and cheese fries along with the sautéed shrimp. There was a mixup up on my order (which happens) so the manager on duty, came to our table, and personally apologized. He went above and beyond, even offering a free appetizer for the mixup.

The buffalo shrimp appetizer came with 9 fried shrimp. I really enjoyed that the sauce had a bigger kick than I expected. The special that day was the gumbalaya - a big bowl of gumbo with a heaping portion on jambalaya in the middle. It was such a hearty dish, packed with chicken and sausage. I especially enjoyed the spice in the jambalaya - that was my favorite part. The shrimp etouffee was creamy and savory without tasting too shrimpy. I would definitely recommend this dish, which is only available on Thursdays. The main dishes come with a side salad - I really enjoyed the house dressing, which is a parmesan vinaigrette. Note that the crawfish boil is only available when it's in season, so call ahead if you're set on ordering it!"}, {"review_id": "292PmCRfMMWvRGmlBjrL_Q", "user_id": "zg8vFTyYeTG6dyO180JyWQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Can't go wrong with sammys.

My coworker has been raving about this place for months, so when the Kansas City Southern Christmas Train rolled into town, we decided to give it a try.  The restaurant is huge, with three separate dining rooms and a nice sized bar.  There are plenty of picnic bench styled seats as well as tables that can accommodate large groups.   Lots of wood paneling and bare concrete floors make for a very utilitarian / country feel.My wife wasn't too hungry and ordered a dinner salad and a cup of crab bisque.  The bisque was good.  Not spectacular, but not bad either.  My son got the kid's fried catfish plate with fries and a side order of green beans.  The fish was coated in a coarse corn meal breading but was fried very well.  Nothing unique about the fries as they seemed like your garden variety fries.  The green beans were doctored up with bacon and had a good smokey flavor; albeit a little salty for my liking.  I ordered the grilled tuna off the lite menu and got a double order of steamed yellow squash and broccoli.  The tuna was actually cooked perfectly, as I opted for medium as compared to my usual medium-rare preference.  I'm guessing that it was a 6 ounce serving and it was seasoned nicely.  I would probably had preferred the blackened tuna, but I was still happy with my choice.  The vegetables were good but I was not expecting the dusting of Parmesan cheese on top.  I love cheese, but this should be stated on the menu for those who do not like cheese.Our server (Carly) was pretty attentive and did a good job, even though she was a little busy.  I'm surprised she had so many tables as I counted no less than 10 servers, most of whom did not seem as busy as Carly.  I don't quite agree with my co-worker's raving rave reviews, but overall it was a pretty good experience and definitely A-Ok."}, {"review_id": "Mn11yVje-SDb4SSe6p8ClQ", "user_id": "8yDKD0PJ5GFlXONNSzNp0Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "This review is solely for the crawfish!

And I know what you're thinking- but Austin- in the end of the movie Freddie Prinze Jr.  turns out to be a good guy. Well I guess that's true but the emotional turmoil he put Rachel Leigh Cook through far outweighed his feeble attempts to turn in to Mr. Right.  So about Sammie's. Food was just mediocre people. Fried oysters were hammered (chicken fried style, so the oyster died inside the thick coating). *Fried green tomatoes were ok but the crab sauce was too thick and over salted. *Lasagna was again oversalted and basically just a brick of cheese and random ground beef. *Catfish with crawfish etoufee was ok but the catfish was of the funky variety and the rice was hard. *The seafood gratin was served cold and then brought back barely warm and totally congealed. Again oversalted. Just no.  Will unfortunately not be returning. Seems like lack of oversight and passion in the kitchen. If Sammie's is a local institution it seems they are coasting on their reputation. But reputations cease to exist if you can't impress new faces.
