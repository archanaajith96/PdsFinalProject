I try to be nice to my baristas unless the espresso is truly abominable and the spot should know better. Well,  wasn't expecting much when I went to a hotel coffee bar (even though I probably should have known better) but had my socks totally blown off by my first shot of espresso from Topeca Coffee. Nearly four years later, and Topeca has never disappointed. Their drinks have always been well textured, perfect temperature, and consistently delicious -- WITHOUT SUGAR ;-) Who ever manages this spot deserves serious kudos because the staff is always on point. This shop may even be a good reason to stay a night at the Mayo Hotel. Keep up the good work."}, {"review_id": "QKggtEDS2YfLQN3gkYr21g", "user_id": "QRLXp8_z-xd1ZveBStPFlg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "it was the middle of day & i was heading to a meeting & needed a pick-me-up. as i was going towards the original location, i was directed to the new location which used to be the gelato place. i got the americano & it was good, definitely woke me up.it was rich in flavor. what i like to do is stay away from sugar & cream as much as possible, so i splash some cinnamon & honey in the mix. the workers were friendly, the coffee didn't take long at all. with the location they're at now, it's not built to hangout at like some other coffee shops downtown. i do like the bar they have & how the place is themed, very calming."}, {"review_id": "kkTKP8l4LtddTSNY4-VpKg", "user_id": "JmXkhLYjoZySSezU5oREMQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "Wonderful staff with great attitudes.

It's not that this new location is bad or hard to get to but they lost over half their menu- no more hot food, salads, sweet treats, etc. On top of that, they downsized tremendously. Their old shop could easily hold a large abundance of people where as now it's cramped and crowded with limited seating and no lounge. To top it off, not only does the whole small store smell like body odor but the man behind the counter who took my order came off as unprofessional and out-of-it, almost like a pothead. I'm very sad to see my favorite café of four years take such a poor turn but I'll be looking elsewhere for my morning coffee and afternoon lunch from now on."}, {"review_id": "aKsJrrv77Ar8Z4fuy9jWTA", "user_id": "2QvvEgSODd6nMcN73GcBUQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/24/2017", "text": "One of the best coffee shops I have ever been to regardless of city or country. I am a huge fan of just how meticulous they are about their coffee preparation. Thy have beans from all around the world and they are serious about answering questions pesky customers might have about their origin. In general I find the info interesting but not necessarily a difference maker for me. That comes from the taste and just how awesome every drink my friends and I have had here. The espresso is special, the chai latte's are fantastic, and regular lattes are what a couple of my friends rave about. Go ahead, try a dirty chai...seriously, stop reading this review, walk over to this coffee house and roaster, order a quiche with a dirty chai as well as a double shot on the side, sit in the corner on the little cozy couch and relax for a moment. Let the taste grip you and the relaxing background music help you sink deeper into that little grey love seat.Thank you Topeca for setting the bar so high!"}, {"review_id": "Lu71EvIO3JvjoFgHW7VVyw", "user_id": "eP9qKqRLQznbaNMSRq3Q0g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/25/2017", "text": "Ordered cinnamon roll, Warmed it up for me ,they Didn't add frosting to it, ordered cup of fresh fruit that was pretty good and fresh.  Damn good cinnamon roll, so soft and flaky!!

This places picks up a decent amount of pre-work hours breakfast business so it gets surprisingly busy for a town like Tulsa. Lots of suits here.I had a really good latte. Rich, creamy, bold flavor. Very good. The \"Sandwich Number 2\" was quite large and more than enough for breakfast with an egg patty, melted cheese and a tomato slice on a grilled sandwich bread. Very delicious!Nice vibe in this spot and great for a little time of Yelping before heading into the office."}, {"review_id": "hsPtCPYZBis5xv9ENl9IrA", "user_id": "3wHQIS54oCzxBacnvw4L0Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "My mother grew up in Kaffa Provence in Ethiopia, due to this, I grew up around great coffee, and at this point I am one of those obnoxious \"Coffee snob\" hipsters. Topeca is by far my favorite coffee shop I have ever been to. The environment is warm and welcoming and a great place to get business done. The shop is in an old hotel and the room is lined by well done photographs. The floor is inlayed with Batchelder tiles which to any arts connoisseur is very exciting. The coffee is expertly crafted, beautiful, and of the highest quality. I would expect coffee this good to be served in one of those pretentious, irritating, shops that delight in making you feel uneducated and of poor taste, but no, the service is wonderful and down to earth. I dearly wish Topeca had a larger presence across the country, but for me, it is one of the main reasons I get excited about coming to Tulsa."}, {"review_id": "fRQWTvoMSMMbt_hjaeYsEw", "user_id": "qCu_bt6LmIUex2YnjPgTvA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/13/2017", "text": "Stopped in on a beautiful summer night for a cold brew, I had them add some vanilla bean syrup (made in Arkansas) and it was a perfect combo!

Topéca may not have a direct business relationship with the Mayo hotel, but they're certainly joined by a doorway, and that was enough for me to anticipate Good, but not Great. I lower my expectations whenever I order anything from a hotel, actually. Every aspect of my experience here, from the latte to the herbal tea to the yogurt and fruit cup to the naughty by nature cinnamon roll was fantastic, especially with the soundtrack that morning: a virtual flash flood struck Tulsa, it was a wild ride to watch, comfortably tap tap tapping my laptop (free wi-fi).I heard the beans were sourced from one estate and the café was family-owned; I got that impression from the service, as well, so friendly. My cup was honestly rewarding, complex and delicate. Again, the cinnamon roll was sort of inter-planetary, there was way too much icing on that mother (I ate it all up) and the best part was the roll itself, which was very dense, something more likely to come from a European bakery than Duncan Donuts. The Mayo is connected to a gem. Let's hope it keeps shimmering."}, {"review_id": "ba85K8q1hWEvpA5V8NbgUQ", "user_id": "sg2jn5beCaAaXJsgtWEoeQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2017", "text": "BF and I were aimlessly walking around downtown when we stumbled across Topeca. From the outside it looked closed, to our relief to it was open. Stepping in we were greeted with a relaxed hipster environment. The baristas are very friendly and proud of the cafe they work in; they are informative and are happy to share what their cafe is and stands for.Now for the coffee. BF ordered a cold brew and I half coffee, the other half steamed half-and-half, with a shot of sugarfree caramel and hazelnut. After taking a sip of his cold brew, the BF sighed a heavenly sigh and was content. After trying mine, both of our heads blew. Could this really be sugarfree? How can something this smooth and delicious be sugarfree?! Sure enough it is, main sugar substitute is erythritol with sucralose towards the bottom of the ingredient list (Monin syrups). If you want to try these deliciously smooth sugarfree syrups, do it fast as Topeca will stop carrying sugarfree syrups made with artificial sugar. They will be getting natural sugarfree syrups after it is developed by their syrup distributer, Pink House Alchemy."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/topeca-coffee-tulsa-6?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
