It really is. I spent a week in Italy this summer but Gratzies has the best Italian food I have ever eaten. Only bad thing I can say is I live four hours away, so won't get to become a regular. If your looking for great food, reasonable prices, attentive staff and lovely decor, then head here. You won't regret it."}, {"review_id": "OkQiNZFP74DNtw7R6LGfWg", "user_id": "RuHyMHjwkKQMzGC9HBlE0w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "We heard that Grazies had new owners and we were excited to check out how it's changed since I stopped working there in 2002. The Good Her meal was the Tour of Italy ($17) offering a bit of Chix Parm, Manicotti, and a couple of pieces of Ravioli in a rose sauce. Much better than the di Mare, there seemed to be no major issues except - rather than a discreet amount of sauce appropriate to the plating, the components needed to be fished out of too much sauce.  But the flavor was good and there were extra rolls to clean it up. One high point was the salad and soup that came with the entrees.  Her Caesar was well dressed with homemade croutons and nearly a meal in and of itself.  My Basil Tomato was the best part of my meal, and the \"cup\" was probably a 12oz bowl making it quite the first course. Service was attentive.  Wine list offered solid choices of both glasses and bottles with reasonable prices beginning at $8 a glass. The Bad My meal (di Mare) was good, though severely overcooked.  The clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, and calamari were well over done, rubbery, and lacking in flavor (probably having been all cooked out).  Judging by the temperature at which it came to the table, the dish was forgotten on the stove for far too long.  Oddly enough, the pasta was a solid al dente. I'd asked for a little heat, and was surprised that came in the form of large slices of jalapeño rather than the customary chili flakes. I imagine if the seafood had been better cooked, I'd not have minded the $22.  The UglyThe decor is largely the same as it was 20 years ago, very few details have changed except an extended wall removing the open kitchen concept. The neon signs that have been offering takeout and pointing to the entrance feel even more dated than they did in 2002.  Same with the menu, staples of Italian food with very few innovative dishes making the menu dated, which wouldn't be that bad if they executed everything perfectly. The VerdictOne dish isn't enough to make me not return and try something with a little more heat tolerance.  Perhaps a full serving of Chix Parm.  We'll return, but with a more critical eye in making our selections."}, {"review_id": "o4yS0xUjoDF2z4YOpOUNSA", "user_id": "iDx1NCLBORSjnyXAwq3B2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/25/2017", "text": "I love it when you stumble upon a restaurant and it turns out to be an absolute gem!I have been on the hunt for a great Italian restaurant in the Fargo area and my search has finally ended.  I went a bit late and grabbed a seat at the bar on a relatively quiet night.  I was able to meet the owner George (a great guy) and he gave me a background on the restaurant that he opened about 10 weeks ago.I ordered the Chicken Parm and it was delicious.  The chicken was done perfectly and had a nice crispy texture to it.  The sauce and noodles were also outstanding.  The entree was huge and also came with a very large side salad.  They have a great menu with all of the classics and quite a few other entrees with their own twist. They also have a bunch of appetizers that I can't wait to try.  The wine list is smart and very reasonable.I'm so glad I did a Yelp search and this wonderful restaurant popped up.

They have a very nice selection of Italian meals and appetizers. We did not have any appetizers or desserts so I can't speak to those but our entrees were very good. The food came out very quickly. I had the Seafood Scampi which was loaded with shrimp, scallops, mussels, baby clams and calamari. The seafood was cooked perfectly in the pasta - no rubbery calamari. My wife had the Lobster Ravioli which was also very good. The portions were large so you won't go away hungry.

I found 3 or 4 different spots ... and they were all different? I called to inquire and was told to use graziesitalianfargo.com.  There were no prices listed on their menu.  When I went to pick up my food I grabbed a paper menu to keep at home for future reference.  After I got home I noticed the prices on the receipt were all more expensive than what was listed in the menu??  If I were to base this review solely on the food I would give it 5 stars.
