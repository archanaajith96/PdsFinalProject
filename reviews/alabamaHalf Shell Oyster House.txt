They were really good and each one had such a unique and different taste!  My personal favorite were the Oysters Orleans. For dinner I had the seafood pasta and let me just say, they do not shy on the seafood!  Their was a mountain of lump grab on top and the pasta was filled with shrimp and crawfish, great dish for any seafood/pasta lover!"}, {"review_id": "idUv-oQ5fZlY4Qg7wPfQWg", "user_id": "BfhoJpV1SLropJOYUFjTXw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "Great atmosphere and easy to get to right off 65.

I think you could order a dozen, and just have that as your meal. Honestly, all the oysters in the menu looked really good.We shared entrees, Stuffed Portobella and the Seafood Pasta, they were good, but nothing out of extraordinary. Opposite to the oysters, you could tell this were chain dishes.I have to admit that the Sweet Potato Brulee was good, but save it for a desert! It was way too sweet.Service was good and fast. The parking lot can get very crowded, but there is plenty of space.I will def keep this one on my list to stop by when in Mobile. I need more oysters."}, {"review_id": "CzNVgaqaew9Due353-wZRA", "user_id": "QJA3DkATP6WVrWjVLIkhCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "The food is great guys, like dig in bring it until I pass out good!

I went here during a week night and the place was jam packed. That's a good sign that I was in the right place. I couldn't find a seat, so I ended up grabbing a seat at the bar.The bar can be a little crowded, but I made sure to create enough room to enjoy my oysters. They had a lot of items on the menu that I'd like to try, but the mission on this day was char-broiled oysters. Not only did they have your normal char-broiled oysters, they had a freakin variety pack of oysters! I chose the oysters sampler and I couldn't have made a better decision. It came with three Charbroiled Oysters, three Oysters Bienville, three Oysters Rockefeller and three Oysters Orleans. I tried to pick a favorite, but all of them were amazing. If you sit at the bar, you get to see them get shucked and broiled right in front of you.The atmosphere was nice and the oysters were top notch. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for some good oysters."}, {"review_id": "_MJHt5kaLie45MmhUDKp6g", "user_id": "V-if_1WfDIm04FAUoXpfWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Can't day enough about how we.enjoyed our dinner here.  My wife had the shrimp tacos and I had the nacon pecan crusted redfish.
