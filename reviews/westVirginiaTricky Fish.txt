I was skeptical about any place with a fish theme in WV, but this place is honestly perfection. Dive into this dive bar because life is better under the sea. Ok, jokes aside, Tricky Fish has a lot to offer in a small location. They have Cajun food staples like blackened chicken and catfish, but also offer healthier options too. We had a picky eater in our party and they loved it, so it must be good. I had the chicken tacos grilled, which is only an option if you ask, but I couldn't imagine a more perfect taco. The Cajun seasoning was strong, but not overpowering and the beans and rice were amazing. The rice was aromatic and it made my bean-hating tastebuds reconsider.  It's a dicey place for sure, but that fits the fish theme. It feels very local and loved by the community. If you can stop by, I'd recommend a little of everything."}, {"review_id": "vr5LU58vKNuARkPRWSMR7Q", "user_id": "XNBvYEhqboT5z_i_0pN4cQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I'm going to start this review with the food. After all that's what most people want to know. My wife had the cheeseburger and fries and I had the fried catfish tacos with fries.  We also had a side of hush puppies.  The hush puppies was awful. They are way too dense and greasy.  My fish tacos and my wife's cheese burger was actually good. Nothing special but average. The shoestring fries were greasy and not very good.  They were out of the waffle fries.  As far as food is concerned I would rate this place average with 2.5 - 3 starts. However, my rating of 2 stars is being generous simply because the place is a dump. I can't remember when I've eaten in a place so filthy. This was a Sunday afternoon and not very busy at all.  It looked like the floors hadn't been cleaned in weeks. The tables were in need of repair and cleaning.  The walls looked like some bar bathroom that had posters ripped off. There are scuff marks all over the walls as well with  trim and molding pieces missing.  It made me wonder if the owner of this place doesn't care how the dining area looks, what does the kitchen look like? How well does the staff take appropriate measures for cleanliness in preparing my food? This place has potential. It needs a complete remodel inside with some daily cleaning measures put in place.  Until then, I will not return. You be the judge. Let the pictures speak for themselves."}, {"review_id": "YI-GQ3LFD3D1GyDHAiJCPA", "user_id": "X4u8wI5u5c0sUjplJ9Ahlg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "More like 3.5. Went here while on a road trip. I ordered two tacos one fried catfish and one blacked with a side of beans and rice. My friend got the blackened shrimp. The fish was great. I particularly liked the fried catfish. Super crispy and tasty. The blacken catfish was good too. Great flavor. The rest of the taco wasn't very very spectacular. Iceberg lettuce, mediocre salsa and Mission flour tortillas. The rice and beans weren't bad. The shrimp was ok. The girl who took order was friendly and the interior was nice. I also liked that they had beer. It was a decent meal.  Living in LA, my bar for tacos is really high so I'm probably over critical. This place is fine, it just didn't blow me away."}, {"review_id": "TFZZj06toNTCY7VjsA6jsQ", "user_id": "SrNqHCVsIkWH7xmX-UsMVw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "I passed this place on the way to my hotel after several hours of traveling. Realizing it was already 2 in the afternoon and I hadn't eaten I figured why not. I tend to like offbeat places like this. It's a hole in the wall. The walls look like hundreds of posters were pulled from the wall and the tape caught every time. But then I don't go to places like this for decor. The service was very friendly. Not tons of options on the menu but they all sounded good and prices weren't bad. I ordered the cheeseburger and waffle fries and sat to wait. And wait I did. There were 6 people at tables. Half already had food.  Still it took over 30 minutes to get my food. The burger was decent but very well done. Very. If you're not in a hurry and not looking for 5 star you could do worse. Probably wouldn't be my first choice next time I'm in town"}, {"review_id": "1LFrPvGAFNcsztNlsKZXeQ", "user_id": "RI6WVPuxKTTN7AgPVX_CJA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "I should have known better to eat here when we walked in but it had decent reviews so we decided to give it a try.

This is the first time in 20 years that my husband did not eat his food. Catfish had fatty taste to it. Tasted like the cheapest catfish you can buy. Table was dirty.

First, the establishment is run down to such a degree that it has surpassed charming/quaint and is bordering on the treacherous! Siding falling off, wood rot, etc. Not a cute look.Far worse than the atmosphere was the serious lack of seasoning in the food. I opted for the blackened Mahi-Maui tacos with beans and rice. In my first bite and only bite of the rice, I determined it was bland, with slight off/rotten flavor that I wasn't a fan of. The tacos contained a tiny chunk of fish that was severely under seasoned. Tried the husbands onion rings and was sorely disappointed with them as well. Super thick coating and no seasoning. A common theme here! The only bright note was the husband's Mahi-Mahi sandwich, which was a nice size and fairly tasty! The hush puppies were nice too and I appreciated the hint of clove.Overall, expected better and was sorely disappointed"}, {"review_id": "A69AcjxpsOIthzvl-4MZ_w", "user_id": "c11jPPppfVH-Ytsq1pc9bw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "We were passing through and I wanted something good and unique to eat. Came upon The Tricky Fish on a Google maps search and the menu looked great! Decided on the lobster roll because... Well. Lobster roll!!! Trying to find a place that makes this is next to impossible outside of more Northeastern States. I called it in to go and my husband ran in to pick it up. Parking is tough and the surrounding location looked sketch but with all things considered it was worth it. Only concern was that it was a small sandwich, would like to have felt like I got my money's worth on that end. The lobster roll was delicious and had a lot of great flavor. The homemade waffle fries were out of this world! I would come here just for the fries. If passing through again, I would stop here - probably during the day so as to avoid the creepy nighttime ambiance of the area though!"}, {"review_id": "VrcIMje_X3cVhz0HWj7tEQ", "user_id": "F9J_S0gzh6_0D0dZ9rhsFA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/15/2017", "text": "My boyfriend and I stopped at the Tricky Fish after a recommendation from a friend as we were passing through the area. Easily accessible from the interstate, casual atmosphere, and great food! You can sit outside on a beautiful day and enjoy the sun while you eat. Pro: The Mahi Mahi tacos with jerk seasoning were amazing. Light, fresh, and bold flavor. Con: The Mahi Mahi burrito was filling, but lacked substantial flavor in comparison to the fresh tacos.

Ordered a fish sandwiches and salad.  While waiting I saw many frustrated customers...and I over hear how their truck didn't come that morning and thus why they were out of so many things. Then, there was only 1 guy in the kitchen...she should have been up front about that...so after waiting quite a bit I ask how much longer and she once again says I don't know. Then checks and comes out with bag of food. I take it back to my hotel and I have no sandwich...just a piece of over cooked fish in a box and a warm side salad.

The Tricky Fish atmosphere is unique and local.  You sort of get that beachy vibe despite being in downtown Charleston.  I love eating outside on the porch!  The staff is super friendly and nice.  And they are very aware of the ingredients and quality of their food."}, {"review_id": "NPACOuZ_J_LAQHWmKf0yxQ", "user_id": "PAoQzxVe5x4hDmsoYoYJMg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/2/2017", "text": "I was probably over dressed at this place because I had on shoes ... but it's comfortable and the staff is nice.

I was going going to one of my usual stops on my trip through Charleston. But they were closed for repairs or something. I was introduced to this place by my client. So I pull out my phone and voila right across the street is Tricky Fish, so I gotta give it a try and I was completely thrilled I did. First take your time with the menu, it may not look extensive, but it has a lot of options. I ended up getting the Po' Boy crab cake, without the bun, (it says that on menu read the menu!!) upgraded the side to a salad, then saw red beans and rice, asked if I could do both and my Gal asked which I wanted bigger, I said the salad and boom I had a great filling meal. The crab cake was fantastic, red beans and rice very good, and salad was basic but what I wanted. I am looking forward to my trip back to town to try other items!!"}, {"review_id": "cR6QjN62RhXggwvKlHwFlA", "user_id": "OjigEMKvHgoxoPK5VyR40A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2017", "text": "My niece, her 3 children and I had lunch here. She and I had been her before and loved it. The food is really good and the portions are great! We got the hush puppies for all of us to share and they are the best we had ever tasted. Don't know what their secret is, but there is a hint of sweetness. All entrees we had were wonderful. The waffles fries were done to perfection. Slaw..pretty good. The chips they make are crunchy, not too salty or greasy. The only down side... Them seem a bit under staffed and our wait for lunch was rather lengthy. There is a place outside to eat and we really wanted to do that, but no tables open as the deck area isn't very large. If you are expecting a place with ambiance.. This isn't it. But it is well worth the wait and not getting to eat outside. The food is wonderful!

I still eat fish so normally the blackened fish taco is my go to, but a few weeks ago I tried the special, a chickpea taco. I was skeptical so I had one fish and one chickpea. I would love to have about 3 of those chickpea tacos right now. The flavor was awesome! The chickpeas were grilled or roasted? and seasoned to perfection. My most recent trip I tried to pressure them to make it a regular menu item. Since they didn't have it, their veggie burger was suggested. I've sworn them off a long time ago, always dry, no flavor.
