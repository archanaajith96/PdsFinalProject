Upon entering I was pleased to see that the place was bright, well lit and we were greeted at the door. After ordering our four entrées of catfish, 2 blackened whiting and grits and a chicken salad we received our drinks of ginger lemonade which was good. We were looking forward to our meals until about 30 minutes later nothing had arrived. We began to get worried because the flight time was approaching. I asked our waiter about our order and she said our order was on the way. We received 2 out of 4 orders and continued to wait. We began to run out of time and patience so we asked for the remaining orders to go. To my annoyance, only one order came out so I grabbed it and left because they were now late for their flight. We decided to come back after we went to the airport for our refund. Vonda's did redeem themselves when we came back. They apologized profusely for the wait and gave us the refund plus the chicken salad and a free dessert. Despite, the really really long wait times, the food was good and the customers received was as expected from a nice establishment."}, {"review_id": "5-k1qTEpw5DSI24463uCWg", "user_id": "vjtpb0Bl_fZjz5MOHL6IOw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/24/2017", "text": "Came here yesterday for lunch and it was an ok experience. Found parking right out front which is always a plus.For food I had the fried catfish, baked Mac and cheese and yams. My friend had Mac and cheese rice and beans and fried catfish. Now at any southern restaurant the Mac and cheese and greens always have to be on point! The Mac and cheese here wasn't doing it for me at all. It was dry not as cheesy as I would have liked either.. my friend also didn't like it. She didn't like her rice and beans either. The catfish was good and the yams were the highlight of the meal. The cornbread was just ok. We ordered strawberry lemonades and they were terrible. Completely sour didn't taste like lemonade at all. We were going to send them back but we were in a bit of a rush and just dealt with it.Our waitress was just ok nothing was special about the interaction. She seemed more interested in talking to the other workers. Vonda made an appearance she was sweet. Very friendly and checked in on all the tables. Cool experience nice crowd of people . The prices were great but I'll honestly probably won't return.*update* just bit into the cornbread I took home and there was a piece of egg shell in it........ ......"}, {"review_id": "t9V4WR1AicAI-3yk3BFDsA", "user_id": "CYg1_7cFPwAfjI3JxM953A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "As usual I'm always happy when I leave here.

Saturday 3/3/2018. I had this establishment bookmarked for over a year, and finally decided to go solo. Pretty crowded, which was a good sign. Looks like regular locals frequent Vondas. I decided to go with the salmon cakes panini. I ordered it with the collard/cabbage mix. It also came with salad greens and a spicy mayo sauce. Needless to say the food was fresh and delicious. I usually taste and pick up the salt and pepper, but I didn't need either. Vondas boast a healthy soul food menu, and the food was not filled with grease. I didn't feel sluggish and weighed down. I would definitely go back to try other items on the menu. Street parking only. It may get tough to find parking during peak times. I don't give 5 stars on a 1st visit, but they deserve it. I would recommend Vondas."}, {"review_id": "yHzK-OIM_LTHkUmgOFoW9Q", "user_id": "aIAOG1Gbo76pQT0KwDjNug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2017", "text": "Wow!! Delicious.

I'm from the country so I'm very familiar with home cooked meals. This place lived up to the Yelp reviews. My husband and I were very impressed with the food--great portions and taste. Wow! I wish I lived closer. I'm 3 hours away but I will visit again in the near future. Friendly service!  Their tea and strawberry-lemonade was good and sweet--just like I love it!!  I had the fried whiting--Mac n cheese--sautéed spinach. Hubby had fried catfish--grits/cheese--fried potatoes--eggs/cheese. Cornbread was ok. They serve breakfast all day. We took an order of oxtails/rice/gravy--potato salad--candied yams for dinner later. I have no doubt it will be good too!"}, {"review_id": "qwpNvBoQqXY7km03krepUw", "user_id": "bniif7m36wCoOEEzbDVJzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/1/2017", "text": "Vonda's doesn't have a parking lot but there is ample street parking. It's across from a school and down the street from JFK pool. The place is casual dress you are greeted when you walk in by the staff. We proceeded to take seat as we were told to sit wherever we like. The minute we sat our server came right saying we serve breakfast all day handed us our menu an ask for our drink order. The look of the place is nice and casual reminded me of an old style cafe with a modern look. Two TVS playing College Football good music playing in the background. You feel like you are home so you are extremely comfortable. I ordered Blackened Catfish, Mac n Cheese with Garlic Green Beans. Chicken, Mac n Cheese with biscuits is what my wife ordered I got café wife strawberry lemonade. While waiting for our food two thick slices of cornbread were delivered to our table. The cornbread nice and hot served with whipped butter knife and fork. The lemonade looked so good I had to order one myself it was sweet but not that sugary sweet where it taste like syrup. Slices of fresh or strawberries and lemons in a mason jar how cool is that. The dishes came to our table everything looked spectacular. I almost didn't say my prayers cause I wanted to dig in. I haven't eaten catfish in over 20+ years. The catfish was Blacken perfect it was moist and delicious if didn't know you were eating catfish you would pleasantly surprised. The macaroni super cheesy the garlic green bean crisp and has onions. The chicken fried perfect nice crispy and juicy. My wife who doesn't like catfish tasted it and say yes I would order that. Why did I wait this long to go to Vonda's. If a home cooked meal is what you are looking for then Vonda's Kitchen can't be beat. Red Velvet cake and macaroni to go the bill was also easy on the pockets for such an outstanding meal."}, {"review_id": "W2JYU8sFONWWKlwoGUfApQ", "user_id": "SNgPR8V-Rr8AXPVNLqkcOg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Service at Vonda's cannot be beat. The staff is both friendly and genuine. The food was good overall, but the standout was the roasted string beans. The BBQ sauce was a little tart and the rice a tad underdone, but neither enough so as to take away from the rest of the meal. Also to be had is the delicious cornbread."}, {"review_id": "TBDzs_Ilge_g5A0GpVIo9w", "user_id": "giJKPZbmZofGMS3f4vl5mg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/8/2017", "text": "We arrived on a Sunday afternoon; we were seated very quickly.  But we waited an eternity for our food.  So did may other patrons.

We were super disappointed bc we were excited to support a small black business.

The only reason why I'm giving 4 starts instead of 5 is because I ordered the signature French toast that was supposed to come with walnuts, bananas and cream. When they brought my order to me, I only received strawberries on the French toast. (Thank god I'm not allergic to strawberries because the menu didn't mention strawberries coming on it). I told my waitress and she went to the kitchen and asked. She came back and said that they didn't have bananas and cream but she did give me the walnuts. Long story short, I ate it because I like strawberries. Other than that, it was a good experience and my food was delicious. $27 for two breakfast meals, two coffees and one strawberry lemonade, and one uptown."}, {"review_id": "y98pTeQrwnbdDlQJVfDdjg", "user_id": "_HQ2Lnsym_M8nNPOSuqvBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/8/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Came for Saturday breakfast and I really enjoyed myself, I ordered: Vonda's Favorite Beef Hash SlidersHome fries w/ cheeseSide beef sausageMy fiancee ordered fish & grits We Shared Side of salmon cakesEverything had flavor and tasted good!Would definitely come back!"}, {"review_id": "ljBWbMd5dgj9PIFCmLtVMQ", "user_id": "xb1-ObRQnNfC9miL7CfmdA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Great wholesome soul and traditional foods made to order abundant menu good atmosphere in the heart of Newark love it"}, {"review_id": "BRbrC11dL9Gk1ZpBbCZQAA", "user_id": "gruKWCj9jEJ5klDGg0bUmw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/16/2017", "text": "I really love the food here.

Some literally walking in circles while customers wait at empty tables, besides filthy tables and in line to pick-up phone orders. NO ORDER whatsoever. I can never support this business again.
