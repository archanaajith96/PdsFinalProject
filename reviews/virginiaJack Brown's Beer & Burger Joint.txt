My first time just after they opened was underwhelming on service. I knew they were better and thrilled to update and upgrade my review. Five to six additional visits have found consistently terrific service and food. Jack's is a downtown Norfolk sleeper, don't miss out. Thursday special / El Chancho / A 50/50 waygu-chorizo burger topped w/ black bean & house-made corn queso, white cheddar cheese & Fritos. Killer! Paired w/ a Firestone Walker Lager.Jack Brown's burgers blow me away. Best in Norfolk...hmm. It most certainly is not on a lot of folks radar, so taste for yourself. Thanks Tyler & Lauren. I just adore the food and vibe. 4.5 rounding up."}, {"review_id": "Defk95L2Eb-blQ3Fv8zphw", "user_id": "4DibPqWCpaAMx3dHLbhBOw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "What a cool place, It s sorta a hole in the wall. There aren't very many tables. It has a decent sized bar with a lot of beers, Not very many on tap, But the bottle selection was absolutely amazing.  I Had the shocker burger with fries. The shocker is basically jalapeno's on Habanero's over pepper jack cheesed with shocker sauce drizzled over it.  Absolutely wonderful, That is if you like hot.  It is definitely a SHOCKER.   The fries were really good as well. they were just crinkled cut with some seasoning.   This place is a must try"}, {"review_id": "mSD6_tJqY8W_IVyRVjiRiw", "user_id": "oTMFIfyQSRpo23nZoWKk3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "One of my friends took me to this place.This is my burger haven. I love everything about this place. Its in Norfolk and you feel like you are actually going out, and not to a fast food joint like McDonalds. SO delicious! The atmosphere is pretty hyped. They have dollars on almost every inch of the place, and bras hanging from a chandelier. Its my kind of place. Jack Browns seating are all high tops...but good thing for parents with little ones...they have high chairs that are actually as high as the high top tables.Their menu is very small, but they don't need a huge menu...because all their food is delicious. I usually get the Greg Brady. It consists of Kobe Beef patty (amazingly juicy), mac and cheese, and BBQ chips. Now...usually when I eat a burger... I like the works...like lettuce, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, mushrooms, pickles etc...or smothered in so much sauce you can barely taste the burger. All their burgers are uniquely made. THIS is the very first burger I have ever had where I don't need sauce at all...or lettuce, tomatoes, etc. I took my friend here to treat her...she loves burgers...and she had the one with bacon, egg, and cheese. She was drooling over the burger that was already in her mouth. Jack Browns has their own house sauce, which I use for their delicious crinkle fries. (Its also good if you dip your burger in it too)They have an incredible selection of beer on tap...and the best for last...FRIED OREOS...These are more amazing than they sound. Funnel cake coating with sprinkled powdered sugar...once you bite into them ,the creme filling drips out. They are warm dream dessert that literally takes you to heaven and back for only a DOLLAR.This is by far my favorite burger place."}, {"review_id": "ctEozBE0jutuDY2wzOlEEg", "user_id": "zoJ_9w3z7uLyIPqpQpny1Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "This place is awesome, totally a hole in the wall downtown Norfolk but the burgers are top notch. I tried the Monday special with fries. It was an amazing juicy burger and crispy fries. The bartender was super friendly and took my order right away during lunch. They had an amazing beer list that I didn't get to try. The place is very small, gets crowded super fast during the lunch hour and not many tables, but definitely worth a try!

The menu was simple, which to be honest was refreshing. I hate having to wade through huge menus. This place offers burgers! Amazing, delicious, juicy burgers. The fries are pretty awesome too. I ordered the Greg Brady cheeseburger which came with House made Mac and cheese and bbq chips! It was amazing! Flavorful, cooked to perfection, and juicy. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is interested in great food at a great price. Three of us ate and it was less than 40.00 including tip!"}, {"review_id": "OZ8LzeWTj-Ja-OZNO7_7FQ", "user_id": "uc5qvp-uGCFleOytHaEIVg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Still absolutely love this place!!!

The place I planned on eating at was packed so my friends and I came here as a backup. Well I'm so glad we did because we loved it! When I heard they were opening up a location in Norfolk, I was beyond thrilled! It is nestled in the heart of downtown Norfolk right on Granby street. The place is very unique and eclectic. You can't miss the huge disco ball covered in tons of bras as soon as you walk in. If you have a dollar to spare, make sure to stick it on their wall after letting your creative juices flow by writing or doodling on the dollar bill. The music selection here is also great. They seem to alternate various genres of music and pick some of the best songs. The place is small and can get really busy, so you may have to wait at times. Everyone here is super friend and attentive. This is a great place to grab a beer and burger. They have a large beer menu, with lots of craft beers. If you love hard cider, try the Ace cider. It is a rotational beer, meaning that they bring various different flavors. No matter which fruit it is, you will not be disappointed. Their burgers here are about as distinctive as this place is. They have your standard hamburger and cheeseburger, but I recommend trying some of the others. The burger combinations can be creative, but take a chance, I promise you won't regret it. My favorite burger to order is the Greg Brady which consists of Mac & Cheese and BBQ chips. It is so so good!! The burgers aren't very large, but still quite satisfying. I really love coming out here; it's worth the drive to Norfolk. I've come here quite often with friends. It's a great place to hang out, have a bite to eat, and grab a couple of beers."}, {"review_id": "W8lvsN-1H_2ZyI0jKfGveg", "user_id": "My4HXhdWl-_InxBlVTEOpg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Honestly one of the best burgers I've ever had I went on Sunday and have the burger with the doughnut didn't think I eat too but ended up ordering a second burger I will definitely be going back again I can't believe this was a hidden gem 20 minutes from my house and I never knew it was there"}, {"review_id": "C-IVDXdAWNuBqTbwLwEvXQ", "user_id": "yqmdni8evqr1Wo8PXzzs1w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Great selection of beers, and man these burgers are like crack!

Grabbed my beautiful girly in an embrace and unsnapped her bra... tossed it onto the big strobe light with all the other bras to mark our arrival.  That didn't actually happen, but it would have been cool, huh?This place was completely packed.  We had never been here so I walked to the back to see if there was more seating, but alas, there was not.  A kind young man left his seat at the bar so we could sit together, that was awesome, and completely unhuman in this day and age.When I tell you this place had the most amazing crinkle cut fries I have ever had in my life, I promise you I am speaking from a place deep down in my stomach.  There is no point in me even explaining the crispiness.. you wouldn't believe me, but holy moly, I died.  The ridges on those crinkle cuts were so sharp my gums suffered.And the burger.. why should I even bother explaining.. I don't even know.. It was like the meat had its own heat source.. Like the patty exuded its own delicious life energy that can not be replicated..  I have had so many burgers in my existence that I would think I couldn't be surprised, but I have been proven wrong yet again.This place is simply amazing.  We are already planning our return visit.  I got the special of the day, the Popeye.  Girly got the Greg Brady.. Amazing.In conclusion, the staff was on it.. The place was packed full but we still felt taken care of and wanted.  Grade A treatment, like the meat they allowed us to consume."}, {"review_id": "ckhBKuAojG15qr4VW3anwA", "user_id": "lWjxj77MNkLe9nZqnxh_OQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/23/2017", "text": "We came here on a whim to satisfy our burger cravings and I'm so glad we tried them out! Their restaurant has a very hipster atmosphere and a huge selection of craft beers to match the needs of their target population. A little dark and quite small inside, but you can take a seat anywhere you'd like. Their menu is very...interesting lol. They have some burger combinations that I would've never imagined! I wasn't in the mood to experiment, so I ordered a burger with familiar ingredients. I decided to get the Chiflet - burger with bacon, egg, and cheese - while Raymond ordered the Greg Brady - burger with BBQ chips and mac and cheese. We waited less than ten minutes and we got our orders...it was INSANELY fast! Our burgers were hot and the fries were steaming and fresh too! I was so shocked at how quick the service was. My Chiflet burger was really good, and the egg was perfectly runny. Raymond's Greg Brady burger was delicious and a cool combination of savory mac and cheese with crunchy BBQ chips. The burgers itself were huge and we left feeling stuffed. If you're looking to enjoy a good burger with a great selection of craft beers, check out Jack Brown's! They will not disappoint :)"}, {"review_id": "e1zezDVl_zbaoFNbjDGHpQ", "user_id": "B7Sb7KJwa0X-inefi1JEDA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "So, the great, and the almost great.First, keep in mind that it's a four star review, this place has really good beer, and the food tastes great, and the staff is friendly, and this place feels like a pub that you'd enjoy visiting - it was a good place for a quick meal when we're traveling to Norfolk for work.The reason it's not 5 star? the size of the burgers... If you are looking for a tasty burger with a wide variety of non-traditional flavors, you've come to the right place. But if you're looking for a place when you're starving after a long day, and you want an incredibly filling burger that tastes good - this may not be the place... there's four (or probably five) gentlemen that have burger places in the nearby area that will fill you up more. I had the Danny Laruso burger (burger, cream cheese, jalapeno jelly) and my business partner had the Cowboy (BBQ Sauce, Bacon, American/Cheddar blend). Both were exactly what we wanted in flavor, but the size of the patty was about the size of a typical drive-thru's kid's meal burger patty. For $6.99 I'd expect at least the Carl's Jr. Six Dollar burger size patty!Thank goodness we also got Fries (Sweet Potato and regular) and they made the difference between going home still hungry or not. (Not to mention the Deep Fried Oreos that we got... now those were awesome and definitely helped keep the review at 4 stars... -- in fact they almost raised it back up to 5 stars on their own.)So - in summary: good flavor, friendly atmosphere, great beer selection. But - if you have a burger and are hungry, plan ahead!"}, {"review_id": "6NyahnB6OtKEO41evpzUZA", "user_id": "vSvfAsZo239mtKMrfY6IYw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Ate here about a year ago and never yelped it for some reason.

They are by no means fancy, but Jack Brown's makes a pretty damn tasty burger. I've had The El Chanco with chilli, cheese, and Fritos, The \"Closeout\" burger with a glazed donut as the bun, The Greg Brady, with mac & cheese and barbeque chips, and most recently their \"One Legged Kung Fu Master\" burger with buffalo chicken dip and cool ranch Doritos. All of them were delicious. I recommend everyone try the closeout burger at least once; the sweetness made for an interesting flavor experience. The crinkle cut fries come with a special aïoli that I cannot get enough of.  I always order two when I come here. Service is always friendly and on point, and prices are pretty reasonable.
