First things first, this is the best place in Kansas City for Tacos! I especially favor the S&P brisket taco, the Old Fashioned, and the Ortiz, in that order. The warm housemade chips they bring out with your salsa before the meal are like none other. I haven't been to a Mexican restaurant yet with better chips.  The style has the bright flashy colors just like many places in mexico, and its partnered well with a modern industrial trend, keeping the place looking both authentic and current. They also provide a few outdoor bag games, just what we like here in the Midwest! Another little touch I enjoy is how huuuge the water cup is, idk why we enjoy that part so much but anytime I'm there I make it a point to drink the whole thing! Gotta make sure you get your water intake for the day, am I right?"}, {"review_id": "KwMkuVB9TGW4okGlk--UWQ", "user_id": "NzrCh4c9df4Y28YsbEYjkQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "This is our go to restaurant for sit down tacos. Their chips are made in house and come with great salsa. Not too chunky and not too juicy. I usually get tacos but tonight I got the chicken enchilada and a margarita. They have one of the best margaritas in town- very well balanced. The chicken enchilada was pretty good, but I'd recommend their tacos if it's your first trip. I'm very partial to any taco with pork belly in it. Seating can be more limited in winter since they don't have the patio open (technically it's open with heaters, but let's be real). Summer is prime time for this place. You won't be disappointed!"}, {"review_id": "pImQ8SlMtoTSj-zP-t-pfA", "user_id": "uXoxtb5QJY9LQDBHo2MepA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "LOVE LOVE ABSOLUTELY IN FRICKEN LOVE with these tacos. I got the Camarones Taco (fried Taco) and the Buena Terra Taco (fried hearts of palm). Both had excellent flavors and were very very fresh! We got the cheese dip as well, and (don't h8 me) it was just too thick and creamy for me. Feel like there isn't that much flavor with itThe only reason is that I gave it 4 stars is because the waitress was inattentive and hard to find if we needed something.

They go a little overboard on the huge glass they give you for your beverage; it held about a litre.  Alex was our waiter and he was very attentive and on top of everything.   The only thing that upset me was when I heard another costumer comment on Alex's lifestyle choices and I gave them the look from h*ll and they immediately stopped    I forgot I was in the heart of bible country but people don't need to be rude.   I will definitely go back here when I visit K.C."}, {"review_id": "oTStp7ApSuk38tYLWPd0lQ", "user_id": "hnLAIE_csZ4q5P8srx6-eg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/26/2017", "text": "Found a new taco place in KC to love and splurge. Out of all the Mexican options in Kansas City, taco republic has to be my favorite! They have a variety of options including delicious fajitas, enchiladas, and so many many taco varieties. Choose based on taco meat or mix and match, and when you order three, you get complimentary rice and beans!We stumbled upon Taco Republic after finding out the Joe's Barbecue is closed on Sunday, but we certainly were not disappointed when we were immediately served free chips and salsa and looked at the menu filled with options. My love for tacos grew seeing the variety of veggie options that were not the standard fajita veggies. Their tacos have battered artichoke or battered avocado or a delicious slaw of vegetables. I first started with buena terra taco and fresco taco, but after finishing both tacos at lightning speed I was hooked! I had to order one more buena terra taco as the taste of fried hearts of palm blew me away. My friends and I pride ourselves in having a high spice but take caution, their hot sauce can be killer! We ended up gulping our waters as we tried to finish a delicious meal. Taco cravings, definitely satisfied here."}, {"review_id": "StlM7ezYkCsA8tFAc0_qJQ", "user_id": "ZbuBuqNK9mR2qNIXAirZ2Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This is probably my favorite place to get tacos.  I always get the shrimp tacos and the guacamole.   Parking is always a problem here."}, {"review_id": "R3oH7d7cAls8jQmD-WFD0w", "user_id": "50V3UxV1yeHnnXKQWKD0pA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/10/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I've finally been here enough to nail it down: The patio is good, the chips and queso are good, but on the whole it's Disneyworld Mexican food. To me, the ambiance and vibe feel a little forced and like they're trying to put a touch of Austin, TX into KCK. Again though, I will stress that this patio is fun and that it's a relaxing, enjoyable time here, it just doesn't always resonate with me. The tacos are fine, but they're not close to what I'd consider classic street tacos. There's a whole host of places where you can get amazing, flavorful, authentic and simple street tacos around, and while these will do, they don't check those boxes. I've been disappointed in the margaritas here too because the ones I've had multiple times don't have a whiff of alcohol in them. Normally one margarita while out is good for me but this tastes more like mix than anything. Their chips are bomb. They're house made, a touch greasy (in a good way), salty and crispy. The guac is also tasty, and depending on the day, the white four cheese queso can be the best around.So just because it's not a super-authentic spot doesn't mean you won't find me here drinking a beer and devouring chips like a mad man on the patio. I'd just highly recommend Yelping another spot if you're dying to have some authentic tacos with real hot sauces."}, {"review_id": "66dKUmhFTZEQvPM-2lW-Ng", "user_id": "UEh7ynhzlkpOGZo9s_IsJg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "I've been a wee bit spoiled and had the Taco Truck visit my work on numerous occasions, so I already knew the gist of the restaurant.

I'm not even a vegetarian and I'm in love with this dish. I've had a few of the a la cart tacos that I haven't loved. The queso blanco is good too!  I've really never had anything that's bad but definitely a few things I wouldn't order again."}, {"review_id": "eVJOmC0M5-yG1NO5OXTB4Q", "user_id": "EnQw88RthDMiKhnMhX51yQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2017", "text": "Never met a Taco I didn't like. Hell I eat em any where from 2-3 times a week. Gotta say though these are some pretty tasty hand fulls of tortilla, meat and toppings. This patio though is easily one of the better ones around. It's not super fancy it's just fun, with at least every other person wearing KC paraphernalia. Beer and tacos are hands down one of my fave combos. Since they do have this, plus taste at a decent price well now I might just be crushing a little. Tried the tostada, had a cole slaw feel to it, so I think I'll stick to the tacos. Chips a salsa upon being seated, tasty, but my personal faves are thinner chips, still good though. Server was all the things you hope and take for granted if you ever do have bad service. Nothing like that here though. We were hungry and service was fast with a smile. Parking, well they are across from Kansas City Joes, so finding a spot can end up being quite a walk, which doesn't bother me. Not to mention I did get my Tacos long before all those in line at KC Joe's(been in that line several times myself). Aahhhhh now I want taco's."}, {"review_id": "RFErZaWCy6EbvlFzP4p22w", "user_id": "I1w6Qp58d_PsCse9WRX-iw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2017", "text": "We have frequented this place since it's conception for I am partial to Bread and Butter concept restaurants being a Johnson County native and all...but consistently time and time again we receive attentive service, good food, and an overall fun dining experience where you are encouraged to hang out awhile. The patio/expansive outdoor area is an added bonus to the place's trendy texmex vibe and diverse mix of waitstaff. The drinks are also quite stiff and creative which is always an added bonus if you like a margarita with your tacos.That is all we get here, tacos, tacos and more tacos. We have successfully tried all on the menu even the unmentionable S&P which is as I mentioned not worth mentioning. Which ones are, you may ask?! The cocinita pibil, the buena terra, the salazar, and to me the carmarones. The first is a  carnitas style pork with crisp fried plantain chips, they make the taco a unique experience because of their sweet flavor. The buena terra is the only vegetarian option but it a special experience worth trying, it contains perfectly fried morsels of hearts of palm, which have a meaty texture but slightly mushy interior. The creamy red sauce and soft avocado are perfect accompaniments. My boyfriend is always consistently ordering the Salazar, which is the pork belly street taco, it has the tomatillo salsa on it as well, which I always ask for an extra side of. The pork belly is always super crispy, which I prefer, so it tastes like little cubes of salty pancetta. The carmorones is the shrimp taco, which I prefer over the fish, I like the breading they use on the shrimp because it is lighter and doesn't overpower the delicate flavor. The margaritas I try are always a surprise, I recently tried the prickly cucumber which had jalapeños and was served in a \"soda\" size glass, it was light and refreshing. The mezcal cocktails are also very innovative for a seemingly simple texmex concept and have hints of smoked salt, as mezcal should. If you are looking for local, but non authentic (you should head over to Independence \"the ave\" avenue or Southwest \"the boulevard\" Blvd for those) street tacos, obviously owned by white suburban folks who are in tune with their hipster side, then try it out...bring out of towners and hey stay awhile, and maybe try out another Bread and Butter concept restaurant while you're at it, and give Taco Republic a go! P.S. the chips are also thick fresh fried tortillas with oil laden pockets of goodness and a gif worthy sprinkle of coarse salt."}, {"review_id": "b9WlmmKFh8ZpeFqR0a9MyA", "user_id": "Tp2R8Y2_xQzMkfViRYolXw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/6/2017", "text": "We love living so close to Taco Republic!

As far as recommendations, you literally cannot go wrong with this menu. My favorite tacos are the old school (ground beef street taco) and Feliz (shredded chicken and jalapeño puree). If you want something besides tacos, the chicken enchiladas are delicious. Their house-made chips are thick and crunchy and the salsa is fresh and smooth. I prefer a little chunk, but it's still tasty. The atmosphere is fun - the color scheme is cool and the bay doors open, so when its nice out, it's almost like sitting outside. Their crowning feature is the massive patio right out front. The tables on the patio are a bit close together, but I've seen worse. The most important improvement they could make is to ask some of the staff to be a touch friendlier. I have found them consistently impatient and not very accommodating."}, {"review_id": "Zd1RIp5Ahte9i-I6cbfkdg", "user_id": "A5T8ey1_3nQzopV0PcCmIQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Great Tacos and Great Atmosphere.  They have a variety of street tacos and each is unique.  I tried 3 types and loved all three.  Our waiter Alex was amazing and helped out with everything we needed.  We will definitely be back.  You should visit as well."}, {"review_id": "U6IZuB_y-7ANwNm5UqGVtg", "user_id": "_ady4d-OW4snY7T0OYrV2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Oh so good.  Love the barbacoa taco.   Al Verde salad is excellent as well."}, {"review_id": "mK3HwqlxkMQoRfTXFlstpA", "user_id": "aUnbWfMAVyfVsDPVuxTOrw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/7/2017", "text": "As a fan of Bread and Butter restaurants I was disappointed to not like Taco Republic.

The positives: the flavor of the margaritas, the fundito came with tortillas, the service.
