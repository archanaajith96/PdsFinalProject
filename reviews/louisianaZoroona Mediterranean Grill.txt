Ordered a side of Grecian sauce and that was 6.99 which seemed high for that. Also, made with sour cream instead of Greek yogurt as I'm used to. Overall good, but not as good as some of the other Mediterranean places in the area. Our waiter seemed to not know much about the restaurant or even how to check us out. I'm thinking he was new."}, {"review_id": "U_zjqVBDGNAz_Feb39lmJQ", "user_id": "eLCxdrloTjAi1dUTdJLVSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/1/2017", "text": "This place is amazing! Every time I have been here it is been a complete delight! The portions are well serve and large, the seasoning in all the food is really good. Of course, foreigner taste, but close enough to the western taste making the experience easy for those who are not used to those flavors. Usually I order the gyro plater and another small dish and we share. (2 people)If you are the type of person who does not finish a large plate and always end up asking for a box to bring food home, (like me!) but you still wanna try different things, my suggestion is to order the gyro platter (lamb/chicken), it comes with hummus, rice and pita bread. Lentins soup are a tasty option, if you like soups. Shawarma chicken is really good too, very tasty and soft. Another tip is that during dinner time they serve a type of rosemary bread and it is the best!Staff is friendly and they are always happy to suggest alternatives for your orders. The decoration and music in the background of the place make the ambience nice. Perfect place for a nice lunch/dinner with friends, family or couple. If you wanna order to go, they have a menu and this is not the type of place where the size of the portions vary when yo order to go. Our box was perfectly packed to keep the food warm and came out fast.This last time we were here, they had a special buffet for lunch on Sundays! It was really awesome. They have salads, cabbage rolls, rice, lamb, chicken, shawarma balls (those are very tasty), veggies, pitta bread, desserts, coffee.. all that for $12 or 13 (I don't remember well), it was totally worth it!!I highly recommend this place!"}, {"review_id": "UxNuGlIMNnisHJuHgDLH_A", "user_id": "5hOfSxQQjtCmUZOJ0q1upw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Very tasty Greek food, great flavors! Our favorite was the chicken Shawarma, it had a seasoned crust that gave it a leg up on other chicken shawarmas at other green restaurants. We got the appetizer sampler which was very filling for two people but let you have a bunch of different Greek offerings. It was a little pricey but at least everything tasted great. I am sure we will be back for some more of the chicken!"}, {"review_id": "iDe0konVSGurLETfl7G6PQ", "user_id": "ZK-7izVjAUlYj32LB0UnyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "I've been here twice and it was phenomenal both times.

Everything that we have had here is very good and flavorful.

You will not be disappointed when you come to this endearing quaint spot.What sets Zoroona apart from others is their variety - they have more options. Of course, they have the classic Greek dishes of gyro, chicken shawarma, mousaka, etc., but they also have other delectables like the Zoroona Chicken.And I've been to this restaurants on several occasions - and have enjoyed the food very much - but when I went today there was one big difference.Today, I saw a buffet. For some, I realize this might be a negative, but I love a good buffet. And I'm not absolutely positive about this, but I don't believe there are any Greek/Lebanese buffets around Baton Rouge (and at $12.99/person for Sunday lunch is an amazing deal).I've heard that the restaurant is under new management and are making a few changes, hence the buffet. Well, as long as they don't significantly change the recipes and keep making great decisions like well-priced buffets, they are on the top of my list of Greek/Lebanese restaurants in BR."}, {"review_id": "g4vvfFtMqoRETXkizFIP7Q", "user_id": "4YLEZjZmxpWvRZPa0gDSDw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Really have to update to 5stars.

Place is huge dining area in addition to the hookah lounge section separated. I came in on a sunday evening and only 3 other tbls there. Staff was friendly and quick. The menu has a great selection.

They have a dip appetizer with hummus, Baba ghanoush, and tzatziki which is nice when you want a bit of everything and have a big table. But what's really interesting about this place is their brunch buffet... The brunch buffet is not really brunch food - no eggs or pancakes, but it is a buffet and it is Mediterranean cuisine. The buffet features a tray of hummus, tzatziki, gyro, chicken, pita (white or wheat), falafels, meat pies, and a giant delicious salad - not to mention baklava and sage tea! If you like Mediterranean food and come in with a big appetite it's an awesome experience and a bit of a nice escape from the stereotypical mimosas and eggs brunch offered by most places.

When I got back to work, opened it, I was a bit disappointed. The salad was swimming in an oil based dressing. The lettuce was somewhat translucent and limp. The hummus looked good, but the taste was not so. It too was covered in oil. It had a spicy, tangy, sour, kind of rotten flavor. Hard to explain, but not good. I will say the rice and lamb kebab was very good. Good flavor and cooked well. The employees were very nice and apologetic for the delay.
