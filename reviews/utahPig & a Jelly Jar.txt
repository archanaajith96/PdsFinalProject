I don't usually like to go out for breakfast because I find most breakfast foods bland and boring. I had the ham hash here, and it really was top notch. Very flavorful, with a perfect light kick from the citrus aioli. I had the half portion, and it was plenty. They also offer free beignets if you add them on snapchat. They were more dense than a traditional beignet, more similar to a fritter, but delicious all the same. I tried the strawberry coconut jam with them which was fabulous. Service was ok. It was quick and she kept my drink full, but there was no enthusiasm, or even a smile, and if I had a question or needed anything  I had to be quick enough to catch her because she didn't pause to make sure everything was alright. I still think the quality of the food made it totally worth it, especially for the price!"}, {"review_id": "JEww7H0wiDHXv_lu6s8RHg", "user_id": "ybnRkTWKjh8crMelTT6CtA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "I'm a fan and i've been here multiple times. But honestly the menu is a little plain jane. It's also a tiny restaurant so it's usually jam packed so there is a wait.They have had a beignet deal where if you follow them on snapchat, you get a free order. They are yummy but not what i'm used to. They are thick and doughy rather than light and fluffy. They do come with delicious berry jam which makes up for this fact. The one perk I like about this place is their delicious drinks! I had pride punch which had white wine, some juices, and rosemary. SO yummy! And only $4. That's definitely a win.Overall food is good. Drinks are better. Service is good so it's worth going to but not my first choice for brunch."}, {"review_id": "dI7fwsmIO49m5WBYPx5dfA", "user_id": "4nEX5R2Zf7ulej2qg2e3tg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Worst service ever! We came in 10:00 AM the hostess immediately said \"where do you want to sit if you know then you should just sit\" we let it brush off. Well we sat down and our server she had glasses asked 'do you know what you want to  drink' well we asked for 3 water and 2 coffees. This white couple sat next to us and they immediately looked at us and asked to move 'me and my mom are Latinas and my fiancé is white' well they apologized to them saying 'we're sorry and moved them while still giving us dirty looks. On top of that, they were treated better than us. We were sitting for 15 minutes before even a refill, The party after us got their food before us, even the damn bread we asked for first. We asked our server \"may we get our bread?\" She just rolled her eyes and says I'll check on it. By then we'd had enough and walked out. Horrible service treating us like second class just because of a couple.The ParkCafe is right around the corner from this place. Far better food and service!"}, {"review_id": "e5s3aec2pbbD99mxuKbxRg", "user_id": "EAucr6AxF_zDIvm7pea3Mg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "time: Sunday 130pm. a lot of people waiting in line. The server told me the waiting time is 30-45 mins. We were seated at around 2pm at the bar. we are a group of 5 people. hard to talk. So i asked for switching seat when another table is empty. She told me that she will ask people to clean it and notify me. We first ordered food and then waited for 20 mins. Another server finally have time to clean up the table so that we could move. the food came at around 230pm. 30 mins waiting after we ordered the food. the slowest kitchen i've ever been. The food quality is below average. Chicken & waffle is really nothing special. I don't understand why it was rated so good and why it has so many reviewers.

Genius move!That's how we heard about this place and that's how we got such a good deal. Including free beignets and toast with housemade jam. The sourdough toast and jam was so good I think everyone should order it. The beignets were light and sweet, again perfect with the jam. For my main, I got the chicken and waffles. The chicken was tasty but the waffle was just a little plain. I think maybe some cheddar or rosemary in the waffle would've make it more flavorful and a better sidekick to the chicken. I definitely need to come back and try the other items on the menu."}, {"review_id": "Kaf9W8_I0TLg09I3LBWlaw", "user_id": "82kxXl_1K8M3cU66dhB8lw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "I refuse to eat at chain restaurants if at all possible whenever I am out of town. This was my first time in Salt Lake City, and I heard Pig & A Jelly Jar was a locals favorite place for breakfast...especially their chicken waffles, which was perfect because that was exactly what I was in the mood for! I arrived and there was a lot of people waiting outside to be seated. 30 minute wait time was ok by me. It did take about 40 minutes, but being that the restaurant is in a cute and charming neighborhood, I didn't mind the wait. One can have a cup of tea at the tea shop next door, go browse at the Asian market across the street, or take walk down the block to Tinker's Cat Cafe and play with the kitties.Once inside, I was seated at a shared table. It was a little awkward at first, but the party seated at my table were very welcoming. The decor fit the theme of the restaurant, but the music was a little too loud and did not go with the \"ambiance\" of the establishment. Service was ok, but my waiter was a little too carefree at times and would forget to check on me. I had to remind him that I had not received my order. The chicken n waffles were pretty good, but not the best that I ever had. Hash House A Go-Go has them beat. But, the waffle was crisp, the fried chicken was moist, the bacon was crispy and my fried egg was perfectly cooked to my specifications of over easy. If I'm ever back in Salt Lake City, I will definitely come back to Pig & A Jelly Jar."}, {"review_id": "wval7GTpkLIpf2gdbSjFIA", "user_id": "OPN_h7OLorITRhn0CWQEkg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Given that most Utah restaurants with amazing ratings have been less than good, to put it lightly, I really wasn't expecting anything amazing here. I'm happy to say was pleasantly surprised by this one.Service was somewhat mediocre, the prices were decent, but the chicken and waffles really were very very yummy, as is their Earl Grey. The Creole breakfast and fried pickles were a definite pass.

We tried this place out on a whim for lunch. The food did not disappoint. For and appetizer I ordered the deep fried pickles and they were super tasty. For my main course I ordered the kitchen sink scramble. It was pretty good, it had sausage, bacon, tomatoes, peppers, onions, kale, cheese and bloody mary salsa. It also came with breakfast potatoes. I thought the portion size and the taste was just right. My only complaint was the long wait (about 30 min at the lunch rush) and the service. To start, our appetizer actually came out after our main course. The whole point was we were waiting forever to get seated so we wanted our appetizer right away because we were hungry. Second, the server was just really busy, it took forever to get things we wanted. For example, refilling my water, or getting more ketchup ect. My family was actually out the door and we were still waiting for our check so we could leave. That being said the server was really nice just really busy. The whole restaurant is small so I would avoid this place if you have a group bigger than six people unless you are ready to wait a while. We will come back again but maybe not at lunch rush. :-)"}, {"review_id": "MiU4hNM8R4KbQEf7Fr4izw", "user_id": "6Hmh8UC5K0oBgp3_D5doDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Came in to the pig and jelly for a snack and left with tons of great food.

His cousins recommended this place and I am glad we made a pit-stop here. The food was pretty darn good. I'm gonna keep the post PG since we are talking about an establishment in Mormon state, ya know! Anywhoo, Jake was our awesome server. He has so much personality and wow he has great information to give to us, too! Yes, I remember this man because he was not only courteous to us, but if he didn't know something that was unrelated to the dining establishment, he was going to figure it out for us. Like how awesome is that?!Now back to the review. We didn't wait long, we came a little after 7:30am on a Sunday. A few people were there, so we were seated right away. The cousins said that this place tends to get packed, so I was glad that there wasn't a line upon opening!Now the food. Out of 5 of us, we got 3 different breakfast dishes. We all ordered from the Pig Specialities menu section. So We got the hash, chicken and waffles, and chicken and biscuits. Now there are various add-ons you can do to them, it's up to you. Out of all three, my most favorite was the hash. The ham is succulent and sweet and pairs well with the lemon aioli that's topped on top of the hash. The lemon aioli contributes a citrus balance to the fatty sweet ham. I think this is the dish to go for.The chicken of the chicken and waffles was delicious. The waffle was good as well but I think the hash stole the show, so I can't rave about this dish. It was good but I think I prefer Roscoe's chicken and waffles, but the chicken has a great succulent and juicy flavor. The chicken and biscuits was surprising. There was you know home fries and then some sweet type of relish (but not relish) within the biscuits with the chicken. It was like chicken biscuit sliders you can say. It was good but again, the hash stole the show.Another tip, look for the snapchat handle. I will also leave a photo. Basically you add them as a friend on snapchat and you get free beignets! One handle per table, but they give you 3 large beignets. They sort of remind me of like whole wheat beignets. They are heavier and denser than that of New Orleans. I prefer a lighter and fluffier beignet. But... they come with their awesome homemade jams! I thought it was blackberry at first, but Jake (awesome server) stated that it was blueberry lavender! Who would've guessed it? In the back of my mind it didn't seem like blackberry but it was like the only thing I could related for it to taste like (did that make sense?). But it was good. I really just want jam now after writing this review. Can someone just buy me some good homemade jam? Or... I guess I can try and make some. Anywhoo, this place is legit. Eat here if you're in need of some good breakfast! Get the hash!"}, {"review_id": "GfSH4ovqv6Nl0JgQFpMihg", "user_id": "tAa8pqbeg3fT44XJfVO0vg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "I really wish I could've given this place 5 stars, because I like the concept but I was really dissapointed. We ordered fried pickles to start, the biscuits and gravy, creole eggs Benedict, and the beignets to finish off.The food took a bit to come out, and the pickles came minutes before the breakfast plates. I found the pickles to be ok, I wouldn't order them again, I wish they were more evenly breaded.My biscuits were really good, they were flakey and baked well but the gravy was lukewarm and underseasoned. The eggs were cooked perfectly (definetly recommend ordering it with extra egg). My friend felt the benedict was over sauced and lacked flavor. I tried the hash and loved it. We both agreed it was the best part of both our breakfasts.The real winner here was the beignets, the jam was really tasty. I'd come back again for the beignets alone.Service was nice, our server was attentive. The can seat parties fairly quickly by having two different parties share a table, which can be kind of awkward for some people. Overall, our experience was ok but the food was pretty lack luster. Maybe I needed to order differently but I'm not rushing to come back."}, {"review_id": "-cy4Tbeoqtge4NGo37rsUw", "user_id": "NtqYrwGtG_ARngmeR915qw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Hear me out, it's all about the EXPERIENCE. Came in and were immediately seated, got our drinks and a menu (although we already knew what we wanted), and enjoyed the beautiful spring night. The decor here is very hipster yet unique, too. It's a quaint little restaurant but there always seemed to be adequate seating (both indoor and outdoor) for everyone coming and going. Our waitress was awesome, continually checked on us and made sure my water cup never reached empty--that's a big deal for me. The food was pretty hearty and yummy. I haven't had bread for a hot minute (new year, new me am I right?) but splurged tonight because wholesome, southern food deserves a try. We tried the toast and jam, the chicken and waffles, and some beignets to finish everything off. Here's the thing, that all restaurants need to do. FREE ITEMS. It 100% will get me back there and leave me with an awesome taste in my mouth. I read the reviews and knew about the deals, but I had no idea they'd hook us up. Smart, smart, move on their part. 1) FREE \"side of toast with homemade jam\" if you check in on Yelp. More like two huge slices of either sourdough or rye with strawberry coconut or lavender jam. The strawberry was delightful, the lavender tasted very flowery but ended up growing on me by the end of the night. 2) FREE \"beignets if you follow them on Snapchat\", not only do you get a little taste, but out rolled three huge ones fresh from the fryer covered in powdered sugar. Seriously?! WOW. Way to go, again, Pig and a Jelly Jar. I wouldn't have bought dessert, but because it was free I gave it a shot, and will definitely recommend it to all the buds. 3) FREE WiFi, if you wish to study. 4) $5 Chicken and Waffles on Thursday's! Huge portions, and if you get all of the other items, feel free to share and spend even less money. All in all, bravo. You made my experience one of a kind and I'm excited to go back and try some other menu items.

This place was just exceedingly okay in all aspects. The food, service, and atmosphere were all okay, but nothing worth going back. From the reviews, I was excited to go here. I can't say that I was disappointed, just underwhelmed. We got the granola, veggie sink, and the breakfast with a veggie pattie. They were all okay, but not extraordinary. I'm thankful for the Yelp deal because I would not have been happy to pay full price here. The service was alright but the waitress didn't come around unless she was dropping something off or we flagged her down. The place is small and it felt like we shouldn't have had to flag her down. My eggs, ordered medium, came out well done. After I asked for new ones, they brought me out runny over-easy eggs. Being a breakfast place, they should at least know how to make extraordinary eggs.Yes, they serve alcohol. Yes, their orange juice is fresh and delicious. The champagne drinks were small for the $4 price point, and didn't taste great. The orange juice was the most outstanding thing about the place.
