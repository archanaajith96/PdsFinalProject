I have been slacking in not writing a review and also never taking pictures. ( if you order you will see why because you just want to eat it). So this Friday I finally ordered the THE STRING CHEESE INCIDENT. I have wanted to order it but it's just a grill cheese right? Noooo American cheese, Swiss, cheddar and creamy goat cheese. Yes I read I did read that on menu but I still kept going with a couple of my other favorites. It's literally is the best grill cheese I have ever had in my life. Mind you I make a really good one. I ordered the tomato bisque soup with it. Amazing. You can order whatever kind of bread you would like. ALL are amazing. I did the multi grain. Also the  bread is baked fresh everyday. I also like to build my own, The greatful day, which a thanksgiving sandwich that is unbelievable and the tuna which I switch up. So once a month a few of us get together and place a big order to be delivered. Not once has it been wrong. Also the prices are ridiculous low for the amount of meat etc that goes into each sandwich. You will not be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "lJj4-NldmiKaqC002xHZOg", "user_id": "QdGbbWneX6FTupiAA-_QIw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "We're not much into the Grateful Dead but I was intrigued by the 60 review 5 star rating this place received on Yelp! so we came by for lunch today to check it out. I ordered the Ruben & Charise and my husband got the Buffalo chicken wrap. We also got a side of macaroni and potato salad and some bottled drinks. The sandwiches were tasty but we didn't care for either of the sides we ordered (potato salad and macaroni salad) - they just weren't too our liking (too starchy, not enough seasoning, and too much mayonnaise for our taste) The sandwich prices are very reasonable and there's something here for everyone. If you aren't interested in ordering one of their signature sandwiches, you have the option to build your own for the same price. In addition to sandwiches, they also offer macaroni and potato salad, soups, chips, cookies, soft drinks, and ice cream novelties. The staff was friendly and there seemed to be a lot of regulars that visited during the time we were there. It's great to see a neighborhood business thrive!"}, {"review_id": "MiSIMaiTvWWaNcisN_Ilzg", "user_id": "7ENkISfAy8zQX-Alihma5A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "I can't stand the Grateful Dead music hate tie dye and not a fan of the hippie culture.  That being said the food is so good I sit there all the time with a big ol' smile on my face!

I am a huuuuge GD fan and I love sandwiches so I finally made the drive over. Very cool there is an arrow sign on Post Road pointing you to the shop because it is slightly hidden and you might not see the dancing bears in the window. The menu is impressive and vegetarian options exist! Very smart of them to offer half sandwiches. My husband is a pickey eater so the built your own was an awesome option. Friendly staff, welcoming atmosphere, and fresh ingredients! Extra star for sandwich punch card. Please open a PVD location!!"}, {"review_id": "LPQKKEYnESQQfMGqsCOXtQ", "user_id": "mqtwyl8JA3fTU3QGLlZt2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "I started working part time in Warwick a few weeks ago and off of a whim I went here one day. I haven't gone to anywhere else for lunch since. I feel like I could say quite a bit about this place, with the great food and really kind people. Kayla who runs the register is very friendly and offers nice recommendations. The cook, whom I don't know his name always smiles and asks if you enjoyed the meal Everytime you leave. It's the small things like that that have made this place a staple for me. They also have a classic arcade machine which is great to see as well. Music is nice and relaxing. My best food recommendation is anything with the pulled pork and Gouda, it's a great combo and very flavorful. All in all, this is a great shop and an amazing place to spend my lunch hour each day.My only regret is I don't have enough disposable income right now to tip these amazing people, but even then, the tips go to a good cause. It's very admirable still having a place like this in a neighborhood."}, {"review_id": "tGdG1QNn7k3XSlDd1ogNWw", "user_id": "B59WB9AO7fxAie5ZoLJxWw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Well having been to Shakedown Street more than once I have a few suggestions. First, the reason people come here is for their good sandwiches. They are good although we got ours to go and there were no accoutrements despite being pricey. Second, why is there not a gmo free choice or even organic ingredients?? How about hydroponic?? Also, the decor is kinda sparse and the menu is hard to decifer. I likely won't come back despite the great reviews on Yelp."}, {"review_id": "tysVpeoEpYw2Nmxtqsesxw", "user_id": "AIMoiEBIUAGbd_gTCqABMA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "Best sandwich in RI...said it!

We were hungry and had no Idea where to go, wanted something different and saw The Greatfull Bread on yelp and decided to give it a chance. The guy behind the counter probably thought we were newcomers but was more than willing to help us decide what to get. There are so many different options, plus the option to build your own, that it makes it hard to come to decide what to get, unless you come here often enough to already know what you like. The only thing I can dislike about this place is that they use the bread and butter pickles, which I dont like, rather than dill pickles. Other than that, everything was fine. Though the place is on the smaller side and is only open 11-7, I find it the right size for grabbing something quick and easy for lunch. The prices are pretty reasonable too."}, {"review_id": "FF0Z1NLt2evflV9GH2NuFw", "user_id": "Fw2YZE5Di5VxJwgIhuzo_g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/5/2017", "text": "Sometimes Yelp disappoints...this was not one of those times.
