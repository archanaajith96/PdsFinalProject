You see, I believe that if you go to a seafood restaurant, order seafood and not lasagna. In other words, stick to the script!I ordered the French Dip sandwich and my wife had the Chicken Saltimbocca along with a House Salad to share. The salad came out and it was a generous portion, certainly enough to share. The French Dip was delicious and flavorful served with long branch fries for $12. The Chicken Saltimbocca was served over a bed of fettuccine pasta tossed with peas (not a fan) and sautéed tomato's in a House buerre blanc for $18. The Chicken Saltimbocca was cooked to perfection stuffed with just the right amount of prosciutto and mozzarella. We like to sit at the bar and our bartender Brit, was friendly and attentive with our drinks and food service. If you're looking for something special give The Butcher's Son a try! This place is truly exceptional and you don't have to worry if you decide, as I did, to venture away from the script because I've enjoyed it every time I visited and I'm confident that you will as well!!!"}, {"review_id": "IyrMCYvECNSUHRG8AIWTrw", "user_id": "IIiDBRUG0rHz5tPSTPHQwQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "1st time and made reservations for a late Valentine's dinner. Located in a small shopping center near other restauarants,so parking can be hard to find, plan to arrive early to find good parking.Our waitress greeted us and the gave us some bread and butter in the beginning. We ordered their French Dip Spring rolls which were amazing, it was filled with steak, mozzarella cheese, sauteed onions, served with jalapeno bacon jam dipping sauce (it was so yummmy, I didnt waste it). As for our entrees, I had ordered their Salmon with the Jalapeno Bacon jam (recommended), I liked the sauce alot I ordered that again, but you can choose sauce options to serve it with. 2 sides were included and so I had chosen to eat it with broccolini and their herbed rice which were both cooked to perfection.  As for my fiancé he had ordered the 20oz Bone-in Cowboy Ribeye steak. (omg so good, I ate his food too), cooked medium rare, served with the jalapeno bacon jam sauce, with green beans and their home fries. Lets just say we didn't have enough room for dessert. Everything was delicious from start to finish and service was great. It's such a great place for dinner! We'll definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "WqX0x3PeyAIG-AJjme-k1w", "user_id": "JTK7sKnx6mLJYz4TNNsxaA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Ok, let me say I gave them 3 chances.  The first 2 times was great food but terrible service.  I am not going back.  The last time was terrible food and service.  The bartenders are unfriendly except for the 2nd time when Justin was working.  He's from Pittsburgh and knows how to make great drinks.The servers have a disappearing act they perform nightly.  I can't tell if they are weak or just not enough of them.  The food, is going down in quality.  It's evident they are using lower quality ingredients.  Probably to save money and improve the margins.They are always busy but I think that is going to be coming to an end in the near future.  Save your money and take your chances on other more well known places."}, {"review_id": "V9745l5OBDxvy0Y66bvwiQ", "user_id": "7UqQ3y-TzLdsoIO-7-s6Vw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "This is one of the best restaurants in Chesapeake.

We went to TBS again after our fabulous first time hoping we would get the same experience. Service was still awesome but we were not impressed with the food. Food was lukewarm and bland. Salmon was overcooked and the steak was undercooked...ugh. We actually had to box our dinner because everything was subpar. Our side dishes were not even fully cooked.  I may try again in the future but not for awhile. A bit pricey for mediocre food."}, {"review_id": "b8HEp9nk1SnQorqFPBbfPw", "user_id": "WLeiGF1lp9goGutXi5AbLg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "The Butcher's Son is a breath of fresh air from the majority chain restaurants that inhabit Chesapeake. It's the perfect venue to celebrate any special occasion. I have eaten here twice, once to celebrate my promotion with my family, and the 2nd a wedding rehearsal dinner. The food here is absolutely delicious, but the service is even better. You go here for steaks, although i did eat the stuffed chicken, both excellent. I've had crab cakes here too, and their selection of sides are fresh, delicious, and not too heavily smothered in oil or butter. They have an excellent selection of beers and wines to accompany your meal, and dessert is always welcome and amazing here. Highly highly recommend if you have not had the opportunity to dine here yet."}, {"review_id": "BNbvmBbqxrlC9cyVcInd2g", "user_id": "al3Ii-nMy0KuuK42wdHfyg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "This is our go-to date night spot.

We were the dumb family that brought a 10 month old and a 3 year old. I apologize to the other diners. Service was pretty slow. It took awhile for someone to greet us, then took awhile to get our drinks. And then once we were ready to order, we heard the specials. As a tip, rattle the specials off earlier. I got the salmon with the smoked honey bourbon butter, loaded mashed potatoes, and asparagus. I opted to add the shrimp imperial, which is 1 crab stuffed shrimp. Kind of pricey for $4/each shrimp but it was amazing!!! The salmon was perfectly cooked. So delicious. I almost didn't get seafood at a steakhouse but +1 for me. Hubby got the rib eye with the jalapeño bacon jam, loaded mashed potatoes and asparagus. He just had a rib eye at cutlass grille and said it was better there. Good, but not great. The jalapeño bacon jam was described as sweet and spicy, but he said it was mostly sweet, not the perfect balance. My mom got the rib eye with loaded baked potato and asparagus and grilled mushrooms on the side. She said it was really good. I tried some of her steak and it seemed good but my piece was really fatty so I am not completely sure how to gage it. We opted on no dessert. I'm surprised they don't have a better selection. Milk and cookies?? Umm??? I would come back for the salmon and shrimp imperial. And the sides. My dish was perfect. But maybe not so perfect for the steak lovers."}, {"review_id": "SRu1df0RMxBtOcF6lBMuCg", "user_id": "U3307zZjjUlaDF9lILb2Bg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/9/2017", "text": "My wife and I finally found our way to The Butcher's Son on a Sunday morning shortly before noon for the Sunday brunch buffet. First off, there will never be an issue with parking as the shopping center has a large private lot with plenty of free parking. Upon entering the restaurant I was immediately struck with how dark it was inside. It was kind of a shock to leave the bright sunshine outdoors and enter a room that took a bit of time for my eyes to adjust to the darkness. The restaurant was pretty full but we were seated immediately. It took a little while for our server to arrive at our table but once she did our service was friendly and efficient for the rest of our visit. The buffet is pretty small and spread out but waiting wasn't an issue as traffic flowed by the buffet pretty swiftly. I would guess about half the patrons were eating from the buffet while the others ordered from the menu. The buffet is $20 per person with a bloody mary and mimosa bar available for an additional $3. My wife and I aren't really drinkers so we passed on the alcohol. There is a small omelet station where you choose your ingredients and watch the chef prepare your omelet. I had an omelet which tasted fine but was pretty ordinary as the selection of ingredients is very limited and spices appears limited to salt and pepper. There is also a small carving station which served up baked ham and prime rib. The meats were good but nothing special. They also had some very nice fried catfish with a nice tangy aioli, really delicious. I skipped the chicken & waffles as they just didn't look appetizing, pretty dried out. On the main buffet I had some really delicious applewood bacon, some really amazing breakfast mac & cheese, some average eggs benedict that begged for a better English muffin instead of the mushy one here, mediocre turkey sausage and ho hum home fries. They also had biscuits and sausage gravy. The sausage gravy was really good but the biscuits were hard and dried out. Their dessert station seems like an afterthought with a very uninspired selection of danish and pastries that look like they just came out of plastic wrap, some fresh fruit which was okay, some muffins and some little tarts which tasted alright.All in all the food was decent but not exceptional save for the breakfast mac & cheese, bacon, catfish and sausage gravy which were outstanding. Considering the food and service I would rate the experience at 3.5 stars but I'm rounding it down due to the elevated noise level (mostly from a large group having some type of reunion in the private room) and extremely dim lighting which I would find well suited for dinner but not brunch. Another annoyance for me was the five men seated at tables near me wearing ball caps. I wish I could get over my hangup with hats in restaurants but I guess I was raised with too much Emily Post and a mother who instilled a sense of dining etiquette during my formative years. I really wish more restaurants had dress codes these days but I guess society has moved on while I'm stuck with the manners of a bygone era. I can accept men wearing hats at a fast food restaurant or some casual dining venues but when I'm eating in an upscale restaurant it just really strikes me as tacky (especially ball caps) to the point where it detracts from my dining experience. Like I said, it's my issue and I wish I could get over it but at this point it still bothers me. I'll keep working on it.Given the number of rave reviews and recommendations from friends I had high hopes for my dining experience at The Butcher's Son but ultimately I found it to be just okay. I will consider returning for dinner some evening to see if I have a more enjoyable experience as I have a feeling I will enjoy dinner here more than a Sunday brunch."}, {"review_id": "XBhMhpA575ATL5DsC6GAxA", "user_id": "rmgBnBbL4qH9m1ES8FPT6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "came here last night for my boyfriend's birthday and it was AMAZING! i made our reservations online and there's a section that asks if it's for an event and if it's your first time there. it was our first time and i put that it was his birthday.  so we got an awesome table and on the table there was a personalized sign that said Happy Birthday!  it added such a nice touch.  then came the food, OMG the food was amazing!  first of all, that bread and herb butter doe!!!! it was the best bread and butter ever. it was our first time there so we opted to get the steaks, oysters for app, and sides.  We both got baked potatoes and he got broccolini and i got the rice.  everything was phenomenal! we also got the flourless chocolate cake for dessert because we were there to celebrate and it was so decadent!  the service was amazing. we had two servers (one was in training), but both gave us amazing service.  They were sweet, had great suggestions, and were super on it.  we also ordered a few drinks that were nice to try.i highly recommend checking this place out!  we will be back soon!"}, {"review_id": "hSVm1E7e_UEJi8WHZbGzcA", "user_id": "U6sjiY1eTsmXK3pFSPQQRg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/27/2017", "text": "The dope spot.

I had a chance to taste the mac and cheese and a couple different appetizers which was pretty good. The wait staff for prompt and get my glass full.

We had a wonderful dinner with excellent food and service. Between the 5 of us we had 3 different appetizers (She Crab Soup, Coconut Curry soup, scallops) and 4 or 5 different entrees (can't remember if two ordered the same steak). My NY Strip was cooked a perfect medium and everyone else's meat was to their liking. Our dad is late 80's and usually doesn't eat large meals but their was nothing left of his 12oz Ribeye. An absolutely wonderful dinner and our server Lindsay was excellent.One tip - we tried to make an early reservation the day before and the earliest they could give us was 7:15 so we thought we would have to go to Plan B (Outback). I tried again the next morning through their online reservations and was able to get a 5:45 which was perfect.
