The clientele is very hipster. I don't know what that says about me/us, because we loved it there too. The husband had the fully loaded biscuits and gravy, which was essentially biscuits and gravy with eggs (anyway you want), sausage and cheese piled on top. It's the breakfast for people who realize their \"food's all going to the same place anyway,\" as my Grandma A would say. I had the tofu veggie - scrambled tofu with red peppers, spinach, mushrooms and pesto. It came with toast or biscuit (I chose 5-grain Spraun toast, which was a somewhat soft textured and tasty bread) and grits or potatoes (I chose the cheese grits...no regrets). We both had brewed coffee, which offered endless refills. All in all it was a hearty and satisfying breakfast and I'm praying they consider opening an outpost close to where I live."}, {"review_id": "3k2IVtSyrkUZ2cKS0SmkjQ", "user_id": "NWKkrswnlRkSrqF1IzliDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "This is AMAZING period. I have been here multiple times over last 18 years and they absolutely just keep getting better. Best breakfast anywhere near Memphis, period!! The San Dieagan open face omelette is crazy good. The mellow Portobello omelette also awesome. Gonna do more in review but people, speed and food are 5 star all the way!!The San Dieagan omellete is insanely good! Open faced with a bed of sour cream, potatoes, green onions, bacon, black beans w/ feta cheese and straun bread, awesome.While this isn't a hipster place it was actually hipster a long time before hipster was a thing and remains a mid town Memphis special kind of hipster place to meet up with friends for a great meal, bring your family or grab a snack and read a paper.They make lots of stuff fresh but the coolest is their completely separate bakery where they make this, among others, bread like the strain bread. It got a unique and wholesome taste and good bread, I have found the hard way, is much harder to come by in Memphis than it should be. Their breads can also be bought fresh to go and are available at select local retailers while daily supplies last.(side note: they actually have been giving back to the community for many years with scholarships, second chances and other outreaches through their bakery. They do lots more than just food right.The coffee and home made jams & jellies are all really good and there's lots of special dishes on the menu here and I have never been disappointed yet. So whether your in need of a fantastic breakfast or a hot and quick lunch you cannot go wrong for this celebrated and award winnong local favorite that somehow flies just a tiny bit under the radar, this is my recommendation to all, without reservation."}, {"review_id": "vxJaJlhT-NUGsIgeEbGxqA", "user_id": "Dp39NPPY0X-ETTLUWugh8g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "If you're visiting (like we were) and not familiar with the surrounding (like we were) you may second guess you decision as your driving through some pretty sketchy neighborhoods on the way to Brother Junipers.Aside from that - it's a pretty good place for breakfast.It's located in one of the neighborhoods surrounding the college, has a very casual feel to it and the staff is nice.The food is pretty good (open faced omelets were tasty) and the service is relatively quick. The jelly's were really tasty and seemed home made. One thing to note - the coffee is lacking.  While we were waiting for a table we sat at coffee bar and ordered 2 lattes - the juniper and a regular latte) and a chocolate milk for the kiddo.  They have a nice big fancy expresso machine that they use coffee \"pods\" in - like the Nepresso type coffee pods.  I don't know if they ran out of beans or that's normal but it was pretty depressing to pay $4 per cup for what tasted essentially like a Nepresso."}, {"review_id": "YjAuvzwOq6ahJyVy4kRb6g", "user_id": "EaRd_4nFnPs8Fei-H2ZmVA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "What to get: cheesy gritsService: 4/5Atmosphere: casual breakfast/brunch, dinerWait: 0 mins (Tuesday 11AM for 1)Parking: Parking spaces in front of shopsThe Experience:Come here for a rich, comforting and filling breakfast. I think Rachel Ray had recommended this local spot and it is quite charming. It reminds me of a local diner, but more intimate. Also, it gets pretty busy and even on a Tuesday morning in winter, one of the dining rooms was halfway full. There's also parking spots in front of the shops, but if it were more busy, I'm not sure where I would've parked.I ordered the Hungry Tiger open-faced omelet, which is loaded with different types of cheese. Makes me think of an egg skillet with potatoes. The dish also comes with cheesy grits and 4 slices of toast. This is a very rich dish and I could only eat all pieces of toast, honestly. The cheesy grits almost borders a mac n cheese creaminess. The omelet wasn't my favorite. I tried to eat as much of it as I could, but it just was too heavy for me.If I do ever come through Memphis again, I'll think about possibly ordering something else, but it was fun to try this local spot."}, {"review_id": "i2R3Max7kjscuXOoVw-8OA", "user_id": "dNlN6CrkXKXKfHXJRD5pkg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "We are in town for the weekend, visiting from Texas. We decided to try this place because of the reviews on yelp and yet again, yelp did not steer us wrong. Service was very friendly and fast. I ordered the Monte Cristo, which came with cheese grits. I'm pretty sure I died and went to heaven. The bread is actually french toast and the cheese is melted perfectly into the bread and the ham. Writing this review makes me want to go back and order another. My husband enjoyed the steak benedict. The hollandaise sauce was VERY tasty! We shared a HOME MADE cinnamon roll after breakfast and it was an ooey, gooey, perfect mixture of cinnamon and yummy heavenly icing. We will definitely be back.

This Tuesday (3/13/2018), was the first time I have ever been here. We were immediately greeted with the bubbly girl sitting at the front. She told us it would be 10 minutes to sit or we could sit immediately at the bar. We chose a table this time and sat at the front waiting to be seated. The bartender asked if we wanted a drink while we waited and we declined. After about 5 minutes our table was ready. The place was way bigger than we thought! So we sat and were presented with the menu. Omg so much to choose from! Everything looked so good! There were plenty of options for me considering I'm vegetarian! The server was also shockingly very bubbly and nice! I ordered a spinach and mushroom omelette, avocado toast, and cheese grits!! Those cheese grits were doooooopppee yoooo!!!! Omg! So then I finished that and ate the avocado toast omg!!! I ate every single bit!!! Next up the omelette ?! Heaven oh mighty!  We finished, got our check and went to the front where the owner (very nice man!) was at the cash register doing the checkout! We got to talk to with him and talked about the business and Memphis! Lots of history! I will definitely be visiting again and recommending to everyone i meet!

We tried a couple of the open faced omelettes, all of them were good. The San Durham is great for people that like feta cheese and sour cream. If you are a lover of pesto, you may want to give the Florentine a try. I like pesto, but having it for breakfast with eggs was a bit unusual. My mom loved it tho, that one was her favorite. The potatoes are seasoned perfectly. Service was fast and friendly. I love their biscuits, it was delicious!They had a long wait, it was over an hour. Call ahead or make reservations if possible. They use an app that lets you know your place in line, it's pretty nifty.

The garden and lamb omelet was hands down one of the BEST omelets I have ever had. The combination of the ingredients was a perfect marriage. The saltiness of the lamb and feta was balanced out with the fresh spinach and tomatoes blanketed with mozzarella cheese. The picture does not do it justice b/c you can't see whats on the inside.

I like how each coffee mug was different for lattes and had the mocha latte which was delicious. My husband had the Carmel and mocha. 3.50 a piece. Barista suggested the hungry tiger (13.95) since it was my first time which my husband got as well. The open face omelet was delicious, strong flavors which I could only eat half of. Biscuit was delicious with blueberry jam and apple butter. Cheesy grits I'm not too big a fan of. They tasted like straight pure cheese which wasn't bad but didn't settle well with my stomach with a few bites. I feel the environment is diner like though wish they had more seating after 45 minutes of waiting as well as more parking. Hope to go back soon and try some other dishes!I've come back twice since my first review. I got the San Diegan open face omelette and a build my own omelette.   Both were delicious but I think I'll go with the pre-made ones next time, leave it to the professionals. San Diegan was very good as well as the hungry tiger. My company got the pesto one which she enjoyed and the eggs Benedict. Wait is always a bit but you wait for a quality breakfast you can't get just anywhere. I do hope they expand sometime to get more seating."}, {"review_id": "Kpg4sv07sYhq1jVAuYXnHg", "user_id": "Vc2AQt6KOQpT-896nciUPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Shawn or Shaun Reynolds is the bomb.com.

We ordered the San Diegan, plus a half order of blueberry pancakes to share upon the recommendation of our server. I greatly appreciated how nice he was - not only was he honest about the portions being large, which they are, but he still checked in on us multiple times as if we'd each ordered a main (I've been to plenty of places where servers stop caring about you if you don't order a certain amount of food).

Saturday morning we quite by chance woke up promptly, so we booked it over there around 7:45 and were seated immediately. Sunday morning we planned ahead a bit more and arrived a few minutes before they opened at 8, so though we weren't first in line, we again had no wait. Of course, your mileage may vary greatly on that front.However, what really matters to me is the food, and both days my breakfast was fantastic. I stuck with the \"number 2,\" which is eggs, meat, etc. Scrambled eggs were cooked without being brown, bacon was crispy, breakfast potatoes were to die for (some kind of parmesan seasoning on top was delish!), and of course the fluffy biscuits were excellent. Plus, everything was served piping hot, which is getting to be a rarity these days -- I've been subject to more cold eggs recently than seems reasonable.Coffee was also excellent, refilled regularly, and the servers took us seriously when we said LOTS of cream. This is a family-run place, so there's not much turnover, and we we actually recognized by one of the servers as well as one of the owners (despite not having lived in Memphis for a few years now). There's something to be said for being able to chat with folks who've been running the place for years.So overall, I have definitely changed my tune on Brother Juniper's, mainly due to the food. I would be very happy to come back here for many more breakfasts!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/brother-junipers-memphis?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
