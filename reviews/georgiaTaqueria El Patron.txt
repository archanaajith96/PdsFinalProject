I do like the fact that you get three different salsas with the chips, that's a little new to me. The Fajitas are great, everything was seasoned perfectly. The menu is completely in Spanish so bring your translation devices if you don't like asking questions. I also grabbed some tacos to-go for something to eat a little later that day, although the soft shell broke pretty easily, it was still tasty. I also took the tea to-go, the next morning when I was pouring it out I noticed syrup at the bottom so not sure if they used that on top of sugar to sweeten their tea. Either way I didn't get sick and can't wait to try this place again."}, {"review_id": "-zBBg8wyKi8MLq9e_eq2rw", "user_id": "ykdGNTmrZ6mRHhvEDUT8wg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "*Update* Ok so I got the cheese dip the next time I went and mixed my salsa with it (as I always do at Mexican restaurants) and it's great. I was being overly picky about the cumin in the salsa before. Five stars.There isn't much to say that many other reviewers haven't already said. The meat is so juicy and fresh and is definitely what sets this place up above the competition. The food (I ordered my usual at Mexican restaurants, the chicken fajita) is fantastic. However, and maybe I am just picky, but, I had to deduct a star as I was unfortunately disappointed with the salsa. I was particularly excited as I had read that it is home made, and I don't doubt that it is, but, it has more cumin than most salsa at restaurants and to me it gives it that bottled taste. The green salsa was good. The hot salsa tasted of too much vinegar. Overall, this place has some of the best Mexican food in the area. But the salsa falls short for me, so I can't quite justify a five star review. So it gets a solid four stars from me."}, {"review_id": "djAH6zqSJM_BmgZ9dB6zwQ", "user_id": "AnFMQiwbuTqCVmDf2a5rjw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "Well....not as good as I had hoped, but not terrible either.The good:1. Very quickly seated and had our food in front of us within 5 minutes.2.Atmosphere reminded me of old Mexico. Very colorful. Hand painted booths with beautiful Mexican scenery, flora, fauna, and people. Ivy hanging from the ceiling.3. Food was good overall.Not-so-good:1. Location of the restaurant looked to be in a run down part of town.2. One waitress, and she spoke very limited English. Had trouble understanding our order.3. Our food came very quickly; but no side dishes with it. We  think that possibly the rice and beans mentioned was maybe in the burrito itself, although mine had no beans; was only lukewarm when I got it, and cool by the time I actually got half way done. Tasted good though.4. They need more waiters or waitresses, or at the very least a bus boy or girl. This was late afternoon, around 4; not many people in there, but she had a hard time taking orders, serving orders, and keeping the tables cleared. Had we walked in with 6 different tables uncleared...probably would have walked back out. Just not appetizing seeing other people's uneaten food.5. Though our main entree took literally a few minutes from order to table...our dessert  (sopapilla) took almost 20 minutes to get.I almost gave the restaurant a three star, because for me it wasn't a great meal...but my hubby raved about it , so I went with a four star."}, {"review_id": "oMdJ2JZA89EKC1DTKGNlhQ", "user_id": "97srN4PV5Fb6efZ5e0KmZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This is our first time in Augusta and we decided to go out for your standard Mexican fare.  Let me tell ya...this ain't it! This place blew us away!  Hands down, best Mexican food ever!!  More authentic than any place we've been before.  There's actually a little market inside and, to my surprise, they don't sell alcohol....at all!  Nothing!  But that made it all the better to really savor the meal!  Absolutely wonderful! Since we'll be moving to the area this summer, this will quickly become a go-to!!"}, {"review_id": "ybTAFaLe-w9SMfZ-KdoIuA", "user_id": "99dWKUy55ATtMe6IEhGn9A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Food was just average.

Overall, I find this taqueria to be okay, a place I would go if I was really craving a taco when visiting Augusta.I called in today to order to go during lunch (1pm), was put on hold for 3-4 minutes, but nobody came back to the phone. I hung up because I was almost at the restaurant. I walked in to order and as I was paying, the woman at the counter was taking to go orders on the phone... okay. -- I've eaten in the restaurant once before and service was great. Waitress I had was attentive and asked several times how we were doing.I ordered 4 tacos at $2.75 each. The food came out quickly, but I should have asked for more salsa. I got 1 red  (a burnt, peppery taste) and 1 green (more tomatillo taste). Be sure to ask for more salsa if you use a lot. There's also no salsa for the chips. Tacos are a good size, I think I could've done 3. Overall, $2.75/each seems a bit much. Their handmade tortillas are good. However their meat lacks in seasoning. I ordered steak and chicken. Chicken has very light seasoning, but was cooked well. Steak was dry and also lightly seasoned."}, {"review_id": "ogxbqrzx6U6JK8ZLaZfxyQ", "user_id": "Il-3p7UNDQ_dN_XrPhfpLA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/14/2017", "text": "So much yum. Haven't had many tacos in Augusta thus far but these were authentic and soooo yummy. I can't speak for all of them but I do know the fish tacos were bomb. We ordered takeout and got a bunch of different tacos (even ordered some tripe and lengua but I didn't eat those haha not my style). Reasonably priced for what you get and they give you all the limon and radishes to go with your tacos too. I have yet to visit the actual restaurant but I've heard many locals love it! They have combination plates and a section for each different meat they also had some desserts too!"}, {"review_id": "4m8iOnf9JGMbVlXMIwFHMw", "user_id": "syMA7ln75mlYufGjwctWQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/11/2017", "text": "First time coming here and I was pleasantly surprised!

I am Mexican, as such I know the standards of our food, you don't serve a standard tortilla with low quality cheese on a wet plate charge nearly five dollars and call it a quesadilla. You don't serve tortilla soup with fried flour tortillas in a green broth and find this acceptable worse still charge a person who says it's awful and has taken to sips, you can't throw powder in water and call it it horchata and you certainly don't charge .99 when someone asks for lime without even telling them you'll be charged a dollar for this. Most Taco shops and restaurants wouldn't charge for this it's like going to Starbucks and getting charged a dollar when asking for sugar or cream. All the dishes are made with half the enthusiasm they should be made with and with a price tag that only an idiot would be okay paying. I've returned several dishes here and last night gave it a chance again because I was nearby, my husband and I have been nauseous all night I hope I don't have food poisoning because I'm also 6 months pregnant. Peace out Patron, I was excited by the variety on your menu, gave you several chances and last night was the straw that broke the camels back.

It's my friend's turn to pick, so he checked his Yelp and came upon this place and picked it for us to dine in. I have passed this place over a million times and never ever saw it until this night. I'm not very fond of Mexican food, so I stick to the places I know are really good and have good food. So I was on the skeptical side. We walked in and seated ourselves. I had eaten earlier so my appetite wasn't huge, so I knew I would pick something light. So I thought!!! The waitress came and took our drink order. I chose the fruit flavored drink. It wasn't bad at all. It's an acquired taste but good. I ended up choosing chicken soup to dine on. I had never had chicken soup from a Mexican place so I didn't quite know what to expect. The chips and house salsa was brought out before the meal and they weren't bad at all. Then the soup came out and it seemed like it wouldn't stop coming, literally. It was brought out on several dishes. One with rice, one with vegetables, and the other with broth and the meat. It was a heaping portion of everything. If someone was ordering this item to get over a illness they could eat on it for about a week or a week and a half. No lie!!! I was amazing how big the soup came out. It was tasty as well. Of course I couldn't eat much of it because it was such a big portion but I did eat on it for a while at home for leftovers. The food, atmosphere, and service here was great. I have no complaint about anything!!! This is a pretty cute little business/restaurant!!!"}, {"review_id": "dwYlOQHA4dXeHAye0lfebg", "user_id": "xOeBg5uohDgMu0nX9gRsAw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/29/2016", "text": "BLUF: AWESOME Mexican spot. 4.5 stars!My friend recommended this spot to me (she also recommended El Rey), and I went and checked it out with the guy.

The tacos were comparable to the ones at El Rey, but I definitely think these had a little edge up on those ones. They were soooooooo good! My burrito was also DELICIOUS!
