He says he loves eating Oscar's, and that he takes all his visitors here to eat, and I am grateful that he did.Oscar's is a little hole in the wall taco shop, with barely any standing room to even order. There is seating outside along the building, with great views of the street for people watching. It's super casual and laid back - very SoCal to me. Their menu is straight-forward, you order and pay at the counter, the soda machine is right there, and you wait for your number to be called for food pick-up.We ordered lots of different tacos to try, and I loved them all. Unfortunately, they were out of octopus, so I didn't get to try an octopus taco.  And they were out of mixed seafood ceviche, so we got the shrimp ceviche.  It comes with 2 crispy tortas to scoop up the seafood. Their ceviche is super fresh and a MUST TRY!I got the Battered Fish Taco and Taco Especial (Smoked Fish, Shrimp, Scallops, served with Cabbage, Onion, Tomato, Cilantro, Avocado & Cheese).  My boyfriend got the Surf & Turf Taco. Out of all of them, the Taco Especial was my favorite.The prices are very affordable, especially considering that their tacos feature seafood and some with avocado. When you're done, you can continue exploring the rest of PB and the beautiful Cali seaside."}, {"review_id": "bKpDO_UWiZD7L_U9fujwDA", "user_id": "OmqbjNA3hISmbSBlFJ7n7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Parking: The joint is a pretty small hole in the wall compared to the other two locations, but I feel like the parking here is actually the easiest since there's a lot of street parking around vs. the tiny plazas for the other locations. Seating is pretty limited and mainly outdoors so it can get chilly. Food: Best Seafood Tacos in the multiverse. This location also seems to have the best-tasting fish and they don't double tortilla so you don't get full as fast. Everything I've gotten has been butter for my taste buds. My favorites are probably the octopus, spicy grilled shrimp, surf and turf, and especial with scallops or octopus. Must order at least one octopus. Texture and juiciness of the octopus and shrimp are amazing and the steak is tender. Sauces are excellent here. The orange one has a kick and the green one is smooth. Their ceviche is great as well. Sour and refreshing.  If I'm hungry I'll usually get four tacos, but I'm usually satisfied by my third one. Service: The lines can get super long, but these nuggets of flavor are definitely worth the wait. They seem a bit understaffed for how popular the place is. Occasionally they run out of different fish so be careful when going around closing hours.  Prices seem a bit high for tacos, but the amount of food surprisingly fills you up. Must visit if you're craving seafood in San Diego."}, {"review_id": "Ry2vCCx39wIaJNeFWMklNg", "user_id": "_Ogt5-xmrwgM-sA_Hmgpcw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I love fish tacos.  Love, love, love.  Most especially the baja-style battered kind.  These tacos are delicious, cheap, meaty, and just a flavor combination in the mouth.  This location gets busy as it is position just off of the beach and main drag.  Small place but has seating inside and a few tables outside in the sun.  Staff was friendly and the usual salsa suspects were kept inside.These tacos were to die for.  The cabbage was fresh.  The fish was hot upon arrival.  The shrimp taco was really good as well.  The salsas complement the tacos really well.  The only issue I had was that the tortillas were a little dry and stiff on this occasion.  I can let that slide though.  Many fun drinks on tap and by the bottle.  Will definitely be back my next trip to San Diego."}, {"review_id": "_95xF9hsOKUJQL8Q2KTKsQ", "user_id": "_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "I had this bookmarked for being on TV as well as for being a generally strong recommendation from a friend of a friend. That bookmark was definitely justified.Oscar's Mexican Seafood is a colorful and appropriately colored spot in Turquoise Street in the northern part of the Pacific Beach (or \"PB\" if you're a local). It is such a small hole in the wall that there isn't any seating inside, save for a toilet in a tiny restroom. Instead, you'll have to find a spot at one of the counters outside (also the best way to spot it from your car), whether there are enough stools or not.After you manage to find street parking somewhere, you'll need to squeeze inside to check out the seafood-focused menu on the back wall, then turn around and place your order at the register. Stay nearby so that you can hear them when they call out the number on your receipt, and make sure that you can get a hold of the squeeze bottles containing their sauces (more on these later).You can't go wrong with the Battered Fish Taco ($1.99), one of the cheapest on the menu. It's some sort of battered and fried white fish that's crispy outside and moist inside, and it comes with a motley assortment of cabbage, onion, tomato, and cilantro. Definitely reads more San Diego style than authentic Mexican, but still works. And so does the corn tortilla, which you should always get unless you're somehow allergic to corn and/or willing to shell out $1 extra for flour shells.As I alluded to earlier, the sauces are important, and they're generally why the tacos here work. I didn't find much flavor in the mild-medium spiciness red sauce, but the orange sauce is great on the battered fish taco and most of the others, whereas the green sauce is best for their skirt steak.Even with that green sauce, I didn't find much flavor in the steak on my Surf and Turf Taco ($4.60) compared to a similar taco which I've eaten recently in San Diego. Worse yet, the rather puny grilled shrimp were overcooked. I wouldn't recommend either of those proteins, although I'd chance the battered shrimp taco if I should come back.The Atun Adobado Taco, aka Al Pastor ($4.65), was better. They offer up the typical adobado marinade with not-overcooked tuna. The flavor is fine, but the pineapple portion was lacking. I'd rather stick to traditional pork at a cheaper place than get this again.The star of my meal was the Smoked Fish Taco ($4.65). In combination with cabbage, avocado, and especially cheese, it's powerful and addictive. I could've actually eaten it without the sauces.Oscar's Mexican Seafood is charming and a solid choice for a seafood taco in San Diego. Just make sure that it's the right taco and that you bring cash."}, {"review_id": "KrMv-R0Mah2NSDiUI2I7Cg", "user_id": "3RPORizfUAhI9HS-Nd7RJA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "This hole in the wall Mexican joint is worth a visit.  I just parked by the boardwalk and walked over here.  There's not much parking anyway.  Get the tacos!  I recommend the surf and turf or octopus.  I think anything with grilled shrimp is going to be good.  One taco is pretty big.  Perhaps if you were on the hungrier side, you would order two.  I shared a torta, but it was still really filling.  The sauces are self-served.  They have a small area for high top tables, but you might just have to stand to eat.There's another location a few blocks away if the line here is too long!"}, {"review_id": "OKe0W-tw_RE76iQ_44FXGQ", "user_id": "MUa0FTNBVe3yHXhaOPHjRQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Legit best tacos in San Diego. Flavor is on point, and it never disappoints. My favorite are the steak and smoked fish tacos, but I've tried several others which are fabulous. Their sauces are delicious, and are not dairy based, so if you're dairy-free the sauces are ok. They also have great ceviche and gaucamole; in fact it's the only place in SD that I will ever order ceviche. It's super lime-y, like ceviche should be. Expect to wait to order, and then to wait to get your tacos; because it's a small place, they only have 2-3 people in the back cooking, and often in that 2-3 is also the person who rings you up. BUT if you can wait, your patience will be rewared with deliciousness. I take everyone here for real SD tacos and I have even gone here alone a few times for taco takeout. So delicious all around."}, {"review_id": "t-ki7mDzwt2oco5aHRoC5Q", "user_id": "X1Cy1xsDawDiH0o9dmDIXA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "PROS:-the BEST tacos for super cheap!-Right by the beach & bars :)-DELICIOUS sauces for your tacos-Everytime I'm in SD, I visit this place.FOOD 5/5:-Battered fish taco ($1.99)-Battered shrimp taco ($2.99)-These tacos are amazing, it's served with cabbage, onion, tomato & cilantro.

The quantity of food is large and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I initially ordered flank steak taco and smoked fish taco( wanted octopus but they were out). The steak was perfectly marinated and flavorful. The smoked fish is a must! The fish was smokey, salty and flaky similar to moist beef jerky. It was finger licking good! I was so satisfied I went ahead and also ordered the grilled shrimp taco. This was also amazing. We also got mixed fish ceviche which was spectacular.

If you're looking for a good portable food to take to go, I'd recommend the ceviche as it comes in a sealed cup with the tostadas wrapped in tinfoil.I got to try the octopus tacos and combo ceviche and both were incredible! The octopus was not tough but rather tender and the combo ceviche was exactly how I like my ceviche done, chunky with lots of shrimp and fish and limey.

Maybe you have to stay there and dine in. Lunch time on Thursday Jan 4, 2018. My cousin ordered our food to go. I'm not familiar with burritos looking like open face soft tacos and not rolled up and tucked in so nothing comes falling out. My cousin asked specifically for ceviche with BOTH shrimp and fish ceviche. When we opened it up at home the ceviche was clearly a cup of larger cuts of fish only ceviche and no shrimp ceviche existed. They give you 2 crispy tostadas that we broke apart to use as chips to dip, that did not work well, we had to use crackers from home to eat the rest of the ceviche with. We went to open our messily little foil wrapped \"burritos\" to find regular sized soft taco looking Surf and Turfs all smashed. This is the worse looking burrito I've ever seen unless they messed up the order and gave us tacos. We had 2 orders of the Surf and Turf. There was more cilantro on it then cabbage or lettuce filling. The meat was not cooked well enough. The third burrito was my aunts and it was beyond pathetic! She ordered the Breakfast Burrito with Chorizo and Eggs. It looked like it got thrown against a wall and stepped on then wrapped up and thrown into a bag. Again, not folded up properly, super greasy, could not even pick it up or refold it, the burrito would not stay put, and she had to end up eating it with a fork and knife. Terrible! Oh and on top of that they didn't ask if we wanted any salsa nor included any in the to go bag. Not to mention the chef was EATING behind the counter. Don't you have a break? The customer service needs to improve. Here is an idea: LISTEN, pay attention, and follow through while taking an order. It was not even busy and they just opened. Usually this place is packed and it's very popular so after this experience I don't think I can recommend it. There are so many other places that know how to make a burrito in SD."}, {"review_id": "xt5Ep018BwUpE05E0Ri2cw", "user_id": "V-FI5ytm8ZAe8Lo6wdTdBg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "I was recently introduced to this spot, which I've actually never heard of surprisingly since it seems so popular and has so many reviews.

It's a cute shop right off the PB Boardwalk so yes, it's a convenient and relaxing place to enjoy lunch by the beach.If you really like the way seafood tastes, smells, veins and everything, Oscar's fish tacos are for you~ I personally thought they were overpriced and small thus not filling (they do have a happy hour w/ .99 tacos M-T afternoons) and the sauces that came with the meal to garnish the tacos were not impressive.
