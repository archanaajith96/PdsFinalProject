The tum yum soup is incredible and perfect prescription for the common cold; always clears it up for me. I always get the drunken noodles as well; typically perfect balance of hot/spicy and you can even have them spice it up even more! If your in the mood for some Thai this is a must for me!"}, {"review_id": "1nDvZUduzclADn8l0dkJmw", "user_id": "TUzBBmVzH291DzdegMFLMQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "The only reason I'm giving this place a 2 star is because the server was wonderful.  Though he was by himself, he was attentive to our needs and to everyone else.  He was also pleasant and efficient.  The food though was nothing but ordinary and bland.  The Tom yum was bland that needed more salt or heart in the cooking.  The \"Special Chicken\" was actually sticky chicken wings that has burned sugar.   The steak tips was burnt and the salad dressing tasted like something old that you cannot explain.  The Panang Beef was good but not exceptional.  It was a bit watery than normal.  Paid $60 for 1 lousy appetizer, 1 soda, 1 thai iced tea, 1 panang bef and steak tip beef-quite pricey.  So, sad to say we're not going back there.  If you're craving for Thai food, drive a little bit more to Dyer Ave. In Cranston and find Thai Star instead where everything in the menu rocks!  Including the beef noodle soup."}, {"review_id": "Pu_rhTlOabdwP_GZu5am8w", "user_id": "H7_6Xbh4VxqLbzavqKg_0g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/12/2017", "text": "Cute restaurant, very clean, and friendly service. The food I ordered was okay, definitely not bad, but not the best. It was a bit oily for my taste and veggies a bit overcooked.  It is suited more toward the American palate. The sticky rice is really good though. I'd try it again, requesting a bit more heat next visit for main course. In all fairness, I went just before they closed last week, so as mentioned, will try it again."}, {"review_id": "ksNOsuEB6qEZ8yjlzz13Wg", "user_id": "_0-zPFu7emgjDgPDmyS4zQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/17/2017", "text": "This place is a Gem.   One of the Best Thai food around.     This was my second time here and every dish is simply Thai.     I highly recommend it if you are looking for authentic exotic Thai food."}, {"review_id": "tDv0fDoNWfuNFuYdBl2vtw", "user_id": "mTySHvHUZSqztolDaBuAtw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2017", "text": "The Food was delicious !

I stopped in tonight to surprise my hubby with take out dinner. He LOVES the Garlic Seafood! It never disappoints him! After going over the menu with owner, Toni, I decided to try the Shrimp Pik Pow. Toni warned me that it is spicy, but I wanted to try it! It was amazing! Spicy? A bit! But so good! A side of white rice was perfect for the heat! Steve and I love you guys and your food!

The service, atmosphere and food are all \"spot on\". The Thai dishes are authentic and superbly spiced. I highly recommend the Basil Fish with jasmine rice. Also the Singapore noodles were delicately seasoned and thin rice noodles perfect texture. Curries r great too.  Tempura calamari is tender and light with n amazing dipping sauce. Tate is an excellent server which totally makes for a perfect dining experience. Hidden jewel ... go find it."}, {"review_id": "9XuvYtdvUUTc3ugdxytTEw", "user_id": "Xnd-TjWvgbh9apBq_oZP2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/28/2017", "text": "Probably my new favorite place for Thai takeout in the Providence area.

I'm a Thai food snob and am known to drive to Boston to get to my favorite Thai restaurant. The food here is amazing and authentic! Soups are fresh seasoned perfectly, seafood excursion was to die for with giant scallops and large shrimp. Excursion rice was delicious with just the right amount  of spice! Drinks were tasty and fresh. We will be back regularly and highly recommend! The bartender Toni is super too; she tops off experience with her recommendations and knowledge of the entire menu which is large ! You will not be disappointed, unless your looking for Asian fusion Thai food then don't go here, authentic Thai at its best!
