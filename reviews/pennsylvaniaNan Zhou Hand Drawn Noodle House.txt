Inside are fairly large family-style tables that seat up to ten people at a time, with smaller ones that seat parties of four. The menu was extensive but contained pictures for those unfamiliar with the art of noodle selection.My table started off with their deluxe appetizer set with plenty of meats to go around including tripe, pig ears, and brisket. Portions were large and the meat was well seasoned and marinated. Afterwards, I got my order of their Seafood Shaved Noodle Stir-Fry ($10). I am a complete sucker for these thick cut noodles and the dish was pretty damn good. While a bit on the saucier side, it was a lot of food and I wasn't able to finish it after we had all shared our food with one another. Overall, it was a good choice.My colleagues had chosen Nan Zhou as our lunch spot to host the 50 of us for a lunch social, and I couldn't be happier with the management. They were willing to give each of us separate checks as long as we paid in cash at the table. With all the orders we placed, they kept a steady flow going and never once seem frazzled at all our business.Keep up the great work Nan Zhou. Your noodles are pretty good so I know you'll continue to stay in business for future locals and tourists alike."}, {"review_id": "M3KIIfvk1OWskguvkFQacg", "user_id": "vHD6gH1GU9-qtTP_b-hypg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "I came here on a snowy day wanting some noodle soup to warm me up.I think I probably ordered the wrong thing because I liked the idea of getting lamb but I thought the lamb noodle soup would come with the same broth as the beef noodle soup. Actually, it came with cubed lamb with clear vermicelli like noodles in a white cloud broth. The noodle soup was ok but I'm sure it was loaded with MSG because I had to drink like a gallon of water after. The soup did not hit the spot.

The shaved noodles have a fun texture that stems from the varying thickness of the fresh noodles. The beef is tender and has just the right level of flavor. There is quite a bit of cilantro, but it's not a showstopper as I can simply move it aside.Although the broth should suffice as a drink in itself, the Mango Milk Tea is a must-try item. The flavor reminds me of the Chinese mango pudding. Simply delicious."}, {"review_id": "GbhFS2KdeC3NnguxR59NjA", "user_id": "_5cskuF6D4V9ipUFO6PQKQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "First off, this place is CASH ONLY! I came here while I was in town for a conference. A large group of us decided to come here for lunch which essentially meant 2/3 of the restaurant was our group. I really appreciated the fact that they were able to accommodate us. We made it a point to come before the rush and everyone was seated. The service wasn't bad either considering we all needed separate checks. I got the braised beef noodles. It has a little spicy indicator on the menu but when I got it the spice was like a 2.5 on a scale of 5. The soup itself was very hearty. I took half of my order to go because I had several more socials to go for the remainder of that day. When I ate my leftovers that night, it was still delicious. If you do take their food home, try boiling it rather than microwaving. The flavors really come out when it's super hot. Overall, I'd recommend this place especially for folks who are near the convention center."}, {"review_id": "be4vEarrht6Z3Io59__8nQ", "user_id": "L4kz1TTt96Q_-zPSZnLMvQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "They have a new restaurant now and compare to the old shaggy place, much cleaner~  however i do miss waiting for a seat at the cramped old place.

I've had lots of noodles such as udon, ramen, flat, vermicelli, and egg noodles etc. but it really doesn't compare to FRESH hand drawn noodles. I've had a lot of good noodles, but these are delicious! We ordered the spicy beef noodle soup and it was super flavorful and wasn't too spicy either. The broth wasn't overpowering and too flavorful which meant it went down easily and I was able to enjoy the whole bowl without getting too full. The meat was so soft and complimented the noodles and broth very well! This is one of the best kinds of noodle soup.I'm Cantonese and there's lots of good noodle soups like wonton noodle soup, but this famous Mandarin style noodle soup is my favorite over any Cantonese noodle soup! We also got a non noodle dish, Ma-Po Tofu, which is basically spicy tofu dish with a side of rice. It wasn't terrible, but it's a very common dish that I've had many times before and wasn't anything special.If you're looking for a good soup noodle spot, I'd highly recommend this spot! Noodles are fresh and the broth is super refreshing and flavorful. You'll know what fresh noodles taste like after this experience and you'll def. have something to say the next time you eat noodles somewhere else and realize the noodles aren't fresh.

Did I go to a completely different restaurant than every other reviewer? I'd heard such great things about Nan Zhou Hand Drawn Noodle House. It was one of the first restaurants recommended to me when I first moved to Philly. It's one of the most popular restaurants in Chinatown. I ordered the beef brisket noodle soup and the fresh seafood stir fried noodles to share. On first glance, they both looked and smelled delicious. The soup was steaming hot while the stir fried noodles had an abundance of seafood. But that was about it. The stir fried noodles were too greasy for my taste and mushy as if they had been overcooked. We couldn't finish the portion. I didn't even bother to take the leftovers home in a container. The beef noodle soup was a little better. The noodles had more of a bite to them, but I wish the broth had more flavor. Compared to the other noodle soups I've had, it definitely lacked some spice. Overall, I wouldn't come back to Nan Zhou Hand Drawn Noodle House. There are better places to get a bowl of noodle soup in Chinatown (like Spice C)."}, {"review_id": "ocQgrChJb0asp22N4Nqnlw", "user_id": "q0lUbJVySHzBJGvCvoqr3Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "CASH ONLY.There's something inexplicably great about a warm broth and sliced meat with noodles on a cold winter evening. Nan Zhou's just the perfect place for it. Came here for dinner after being on the train all day. Been recommended this place a lot. It's also always a great sign when most of the patrons are the same ethnicity as the staff.I started off with the scallion pancake and spicy pig ears. The pancake was great, although nothing particularly great, but the spicy pig ears is probably one of the most delicious things I've eaten in a while. Cut thin and served cold, the dish is very flavorful and is decently spicy.The braised sliced beef noodle soup was a little lackluster honestly. Advertised as spicy, the broth wasn't really spicy at all, and wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would have been. The noodles were slightly mushy, not sure if they're supposed to be that way, but I didn't really mind that. What did brother me though was that there were just 3 small slices of the braised beef which was annoying.All in all, this place is great and I'd definitely come again in the future, if not just for the spicy pig ears."}, {"review_id": "UtUZYdVDzSLeMK78kQ2QpA", "user_id": "EvtkSNaB7s0KWT9jjgZbLQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Wow, I've tasted hand-drawn noodles before homemade and I thought that was good.

The soup had an abundance of noodles and I was very satisfied after devouring the delicious and flavorful soup. The dumplings had a freshly made dough surrounding the juicy filling.

We sat down and looked at the menu for a bit ( so many options!) Before deciding. For appetizers we go the scallion pancake and the steamed pork/chive dumplings. Omggg scallion pancakes were prob the best I have ever had ! Especially paired well with the dipping sauce. The pork and chive dumplings we're juicy and flavorful. We gobbled them up before getting our noodles.I opted with the hand drawn noodles in my roasted duck noodle soup. The broth need a touch more sauce/seasoning but the noodles had a delectable texture to them. The duck was very good but I wish there was more than 4 pieces. My mother in law got the chicken noodle soup and the chicken was tasteless which was pretty disappointing. My husband got the beef noodle stir fry which is pro the best entree of the night. Very well seasoned, tender pieces of beef tossed in the noodles with veggies. Yum. My dad got the seafood stir fry that was also pretty good. Overall the food quality is pretty tasty. Idk if I would get my meal again but would def.
