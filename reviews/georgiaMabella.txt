The steak is cooked so perfectly that it melts in your mouth. The drinks are awesome, and the coconut cake was out of this world. Our server, Josh, was outstanding. Very attentive and ensured that we had a great experience. Obviously higher end, so the pricing is more than you'd find going somewhere casual, but it's worth every penny.

The food wasn't terrible by any means but it just lackluster. The biggest thing though was our strange server. He was really pushy about us ordering more and we were already ordering an app, two entrees and a bottle of wine. He also made an odd comment about my wine selection, I of course just shrugged it off, but I'm originally from wine country and although we are primarily craft beer drinkers, every once in awhile you just want a good full-bodied red with some Italian food.

We had reservations and were seated quickly, however we were seated in the middle of the resturabt on display at the piano. Our server, though meaning well, talked entirely too much! I have no recollection of what the specials or recommendations were due to him being long winded. After taking our drink orders 15 minutes later after his speech, we had to request bread about 4 times, the soup he recommended was not very good and I have a bit allergy and requested no nuts in my salad and was brought a salad drenched in nuts! The one upside was my steak, which I must say was cooked perfectly and was quite tasty. This is the saving grace for this review and prevented the 2 stars. I don't know that I would recommend this restaurant, there are several other restaurants in Columbus that I would try before returning here"}, {"review_id": "VvfWKAOLScUoXD4tWp-B8A", "user_id": "5WmMpLe5JMAUKQZSAnLHdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/13/2017", "text": "This is quite possibly one of the best restaurants in Columbus.

Quality! Quality!From the appetizer, to the mains, to the desserts, Mabella's exudes quality in not only their provisions, but also in their employees. After being absent from the restaurant scene in Columbus for a year, it was refreshing to be served big city dishes in a town devoid of true culinary goodness for so long. Our appetizer was a prosciutto wrapped date in clover honey. The prosciutto infusion with the date was a marriage I had not seen before, but was properly executed by the chef. I did not taste the date itself but did experience the textures of both. The dish was ingenious. Our main courses were the Salmon & the NY Strip (aka MB Steak & Frites). The salmon was cooked to perfection and laid on a bed of sautéed spinach, paired with perfectly executed baby carrots, garnished with a slice of orange complimenting the dish. The sauce on the succulent salmon was very well complimented and the flakes on the filets were very thick - true perfection. The steak was covered in a delectable gorgonzola & sun-dried tomato butter paired with walnuts and served medium, as desired. I opted out of the fresh cut garlic fries for a salt-crusted baked potato and a side of grilled asparagus, served separately from the steak. The dessert special of the evening was an apple and brandy-filled crepe sprinkled with powdered sugar and topped with a scoop of rich vanilla ice cream. The crepes arrived as they were ready as to not allow time for them to soften too much. There were other crepes available, but this one sounded the most appealing. Mabella's Italian Steakhouse should not be confused with the other chain Italian steakhouse in north Columbus with their never-changing menu. Mabella's is way better than a chain restaurant in that their menu changes often, as expected from a high-end restaurant. I am now looking forward to my return to Columbus to enjoy our next visit to Mabella's when I have my extended family."}, {"review_id": "nLgQl9TsuLElUMDreR4U_A", "user_id": "_KxfD_TQHFrwxMMOw4PTdg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "Great service ,atmosphere and the food was excellent .

Show up the day of early, with a party of 5, to a restaurant half empty. Was told we couldn't be seated yet. So we went to the bar and ordered drinks, stretched out over 10 feet down the bar so no one could really talk. We watched tables right behind us remain empty for 45 before being sat at the one right behind us. So stupid. Now, the food. I have no problem paying good money for good food, and some of the food here is good. The problem is that a lot of it has that quintessential high-end food problem: it's just a bunch of butter and salt. It's just too pricey for what you get. And you get a LOT of food. To some, that's a plus I guess, but I don't want to purchase 2 servings of food in one entree and have to carry it around with me the rest of the night, or send it back and waste it. Also, NO DRAFT BEER. Our server was very good, it was the one silver lining really.
