We made it to DeSano after having multiple expensive dinners at local hotspots, but we wanted to give the fast casual scene a try. DeSano did not disappoint.Our party of four shared a large pizza and it was delicious. They have tons of seating on long picnic tables indoors, and you can even choose to sit right by the kitchen and watch as your pizza is prepared right before your eyes. You can even bring your own wine, which is awesome (I do believe they have a small corkage fee). When we dined at DeSano we saw every type of diner - from families with young children, to date nights, to a big group of friends sharing a pizza - DeSano seems to appeal to everyone.This location also has onsite parking and a clean and inviting atmosphere. The prices were reasonable and the food was delicious. I would highly recommend this pizza joint!"}, {"review_id": "F3MCsQH4jP6nIHurRO5Nig", "user_id": "Kho08pWNfeGnRbZTnMKy3w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "The hour was 10 pm. The day was Saturday. The feeling was hunger. DeSano Pizza was the answer! Anyone who knows me knows that I am a connoisseur of all things cheesy (food and jokes) so DeSano fits right in with this love. I had previously picked up a pizza to-go and been happy with it and this was my first time dining in. DeSano serves up authentic Neapolitan pizza in a casual setting in the Music Row area of Nashville. They have a parking lot (can I get an amen?!) and the interior is quite spacious with long wooden tables and benches. The large menu is displayed in the lobby area near the entrance and you order from a cashier before having a seat. They bring the pizza right to you once it is ready. Our cashier was honestly high as a kite which didn't bother us really but as far as professionalism goes, not the best (hence, minus one star from my otherwise glowing review). The San Gennaro rocks my socks....the combination of the sausage, caramelized onions, buffalo mozzarella and peppadews (brand of small sweet red peppers) is a marrying of all the best flavors on one pizza. The wood-fired crust is delicious and completes this perfect pizza. My boyfriend and I finished a whole pizza by ourselves!The food is great, the atmosphere is fun/casual and this place would be good any time of day. I'd come back in a heartbeat and this would be a fun place to come as a group since you can bring wine to share with no corkage fee. You will not regret indulging in this delicious pizza!"}, {"review_id": "h1sXLz4VogwCOTTub70j4A", "user_id": "apOS1A1JzN4yfU-ulZ5-WA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "Best pizza in Nashville period. It's incredible quality pizza plus has a great environment.

Went right as they opened for an early lunch, placed my order and grabbed a seat in the open dining/kitchen area. From order to table it took maybe ten minutes for our pizza to arrive. Fresh, piping hot from the oven and delicious! Not only is the style truly authentic Italian, but they import all of their ingredients from Italy! I'll definitely be returning."}, {"review_id": "GIaLoZKrLpw0mqEwbQfRQA", "user_id": "nsRQK-pXmA5W7f0H0sOiWw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Ok, this pains me to write. We checked Yelp for this place and it had great reviews.  I will get the easy part over first - the food is good. Thank you. Now the hard part.  Our service was horrible.  We sat at the bar. It took 15 minutes to get a beer.  We ordered a pizza and they charged my credit card for the beer and the pizza when I ordered. Odd. Because I am an optimistic person, I tipped 20%, my normal. An hour later we still do not have our pie.  People that came in after us got their food.  When we asked about our order we were told the kitchen was backed up - doesn't make sense when people coming in after us got their food.We did order a couple more beers (for our hour wait) for which I tipped zero. I hate to do that but combined with my earlier 20% tip the bar staff is still at 15%.  Way more than was warranted.And another small aggravation was neither of my credit card receipts were itemized . Thankfully I pay attention to prices so they were correct but they should give you an itemized receipt."}, {"review_id": "Twk3275anLZB5nlAaVj6uQ", "user_id": "2hCxkioZCYpN0cUi4-SNnw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "This is, hands down, my favorite place to dine in Nashville--except maybe Etch, but when I don't have $$$ to blow on a dinner, this is always my go-to. Watch the experts prepare your pizza dish in one of three brick ovens and let your mouth water in anticipation of the authentic Italian pizza feast to come. The prices are high, especially compared to some other pizza spots, but the quality is so good that you truly get what you pay for. If sitting in their awesome picnic-style long tables isn't your jam, try their carry out options and take your pie home to feast in private. Either way, if you crave high-quality pizza with high-quality ingredients, give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "6UmlIVuUOu7-1e1PkyWleA", "user_id": "li0pyqpeOuuxo5gJzvmi1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Went off hours and the staff was very friendly and the pizza came out quickly.Pizza was cooked perfectly and was delicious"}, {"review_id": "ydvOg5LqRGNuVAXrn_1fkw", "user_id": "bsmhU-UWPWx2WS2a-tRyvw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "Great pizza restaurant. The service is slow but overall the restaurant is awesome. It is great for large groups, and the pizza is awesome. I always get the Margherita D.O.P and it doesn't disappoint. The atmosphere is great and honestly, I would come here if I had a large group of people but not if I was with just one other. The pizza is kind of pricey but I'm comparing that to the chain delivery pizza that we're all familiar with. For a better quality pizza it's worth it.

Once you walk in, it's still not that inviting. BUT...You order one of their hand made, wood fired pizzas and the taste wins the day!I chose the Margarita Pizza. It was light, the sauce was delicious, the cheese could have been home made. And it was topped with fresh basil. I only intended on eating one or two of the slices. Nope. Ate the entire 11 inch pie.

And am directing the documentary based on the three famous pizza restaurants in New Haven. That said, when on the road I'm always open to try what is considered the best pizzas in town. Two names kept coming up for Nashville, Five Points and DeSanos.This review is solely about the pizza. A nice simple traditional pie or a margarita. If that's the closest they offer. We're not going to talk about the hideous communal seating which could possibly keep me away from one of the New Haven Holy Trinity (ok, not really, but it didn't help here).Strictly talking pizza, DeSanos borders on the inedible. When I say it was raw, I'm including a photo to prove the crust was not even cooked through in the middle. The sauce was bland. The cheese uninspiring. And though we only shared two pies between three people. Many slices were left and none of them came home with us.Tasteless. Uncooked. What more do I need to say. This is so not pizza.

The restaurant is kid friendly, we saw one family had dough for the kids to make their own pizza. I got the lasagna pizza, it tasted so good! Across the table we had cheese, pepperoni, and a calzone. All came out perfect. The crust was fluffy. The restaurant was clean, and they had parking which is sometimes a problem downtown. Definitely recommend and will be back."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/desano-pizza-bakery-nashville?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
