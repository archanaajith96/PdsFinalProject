The rest of our table shared a similar sentiment that their food was just lacking in flavor and seasoning, even basic salt and pepper. Two orders of the Parma Hash, a Chili Chorizo, turkey gravy and biscuits, and a Belgian waffle. Even the coffee is lacking in flavor. The Belgian waffle was the standout dish.The front of house staff definitely make up for the back of house lack of taste. Our server was great and came by to fill drinks frequently.They advertise fresh ingredients, and I'm not doubting that, but I think they stopped short of seasoning.Overall we wouldn't come back which is an unfortunate outcome given our high expectations."}, {"review_id": "JQPEwjanMLDKCCC0tIc-jA", "user_id": "FvXY-tzPWmn2XB-ZIs3Vuw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "So far I have only tried the teas and I am a fan. There is an extensive variety of caffeinated and decaf tea. If you plan to drink it there/inside, the tea dispenser is amazing and super convenient! It comes with a timer and it's easy to use.The workers/baristas are very knowledgeable and friendly. It was my first time and they were all so helpful, providing insight on what I may or may not enjoy. They take the time to get to know you and will eventually know what your \"regular\" is.All of their sweet treats are locally provided by Sarah's Bakery up on South Hills. One of their most popular/best sellers are the cookies - coconut/macadamia? But you can't go wrong; the sweets are great!I plan to come back and try their coffee/espresso drinks soon!"}, {"review_id": "7LWzLwuZ232fWvjLe4e7Jg", "user_id": "VveT5adRuu4s6FTmZZQ73g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/26/2016", "text": "Classic one stop coffee.  Limited coffee options to just the basics: latte, cappucino, americano, tea, and espresso.   Of course coffee and three bakery items.Eat well, tip well."}, {"review_id": "POcJtZMgro_gGTSGsVw8qg", "user_id": "XdPruuq71QqTWNuVhXm54w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "After having high expectations from the previous reviews, my sister and husband excitedly entered and ordered our usual: a latté for me, an almond milk chai tea latte for my husband and then something sweet for my sister. Within the first sip, my tongue was toast. It was awful. I don't think I have been so let down by a latté. After my scorched tongue had stopped hurting, I tried to enjoy the rest of the latté. It had no taste by then, and I'm pretty sure it wasn't because of my tongue. It was confirmed by my husband.

My first visit I got an espresso and a cortado (I like making sure the espresso tastes good before I bother with milk based drinks). The espresso was extracted very well, very juicy and fruit forward and the espresso also held up well to the milk in my cortado as well. I normally drink through a coffee menu on subsequent visits but didn't get to as intended bc I kind of got obsessed about their Double Down specialty drink (espresso plus espresso flavored syrup and milk). So good that I ordered that drink 5 times in 3 straight days. Moxxee partners with Commonplace, a coffee roaster out of Pittsburgh which supplies the delicious beans here. The only reason I didn't give this fine little shop 5 stars is because although I experienced friendly service every visit, the coffee shop opened up late every day I visited (and I tempted fate getting to work on time every day bc I wanted good coffee so bad!). I have a feeling there's not many places in town that serve coffee this good because in most major cities I've been to, there is just no way people would have the patience to just hang out and wait around for a shop to open past its posted hours like several customers did here. Aside from that inconvenience for early worker bees, well done.

Awesome place, albeit small, and seldom a place to sit due to customers who spend inordinate amounts of time occupying tables with their laptops. However the Java is great. My favorite is the \" double-down\": a latte with espresso-infused milk and quite possibly some sort of addictive agent added.  My only suggestion would be to have several sizes available.  However, the owner once told me the standard dose is 10 oz and they take pride in their product. I guess I'm just a junkie who needs a bigger fix..."}, {"review_id": "PnQRB26xGMad__GXzxb9Mw", "user_id": "tCIjV93ETaygK1w0ouQVtQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/30/2016", "text": "Coffee is great, customer service could be better. Speaking from some experience as a barista myself, they've messed my drink up several times (gave me regular milk instead of soy, I'm lactose intolerant) and I've had the barista actually argue with me that the drink was correct or that I didn't specify soy. I've been here a ton since I work at the hospital nearby but have gotten the same poor service time and time again.

Also I should have gotten tea here because I am a bit of a tea snob but I was in the mood for coffee.First of all, this place is really cool. It's trendy, it looks trendy, there are trendy people here. They have so many options I didn't know where to start so I just asked to girl for a dark roast coffee. They make it all fresh of course and I could see they had little French presses (or whatever those are called) and I've read other reviews stating that they have top-of-the-line equipment. Anyhow I ordered a chocolate covered macaroon and a medium dark roast coffee. My total was $5.50. Macaroon $2.60, Brazil Sao Francisco coffee $2.90. I don't know if they really even have sizes... I don't think these prices are awful as you get a good sized mug of coffee and the macaroon was delicious. They have electric kettles, ceramic and cast iron tea kettles for sale as well as mugs and individual packets of loose leaf tea. All the tea is loose leaf, and I spied on some other people who had ordered some. It was served on a tray with a clear glass mug, a tea steeper (the kind you can get from Teavana that you sit on top of the cup and it strains the tea into your cup), and what looked to be a timer. Awesome!The place was pretty busy but most of the people had already been served and were at the various tables and bars. It's small inside but wasn't too cramped. There were mostly younger college kids which I liked.Well I'm finishing my coffee and as I said I don't know much about it but it was strong and tasty and I'm noticing a lot of dark settling in the bottom. I'll let you coffee people decide what this means.I give this place 5 stars, possibly because I Don't know any better but mostly because I am now in love with it. The atmosphere is great and I like the coffee and treats so far! I plan to explore their coffee further and hang out here more often!"}, {"review_id": "5n0SWVAqjv3DfJJpJXlazA", "user_id": "jSx1vqF8cRZ62MLXPTNb6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/16/2016", "text": "We stopped by while traveling through Charleston.

Options were Kenya, El Salvador, and Ethiopia. I asked for the lightest roast. One of the three most flavorful cups of coffee I've had. Ethiopia Yirgacheffe.
