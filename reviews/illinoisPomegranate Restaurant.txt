Yesterday I decided to give them a try and order take out breakfast. I called my order in and was told it would be 15 min. I was in the area so I decided to go in and wait. Lucky for me they have a bar!!! I ordered a bloody and sipped the time away. Must say my bloody was decent and hit the spot. I waited about 15 min and as promised the food was ready. I was impressed with the way my order was packed. I was picking up breakfast for 5. My food was packed neatly and labeled. My food was hot when I arrived home. My order consisted of a kids chocolate chip pancakes which were made in chocolate batter. I wouldn't have known but the guy who answered the phone recommended it. An order of kids French toast sticks that came with blueberries and strawberries. An order of Swedish pancakes. A pomegranate skillet, ham, onions, cheese, green peppers and mushrooms. It came with a side of pancakes or toast. A western skillet, ham red and green peppers, sausage and cheese. I also got 3 sides of bacon and they were very generous with the bacon. We were all satisfied with our meals and I will go back. Guy who took my phone order was very nice and helpful. The guy who made my drink was pleasant and checked on me. A great experience coming back"}, {"review_id": "Rgtugs7mAPG63NulmVdXww", "user_id": "GSgoQusOXsfS88McJFQP0w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "The service at Pomegranate really stands out!  We've only been here three times,  but each time the owner and wait staff have gone above and beyond.  On our first visit, the owner bought us an appetizer just to welcome us to the restaurant.  Our last visit, the waitress bought us dessert to celebrate our soon to be born daughter.  I never expect hand outs, but it really makes this place shine to see such hospitality!The food is really good, too.  There's something for everyone, with typical family restaurant fare along with a selection of Greek dishes.  My husband loves the souvlaki.  We enjoyed the saganaki, too.  The friday fish selections are good; fried fish was cooked just right and portioned well.Pomegranate is a great alternative to the sea of chain restaurants by the Fox Valley Mall."}, {"review_id": "W0td7HJvTnsaGr1hPUBoSA", "user_id": "8q7xPmUI05LI-xQN8DLOww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "I have a job where I am travelling almost constantly, and one of my go-to's whenever I'm at a new restaurant that has it is french onion soup. Well, on five continents I've not found an equal to the french onion soup served at Pomegranate Restaurant. It's really sort of absurd how good it is, to an extent that you find yourself wondering if they made some sort of Monkey's Paw wish and what terrible consequence the chef is currently facing to be able to serve such unbelievable soup.Everything else I've had here is great too, from sandwiches for lunch to skillets for breakfast, everything has exceeded my expectations. And, hey, if you're into slot machines, for whatever reason right next door there's a gaming salon. I'm sure this makes sense to someone, or, maybe that's the Monkey's Paw striking back, who knows.Also, service here is so good it's borderline annoying at times. It's one of the few restaurants I've been to where we've had to straight up tell our server, \"We're fine, I promise, if we need something we'll flag you down.\" This is totally a hidden gem of Aurora, nestled behind the Fox Valley mall, everyone I take here had no idea it even existed."}, {"review_id": "CL4rXqzHse0txx-JhLHFrQ", "user_id": "QRFvkXz7-6j4-HG7jzrnow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "The place was quite busy, but we were seated in a timely manner.

We only had a little over an hour to grab brunch before heading to church, so we wanted to go somewhere nearby. It was also a beautiful fall day out, so we remembered that Pomegranate had a patio!Our wait on a Sunday was only about 5 minutes. The restaurant itself was pretty packed, but there were only a couple groups sitting outside. Our waitress was very sweet and funny and humored my husband with his fantasy football banter.I ordered the Down Under ($8.99) which included two poached eggs on country biscuits with sausage patties and country sausage gravy, plus a side of hash browns. The eggs, biscuits, gravy, and sausage combo was absolutely delicious. The hash browns weren't my favorite as I prefer mine crispier and thinner, and these were more like soft diced potatoes.My husband ordered the Crow's Nest (also $8.99) which came with two poached eggs, English muffin halves with corned beef hash, and topped with hollandaise sauce. He seemed to enjoy his meal as well. Since I can never decide between savory or sweet at the breakfast hour, we got a side of two pancakes to split for good measure, and two coffees rounded out our meals nicely. Service was quick despite how busy they were and we left stuffed. We both took home half of our meals, but you best believe we devoured those pancakes!I think we'll definitely keep Pomegranate in our local brunch rotation... there are so many other things on the menu I'd like to try. Plus they have a nice little bar area I can see us hanging out at as well."}, {"review_id": "JacUMbnCMyUNzKD_5NHcwQ", "user_id": "B9FpbRp4rgldjAw2BwLGcg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "Hidden location behind the mall and just off of Ogden.Worth finding!Great selection of food.Pork chops were very flavorful.Omelette was great.Potato  pancakes very delicious.Good coffeeFriendly efficient server.Great for large groups on sunday.

I like to come here when the weather get's nicer to enjoy brunch out on the patio with my nieces because they love the pancakes here. I'm more of an eggs benedict kind of person and they do that pretty well here too.This is pretty much a classic American diner with enough variety for everyone to choose from. Although the food is average and doesn't excel in any aspect, the service is quite good. The waiters are friendly, attentive, and are always looking to come around to refill your water or coffee.

Restaurant was full of customers, and we were greeted promptly and taken to a booth within a few minutes. I was pleased with the cleanliness of the restaurant. Waitress was friendly, took our order, and brought our beverages and food in a reasonable amount of time. Everything was satisfactory... except my food.I ordered the Turkey Club Sandwich. The turkey was ok (average thickness / thicker than deli slices but thinner than Thanksgiving slices) but that's where it ended. There was waaay too much tomato, and the bacon seemingly had been cooked then refrigerated so it was cold and limp (not crisp). I only ate two of the four sandwich sections. Really wasn't a good experience. Plus, they serve crinkle-cut french fries which I personally dislike because they are never cooked thru thoroughly. I didn't care for the lemonade I ordered, but I can't remember why, lol. My neighbor ordered breakfast and she seemed to be happy with her food.My thoughts... there is lots to order on the menu, but it is predominantly breakfast items, and minimal lunch items. So it became obvious that breakfast is their specialty, and maybe they put less effort into lunch items. With this in mind, I will definitely go back and try some breakfast. Hopefully it will be a better outcome."}, {"review_id": "pGXEVhDJdCIzzxGgDfj56w", "user_id": "Wpd-oKyQCFvcNMKck2V8fg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "I used to like this place but I noticed that the owner is very mean to his employees.  One time was particularly bad when he really berated a busboy who actually had greeted me originally and showed me to a booth.  The owner was berating him about something right in front of everyone there.  Yet the waitress I had was really rude to me   Never came by to check on me.  I had to ask a different waitress for a box.  Instead of getting me a box herself she went all the way over to my original waitress (who was chatting away with a coworker) to get me the box.  She brought it to me but it was too small    She rudely said \"she said you asked for a small box\"---like it was my fault.  Rude!   I also discovered they do not make you food to order.  Once on a take out order I asked for crispy hash browns.  My order came with very very minimal hash browns.  So, what they did was just pick out the crispy ones fromWhat must be a huge vat of hash browns sitting there all day.  That was my last order from this place."}, {"review_id": "sMGUmxXwqb0o8J-cKF515w", "user_id": "MNOZkCxQJGnyrRMgKDiNUQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "We came here for brunch on a Saturday and had made reservations prior.

I got a panini sandwich and it was really good! I loved how the menu had healthy options and alternatives. The menu is a bit large but everyone in our party enjoyed the food. We'd go back! I give it 4 stars because it's not a \"write back to home\" place but had good food, good service and a good atmosphere! Typical family restaurant with a step-up on service! One thing I would change would be to take the pies/cakes out of the containers in the front case when you walk in.
