Another wonderful meal. We started with the Grill Spanish Octopus. Highly recommended, as tender as it can possibly be, served over a potato lasagna with a roasted tomato ragout. Truly outstanding!I then had their Creole Spiced Shrimp and Catfish Gumbo. It came with Andouille sausage, grits, the obligatory trinity of veggies, collard greens and a wonderful dark roux. The catfish and shrimp were wonderful, as well as the grits, but I'm still wondering how they made the andouille so tender.My wife enjoyed the seared Trout Almondine, with capers, almonds, in a white wine sauce. The fish was moist and very well spiced. The trout was served with asparagus and farro. I never tried the farro, but the asparagus belongs in the vegetable hall of fame!. Service was excellent, efficient without being bothersome - just as you would expect at a high end eatery."}, {"review_id": "HCzjGKNNgJYN3MZ7mzmkYw", "user_id": "12Cd6TiyLHOXNP7iZ_t5kg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "The atmosphere of this place is perfect for a fancier lunch (every time I've been there, it is mostly professionals having lunch). I've gotten a few menu items--both sandwiches and salads. There is a wide variety of dishes to choose from, which means that there is something for everyone.The salads are plenty big for a lunch, and far from bland. The salads usually have a lot of toppings, too. The salads are somewhat pricey for a lunch. The sandwiches are good, but the best part about getting a sandwich is the french fries.  If you plan on going here for lunch, I recommend making a reservation ahead of time."}, {"review_id": "lbsakdRq6ek3ESoYAYDp7w", "user_id": "AoBD8nYknU86SOkFvgYl8A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "I would highly recommend having dinner at La Fia if you are looking for a place to go. I visited Delaware for a business trip this week and had dinner there twice. The atmosphere was really great. It was a bit lively when I first walked in, but still quiet enough to hear the person next to me. The restaurant had a great rustic look, and the bar (where I sat) was a great place to post up. The food was excellent. I had the scallop carbonara on both visits. The scallops were fresh, and apparently all the pasta is made on site. The waiter on Tuesday and the waitress on Thursday suggested awesome wine pairings. All the people who worked there were quite friendly and welcoming, which was a definite plus for an out-of-towner like me. All in all, La Fia was the highlight of what otherwise would have been a typical business trip, and I hope I can go back soon."}, {"review_id": "7nzgdUyecKgyBZjcFuAolw", "user_id": "MpIEZ-ENR3OGu1YKGQXNyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Outstanding.

While the white bean appetizer and soup were very good, with complex flavors and great ingredient pairings, the sandwiches were skimpy and drastically overpriced. Somewhat unhappy with this lunch experience. We ordered to start the white bean hummus appetizer, which was actually very good. The cucumbers helped give a great freshness to the hummus and balanced the saltiness of the toasted bread and feta cheese. The hummus itself was creamy and really flavorful, with plenty of spices to elevate the dish.For the main course, I ordered the butternut squash soup (soup du jour), which was amazing. I would highly recommend it, as my dad tasted a bit and ask for one for himself. Unlike many heavy, creme-based soups, this one tasted very light but bold and flavorful. Atop the soup were what tasted like olive oil and balsamic vinegar, along with dried spices; this gave a healthy richness, rusticness, and earthiness to the soup that is very hard to find at other bistros. My parents ordered the turkey reuben and hot Italian panini. Both sandwiches tasted very oily and heavy, with few fresh ingredients to cut the richness of the provolone and swiss cheese. On the reuben, there was very little (if any) sauerkraut and only a few pieces of turkey. The panini similarly had very little protein, which was very disappointing considering the lofty prices of each $12 sandwich."}, {"review_id": "IT_Mv9xYIA8sdMiV-UowXg", "user_id": "_BcWyKQL16ndpBdggh2kNA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "2 years later - and thank goodness, La Fia is still here and still has my favorite salads and sandwiches ($12 - $20) for lunch.  A good place to take a client or business colleague.  This part of Market Street needs more dining options so we are thankful La Fia is here!"}, {"review_id": "JcsAx3sptd6fzSSsG1lDQg", "user_id": "61FNJUiDqXReViksOYiILQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/22/2017", "text": "I've had the pleasure of dining at La Fia for dinner twice now.  While I'm not close enough to become a regular, I'll happily dine again. La Fia is a clean and well decorated bistro and bakery.  You can start with fancy cocktails and end with delicious desserts. Over my visits, I've gone with groups and had the opportunity to try a variety of dishes.  On the apps, I've had their Beef Tartare and Warm Medjool Dates.  Both \"bites\" come two per order, but could easily be split to share among four if you're willing to take a slightly smaller bite.  The tartare was a nice slice of beef on a potato cake.  It served wonders as a light dish.  The dates were stuffed with blue cheese and felt a bit heavy, but I enjoyed nevertheless.For firsts, I've managed to test the Heirloom Tomato Salad and the Grilled Spanish Octopus.  The tomate salad was fresh and a good portion.  I'd say it was exactly what I expected.  The octopus was pretty amazing.  I'm not going to describe it in detail.  I'll just recommend you make it a point to order it!While I've seen and tasted small portions of a variety of entrees, I can only truly review one.  The Pan Roasted Moulard Duck Breast is another must-order.  The portion was larger than I imagined.  The duck was cooked to just the right point and the lime aioli aided it well.  I was also happy with the bok choy included on the dish as it balanced well.  I'd recommend getting at least a side for the table as well and the mushrooms were on point.I'll end by saying service is solid and their drinks enjoyable.  I don't remember the name of the cocktails I tried, so you'll be on your own there.  No worries, I'm sure you'll enjoy whichever you end up ordering!"}, {"review_id": "SpDtJ0jCXKWiWRnuPabIaw", "user_id": "qEQob9pzNanp9BZbCiUUwQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/7/2017", "text": "La Fia is a cute, quaint spot in Wilmington and worth a try if you are in the area or looking for an alternative in Delaware to larger chain establishments.

Visiting family in town and without hesitation recommended La Fia for dinner on Saturday. Met at our hotel and used their shuttle to the restaurant, so can't speak to parking but appeared that street parking was plentiful. Access to the restaurant is through the \"bistro\" part of their business which I understand is open for breakfast goodies. It's a bit of an odd entrance to what turned out to be an excellent dinner. The dining room is a little brighter than you'd expect both in terms of lighting and noise level so plan accordingly. Our seating for 4 was in one of the window nooks which helped keep the noise down. Large windows showcase the Wilmington nightlife if you're so inclined... a great place on a snowy evening I'd think. There's a small bar at the back that had a handful of seats and it looked that you could dine there as well, might be perfect for single business travelers looking for something better than hotel fare. The menu is set up in a way to suggest that it's the true Italian course style, but we learned from the server that the pasta dishes and entrees are \"full\" sized entrees, so plan accordingly. Our group chose 4 appetizers then one pasta that we all shared between the apps and entrees which worked really nicely. Then four entrees. One of our party has some particular dietary requirements and staff were happy to work with her to find or modify entrees where possible. In her case, avoiding gluten was the trick and there were plenty of options that met that requirement. Grilled Octopus starter for $14 presented as two large tentacles cooked perfectly, nicely tender and grilled. Tomato ragout with a little fennel background and tomatoes. Personal nit - grilled Shisito peppers which seem to be the hot thing. Why? Didn't add anything to the dish but color I guess. First world problems. Great dish, would definitely order again. Pair with another app and you'd have a nice lighter dinner. Others had Seared Fois Gras Mouuse which was also well prepared. Beef tartare was the weakling of the trio, tougher cut of meat was used, flavors were muted and overall meh. I'd skip next time. The pasta stole the show. Hands down. The table chose Bucatini with Smoked Bacon (isn't it all smoked?), truffle purée, fresh rosemary, egg and Pecorino Locatelli Cheese for $24. Ummm. Yes. Please. More. Bathe me in this. The truffle, which can be overpowering was delightfully present without overwhelming. Competing with the rosemary and cheese and the pasta was cooked absolutely perfectly. We all agreed next time - PASTA! And for us, sharing one dish among 3 worked perfectly well. Entrees did an interesting job of trying to feature some local ingredients - it is the Mushroom capital of the Universe by the way. My choice was the roasted rack of lamb, one of the more expensive entrees at $35. The lamb was to be prepared medium rare along with chimichurri, burnt honey, Tabbouleh chicory and greek yogurt with grilled halloumi. Presented as 8 ribs sliced int medallions and was prepared more towards medium than the ordered medium rare. This lamb was lovely and with none of the gamey quality that turns many off from lamb, but it was definitely lamb-y. I thought the salad along with it didn't particularly work and was bitter and not complement the dish. The grilled halloumi, while I get the reference with the lamb (think eastern Mediterranean) also seemed out of place, was overly dry and not particularly pleasant. But I was in it for the lamb. And I'd go back, but perhaps ask to sub a side if they would.Desert was a cheese board with four wonderful cheeses, mixed nuts, poached pears and the like. A bit steeply priced at $22, but for the overall mix not bad. For a group to share when you want dessert but not a big sugar bomb, a good option particularly with folks who are a bit adventurous with their cheeses. Parking - seems easyAmbiance - brighter and casualFood - Approachable yet refinedPrice - You're into a glass of wine, app and entree for $60-$75Return - Yep, I'll go back!"}, {"review_id": "H5u6rSX-uBesgwhHcPjAFQ", "user_id": "Rs75K_Z_kh1I029YAkdoXw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Omg!

All the Yelp reviews promised really good food and the food was indeed AMAZING !We had reservations and we're seated immediately when we go there. The place was very cozy and the decor was really cute (like a bistro!). When we received our restaurant week menus I noticed the menu printed was different than the ones online. I had to adjust want I originally wanted which is totally fine. My friend got a rose wine and I got a white wine from Spain. Both were super delicious. For appetizers my friend got the scallops which was pretty good. It came on this coconut broth (which I wasn't a fan of but went well with the dish). I got the octopus appetizer that came with a meaty tomato sauce, pancetta/bacon, this potato hash and ofcourse grilled octopus. My appetizer was delicious! Good start to the meal.For entrees I got the hanger steak with baby neck clams, potato cake and this other tomato sauce. Steak was grilled and season well, everything else on the dish was delicious...The only downside was the entire dish was at room temp/alittle cold (like it's been sitting out for a bit before coming to our table). Regardless the flavors were all spot on. The cook on the steak was also medium rare..Maybe more on the rare side but that's how I like my steaks anyway ! My friend got the seafood risotto with scallops, mussels and braised veal. Her entree was really good as well with the risotto cooked perfectly. For dessert we were excited to be getting a dessert trio but when the dish was brought out it was alittle disappointing. Three very small desserts on one plate. One was a vanilla wafer with raspberry couis, another some sort of vanilla creme then the chocolate cake. All three were pretty good but I think I would have like one dessert if it was bigger than those three 'desserts' combined (which I'm accustomed to from other restaurant week desserts). Food quality and service was excellent, however I would like more delicious food! I can't wait to take my husband here for a future date night :)"}, {"review_id": "C1nyAe9mQHkq4BgzWb5J9Q", "user_id": "ENZbh_u6v1vT_zTUW3vZGw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/7/2017", "text": "I was very pleased with this restaurant.

Other members of my family got the turkey reuben, house roasted turkey sandwich, Italian \"grinder\", hanger steak salad, and the farro and kale salad.

We attempted twice in one night to give them our money, only because this area, which is akin to the OK Corrall in Tombstone, Arizona, only minus all of the cosmopolitan accoutrement, has only 2 places to eat that are open past 6pm. I'm sure because they don't keep cash in the registers, making it difficult for the residents to make an \"honest wage\". Once we tried to eat dinner. Failed due to the fact that the bartender, who I am sure was up late last night singing karoke at a dive bar, drinking PBR and eating \"tots\", was not very attentive. Secondly, we could not recognize the dishes, as they were all served with garnishes and sides that I could only imagine were inspired by Klingon cuisine. We ate at the only other resuturaunt that wasn't in a shopping center betwix a check cashing place and a liqour store (the area is awful folks, especially if it's warm out). We returned to La \"Fia\" in hopes to maybe have a little coffee and dessert, as the other place did not have any of either (review coming soon). We were met with confusion an almost distain from the server or hostess, or whatever he was. She may not have even worked there. So, we left again.
