Coney Island is easily one of my favorite places to eat as a child and now! Now that I live in Indy, I always look forward to a trip back to enjoy their delicious Coney dogs. I always have to get an old fashioned bottle of Coke with order, too! The wait staff is always very quick whether is be sitting down and ordering your dogs carry out... even during times when the line is outside the door. They also take card now (they used to only accept cash)! A visit to downtown Fort Wayne is not complete without a trip to Coney Island!!"}, {"review_id": "QdM1B7tHGP4u2KEpxMu55g", "user_id": "Vn6UJMyFqHqhqoEXqd9Wlg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "Coney Island is a classic spot in Fort Wayne. They don't serve much, but what do serve is done in a both humble and authentic style. This is not a bougie spot, rather it offers a pretty laid back and ultimately simple space for one to gorge on the famed Coney Dog.The Coney Dog is straightforward: bun, dog, onion, chili, sauce (which I believe is mustard). Not a lot to it. This being said, I love dropping by for a couple dogs when I'm looking for something classic, not classy. Definitely drop by this spot. It has a vibe all it's own, and the dogs are great!"}, {"review_id": "a3-UJwoiWDRAtJShw3xdEg", "user_id": "cqlm3XGNx3zDyDS1UpQEig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2017", "text": "Every Fort Wayne native and their famous (and not-so-famous) guests LOVE Coney Island.  A five star rating for 10 decades; Yes! 100 years.  If you haven't been, what are you waiting for?THE best hot dogs on steamed buns.  THE best service anywhere!"}, {"review_id": "qATgqpJc50AeAkKZu2qbxw", "user_id": "wiBlu3XXBhQ1HO6lpG5tWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "Steamed buns!

I remember coming here all the time in high school and then again after going to college. They serve Cokes in bottles, the chili is perfect, and the dogs are amazing. This place takes me back every time I come here. The one thing is that it's a small place so it can get busy a little crazy. They don't have the best system when it comes to taking orders it can get a little hectic. But it's 100% worth it. They're the best hotdogs in the Midwest. If you're ever in Ft.

Coney Island is a staple to downtown Fort Wayne. They've been serving the sloppiest, most delicious coneys for over a century. Yeah you read that right. I prefer my dogs loaded up with chili sauce, cheese, onions, mustard, and ketchup. The works. There is just something about the onions that go on their hotdogs. So good. Don't forget to order a classic bottled Coca-cola. The taste and bottle will have you in a different era. They also have some other great sides such as their chili and baked beans. Baked chips are available as well. I believe they also sell burgers....but I've never made it past their famous coneys.This place gets busy. Be prepared to be waiting in a line out the door. Try to snag a spot at their counter bar. Tables are also available. Don't count on sitting with all your friends if you come in a large group. The employees do a good job of yelling out when a table is open. Service is good and they remember orders without writing them down like it their job. Atmosphere is in a different era, which I like.

Right in the heart of downtown this locally owned joint is famous to Fort Wayne and can take you back in time.

The staff is fantastic and always takes great care of you. It's entertaining to watch as they deliver stacks of coney dogs to tables. Start off with a bottle of ice cold Coca Cola, it's a must. Then put in your order and in no time the amazing coney dogs will be at your table! You can even add cheese if that's your culprit. Steamed buns, the infamous coney sauce, mustard and onion...you will fall in love! They also offer burgers, chili, baked beans and chips, so there are plenty of options.

If you're a Fort Fun ex-pat like me, you make it a standard to come here on a trip home to see friends and family. Sitting at the counter in the fast-paced diner brings one back to another era. Fort Wayne's downtown is revamping lately, but this landmark has remained consistent and popular through the years.The home-town diner in the heart of the city that serves up pies, bottled cokes, and chili dogs with steamed buns and all the fixins (or none if you so choose) is a long term staple of the mid-sized town, over 100 years strong. The staff of genuine, friendly, quick, and efficient people will make you smile or at the very least make your food.

My bf is from Fort Wayne and we made a stop here while visiting his family. The food was delicious and the vibe was pretty cool. Think super old school! It was definitely a nice change of pace rather than the Chicago lifestyle in which we typically partake. THE ONLY REASON WHY I AM GIVING 3 STARS INSTEAD  OF 5 is due to the experience on this particular visit. Upon walking into the restaurant we noticed several employees huddled around and petting a dog. We thought it was odd but figured it was just a dog friendly restaurant. Well... that wasn't the case... at all! It was a stray dog that was wondering outside of the restaurant. The team felt bad so it brought it in through the front door to give it water and food. Cooks and servers both took their turns of petting the dog and feeding the dog hot dogs from behind the counter. I even witnessed one server give the dog a bowl of water, take the bowl back to throw it away, and only switch out the top layer of gloves (he had on double gloves). He then wiped the remaining pair on his apron which was also rubbing the stray animal, and continued to serve. What made it worse, one of the servers picked up the stray animal and carried it through the restaurant, through the KITCHEN, and out the back door. My stomach was instantly dissatisfied. Not one time did I see any of the employees wash their hands. In short, this review is more for management--- Gotta teach your employees to do better. Especially in such an open serving and cooking environment. Not all customers are into dogs, especially stray dogs! No ones knows where that dog wandered to or what diseases it may have had. To allow it into a place where food is served and through the kitchen was a MAJOR no no. If this were any other place I'd give one star but this place actually made up for some of the stars with the old school vibe and yummy bites.I'd definitely return, I just hope to never see something like that again."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/coney-island-wiener-stand-fort-wayne?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
