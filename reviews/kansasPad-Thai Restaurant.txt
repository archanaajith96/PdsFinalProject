Wishing we hadn't waited so long.  This has got to be one of the top Thai restaurants we have ever been to.  Food was fresh, vegetables were crisp and the food was out of this world delicious!!!"}, {"review_id": "GvgJWvQamrZPkoBvZKql9Q", "user_id": "SLaeSNxDM9k9wU3poFsN-g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Went here for dinner with an old friend. it's a small cozy restaurant with limited seating. So had to wait for about ten minutes to be seated even on a week day. Food was good. Ambience - Great Service was good.Seating limited.Price wasn't very expensive.Vegetable spring roll- more like summer roll. It was just okay. I have had better ones. The peanut sauce was super sweet and not good at allPad Thai with tofu - It was good but spicy. We ordered medium spice level which was really . Order mildly spice if you cannot handle the heat.Basil fried rice - This tasted amazing and we loved it  Perfect spices and very comforting.Fried banana with mango and coconut ice cream - This was super yummy. Both mango and banana ice cream was great. Must try is the coconut one, it was rich and creamy with pieces of actual coconut. We might go back again."}, {"review_id": "PiHT0JNRVSJnxxRQoBTNEw", "user_id": "GTIdraos3JuEd1jj0iEWMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/29/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Updating my review and taking this to 5 stars.

Driving up to the place, I could tell it was a rather small space in a short section of the shopping area. I was wondering what the inside was going to look like.To my pleasure, the space was inviting, as well as the young lady who greeted us. It is a small space, but there was a spot for us, and although not today, I did notice that they had a nice patio dining area, and a cute little bar.The place is nicely decorated. I particularly liked the wicker chairs. They were a different touch and appealing. The table tops had white table cloths topped with a clear sheet of glass. Adorned with an electric candle, I bet the place is a quaint spot for a dinner date.Service was spot on and very friendly. You don't have to worry about catching their attention for something. They'll be at your table before you have the chance to. We started with the soft pork spring rolls. Very good, along with the sweet peanut dipping sauce.Next came the mains, Tom Kha soup and beef noodle soup. The beef noodle was good, but I think they forgot my spice level request. I asked for medium hot, but the chili heat was nonexistent. The broth was so good though, I let it slide. I could do without the meatballs in it. Just give me those slices of sirloin, noodles, and yummy vegetables. The Tom Kha did deliver on the spice level, and the broth was oh so good. The chicken was cooked perfectly as well. You can't go wrong with either soup selection.I wish this place wasn't so far away, or I'd be a frequent patron. Our friend may get some more visits. Just don't tell him that it's because of Pad Thai Restaurant!"}, {"review_id": "Yjc1skC_D8uPZruFR8AsaQ", "user_id": "28SSFerOBvK0Skc7fwifxw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "This is a local owned gem!!

The charm is due to their stellar food and service, as well as the charming decor, and the chuckle is due to the somewhat obvious, somewhat generic name. Don't get me wrong: I'm not knocking the nomenclature; after all, Very Hungry Husband and I once ate a fair-to-middling take away Chinese dinner from a restaurant in the South simply called 'China'. That one was worth a big chuckle.But what's in a name when it comes to food anyway? Not all that much if the food is as good as it consistently is at Pad Thai Restaurant.Some highlights:The appetizer sampler is wonderful and an excellent starter for 2-4 people. The crab rangoon is fantastic - very light and never greasy.  The fresh Thai basil spring rolls and crispy spring rolls are also very good and the chicken satay is outstanding. Accompanying sauces are excellent - some of the best I've had. If you enjoy face melting spiciness, you can also request the spicy condiments, which include one of my favorites: fish sauce with tiny hot Thai chili peppers. The Tiger Cry Beef is so amazing that you really might cry while eating it. Very tender and seasoned perfectly with just enough char-roasted flavor. The accompanying sauce is also great and just mildly spicy.The noodle dishes we've tried are all consistently good and well prepared. We've had the Lad Na noodles and Pad See Ew.  Very good pad thai, as well (probably a good thing considering the words 'Pad Thai' are leading the way in the restaurant's name.)Other standouts include: Pad Cashew, Tamarind Chicken and Royal Thai Chicken. The last dish is a wonderful, flavorful, mild dish made by soaking the chicken in rum and then cooking it with mushrooms and onion in a light garlic sauce. This is a tiny little joint tucked away in a strip mall type area. But they have made the most of the space with clean, modern, Thai-inspired decor.The service really pushes this little gem into the 5 star realm though. Tiny places can get a cramped and rude atmosphere very quickly when crowded but the staff at Pad Thai Restaurant has always been positive, polite, accommodating, calming and armed with good drinks and eats recommendations so that any wait time is quickly forgotten. You can also call ahead and make reservations."}, {"review_id": "_6ZRp8cs5pbvu9ehcy1IhA", "user_id": "I3zCWPkrR7QnYd3ho8979Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "I love Pad-Thai Restaurant!

All of the curry dishes, the spicy dishes, shrimp, seafood, rice dishes, and of course noodles. Some of my favorites are the Tiger Cry beef, the pad gapow, ginger shrimp, pad ginger with shrimp, and the Tom Kha soup - which is really fun to order at dinner as it comes out with flames.

It is a little out of the way for me to come here, but sometimes we're out here anyway for one reason or another. The first time I came here, I tried the Pad Thai with chicken because it's my go-to, and the restaurant is named after this popular dish. Oh boy, it was the sweetest pad thai I've ever had. I don't know if there's anyone out there who actually likes really sweet pad thai, but I know I don't. When it comes to my noodles, I will generally prefer savory over sweet.My other go-to are the Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mow), which is what I have been getting on my last couple visits. The Pad See Ew and Pad Lah Nah are both just okay by my standards - I've had better. My fiancé loves Crab Fried Rice, but most Thai places skimp out on the crab meat to save money, and Pad-Thai is no different. We've also had the Summer Rolls and Mini Pork Ribs. The Summer Rolls aren't bad, but you can tell they are pre-made and just sit in the fridge until someone orders them. I guess it makes it more convenient, but it causes problems with the texture of the rice paper - usually dry on top and soggy on the bottom where it's been resting on the plate.The Mini Pork Ribs have little meat on them, but aren't too bad. Though I would argue that even mediocre things can taste better when they're fried, which may be the case here. The \"fried-ness\" of it probably made it seem more tasty than it actually is. The service here is usually below average. They usually ignore us for the most part or try to get us out as fast as possible, so they can get other people waiting seated. It makes me feel unwelcome when I'm ushered out, just so they can have a faster turnaround. It happens no matter how many people there are - whether it's 2 or 6. I think I'm done with going to Pad-Thai, as I feel that there's not really anything to keep me going back, other than convenience when I'm in the area. I suggest you go elsewhere if you can.Overall: 2/5Food: 2.5/5Service: 1/5Atmosphere: 1/5"}, {"review_id": "6pwizYettWHt1z2z3b77jA", "user_id": "dz7NW7d-t2lEOhoDG70InQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "This place used to be so good. It really was a little hidden gem tucked around the corner from Tanner's. But there's a reason why I'm using the past tense: it was well below average the last few times I went. For one, the fried rice. Imagine throwing stale rice in a pan, lazily adding chewy pieces of chicken, plus a couple of spoonfuls of soy sauce. Now imagine taking $13 out of your wallet and lighting it on fire. That's what eating the Pad Thai fried rice is like, only worse. At least if you burned your cash, you would get some smokey flavor, which is decidedly absent from this restaurant's simplest dish. And then we have the crispy garlic shrimp, which was not really any of those things (crispy, garlicky and shrimp-y). Instead, what you're given is a gloppy pile of breading on unremarkably small shrimp. What it lacks in texture is matched only by what it lacks in flavor and value ($20). The only thing saving this from a 1 star review is knowing what Pad Thai once was and could be. My hope is that my last few experiences are anomalies."}, {"review_id": "F5rKSbu-4WayCDdPGuyu2g", "user_id": "2m_9Ftu2-jv-tFPKzW0Y7A", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/7/2017", "text": "I'm Thai and I feel very disappointed in this place. My search for the Best Authentic Thai Restaurant continues...and this is why I cook Thai food at home. Which is the best thing for you anyway Papaya Salad = zero 's It's embarrassing to Thai's, not only was it diabetic sweet, it's not at all close to being authentic by adding what looks like Sweet Thai BBQ chicken chili sauce to make the papaya sauce. The sauce shouldn't even be red. Papaya salad sauce should have fish sauce, fresh lime juice, sugar, fresh chili peppers, chopped garlic. Papaya salad is suppose have a great balance of tart, sweet and spicy and delicious . Unless you want Sweet Thai Chili BBQ Chicken Chili Sauce Papaya Salad go elsewhere. Side note: for more authentic papaya salad go to Bangkok Pavilion on metcalf or Hot Basil. Phad Thai = 3 'sPhad Thai is suppose to be sweet yes, but this again was overly shockingly sweet. And Phad Thai usually comes with some lime which this place didn't. We had to ask. Adding lots of lime made it so much better. Phad Kee Mao = 3 'sPhad Kee Mao wasn't bad nor awesome. Not sure if I would order it again. Panang Crispy Duck = 3.5 'sThe duck was delicious and crispy. The sauce is suppose to be sweet but was a little to sweet for me which adding a little fish sauce helped. I would order this dish again because I liked the peanutty and creamy sauce and I would just add a little fish sauce to tone the sweetness a little. Mango and Sticky Rice = 3.8 'sI love mango, can't go wrong there. But the coconut sauce had a funny not fresh taste."}, {"review_id": "AN5fWSCx7OacKxOBcpMidw", "user_id": "_TRqo9qT5pwJLFNYzos0EA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "I never give five stars on a first visit but this experience was nothing less than amazing.  It was Valentine's Day so of course very busy.

Our servers were all so nice and for it being so crowded and so crazy they were really on point! The owner came around and spoke to everyone and it was fantastic. We started with the tiger cry beef and papaya salad--some of the best papaya salad I've eaten and i papaya salad!  I of course got the Tamarind  chicken and had them add cashews...yum I'm still thinking about it on top of bok choi and crunchy carrots!  Rob got the beef gapow and it was delish! His eggs were over cooked but if that was our only issue with them being so busy we'll take it! And did I mention the food came out FAST and FRESH and HOT!
