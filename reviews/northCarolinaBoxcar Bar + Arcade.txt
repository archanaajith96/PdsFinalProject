This place is freaking awesome! They have all sorts of daily drink specials, game tournaments and a ridiculous variety of games. It's like, D&B's but with no tickets and more alcohol, more true arcade games and much much more nostalgia. They currently have the following games that were near and dear to my heart in my childhood:Dance Dance RevolutionSkee-ballMarvel vs CapcomMarvel vs Capcom 2Street Fighter AlphaX-MenTMNT: Turtles in TimeMortal KombatMortal Kombat 2They had a lot of other arcade games to choose from and you can even play the classic consoles! The brews are also very very vast and varied. I'd say they have a better selection between cans and drafts than many other bars that I've been to. You have a great select of ales, pilsners, lagers, stouts, porters, IPAs, sours, seasonals - you name it and they have something for you and it won't break the bank on the given day.I can't wait to come back to this place in about a couple of years and I hope that until then something like the Boxcar makes its way to Northern New Jersey one day because there is nothing like this up here."}, {"review_id": "1saTiGx19FRCSr7NjN8vZg", "user_id": "ohy37YZh1K5RNjPhfgTwdA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "The pros: awesome selection of games. great selection of beers. cool vibesThe cons: some of the machines \"steal\" tokens or don't always work. can get very crowded.Recommendation: go during off hours and play the track and field game!"}, {"review_id": "0wGs08fSWRQNQAAW3DNmZg", "user_id": "c7GjrM3ge_q-SNF2UdByag", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Things I like about this placeThis is a casual place to go if you want to bring your friends for a drink and play some games or just hangout on the outside area.  It could be classified as first date-worthy if you're the very casual type.  I like the throwback games, it takes you back to the good ole days.  They have have pinball machines, skeeball (I just so happen to be pretty damn good at:)) fooseball, air hockey which is always occupied, and the majority are old school arcade games.  The outside has live music here and there, a jenga set, and just an area to sit, talk, and chill.  The drinks are fair priced, and they have free popcorn, haha.  The staff is also pretty nice.Things I don't like about this placeThe arcade games always seem to malfunction by eating your tokens.  I like that they have new skeeball set, so shoutout to them for upgrading, but there are still issues with the other games.  The spacing isn't the best - I feel like everytime I'm in line to play a game, I'm always bumping into someone that's sitting at one of the tables near the skeeball or fooseball table.  They allow dogs, but I wouldn't bring my dog there.  Pretty vulnerable to accidently having their tail stepped on if they're laying down, and it's not clean enough in my opinion.  If I had to guess the age range here, it's probably on average 21-31 here.  I'm 30, and I myself sometimes feel like I'm too old for this place.  Still a place worth checking out overall."}, {"review_id": "nSJ0avgAKoy8pFWcFBzi6Q", "user_id": "RxtaZlcS4vLgDAw1C3ZRAA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "I've been to a lot of different barcades and gaming bars and wasn't completely impressed by this one. Very strict ID checks at the door and judging by how young a lot of the patrons were I'm assuming they've had a few issues with underage drinking and maybe fined or something at some point. I'm only 31 and trust me this place made me feel old!Lots of pinball, retro and newer arcade machines. Air hockey, skeeball, consoles and DDR.The bar had a great selection on tap and lots of options of canned/bottled drinks, and they also do daily specials. Last night was $3 fireball.A lot of the machines have cupholders attached to the sides which is awesome. They've got cute retro gaming graffiti in the walls and christmas lights along the top, looks great! What I didn't like? First and foremost it's super cramped in there, they didn't plan for a lot of seating and during our visit there were multiple \"reserved for party\" signs on the tables, so you have to awkwardly stand holding your drink trying not to get elbowed. The 2 token machines and ATM are awkwardly positioned between the bathroom, bar and walkway in so there's always a super confusing queue of people waiting, along with people just standing there cause there's nowhere to go. People do not free up the more popular machines or the consoles, so you're just stuck standing there continuing your mission of avoiding drunk 21 year old elbows. A little too loud for a chill gaming night talking with friends. Maybe we just went on a crazy busy night, but we left after a few attempts at trying to get something to play and half a beer. Don't get me wrong, I like dive bars and this wasn't my first crowded loud bar but it can definitely be done better."}, {"review_id": "h0cqdmmTcskg-pt3eh_1xw", "user_id": "gVyzWkCkAL8HGL0E-dSU5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "Um, free  popcorn??

The space itself is huge and the place is packed (on a Friday night) with people of all ages (all over 21), which was great. They had several different beers, both on tap...and not? They had tons of old fashioned arcade games which was awesome. This is honestly such a versatile place. Perfect to go with friends, family, even a first date.

It does get pretty crowded at times and there can be long waits for certain games. I've seen kids there and people of all ages.

Their drink variety is legit and staff seems to be friendly, but when it's busy it's hard to grab their attention. Their games aren't cheap though. In fact you may actually be better off going to Dave & Busters on their discount day to really enjoy low-budget games. Then again their number of classic arcade games is unparalleled, so good on them in that regard. The only real point I can deduct them for is the prices are on the high end of average."}, {"review_id": "I5vZ7sFYp2gd2B4EpJCV6A", "user_id": "Tin0kmGQNMD4G440YXpSzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Boxcar is such a fun and lively place to spend a Sunday afternoon! I've visited both the Greensboro and Raleigh location (and excitedly look forward to the Durham opening this summer) at night, however when I arrived at 4:30 p.m. on a Sunday I was pleasantly surprised to find it was just as, if not more crowded. The bar runs a great $10 bottle of champagne and orange juice pitcher special on Sunday, and there's music in the late afternoon out on the patio. Whether or not you choose to play games, it's just a great place to socialize, meet new people, and get out of the house on a Sunday!

Looks like fun and the employees were very nice. However it was a small establishment packed with children. I had read the previous reviews about how crowded the place gets at night so we chose to go Saturday afternoon. We thought the establishment was 21+ only (with the occasional child visiting with his/her parents) but on Saturdays they apparently host birthday parties for children. When we visited there seemed to be multiple birthday parties going on so we were able to walk in, get tokens, play one game, and then leave. We wanted to stay longer and play all of the arcade games that we have not played since we were younger but there were too many kids everywhere. We do plan on returning on a different day/time so that we can use the tokens that we purchased by were not able to use."}, {"review_id": "CjiqX1JQUqNu3XZ9NyrPVA", "user_id": "arAUiYc18zbGaR_b10n7gQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "I love arcade bars as a concept, but Boxcar's too loud and crowded to be enjoyable. It's also a bit of a roach motel for groups; since there's not much in the way of seating or fixed areas to hang, someone will always have just bought another beer or dumped a handful of tokens into Rampage when everyone else is ready a venue change. Some of the games are overpriced too, and I will never understand why arcades include skee-ball without letting me trade tickets for cheap plastic prizes.I'd much rather hit up a spot with comfy seats where my friends and I can talk between quick rounds of destroying them at Tetris."}, {"review_id": "1M1Zx0wCSACXNMFcsqYiUQ", "user_id": "VoHt3x3e7l7z6U2lb5yqXw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/17/2017", "text": "Alright fave bar in Raleigh, hands down!
