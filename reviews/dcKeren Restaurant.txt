Sounds great right? What's the catch? There is no catch.For around $12-$15 you can get a plate of your choice meat and veggies which is good enough to share for two. I usually get the special tibsi with fish and I get a flavorful tomato mix of tilapia fish. I also love their tuna dish! It's spicy but with the nose drool. Above all else, the ladies are amazing there and so friendly. It's no wonder why they have amazing yelp reviews which is why I stumbled into the restaurant in the first place.

Our family is fasting for lent so we decided to visit her and come here. It was soooo good! We came Sunday night and there was a pretty long wait, which means the food is good if near closing time there was still a long line. We finally got seated and ordered two veggie combos, two shiros, and two foil plates to share among the 7 of us. It was plenty of food, maybe even too much! The Shiro was my favorite, extremely flavorful, I could eat the bowl by myself. The foul was also delicious, we got it without the yogurt since again we are fasting, but it tasted just like how we would make it at home.This place is amazing!

It's a quaint restaurant pretty small. Comfy and casual there's even a bar. The Keren special is a huge platter good to share with two people. Very filling and appetizing. I love eating with my hands. The flavors are delicious. Great variety and mix of veggies and the meat. They also give you the spongy bread on the side so that fills you up. Also sooo affordable. Would like to try other things on the menu. I think they also have pasta or spaghetti?

She was incredibly kind and walked me through what I was looking at and helped me to select what's shown below. What is it? Heck if I know, but the taste - yum, yum and yum! We devoured pretty much all of it and contemplated ordering more. However, I wasn't a fan of the bread the meal is served on. It was a bit too spongy for my taste.

This is by far and hands down my favorite restaurant in DC.If you come during dinner time, especially on a Friday or Saturday, you're going to wait for a long time. But I promise you -- it is worth it.When I was super skinny and not able to keep anything down, Keren always came to my rescue. No matter how sick I felt I was able to eat the food at Keren once or twice a week. For the last 3 years Keren's staff has become my family. They are incredible and they always make me feel special. On my birthday they went across the street to get me a slice of cake -- which was one of the nicest things ever done for me. They always ask how my mom is doing when they see me which is also incredibly nice. I love them all.Eritrean/Ethiopian food is very vegetarian friendly, and Keren has the fantastic veggie combo. The veggie combo includes cabbage, a spicier lentil, a milder lentil, spinach, potatoes and carrots, and a salad. It's enough for two people to eat and be very full after. If you come to the restaurant not super hungry then one can even feed three people. They'll give you each bread to eat with it.The food is fresh and clean. It's has spices but isn't very spicy. If you're used to eating Indian food, it's similar enough to be familiar but different enough to be a new experience. You will feel very full but you will never feel heavy and gross afterwards.I've literally taken everyone I know to this restaurant, and tell everyone I know that they have to go here. I've also been here tons of times alone -- but I never feel alone because Keren's staff is always making me feel part of their family. People always ask me what the best restaurant in DC is in my opinion and the answer is always clearly Keren."}, {"review_id": "hr0gvbdHZg64YCugfopIvQ", "user_id": "M05_w-QTk_Zu_OBbJS9olA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Wow. Never have tried Ethiopian food before and I was so ecstatic that I was getting the chance to do so. I was visiting friends in DC and they were saying that this place is bumpin. And when we got there, they were not joking. The restaurant space itself is quite small so there are not many seatings. However, the restaurant's service is amazing and food comes out fairly quickly! So waiting in line isn't too terrible. I ordered the vegetarian platter and my goodness. It might not look filling when it initially comes out, but you can bet that it does. It has a potato mixture, baked beans, sautéed spinach, cabbage, and salad. The ingredients are all on top of a bread. The bread is moist and fluffy. It has a bunch of tiny little holes so if you have trypophobia, be weary. But the taste of the bread was super interesting. It has a slight bit of a sour tangy taste that was something I've never tasted before. But the combination of it with the ingredients were perfect! Inside the restaurant was also a little hot just because it's a small location with food constantly cooking in the back. I would def not pass this place up!"}, {"review_id": "_UXymnomnwAP4STLE15PPg", "user_id": "OCs1rWzfoZKw8prDq_83Nw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "Unique. Ethiopian food. Delicious.

Loved the beef, potatoes and veggies. I heard the portions were bigger in the past but two plates for the three of us and we were stuffed.. for ~$10 a person!!I would recommend this place to those who love trying different types of cuisine.

We ordered fatta with selsi and the breakfast combo (ful, egg frittata and tesmi kitcha fitfit) which is served all day -- the BOMB! The flavors and portion was great. I took plenty togo.

I read quite a few reviews and some articles on food network and Eater DC. There were so many to chose from but Keren Restaurant stood out. Made my way over arriving at 8PM on a Thursday night and the place was packed but the owner and what seems to be a family run spot were all smiles. There isn't much space to wait so it does pose a small problem in the winter. Restaurant probably only seats 35-40 people at a time so if you are coming with a big crowd I'd suggest earlier rather then later as there was a big party waiting to be seated for quite some time. Onto the food!We were greeted by the owner who offered us suggestions seeing as we were new to this type of food. For three of us we ordered the 1 & 4 on the menu having beef and chicken as our choice proteins. We also ordered the popular side the was mostly made up of chick peas. The food was fantastic. Not overly seasoned, colorful and well balanced. Easy to say there was something for everyone to enjoy. For the amount of food and the quality this bill was $62 for three people and included a bottle of wine. Aside from being a great bang for your buck- what I enjoyed most was the atmosphere. It's kind and welcoming and makes you feel as home. The owner gave us a pot of tea on the house and remained completely attentive in a packed house. Love, love, loved this spot and can not wait to come back again.

The Keren special is especially great because it comes with an assortment of veggies, so you can try a little of everything. Today, I tried to branch out and ordered the breakfast special.

It's a bit different spice wise than Ethiopian food and a bit more tomato based. Nonetheless, I did a bunch of searching and Keren came up in the top each time. There was an Ethiopian place across the street from my friends apartment but I walked out of the way to try this out. It was in the middle of the day so no crowds and I'm sure service more laid back and attentive than prime rush. Regardless, the food came out quickly and was presented beautifully (I don't take food pics, sorry I'm not sorry). I got the special with beef. The Enjera bread was very nice and held up well when I dug in with my hands to scoop food up with it. Dish flavors were nice with just the right amount of spice. While the beef wasn't melt in your mouth, it was easily eaten and not tough, still very enjoyable. Typically meaning it was cooked low and slow to allow the breakdown of collagen. The special #1 was definitely enough for 2 people and could have been split, but I housed the whole thing since I was by myself, warning, you will be really full. Definitely will be back if I'm in the area again and suggest those who've never tried this type of cuisine to venture out into the ethnic abyss and enjoy it!"}, {"review_id": "AMGX3y9YeuSeCwB4EFVuJw", "user_id": "Qm5aJVopvX4Sa7mMi0DdIA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Great little place.

We have had 5-6 meals here to date with family and friends and every one of them was a very satisfying experience.Both Ethiopia and Eritrea have common culinary roots similar to how India and Pakistan share a lot when it comes to food. Another common element between both country pairs is a border conflict. For a group of 4 individuals, we recommend the Veggie Combo, Special Tibsi (Choice of: Beef/Chicken/Fish) and an order of the Shiro for lunch. Every one of the entrees comes with Enjera (a spongy pancake made out of a fermented Teff batter). Teff is a healthy food-grain given that it is gluten-free, is high in dietary fibre and is low on the glycemic index scale. The pancake also makes for a vehicle for the food and soaks up the juices nicely as a base layer.The Shiro is a special mention and screams comfort food. Do try this incredibly tasty ground-chickpea stew. Even the vegetarian combo cannot be dismissed for the lack of animal protein. The vegetables feel very meaty in all their preparations and every one of them is tasty.When it comes to drinks, the coffee beverages are very good. If you feel adventurous, try the Eritrean Tea (brewed with cinnamon, cardamom and cloves) or the Tej (a sweet honey wine).
