I even had my wedding rehearsal dinner here if that gives you any idea. Their breakfast burrito is my favorite in the city for brunch. I like to add spinach to it, or even get it vegetarian depending if I feel like having chorizo or not. I'm usually disappointed when I have a breakfast burrito anywhere else that I question why I even order it outside of here. It's that good! Their lobster bisque is incredible too. You truly can't go wrong with a single thing you order, because it is all made well with fresh ingredients. They also change up the menu to feature seasonal items, so you'll likely find something new each time you visit. They are known for having lots of vegan and vegetarian choices, and despite me not being either one of those I've enjoyed several of those dishes!Picasso always has great service, and many of their staff have been here for years. That greatly speaks to the quality of how well this business is run. I recommend making reservations, because they are always pretty busy. If you haven't made it here before, what are you waiting for?!"}, {"review_id": "UlM5v8hX6bgq9mo3WqXy2Q", "user_id": "W9obXdWFMOS747q6sq-nSw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Eclectic menu. Lots of vegan and vegetarian choices. I had their prosciutto pizza - unusual and very tasty. The crust was perfect, and the mix of ham, figs, and blue cheese hit the right combo of sweet/salty/tangy.It is a little noisy, not really conducive to a quiet dinner, but the art is interesting and the crowd is colorful."}, {"review_id": "mYHCH2NAJKrFIjF_un6u9g", "user_id": "OmOOzGKYwPUxyG4_xMFFRA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "The mood at Picasso is probably my favorite thing about it. I'm obsessed with the mid-century modern color scheme. The lighting and color at each booth shoots you back to the 60's. I don't normally like the color orange but it works so well here. Our server was really helpful and accommodated us since we were in a hurry. He was excellent with such good customer service. The Cuban sandwich I ordered was melt in your mouth good! I LOVED that the sandwich was on grilled French bread instead of a bun! I did not like the ham on it; it made the sandwich too sweet, so I had to take it off.  The pork was still very good.  Our French fries were amazing-I can't explain how it was the perfect combination of crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. It is a little expensive for lunch, but it is justified by the portion size."}, {"review_id": "7Qlgdf2PBseiUO_GEoJqow", "user_id": "A84BDSbdQPdqtvS_DHx62Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::#Brunching #Brunching@Picassos I've dined here for brunch on two occasions & I do plan to go back. The atmosphere is warm, casual & welcoming. The staff are very nice. I really enjoy the experience of being there. Both times I've gotten a dish with a variation of biscuits & gravy. Both times I've left completely underwhelmed-I'll certainly be skipping that combo from now on. I've been with family & friends who loved their Eggs Benedict dishes, so that seems like a great place to start. They also have a Nashville hot chicken & waffles dish that looks interesting & may be my next great adventure-I'll keep you posted ;):::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::#Lunch #Lunch@Picassos Loveliness is the best way to describe their iced tea.

The service was excellent but the food can be improved.We ordered two appetizers, three entrees, and a dessert for four people. They all came out at the same time. I would have preferred to have the appetizers come out first and the entrees come out after. The Mexican Poutine was cold and the sweet potato fries were soggy. There was way too much meat on the fries. The spicy fried chicken was dry and had no taste. The batter was bland and the sandwich was not spicy. There was barely any coleslaw in the sandwich. The donuts and coffee for dessert were okay. The donuts were dried and appeared to have been fried in burnt oil. The chocolate pudding that was the \"coffee\" was good and made up for the dried donuts. I hate to say it but the only thing good was the pretzel, which you really can't go wrong with. Picasso Cafe, you guys are awesome and you have the best front of the house people working for you but please work on improving the kitchen."}, {"review_id": "MaVRUt4HJLoGnwO__Qet9A", "user_id": "FukPl80javIhxW5FROqUTQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "My first time here but i really enjoyed it!

The food was very good! They offer a different variety of options and serving sizes are decent. We did not have cocktails but the bar looked awesome.

I hear it's usually difficult to get in, so you should RSVP, but it was dead the morning I finally went.I was a little surprised at how basic the menu was. People literally rave about the brunch here, but I couldn't really see how it was much different from any where else. I ended up getting a secret menu option after the table next to me ordered it, the Breakfast burrito smothered with the debris toppings. This was their breakfast burrito with sauce, fried onions, pulled pork and pico on top with the cheese sauce. It was very good, but huge and did not re-heat well (a test I hold all over sized portions to.)I had the vanilla haze spiked coffee and honestly it was too strong for me to sip and enjoy. I chugged it and switched to a poinsettia.I had a good time and the food was good, but it wasn't 5 stars or anything to rave about it. Not sure what I missed, but it was a pretty basic breakfast place and didn't stand out as a must have brunch spot to me."}, {"review_id": "CpH-gf-oj0rY2vxGa1zE7Q", "user_id": "uL7KK7uGrSe2kh4GGE7CpQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/22/2017", "text": "One of the best vegetarian-friendly restaurants in OKC.Picasso is one of the few places in Oklahoma City that caters high quality vegan food. While only a small portion of the menu may be vegetarian (this may be a good thing if you want to convince your omnivore friends to tag along), they have increased veggie options in recent months.My last visit here included a couple of vegan entrees. Despite my size, I can eat a lot of food in one sitting and I was eager to try more than one thing. The only minor disappointment was that there were no vegan appetizers. The menu does state that substitutions can be made, so if you ask, I wouldn't be surprised if they could come up with a vegan starter. The chicken fried portobello was very savory and great as hot, vegan comfort food. One suggestion, though, is that they don't sit the portobello on a bed of fries. The fries were very soggy as a result, but other than that, the dish was very good. For most, this entree would be quite filling. The Kung Pao spicy cauliflower sounded interesting, so I dared to give it a try. The breaded cauliflower was hearty and the sauce was flavorful. I didn't find the dish as spicy as advertised and the portion felt small for an entree, but otherwise I enjoyed it as well. A previous visit was for a vegan 5-course dinner. I don't have specifics on hand, but that meal, including the presentation of the night, was superb. I wish they'd host vegan dinner specials like that more often. Rating the service and atmosphere becomes a bit more complicated. I don't want to focus too much on their opportunities, but they're worth a brief discussion. The vegan 5-course dinner started fairly late, more than a half hour behind schedule. Service on my recent visit was also on the slower side, not to mention my friend was brought the wrong soup and she was very upset. (Thankfully she didn't have an allergy) I think it's best to plan ahead, be strategic about when you dine here and make a reservation to minimize issues. It can get quite packed on Saturday nights. The atmosphere is also a bit odd, as it falls between a mixture of artsy, hipster and upscale. There's a waiting area that had couches with kids running around and someone apparently eating a meal there. I didn't mind the vibe, but just keep that in mind that it's kinda funky/eclectic. Overall, the food quality and taste are very good. Service varies and the atmosphere is atypical from what most would expect in Oklahoma City, but as a vegan, I do enjoy dining here and will return, hopefully soon!"}, {"review_id": "Xsr_ssTV9lndR4YnuR2KNg", "user_id": "yeu2RctJekTo2APMHpXS2g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/11/2017", "text": "I've attempted this place several times and every time we have issues with our order or something else.This last time we took my parents for my dad's birthday. They delivered his burger but left all of the rest of us hanging for the rest of our food for a good 15 minutes. Meanwhile the rest of us were all starved and he had to eat by himself. He said the burger was good which hey, it was his birthday I want it to be good but still get our order right and all come out together please. When I got my food my eggs just seemed like not fresh and just the kind people make in bulk of a batter. Our waitress then tells us my dad's order only printed out and the computer must have missed our 3 other orders. They did give us an order of beignets at the end which I guess that was for the birthday which was nice.

I've recently came here for an event and within that same week, I came back for a luncheon with some friends. One thing I would like to compliment this establishment on is the fact that it's such a dog-friendly restaurant! I knew they had a front patio area, but I didn't know that they had a closed off back patio too; I was so thrilled to find out about that, because Tommy (the dog that I'm dog-sitting) deserves to get out sometimes and mingle with other fellow dogs! I did like how I could take Tommy off his leash so he could play with the other dogs. Also, Picasso had a \"dog bowl\" option for $4! Tommy was so happy with his meal. I've always enjoyed the food here and I would occasionally visit the restaurant when my best friend is in town. She's a vegan that has stated that Picasso is one of her favorite vegan go-to joints. She is always craving their chicken fried Portobello, which I admit, is also one of my favorite entrées. I usually start off with either the smoked salmon spring rolls or the spicy avocado toast, which I highly recommend. I keep telling myself that I'm going to try something different from the menu, but I can never stay away from my favorites. The Ahi tuna Indian taco is definitely one my favorites, along with the fried avocado wrap! Their mac and cheese is pretty good too. I really want to try the Nashville hot chicken, so I'll be back soon enough. BY THE WAY, I love their brunch!!"}, {"review_id": "BaIoxOC7Zt-7KUKMAU5CTA", "user_id": "SXuI6YUbb032ztRvIa2iCA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "I think if the best part of the meal is the appetizer then you are doing something wrong. That being said the queso was INCREDIBLE. On a scale of 1 to 10 it was like 10*450^7th power. The entrees we chose were less than incredible. My bf had the chicken fried portobello which was super hot on the inside of the crust so hot that it was hard to eat but the gravy on top cooled too fast so it was like some bad fire and ice combo going on that was not that great. I had the fried avocado wrap which was supposed to have several things atop it but the cabbage slaw really drowned everything else out. I was super bummed.The sides for both of our meals were delicious, the French fries and the parmesean risotto were off the chain with all that being said, the best parts of the meal were the appetizer and the sides and that was pretty lame. The food wasn't terrible it just wasn't very good and I would go back just for the queso if I am being honest so that is why it's got 3/5 stars instead of just 2.Hope your trip here is delicious, let me know if you agree or disagree or maybe agree to disagree."}, {"review_id": "3EHOz5uJBDfa14gc3UbMgA", "user_id": "O6hUJEssTtlCHbNQrJMpsg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Always made to feel very welcome, Picasso Cafe is a place you can relax and enjoy some good food.

Reasonably priced, locally sourced, and delicious meals. Can't say I've run into a bad experience with my meals, except the fact that the crab bisque has a slight taste of fruit pebbles, and I'm not sure where it's coming from. I've had everything from the Airline Chicken to the Fried Avocado Wrap, and I've never been disappointed. I recently chose it for a Valentine's Day Dinner - my restrictions were to keep a nice meal under $100, and we did that all while ordering an app, a few drinks, and two full entrees. A win in my book. 2. I love how the menu and specials change, and they are always trying something new. For instance, during the V-Day meal, they had some Cajun options (for Marti Gras) so we opted for the Red Beans and Rice Arancini. Paired with a cajun spiced-aoli and a spicy andouille sausage. It was so good, it had me cryin.  3. The viiiiibe. I love me some Paseo and Uptown 23rd vibes. You never really quite know who you're going to run into, and I almost always see someone I love/admire there. The restaurant is almost always bustling, and I make sure to make a reservation if I'm going for brunch, or a weekend dinner, since the wait times can be insane. No issues though, you can always walk over to the newly-renovated Other Room and have a drink, browse through Craig's Emporium, or battle your Pokemon at the gym just caddy-corner to the restaurant. 4. Service has always been good for me, but I am hesitant to involve it in my very extensive rating research (hehe) since it can be so unpredictable. Everyone seems to be efficient on the timing of drinks, apps, and meals, and I do appreciate that. I hope you guys visit Picasso Cafe soon, it's definitely a favorite in my book."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/picasso-cafe-oklahoma-city?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
