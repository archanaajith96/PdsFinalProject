It's nice that the park is located across the street and can walk a few laps to kill time and park there too. Neighborhood parking is a little tricky since it can be busy. If you want to avoid the long lines and parking fiasco, the weekday wait is a breeze.I love this cafe for weekend brunch. It's a staple to experience if you want a cozy meal. I always get the double play which is delicious but the real game changer is the jam on the table; it is amazing! I rarely eat jam or \"toast\" but it's a must-have if you go. Service is usually pretty good and the servers are all pretty cool with a good attitude."}, {"review_id": "VrCGOkQ-AEXT4EAhtN9pIQ", "user_id": "XEUcVQdQOmLGwECvDLfaoQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I don't get it. The biggest compliment I can bestow is their windows are on point. Natural light is a great way to start the day and Liberty Park is a nice piece of nature to observe from your breakfast table. (In person is a slightly different tale.) In other news, their breakfast burrito is god awful. I actually unraveled the whole thing just to figure out how one messes up a staple so badly. If you've ever driven down a remote highway and you come across a diner 50 miles from anything and you wonder, where do the people who work there even live? ... yeah, it kind of tasted like what I imagine a place like that would serve up. Staring at my mutilated burrito, I didn't find the answer I was looking for. It just looked like under-seasoned scrambled eggs and raw onions and peppers. The server came by to observe the carnage and asked me in the most sympathetic tone if I didn't like it. But I lied like the good house guest I wasn't. I told her it was fantastic and I was just full. As a patriotic ambassador to the SLC breakfast community, I already knew I was going to lambast Park Cafe's Gustavo burrito in the hopes of preventing others from following in my footsteps, so the least I could do was pay for it.Go ahead. Order the burrito. Taste and see for yourself."}, {"review_id": "jf6hwCboDPVDRuCWcOjZSw", "user_id": "Vym1SxpBLzhTHTYyOM8Mhg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I was in town dropping a buddy off at the SLC airport and was looking for a good breakfast. Yelped the area and picked this spot. The special was corned beef hash but their biscuits and gravy looked good too. Our waiter said the gravy was awesome and suggested upgrading the toast that comes with the special to a biscuit with gravy on top. Good call. The portions were huge too, I could only finish half of my corned beef hash. The service was excellent as well.It's located in an old house across from a park so it's easy to drive by. I bet their lunch is good too. I'd definitely come back if I am in SLC again."}, {"review_id": "N6o7TuXKgR3lX142tVFzhg", "user_id": "8SzoGCAlYki8DDoKII5DVg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Delicious breakfast food.

I got a recommendation from a local and The Park Café was the spot they recommended. Every parking spot near the restaurant was full so we parked on an adjacent street.  My buddy and I walked in and sat @ 7:12 am, which meant their doors were open for approximately 12 minutes before we got there. We both commented as we looked around that our meal was about to be delicious, as there were only a couple of tables left open. Every other table was filled with eager looking patrons. We watched as the food starting coming out from the kitchen and knew we were in store for a treat. This is THE perfect spot for a solid meal when in Salt Lake City.Friendly staff with an unassuming decor makes this spot super yummy!"}, {"review_id": "T556WbEZardynq21kn3NsQ", "user_id": "WR5wWEi8lZAlhVZ77oav8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/30/2017", "text": "I have only been here twice and my first time was probably 8 years ago! I remember when I went the first time I did not like the food, but many years later I have changed my mind!I ordered the Michigan hash and added tomatoes. It was a large portion for a decent price. I love the way they make their potatoes. I was thinking the typical piecey long potatoes, but they were more like smashed potatoes. The cooked my egg perfectly and what made it better was adding tabasco! The pancakes were huge! My mom ordered the blueberry ones and it was tasty, not too much blueberry. They tasted like any other pancakes. My man ordered the typical breakfast dish and he enjoyed it. I like their sausages, it had a kick to them. Lastly the customer service was great, my mom wasn't a big fan of the tent because she was worried that it would be cold, but they had heater lamps and also double checked on if we were still cold. Refilled our coffees and waters in a timely manner:) Will be returning to try your other dishes!"}, {"review_id": "QUoWiMMtXghCitobNowcwQ", "user_id": "-grC9WQmDOUBvxS9dX_gXQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Great breakfast venue.

We parked along the neighborhood street near the restaurant because it was pretty packed.We ended up waiting about 20 minutes before getting seated inside the restaurant. It's a smaller space but they had set up the tent outside as well to accommodate the larger crowd.We got a Chai Tea and it was AWESOME. Super tasty. I don't really like hot tea but I would order this every time.We got three Bases Loaded, two steak and one pork chops. It came with potatoes and eggs. Everything was seasoned perfectly. Lots of time when you go to places like this, the steak will be cooked but will taste like nothing. Same with the eggs. Everything was great. The potatoes weren't prepared really how I enjoy them (more of a home fry kind of guy), but they were still flavorful.On top of all the food being great, the service was great, too.

Wait time on Saturday morning was about 20 minutes, which is just enough time explore the community park across the street.We got seated in the indoor patio right next to the heated fireplace, which along with the heat lamps, keeps the whole place cozy.Our party of four ordered two dishes - their Michigan Hash and their Huevo Ranchos special. Even though the place was packed, the staff was extremely efficient and the food came quick. Best part was that it came our pre-split into 4 dishes (without even asking!)The Michigan Hash is very good. The potatoes rightfully seasoned, the sausage chunks delightfully flavorful, and the overall mix was downright amazing. I can't imagine a single person finishing the meal though, as the two of us still had to doggybag the rest for later.The Huevo Ranchos was fun to eat. The individual parts by themselves weren't too special... but combining the eggs, beans and tortillas in one bite was delicious and fulfilling. There's something about the beans. mmMm.Overall it seems like a reliable place for a satisfying brunch... also can't beat milk for a $1!"}, {"review_id": "9EectELmnrscnqDErV-teg", "user_id": "4FlPGuVW6Iokd26C_xmf4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Great little Cafe with a big menu selection!! I got the Michigan Hash and a hot chocolate. I was sharing the Hash with my husband and it was very nice of them to spit it into 2 plate for us. The portion is definitely big and good for the price. Also not to mention the strawberry jam, that's jam on toast is amazing. I would love to come back and try more things on their menu. The only suggestion for them is to have a coffee drink menu, my husband wanted a cappuccino but the one option they have is black coffee.

Don't skip the French toast, this is the only place I'll order it. This is the type of place where the owner is always there, helping serve and clean tables - he's great and very friendly.

Park Cafe has this nailed - I've eaten here many times of the years and always have the same experience - a 10 minute or so wait, prompt service, food brought fairly quickly, cooked as expected.Vibe: It always feels like late morning on a weekend here, no matter the day of week it actually is. The tables are closely spaced tables, there's lots of chatting, and soon your belly is full of breakfast comfort food.Food: The food itself is good, if somewhat standard breakfast fare.
