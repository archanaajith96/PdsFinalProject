This place has a private parking lot, however during lunch hours it gets pretty crowded. The sandwiches and salads are made fresh to order and they are generally open during the week only and during lunch hours only.  According to the hours posted they are sometimes open on weekends during the fall.When you walk in, grab a menu and begin perusing as you wait in line to order.  Once you have decided what you want, it may be necessary for someone in your party to begin table hunting.  They have a couple of tables outside and some in the back but it can take a moment to find one if you have a larger party. A note, this is not the place to post up and work for a couple hours, in fact they have a policy expressly forbidding that practice.  My go to here is the Tom Turkey sandwich on sour dough bread.  The loop sandwich and fresh fruit are always good go to options as well.  The sweet tea is to die for or regular coke products are available for order!All in all, I am a huge fan of Regina's and hope to continue dining there many times in the future!"}, {"review_id": "C4tQkprKUXxShZvgejHvtw", "user_id": "xEz4TEgSMM7lesiOQZI-Gw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/14/2017", "text": "I've been here a few times and I've got to say this is one of my favorite lunch spots. My go to is their Tom Turkey. It's piled high with plenty of turkey, and comes with honey mustard that is neither too sweet nor too mustardy. I wish they were open longer so I could come more often. I've had a few of their soups and they're great as well. Definitely, definitely give them try. FYI: if you get the Mississippi mud cake make sure you have a gallon of milk to go with it because you're going to need it"}, {"review_id": "Hvpf2ds3FE4MrDGzGY4RqQ", "user_id": "2dBbeHiPBzPZa1X2Wk-EZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/14/2017", "text": "Regina's Kitchen is my favorite local lunch spot in midtown. I'm on a mission to try everything on their menu and I'm at item number 5 and have not been disappointed yet. Regina's even has a drive thru. However I'd much rather dine in and admire the local art and decor. I tried the Nellie this time and it gave my taste buds a run for the money. If you are near midtown Regina's is a must stop it will be worth it."}, {"review_id": "DLgQn86gPtH4vP-X4cuNeA", "user_id": "l0dX2l0GGakSOwwgmp4GmA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "This place is amazing the service and the environment is very welcoming the food is incredible every time the consistency is just phenomenal over and over and over again it's like mom is cooking in the kitchen and when you get it it sure taste like it to"}, {"review_id": "XEk2E6wUCRdjBronj8kSCw", "user_id": "NFYMk8WEw0jBbwzqtvHgDg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Had the turkey and my wife had the ham and cheddar.

I love this little place. Note they do have a drive up window... Order the dessert early as it sells out fast. The hours do limit when I can enjoy the food - but still so glad I finally made it out for a lunch with a co-worker. The line does move fast so do not get discouraged. Enjoy a cup of coffee...in one of those cute little cups. The Loop sandwich was perfect!! Take the time to enjoy this lunch spot near Little Flower Parish & School."}, {"review_id": "oPZ5iWOEWxFkUjXgdrlSUA", "user_id": "WPEGMnvXPD7DFZucdEe8Hg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "Very good sandwiches.

I was in town just to explore Mobile. I decided to give this place a try, and oh the joy it brought me. I would tell you how amazing my sandwich was specifically, but I'm confident every sandwhich is great. Every single ingredient, the taste, the freshness, everything was amazing. I couldn't dream of a better sandwich.  My friend got a salad and this is where we found out they make their salad dressing in house. I'm head over heels for this place. My only regret is I'm not sure how many more times I can visit before my stay is over."}, {"review_id": "LpNu2-HbGrRrT_oaWDVq1w", "user_id": "RNujNB9r0gc5M1q1H3WgKA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/8/2017", "text": "Cute place, and seems to be popular!

Great food, friendly staff and a comfortable, laid back atmosphere. On my first visit, I had chicken tortilla soup and a delicious grilled cheese and tomato sandwich.

This place is not in the city center and will take a while to get to. -Do not be dissuaded by the line. It moves quickly and is a sign of good things to come.-Do not tip. This one was strange, but there's not a tip jar and there's no room on the credit card slip to add one in. The guy behind the counter said his tip would be our enjoyment. Love.-Do not be afraid to go off menu. Want to trade bacon for turkey? You be you. -Do not expect to finish the entire thing. It's so amazing and you'll want to keep eating well after you're full, but trust your 4pm uncomfortable self and stop eating while it's still enjoyable.-And finally, do NOT miss Regina's Kitchen during your stay in Mobile. All of those glowing 5 star reviews are spot on, this is a dream of a southern lunchtime establishment."}, {"review_id": "wNWsze5AsRlT3hRgedcsFA", "user_id": "-ZT1pQYeiqWYZz1EGguqeg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/28/2017", "text": "Incredible people!

Cutesy kitschy decor, you place your order with the cashier and pick up it up down the counter.Gumbo was surprisingly bland. The roast beef and jalepeno cheddar sandwich was delightful.Cashier wasn't particularly friendly, but that's ok -- they were busy. I did expect a little bit more after spending almost 15 dollars for a sandwich, soup, and drink.Tackiest part of the decor, in my opinion: the Trump sign behind the register, so just an FYI if you're the type to boycott/support businesses based on their politics.
