The wait was for about 30 minutes, which was pretty accurate to the time we were seated. It took our server a while to get to us to take our drink orders..For drinks, I ordered the diablo in a martini glass and they ordered beers. We planned on ordering strictly apps, which we did. We ordered the crab cakes, blackened alligator, spinach and artichoke dip twice baked, buffalo wings, and fried pickles. This was my first time trying their crab cakes, and they were okay. Definitely not the best, but I've never been a huge fan of them either way. Everything else was enjoyable per usual, except the alligator was a bit salty.Chimes is a good go to spot for drinks with friends and apps to munch on. No doubt that we'll be back."}, {"review_id": "ZZ8fcvcsNrNu9kibwfyTvA", "user_id": "y8kexh98zBQQvfQwjOAEug", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "This is a fun place to grab a drink and eat some pretty good food.  I have been here on several occasions.  During some of the visits the wait staff suggest some items that are not printed on the menu.  I have never been steered wrong with their recommendations.  The beer selection is pretty awesome -- they have a ton of options on tap.  From a service perspective, the staff is very attentive and quick to keep the drinks coming.Sometimes, there can be a wait.  In my opinion, it's worth it."}, {"review_id": "sXqMic-xdwCfHP6-HarsNQ", "user_id": "m94_dzLOw1XM48vydZ8ysg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "In my opinion, Chimes is staple if you're in Baton Rouge. Really good food at a fair price with a very relaxed atmosphere. The service is typically good, but there are definitely some nights where it's pretty bad. I don't think I've ever had a problem with the food though. There was a time where I came with a large group (10+) and our wait was almost three hours. I wouldn't recommend having large parties here since they don't do reservations. Also, the hostesses (is that a real word?) don't give out wait times because they can't \"promise\" anything? That was very strange. I love coming here on Tuesdays for their half-prices oysters! So good and so cheap. When they do have them, the sautéed crab claws are also a must! They come is this delicious butter garlic sauce; omg, order some rolls on the side and you have a match made in heaven! The charbroiled oysters are pretty good too! I love they bread they give on the side with them because, you guessed it, it has butter and garlic on it.They're happy hour drinks are pretty good too. I really like to get \"The Smoothie,\" not sure if it's on happy hour though. If you're not sure whether you're in the mood for Guinness or Angry Orchard, get both and get the smoothie! It's a combo of the two when the Guinness sits on top and Angry Orchard at the bottom. Each time you sip you mainly taste the Guinness with a hint of the Angry Orchard. It's really good!"}, {"review_id": "--C-19Pt94sG1dslrzTsIg", "user_id": "jhU5dE_bruUXDbD-NTgEzw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Food was good. It was noisy.

First let me say, idk why we stopped coming here! The only thing I can think is that a lot of the time, the wait can be very long due to its popularity. Thankfully since it was pretty late we didn't have to worry about that. We sat in the bar area. The bar is fully stocked although the list of cocktails isn't that long. I'm sure they can make whatever you're looking for, though. I had a Swamp Bucket, which would be like a cousin to the Rum Punch. It was quite tasty. There's actually 2 sizes (small and large) as well. For an appetizer we had the boudin balls. O M G! Super hot, crispy, and delicious! They were so good we seriously considered forfeiting our entree choice and just ordering more lol. For the entree we had the Catfish Perdu which is Fried catfish covered in crawfish etouffe. That also came out hot and fresh. It was so fresh the catfish still had some crisp to it although it was covered in the sauce. The portion was huge! Two people can seriously eat off of this as we did. The service was just ok. She seemed a little tired (it was kinda late) but overall she wasn't rude or anything. After this great experience I hope to be back!"}, {"review_id": "rmBpbOqX_DJvdGDNGhc5-A", "user_id": "ngxMDX2xiDj28Kz2qN89Xw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/11/2017", "text": "We had started with the raw oysters. They were good and for the price ($12 a dozen) they are hard to beat. I had the seafood gumbo and my friend had the shrimp and corn rice. Vic was our waitress. She was friendly and offered samples of the soups and other items to eat. For the main meal I just had cheese logs which are named cheese sticks. Homerun. We had boudin balls which were good. My friend and I split the Catfish Perdu. It was hot and fresh. A great place."}, {"review_id": "H_Py4sNbX1UBaA3om5Sq1w", "user_id": "auNEI7561VMt2qf37LfGZA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/3/2017", "text": "Came here during happy hour because my girlfriend and I was craving some oysters. Raw oysters are half off from 4pm-7pm Monday-Friday. In addition to oysters, we got the works fries, hushpuppies, and some crawfish mac & cheese. The works fries is basically french fries with cheese, bacon, and jalapeños. As my drink, I got the Covington Strawberry Ale which I really enjoyed. In terms of the food, everything was average. There was nothing special to it. I enjoy coming to Chimes because of how raw oysters are $6 per dozen during happy hour. Oysters were huge on the day I went! The waitress we had who's name was Roxane was excellent. She was attentive and made sure that we had everything we needed. The restaurant's decor is great. It gives you that \"Louisiana\" vibe. A lot of Louisiana memorabilia is decorated around that restaurant. Overall, I would come back!"}, {"review_id": "q2G0stit0KSrItAse4DNJg", "user_id": "ZjRCgjmflMBR5iMh31vVSQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2017", "text": "Chimes reminds me of my home away from home, New Orleans.The traditional southern food is to die for, along with the drinks! I haven't had Chimes in a very long time, about four years to be exact, I vaguely remember going my first time, but I decided to come back because I was craving some good 'ole red beans and rice (with sausage, of course!) and Chimes certainly delivered.I came here on a weekday so it wasn't packed at all, we were seated immediately, and our waitress was a real sweetheart who answered any questions we had. My mom and I decided to start off with the cheese fries and oh my lord they were amazing. The cheese fries were topped with so much cheese, that it made my cheese lover heart melt. Topped with cheese, jalapeño's, and bacon this bad boy is nothing to play with. You can go wrong the cheese fries. After stuffing my face with loads of cheese, I decided to place my order, red beans and rice with sausage, oh yeah! My mom got the shrimp (blackened) alfredo which looked and from what she said tasted divine. Before we got our entrees we got our salads that come with the meal, two yummy ceaser salads topped off with some pretty good cheese, croutons, and cherry tomatoes! My beans came out and oh my lord, they were magnificent. You can't find a lot of places that make good beans like this, and after tasting a bite of my moms shrimp alfredo I know that when I come back I'll be getting this yummy dish! Unfortunately we did not make it to the dessert round, because we were way too full from appetizer, salad, and entrees. So I can't tell you how it tastes, but I'm sure their dessert is pretty good! Can't wait to come back here for more good food."}, {"review_id": "V5MlPgmvyfIGEvFJSpcP5A", "user_id": "Lv1J_69YKgot4zNVA8f0Mg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "Meh... I don't know.

She suggested this place and so, on our first night, we decided to come here. We started off with several appetizers- from Cajun classics, like the blackened alligator and seafood cakes, to standard American fare, like bacon cheese fries and fried pickles, everything was awesome. They really excel at the seafood and the cakes were amazing. I got a Caesar salad with shrimp which was good. I wish the shrimp had been a little spicier. The service was good and the prices were reasonable, but certainly not cheap.

Beside from the place being crowded ALL the time, I could go here always. I usually get the fried pickles (yummy) and the salmon burger (also yummy) comes with fries which are AMAZING. I could order just fries and eat those. The chargrilled oysters are usually always on point when I have a taste for them Chimes is where I go. They also have an amazing brunch.

While I saw all the positive reviews I wasn't very optimistic about this restaurant. When we got out of the car the charbroiled grill aroma hit us head on and my taste buds perked up.We sat at the bar to have a couple of cocktails before dinner, bar staff super attentive with a long list on tap beers. We let the hostess know we were ready to be sat, while the restaurant seemed busy we were sat immediately.Chance the rapper was on server, he was attentive without hovering, nice work.  We ordered the mozzarella sticks, they were HUGE. The sticks were properly fried bc they were still full of cheese vs the typical hollow stick. A must try.We ordered the fried pickles which I am not usually partial to but these were delicious. The fried pickles came with homemade ranch dressing, perfect.My husband order the jalapeño burger and loved it. The jalapeños came deep fried making the burger FIRE! He really enjoyed it.This is our new go to restaurant."}, {"review_id": "r4BN5lJzs-1hlEWMK0wxfg", "user_id": "aF_fZpaPSFeMqTqGbc8nCA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "I've eaten here twice and I must say, I'm not impressed. The service is very good, but the food is lacking. The Chimes in Covington Louisiana is Much better! The food there appears to be given much more attention to detail and taste. The environment is also much better there. This Chimes always seems unattractive and somehow unkept. I gave it 2 Stars because of the servers, who deserve it. (They actually deserve 3, but I withhold that to not give people the idea that they should eat here) The place itself, unimpressive. It appears people go here to drink and be loud. Again, not impressive. It's more like a rowdy biker bar that serves food as a side option, than actually a restaurant. The owner should invest some time, money, and energy to bring this place up to par."}, {"review_id": "H6q19xj0EnzsLlCAwPKA8Q", "user_id": "cYpM7Ux2Lp2R0rgLVsxK6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/9/2017", "text": "Every time I come to Baton Rouge - I find my way here!
