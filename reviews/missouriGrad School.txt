A more realistic name for them should be \"Ivy League\" based on the their great sense of taste and dishes.This place will not disappoint the taste buds. This is your classic burger joint, and so much more.While the place is small, it gets straight to the point. You're not there to enjoy the sights and sounds, you're there to enjoy the food... And that is something that needs to be appreciated. While most places put a huge investment into a huge bulky restaurant scene, Grad School has invested that into their menu, and it shows.Don't worry about the inside... The atmosphere is still great. It's ensembled a bit like a classic burger joint, and it does have a few table seating options too.Get the fish tacos, they do them right!"}, {"review_id": "Xfd0gZBlr4XcLEWsoqY95A", "user_id": "hK6yIxs_JAE-l2swKVf-Kg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Had fish tacos on a Friday and they just were not very good.  The fish was overcooked and tough.  I would not go back."}, {"review_id": "KdRs9864OHvBvdoUIyZIXg", "user_id": "tLxohSdK76fQzxLK_q-UiQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Fantastic Burger and Fries.

Being local has made me defensive when I see prices jump up. But our recent trip to TN showed me just how reasonable it is here. While it has become a trendy spot it's still the best food around. They actually have a big variety and everything is amazing. They also have a fantastic vegetarian selection. I take back my previous review. This spot is still absolutely fantastic with great staff and fantastic food."}, {"review_id": "b3gjOoKTi9Tk093zDGYBaQ", "user_id": "yyY7r1xwdLXMajDuqURe8A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "The Rasta Pasta is excellent.

Always have a great meal every visit. I suggest you sit up on the counter and enjoy your meal while watching the cooks. I usually order the Cuban sandwich. It literally fell from heaven onto a plate.

Appetizer was stuffed mushrooms. I pleasant surprise as they were dressed with a marinara and shredded Parmesan cheese. Made for a very nice starter. Waitress checked back timely and took appetizer plates away at 10 minutes after being seated. Entrees arrived at 14 minutes in. Salad, Pickle & Jerk Chicken pressed sandwich. Salad was underdressed and over croutoned but cold, fresh & tasty. Jerk sandwich. Definitely spiced well. Bread was great. Presentation was good. Check was timely. I give it a 4 star only because of the need to clean up the open kitchen a bit more."}, {"review_id": "Xa100sTEpgFN_-GkB5RvRw", "user_id": "-50lprJ4kZ-XCM1hPU2vqg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/3/2017", "text": "Cute, little place. Front row seating to the grill if you want. Gets packed quick. The steak sandwich had a lot of flavor but the steak was so tough you couldn't bite into it. We had to cut it with a knife. The mushroom steak sandwich was ok. The mushrooms were flavorful. There was no avocado on it. It was like an avocado paste. The cheese was not melted.

A couple booths. Also had a bar that you can sit at and watch them cook. We were greeted with a smile right when you walk in the door. First time here and it wasn't bad at all. I had the full ride burger. Burger was cooked medium-medium well, which I prefer. You may want to specify because they don't ask. The fries were hot and extra crispy, you can tell they are hand cut. My daughter had the Mac and cheese and it was actually pretty tasty, not the box Mac and cheese most places serve. Penne pasta, creamy cheese sauce and some shredded Parmesan to garnish. The service was prompt and friendly. I prefer this place over black sheep honestly. The price wasn't bad, 10.50 for a burger and a side of fries. I will definitely come back here and try something else on their menu!"}, {"review_id": "V1TZTiXwPVBe8vfWamNW_g", "user_id": "yNqwz4p-_FfgbC1OYdPrAg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/15/2017", "text": "Dissapointed.

It came with a good portion of fries as well. The burger has a soft sharp cheddar cheese on it, so if you have never had that kind of cheese before then it's not gonna be what your use to. I would have preferred regular cheddar cheese opposed to soft. The staff was extremely nice and had no problems! My only knock on the place is that it is very small and loud.
