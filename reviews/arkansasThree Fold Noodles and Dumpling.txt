But seriously, it's really simple. Noodles, dumplings, and proteins. Three Fold Noodles & Dumplings is a no frills noodles and dumplings spot with an assembly line type set up. You choose your base, meats, veggies sauces, and that's it. It's super simple but it's done oh so right. I've tried all of their proteins and I can honestly say I've enjoyed them all. Their carrot slaw is also pretty amazing, it's just shredded carrot with a sweet, peanuty dressing. You won't be disappointed if you give them a shot."}, {"review_id": "3j0uPiPMK4BHbXdqNStW7A", "user_id": "qu_LB7rxZB0znxJULsuYaA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "This place has a cool ambiance and interesting menu. The dumplings were good, I liked the batter and the filling. They were a little dry but the dipping sauce balanced them really well. I was expecting more of a kick when I ordered a spicy variety.The noodle soup was okay, it seemed a little too salty. It also had half a head of lettuce tossed in. Would have expected some smaller, finely chopped greens in it as oppose to lettuce. The service was great, staff very friendly and the beer was good. It's certainly worth another try!"}, {"review_id": "z9PdKo0NE8vkqlhFI_wi8g", "user_id": "DYupRk5IIwsNDQLnmE0CSg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "It's a pretty \"hipster\" location with awesome contemporary setting, simple interiors, basic elements in terms of decor et al.Just saw the menu was a little less clear unlike the other restaurants you go to that have Oriental options aka Thai places.That said, the guys at the counter really helped out with the choices . Once ordered, the food came out in decent time , say 10 mins.Food was tasty, I asked for pan fried dumplings and they made them out good with tofu as protien. The noodle soup was great as well.Wondering why I'm giving a 4 star? There's a reason for that.I wanted to order a half and half, but wanted pan fried dumplings, they refused to give me the dumplings from my half and half on the side pan fried. This made me order more food than needed and I ended up wasting the noodles soup.I really wish they were a little flexible. Another thing that happened was that my friend asked for unsweetened tea and was over, when asked, he was told they won't be brewing it anymore. Eventually they did Brew it, but wish it was done in the first go.Good place, worth visiting and enjoyable food. Just a few quirks."}, {"review_id": "rlrx7lYCBQStfgL0GFnU8A", "user_id": "ViPcSvpJCf-IMffPrTnkoQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Decided to come here on a whim when i landed in Little Rock and my friend heard a few good things about this place from her co-workers.  The decor of the restaurant is a clean atmospheric look.  Upon entering it felt like a Chipotle style concept.  I ordered the half and half which was half dumplings and half noodles with shredded chicken.  We noticed that there were dumplings just laying out on plates that were already pre-made.  It took a while for us to get our food.  My food was warm, to almost cold which was not pleasing to eat. So was my friends bowl of noodle soup it was luke warm.  I feel like the food would be much better if it was served hot and steamy.  There was a lot of flavor but a little salty. It's a great addition to the Little Rock area."}, {"review_id": "9nrS_0La1DQ59Uy6sxpXhQ", "user_id": "fWiEWyUgVqI7tJ-aLhhvtw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "one of my favorite restaurants in Little Rock !

This place is just simply amazing! Great value for the quality and quantity of food you receive. I ordered the half noodles half dumplings and it was AMAZING. I  have been craving noodles and dumplings since my visit. Next time I go I will definitely be trying the pan-fried dumplings. I could not help but to look at my neighbors plate in envy of his pan-friend dumplings. This place has a clean hip look that is very inviting. I wish that Three Fold was a franchise and there would be the opportunity to have one in Texas because if so I can assure you I would be there on a daily basis. Make sure you try Three Fold if you are in the area; do not let this opportunity pass you by."}, {"review_id": "p1CQ4Gx_O3qdjZ4MITzEBg", "user_id": "gQ6e9YJ8avtZBDw4AI039Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "The food was great and i really enjoyed myself i would recommend this restaurant to othets"}, {"review_id": "TSn5WpjCKKJZfM3NGfe_kg", "user_id": "BBgh2-58CFQVfaBX2ionCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "I always love it here!

We ordered and received our food with in 10 minutes which made for a quick bite to eat for lunch. However, the food itself was not exceptional. It had flavor but the sauce overpowered the actual food in the 1/2 & 1/2 chicken bowl which made it difficult to enjoy because the sauce was just too much. We had the 1/2 dumpling 1/2 noodle chicken bowl, with a side of the fried sesame balls, and taro chips. The sesame balls were pretty good. The inside is a dough like texture with a cinnamon filling. The Tora chips were similar to potato chips but had a sugary/salty seasoning on them. They were also good. I'm giving this place a two star because the main course was not a satisfying meal."}, {"review_id": "a1cxrDY-eHFVQR8pC_BW6Q", "user_id": "TDo__BPGX1vZAPh4XBP_ew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "I have been hearing how great this place is so glad we got to give it a try. You walk in and go tho the front and order and they give you a number for the table. You can pick how hot you like your dish. I got not spicy at all, my hubs got some heat but my some got his pretty spicy. He loves spicy things but said next time he would not get it so spicy. He thought it kind of took away from the taste. Their noodles are wonderful. You can definitely tell they make their pasta. You also pick a protein with your bowl, I got chicken and hubby and son got pork. Service was excellent we did not wait much time at all.

It was easy to get to and the place was clean. I gave it three stars because I felt the staff was so so and the food so so. It's a really cool concept but just not executed well in my opinion. The food looks like it's been sitting for a while in a warmer and there's not a lot of side options available to add to it. So you basically are getting a couple dumplings.

First they offer tofu as a protein but it wasn't seasoned so my dumplings tasted like under cooked wheat flour covered in soy sauce. Second it took quite a while to get through the line, order, and get our food--which by itself isn't a huge deal. But after our food arrived, I had to remind them that they hadn't served our drinks. And finally they never brought our sesame balls! After the great up sell by the cashier I was looking forward to them! Maybe we caught them on an off day when they were slammed but as I'm not often in Little Rock this is likely my only opportunity to give them a try.

I hadn't made it in.Finally did! And it was worth the wait!I've heard a lot of people talk about how small of a space it is. It's not really, it feels open and spacious and brightly lit during the day, but seating is a bit tight, especially considering how popular Three Fold is for lunch.I can only confirm what nearly everyone else has already said. I had great service, it was a very nice place to sit and eat too, and the food was amazing. I got the chicken noodle bowl with everything, and said yes to the spicy sauce. It's not the hottest thing I've had by far, but it's the kind of spice that goes straight up your nose. Highly recommended!Also, Bubble Tea. Freakin' Bubble Tea.

We were STARVING by the time we got here after 8 miles of constant hiking, so we were more than ready for a big load of carbs! Parking was relatively easy to find (about 6pm at night) with street parking a little ways down. I like how clean it is and how accessible the silverware is, as well as how open the kitchen is with its steam all around and production. Friendly face behind the counter, and awesome concept on first look. Since I'm on this vegan roll nowadays, getting a bowl of tofu half & half (1/2 noodles, 1/2 dumplings) made me so happy! You take your number to a table and wait for it to come to you, and fill up on some water or soda while waiting. There's only one bathroom per gender, btw. On to the food itself... the noodles are accompanied by peanut sauce that's too salty, and the tofu is waaay too salty. Maybe it was just mine, but it was drenched in soy sauce. I liked the idea of the dumplings, but the skin was too thick for me to finish all parts of it- I ended up eating the \"meaty\" part and leaving the tops of the dumplings to trash when I got to the last three dumplings. I think this restaurant has a lot of potential because they're super accommodating and have a good base of a menu, but the salt really got to me this time! Maybe on the next trip out to Arkansas!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/three-fold-noodles-and-dumpling-little-rock?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
