The food was delicious; there were two really good, very spicy hot sauces, the chips were warm and the salsa was yummy. I had three tacos - 2 Pollo and 1 Pastor, both were very good, and the corn tortillas were really good, sturdy, crispy and soft at the same time, perfect. My boyfriend had a beef burrito, and he said his was really good, too. We got a side of rice and beans, the rice was pretty standard but the refried beans were really good and very authentic, as far as my experiences go. Service was quick, the restaurant is a very comfortable, casual place, the waitresses were quick and attentive, and for both of us to eat until we were stuffed plus two sides, was $15, which I still can't believe. We only got water this time, but the drinks were cheap, too. We will definitely be returning!"}, {"review_id": "ORi4TVpFikF7UxkmT5_ZYw", "user_id": "gZkIqVNh9LXh-n97dJx0SQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Good, REAL authentic Mexican food.

Parking is easy to find as it as a stand alone building with a parking lot. Upon entering, I was greeted and given a menu. I advised the young lady that I was ordering take out and she easily answered any questions I had about the menu. I ordered pork tamales, a shrimp, a beef cheek, and a al pastor taco. The tamales where tasty but had way too much masa around the meat. The tacos were also mediocre at best, just not enough flavor for my liking. While authentic, the food was not bursting with flavor as I have come to be used to when trying traditional Mexican food. There is another little hole in the wall taco shop that gives this place true competition..... be aware."}, {"review_id": "lFfeGKd8SApeeZX3f1ZkdA", "user_id": "xaMU9ekqIqHoD3Crs9IZSQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Best tacos I've eaten in a while. Prices are extremely reasonable with tacos at $1.50 and $2. I'd suggest the asada, lengua, or cabeza if you're feeling adventurous! The chips and salsa are not free but they're also worth the extra $1.50. We also ordered cheese and you could tell the quality was way better than at regular Mexican restaurants.

Maybe he built it up to much and my expectations were too high...Our table was dirty and super wobbly. This would have been super easy to overlook if t were the only issue.We got the chips and salsa. They were pretty good (chips were wayyyy under-salted) and inexpensive.I tried to order 3 different menu items and was told they didn't have them. This was frustrating to me. I ended up settling on the american style taco and the carnitas taco. Skip the American style taco. I was not impressed at all. The carnitas taco was really good. Not sure it's good enough for me to return, but I'm glad I tried the place."}, {"review_id": "mAc8iJ8OXbW9vr4hKtAMBg", "user_id": "RJK9mGPUKa_uH3lCnjnSgQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "I love fresh soft tacos! With only a few non-chain Mexican eateries in the area, The Tiki Taco is definitely an eatery that I will come to again and again for Taco Tuesday. You'll definitely miss this establishment as it's tucked away in this little hut beside a few law offices. With tacos ranging from $1.50-$2.00 each and fresh, that's a great deal for me! I ended up ordering 4 soft tacos. 2 pork tacos, 1 fish, and I shrimp. I was lowkey bummed they were out of chicken. All of the tacos I ordered were delicious. The flavor of the meats were spot on! Only knock I would say about the tacos are the tortillas. I've had better tortillas. They were very bland, dry, and the texture felt like they came straight out the pack with very little heat. The service was pretty good. Nothing over the top or special, but acceptable. I'll be back."}, {"review_id": "RmZN5u_ROxoUcNUx-lzUxw", "user_id": "lWOjMHX5qkIa1frJhEy7gw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/22/2017", "text": "First visit. I wanted to love it, I really did.After seeing the good reviews and having various friends recommend it, I had high expectations.Unfortunately for me, they were not met. Other members in our party enjoyed their food, but I did not.I ordered the chicken nachos. According to the menu this includes: chips topped with seasoned chicken, lettuce, pico de gallo, sour cream black beans and cheese sauce. I asked for the pico on the side. When I got the nachos, it also had avocado on it, which was a welcomed addition. Unfortunately it was a little on the hard side and I could not cut it with my fork, so I did not end up eating it. And I did not have any black beans, instead I had pinto beans, which I don't care for. It was also topped with shredded cheese, which again, was a welcomed addition, but unfortunately it took the place of most of  the cheese sauce, which left it a little dry.My husband had the carne asada burrito and he enjoyed it. Another member of our group had various sopas and he enjoyed them.Like I said, I wish I had enjoyed my experience as much as everyone else did.But I would be very willing to give it another try."}, {"review_id": "-e-DUwjYF9w4yFRkijCISA", "user_id": "IeiTHfzaNfNcMNV0C97Vug", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Sorry but had to take one star away.

We could tell immediately that the place was legit. Simple, clean, and doing a bustling business to a mostly Mexican crowd. Everyone was friendly and welcoming, and we got tacos, tamales, beers, and Micheladas for me (didn't see it on the menu but I read another review that said they do it, and they do it well, rimming your huge Styrofoam cup with lime juice, coarse salt, and special spicy goodness). The fish taco is the best anywhere! Light, flaky, and perfectly simple so you taste the freshness of the fish. The carnitas taco and pastor taco are fantastic, the chicken, Americano, and mutton tacos are very good as well. The house sauces are spicy and delicious. The red has a good amount of cilantro, so go for the green if you don't like that. I loved it! My first tamale was heavy on the masa, so I took the second to go for breakfast and was pleased to find it much meatier than the other. Perfect hangover breakfast with a  couple of fried eggs. Next visit, we will get adventurous and try the cabeza, tripe, chicharrones, and tongue tacos! Maybe one day we'll save room for dessert.UPDATE 12/16/17: Today I had the tongue and cabeza tacos and both were excellent, with tender, flavorful meat. Also tried a carnitas sope and it was incredible. Everything here is so fresh and delicious, we will be returning soon for more!"}, {"review_id": "bLZ0qQhFk3n0ONbAwUUAiw", "user_id": "B7V3hQOxiT_l9CGdhTOSzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Always good!

The Location: Its a little tricky. It is right on Rivers Ave. It not being on a side street or at a light, you will have to slow down amongst near high speed chase driving traffic to turn off on a short downhill driveway to get there. The sign isn't really large and pronounced so I had to put on the GPS to find it. Keep an eye out for it when on Rivers because it is very easy to miss. There is a small parking lot in the front that is shared with a lawyers office I believe, but the plus is they have a large parking lot in the back so no need to worry about parking.Its a pretty small place, with a covered porch out front with high top tables and high top bar seating. There are plenty of seats outside to eat which I definitely dig. Food:You order at the counter, give your name and take a seat. I ended up ordering 3 tacos, shrimp, fish and chicken along with one chicken tamale. So, first let me say the green salsa that came with the tamales is awesome. Its spicy as hell: flavorful perfection. The tamale on the other hand was mostly breading and very little filling. It tasted as if it was sitting for a while maybe..Im unsure, but pass on that.The tacos remind me of the tacos Ive had in San Diego for sure. They are small and pack some serious punch. The shrimp taco was my favorite--very flavorful, followed by the fish taco. Wasnt feeling the chicken taco. I ate the chicken first and was just like, meh, but then I had the shrimp one and was like OH HELL YEAH! So there was a notable difference for sure. Also, and this is important, is the shell was not stale and tasteless. It actually added to the taco, which is pretty important. I will mention that placed my order togo, and the tacos were all placed in a box together, along with the tamale, kind of killing the presentation, which doesnt matter as much, but if it had sat for a while, the moisture from not being wrapped individually would have my tiki taco experience mushy and moist. Ill eat in next time.Ill check out Tiki Taco again--try some of their other goodies. They have a pretty extensive menu, and it is really affordable. 3 tacos and the tamale were only $8. Just be careful when turning off of Rivers Ave."}, {"review_id": "Ck6O85oJf8W9vTmzlACS2Q", "user_id": "BX9rJpjLMshHZVnESFhhVw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/25/2017", "text": "I don't like giving bad reviews, but this place sure deserved it mostly because of service. Came In with a group of 4 today. The waitress sat us then didn't pay attention to us for 20 min. Wasn't too busy as the lunch rush had just ended. She was the only waitress so we thought ok, cut her a break. After walking by us again for about the 6th time, I told her we were ready to order. Instead she turned her back towards me and said, \"Ok\" and proceeded to help others and bus tables outside even though no one was waiting for a table. I think she heard us talking  about leaving and she finally stopped to take our order which takes only 1 min of her precious time to write down.Finally 30 min later we get to put in our order. I had a burrito while others in my group ordered a torta, few tacos, and a quesadilla with sodas. The Mexican food here is subpar. Definitely not worth the wait that we endured. We ended up dousing everything in their red hot sauce to make it have some flavor. To sum it up.. The quality of food is about 3 stars at most. The service makes you never wanting to go back."}, {"review_id": "e3ZxKm7_VxCVmit9xiegDg", "user_id": "6iopTREHgTcw_fzQP8UAtg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "Moved here from Arizona and anytime I'm homesick this place takes me back instantly!

A perfect place for lunch, and such a value. Menu is full of tacos, sopes, burritos, tamales and more. Then you can choose from multiple meats to fill them, like pastor, pollo, asada, lengua, shrimp, and more. My favorite is the asada sopes, a perfect sized serving of meat on a crispy fried masa disc. I really wanted to try their tamales, but they were out so I will have to return. The inside is small with various 2 & 4 top tables, but there's a large covered patio out front.

We got there and they were pretty dead but our waitress never seemed to be around. We waited what seemed like forever to get our check (you pay at the counter) and we had a movie date planned, so we didn't really have time to sit around.
