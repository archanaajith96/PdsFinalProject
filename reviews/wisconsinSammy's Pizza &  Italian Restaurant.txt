Sammy's in Green Bay is a real gem for the city.  I love coming here for their delicious food and wonderful memories that come back to me.  One of these times (I promise, next visit!), I'm going to go off program and try one of their pasta dishes."}, {"review_id": "o1BHjLsOT6uxDwPiLuSmoA", "user_id": "EZohX8Q5fSA-z4KAunHCdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/3/2017", "text": "We just got off the interstate to take a picture of Lambeau Field in Green Bay, WI, and happened to be driving down a local road and found Sammy's Pizza.

The place was dead when we arrived for our late lunch. We were seated and taken care of right away. We started off with the bruschetta and garlic bread. The bruschetta was delicious and the garlic bread was good but nothing extraordinary. The dipping sauce was tasty. I ordered the gnocchi with creamy tomato sauce and sausage. The sausage was the best I have ever had by far. The gnocchi was homemade and delicious as well. The services was good and we all left stuffed! I would come back if I lived in the area.

The sausage was so good and we found out the reason why is that it is home made. They've been doing it for 59 years!! We went for the Crazy Italian pizza. No skimping on ingredients, this pie was loaded with that awesome sausage, pepperoni, cappicola, genoa salami, pepperoncini, fresh garlic and basil topped with mozzy and asiago cheese. We love mushrooms so we added them to the pie. Just as at Papillions Pizza in Rothschild they gave us the choice of fresh or canned shrooms! Why would anyone want canned? The crust was the perfect thickness with the right amount of sauce. We were in our glory! Our server was attentive without being in the way and performed perfect service. No doubt this will be our go to pizza place when we are in GB!"}, {"review_id": "Xlp_yyyo7BBwBN4rAteoPQ", "user_id": "Jb3LHBGQ1cP8vL8b9sS-vA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "By far my favorite pizza in the Green Bay Area.

We are staying in Green Bay for a week and decided to try Sammy's based on Yelp reviews. As usual the users did not lead us wrong. We ordered the bruschetta as an appetizer. It was phenomenal but I felt it was overpriced and that is why I'm giving a four star rating as opposed to what I feel was a five star meal. There were only 5 pieces of bruschetta and it was 9 dollars. My daughter ordered the 10 inch BBQ chicken pizza. It was perfect with the right ratio of bbq sauce, chicken, cheese, and onions.My son ordered the pepperoni pizza and it tasted like \"old school\" traditional authentic pizza. The crust was thin and crispy and the sauce was delicious, not too sweet, not too salty.My husband ordered the Italian beef sandwich. The bread was crusty and perfect for dipping in the well seasoned au ju. Regular bagged chips was the side. They were unimpressive and he didn't eat them.I ordered the soup, salad, and breadstick. My salad was a called a garden salad and it had lots of fresh veggies and tender greens. I appreciated it not being iceberg lettuce. I ordered the tomato basil soup topped with feta cheese. Outstanding! I want more! The breadstick was the perfect soft accompaniment for dipping in the soup.We had great service and were promptly served and our drinks never went empty.Our total bill was $66. We brought home leftover pizza."}, {"review_id": "s17_QxToeH6Ymm9CRqJzQQ", "user_id": "OjduazvYIzn7SP9KsniWBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2017", "text": "Back in the 80's or early 90's I drove semi for Allied Van Lines (SPD Division).  My truck broke down & had to spend the night.  The repair shop told me about \"Sammies Pizza\".I took a cab & had the best pizza ofmy life.  For the next 2 days I wasin the UP of Mi. & back to Green Bay.  Each night I was at \"Sammies Pizza\", before leaving for Chicago.The thin crust thick cheese w/Italian sausageeach night.  I am 74 years old & have tried to find a pizza any where in this great country to come close with no luck.  I now live in NC & plan a trip it WI this summer.  God willing, \" Sammies Pizza\"  here I come."}, {"review_id": "7XJrBPeiJB8FCMTp4lMIFg", "user_id": "qKqjCBIMAYBAxg3ZgfJloA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/12/2017", "text": "This is a great choice if you feel like dining out for pizza. I'm sure it's just as good when taken out, but we enjoy visiting this place. They have a great selection of draft beer and the service is excellent. The atmosphere is comfortable and you can usually get a seat fairly quickly, even on a weekend night. If you're a fan of a thinner crust, they have some of the best pizza you'll find in Green Bay. Our server brought two \"Where's Waldo\" books that kept my antsy kid occupied until the pizza arrived, which is always fairly quickly. They have an extensive menu of other items if you're not feeling pizza. I haven't personally tried anything but the pizza, but the dishes served around us looked phenomenal.

That unfortunately was a bad decision. The place is quaint, and has a vintage feeling. We ordered a pepperoni, sausage, mushroom & onion pizza. When the pizza came it hardly had any toppings, we had a hard time determining which half had the onions on it. They advertise a thin crust pizza, which it was. The problem is it was hard and tasted like cardboard. A cheap frozen pizza has a better crust than Sammy's. The sauce was flavorless. Overall, it was the worst pizza we have ever had. I would not recommend getting their pizza, maybe their other food is good."}, {"review_id": "cF1OVhEiP9_Bziy3RgV50g", "user_id": "oViqEqzfvZgvNZqNrvSK-g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/3/2016", "text": "Sammy's is a place which I only get pizza.  Their other menu items look very good for a family Italian style pizza restaurant but their pizza is so good we never get anything else and they do their pizza perfectly for the type that it is.  The pizza they serve is very specific - thin and crunchy crust (with a very good flavor), homemade tasty pizza sauce, great homemade sausage and the usual other pizza toppings.  If you are a fan of thin crust this is as good as it gets in this area.  The sauce itself is light and put on the pizza with a light touch and not slathered thickly on.  The toppings are generally in good proportion to each other and the cheese is not to heavy or to light.Service gets a touch spotty at times and wait times can get long as they get very busy on weekend nights.Sammy's is an institution in the area and has a well deserved reputation for great thin crust pizza."}, {"review_id": "tw8z37HOgzqeYo1-VHWDGw", "user_id": "q9P69PBiw-oa6TwOj22Wsw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/11/2016", "text": "We stopped by Sammy's for a quick bite and I was very happy with our meal.
