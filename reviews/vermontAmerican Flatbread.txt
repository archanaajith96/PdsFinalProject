I Tom a seat at the bar and the bartenders were friendly and helpful.One suggested I order a half and half large, so I'd have a little leftovers. I ordered the Cheese and Herb with Mozzarella and Gran Padano Cheese plus garlic oil on one half, Pepperoni and Peppers (green peppers, red onion, pepperoni, red sauce) on the other with an addition of mushrooms. The large is huge. I took 90% of the pizza home. At least I like leftovers and it did help raise money for a worthy cause.I also ordered a half pint of Zero Gravity Dornbusch, a dark sour lager (only $3!). Delicious. The taste? Amazing. A really nice thin crust with a great cheese blend and toppings. I like the ambiance, classic rock playing, and the service.It's a great pizza place."}, {"review_id": "9f7rmgMwaoKLlf4lF733QQ", "user_id": "gTi2vONyw3jbOaZro1wyig", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/19/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Thought we would pop in for a beer and a pizza to go. We've really enjoyed eating their pizzas fresh, so I thought it would make great take-out. Not so.We ordered an Evolution salad and a half-and-half pizza - Vermont Sausage and Power to the People. The salad came out quickly, but the pizza took a surprisingly long time. We only live ten minutes away, and the pizza was not even remotely warm. Half of the crust was burned, the other half done just right. Sausage was fatty. I thought that when you order a half-and-half pizza, it would be made it at the same time on the same dough, like any other place. But they clearly pieced together different pizzas cooked at different times...and charge $2 extra.I'll come back to eat in-house and take leftovers home, but will never again order takeout from Flatbread. We'll leave take-out to Leonardo's!"}, {"review_id": "9apun3lSFiBLHG_pBtX2-g", "user_id": "Z4wvyYC58FLjjPSPa0de1Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "A found this gem because a friend of mine Winnie recommended coming to this place while in Burlington. And what a great finding it was!So I checked out this place during a road trip to Vermont, and we all came during dinner time on the weekend and there was about 20 minute wait for 4 of us (2 guys 2 gals). Anyhow, we immediately got seated outside and we were sharing two of the larger portion flatbread. I remembered one of them was Vermont local sausage which came with sundried tomatoes, mushroom, cheese and herbs, and another one the special of the day (I forgot what it was..but it DEFINITELY had meat in it - can't live without 'em!). The pizza came out pretty quick and it was amazing! Granted, it technically was not a pizza, it was more of a flatbread but who cares..as long as it tasted good! The bread was flaky in a good way and all of the ingredients tasted fresh. Or maybe we could just be hungry. But anyhow, the portion was pretty big. 4 of us were able to finish these but I definitely was definitely more fuller than I expected. Also, the we spent less than $15 per person for that dinner, which was a pretty good thing considering we were on a holiday.American flatbread, you really make the America proud considering you were claiming it in your name! I definitely highly recommend this place if you are visiting Burlington!"}, {"review_id": "jCBaRV2jKZlqZCPGbrmsDg", "user_id": "Rvn-Ymc8_9z4vbcm2ZwenQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "A classic pizza and beer joint but with an artisan touch. After seeing the reviews we decided to come here for dinner and boy was it the perfect place after a day at the slopes! The flatbreads are delicious! We ordered a large and did half and half. My husband and I both agreed the new Vermont sausage won over the two. And then there's the fact that Zero Gravity is on site for some amazing local brews! Talk about a fantastic pairing. After talking to the staff and trying a couple of different brews we each made our selections and at the end of the night even decided to take a growled to go for us to enjoy at our inn. If you are in Burlington, this spot is definitely a must try!"}, {"review_id": "MXP22PWQRT4hOeSNdZYTrw", "user_id": "FOSFozgyzNfV_GqjTjGQ8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "We were visiting Burlington for the first time this past weekend and our friends brought us here. We arrived around 8:30 and there was about a half hour wait. We waited by the warm fire place and they gave us a cute pizza place holder. The atmosphere and decor in this restaurant is incredible. There is a full bar and large selection of drinks. We were seated in a booth for four and had a sweet waitress who was filling out drinks for us often. You can order small or large flatbreads--large you can share with a group! We each wanted to try different ones so we all got small ones (they range from $11-13) depending on the toppings. the pizzas here are cooked on flatbreads and they are delicious! I will definitely be back here. There are other options on the menu, including extra toppings, to personalize your pizza! I will definitely be back here."}, {"review_id": "qKZB1i4vbe3o_TYMhIZbwg", "user_id": "NCqcGbjEDsuPE_jPzldGPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Large half and half. So good.

They have Zero Gravity brewing here - you can see them working through the window on the way to the bathroom. However, no flights :(. You can also get your brewery passport stamped here. The Evolution salad that came with my lunch special was fantastic - shaved carrots with seeds and celery with a light dressing. And the portion was pretty large!  The flatbread was okay -- the toppings landed mostly in the middle with little to none around the outside. I got the special of the day which had corned beef. They also have a vegetarian special as well. Nice patio out back for those pretty days in Vermont and for your pup!"}, {"review_id": "cNc8TauPbj96gkTZzeOR4A", "user_id": "CRQcSN7nTpQiQX60NOojjw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/7/2017", "text": "This place is just amazing. Second time here. There's always a long wait but if you're lucky you can slide into the bar, which we did. Great bar staff, selection of local beers from Zero Gravity, great wine too. Awesome soup special or spicy sweet potato soup which hit the spot after mountain biking all day. Pizzas are delicious, full of flavor, and delicious. They have GF for $4, which I normally would get but I was just going for it this evening haha. They also allow you to split pizzas into two types so if you're torn between what kind you want, you can get two! So we got sausage split with pepperoni, and a truffle veggie special split with I forget the name but it was a basic tomato and cheese pizza. We loved every single one but the sausage one and truffle veggies were the best. Really the only downside is ALL they have is pizza. I didn't realize this my second time and had wanted to break it up with a couple of appetizers or something. But their pizza is absolutely amazing so it was fine. Atmosphere is fun, lively and comfy. You can dress up a little, or show up in jeans, or muddy bike gear like we did."}, {"review_id": "GD4tswlkBgZxd3ayeV62kg", "user_id": "hbrZAIK4tuwsg7uc5cJOdg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "I have a hard time finding good GF pizza but this place hit the spot.

Crayons, Melissa and Doug Pizza party toys, etc.#3 Local beer. Vermont beer is delicious! We can probably drink a trough of it but then, there won't be any space for pizza.#4 Their pizzas are awesome. I'm a sucker for thin crust/flatbread pizzas. We tried four different flavors and they were all fantastic. My husband wasn't a big fan of the tomato sauce they used but I liked it a lot. Too each his own I guess.

This place fills up on weekday nights so I would recommend reserving a table or be willing to wait. All the pizzas and salads use local products, cheese etc when possible which was pretty cool. I tried the special salad which had an excellent, local bleu cheese, cranberries and a vinaigrette. I regret not ordering additional toppings at a additional cost. The pizza/flatbread is cooked and assembled in the main dining area which made the place smell divine.  I recommend the maple sausage pizza (forget the exact name) as it was loaded with mushrooms and sausage which was slightly sweet from the maple. Really well done. In addition, they have an assortment of Vermont ciders and brews. The Citizen Cider was very good.

The place wasn't super packed (although definitely not empty), and we were able to sit without any wait. We opted to sit outside since it was an absolutely beautiful day out. Their outdoor section is essentially in an alleyway between their building and the neighboring one, but with enough room for all the tables they had set up out there as well as what looked like an outdoor POS system and drink machine well.From what I remember, each of us ordered a flatbread with either a soup or salad. We were all happy with our selections (my veggie pizza of the day in particular was very good), but our server seemed very distracted and took forever in between visits and when it was time to pay the bill. From what I could tell, it wasn't because of being super busy with other customers, but he would wander around and disappear for periods of time when we wanted to place our food order, get more beer, and pay the bill. I think we had to flag down another server or manager at one point, and we ended up giving our bill to someone else because he was nowhere to be found.While not rude in any sense, he wasn't particularly nice or welcoming, and did not know what the daily specials were, so that in addition to his sloth's pace in serving our table certainly knocked my review down a star.Given the sheer amount of places to go in Burlington, I can't say I'd go back although the food was pretty good."}, {"review_id": "svJ8f9XylUZfIWzqbU2TYA", "user_id": "GzsHWRhZf4XUKODKiAeM1w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/27/2017", "text": "We tried their pizza which was on the specials for that night, a thin crust with zucchini, coriander, tomatoes and yes, BLACK BEANS .
