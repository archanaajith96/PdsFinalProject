We check out this cool roof top bar spot. It's had local beers and full bar. The Revolver beer with Texas honey was delicious for the night. They do own mix drinks and local cocktails. The atmosphere was great for Friday night of young professionals, lively, with room to move around and seats. Tip this place is a full restaurant. I did not have a chance to try, but would come back to try out their menu. I would come here for date spot or drinks with friends."}, {"review_id": "LJ80OtDoACilhskro5_vvQ", "user_id": "Xp2TrC38rk2fnZdFqgSfBQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I have visited HG Supply a few times, and it is consistent place for a innovative meal.  If your tired of the same kit of parts, I must say they offer new options and renditions.   I chose their housemaid Quinoa Burger, composed of smoky carrot hummus, smashed avocados, Kalamata tapenade, baby spinach and tomato, on a toasted Empire bakery bun, with an accompanying macerated kale salad.   Meal was tasty, and the burger was quite flavorful.One downside, the restaurant has acoustical issues, as noted by others as well.   But it is definitely a fun place to hang with friends, or escape solo.   Rooftop patio is a big draw, along with the cocktail program.Glenn Almack"}, {"review_id": "Mhs69wgYdVZwAsI1-TLthA", "user_id": "w6pIFWHhsP4HE7Kuv9tf-g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Atmosphere and location are great. Go up to the roof to enjoy the view, a cocktail, and the people watching. Meal in the downstairs:- Cannot recommend their mussels in coconut milk appetizer enough. We got extra bread (no charge) to dip into the leftover coconut milk. I could live off that appetizer.- As far as the bowls go, I think some bowls are hits and others are misses.  All of the proteins are good, I would especially recommend the duck confit. I would dissuade people from the zuchini \"pasta\" and note that the yellow curry is very soupy. -If you are going to build your own bowl, use the brussel sprouts as a base. AMAZING. If not, get them as a side, they are sizable for $8 and very good. on the sweet (honey) side, so note that if you're not into sweet."}, {"review_id": "CTK14O6cCFVY7pOoX2tQlA", "user_id": "hX5qvn4PUE9_3LxUyuigBQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "The food here was a little salty but it would be a great place for a happy hour.

This time was better - mainly because we stayed away from the Hunted and Gathered nonsense and went with normal dishes. My burger was quite good, albeit extremely messy (also a good thing!), and the fries had good flavor but were barely warm. We all really enjoyed the avocado and corn toast which was big enough for the 3 of us to share. I would even get it as a small entree. Very filling and very good!One friend had the curry butternut squash soup and she really enjoyed it. The other had the duck fried \"rice\" and also enjoyed it.

Stopped in for Sunday brunch with a friend on a somewhat bi-polar Dallas weather day. We started off wanting to eat on the upstairs patio, thought it would be too chilly, BUT was pleasantly surprised when we went up there and the overhead heaters plus gorgeous fireplaces all around had that outdoor patio toasty warm! Staff was extremely upbeat and friendly,  but alas, they do not serve brunch on The patio on Sunday! Boooo! We were sad, but everything else about the experience was great (so not enough for me to take a star away).To note: they had a limited bar food menu available upstairs - Nachos etc.So back downstairs we were seated promptly - host/hostess were pleasant, server was pleasant,  the food - excellent! The house bowls are always a good bet for me and this time I ordered the \"Gathered\" Yellow Curry with Grilled Salmon and avocados. What a delicious blend of flavors! Sweet potatoes, cauliflower, kale, cilantro, sliced red chilies etc. etc. on top of perfectly grilled salmon. Yummy, yummy, YUMMY! I asked for some bread to soak up some of the delicious broth, and my waiter brought some nicely, lightly toasted slices. Once again I left full and happy.Def one of my go-to spots in Dallas to have some good food and drinks AND great service!"}, {"review_id": "5lqBnTL6EW2SNS_XgIID8g", "user_id": "bNFvdGf1UiQ0FZbFZvwLtQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "We were disappointed to see that there was an hour thirty minute wait when we got there on a Saturday night. We asked the hostess if we would be able to have dinner at the rooftop bar. Excitedly, we ran up the two flights of stairs just to see that there was a limited menu. Disappointed yet again, we made our way out to leave. On our way out we saw seats in the front patio which Michael, who later turned out to be our server, gladly offered us. They seated us almost immediately outside. HgSupply Co has a huge menu with a variety of dishes. I like the \"bowl\" option where you can choose your protein and how you want it. There are so many options such as in soup, over pasta, etc. I had the yellow curry with chicken which was amazing but i had to ask for a side of brown rice just because that's what I'm used to. But let's get to what really matters in this post. Michael's service is what deserves this five star review. He was attentive, made great recommendations and even offered us blankets to keep warm. He also heard that it was my birthday and brought out some rosé for the table.  Thanks for making our experience extra special!"}, {"review_id": "M7y4ph7kfqVlb8Ewu3rrmQ", "user_id": "0IsswI9909_A6eG_8ny05g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "I've been here a couple of times and enjoyed drinks on the rooftop.  The drinks are good (a little pricey but what do you expect for that part of town) and also the appetizers are pretty good."}, {"review_id": "mt-j-wcH2dWF00k4vYBejg", "user_id": "v2OWDAnFwbmndlIfmMjVUA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "This place is worth every 5-star review it's received.

Other relevant information: - I recommend the Cider 75. It's slightly tart and VERY delicious. If, however, you're more of a beer person, they have plenty of local beers available to order. - Definitely check out the rooftop.

They have downstairs dining that is inside and outside. Alittle small so make a reservation on weekends. We headed up stairs to the rooftop bar area. We couldnt find a table but found a ledge to place drinks on. There are servers that go around to take food and drink orders. We ordered from them and also at the bar. There are some games behind the bar area, tv's, and fire places. Great place to get drinks on a nice day. Good for big or small groups. If your a big group get there early for a table.

You can't go wrong with the True Grit, but I tried the Duck \"Fried\" Rice and it was delicious. The duck was cooked well, and the brussels sprouts had a nice char. My father also really enjoyed his steak. Keep in mind that if you order the brick chicken, it takes about 20 minutes to cook so order fast!

I guess I should add to that: I shouldn't judge a restaurant based on one visit. One thing I can say I loved about both visits: the cocktails--not weak, not overpowering... as Goldilocks would say, \"It was just right.\" On my second visit, I ordered another house bowl. The burger bowl with the bibb (lettuce, avocado, over-easy egg, sweet potato hash)... and ohhhh, the sweet potato hash. Soft but not mushy with the perfect amount of seasoning. So good! The burger was good, seasoned and cooked medium well as requested. My husband ordered the beef braised short rib... wow! So full of flavor. Tender. Juicy. He was impressed. I was impressed. It's a definite must try. This time I sat inside... while I loved the outdoor area the first time, it was pouring the rain and hailing off and on. The inside is loud. Loud music. Lots of people talking over the music. While the atmosphere could be considered romantic, I would definitely give this more of a classy bar-type feel due to the volume. Just before sunset, staff served champagne glasses to every person in the restaurant. And at sunset, a manager stood on a chair, turned the music down, and she gave a sunset-champagne toast with a very tasty blood-orange beer. What a nice touch! It gave a trendy, upscale restaurant/bar a very personal vibe and shows the customers that they care. Overall 4.5 stars for this visit. Previous:I didn't love it... well. Not the food anyway. The ambience was great. We sat outside in the back. The weather was perfect--October. There were only a few tables outside in the back so it was quieter, which was nice, considering there were eight ladies out for my birthday. We were able to talk and hear each other without yelling. Decor was modern/earthy... strong smell of rosemary--in the bathroom it was overwhelming, and I love rosemary. The food was... meh. Eight ladies=eight meals. No one shared because we wanted to try each other's food, so we all ordered something different. I'm not vegan, but I typically enjoy plant based food. I had the quinoa meatballs. Save your money and pull up All Recipes. I've made better. They were bland. Quinoa absorbs the flavor of the foods you mix it with. I think these were mixed with cardboard. Another friend ordered a quinoa meal and said basically the same--unimpressed. And she is vegan and uses quinoa a lot as well. I will say, the girls who ordered real meat were the happiest with their food. But no one was raving. So then we ordered the chocolate kettle bell.... because... so cool!!! But once they poured the magic melting sauce over it and it finally caved in... the magic ended. Everyone took one bite--maybe two to give it another try, just in case their taste buds had taken a break from their meal--then put their forks down. Not worth the calories. So overall, nothing was bad, but nothing was great... except the ambience and the upstairs rooftop bar. We took a tour of the rooftop bar when we were done. I would go back just for drinks to sit up there on a nice night."}, {"review_id": "ov2wN6NQ4szaJjiBK0ipUQ", "user_id": "jDVTMvaSWWhkaxbL-KslgQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I came here for a birthday party with a group of ten.
