The atmosphere was friendly, upbeat and fun. My party of four was seated immediately (Thursday night). The live music added to the ambiance. It is loud, so if you want to have an intimate conversation, you may want to choose a different restaurant. My waitress was attentive but not overbearing, and the servers were extremely polite and helpful.I was really disappointed in the food. I ordered the Navajo Chicken, which was over cooked. My chicken and baked potato were tough and my green beans were limp and greasy. They do serve the fountain drinks in cool mason jars though! Unfortunately, I will not return."}, {"review_id": "GWMPEk7fm7NfRFgjSvYCqQ", "user_id": "8v3fSLa0GeynPcrz9UELIw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "IHG is one of the best places in Jackson to dine for millennials and families alike. It has a wide range of food selections and the bar is superb. I have eaten at IHG at least 10 times. The only reason I did not give it a 5 is because I ordered a turtle cheesecake to go and when I got home it was stiff and tasted old.

First time here for dinner tonight with some girl friends. I ordered the Delta stuffed catfish. Catfish was pecan encrusted, stuffed with crab meat, topped with a lemon dill cream sauce. Instead of mashed potatoes, I got asparagus.The catfish was nicely pan fried and seasoned. That sauce was so good, I used it to dip all my veggies in it. I didn't taste much dill or lemon, it was rich and creamy, consistency reminded me of slow turned butter. Now, their honey butter is another story! I don't know what they all put in that thing, but it was so delicious, I forgot my friends were there. They said I had a out of body experience haha. I asked our server if they sold the butter (I was serious) because I wanted some to take home! They do not =*(They had a live blues band, music wasn't too loud that we couldn't hear ourselves talk. They start every table off with some chips and salsa. Place was busy tonight, but it's two stories, so we were seated fairly quickly. We all really enjoyed our dinner and entertainment. Only thing is parking lot is big, but was so full, took me 15 mins to find parking.Also there's like a music museum upstairs that's like a wax museum but free! Gotta check it out. I included some pics and menu."}, {"review_id": "vlrvhvwnMzKpWlYTxfDwiQ", "user_id": "0mbpZKwbdZTM0rhehWUodg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Really like the place. Its pretty big, warehouse type atmosphere. Had fried broccoli as appetizer with a queso sauce to dip in, so yummy! Had the chipotle shrimp fajitas(sorry took pic after i piled in sour cream, etc)..it was very good with the mango salsa. Husband had ribs with honey chipotle, very good. friend had bayou pasta, she loved it!! Desserts sounded to good to pass up, but since it was my cheat day, why not! Friend had brownie dessert, husband had chocolate ice cream pie(this alone would make us come back-awesome!!) for the same price as 1 dessert, you can get trio of praline cheesecake, the white chocolate chip bread pudding and brownie dessert. I am stuffed! Oh and the frozen margarita with a red sangria swirl was very good!"}, {"review_id": "ZUfUzFCFO6-Dy43KDocH6A", "user_id": "fSsKVtNrfYMBzslqi5YkTw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Don't patron here if you want good food in a timely manner and great customer service.....The food and the service was poor.  After speaking with the manager regarding an issue with our food, I know why this place has gone down.  He literally brushed off what I thought was a legitimate complaint; our server forgot to put in the food order for one of the people in our party.  When I told him that the food order wasn't put in and that the food should be comped, he asked me but was something wrong with the food.  I've never been so disrespected in my life. I was taken aback by his comment and said if you need to know what's wrong with the food, how about it was never ordered or the fact that the mistake wasn't realized until after several inquires about the food.  He still did not  think that receiving food over an hour after the initial order was placed was a problem.  Several things went wrong during this visit. Our waitress took our drink orders immediately; however, it took us 30 minutes to receive our drinks.  I literally had to inquire about them.  It makes no sense that they kept replenishing those salty chips, but we couldn't receive the drinks that we eventually had to pay for.  When our food did arrive, the majority of the orders were wrong which lead to our checks being wrong too.  I will never visit this establishment again.  The manager was not friendly or helpful and apparently he doesn't think great customer service is a priority.I gave them one star because our server did apologize."}, {"review_id": "zU9HtKPDCvZ3HI_9oBGBww", "user_id": "u64p3GEoMDps1KRPUG4wTQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/13/2017", "text": "We came to try Iron Horse Grill out for the first time today for lunch. The building setup is nice and there was some nice live jazz music; however, it was very loud. To me it seemed like a kinda weird mix going on, at least today. The menu was very Tex-Mexish with elements of southern cuisine, but they also had BBQ and were serving breakfast/brunch. It looked like you could get made to order omelets and pancakes downstairs, but I didn't really check it out.    I couldn't decide what I wanted and since I've eaten Mexican a lot lately I got catfish. It was mediocre. The filets are thick, but also heavily breaded. I think there are multiple places around town to get better catfish. The fries were soggy and flavorless and the slaw had a ton of mayo/liquid.The chips brought to the table before hand are really good and flavorful. The salsa is a little bland, but ok.I think I'd go back because it seems like a cool place, but I'd try something else. Don't think I could recommend the catfish."}, {"review_id": "dcfPIzRl0h4buhAWwoGcww", "user_id": "qYIjtalcQ-gd319CkhA0aA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Don't go here!!! Went a year ago when I called in an order of fried broccoli,  got there in 30mn and they were STILL COOKING it and once I got a chance to try it they were EXTREMELY SALTY!!! Fast forward to tonight,  line of ppl around the corner and police there- clearly past capacity- parking lot here and across the street both FULL and after 4 rides around the corner and back I lucked up to pick up my to go order. Bayou shrimp pasta and stuffed jalapenos were beyond mediocre and completely not worth it. 1 star for presentation- somebody put pasta which is heavy on top of peppers so they got smashed but had a slightly appealing flavor.0 stars because you don't have CARRYOUT PARKING or adequate parking capable of meeting your capacity limit inside and the staff are not welcoming or attentive!!2 stars for \"chipotle ranch\" from the peppers- the best part of my meal SADLY, the pasta literally tasted like cream of chicken smothered on lots of pasta but NO MEAT other than 2 slivers of shredded sausage and 1 medium sized shrimp!!! SMFHOverall I wish I could give this place 0 stars because it seems like it's going to always be something but I will NEVER return and highly DISAPPROVE if you seek great customer service, timely food preparation or even the ability to park so you can wait just to get in!!"}, {"review_id": "vf6-4cFVy2-b5O42H6BSoA", "user_id": "4-YQeM3o4z5XiMq3JPCsig", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/30/2017", "text": "This is a go to place when people visit and they want a taste of what jackson is.

It's a historic site. The restaurant has been remodeled and is very opened. There are televisions behind the bar and a stage for live music. I was here having dinner with my brother and sister in law. We started off with the hand battered fried broccoli with queso. Yes, it sounds disgusting but it was so good. Thumbs up to a unique dish that taste great. For an entree I had the shrimp and grits. The entree wasn't as memorable for me. It didn't taste bad, but I just don't recall any mouth watering, let me order it again type vibes. However, I did try  the Etta James. This was vodka mixed with muddled strawberries, basil, lime and simple syrup. The beverage was very good, there were way too many strawberries. They kept getting stuck in my straw. Another interesting thing I noticed was that the menu had a lot of Mexican dishes. I couldn't tell if they want to be a soul food restaurant or what they are going for.

My usual go-to is the stuffed catfish, which is phenomenal. My other favorite is the ribeye. A little pricey, but definitely a lot of food. The complimentary chips and salsa is always a plus, as is the extensive drink menu. The live music is great, but it can also be hard to talk to others at your table. So, if you're wanting an intimate dinner, make sure it's when music isn't playing.

After all the issues they had with the city after it burned, I never thought they would reopen. I'd honestly forgotten about it.But I'm glad they rebuild. This place is beautiful inside and out! Nice well lit secured parking lot. Located just on the edge of the downtown area.Live music...But it's loud! So you won't be having much conversation while the band is playing. But it was also pretty loud when the music wasn't playing. Just people talking and enjoying themselves. So if you're looking for some peace and quiet while you eat then the IHG is definitely not a place you'd want to visit. But I personally enjoyed every second I was there.We arrived around 9, Saturday night. Packed house! But we were seated in about 10 minutes. Soon as we sat down our waitress walked over. I hate I didn't get her name because she was great. Pretty blonde with a couple tattoos. She constantly checked on the people in the area making sure everyone was good. I ordered the stuffed catfish. It came with green beans and a loaded baked potato. That dish was delicious!!! My girl just stuck with the basic and had fried catfish with orka and Cole slaw. Not to bad on the pockets at all! My bill was around $48. I really enjoyed my time there.
