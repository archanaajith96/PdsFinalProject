One of the best pizzas of my life, & Walter and Judy could not be sweeter hosts. Proof that one doesn't need a fancy menu with dozens of choices - I'd much rather be assured of 100% success rate with anything on the menu! The house salad also had great flavor & was sized generously. We each got the NY pizza, & I opted for the ricotta. Each pizza is made fresh to order by Walter himself! Seriously what a gift to the Reno area that they opened up shop here! One meal and you will feel like they've been your friends forever. I loved that so many fellow patrons were regulars and knew them personally. Just a great, family environment. I am so in awe of all they do - look at their mission statement. They employ people with disabilities, proving that many can hold jobs when given proper training and a supportive environment. Be sure to read some of the articles on their walls - very inspiring. Walter & Judy make the world a much better place, & the world of authentic NY style pizza more delicious and competitive. Enjoy!"}, {"review_id": "nHcz4ncmzHzo3lFYqUY-CA", "user_id": "eo1u4n0SkDh0pbB-ZbzdvA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "What can I say???? It's amazing!

For the second year in a row! He also wished for the same kind of pizza we always get, a large NY Ricotta with red sauce (crushed tomatoes) because it is reliably delicious. The one thing different that we ordered this time was their garlic knots which we never had before. For only $7, we received a bag filled with a generous number of yummy, garlic-laden bread bites served with a side of pizza sauce. If you are a bread person like me, you will love them, too! Walter and Judy have got to be the most down-to-earth, friendly, and genuine restaurant proprietors I have ever encountered. Every time we go there, we are greeted with smiles and a conversation with us that typically turns to something they seem to truly care about. One time, it was about a trip we were planning to NYC and Walter told us where we should go for great pizza. This time, of course, they were touched that my son wanted their pizza for his birthday dinner again. Knowing that their mission statement is to create hope and meaning in the lives of people with disabilities makes this place even more endearing. As I said last year when my son wanted Smiling With Hope Pizza for his birthday dinner - it's a win/win for us all!"}, {"review_id": "s0cqAPvl_TNLhXcCnHL-yw", "user_id": "zgR1qppUiE3_HGWbRIYOJA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/9/2017", "text": "My husband had been craving for a good NY style pizza. As in Carson, we can barely find any good \"real\" pizza. He wanted to try this place so we came for lunch. I realized that we've been to this area a few times but never saw this place. We ordered the NY style pizza with pepperoni & mushroom for the toppings. When the owner finished making the pizza, it looked great. Yes it was great! The topping was yummy. The pizza dough wasn't thick. You are able to fold a slice like classic NY style pizza.The owners were so nice & friendly. We glad that we came here. The place is little but the atmosphere is great, welcoming. Plus they do a lot for charities."}, {"review_id": "saPu-G0HdZiWnihjGNbv6g", "user_id": "UWiwFSKylfkxCK_kSoR6vQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "I'm not gonna lie this place makes me feel absolutely great simply paying patronage to them for what they do as a business. It's weird to think that a places food is just bonus points for the great things that go on under the roof of this place. Walter and Judy seem like two of the nicest people I've probably met in my 30 years of being around. I have taken entirely too long to make it down to try their pizza and I'm gonna say I'm pretty bummed I didn't make it here earlier. Their menu is very short, sweet and to the point. You pick red sauce or white and a handful of fresh ingredients. They don't give you a whole wall of unnecessary ingredients that may or may not make sense. They also have a few distinct sizes so there's not a whole lot of price options. Short, simple and sweet is always a great business model in my opinion. It's another place that truly exemplifies less is more. They don't have a roller coaster of options, they just focus on making sure the pie you get is the best around. They also offer up a few other things like garlic,l knots, salad and cannoli!We got there about half an hour before closing and they still welcomed us as if we were the first customer walking into the store after they first opened. We were behind a few other pizzas so our pizzas came out right about closing time but they insisted that we sit down and enjoy ourselves and be comfortable. I love how they just seem to make you feel like family from the moment you walk in. What I really love about this place besides having undisputedly the best pizza in the area is that they cater to helping provide jobs for people with disabilities. It's so awesome to see people who probably would have little to no chance much of anywhere else just enjoying their time having a blast working here. Walter and Judy seem to have a heart of gold that is pretty much unmatched. My only complaint about here is on myself for taking too dang long to get here and check it out. I brought my roomie who pretty much just broke up with his favorite pizza place to come here from now on. I'll be back, these folks are something special and they serve up the best pie I've had possibly ever. Come show them some love and get a pizza their heart!"}, {"review_id": "S0kziHd6NmW-LYjjyLg7Ow", "user_id": "8rzqG5NLuDlnqE49USzvTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "We went here because it is because it got rated in the top 100 Yelp.  The only downside are the times they are opened and that is it as we wish they were open on a set amount of time.  Menu is small and get ready to pay $30 dollars for a large, but worth the price as everything is cooked fresh.   The customer service was good as they asked us how was the pizza and if there was anything they needed to improve on.

I'm a pizza snob, but what does that mean?I want my pizza to taste like fresh tomato sauce, quality mozzarella cheese (not too much) & a thin, crisp & slightly doughy crust.Walter & Judy do it right! This mom & pop joint is fantastic. They use old school ovens like the ones the pizzerias had back on the east coast. They've got both types of pizza; regular and Sicilian. The ingredients are all high quality and fresh.This place is about the food and the neighborhood restaurant vibe. There is nothing fancy going on here.

And I being a mother with a child with special needs I could see the hope that my son had just by being there and being around like people. I also want to thank the young lady who was working there in the wheelchair for some tips on where I can purchase a new wheelchair for my son or have his fixed so it was a win-win situation for me as well.This will definitely be a routine hang out for me.

Very thin crust except till you get to the end, which then is a bit large and poofy, but, you grab a bite of the soft yet chewy crust and it's just a magical moment. I always order the biggest pie and I have never regretted that decision. Yesterday/Today, I decided to take a step out of my love of hot pizza, and tried it cold, and I can tell you it was amazing. I haven't eaten cold pizza since I was young. The crust kept all the texture and chewiness while remaing soft, and yet the pizza was not floppy, and the flavors were still excellent. If you heat up, my best method has been with a small amount of water in the microwave, in a small glass or ceramic ramekin. I learned this from a friend, and it helps the crust maintain the moisure. It's usually very floppy, so best eaten with a fork and knife! Lastly, ALWAYS check the hours before you go! =) Cheers!"}, {"review_id": "UqaETrv7hlRbHX_Gs6t5vQ", "user_id": "01LtguaeSJjuo78HjNA-4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "This place was excellent!

We had a little mishap with the timing of our pizza as our order got pushed back. But the owners here did all they could to make sure we were happy.Everything here is freshly made, and you can certainly taste the freshness. The garlic knots here are phenomenal. They come out piping out and are little bite sized morsels of happiness. Our NY ricotta with pepperoni also came straight from the oven. Even though we got a small, the slices still begged to be folded! Topped with huge amounts of gooey cheese and heavy with dollops of ricotta, it was a messy bite- but what's great pizza if you're not eating it with your hands? This place also has the pepperoni that curls up into the beautiful little cups with the crisp edge and its own heavenly grease in the middle. First time I've seen this authenticity offered in the pizzerias I've tried in Reno. The only bad thing about the pizza is the amount of grease. By the second slice, the bottom of our pie was already soggy.I admired their walls as we waited for the food, and learned of their story from their bits of memorabilia.

I didn't hear any sounds of a microwave, and by the looks of the piping hot slice presented to me several minutes later, it looked fresh from the oven! Simple, no frills, perfectly thin crust, pepperoni the right size and curling up crispy around the edges. Great sauce & cheese ratio, too. Best of all though, was meeting the owners and hearing their story about how and why they opened. This cozy, family-feeling pizza place also has walls adorned with artwork other memorabilia.
