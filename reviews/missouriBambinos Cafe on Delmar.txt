I almost couldn't believe the value AND quality that you get here. With most entrees around $9-12, this is an affordable place for a good dinner out or a quick meal. The pasta and bread were phenomenal. This is a carb lovers paradise.Our servers were attentive and friendly. Thankfully a table was open as we walked in otherwise there may have been a wait. If you're a group of 5 or more, it would be wise to call ahead to reserve a table. It's pretty close quarters, but I didn't feel claustrophobic or overcrowded. The place has a certain charm that is comfortable and appealing. Whether you're a local or just passing through, don't pass up a chance to check out Bambinos."}, {"review_id": "cLbj1fLlScq-4KzNaMw1sw", "user_id": "LE9P8VNGFg4-JwV8Kuf3ag", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "While on my baby's 4 year old birthday getaway to Springfield, we asked the front desk agent for restaurant ideas. She gave us a literal sheet of paper with restaurants. But this one wasn't on it.  She told us about it, on the side. IN SECRECY. Lol I'm jk. But the  Food was pretty good! The restaurant itself had an odor that was unpleasant, and where we sat, in a back patio lounge type area, was a lil... Blah. While we were being Sat, an employee setting up for a large party kinda (rudely) insinuated that if we sat back there, a large party was coming in and they might be lots of noise. She clearly had not met my babies.... BUT I DIGRESS. The spinach artichoke dip as an app, was kinda like a cheese soup with some spinach thrown in. It wasn't bad at all, just different  from what I'm used too. I ordered the Greek pasta. Sooooo good. Basic, but delish. Penne, chicken, olives, artichoke, etc. I asked for onion to be added and drew asked for tomato to be removed from his panini, but both requests were ignored. *eye roll* but Drew told me to ignore it, so I did.... Drew's sandwich came with some chips that seemed homemade. They were good. My babies just ate off of us and enjoyed a for bowl as well. Our server was a nice young lady too."}, {"review_id": "57Vs6wKtO0BDOidgu0aR1A", "user_id": "lZbotco47bHU7oE5b3d1DA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "Great staff, excellent food (the momma is my fav), reasonable prices and quaint atmosphere!!The chicken Parmesan sandwich was excellent and full of flavor.

It's a cute little place which is a little hard to find. The food is really tasty and comes in a large portion size. If you love garlicky, buttery, creamy Italian food, this is the place to be. They have a wide variety of dishes, suitable for vegetarians too. The bread on the table is very tasty. The only thing I would say I didn't like about this place, is that it gives a not so clean vibe sometimes.

Parking is limited, but that only means it's just that good.  Happy and energetic staff made our first visit enjoyable. Food was delicious and generous portions.  Price was very competitive to franchise restaurants and the food had a very refreshing fresh taste, one we will soon return to and enjoy.  Casual, clean restaurant with clean facilities. I have to agree with their slogan. Great food. Great Service.

First, let me say print and take the appetizer coupon from their website. They honored a free appetizer for anybody that ordered an entree.  The service was fine, and the food is excellent. We only had 2 issues. The first is the Bruschetta is not what I was expecting. The toasted bread is very good, but it's served with a COLD bowl of sauce to put on the bread. Maybe it is to be served cold like this, but if it is to be served like this, it's not in my wheelhouse. The second issue is I ordered the Ziti which is very good. but it was served on basically a FROZEN bowl. The only benefit of this is the pasta got cold so fast it kept me from eating it all and gave me something to take home. It's a great little place and I'm sure we'll be back, but hopefully, they'll address this two issues."}, {"review_id": "c0-5R2_CCIzX-BczjuCJ9Q", "user_id": "c7nH-Ytp-NmxMJGiPqk2LA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/18/2017", "text": "I have eaten here on several occasions and have loved it every time.

The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the sound level--all the noise bounces off the concrete floors and ceiling, making it a pretty loud restaurant. If you can, sit outside or ask to be seated in the coffee shop/cafe side where it's much quieter. But, the baked ziti makes up for all the ambient noise 100x."}, {"review_id": "dSvUtTyg6ok4KefiB-jntA", "user_id": "fo_GMJHPWHF8qYl75uvKfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/17/2017", "text": "Not much of a looker (restaurant building and area) but the food is so incredible, no-one cares!

I am going to smell like garlic for the next three days, and that's okay. Pease start with the bruschetta-I was not excited that we ordered it, because I am not usually a fan. Until now. Mercy. The bruschetta at Bambino's is stellar. Little strips of bread with a bowl of cold tomato/garlic/basil magic. I can't put my finger on where the sweetness comes from, but it's delicious. The pieces of tomato could be chopped a little smaller because the pieces of bread are small, but you'll make do.I ordered the portabello ravioli, which are filled with mushrooms and caramelized onions in a marsala cream sauce. I didn't get a huge wine flavor, and the sauce is mellow and smooth. I guarantee there is nothing low calorie about it...obviously creamy or cheesy or whatever the hell is in there. There is a handful of fresh spinach tossed in too, so it counts as a vegetable.For some reason, we ate all high class and got dessert too...enter the tiramisu. My only critique is that there was too much chocolate sauce on the top. Next time I am requesting that they leave that off...it competed with the delicate flavor that i look for in tiramisu.All in all, the prices are great,  the food is great, and the parking lot is terrible. Go anyway....and if you are a bike rider, there are bike racks out front and a patio...definitely worth it!"}, {"review_id": "KFHO03XZ4g7rZfikT2sn6Q", "user_id": "P-6nfobF49-vWebbx-9X9A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/28/2017", "text": "We were greeted quickly.
