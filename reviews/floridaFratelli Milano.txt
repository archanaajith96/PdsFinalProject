I didn't have to wait too long to get a table even though was on a weekday at peak point because it was the lunch hour but we got our table and the service was really good everything that we order came fast and the temperature of the food was perfect, also the prices are reasonable and the desserts looked really good even though we only had coffee after lunch and honestly the coffee was amazing. I will take advantage of the location just because it's really close to my job and I will keep on coming back as much as I can I will spread the word because it is totally worth it I love the ambience and I loved it the way it feels when you walk in also you have the opportunity to sit outside or inside and that makes entire experience better I'll be back soon!!"}, {"review_id": "8yN_-geIHrU6hTAAo9F0jA", "user_id": "XaxIM5ylUf6GOs-dbZcCkg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/25/2017", "text": "Wow, this was a five star experience from start to finish. We were in this neighborhood for the first time while attending the Miami Book Fair.  I checked Yelp for highly rated Italian restaurants and this one popped up.  We came around 3 pm and the restaurant was busy, but had a decent amount of empty tables still available.Ambiance is cute and romantic, but not stuffy.  I'd suggest this spot for a date.  They have a couple of outside tables, but it seemed busy on the sidewalk so we opted to eat inside.We started out with some really good bread.My husband had a chicken dish with pesto and vegetables.  He said 9 out of 10.  The food was very fresh and tasty.I had a smaller size pizza and it was just perfect.  Took some pieces home and enjoyed it later that night.There were lots of good looking desserts on display in the glass case, but we were stuffed and passed.Total bill with tax was $31 w/tax plus tip for our 2 meals and water.This was a great customer service experience and everything ran efficiently.I have no clue when we will be back in the area, but I would 100% return to this establishment."}, {"review_id": "SuUKtwilAhn8KrHM9ZDDNw", "user_id": "e9UKDjFkzWpZ3_QnsZGX1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Great assortment of breads.  Delicious pear-filled pasta.  Fantastic service.  Quaint, cozy atmosphere.

My meal was delivered in a timely manner and was delivered by a couple to my Hotel lobby. I ordered the chicken pasta (don't recall the exact dish name) with a pink sauce, a Tiramisu and a panna cotta.The pasta was simply divine and it was actually stuffed with chicken, vos not like some places that state it's stuffed and you can't help but wonder where the chicken is, lol!  The sauce was very  good, I am glad I went with the pink sauce and not the 4 cheese sauce as I originally wanted to do as I believed to it may have been too strong for that dish. The restaurant had sent over two bread sticks individually wrapped and they were the worst part of my food.  They were dry and seemed to be old.  The desserts, I ordered a Tiramisu that was good but nothing to write home about and a panna cotta, the texture was amazing, rich and creamy as I imagined it to be but it wasn't a taste I enjoyed, it wasn't bad but it wasn't special, then again this was my first panna cotta ever and perhaps it's just not for me.   I will order from this location again as the pasta was really very good and I may try some other dish while I am in town."}, {"review_id": "DD1UmTczCcyfbxAVIN8ESQ", "user_id": "Dp18cnBluIRDqp6yzNNziQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "OMG !

Hands down best pizza, salad, desserts and delivery service of anyone in Downtown Miami. We have tried them all for many years than finally I come to my senses and look at their Yelp reviews. This place is the best reviewed as well as the most reviewed. What rock was I under not to find this place sooner. I ordered more than a week in advance the following Mista Verde Salad mixed greens, long fresh strings of carrot, nice thick slices of cucumber, both yellow and red cut grape tomatoes with fresh basil on the side and balsamic dressing on the side I could have ate this alone. However than we had one of every pizza they make two on the Margherita made with fresh tomato sauce,mozzarella and basil. Capricciosa- mushrooms,ham,artichokes,kalamata olives and extra virgin olive oil loved this one. Contadina-Italian sausage,mushroom and bell peppers loved this one. Garibaldi-spinach,goat cheese, and grape tomatoes loved this one as well. Ortolana-grilled eggplant,zucchini,portobello mushrooms and sundried tomatoes. Quattro Formaggi-Mozzarella,fontina,Gorgonzola,parmigiano,fresh sliced tomatoes i.e. No sauce. Rinascente-Prosciutto,arugula and shaved parmigiana sorry had no room left for this one. Believe it or not I ordered desserts they all were beautiful I could only eat just one the cream puff with chocolate covering which was amazing. This will definitely be our go to place for ordering or maybe I will even try eating there.PSS They came 20 minutes early on a rainy Friday."}, {"review_id": "iI9UlZYctQXGXFRchBgiOg", "user_id": "Nctbqef0-nUi9tABzNEEyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Wonderful, Just absolutely wonderful!

I was a bit surprised of the four star rating as this was an average restaurant. High point: The service was quick and efficient. Quaint Italian bistro feel. Low Point: I tired the lasagna with sausage which came out cold. I was embarrassed to ask them to microwave it however eating cold lasagna was somewhat unsatisfying so I asked nicely. They immediately took it away and it came back piping hot as it should. I was disappointed at the texture of the pasta as it was paper thin. It got lost in the tomato meat and béchamel sauces along with the cheese. I was hoping it would have that thick \"bite back\" at you or al dente texture most pastas have. The arugula Pear goat cheese salad with raspberry vinaigrette dressing was very good. Again, nothing outstanding, but average. Overall, not impressed but can't say it wasn't good. It was just that.

The pasta was good and the waiter was nice. I wouldn't rate it as high as previous customers seem to do. It's just a normal Italian restaurant but nothing extraordinary. The one thing that was really delicious was the tomato sauce that came with the bread OMG. However that kind of raised the anticipations for the rest of the food and disappointingly my pasta didn't have that much flavor to it. I ordered the pappardelle with filet mignon and my wife had the pear filled pasta.

The places I skip or leave for \"one of these days\" turn out to be the best places and that's saying a lot. We were spending time with my sister in law and her husband and they trust me with food choices and places to go so I had a lot of pressure to decide on a good spot and I had never been here but heard good things so it was risky business but at the end, it paid off. I was surprised to see that it wasn't as busy as I expected it because on weekdays for lunch it's hard to get a table here but tonight was perfect since we were starving and didn't wan to wait long, plus as a bonus, we got a parking space right up front which is a miracle.     Let's talk food now, this is an incredible dinner. Starting with excellent service and attentiveness. Our waiter was friendly and kinda funny too, but not the obnoxious type funny, if you get my drift. Started with three glasses of Moscato for the ladies and my friend and a Pinot Grigio for \"moi\", just what the doctor prescribed. As appetizers we started with the traditional bruschetta and the prosciutto bruschetta because we like options and my wife loves goat cheese. Wow these two were equally delicious and made with fresh ingredients. If you like goat cheese, and I say it because I'm not a fan, you have to try this. Even I was impressed with this bruschetta.     The menu had an excellent two specials for the evening and my friend and I just went for it:Florida lobster tail, clams, mussels, calamari and scallops in fra diavolo  sauce over linguini pasta. This sauce was amazing due to its creamy consistency but the star of the show was that lobster tail. All the seafood in this dish was definitely fresh and cooked perfectly and the tail was not chewy or bland like I expect sometimes from seafood restaurants. My wife ordered the Lobster Ravioli because that is her favorite pasta dish and she had a lot of great things to say about it, but just in case, I tried and yes it was that good. That pink sauce, oh the sauce, is sooo good you want to lick the plate.     My sister in law ordered the vegetarian pasta dish composed of spinach noodles, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, zucchini, garlic and olive oil. I'm more carnivorous than anything but that dish looked delicious and she confirmed it so there is that. Her husband ordered the same dish as me so I already talked about this, but insist that if you see that special on the menu, you go for it, trust me. Last but not least, the desserts. OMG, I can't believe how good, no, incredibly delicious these desserts were. I had my wife order the Creme Brûlée, her fave, but asked my sister in law if she had ever tried Panna Cotta, her answer was no. So she trusted me with that decision and she got the Panna Cotta. People, I cannot explain just how delish this was and I'm not sorry to repeat myself. Wifey and her sister decided to share both desserts and apparently that was the experience of a lifetime, one bite of Creme Brûlée and one of the Panna Cotta. Oh before I forget, the presentation for all these desserts was amazing, the Brûlée came in flames, yes it did. I got myself the tiramisu because I'm not a risk taker with desserts, maybe because I don't have much of a sweet tooth but this really good ol' fluffly tiramisu and awesome presentation. So so glad I came here and shared this meal with wifey and family. My biggest satisfaction when I go out to eat and show people new places is that look of happiness and food coma feeling at the end, lol. Btw the restaurant also got a plaque for 2017 Best Restaurants in Miami so yes you have to go there soon and not leave it for \"one of these days\" like I did because you will be missing out on an incredibly delicious meal."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/fratelli-milano-miami?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
