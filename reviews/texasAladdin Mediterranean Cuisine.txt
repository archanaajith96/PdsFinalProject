Lots of options for omnivores and herbivores alike. 4.  Fresh juice!  Was tempted by a huge glass of freshly made mango juice.  Delicious.5.  Lovely outdoor seating.6.  Lots of parking, you have to drive past some other restaurants, but it is there.Cons-1.  Gas.2.  The overall look when you first get there is a little off putting.  The outside needs some fresh paint or something, but not a deal breaker.3.  I could have actually done with a little less food.  If I was on lunch break from work, or something, I would not necessary want so much food.  Maybe a smaller lunch option?"}, {"review_id": "wn9Xop8Cn9Ru-5pduY43zw", "user_id": "1H0p3RbErDobvydEPgZOQA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Don't judge a book by its cover, this place offers very nice Mediterranean food in a buffet style.

Their food is extremely fresh, beautiful, and delicious. I've had just about everything they serve and love it all. A quick run through of my favorites in each section: hummus- spicy, salad- cabbage or fattoush, grains- cashew rice, hot veg- cauliflower, and although I usually order the falafel, out of their meat proteins- kafts or beef skewers. I love the little pickles on the side and the fresh juices are good if you need a sweet kick. I've never had any desserts, but I'm sure they are just as good as the rest. The last thing I love is that one of the cousins I'd ALWAYS there, every time I go. For. 10. Years. Simple amazing- definitely recommend.

Small parking lot with additional parking if you drive past Aladdin's. Served like cafeteria style. Services were especially slow that day. Only one person was working behind the counter so the line got longer. Finally, another staff came and the line moved a bit faster. The special they had allows you to choose one meat and three sides. I went with the spicy hummus and pita bread, rice, grilled veggies, and lamb kabobs. Everything was simply delish. Pita bread was heated up and the spicy hummus went amazing with it. We got extra bread since they only gave us two. Didn't want to waste the huge portion of hummus they gave us. Grilled veggies and lamb kabobs went great with the rice.When you select your meat, it would need to be cooked so they will give you a number stand to take to your table. I didn't know what meat I wanted and the staff helping me seemed a bit annoyed. We stayed to chat some more after finishing our food, but I got a feeling that they wanted us to leave. Overall, the food was cooked beautifully, but service was lacking here and there."}, {"review_id": "UHaM3g78QYtLxpTo7uAeOg", "user_id": "9_3da6wreXuGql5m7dqovw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "4 Veggie plate// $10.99This place can do no wrong.

So finally I'm getting around to posting about it! Everything I've ordered has always been on point but for your first time though, I'd highly suggest the #cauliflower, any of their #hummus, their saffron #curry rice, the cashew rice and if you eat #meat their #bakedchicken will give you a #foodgasm. The choices are bountiful so good luck. I was introduced to this place and have introduced it to several others including my mom. I kid you not we went back the next day bc she wanted even more lol and you totally get the best bang for your buck because they just heap it all on the plate so essentially you're getting a meal for now and later."}, {"review_id": "QCX5MLr70SE5c6-mjqwsDw", "user_id": "hX1YZujJesmQn_U0gK-YvQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Aladdin is basically Fadis lite as far as I am concerned. They have garnered a lot of standalone hype over the years due to their central Montrose location but in terms of food variety and atmosphere, they can't hang with Fadis. Their gyro is thicker and juicier, while their baked chicken is also deliciously unique and the spicy hummus is the tastiest I have had in a while. That being said, everything else struggles to parallel Fadis and in the end, that's not a great look for such a hyped up Mediterranean spot. The service can be slow and sloppy too, and one of the clear drawbacks relative to competitors is their inability to split half-and-half hot sides, basically leaving you with no choice but a full portion of items like rice or potatoes that you may want to otherwise limit. All told, it's more average than extraordinary for me and therefore restricted to three stars..."}, {"review_id": "skr8g78vcFJrIoo7SIU1VQ", "user_id": "t2-wvybevFcdX7WuoIz8PA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Summary:I liked Aladdin's and would come back again if it was more conveniently located than the nearest Fadi's.  The food here was good, but I missed the selection and huge vegetarian plate option at Fadi's.As another reviewer mentioned, the most popular menu choices are:- Meat platter with 2 or 3 sides- Veggie platter (3 sides or 4 sides)Another note is that a few reviewers mentioned that they were able to get half sides.  That was not listed on the menu or mentioned to me when I went through line (with lots of questions), so it may be that it is available upon request only.Pros:- Good food- Good price- Get a pretty good quantity of food (I walked away with some leftovers, though not as many as I usually do at Fadi's)- Good place to eat if you are vegetarian or meeting vegetarian friendsCons:- Wish their menu (or a paper copy of it) had a little more explanation on it, including information about being able to get half sides- I realize this is a smaller place, so this is to be expected somewhat, but I missed the larger selection/variety and Fadi's vegetarian plate option (where you basically get as many sides as will fit on your plate, plus a plate of hot food items and bread)"}, {"review_id": "lqCTnBjXxdcATQHofXuAGg", "user_id": "x8H4HuWC9dn-eOUaLnngHg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "If you haven't been here, what the heck have you been doing?!

The baked chicken is fire! Pretty much everything is top notch, you can't go wrong with any combination. Also, you can also split your side. Example, if you want 1/2 of cauliflower serving and 1/2 of a salad serving you can do that. The spicy hummus is to die for. The bread is freshly baked in a brick oven and it is the softest and warmest price of bread in earth.

My love for potatoes only grew even more- which I didn't think was possible- after having their roasted potatoes (the perfect amount of lemon and garlic)! ... And the pita. Aladdin's pita bread is probably the \"best I ever had\" (cue that one Drake song)! It's fresh, soft (like fluffy pillow soft-- I hope that's not too weird for me to say), and tastes amazing even without hummus! The staff are all very friendly and welcoming! Parking can be somewhat of a nuisance in Montrose, but I was able to find street parking adjacent to Baba Yega Cafe. Aladdin does have their own lot off Montrose Blvd., but it's small. If you cannot find parking there, they have an additional parking lot off Grant Street behind the restaurant- just follow the signs. The only downside is that it's only available from 11am-2pm."}, {"review_id": "IYi61gZ27Mj92zLm6XuE8w", "user_id": "C2n878JARw3oFV-_bIxGQQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "I've been on a kick for Lebanese/middle eastern/Mediterranean food lately.

My favorite meat here is their lamb. I have had it as a stew and as spicy meatballs and have not been disappointed. The portions are very generous so you usually end up bringing lots of left overs home. The parking can get tricky on weekends because the lot directly next to the restaurant is small, but luckily they have a second available lot on Montrose just a block away.

I expected a regular full-service restaurant, but it ended up being almost cafeteria style. First, it's located in Montrose so things are busy, streets are narrow, and parking is hard to find (although there is alternate parking lot down the street that helped during lunch). The restaurant itself is nothing to write home about , it didn't help that water was pooling around the entrance due to poor drainage.Inside the restaurant is fairly small, maybe enough for 30 patrons at once? The spread was impressive though, you see 3 separate stations. The first is bread/hummus, second is other cold salads and vegetarian dishes, third is meats and warm side dishes. The prices are reasonable for what you get, you can do either a 3 side and 1 meat dish or a 4 side dish (as well as stuff like lamb shank with 2 sides). The issue I had is that since it's a cafeteria, it's not conducive to determining what you want to eat, especially since my grandparents were with us and didn't know what any of the foods were. We spend any more in time looking at the dishes, we would hold up the people behind us and I felt the staff were trying to rush us through.The food itself was good, really enjoyed the babaghanoush, the lamb stew, and the saffron rice. The lamb stew was super tender, slightly sweet, and very flavorful. I couldn't stop dipping my bread into it. The lamb shank was also good, but I'll do the lamb stew over it any day. The chicken kabob was decent, the sauce that came with it was the best part of it. The hot eggplant dish (forgot what it was called) was also delicious. Also their fruit juices, though expensive, were delicious and feel like they're pure fruit."}, {"review_id": "PVTQeI9YMe7H2ZLKMZLB3w", "user_id": "4vJMLMuxUR24DLm3m_8YNA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Insane flavor!

The drinks are incredibly overpriced. As for the actual food well I really love the Kofte Kabob. A lot of the other stuff is good but not great. It was nothing awful but nothing that made me want to run back and order everything again tomorrow. Seating isn't the most comfortable and it's hard to get in here in stiletto heels. It's sort of a buffet, but you pay for every item you want. And the price is can creep up on you and it can end up costing you quite a lot.

The parking lot is rather limited but if you wait a couple minutes, there's usually one or two cars leaving as I pull in.

For 12.99, you can order a protein with 3 sides (hot/cold) or 4 sides. I always have enough for a leftover meal. Pita bread is complementary (even if you don't order hummus) and I usually load up on these warm yumminess/pack some togo! Sometimes I skip the hummus and dip the pita with the sauces from my entrees, which is just as tasty!Today I had the chicken curry and lamb meatballs, saucy and delicious. I've also had the chicken kebabs and red snapper before, which are solid choices as well.The roasted cauliflower is one of my top favorite sides -- I've never had such garlicky crispy goodness before. Other sides range from different types of hummus, pasta salad, tabouleh, lentil/chickpea salads, eggplants, saffron/curry rices. There is something for everyone!
