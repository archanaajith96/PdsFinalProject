I tried to get us a reservation through \"opentable\" but the only spot open was 7:00 pm. Since it was 5:30 pm we took a chance at got seated at the bar.It was a good move as the place was filled up by 6. We ordered a couple of drinks, I got a Bombay Sapphire & tonic, my wife ordered off the drink menu, a cranberry whiskey sour both were generous pours which we prefer. We were settling in and were about to order off the menu when the bartender told us about the \"Cutting Board\" specials, one  was a full duck breast, served with demi glace and broccoli sprigs atop roasted sweet potatoes  the other was a 14 oz. Bone-In NY Strip beefsteak with scallion mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. My wife got the duck, cooked medium, I got the beef medium rare. Both were cooked to perfection. I give 4 stars for their exemplary service at the bar, and to the quality of the food and it's preparation; best meal we had in Mobile."}, {"review_id": "ez-3Gg5U1asvKzbA-MDskg", "user_id": "zY3Go_oCpiVJNvhH9boY0Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/9/2017", "text": "Atmosphere in downtown Mobile is one of the draws of Dumbwaiter. I did notice that they also have a suburban location. Be mindful which one you choose as we \"may\" have gone to the wrong one. The interior of he downtown location had a cool vibe with exposed brick walls and cool rope styled \"chandeliers\". It's across from a park and parking is a factor. Plan ahead to leave time to park if driving. It's meter spots or a two block walk to a pay lot as far as I was able to find being from out of town. We should have Uber'd. The menu is a twist on old south flavor pumped and fancied up a bit. Our bread basket had corn bread and pork rinds, different yes! They have some specialty house drinks, wine, and beer on tap. We ordered two appetizers, Brussels Sprouts & Fried Green Tomatoes. I will say that the food we had was all good but tended to be very strong in what ever flavor they were going for, a heavy hand if you will. This from a person who loves flavor means my non-spicy loving, guest's palate was overwhelmed. The Brussels were good, my one drawback in this dish was the vinegar eventually was just a bit much. The fried green tomatoes had a heavy cream sauce with seafood that was also poured on with a heavy hand. Would have preferred a bit less so my tomatoes topping didn't get soggy. Entrees were the scallops of which were delicious and cooked perfectly, and the steak and potatoes. The steak was seasoned very heavily which was off putting to my mild palate guest and as such left behind sadly. Cool place, overall good. Just be mindful of what you order to meet your flavor needs."}, {"review_id": "qY94ES3-QxUg3OWXOzcL1w", "user_id": "hA2X9akTxboda17YqbF20g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "While in Mobile, Alabama for a work event - The Dumbwaiter restaurant was recommended by almost every local who I spoke to. If you're looking for fine dining in the downtown area, this is the spot. Knowing it was the weekend and that a few different conventions were in town, my colleague and I made a reservation about a day and advance. Thank goodness we did since the place was packed and people were waiting in a line that even wrapped around the outside area. We got there a little bit late and called ahead of time to let them know we would be a little late. They said that they could take us at 7:15 but we needed to be out by nine because they had another party who needed that table. We said \"no problem\" and that we could be in and out. We were out exactly at nine on the dot and we could see the people waiting for a table. I don't like to be rushed or pressured, but luckily the timing worked out perfectly. We were greeted by our server who was great-his name is Logan. My colleague is vegan so we needed to be creative in our ordering. The menu is very heavy, meaning lots of cream sauces, fried foods, butter, etc. I like to eat on the lighter and healthier side, and again my colleague is a vegan - so there wasn't a lot of options for us. They didn't have any specials for the night. I decided to be basic and just get scallops because I figured that was safe. He brought out complimentary cornbread and pork rinds. I don't like pork rinds, but I did try the cornbread. They cook it in bacon grease so my colleague could not eat it. I don't like bacon fat so I did not eat too much, however the butter was homemade, whipped, and delicious. My colleague got the salad and a side of asparagus. Our food did not take very long to come out, they brought out my colleagues' salad first. We would have preferred to have it all at once so it wasn't awkward, but that's OK. Every restaurant does it differently. My meal came out shortly after. I did not like my scallops or the asparagus that I tried. They were both incredibly salty. I don't salt my food so I'm very sensitive to any kind of sodium, and I felt like my body was attacked as soon as I took a bite. I had to send my scallops back and I didn't want them remade. I just asked for them to be removed from the tab. Logan said \"no problem!\" I was disappointed, I really enjoyed the service, the environment, and the overall company of my colleague - I just wish the food situation was a little bit better. I got a cocktail that had a grapefruit, soda water, and vodka which was pretty good. I tried my colleagues wine and I kind of had order envy. I should've stuck to what I like. The redeeming factor of all of this was the peanut butter pie. The peanut butter pie is made from a local pie and dessert bakery and it was absolutely my most favorite dessert I've ever tasted. It's definitely shareable. The portion is large and there is a side of ice cream. Needless to say, my colleague and I demolished that piece of pie. I definitely recommend ending on a high note like we did.  Prices are definitely on the more expensive side as it is a fine dining experience. Parking can be found on the side streets or any local parking lot, not sure if the restaurant itself has a lot because I walked from my hotel. This is a great restaurant if you like eating heavier, fried foods. There is a lot of seafood and meat options. Rack of lamb, fried fish, etc. Enjoy!"}, {"review_id": "d-pUecCzlrM0UrNTKDkLhg", "user_id": "Wt3tyUh67_cBbMo4jz4A2w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Great service tonite.

Beautiful brick and hardwood everywhere inside. The whole place glowed in the evening. We sat at the bar. The bartender, Zack, was super friendly and knowledgeable. He was telling us about all the local beers on tap. I ordered the braised short ribs and cheese grits. The short ribs fell apart with a fork and were pretty good. The cheese grits weren't my favorite, but I think that's just my preference. They were had some bits of what I believe was blue cheese and I wasn't a fan of the overall texture. I couldn't taste much grit...it was more of like a chalk paste. I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt though. Everything on the menu sounded good and the food I saw other people eating looked good as well.

The beignets were so good we ordered a second round! These were definitely the best beignets we ate while in Mobile. For dinner we split the Bronzed Catfish since we were already feeling pretty full from the heavy apps - this came with a $5 split fee which was a little annoying, but not a huge deal or anything. It was absolutely delicious. Cocktails here were pretty decent too. Service was average. Nothing to complain about but nothing to rave about either.

From dining at the bar, going for a date night, or meeting a group of 12 for dinner, Dumbwaiter has never disappointed me. If you are going with a group, ask for the high-top table in the back when you make your reservation. In my opinion, it's the best table! We usually always start out with the brussels' sprouts, with my entree choices either being the Cutting Board special or the Creole Seafood Pasta, which has to be hands down the best seafood pasta I have ever had. Whether you're visiting Mobile or you're a local who hasn't made it to Dumbwaiter yet, trust me and go check them out.

Downtown is such a nice place to walk around and there is no shortage of restaurants. With so many choices, where do we go? Well, the night before, we ate dinner at another restaurant and walked past Dumbwaiter. It was packed inside with a few parties waiting for tables. A cursory glance at the menu and I decided that I had to try this place the next evening.When we got to the restaurant, we were greeted by the hostesses and the owner. All were extremely friendly and very bubbly. The owners was very enthusiastic while speaking with us. After we were seated, we were immediately greeted by our waitress. She explained the specials of the evening and then took our appetizer and drink order.One of the recommendations for appetizers was the brussels sprouts. I like brussels sprouts but I know that there are many out there that have a certain disdain for them. I guess it's kind of an acquired taste. These are not your normal brussels sprouts. OMG. These are first flash fried and then tossed in a balsamic sauce with red onions and fried pork belly pieces. I assure you that this appetizer disappeared in quick order. It was that delicious.My wife ordered the steak salad that was served with blue cheese dressing. My goodness, the steak was cooked perfectly and so tender that we could have cut the pieces with a butter knife. It was a very high quality cut of steak. If I was in the mood for salad, then I would have ordered this for myself.For my main entree, I was torn between the Delmonico steak and the Chilean sea bass. I decided on the Chilean Sea bass and I was not disappointed. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked and served atop a mushroom risotto. The sea bass was flaky and so good. My only wish was that the sea bass portion was larger. It is so easy to overcook sea bass and the chef nailed it.For dessert, we tried the bread pudding with chocolate sauce on top sprinkled with pieces of Reese's peanut butter cups and a scoop of ice cream. It was a wonderful if not decadent piece of heaven. If you are on the fence on which restaurant to try in Mobile, AL, try this neighborhood gem. This is truly a great place to have dinner and socialize. There is also a bar where you can partake in some alcoholic libations. The waitress told me that this location is so popular that they have opened up a second location. I'm definitely going to make it a point to come back to this restaurant if my business travels bring me back to this lovely city."}, {"review_id": "3JtCcbiWB6AJ6IO7oCWnDg", "user_id": "hEmwcibuecBV8W7YOCXJ0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/5/2016", "text": "AMAZING.  The Yelp reviews are legit.  While staying in Mobile for the week, we were checking out some restaurants around our hotel.  A few nights prior to our visit to this restaurant, we had walked past Dumbwaiter on our way home and noticed how busy it was, and how everyone in the restaurant seemed dressed up and kinda fancy.  We figured it must be a higher-end restaurant.A few nights later, we were looking for a new place to check out, so I came on Yelp to see what was near us.  Saw the awesome 5-star ratings on Yelp and we decided to experience it for ourselves.We got there around 4:45pm, not realizing they open at 5pm.  So we hung out at the park across the street, checking out the super-friendly squirrels (seriously, they come up to people!  Everything in the South is friendlier, I guess?), doing some poke-stopping (my husband got me addicted), and catching some Scyther's because apparently the park across the street is a nest (that part probably won't make sense unless you play Pokemon Go).  Around 4:55pm, we headed to the entrance and planned to wait outside for five minutes until they opened, but the owner/manager motioned us to come in.  He and the other hostesses in the front were all super friendly and inviting.  We got a table immediately and had the nicest sweetest server.  Long story short, the Brussels sprouts really are amazing.  Love Yelp for giving us tips like this.  I usually wouldn't order Brussels sprouts because we have them all the time, but these were different.  I guess that separates me from a professional cook---being able to do magic with Brussels sprouts.  I asked the server about them and she said they were lightly deep-fried and then added to a honey-balsamic vinegar.  There were even pieces of bacon/pork belly in there.Husband got the \"catch of the day\" which was a sea bass with risotto.  He absolutely LOVED it.  Portion size was a little small, but I guess that's what comes with sea bass and a higher-end restaurant.I got the chopped salad that came with filet mignon.  Wow, that filet mignon was incredible.  So soft, like butter.  Amazing.  We always watch these cool kitchen/cooking shows on Food Network and are always amazed at people who cook for a living and create wonders with ordinary ingredients.  That's what it felt like when we visited this place.  Fabulous food, fabulous service.  They've also opened another location in Spring Hill, because apparently they're doing that well!    Great place to visit!"}, {"review_id": "Z1spC198d9FjKEC0tDWWmA", "user_id": "qcShzIhKISL5okD4atyt8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/5/2017", "text": "Great menu awesome atmosphere .Break from the chains and eat here You will enjoy .Gnocchi with wild mushrooms was excellent !"}, {"review_id": "VJzaqTiRoY0CBBRhXkpKtg", "user_id": "pk2gAUQXPPgS7ne_9q_0Bg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/31/2017", "text": "Dumbwaiter will now be my go-to when travelling to Mobile.  It was AHHH-MAZING!
