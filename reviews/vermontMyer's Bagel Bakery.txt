Cool employees.I got a Montreal bagel with plain cream cheese, a slice of banana bread and a cinnamon roll for my husband. I loved the montreal bagel, it was unique and tasted so good, high quality. The banana bread was also A+, I happen to make really good banana bread and compare all banana bread to mine. This one was as good or better! Soft, yummy top makes all the difference. Husband didn't like his cinnamon roll, said it had pieces of fruit in it, he is a cinnamon roll purist. Too bad i didn't get a chance to try it for my own opinion! All and all, check this place out if you are looking for a fantastic bagel in burlington!"}, {"review_id": "QSqXLUvofXPEVeUo6g9Xew", "user_id": "9P8-9EUP-aEnuisqUYt5jQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/6/2017", "text": "How ironic is it that a Montrealer has to drive to the US to get \"Montreal style\" bagels! Let me explain - I'm one of those gluten freaks and I can't find gf bagels at a restaurant here in Montreal! My husband had the regular (non gluten free) lox bagel and I had the gluten free lox. Husband LOVED it.. for myself the gluten free crust was a little harder than I'd like (maybe over toasted or well just typical gluten free bread tasting like gluten free bread lol). It was also a little overly oily/greasy TBH.Would I go back? Definitely! Would I drive the 2+ hours and go through the Canada/US border just to eat here again? Maybe!PS- Another thing I loved about this place is that the guy who served me the bagels was 110% confident there would be no cross contamination and he was right! I could safely eat here as I can confirm by not getting sick that they took the correct measures.Ambiance is hipster/dive/casual"}, {"review_id": "uAr9nXByHIh4QsnhuOQ2MA", "user_id": "hkCJqpgCP66qrjRfTdgXuw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/18/2017", "text": "Love this place. We had visited in each of our prior visits, and were gratified to see it newly bolstered by co-owners, yet still executing that high quality bagel.  It is a real treat to get there early enough and watch the baker at work - such a crazy cool process.  We arose a bit later on a Monday so he was cleaning up when we rolled in, but the items were still warm from the oven...o la la!I really favor a simple toasting with butter for this style of bagel - it really brings out the flavor without masking the unique snap of the bagel or the infusion.  We ordered four for the two of us, and I think that 2.5 is the perfect decadent amount of these bagels.  The salt, the beer collaboration and the *sesame* were top favorites - each had a distinctive tone while maintaining a consistent quality across each.  The sandwiches and salads look awesome (I stare at the whitefish salad option each time I come) but it is just too tough to top these lovely items as is.  For $1.15 each, you can't beat it.  Definitely worth a trek to this slightly out of the way place - they are really meant to be eaten fresh.  Kudos to the proprietor for starting it up and keeping it going for over 20 years - one of the few legit Montreal-style bagel shops in the USA.

I wouldn't say these are exactly Montreal style bagels (it's always impossible to replicate a bagel style, there will be variation and a lot of it comes down to the water supply) but they come awfully close and that's all I can ask for. I say all that to say, the bagels are on the smaller side than what Americans are probably used to but don't let that deter you.They have a huge menu of options for breakfast and lunch sandwiches. We had a surf and turf (bacon and lox with cream cheese, capers, tomato, etc) and the veggie hash with brisket (comes with the bagel on the side). They have some really different but totally awesome flavors, rosemary salt (SO GOOD) and Montreal spice stand out as our favorites. I can say that because we also grabbed a dozen bagels to bring home which we have freezed and have been eating since our trip. Finally: the coffee is not good but that's not super surprising, so it didn't detract from the experience. Just a warning."}, {"review_id": "GY0PcZxhXKBRLlhpnu5H5Q", "user_id": "wquzF6UKoxyl0V7cyp13rA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I'll have to live with the pangs of regret for not trying the Montreal spice bagel.

Sounds like an exaggeration... But that's only because this place is THAT good. I mean, what other bagel shop serves brisket on your bagel sandwich? Or has heady topper hot sauce and mustard? Or makes Sriracha a common topping on their sandwiches? Come here once so you never debate about other bagel places anymore.

The bagels were good though, sweeter than ny, as they are boiled with honey. I got the lox special and it was served to me open face but with only half of the ingredients on each side forcing me to eat it as a sandwich, which I don't really mind but if you want me to eat it as a sandwich then serve it as a sandwich and cut it down the middle.

Larry S. was craving a Montreal-style bagel and found this spot. It's a bit of a walk into an industrial area of Burlington, but well worth the detour. We actually came here twice in one day! On our initial visit, around 7AM, I just had a coffee (excellent) while Larry had a beer bagel with bacon cream cheese. It was moderately busy with what looked like locals grabbing a bite on their way to work. We then departed so I could sort out my issues with Verizon and the aggravation revved up my appetite, so we returned to Myer's for a 2nd breakfast. Not sure what Larry had this time; I opted for the beer bagel with an egg on top. I loved it! Montreal-style bagels are very different than what you get in NYC or (horrors!) Einstein's or another chain. Smaller, denser, chewier, but still absolutely delicious! The beer bagel had a really unique and interesting flavor, while still allowing you to drive safely!"}, {"review_id": "D4yvJmfSNbPppb8S5dFzDQ", "user_id": "kvi3ZBaiF8YfKNv8egJQDg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/11/2017", "text": "We came to Burlington VT on vacation from Phoenix and OMG the food is amazing.

I definitely wouldn't have stumbled in here without a hat tip from the locals. It's just far enough off the beaten path to avoid being a total tourist spot, but not so far that you have to go too far out of your way for a delicious meal. It was pointed out to me while driving by and I had to do a double take because I was sure there was no food establishment in that seemingly industrial park. Sure enough, it's there! It's pretty small inside - cozy - with a few tables and chairs for seating, but I get the sense that most people take theirs to go. It's decorated like your classic neighborhood coffee shop - a little bit indie, a little bit kitschy, very much local. The people there are super friendly!The bagels are significantly smaller than their NY counterparts that I'm so accustomed to - and that's a welcome deviation from the norm. Not that I don't devour my entire NY bagel, but I certainly don't *need* to eat that much bread in one sitting. Montreal style is less fluffy, less uniform in shape, and seemed to have a larger hole in the middle. Still plenty of surface area for shmear! I decided to go all in on my first visit and got a Montreal spice bagel topped with Montreal spice cream cheese. Doubling down?! It was excellent! I probably could have gotten the same effect from a spice bagel and plain cream cheese, but it certainly wasn't bad with both. The coffee was also really good! If I lived in the area, Myer's would no doubt be in my regular rotation."}, {"review_id": "cdwiQStXv8GYwqx1Fgq1rw", "user_id": "ipRs72nvRfw8C8lDo8eNEw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/11/2017", "text": "Yum! I love bagels, so when I heard there was a unique local bagel place here in Burlington, I had to try it out while in town. So glad we did - the bagels are made fresh before your eyes (Canadian style apparently) and the guy making the bagels will sometimes hand you a fresh (blazing hot) bagel on a wooden stick, straight out of the brick oven. It's delicious (but you do get third degree burns on your fingers haha). I tried the Montreal spice bagel, which was delicious, and my friend had a bagel sandwich that looked great. No air conditioning inside which I assume is not usually a problem, but it was super hot in there the day we went - best to sit outside. Definitely worth the drive over here - there are even a few antique shops next door so you can eat and then peruse if you so choose.
