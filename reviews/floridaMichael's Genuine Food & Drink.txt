It has a beautiful outdoor seating area and ample inside space for dining. We were seated right away outside and the service is impeccable. Our waiter was amazing and knowledgeable. We decided to just order a bunch of appetizers instead of a meal. Everything was fresh and delicious. Your empty plates don't sit very long before someone comes by and whisks it away. I never had an empty water glass either. The tomatoes were so fresh and delicious with a mozzarella that was to die for with it. The grouper ceviche is magnificent along with the hamachi. I could have licked the plates. The last thing we had was the creme brûlée. It was topped with a lovely dollop of heavy fresh whipping creme and sliced drag oranges. So amazing. I highly recommend this place and I will make the trip down there to go again. Just fantastic!  Well done!!"}, {"review_id": "KWbb30rEMO57k6G38rAmhQ", "user_id": "T4bKpy8-BT27L_nfWdlVqQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "I can say I've been wanting to have dinner lunch here for years. The Design District isn't really somewhere I long to park and wait so therefore I am just dining here for the 1st time in 2018. So sad I know. Decided to have lunch on my way to Miami Beach. Weather in May a breezy 85 and so we sat outside. Very crowded inside even tho we had reservations for two at 12:30. I did want to feel the vibe inside but the only 2 too crowded next to another. PASS!I had a beet salad with fabulous grilled chicken. The dressing fresh and strong ginger taste which was really fun. Lots of beets and avocado too. All healthy. My date had a grilled chicken sandwich with fries which were great. Sandwich very large. We had a local beer and one signature cocktail with gin infused with lemongrass. Can't remember the name of it. Highly recommend that. Reason for 4 out of 5 stars is location full and parking ridiculous. You'll love if you're into shopping at high end stores tho. Area was really quiet and what's going on here makes me proud for Miami. Tourists must love all this stuff."}, {"review_id": "EdOdLem9pLl2ISR5CZHIbQ", "user_id": "oOYnhaC-pHRUJrfRqOnjTA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I had been planning on taking my gf for our anniversary to your restaurant and made a reservation on OpenTable for 8:15 PM on Friday night. As I'm driving to go pick her up I get an email saying that my reservation was canceled by the restaurant and I was given no reason for the cancellation. It left me scrambling and its not easy to get a table reservation at upscale restaurants last minute in Miami. Just not cool to do that to a customer that was planning on enjoying a nice evening at your restaurant.Just wanted to add that Nicole was made aware of the situation and was quick to resolve the matter. She went above and beyond what I expected to remedy the problem. Now that is how customer service should be handled.

I visited for the first time this past Sunday and was extremely surprised with everything from its location in the Design District to their welcoming staff. I will warn you this is a popular brunch spot, if you don't like waiting, I'd recommend you make a reservation and/or get there early. I made a reservation through OpenTable and didn't have to wait to be seated. Street parking was limited, so we ended up having to valet. The valet attendants weren't the best, but that's a different story. We were given the option to sit inside or outside, and I chose to sit inside but I probably should've chosen to sit outside just because of how crowded it was inside. Like I mentioned, it's a popular restaurant and I went at 12:30pm, so I didn't expect any less. What they lack in space, they definitely make up for in food. To start, I had the Rising Sun drink, which was the perfect blend of Prosecco and grapefruit, the buttermilk pancakes, the breakfast pizza, the steak and egg, and ended with the French toast as a dessert. Their plates are small, tapa-style dishes and come out in the order they're ready, so we didn't wait too long before we got our first dish. The food was amazing! The French toast and the breakfast pizza were probably my favorites and I definitely recommend them to everyone."}, {"review_id": "z_zYqWoZyZpIm-4FE_P0Rw", "user_id": "GfTyalM_cl67jz5GOTExiQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "It's hit and miss here although this is probably one of the restaurant we come the most in Miami.  We were told that there is nothing green here today and we are trying to be healthy and eat more vegetable than proteins.  Well, most of the dishes come with salad vegetables for decoration.   Anyways, 3 stars this time because the wrong info from the waiters and the sardine was too blacken /charcoal to my taste."}, {"review_id": "M6a8T_l0iIxvXP6dOFeetg", "user_id": "F0HY3FthKkr_DnAT1ONocg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "We loved the food here, the staffs, the service...So last night we drove around The designer district and then we decided that come here again.  First we ordered a glass of white wine, it took them 20 minutes to get it to us.

But the place was not 100% full so we asked them if the kitchen is working?  Second the food quality was not like before, we ordered the short rib pizza it was just \"fine\", the crispy pig ear my bf said it wasn't good.

I had Sunday Brunch and it was awesome.The short version of the story is that brunch is small plates and the two best dishes I had were the Kimchi Benedict and Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. I loved the contrast between the sour kimchi, the crispy pork belly, and the hollandaise. With the pancakes, the lemon and ricotta are baked in and topped with some type of berry compote or preserves. No need for syrup here!Other dishes I liked were the duck hash: the rosemary flavor reminded me of the holidays, and the fresh baked bread (especially the sourdough).A couple of misses was this risotto shrimp cake in the spirit of a crabcake - just didn't taste fresh and was dense. Additionally the Chilaquiles with no egg. I liked the riff with a green salsa but it's more of just chips and salsa as opposed to Chilaquiles. Lastly, the server seemed to be pissed or disappointed with our order which I didn't understand. He went on this diatribe about how he was waiting on our table out of his area because the other servers couldn't handle it, at the beginning of the meal. No offense dude but I am not interested in the workplace drama, just want to eat.  If the service was better and offerings more consistent, would have given 5 stars. Fortunately their best items are some of the best one can have."}, {"review_id": "RJZen819-uwD1mPFrSxxyw", "user_id": "Anb3E4ngYUbl-qoqxpp0tg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "When in the Design District and time to enjoy then treat yourself to Michael Genuines. Their house drink list is vast and refreshing and their menu selections have something for everyone.

It was pretty late night and me and some friends wanted to eat here because it was good for the time. The menu is is pretty decent, the prices were a little too high, and the portions were a bit too small for my taste. I thought the best part with their pig ears! They were freshly fried and crispy. They had a nice thick coating of batter that wasn't too salty. They gave a nice amount in a basket which is a huge plus for me. I thought my burger was ok, nothing too special. I originally wanted their meatball pizza but for some reason they ran out of an ingredient or maybe their oven was turned off already? idk, I was just irritated that they couldn't give me a pizza but they can make every other item on the menu lol. I wouldn't come back but if you're in the area shopping and want to go to a restaurant then I'd recommend this place because it's slightly fancy and has a good vibe for dinners."}, {"review_id": "cjnk4FpU6Xr7qXhFSKTg_g", "user_id": "1SXaFqsy8Qu9G59e6nGB-g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "After more than two handfuls of times here, I feel a review is in order! My family and I have been coming here for years. We really feel like it's one of the few restaurants that really warrants a drive down to Miami from North Broward.  The food is absolutely delicious. It's totally farm/sea to table, and it truly shows in their dishes. This is a small place, and it can get busy quickly. The tables are pretty close together inside, but outside seating will give you a bit more elbow room. There is also a bar to sit at and watch the drinks flow, and on that bar is also a raw seafood display. There, you will find different oysters, as well as some Stone Crab claws when in season.There are always some same things on the menu, but they are mixed with new and exciting menu items. We also try the crudo offered, and it's always amazing and delicious! Yesterday, we shared the most amazing LAMB ribs. They were tender, falling off the bone, and were perfectly charred with a crispy exterior. That wood oven is great! I also love their Crispy Hominy (offered as a snack, and also for Happy Hour), their Octopus, and their fish specials are great. In addition, their cocktails are a hit too! They aren't cheap, but they are innovative and good.Lastly, their desserts are definitely worth a mention, possibly some sort of award! The pastry program in on top of their game here, and each dish I've had is better then the last. Yesterday we had a Maple Pot de Creme with homemade French Krullers. It was topped with spiced pecans, And I couldn't stop eating it. We also had a Gooey Butter Pistachio cake- which was out of control and decadent!

Today, I left feeling extremely disappointed with my overall experience. The service and food quality have significantly changed. I've easily visited a good dozen times and have plenty​ to compare it to. No longer is this a 5-star​ experience, for me. I've chosen to update this review, lower my rating a bit, and offer some feedback. Had today been my first visit, I would have gone with a 3-star​ rating. I'm not sure what's going on internally, but something's amiss.To start, and the biggest part of all, service was beyond rushed. From start to finish, our waitress visited our table an obsessive amount of times. This wasn't a case of simple attentiveness. It felt more of \"I see you talking so you must be done. Can I bring you the check now? How about now? Anything else? Do you need anything else? Will you be ordering dessert? Are you done with this? Can I remove this from the table? I just brought you a new cocktail, but do you need anything else?\" My Bloody Mary still had a couple of sips and it was removed at some point when my head was turned. My girlfriend was still savoring the last bites of her dish and at least two people came over to ask if she was done. How dare our party leisurely sip cocktails, linger over food, and have a ​conversation in between bites?\" It was way too intrusive. The last straw? Having the waitress hover over my shoulder as I counted the money everyone pitched in. No! I am not ready to hand the bill over yet. I am still clearly COUNTING the money. For the love of God, let me breathe. In hindsight, I suppose I could have requested to speak to a manager and requested not to be bombarded as much. But I didn't think of it then and was trying to focus on my friends and enjoy brunch. The other surprising part was the change in food quality. I've gushed over the sweets/desserts at MGFD for the last 8 years.The Butterscotch Budino was exceptional, but the rest of the desserts I tried (Donuts, Lemon Cookies, and Cinnamon​ Bun) left a lot to be desired. Average. My apologies, but \"average\" has never been a part of the MGFD vocabulary. Excellent is what I expect and have always received from Michael's Genuine. My first review was in 2011 and I have never felt the need to update it. That's how consistent everything has always been.The Bloody Mary resembled nothing of the past and the Moscow Mule was served in a regular everyday water glass. My breakfast pizza followed the same fate. I was hungry. I ate it, yes. But I've had pizza here before. This is just not the quality I'm used to. The crust was flimsy and the tomato sauce too runny. I actually added salt to flavor something further that was to be incredibly savory already (bacon, mozzarella​, scallions, egg). I'm hopeful this was just a random off day and that future visits offer that genuine hospitality and holy-crap-this-is-amazing-food experience I've grown accustomed to. C'mon y'all, bring the magic back!"}, {"review_id": "vRVZnX_khmUekzQo0d7qyA", "user_id": "1JlOo8MoX4e67l34aRulrg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/4/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Well it's been 2 years and my review definitely needed a revision. It is still my go to restaurant in mid town however they no longer hold 5 stars for me. I find the service not to be 5 star quality as it once was. Perhaps it's due to the fact that good service is very hard to come by in South Florida in general and they don't retain their staff. We arrived and the restaurant was about half full inside around noon. We did not have reservations for lunch and the hostess really wanted us to sit outside. My lunch companion insisted on inside and luckily his wish was granted. Even though she said we would get a nice heater outside. Yeah right on the coldest day of the year I don't think so. Once seated we were immediately given our choice of water. My lunch companion wanted Proseco however the waitress was very insistent on pushing one from Oregon. He was not convinced being Italian that Oregon would be better than one from Italy. Her persistence made me believe she was being spiffed by her local distributor. A practice that I don't agree with just give us what we want please. Appetizer I wanted the deviled eggs again she tried to push the chips and dip. At least I won that battle. For lunch I had the roasted root vegetable salad. I was disappointed in the variety and the overwhelming spicy sauce that looked and tasted like wasabi. I tried to get it off each vegetable before proceeding with eating each bite. My dining companion had the swordfish it was presented in a very small dish like a saucer for a cup of tea very odd especially since that was his meal. We skipped dessert and thankfully our server stopped pushing but than again 50 people were standing and waiting to be seated between the bar area and outside. No one wanted seating outside I sat there previously and you truly are a after thought here I find. I had to go to the ladies room after ordering a cappuccino. The wait for the two toilets was insane also politically correct assigned no gender specification. Albeit thankfully the one I went to was clean. Before getting back to the table I noticed my lunch companion just finished with the check. So I quickly had my cappuccino before the door hit me in the bottom so to speak. Next time I will pick some where else to go. Too many choices in midtown."}, {"review_id": "IgRwVwNLluuyjiQgSWBwXA", "user_id": "M2lPfXY6pKcnmEd4MXW1xg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/26/2017", "text": "The ONLY REASON this place lost a star is the fact that some items are hit and miss. The good items are 10/10. The okay items will still run you $14 for a little plate, and you'll feel disappointed. With that being said, I went for brunch and ordered the lamb chops (10/10), yellowfin crudo (10/10), breakfast pizza (10/10), and house cured salmon (2/10), baked egg shakshuka style (1/10). You can see the polarity. They change the menu constantly which is good and bad. I was sad to see the twice baked double yolk leave. Another great thing about this place is PANTHER COFFEE. They serve panther coffee and a wide array of yummy cocktails. Their dessert menu is also on point. I had the apple pie which is served in a cast iron skillet with a dollop of heavy cream. It was PERFECTION.

This cute, nouveau restaurant is located in the heart of Midtown with plenty of street parking available. They have indoor/bar seating and a large patio, which is where we sat. We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, but once we sat our server, Marijah, greeted us quickly. That was the last of the quick service. We spent the entire dinner waiting and waiting for things--I would have given 4 stars because of the service, but the food was so damn good it made up for it! The cocktail menu is fairly decent in size and they have a full bar. As for food, they have small plates, medium plates, large plates, and extra large for sharing, as well as appetizers and snacks. I ordered a Harry's Sour for my cocktail and I ABSOLUTELY recommend it to any gin lovers out there! Just so you have an idea of how long you may be waiting: drinks took about 20 minutes to come out. Food, about 45, and it came out staggered. Personally, when I'm with a party I like when all of our food comes out together so we can eat together. My friends burger came out cold and another friends side came out 15 minutes after her food. I ordered the Crispy Pig Ears for an appetizer. It was a generous portion of spiced, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside strips--absolutely delicious! For my entree I ordered the Duck Confit, also superb. Our server said it was a small portion, but duck is so heavy that it definitely sufficed as a meal. Everyone enjoyed their food (except my friend who's burger was cold--server offered to get her a new one when she checked up on us 10 minutes after we got our food, but my friend didn't want to wait another hour for a new one). That same friend (rough night for her, I guess) ordered a michelada for her drink. Server said she wasn't sure if the bartenders would make it, as it's a brunch drink, but she would check. Comes back 20 minutes later with a Bloody Mary with a michelada rim (no beer) and friend was up charged for Tito's. Regardless of the service we still had a great experience and thoroughly enjoyed our meals!
