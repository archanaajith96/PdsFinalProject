We moved here from Portland last summer and have been missing great food and amazing sandwich shops. This is definitely Portland worthy and then some.  First thought was it's a little pricey but once I got the sandwich it was huge and the taste and high quality ingredients made it worth every penny. I had the Megadeath but every single sandwich on the menu sounds appealing and delicious.   The only thing I didn't care for was no sitting area or place to eat. It's more of a grab and go kind of place but don't let that stop you from trying this great place! I'll be back! Came back and tried a different sandwich that's called the Cure. So surprisingly amazing! I'm not a huge turkey fan but I shared the sandwich with someone so I was ok with it this time. Really, really impressed! The sharp white cheddar was killer and the mustard vinaigrette put it over the top. They used whole grain mustard for it which I love. I seriously don't think you can possibly get a bad sandwich here! So, so, so good!!"}, {"review_id": "o3WmJN5o62B2RJfKoxlKkA", "user_id": "cftcvPZCx9YxPhRaKkSI4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "Best sandwich in Missoula, great selection and flavor.Feels like a old school deli in New York!  You taste the love they put into their food!  Enjoy"}, {"review_id": "9AOMiUEOnsPVvdmFkwri9Q", "user_id": "IxeCSPOZ4tr3EH9uBQR6Tg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/2/2017", "text": "The megadeath sandwich was amazing.

This is easily one of the top 5 sandwiches I've had. Ever. Anywhere, including Europe. The meats are savory, with just the right amount of salt, the bread is perfect, the balsamic is delicious. It's a ten! Which sandwich am I chowing on, you ask? Well, I had a hard time choosing between the Pretender, the Megadeath, and the Zeppelin, but in the end, I went with the Zeppelin. For those who haven't had a chance to peruse the incredibly creative (and vegetarian friendly!) menu here, it's a riff on a classic Italian sammie. The prices are a little steep, but these sandwiches are easily two meals (or a meal for two, if you've got a dining partner!). Beer, wine, and a selection of bottled and canned drinks is also available. I knew I'd hit total nirvana when I saw that they serve my favorite crack-in-a-can (sold under the brand name La Croix). My tummy and tastebuds are now blissfully happy as I sit in my hotel room finishing up a mountain of work. This deli is on my list for my next visit!! (Oh, and they have some sweet dry goods and a great wine-by-the-bottle selection for sale too! Great place!!)"}, {"review_id": "UABPgGcET8RD7Q3qvjSixQ", "user_id": "R0iRcw42q7FYuz1ABdfe7g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/30/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Mega Death decent.

Came because of the high reviews, wouldn't put this place on my rotation of restaurants if I lived there locally.  Walked out for $40 and didn't buy drinks, this was for two people. I've been to NYC, which is what others have said this place is like, not true.  Just a hole in the wall place with average food in a strip mall, certainly not outstanding.

You can't go wrong with any of these sandwiches. Winners are Nirvana, Megadeath, Kiss, and New Edition. All on delicious chewy ciabatta and all fresh to order. You can even ask for any sandwich grilled which I've had the Kiss before grilled and it was a life changing experience. Don't forget about all their yummy deli items. Great selection of meat and cheeses to take home. I love all the different pastas and they have a beautiful set of Italian wines to choose from. What more could you want from a delicatessen? So grab a sandwich and go to the park.

They use high quality stuff and it is reflected in the taste. True artisan deli shop. According to the guy behind the counter they get special bread made daily.
