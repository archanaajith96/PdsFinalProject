Don't be deceived by the odd name, this place is King of the Nampa breakfast scene. The restaurant is so cozy inside, dark colors surround the booths and tables in the entrance area, off to the right is another dining room, larger, but still cozy feeling. Usually upon entering you are greeted by a sign asking you to seat yourself. The menu is classic breakfast; omelets, eggs, the usual meats and griddle fare. However they do it so well! I've got to come here a few times now so I've tried a lot of the specialties and all of them are top notch. LeBarons also does lunch and dinner however I have only been here for breakfast so that's the basis of this review. This time around on the advice of The Brother I had the chicken fried steak, eggs over easy, hash browns and I upped the bread to corn bread. Here, you can do toast or a biscuit or a pancake, but for a little bit more you can have your own little loaf of corn bread. The chicken fried steak was perfect, dripping with sausage gravy, crispy and the meat was tender. They do an excellent hash brown, crispy enough but The Brother suggests ordering it extra crispy. The eggs were perfect. Now the corn bread is tricky, I'm not typically a fan of sweet corn bread, and this is, however I will say it complimented the meal. I neglected to ask about it. The Bro, he had the normal combo, eggs over medium, hash browns extra crispy, bacon and a pancake. A pancake you think, but oh, gentle reader, let me clue you in. The pancake hangs over the side of the plate, it is very thick. See, now you're worried that pancake is going to be rubbery and tough. You would have worried for nothing, it was perfect in every way. Thank goodness he was full so I got in on that pancake. You may never travel through Nampa, Idaho, but if you do this place is bookmark worthy. The staff had always been very friendly and attentive. The prices are excellent. The food comes out in reasonable time, it's not what I would call fast but this quality of food takes time and its worth the wait."}, {"review_id": "Du4HzNrKgeH0sqbsUOIR6Q", "user_id": "ii4AvN-TesLY7UrlFv-J3A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Great comfort food.  Awesome breakfast.  Staff and owner are friendly.  One of the best in Nampa."}, {"review_id": "mWC-n-SnFiiFecPoRMfQ4A", "user_id": "EJvxK1zQlw3co_l5vT0U5g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "A cute Cafe, the waitresses are always amazing, food is good, and just has a homey feel."}, {"review_id": "S7aTxJHsXqZGX_ZUszJEWQ", "user_id": "HYVjFHN78O8ZnJVHSQ2NZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2017", "text": "As we cruised through the desolate streets of Nampa, we happened to turn to our right and there it was a shinning beacon restaurant packed with customers. We pulled in and decided to have lunch. We were seated ourselves in the back corner and were immediately greeted by the one and only Ryan Le Baron. He was an absolute PEACH. We had several questions about the menu because everything looked so AMAZING, we couldn't decide. Our table finally decided on the following items .....1. Hot Meat Sandwich with Pork Roast and mash potatoes. 2. Swiss Dip with Roast Beef 3. Idaho Melt with Fries 4. Turkey Club with Fries Ryan was very accommodating and answered several questions because we someone in my party had food allergies. ALL of the entrees were DELICIOUS! The fries were the BEST we have ever tasted! Another plus was the bacon was cooked to perfection and crispy! We really wanted pie, but they were sold out. However, I batted my eyes and smiled REAL big, Ryan prepared a fresh chocolate pie...Just for us! It was worth every calorie and bite! Absolutely DELISH! As if we weren't full enough...We decided to order two cinnamon rolls. I read they were big, but they were GINORMUS! They were spectacular too! I would highly recommend this family owned and operated restaurant. They have a wide variety of items on the menu to satisfy everyone in your family! Thank you Ryan for the SUPERIOR customer service and memorable experience!"}, {"review_id": "xgeHaT5TaqdGIHEyx0wCVg", "user_id": "drq0zOa9zVaWqupAmsmH6w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/29/2016", "text": "The best gravy I've ever had in my life!!!

Came here because the name really stuck out and glad we did. The service was quick and friendly. We started with mozzarella sticks which they served with an interesting ranch sauce. I got the beef stroganoff special which wa very creamy and nice. The only thing is it needed salt and I am not a salt user, but otherwise it was good. I'd love to go back if I am ever in the area, but I don't expect to be so you guys go for me!"}, {"review_id": "zFjOoTvnYpHS0-S-VUOdtA", "user_id": "0XJRyXWDaYKPhumxKBsHoQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/1/2017", "text": "Nice clean diner.

The Manager \"Rob\" is great with catering and just great customer service skills in general. 2nd time in past few months we have let them cater our dinner events and it was awesome. Everyone liked the fettuccine with chicken and pasta with meat sauce. The decorative salads are huge. Cannot beat the quality and the price.

The food was not good.  I had a hot turkey sandwich. My first clue should have been when the waitress was not sure if they could make the item.The mashed potatoes were really good but that was it. The bread was toasted and buttered, never had a hot turkey on toast but that was ok. Turkey was real but hard and to warm it up they grilled it and they gravy was the worst. It was a gravy base and gelatinous not good.  I pushed as much of the gravy off my food as I could so that I could try to have a little bit of what was left. I wish I would have had breakfast that may have been better. Two other tables complained about their food while I was there, one of which was a soup was not warm so the employee took the soup and put it in the microwave and brought it back.  If you are going to use the microwave can you put it out of the customers sight and hearing. I don't live here but would not eat lunch here again I may try breakfast but considering the quality of my lunch I probably would not go back. One other thing, when I was looking up places to eat one of the things that drew me here was the menu shows that they have different types of pies, not true, on this day there was only apple. Very misleading. I hope that I came at a bad time and that my experience is not the norm. Wish them the best."}, {"review_id": "7kvqSDKIlNqqjsVsn1ej9w", "user_id": "ZR9pQ4igTXA7y4fH9deOyA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2017", "text": "Good old fashioned diner cooking!
