Wow - I never knew burgers could be this amazing.  Seriously, everything we tried was AMAZING.  We actually came a second time to try more food. The first night we started with drinks; beer and \"Just What I Needed\" (margarita), then both had a \"For Those About To Rock\" (long island).  Beverages were really good and reasonably priced.  We also ordered the habanero fried pickles to start.For dinner, we had the Cowboy Carl and the Springphilly. OMG, I can't even begin to tell you how amazing these burgers were.  Seriously mouthwatering.  We also shared an order of hickory smoked french fries.A couple days later, we came for lunch and tried the You Are Smokin' (pulled pork french fries), Bleus Brothers and What the Dr. Ordered. And again, our minds were blown by how delicious this food was. Oh, and how could I forget about the Purple Haze shake with Blackberry Whiskey. Omg delish!!! We will definitely be back next time we are in Springfield."}, {"review_id": "hIKIPWXhOYP5mIPVCft4sg", "user_id": "V8KWA8_Ud1O-IxsBMu4PPA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Beautifully crafted burgers.  I love that they have specially made angus patties without hormones antibiotics or steroids. My 10 yo loves the ugly burger but didn't realize it came with 2 patties. So she shared with her 8 yo sister who only had the kids hot dog.Hubs got the cowboy Carl burger which is fried onions, brisket pickles, bbq sauce with a patty.  The thing was so tall!!! Beyond all that the service was amazing. Only lost a star for the greasy fingers on the bun and from the patties.  And the burger was more rare than medium (not a complaint but just observation).Great place to stop if you're going thru Springfield!"}, {"review_id": "0dLa5Q46TOfrrObeN2Nr7w", "user_id": "obVugsrQweNiDTsNziYxdw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "I came here on a whim, as I thought alcohol in a milkshake in the middle of the day sounded exactly like the kind of thing I ought to do on my day off with the wife. I was right. The whiskey infused shake made up for their odd rustic decor and overly meat-a-tarian menu.I would have given a 3 star review myself, as their \"bean veggin' out\" veggie burger was a very weak comparison to my wife's meaty burger. They are also obsessed with mayonnaise, and I'm a mustard man. But, the fries, and the sheer joy on my wife's face while eating, brought me up to a reluctant 4 stars. I hear, through the social media grape-vine, that some of their locations have other vegetarian options that are superior. I'll update once I've tried those, if they are any better."}, {"review_id": "CaBLR_49J7EHXCYkjp9OJQ", "user_id": "79pcglGQONiSR_eKvdPTIw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Food was amazing and staff was always nice.

This craft burger spot is nestled in the cute downtown area of Springfield, which just added to the charm! My family of 4 each got a burger and shared a basket of fries, and it was plenty of food. We went with the Apple Smoked fries, and holy moly those were good. You definitely got the smoked flavor, and we asked for the truffle mayo and chipotle ketchup for dipping. The truffle mayo was above and beyond amazing, and I'm not even a mayo person! For the burgers I got the Cowboy Carl, which was the largest regular burger I've ever seen. Burger, cheese, BRISKET, candied bacon, crispy onion, and bbq sauce. It was MASSIVE. The brisket held its own, and I could cut it  with my fork. Like, woah. The candied bacon was delightful, and the bbq sauce was slightly spicy. This burger was AMAZING. My sister got the Dr. Orders burger, which had a fried egg on top. She loved it! My mom prefers simple things, and got the standard Ugly Cheeseburger. It came with the house sauce on it, and she loved it as well. For someone who likes a no frills burger, the Ugly Cheeseburger is your go-to. My dad was trying to be different and he got the Chicken Bijan. Chicken breast, prosciutto, greens, on ciabatta bread. He enjoyed it, but I'm pretty sure he was making eyes at my fancy burger. Mine was so big, though, everyone got to partake in the crispy onions! We were too full to even try a shake, but they seemed pretty legit! Highly recommend Black Sheep if you're in Springfield!"}, {"review_id": "o82VAcvekSCNt3yWD5K7Bg", "user_id": "RK6M4d6gjU3J3U_PqnFtYg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Was in the area for work and decided to come here for lunch.

I went there after a recommendation from a friend! I was not disappointed! We started with an appetizer of Salt and Vinegar fries which were so good!!!

You could color me surprised when we drove to the downtown area for dinner and found a really nice spot full of restaurants, bars, and shopping. We had a lot of places to choose from, but a burger sounded good and Black Sheep was recommended to by the staff at our hotel. Parking was a little bit of a pain, even on the Tuesday night that we were here. It seemed like it was mostly all street parking, as far as we could tell, and there wasn't a lot of it. They seem to have grown their demand faster than their available parking in this downtown area, unless we just happened to miss it all. It was a nice area to walk around either before or after dinner though.The place is cool. It is very much the kind of place you see pop up in the predominantly young professional populated urban areas in gentrified sections of downtowns that seem to be filling out most big cities in the Midwest right now. Exposed utilities, old brick walls, big wooden tables, low-key lighting, an open kitchen; they really marked off all the checkboxes here. While it is a little cookie cutter with all the trendier restaurants becoming popular, it is an atmosphere that I like a lot. We were seated immediately, but it did seem like a busy place. We put in drink orders, which consisted mostly of their local selection. They had a good tap selection of craft beers, but not as many local options as some other places we went to. Their drink menu also consisted of some cocktails and a half dozen or so alcoholic shakes (that could also be ordered N-A), that sounded delicious.Their food menu is on the smaller side, but does have some very unique options. It's predominantly burgers with some sides/appetizers and a couple salad options along with a veggie burger. Their burger topping combinations are pretty crazy, and it's worth checking out the menu to see for yourself. Burgers are served à la carte, so a burger and a side of fries is going to put you around $15-$16, which is definitely on the high side for that. They certainly add value with their unique combinations, the burgers are very large, and they do advertise antibiotic/hormone/steroid free meat, so their prices are on par with the value of what they serve, in my opinion.I had good service on my single trip here. This is definitely a place I would go back to for a great burger if I was looking for that in the area again. It'd be hard to go to with a large group since their menu is so limited, but as long as everyone eats meat and isn't counting calories, you won't have an issue. I do wish they had a few more local beers on tap in place of some of the mass distributed stuff.  It seems more fitting for a place like this."}, {"review_id": "tcfiqg7OHGfr0du2sJvieg", "user_id": "Nd9V0NC_FKC4sWP_Oxuuhw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/9/2017", "text": "Great first visit to black sheep! Friendly service, decent pricing, and plenty that I'd come back to taste.I highly recommend the Cowboy Carl ($12)...so check out the photo! It was packed with beef, brisket, bacon, and onion strings, and I think it definitely lived up to the hype! The BBQ sauce on the burger was sweet, not too overwhelming, and was perfectly hidden amongst all the toppings.Our table also ordered the fried pickles ($6), spicy onion rings ($6), and the apple 'n hickory smoked fries (4). I wasn't too impressed with the fried pickles, and although I liked the onion rings, there were so many that came on the burger. My favorite side was the order of fries (plenty to share), because you can clearly smell and taste the smokey flavor!

Food I had:  Cowboy Carl. This is a beef patty,  brisket, bacon, spicy onion ring, and Bbq sauced burger that was literally as tall as a pint glass (see pic). Great blend of flavors, although it's a Bbq burger (so if you like mustard/mayo/cheese, choose another one). Spicy onion rings were a nice blend of sweet/spicy, brisket was thick, and the bacon was more sweet than salty. I also had the strawberry shake, which was good. Don't expect a blended strawberry shake - think vanilla custard with strawberry chunks.  Not too big, not too small, and not overly sweet or flavored. It's a well made shake. Ambience:  has a nice pub feel with the lighting, green chairs that pull up to the bar area. Except instead of a full bar, they have the kitchen (full bar is available, just not on display).  Slots of TVs worth sports - I'm sure this place is happening at night. Service:  Matt was great. Casual but on his game, willing to make recommendations, and very friendly. Drinks:  I had lunch, so no drinks. But they had close to 30 beers, 7-8 cocktails, and a couple of wines. They also have adult shakes. I'd definitely come back and try more of their menu.  Tip:  downtown location does not have the waffle Mac and cheese (that is the south side location."}, {"review_id": "aBzZ1PC-HnFdjRcvbHoaWA", "user_id": "fp5lu4EwQNfmFn47n-Rhvg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Gluten free buns that don't taste like a typical GF bun:) Burgers and fries were great.
