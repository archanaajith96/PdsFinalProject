Wonderful waitress named, Leslie...super friendly and incredibly attentive. They have the most amazing French fries...of you have been, then you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about  :)The atmosphere is kick ass! Then again, I am a sucker for historic buildings and I absolutely love when the restaurant is decorated as such to give an updated look while at the same time, leaving those hints of historical charm all over. I took a buddy of mine there this time and he had never been until now. He loved it as well. Was happy to introduce it to him.Menu items are the right amount...I think, lol. There are a few items I wouldn't mind seeing on their menu that aren't, but I'm a SUPER picky eater....it usually annoys the shit out of everyone I go out to eat with ‍ Can't help it, hahaha!If you're in Boise and want a nice restaurant that's not overpriced...check this one out.

We went here for Saturday brunch after hearing from several sources that it would blow our minds. It was \"meh\" at best. The food was lackluster and the service was mediocre.

It's not too sweet but doesn't have overkill on he vanilla or honey flavor (though you do taste both). Asparagus fries - I don't get the hype - yes they were good, and the ranch was good as well, but I think I would be willing to try other things. Maybe since it's a healthier version of something fried? The butter cake - yummy, but the center part was the star. The outside was fairly dry, and that's what I saved the ice cream for - the outside bites. I recommend sharing this with someone because at the end, you're kind of over it. A couple fresh berries added a little pizazz to it.

We got seated immediately and the service was exceptional from beginning to end.For food, we split the cinnamon roll for apps. I got the northwest scramble with avocado while the bf went with Dungeness crab scramble. The cinnamon roll here is like nothing you've had before. It is rich and you know eating it is sinful when they give you a steak knife to cut it . We loved our entrees as well and overall were very satisfied with our brunch!Also, for the Bloody Mary lovers out there, their make your own Bloody Mary bar is a treat!"}, {"review_id": "HgjzwuN5uZd8AIgySxfgsw", "user_id": "Sa6ijGEuhvTOrArPBg-lTw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "This is more of an \"I'm in shock\" review than anything else. We love Fork, we eat here every few months. But today after brunch, we brought home a cinnamon roll for my daughter who couldn't come along with us. I snuck a bite and THERE WAS A BUTTON in the dough! We called the restaurant and after being put on hold for a good amount of time, the acting manager came on the line and was less than sympathetic. His response to the situation was super awkward and borderline rude. He noted that the chef was wearing the same coat as he was yesterday when making the rolls and no button was missing (ok, ew - why no clean coat?!) but that they'd \"look into it\" and someone would call me tomorrow. (I had to ask him if he needed my phone number to call me back so not sure about the sincerity of that statement. )We were polite and definitely are not looking for a handout, freebie, etc., just thought the restaurant should know that a customer bit into a button. Why not just take responsibility and apologize? Super disappointed with the way the situation was handled, and now feeling like the kitchen is less clean/sanitary than we thought. Thumbs down, Fork. Photo of button for the manager who seemed to believe that a lost button in the cinnamon roll was impossible."}, {"review_id": "ud8rQzy-UvwSCawjbyvUxA", "user_id": "6OGH68sIHNLqxw5B1NhR2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Fork is excellent local farm to table.  I appreciate knowing exactly where my food comes from which they tell you at the bottom of the menu.  Everything I've tried on the menu has been excellent.  We had asparagus and grilled cheese tomato soup as apps.  Excellent.  The tomato bisque is AMAZING!!!!   Asparagus fries also very good.  For dinner one person had the filet, two people had the short ribs, one had salmon and one had ravioli.  I had a small taste of every entree.  EXCELLENT!  Every meal came out not only looking like a super fancy restaurant judged on presentation, but every meal could have won the competition.  Eye appealing and taste appealing.  Seriously very good food here!  For dinner we had the cowboy crunch and a scoop of strawberry and vanilla.  The dairy is also the same where we get our milk from.   Very tasty! The cowboy crunch is a Heath specialty and super delicious!

Idaho has so many rivers with amazing fishing that it would make sense to order fish. For me personally, I prefer beef over fish any day, but I had to order Idaho rainbow trout. It's like ordering spaghetti instead of pho at a Vietnamese restaurant. I wasn't disappointed. It was delicious. Even the skin didn't smell fishy. The fish meat was pink and perfectly seasoned. It was served over grilled kale. Wow, that was amazing as well. It was a perfect #Thinsulin approved green light dish!

Way top notch examples of exemplary service!I explained my taste preferences and Ty made me \"Thyme for Bourbon,\" from the drink menu which was perfect and recommended the scrumptious Cubano sandwich that accommodated my taste for tartness. The Cubano boasted unique flavors of slow roasted pork, Swiss cheese, pickles and what is called the chef's 'mad mustard' sauce. Ty and Rodney were both attentive and listened to understand instead of to react or respond...KUDOS! I posted a picture of my awesome O sandwich and mind you, I already demolished the salad as well as the second half will be dinner later!!Thank you Fork, Cameron, Rodney, and Ty!!!"}, {"review_id": "xlQufd1JQs0nfCH7G4zK8Q", "user_id": "WjsZSsBbUTwkGUIkv7TpjQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "If you want flavor and freshness look no further!

Every time I have out of town friends and family visit, I bring them here. The food, wine/drink list, ambiance, and its prime location make Fork a staple for downtown Boise!Vibes:Oh-so-classy. Fork sits on the corner of 8th and Idaho in an old building with plenty of charm. This spot can cater to almost any occasion as it has the capacity to be both swanky and casual at the same time (I've come here for lunch dressed in everyday attire, brunch in workout clothes, and dinner with high heels and a cocktail dress on). It's beautifully decorated inside and embellished with wine-bottles galore, dressed with large windows that look out over Idaho street, and has an open/spacious feel due to its high ceiling. Food:Geez, where do I begin? The grown-up grilled cheese? Asparagus fries? Grilled cheese with tomato soup fondue? Crispy Brussels sprouts? Butter cake? Spare ribs? Honestly, all of it is good. Follow your gut (literally), it won't disappoint. (Okay, but you really need to get the Asparagus Fries.)Drinks:Dry red wines are where I live, and Fork has a generous selection that will appeal to any winos palate. The last time I came here, I settled on the Route Stock (California wine), and I think this will be my go-to from here on out. It was dry with a slightly fruity finish. SO good and reasonably priced ($11/glass). Service:Fabulous! Friendly staff, prompt and timely flow of courses, and helpful answers to whatever questions we had about their menus. Win-win all around! (I've only ever had a good experience here, Fork has got top-notch customer service dialed in to an art form!)"}, {"review_id": "REVgoGb_ZCy77RQFdztqIQ", "user_id": "zD3Rqw_weYoVH3L9pfh3rg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "A warm inviting restaurant.

Prior to actually dining in this restaurant, we had major issues trying to get a reservation, the host or whomever that was taking the call was very rude over the phone and blatantly told us they \"We don't have any openings ok\" when we first initially called and asked about their hours, and if they can accommodate a party of 10+. Later when we called back (probably an hour later), we got 2 different reservations for 2 different groups just fine (a group of 6 and group of 12). Now... when we got to the restaurant an hour early and when we let the hostest know that the group of 12 and 6 had arrive, we weren't really greeted friendly, kind of got that annoyance attitude. The group of 6 was seated on time, and basically when the group of 6 was done eating the group of 12 was finally seated (almost an hour later the reservation time). Moving forward the waiter/server was very friendly and attentive, the food itself was just Meh. Nothing stood out, nothing was that special. I remember the burger was under seasoned, the tomato soup was bland, and the famous asparagus fries were just ok. Overall this place already started off bad with the poor service from the front of the house and somewhere in between it got slightly better, but it ended with just mediocre food that isn't really worth the hype of price. I do not recommend this place."}, {"review_id": "c85wwzv2USItSyMD9pnJgg", "user_id": "UuGckGp9CPZJseCEqp0Smg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Fork was our introduction to what Boise had to offer in the culinary department.
