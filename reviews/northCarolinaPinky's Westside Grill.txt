There's a Giant Triceratops dinosaur out front and a VW bug on top of the building. It was an awesome day so we got to sit outside and enjoy the shaded patio spot. The wait staff was helpful but all had a stand off-ish rock n roll vibe. Good at they job but not bubbly. I think it kinda fit the atmosphere and they all work together to help your table. The food was GREAT. There tons of different options - tacos, burgers, hot dogs, salads and we all had a hard time choosing. I love the large number of vegetarian options- even veggie dogs! My parents loved the hot dog and I loved the buffalo shrimp tacos. The tacos had arugula and Gorgonzola and were so fresh, not too spicy. The sweet potato fries and waffle fries were nice n crispy with great dipping sauces - get BOTH Wasabi Ranch and Honey Mustard!! The famous shrimp corn dogs were tasty - battered whole shrimps with dipping sauce and slaw. Also the black beans side dish BLEW US AWAY. I was not excited about them but the flavor was so dang good we fought over them. The drink menu is fun and huge- the cocktails all looked strong and tasty. We kept saying we'll be back soon!"}, {"review_id": "C3Dyxp_hMrGs8AQP2-DjbQ", "user_id": "0mRh6teyYn5n1AmN3fYvZw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I love this place so much!I have been here to many times I've lost count!I normally come here during the weekends but this time 2 friends and I decided to come for lunch on a Friday.It does not matter the day or the time, Pinky's is always packed. However, the waiting time is not bad since they have many tables. The parking at the restaurant is pretty small however they have a parking lot a few steps from the restaurants that fits a lot of cars. Everything they serve is good, but I always go with the shrimp corn dog and the waffle fries. They are my favorite and I can't go there without having them! One one my friends had a chicken sandwich that she said was good and the other one had the white trash burger with some fried squash that she really enjoyed. My meal as always was really good! The servers are nice and attentive. Since they are always busy the food can take a little while to get ready so if you are in a rush this is definitely not the place for you. The decoration is cool and different and their prices are great!I didn't know they had banana pudding but reading the reviews on Yelp I found that they served some pretty good one. I had to find out myself and was really surprised! It costed a little bit over 3$ and was so much banana pudding that I had to take home to share with my husband!I highly recommend this place!"}, {"review_id": "eCJ7o6P3HP9tB0CAiOAJdQ", "user_id": "0EgbVtQfdNQq3Tapxwl_sw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I've been on a Pinky's kick lately, and it's become one of my favorite spots. Everything I've ordered here has been exceptional. The food is killer, and the prices are more than reasonable. Check out my previous review for specific recommendations. I love that Pinky's has kind of a grungy vibe, sometimes coupled with death metal churning away on the patio, and a bevy of tattooed and tough-looking waitstaff, yet I still receive excellent service and share the restaurant with every kind of person that calls Charlotte home. And it's a fantastic spot to bring out-of-towners!Pinky's is more than legit. They've got a loyal fan in me."}, {"review_id": "PtjVUo35ZDDM0kSeMtIHtQ", "user_id": "8pmxwY_nmXYBzKPa-klk3Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Again here is another Charlotte institutions that it took me to long to get to. I actually watched the episode of Triple D before going and was curious by cornbread battered shrimp which was amazing!I was super surprised by the large amount of vegetarian options on the menu including veggie chili, veggie dogs, and even better the Veggie Corn dog!!! The prices are really what makes this place stand out, everything is very reasonable and matches the low key paper trays that all the food comes out on.They also have a solid beer selection along with a full bar. If the weather is nice you should sit outside on their porch. Parking can be a bit dicey due to the corner it is on, so keep an eye open as you get close."}, {"review_id": "W6HXFMPn36VV371roaHJLg", "user_id": "q_wVhULPqerYHmov0eXbww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "What a fun place with good ol fashion \"junk\" food, but the taste was fantastic.   We got some fantastic deep fried crab puppies.  They were full of crab and they came with some fantastic tartar sauce.  Another appetizer we got, which was the best thing we got was the Pimp'n Fries.  One of the best things I have ever have.  Waffle fries drenched in a pimento cheese mix.  Just fantastic.  Worth the calories and guilt when they are gone.  Get them!!!We had burgers, chili dogs and a salad.  They were above average.  Not the best ever but good.  This place is legit because of all the comfort food options and the price is so cheap.  What a reasonable price for great food and beer.  The happy hour specials which are always going are fantastic.  This place will become a regular for me.

As I was eating it,I noticed that it didn't taste the same and wasn't as good. The last time couple of times  I had it they used, fresh Romaine lettuce and had fresh onions and fresh chicken. This time they used a soggy Spring mix lettuce (which I hate) and it only had one piece of onion that wasn't fresh. Being that I was hungry, I decided to keep eating it, only to chew on something that scratched my tongue. I spit it out and it was a piece of friggin plastic. I'm so livid right now. Although Pinky's has been one of my favs, I don't think I will be able to go back because of this. Not sure if they have new cooks and or staff but that is totally unacceptable."}, {"review_id": "nE7xvUQdY9sG1JTwNta7iA", "user_id": "3Bjgzm6XMbq14FiXVrdD6A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Our party of six came in here on a cold, rainy Sunday evening.  The place was busy and we were told about a 15-20 minute wait, which turned into 50 minutes.  Meanwhile, smaller parties of 4 were being seated immediately.  The host kept apologizing but that didn't get us seated any sooner.  I saw two tables empty and they could have been pushed together for six people but it didn't happen.  They were given to people who came in after us.  Eventually, we were seated and the waitress did immediately come to take our drink order.  During our wait to be given a table, we had already memorized the menu and decided what we wanted, so she took our food order also.  I ordered the popcorn chicken and husband wanted the corn dog shrimp. I ordered the mixed drink called Unicorn's tears.  Everyone's drinks came but mine.  I had to ask about it and there was another wait because the waitress forgot to put the drink order in.  She apologized and eventually, our food and my drink arrived.  The food was good and husband was pleased with his shrimp.  I didn't like the Southern slaw, but my chicken and waffle fries were fine.  Others in our group were happy with their food also.  I think I would have enjoyed the evening more if it had gone smoother with the seating issue.  I was ready to go somewhere else after the 20 minute mark had passed and seeing others be given a table ahead of us.  I liked the atmosphere, loud music, eclectic people...but it will be awhile before I return."}, {"review_id": "UPLY6Tm6liwl1A2-VeSUKQ", "user_id": "V_RcZKv2ZxWzdUQYZlCpGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Ordered a burger  from here and it was pretty good.

Most featured eateries I have been to are lack luster. Pinky's is fun, colorful, and so so yummy. If you're calorie conscious, give that up for one night, it will be worth it. Pinky's not only has a variety of delicious burgers, but they have amazing drinks. Their drinks have fun clever names, like Unicorn Tears. I have had their veggie burger and their meat options, and I wish I had a second stomach so I could eat more. They also have scrumptious sides and an addicting was ranch to dip things in. I always say I am going to order their banana pudding for dessert, but I stuff myself on the other yummies beforehand and fill myself up. One day, it will happen.

My family made it to the restaurant first and already was seated when we arrived. We came in sat down and just a short time later we were greeted and had our drink orders were taken. We initially ordered the crab puppies and Greg's fried pickles. Those came out and the pickles were just ok but the crab puppies were awesome!!! For our main meal I ordered the mammoth burger with everything. A short time later it arrived and it was truly mammoth! See attached picture. Beer selection was good. I would have liked to see some more IPA's but what they had was ok. Overall I gave Pinky's 5 stars for the overall atmosphere, food, and drinks. Parking is ok just have to walk around the front, which was needed after eating all that food.  We will definitely go back next time we are in town."}, {"review_id": "4kTdqBMoxZsmfq9fcAGAbw", "user_id": "mOanh--SkJagXdsfJU3wxQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "Looking for an eclectic restaurant ? A place that stimulates both your vision and taste buds? Pinky's Westside Grill is your place! Located in a the corner of a busy intersection, they only have 3 parking spots in the parking lot in front of the restaurant. You will have to park in a dirt lot located behind the business. Not an issue unless its raining. I ordered the Pimpin' french fries with chili as an appetizer and they were delicious! Order a side a ranch, just to make it a tad healthier ;) Loved the waffle cut fries they use for this dish because it allows for more surface for the cheese and chili! Maybe I would add jalapenos next time too! I ordered a White Trash Cheese burger and I will never order a cheese burger another way!! This cheese burger came with pickles and fried onion strips.. YUMMM... I added some mustard and maybe would have added some jalapenos as well.. .but that might just be my pregnancy craving at the moment.

I have bypassed this place for years and never thought not even once to step foot in.Yesterday myself and some friends wen't here for a quick bite to eat for lunch. The menu itself was very interesting catchy and funny style names of the burgers and meals,as well everything was super cheap. I was going to be extra and order the nature boy just because im a fan of the great Rick Flair. But instead i ordered the ding dong chicken which i was a little skeptical of ordering when i noticed a crunchy peanut butter spread present on the sandwich, but then i said to myself what the hay YOLO (you only live once) and decided i was going to take a chance if i die i die! To my surprise the burger was tasty and not at all what i was expecting and it was a nice touch with the honey cilantro slaw. My friends ordered the white trash burger, fried squash, and the highly recommended corn dog shrimp with waffle fries. Of coarse i had to taste test their food since this was  my first time and they both been before. Everything was definitely very consistent and up to par in my opinion. If you just want a cheat day and just want something out of control good with everything you can imagine,well Pinky's is the place to be.Oh how can i forget that banana pudding all i going to say is its sinful you don't want to visit and not get any point,blank,period."}, {"review_id": "5G8ExvZJHWLdzRPKYL-KXQ", "user_id": "KBc-eocfU4yo9sLVL6yCKQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "Would LOVE to write a review on the food but I cannot.  Why?  Well, after parking in a very muddy, rut-filled gravel/mud parking lot, we walked in and stood at the hostess stand...After five minutes of being ignored, seeing the hostess walk by us three times, ignoring us to help others, we left!

Great suggestion especially since this is another spot that has been featured on one of my favorite food show Diners Drive Inn and Dives. The place is a great dive bar with a really cool patio! There are all types of cool artifacts on the walls. Are bartender also was really great and made sure my friends and I got our orders in before the kitchen closed! I got the 5 ounce PTERODACTYL burger with everything on it. All burgers are cooked medium well and my burger was juicy something I look for when eating a good burger. Unfortunately the burgers don't come with fries so I had to order them as a side. They give you a good amount of waffle fries which was a good thing because u shared them with my friend. I had my burger prepared with everything on it just one of the various ways you can get.They also have other menu items including crab puppies (hush puppies with crab in them) and corn dog shrimp! Can't wait to go back and try both of them on my next visit. They have a great drink menu and even a section for those who don't drink alcohol.
