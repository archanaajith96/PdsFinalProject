What a fun surprise! I hardly noticed this place at all. Happy that I stopped in. The staff was extremely friendly. The food was as to be expected, a little more expensive than other places in the area though. Food tasted pretty good and came to the table fairly quick. The best part of our visit was the live mariachi band. They play music for everyone, but will play you a song for a tip. It adds a little something to the atmosphere. Plus it helps keep the noise from other patrons less noticeable. I will be back soon."}, {"review_id": "M8P7BZa_aWzsmqlDXHpPEw", "user_id": "vv-Td14aMKeKqqZ_51Ck7w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2017", "text": "Is it weird that they sat me in the section with the only other white people, cut off from the rest of the dining room? Whatever I'm being paranoid! The waiter was very quiet, almost shy. Not rude though. The service was VERY fast. Complimentary chips and salsa came right away. The salsa is kind of a soupy warm style. I chose the taco dinner, Al Pastor. The flavor was very nice and the portion was more than enough for a \"big boy\" like me. I like this place. It seems like a nice restaurant to bring your family. If you're in the area give 'em a try.

The Chiles Rellenos are phenomenal, and so is the Pastor. We've never once gotten food that wasn't perfect. We usually get it to go, and our orders are always 100% accurate. The people who work there are always very friendly and go out of their way to make us feel welcome and valued. I honestly can't say enough good things about this place. No wonder they are always packed."}, {"review_id": "GpTVFMs_EeMyIZ7GaPiB5Q", "user_id": "1CwAh3BEGmazKzs7mf1Agg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/1/2017", "text": "Slooooow service, decent food.Went with coworkers during the week for lunch.

Once seated, two separate waitresses came and asked us what we wanted to drink at separate times so I don't know who our waitress was since we didn't see them again. Our drinks and salsa were low but no one was around to refill them. I asked a random waiter for water but it never came. Service is terrible. My husband had the al pastor taco dinner and they were fantastic! The meat was perfectly seasoned served with a side of rice and refried beans. I ordered the green sauce chicken enchiladas. The sauce was a bit bitter and the chicken had a weird taste but it had yummy melted cheese and sour cream.All in all, the food was not bad, maybe I need to come back on a weekday?"}, {"review_id": "NAAaU-A5DcF5PqjfD46wZg", "user_id": "OgnonyfTqjV07ibXTSpQmQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/26/2017", "text": "Been coming here since i was little.
