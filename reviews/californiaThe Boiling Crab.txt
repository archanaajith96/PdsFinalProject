One thing they all have in common is that agonizing wait. Every time I go it's expected to have a 1-2 hour wait. However this time, I went on a Tuesday at around 8PM with a group of 5. The wait was only 10 minutes, which was foreign to me but no complains here.As much as I love the shellfish, my cholesterol levels don't like it as much. So when I go, I use to get the 1/2 pound of shrimp and 1/2 pound of crawfish, sausages, a piece of corn with the wholeshabang sauce. I normally get the medium spice level because mild you really can't taste much. I feel like you're just eating boiling seafood at that point. I think the food is great but nowadays, I only get the fried catfish basket with the cajun fries. I don't know if this is new but they have a lemon pepper fries flavor so I got that this time. Both are great. The fish basket comes with 4 good size pieces of catfish. It is totally worth it! Service: Great but that's probably because it was a weekday night and it wasn't crowded. Vibe: If you're been to one, you've been to them all. They all have the same under the sea garage type feel to it."}, {"review_id": "IszbBE-s6gGNtXwTIcIYsA", "user_id": "d6gc4ADgKZmDtMy_P40nVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Ahh boiling crab...how I can't seem to shake you!!I've been going to this boiling crab location since 2009 and its still soo good!!(Just more expensive and smaller portions.

Nothing else compares (swear). I've tried other Cajun Seafood places in SJ (e.g. Kickin Crab, Crawdaddy (my 2nd fav), Claw Shack) and their sauces doesn't satisfy my tastebuds the same way.

Why are you so delicious. My waist line can't take anymore. And my sodium levels are through the roof. Why do you do this to me with your deliciousness. Menu is pretty simple. Pick your choice of seafood and weight. Pick your sauce. Two words whole sha-bang, or is that three words? Anyways, pick your spice level. Eat comfortable with mild or die sweating and flagging down your waiter for water with spicy. They have fried options as well but I've never tried it. And of course, raw oysters! They won't seat your party unless everyone is there. I say if you're not there when our table is ready then you're out of luck cause boiling crab waits for nobody! Jk I never say that, that's mean. Poor servers are always running to fed everyone. This place is nearly always packed with a long wait!

We've tried going to the one on Curtner but the wait is always an hour plus. Thanks just goodness we got luck and only had a 15 minute wait today. Maybe cuz of the rain. If you've been to a BC, you've been to them all. Their restaurants are all decorated the same as well as the menu (obviously). We got:1.5 lh if shrimp with the whole sha bang sauce, mild, with corn on the cob in the bag1 lb of shrimp with the garlic sauce, mild, and with corn on the cob in the bagCajun friesEverything tasted great and not too salty. Although, it can get a bit overwhelming after a while. Also, if you've never been here before, be prepared to get your hands dirty! (Ooh! Use the lemon wedges they give you and rub it all over your hands after you finishing eating to help get rid of the smell before washing your hands!)The staff here are great and always took the time to check in on you and make sure your meal is still going well.Overall, it's definitely worth a try.

I told them to go the Boiling Crab that had the most reviews thinking the popular location was on Curtner but I guess I didn't realize that the Capitol Expressway location was more popular. The first Boiling Crab that I've been to was the one on Curtner and I used to frequent that one in San Diego in Mira Mesa a lot when I was in college. Boiling Crab restaurant are known to have super long wait times, usually up to 2 hours. When we came they told us the wait was 1 hour and 45 minutes! OMG it was so long but expected. We ended up going to the Target in the same parking lot and getting some of their Pizza Hut personal sized pizzas to tide us over while we waited LOL.I ended up ordering 1/2 lb of shrimp and 1 lb of mussels tossed in the whole shebang sauce and a corn. I usually get crawfish instead of mussels but I was too lazy to peel. The reason we came was because my uncle is a huge seafood lover and we wanted him to try the Alaskan King Crab. He enjoyed it but the shells were too hard to cut through even with the utensils provided.  He ended up only being able to eat two legs then having to take the rest home where we have scissors LOL.The service was good. Make sure you are aware of the wait time before coming. Overall, I like the Curtner Ave location better but this isn't bad either. The Curtner Ave one has better surrounding stores/restaurants so you can hang out while you wait ha ha there's a Halal Guys next to the Curtner one!"}, {"review_id": "9F1YRtos8MtMj34Yz5TGyA", "user_id": "MpvqV7lQcl15rflTBEUhXA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "I was in the mood for seafood and a friend suggested this popular place.

But the legs were enough for me with a side of rice. Even though I got mild it was still pretty spicy... So if you are not a fan of spicy food you might have to pass. Everything comes in clear bags... Ask for a bibs etc... So you don't have a big news to clean up at home.

It use to be so good!I live like 5 minutes away from this BC location and use to go here at least once a month but I haven't been back for over 2.5 years ever since I discovered a new crawfish place on Berryessa. So last Friday we were lazy to drive far and decided to give them another try. We ordered 2 lbs of shrimp + 2 lbs of crawfish + 2 corns shabang medium, Cajun fries, Cajun wings and a side of extra sauce. Crawfish was not in season so I wasn't expecting sweetness or hard shells but the shrimp was over cooked and some were mushy (aka dead shrimp). We were so disappointed. But what was more disappointing was the sauce, it was powdery and not buttery at all. I came for butter not powdery liquids. I hate wasting food but we couldn't (more like didn't) want to finish the food. The chicken wings were slightly burnt but I like my wings a little dark so that was ok. The corn were also frozen corn and the fries were whatever. Again, what happened to this place?!The service was good, the person who took my order was friendly. But the food was so nasty, I rather drive a little further for fresher and tastier seafood."}, {"review_id": "EeREzf_x_Dv1enaykXjgTQ", "user_id": "yJ4mvchZXLAKSa1ReXmtdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/25/2017", "text": "Every time I dare try another cajun place, I always come running back to Boiling Crab. This spot has been my all-time favorite since it opened in 2009 and I still can't get enough of it.I usually get half a pound of shrimp, the Whole Shabang (a combo of all their flavors), medium spicy. Sure, sometimes you can find bigger and plumper shrimp at other cajun spots, but the Whole Shabang sauce is just unbeatable. It's savory, garlicky, and full of flavor and magic. Be sure to ask your server for salt/pepper + lime, I think it pairs really well with the shrimp and sauce! My only complaint is that they do give less sauce than they did before and a couple of times, I've received barely any. You can always order more, but they charge for it. If I'm feeling extra hungry, I'll add corn, which is sweet and buttery, or half a pound of sausages. The cajun fries are also really good - crispy on the outside, soft and steamy on the inside. Also recommend their crawfish when it's in season and not frozen.Service is always friendly and there is ample parking. Weekdays are usually wait-free, but weekends can get really crowded.

The sauce they use for the shrimp, crab and lobster seems on the salty side to me. The selection of side items on the menu can be a bit larger. Have bread for dipping into the sauce for the hungry crowd. Have selection of veggie that go with the meal other than corn.

OUT. and ordered a lb. each of shrimp, crawfish (previously frozen option, the staff member was honest and said there's hardly any difference between frozen and season; thank you for your honesty sir and good luck on the job hunt once your employer reads this review) and Dungeness crab. While everything was delicious, the crawfish really stood out as the best thing I got out of the three, probably because of the medium level spice I requested. Deliciousness wise, Boiling Crab gets 4 Stars    Now as to why the review of this place overall gets 3 Stars from Dave Meltzer of The Wrestling Observer Newsletter and myself. The pricing for all the market price items is BUCK-F*CKIN'-WILD!!! $14 for a lb. of shrimp?? $41.80 for a single Dungeness crab????? Please realize that the term \"Market Price\" doesn't mean you can just gouge your patrons carte blanche, you're not The Fish Market. Thank god I realized my mistake when I'd also placed 2 orders of potatoes, listed at $2.50 per order, each order containing a mere 3 potatoes. When asked how big the potatoes were, the staff member made a O-shape with his index finger and thumb, I assumed they meant the potato was the size of the space between his fingers and not the shape AROUND his fingers. So a potato, the circumference of a roughly 1/2 dollar was valued at almost $1 per red skinned po-tay-to. EXCUSE ME? SIR?!?! Does each potato come named and with its own legend??? Was it plucked from the ground in the rough part of an Irish village only to pick itself up by the bootstraps to become President of the United States of America? Did its life come to some tragic end but somehow its spirit still emits a healing aura?? F*ck you kind sir, but I will spend the 25 minutes it'll take me to boil my own potatoes at home before bathing them in your wonderful sauce. (because yes, while their pricing metrics are busted as fuck, their flavors are not)    Next time I wanna go all out, I'll just get the crawfish and buy fresh non-$44 crab and a big bag of plain, non-haunted, nameless potatoes."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-boiling-crab-san-jose?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
