I was optimistic at first because we got sat in a small corner against the wall. When we asked kindly to move over this is where the night began to blossom. I suggest when you make reservations be very specific on the sitting. It's so cute and tiny, love that. The service was very lovely and welcoming, our server was knowledgeable and accommodating. We stared our meal with a bottle of Brunelleo di Montalcino 2012 and bruschetta. Before we were served out appetizer we had a garlic and oil tasting with their hot fresh bread. Prefect way to get the taste buds aroused. The bruschetta changes daily I can not recall what was on it but oh my goodness it was impeccable. For main course I had pan roasted New Zealand rack of lamb accompanied by onion and anchovy jam, julienned cucumber vinaigrette with arugula and mint. My date had the Pasta Bella their seafood pasta that had fresh clams, PEI mussels, artichokes, asparagus, mushrooms, peas and pancetta cream sauce. I was blown away once again. Last but not least was the dessert a white chocolate and fig bread pudding that was slightly brûlée with a Madeira caramel sauce and had my name written all over it. Superb experience and I was impressed. A must try for date night or anniversary dinner. The historical destination will make your evening!"}, {"review_id": "ht98ifeG5ZrygIMT0yFulw", "user_id": "hFxPBEYeARQsZGk1yg6jag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "I came here thinking I was going to blow a fortune, but I left feeling every dollar was worth the experience. The restaurant is a little more upscale than the everyday dining experience, but I strongly recommend everyone to visit. To begin, the ambiance was just magnificent. The lighting and music was perfect, and our waiter just blew us out of the water. He was well educated on his wines and really knew how to host. Every recommendation he made was absolutely spot on and I would have to say he really made this dining experience phenomenal. As for the entree, I had ordered the Filet Mignon. It was absolutely one of the best steaks I had ever had, if not the best. The meat was so tender and full of flavor, I have seldom been to a restaurant where I haven't had to ask for some extra sauce or seasoning for my steak. I will definitely make another trip when I'm in San Antonio."}, {"review_id": "2ERapRSa85HoXlQlwNWAww", "user_id": "LrwvXGiGPAg7mEAppVW-dQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "I really enjoy the intimidate, relaxing, environment they've created at Bella. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly and got us in for our reservations right away. The seating is very limited so try to make reservations if possible. We ordered the bruschetta and carpaccio with two glasses of wine for appetizers. They don't have hard alcohol so that's the only reason I took off a star. For dinner we had the pasta Bella and the steak Florentine with a Chardonnay and Malbec. For a side we got the shrimp, once again everything was done perfectly. We finished off with a couple more glasses of Malbec wine and had a white chocolate dessert. We will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "gqKPbc-nznKN0xVwb7Fhrw", "user_id": "e6E1cjPK6jzJR2j0RYzizA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Delicious and quaint restaurant with cozy seating, the mussels were amazing and scallops too!

There was no sign so I just kept walking past it. Apparently it's the place with the candy striped Canopy cover over the steps. I called them and had them direct me lol. Was so hungry when I finally arrived. Couldn't believe I had walked past it at least 3 times without noticing. Food was good! Yelp said it was Mediterranean but it tasted more like Italian food to me. Appetizers - eggplant (covered in cheese and hollandaise sauce). I thought this was ok but my dad LOVED it. Then again he loves cheese. The bruschetta (type changes today was cheese and onion) - now this was my favorite. Main course redfish Texas slightly salty but fresh and delicious nontheless. Crispy skin.Paella - seafood over bed of risotto.  I didn't read expected this to be a stew. It was still good but didn't hit the spot for me Bc I was expecting something else. The clams and mussels were fresh. Overall it was good!My only recommendation: I wish they would put a large sign infront so people could find them!"}, {"review_id": "uGXu54r5O-joQ3L30loBCw", "user_id": "bBBxNHv9B3XG8UqISIPiXw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "The sauce in the Game Hen dish tasted like Chef Boyardee sauce. But I kind of liked it anyway. Ha! This quaint little spot in an obvious tourist spot in San Antonio has a ton of charm...like walking into a wine cellar in Italy...but there could be definite improvements. I visited here alone during a work conference and it  as very obvious I was a bother. No explanation of the menu whatsoever, when I asked for suggestions the server said \"everything's pretty good\", and after I was served my meal I literally didn't see my server for 40 minutes. But the ambiance is so quaint, and it seems there is some love in the dishes. I recommend the mushroom side (my favorite thing that evenjng) but not the game hen - it's a peasant dish and was treated as such instead of giving it a real go. They have one rosé and it's very sweet so I'd go for a red. The bread and garlic/rosemary/olive oil display is excellent. There are some highs and lows for sure but honestly I'd still come back for a date night. The ambiance is good enough to make up for the ho-hum service and basic main courses. The white chocolate bread pudding is house made and was a pleasant surprise - it should not be missed!"}, {"review_id": "UnSIqFoVYNytpAQoFWaQwQ", "user_id": "rtKQeKo7DThaNQuokHKPSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "A must see when in San Antonio! Make a reservation! We were lucky enough to walk up and get a spot at the bar. Otherwise the place was PACKED. We had Hannah as a bartender/waitress and she was phenomenal! Very attentive. Made sure wine glasses were full, water was full, dishes were clean, silverware was replaced, bread was on the table, etc. it's been a long time since we have had friendly, personable service like that. We met the owner who was social, interactive and would follow up throughout the meal. He was also hands on and complimentary to his staff - which coming from a business background speaks wonders. The food blew away anywhere else we have had in San Antonio. The steak sauce and seasonal vegetables were mouth watering. The pistachio cake...OMG. You need to visit.

A friend came into town last minute so we didn't have a reservation. They found a way to accommodate us with a smile even though the restaurant is rather small. We felt like we were actually dining in little Italy. It was beautiful. They change out their bruschetta regularly. The particular night we were there, it was a toasted crostini with mozzarella, basil, mandarin and a basalmic reduction. Y'all... Insanely wonderful! When I expressed to my waiter that I was having a hard time deciding between pasta and a filet mignon, he suggested I order the filet with a side of pasta! I was a HAPPY girl. Lol. My steak was cooked to perfection, and my pasta was topped with a flavorful parmesan cream sauce. I ordered creme brûlée for dessert and it was perfection. My guest ordered a chocolate fondant dessert, which was out of this world!

Also, I was trying to get my server's attention because I had questions about the food but it seriously seemed like she was avoiding me.  But damn, the food was delicious!Long story short, the fritto misto made my stressful week better.  Yes, it was all fried, but even the lemon slices were delicious.  (I can't be the only one that ate those) The Bella pasta, with the exception of the actual pasta was perfection.  Everything was fresh, from the seafood to the peas.  The pasta was a little mushy, however, and I debated in even telling the server.  In the end I thought it would be better that she knew.  I rarely send food back/not eat what's on my plate.  To my surprise, the waiter spoke to the manager and he removed it from my bill which was completely unexpected.  That one act alone made me impressed with this restaurant but everything I ate was just absolutely wonderful."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/bella-on-the-river-san-antonio?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
