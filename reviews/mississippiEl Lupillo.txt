It comes with onions and cilantro (and lime wedges on the side), but it's $0.59 per extra ingredient- cheese, lettuce, tomatos. Tacos were good, but honestly not much better than any other mexican restaurant. Not a fan of  corn tortillas, which is all they had. The chicken was decent, but could have been better. Overall its okay, but over priced. If they did like $3.00 or even $4.00 for 2 tacos id be more inclined to give it a higher rating."}, {"review_id": "8OIUNed0iLp0TlT_PG52Wg", "user_id": "qq_iI3qXmyznE36Jn4fSjw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/16/2017", "text": "Real authentic Mexican food that reminds me of my grandma's.  The price is great and the food came quickly.  They were very kind to me and seemed to be so happy that I'd come in even when they were busy.  I found my home for Mexican food.  Highly recommended I had the steak, marinated chicken and chicken tacos.  If you want a suggestion go with the marinated chicken."}, {"review_id": "1j30Nnv5c1xFCBsJf8Wm-Q", "user_id": "499y1XCwz2NkWHCtdusW0g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/22/2017", "text": "Probably the best authentic tacos in the city!

I never heard the term street tacos before, so I went to check it out. I took a friend of mine from California with me, and he's the one that told me that these are called street tacos. Whatever they are they are excellent, and made fresh right in front of your eyes. All the ingredients are fresh, there is a small bar with different sauces and garnishes. The taco shells aren't crunchy, rather kind of semi soft corn tortillas but they are excellent! Only $2.50 for an overloaded, killer taco, Plus a nice selection of imported beers to choose from. The food here is great the people are very nice and I highly recommend trying it out!"}, {"review_id": "wKzAOBbXSEOauThdT1LmKQ", "user_id": "J3ukB-8UZKgnmMm-SLF1jA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/4/2017", "text": "Food is authentic Mexican, but pricey.

Perhaps I went on an off day but my experience was far from five stars. To start I ordered an asada torta with everything but tomatoes and a chicken taco with sour cream. When I got my order it was completely wrong: I received a chicken torta with tomatoes and no mayo and there was no sour cream with my taco. It wouldn't have been that big of a deal except I told the lady at the counter not once but twice and she seemed not to care in the least, which could have also been due to the fact that the music was playing so loud that she may have had trouble hearing me. And even with all of that I still probably would have been okay but I found the chicken to be dry and unseasoned on a torta that was overwhelmed by bread. I'm more disappointed than mad because I really wanted to like El Lupillo but my experience was bad enough from start to finish that I'm afraid this will be my first and only time at El Lupillo."}, {"review_id": "xmcVB2vDBq25EUHuZUK-AA", "user_id": "Aevge9xEMW75KO7DKOLbKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "Authentic, delicious tacos for a reasonable price.
