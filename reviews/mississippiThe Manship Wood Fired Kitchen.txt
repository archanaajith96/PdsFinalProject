We love the food, cocktails and service. I also come alone and have dinner at the bar. I feel welcome and comfortable. My favorite dishes are the duck breast and whatever seafood special is on hand. The chef here is creative and gets interesting seafood options to try. I have had most of the sides and appetizers - the duck wings are meaty and flavorful without being oily. Brussels sprouts are fab. The atmosphere is upbeat but not so loud you have to shout the have a conversation. Service for me has been very good. My friend and I request *Stephen* when we come; he is an experienced, professional server. He offers great suggestions if you aren't sure what you want. He is attentive without hovering. I bristle when staff hover and make me feel like I'm 'camping'. I have not been treated that way here!An aside, though...The decor has been changed a few times since I have been visiting. It has always been clean, fresh and thoughtful. Porcelain shards as 3-D sculpture, Local photography and art. So, I was dismayed to come in and see taxidermy all over the walls. Really? Manship has been a classy, upscale restaurant and this just does not work. It gives an atmosphere of a hunting cabin or rural bar rather than an urban place in the capitol city. We have precious few fine dining places here, so I am dismayed by the current choice of decor. My hope is that it will be changed up again soon.If you have never been here, come try it!"}, {"review_id": "MpBzaLT0Jx-CqtzYq3TmbQ", "user_id": "I_OsrlJ61yN3T9k6Hv5yLw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "When I first entered the door I was half greeted by one of the hostesses. It seemed like I was more of a nuisance since I was interrupting their convo. So after I ask for a table for one one of them escorts me to my table. She cleared off the table and then proceeded to pour a glass of water for me. I thanked her and got no response. I seriously cannot stand poor customer service! By then I was slightly irritated so I wanted to see what my waitress would be like. After being seated Anna introduced herself and let me know that she'd be taking care of me. Anna was VERY nice and cordial. Throughout my meal she checked in with me to make sure my food and was ok. If she would have been anything like the hostess I would've just got up and left! Anna was also kind enough to tell me about the desserts they offered as well as her favorite dessert drinks (I think that what they're called). She was also training another girl and she didn't let that interfere with her service. She definitely got a tip!I ordered the duck wings which were AMAZING! They were good and hot when I received them. For my main course I ordered the Wednesday special which was sliced rib eye over mashed potatoes, peas, asparagus, and sun dried tomatoes (I think). It also had some type of sauce. Although this dish was so damn good, my only complaint was that my food wasn't hot when it came out. It was slightly above room temperature but I still scarfed it down because it was that good! If in the area again its a possibility that I may return. I'm known for not returning to any establishment that has poor customer service. It may not be first on my list to visit but I just MAY give this place another chance.  Oh and they have a nice music selection/playlist!"}, {"review_id": "WnSb8I1jUoypvtQr3MTq6A", "user_id": "43pL-QN8I-rz3sB8Bn1z-g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/31/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Another great meal at The Manship.  This is without a doubt one of the top 3 restaurants in the metropolitan area. Definitely pricey! But the food quality and atmosphere is well worth it. My lady loves this place. As do I. But after dropping $72 on my last  visit and $87 on this one, I won't be making this one of my regulars. But I will return. That's for sure! Tonight our waitress was Ms Anna Marie. This young lady was terrific! Very talkative and very informative about the menu. She was a joy to be around. We started with the choice of three appetizers. Then I went outside my norm and had the duck. It was pretty good. Fatty, but good. My lady had the redfish and we shared some delicious macaroni. She also tried a mix drink called \"the heat index\". Like I said, this place is high end.  I rarely go back to high end places  twice. But it's soo nice and the food is soo good that you simply have to make a return visit. Just remember to bring your credit card!"}, {"review_id": "mPPB7lwunM_S32XoweUl4w", "user_id": "r9Zx6w0G6ww-yyHcEbysEw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "The Manship advertises great food cooked in a wood fires oven, and they deliver on that.The complimentary bread was tasty with a good crust, served with a plate of oil and spices.We had pizza, chicken and pasta; all were exceptional, the chicken was moist and flavorful, it had a slight hint of smoke from the oven, which added more flavor.The pizza crust was also great, which is one of the more important factors of pizza for me.

Next to the kitchen, way in the back.  Not ideal but it wasn't too loud.  My server was quick to approach and after asking her about two or three items I found she recommended any of the pizzas.  I'm sure the other items are great but I am really glad I took her advice.Before I went down \"Wood Fired Way\" I ordered a wedge salad that was fantastic.  I've had middle of the road wedge salads back home in Nawlins so this was quite refreshing. Big chunks of blue cheese, just the right amount of ranch, tomato's were unbelievable crisp and full of flavor... I would go back for the salad alone.The Farmers Market pizza I ordered was incredibly good.  Probably top three wood fired pizzas I've ever had and I eat a lot of pizza.  Loaded with mushrooms, bacon and a fried egg with just the right amount of cheese.  The server provided three small cups of parmesan, sea salt (Soooo good on top) and red flakes.  Great touch that you don't get very often when ordering pizza.  I ate half of it and then realized because I checked in, I would get a free dessert. #Bonus #WinningTodayThe bread pudding topped with ice cream was so f'n good I didn't care that my pants no longer felt comfortable.  If I get a chance to return, I will probably get it again (If they have it that day.).If you are passing through Jackson, you have to try this place.  So many other menu items to get into that I will probably go here at least once more in the next two months with an appetite."}, {"review_id": "MBWo6iMPfRKJinjwnC5rtA", "user_id": "xiSs1muJIk0ZUjuNQxz19Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/23/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "So I am back in Jackson, just driving through. We decided to try this again at dinner instead of breakfast. Let me tell you, when I put the food in my mouth, my taste buds did the happy dance. It was an epic party going on in my mouth. I gave them an extra star because the bathroom was much better. They were out of several items on the menu, but gave us replacements that were slightly more expensive without charging us the more expensive price. Our server, Marcia, was wonderful. She kept my coffee cup full and gave some really good recommendations. Enough so that when she listed dessert options we told her to surprise us. It brought tears to my eyes.

They have daily specials, which I would recommend. I have not had a bad meal here...The atmosphere is high class, but casual attire is welcome. The bar area is extremely busy after work, full of business professionals grabbing a bite and a glass of wine or cocktail. The bartenders and servers are professionals. The wine/beer/whiskey menu is a book. If you are looking for that hard to find bourbon, they probably have it. I was enjoying a Booker's Rye last time I was there. (2016 Bourbon of the year) At $65/glass, it's priced about right and well worth it. they have hundreds of whiskey's to choose from.Not everything is expensive. You can come in and have a $10-$15 pizza and a couple of beers during happy hour and walk out for $30 for two people. You can also go to the other end of the spectrum and order an expensive bottle of wine and an exceptional meal.

The update removes a star because of the service. They really need to do better here.Look, the Manship is an excellent restaurant. They have an excellent menu that is easy to find something you want. The food is amazing, definitely some of the best in town. The service, however, is lacking. Actually, The Manship probably has the worst service in town. The servers simply don't care about you, and they do their best to make it clear that is the case. If you're slightly in their way they'll groan like an inconvenienced child as they walk by. If you're taking more than three seconds to decide on something to eat they will almost universally stare at you like a freak show. If you need to move a table they will complain act like it is a gargantuan task that requires a PhD that they don't have. One waiter in particular will not be deterred from putting his hand on your back no matter how many times you ask him not to.The bartenders are great - they will help you find the cocktail you want and they have a wide selection of liquor to mix up whatever you like. The back out house is great. Food comes out fairly quickly and everyone is friendly. There was even a guy bringing food to the table (not a main waiter) who had a broken leg that didn't slow him down. The waitstaff, however, could not care less about their customers.This is still an important restaurant to visit, just don't expect to be treated well.MAC & CHEESE LIST - This Mac & Cheese is different. It is not your standard comfort food style, so if you are looking for Velveeta (no judgement zone - sometimes we are!) this is not your place. Today it was Pancetta Mac & Cheese (see pic) which was awesome, but it has been a different formulation in the past. Definitely good, but lighter on the cheese than most places. Worth getting for sure though.MUST HAVE DISHES IN JACKSON - The Best Damn G&T. Like the name says, it is the best G&T you'll have, at least until you figure out how to make it yourself. They make it with top notch gin and Jack Rudy tonic. I wouldn't advise the new BDG&T version 2.0, the tonic is gross."}, {"review_id": "HQyhHMdbrxcMgxXLrLzhjw", "user_id": "9oXT99Pa2HhhWdS8yoXOBA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Don't want to spend a lot of energy writing about a review in details. Sorry. The waiter was pretty much useless; wish I could have got his name (Stephen)to put in review. Didn't check on us in a timely manner throughout the evening. Had to actually go find him once and he was sitting down. Gave me some lame lie. Only time he wanted to police us was when we got our food and I guess he wanted to make sure we didn't run out on him. Food totaled like $74. And I hardly ever dress up or shave regularly and I'm black, so I guess I was \"judged.\" No kidding. Dined outside with wife and caught him looking through the tinted glass at us. No lie. Had to ask for the complimentary bread and oil. Crab beignets were justly barley ok. Pork shoulder was was done well, my palate just wasn't used to pork shoulder presented this way. It was pork shoulder sitting in a sweet like sauce and grits, topped with collars greens and I also added an over easy egg on top. (Mini update, this was a very good dish. Ate the leftovers the next day and it was very good.)Wife got a trio carne pizza. She said it was ok, I thought it was pretty good. The au gratin potatoes were really good. They are greasy for those watching calories. All in all the server sucked big time. And I forgot to get my free yelp dessert got dangit because of him because I was in a hurry to leave.
