I did the drive thru, but you can also walk up and order. There is no inside seating or any inside, beside the kitchen. You walk up to the window to order and there are some outdoor seating or do the drive thru. Customer service was good on my visit, very friendly. The service was quick too!I ordered the California burrito and it was delicious. My daughter had the kids bean and cheese burrito and she liked it too.

It's flour or corn and never deviate from the standardization put forth by the passionate people who work here. You can look at Taco Bell from the drive THRU window here. Don't let the employees catch you! They'll Godzilla you out of your Gary Numan Bubble and stuff a batch of Cilantro in your mouth and squeeze a lemon in your eyes. Splendid are the Fish Tacos! Light and clean are they! To be landlocked never tasted so wonderful! Oh, the TORTILLA SOUP is illegal and you'll fight and kill your mother for it. Well, tie her down at the least and leave her a piece of rice and a tear in her eye. Be sure to cut your vehicle to the left as you make the u-turn from the order window and pull up to the FOOD RECEIVING EXPEDITE PORTAL. My chauffeur failed miserably at this task. Call and order ahead, as you will wait a few minutes as they prepare your food. This is not a deal breaker, if you like to stare at a liquor store and a public school. Hey, I only need tacos! Let America eat her own children. If I keep eating here I'll have gills by Friday!"}, {"review_id": "VlFdhdbzZBseZK0B9rSBaw", "user_id": "skfa3uSOg_V1S65IbysL5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/14/2017", "text": "I Love this place..

Was not disappointed! Menu is extensive (not overly) with various tacos, burritos, huapusas (their version of pupusas), and mex-american fusion...think, french fries covered in cheese & green chiles. Everything sounded delicious and it seems vegetarian / vegan friendly. Everything seemed made fresh and from scratch. Order at the drive thru or the walk up window. Three covered picnic tables are outside and that is all there is room for. Small space, tiny parking lot. I went with the fish tacos. They were perfectly fried in an awesome beer batter maybe?, came with some slaw and some delicious sauce, radishes, dressed onions and a fresh, pickled jalapeño. I love spicy salsas so I requested some of their spiciest. A blend of roasted peppers, it was fantastic. Could have even been spicier if you ask me! Price is on point! 3 tacos and salad sides for $6!!!!!!! Awesome!Can't wait to come back and try the mole and al pastor."}, {"review_id": "yQhnNdYvkxdpge-hd80_lg", "user_id": "hb5gdXoTsGoayrSpAI665A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/5/2017", "text": "Yummy. Cheap. Authentic. Absolute best tacos in town! If you're a con quesos fan you can get the same thing here for much cheaper just add a side of quesos and chips ($3) and pour it on your tacos yourself. Tacos are $3 for THREE TACOS. I can't tell you how great of a deal this place is and how yummy the food is. I have tried the burritos and tacos and am never disappointed. I advise you to call in as it goes much faster, but if you order there it's also pretty quick. They have tables in front for those of you who want to sit outside and enjoy the weather. Great first date place!!!!"}, {"review_id": "GYx2xS4k4SFUWTpcpKz53A", "user_id": "v_Opjk06HGooDIBy7rD70Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "All I have to say is thank you lol. I just moved here from San Antonio about a month ago, have tried numerous 'mexican' restaurants and not one can compare to Mangos. This just reminded me of home, I was extremely impressed by the quality of food, from the homemade tortillas, to the meat, service and authenticity.

Very popular spot not far from campus with a convenient drive thru. The steak, grilled chicken, and al pastor soft corn tacos are legit (If I had to order only one, Al Pastor). We actually ate at one of the three wooden benches they have outside which allowed us to reorder another order of 3 tacos each. There's always a $1 taco option in any type of town/city but Mangos excels with its service, options, convenience, and decent location in South Fayetteville. I will definitely revisit next time I'm in the Fayetteville area."}, {"review_id": "jegRbLRgSK2j_dNiWuvh-w", "user_id": "giXQCyMtk3cKgSnE1A45iw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/1/2017", "text": "Great little taco joint, not a dine in just in case you want to sit inside.
