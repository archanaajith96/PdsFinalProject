We have brought countless friends, family, and coworkers with us because there are few restaurants in town with this caliber of service. This is why we decided to use them to cater our party. From the initial discussion at the restaurant with one of the wait staff to placing the final order with the owner AND delivery of the food and heating dishes to our location, it was 5-Star service! The food was, as always, fantastic and everyone at the event commented on how delicious everything was. We ordered steak fajitas, tortillas, green chile chicken enchiladas, beans, rice, guacamole, salsa (to die for), chips, and all of the fixings (pico de gallo, cheese, lettuce, sour cream), and last but not least, SOPAPILLAS WITH HONEY! Incredible! Thank you to Steve and everyone at Hot Tamales for making our 1st Annual Christmas Holiday Party an absolute hit. We recommended you to everyone and even passed out your menus. It was great!"}, {"review_id": "90z1HTYMmc-UYIDEb60c5w", "user_id": "5igORUdQiTPA63s7LMIQdw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "The last time I visited this establishment I wasn't to impressed, being that my food I had order through the phone looked like it was just tossed in the Togo tray. Maybe that's my fault for ordering Togo, but if I'm paying my hard earned money I expect to receive a well presented plate. Be it either through dinning in or taking out, service shouldn't be half-fast. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the chile was good, other than that I wasn't impressed enough to make a return visit."}, {"review_id": "hVVQYBpWP8BucpV4cIZ_5A", "user_id": "yR1HEgxVTbBfv1Yg_BuYRw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/11/2017", "text": "When it comes to Mexican food, my husband is both a connoisseur and the pickiest man alive! He makes amazing homemade Mexican food and has super high standards as a result! I've been healing from massive abdominal surgery in Rio Rancho and he tried Hot Tamales on a whim and a prayer!Boy was he shocked when he fell in love with their food! First he tried a Christmas enchilada plate and said it was like heaven! He also got chips and salsa that night and said it was some of the best he's ever had!Tonight he was thrilled to find his all time favorite on their menu - Navajo Taco! He said it was so good and also got it with chips and queso. The only downside: we actually live over in Nob Hill and this is in Rio Rancho. Once I heal, it's going to be a long drive for his new favorite restaurant!

The flavor profile is traditional yet unique, I cannot really put my finger on it but there is something special about these enchiladas and they could be the best enchiladas that I have ever had anywhere is the SouthWest.The platter is a fairly large size and comes with rice and beans, chips and red salsa as well as Sopapilla with Honey. The Sopapilla seemed fairy bland (neither of us was able to taste any flavor from them) but the honey is wonderful with a lovely subtle flavor of what seemed like Cinnamon. We tasted the Sopapilla plain, once again, and still did not get any flavor from it so either the Sopapilla was not seasoned sufficiently or the Honey has cinnamon-like secret ingredient that makes it so good. The Enchilada itself is excellent, a bit on the spicy side so if you have tourists coming over they might find it slightly challenging, but the wonderful flavor makes it worthwhile.Chips were passable, not hot and somewhat hard to bit through. The salsa was excellent with its own unique flavor profile. I could have eaten several of those small dishes of salsa if I could. Its a bit spicy but I think that everyone should be fine with its heat level.Strawberry lemonade was good, its beautifully presented in a tall sugar crusted glass. It comes with a slice of lemon and a slice of lime so you can adjust the sweetness to your taste.The only real downside was that the rice and beans were ice cold, and fairly bland. Its possible that the lack of flavor was because they were cold but then again they should be served hot. The plate was ice cold so I'm sure that it contributed to the rice and beans not having any warmth.Parking was OK, its small parking lot was nearly full, we were old that it was an unusually busy lunch hour so I expect that parking will typically be better than today. If it does goes full you can always park on the street behind the restaurant or in one of the other parking lots.The staff was excellent, fast, courteous, helpful and professional.This is definitely a must try for lovers of enchiladas."}, {"review_id": "FtaIsMukIxjIvfg1azMdfQ", "user_id": "7VpL3MvQQ1XecJPvedd7SA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "7/7/2017", "text": "Summed up: Not good. We live in Atlanta, and I thought there is NO WAY that any place could have worse Mexican food than Atlanta, but Hot Tamales was all \"wait, hold my beer\". (Note: I realize that New Mexican food is different than Mexican, and I've had plenty of New Mexican food before... This food was just not good). 1. Beef stacked enchiladas: Mushy tortillas on top of a pile of bland, overcooked, dry ground beef with a side of bland pinto beans, meh rice and the tiniest salad garnish you've ever seen. I asked for some red chile sauce... Bitter (and not in a good way), and had obviously sat under a heat lamp, because there was a \"skin\" on top. Got charged 2.00 for a side of guac, when I asked for a side of sliced avocado. 2. Fajita Burrito- Overcooked, chewy steak in a store-bought tortilla with some cheese melted on top. Was charged for a side of sour cream, when most places will give it to you as a condiment.3. Carne Adovada Sopapilla... This was the best out of the items we tried, but still not something to rave about. The Adovada at least had some decent flavor to it. I would not come back here. I don't understand the reviews on here. This food was mediocre at best."}, {"review_id": "fh20Qw2iq5ZtllPVSyLAZw", "user_id": "h0APR6DLR2cXLmJav7MKRg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/18/2017", "text": "Wow. The food was so awesome.

Just the kind you'd want on your tacos. However, the chicken was a bit flavorless and lackluster. Just kinda mushy overall, not terrible... but if they change the way they do the chicken or at least season it a lil the tacos would be more promising.Inside the southwestern vibes and decor make you feel like you're in an episode of Breaking Bad (or at least a spot that shoulda been in an episode). The walls look like they have an epic sunset/sunrise painted on them. It's a nice aesthetic and creates a chill ambience, especially for groups. If you make it here before the noon lunch rush, you can get seated, get decent food and service, and be on your merry way in 40 minutes or so. Just don't forget,  you pay up front. Don't sit around like a chump, waiting for the check ;) I speak from experience."}, {"review_id": "rhmKry9robEFCZk3tUL9mw", "user_id": "Qtpw7IEfLPuimeuxqQOuUw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "The beans were way under cooked.

I've really wanted to try this place for a while, but just have not had the chance to stop by.  The place seems to be very busy and I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long for a table. The staff was very friendly, our server seemed a little rushed. But she sure did get all of our orders out correctly. As soon as we sat down our drink orders were taken. They serve these freshly made chips and salsa. Both very tasty and not too spicy which I enjoyed very much! Started off with the green chili chicken soup. It was a cream based soup, very delicious! I'm glad I started with that. We ordered the carne adovado stuffed sopapillas with beans and rice.  We also ordered the ground beef and bean burrito, that came with beans and rice as well. We got the red chili on the side because I like to control how much gets put on my meals. The red chili was perfect! I loved every bite of our meal. We ended with some sopapillas that were served with honey. So delightful and the whole meal was very enjoyable! I will definitely be coming back to this establishment!"}, {"review_id": "ms45qcZC5LcLpN8z5tNtLw", "user_id": "9D_bijNoa4rPR0Kt-Jethg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/6/2017", "text": "I had the Green Chili Enchaladas and they we very good.

There is not a single thing they do wrong and everything they have perfected. Their service is not only fast, but incredibly friendly, prompt and punctual. The inside is VERY New Mexican feeling, as authentic as it gets just like their food. I got the Stuffed Sopapillas, a New Mexican specialty (and one of the most tasty foods on the planet) which were done absolutely perfectly in every way. Hot, soft but with a bit of crunch smothered with your choice of red or green chile. The missus got a bowl of Posole with a Tamale on top, it's one of their specialty dishes and she was generous enough to offer me a bite. WOW! That's all I have to say. This place will NOT disappoint. If you're looking for some of the best, most authentic and tasty New Mexican cuisine in the Land of Enchantment, I can't recommend this place enough.
