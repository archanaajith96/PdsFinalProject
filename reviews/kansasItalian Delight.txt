We had a pizza roll and their prosciutto balls as an appetizer. Both were delicious. Gary got spaghetti and meatballs which he raved about. My entree was spaghetti with alfredo and chicken which ended up being too heavy and I couldn't eat much of it. Alfredo with their penne would of been a much better choice. I honestly felt awful after I ate it, but I do believe that was just me. We had cannoli for dessert and the cannoli shell was soft, no crunch or texture to it so that lacked entirely.

How has this place been here since 1977 and I'm JUST now discovering it? Thanks Yelp! We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. It was a constant flow of customers. I had the calzone covered in sauce and a prosciutto ball. Amazing! Excellent amount for the price too. I swear I wanted to lick my plate clean...THAT SAUCE! The sausage and peppers my husband got was just as good! I wish I would have saved room for dessert, maybe we'll stop by on our way out of town. We will definitely be back.

The reviews for Italian Delight cast shadows on other options... so we ordered take out and had a lovely bed picnic!FIRST OF ALL... if you go and choose not to order the tiramisu... you're missing out on something beautiful! We also enjoyed the lasagna, the AMAZING pizza and balls... celery and mushroom salad... and garlic bread. The staff was welcoming and friendly, and everyone in the restaurant looked happy. The pizza came overloaded with toppings... something very few restaurants do... every bite was filled with exactly what we wanted! The crust is thin and crispy and full of flavor.
