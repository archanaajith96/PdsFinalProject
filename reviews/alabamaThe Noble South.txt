The Noble South is a very eclectic restaurant as the chef concocts traditional southern with a flare. We had lunch and want to come back for dinner. The food was delicious. The pickled shrimp had a tangy sweet character blended with onion, bay, cilantro (?).  The Brussel sprouts were awesome. The balsamic glaze with walnuts and honey(?) dressing was balanced. Not over powering that complemented the sprouts. The Mac and cheese was traditional, smooth, creamy and velvety. The chicken salad was perfect as the chicken was moist and tender. BLT with kale instead of lettuce provided a nice bitterness to balance out the bacon. Service was pleasant and efficient and extremely knowledgeable and professional. Price was great value for the quality and service."}, {"review_id": "EOrAnxN6gJENnM8i8YMSag", "user_id": "-RFX6k2bJFJZU7IlZoAMIg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/7/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Favorite place in Mobile! Creative twists on southern classics with only the freshest ingredients. The Brussels sprouts and mac 'n cheese are heavenly. The specials are always terrific - spicy chicken sandwich today! Full bar with inventive cocktails in addition to the staples. Terrific, attentive staff. If you get just one meal in Mobile, eat here!!Update: Thoroughly enjoyed Sunday brunch here. Fried oyster Benedict and baked eggs - so good. I could eat entire loaf of the jalapeño cornbread. Fantastic cocktails after 1200. We'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "R3R7Kh7aJEh2g1UJmC_znA", "user_id": "5RLRdjvwUd6qQFHYxG8EBg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/14/2017", "text": "Had an event at their Sidecar Lounge. Had absolutely no issues. They took care of everything. The area was set up and perfect for the intimate lunch and learn. The waitstaff was fantastic at accommodating the needs of the customers and myself. The regular restaurant seemed to be packed as soon as it opened. That's normally a great sign. The pepper jelly over a blue cheese mousse was life changing. I wanted to eat all of it. The toast was fantastic but I need to watch my intake. The drinks were interesting and tasty. I'm difficult and tend to order off the menu. But the bartender took my requests and ran with it.10/10 would recommend."}, {"review_id": "yQ1dNGjQQqcdwsAMd_M2Wg", "user_id": "aXyizI9EJFPRKBz_wgFezw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "This is a fantastic restaurant.

You can tell that it was very well thought out.  The pork was crispy and tender with a nice side of grainy barley.  The tomato puree just made the dish that much better.Anyways, it's rare for me to enjoy a meal so much (especially alone).  I'll admit I spent a little more than $$.  I might've walked out spending $75 dollars after tip (which included $24 dollars worth of alcohol), but it was well worth it.  Besides, I'm allowed to expense some of it. :P   I highly recommend this place and will visit here again."}, {"review_id": "dAyCYtTvQNV2eif6o6HyTw", "user_id": "uzOpx2g4ZGx9tmZinZEI4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Had lunch their yesterday afternoon.  We split the deviled eggs.  I had the chicken salad sandwich with kale salad and a side of brussel sprouts.  The sandwich was huge.  Stuffed with so much between  the two slices of bread.  I could only eat half, the salad and picked at the sprouts that were amazing.  The place was packed for lunch and I can see why.  Service was good and the price was really good.  I would highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "2PAIFE1z0OCMcTVJzsjg5A", "user_id": "2dBbeHiPBzPZa1X2Wk-EZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/18/2017", "text": "The Noble South was a great find for a downtown lunch spot.

To start off, they had Aperol Spritz on the brunch menu. To make it better, they serve alcohol in Mobile at 10am, no waiting until 11am for this Tampa girl. We started with the sausage balls on the snack menu. Get these. Delish with bread and butter pickles and a side of hot sauce. Brad ordered the breakfast bowl. Who knew that creamy grits topped with two eggs, collard greens, pork belly and okra would send my husband into Cloud Nine? I had the fried oysters Benedict. Moan worthy. We will remember this meal for a long time. The decor is also awesome. Very shabby chic farmhouse meets the South vibe.

Farm to table, done the right way. I know its blasphemy to admit in the south but I have never like deviled eggs. I just couldn't get past the pickled eggs flavor. But at The Noble South, it is always my go to appetizer. Pair it with a custom crafted French 75 cocktail and I am in foodie heaven. The menu changes often but if the grouper and braised cabbage is on the list, it will be on my table. The broth, the flavor, the texture. It is the dreamiest combination for a light but filling dinner. If you want to really finish the evening off right, try the buttermilk pie. Topped with homemade whip cream and caramel sauce, it will be your new favorite, guaranteed. The Noble South is beautifully decorated, full flavored, and an amazing dining experience.

One was a work event where the food was catered as opposed to ordered and it was amazing. The staff was extremely attentive and friendly making sure that everyone was taken care of. Most recently, we were there for a birthday dinner. Due to the size of the group, we were placed in the Sidecar Lounge, a small space attached on the side. The downside to this was that there was no entry from the main dining area/kitchen, so the food has to be cooked in the kitchen and then taken outside and back in to the lounge. It came out in waves as opposed to all at once. I think this was due to the time. There was an event Downtown that had drawn a large crowd, so I'm sure their main room was packed as well. I ordered the Squash Blossoms- amazing! They glaze drizzled across the top was a perfect offset to the goat cheese and herb filling. I would definitely go back, but maybe on an evening that wasn't so busy."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-noble-south-mobile-2?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
