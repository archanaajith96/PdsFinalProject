When you enter, the register is to the left. If you are ordering in, order your food at the register and find a table to dine in.I ordered the mixed plate with a medium spice level. The chicken was moist and didn't dry up the meat. The beef was spicy and packed with flavor.  All the pictures of the biryani made me want to try this place. The biryani was amazing and definitely the best part of the meal. It was about $14.00 dining in, not including tip, but it was enough food to last for two meals.Overall, the food is flavorful, delicious, and worth coming back for.  The customer service was very nice and could totally tell that we were new customers.  Finding parking is super difficult and a pain so this is a four star review, but the food is worth driving in circles for parking.  Definitely visit during a down time and if you can find a parking spot."}, {"review_id": "VjXi3hHeHxr4S_3SvhbhdQ", "user_id": "T0bPlEWVE2jjeOnQfbHsnQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "Review#100, hella meals later, 60 something yelp friends later and one for sure block and maybe more later...I am delighted to give my two cents about this spot...Eating here is like eating somewhere deep in the Middle East! Super ethnic experience y'all! I mean when u walk out though its like Mexico which is more of my comfort zone!!! The food though, wow it is good! The chicken Tikka is medium spicy (they can only make it spicier)...very thick and tasty. The combo plate had the juiciest beef kabob I've ever had! I make these at home, but i tend to dry them out... the chicken is nicely marinated. The rice though is very tasty and i could eat it all day...nice saffron scent too. I like the salad which is basic, but for some reason the julienned carrots tasted super yummy. You also get green raita with it. The Samosas were so fresly friend and full of flavor, generous size but it makes sense with the $3.50 price. The Afghan naan was thick and dry, I'm good i rather spend carbs on that rice or something else...The desserts which we took to go were delicious...I had seen Kanafeh on TV and always wanted to try it...I really enjoyed that as I love desserts that incorpirate cheese- you gotta eat it warm!  The lady that helped us was the sweetest and gave recommendations...I was eyeing a Mango Lassi some people had....so going back soon...This place gave my husband smelly burps though! I guess the strong spices that we r not used to do that to him, oh well!!!! Bomb AF, and its all Halaal if you have that dietary requirement !!!! This is an only in America experience! All the cultures represented here, warm my heart!!!"}, {"review_id": "SzRlDwJrrZO87n-w7B8B1g", "user_id": "K7Plz6qug1CJJ4tci5UG0Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "First time here and we had chicken biriyani and chicken samosa.

I had the chicken samosa, veggie samosa and a chicken wrap. (Ok it was more than just a snack). They were all very tasty but the veggie samosa was my favorite. When I first bit into it I wished I ordered more because it was sooooo flavorful and delicious. The samosas came with a red sauce but I didn't get to try it because I inhaled them before I remembered the sauce.  The chicken wrap was very good. I ordered the mild. The spiciness was perfect for me. Had I ordered it spicy I wouldn't have been able to eat it.  Can't wait to come back and try more items from their menu. I want to try the chicken tikka with biryani, chicken biryani, kebabs and palak paneer."}, {"review_id": "Y46GN1td7AS07O8ctCHc-Q", "user_id": "xANDzFdtAr3d8RGFgx5OSA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "A group of seven of us came here for lunch over the weekend.

Overall the food was really good. The Afghan bread tasted fresh, the samosas were tasty, the ground beef patty which I can't remember the name of was probably a favorite of my family's from the meat sampler.The bill was around a $130 for all of us.

It was two in the afternoon no customers so I was greeted very warmly by an older lady very pleasant and friendly. Their prices for what they have on the menu is cheap yet affordable. Place is very small dated definitely needs a facelift. Looking at the menu I order the chicken samosa, chapli kebab with biryani rice and baklavas and they were 2 bucks each not a small size though large pieces. All I can say it was very appetizing with generous portions. Can't wait to go back may go for the chapli kebab sandwich for 8 bucks and chicken wrap.
