The latte art is absolutely fire every time, or maybe \"absolutely leafy\" as that's what it looks like when you post it on Snapchat or Instagram. Always try to snag your beverage \"for here\" to get it in a mug to display the intricate designs by their talented baristas. Iced drinks \"for here\" come in a cool \"Cure\" tall glass. I didn't even know that was an option. I've tried various things off their caffeine menu. The green tea latte tastes like grass if you don't get it sweetened. I order it with soy to get the light sweet 'oomph', but it's best with honey to sweeten it further. I guess it's probably an acquired taste if you order it as is either hot or iced. The chai latte is amazing, but the chai does come out of a box- also wonderful hot or iced. (Pokemon Go days in the summer heat- it's such a refreshing taste.) Still thinking I'm a barista, I like to over-caffeinate (I know that's not a word, lemme live) and order quad shot lattes. Honestly, every signature latte on their menu is amazing, but I tend to alternate between Sugar Cookie and Creme Brulee. It's definitely not as sweet as Starbucks, so that's a huge plus. Always try a specialty drink though. They had a variety of iced teas the last time I was in. The only food I tried was a millenial favorite- the almighty \"avocado toast\" with a roma tomato added for $0.50 more for a total of $6.50. I loved how seasoned the crushed avocado was because I tend to find avocado toast I order at various establishments lacking in... love/flavor. Salt, pepper, & minced garlic goes a long way. It comes with an abundance of avocado spread and a nicely sliced serving of tomato on 4 slices of slightly burnt, multigrain toast. I like my toast on the lighter side, but with the avocado spread on there, it was hardly noticeable. It was surprisingly very filling, so $6.50 wasn't bad at all. My friend ordered an everything bagel with cream cheese, and that bagel was humongous. It looked good to me, and she finished it without complaints. The decoration is super hip, and I find their customer service quite fantastic. They host events sometimes, and it's pretty spacious on the inside. We were lucky to have found a table to seat us and play our games (a 4-seater table with a pew as one of the seats hehe). This place can be used as a study spot, a place to catch up, and a place to play games. Parking is parallel parking, but do read those signs before you make that \"where's my car\" phone call to the City of Norfolk. On a nice day, definitely venture out and take a stroll to waterside or check out their awesome neighbors who specialize in macarons and various baked goods. This is an awesome location, and it's busy for a reason."}, {"review_id": "NCP3zHY_1CBvZX4ba1KWSQ", "user_id": "YBdZq9toJPnTkhqmN7Lu2w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Coffee is the cure to every morning of the week that ends in day... oh, so every day then? Yep, sounds about right.I ordered a matcha latte with added honey to sweeten it up a bit - which was absolutely on point. If you're a bit of a latte art fan, you should be here right now - these guys know how to make your brew look Instagram worthy. Lunchtimes seem to be popular, but the small rush is quickly dissipated by a fast and hard working team. Staff are very friendly, not afraid to get involved with customers, and more than happy to offer suggestions of what tastes amazing on the menu. I ordered the Brie L-T and wasn't disappointed, however, the risotto wasn't my favorite and was served warm instead of hot. No big deal, I was too hungry to ask for it to be reheated!There's plenty of space to sit inside. With the window seats as obvious favorites, don't forget to check out other nooks and crannies this place has to offer. The decor is rustic and aesthetically pleasing - very easy on the eye.I'll definitely be coming come back when in town. I love how this location is tucked away, hidden from the hustle and bustle, though very much still in the heart of downtown."}, {"review_id": "sZyudz7ZglOnhzBuVfEHcg", "user_id": "NzmOuXOOz7U7Mvxj6h3cFQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "This place was absolutely worth it. If you're looking for a coffee shop that does latte art, this is the one. Not only are their lattes pleasing to the eye, but they are delicious. I had the pleasure of trying their sugar cookie latte and their matcha green tea latte. They were both really good and they get served at your table if you choose to sit in. Side note: they are phasing our the soy milk with oat milk. So eventually their only option for non dairy will be oat milk and almond milk. I tried the oat milk in my sugar cookie latte and it tasted like a warm bowl of delicious oatmeal. It was subtle but I could still taste the oatmeal flavor."}, {"review_id": "t4cun__phOTi56z-nZaAUA", "user_id": "Uwh0WWSi83HbFPcnmY9RmA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/5/2017", "text": "I'm disappointed at myself for not having written a review on this place sooner.This place fits the area perfectly, as it has some European coffee shop vibes that match the outdoor cobblestone streets and historic district.It is divided in a few rooms - the main one, a very bright and open area where you mostly place your order (big variety of teas, coffee and yummy food choices); a room adjacent to it, with several tables where you can work, or just enjoy your time hanging out surrounded by walls showcasing local artists; and another room you can rent for work spaces, events and such.I'm all in for chai latte - always. That is my first pick, everywhere that offers it - and this place is no different. That is not to say I haven't tried a few other teas. Regardless, they are all delicious. I even tried their chai latte with bourbon on a few occasions and it never disappoints! Really, go for it!Their seasonal offerings are always a solid choice, since you can expand your drink horizons and always be satisfied by how delicious they are.As for food, it's definitely a nibbles type place (big win in my book), so I've tried a bunch of different goodies. The charcuterie and cheese boards are a must - whichever you order, you'll be in for quite the treat! If I could change anything about them, I'd prob have more bread coming in them from the get-go, but they're happy to bring out some more, if requested.Also, their avocado toast - YUM!! That's all I'll say about it.Even though I don't go to Norfolk as much as I used to - every time I do, I try to put some time aside to come here. It also helps that a good friend of mine lives super close, so I can force her to tag along. Which brings me to parking. This would be the only not so great aspect of Cure. But what can you expect in this area of Norfolk? Still worth it.Altogether, this place has a great chill vibe, also good for some remote work, fitting for this area, and anytime I visit this place, my day is instantly better."}, {"review_id": "6L9NLuUudUhp4O4Na0rkVw", "user_id": "fe2CzKghQM3EFib-y3OyoQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "First time customer and it was a meh experience where i'll have to come back another time and try something else. The Black Currant iced tea i got was good and very refreshing on this warm day. The avocado toast with added tomatoes on the other hand I will most likely never get again. It was very bland and not very pleasing to eat  and after waiting about 25minutes just to get it, the toast was cold. I don't know why it took that long just for toast but I wasn't in a hurry so it didn't bother me to wait, plus the cafe was pretty packed. The staff was very polite and helpful with questions, so even though i'm not a fan yet I will have to come try another food item and maybe one of their coffee's next time."}, {"review_id": "n3eC17JCbKSZOFRUGMyrIg", "user_id": "mdIcAdiNbmZurG0JwipSVQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "Excellent coffee shop in a super cute location.

It has a very relaxing, cozy vibe to it. It's located in the cutest neighborhood in the Freemason district. It is surrounded by beautiful old homes with the streets covered in cobblestone. I've come here quite frequently in the past couple years. It's definitely worth the drive from Virginia Beach to Norfolk. They use Counter Culture coffee in their drinks. Their menu has a good variety of drinks, especially lattes. My favorite drink to order is their Chai tea latte, either iced or hot. Their lattes are my second favorite drinks to order. You can't go wrong with whatever flavor you choose. They also sells tea, lemonades, beer and wine. I recommend trying their Sangria; it is very good! They also serve food and small bites. It's all very fresh and tasty. I love that they also have frequently changing food/drink specials too. I am always bringing friends here to try it and they always love it as well. I've always had a good experience when coming here. It's a great place to hang out, to relax, to study, or to catch up on a good book!"}, {"review_id": "PQAj9qbRg1bAT_FAXh_3TA", "user_id": "IA2E7r3QcTZTtatreR5SZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/19/2017", "text": "Cure Coffeehouse meets all of my coffeeshop demands: great option of coffee drinks, actually tasty and fresh food options, cute and productive ambiance, and local charm. There are a vast selection of specialty coffee drinks, and most run from $3-4 which is a reasonable price. The black coffee is also tasty and runs $2 a cup. Their brunch menu is absolutely incredible and includes everything to homemade jalapeño cheddar and egg biscuits to stuffed french toast and bagels with lox. They have very satisfying and filling options for your morning food cravings! The coffeeshop has a few different rooms that are suited for both camping out and working on your computer (there are a decent of plug outlets against the wall for laptop charging) or causally dining and chatting with friends. The old Norfolk buildings and cobblestone streets outside of the shop make for great window views. Inside it has a lot of unique and quirky decorations and art that make it fun and inviting. Unfortunately it's street parking only but the area is very charismatic and pleasant to walk through anyways.

I was stopping in the area to pick up macarons at hummingbird next door when I realized I arrived before they were open. The ladies working the counter were super friendly and helpful. After looking at the menu I decided on get an Iced Coffee with mocha and peppermint syrup and \"The Morning Cure\" bagel sandwich with a side of potatoes au gratin. The coffee was absolutely delicious. It the first time in my life I didn't need to dump mounds of sugar in my coffee to enjoy it.  The bagel was pretty good as well and filling. My favortie part of breakfast though, were the potatoes. They were so good, I wish they came in a bigger portion. Next time I will order extra. I'm quite smitten with Cure.

Highly recommended to me but some of the locals, I knew I had to at least stop in on my short visit. The space itself is spacious, with large windows lining the storefront for plenty of natural light. There's plentiful seating and outlets, as well as fast wifi. I ordered the avocado toast (#basic) and a crazelnut (caramel and hazelnut) latté. Everything was delicious! The service was quick and friendly, and I didn't feel rushed by the staff to leave once I finished my food and drink. There's street parking available, and the coffeeshop also shares a private lot with some of the other businesses on the block on the corner of Botetourt and York.

I am a wannabee Norfolkian who happens to live in Chesapeake but has been obsessed with all things Norfolk before it was cool ;). On any given weekend I would stop in and grab a coffee, sit on my phone and people watch before heading back out to explore. I have never been disappointed with my coffee, or my food. The atmosphere is always great, its not too loud, if you want to get work done but with the expansion the people who want a quieter vibe tend to sit in the back area. At times the personalities of the employees can be a little cold. They don't need to be my friend, or give out a cheshire cat vibe, but a have a nice day never hurts. On one occasion for a blogger meetup, we all got $10 day passes to meet in the private back room where we got unlimited tea and coffee and our own wifi password. I typically only drink black tea, but the pass gave me an opportunity to try ones I wouldn't normally want to commit to. The sandwich I wanted was unavailable because they were out of Avocado (Sunday brunchers love that stuff) so I was able to make up my own combination. Roasted turkey, bacon, tomato, cucumber, goat cheese, mesculin, and garlic basil aioli on whole wheat bread. It was delicious and something I would definitely get in the future. Now, if only they could make their way to Chesapeake and open up a location there, I would be their #1 fan."}, {"review_id": "-IV28sA899IOCiS5EDHumQ", "user_id": "UBQfKxAWEXzMWzej3y2BGQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/17/2017", "text": "Not bad, folks.

I'm not one to need or want excess customer service, but it's ok to make eye contact or say hello. But...hipster baristas! Am I right?The mint mocha was pretty dope. Mint and coffee can only go one of two ways: right or HORRIBLY HORRIBLY HORRIBLY HORRIBLY wrong. Thank the good Lord that this tasted like the former instead of tasting like someone spit their Colgate into my coffee! Anyway, I'll be back.

They barely cracked a smile and was just \"ehhh.\" Nothing to make me feel good about esp for my first visit. [Maybe I'm just too spoiled by the cool & friendly baristas with smiling faces at that other well-known coffeehouse with the green straws.]- Awesome that they have 2 gender-neutral bathrooms for their patrons HOWEVER -- the one I chose to use had a freshly used and un-flushed toilet. I assumed a man used it because there was no toilet paper in there and it had a lot of bubbles. That was just gross.

I got the jalapeño cheddar biscuit with bacon and side of potatoes. It came with BBQ sauce, and that was the true star of the show. Altogether with a black coffee, it was $11.

I personally got the churro latte. The only thing I wished I could've changed was the latte having more of a cinnamon flavor and it being a little bit more sweet. I also got one of the apple cakes and it was amazing. It was very sweet and had a crumbly top, which paired perfectly with the latte.

He asked me to visit again for a coffee on him, but it took me a while before I had an opportunity to follow up. I managed to stop by one evening with my husband for drinks and snacks, but even after that visit we left feeling disappointed. I remember a dripping ceiling above us, slow service, and a few other issues that made me want to wait on an updated review for fear that I would have to write 2 terrible reviews about this place. Well, flash forward 5 years, and I am not kidding when I say Cure has become my favorite coffee shop in Norfolk. And my saying this is kind of a big deal for several reasons: first, it's not even in my neighborhood so I have to drive to get there; and second, Norfolk has several very established coffee shops with very loyal followings that are hard to quit.So in the last few months, I have managed to have a few friends suggest meeting at Cure. And while I was skeptical at first, I was quickly glad to have been there over another place.The pros: - Lively but not too crowded to find a comfortable spot (even with a small group)- great atmosphere and friendly, quick service- a variety of drink choices and tons of loose leaf teas!- a separate day-pass room for people who need a place to work (awesome concept!)- local beers on tap- a good menuI've only been back a few times this year, and each time I've had a hot tea and an Avocado Toast. Both are good, but I'm looking forward to going back in the evening for a beer and to try the cheese/charcuterie.
