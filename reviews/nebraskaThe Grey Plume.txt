With that being said the Grey Plume is a heavenly green inspired restaurant. The restaurant is simply beautiful and the food is what you would expect. Everything from beef to the fish to the vegetarian options all is fresh farm to table. The menu changes seasonally. A few items are always on the menu like DUCK FAT FRIES!! Haha but also the burger which is lovely! The charcuterie board is a nice way to start as well. Excellent drinks to accompany your food . Great wine list. The Grey Plume is perfect place for dinner with a loved one/ date night. But really it's good for anytime you want an excellent meal!"}, {"review_id": "RXCziUaEWD7YNrUxLMIHNg", "user_id": "riqVnqzfWKfE37DV0LJ-gA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I arrived for dinner service on a Tuesday at 6pm to a very dead restaurant, however by the time I left at 7:30, there were a few more tables occupied. This restaurant is very cute and the food is amazing, so I hope the folks of NE appreciate the gem that they have in Grey Plume. I know everyone raves about the duck fat fries, but for a party of 1, they would have been too much for me, so instead, I chose the honey creek creamery gnudi and it was incredible! This is a MUST order. I have never had anything quite like it before. In addition to the gnudi, I had the Beaufort mahi mahi and it too incredible!I almost left without trying dessert and after trying the duck fat donut, I wish I had left before consuming the extra calories. The donut was dry and the ice cream was melted. I felt like I was dipping my dry donut into milk. For such an incredible meal, this was the worst dessert I have ever head at an establishment of this magnitude. Besides the disappointing dessert, I would definitely come back for more amazing food."}, {"review_id": "MSaCbwE93rEC9qFvfOROgA", "user_id": "l63QwNwi7175v69eGIqH_A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Vibe: classy & elegant.

Service: needs work. Walked in & was greeted after 2 minutes! That's absurd! Our server was not good. Quit pressuring people into ordering stuff they don't want to. If I decline desert the first time, quit trying to convince me again and again. You're a server not a salesman. Warning: severs will pressure you into ordering more food bc this restaurant automatically adds gratuity.

It was on the restaurant's anniversary, no less. We all had such a wonderful time and such great food. Some people on the East Coast where I am from are dismissive of the Midwest. Fools. When I said to a coworker and friend--someone I otherwise respect very highly--that I was going on a culinary tour of Omaha, he said \"Are you going on a tour of Dairy Queens?\" Omaha deserves it place on the map. The Grey Plume deserves its place on the map. I own the cookbook \"New Prairie Kitchen\" which showcases some of the best restaurants in the central Midwest. The Grey Plume is featured in the book and is one of the reasons I went there--in addition to the friendly employees I met at the Farmer's Market in Omaha's Old Market.I wish I could eat here all the time."}, {"review_id": "kGGyaoL8ekAsf5p6gp8vOQ", "user_id": "k-V4-HUfoImCSL3D1urNsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "I've been wanting to go to the Grey Plume for years, and it was certainly worth the wait!

With my sister and brother-in-law in town, we decided it was the perfect occasion to finally try it. Booked a reservation a week out for 8pm on a Friday. When we arrived the hostess let us know our table wasn't quite ready and offered us drink menus and seats at the bar.  After about 10 minutes, the hostess let us know our table was ready and kindly carried our drinks over for us. Our server was extremely nice and polite. He told us about Omaha Restaurant Week going on as well as the four and five course tasting menu's.  My sister asked if the chef is able to adapt the tasting menu for a dairy-free pescatarian, he said he was fairly certain but would check.  Upon confirmation, we all opted for the five course tasting with wine pairings for three. Amuse Bouche came out promptly which was a play on watercress watermelon salad with basil oil and feta. Quite a good start!1st Course - My sister got an arugula salad with pea and strawberry purees. The rest of us were treated to an outstanding deconstructed corn chowder. It was the perfect balance of creamy and hot (from chili pepper). But wait...where's our wine pairings? We asked and server realized he had forgotten it and apologized.  It was a wonderful sparkling wine and FULL glasses! We were all surprised considering wine pairings typically are lighter pours.2nd Course - We all were given a rigatoni in a porcini red sauce. Another delicious dish. But wait a second...still no wine. We asked again and the server brought it over...another large pour.3rd Course - The three meat eaters in the group got chicken over shallot, fennel and grape. My sister was given the same dish but flowers in place of chicken...OK? No protein this course for her I suppose.  This dish wasn't anything spectacular...just made us all say \"meh.\" This time we didn't have to ask for the wine, but it still didn't come until after we had our plates. 4th Course - Three of us were given some sort of steak (don't know the cut as the server explained everything but the type of meat) over carrot, raspberry and mushrooms.  My poor pescatarian sister was again the same dish, but with flowers in place of the meat. Really? Couldn't give her any type of protein? Of all the dishes this was my least favorite. I didn't care for the flavors of the raspberries and mushrooms together, nor did I enjoy that one of the slices of steak was pure fat. While my non-fatty pieces were cooked perfectly medium-rare, another person at my table got over-cooked steak. At this point, we again had to ask for our wine pairings...5th Course - A play on pecan pie for all four of us. This was just fine. Not horrible, just not memorable in any way. BUT--we did get our wine without asking, albeit after our plates were delivered.After everything, the bill was $650 (including 20% automatic gratuity). The general consensus was that everything was just OK. Unfortunately, the service was sub-par for this type of restaurant (which kills me because our server was very nice). Wine pairings should always be brought prior to the plates, which they have to know because rumor has it they have a few employees that are Sommeliers or studying to be. Waters were quite often empty on the table. Food was hit and miss...and mostly a miss for my sister. Still quite shocked that a chef, known for his creativity, thinks adapting plates for a pescatarian is simply putting flowers in place of the protein.  While I did enjoy a couple plates, I don't think that I will be back. For this price point, I think everything should have been spectacular and the Grey Plume just didn't deliver."}, {"review_id": "UKTkirtB6J4WxjWkw82w6A", "user_id": "qAffLpiQCJF7q5IogUwz8Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Possibly the best restaurant in Omaha.

I don't remember all that much about what I ate here. I was on a cross country road trip, stopped in Omaha, and trusty Yelp brought up The Grey Plume. I think I was slightly delirious, but.... those duck fat fries. I still fantasize about them. They may have been the best fries I've ever had. EVER. Which is saying a lot because I'm a thin and crispy fry girl, and these were massive plump fries. I don't know if it was the duck fat, or the big 'ol egg that topped them, but man. They were glorious. I do recall they made a special non-alcoholic sparkling drink for me that was fruity, herbal, and fantastic (not too sweet, either). My husband had the steak and enjoyed it, though wasn't as effusive in praise as I was (I think that was more because this isn't really his style of dining, though).I loved the baby breakfast cookies they sent us home with. It's a small, but memorable touch.Our server was excellent, always available, but not in the way. We were seated at a rather petite two person table, and I would have preferred something a bit larger, but it is a small space, so I can be understanding about that.For the price, this place just can't be beat. It is stunning, upscale, intimate, and most importantly, has ridiculously delicious food. I've dined at much less impressive restaurants while paying much more. I don't know when or if I'll ever return to Omaha (side note: Omaha is darn cool -  I never knew!), but you can be sure if I do this will be my first stop, and I'll be inhaling two or three orders of those fries."}, {"review_id": "LltZ_PJe9DvoKGb5KQP8Wg", "user_id": "iuPDELpk04z9XYs0sffrLQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/15/2017", "text": "I heard about Grey Plume from a few colleagues and was excited to check it out on a recent trip to Omaha.FoodI was underwhelmed by the food. The dishes were unnecessarily rich and heavy. They could do more with less, especially as a farm to table restaurant. I felt like each dish had too much going and way too many elements. We ordered the chicken roulade, squash blossoms, and carrot soup.  Carrot soup was rich on its own, then they opted to serve it over buttermilk cheese, which made it so heavy. Squash blossoms were fine, but nothing spectacular. They provided an amuse bouche, which was decent. But they over did it again by adding a gelee of some sort under the spoon.  I was however pleasantly surprised when they gave us 2 baked cookies as a parting gift on our way out.ServiceWaitstaff were friendly and attentive. They explained the menu and each dish as it arrived.AmbianceNice decor, definitely a good place for a fancy date night or business dinner. It's a small restaurant, so I would recommend reservations. PricesPrices are steep. It was $26 for the squash blossom entree which is crazy high. Especially considering the portion size and the ragout (which was just a bit of purée, onions and pickled cabbage). On top of that, they add an automatic 20% for gratuity and encourage you to add more for front of house staff. I won't be back and wouldn't recommend this place unless it's for a business dinner."}, {"review_id": "cs8oIXutZufDR2Kv-kVYZg", "user_id": "Bg9MlIFzfopgK5-CYkzD-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/20/2016", "text": "My favorite restaurant for so many reasons: incredible atmosphere, service, and of course, food. It just never disappoints. I tried a new cocktail called the lily, which I found out was named after Lili Buffet (Warren Buffet's grandson's wife). All I can say is that Lili has good taste! Not too sweet but a nice drinkable cocktail.  You taste the spiced gin first, then the lavender just cascades into the honey. I was feeling decadent so of course I ordered the duck fat fries. Delish. And you simply must add the short rib to them. Literally melts on your tongue. Gloriously salty and meaty. Unbelievably tender. The amuse bouche was one of the best bites of food I've ever had. Cranberry caviar...I can't believe there's a place in Omaha doing molecular gastronomy!! The Wagyu beef collar steak was perfectly cooked to a medium rare and well seasoned. I adored the truffle powder and different emulsions on the plate. As intriguing to my taste buds as it was to my eyes. Gorgeous plating. Then came dessert. The duck fat fried donut was actually layered like a biscuit. It was soft and nearly doughy on the inside and had a satisfying crunch on the outside. The duck fat gave it this slight umami and salt flavor that took it to the next level. Then it was served on shortbread crumbles and brown butter ice cream. My only complaint is that the ice cream melted very quickly and had a slightly goopy texture that was hard to scoop up! Ok, I've gushed about the food enough. The service matched the food in its impressiveness. Our server was so knowledgeable on the menu and food in general. I really appreciated having that knowledge and insight to help me enjoy my dining experience. He was extremely accommodating and prompt. The ambience is reminiscent of something I would expect us to see in a much larger city. Very unique art on the walls, lots of different textures and textiles throughout Oh the restaurant, for example velvet cushions on the benches and several dining dishes that had grooves or different shapes.In short, the Grey Plume is everything I love in a meal."}, {"review_id": "DRrprcCijNdDFJs2wBrYiQ", "user_id": "uLFRlTpwZHkICG1f1XKZOw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Spectacular meal, service, ambiance--our second here in the last few years.

We hope that the owner will be smart enough to expand into the space of the large Brix spot so they can expand their comfort. I loved the art on the walls. It had me mesmerized before the food got to our tables and the wine was fantastic as it hit the spot while conversing about old times with my lovely wife on our anniversary weekend.

Mertz and subsequently Spencer's for a bit. He was the first chef in memory at V. Mertz that implemented the amuse bouche detail.The ambiance is nice; minimalistic and modern with soft colors. The tables were spaced nicely apart and we had plenty of room.  My only issues with the experience come primarily from service which I felt was lacking for his caliber of restaurant. I think it took about 10 minutes after we were seated for our server to arrive and greet us.  Our server was pleasant but not the most polished and I found it to be a little slow in parts- like waiting for drinks or wine. The pacing of the food was fine. We noticed he was waiting on our group of 5, a 6 top and another group of what looked like 10 people. As for the food, the trout was really good, it was a little salty and slightly boney which even though the bones were removed I still found quite a few in my mouth. Everyone else was pretty pleased with their dishes; my friend commented the chicken was slightly dry. It was a good experience overall and I'm glad we were able to have a nice holiday meal with our friends. I would return for another menu sampling at some point; it's cool to have a nice restaurant like this in Omaha."}, {"review_id": "LoBtm0DrT67cvbBFoG5bZg", "user_id": "g4Qajg_OtQr-dWw7yoVf4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/5/2017", "text": "This is by far my favorite restaurant in Omaha and the best in Nebraska. It is great for a romantic dinner with your loved one or any special occasion. Their cuisine is innovative, modern, and aperitive.For first plates, the charcuterie board may be a good choice for most, however the duck fat fries are heavenly.Their dinner menu does rotate throughout the seasons, and it is vegan and vegetarian friendly. The 3 times I have visited, I always selected the beef plate on the menu and each was cooked to perfection. Depending on the season, there is also a fish, chicken, and pork option, among others. Lastly, there is a large selection of wines, but do not decline their dessert menu.  The duck fat donut with ice cream is the best way to end the experience of The Grey Plume."}, {"review_id": "yEev7-KSyhfTaXHp9LZNZQ", "user_id": "ThoelHZRIwqWOF8omYMvBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "Highly recommend the tasting menu[s]!
