I love the pizza here and the employees are super cool, easy going and attentive. They can get busy with a line out the door but they're good at tending to it and minimizing it quickly. I got the pepperoni slice and sausage slice. Both really amazing with yummy sauce and thick buttery crust. The only downside is some folks treat the space like a bar versus a pizza joint and that can be annoying but it's not GBP fault. Overall I love the pizza and can't believe I'm just now eating here - Give this place a try!"}, {"review_id": "Yhj5W0U3H2HAr1cE5va0Mg", "user_id": "CQrXMz-u0E9K0dJsqxd1kQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "I was recommended to try Golden Boy Pizza by many people, and it did not disappoint. They have the normal pizza toppings- a combo pizza, veggie pizza, plain cheese, pepperoni, but they also have a garlic clam pizza. We ended up trying the combo and veggie which were both super delicious. The veggie pizza has pesto, so I would highly recommend! The pizza slice itself was huge and very filling. The edges were super crispy while the middle was nice a fluffy. Would definitely recommend getting a slice to go to eat at the park nearby!(they also offer beers on tap)"}, {"review_id": "bttOjO6HTO9J7Jh7NkMskw", "user_id": "pcQmJrJi3Sm0V-yThZLc5Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "This place is a real hoot.

Loved the focaccia-like crust and the hearty toppings.The garlic clam was by far my favorite. The combo came in a close second. One slice is definitely enough, but I had to get 4 to try all the toppings!What I didn't love, however, was the extremely long wait. There was only one person serving customers and they even put the fresh pies into their mini oven, which took forever :("}, {"review_id": "j0pW0Mxu904ZrHXHHxlkpw", "user_id": "EebIIcoDdqH6WF2COxFipg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "My homeboy recommended this place so we decided to check this place out. Here was our experience on a Thursday evening.AmbianceParking: Mainly street parking....you're in San Francisco so good luck.Seating: Seating is mainly inside from bar seating and table seating. Pretty small space for about 20 people.Feels: It's in a lowkey popping area. Not very touristy spot but a place locals knows. The space itself is small and intimate. Pretty much a run down hole in the wall like a bar with rock music in the background. It could be family friendly but mainly great place for a grab and go.Food:Garlic Clam Pizza (Recommend)Much yes. I got a good slice - fresh, cheesy, and delicious. The garlic wasn't too intense but just right, it fused well with the clams.Customer Service:Cool - friendly and vibrant peopleOverall:4 Stars. The price was reasonable, service was good, and food was delicious. If you're lucky, you'll find parking but don't bank on it. Good place to hangout or grab a bite to go. Regardless one must takeaway is their pizza.TL;DR Tips:* Must go for a late night snack or a simple SF foodie adventure* Don't be heart broken if they sell out."}, {"review_id": "qM-h8XRCaB9rJiMnJLLalA", "user_id": "VELiO-JvMqctmh_OBQuCbw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "This place never disappoints! The only downside is cash only but there's a BOFA less than a block on Columbus!

Line was fairly long even at an odd time (2pm, post lunch rush) so that was a good sign. The male cashier was totally hauling ass though while being super friendly, shout out to himYou wait in line, order your pizzas, and if you dine in there's a limited amount of seating inside. It's like a hallway. If you do to-go, you wait outside the window and get your slice handed to you once it's done heating up. Overall it's a simple place, and doesn't break the bankI opted for their highly rated clam & garlic pizza, and while it was good objectively, it wasn't really for me. It was more a suuuuper garlicky pizza with a liiiiittle bit of clam. If you like that, then maybe that's for you. My boyfriend also thought his combo was just okay. We definitely would just stick to pepperoni next time, still a pretty good deal at ~$4 a slice"}, {"review_id": "JnNdDee1ZGwV3PXu5e5iXQ", "user_id": "NMDayrA20FC7OZXPUbNZZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "My boyfriend recently moved to North Beach and we always like to visit Golden Boy Pizza whenever we're looking for a quick bite.

After having a ton of chewy crust pizzas in the past several weeks, it was time for some crunchy crust pizza.I had a chance to check out their pepperoni, clam garlic, veggie pesto, and combo \"za\"s. If you ever meet me, ask me about how I once lost in a Scrabble game to someone who used \"za\" on a triple word and triple letter score, and I will probably still be bitter about it. Anyway, I digress....They heated the pizza back up before we ate it and it was super melty, with strings of cheese every which way. The clam garlic stood out the most to me-- I could smell the clam on it when opening my mouth to take a bite 3.75/5. The parsley flakes covering it were a nice touch, and the ingredients were stacked thickly. The veggie pesto had a light pesto taste (this is always a complaint though, I like to layer on that stuff) and the cheese was also piled on. Combo and pepperoni were the two that were just standard ok-- good, but I didn't find anything to love about it. The crust was crunchy underneath, but definitely more like a focaccia, as others have said.Versus Goat Hill (another crunchy crust spot), this place was more down to earth / not bougie, but I liked the cheese over at Goat Hill more. The walls were lined with stickers past. 3.5/5 for me."}, {"review_id": "xiosIE3Pfk_KJYA63qjo1A", "user_id": "rTf8TKad7GeZvuBIz6zE7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "What do I say about this place that hasn't already been said?

Then Golden Boy Pizza is the place for you. They been serving their signature square slices on Green Street in San Francisco's North Beach for forty years! I finally got the chance to experience this well-known landmark on a late Wednesday evening after a group movie outing at the Metreon and although the food didn't disappoint, the service and the fact that they still, after all these years, only take cash made my first time less enjoyable. I came with a trio of friends after walking around the North Beach neighborhood to see what we wanted to try out. Despite it being late on a Tuesday evening there were many options to choose from, but we were surprised that the only fast casual option in the area was in fact Golden Boy Pizza. It's in and out at Golden Boy as the lines stretch out to the front of the store mainly because the order counter and cash register is right in front right next to the front door. Talk about bad feng shui or good business as it seems they are always busy, which technically they are not, as you can get through their line in speedy order.This time around my friend was smart and decided she wanted to try one of each they had displayed. So it was Cheese ($3.25), Pepperoni ($3.75),  Sausage ($3.75), Combo ($4.25), Pesto Veggie ($4.25), and Clam & Garlic ($4.25). All told the total bill was 24 dollars for six square box, which in hindsight is not a bad deal considering the size of the squares. Unfortunately our fun only-in San Francisco experience was ruined by the fact that our server was really brusque in attitude and made our make a decision on what we were going to order much faster than we would have liked. But nonetheless we ordered away and the slices in the window are already pre-cooked, once you make your decision, they heat it up in their re-heating contraption right next to the front counter area. Although my friend wanted to bring most to her slices home to her famished family, she nice enough to be willing to share in one of her slices so I could get a sample of what to order in the future. We split the Pesto Veggie slice, and although it was warm to the touch, it was also rather a greasy piece of pie. A full five napkin adventure for even half a slice.Golden Boy Pizza has been serving focaccia style pizza since 1978 so to be in business at the same location for forty years, they deserve our respect and praise for sticking it out after all these years in a competitive environment. The pizza could be a smidge better, but it you're looking for an affordable option in what is normally a highly trafficked tourist location, they you could do much worse. I still plan on returning one evening in the future especially when I have those hunger pains late at night."}, {"review_id": "t7ewdRZ6bEZR5qPJzxLHmQ", "user_id": "VUhZCfChpTSiO8TkmSn18g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "I usually don't like thicker pizzas, but this place is a must try!
