My family and I, a party of six including my toddler, ate here trying to find quality food in the Balboa Park area. Our expectations were exceeded. First off, they let my toddler build her own pizza before cooking it! She loved it! Then it was delicious. I had the squid ink radiatorre which absolutely superb. I was craving a seafood pasta after an unpleasant experience at a seafood restaurant and this redeemed my faith in seafood pasta. Pizzas were excellent and the \"aquaazul\" non-alcoholic cocktail was a very refreshing beverage to enjoy. Cannot recommend this restaurant and experience enough!"}, {"review_id": "mfIhNPmDgSUE_mE2bB8Blw", "user_id": "D0ZuMeONOapIj2o8JQnEQg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "It's pretty easy to see why Cucina Urbana has the ratings it does.  The restaurant seems really unassuming since it's at the bottom of a small business complex in an area that has some restaurants and such in the area but not really a super trendy area.  Well, maybe it is.  I live in Los Angeles and don't know the area super well, but this is the first time I've been in this area after many trips to San Diego simply to go eat!When entering the restaurant it's big, is artistically decorated, and when we came for lunch, wasn't crazy busy.  We were able to be seated right away and didn't have to yell over music or other people talking in order to have a good conversation.  Our server was also really helpful and did a great job waiting our table.The food was awesome!  I came with some of my siblings who were in town for Christmas and my sister and I decided to half both of our meals and share them with each other.  I got a panini and she got a pasta dish.  Both were super flavorful though I think I liked my panini just a tad bit more than her dish.  I did also try half a slice of pizza that one of my other sister's had and it had a crispy crust, a great sauce and a nice amount of cheese.  Excellent.I would totally dine here again!"}, {"review_id": "q4hUujlJThhrthYcUFbYKg", "user_id": "TPrVoykhOfsEOk9Iup6BHw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Food: 9.5/10Service: 9/10Ambiance: 8/10Overall: 9/10Never have I enjoyed pulling myself out of an afternoon nap for a meal. Nevermind having to force my sloth of a gf up and having to travel 20 minutes just for one meal when I'm surrounded by so many local rates. But was it ever worth it. We got the burrata, tranegloni, bugattini, and brussel sprouts. Burrata was delicious and well balanced. Vinaigrette really shined, really enveloping and connecting all flavors. Wish there was more bread though. Tranegloni was bright and light. No hint of gaminess. Nicely seasoned and balanced. Bursts of flavor from something pickled in the sauce. Delicious!Bugattini was probably one of the better pastas I've had in my life. In every bite you taste the freshness of the tomatoes, balanced with the richness of the meat. The bugattini serves its purpose well, soaking in all the sauce. The egg was perfectly cooked but found lacking in purpose or flavor.Brussels were ok. Nicely blackened but piled up so the bottom few were soggy. Hot sauce was delicious but doesn't compliment the Brussels at all."}, {"review_id": "Ls4HfwhMXrts2UWmj5_uJg", "user_id": "opPpHVIp8SKHMJg3_y5Lew", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/12/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "A lot different experience this time around.

We were a party of 15 and we were seated in the wine room with thousands of bottles of wine surrounding us. The atmosphere is very romantic and trendy. For appetizers, we had carpaccio (so buttery and smooth and the mushrooms were amazing), potato gnocchi (fantastic with sautéed sausage and leeks), and chopped salad (five stars with tons of ingredients, not just lettuce). The waiter paired them with a red wine ( don't know the name). For dinner, I ordered bacon, ricotta, and arugula pizza, which was also paired with a red wine. It was a large pizza that should have been shared with someone else. A colleague ordered the squid which was a massive bowl of delicious tentacles in a broth with greens. The best I have ever had and I eat lots of seafood. For dessert, tiramisu and Italian donuts (don't know the name).  The tiramisu was creamy with chocolate bits on top. The lady fingers were soaked in some super strong espresso. The Italian donuts were warm and crunchy and filled with a light chocolate cream. Service was top notch. There were multiple servers clearing plates and refilling water glasses, even though there were several carafes of water on the table. I highly recommend this place for a large group, just make sure you make reservations."}, {"review_id": "SRQDMIjtMhL0fXI6f0e8KA", "user_id": "2wExGlZsaQK5MopkymYpFQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "I'm usually not a fan of Italian cuisine, but I decided to come and take a chance with some friends since they've never been here either.Of course, none of the entrees looked super appealing to me so my sister and I decided we wanted to do tapas style dinner and ordered 2 appetizers and three sides. We ended up ordering the grilled octopus, polenta board, truffle fries, roasted brussel sprouts and cauliflower.We asked that the fries came first so the whole table could share. The truffle flavor was absolutely there and it was throughout each piece of fry which was nice. I think they served the fries with marinara sauce rather than regular ketchup which is a nice touch but I didn't need the sauce at all since the fries were seasoned well.The grilled octopus had a good, rich char from the grill. It was unfortunately drowning in sauce so the texture was missing. It came with a few mini meatballs that I thought was underwhelming in flavor.The polenta board was nice and the plating was very rustic. The polenta was creamy and rich but the ragu was oversalted so I we ended up not finishing the dish.The roasted brussel sprouts were also a bit too salty but the texture was divine. The outside was crunchy and a little burnt which is how i love them. The cauliflower was great! It had a nice hint of lemon juice and had pine nuts which was a great addition for texture.Overall, still not a fan of italian food and I thought the food should have been seasoned properly for the price we paid for appetizers and sides...I can only imagine what my entree would have been like."}, {"review_id": "RGEj5BBR3DofJbs5ILIOcg", "user_id": "LG-FOXQL0zUcRQuqkhq-Zg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This place is happening... lots of beautiful people and great music.

I'd highly recommend to make reservations as this is a popular place to eat. The restaurant itself is very cute and loved the overall ambience. TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES: Shared this with 3 others. It's a sneaky large portion, so keep that in mind so you don't stuff yourself before your actual meal. This was perfect to share amongst 4 people. Comes with marinara instead of ketchup-unique touch! Enjoyed this a lot and would get this again!COMPLIMENTARY BREAD: Free bread upon request-Be sure to ask for bread. It's good and we even added a bit of our marinara from our fries on the bread!Menu changes pretty often:-SHORT RIB PAPPARDELLE: Overall it was good. Comes in a sneaky large portion and can be very filling. The short rib flavor tastes how I expected it!-RIGATONI: It came in a baked tray and also proved to be more filling than meets the eye. It was good, but I preferred it to be a plated dish and not be baked in a tray. Still good though. BURNT BRUSSEL SPROUTS: This was my favorite haha. It is on the crispy side for sure and the hot sauce that it comes with has such a great kick. The sauce makes this for sure and would hands down get this again with my meal next time.Can't wait to try other menu items (:"}, {"review_id": "BzHbYkYM7lMRuOkvPpkMLw", "user_id": "h8pthOnqCxV94D8-JkZXCQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "I sometimes feel like restaurants with thousands of reviews at a 4-5 star rating sets really high expectations for me.  That was the case for Cucina Urbana.  Let's start off with some of the positives:- The service was lovely.  We were able to make a last minute reservation on a Friday night.  They were fully booked, but they still managed to squeeze us in with the stipulation that we would be out by 9pm.  Our reservations were at 7:30pm - no problem.- Lovely ambience.  The dim lighting, the decor.  It was a lovely space to catch up with family and friends (not too noisy), for a romantic date night dinner, or for business. - Great wine selection.  I would definitely come back just for the wine.Now for the \"needs work\":- Sadly, I was not really impressed by some of the food we ordered.  I heard raving reviews about the Brussels Sprouts, but what we got was a bit dry and bland.  It was almost crunchy..?We also ordered the Squash Blossoms, which I really enjoyed.  The lemon with the mint was very refreshing.I had the Pappardelle with short rib, cremini mushroom, carrot and parmesan.  It sounds great on paper, but my dish was so heavily salted with very little flavor.  The pappardelle was nicely al dente, and the short ribs were very tender, but I wished the flavors overall were more cohesive.  The boyfriend ordered a light seafood pasta dish that was much more balanced.  It was flavorful, light but filling.  I don't usually like seafood pastas, but I think I would've preferred his dish over the Pappardelle.Overall, I think Cucina Urbana is still a nice restaurant.  As I said before, I would love to come back for the wine, but maybe next time I'll just stay away from the Pappardelle.Other tidbits:- Nice location.  Walking distance to Balboa Park.  - Parking can be a pain.  It can be difficult to find street parking.- Valet is available."}, {"review_id": "oeb23XFZJAJvLVQ_43l5rg", "user_id": "zvQ7B3KZuFOX7pYLsOxhpA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "Talk about ambiance! Wonderfully decorated!Man I love the feeling of deleting a bookmark! I've had this place bookmarked since 1/19/16 almost 2 years! Scenario: I made reservations here for dinner Friday night with my friend who was visiting from out-of-state. The earliest reservation they had available was 9:45pm. Make sure you book early! We arrived at the restaurant about 10 minutes early and we sat at the bar and ordered drinks while we waited for our table. The bar service was great we were asked if we were okay at least 3 times. We were seated at our scheduled time of 9:45 but somehow I think our assigned server forgot about us? All the tables next to us were being served but we sat there unnoticed. I was thinking maybe they were just held up or something, but no one even came to the table to take a drink order or anything. When we figured they forgot about us we started waving both hands for attention but still no one came by. Finally after 20 minutes my friend was hangry and decided to ask the hostess if someone could take our order.Brooklyn kindly went to our table even though we weren't his assigned table. He apologized for the wait and took care of us. That was really nice because if I were him I would be annoyed to have to serve a table that wasn't mine. Brooklyn was great and he had a friendly personality! I ended up ordering the Triangoli pasta which has lamb, pistachio, creme fraiche and cilantro! It was amazing! I loved the sauce on it, and I highly recommend ordering it. My friend ordered the Chili Thread Farafalle, garlic fries and the polenta. I got to try some of his garlic fries which was good. He said the pasta was okay but he didn't like the polenta. Oh yeah, and bread service is available upon request so make sure you ask!When our meal was done we were too full for dessert since we actually ate dessert before coming in but I could tell my friend still kind of wanted to order something. We decided not to but Brooklyn was super sweet and brought us out a lemon pie dessert! Very nice of him!The ambiance of the restaurant looks perfect for a romantic date! I love the dim lighting and the couch seating along with the candles. Heck I'm gonna make my next app date take me here LOL"}, {"review_id": "kXZdyop2sJKv25YiF7CZKg", "user_id": "KaLc2Zclz-i7gJ1uw-GgIQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "Today I made the mistake of coming here for lunch. LUNCH MENU ISN'T THE SAME AS DINNER MENUI decided to come here spontaneously after visiting Balboa since its super close by. I was tempted by the photos of gnocchi... but turns out, its only a DINNER item!! I should have bailed once I learned about this -.-CLASSY ATTIRE Apparently you have to dress up for this place. If you don't dress up nice, workers will treat you like a second class citizen.  RUDE SERVICE Lynn D is a horrible server. She was our waitress and did not seem like she wanted to be there. Maybe she was hung over from last night's New Years party. But her entire attitude RUINED my day. Girl, if you dont wanna be here, then go home and stay home instead of working and ruining everyone's day!! Lynn D is a waitress with a bad attitude and needs to be retrained, especially learning to treat people with respect. SCAMS I felt like I was being cheated after our waitress, Lynn D, brought the check. We were charged $7.00 for a bottle of water WTF? This waitress never even mentioned it costs money!?! This is the first thing that she asked, if we wanted water and gave beverage options. Obviously, as customers, we are all well aware of the waiter asking if we want a drink right? well... we don't even think twice that it costs money because its WATER and if the waitress doesn't ever specify!!! BEWARE they probably teach their waiters how to be sly and make it seem like they are offering free water but its a trick to get you to pay more money. OVERPRICED SMALL PORTION FOOD The food was mediocre. I got a tiny plate of pasta for $19 that tasted like I could have made it myself ... UM...  the plate was super small. For the size and taste in food, I really don't think it's worth that much money. PARKING Mostly are street parking. It will be VERY DIFFICULT to find parking. In the end, this place actually ruined the rest of my day. I made a huge mistake in coming here. The food is small portion, lack of taste, poor service, and EXPENSIVE. I will NEVER come back here and I warn others not to visit this place either.

All were amazing and I would get both of the entrees again. The burrata was a little too bland for my taste, but I loved the options of different items to dip with, and next time I would try their other dip options like the black hummus!

As all the reviews attest, the atmosphere is great. Not sure if they always have so many lights or if it was decorated more for Christmas, but the ambience was very festive. It got a bit loud towards the end of the meal so keep that in mind if you are looking for a quiet place. Service was outstanding. My mom has food allergies and they were able to do things like the octopus with the sauces on the side...which surprisingly did not detract from the tender grilled octopus. The fried squash blossoms blew my mind. I have had this dish at places like Blue Point but Cucina urbana does them best. Would return for this appetizer alone. Another standout is their wine prices. I love that they don't mark up the bottles but only charge you a $9 corkage fee. If I lived in Banker's Hill I would probably dine here once a week, based on wine selection and pricing alone.For our dinners we had quite an assortment. I opted for the mushroom pizza but not being a big fan of goat's cheese he subbed cow's milk cheese for me. I love mushrooms, but let me say, you better \"really\" love mushrooms because the best way to sum up this dish is \"very shroomy.\"  Probably wouldn't get this pizza again even though it is raved about. I did like the addition of the fennel sausage to balance out the shrooms....and their pizza dough is really good. My dad ordered the date pizza and wondered why it was sweet...he doesn't get out much....LOL. I tried it and it's just as one would expect and quite good but definitely better as a shared appetizer. I got to try the whole snapper and that was a good dish...not one piece left behind. The squid ink pasta was also tasty as well as the spaghetti with meatballs. Only disappointment was the shrimp puttanesca which was too salty for most of our tastes. This was mentioned by another reviewer previously so definitely order this dish if you like your food on the salty side.The budino and bombolini desserts are very good. I'm not a huge dessert person, but devoured the slice of chocolate cake they gave me in addition to the pudding and the fried donuts filled with Nutella. After this dining experience I can see why it's a popular place and was packed even on a weeknight."}, {"review_id": "TE6d5w79IB65Ax9d_Hde9Q", "user_id": "LFfyo4-MJ_v4zR5ieRQKNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "We came here for our second date 3.5 years ago and we're back!
