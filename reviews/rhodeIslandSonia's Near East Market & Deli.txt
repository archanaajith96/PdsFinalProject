While you won't be disappointed with anything on their menu, I'd recommend trying something from the Middle East inspired menu, it's as it is fresh, homemade, and authentic as you can get. Yum! In addition to the deli and prepared foods case, Sonia's also boasts a wonderfully stocked Middle Eastern market full of all types on imported spices, canned goods, and frozen items not found in a typical grocery store. They also get fresh Syrian bread deliveries everyday - from a bakery in Worcester mostly - but once a week they get some bread delivered from Montreal, which is the best. The service is quick and friendly and the counter staff is eager to answer questions, make recommendations, and offer suggestions. They have a handful of tables and chairs if you want to eat here or they would be happy to package your food to go if that's more convenient."}, {"review_id": "-AXCRZ0viG4FYISzJVILLQ", "user_id": "x9zLV86F17PElYMljKABSQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/8/2017", "text": "Given all the 5-star reviews, Sonia's has been on my Yelp radar for a few months now.  I finally stopped there today for lunch.  Unfortunately, I can't add another 5-star review, as I had very mixed feelings about my experience.Their parking lot is small, so be prepared to park either on Park Avenue, or a side street.  I also walked right by the entrance because there was a pallet of bread in front of one of the double glass doors (I thought that entrance was blocked and there might be another entrance, but there was not).Inside is divided as follows:  The right one-third of the building features a small market of imported foods.  The deli/sandwich counter occupies the middle third of the store.  And the left third of the building has at least a half-dozen tables, and a couch, for customers who wish to dine in.  So you walk up to the counter and place your order; a menu board is above the deli.I didn't find any of the employees or owners to be especially friendly, although it was rather busy, during the peak of a Friday lunch rush.  The whole time I was there, there were at least a half-dozen customers in line to order, or waiting for their order to come up, at any given time.One complaint I have is that there is a very limited selection in their two drink coolers in front of the deli counter.  I wanted a Sprite, but had to get a Coke instead.After placing my order, all the tables were occupied, but then two diners left, freeing up a small table at a front window, which I promptly occupied, even though it still had dirty plates from the previous diners (I'm not too picky about such things).  Then I waited ... and waited ... and waited, as I watched the time on my phone.  I only get 30 minutes for lunch, so after about 15 minutes and no sandwich, I walked up to the counter and asked when it would be ready.  Oddly enough, it was ready right after I asked about it.  I wondered if it had been finished 10 minutes earlier and was just sitting back there, forgotten, until I inquired ... things that make you go 'hmmm'.So I finally had my Italian sandwich in my hot little hands; it was nicely presented on a colorful plate.  It wasn't a very big sandwich, however (and it did not quite satisfy my hunger), so for $7.49, it was not a good value.From a quality standpoint, it was a good sandwich, with fresh ingredients assembled skillfully.  One thing was slightly odd:  the bread (baguette or French bread or Italian bread, whatever you want to call it).  It had a nice, crunchy crust, but was oddly thin, and not much flavor.  If I was the owner of Sonia's, I would seriously re-think my choice or supplier of bread.  With better bread (and an overall larger sized sandwich), it could be a 5-star sandwich.The dining experience was not at all relaxing.  Sonia's is clean inside, but has an almost industrial look with the exposed ductwork painted black, somewhat muted by earth tone colors on the walls and softer-looking tables and chairs.  Hard surfaces did little to absorb the noise level, and the dining area is a bit close to the deli counter, so you have to look at people anxiously waiting for their food (I noticed at least a few people jiggling their leg in a nervous tic - maybe they were on a tight time schedule too).I'm not particularly fond of Middle Eastern food like falafel, so I don't think I'll be back here, but at least I tried it out and satisfied my curiosity.  My sandwich was high quality, although a poor value, and service was too slow for me to make this a viable lunch option."}, {"review_id": "9aBlitsZFrFdPKVt72Lfgg", "user_id": "B2PNx5i1vEi4unoexCGwkQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "A coworker mentioned I should swing by here to pick up some chicken soup when I was sick.

They have traditional deli sandwiches to Mediterranean falafel and gyros. There is something for everyone. My favorite sandwich is the eggplant deluxe and I add pesto. Oh and by the way they have the best breakfast sandwich in RI. It's real eggs on homemade sweet bread. Sounds weird but seriously the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had. The chicken bowl is my finances goto. This amazingly seasoned chicken over rice pilaf with a cucumber yogurt sauce, lettuce, tomato, onion and he adds a little hot sauce. To die for.

Everyone there makes you feel so welcome! They seem very happy to be working and are eager to help you. Amazing customer service!We came in today with tickets from RI Food Fights for their Italian grinder. While we were waiting for them to be made, we ended up purchasing dried mango and poppy seeds. The prices on all their spices are great! The poppy seeds were sold in containers of about .5 pound and were less than $4! And I noticed they had barberries as well, which I've never seen around here. When our sandwiches were delivered, the gentleman asked how we'd been doing so far working our way through all the local places participating in the grinder competition and was confident that we'd enjoy their version.It was DELICIOUS. The bread was perfectly chewy and my brother observed that it was glossy and just beautiful to look at. The quality of the meats was obvious, and it had mortadella...my favorite...and plenty of chopped pickles, banana peppers, and red wine vinegar for acidity. I highly recommend this spot for the quality of their products, their delicious sandwiches, the great hard-to-find-elsewhere items in the market section, and their incredible customer service. Seriously, you will leave with a smile on your face!"}, {"review_id": "vuEvcryV_FEuihq6aazV8g", "user_id": "WhdUGRi63JbFvBHHXD2FEg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Rarely find myself in Cranston but did at 5:30 on a Friday night. I really wanted East Side Pockets but couldn't stomach the traffic going north so I found this on Yelp. The parking lot is small but manageable with some 5 point turns. The shop is clean, fairly large and uncluttered. I ordered a falafel salad and it was ready within 5 minutes. The salad was unfussy with lots of hummus and tabouleh and a little splash of tahini dressing - just wish there were more than 3 pieces of falafel. If I'm in Cranston again then yah, I'll be back.

Sonia's is more of a convenience store...plus so much more. They have a myriad of Boar's head sandwich options, as well as freshly prepared Mediterranean gyros and salads. I do not recommend the falafel (they were cold and overly fried), but I think the supreme gyros on the fresh, warm pita bread with tangy tzatziki sauce are worth trying. My buddy and I shared the sampler heaven...which for $13 was actually a little bit less than filling, but I really liked the hummus and the crispy pita chips. The grape leaves were very fresh (although there were only two) and the two types of tabbouleh were appreciated, but I would have preferred baba ganoush instead.As for the shop, there were so many seasoning, snacks and nuts that I didn't know where or how to start.
