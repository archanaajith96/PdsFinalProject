We will order one of everything on the food menu plus the cocktail. Honestly, it's very hit or miss...there's always one dish I love but overall underwhelming. I've also eaten dinner here but am still waiting to find the dish that blows me away. The food has always been okay but nothing that would make me want to spend the money. I will say that the lunch burger is always a solid choice and you can get truffle fries! TK has my favorite bread basket because it includes papadum and they are always rotating the spread with interesting combinations. And you have to try the carrot cake waffle. WOW! It is so good and is guaranteed to close your meal on a high note. But the reason I keep coming back is because of the service. Roger is a rockstar waiter. He's a down to earth, genuinely nice guy and always makes our night."}, {"review_id": "VVmrKfnyhHr_2ZSxfz8wPg", "user_id": "Q-vguTWrvNSLGERIz8d3NA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "The service was not good.  I got the food exactly 50 minuets after ordering. I have zero problem with kitchens taking their time and hate fast food, but as I asked the waiter after 30 and 45 minuets, he did not check and said it just takes time. If you know it's going to be over 45 minuets, you should say before.

It's too bad the food here was pretty good, because the waitress we had was rude. Maybe she was having a bad day or maybe she was stressed because we were a large party (14 people) but that's no excuse to be rude to your customers. She only took half of the orders then left, brought half of the drinks or food at a time, and took plates away or brought plates without saying excuse me. The food was pretty good - I had the calamari and spinach and artichoke dip, which were both very tasty. The calamari had an unexpected spice and the dip had very good pita chips. I had the shrimp Cobb salad as an entree which was very fulling, and tried the fries which were also very crunchy and flavorful."}, {"review_id": "8E7nV4xd14WRQlWqn4nP0g", "user_id": "DFOwlNmKgPtpATFZhF3rBg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "A simple and good place.  Some was a hit or miss but overall good place for a nice group.Menu is a mix of just about everything.  Apps were large so shareable.  Definitely recommend the lettuce wraps.  However, since everything is deconstructed it was annoying to build your own wrap with each individual veggie and sauce out of spoons.  Looks cute but not quite practical.  The shrimp and sweet potato fritter was amazing.  Big shrimp and great taste.  Calamari wasn't anything special.The salads weren't great.  The shrimp Cobb was also deconstructed and had zero flavor.  Feedback from others was the same for other salads.  The mashed potatoes are mouth watering good and the risotto.  Good service, portions, and price."}, {"review_id": "e62cXo1f5tplObD0W6WX5w", "user_id": "GTGqLImmRJ-gxkpN8T8CUQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "We went to Trumbull Kitchen after work but before a yard goats game. A friend lives near by and we were meeting him there. It was packed at 5:45pm but we were lucky enough to find a table. We tried the avocado toast, which was delicious. Seriously. With a fried egg on top and a not completely set yolk, it was Devine. We also tried the lobster sandwich (which left something to be desired), and the panko crusted tots. My partner also tried the citrus sangria and it was really good. Although it seemed like the kitchen was a bit behind - it was understandable. It's interesting because I just went to their website to look at the menu to make sure I didn't miss anything and they haven't updated the happy hour menu to April by the 9th."}, {"review_id": "TOU3NK3EbH9APc5YIrY-KQ", "user_id": "JUajRnrmc0sq_3tARdhsQw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/11/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I've been coming here so frequently I feel it's time I updated my review. After trying almost all Max restaurants in the area, TK is my second favorite (#1 being Max Downtown). Bae and I come here monthly, as it's a nice spot for dinner on a weeknight. Great crowd and bar scene, and the service has always been good as well. The menu changes seasonally like all Max's, so it's always a little different when we go. -Shrimp Asian lettuce cups: we get these EVERY TIME. Great presentation and delicious-Szechuan Pork dumplings: good portion and very flavorful-Haddock: my go to entree. Always prepared differently and always tasty-Short Ribs: seriously tastes like a dish my grandmother used to make. They're that good, and quite possibly the best thing on the whole menu-Brussels sprouts and Cauliflower sides are solidThere's a parking garage conveniently located adjacent to the restaurant for people like me that don't feel like looking for parking.Half price bottles of wine under $100 on Thursdays!

Though I had a good experience with the service, I felt like the quality of the food left something to be desired. Then again, maybe my expectations were too high for a spot that serves burgers, Pad Thai, meatloaf, sushi, quesadillas, and pizza (the stone pies) all on one menu. But again, everyone can find something that they like.With limited vegan options, I ended up going with the Pad Thai, which was okay but I probably wouldn't order again. Sadly, I also learned that none of the fries are vegetarian or vegan, as all of their meat and potatoes gets cooked in one fryer, nor is the side of kimchi fried rice."}, {"review_id": "w5G7p3AOYZ1h72YmroggCw", "user_id": "mymPIHev5TzyuZW4D4dWGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Probably the best meal I had in Hartford.

I have been here a few times prior to college basketball games across the street at the civi center and alway enjoy it. Tonight the Gumbo was well spiced with chunks of chorizo, chicken plenty of okra great flavor. I went with the cup instead of the bowl but I would recommend the bowl. The cup was just a tease. My wife had 2 great shrimp cocktail.  She also had the filet appetizer for her main meal and it was very nice. We both thought the Blue cheese was a little strong but that could not detract from the high quality filet cooked perfectly medium rare like she requested.I had the meatloaf for my main dish. I am sucker for a good meatloaf on any menu.  The loaf was two medium large slices that were juicy and delicious. The garlic sauce on the side was fabulous and the green beans were perfect. I skipped the mashed potatoes and instead got the Thai cauliflower dish - that was amazing. Cooked but still crunchy cauliflower with a nice Asian inspired dressing - well done. The staff was great and friendly and the place clean and well appointed."}, {"review_id": "cjmv-BeGUldxxqq4M5IGog", "user_id": "HoX16kQE_osaTdw_Sh9tCQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "This is a solid restaurant and worth a visit.My husband and I stopped in tonight and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.We tried the Cool Tart and Strawberry Gin Smash cocktails - both very good and not too sweet.For our appetizer we had the rock shrimp and sweet potato fritters.

This was not a problem since we came here on a whim and didn't mind sitting at the bar.We weren't super hungry, so we decided to get a few appetizers instead of large plates so we could try more of the menu. We ordered the Asian lettuce cups (chicken), short rib steamed buns, and calamari. All of the food was good. The standout by far were the short rib buns - definitely would order over and over again!! A small plate of two bao-style steamed bread buns, with short ribs and kimchi and a tasty sauce - I didn't want them to end. The calamari was good, also Asian influenced, but the dipping sauce was a little odd... The lettuce cups were fun too - they're \"diy\" and you get to assemble the meat mixture of your choice with a bunch of toppings and dipping sauces. Overall the food was good, reasonably priced, and the atmosphere was pretty nice too. Service was friendly.
