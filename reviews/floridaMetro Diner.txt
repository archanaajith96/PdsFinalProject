Came around noon and boy was it busy. Lots of people waiting outside, but decided to ask the wait for two people and to my surprise was told only 25-30 minutes, so we decided to wait. Well about 15 minutes later we were called, so the wait wasn't bad at all. And even with all these people the hostesses were very friendly and were very organized and able to update people of their wait times. Great job!When we actually walked into the place, as the hostesses greeted us outside, it was packed with both patrons and staff. So many people working here it was actually quite the production. Our server quickly took our drink orders and next out food. I got the Bold City Burger and my wife got the Philly Cheese Steak. Both were amazing and after I quickly scarfed down the burger, the waitress said she was surprised I finished it cause the portions are so big. Looking around, all the food looked amazing, specifically the chicken & waffles. Huge pieces of fried chicken with perfectly brown waffles. Looking at them I felt like I made a mistake with the burger, even thought it was also delicious, and will definitely be getting that next time!!So yeah, this place is loaded with an amazing comfort food you should find on any diner menu and it all taste amazing! Service is all around A+ and 100% recommend!"}, {"review_id": "-T98LhRz9DKocbjs-wBlUA", "user_id": "05MpsTohoxyAOOQY7SmGDw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Bustling fast paced diner. The greeters at the door were super friendly and pleasant which was a good start to our morning. The space is small, but it was comfortable. Our waitress was bubbly, attentive and friendly. I say this place is perfect for breakfast and brunch. Families. Couples. ANYONE would enjoy this place.The food: Crab Cake Benedict was delicious; the crab cake was REAL crab; perfectly seasoned and prepared. The Hollandaise sauce was great. The Belgian Waffle with strawberry butter was so good! Waffle was normal, soft and yummy, but that butter! Such a unique addition. The San Antonian Benedict, my friend had it and described it was \"absolutely delicious\"."}, {"review_id": "eiFk1kyMfV4XXO6P_UyWnQ", "user_id": "TlyiIwTm18EBBXzPDnw_3A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Came here out from of town and had to try the ichicken and waffles along with the special crab Benedict and a side of turkey links. As much as I wish I had taken pictures, it would have served no justice! Must add, THANK YOU to my fellow yelpers, I found this gem!!Chicken & waffles- you get half a bird! One drumstick, one thigh, one wing, one turkey breast. A nice sized waffle, with a strawberry butter. The fried chicken was nothing but flavorful, crisp, HOT & FRESH, dipped in their house syrup. Let me say, I was very skeptical about the syrup with hot sauce mix, but it WORKED!! Everything about this was amazingly delicious! I normally don't eat the skin off any chicken, but this was finger licking good!! 5 stars!!!Crab Benedict- I asked for the egg poached well done, and that's what they delivered! Great crab portion, flavorful, the sauce was amazing! It came with a side of hash browns which wasn't impressive compared to the rest of the food, but who cares!! Everything else was just *magical*The side of turkey links, nothing special, but still good!In short, this place is phenomenal. The fact that they have hundreds of 5 star reviews proves that that have such a high standard they certainly uphold. The waitress? I can't remember her name (I have s bad memory, I'm sure she told me) but she was wonderful! Very attentive, but not too much as to it becomes annoying. I saw her check on us from afar, saw us eating and left us alone. As soon as she saw my peach tea empty, she was right there to refill! 5 stars too! If you're visiting, this is a MUST GO!!!!! I was so disappointed that we hadn't gone earlier. We had spent $30 at Starbucks the day before which we could have spent here and had AMAZING food!!Keep it up and thank you!!"}, {"review_id": "al3wA_A1BjmZuh6bq25DxA", "user_id": "opWQBDvAgChc-vCmHfCMJg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Let me first say I am a frequent flyer of Metro diner and a true fan of their breakfast. Today we went to this particular Metro diner and we had Thomas as our waiter. Let me say Thomas was a very good waiter very thorough knowledgeable friendly and great sense of humor. The eggs were made to perfection the pancakes were excellent and the hashbrowns were the best. The people that I was with very much loved theirs as well.

You can get upscale, fancy breakfasts or just plain diner ones. Either way, the food is good. The coffee is delicious and served at the perfect temperature, hot but drinkable. The food is cooked to order and, in my experience, always perfect. This is the original diner and is well worn and loved. Lots of neat pictures on the wall. Plenty of staff working but we never feel rushed. Parking is awkward with a tiny lot and scary street spaces (especially during school hours). The diner is also bigger than it appears. There is a lot of hype about this place, but it's worth it."}, {"review_id": "Q6jxkqmNVMys6f2CBvO2Qg", "user_id": "JluiUv88bkA5RU0jy5pF0w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "The food was good, but the waitress ruined the experience. My friend and I are in town for Rockville, and we needed breakfast before going out there. I saw this place on yelp and decided to try it out. The Oscar omelette was pretty good, but there was very little crab in it and not enough Hollandaise sauce. Their chicken and waffles was just ok, but definitely not nearly as good as Nashville hot chicken. The best part about the meal were the cheesy grits. Granted, the grits themselves were extremely bland and needed a lot of salt and pepper. They put the perfect amount of cheese to truly make them cheesy. The waitress was nice, but I felt extremely rushed. I understand it was a busy Saturday morning, but we were sitting at the bar area. I don't think I was taking an overly long time, but felt a lot of pressure to try and eat my food as fast as I could. She almost took away the plate before I was done with it, and she brought out our checks before asking if there was anything else we wanted. When I told her I would like a second orange juice, she seemed annoyed that she had to go and modify the check... which she would've had to anyways since she put my friend and I on a single check (since she was in such a rush to get us out, she didn't even ask if we wanted them together or separate). The food overall was fine, but the way we were treated like cattle like in and out made it difficult to enjoy the food. Also, skip their spicy sweet sauce- it's gross."}, {"review_id": "OWXg61c4XPydN3IWzoxk1g", "user_id": "PlvTYfl-Jf6BjM-v9kCIjg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Well, I rode in the back seat of a Chevy Impala expecting to arrive in Callahan to eat at Callahan Barbecue.

He guaranteed my satisfaction. This was so good it was stupid. The grits were deep fried in a brick, then stacked on the plated surrounded by white sauce containing generous shrimp.Little did I know that one of the managing owners was working the grill.

The lines are still lengthy at the the original but do to all the expansions its doable. The place is a mess and could use a remodel but its like grammas kitchen.

Our other friend had the two eggs and choice of meat breakfast and that was a typical fill up. Our host Anastasia was very pleasant and professional, she checked in with us very often and offered to help with any questions.

We stopped in at the Jacksonville location which is the original diner. We were greeted with a smile, seated promptly & had an amazing server named, Thomas. I had been traveling all day so this was my first meal of the day. It was my destination of choice & I had been looking forward to this for weeks. I was not disappointed. The sweet peach tea is so delicious. I must say it complemented my chicken & waffles entree perfectly.  The chicken had a crispy, flavorful crust with juicy meat. The waffles were perfect & served with that delicious strawberry butter. It is typically served with a sweet/spicy sauce as well. I finally got my Metro Diner gear now too which entitles you to 10% off of your entree on your subsequent visits if worn. Love this place. Such friendly owners & staff.

Where to begin? For the longest time, I have always disliked fried chicken. Just the thought of how greasy it is makes me feel sick.

His friend was telling me how amazing their fried chicken and waffles are, and I knew I had to try it. It's a bit pricey, but for the portion they give, it was worth it. I still think about the strawberry butter and how the hot sauce and maple syrup compliment each other. They're amazing.

It has that classic diner feel - open kitchen, cozy seating, pictures on the walls, etc. They offer classic diner food, as well as more trendy options like avocado toast and chicken and waffles. I've never had something I didn't like! This time I tried the avocado toast - for $6/7 I got two pieces of toast, heaped with avocado and tomato. I also asked for two eggs, thinking that, as usual, the avocado toast would be small and overpriced, but I wasn't able to finish it!

The food is amazing and bountiful and service is top notch.On this particular Saturday morning I was passing through Jacksonville and had called my daughter so we could enjoy breakfast together.  She mentioned Metro Diner since it was near her place and I readily agreed.  We arrived around 7:30am and we had beaten the crowd, as there was only 1 vehicle in their small adjacent parking lot.  I was initially surprised at their small building, because I had eaten once at their San Jose location (south Jacksonville area), and it was a large restaurant (with large crowds). But I soon learned that this was the \"Original Metro Diner\" (there are now 5 in the area), where it all began in 1992. We decided to sit outside as it was a nice morning.  \"Kelly\", our waitress came and took our drink orders, and since we knew what we wanted we ordered our entrees as well.  The outside seating consists of rectangular slate-type tables with 4 aluminum chairs.  It was comfortable and a large oak provides ample shade for afternoon visitors.  Within 10 minutes of ordering, Kelly returned with our meals.  They were truly sights to behold!  We had both ordered two of their \"Favorites\".  My daughter had ordered the \"Fried Chicken and Waffle\":  1/2 fried chicken and a Belgian waffle, topped with powdered sugar and sweet strawberry butter, and served with their signature sweet and spicy sauce.  It looked incredibly good!I had ordered the \"Yo Hala on the Square\":  2 thick slices of challah bread stuffed with a mixture of bananas, brown sugar, cream cheese, and hazelnut syrup, prepared like French toast, and topped with a blueberry strawberry compote and powdered sugar.  Being as it was the 4th of July weekend, they had a special version called the \"Red, White, & Blue Yo Hala\" - basically with the same ingredients as above, except instead of banana and brown sugar filling, it was a strawberry cream cheese.  It looked amazing!  I loved mine, with the fresh blueberries, strawberry cream cheese, and challah bread all creating a great taste! It was way too much though as I couldn't finish, but did put a sizable dent in it, ha! My daughter loved hers and asked for a box to take home leftovers, enough for lunch and dinner (I mean it was a 1/2 of fried chicken for crying out loud, haha!). Kelly came out to check on us multiple times, refilling our coffee cups, was very courteous, friendly, and helpful. Total price came to $34.30.  It was worth it, and because of price for quality of food, excellent service, and a very enjoyable experience, I rate them a heartily 5 stars! I highly recommend you try them!"}, {"review_id": "RJK8XgzrqYIRurCkeri7tg", "user_id": "DTBDcnZjB6SL78RZtAU2bw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/24/2017", "text": "I had an amazing meal here and loved there somewhat retro style menu. Unfortunately I'm giving this place 2 stars because of what I witnessed during the course of service. I ordered a crab cake Benny advised by my waitress. This was very yummers and warranted a proper gobble. I loved the sweet crab flavor with the earthy almighty and perfectly cooked over medium egg that brings my favorite flavor. Drizzled and swimming in a perfect hollandaise. True adult fuel. Unfortunately my fries were cold but that's not why I'm leaving two stars.My party received grits so cold it was like the \"Chef\" lol I mean \"Short order cook\" forgot to heat them. It had formed skin and couldn't melt the lowest form of cheese which isn't even cheese known as \"American cheese\". I'm patriotic but American cheese is plastic and never enters my body knowingly. I'm mortified to send things back and honestly don't partake in the behavior. However a member of my party righteously sent that \"shit show\" back. And when I say \"shit show\" I honestly mean it in the nicest possible way. When it came back it was perfect grits. And what was originally advertised. After all this still not the reason for the two star.Are we ready for why this perfectly charming place gets a two star.Mind you I loved my food even though my fries were cold. It was the waitress who was nice that earned the two two star. She visited the table twice to ask \"are the grits hot enough for you now.\" It came across very snarky. And to check twice was odd..like she didn't believe us. After all we returned to another server because we couldn't locate her.It very much seemed that she had no idea they came out of the fridge And no one heated them up. We can all heat garbage in a microwave. It's grits we aren't expecting much. The concern is not \"hot enough\" the concern was did you kill the bacteria in the food. To reference the first part of this review. My eggs where perfect. Grown in a chickens body and not Exposed to our dirty planet until cracked in a pan and cooked to perfection. The concern was .....do you understand food.? If you forgot to heat the grits and fries. What else did you forget? Do you know to wash bullshit from China? Luckily I am cautious on the order. Will return.

The specials were a fried chicken and waffle Benedict (couldn't pass that up) and strawberry cream cheese stuffed crepes (my daughter jumped on that). The food and service here were outstanding. Will definitely go back to try some other plates on the menu. Side note: I watched a fellow patron throw down a huge plate of fried chicken, a huge plate of waffles, and two plates of hashbrowns with mushrooms.  Parking isn't all that great, but with a short walk there is an elementary school next door you can park at if it's not a school day"}, {"review_id": "kvqDdVF4oEP-OrdQH25YoQ", "user_id": "OvLCe2ANYQowyyXP0atdMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Best breakfast that I've had in Jax.
