He made time to give us a back story of how he derived his Cassoulet, a wonderful home-style comfort dish he loved growing up in France.I find his Cassoulet quite hearty and inviting with its softer textural varieties from the Canellini Beans, Shredded Braised Lamb Shoulder, Duck Leg Confit, and regional Sausages from Southern France. It's a heavy dish with a tad too much salt, but can be balanced out with good wine...I selected a modest 2006 Supérieur Senailhac I found rather luxurious being a bargain French Bordeaux, smooth mouthfeel and a nice fragrant blend with oak and dark fruit tasting notes.Escargots: a half dozen prepared in the classic Bourguignonne style. Some exertions needed upon mastication, good balance of salty and earthy.Fourme D'Armbert Tart - Frisee Salad, Anjou Pear, Balsamic Reduction: a mountainous pile of Frisee gives a fresh crispness that compliments a heavier pan-fried savory tart batter, offset by the sweetness of the fruit. This was a very simple dish that demonstrated effective contrast.Trou Normand - Green Apple Sorbet, Calvados: I don't recall ever being served a dessert amuse bouche in between warm savory courses in any French dining, but I find the freezing tartness of the sorbet an effective disruption, giving tonight's dinner a multidimensional experience.Wild Skate Wing in Brown Butter - Fingering Potato, Sauce Grenobloise, Mache: A popular Southeastern French dish is this tricky fish which could taste rather off if improperly prepared. Gardelle seems to have mastered his cooking as the dish tasted wonderful. Excellent pairing with creamed Mache.Filet Mignon & Bone Marrow - Pommes de Terre Landaise, King Trumpet & Oyster Mushrooms, Sauce a la Perigourdine: I'm a sucker for anything marrow; its fattiness is beautifully rendered and plays nicely with a medallion of the steak. Umami nuances tastefully furnished by both varieties of the fungi.Profiteroles: sweet creamy filling in a puffy choux, topped with chocolate syrup and dusted in powdered sugar. I love how Gardelle sticks with the classics.Tahitienne Vanilla Creme Brulee: a creamy and subly floral-fruity tasting notes from Tahitian Vanilla Beans give this brulee a nuance edge, topped with a perfectly caramelized crisp.Gardelle cordially shook my hand as we departed, sealing a memory to last. This is probably my best French dining experience for under $200 for two. A must try for a bargain prix fixe that should have deserved at least a Michelin."}, {"review_id": "R8MeKj1t_JnrhozStc2e6Q", "user_id": "7SIdNdzDeWC6E8EFGXhbGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Excellent sweetbreads, one of the best I had in years.  Cooked just right, tender with great flavor, not too salty on a pastry bowl.Oysters were very fresh with clean ocean flavor.My husband had cassoulet, he was very happy too.Portion was very generous.Highly recommend this place."}, {"review_id": "L0489kaguU29OgANPr2Hvg", "user_id": "-BIo8ZE3w3Lbu672Tc0EhQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Chapeau is the perfect spot to take your date. I took my lady here for our two year anniversary and she's already trying to plan out next date back!Everything from the romantic ambiance to the dimly candle lit seating just makes everything perfect. The owner of the restaurant is amiable and isn't shy to greet and joke with every table. We decided to order a la carte. My lady ordered the trio salmon, Scallops and sea bass with oxtail. I ordered the filet mignon with bone marrow and pesto escargot. The trio salmon was creamy and melted right in my mouth. The scallops were tender and I was impressed over the fact that there wasn't a sandy texture. Scallops are one of the hardest ingredient to perfect but chapeau definitely perfected it. The sea bass and oxtail was not to my lady's liking. It was overly salted to the point where she scooted her dish to my side for me to eat. typical. The filet was juicy and just gushed with flavor. The bone marrow was nicely crusted and just melted with each bite. The perfect combo indeed. Everything was absolutely perfect and I highly recommend trying this place out."}, {"review_id": "mOc5ZDdgfp4Cen_5yE9IQQ", "user_id": "eMCTaJpOcVx701hf-GkIJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "4.5/5.

You can very easily hear what's going on next to you and it's hard to leave to use the restroom."}, {"review_id": "xAhJIBG7hD5NK_yvPSYv1w", "user_id": "LvL7XDgnMYkv9WTo7XMbUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "One of the solid French cuisines in SF. My first time here was back in 2012 for my birthday and my experience kept with me till this day. Luckily, Chapeau is also part of RWSF so I was still able to try this place for years since for a fraction of the price. My most recent visit was.. quite a while back for a date night with the bf. The place hasn't changed much; same vibe, same attentive service, and the chef/owner greeting us and bidding us farewell and goodnight after our meal.ESCARGOTS: wow. so yummy and hot. 6 delicious hot pieces of escargot baked in this green parsley pesto sauce? IT was good to say the least. You may even dip your bread in to get the rest of the sauce. COTE BOEUF: this was on the specials on the day we went and our waiter said it was good enough to share if we're not too hungry. In English terms, Cote Boeuf means Rib Steak which is a thick piece of rib steak with bone. The waiter wasn't joking when he said we could share this. He presented the whole rib steak to us pre-cut and it was very big in portion. Then he took it back in and cut it into pieces for us. The steak was very tender and juicy. The bone marrow was hot and deliciously gelatinous and fatty. Paired together was like a burst of heavenly flavors in my mouth. I really enjoyed it. I had about 5 pieces of perfectly cooked medium rare rib steak and it was more than enough.BASIL NAPOLEON: I'm not really a sweets person so I often skip dessert but the bf can be when he wants to. He was feeling dessert this particular night so we asked our waiter for a suggestion. He recommended their popular Basil Napoleon which he said was light and not too sweet so that i can try it also. The dessert was very pretty with fruits such as mango, strawberries, kiwi's, etc. It was lightly crisp as you take your first bite but met with a creamy texture once you sink your teeth in. Flavors were interesting and light indeed; my bf really liked it. But it was just alright for me. A bit too sour from the mango. but then again... i do have a biased opinion on desserts and mango lol. Service was superb. Our waiter, Guillame (on the receipt), was really cordial and formal. Refilled our waters without request and checked in without being too hovering.  Another memorable dinner at Chapeau :)"}, {"review_id": "3f3iMHBpkw5yve5jbO85sw", "user_id": "r-4dnDhDFjLUDlh-A5zeBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "My favorite French spot in the city.

The service was absolutely impeccable, and the food was beyond delicious. For my starter, I had the escargot. These were pretty rich, and it was so good to dip your bread to sop up the sauce. I also had the foie gras, which just melted. For my main entree, I went for the prime rib for 2, and it was definitely a lot for 2 people! The meat was seasoned so perfectly, and it was cooked just the way I like it (medium rare)! It also came with bone marrow, really good shoestring fries, the best potatoes au gratin, and kale. The server suggested the Domaine du Grapillon D'Or gigondas 2014, and it paired well with everyone's dishes. For dessert, I had the chocolate lava cake, which was very chocolate-y. :) I highly recommend this restaurant!"}, {"review_id": "SIWOKc-kgGS1OhorCPn_Qg", "user_id": "4fVOYQHv0IckKjz5vZ-tSg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "Chapeau is located in inner Richmond.

We got really full and couldn't finish all the entrees and desserts but had at least half of each. The ambience is nice, dim lighting but it was too cozy with tables pretty close to each other. Appetizers:Highly recommend the foie gras. Escargot was also really good and is served out of the shell. Entrees:Duck 2 ways was good but the halibut was so flavorful and delish (however too salty for my taste). Dessert:The oozing warm valrhona chocolate cake was delish w/ the rum raisin ice cream. I love sweets but the Baked Alaska was clawingly sweet - it could've done with 1/2 the merengue and it would've been perfect. They brought out creme brûlée for us on the house for no apparent reason which was a kind gesture - I usually don't like creme brûlée but this one was really good."}, {"review_id": "Mlajm0FV_bu8DTIhUej3iw", "user_id": "mz0nmzn1d9jVEUS9HC64GQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "I ordered the escargot, braised pork and the escalopes.

The SERVICE was absolutely impeccable.  Our main waiter, Anatoliy, exhibited a form of professionalism and vigilant attentiveness that is rarely encountered and that made for a memorably personalized dinner.

I just loved the flavor.  The bacon wrapped pork tenderloins were really good.  It was so tender cooked at medium temperature.  It blended nicely in the sauce.  I typically don't like sweet sauces.  However, this was just a hint of sweetness, so it wasn't that overpowering.  We had the baked alaska, which was a bit sweet for my taste.  It's just the meringue.  The chocolate sauce, ice cream, and nuts were awesome.  Just having a little bit of the meringue with the rest of the dessert made it much better b/c it wasn't that sweet.  The nuage de noix dessert was awesome and it wasn't too sweet.  Loved the pistaschio flavor.   I would have to come back and try the other dishes.  Especially the dish with skate.  You have remember to call ahead and reserve it or just set an earlier dinner reservation.  It's limited quantity.  Plus I've tried skate before."}, {"review_id": "aL2D4RnOrquGoSauLDzfDg", "user_id": "kjo48ItGiokcE3hh4DVfJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/8/2017", "text": "I rarely give five stars but this place totally deserves it.

We asked for a 1/2 bottle white wine recommendation and were not disappointed in the Chardonnay from France. They could give lessons on how to execute the PERFECT service: attentive, friendly, slightly reserved, non intrusive. I've eaten in Michelin Star restaurants and Chapeau's service is second to none. Only drawback is the level of noise. It is in general a bit loud and for us we had a couple of women right next to us that were extremely loud, and they were sitting next to the wall so it amplified it even more.

The chef personally greeted us at the entrance before we were seated in the center of the restaurant. My first impression is this place was quite loud because the tables are located so close to each other. Luckily, the table right next to us was unoccupied all night. Both of us opted for the three course meal because there were too many delicious dishes that we wanted to try. Started off with freshly baked bread that was so delicious!  Quite a challenge not to stuff myself.corn soup - the soup tastes so light and airy and the crab cake is exploding with crab flavor. bay scallop - comes in 1 large piece, easy to cut through. lobster bisque goes well with the scallop and the rice almost tastes like a risotto minus the cream.duck 2 ways - braised duck leg with duck breast. duck breast very soft, but the duck leg was a little overcooked on the outside. filet mignon - ordered medium rare. juicy in the middle, tough on the outside. take small bites for maximum flavor with red wine. Paired with a Pinot noir, the filet mignon tastes sweeter.basil napolean - fruit is very fresh. not overly sweet. tasted almost like a fruit parfait but not too coldchocolate cake - chocolate cake part super sweet. rum raisin ice cream paired with the cake was perfect. Service was a little slow at the beginning when taking our orders, but otherwise water refills were great and they constantly checked on us after each course.

I actually came in expecting a less-than-stellar experience because I was able to snag seats here without reservations on a weekend night when other popular restaurants nearby were all full - but I found the whole experience to be absolutely amazing.Menu items like the bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin with parsnip puree, caramelized apple, shaved Brussels sprouts, and apple-calvados sauce were every bit as savory and yummy as they sounded and looked. Quite filling and satisfying stuff, with quite reasonable prices given the good underlying quality. As if I hadn't already gorged enough on the entrée, the nuage de noix, with roasted pistachios, almonds, hazelnuts, frozen chantilly & Italian meringue, and an orange glaze was an incredibly sinful dessert. You bet I enjoyed every bite.What's more, service was impeccable, whether by the individual servers or by an incredibly gregarious guy - either the owner or the manager - who made sure to check in personally with every party.

Five of us dined, you can read the menus online. What I'm here to say is that the 3+ hour dinner was filled with love, laughter, wine and some of the best food in San Francisco. Bring your wallets because  dinner at Chapeau! is not the time to skimp. From the Foie Gras to the Profiterolles, and wine to match each course, the evening was a triumph.
