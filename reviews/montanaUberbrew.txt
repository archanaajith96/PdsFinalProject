Not much happening in Billings on a cold Thursday night in January but the Yelp reviews for Überbrew were solid. Chaney is extremely personal and a great complement to the very good food and pretty good beers. This was my first meal in Billings and I think it's going to be hard to beat."}, {"review_id": "Npi6eaUpV4IKDQ8fG7ioIg", "user_id": "uDfMbvFojB2Qj4CvtpwXrA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Ok.  I come into this place A LOT!  Probably too much for a normal person. But I love the food and beer.  With that being said, the service is a different story.  I witnessed two servers have an end-of-the-world melt down last night 3/20. The server with the fake eyebrows is incredibly scatter-brained.  She is clearly on some sort of amphetamine.  Her mannerisms alone are a huge red flag.  While she was working last night, I witnessed her:  Pick food out of her teeth and eat what she picked out without washing her hands.  Pick snuggies  out of her butt all night without washing her hands.  Walk around the restaurant eating food without washing her hands.  Grab dirty beer glasses by sticking her fingers inside and not washing her hands.  All while running around this place like it was on fire.  Yes, they were busy.  But I've been to hundreds of busy places and have never seen anyone act like this.  She is definitely the most inappropriate person I've encountered in a restaurant. Now onto the other server.  He had a beard and hat on.  It seemed that he's never waited tables before.  But I know he has because I see him all of the time in here.   It is very clear that he can not handle the shear volume of Überbrew.  He's not a walking health code violation like his co-worker, but he's an angry little person.  Never ever smiled.  Never a polite discourse.  Always requiring help from his manager.  Leaving empty glasses sit in front of customers for far too long.  But, if you're a pretty girl, he will go to great lengths to make you happy.  I watched this guy completely forget about the whole restaurant just to talk to a pretty girl at a table.  He'd then made sure to pour all of her beers himself.  I wouldn't care much about this, but I waited much longer for mine, as well as the rest of the restaurant (I stated earlier, you guys were busy).   Now, this one really digs deep.  He clearly served her well over the 3 beer limit.  That's not cool.  If everyone gets cut off at three, she'd better too.  I'd hate to see you guys loose your license over this guy.  Now, I'm not going to say I'm never coming in here again.  But if I see either of them working, my group and I are going to keep walking.  These two belong working in a short order diner, not an award winning brewery."}, {"review_id": "geH0yU-9LFkcGVLENG-ctw", "user_id": "QIAnAvfivhMaRjSyZN1bNw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "My favorite place to unwind.

They removed the quinoa cakes and tempeh and have zero veggie burger option. You can get the quinoa cake but only by ordering as a side with a salad, and one is $3.50. They were out during our most recent visit so we literally ate plain salads. Which would have been fine if we were expecting it but we didn't know they had removed these items from their menu. There are very very few veggie friendly places in town.

The atmosphere seemed pretty cool and I sat at the bar. I ordered the Hefeweizen which was decent. For food, I ordered the schnitzel sandwich and mc n cheese. The schnitzel was breaded way too thick. The meat also seemed under cooked in portions, since it was such a large piece. The Mac n cheese was decent, but seemed like it had been sitting awhile. The staff was very nice, but the food quality, just wasn't the best. The beer was decent. I didn't like that they closed so early, 8pm. The other brewery/restaurants in town stayed open until at least 10."}, {"review_id": "3gsqPvMDTFwobLaGX5XKwg", "user_id": "dkvRoZ646VM9fwqARUcHgg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/11/2017", "text": "My partner and I stayed the night in Billings on our way back from Banff National Park. Since neither of us had ever been to Montana's largest city, I, of course, consulted Yelp for a place to dine. We decided on Uberbrew because of its good reviews and appealing beer selection. I was a little hesitant though because it closed at 9 and it was getting close to 7:30.  We arrived to a bustling cute bar and restaurant and found a seat at a table in the bar area. We looked at the beer menu and saw several options that looked good so we both decided to try a flight. Our server seemed incredibly frazzled and was certainly less than professional when she came over to our table for the first time, saying that last call for beers was coming up since they can't serve alcohol past 8 o'clock. I guess it's Montana state law. She told us this and then proceeded to walk away and help other customers; it was very confusing and to be honest off putting. When she came back a few minutes later, we told her our flight choices and she nodded her head and repeated each selection without writing them down. When our flights were ready 10 minutes later, of course she got our orders wrong, and offered no apology. I heard her do the same thing with the table next to us. We had also asked for waters and we were both parched since we had been driving all day and for some reason getting patrons water was a difficult task for our server. When we asked for a fourth time for waters she sassily told us she would get them after the bustle of last call was over. Later I heard her complaining to the table next to us about customers asking for water. I'm sorry it's so hard to get a customer something as simple as water? When it came time to order, our server again was less than professional. She sat down at the seat next to me and stepped on my foot. Again no apology. The issues with the server aside, the beers are excellent and I especially enjoyed the Pink Slip, a berry style beer that's a beautiful pink color. My partner was a big fan of the IPA. The food also did not disappoint. I had Paul's Tall Salad (or a name similar to that) which is greens, cucumbers, tomatoes, grilled chicken and a quinoa cake. I had it with honey mustard and really enjoyed it. My partner got the Whiskey Burger with a side of mac and cheese. My partner said the burger was sooo good and I can attest that the mac and cheese was excellent. Overall, this place has a great vibe and atmosphere with delicious food and beer and I would definitely return, but if I walked in and saw our server from last night, I don't think I could stomach being waited on by her again."}, {"review_id": "LzTS3xph9puZnE4L0bZ3-Q", "user_id": "ZxGuOil_3kROo1jmWYTnTQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/8/2017", "text": "My favorite place in Billings, the white noise is THE BEST BEER IN THE WORLD!!!

I had a white wheat, and my husband had the IPA. My wheat had a great level of carbonation and I got an orange with it, which I loved. The establishment itself was awesome and had a really great, rustic yet industrial look, it was cool. Now for the rationale behind the three stars: They close at 9 and we arrived at 8. They were already doing last call, so we had to order everything upfront. Thought it was a bit early for a last call, but that's fine. Then, they proceeded to deep clean the entire bar. Like bleaching the floors completely cleaning the bathroom, removing the parts and pieces from the taps. I found it to be a really distracting experience. We were at the bar (as were others) trying to enjoy our snack and drinks, and I just found it to be poor customer service to completely tear down the bar an hour before closing. I get that the staff members want to get out as soon as possible, but I think they should come up with a more covert way to start the cleaning. Maybe close off unused sections and start there, not at the bar where all of the customers are. We also ordered the fried grilled cheese. I had one bite, but didn't find it to be good. It was literally a grilled cheese that had been breaded on the outside and fried. Because it had no dipping sauce, it was really dry and bleh. So, definitely come for the local beer. Pass on the food. And get there plenty early if you don't want to smell bleach and cleaning supplies during your visit."}, {"review_id": "w3zmBKYAyRkIEsplHSCEIA", "user_id": "ahSIFOUbcdfzhu442MJd0g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "I really enjoyed the meat and cheese board they had here.

For a place that had high reviews and calling itself a \"gastro pub\", I expected better than average food. Unfortunately, the sausage on a roll I ordered was overcooked, shriveled and tough. The wings were ok but the sauces were bland and sweet. My wife had eggs with biscuits and gravy that were also over cooked.The beer selection was fairly limited for a brewery with no lagers or winter-style beers. I tried 4 types of beer and all were fine but none that I would call outstanding.Service was ok at first but the wait staff seemed to disappear after delivering food. Our waitress was friendly but didn't seem to pay attention. A couple of items I ordered were wrong -- forgot mustard and wrong salad dressing. Strange thing was that when you took the last nite of anything they snapped up the plates in seconds.Overall, didn't feel like they wanted us as customers. The plate snatching and bringing the bill before we finished made it feel like they were rushing us even though 1/2 of the tables were empty."}, {"review_id": "5P75IKm3trJUJChETPSewA", "user_id": "qwwm1RH-B50FktJ0gzOe_Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/11/2017", "text": "This place came highly recommended to me as a great brew pub in Billings.
