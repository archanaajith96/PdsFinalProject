Service was quick, people were friendly, and WiFi was strong. There was a ton of artwork up, and the room we sat in had huge windows, false doors lining one of the walls, and the starry night painted on the ceiling. This coffeeshop is a hip(ster) and unique hole-in-the-wall - definitely come here if you get the chance :-)"}, {"review_id": "1Z5VV5rbwcrTelIy9i1KNA", "user_id": "yK4njGSBfFpZhDuTxNpnLg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Great little district which has character and ambiance. We drove through on our way past Knoxville and enjoyed americanos and a few pastries. Not a fan of the double-cupping practice but the coffee itself was well done. Blueberry loaf was bland but the goat cheese scone was pretty delicious.

The coffee is really good, serving a very palatable flavor profile that's not too acidic or over-roasted...it's simple and delicious.  As mentioned, I enjoyed quite a few drinks here over the course of a couple of days - as well as another nearby spot.  It's worth the walk to old city....lovely spot!"}, {"review_id": "PtvDe_Dfk51j9TXokPYQ3Q", "user_id": "uqefEeQoi9GQL1cwkS4QNQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "My breve latte was super delicious.

The staff is passionate about their product, and have never had a cuppa joe here that I didn't like. A few of my favorites are the cold brew drip coffee and their masala chai latte with extra foam.Parking can sometimes be a pain, but stopping here is worth a bit of extra work finding a space. The decor is boho-modern and inviting, and features rotating pieces of art from local folk. This is my go-to quiet place to unwind, read, or crank out some work on my laptop while enjoying some sweet sips."}, {"review_id": "wX1xm-wCit3ullpIAMepwQ", "user_id": "h5viH3TdqkGF3tHxyAjVSQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/29/2017", "text": "Historic downtown Knox has some hidden gems!

It's very small and you could tell the locals like their little secret spots as there were several people posted up at the table working. We were greeted right away and made an ordered at the table. We were just planning to get coffee and keep walking around but I was so disappointed after paying that I didn't see the array of fresh homemade pastries!!! They were mouth watering - it was a great variety of croissants, tarts, cake, etc. I know any one of them would have gone great with my dirty chai tea latte - if you are headed here, be sure to save room for a pastry! The coffee is fantastic as well so if you have work to do - stay awhile.

Absolutely yes!Maybe I caught them on a bad day... maybe it was a new barista...But they do deserve another try from me!  I will update my thoughts after my 2nd visit...."}, {"review_id": "YJUZXJb3nkSWo1o6FTtd6A", "user_id": "j9Z1dcoZrwn8Ul9JTnjjug", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/19/2017", "text": "I came to Old City Java pretty late into 2016, but haven't came around to writing reviews until now. And I have to say, Old City Java stands out in my mind as it indeed had an interesting atmosphere. I believe there were exams coming up and well, this place is a place to study. It seemed that every single table was taken up by a student, or those who just wanted to escape in reading while sipping on some coffee or some beverage.I enjoyed my visit here and definitely will come back if the need of coffee and walking around old city is the activity for the day! I would definitely recommend you to come here to check it out.

I love that it's right on the coolest streets in town. I love the awesome latte art. But I don't know what I'm doing wrong here. Every time I stop in the coffee is just so-so. Something is always off. On a recent visit, I don't know what happened but when I took a sip it was like I choked on a mouthful of foam. I'm talking like Old Yeller syle there was so much foaming that my drink seemed really really imbalanced. Okay. So let's just give it some time to sit for a while, right? So I let it breathe. I'm talking like 2 hours. But I didn't see improvement. So I didn't finish my drink. But I didn't want to just throw it out. So instead I actually left it on the kitchen counter overnight like a lazy person and said fuhhgeddaboudit. The next day I was barely awake to realize what I was sipping for morning coffee. And you know what? Despite rabid fears It tasted great. Amazing. All the flavor was there like 12 hours later."}, {"review_id": "qpNM_3c36-V24eMxJJDTNw", "user_id": "hUDEUz8PddhVTShshwQWWQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/21/2016", "text": "I love the little alleyway seating area.
