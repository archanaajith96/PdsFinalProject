My boyfriend and I put our name down around 7pm on a Friday and got seated around 8pm (not too bad considering you're allowed to leave the restaurant and they simply text you once your table is ready).We shared a bottle of delicious white wine and ordered the ricotta appetizer to share-it was fabulous! We then ordered two pie for dinner;burrata and mushroom. They were out of this world. Thin crust and crispy, which is my personal favorite, and the ingredients all seemed very fresh. Every pizza on the menu looked amazing so it was very hard to pick, but we were happy with our selection! Didn't get dessert but can imagine it's great. Will definitely be back in the near future! So glad we finally tried this place"}, {"review_id": "C0bw74f8wT5n7WgePpmJvg", "user_id": "_ln0oPOJvxNE6MZJdm3r8g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Razza is good, Very good.

But everything is delicious, that's for sure!We arrived promptly at 5:25pm on a Friday, just before the doors opened at 5:30pm and there was already a wait! We were one of the last groups who made it into the restaurant and didn't have to wait - thank goodness. No reservations, tiny place.We started with the Burrata and Prosciutto with Rutgers hazelnuts, and that did knock my socks off. All of the ingredients were so fresh, and the hazelnuts were a nice twist.The Kale Caesar was good, not amazing, but also fresh and highly enjoyable. The DiNatale pizza was AWESOME! Such a unique combination of ingredients that I never would have thought would be good together, like tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, olives, pine nuts, raisins and garlic, basil and chili oil. It was delicious. And the pizza dough was perfectly thin, but had a fluffy crust.Definitely a must try in Jersey City, and we'll be back to try some different offerings - but will try to come during off times so we don't have to wait in a crazy long line for a local neighborhood pizza spot!"}, {"review_id": "hsv9uLUUbx6RhIVCvR1Nvw", "user_id": "vZoCJDwUrI7LfcBHPl9r5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Moved to Jersey City in Feb 2018 and this is my favorite place I've eaten at by a long shot.

It is mainly about the crust here, which is among the best I've ever had, but the cheese and toppings were also so fresh and so good.It was only two of us, but we went all in. We got the bread & butter, meatballs, and three pies: burrata, pepperoni, and the Project Hazelnut. The bread & butter were fantastic, every bit as great as they look in pictures. We were more conflicted on the meatballs, but I really liked them, especially the semi-burnt edges. That said, I'd also love to try the salads or meat & cheese appetizers, so those might be subbed in next trip.The pizzas were all outstanding, largely based on fresh toppings and a truly incredible crust. Our favorite was the pepperoni, followed by the burrata. We liked the hazelnut, but would probably skip it next time. If we had any feedback, it was that the flavors were pretty understated on all three. For example, the burrata would have been basically a perfect pie (for me, anyway) if the tomato sauce jumped more. It was a great sauce (sweet and fresh, just how I love it), but it got a little lost. Same with the honey on the hazelnut, which was very faint and only apparent on certain bites.That said, these were still fantastic, and we'll definitely be back. And we're clearly not alone, because we got there at 5:45 on a Saturday (fifteen minutes after open) and still had to wait an hour and a half."}, {"review_id": "hy2YRCL-XF1ClRd9qHQPNg", "user_id": "Hq2TWfWXX18JODZj3P1JzQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "When they told us the wait would be two hours, I almost gave up, but my friends convinced me that we should wait it out. We went to a tapas bar nearby and did our apps there. Two hours later, we were devouring the best thin crust I've had in ages. We ordered the Pork Pie pizza and the Bufala mozzarella pizza. Both were incredible. The Pork Pie was unique and so savory, with a pork broth base. The Bufala was like your classic tomato basil, mozzarella pizza, yet not boring at all; perfectly baked. I couldn't get enough of Razza's super thin but amazingly crisp slices. Our last slice of pizza was just as crisp as the first. None of the sauce and toppings soaked through at all over the course of our meal.The pannacotta with salted caramel was decadent and executed perfectly. Highly recommend. Would definitely try to get there before 6 pm if you want to wait less than two hours. Or just get drinks and appetizers somewhere else like we did - there are a ton of restaurants along Grove St that you can pop into."}, {"review_id": "lX0GkBJrnIpLeSm19FMNrQ", "user_id": "nG7RATWL7qvHw7Kh8uiWRA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Alright Razza, I see you.

So good ugh now I'm craving it again!  We had gotten a bunch of margherita pies, a couple with garlic and shaved onions, some mushroom pies, and a pepperoni--all were amazing!  They also have a great chili oil u should request if you need something to dip the crust in, it's not crazy spicy but definitely flavorful.Now for the 3 stars (maybe even below), the cons:-they don't take reservations -they definitely do not accommodate large parties, we got there at 545, and was told it would be a 2 hour wait at minimum for a party of 16.-they said we couldn't do take out, but then accepted a take out order for someone right after us.  Now that left a really bad/sad feeling--we are minorities and the person who they accepted was clearly not--so just made us wonder why we couldn't just get our pies to go?  Idk--we were excited to try this place so we sucked it up and waited the 2 hours. But won't lie, we did slightly feel u wanted at this point but our need and craving for pizza told us to just suck it up.Overall consensus from our party of 16 pizza lovers was 5 stars for food, but otherwise not too many stars.  It's a small establishment, supply and demand at its finest I guess?  Either way I'll return, maybe with 1/4 of the party next time :)"}, {"review_id": "giiyYKzSzUc394j83El5NA", "user_id": "J5X4qXkoR02gCGwrwx67mg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Great pizza or the greatest pizza?

I had been to Razza before during the height of the NYT hype, and wanted to take my friend who was in town on business and loves good pizza.The place was packed, even for a later dinner on a Tuesday night (around 8:30). However, we were seated at the bar right away. We ordered bread and butter (yes, you do have to pay for bread & butter) as an appetizer and two pies, margherita and a special white pie with garlic and broccoli rabe. The bread came out fairly quickly and was warm, balanced, and the butter was soft and easily spreadable (I believe it came from a local farm, but I could be wrong about this). After a while, my friend and I began to notice that we still hadn't been served our pizzas. When a waitress/bartender came back to us, she asked if we wanted dessert. We told her our situation, and she was mortified, but rectified things in a timely manner, since we were served fairly quickly after we brought this up.The margherita is your classic Neapolitan pie, with tangy sauce and a decent amount of cheese with a touch of basil. Nothing too fancy or over the top, but (gasp!) not all that different from any other pizzeria that goes Neapolitan.The white pie, however, I hope to find in heaven. The pie was cheesy without being greasy, and the carmelized garlic and broccoli rabe brought strong flavor. The real elevator, however, was a small lemon wedge that I originally thought was garnish. However, once my friend and I used the lemon on the pie, we noticed how well the acidity of the lemon cut the bitterness of the broccoli rabe while retaining the cheesiness. Amazing!Overall, I can recommend Razza as a whole, as you won't get a bad meal even with spotty service. However, would I declare it the best pizza in New York (or even Jersey)?

Their pizza is really good.But before I get to the review of the food, make sure to arrive between 5-6:30  if you'd like to wait less than an hour. We went last night at 6:30 pm and we were quoted a 1 hr 15 min wait, so we went down the street to a cafe. 20-30 min later we received a text letting us know we had 5 minutes to return to be seated at our table. We ordered the meatballs, pepperoni pizza, and Natale pizza. The meatballs and sauce are seriously the perfect appetizer. The meatballs are so savory and have some chunks of their sourdough inside, so every once in a while you get a different texture. They're cooked in their tomato sauce which gets so rich from the beef fat. My tip, eat as many of the meatballs as you want but save the sauce to dip your pizza crust in. The pepperoni pizza is made with high quality pepperoni that curls up and looks very cute. The natale's toppings also work in perfect harmony! Who knew golden raisins and black olives balance each other out?The cheese is delicious, the crust is to die for. Seriously, they take their crust seriously.

I did not try the mixed drinks, but when we return I definitely will want to try. As for the pizza it was delish! The thin crust was so crispy and really made it great. Taking a risk, I got the Di Natale which had mozzarella, tomato sauce, pine nuts, raisins and olives. I wasn't sure how it was going to be with the raisins on it, but it was so complementary with the salty olives. My boyfriend got the pepperoni pizza and it looked really good too. They had the good pepperoni slices that crisp up in the oven. He really enjoyed it. Our waiter was so nice and attentive to us. They didn't clear off the table until we were both done, which I really pay attention to.

After being quoted some absurd 2 hour wait times in the week between Christmas and New Year's, we successfully returned the following week for some amazing pizza. We started with the bread and butter. That butter is everything butter should be - rich, creamy, and subtly salty. The bread was served warm meaning the butter melted perfectly into the thick dough. The bread was thickly cut and decent but a few pieces had burnt crusts which left a lingering bad taste on a couple of bites. For pizza, we went a little crazy and got 3: panna, cavolini, and project hazelnut. The panna is a solid rift on the classic cheese pizza by adding panna which is similar to heavy cream but used for savory dishes in Italy. The sauce was nice and tangy but honestly I could probably do without the mountain of arugula on top and replace it with some fresh basil to let the basic pizza flavors shine. The cavolini was my sister's favorite. It's a white pizza with Brussels sprouts and anchovies and is served with lemon which we used to lightly spritz the pizza. It's a very rich pizza and the anchovy delivers a light umami flavor while the lemon acts as a tangy compliment. I would even welcome more anchovy to really up the complexity of the pizza. Finally, the project hazelnut was delivered last as a \"sweet\" finish to our death by carbs feast. Deeeelicious. The crunchy hazelnuts and sweet honey all came together to form a wonderful bite. I was interested to see how hot honey would work on this pizza to give it a little kick so I added some to my leftover pizza at home and it was on point. I do think Razza needs reassess some of their policies in light of their popularity. Would it really be that much of a hassle to implement a texting service so people can put their names down and leave?Oh yes, and my sister still maintains Razza has the best crust she has ever tasted!"}, {"review_id": "B8h99n9F29FZ-j2UPY4x-w", "user_id": "p7OZx3RIeJPxSM4hP6wqEA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/28/2017", "text": "There are plenty of pizza options in NYC and NJ - so when the NY Times decides to hone in on one, say it's the best, AND mention so boldly that Jersey pizza may be better than the pies of NYC...there's no PATH delay in the world that's going to keep me from trying it. Though Razza has been around for a few years, their newfound fanfare has resulted in weekday wait times that top 60 minutes. With a no reservation policy, I fully expected this. Our 60 minutes was spent just down the street, sipping on a few local craft NJ beers. Perfect way to spend an hour. Theme of the night? ALL Jersey.We ended up getting seats at the bar, which was perfect. The bartender was great, and Dan (owner) was always around, serving people various parts of their meal, checking in, saying hi.Our only challenge was narrowing down what we wanted to get - everything sounded great.

Given the quality of the bread, I knew the pizza was going to be fantastic.Pizza - we got the Garden State Margherita and Pepperoni, so good that they deserve to be capitalized. The GSM was my favorite; I like simple flavors you can really taste, and this did not disappoint. Usually pepperoni pizza is too oily (for me), but this wasn't the case at all - the meat circles were small, and were much more crispy than oily. Crust? Perfectly charred and chewy. So many burned spots. So much flavor. There will be a line, you will eat amazing food, and there is a chance, if you come late enough...they might actually run out of dough.
