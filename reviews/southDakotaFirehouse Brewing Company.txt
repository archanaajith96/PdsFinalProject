If you've been driving no doubt you've seen the ads for it. I enjoy eating here. Personally I'm a pretty big fan of the Reuben. The service is prompt and I, while I don't drink, coming from Colorado I appreciate the brewery vibe. I would definitely recommend this place, especially if you are a tourist.

It was raked off the bone with a big ass fork.  The best part of the sandwich was the cole slaw.  I tried to cover it up w/ the classic and the sweet BBQ sauce.  The sauce had been refrigerated, which was kinda gross to me....I like it room temperature.  Maybe it was just gross...this Kansas City boy thinks he knows what good BBQ is...and this wasn't it.  Oh, I almost forgot...the green beans were really good...they had been marinated in some bacon.  My colleagues had chicken fried steak, and a half roasted chicken.  The chicken fried steak looked and smelled better than my sandwich.  She said it was good, and was just good home cooking.  Meanwhile, my other colleague was tearing into his half roasted chicken as if he hadn't had lunch.  It was well seasoned and he kept saying it was \"so moist.\"  I told him to stop saying moist.  He said it three more times.  I was jealous of his stupid moist chicken.  My pork sucked in case I wasn't clear.  Recommendation: #hardpass unless you just want a beer."}, {"review_id": "VVhPxqjRGwaFyvdwYcWSxg", "user_id": "RsJYpQWFkLm95fymxv9JSA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Not much to do in SD, stopped by this place.

The BBQ plate I had could have had more meat but was good. The meats where a little dry but not enough to not like it. My wife had the bison burger which she enjoyed. We sat outside in the patio near one of the fireplaces.The reason for the 3 stars is due to the stinginess of our server Toby in bring me 2 small samples of their craft beers. I asked to try 3 but he said they can only do 2. For an establishment that creates their own beer? Why be stingy? It only helps your customers in order more beer based on samples provided. The area's main line of business is tourist and they must learn to adapt to the needs of the people who bring that business."}, {"review_id": "2ISEKjZ1eyr2ruuWSbhXug", "user_id": "NHJy7cscqzo4acH0gzGgag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "My husband had the beer flight and liked all of the beers.  He saw the place was highly rated for beer online.  We had andouille sausage and that was excellent with the mustard bbq sauce.I'd come back to this place again and I'd recommend it to anyone who is in the mood for American food with great beer."}, {"review_id": "UnJ3FazmWR55w9Fcy29Zcg", "user_id": "9Mc1RUeHNiqCktWXArVbYA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Here in rapid city for company training the locals told me this place was good for food and drinks.

Yeah-any places that advertises a hundred miles out on I90 and repeatedly is that. But that being said their burgers were good and made to order (medium rare). When they got to the table the sandwiches were not hot though. It's a weekday and not terribly busy and our server was rather good. Their in house brews are nothing to rave about but not terrible. Their advertising as South Dakota's oldest brewery while true is a bit laughable. At 1991, I have ties older than that. But the decor is fun and the food tasted better than expected."}, {"review_id": "2dkgxv2WGWRuCi50T4tIDw", "user_id": "UJrNHBIT4C_ItUTEHd4-Gg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/25/2017", "text": "Touted as SD's oldest operating brewery I decided to visit and taste a bit of history. Ordered the brisket entree and was extremely disappointed. The meal came with two sides--I selected mashers (mashed potatoes) and green beans (served with bits of bacon). The brisket was plentiful, but the meat was semi dry (except for the fatty bits and ends). Most of the meat was air temp, the fatty parts were much warmer. The meat had zero flavor alone, perhaps that's why there are about 5 house-made BBQ sauces available? The mashed potatoes were creamy and dense, but flavorless too. The string beans were bright and balanced, seemingly \"fresh\" and the bacon pieces were succulent. The beans were the best option on the plate.The meat and sides were served on a platter on top of red/white paper. As soon as I cut into the meat, which was placed on a toasted sourdough I think, the paper was shredded along with it. So it's easy for you to accidentally eat paper, which I almost did.Tried a rye beer just for the heck of it. The color reminded me of a reddish ipa, but tasted light or watery, which sometimes happens with beer form tap. It was made in house and it was flavorful, semi-bitter (79 IBU).My server visited twice--at the beginning and end of the meal. However it was a busy evening, with free summer concerts outside in the downtown square, which could've increased customer flow.If I'm ever back in town I'll head elsewhere. Or maybe I'll visit their winery on the same block."}, {"review_id": "WIWfdod-swSocUBNHDV40Q", "user_id": "lgNM7aQ2LMGlCZVxSTLYHg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/15/2017", "text": "Great option for the family in downtown Rapid City. Fun, outdoor seating, super friendly & attentive service and good food & beer options!  We were not disappointed after seeing several of their signs and real fire trucks on I90 heading west.I love gumbo and I make my own (hourS long process) so I was hesitant to order the Firehouse version that our server highly recommended. I was not disappointed, it was full of shrimp, sausage, clams and chicken on top of rice.  It had a good heat and flavor you expect from a good gumbo.  I also got the Firehouse Red Ale which was a great way to wash down the gumbo :)  We also got the bison burger which was decent but not the best we had in SD.  The kiddies got the usual of grilled cheese & buttered noodles.Sure the Firehouse is a touristy spot, but hey we were tourists in Rapid City.  The family had fun, everyone liked the food-good times for sure!"}, {"review_id": "OFVp27sCV5lApd5E5IshEA", "user_id": "M8KmAOsHDQ0SWn5Yoc8w_A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/6/2017", "text": "This was a dinner stop on our road trip (Chicago-Portland) Well... it's not the best food i've had, but it's pretty good for a brewery !

The Pear Cider was fairly flavorless though, so I can't say I'd recommend that one. Food was fairly standard bar fare and was served hot. Ribs were a bit dry, but the burger was great!

I even had the pleasure of sitting in the old engine bay that was open to the street. Very nice setting and very nice idea. If the Firehouse was simply a brewery with a taproom, that would be amazing. Unfortunately, the food they offered was poorly conceived and partially inedible. My sandwich tasted like a soggy, over-processed jumble, while one of my colleagues was treated with still frozen chicken wings. I can't in good conscience recommend the Firehouse for dinner.

Not so at this place.  Here you can get a flight of the first 5 on the menu or all 9.  That works if you like every type of brew in the first 5 but not if you don't.  In our case 3 out of 5 is not good enough, so we skipped it. Having to order 2 out of 5 brews of a type we know we don't like so we may have the privilege of trying the other 3 because of the rigidity of their internal rule does not make for a satisfying experience.Their beer cheese soup has a meat broth stock so we skipped it. There were a couple of vegetarian options such as a black bean burger and of course the perennial salad. Ultimately we got an order of beer bread with our \"shake\".The bread was tasty.  The shake made with beer wort was rather non-descript, like a vanilla shake with a weakly favored swirll drizzled on the interior of the glass before the shake was dispensed or poured in.  Our waitress even tried adding some Porter to it which helped but the old favorite was not to be found.The Firehouse Brewery was a novelty when it opened.  Now there are multiple microbreweries in the area. We're less inclined to return.  If they weren't so stupid about restricting how customers can order a flight of brews we'd consider revisiting them even with a paltry selection vegetarian options on the menu. Under present circumstances nothing there is particularly welcoming to us and there are other places in the area which are."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/firehouse-brewing-company-rapid-city?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
