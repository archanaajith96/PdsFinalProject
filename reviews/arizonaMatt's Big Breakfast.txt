First stop on our road trip!It was quite busy for a Friday morning at like 9am (don't people have work?!) but we were seated within 10 minutes. I ended up ordering the cheese omelet and added bacon. This also came with toast on the side, of which I ordered wheat. Yeah ok, this was literally a big breakfast. My plate was FULL with home fries (seasoned with rosemary yum) and my omelette took up more than half the plate. The pieces of toast were massive, yet the perfect level of toasted. Not crispy, nor soft. Perfection. Everything was delicious. I left feeling satisfied and full. Also, our server was super friendly, and was on top of refilling our coffees, as we were all suffering from sleep deprivation."}, {"review_id": "L4IGHMJ5UNRiU0YNsOgM5A", "user_id": "DPitNu466172os6m0Yri1Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Matts has one of the best breakfast menus in town and has for many years now.  The original location is by far the best one.  Nothing is really fancy or special but the food is always delicious.  Almost everything is made from scratch and locally sourced.  What is so unbelievable is that there are so many bad breakfast joints out there and all he is doing is fresh, local, and simple food.  Seriously how can nobody do this right out there?My favorite is the egg benedict but it is only done on Wednesdays.  Pretty much everything on the menu is good but a few of my favorites are the waffle with the perfect mix, salty, savory, fresh, crisp yet fluffy.  Perfection.  Another favorite is the salami scramble.  Schreiner's sausage, eggs, onions, and cheese.  Always solid.  And another one that is really good is the 5 spot which is worth the six bucks.  A huge breakfast sandwich that tastes as good as it looks.Everything else is just done right: thick crispy peppery bacon, thick sliced bread with homemade jam, fresh squeezed oj, homemade honey lemonade.  You really can't go wrong with anything.The only thing that keeps me from giving them 5 stars is the service has always been hit or miss.  The first time I went many years ago the waitress was so rude I almost never came back.  The last few times we have been we have had to not only wait for our food but weren't offered refills on our drinks, weren't offered condiments, we finally went to other tables to get them, the food took forever, and the waitresses never bothered to check on us.  Understand-idly this place is packed and always has a line but refills, check ups, and condiments are very basic levels of service and should be part of any dine in experience regardless.  Part of the problem is the waiters don't have assigned tables.  The other part is they need to be trained better.  That aside Matts is still the best breakfast in town rivaled by none."}, {"review_id": "0lCn7i69G4OcDBX9ysSGBg", "user_id": "5dqdqRSVSphX07JX3cXdOg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "My sister, a family friend, and I visited Matt's Big Breakfast this afternoon at lunchtime and had a great meal. She opted for a simple eggs and sausage breakfast plate, he had the daily special (a scramble with chicken sausage, potatoes and cheese) and I had the salami scramble. My sister enjoyed her food and she even ate some of the sourdough toast which is a huge deal because she rarely eats bread. It's THAT good! My meal was delicious: the hash browns were crunchy, there was a hefty amount of salami in the scramble, and I, too, enjoyed the toast and House-made strawberry jam that accompanies it. However, I took away a star because the service wasn't great. Having worked in the food service industry in the past, I know how hard it can be during a lunch rush, and I tried to be understanding.

A lot of reviewers mention friendly staff but we didn't get that warm, happy and welcoming vibe.

Both sounded promising, but maybe because we aren't breakfast people that it didn't really strike me as anything special.Overall, my breakfast plate was just mediocre throughout. The bacon was bacon, the eggs were eggs, and the hash browns were just hash browns. You get the idea.My girlfriend's home fries were good, but someone went HAM on the rosemary. I love rosemary. I use it when I sous-vide my ribeyes, or if I'm reverse searing some ribeyes with butter, but this was just too much. It was overpowering and I couldn't enjoy the potatoes themselves. It tasted like I just ate a sprig of rosemary.Service was good though and the prices were reasonable.

What can I say about Matt's that hasn't already been said? Generous portions, fresh ingredients, seriously amazing toast. I never thought the day would come when I'd rave about toast, but Matt's thick-cut toasted wheat toast with homemade blueberry compote is what I crave when I think about homey brunch food now. This downtown location has a small parking lot of its own. The inside is decently sized, but lines are out the door for lunchtime and brunch most days, weekdays included. Service is mediocre, not the most attentive because it's always bustling in here, and there have been a few times where I've needed to aggressively flag down a server to ask for coffee refills or to-go boxes. Matt's has a small menu, but there are specials for each day of the week. The menu items stay consistent, and the daily specials are written up on a huge chalkboard at the back of the restaurant. Drinks:Coffee is decent and comes with bottomless refills. The strawberry lemonade and honey lemonade are both really good and not too sweet, although they come with quite a lot of ice. The Hog and Chick:Standard breakfast fare, this comes with two eggs, choice of meat, choice of hash browns or home fries, and a slice of thick-cut toast. The hash browns are made well, and I like the crunchy exterior and soft interior. I did notice that the first time I came, the hash browns were made perfectly and the second time they were slightly mushy in the center. Still good though. I tried the sausage links, and I don't know that I'd order them again.. maybe I'll opt for the ham next time. Eggs were well-cooked with a nice runny center.Salami scramble:This comes with scrambled eggs and salami (additional toppings for extra charge), hash browns or homefries, and toast. I really like the homefries because they come with sprigs of roasted rosemary, which are incredibly flavorful. I've found the homefries to be consistent and delicious, especially with the house made thick ketchup. One thing that did disappoint me a bit was that the scramble was undercooked. When I got to the middle, the egg was still oozy and watery, which left an unappetizing puddle on the plate. I'd gotten a different scramble before where this didn't happen, but I think the chef probably just underestimated the cook time by a minute. Cheese omelet:This omelet was so cheesyyyy. I thought the flavor was really good, and I really recommend adding in toppings (for an extra charge) because it really helps balance out the cheesiness and richness. I did find the inside a tad runny again, but it wasn't super noticeable with the cheese mixing in. This dish again comes with choice of potatoes and toast. Toast:The toast here is so good it deserves its own mention. The thick-cut toast comes out sliced in half and smeared with butter. One of the servers said that they use an old-fashioned toaster (which must be magical), and the slice comes out perfectly crunchy on the outside but still soft and fluffy on the inside. The blueberry compote is made with fresh blueberries and sugar, and it always tastes fresh and not too sweet. I haven't always finished my meals here, but I've always finished the toast. I'll be back to Matt's for its convenient location and comforting breakfast food, and of course the toast."}, {"review_id": "Lkt8BshgsskjTpgZLJUT5g", "user_id": "RVagGrcHdy1HB7-_c9ywZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "I visited Phoenix for the first time a couple months ago because my friend moved out west. Being a big Diners, Drive In's, and Dives fan, I decided I need to try a couple spots since Guy almost always ends up in Phoenix or Bakersfield, CA every episode. I specifically remembered on the plane the episode with Matt's Big Breakfast...it's amazing what you remember, considering that episode first aired 5+ years ago.For the daytime portion of my trip, I was alone to discover what Phoenix has to offer as my friend had to work. I'm completely fine with that, and the morning after my arrival I set my off to find Matt. I was pleasantly surprised to find it was only about a 20 minute walk from my hotel, which was perfect considering the weather was 60 with a slight wind. (I didn't know Phoenix had wind!?)I arrived shortly after 10am to a filled restaurant. Luckily I was by myself so the hostess was able to seat me almost immediately at the bar. I had decided on the Skinny, but the scramble of the day was almost the same but with a different sausage. I decided to go with the daily special and waited only 10 minutes tops for my food. I was surprised by their ability to get food out to me; perhaps their motto of serving simple food makes it easier to serve food fast? Whatever the case, I was very impressed. The scramble, along with the accompanied potatoes and sourdough, were hot and delicious. The scramble was flavorful without being too cheesy, and everything was seasoned perfectly. I didn't add salt or pepper to my meal, and it's very rare that I don't. They live up to the name of Matt's Big Breakfast - for some reason I took my leftovers home even though I had no intention of eating them.  (Not because they weren't delicious, but I was only there for 4 days! I had many places to eat at!)

Just the waffle alone takes up a whole dinner plate, and their omelets are to die for. Literally the first bite always brings a tear to my eye. I always go for the ham, red pepper, and American cheese which just oozes cheese and its innerds with each bite. Their bacon is also soo good, thick cut and well seasoned. They sautee their onions in some delicious oil that I have yet to place but always tastes fantastic. And their lemonade is the perfect mix of sweet and tart, and made fresh daily with real cane sugar and comes with fruit options as well. And each breakfast comes with your choice of bread (sourdough, wheat, white, and occasionally other options) and a side of freshly made jam of the day which is always incredible. I go for their sourdough which is always wonderful but their wheat is just as good.The only thing I have found lacking is the hash browns, some days they are great but more often than not the bottom half is under cooked and soggy, get the home fries which come with sauteed onions and a sprinkling of fresh rosemary (they are sooo good).Its family owned and Matt (the owner) gets all of his ingedients fresh from the local farmer's market. It wasnt uncommon in the past to see him helping out tables at the old restaurant but now with the new locations, he's more busy making sure each location is as good as the original.Parking can be a bit difficult but their is an ally that connects the new restaurant with the old which allows more parking. And their is often a wait if you come before noon, but trust me it is well worth the wait. This is by far the best breakfast joint in town.I would recommend this place to anyone, whether you just picked up friends or reletives from the airport or if you're just looking for a good hearty breakfast. It can get loud and it is a bit longer wait for large groups (come after 1pm and you won't have a problem) but everyone will thank you for the amazing meal. I seriously suggest this place to everyone I know and everyone says its the best. Whether you stumble in after a long night drinking (they open at 6am and the food is just as good then) or if you're grabbing a bite before starting your day everything here is incredible. And hey now there's an airport location with a full bar, which I've heard has the best bloody Mary's. The other locations definitely don't match up with the original though so try the place where it all started first."}, {"review_id": "9bdN0TL-pfAEJJIFvHgmZw", "user_id": "cV4vk6_6EOxzJnwxVFrP6g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Because of the famous Triple D, we had to make an appearance.
