I've never had a bad meal here and the staff here is great. One of my favorite appetizers to share is the ahi noshos. It is literally a mountain of tuna, wonton chips, cucumber, rice, seaweed with a spicy mayo and unagi glaze. The flavors and textures all mixed together is phenomenal. I ordered the gnocchi dish during my most recent visit. The braised beef short rib and wild mushroom gnocchi are the perfect combination along with the cotija. Always make sure you have room for dessert. The chocolate tower torte is heavenly. The slice is ginormous and enough to share with several others. Nosh changes their menu every so often so there's always a reason to come back. I'm glad they always keep fan favorites such as the ahi noshos and the chocolate tower torte. Some dishes will have names of non profits by them. Nosh gives a portion of the profits of that dish to the organization. I'm eating and giving back at the same time, sweet! I highly recommend Nosh to everyone. You should make a reservation."}, {"review_id": "PLYLCxmQvfq69b7R_UU1Jw", "user_id": "vNaqYkTDhB8tk3drn0m0IA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Service is exceptional. Food was great.

But we were just there recently for our anniversary.We got talking about the owls house desserts and talked about where they came from and that was a place called Scratch Bakery. So I googled Scratch Bakery it was looking at the building and I noticed there was what appeared to be a restaurant in the picture nextdoor called Nosh.So we looked up the menu and found that they were vegan friendly and decided I would change my Valentine Day's reservations from The Owl House to Nosh. We decided to make the dinner plans for Saturday night being it was more traditional.We went there and the parking was very plentiful and we walked in and it appeared a bit noisy no actually it was very noisy. LOL so I was getting a slight bit concerned and looking around the tables seem to be more like industrial picnic tables.I started to wonder if I made a mistake and thought I don't even know if we're going to be able to hear each other talk?Well the waitress seated us very quickly into a back area of the restaurant where the table was slightly large to sit across from each other to be able to talk but it was rustically nice.Our waitress Abby was wonderful. I explained to her that my fiance was a vegan and we saw it on their website but didn't see a menu in the restaurant. She said she would get one immediately. She did and there were many choices for her to enjoy.I asked Abby for just a house salad and they didn't really have one on their menu yet,  but they made one up for me. It was just lettuce onion cucumber and a yogurt ranch dressing with chipotle and I got to tell you, I thought I was going to lick the plate clean. LOL it was one of the most amazing salads I've ever had.My fiance ordered 3 steamed buns with fried tofu, shiitake mushrooms, Napa slaw and maple gochujang glaze. And for her taste she said they were unbelievably delicious. :-)And for her dinner she had Squash & Kalebutternut squash, red quinoa, heirloom kale, pepitas, pickled onion, first light chevre, and chili Maple vinaigrette.I had Filet Oscar which was 3 petite fillets, brown butter crab,  ancho hollandaise, asparagus, green chili and cheese mashed potatoes.I don't know what I was expecting, but I got to tell you it was the most amazing dinner I've had since the Brewster Inn in Cazenovia on New Year's... the chef here is about as amazing as they come and extremely creative and his presentation is beautiful and the food is beyond words. We definitely will be coming back here to try other things.I ordered a southern comfort and seven with a cherry and I noticed that there were two black olive looking things in my drink and I found out that they were black cherries and they were so much more classy than a regular maraschino cherry by far. Great touchThen it was time for dessert we had the fry dough nibs made with homemade dough, caramel apple butter and powdered sugar.They were warm and delicious treat to the end of the evening.So if you're looking to take your wife fiance or girlfriend to someplace that may not be quiet but the food is out of this world and believe me you get a lot of it so don't be fooled by the prices you will definitely get your fill.I would absolutely highly recommend this restaurant and the waitress Abby."}, {"review_id": "ok8a0J0DhEAvO10KpO67pQ", "user_id": "GUemWuYgugpFdpvJZSkHxg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Outstanding!  Every aspect of our meal was top notch. We just moved to the area and have heard so many people raving about nosh. The hype is real. For one, our waiter Eric was fantastic. He offered many great suggestions from cocktails to entrees and they were all wonderful. He was also extremely attentive and fun. We started with a few cocktails. I ordered Division St.(bourbon, orgeat, cinnamon and fig jam) and my wife ordered Mia Wallace (rum, blackberry, strawberry). Both were well balanced and flavorful. The Division was probably the best bourbon drink I've had. We ordered the ahi noshos for an appetizer. They were monstrous and loaded with delicious fresh ahi. They were packed with flavor!  For our entrees we ordered the Gangnam Style and Duck & Hash. The Gangnam was awesome. The salmon was tremendous and the various Korean accompaniments were fun and tasty. The duck breast was cooked perfectly and the hash was well seasoned. So far Nosh was the best restaurant we have visited in Rochester. Looking forward to stopping in again!"}, {"review_id": "gSsHar699GIS-AEYTojtkg", "user_id": "KR5Ma7JrkiqMO9_vLrU9sw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "I was very excited to finally have a chance to try Nosh and the experience didn't disappoint. The interior of the restaurant is very spacious with modern rustic decor. There is a pretty spacious bar area with the beautiful spiral staircase. Our waiter was really nice and service was efficient despite having a full restaurant.For apps we had the Korean sit down. This is definitely a dish where you get both quality and quantity. For $34 you get a good amount of kalbi (more than you'd get at a korean restaurant), chicken and pork belly. It also comes with a nice helping of white rice, korean side dishes like kimchi and pickled veggies, some steamed buns butter lettuce for you to wrap everything in. The kalbi was juicy and very nicely flavored, it's on par with something you'd get at a Korean restaurant. The chicken was a little dry in my opinion, and I didn't taste too much of the gochujang, but it was still pretty good. The pork belly was tender and has a lot of flavor. The kimchi was my favorite for the pickled sides. Stuff all of these things into a lettuce leaf or steamed bun, it was really really yummies! I was pretty much full after this app lol, and I came with a party of 3.For entree I had the major kay, a scallop dish with pork belly and a grain blend. The scallops were huge and cooked very well. They were tender and not chewy. The rice had a nice chewy texture, it was not too mushy. The dish overall was a bit too salty for my taste but I still loved it! I also sampled the veal short rib and lamb cavatelli. The veal short rib dish was a very large portion so if you're super hungry order this! Its flavors resemble a mexican dish with the beans and just how it is seasoned. The veal was not as tender as I had hoped. The pork though was pretty tender. This is a dish that tasted much better the next day in my opinion. The lamb cavatelli was also a generous portion. You get 4 pretty decent size lamb lollipops. The lamb was cooked well with pink middle and it didn't smell too much like most lamb dishes. After dinner we stopped by the bar for some dessert. We had the banana pudding and panna cotta. The banana pudding is presented in a jar with all of its components and omgogsh it was beautiful. The banana flavor is present and when mixed with the crumbles and all of the goodness stuffed into this jar, it's heaven in your mouth. The crumbles give the dish a nice textural contrast. This is a must have. For the panna cotta, even though it's not the best I've ever had, it is pretty close to it! It's soft and creamy and just delightful to have with a dessert drink! Overall I really enjoyed my dinner at Nosh. I cannot wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "HxFR-lkWMSBTFGwkrW624Q", "user_id": "hPuQIudnLHBJaJL7swpB8A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "Holy bananas I've been here, and then I've been here again, and then some more, YELP had to have lost my review.  Or I never wrote a review.

Nosh has such an incredible atmosphere. It felt like I was in a huge city at such a beautiful restaurant. There's plenty of space for parking (which isn't true for many restaurants in Rochester), and the vibe was incredible on a Friday evening. There weren't too many people, but we made a reservation anyways so we were seated very quickly. The staff was warm and friendly and service was fantastic. I got a vegetarian menu which I wasn't expecting - they have an incredible list of options for vegetarian folks! The food was creative and tasty, though I will say that in my opinion it was a little more expensive than what I think it was worth, but again this is a place I'd be checking out once in a while, not every day. Their drinks were great, perhaps a tad bit on the weaker side -- again for the price that you're paying.

This really a neat place with unique food. The building has a very modern warehouse feel and and clearly a ton of detail went into their design. One downside to this open space is that it gets quite loud in the building. They have tried to install sound absorbing panels on the ceiling, but ultimately there's not much that can be done in a space like this. So, just know going in that it is a louder environment. Their drinks are a little sugary for my taste. Their food is not, and they some great unique dishes. I recommend the boar lasagna for dinner and the duck and waffles for brunch!"}, {"review_id": "uzqaw6dhxLKXSNm4VWRTfg", "user_id": "teZj5ApQCwbGFP_LtJFViA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "This review is solely based on the brunch menu. Nosh is perhaps one of the best brunch restaurants we have been to since moving to Rochester. This is clearly a direct consequence of the fact that the chefs have taken many liberties in creating really interesting breakfast items with an Asian-inspired twist. The best thing we have tried here is the Duck and Waffel. This is an interesting play on the already amazing chicken and waffle, where instead of a nice piece of fried chicken, Nosh serves up an amazing duck confit in an even more amazing sauce! I honestly think this may be the highlight of the entire menu. Also, the large windows and lighting make the restaurant feel really comforting. Drinks were good ( we especially enjoyed the Me Jane with candied bacon), service was great, and the food was better!"}, {"review_id": "RAcO6xOmaUDF4VIV9E3Aqg", "user_id": "GLjJP23cKxHYbfLh1zA1uA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/4/2017", "text": "I had been asking my boyfriend to take me here for dinner for awhile so we finally stopped in one Saturday night.

So definitely make a reservation!The next time I was in town, we finally got to go to dinner since we had a reservation this time. I really liked the atmosphere of this place. Very cool and trendy. And the food was delicious. We ordered the Ahi Noshos as a starter and they were excellent. The perfect amount to snack on before our meals arrived.

This place had been on my list of restaurants to try since they opened a year ago but I hadn't gotten around to it, but I finally visited for the first time for the Yelp Community Event this past week. The food we sampled was out of this world and I knew I had to come back immediately.My best friend and I came back tonight for dinner and we were not disappointed. The reservation was at 5 pm when they open for dinner and we were seated right away. Our servers were friendly and very accommodating. We started with the Ahi Noshos as an appetizer and we both agreed that they were quite possibly the best thing we had ever tasted. If you like sushi you MUST try them! It really does taste like a fresh, savory, and delicious sushi roll but with the satisfying crunch of the wonton chips. We ate them so quickly that I didn't even stop to take a photo!I ordered the Korean Sit Down as my entree. It's probably more appropriate as a plate to share, but gluttony is my middle name so I had no qualms about ordering it for myself. All of the flavors were authentic Korean and just so, so good. I especially liked the chicken and the cucumber salad. Every single bite made me so happy because it was packed with flavor.My friend ordered the Crab and Poblano Arancini and Shrimp Tostadas. I sampled the arancini and they were super rich and cheesy (aka amazing!). They were perfectly crunchy on the outside and the poblano lent a nice spicy kick. I didn't try the Shrimp Tostadas but my friend said they were also very good.I can't rave enough about Nosh! The servers were excellent; my water cup was never empty and they made sure to check in and make sure that everything was to our liking. The general manager also made it a point to come over to ask how our experience was. You can tell that everyone at Nosh truly cares about their customers. We had no complaints, but I'm sure even if something had gone awry the staff would have quickly made it right. Overall, just an amazing place with great food! This is by far my new favorite restaurant in Rochester."}, {"review_id": "YKb1wAGYX2BKaaUSW3Fe8g", "user_id": "V56ven0rPypaIW30HYzy6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "I'd heard of good things, but no words are enough to explain the experience of the food here. The (bahn mi) burger!! I love burgers and this one was seriously the BEST I've had. Cooked well to melt into my mouth with cilantro all over and the dressing!! It's messy, gooey and bloody finger licking (my friend shall attest) good!! The French fries have a garlic predominance which I am crazy about. My friend took a pollo loco which was really good too. We chose Why Nosh (tequila based) and Treaty to Paris (bourbon and rum) for cocktails. The Nosh was strongly tequila flavored. I usually love tequila once I've had enough of it and this cocktail was quick to give me that buzz. The Paris drink was more on the sweeter side (strange considering it is bourbon) but I tasted it after having had tequila. Loved both choices. Nosh is a little loud, but great ambiance. I'm glad we decided to take the tables near the bar rather than the dining table service. I look forward to coming back here. Soon. Need that burger pretty bad!!"}, {"review_id": "6Q5As94d2HIyUTYAJiBgig", "user_id": "MBPWz1k4UKHj9aTjokYFpA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "Love the food, and the vibe.
