They do not have a ready to serve drip coffee option. If you want standard coffee it is pour-over or French press, etc. or you can order an americano. This is not reallyA place to rush into for coffee to go. Awesome atmosphere, seating, and kid friendly. The upstairs loft area is a fun haven for kids. My almost 2-year old loved going up and down the stairs, sitting at the kids table, and looking through the books. The staff was super cool about her exploring (non-destructively and supervised). They bake their scones, cookies, etc. in-house and the savory scone my daughter and I shared was super tasty. They measure out the coffee and track temp. With the pour-overs to get a consistent brew each time. They have multiple beans to choose from, I chose the Burundi and it was excellent. Smooth and chocolatey, as advised by the barista. Definitely will come chill again. The attached art gallery is awesome too."}, {"review_id": "LZ2nfuj8iKsUzoVjhvPnRw", "user_id": "9-2DNzpdFfPpFzkdvGbd4Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/14/2017", "text": "Their sidewalk marquee drew us in: Nitro Cold Brew!!It was very delicious! Smooth, the right bite of flavor, and potent! Staff was lovely. Space is very mellow and open. About as hipster of a place as I've found in Billings, but not in a bad way.

They offer very select, high quality coffee. I loved the vibe. I also like that it's quiet and they have free WiFi. I had a muffin and it was really good. But seriously the coffee is delicious.

We loved that they served coffee is mason jars and did mason jars to go as well that you could bring back later. We really appreciated that they also had disposable cups for people like us who were traveling. I was surprised and delighted to see they do pour over coffee for what appears to be all their drinks. We had just a regular pour over coffee and a cafe au lait with vanilla. Both were amazing, and the fact that my drink wasn't overly sugary from the vanilla speaks volumes. The staff were friendly and kind, the space was open and relaxing, the artwork was fun browse at while we waited. Highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "NSLyhIbVXdTOLQ00f-LV5g", "user_id": "E6r16oyFVlZaLHcPiGEDvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2017", "text": "Truly excellent coffee and very friendly, super knowledgeable staff in a well lighted space with exposed brick and an industrial chic feel.

My college-aged kids turned us onto it; yes, I feel like I'm going to get carded sometimes for being too old to be there, but no, we are very welcomed there. The people are about as friendly, helpful, thoughtful, and knowledgeable as you'll ever find.So, yes, the service is amazing.My son is a major black coffee snob, and Ebon is his coffee holy land. The owners and baristas can tell you how the coffee is prepared, why, and how you might like it based on your preferences. This is a real \"coffee\" place.So, then there is my husband and I. We get our almond milk mochas in the charming Ball jars and enjoy it with the freaking amazing Sunday morning waffles (psst - they are gluten free, but don't tell anyone, because you would never know). Those waffles are magical. Each week there is a gourmet flavor or two - one time we had a savory basil and sun-dried tomato waffle, but usually we have some kind of berry waffle. When the candied bacon varieties come out, that's a real treat. The whipped cream on top is fresh and delicious. But, waffles are just for Sundays and available until they run out sometime before 2pm.They also serve toast (we get gluten free) with avocado spread across the top.Downtown Billings is lucky to have such amazing people and high quality coffee and food served with such care as is evidenced at Ebon."}, {"review_id": "duuto2Z5DgWl6ZcOzJlCsQ", "user_id": "x-OZjiL39oN7sf_VCw61wQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/12/2017", "text": "The place has a great vibe & the coffee is delish!

Not only is it open 'til 11pm while it seems every other place in town closes by 10p, but they have killer tea, coffee, and attitude. Super sweet cats, and even when you order to go, they give you a mason jar instead of disposable cups clothed in recycled fabric that shield your hands from the extreme hot or cold of your ordered drink. THAT is baller. I went there yesterday and am going back today. I suggest you only tea and/or coffee here. You'll thank me, them, and yourself for making the right decision."}, {"review_id": "VhybPQ7yy8ZlkELcf-39ng", "user_id": "1e-w2vF5a9f3kLr07eqHpw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2017", "text": "Ebon is the perfect addition to downtown.
