Their unique variety of breakfast offerings is impressive to say the least. I ordered the waffle rito which is basically a delicious egg scramble wrapped up in a waffle drenched in green Chile sauce and other deliciousness. It's got a cool open kitchen concept and they've got a pool table as well which I happen to appreciate very much!"}, {"review_id": "IFaT5nLFB0Qm9u8JURSoFA", "user_id": "N-LiaUBHiseYLzOH1-l29g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Had the Brussels and squash with balsamic glaze... healthy size portion split with my wonderful wife. It was fantastic! Never had squash prepared like this and wasn't sure I'd like them, but they were firm and yet melt in your mouth good. Will eat again!Also had spinach salad option which was equally great. Added shrimp only 4 for $4... a little few for the $ but we're nicely prepared."}, {"review_id": "pCPYmYC328WZFu3ZqoK5vA", "user_id": "m5IjjKl9hzR9r8yLUgKJ9Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Two words: BACON CANDY! I wish I took a picture of my Bloody Mary, but was so excited to taste it, I lost all sense of my foodie-esque behavior and didn't snap a shot!This place is strictly for adults, so it isn't kid-friendly, which I appreciate. I have 2 toddlers, so ADULT time is always welcomed in my book! It's automatic that I order the shrimp & grits if it's on any menu. Best word to describe it - different! Is it good, YES! Was I disappointed, NO! But I'm used to a more \"traditional\" style. The sauce was good, but maybe a tad too much where it was soupy. Sorry, but the one they serve @ Pacific Southern is still my favorite!Now back to the Bloody Mary... they have a spicy & regular version. I choose spicy - no brainer! Let me just say, I appreciate that it was actually spicy!! I've been to plenty of places where they say it is, and it fell short - not theirs!Would I come here again, ABSOLUTELY!"}, {"review_id": "beXJ_bWVL0LNVHqzcJkmoA", "user_id": "3NOPscX1iScblJX9sTI_tA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "We came here for brunch on a sunday expecting a wait but we were able to be seated right away.

Nay! None of the above. In fact, Dirty Oscar's is a lovely and entirely tasteful bar, neither dive-y nor \"pub\" like. It's clean and cozy and community-oriented, the service is friendly and efficient, and the food is quite good, with plenty of options for those of the non-meat eating persuasion. I managed to type that whole first paragraph without saying \"Parmesan tots,\" but now we're in this paragraph, which will be dedicated solely to Parmesan tots, by golly. Dirty Oscar's makes Parmesan tots. You should go there, and you should order them. The Parmesan tots are Heaven come down to Earth in the form of a fried dairy starch angel. The Parmesan tots are Sirens on a rocky perch amid a swirling sea of temptation, and your Diet Ship will inevitably crash and founder upon them. The Parmesan tots are the best thing since Ruth Bader Ginsburg was eating sliced bread while listening to Marvin Gaye. Parmesan tots. Parmesan tots. Parmesan Parmesan Parmesan. Tots tots tots.The other food we've tried is quite good too...they do some very good things with cauliflower...the seared curried cauliflower is outstanding, and vegan too for those of you who recoil at the thought of Parmesan tots (which I have already established that I do not). Speaking of Parmesan tots, I'd try the Parmesan tots if I were you. And they have good desserts too, including the vegan and gluten-free cookie with chocolate sorbet...we got that last time and added a scoop of basil-and-honey ice cream as well, and it was almost as good as a certain appetizer dish that is made with both Parmesan cheese and potatoes.Bonus: Rainier tall boys are $1.75 during the plentiful happy hours."}, {"review_id": "1o1F7meEK5Rcb4EZI3EF9Q", "user_id": "mZrZgqqz3CWKCWqosK5MPQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "Came here for a Friday breakfast/brunch! I think this place as awesome. As noted by our waiter it's \"the best breakfast in Tacoma\" and I totally believe it. The ambiance inside is a little bit of a grungy bar (21+ only, they do check ID even if you aren't ordering a drink).For breakfast here I got the 2 egg breakfast, which comes with 2 eggs, a meat of your choosing, hash browns and toast. Everything on my plate was cooked to perfection. This is probably the most boring breakfast they have on the menu. The rest of their menu is super unique with a lot of options. My boyfriend got the \"overload\" here which came with a biscuit, an egg, fried chicken, bacon and a bacon infused waffle. His meal was delicious!!! I think everything he had was great except his waffle had a little bit too much bacon flavor to it, but that's my own opinion. Also to note they serve Bluebeard coffee from the local roaster down the street here which is also really tasty. Overall this place is great! Ill definitely come back next time we're in Tacoma!"}, {"review_id": "CsCSaSNzZOL8__Uq9KvepQ", "user_id": "G9P3h7ZGdbdc_Zt6IKC2vQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "Chicken wings and sauces - I asked the waitress which way is better for wings (naked or breaded), and she suggested breaded so that's what I went with. It was like fried chicken - a little dry. The sauces were an interesting choice to dip the wings in - like a sweet bbq and an Asian zing sauce. Parmesan Tots - the sauce that we dip them in is off the hook! The tots themselves look like fatter, longer tater tots (hence the name).

It's has an old sports bar feel and is pretty nice and clean. We weren't feeling super hungry so we decided to order one burger and share amongst the 2 of us...THANK GOD because the portions are huge, which is great. The Stoner looked and probably is the best sandwich. A huge piece of fried chicken and Parmesan tots in a pretzel bun. Super tasty! We also ordered the sweet potato waffle fries but they tasted a little too oily and overly fried.

The Dirty Oscar burger was fantastic. I chose a salad as my side over fries, and for the first time I didn't regret it. The tomatoes were super tangy, like they marinated them in a spice. My husband was craving something meaty. He picked the reuben and said it was excellent. He ended up eating the rest with a fork on his plate cause it was spilling meat and sauerkraut.Service was great and nice, they had an awesome happy hour and the atmosphere was relaxing.

They had music going, the drinks were legit, a lot of people around the pool table... just a really cool place to hang out. Something strange must have happened however because about 10 minutes after they made last call, they were all but kicking us out! And not just us everybody in the bar. It wasn't even 2 a.m. yet it was just after 1 a.m. I felt really bad having to waste my alcohol.Funnily enough the next time I went there was the very next day for brunch with the same friends. Wendy told me you were going to the same place I wondered how that place could have brunch. But sure enough, the place looked different in the daytime. The decor was kind of dark for a brunch spot, but it worked! I ordered a biscuit and gravy with scrambled eggs.  It was alright, but I kind of wish I had ordered something else. One of my friends had the seafood scramble, and THAT was pretty good! Ended up having a double \"taste\" of his scramble.  The other friends seemed to enjoy their food was well, one having chicken and waffles, chicken biscuit sandwich and another, eggs Benedict. The chicken was nice and crisp, well seasoned. The third time I was there, it was on black Friday for a pub crawl, and it was actually pretty packed. Good atmosphere. I realized I would rather go there for a late night hangout/ drinks than for their food."}, {"review_id": "94WckKAz5-TRLWCQ29WLAQ", "user_id": "XO9ob-Jgz-JKuyGL22RlFA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Great little 6th Avenue spot for breakfast!

If you love yourself then you owe it to you to try the bacon candy. It's so good it should be a sin, I'm not convinced it isn't. The brussels are another item you don't want to pass up.

They called twice the week before to help in the arrangements and everything went super smoothly! (Best surprise birthday party I've ever thrown). Now the food was even better than the pictures show! They have delicious burgers. The sweet potato fries are amazing. And they have a jalapeño mashed potato side dish that is to die for! Definitely check it out if your looking for some comfort food.
