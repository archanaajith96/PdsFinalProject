The food is great. Well spiced and amazingly flavorful. Casual atmosphere is great for a family dinner, romantic date, or friendly meal.I did make the mistake of ordering a lamb vindaloo hot. I love spicy Indian food, but this was crazy. It was delicious, but painful. I still powered through it. It was that good. Just be careful on the spice level request."}, {"review_id": "MVyFhGK2f-eR2vniUKiMPw", "user_id": "yQDf9tgDpAEINLMmV1jerA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Eh. Wanted a curry. Kind of like going for sushi in Iowa. Not the best, not the worst. The buffet was slim. The normal white guy go tos. Tikka masala, chili chicken, tandoor chicken, aloo mushroom. Tried a bit of everything, the tikka was more like a butter chicken, not much spice or flavor. Clean, friendly, affordable. Only advice, quit making Indian food to appeal to white folks. Make it the way you would at home, in your kitchen. Flavors, the smells, the spice is what makes it enjoyable and better than the burger place down the street."}, {"review_id": "0uJlJSYZr97XuSD73pzwmw", "user_id": "zmULkpQtd-C4yfbWjMrCuA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/19/2018", "text": "So...Rapid City isn't exactly the culinary epicenter of the world.  Having been in town for work all week, I had tried Murphy's, the Firehouse, and Stonewalls.  I was tired of American bistros and wanted to mix it up a little bit.  A couple of my more adventurous colleagues and I met up at Katmandu Bistro.  The restaurant is small, but not quite \"hole in the wall\" small.  For a Thursday night, there was plenty of available seats.  The service was excellent because there were only about 10 patrons in the restaurant.  They were attentive and very helpful with explaining items on the menu.  My go to Indian food order is the \"Mixed Grill.\"  It included a mix of tandoori specialties, i.e. lamb sekh kabab, chicken tikka, tandoori chicken and tilapia.  They also provided some excellent dipping sauce, which was orange and tasty.   They offered the meal in a variety of spiciness temperatures, i.e. mild, medium, and spicy.   I do not do \"hot\" food because I'm a small child (per my colleagues).  The mixed grill was generally pretty good.  I haven't had tilapia in an Indian restaurant before, and they even threw in a few shrimp.  The plate was served hot and steaming like a pile of fajitas straight off the grill.  It was really good and plenty of food!  I had an order of garlic naan to help scoop up some of the meat and sauce.  I left rather satisfied, i.e. there was plenty of food!My colleagues had the Butter Chicken, i.e. Tandoori baked chicken in exotic spices with tangy cream sauce and the Chicken Vindaloo , i.e. the South Indian traditional favorite of chicken and potatoes in a tangy hot sauce.  They both got their meals \"spicy.\"   They were both quite pleased as they were wipe the sweat off their brows and said, \"Ah...clears the sinuses quite nicely.\"  (That is not how I describe good food...but I was reminded, \"That's because you are a child Mr. \"Double Zero\" on the spicy scale.\")  Both of my colleagues commented that they were quite full on the portions.They also serve alcohol at this restaurant, which allowed my colleagues and I to enjoy a beer with our meal. Overall - I will definitely be coming back to the Katmandu Bistro in the future."}, {"review_id": "VJfrOkkZ9W_akCUjiEndMQ", "user_id": "5WJ_Gt1SIOioIn78nHmy_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Excellent food and authentic; I eat here every time I'm in Rapid City.

The staff was very friendly and helpful in guiding us through the menu, and choosing some of the customer favourites.We choose the Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Curry as our main entrees.  Both dishes arrived quickly, with generous portions.  Rice was served on the side.  The food was flavorful with a taste of exotic spices.  The chicken and lamb were both tender and mildly spicy.  I put down a bed of rice, and topped it with the meat and sauce...very satisfying!If you want to try something different than the typical American bar and grill food, then give them a try."}, {"review_id": "P0FFjMXqirDxImxjdSsjzg", "user_id": "mAVSFS5nkniE8qWBBXdS-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "I never think Indian when I'm in Rapid City, but this place is great!

This was taken out, so I can't speak to the ambience of the restaurant. The food, however, was great. I got the tandoori mushrooms, four large mushrooms blanketed with gently spiced and seasoned  yogurt that were roasted to tenderness without crossing over into the withered shrinkage zone. They come with an elegant onion sauce that plays against the creaminess of the yogurt. As my main I had the fried momos with a very generous side of raita. The momos were also skillfully cooked, with crisp edges but soft bellies. The feeling of ground chicken as well seasoned, and again only very mildly spicy. For my personal preference, the raita had a few too many caraway seeds, but I recognize that that's a matter of personal taste. Overall a very satisfying meal."}, {"review_id": "gVnjEQN5Db7GivX1QaO1EQ", "user_id": "6LwQb-JbVIaGQAzt3MCgPw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/26/2017", "text": "Food is pretty good.

Enjoyed the lunch buffet. The veggie dishes had much more flavor than the meat ones did, but I have found that common when eating at Indian restaurants. I did wish they had more meat in the curries, it was a challenge to find more than a piece or two when plating my meal. I'm going to say the best part was the fresh nan that they bring to your table after asking if you want regular or garlic. I don't think I paid extra, but we got two servings of garlic nan. It was very thin, piping hot and delicious. I would go back again and order off the menu. I like the charging stations at all the seats"}, {"review_id": "Fi1qi83VCl5XtRlaKZ1LEg", "user_id": "wMeL9mIMReDSy2TTuoLGdg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/3/2017", "text": "Great food, friendly folks and classy decore.

I was a traveler in the city and the only time they would 'choose' to serve me if I do a take out, which I refused as I didn't want to eat in the car. They put the phones out of service during the rush hour so that you cannot order on phone or make a reservation or even find out if it is a good idea to travel all the way to the place.I do hope the owner realize that the need of good service is equally important to the quality of food in a restaurant business."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/kathmandu-bistro-rapid-city?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
