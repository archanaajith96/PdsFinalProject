The atmosphere is much less flashy than a lot of Eat Street locations; this is more like an authentic Hanoi pho joint. We were waited on by Tracy, who was bubbly and hilarious, and also sincerely enthusiastic about describing her kitchen's offerings. Even before I had a single bite, I knew I wanted to come back and try some different things.I got the basic pho. It was good; there was a LOT of meat in it. I didn't even eat all the mean, which is weird right? Three different kinds of meat. They didn't bring a plate of bonus options like many places do with pho, but it the way they served it was just fine. My mom got the Chicken Noodle Soup, which sounds more boring than it actually was. It was in a giant bowl, just like the pho. We also had appetizers of spring rolls and egg rolls, which were GREAT. In particular, I loved the sauce that came with the spring rolls.The prices are great, too. There are a lot of more interesting offerings on the menu that appear to be worth trying. It seems like no matter what you order, it will be thoughtfully assembled, surprisingly affordable, and conveyed with speed and friendliness."}, {"review_id": "lBqAA_QjKXqai9XaCDNMDQ", "user_id": "7YXyAvDu_LGGwUVkh0QHIA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I'd been eyeing this place for a while French Crepes and Vietnamese food in the same restaurant? Yeah, we were confused too. It's not the easiest to find, has a small parking lot but once you get inside you are welcomed! My Huong Kitchen does both crepes and Vietnamese well. We went from Egg Rolls to Pho to a French crepe and everything was great. Not the best Pho I've had in the Twin Cities but it was still very tasty. Service was very friendly.  Definitely deserves its highly rated status."}, {"review_id": "u4r7zO4uztbJKdtSqEyA2Q", "user_id": "YO7RW77ANgi6H-dlpPX51w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "My Huong has been on my list of places to try for awhile because I always see it on lists for the top places to eat pho in MN. I am always skeptical of those list (prob cause my opinion favorite never makes the list). The restaurant itself is nice and easily accessible. With some parking and a decent number of tables to serve a good rate of people coming and going. The menu is in the smaller size which I appreciate. It's ok if you don't have every Vietnamese dish known to man, as long as what you do have is good. We got egg rolls which came with fish sauce and spring rolls which came with peanut sauce as appetizers which were decent. We all got pho since this was the reason I came. Overall the pho was good! I found the broth was aromatic and not too sweet or salty. The issue my friends and I had was My Huong pho comes out with all the ingredients in it already like the bean sprouts, Thai basil and lime. They take away the whole part of the pho eating experience by not giving a plate of these ingredients to share like most pho places instead. I personally don't love bean sprouts and I like a little less lime than most people. Everyone eats their pho slightly differently to their taste buds. By bringing it all out in one bowl already, you take away that element. I also thought the meat in the pho was a little over cooked as I am used to having my meat separated and cooked in the broth now.Overall, I think My Huong is a decent Vietnamese restaurant. It would be a really good introduction place for someone who has never had pho before. They make it easy, but then what's the fun in eating when it is too easy?"}, {"review_id": "WQM-1Ue6M1w01qsu_NCB7Q", "user_id": "kbyxFChwMzukTasy9lRHTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the twin cities. I love coming here for a relaxing weekend lunch. It's tucked away in a little strip mall on Nicollet (aka Eat Street). The inside is nicely decorated with plants and artwork, and the staff is friendly. There are about 10 tables, so it feels nice and cozy, without being claustrophobic. They also offer take-out orders, if you just want food to go.The food itself is all delicious and affordable (around $8 for an entree). My favorite is the curry chicken noodle soup. The spring rolls are wonderful, too, if you're extra hungry and want an appetizer. They also serve rice dishes (such as com tam) and sandwiches (bahn mi), if you're not in the mood for pho.Definitely check it out the next time you're craving some Vietnamese cuisine!"}, {"review_id": "4aejScyqJHMUXMpIist0LQ", "user_id": "0g4P4Dlfjpt-COLhsoZMAw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "We drive 3 hours to MN and go straight to this little piece of heaven!  Love their Pho and Bahn Mi.

She loves to cook, and she loves to cook for her customers. It shows.There may be larger, more well-known Vietnamese restaurants in Minneapolis (Quang's is right across the street), but none that are as good, or as homey as My Huong Kitchen. In my view, it is the benchmark by which Vietnamese food and hospitality should be measured.To be sure the menu is limited; you won't find a 50-page menu with every imaginable dish. But what Tracy prepares is delicious, and served with love. Do try the eggrolls, a broken rice dish, and the Pho or other soups. And, if you're lucky, as we were, Tracy will prepare a fabulous French crepe for dessert.In 2 words: go here for great food and an enjoyable experience."}, {"review_id": "Jj7pe7BU1nP8HBhfdq7LcQ", "user_id": "ErWPjeuK5uKHLmtz4BM9ng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "Although I've only tried a couple of the Viet restaurants in Minneapolis (having just moved here), I have a gooood feeling this one will be one of my favorites!My Huong is somewhat easy to miss, and from the outside you might not even realize that it's a sit down restaurant (looks pretty small) but don't let that stop you from stopping in. The owner is incredibly friendly and welcoming, and stops by each table to say hello and make sure her customers are satisfied. I ordered pho tai (not on the menu, as the only one listed is their pho combo) and it is hands down the best pho I've ever had at a restaurant! Bursting with flavor and the broth is clear - a sign of a truly talented chef. I tried the pho at Quang and it does not compare to this one!To top off the night, the owner brought us banana smoothies on the house! Such a good experience and I'll be back for sure when I need a good ol' (authentic) Vietnamese fix!"}, {"review_id": "94GqEXnmpX1JKkvgQsfxyg", "user_id": "wSByVbwME4MzgkJaFyfvNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "My Huong Kitchen is an easy five stars.

Perusing the restaurants in Minneapolis, I came upon this place and couldn't resist to trying a new Vietnamese place. It's a quaint little restaurant, tucked away on the side of a building. But don't let the appearance turn you away. The food was very reasonably price and allowed us to order a lot and try many dishes. The food came out quickly and was beautifully prepared. Everything was so fresh and authentic. The spring rolls were my personal favorite. There was a perfect peanut sauce that went along side. We also tried the Bubble Tea, which also was very yummy. They use fresh ingredients in all their smoothies. We also tried the noodle salad and Bhan mi sandwiches. Nothing disappointed! Definitely recommend this place to anyone. A great deal for some great food!!"}, {"review_id": "BXcQKQn73kbLiN3trUDbGQ", "user_id": "-thw19l4MzVBAX1GMyKP7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/27/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Recently stopped by for dinner at My Huong with three friends. We were warmly greeted by co-owner Tracy who continued to engaged with us and with a series of regulars in an ongoing conversation. Such a warm and vivacious personality. By the time we left we felt like family.We started by sharing the very good Eggrolls and the excellent Shrimp Spring Rolls. I had planned to order the traditional Pho. But when I said that I'd had it before, Tracy strongly suggested I try something different. I said I was open to an alternative and she recommended the Curry Chicken Noodle Soup. It was a perfect choice for a cold November evening. Spicy hot but with a real depth of flavor. Plenty of slices of lean chicken, carrots, noodles and peppers. Absolutely fantastic!Two buddies did order the Pho, both finding it much to their liking. The fourth went with the Beef Stew Noodle Soup that he sopped up with relish.I added a dense, sweet Vietnamese coffee to my order. Next time I'll try a Bubble Tea. We were too full to order the Crepes but will back soon to give them a try. I also want to sample the various Broken Rice dishes and the Banh Mi. I hardly recognized the place because it had significantly expanded since my last drop in. After dinner I concluded that too much time had passed between visits. I will definitely be back sooner than later."}, {"review_id": "Wlvgw2hEf_VFcC8MFerSiA", "user_id": "6ett_MaGN8xPcO-SzKngOQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "The egg rolls were fresh, hot, and clearly homemade.

Timing was fast from walking in the door to having food in front of us which was great!I ordered bun cha gio (egg roll noodle salad) and loved it! The egg rolls had a flaky exterior that was light and crispier than other places. The inside had tons of flavor.

I've had their crab/ground pork patty with lemongrass pork chop. Excellent flavor profile. I've also had the curry soup, and the lemongrass chicken. Both excellent. There were a few things I didn't care for like the sauce that comes with their spring rolls but that was more of a taste preference than a \"poor quality\" issue. I would have preferred a sauce leaning towards the savory side than to the sweet side.

They were tightly wrapped (by a professional!) and full of deliciousness. The dipping sauce was a perfect blend of savory and spicy. My one personal critique is that I prefer the spring rolls at Hmong Village stalls -- they use more mint and other leafy herbs. I found the My Huong ones lacking in that zing. I also ordered the broken rice pork dish. It was pretty good, but it tasted like something I could've easily made at home. Which is why this is a 4/5 star rating -- if I can make it at home, I usually don't like to pay for it.
