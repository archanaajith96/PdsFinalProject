No pics because was scarfed them down fast, LOL. Crepes are not too crispy which can cause it to break and your toppings fall out so it's a good thing. It was almost sponge cake like for such a thin sheet. Toppings and crepes themselves were not too sweet. I believe they use fresh whip cream. Everything balanced out well. You can build your own or order from their menu creations. What we ordered:Plain waffle w/ whip cream on the sidePlain crepe w/ cheese cake bites and whip creamRock at the road crepe which had marshmallows, almonds and white chocolate syrup and choice of ice cream, we got chocolate (rocky road cream inspired)Revel crepe w/ strawberries, bananas, Nutella and whip cream and choice of ice cream, we got vanilla"}, {"review_id": "W1S-qvDCKiknbvMRffAzGw", "user_id": "gZYHHW5_XAlEpmO4wcRDlw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "The crepe desert was pretty good not great by any means The bathrooms are disgustingly dirty, and the walls in the restaurant area are dirty and disgusting makes you wonder if the food prep.

Luckily I finally got my chance to go!I had a \"Rebel Special\" (strawberries, bananas, and Nutella) crepe with vanilla ice cream and it was creamy and Nutella-y with a little fruity-ness mixed in. I really enjoyed the crepe-as-a-cone thing because it's different, the crepe is still slightly warm when you get it and it's soft which is the opposite of how cones usually are. I definitely see myself coming back and meeting friends here for a treat. The price is pretty fair and the ice cream crepes are good."}, {"review_id": "KNvX_PGSBfp_KGtIAmUS5A", "user_id": "o_bRgYHoCp01lQcmR0wu9A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Ended up here because my daughter was craving for crepes. The place is well kept and it looks like they pay attention to cleanliness. There's plenty of seating and definitely room for a busy day without feeling crowded. Definitely worth the a shot if you're into sweet desserts. The Thriftys ice cream is also a nice touch to know that there's something everyone is (or at least should be) familiar with.

The crepes and waffles are executed consistently every time we've come in and with the infinite combinations, they'll always be something to find that's pleasing.Located on the southwest corner of Eastern and Coronado, it's easy to find and you'll enter a spacious area with plenty of seating inside and a few tables outside. The menu consists of combinations that you can choose to have a freshly made crepe or a waffle as your vehicle to hold your toppings. I prefer the waffle over the crepe for the added texture factor and less messy factor. Top it off with a scoop of Thrifty's ice cream, and you're golden.I've tried about three or four of the creations and I really like the Camp Out Smore topped with a scoop of chocolate malt crunch which is my favorite Thrifty flavor. The chocolate flavors with the crunchy waffle and graham crackers with the sweetness of the whipped cream and marshmallows just goes together well with me. The rest of the family usually goes for crepes with some kind of fresh fruit combination.Prices are fair and depending on how much you add on, a crepe or waffle will run you between $5-$7. We've never really had any issues with service as the employees are willing to help you out if it's your first time or answer any questions. They've got the technique pretty down pat and can bust out a waffle or crepe in a couple of minutes. If you choose to hang out, you can grab a board game whoop everyone's butt in Sorry just like I did."}, {"review_id": "jlZTYfAMBilZJ7K-CIPMWg", "user_id": "PttCYkzc9p3Phm8_O2irmQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "This is my new favorite dessert place. I've been here twice and tried the East meets West crepe and the Banana Cheese Pie waffle. Both were incredible, though the waffle was heavy (in a good way....still in a happy food coma). Staff is very friendly, and they have a lot of choices as well as the option to build your own crepe or waffle. I will definitely come back and recommend this place to friends."}, {"review_id": "BweMDXIPvZyzfHThsF6Rng", "user_id": "ud549ZavkkniNcv71t1gTw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/30/2017", "text": "I never really crave crepes, but I happened to be in the restaurant next door so my boyfriend and I stopped by. We had a crepe with Nutella and Strawberries. These are the Japanese version of crepes where you'll basically receive the crepe as if it's an ice cream cone. Speaking of ice cream cones, you can also get Thrifty ice cream on top! But no offense, I've never been impressed with Thrifty. I just like the idea of ice cream with my crepe.I didn't get the ice cream, though, because I don't like how high the messiness potential is when you're holding such a thin crepe with ice cream in a piece of wax paper. I would prefer to get it on a plate or something. But like I said, I got a crepe with Nutella and strawberries, topped with whip cream (pretty sure it was reddi whip). You can't really go wrong with that, so obviously I'm going to say it was exactly what I expected and it was good because it was.If I come back and order something else, I'll update the review. I'm not seeing that happening any time soon, but you never know--I just might crave some crepes one day."}, {"review_id": "ebagtsq4xbhl7nOvjvcfVg", "user_id": "FQbVI3UyKlL-HfQGcRF8aA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/25/2017", "text": "Upon entering this place, the aroma is amazing. The smell of batter and cooked crepes encompasses you and it's delightful. The staff is friendly and the establishment is quite big and a good area to study or catch up with friends as you enjoy your crepe. Their crepes are delectable. They are Japanese style crepes, where they are wrapped up like a cone and you eat it without utensils (but you can if you really need to). My personal favorite is the East Meets West; it is a crepe filled with red bean paste, mochi, and condensed milk and I like to get green tea ice cream and whipped cream on top. The red bean paste is tasty and smooth and is complemented by the chewiness of the mochi; the condensed milk adds a slight but subtle sweetness to the entire dessert. Definitely recommend this place and will be coming back time and time again!"}, {"review_id": "WJqKy_nhcihgRjRyPLlNAA", "user_id": "CZnuW6YeZg7ZIiTbmI58BQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2017", "text": "This is one of my favorite hang out spots!
