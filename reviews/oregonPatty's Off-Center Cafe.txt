It's been around all my life and is always busy but does their best to keep the food flowing to move customers along without rushing anyone. The entire neighborhood knows it's a favorite to not cook on weekend or a great excuse to go out on a week day. They are aware of allergies and do their best to accommodate if you can help explain what you need. They are family friendly and great for just couples too. The style is very much a ma and pa diner that has incorporated the new chic farmhouse style. Their sweets look amazing though I couldn't indulge and though it looks small it's a big heart restaurant."}, {"review_id": "N78Y_D4X9XvGnxlUh6oQ9g", "user_id": "BAd2_1aeOwIUWKHdn0Ohgw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Tried this establishment again for the first time in years. I came once about 6 or so years ago and it was not a contender. Today we ventured in again and it was great!Good service. Friendly people. Great country kitchen feel. Awesome menu choices. I had the Mediterranean scramble. It was flavorful. Just the right amount of olives, mushrooms, and sun dried tomatoes.Mom had the Reuben and said it ties the best she has had. Perfectly cooked sauerkraut and meat. We will be back."}, {"review_id": "BDXv5D04zM1tZzfiaizTAw", "user_id": "Rno3225EJXGzFrOcvKlxNg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "The location was a bit difficult to find. The service I can say wasn't very friendly when I went in. Stood for a good 15 mins for a table and if that doesnt give you any idea of how small it is. Seating is very limited. About the food. It is very comforting. Something you can make at home. But if you aren't trying to make food you can come here. The food coming out was warm which is a plus. Because i hate to have my food luke- warm or cold. Other then that its an okay spot. I would not recommend this spot. I think for the price and location this is at.  You can get a better breakfast or lunch."}, {"review_id": "5W2-SrlIGPeSrDn2vPphSg", "user_id": "polc51aqptcf6nHEG8kt7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Great breakfast and have ZERO wait at 10:30am on a Sunday.  We are tourists that ate at World of Mouth Neighborhood Bistro last visit(and really enjoyed it), but when we were told the wait would be an hour and a half, we quickly decided that it was time to broaden our horizons.  Next stop, Patty's!  Staff was very welcoming, coffee was refilled promptly, and food was delicious.  We got the chicken fried steak and the lemon poppyseed pancake combo. It was tipped with a tasty lemon cream cheese frosting and served with raspberry syrup.  I will be honest, it was a little difficult to find in the corner of the complex.  Better signage may be needed, but parking was sufficient and we were pleasantly surprised.  I would recommend to anybody wanting a good, hearty, pleasant meal."}, {"review_id": "4eV7AzR7aAivG1mnLm2Jhg", "user_id": "hGlgDnTwS-FB8kr9O5hSuA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Good service and good food.

I used to come here for her chicken fried steak breakfast..it was my favorite!  Today, my family and I were happily greeted by Patty when we walked in and I told her about my diet change and she suggested the Tofu Scramble with wheat toast and  that they have vegan butter for the toast and for my coffee,  non dairy creamer.The Tofu Scramble was delicious filled with tofu,  mushrooms, onions, potatoes, red bell peppers and topped with fresh spinach. It was very filling yet light.   The efficient friendly service  was a great start to my day!  If you haven't tried Patty's Off Center you're missing delicious homestyle cooking at it's best.."}, {"review_id": "EHIE4PpHSYtCeBKELopjDQ", "user_id": "6FBISfHn_evda9dNm87oew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "It all started with a great cuppa coffee...

I was very impressed with this little cafe. It is tucked away behind some other shops, but it's quite a little delight. The cafe is small and has its charm. The waitress who helped us was very friendly and quick. I ordered the chicken fired steak and some French toast. Both dishes were absolutely delicious! My girlfriend got the special that day which was lemon poppyseed pancakes and those were phenomenal as well! I was really impressed with the French toast. I'm always out looking for perfect French toast and this place comes close to some amazing French toast I have had in Vegas. They make their French toast with Challah bread and the slices are real nice and thick! There are also oats/granola on the outside as well. You should really try the French toast here!"}, {"review_id": "IHaHtHk8kUc2U6ruhUdT2g", "user_id": "jdV7Q4RF_s7gnB19uN-OEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "Dang Martha...it don't get no better than this!Great food, very reasonable prices, excellent menu, good service...... well worth going for.

I had the chicken fried steak and eggs, over easy, crispy country potatoes, sourdough toast.  The chicken fried steak was okay - not much flavor, small amount of thin gravy with little visible sausage in it. Eggs were over cooked. Potatoes were under cooked, not crisp at all. Toast was dry and hard - could have hammered nails with it.  Earlier review comment about no ice in the ice water was my experience as well. Nice, friendly staff. Great greeting upon arrival by cook (owner?).  Nicely decorated and clean."}, {"review_id": "xIk6-WmFFtULwGSQuW748A", "user_id": "1MZGcoJU0uREmyCek5pwLA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/18/2017", "text": "Was on our way to the coast and left very early with the intention of stopping for breakfast. Our go to habit of checking in with yelp paid off richly. Patty's off Center is a gem of a find. Quiet, small and quirky. We were seated and ordered quickly and I was warned that my breakfast would take 20 minutes.  IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT. If you live within 20 miles, why are you not here all the time?Tomato Florentine rocked my world. Hubby's burrito was enough to feed 3.

Staff were nice, atmosphere was warm and inviting, but sadly the most important thing - the food - lacked.I ordered corned beef hash which is a regular for me. Most area restaurants use large, moist pieces of corned beef intermixed with the rest of this dish, but here they only give you pea sized diced squares, and only a few at that. In reality what I ended up getting was a roasted potato breakfast since you couldn't even taste the corned beef.I also have a sensitivity to egg yolk so I asked for scrambled egg whites. What I ended up receiving was a fried egg, yolk and all which I couldn't eat.Lastly, when we live in an area with such rich coffee options, I don't really see an excuse for serving Maxwell House.Atmosphere - 4 starsStaff - 3 stars (friendly but screwed up my order)Food - 2 stars (potatoes were good)I'll give this place another try and perhaps order something different.

This is a great place. The 'Off Center' is appropriate, since the restaurant is tucked in the back of a little strip mall off of Center St. (It is probably easier to turn North on 17th, and turn in at the first driveway.) We were greeted as we entered, and the waitress let us know that as soon as she had a table cleaned off we could be seated. Zip-Zap-Zoop, and we were seated. I ordered the bacon, mushroom & Swiss omelette. The 'home fried' potatoes were seasoned nicely and I really liked the sautéed onions mixed in. The biscuit was a little dense, but tasted good. My wife got the breakfast sandwich (egg, bacon & cheddar in a ciabatta bun). It was excellent, and huge. We took half of it home. This will become one of our favorite breakfast stops in Salem, OR."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pattys-off-center-cafe-salem?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
