We either get burritos or burrito bowls, the former wrapped in a tortilla or the latter sans burrito to save some calories.The choices are good with chicken, steak, pork, or with beans rather than meat if you are so inclined.The staff is always friendly and accommodating. They will customize your entree to your liking with a variety of fillings including rices, peppers and other veggies and salsas.Your meal will come out similar to the chain burrito places, but this is local  and so it is less cookie cutter than the chains. What you see on the line is what you ask for and get. Besides burritos, they offer tacos, quesadillas, etc., but as the name indicates, burrito is the star.I have yet to be disappointed with my order."}, {"review_id": "Na8w53EvU7NWwKh2IJdoHQ", "user_id": "Ip-XdrL7uInJmkpPY6OMhw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Highly recommend their burrito bowl! They have many different meats and toppings to choose from. Pickled onions are one of my favorites. They're sweet and salty and make a great addition to your meal. All of their salsa are amazing but my favorite is the pineapple habanero, which they said was spicy but I didn't find it to be."}, {"review_id": "D1QIBPo44SINgl_6yAwX7g", "user_id": "jofRlWezV7QJpCjBGRXnEg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/16/2017", "text": "I didn't know there was a 3rd location! I love love loveeeee Diablo in Newark and I'm so excited there is one in N.Wilmington. We just bought a house and this location is 2 min away. Conveniently it is located in a shopping center so there's plenty of parking. Inside it's nice and clean, very open space, and plenty of seating!  Service was really nice and everyone was attentive and speedy. I went for my usual: steak burrito bowl w brown rice black beans mushrooms pepper jack cheese shredded romaine spicy pico pickled shallots pineapple habanero salsa with lime shallot vinaigrette!!! so good! if you havent tried the pineapple salsa you have to its such a good pop of flavor.

It's a similar assembly line style as Chipotle or Qudoba, allowing you to build your own burrito, salad, tacos. Have your order prepared to avoid the stress of choosing while in line because the employees talk quickly and the line sometimes gets backed up. I typically get a salad with steak or chicken and add chorizo (it costs extra). They recently added kale to their salad options which I was pretty happy about. The ingredients are good, and salad portions are pretty large. Lots of options, and the base isn't expensive, but can get pricy if you want extras like guac, chorizo, etc. The line gets pretty busy at lunchtime during the week, but the inside is large enough that you can always grab a table. Decent lunch spot if you're close!"}, {"review_id": "RugAcm26cUm356K7KmCilg", "user_id": "aNj0Xdc_MOeOzhH6KPNVtw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "My favorite Mexican fast food.

There are more toppings and sauces available. We've been here multiple times and there is always a line. The place is located in a shopping complex, always busy. We've tried their tacos and burritos and love everything. Note, like Chipotle, they do charge extra for Guacamole. We like their sauces and you can always request them for extra sauce on the side (I do recommend doing that). The prices are reasonable and on par with Chipotle/Qdoba. The food taste and flavor is definitely better."}, {"review_id": "uj6E63BYNQWi5_jiRG66vg", "user_id": "oiPutLXa5YpxcdLUMLyHjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/27/2017", "text": "We stopped here for lunch on our way to Virginia Beach and let me just say, once you experience el Diablo Burritos, you will no longer feel the same way about Chipotle!  I only wish that we had one back home in Rhode Island!

El Diablo is a fantastic local chain and the staff is always friendly. This location has more space and seating than the Trolley location making it more ideal for eating in than taking out. The ingredients are always fresh and there is much more variety than at Chipotle. Next to each protein choice is suggested toppings but feel free to be creative and make it your own! What really sets El Diablo apart is the selection of sauces/vinaigrettes. I firmly believe you can't make a bad choice so be adventurous because these sauces really add to the bold flavor combinations. Do yourself a favor and visit an El Diablo.

I tried the chicken quesadilla with a side of guac. It was delicious. Heavy on the cheese which was a nice surprise. Guac was great as well. Both were good portions and good prices.

I'm so blessed to live in Delaware to experience the BETTER AND INCOMPARABLE chipotle/moe's. I've been going here with my friends all throughout high school and we're still coming every other week. I been to every single location and I'm so lucky there is a Pike Creek location opening! It's so close to where I live. The service is great and I always receive more than I can finish which means el Diablo for leftovers... yum :) Their fresh ingredients kill the game. Mushrooms are delicious and you can't forget about the chipotle ranch. I either get flour tacos, bowl or the quesadillas, but honestly you can't go wrong with getting anything on the menu.

Prices are pretty reasonable. Husband and I got two burrito bowls for less than $20 and we finished it in 2 meals so totally worth it.

If you order a burrito or bowl, ur gonna be stuffed because the portion size is enormous. The only reason this place doesn't get 4 stars is because the one in Newark had chorizo and this one doesn't, which doesn't make sense...When doing comparisons between chipotle and el Diablo, I'd say chipotle wins because there is just something about chipotle that makes it better than the rest. But...that doesn't mean el Diablo isn't worth a try because they have their own sauces they make that taste really good and the variety of ingredients at el Diablo trump chipotle, so it's comes down to preferenceI know the space is small cause it's trolley square and it's limited, but if they could, making the space bigger would help cause it's cramped in there and it could get hot when the place gets packed in the summerOverall, recommend and you should try it if your a burrito fan!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-diablo-burritos-wilmington-2?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
