First off, they are located on a busy street, but have  their own valet parking IN ADDITION to their own self-park parking lot. This place is pretty fast paced, so don't be too put-off if things are a bit hectic, they are all just trying to keep things moving because it really gets busy. There is a huge bar area when you enter. The staff is friendly, and a bit curt but with a great sense of humor. My husband and I ordered the seabass and the grilled octopus. The Seabass is EXCELLENT! The seabass is probably one of the best I've ever had. It's baked, lightly buttered and flaky, with an amazing light lemon aftertaste. It's simply superb! PROS:- FOOD IS AMAZING!!! - parking lot (pay what you want/tips)- drinks are decent- service is relatively fast- staff is friendly- portions are huge CONS: - gets really packed- make reservations for parties of 3 or more- service can feel rushed"}, {"review_id": "jpmty5EWiMWcOx4w32LseA", "user_id": "Gs8_CDNIsq7fkjUkwpG_sg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "Very disorganized. Don't bother calling and making reservations. You'll still wait an hour.Food was not good at all.We had surf and turf, steak was OK, lobster tail was super small and overcooked. Not worth the $38.00My wife ate cowboy steak that was pretty good, fries were soggy. There too busy and kitchen drops quality of what they serve.Table of 15 was almost $1,000 and if I didn't check over receipt I would have double tipped cause server did not disclose to me gratuity was included.Never going again."}, {"review_id": "A5V2qXP0-AocZX-V9m6iVQ", "user_id": "2PvhZY2BvZQ592-M6csZ2w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "Absolutely amazing!!My husband and I enjoy this restaurant so much...

Going inside was a nightmare, line out the door and so much traffic inside it was ridiculous. We were thankful the bartender found us a seat at the bar which was delightful. If not the wait would've been a good 45-50 minute wait. Everyone there was very friendly I must say. The staff were very welcoming and the customers were very social- the environment was quiet comfortable. The food was amazing. I ordered the veal and my gf ordered the surf n turf. The prices were - the prices. I can't say cheap because it wasn't, but then again a lot of the food was seafood so that explains pricing by itself. I'd have to say overall rating a 4 star. I'd like to give 4.5 but not an option. The tightness of the place with the congestion is what messed up the experience a bit. Also- They have a parking garage/valet parking dedicated to their restaurant which was also a plus. I would definitely come back to try more items on the menu."}, {"review_id": "H4l8enDwpMqSvolnz3HF-Q", "user_id": "_YyQF6B2vJqYf1FnCyXv9A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I have been coming here for last 15years and not much has changed.

Camarao a Guilho ($14.50)Shrimp sauteed with garlic - Solid dish, although the shrimp might be overcooked at times. Rabos de Lagosta Grelhada ($34.95)Twin grilled lobster tails served with a lemony butter sauce - C'mon now.  I love lobster and always order these when I come here. To me it's on point.    Gambas Grelhadas market pricePrawns complete with head and shell in zesty hot sauce - I am not a fan of shrimp with the heads on but my father is so he ate all of these.  I am guessing they were good as none were left. Tomahawk No Churrasco market price (Appx $60)Barbecued Tomahawk steak - A beast and cooked perfectly.  You can easily share this dish with a couple of friends.  See pci. Sangria is a bit on the light side.  I usually order a glass of wine and just dump that in there to \"spice\" it up a notch. Parking is free across the street make sure you get your ticket validated. Overall, when I visit Jersey I make sure to stop by here for seafood goodness.  Give it a try and make sure your wallet is fat."}, {"review_id": "IXe1DgTqv2-W1C8utzCG0w", "user_id": "HaPM8iQhyjm2pVh3g4bUGw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/25/2017", "text": "My friend and I came here on 4th of July.

So much fresh seafood at reasonable prices. I tried the Dungeness crab app which is like a cold spread to be eaten with bread, it was delicious! We then shared a seafood platter that was more that we could even finish. It came with a lobster tail which was cooked to perfection, the shrimp were just huge, and the fish was soo tender that even a fish adverse person like myself enjoyed it a lot. It also came with literally a pot of mussels, can say enough about the broth they were simmering in. In terms of service, they seem to be ok. The waiter was nice enough and made good recommendations. The place is a bit out dated, but if what you're looking for is a good seafood place this is a great option."}, {"review_id": "HcvKnzlBXceYFZjZJlcZzw", "user_id": "i6Fz6P-wGyqBYhovtIhgPA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/10/2017", "text": "Best seafood in the Ironbound.

I moved away from NJ 5 years ago but I always come back whenever I'm in town. My family has been coming here for 30 years, since I was just a baby. At least once a month, we came out and had a seafood dinner. Over Thanksgiving break, I was back home, and we took the whole family for a dinner at our favorite place! The kitchen is smack dab in the middle of the restaurant surrounded by glass. You can see the crew making every meal. This is a nice touch and something I always remember watching as a kid. The seafood is fresh. Always. I've never had a bad meal here, not once in 30 years. Everything is delicious, but I usually go for Stuffed Portuguese Crab or one of the Shrimp dishes. This time, a little of both. The shrimp were enormous and the crab was so refreshing. I can't say enough about their food. Truly my favorite restaurant. It's not a massive restaurant and it gets very busy on the weekends. Make a reservation or be prepared to wait a bit. I went on Saturday night, and waited about 35 minutes for a table. Worth every minute though. I highly recommend eating here if you are a seafood fan. They have it all, and all of it will leave your mouth watering."}, {"review_id": "aAgZ5mKR3QFoRqWQyUYy1w", "user_id": "CwDJ4-5qwbGVK5K1CxYNEQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Had my first dining experience with a great friend who has been a repeat customer for years. Sat at the bar and our man Victor took great care of us. For starters had an ice cold Portuguese beer and my buddy had some white vino.My buddy ordered some smelts, anchovies cod croquettes and some octopus vinaigrette. Followed that up with a seafood paella that fed both of us with some leftovers for the road. Can't forget the Portuguese bread that we used to soak up some great flavor. Dessert was a flan and espresso. Great busy neighborhood atmosphere and feel. Welcoming place to many that day. At 130pm on a Saturday the place was packed.

Their food is still as good as it ever was. If I am in the mood for seafood this is one of my top 3 go to's down neck (aka the ironbound.) I've been coming for about 7 or 8 years and I am always happy with the food. I would, however, have some of the original complaints staff wise. There is clearly certain customers that get preferential star treatment. And the guys serving aren't exactly always friendly. With that being said, it's the food that brings me back. If my original review was not enough to get you to stop by and try for yourself, maybe this 2018 version might sway you. Do yourself a favor if you're in the mood for some treasures from the ocean. There is 2 parking lots, so it'll be easy to stop in and ENJOY!!!"}, {"review_id": "xd_7J75JiCcG2xP_YxdEoA", "user_id": "inCabX77SQWYxTSNQTncHA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/23/2017", "text": "Newark Ironbound district is a haven for Portuguese food, a lot of which contains seafood. I'll admit that I've always been a little hesitant to be adventurous with seafood but Seabra Marisqueira is certainly a good place to start. I got the vibe that the food is really high quality and they really know what they're doing with crab, lobster, etc.The king crab legs are great, perfectly tender and well-cooked. It's a little bit messy so get ready for that but the sauce that they use is out of this world. As my main course, I decided to keep it safe and go with the Frango à Guilho which is essentially chicken breast in their special garlic and white wine sauce. The chicken wasn't dry at all which is impressive when it comes to cooking chicken breast. Most of the dishes come with a side of rice and chips. As you can see from my picture, the meals are HUGE. It worked out because I had enough for both lunch and dinner.One thing I would like to see here is a lunch menu with smaller portions and lower prices. As is usually the case with good quality seafood and large dishes, the prices are pretty steep and I don't see myself ever coming back here for lunch.As far as logistics, there is a parking lot across the street which is a rare gem in the city of Newark. Most of the lunchtime seating is around the large bar but they also have a small dining room in the back with roughly 20 tables."}, {"review_id": "znHD29HiOyoReKktD62v0Q", "user_id": "ZMWMRNk9s1ajkDazrHO9Sw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/21/2017", "text": "The besttttt place for a nice meal when youre looking to show off a bit.

When I called and spoke to the gentleman I asked him for 2 orders of Gambas with sides of veggies and potatoes just like when I ate in... so when I finally get there and pick up my order I felt the bag very light so as I walked to my car I decided to open it and thank God I did because I come from Englewood Nj for this which is a 45 minute drive. So when I opened it there was a tray with 6 Gambas and another tiny tray with literally 1 full potato cut in half, 2 breads, and two stems of broccoli I paid $82 dollars for this and gave them $3 of tips.. I walked back in and asked the guy for the order of rice and he said I never told him which is a lie number one so he gave me a little tray. I felt like it wasn't enough and with all the attitude given to me I told him I would buy another didn't want to disappoint my husband on his birthday so I brought the other small tray and paid $5 for it so this whole experience cost me $90 seriously not worth it for 6 Gambas. And the server was so nasty and rude! If I ever go back I'll go on a Saturday night when the old staff who's been there forever are there and treat costumes like they are supposed to."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/seabra-marisqueira-newark?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
