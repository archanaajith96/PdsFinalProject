I decided to give this place a try when I took the wrong turn heading to Target. I ordered mi (egg noodle) soup and sticky rice with mango. Flavor: The broth was on point and noodles felt really light compared to what I was used to in CA. Regardless, it was a good combination. I just wish there was tripe and brisket though.Ambiance: It was pretty busy, but I didn't feel like it was at all.Service: Great prompt service despite being busy. Value: Definitely comparable to what I'm used to in CA.I'm really fortunate to have found this place and I could tell this is a local winner as the bar area was constantly filled with carryout orders throughout my whole dinner."}, {"review_id": "XENU3MmmDIr_9yF3TQT7yQ", "user_id": "NIsXHHOhE6iBbztneDDY1w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "This place is my pho go to, mainly because it's my boyfriend's favorite, but it's also pretty good! Normally I would go to somewhere on Olive (Pho Long) but for the location, nothing can beat it. I would also say, all around, they have wonderful food, not just pho, their Banh Mi's are really affordable and so are their other soup dishes that aren't pho. Highly recommend the thai tea that is not really on their menu and all the smoothies (except the pineapple because of the chunks, try the avocado, weird but super delicious actually). *side note my boyfriend would like to add that he thinks this review should be 5 stars, please read ahead to see why I disagree, but he would still like it to be known so here*#9: Pho with beef brisketIn their signature broth, I believe what makes this broth special is that it is a little sweeter, so not as salty. The broth is also always a good temperature too which is a small detail, but very much appreciated because who can stop themselves from eating piping hot soup on a cold day. I would so go for the extra noodles (large size) for just a few bucks more you get A LOT more food and it really makes a difference. The amount of meat that you get is OK, and the amount of noodles and \"toppings\" is okay too, I do wish they gave out more bean sprouts but I'm sure you can ask for more. Overall I do not get filled up at the end, so definitely go for one of their appetizers as well, the spring rolls are super tasty and inexpensive and come with a wonderful peanut dipping sauce. #13 Pho with ShrimpThis dish was similar to the beef brisket, but just sub out the brisket for shrimp. I believe the broth they used was still the same, but there might be a slight difference I'm not too sure. Again, the portion was not quite enough as well so the same negative comments about that here unfortunately."}, {"review_id": "tSkCg6s3Z3XMquhveIgEyw", "user_id": "uDFNUZcsK4HZbV4tOjjU1w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I'm upping my review of Mai Lee to 4 stars for one reason. Bun bo Hue (pronounced like boon bow hwey). Similar to a Pho soup, Bun bo Hue is even better in my opinion. Packed with sliced beef and vermicelli noodles in a delicious broth, it's named after the city of Hue in Vietnam where it is so popular. Mai Lee has the best version of this soup that I've found in St. Louis so far. Like Pho, it comes with a plate of leafy veggies, jalapeño slices and a lemon wedge. I add it all to my soup and also squeeze in a little hot sauce from the bottle on the table. I have other favorite Vietnamese dishes that can be found at other restaurants, but this is what brings me back to Mai Lee."}, {"review_id": "PyCLaiIXnN-8FfpYwVp1iQ", "user_id": "Pbry-b9xBgHlWlbGlYbTZg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Can't believe I've been here 100 times but never checked in or wrote a review...So here it is...The 4 star is purely for their pork banh mi($4.5) and beef combination pho($11). What's so special about their pork banh mi is that they use differently cooked pork meat that comes with tendon - very common in Asia but doesn't seem popular in America or Midwest. The meats have so much flavor and without sauce at all allows me to savor it. I really appreciate the way they handle their sandwiches, unlike most of sandwich shops that cover everything with a river of sauce...Their beef pho usually taste good with rare/medium beef at your choice. My only complaint is the soup is not hot enough sometime.I've tried some of their \"special\" dishes - not impressed."}, {"review_id": "2TvLqS6yMaEPqbgaZvcLIA", "user_id": "M1fk_IYOyZBKIw6ov8Q9hg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "Interesting how a simple storefront space can work.  When we arrived, fairly early, it was still pretty empty and I kind of felt like I was in a cafeteria space.  But once it filled up (quickly), it was rather pleasant inside with the hum of people dining.  And, oddly enough, while a big open room, it wasn't especially loud.I have rarely eaten Vietnamese cuisine, but had been told to try Mai Lee's salt & pepper calimari.  And it was pretty excellent. A crunchy yet soft breading over tender calimari, with an interesting sauce.  The sauce came in a bowl on the side and was essentially a layer of salt & pepper on top of a vinegared water/liquid.  Not overly tart, but really added a bit of zest and tartness to the calimari.Other diners with me said their pho was tasty, and the noodles with chicken breast was delicious.  I tasted the chicken and it was pretty good.  It also came with shredded lettuce with a light dressing that complemented it well.  Egg roll appetizer was good, if standard.  I also got a Banh Mi Thit Nuong - Vietnamese BBQ Pork Sandwich.  It was an interesting sandwich, with lightly barbecued meat chunks that were tender enough to bite through, yet still firm."}, {"review_id": "jdWSKFVaLDRjrIKE4wxO0A", "user_id": "mE1h8WPb4-ZhUmeh303AMw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "Best and most consistent Vietnamese and Chinese food in STL.

I never have a stomach ache from eating here and have always found the food to be very appetizing and satisfying. I do believe they have the best pho in STL.

I've ordered something different every visit and I've lived it all.Ok this is a weekly thing for my wife & I - WE LOVE MAI LEE SO MUCH!! Everything is great. Service is always great. Prices are more than fair. GO.2nd visit and it was just as good - maybe even better than last time!! Service is perfect. Food was amazing - this time we did crispy spring rolls, caramelized catfish, mixed seafood with crispy rice. Papaya salad, and iced coffee. This place is freaking incredible...  Ever visit a spot that just feels good - homey in all the right ways? I'm absolutely IN LOVE with Mai Lee and it'll probably be a weekly visit for me until I've worked my way through this amazing menu. They're LEGIT, and I'm so happy we finally stopped by...We ordered steamed pork bun, crab Rangoon, Pho, and Salt&Pepper calamari - everything was DELICIOUS and cooked perfectly. We've lived in Asia, and this was THE HANDS DOWN BEST Salt&Pepper squid I've ever had in my life - fried just right, tender, with green pepper leeks and onion. The dipping sauce of lemon juice with salt&pepper put it over the top for me... Mai Lee will probably kill all other Vietnamese and Chinese joints in STL....just GO."}, {"review_id": "Ie9GJKBlVknGDifHAApDag", "user_id": "VVXqnDpoEvpQPlu9u0vm-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Mai Lee is amazing!

I would give it a 4.5 if yelp allowed half stars. I can't speak to the authenticity of Mai Lee's Vietnamese food because I'm not familiar enough, but I can say that this is probably my go to restaurant to take people from out of town who are wanting some tasty Vietnamese (and other assorted Asian) food. It's decorated tastefully (see what I did there?) and had the capacity for larger groups, which made it ideal for some of K.'s out of town coworkers and entertaining family when they came in for the holidays. We ordered a variety of dishes for everyone to share and enjoyed everything as far as I can remember. Our food was seasoned and cooked well and I really enjoy the fresh herbs that usually come with certain Vietnamese dishes (pho being the only one whose name I can think of right now).

I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this place. Did I say \"really\"? For YEARS, many of my friends, co-workers, and associates have told me that this place is awesome. I believed them. I've been wanting to come here for YEARS, and just haven't had the chance. That chance finally came on Friday when I came here for lunch. I was disappointed...If I had to put in one sentence why I didn't really care for this place, I would say: \"Mai Lee offers a wide variety of fresh but basic Asian cuisine, at a moderate to high price, with lacking customer service and consistency.\"  Let's unpack this.The menu here is massive with almost every variation of Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai dishes. Seriously, the menu is a book. I ordered #171, just to show you how many different options they offer. #171 was the Vietnamese Special Fried Rice. I asked the waiter what made this Vietnamese when compared to Chinese Fried Rice and he said that Chinese Fried Rice is soy sauce-based, while this one is tomato sauce based. Now, having heard that, I must say although my rice was freshly prepared and had all the meats and trimmings of Chinese fried rice, to me there was NO DIFFERENCE in flavor between what I had and the Chinese Food I get from Chinese restaurants all over town. NONE. Now was it as greasy as the local Chinese restaurants offer? Probably not. But you can't tell me that THAT was \"Vietnamese, tomato-based\". Plus it was $15, which I don't have a huge gripe about that, but I could have ordered a box of special fried rice elsewhere for less. IJS.Now for the service... My waiter was nice, but he was often MIA. I sat and waited for refills, which a busser took care of for me. I sat and waited for a while to receive my check. I was never asked how I liked my meal. Upon getting my box, I boxed it myself. All this waiting wasn't necessary as the place wasn't busy at all.Now, here's my biggest gripe about my experience at Mai Lee. So I just said that I waited a lot during my time there. During the long time that I was waiting, I noticed that when EVERY table received their check, they were also given fortune cookies. WHY, OH WHY, was I the ONLY table in the ENTIRE restaurant that was NEVER brought fortune cookies?!?!?!?!?!?! That's not an exaggeration. I seriously watched this with my own two eyes. I thought about asking for a fortune cookie, but I shouldn't have had to. It should have been brought to me like it was brought to EVERY diner there! Consistency is a devil in the detail, that should not be ignored. Treat me like everyone else, please and thank you.The 90s R&B playlist playing in the background and \"great\" reputation that this place has aren't enough to have me waste any more time waiting or being slighted by this restaurant again."}, {"review_id": "QH3Rjvwjmne82WkcusNL0g", "user_id": "Dn48QIdrkXM2emgdyPl2YQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "I arrived around 2pm and was greeted by the hostess, she wanted to sit me in a corner that faced the window with the view of stacked chairs that blocked the view.

I must say very different and healthy, you are welcomed to dress it up with the many herbs that were served with the soup. Would I have this soup again, yes!
