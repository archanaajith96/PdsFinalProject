Their slogan, \"Trust Me\", entails a non conventional type of dining known as omakase. There is no set menu, and ingredients frequently change depending on what's seasonal. À la carte ordering is also optional, but to get the authentic experience the omakase is recommended. Communicating with the chef prior to the meal regarding allergies/preferences is highly encouraged for an enjoyable experience.Some of the honourable mentions;1) The first appetizer brought out was a tuna carpaccio. The ponzu brought a brightness to the fish. The tuna while fresh, emitted a slightly \"fishy\" odor/taste. The rice paper around the tuna tartare added a unique texture.2) Raw squid stuffed with Louisiana blue crab, toasted sesame. The raw squid had a delicate sweetness which complemented the sweet tare sauce. The blue crab was bold in flavour and its savoriness balanced out an otherwise sweet dish.3) One of my favourites is the Kona amberjack (kanpachi) with jalapeno sauce. I think amberjack is one of the more underrated fish used in sushi. It possesses a pale pink flesh, having a tender texture akin to fatty Bluefin tuna, but with less mercury and is more sustainable. Skipjack tuna (katsuo) was smoked and garnished with scallions. Usually recognized as canned tuna due to its strong taste, skipjack lends well to bold flavours. The smokiness accentuated the rich umami flavours and the scallion balanced out its oceanic aroma.I really liked that they showcased local seafood from the Hawaii region, in addition to flown in products. The garnishes on the nigiri were creative (Maui onion, yuzu jelly, etc). The flavours lean towards more regional omakase, not the traditional Edomae style sushi. The only weakness was the sushi nice. It was served steaming hot, which distracted the toppings. It could have used more vinegar as the rice lacked the acidity needed to balance the neta (topping). Overall, I can see why it's a local favourite."}, {"review_id": "1OvveLaT7PWhne8M1ym0Sw", "user_id": "FTloopQubIfSuXKQ7qi2PA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Would give this place 3, perhaps 3.5 stars. Omakase is 50% sushi, 50% experience. Though the quality and variety of the Omakase selection was great, the dining experience was less than subpar. A few things:(1) I was disappointed that when I made reservations, I was not given the option to select my seating. So when my party arrived we were seated at a table vs at the bar even though there were empty seats at the bar enough for my entire party. This isn't a huge con, just a bummer considering we usually like our omakase experience to have a view of the sushi chefs actually assembling the plates. (2) The above could have been ignored completely (again, not a huge con) however, our servers seemed less than interested in being there and didn't treat the folks who *were* sitting at the bar any differently. As each plate came, they rushed through explaining what was on there - to the point where I even had to ask \"wait, so what's on top??\" Given it's a pre-set omakase and we didn't even get a menu or descriptions of each course, we had no idea what we were eating so relied on the servers explanation. Unfortunately, it was so rushed and quickly presented that it wasn't the best experience.(3) I *love* doing omakase everywhere I've traveled. For those who don't do it as often, sure, it's always a nice reminder of proper omakase etiquette. However, the tact and manner in which that is done is SO important. My boyfriend was halfway eating his nigiri, like legit was in his mouth and about to bite it in half to try it, when a server walked by to pull his plate (WTF! He wasn't even done eating) and say to him \"Hey boss, one bite\" and stared at him with the piece of nigiri half in his mouth. Excuse me, but if someone wants to eat a certain way, don't interrupt in the MOST AWKWARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE fashion. Perhaps wait until he's finished eating and then come to pull his plate when he's done and then remind us \"a little history on the art of omakase\" or something. But what was done to my BF was not only incredibly rude and awkward, but weird... (4) Everyone around us was being served 13 courses, however, we were given the last round unexpectedly when we were one course 10. We had to actually ask the server why we weren't being served the lobster tail, the eel, and the other piece that we obviously didn't know but saw others receive. Can this experience get any more awkward??? The server awkwardly explained that they ran out so we were only going to get 10 dishes instead of 13. WTF?! Then we had to awkwardly ask if we'd get charged the price we were quoted for the omakase set menu ($150). SO AWKWARD I'M OVERUSING THE WORD. It's understandable if running out of fish happens, but it honestly should have been respectfully communicated in the beginning. We were all disappointed thinking we were getting some of the plates we saw coming out only to confusingly be presented with \"the last plate\" for the night.(5) After many great plates, the last dish was an over-salted salmon skin handroll that seemed and tasted so out of place. I *love* handrolls, don't get me wrong, but this tasted reminiscent of something I could pick up from the 711. No one in my party enjoyed it. They should rethink the last dish to end on a note that is equivalent to their other dishes.Overall, though the dish plates were interesting (salmon pâté was bomb!! and so was the combination of the papaya with toro), the actual experience itself was probably one of the worst I've had for a $$$$ omakase restaurant. When you pay that much for your fish, you expect it to come with the whole shabang because omakase truly is a magical experience when done right. Unfortunately, Sushi Sasabune will likely remain on the bottom of my list which is a bummer given it has so much potential to be amazing."}, {"review_id": "EA2QESsZ41E_VzdSuiP0cQ", "user_id": "vL4pIBCRJyNR153iZEJQgQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Oh my gosh! Best Omakase experience ever! I loved every piece of fish that they presented. Me and my husband pretty much ate until we were about to throw up.  They were so good and so fresh. We just couldn't stop. I was at my happy place.  We even enjoyed mackerel that we usually don't eat. Every sushi piece one bite size. We sat at the bar so food was delivered immediately after it was made all the time. Therefore we were able to taste the crispiness of seaweed in a hand roll.

What an incredible experience (as you can tell from my copious photos and notes on each plate.) Omakase is intense, come hungry and open to new experiences. It's totally based on personal taste and preferences but we liked most of what was served. My husband and I differed on our favorites but know it was a meal we won't forget. The two chefs were very personable and without me asking, they read my facial expression to the amount of wasabi used in each sushi piece and adjusted - perfection. The rest of the staff was also attentive and lovely.Parking in this neighborhood was a little weird so we ended up paying at a nearby lot.Tip: one of the ladies requested to skip certain fish and asked to stop when she got full. Since there was no official menu to choose from we weren't sure how many more items there would be so we rolled with it...and then they had to roll us out the door because we were so full haha jk!"}, {"review_id": "nRKJe8O0ihtDCpPjVE6yVw", "user_id": "gdbEJZ46_U2CKZYUh2iNCg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "So to start, always recommend making reservations as it's almost impossible to get a seat otherwise.

Omakase for two, without any flavored beverages or alcohol that might mask the flavors of the quality ingredients used in the sushi was $273. After tipping at 15%, expect to pay $157 per person for omakase, but remember this does not include any beverages (outside of the ice water that was provided), nor does it include any desserts. Expect to pay more if alcohol is ordered.The quality and texture of the seafood used was in short - excellent! I have never had scallops, ika and yes even octopus that literally melted in your mouth. However, for the price, I found the fat content in the otoro and salmon good, but not great. Don't get me wrong it was very respectable, but for these prices I expected my eyes to involuntarily close and moans of pleasure softly murmur out of my mouth - that didn't happen.The high-light for me was found in the amazing VARIETY that SS provides: ahi carpachio - a well-balanced and pretty dish, ika stuff with crab - the roasted sesame seeds take this dish over the top, Argentinian shrimp - unexpected texture for raw shrimp, smoked aku - wow wee, octopus - melt in your mouth goodness, and king crab sushi - now that was amazing dish!The low-lights were the raw oysters. Mine was slightly off textured (mushy) and a tad off flavored - a couple of day past fresh I'd say. Some of the sauces over powered the natural flavors of the seafood which to me should be the stars of the show, not the sauce. Too many sweet sauces used in succession for my palette, breaking them up more with contrasting flavors (i.e., salty, sour) would have made the flavors pop more. Contrasting the textures would also have been more appreciated by me, but in all fairness perhaps not even notice or even wanted by most. Almost everything was soft, melt in your mouth which was nice, but offsetting this with crunchy and yes even chewy at times would have added welcomed contrast and added to overall oral dinning experience.Overall, SS served a terrific meal, one that I enjoyed and very much appreciated, but for the price I expected more and don't believe that their ROI is on point.Tips:SS is open for lunch from 12-2pm. Go then to avoid the crowds, the need to reserve weeks in advance, and enjoy very attentive service!If ordering omakase, SS asks that you give them 3-days notice and to allow yourself 90-minutes to enjoy that meal.Ample parking can also be found in the back of the building, that is free during lunch service."}, {"review_id": "rFo90xK9CWf--t6IvLp1yQ", "user_id": "bAUAQS_PHAIml-i1zptuNQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/19/2017", "text": "I'm feeling special!!

We did our Valentine's dinner here when we were in Oahu and this was the best value and best sushi I've had in Hawaii. I've been to Mitch's and Sushi II, both highly rated places in Oahu, but man, Sushi Sasabune blows both out of the waters!! Make sure you sit at the chef's counter. They only do omakase (chef's choice) so just sit back and enjoy the culinary ride! :) We ordered a few sakes with our meal, and had a great conversation with the couple next to us who were locals and have been coming to Sushi Sasabune for almost 20 years. The omakase doesn't stop until you're full and they'll let you know when it's coming to the end if you want more pieces. We had about 23 different pieces. The appetizers were probably my favorite, with squid stuffed blue crab, and the tuna sashimi in ponzu sauce. Spectacular! The total damage was about $300 for 2 which we were amazed because that quality in SF would run way more and the line would be out the door!! We were able to make a reservation online 2 days before we went. Our friends also had no problems making reservations on the trip in the following days as well. We left full and really happy and we can't stop recommending this place enough to people. We had a late seating at 8:30, and by the end of the night, some of the items were out of stock so my recommendation is to either go early or go at lunch! It was a great experience!!
