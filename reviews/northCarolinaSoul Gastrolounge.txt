The cocktails are great, and the food is even better. Definitely our favorite restaurant in Charlotte. The menu changes a fair bit, but unlike most places, I never have trouble finding several things I like. If you haven't tried the pork belly watermelon tacos - they will change your life. Do. Not. Miss. Them.Remember - they don't take reservations, and there is almost always a 1-2 hour wait. The pro move is to put your name in with the hostess (or use the NoWait app to get on the list), and then go across the street to Peculiar Rabbit or Workman's Friend for a drink while you wait for your name to be called."}, {"review_id": "UoPplpZ56YNUncAfKHqs2A", "user_id": "P-CDkwLa3OueXOlFAAtLkQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Vegetarian options here are limited but delicious. Here's a list of what we ordered with a review:1. Hummus if the day (tahini honey) -This was good but not great! Would've been better if it had a flavourful hit of garlic to it. Not the best. The pita chips that came with it we nice and healthy (since they were baked not fried).2. Eggplant Parmesan skewers -This was the best dish I tried in soul! The eggplant and cheese was cut into perfect chunks and breaded and crisped to perfection. The marinara sauce (which I hope was made in the house and not store bought) was great to accompany the dish. All in all perfect! Must try for everyone.3. Flatbread -Was good. The pesto was delicious although, the honey braised garlic made it somewhat sweet (which is the point) but didn't do anything. If you love cheese and pesto on bread, go for it!Pita sandwich with falafel -Again, a great dish. Nothing innovative here, but a good soft pita with tomatoes and tender tasty falafels. I liked it! Vegetarians will definitely love this one. Dessert - chocolate brioche cake with ice cream -Good warm cake with nuts and tasty caramel syrup to moisten it while the ice cream melts! Good dessert!And after so much food, what we paid was unbelievably reasonable (just $38) ! That's the best part.. it's gourmet food at cheap pricing! I've been waiting to go to this place since forever. Will definitely go back to try other vegetarian options (and the eggplant parmesan skewers as well) :D"}, {"review_id": "acZfU05VDAzUqpKwUAhNkQ", "user_id": "P5Xmi0JUMSorpi1S1TM0qQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "So, I finally made it over here after hearing about it since before I even moved to Charlotte. I love the space and the vibe; it's even cool that it's only accessible via what is essentially a fire-escape ladder. I love the bar that it hovers above (even though I can never remember if it's called Twenty Two or Twenty Three) and I love. Love. LOVE. Plaza Midwood in general. My hopes were high for Soul.My ONE gripe - it's easily the restaurant I've had the toughest time finding gluten-free options in since I've been in Charlotte. I never want to be that person, so I didn't even ask the waiter for suggestions, but I'm not sure I would have been able to hear her anyway - place is LOUD. Boyfriend and I were there on a Wednesday night at 7pm and we could barely hear each other across the small table. Side note: there was about a 45-minute wait. On a random Wednesday night. It's a popular spot.And still, you say, Soul deserves 4 stars? Really, Amy? Well, everything we had was absolutely incredible. As mentioned before, I'm an annoying gluten-free bitch. Even though I didn't eat 1/3 of the ingredients in the pork belly tacos (flour tortilla), the other 2/3 (pork belly and watermelon) were delicious enough that I'm still salivating over them 3 weeks later. Holy eff, that combination is deadly. Sweet, salty, indescribably amazing.Brussel sprouts were some of the best I've ever had. Fries were BANGING. Sushi was decent, but we probably ordered the wrong roll (crunch roll) - some other rolls floating around the restaurant looked better. We only spent about $45 due to the fact that most of the other items had unavoidable gluten. But I can still safely say that I get it, Charlotte. This place is something special."}, {"review_id": "rvzjjZP8odpcR3sxwfLrDg", "user_id": "RTlvmyy3b0EQWZOzJBtojA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Soul Gastrolounge!This is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I've had my last two birthday dinners and countless other dinners here and I love the atmosphere and how diverse and eclectic the menu is. Greek-inspired, Middle Eastern, sushi, southern, there is something for everyone, for the most adventurous palates (Rocky Mountain Oysters) to not so adventurous palates (Soul Grilled Cheese). Since I've tried a variety of tapas here, I'll break them down into my top choices, ones worth trying, and ones that are just not good.MY FAVORITES+Piquillo Peppers on Bruschetta: These taste like mini pizzas! A little difficult to eat but I love the flavors here. I usually get 2 orders and if I have to share, I'll get an additional order. The tomatoes are marinated well and the bread is super crispy. I'll get these EVERY SINGLE TIME.+Godzilla Roll: Not a sushi fan, but this is the best sushi of my life. I don't like the regular sauces it comes with (mayo, eel sauce, & sweet and sour) so I get this with sweet chili sauce instead! A little heavy on the cream cheese but still so so good.+Falafel Pita: I don't like tomatoes in this so I ask them to put tiny pickles instead. Extra tzatziki doesn't hurt either!+Truffle Fries: Hot, crispy, flavored with garlic, truffle oil, and pecorino cheese. Basically amazing.+Banana Phyllo Turnovers: A sweet way to end a delicious meal. I might ask for more ice cream next time.WORTH TRYING+Fried Goat Cheese on Bruschetta: One of my friend's favorites! I prefer the Piquillo Peppers though, cause these are a bit blander than the peppers. Easier to eat though.+Flatbread: With pistachio pesto, truffle whipped goat cheese, honey-braised garlic, and arugula. A little sticky and messy and although I dislike arugula, somehow this combination works. Not something I'd order every time though.+Sashimi Tuna Tacos: While I'm not a fan of most of the components in this (sashimi, tuna, & mayo), every time we're here, this is a must-get item for LA.+Fried Brussels Sprouts: Smells horrible but tastes pretty good. Vegetarians, they cannot leave the bacon off of this.+Daily Specials: Most of the time the daily specials are not vegetarian-friendly so I usually stay away from them. A few months ago, they actually had a vegan special that I tried. It was Linguine with Chantarelle Mushroom & Porcini Cream with Sliced Honey Truffles. Kinda bland but I took it home and after I added a little Sriracha to it.. A++.+Chocolate Brioche Bread Pudding: So I didn't actually order this, it was a little surprise they brought out for my birthday last year and it was really good! Tasted like a delicious, warm brownie.SKIP!+Ahi Tuna Skewers: Ok this goes back to my disdain for tuna in general but I wanted to try something different one time and I did not like this at all. I asked for the tuna to be cooked really well done but apparently it was a request they could not do and the tuna was still red in the middle when I got it. Had they cooked it to my liking, this could have ended up in the \"worth trying\" list.+Anchovy Fries: Nothing special about these.. Breading has no flavor and I don't like the sauce it comes with.+Grilled Caesar: I found the concept to be intriguing but the execution wasn't there for me. It was difficult to eat and there was an extremely heavy anchovy flavor in the dressing.+Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos: Seriously this is their best seller?! LA and I found it to be all hype. The pork belly and the watermelon were ok separately I guess but together? YUCK. I hated the texture and flavor of everything together. The soggy flour tortilla was useless too. I know I'm in the minority here but if it's not good, I'm not going to lie and say that it is.OTHER TAPAS I'VE TRIED (1-5 star rating)Eggplant Parmesan Skewers (****)Babaganoush (****)Spicy Feta Dip (***)Chimichurri Beef Skewers (***)Soul Grilled Cheese (***)Spanakopita (***)Dirty South Nachos (***)MY TO TRY LIST (for the future)Salmon-o-pita, Saganaki, Ki Roll (vegan sushi!), Hamachi with Jalapeño, Eel Roll, Guacamole Stack, Country Greek Salad, Midwood Mixed Greens, Taramosalata, Marinated Spanish White Anchovies on Bruschetta, Cupcake of the DayThe seasonal cocktails are interesting and worth trying. Some of them are like wtf (in size and/or taste) but others can be really good. Servers are friendly and it's nice that some of them remember me even if several months go by in between my visits.Yes there might be a long wait. This place is tiny and popular. I usually get here after peak times so I've never waited more than 30-45 minutes. Just download the Nowait app. If I have to wait, I'll just walk over to the Common Market (about 5 min walk) and grab a beer or a small snack. Pay attention to your phone though! I think they hold your table for 5-10 minutes once they send you a text that it's ready.Thanks to anyone who read my novel.Looking forward to my next visit to Soul!!"}, {"review_id": "1tmoMy_XpMR00P6LpHIN3w", "user_id": "RBNPf_GF8dWlWPxWvkyJXw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Soul is, hands-down, my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. It's a delicious spot, with a funky vibe, and always makes for a great date night (or just food adventure)! There are so many staples on their menu that you want to order again and again, but you also want to make room to try some new items as well! Some of my favorite include the pork belly tacos, the lamb lollipops, any of their sushi and their chocolate bread pudding! The bone marrow is also melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and they'll let you take the bone home as a dog treat as well! The Rocky Mountain oysters are something that only sounds intimidating, but in reality, they are perfectly breaded and fried, very similar in taste and texture to a fried oyster. Even writing a review about their food makes me want to make my next reservation now! There is always a wait for this place, but trust me, it is completely worth it.

This was one of the places highest on my list to try after moving to Charlotte! My girlfriend and I had a weekend visit from one of our other friends who is super into food, so we saw this as the perfect chance to give it a shot.They don't take reservations at Soul G so we went later on a Friday night (around 9:30 PM) expecting it to be a little crowded. We ended up having to wait around 10-15 minutes to be seated so we were all good there.While waiting, we each ordered a cocktail. The only things I remember about the cocktail was that it was mezcal-based (because I love it), and that it was room temperature. It was NOT good. Not a great start.Once we were seated, that's when it really went downhill for us. We were seated in the back corner right next to the DJ and right underneath a speaker blaring music. The music was BUMPING and not in a good way. It was crazy loud and way too much volume for a dinner. I get it was Friday night around 9:30 but we were screaming at each other from across the table. Not fun. I'm not sure exactly what vibe they were going for here. We did ask the server if it was possible to get the music turned down a tad but I'm not sure he ever got to it.LUCKILY, the food we ordered was actually pretty good and we were able to scream approval to one another after most of the dishes.Asian Glazed pork belly tacos - 4/5 - You might see pictures of this all over the place and rightfully so. That's not a combo I'd really think of but the pork is juicy AF and the watermelon goes great with it. I'm not a huge fan of watermelon in the first place but it worked.Pan Con Tomate - 5/5 - THIS was just awesome. A little bit different take on pan con tomate with spanish chorizo, a rioja reduction, and whipped manchego. As a huge manchego fan, this was a really fun one for me.Bone Marrow - 4/5 - Love me some bone marrow. Tons of flavor but didn't really have all that much to go with the toasts. Tough to split between 3 people.Spanakopita - 3/5 - Eh. It was alright. Served fresh which helped its cause, but I'd say if you aren't craving it, go with something else.Queen Charlotte Roll - 5/5 - YES. tempura shrimp, cucumber, capelin roe. Big time score.Fries - 4/5 - Came with garlic-herb salt, pecorino, and truffle. Some places overdo it on the truffle when it comes to fries but these were pretty good and served fresh.All in all, the food was good here but the rest of the experience was just kinda disappointing. If I come back, I'll do so earlier or on a different night and I suggest if you want to enjoy some conversation that you do the same."}, {"review_id": "712c8ciUm2mgKnlTyRi9zQ", "user_id": "u8HPA-jU1njsPPAI_anMgA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "Finally got here at a time that had no wait!  5:30 pm on Saturday.  Of course we had to sit on the small patio, but the food made it all worthwhile!  And our server, Hailey - best server for sure!  She took the time to explain the whole menu to help my date with her gluten-free choices.  Plus she had recommendations that were awesome!  We had the garlic shrimp skewers (totally tasty!), shrimp ceviche ( in coconut milk!), Dancing Tuna Roll (taste was so good, I wanted to just keep it in my mouth!) and the Guacamole Stack (great concept that really works!).  Can't say much for the decor on the patio, but at least it was warm.  Hopefully next time I'll get to eat inside!Thanks to all my Yelp friends who have recommend this place so strongly!"}, {"review_id": "Kn6K6_EnSnSyzUXj_qJLUA", "user_id": "fBkMdxKevYG1ALZbpjyu6g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "I thought this was a for-profit business but was surprised to learn it has morphed into some sort of artists' colony where the personal expression of a \"mixologist\" is of supreme importance.

To begin with the amazing food? Or no, maybe the awesome vibes. Possibly even the super cool staff. I'm seriously lost y'all hahah. Oh well, let's take this logically from the start! Walking into Soul kind of like walking into this darkly lit rustic speakeasy with a trendy twist to it all. It's old school with a touch of contemporary. The seating inside makes for a great date night setting or a fun night out with a good group of friends. There's outdoor seating on the patio as well which is what my girlfriend and I did. The weather was perfect and it had a nice bustle out there which was much appreciated. To complement this unique setting is the staff - everyone with their own unique personality and equally amazing. Our waiter was super fun and had great recommendations for us on not just food at Soul but also in the Charlotte area. And for a Yelper/ Foodie like me, I thrive off local recommendations. we genuinely enjoyed his company, so much so we held him in conversation and stopped him from even getting to his other tables. Oops? On to the food! And I'm gonna get straight to the point. Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos. They are everything. That is all. No but seriously just get them because you won't regret it one bit. The flavoring was a perfect tangy sweet and sour and the watermelon added a very interesting touch to the profile.  I'm not that big of a pork belly fan to begin with so y'all I'm serious haha. I also had the Tuna tacos which were also great and my girlfriend had the flatbread which she thoroughly enjoyed. As for the drinks and cocktails - very well made and crafted with attention to detail. They're a little pricey but totally worth it. Try the Sidecar Named Desire! I'll definitely be going back soon to try the rest of the fantastic menu - I got my eyes on those short ribs!"}, {"review_id": "bu2o4ud06Q9qutgkMd0ITw", "user_id": "_fZTjXiLSIrIdlFr1cNJoA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "Completely and utterly blown away.Soul has always been on my list of to-dos, but I think I always found myself going somewhere else because I couldn't find anything super special about this place ... but boy, was I wrong.We came in around 8:30 p.m. on Monday and didn't have to wait, but the place was packed. Seated and greeted immediately, we took a minute to look over the menu and decided on starting with the dip trio; we chose hummus (which I believe was Tahini that day), tzatziki, and some caviar sauce. Despite loving all three of them, the dips lasted us all our courses, and there was still so much leftover at the end.With guidance from our server, we ordered the Korean BBQ wings, dirty nachos and pork belly tacos.The wings were super tender, and the sauce wasn't anything I expected. Honestly, I could've done without the dirty nachos; the chicken skins tasted almost burnt and the pimento cheese seemed to be just melted American. The pork belly tacos were by far my favorite, and they are reasonably hyped. Sweetness of the pork belly was perfectly balanced with the sourness of the watermelon.For dessert, we had the chocolate brioche bread pudding with a miso caramel ice cream. I loved the ice cream because the caramel wasn't too overpowering. The bread pudding itself wasn't too chocolatey either, and the perfect size.Needless to say, will be back, and I can't wait."}, {"review_id": "H_v4kpnn-0dN0EVCBnP1UQ", "user_id": "KtE55izPs1ubJn3ofF2IrA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/9/2017", "text": "This.
