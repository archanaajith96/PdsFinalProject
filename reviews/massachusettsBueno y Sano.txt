I would not want to go a single month without brisket tacos. They have a lot of options and the serving sizes are pretty decent. I highly recommend the tomatillo  sauce. I only wish the house hot sauce was actually hot. The spices are mild and the balance of flavor is bold.     Oh yeah... and they have some of the fastest and most efficient service I have ever seen and the staff are nice."}, {"review_id": "WWgJDmvduWSteGxjG1tV0w", "user_id": "phT_tDrPD49-7rfq0mFZ9Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "I'm so excited I found this little taqueria when I was looking for a place to pick up a quick lunch around my husband's clinic! They have a simple but extensive menu, something for everyone. I liked the veggie burrito more than the chickpea/curry flavored one, but I was just happy they had 3-4 veggie burrito options! It's expensive for a taqueria in Springield, but everything looked and tasted fresh so I can't complain. The line moves fast, so if you're here on your lunch break don't worry when you see a crowd."}, {"review_id": "e-r-l8zzlFL-eH9O_WFZuw", "user_id": "p6NRlrPtvzzcmEO3_77MkA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Best quesadillas, salsa and burritos around.

This place is nestled in a small business complex. The inside is clean, including the bathroom. The employees we interacted with were all helpful and explained the menu basics to us first timers. There are A LOT of interesting and unique burrito flavor options which is exciting because you never get sick of the same thing (as if you could get sick of burritos/tacos in the first place...). Look, there are a lot of burrito chains in the world...but this place has surprisingly unique and fresh flavors. The rice is phenomenal, the salsa options are unique and nothing like any of the other major chains. The prices here are also pretty affordable. I also like that you can pay for the extras (make it grande) or not. Customization is important and appreciated. Overall, will definitely be back here to get my burrito fix, and I'd come here over Chipotle or Qdoba any day.2016-100 Yelp Review Challenge #60"}, {"review_id": "dWC5UvsHLAE_1tYVju5dAw", "user_id": "JebSE87IZrkh3sgrPVvlDw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "11/16/2016", "text": "Well, where do I start? Ok, first let me start by saying that the staff and service was great. They were really nice and I'm sorry that the food just; I honestly just did not like it. Why? It was sooooo salty, like to the point of almost being inedible, and actually; I shouldn't have tried to eat it anyway because later that night I paid the price, and so did another member of my family. I felt so horrible after eating here which kind of defeats the whole \"sano y bueno\" purpose. Guys, excessive sodium is not sano y bueno, it's actually the very opposite. It's such a shame because I really, really wanted to like this place."}, {"review_id": "6B3MSRDQfECelQid7hInJQ", "user_id": "scr48VXWDQNCd-lid0Ttvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Wonderful food with variations of Burritos.

I ordered a burrito bowl to go over the phone. When I arrived, I opened the bag to place a fork inside and I noticed the contents of the burrito bowl had all fallen out inside the bag. I told the girl at the register about the mess and she snapped at me, \"that's because you picked up the bag wrong.\" I didn't know there was a specific way you were supposed to pick up the bag! My bad! To me, it seemed like more of a packaging problem.She then proceeded to fix the issue with her bare hands, without washing them, and there was food still all over the inside of the bag.

Must've been a matter of semantics. So here is my second attempt. The food is really mediocre. Very little flavor and all items on my taco plate were overcooked. Also the guacamole portion size is egregious. I'm came here under the recommendation of Kieran, my son's karate instructor and my wife's lover. I now realize his recommendation to eat here is the second dirty trick he has pulled on me.
