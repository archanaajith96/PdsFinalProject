The pastries are made with perfection. I love the creme brûlée and key lime pie. The kids continuously beg to come here for the little bags of cookies. I haven't had the chance to try their espresso drinks yet but am looking forward to. The fresh squeezed lemonade in the summer is wonderful. The owner is pleasant and great to work with when placing expensive orders. A definite must try!"}, {"review_id": "Ja4JP230xfW3uKbDieSLjA", "user_id": "e2pevE1L47AfXHfQz2AufQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "This is my absolutely favorite place for coffee and pastries!Also serve excellent salads."}, {"review_id": "iAlHqDutwzHxgLbXMHp86Q", "user_id": "T6tKG4ISb6N2yQSFOx4tPQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/2/2017", "text": "I've walked by Nichole's many times but never tried it until recently; I wanted something different for a change and just happened to be walking by.The only real problem I have with this place? It's too hard to decide what you want.  All the desserts look inviting!  They have cake, pie, cupcakes, scones, brownies and even gelato!  You can't go wrong with any of the superior sweets at Nichole's.If you want some lunch, you've come to the right place.  There's a fair selection of soups and sandwiches too.  It may not be Quizno's or Subway, but the meals will not disappoint.I definitely plan to make a few more trips here to try everything!"}, {"review_id": "iLGeZ1_2Qx0zNcy5sRNv5A", "user_id": "-0yE6872dpKS44c_246QuA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/8/2017", "text": "Good piece of cake , good coffee.  I think it's good atmosphere for coffee and cake.  Usually has a crowd .   Not so impressive  $8.00 for coffee and cake Expensive?

I brought a friend downtown to share a Turkey and Brie sandwich and the cheese tortellini here. Loved the sandwich and will definitely order again and the Brie was perfect! Pasta was good but we ordered too much. A half order is the perfect size to share next time :) Ordered a chai latte (herbal tea) and wasn't disappointed. I enjoy the atmosphere and the panna cotta dessert.

We tried it tonight and I was blown over. I think this is the best bang for the buck in Fargo. Easily equal to anything you can find in a Minneapolis --  St. Paul. Great salad that was big enough for two to share. Chicken liver pate was delicious. I had butternut squash lasagna and my wife had bacon wrapped meatloaf for entrees. We only ate half of it so we'd have room for one of their great pastries for dessert. We split a chocolate Feuillitine, which was incredible with espresso. Will be regulars for dinner after this. The whole meal with a glass of wine and tip was only $63. BTW, menus change weekly."}, {"review_id": "5E-bwYnT3ZjaRMZN8O8rSA", "user_id": "W7tynA41di2VbXxeh4YIqg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/15/2017", "text": "The food/coffee are amazing.

I didn't give it a 5 because I just didn't want to sit down and hang out here. Maybe it was the flat service. It was prompt and efficient but just not friendly and warm. I took my stuff to go and left feeling. Well. Flat. Now that being said the croissant was pretty good very flaky but also kind of dry so meh. I took the lemon bar to go and it was rather pricy. So service is everything to me especially at a counter service patisserie.
