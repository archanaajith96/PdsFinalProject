Our server, Kate was exceptional. She was attentive without being overbearing and was there when we needed anything. I opted for two appetizers for my meal; a delicious scallop dish with gnocchi and a champagne fondue. The hubby had chicken Marsala. My scallops were perfectly cooked and the gnocchi were incredibly light. His chicken we perfect - very moist and the sauce was delicious. Our desserts were also a delight; he had strawberry ice cream and I had the molten chocolate cake. Yes, it's an oldie but it was prepared with coconut sorbet and it was a lovely combination.We will go back for a special occasion as our dining out budget is tight but this is one of our choices for an excellent meal in Missoula."}, {"review_id": "sCWA6kVrNP0yo8qEtiYZQw", "user_id": "kvOSXmjrRtBfX8F6rWgsTA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "Ordered the cheese board, chicken Marsala and New York, as well as deserts (presentation was not great, but tasty).   Cheese board was lack luster, chicken Marsala was dull and tasteless, New York was tough.    Total bill was $150, should have been $30 for the taste.  Service was good.  Wine was also good, cheers."}, {"review_id": "ZUPKE5NUnKEd5gze48CbYg", "user_id": "CEoMgtYwcskmU6VOeDAwVw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/7/2017", "text": "I was pretty disappointed.

There was a live band but they were rehearsing during dinner hours instead of playing so the constant start and stop was interesting.We had the smoked chicken empanadas. I did not like the sauce and the texture of the filling was a little too ground and off putting for me. I had the vegetarian plate which I thought was too salty. Husband had the burger which was fine, nothing remarkable in either a good or bad sense.Food was pricey. Service was good.

We got reservations for 7pm and were wowed with the ambiance of the place. It was classy and elegant and the staff was so nice. They did a great job explaining the tastes of the plates to us so we could get a feel for what we wanted to order. We had their roasted pork belly for an appetizer with a south western chili sauce. It was zesty and cut through the fattiness of the pork belly and the crunch they were able to get on the pork belly was so good! The price we paid for our meals was well worth the dining experience."}, {"review_id": "9gW-elND4thIe9gTqerGSA", "user_id": "HrYnVEIe3v0_539WhPDCQQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2016", "text": "Still my go-to in Missoula!

Whether fancy or not, 5 stars require an experience that exceeds my expectations. That is the case here.I stopped in because of the prior review of the bison tenderloin. By the way, I ordered it and it was better than advertised. The meat was tender and flavorful. It was placed on grilled vegetables and potatoes. Every thing was better than expected.  What I particularly enjoyed about this place was the service. This is a wine bar. After I ordered the bison, I asked the server for a recommendation for a wine. We discussed the wines available by the the glass. She made a recommendation and I tasted it. In fact she gave me a taste of at least five different wines before I made my choice. I am not sure I have previously been provided so many and such good choices. Fabulous food, great wine and wonderful service make a spectacular evening."}, {"review_id": "TKIvnlixsu49n2-XuDU09w", "user_id": "XEjlx3s-C2G1j7UfAkL-qw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/9/2017", "text": "The Red Bird is one of my favorite restaurants, and I am never disappointed.  The service is always excellent and the waitstaff is knowledgeable about the menu and wine selections.  The crab cakes are delectable as is the Middle Eastern Pita and Shrimp Salad.  And for chocolate lovers, the Molten Chocolate Cake is sinfully delicious.  It can get a little noisy, but that is the sign of a popular restaurant.
