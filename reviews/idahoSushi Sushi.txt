Con: Sushi Sushi doesn't have all you can eat.Pros: the food was absolutely delicious. We had five of us so we tries lots of different kinds and shared wuth everyone. Not only were they delicious and very reasonably priced for sushi, they came out to our table very beautifully decorated. I noticed my head turning a couple times to get a better look at what other customers ordered because of how decorative their dishes were.I highly recommend. Fun, innovative, delicious sushi!"}, {"review_id": "Q6rRzLnyZHw1stsNWmdHiQ", "user_id": "iqpSkSV9MwscDuwBNMfTGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Good sushi, service and experience.  Not quite as good as Ahi Sushi in Eagle (ID), but still damn good for the Boise area."}, {"review_id": "k90F90hgNsKNG7oxMCApLw", "user_id": "P-llxhScdegNv4IXQdGZbQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Really good sushi here. Their prices are mostly competitive. It's probably a dollar more than other spots I've been to. The service is well and very friendly. Lots of good options and variety too. I feel like when you go to a sushi joint, they serve the same rolls with the same names, but this place definitely has their own menu and I definitely am impressed with that! One downfall, they don't have an all-you-can-eat menu which is HUGE for my husband and myself because we are such big fans of sushi."}, {"review_id": "voLM_NjS-1ua0F77qUjAKg", "user_id": "27ocFgaTnAMJwTgcVWkaKA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/27/2017", "text": "Best Sushi in Nampa and it's not even close!! My wife and I discovered this amazing gem while shopping at CostCo and I don't think we'll ever go anywhere else for sushi! From the moment you come in, the staff is welcoming and excited to see you. Within seconds, they are politely greeting you and taking orders for your drinks. Also, I love how they make sure you never run out of whatever you are drinking, promptly asking if you'd like more the moment your cup is near the bottom.Let's talk about the sushi here! It's fabulous, I've had their Rainbow, Las Vegas, Alaska, Crunchy, Rock n Roll, and my personal favorite, their Dragon Roll. Each one of these plates are SUPER DELICIOUS and the presentation on the plate is beyond beautiful. The chef knows how to wow their customer but this is simply the beginning. The tastes are beyond amazing! I have yet to try a roll and be disappointed. Each one is full of flavor and super fresh. Don't know how they do it but it's amazing! HIGHLY recommend this Sushi restaurant to anyone is the area. I have nothing but high praise for this establishment! Love everything about it!"}, {"review_id": "9mAvWhMbBT3XYHT5jdsOSw", "user_id": "Evkti2x_lcDlVrc0qys63Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Best place for Sushi in Nampa.

Look out Nampa, sushi is being taken to a new level. I can here with my husband based on a yelp recommendation and we left super satisfied.

I just moved out here from Phx and was so worried I'd have a hard time finding a decent sushi place here (Although I love this area, I've been having a hard time finding good food here or even a decent selection).

Food was delicious. We were able to catch the hours for their lunch specials.  Service was great. Went at a busy time. Though the server forgot our water and hot tea, they apologized for it and gave the hot tea on the house.

We got there at 3:20 and there was no where in the store that showed the hours for happy hour. The money wasn't the reason for the gripe but for a new place trying to grow their business and having no where in the store or menu a list of their hours it was a pretty poor start to the experience.After that their menu didn't share how many pieces came in their rolls. A 12 dollar roll only had 6 pieces in it. So be prepared to overpay to be full. I also got a basic roll for 4 dollars and it had 5 pieces in that. Everything we got on the menu was overpriced and underwhelming portions.All in all not the best sushi in town and overpriced for what food and creativity you get in a sushi roll"}, {"review_id": "BHZd8OlDCh5Ug7GQI2U1Tg", "user_id": "2117PeEyB9rp8-FKVOOfgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "Awesome Spider Roll and probably the best Miso soup I've ever had.

We sat for almost an hour before we even got any of our dinner Didn't even get our appetizer until the END of our dinner. My husband never got his food at all. Waited for 20 minutes for a refill on a drink. They brought my husband his soup (which is the ONLY thing they brought him) and never brought me mine until I asked if I could have the soup I ordered. AWFUL. Don't expect to have your food in a reasonable time frame or at all actually.
