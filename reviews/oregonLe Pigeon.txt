I don't even know where to start, but just reminiscing about the meal makes me want to go back. Soon.My boyfriend and I didn't get the tasting menu (although I wish we did), but still enjoyed everything that we got. We were also just extremely hungry because we got there at 8 PM and waited almost an hour and a half to be seated - so either 1) make a reservation or 2) if you want to get seated at the bar, get there early.The dishes we ordered in good to most amazing:1) BEEF CHEEK BOURGUIGNON (4/5)The beef cheeks were extremely tender, and succulent and moist. But this was honestly a little too heavy for me. I wish there was a littleeee bit less reduction sauce because it just drenched the broccoli and was a bit on the salty side for me. 2) CRISPY SWEETBREADS (5/5)I didn't really know what I was eating, but I know that it tasted damn good.3.) TOTAL RECALL NOODLES (5/5)Basically dry ramen noodles with a chili oil sauce topped with some BOMB crispy prawns. Honestly just a flavor explosion in my mouth.4.) SPECIAL OF THE NIGHT (5/5)Halibut topped over a bed of potato gnocci with some pesto. My oh my, fish never tasted so good. The halibut literally melted in my mouth.Overall, a super amazing experience. I definitely would want to come back and try the tasting menu because that also looks pretty amazing!"}, {"review_id": "PLO5dx8OUMy2hNGcbal-zg", "user_id": "xew1y9flaSKgdn4oxmcgGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Have you ever had a magical meal? A meal where the combination of presentation, smells, tastes, and textures combine to make the food before into a work of art? This was our experience at Le Pigeon. As per our server's recommendation, we opted to do the five course tasting meal. Each course was phenomenal; serving sizes were not small as you sometimes get when there's numerous dishes. We began with the scallop crudo, which had many flavors (spicy, creamy, tangy) that worked well together. Next came foie gras paired with goat- I must admit that I hesitated here; duck liver, and the cute little barnyard animal?! However, both the smells and presentation were so enticing that I could not resist. The foie gras was rich and decadent, and the goat interesting and tasty. Our next delight was the halibut with mustard flowers. The fish was so fresh that it didn't even taste like fish at all! Our fourth course required more adventurous eating as it was pigeon; the restaurant's namesake. I have never eaten  poultry like this before; it was almost like eating a beef filet in redness and taste. Being the meatatarian that I am, I found it delicious! However, I must admit that I could only eat one chicken heart; I was too weirded out by the texture, I think. Last but not least, came dessert. We were treated to the foie gras profiteroles and the lemon poppy chiffon cheesecake (that had lots of other wonderfulness). Foie gras as dessert you ask?! All I can say is don't judge until you try- the consistency, texture and richness was like no other ice cream I've ever had. These delectable creations were served by the most knowledgeable and attentive staff. Considering the incredibly high quality of the food, the generous servings, and the expertise of both the chefs and waitstaff, we actually felt the meal was quite reasonably priced. If you find yourself in Portland, have an adventurous palate, and appreciate extravagant dining experiences, do not miss Le Pigeon. Do be sure to get a reservation far in advance ( although I have to be honest, I found a spot on open table at 5:15 day of!)."}, {"review_id": "QqaxxI4Fd4KB94O1nsS5_Q", "user_id": "jZp4F2aUy7uMbk-Xqk7-8Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "You were exactly what I expected you to be.  We were looking for a place to eat and opened up my yelp bookmarks to see what was in the area.  Le Pigeon popped up but wasnt sure how long the wait would be, so we gave them a call and they were able to get us a table for 3 in less than 30!  yasss! You walk in and the space is pretty tight but feels like a cozy little home. You spot a kitchen area to your right and seating area to your left. We ordered a bottle of wine and started with a couple of appetizers. Seared Foie Gras -- 5/5 wow.. all those flavors with the shitake mushrooms.. so well balanced!! Scallop Crudo -- 5/5 another wow!! never tasted anything like it. i was blown away! Main Dish: Crispy Lamb shoulder was what I ordered.  Loved the crisp on the outside and as you bite into it, how tender and juicy the meat was.  Personally.. the main dish was good but I thought the appetizers were what blew me over the edge.We ended the night with creme brulee and more foie gras from the dessert menu and what a great choice that was.

The service was impeccable, but the food... the food is UNFORGETTABLE. This place was highly recommended by a few friends who are from Portland. We tried coming here the first time we visited but the reservations were full a month in advance. This time, we just decided to come on a Friday night right when they open at 5 pm. We got lucky and had bar seating at the chefs counter. I honestly think that it's the best seat in the house. Being able to watch all the action in the kitchen and smell all the delightful dishes about to be served. **You're going to want extra bread to soak up and wipe every plate clean** First dish was the Alaskan King Crab which was served with crab creme fraiche, leek, bone marrow, meyer lemon, fried potato, and trout roe. This dish was so good I had to order an extra to go to a friend I was meeting up with. She also licked the box clean. If you're lucky enough to try this dish, do it. Second dish was the Foie Gras Wonton Soup that was served with ginger-duck consomme, pork, pigeon & foie wonton, seared foie gras, and enoki mushrooms. Light, rich, well balanced, perfectly salted perfection. Third dish was the Duck a l'Orange with orange & sunchoke glazed pekin duck breast, crispy confit, foie gras-sunchoke hummus, orange and black pepper ricotta, and rosemary oranges. The duck was cooked to perfection. Every little extra bit of deliciousness on this plate made me so happy. Yes, I also wiped this plate clean with a slice of bread. Dessert. FOIE GRAS PROFITEROLES. How in heaven did I get so lucky to try this dish? If you get a chance, please do yourself a favor and order this. Even if you're not a foie gras fan, you will learn to love it through this dish. It's sitting on a bed of caramel sauce and sea salt. Trust me, you won't go wrong. I sat at the counter eating shaking my head in disbelief that every dish was so delicious. My heart wanted to marry every dish. I wanted to shrink the chef and put him in my pocket so I could take him home to make me these dishes. I love this place. Please, try to eat here. You won't regret it."}, {"review_id": "IU6Gacxk8gDN4J4l8OUDMw", "user_id": "HItG90EUhG31atkOtJuluQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "My favorite restaurant in Portland hands-down!

They are only open for dinner with limited capacity.What we ordered:- Grilled pigeon $39: blue cheese, beet tortellini, beef tongue, broccoli, black garlic, walnuts - this is a must get! How can you come to Le Pigeon and not get le Pigeon? It wasn't what I expected because there was a lot going on in this plate but the flavors and textures blended very well and it was one very tasty dish. - Persimmon & ranch glazed pork short ribs $39: burnt cabbage, apple & ranch salad, persimmon chutney, white cheddar - my best friend ordered this and it was A-OK- Foie gras profiteroles $15: caramel sauce, sea salt - must get! foie gras in dessert covered in caramel, enough said.

Le Pigeon was a stand out. Not only was the food creative and delicious, what really blew my mind was the non-alcoholic drink pairing. I don't drink so I usually end up with water. Unless they make their own soda or mocktail. However, even when a restaurant makes their own NA drinks, when I do a tasting menu the NA paring usually is just some form of juices. That is not the case here. They did not hold back. For every dish that I got, I got a drink that was thoughtfully prepared. Yes, I know it's called a drink paring and it should be this way. Unfortunately, that is never the case. Even at Farm Spirit, I had 1 drink paring for 3 dishes/courses and just about every paring was kombucha. Not at Le Pigeon. The drinks ranged from horchata to gin and tonic to red wine to a coke float. And yes, they were all non-alcoholic. It was fun, exciting and most importantly, each drink paired well with each dish.I can go on and on about how impressed I was but honestly you just have to go experience it yourself. Just the NA paring alone will bring me back.

So needless to say, we had to give it a try. This restaurant is very small and has a cute little rustic feel to it. Definitely come with a reservation unless you're trying to sit at the chef's table like we did (first come first serve for the chef's table, I believe). We came through the door as soon as they opened on a Friday night, and only the chef's table was available (the actual tables were all reserved).We did the seven course menu and let me just start off by saying that it's actually a lot of food... we munched on some fast food nearby while we were waiting for the restaurant to open and that was probably our mistake. By the third course I was already starting to feel full. My only complaint with the course menu is that it took a long time to get our food between each course. We were at the restaurant for over three hours before we finally finished our seven course menu. Otherwise, the staff is very friendly and our server was very attentive. I think the experience is really fun, but in terms of food, I feel like there are other places in Portland that could compete for the title of best restaurant in PDX. In the order that they were served, we got to try...* Albacore, Jalapeño, Chutney *This was probably one of my favorite dishes of the night because it was so refreshing. It had a very interesting fruity, Indian spice to it and the salt granules on top were a nice addition. The jalapeños gave it a nice kick and the soft boiled egg on top balanced out the rest of the dish's powerful flavors.* Foie Gras, Dumpling Confit Pigeon, Mushrooms *The seared foie gras was absolutely delectable. The seared exterior gives it a nice textural contrast with the moist, buttery interior. The dumpling sits atop a savory ginger soup that has a gentle and soothing flavor. The dumpling itself didn't taste too special though.* Beef Rigatoni, General Tso's Sauce*This dish was far too flavorful for me. The sauce was overpowering so it made each bite of beef less desirable than the first. Furthermore, it was just pasta so I wasn't too impressed by the end of this dish. * King Salmon *This was another favorite of mine. The salmon fillet is stuffed with some sort of shrimp stuffing. The exterior of the salmon tastes fishier than the interior so it was a nice contrast as you ate more of the salmon. The flavors were lighter in this dish and I really appreciated that after having an overwhelming dish beforehand.* Squab *This dish was a surprise and it actually tasted pretty good. The cut of squab was cooked rare and if they hadn't told me it was squab, I would have thought it was beef. It was moist and tender, absolutely mind blowing! * Crab Apple and Blue Cheese *This was my least favorite dish, probably because I personally think blue cheese is too pungent. It was like, a crab apple stuffed with blue cheese and then whipped blue cheese on the side. It was just too much blue cheese for me. My boyfriend ended up eating half of mine.* Seared Rice Cake and Ice Cream + Foie Gras Profiteroles *There were two parts to dessert, which was really exciting because I was really looking forward to the foie gras profiteroles I saw all over Yelp. The first part of dessert was a seared rice cake topped with cream, a ball of five spice ice cream (cinnamon, nutmeg, all spice, all those other Thanksgiving spices), all atop a pool of yuzu syrup. The yuzu syrup was a very refreshing touch to the dish. The mellow flavor of the rice cake helped balance out the sweetness of the ice cream and cream. The foie gras profiteroles weren't all that I had hoped it would be. I guess I was expecting it to have more flavor, but it's definitely a champion in terms of texture. One bite into the firm and crunchy profiterole presents to you a soft, buttery interior of foie gras."}, {"review_id": "lSPrkCxMYa_1Q3Fe_p8AcA", "user_id": "IKi5cCvrzNqF1RqqXQ5E3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/7/2017", "text": "I loved my dinner experience at Le Pigeon.

It's a small restaurant with a few communal tables and seating near the kitchen. It's also the quality of the food with French techniques that leaves a lasting impression. My husband and I both ordered the Halibut. It's officially not on the menu but listed as a market priced fish special. This delicate fish was gently poached with a melt in your mouth texture. It sat on delicious handmade noodles. It was topped with finely sliced snap peas, carrots, and radishes that resembled thin noodles. There were also smoked scallops too. On the bottom, there was an herb sauce and a buerre blanc-like sauce, which both complemented everything in this dish. I've never had all these ingredients together, but they all harmonized well. With a combination of dim lighting and slight slippage of the garnishes, my photo did not do it justice. Of course, we ordered the famous Foie Gras Profiteroles. Upon first glance, it looks like it will be too sweet, but it's not. The pate a choux was nicely crisp. The foie gras ice cream was rich and buttery. The caramel sauce balanced the more savory and salty components of the dish. Service was excellent. Our server knew the menu well. He recommended a great French Chardonnay, which paired well with the fish. Both the food and service deserve 5 stars. They even ended the meal with chocolate truffles.
