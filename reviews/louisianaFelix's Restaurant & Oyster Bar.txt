I came here with friends to start off my vacation and Bourbon Street shenanigans, so decided on small bites before making our way into the party madness. We waited in line for a good ten minutes before we were seated in the restaurant. We had fried alligator with a sauce that complemented the appetizer and we ended our meal with 12 char-grilled oysters. For the two times I've visited NOLA, char-grilled oysters are a must and Felix's feeds my seafood desires. Bathed in buttery goodness who would deny a plate of oysters.

It really wasn't what I expected. I have never in my life had oysters that were so dirty and poorly shucked (the oysters that I've had from lesser known buffets were cleaner than this!). Each bite was gritty with sand atop the oysters and along the lip of the shell. My party and I had to wipe off the sand with napkins each time. This makes me question whether or not they are  purging their oysters prior to serving (soaking them in clean water to cleanse them, a basic step in oyster prep). The quality of the oysters were sub par. You can tell by the color of the oysters that they were pre-shucked and not freshly shucked. The flavor was still good but quality was left to be desired. The char-grilled oysters came out amazing! They weren't overcooked. The outside layer had a nice grilled crunch to them while the inside was slightly raw. They were all perfectly cooked. I feel like this place is very inconsistent. Our raw oysters came out looking like crap but on my way out I eye-balled someone else's raw oysters and they looked very clean and not gritty with sand. I've had friends eat here and loved it but the experience we got was unfortunately on their \"off day\". It's a shame we didn't get to try their high quality oysters but at least we really enjoyed the char-grilled (should have chosen to order a dozen of these instead!).  Now I'm praying I don't get Vibrio aka flesh eating bacteria, because it would not be worth it over that meal! Oh and service is also mixed as well. The hostess was pleasant and friendly while our waitress was detached and seemed only to perk up when handing over the check."}, {"review_id": "gjQQNlA_Q1PL1F8NLE8Pfw", "user_id": "m8qHVtzs3PypPzc_G7wl4w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "I wanted to try the Chargrilled oysters and actually had Acme bookmarked as the restaurant to go to with all its reviews and whatnot, but our Uber driver suggest Felix's.  Felix's is lottery across the street from Acme.  Both had lines, but Felix's moved a bit faster.  They upstairs, downstairs, bar and food counter seating, which probably helped with the quick turn over and not a long wait.  We probably wanted about 20 minutes.  This gave us time to look around the area where we were lined up and just people watched.  We were seated upstairs out on the patio, which allowed us to people watch down Bourbon Street.  We order the half dozen Chargrilled Oysters, half dozen Oysters Rockerfeller, Shrimps and Grits and the Bayou Platter (a cup of Rice and Beans, Jambalaya, and Crawfish Ettouffee).  Everything was so flavorful and delicious.  I wanted to order another half dozen Chargrilled Oysters, but was too full.  Should've just done it cuz I'm craving it now lol.

The dinner started out with a negative tone. The very first thing our server told us was to get him when we're ready to order.. He also never asked what kind of drinks we wanted and just gave us water and didn't even tell us what the specials were. We noticed the other waiter around us did all of this for every single one of his tables.As for the food it came out unusually quick in under 10 minutes, which I can't complain because the chargrilled oysters were probably the BEST I ever had! Yes you heard me right. In the few years I've been eating chargrilled oysters nothing tops this place's. I even found a small pearl in one. The bread that came with the oysters had a unique tasting butter on it and was the icing on the cake.As for the seafood platter, the shrimp, fries, fish, tarter sauce, and even the coleslaw were all spectacular. & this is coming from someone who doesn't like fried anything! Despite the less than service we received, Felix is a MUST TRY in NOLA for oysters and seafood!! The atmosphere was chill, the rooms were spacious and bright, and it wasn't crazy loud either because the rooms were divided. Out of all the food places in downtown NOLA to choose from, this is a place I would potentially come to eat at again.

For food we got the fried crawfish tails, the blackened gator, and the char grilled oysters. Everything was so good! The crawfish had great flavor and there was plenty of meat in each piece. The gator was something new we tried for the first time and I really liked the flavor of it. I definitely recommend getting it blackened over fried.We also got the seafood ettouffe and the bienville oysters. Both of these were also very flavorful and I definitely recommend these oysters.

Absolutely phenomenal. I would highly recommend everything that we ordered: the blackened alligator, fried crawfish tails, bienville oysters, char-grilled oysters, and the seafood gumbo. Don't let the outside line scare you off; the line moves quick, the dining area is huge, and the food arrives shortly after you've ordered. I'd actually suggest not even ordering a second round of food until you've completely finished the first dishes because the food arrives so soon.

We had already tried Acme so we decided to check out Felix's.It's definitely crowded during peak meal times. We had to sit at the oyster bar, which was ok. People often compare Felix's to Acme. The wait time at Acme is definitely longer during dinner.The wait time to get food can be long. We're not sure why but sometimes it seems like there's a disconnect between the front end staff and kitchen staff. Our oyster bar guy had to flag down the front end staff to check in on the oyster bar customers' orders because even he thought some of the customers were waiting hella long. Our experience might have been a 2-Star if it weren't for the ouster bar guy advocating for his customers. We got oysters in half shell, blackened alligator appetizer, and bowl of gumbo. -- Blackened alligator was interesting. Salty and tasty and tasted like a different sort of chicken? I wouldn't have it everyday but it's definitely worth a try once when in NOLA. Other reviews diss the small portion but maybe alligator is expensive? It's not just Felix's where the alligator appetizer is small.-- Seafood gumbo is solid if you like gumbo. We just like gumbo in general so we ordered it often when we were in NOLA heheh. It's comfort food for sure.-- oh boy, the oysters.... SOOOO.... they were delicious but just not as creamy as Acme. Annnnd we might have gotten a few bad oysters because we had diarrhea for the rest of our NOLA vacation after this meal.
