We had a pretzel burger with Great Lakes BBQ sauce and cheddar, and also a Cleveland Deli sandwich. Both were well balanced, but although the food is good, the real star of the show of course is the beer. Most of the beer served in the restaurant is piped over under the street from their brewing and manufacturing plant, which is across the street. This means it is the freshest way to enjoy Great Lakes Brewery beer. We went out here for a tour of the brew house. It was a very fun and informative tour, and the tour guide was very knowledgeable - both on the history of the Great Lakes Brewing Company and the area in which they do business. Did I mention the tour was only $5 each, AND you get 4 small beers to enjoy as you walk around the area. Definitely worth the experience and a good way to spend a Saturday afternoon. After the tour we went to the restaurant to get some lunch, then went to the gift shop since we were in the area. They have a lot of sustainability principles that they follow which I appreciate, and some of the food used in the restaurant is grown right around the corner at an urban farm. The whole experience makes me a bigger fan of GLBC because the beer speaks for itself."}, {"review_id": "CrS-lWTf1HvINI2DE1YAKQ", "user_id": "3yTk5TMhPBOfvSRxmzSzXQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Come for the beer rather than the food. I have been to the brewery before, but this was my first time eating here. The food is classic bar food. Nothing special but will do the trick if you need sustenance to consume those beers. The beers are great (we each did a flight with 5oz samplers) and there is just pride and excitement that comes along with visiting here if you're a beer lover.Here is what we ordered 1. Vegetable pizza - skip this, not great2. Pretzel with beer sauce - can't ever go wrong 3. Old World Burger - better than pizza, but overall pretty average 4. Fish and chips - average 5. Ravioli - pretty good and would recommend"}, {"review_id": "fBfKlxcrVNOgd7uusm43Fw", "user_id": "3XT_xWbKl-6V9EVPaa1JJg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Stopped in on a Wednesday to get a seat right away. Service was quick and helpful. Menu isn't huge - but covers the basics and has a fun Polish influence!Slightly disappointed in the beer menu as there was only one dark beer on tap (the other was out). Went with the Edmund Fitzgerald, which is a beer I know and like.. however, I have had it before and I was hoping to have something we can't get in Grand Rapids from GLBC but no luck. I had the fish and chips - one large fish that was good - slightly oily.Cheese soup was good!All around just an A-OK experience."}, {"review_id": "ubAUPqRPIX7l82-SxKIzyA", "user_id": "JEgI77zOlzdi-VwBVLUX9g", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "This place is a train wreck when it comes to service.  The servers are full of complaints, loud talking about their environment and generally disinterested in providing even mediocre service to patrons.  Luckily this place is in an airport where folks are often limited or trapped to find food and drink, otherwise this place would go down quicker than an elevator full of big boned Alabama girls.

I ordered takeout on Saturday - a chicken pesto sandwich with a $2 upgrade to a side salad and a burger. First, I know their take out always takes forever so this time I called really early at 12:20pm and was told 20 minutes, knowing better I showed up at 1pm. Order still was not ready and bartender had to go back twice before bringing it out at 1:10pm. I ordered the chicken pesto with the side salad and he first part that was annoying was that my side salad was placed in the same box as the sandwich so the lettuce began welting. Not sure why they wouldn't have placed it a separate container.Then the worst part, I'm starving so o take a bite into my sandwich and it tastes pretty good and then I see it a hair! Ugh!!!! Why???? So needless to say that went  in the trash.Then to the burger that was to be cooked medium well, well it was medium rare. It took 50 minutes for my order they said would take 20 and then they gave me an undercooked burger. So both meals were a complete bust and ended up in the trash. I called Great Lakes and was transferred to a manager, he offered a refund, which is appropriate, but it still doesn't fix the fact that we had to forego lunch."}, {"review_id": "4S4ETFuxZxqHr4dSt-paFw", "user_id": "Nlw4qbIl_1Iz_Aogagv5ew", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Loved the interior and outside seating in the Fall was just perfect!

My boyfriend absolutely loves their beer so we made a pit stop, had some appetizers and enjoyed some of their seasonal brews! I love pretzels wherever I go, these were a bit different than the traditional pub pretzels, worth trying! They give you this amazing mustard with the pretzels, that is what made it! The Christmas Ale is so much better fresh off the tap, definitely worth trying some of their others too. We had no problem getting a seat right away, but I do think you can put your name in online on your way over. There have been others times we had a brief wait.

I've always been a fan of GLBC beer and was excited to check out the restaurant for the first time while visiting from out of state. The restaurant was packed but we managed to quickly get a seat on the patio. The service was a little slow to start but the waitress that took care of us was very friendly.  Everyone in our party ordered a different beer and we were happy with our selections. My boyfriend and I decided to share a Hero Sandwhich and we were glad we shared because it was huge. Others in our party ordered the beer cheese soup, lobster crab cakes, and the grilled cheese Sandwhich and everyone was very pleased with their selections. GLBC does a great job of using local products and lists on the menu where all of the ingredients are from which I loved about it. It was obvious how great are dishes were that the best ingredients are used at a reasonable price. The Hero was delicious and the pub fries were perfect! The restrooms of the restaurant were downstairs which included an old pub looking area which was packed with locals out enjoying a summer afternoon in Cleveland."}, {"review_id": "FjEn6f0VvBgU1mZjtUEqqg", "user_id": "lZx_XOuL5wACxaNtby4JEA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "This one is homey, homie.Got a chance to stop by Great Lakes while we were in Cleveland and I have to say the brewpub is pretty unique and quite cozy feeling. There was a bit of a wait when we visited so we decided to check out the pub downstairs and have a beer while we waited and caught part of the Ohio State vs Michigan game. Great ambiance and the space overall is great. The building seems to be carved out from either a previous home unit and we were seated upstairs with a nice view against a window once our table was ready. For food we shared the Cleveland hero sandwich and the farm stand salad. Sandwich had Pastrami, Genoa salami, Bavarian ham, Muenster, lettuce, tomato, onions, oil, vinegar, rustic Italian bread from Zoss the Swiss Baker. Sandwich was just alright, but have to say that I enjoyed the farm stand salad a bit more featuring grilled pork tenderloin from Dee Jays Meats, Ohio apples, red onion, Montforte bleu cheese, sliced almonds, & Mediterranean mixed greens from Great Lakes Growers. So many components to it, but went together so well.Anyways, they also have pretty good beer here if you didn't know. Definitely would try a pint or two.

I don't really drink alcohol all that often so the beer side of things here I cannot speak to - BUT, the BBQ Chicken farmers salad I had was awesome.  One of the reasons I liked it so much was the subtle use of grilled red onions and also the crumbled blue cheese which was pleasantly understated. (Not too strong long some blues are.)The spinach in the salad tasted fresh and the the bits of bacon and BBQ Chicken was great. Next time I think I'd request double chicken. The staff was very friendly and when they found out that I'm from away they welcomed me to Cleveland with a smile. Great spot and if I drank beer I'd totally come here again - heck, I'd come here again anyhow and next time I'll come at an hour when I can enjoy a brewski.

It was alright, and definitely wasn't the worst brewery tour we've done, but far from great. They had a couple beer samples on the tour, but they seemed super stingy about it, like they were running low on beer and had to ration it.Later on, we tried to get a beer at the taproom. The bar rail was almost empty, so we sat there. The bartender didn't even acknowledge us. And the tap list was so sad... there was ONE taproom exclusive, and the rest was stuff that I can find at any given liquor store back home. I was really hoping for some one-offs or special batches.GLBC does good beer, but I wouldn't bother coming back here, even if I did happen to be in the area."}, {"review_id": "OwtYVq9ch86OXs1QGhK75A", "user_id": "874ovcBJOvWjQP0MCME8Rw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "I am reluctantly here to give this place 3 stars as much as I had hoped for better. Had this review but solely based on our beer, atmosphere, and experience, it would easily be pushing 5 stars.We arrived after a trip to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and were hungry and thirsty for a full meal so we ordered the ramen, the vegan burger, and the nachos with chorizo. Both the vegan burger and nachos were very good and I was happy and surprised to find a vegan option on the menu at this kind of place that was actually super flavorful however, this review starts going down drastically because of the ramen. UGH, the \"ramen\". Had I been a more proactive Yelper before visiting I would have known that the ramen is a disgrace to Japanese cuisine. Can we get a PSA that this ramen is closer to the 15 cent package from Walmart than a brothy, flavorful ramen?? We asked our server how it was and she refrained from mentioning that it was less than authentic and not would your average foodie would consider \"ramen\". Expectations did not meet reality. Anyways, we received ramen, ON A PLATE, like not in a bowl.......with barely any broth. We were honestly so confused. The overall flavor was okay but lacked the general depth of flavor of traditional ramen. My boyfriend has never sent anything back in the history of us dining together but we ended up sending it back and getting it removed from our bill. Our server was less than thrilled about accommodating this request but she inevitably did remove it. We explained to her the situation and that our expectations did not match what we received. It looks like other Yelpers have had similar reactions to this dish. If I was to make any recommendations to Great Lakes, I would remove the item or offer a heads up under the description that this item isn't what you may necessarily expect. *Jumps off soapbox* Overall, our experience was really great and we loved the vibe inside and the pub downstairs. We came in the first place because we are extremely big fans of Great Lakes brews! I would definitely give this place another shot if we are in the area again."}, {"review_id": "EMK1B7uAx5wXTppNMBYgaQ", "user_id": "PEjS7EYRg1cfHyx3r-w0qg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "If you want an amazing Cleveland experience where you get a chance to meet the locals, try absolutely amazing food, and drink the best beer around, then you have to go to Great Lakes Brewing Company.

Stop by GLBC and for just $1, they will shuttle you to and from the game. It is the best thing ever.We actually went so many years in a row with our couple friend, we were regulars with one waitress who was there 20+ years.

Don't worry Mary, we will pass on your love for the bread pudding!GLBC is a place where you will wait for a table but have such an amazing time during that wait.
