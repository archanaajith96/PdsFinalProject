It was closed.. as we continued to debate drive vs eat, we found The Egg and I.   SO glad we did.... so glad Luxury was closed.Great eggs, healthy options, and not so healthy so you get to pick what suits your fancy!!! I had Kale cooler and avocado toast Super yummo Hubby had Denver omelette w country tatersWhile I'm a coffee snob and opt for rich roast coffee, I sampled the hazelnut then ordered it ( even took one for the road!).

I told her \"you have a ridiculous policy.\" She said (as our meal is getting cold while she decides this is the moment she needs to quibble over this) \"we substitute only meat for meat and vegetables for vegetables (heaven only knows what happens in their corporate universe if someone substitutes tomatoes [fruit] for onions [vegetables]), if we didn't do that we'd have to constantly be revising our menu!\"  When I pointed out that in fact they had made the requested substitutions without them having to revise the whole menu, and that most POS (Point of Sale) order entry systems are able to accommodate such substations, her reply was \"that's our corporate policy.\"What made this more striking a contrast to me and my guests was that  in the preceding 2 days they visited Cheyenne, I had taken them out to 3 other local restaurants where not only had the owners of those restaurants cheerfully made substitutions at no charge, but had a sense hospitality which was totally absent in this corporate automaton staffed environment.  One has to wonder how numerous other places are able to be successful without being so silly.  \"It's our corporate policy\" in a situation like this is the kind of indifference which one expects as a caricature of cable companies, airlines, the DMV, or the IRS, not anywhere I would ever again take friends to eat. The manager still didn't \"get it\" so she came back again interrupting our meal to show us the laminated sheet which has highlighted in jaundice maker their \"approved substitions\" (which by the way are not found on the menu).  I  told her that I did not doubt that such a policy existed, but rather it was a bad policy, almost as bad as continuing to argue with customers, disrupting their meals, over such a point.  To be clear, the food was good, nothing great, the waitress good enough, but the management and mindless adherence to \"corporate policy\" means I can't recommend this place to anyone who keeps to a vegetarian diet, avoids pork for religious reasons, or for any reason wants something prepared in any manner other than how \" corporate policy\" has pre-ordained for you.  Restaurants are first and foremost \"a service industry which also sells a product.\"  I had the Veggie Benedict which was okay but not distictive. The mushrooms and artichoke pieces did not have much flavor and are obscured in the Hollandaise sauce.My other guest enjoyed his Patriot Waffle.I hope that the corporate headquarters duly notes that the manager of this branch dutifully charged us an extra $0.79 for the \"addition\" of olives to the $9.89 \"Bacon Avocado scramble minus the bacon.\"  I hope they think it was worth it.  For me it's not the money, not even on a $44.00 breakfast for 3, it's that I will happily pay the same or more elsewhere if they show more interest in making happy customers than being regurgitators of bad corporate policies. No customer wants to pay to be served such rubbish. Were it not for the bad experience today, I'd probably give it 3-4 stars. Under these circumstances stances l can only give 2 stars. Corporate arrogance and corporate indifference does not do the palate any good."}, {"review_id": "qfkjDmt0ncwIxvp_ZWKK0g", "user_id": "vruWpAEgGZQ-bEGuolb2tQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/21/2017", "text": "Oh, The Egg and I. We go way back. Not really, but what a absolutely fantastic establishment. I ate here this past summer while visiting Cheyenne for the weekend. Can I just say, WOW. I ordered the Apple Cinnamon pancake. Now this sounds like a pretty basic pancake. IT'S NOT. Not only is this pancake bigger than my head, it is also the most incredible, tasty, beautiful thing that my tastebuds have ever had the pleasure of tasting. This incredible item has apples imbedded in it making for a delicious surprise in most bites. You'd thing the goodness stops there. BUT WAIT, it is also topped with a cinnamon honey butter that is to die for. Seriously, syrup isn't even needed for this circle of perfection. The restaurant was very clean and had that cute \"Ma and Pop\" feel to it. Our server was very kind and very good at what she does. I would absolutely go here again should I ever find myself in Cheyenne again! They are only open from morning to early afternoon but it's honestly the best place you could choose for breakfast. 10/10."}, {"review_id": "dNFsDpV5VhmZP2wQUlZZag", "user_id": "rSMf-qu3BaULnibxyylW-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/25/2017", "text": "Ordered the Pork Belly Eggs Benedict and my husband got the Berry Cheesecake Stuffed French Toast.

Depends on who is in the back cooking. They are patient with me and a one year old and give me a booth when I ask which is nice. Come here and get the cordon blue skillet and it's not even on the menu anymore and they make it for me. They modify the kids new omelet which is egg whites usually but they use whole eggs for us.  One server is seriously awesome. Brings a small fruit cup for year old so she doesn't destroy the table... most are super nice. Some are new. Been coming here for years and recently once or twice a week.

The downside of this place is their fly problem.  It is worse than being outdoors at a picnic.   It is also longstanding --- this is the third time I've been here in the past couple years where I and my friend had to vigilantly swat flies from the moment we sat down to the moment we left. Today was the worst. There were at least a dozen around our table alone and they were landing all over the window ledge and a pillar nearby.    The waitress today blamed it on the horses in a parade a month ago and said she'd try to locate a fly swatter for the folks at the next table who were trying to use their newspaper to hit them. Maybe it's all the cooks standing outside by the wide open kitchen door?  It's a problem they need to figure out how to address, as it is very unappetizing."}, {"review_id": "h4hbh9v6OMCRRO70KjkzxQ", "user_id": "93cwK4tROZGq8ItSsGgWXA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/2/2017", "text": "When I arrived the hostess helped multiple customers with their bills before asking if I wanted to be seated.
