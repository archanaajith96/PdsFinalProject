With the large windows, the natural lighting makes for a great, bright work environment. At night, it gets pretty dark, so if you need/like well-lit study space, I don't recommend evenings. Also, it can get loud during the evening/night when people come off of work to catch up with friends. Mylos can get busy as any coffee shop can,but usually there will be some stools available to sit along the windows.  I'll usually sit there until a table opens up. Coffee: I usually get the hot Vanilla or Caramel Latte! Cost: $4.50 they offer whole beans, pour over coffee, cold-brew, and espresso-based drinks. Lunch Menu: served starting at 11:30 am daily (some options I've tried)!1. Ham & cheese sandwich is pictured below! I love pickled foods so this sandwich is tastefully unique. If you are not into pickled veggies, I would ask for it to be put on the side.   Ingredients: freckle face farm ham, barnhill orchards tomato, curried cucumber pickles, Dijon and ANP field greens. Cost: $92. Roast chicken sandwich (not pictured) is also very good. Cost:$8 3.  Lentil salad with grilled halloumi $8"}, {"review_id": "1QRqzqJ5tEcL5TlIFTFUew", "user_id": "NzVyhONQ5naUYjQEVYJLZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "Food: 4/5Service: 5/5Atmosphere: 5/5Value: 4/5-------This is my favorite place to study when I'm back at home. Great coffee, great lighting, great tables. They have lots of outlets for the most part, so as long as you have an extender, you should be good. The only downsides to this place are that 1) their internet is pretty terrible, so if you're a student like me who needs to stream lectures occasionally, this is not the place for you, and 2) the prices are a bit high, but everything is lovingly made and delicious, so I don't think you'll mind too much. I guess another downside is that this is one of the only great coffee places in Little Rock (hopefully there will be more soon!), and so everyone and their mother comes here. I stopped by this past weekend with my dad to get some work down, and he got to meet 4 kids I went to high school with. But on a non-Thanksgiving weekend, usually it's not so busy you'll have trouble finding a table."}, {"review_id": "FhvvhNsjIm0tqowqgik1Cg", "user_id": "2_93WZLmyEFAVwDnFpLDoA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/2/2016", "text": "Cute, convenient, calming Artisanal teas and other caffeine concoctions The cold brew and the green tea were both very well created by the barista and were accurate after they described it (I was confused about what to try)Great place to study and hang out.

The coffee is good, if pricey considering the small serving size, and despite the shop's odd shape, there is abundant seating, much of which offers a pristine view of the trendy neighborhood in which the shop is located. Reliable wifi is on hand, and there is no shortage of people taking advantage of it - but an equal number are simply there to socialize, making earbuds a must for anyone who intends to do serious work on their laptop or tablet. One drawback is the selection of food, which is heavy on pastries and light on offerings of substance. But, that's a fairly minor nit to pick with what is otherwise a totally acceptable establishment."}, {"review_id": "FD7MvWIQuzHf_-mHeg5TWA", "user_id": "QPu8RZPPjNMLfxZ6wu0FTw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/24/2016", "text": "My husband and I bother ordered lattes. It took a while to get them however, they were busy so I don't mind a wait. However, when I went to retrieve them they only had one made. I assumed they would call when the other was made. After waiting a few more minutes I went to check on it and they had forgotten it completely. No big deal, it happens. Unfortunately both of our drinks were not hot at all. I can understand my husband's because he was waiting on mine however, mine was just made and still not even warm. The flavor was rich, robust, and incredibly smooth however, I hated that I had to warm it up in the microwave before being able to enjoy it. An employee of the business did reach out and offer a refund in order to correct the mistake. That's incredible customer service and I will return based on that alone!"}, {"review_id": "vNapqYihKRXGpRevmaKFQw", "user_id": "ZoZjbkQTGB0HU1E8EXA7vw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "Really cool spot in a great location!

You can ask if your coffee had friends growing up, or if it was free-range (only joking of course)The coffee is very, very good. The food and drinks are as much locally made and sourced as possible, the take-out cups are nice, the wi-fi is fast - all in all, it's a great, community-minded, trendy popular place. It's also a super-expensive cup of coffee, this morning I got a Cappuccino and a Chai Latte and it ran me $8. The food is even more of a big bucks for bang kind of deal.

I was hoping for more of a \"hint\" of rose. But, still very tasty if you can handle sweet drinks. Mylo is nearly a solid 5-star experience, but the prices were just shockingly high (and I'm from the Bay Area!). $5 cappucino, $6 granola bowl... it could certainly add up as a daily habit.

Mylo Coffee Co is a drive out of the way for me and most. I finally had an afternoon to myself and made the trek from SoMa to Upper Kavanaugh.The next part of this story may shock some, but not others...The cappuccino here is amazing. I can't say awesome as it didn't leave me in a breathless moment of awe, but amazing is suiting for the fine representation of cappuccino glory that was indulged that brisk and windy afternoon.The price though a little high for some was not high for me. To grab a drink of this calibre would require at least airfare to a nation far away. It had me reminiscing of days long past when I actually traversed the streets of Italia.  I sat for a spell studying for a moment. All the while sipping on my well crafted beverage, savoring every instance because it is that good.Despite the ambiance, and chatter of distant conversations I was able to find a quiet and peaceful space near the window. I took it all in, the natural light of the coffee house, the cordial staff, the patrons who wandered in and out, and the busy people and on lookers passing by street side.Their coffee house may be a drive, but it's an escape.  It's an escape from commercialized powerhouses. I saw that some said the house coffee isn't their thing, but you'd be remiss if you didn't try one item on their menu. I chose the cappuccino, and I'm glad I did. I believe that selection will suit me just fine when I make future visits to Mylo Coffee Co on Upper Kavanaugh."}, {"review_id": "bGumw7g6KDKscUiMe6tMWA", "user_id": "QC-hXI-9s5_WWUpOR3_Iew", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/9/2016", "text": "This is a cool urban style coffee shop... trendy foods, coffee, customers and staff. slightly pricey but the Lox & Bagel I got was tasty so i thought it was worth it."}, {"review_id": "X64OhLW7MJXIhwmhYsnRcQ", "user_id": "UW7EfCoEybq8L8AJG9Le0w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/30/2017", "text": "I really liked this place, and probably would give them a 5 star review if it wasn't for the service.

From the scratch made, seasonal food menu, to the in-house roasted coffee beans, they know what's up! Cold brew coffee is usually my standard (I'm usually in too big of a caffeine-pit to wait for a pour over to be made, and then cool down to be a drinkable temperature). When I'm feeling fancy, I'll get a latte. The espresso is always delicious, the milk is never scalded, and the lunch menu is seriously overlooked. My favorite item is the lentil salad--grilled haloumi, those pickles, and it's plenty of food to keep you full. Sometimes, I feel like I'm spending most of my disposable income there ($1.50 for cream cheese?) but I know they pay their employees well for a service industry job, so I usually don't mind. The additional room with the large communal table and plenty of chargers has helped lessen the burden of individual folks taking over 4-tops for hours at a time. You can almost always find parking and a table now. The wi-fi is reliable. The music is almost always good. There are of course plenty of succulents adorning the tables. (what did hipsters do for decor before the resurgence of succulents?) The space is clean, airy, light, and the perfect place to bring out of town visitors or meet a business associate for coffee. There is one bathroom, and you might have to make several attempts before finding it vacant. The chairs are of course uncomfortable--if they weren't people would probably never leave. I often feel that people don't understand the concept of a long, communal table with benches. On more than one occasion, folks have looked positively scandalized when I attempted to join them. Mylo is the only non-chain coffee shop that I know of in Little Rock that is open on Sundays, and for that I salute them. They use the proper glasses for different beverages. They seem to be expanding their savory pastry game. I wish there was a bottomless coffee option, or a refill that was a bit cheaper the second time around. I wish the seats were more ergonomic. I wish that they never ran out of kouign-amanns. I am certainly glad they're here though!"}, {"review_id": "_6PB-BceXJpgNluHwle9aA", "user_id": "3cO_JGueNqOBceuXnMnBag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2017", "text": "Mylo is a roomy shop  with plenty of parking outside.  There is shiny green roaster behind the friendly girl behind the Order Here wooden sign.My name was taken and my espresso was served less than a minute after ordering.  White demitasse with saucer and spoon.  The steam off of the espresso, my first coffee today, is blowing around, but I can't find the source of the air movement.  Creamy body, smell is citrus and raisin.  Taste is sticky sweet bread.  As it cools, the taste and finish are more spicy like a hot tamale candy.According to the barista, their MK2 blend is Guatemala and Ethiopia. .  He recommended other good shops in the area for next time.  People are smiley inside, and I am comfortably caffeinated."}, {"review_id": "vvhN1sJZ24KZNckR46PnXA", "user_id": "2vnRTeuIswvol4AnG16BiA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/23/2016", "text": "for LR, this is pretty fancy coffee.

Menu isn't that extensive either but they do have a couple of unique items like the Rosewater Cappucino. They have an extensive tea menu too. I ended up getting a cold brew which tastes like all the other cold brews I've had. Nothing super special. They do roast their own beans in house too and you can buy a small bag for $12.
