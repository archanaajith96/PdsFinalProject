We had the hash brown bacon and cheddar waffles, Hueros Rancheros and French Toast casserole between the 5 of us (my 3 older children and husband and I) and wow. First off the food is extremely fresh. Just mind blowing fresh. Second? Their customer service is the best I have seen (restaurant wise) in the Bridgeport/Fairfield area (we saw them help out/feed a person in need while here as well...just amazing). So nice to us as first timers, even brought over a whole plate of huge homemade chocolate chip cookies. We love it here and will be back again for sure!"}, {"review_id": "3myKFbph04BGEKQSeWoWDQ", "user_id": "W2-xAuN434ndW607YxYYkg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/20/2017", "text": "The staff is so friendly and helpful. Today was my first time coming for breakfast and it was a wonderful experience!  The staff were so friendly and helpful and the sample of the hamburger quiche they had out was delicious. I ordered the hash brown waffle with bacon and cheddar. It takes about 15 minutes to make but I had the time to wait and I'm so glad I did!! That was the BEST breakfast that I've ever had in Bridgeport. I also ordered hot tea which comes in a cute mug when you are eating in. Very homey. Music is also great! Oldies very calming."}, {"review_id": "TUEp85B4QUHafnWC0dtYog", "user_id": "jMeFteT1cDsdNok4TvaydQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/1/2017", "text": "Stopped here to grab coffee and a snack. Lots of yummy cakes and cupcakes to choose from but as it's still early, I opted for a cookie to wash down with coffee. The place was close to empty with two other folks seated at a table so I got attentive personal service. The counter staff showed me all the pastry options and patiently took my order. Brought everything out really fast but forgot my water.I would say this is a great place to get lunch or breakfast if you work around the area. It had a friendly laid back kind of vibe. The menu is not complex or too gourmet. The tables are stocked with puzzles and card games for people who like to hang out. I liked the chocolate chip walnut cookie very much as it tasted fresh and just sweet enough."}, {"review_id": "AfinS0pthkRvIQGotgI03Q", "user_id": "ppG1bSay97AcNH_OQXm8Yg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "They have some great from scratch, made to order breakfast. The morning pie was great with a light and flaky crust. Ours was a little dry since we ordered it without sauce but it was still great. Very friendly staff who were quick to offer to top off your coffee.

The cupcake we got was huge, I think it weighed a couple of pounds (maybe not that heavy), but the cream cheese frosting was so good and not super sweet. The hash brown waffle had bacon inside of it and on top!!! So good."}, {"review_id": "neQ9jVWzHaii16qGwYWlrA", "user_id": "Q4uH1y1tVgYX1K9KZtFf2Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/2/2017", "text": "As I packed up to leave after my first visit to Leisha's, one word came to mind: love. There is a lot of love and effort put into this place and it shows. Iced coffee: excellent, with a chocolately hint (in the beans, not actually chocolate). Breakfast pizza? Count me in. It came on a base that was unexpectedly flaky and buttery. It took me a minute to recognize the flavor as top-notch biscuit dough. Brill! So much better than a breakfast pizza on regular 'za dough.  It came with some hash browns and an egg on top. Sooo good.  That dish alone is worth coming back for, though I want to try their many other enticing items as well.  Don't be put off by the slightly less-than-camera-ready photos of the dishes on Yelp. The food may look a bit shaggy/messy but it's the TASTE that counts!"}, {"review_id": "MlrIX9vPgBpzc6VY01iL8A", "user_id": "3MsUEuzi15gEL5Y4NBAvFA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/14/2017", "text": "Gearing up for a court appearance? Start off with breakfast at Leisha's and you'll be fine. The nicest people! They quietly served up a bagel and coffee for a homeless guy that walked in after me. It's a big cafe, plenty of room to lounge with friends or get to work (they have WiFi). Quiche is outstanding; freshly made in house, today's was kale, mushroom and sundried tomato, served with a side salad. Yum. Excellent espresso coffee. Only downside is parking: it's all metered."}, {"review_id": "20S7_2MGqKFlS1jPB5DeNA", "user_id": "CDejn0TAGeO3Xi8ddoUwNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/1/2017", "text": "Thank you to my fellow Yelpers.  I found this place and chose to try it out because of your reviews!  A very unassuming front to this place.  It is much more than a bakery, as the name would suggest.  I was greeted warmly and upon telling them it was my first time there, they offered me a chocolate chip cookie on the house.  (They do this for all first timers!).  Apparently they have an award winning cookie and like to show it off! The space is very eclectic.  There's a coffee bar/soft drink area to the left, a semi-open kitchen area directly behind the ordering desk and then a very nicely appointed counter area to the right where all the great-looking baked goods can be found.  There were jars containing several different types of cookies and containers displaying many types of baked goods such as cupcakes and various pastries.  They have both breakfast and lunch items (brunch) but I think breakfast items can only be ordered in the morning.  I ordered a Crunchy Bite, green apples, gouda, bacon and a bourbon mustard spread on a many-grain bread.  It comes with sliced apples or a pickle slice.  I had a bag of chips and some of the orange-ginger infused water (unsweetened).  I believe the water type changes daily.  The sandwich was fresh as can be and very delicious.  The water was quite refreshing, as well.  I sat at one of the several tables (countertop looking outside and some outdoor seats available, too) in a great, comfortable space and did some work.  The only rush was that they close at 3 and I got there at 2, but not a word from the workers/owner.   I did meet Leisha who checked on me a few times and wanted to know what I thought of the chocolate chip cookies.  With the caveat that I get chocolate chip cookies from any place I go that bakes them fresh, this was a very good cookie, not the best I've had, but I still look forward to coming back to try the other cookie varieties (and cupcakes) soon!"}, {"review_id": "fCrear41TcyZy9g7NBP4hQ", "user_id": "dfX9XCP62HQOx-9-lvwVzw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Best kept secret in Bridgeport!

The first time was for a quick breakfast sandwich and I wasn't impressed. My fiance has been many times since, and insisted that I give it another chance. I'm glad I did. I tried the hash brown waffle and it was flavorful and crisp, topped off with bacon and a fried egg. The baked goods are outstanding! I feel like I can say that because I've sampled enough of what is offered. In one visit, I tried a doughnut, a cupcake AND a chocolate chip cookie -- don't judge me!

(Starting your morning off with hospitable staff goes a long way!) The staff member (I think she was the owner) answered a few questions we had about the menu, and even engaged in some small talk. I eventually decided on the hash brown waffles which I loved. (Writing this review a couple of weeks later is making me crave them again.)Before we left, I asked for a to-go cup for my latte that I didn't finish. The owner gave me a cup and also informed my friend and I that cookies had just come out of the oven and were offered one on the house (which were delicious). It was a nice touch to an already great experience.If I'm ever in the area again, I would definitely stop by."}, {"review_id": "Y1DJEMf3jILcxKg0BJ3K-g", "user_id": "HeRoJWxVjMBlalPK6mJc8Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Great space, super friendly staff and of course the food is fantastic. I was looking for some breakfast on an off Friday and this came up.  I couldn't remember why I had bookmarked this place until i pulled up the menu and saw 'Hash Brown Waffle' on the menu. So Good (I had the roasted red pepper and garlic).  It's a sliced and diced and riced potato cooked in the waffle iron with all sorts of goodness on the inside and an egg on top; just a fantastic breakfast dish.  Also the coffee was hot, fresh, served in a huge mug, and the staff was conspiring in the kitchen to keep it topped off for me...did I mention they were super nice?  The rest of the baked goods looked great and I brought home some chocolate chip cookies for later - the donuts looked fantastic too except the lady in front of me bought the place out - I'll have to come earlier next time.    I'll be back here again, probably for lunch since all the lunch foods sounded great too."}, {"review_id": "jTZ3O6_rK0Kw0VhvH1uDeQ", "user_id": "ctrXXehj_Ab_4dKSNTRTMQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2017", "text": "I was greeted by a cheery \"Good Morning!\" from the staff and sweet smells of home-baked goodness. As a first timer, I was walked through the menu highlights - hash brown waffle, egg sliders, french toast casserole - all which are made from scratch. I had the garden egg slider on a heavenly biscuit. Biscuit had the perfect amount of buttery crust with a flaky center. I shared a bacon and goat cheese hash brown waffle which served as a great side for the slider (must be shared as it is a large portion or eaten as a meal on its own). Double shot latte with a blast of vanilla was tangy and creamy - served in a big mug that fits cozily in your hand. Finally I was given some complimentary cookies - what a treat - a must do to end this yummy meal."}, {"review_id": "T9lOjgW6mioZPiJG0PjfFw", "user_id": "C2Jx-3H-7F472sc5PEgHOQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/30/2017", "text": "Small and friendly!
