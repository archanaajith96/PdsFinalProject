Our server was nice and attentive. We ordered drinks, queso and 4 tacos- tinga, asada, chorizo and spicy shrimp. The tinga was my favorite. The complimentary salsa and table sauces were all excellent. Very good Mexican food."}, {"review_id": "d6Ygxbx6geV_zQpUx9r3Aw", "user_id": "2SfFeJ-jjDZtHHzDhT4pGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/4/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "My wife says I love tacos more than her. While that is not true this place does rank up there with the loves of my life. All the food is authentic and spicy just how I like it. I think what draws me back here over and over is that you can order your tacos in soft or hard shell. The hard shell is my favorite which are hand made on the spot. This not your El Cheapo taco shell either. Great spot for lunch!Update:  Finally got to go back since the reopened after their roof needed repair. Yep still 5 stars!"}, {"review_id": "Lze5ugDvh44rLQY80PfCfg", "user_id": "rMxlUPm7U79gbG90FYr2hg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/1/2017", "text": "My friend sent me an article about this place when I was complaining about how hard it was to find legit Mexican food in Memphis. So glad I decided to check it out.  I was happy to see that they offered more than one type of hot sauces.  All were delicious I might add.  They also give you complimentary chips and salsa!  I ordered their pastor and steak tacos, and the hubby got the milanesa torta.  The torta was huge!  You can definitely make 2 meals out if it.  Usually when we order milanesa torta from other restaurants, the meat is a cutlet.  Here it's chopped up.  I loved the pastor tacos.  Saucy and fantastic!  In addition to that, I had there elotes.  YUMMY. I ordered their horchata which was good, and you get free refills.  The only downside is the location.  You have to pay for parking which cost $8.  I could've had more tacos with that money!  That sucks, because I could see myself coming here once a week, but because of the parking situation, I may have to look elsewhere to get my street taco fix.*UPDATE*I am bumping this up to 5 stars now that I discovered I can park at the Peabody garage for and hour for $2.Seriously the best place for street tacos and tortas."}, {"review_id": "bYV9_SB9qE89LK8kY-GpmA", "user_id": "N0D0oCXJboNGo-g9SSa83Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Maciel's was amazing. Fast and friendly service and when I mean fast and friendly I really mean it! Multiple servers came to check on us multiple times  which was pleasant to have them fill our drinks and make sure to see if we needed anything. I tried the chicken Tortas which was amazing, wasn't sure about all the toppings but just didn't get jalapeños, tried all the sauces with chips and found a favorite and put it on. The sauce I liked was the creamy green sauce. We got the guacamole which was amazingly fresh and delicious and my husband got the chicken burrito which the only thing he didn't like was how much egg was in it. My suggestion would to be breaking up the egg instead of it being a big hunk. Will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "kx2ErPfZnYaIxWyOKqWxZw", "user_id": "AKK4Vw7eyxxJML2Vy1XzEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Yes!

I didn't really expect super great Mexican food in Memphis but um wow I was wrong? At his place is like... well it's kind of like a small taco shop but it's like HIP. Like wow this is like actually what I imagine a taco shop in LA should look like if there wasn't as much competition. It's nothing too fancy, but they have a nice paint scheme going on and it makes this place look pretty modern.You get a free bowl of tortilla chips and salsa for dining in! Super sweet. Their avocado salsa is also LIT. I love it wow.anyway I ordered a Torta Cubana which I've only had one other time at that hype af taco truck in LA but I have always remembered it and so I wanted to try it again, and not wait two hours for it, and...it's $13 but holy mother of hell this is huge and worth it like... SEE PIC. I can tell you that I wasn't expecting much but this is DEFINITELY on par with the things I've eaten in LA if not better. Maybe a little bit more expensive but Jesus they're generous with the food and it's worth it. Along with the avocado salsa? like this is legit the best food I've had in Memphis yet. If there was one thing that could make me stay, Maciel's would be it.LET ME JUST TELL YOU, I'LL BE COMING BACK. If anyone ever asks me what's good in Memphis like THIS IS THE REAL DEAL.ps their service is on point as well!!! literally what's not to love the answer is nothing, everything is to love here"}, {"review_id": "5Mo5DtU2RKrmnJqCybt3Ng", "user_id": "_L6IfebvmDptTMYbyIBl0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Looking for lunch and saw a long line and thought must be good.

The staff greeted me when we walked in the door and all chipped in to help me get my little guy settled. Multiple servers came by to check on us and cheer up my son. They even helped me feed him and went out of their way to find him a booster seat when one wasn't available in-house. They really treated us like family! I ended up tipping extra after the meal because they were so great. The food was tasty too! Killer chips & salsa. I had the spicy shrimp nachos which were just the right amount of spicy for this gringo ;) Tasty hot sauce options, and my little enjoyed his chicken quesadilla & rice.

I mean I could come in and eat the complimentary chips and salsa all by itself, that's how amazing they are. My fajita chicken taco was good but nothing special. The al pastor tacos are also freaking amazing- to the point where hubby and a friend kept stealing pieces of meat from mine! Monsters. The queso was as expected but nothing special. The torta bread is good but it's not the best I've ever had. I would totes get a torta del pastor, though. Yummm. It's not on the menu but I will have to see if they would make it or not. They also don't have any carnitas, which is surprising for an authentically Mexican place. The Fried Tacos are just the hard shelled tacos that I am too snobby to eat now that I've found real tacos. Even if I didn't find anything else was super special to this location, I would still come back and just get tacos al pastor.
