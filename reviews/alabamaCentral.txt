Wow. The ambience is gorgeous, and we waited at the bar while they got our table ready. I was happy to see a great selection of craft beer (that was inexpensive!) and an extensive menu of hand-crafted cocktails.The food....Where do I start? It was most certainly the best meal I've had in a long time. We started out with several appetizers: a charcuterie board, the pimento cheese and wafers, and the roasted pork belly (which was to die for!). I could have made a meal off the pork belly by itself. For the entree, I got the pork chop and pirogies. It was so good, it made me want to slap my mama. The pork chop was BIG and cut like warm butter. The sauce was phenomenal and the handmade pirogies melted in your mouth. My mother got the short ribs that came on a bed of sun-dried tomato cheese grits.  I tried a bite or two (or seven) from her plate, and I honestly couldn't decide which was better. So, both options were divine.I'm already looking for new opportunities to arrange business in Montgomery so that I can go back to Central. Truly an excellent dining experience."}, {"review_id": "6BVCX4XA--P89wjo_8YXkA", "user_id": "afapBXYTOu34mw_ZFbJd3w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Great ambiance, only ok food, and wayyy overpriced. Stopped in for dinner on a Saturday night on a weekend in Montgomery and won't return. Food: we tried the chicken and the short rib. Chicken was dry, and the short rib was the fattiest short rib I've ever encountered. Could barely eat it! The vegetables and gnocchi on both were good - the saving grace. We were still hungry after our main courses so opted to try two desserts: the peppermint Oreo cheesecake and the chocolate mousse cake. The cake part of the latter was dry but overall the desserts were better than the entrees. Ambiance: very swanky, great for a fancy dinner or a date. Service: friendly, not particularly fast but not super slow. We were able to make a reservation about 2 hours before we stopped by. It was very busy but there were a couple free tables. Value: poor. If I'm going to pay $45 for an entree plus a dessert, it better be great. This didn't make the cut."}, {"review_id": "ZZrPbo28x5OY_be2TVs83w", "user_id": "9fb1LjsbTz_YT81CJLTBRg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Pretty solid place in Montgomery. I give this place a 3.5 stars mainly because of the price, the saltiness of my dish. It's my first time in Montgomery, and wanted to do an early Valentine's day dinner. Central was known to be one of the best downtown (which is where we were staying). We ordered the Old Montgomery and The Mulberry as our cocktails. Both excellent and strong. I liked that the Mulberry has sugar on the rim, yet the drink itself wasn't overly sweet. For the appetizer, we ordered the shrimp and grits. Another great fish. I thought it was way too small for 18 bucks, but I liked their twist of grits.I got the Bricken chicken and S/O got the filet. The chicken was just SO SALTY. The gnocchi was an interesting add in, and gave the dish more flavor, but I was soooo turned off by the chicken. It's not that hard to mess up chicken...S/O thought his steak was good, flavorful, and cooked to his liking. No complaints there!Being from Dallas, Central would be rated an above average restaurant, but nothing superb. Probably won't be back because the prices are not worth it. Good place for Montgomery, but they could do better.

Asked if I could have the onions cooked, instead of thrown on raw (because raw onions give me a head ache, therefore, I don't like raw onions) Apparently,  kitchen wasn't able to cook them up for me, I can imagine that being an aggravating request, so I was told it couldn't happen, so I asked just to leave them off which was fine, buuut, lost some points from me. Regardless, the salad was actually pretty good, and fresh. I also loved the set up and decore of the restaurant.  Parents really enjoyed their meat dishes. Again, a high three. A gem off to the side of run down historical Montgomery.

Nothing on the menu is vegan but asked the waiter what could be made vegan and he came back and said no worries the chef has a dish for you. I didn't even have to order, I was rewarded with an amazing vegetable dish. All seasonal, spring asparagus, Brussels sprouts, morels, peppers, onions, okra and black eyed peas with a over the top spicy tomato broth. Honestly all of the people I was with were jealous of my dish. So as there aren't many choices for vegan food in the area this is one where if you ask you might end up with a very special one of kind dish. Huge thank you to the waiter Antonio and the Chef!"}, {"review_id": "lH_EX-CNYxm3LVmSu9F0vA", "user_id": "JnW0--jJ8Xcg0sJ19TCezg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/19/2017", "text": "Came out here for dinner with my colleague and the atmosphere is amazing and really nice decor.

I was expecting a bigger portion on the poutine but to be honest it was perfect and enough and extremely delicious! They have a great selection of cocktails, wine and beer! For dessert, can't say no the pecan pie that comes with ice cream on top! That was delicious!5 Star food! 10 star service! Great dinner spot!

The sevice was very good as usual.  However, the food didn't meet my expectations.  The flavors were on the spot, but you can't serve rabbit with bones in it. Four bites had bone pieces in them, completely distracting from the dish. When you're paying this price for food this shouldn't happen. I told the server, but not confident it made it to management or the kitchen.  I saw no reduction on the check...not what I would expect for a restaurant that projects itself at this level."}, {"review_id": "7jXTBkM3Url5EFlZnZ_g4A", "user_id": "hrrrYTeiIlx_9J9oq3MbVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "The best spot downtown.

It is a fine dining experience and is on the pricier side. It's a nice place to go for a business dinner or to celebrate birthdays/anniversaries. There is valet parking available for this restaurant as well. The restaurant inside has a rustic upscale look to it and the kitchen is open for you to see what they are making throughout your dinner. I came with a large group and our server did a wonderful job catering to our needs. She was quick and efficient and the meals came out in a timely manner. We ordered Seafood Hush Puppies, Eggs in Purgatory, 1895 Pork and Beans, Butcher's Steak with a side of corn bread and Brussel Sprouts. I did not get to try the Seafood Hush Puppies but they looked delicious and were fried perfectly. Eggs in Purgatory came in a really hot cast iron skillet with a side of grilled ciabatta. The eggs were cooked with smoked pork shoulder and mixed in with a diablo pomodoro sauce. I spread this mixture over my ciabatta and it was very flavorful and hot! The 1895 Pork and Beans and Butcher's Steak were really good as well and the presentation of the meal was superb! I would definitely recommend ordering the Brussel Sprouts. I usually don't like to eat them because they taste bitter to me but this one had some tang to it which I loved. As for dessert, it was difficult to make a decision because all of them looked so good! I ended up ordering the Fruit Loops Creme Brulee based on the server's recommendation. The Creme Brulee  and fruit loops cookie was served on mini butcher's block. It was perfectly sweet and enough to share with my hubby!"}, {"review_id": "EECHRmVYqS8SVvz3LEYQrw", "user_id": "KtI3Yb8QQ1l7s8RmJbCakg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Had a fantastic dining experience tonight.  Melody B sent it over the top with her knowledge of the menu, beer and wine lists as well as the historical aspects of the building.   Beautiful restaurant but also comfortable atmosphere for families.  Very diverse dining crowd.  Great evening."}, {"review_id": "xIDabn8qq_-okaPXw1YR7Q", "user_id": "fEmZAvWCi3jlIfGWr5lGsA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/17/2017", "text": "I come to MGM from ATL often for dinner and dine here EVERY SINGLE TIME.

The place was just amazing from the moment you walk in; the staff were super friendly and attentiveRight away it was a bit warm in there even for winter, they have a huge wood fired oven that many dishes are prepared in - albeit beautiful,  it throws off a ton of heatWe started with baked oysters and the cornbread and sausage. I have to say, I didn't care for the oysters - and the cornbread was good, but not great, kind of dense and heavy. The sausage was good..but not remarkableThey boasted using local ingredients where possible - and especially from the gulf. I had the Fra Diavolo, which I was excited about because it was supposed to have Gulf Redfish, Scallops and Shrimp. It was good, but ultimately disappointing. The shrimp were very small...like almost salad shrimp and when they're cooked they become like hard rubber chew toys. The scallops were delicious - and I forgot there was even red fish in there until I saw some small flakes of it floating around in it. But the shrimp were the real crime here...missed an opportunity to showcase the wonderful gulf shrimp I had come to expect. My friend had gotten the wood fired filet...which I had forgone in favor of wanting to sample the local Gulf offering. OMG - the filet was heavenly. Just delicious is was soft and buttery, it had a nice outer char with wonderful beef flavor and the smoky fire baked right in, and it made my eyes roll back in my head...so good! - So yea...I had some real food envy going on. I ate the scallops out of mine and was done with it. Central is a solid offering - I have a feeling I will be back in Montgomery again and I will be back to Central. Not everything was a hit - and it wasn't perfect but it was very good and I feel worth trying other things on the menu - this is a first class operation downtown and worth a visit."}, {"review_id": "u3scaAFw-EFdeib0Xw3l3A", "user_id": "y3Wt6Nvgw9PvmMysfUTgUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/27/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Update: I went here during my 3.5 week stay over 10 times. I've tried a lot more on the menu and the food was better than my first experience. The drinks though. One of the bartenders, Kayla, developed my favorite drinks on the menu. She deserves mad props. Patrick is also great. I like it when the bartender can talk about the drinks they make and the bartenders where knowledgeable. It was my favorite place in Montgomery. This update is super late, but needed to happen.Overall I enjoyed this restaurant. I am here in Montgomery for work. With the help of help decided to try this place first. I am happy I did. First I'll start with the bad, the food was not as good as the price would suggest. That is why I gave instead of 5 stars. It was still good and satisfying. If this restaurant charged that much in SLC then it would go out of business. I got the catch of the day. I do think that the flavor was pretty basic. That could be just the local clientele demands.I think what they really excel at is their craft cocktails. I have been back a couple more times and have tried all of them. The two note worthy ones are the Salty London Hound and Hemingway and Duvall. This is farm to table place so don't count on them staying forever. The craft cocktails are priced well. I have also had a couple appetizers that were great. So far it's my favorite place in Montgomery, I still have over two weeks left so we'll see."}, {"review_id": "inSu__Q6KwCAj2DpyNjE1Q", "user_id": "tFyMN6_SJzXPQYVxzoKI-A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "8/2/2017", "text": "Do yourself a favor and avoid this place. The beautiful interior belies the poor excuse for dinner we had to tolerate. We had high hopes while reviewing the menu only to be told by our server that the menu was seasonal and some items might not be available. We were not informed which of those items were involved.We placed our orders to find out later that three of our selections (of 5) were not available-on to round two. I ordered the cornbread plate appetizer and the chicken selection for my entree. We waited, and waited, and waited. All of the food came at once. So, we were served two stale pieces of cold cornbread, two pieces on cold pork belly and a piece of pickled okra. My chicken was nothing but a chicken breast with Brussel sprout slaw served on a piece of wood.There were five in our party and none of us were impressed. Aside from the nice decor, the food was not good, way overpriced, and the server was grossly unprepared."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/central-montgomery-3?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
