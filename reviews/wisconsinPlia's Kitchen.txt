It was quite filling and tasty. We also ordered a basil fried rice. I will say the fried rice was some of the best I had. It wasn't too hard or too sticky. The chicken was tender.My only disappointment was spring rolls were \"out\". It was a half hour to closing and the place is smaller.  It was an overall excellent meal."}, {"review_id": "ZATGAGkKI3Fc5AMWRR74fQ", "user_id": "MiFys974fFHdfCo537Te6Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "My first trip here. I didn't know what to expect, it looks like a typical hole-in-the-wall, strip-mall asian eatery. The place is small, no atmosphere, but clean and nice.But the food! Wow, the food is amazing! There were four of us. I got the green curry with tofu, and it tasted SO good! My wife had the drunken noodle with chicken, and she loved it. A friend had a stuffed chicken wing, which she said was delicious! Everyone raved about the food.The place was crowded, with people eagerly waiting for food and even more people getting take-out. There wasn't much in the way of drink options, the guy at the counter actually seemed to discourage drinks, saying that they put water on the tables for everyone. I noticed that most people just had their complimentary water without any other drink. The tables all have a large selection of condiments, which is a nice touch.I'll be back for sure. Not elegant dining by any measure, but it is certainly yummy!"}, {"review_id": "oCUZ2ccUmFAWX-8FC-Eopw", "user_id": "zmr4gUzWiaPeEhIfeKXOvA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "Have you ever caught yourself driving past a restaurant and you say, \"hey I need to check that place out.\"  Yeah I've done that dozens of times with Plia's.  I've had their stuffed chicken wings before at the Farmers Market but never took the time to check out their restaurant.  It's a tiny restaurant, with about six tables inside.  Their menu consists of noodles and curry, plus egg and spring rolls and crab rangoon!  I ordered  take out on a Friday night and it was pretty busy.  Took about 10 minutes  to get the food, which wasn't so bad. I recommend calling ahead as there's not a lot of space to sit and wait.  I ordered the green curry with beef.  For being mild, the curry had enough kick for me but I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food.  I still enjoyed the curry.  Also ordered the crab rangoon.  They're pretty good, but not the best that I had.  There wasn't a lot of filling in it, that was the disappointing part.  I'll be stopping a lot more instead of passing by."}, {"review_id": "MPYtgJVxjX-yVsMCE85cjw", "user_id": "5YYZbf_pPMlP0GEDlKut0w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Ordered lunch for 7 of my coworkers for my birthday.

A nice mild pho recipe, able to be made stronger with beef base or condiments as desired. The Thai basil, bean sprouts, lime and jalapeno were generous. The best selection on table of condiments I've ever seen. The Thai iced tea was on point and \"destination worthy\"  - good body, slightly smokey & sweet, but not too sweet as some are. The offered extra glass of ice water was appreciated. Nice big bowl of pho, likely 1.5 quarts. They offer take nice home styrofoam containers and bags. Noodles we're enough but not out of balance in amount compared to other ingredients. Plenty of beef, tripe, a good number of jumbo shrimp. The meatballs had good flavor but the texture and firmness made me wonder what binders and fillers had been used, maybe a little too much, or too much mixing and pressure during preparation? Prices fair. Stuffed wing was a real treat at the price. Listed as one of the best 3 'readers favorite' places yesterday in the local newspaper. Overall a very, very good offering in little Green Bay WI."}, {"review_id": "ICgxt1lazEmWkm6j_U3xtA", "user_id": "1i8yxNq50j2nHq9aoLXgkw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "We ordered Basil Fried Rice, Drunken Noodle, Pad Thai, and the Seafood Stir Fry along with some apps to eat family style for four people.  We are stuffed and have leftovers!  Everything was delish!

Last night we had the green curry with beef, drunken noodles, egg roll, crab Rangoon, and the stuffed chicken wing. You're probably thinking...that's a lot of food, what is wrong with you? In our defense, it was Linner (lunch and dinner combined), and I had a perfect amount leftover for a midnight snack and breakfast the next morning(I do not discriminate when it comes to breakfast foods). The green curry comes perfectly spiced. No need to ask for spicy-unless if you dare, in that case...GOOD LUCK. Extra spicy green curry from Plia's is not for the faint of heart.

Went with veggies instead of a meat and they upcharged me for that, not sure how that math works. The interaction at the point of order makes it seem they they were doing me a favor when they took my money. The overpriced veggies were cooked within an inch of their life, nothing like expensive, soggy broccoli. I ordered the meal extra spicy and the food had zero heat.

A few takeaways:-they get a good lunch rush and seating is limited-to-go orders are also available -portions are really generous, you might get a few meals out of it!-some dishes are prepared with fish oil, a pretty distinctive taste. Ask if you are concerned about this, they don't have to use it-you control the heat on your dish with the self serve seasonings at your table I was so pleased not only with how delicious my food was, but the amount of leftovers I brought home!

I quickly looked on Yelp for Thai food and this place was recommended. The shop is on the smaller side (only 7 sit down tables) but they do take away. Fortunately I came at a quiet time and was able to get a seat immediately. I ordered some stuffed chicken wings to start and I have to say the exceeded my expectations. The main portion is deboned and stuffed with Asian vegetables and it is barbecued to perfection. For mains, I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and spicy. Having had this in Thailand and many other locations around the world, I was not sure what to expect and given authentic Asian cuisine in the USA is hard to come by I set my expectations low. Well it was fantastic. Perfect blend of flavours. Plenty of chicken and bean sprouts. Rice noodle was perfectly cooked. Would recommend this to anyone looking for something more flavoursome than your typical bland fare."}, {"review_id": "2UsXJQWwByPj8fhaAh_cUQ", "user_id": "su6Tq7u1qy22YGUqy5jjTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/8/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "All sorts of yummy here. Tucked away at the end of a strip mall lies a gem of a restaurant!  I had the Pho Delux and it was so tasty. The broth didnt taste oily and was clean.

It was a treat!  Seating can be a bit limiting but I can't wait to eat here again...maybe for dinner!!Still remains my favorite place to come to.
