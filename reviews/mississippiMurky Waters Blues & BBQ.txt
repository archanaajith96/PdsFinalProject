I came in and was sat immediately and greeted by my waitress. Ordered sweet tea and a combo platter of ribs, brisket, burnt ends, potato salad, baked beans and a side of onion rings . I've been searching for burnt ends mind you so my expectations were high. Sweet tea could've been sweeter. Onion rings were fresh and homemade. Both sides that came with the meal were awesome. Like really awesome beans. Brisket was kinda meh, honestly. It wasn't bad; wasn't outstanding. The ribs weren't great. Seemed microwaved to hell. BUT THE BURNT ENDS! Jesus made these. The rating is for the burnt ends, sides and decent service. My first mind said to only do the burnt ends platter but I wanted to try the other meats. I know better now tho and will return for the BE!Also, there was a serious need for a host/busser. The servers were all but running trying to host, run food, buss and tend to table while taking to-go orders."}, {"review_id": "IA8lJm7TTlVaLsIz_UiPLA", "user_id": "26BRT0-E8XX9-Hher7Evzg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Welp I wanted to try something new so I decided to give this place a try.  Not to busy on a Sunday afternoon.  I ordered the 2meat combo with burnt ends and ribs with a side of \"baked\" potato salad and baked beans.  The ribs seemed boiled - but they were decent after I smothered in BBQ sauce. The burnt ends were AWESOME!   The baked beans were on delicious however,  I don't recommend the potato salad.  It was the worst I ever had. However my server Francis who by the way was friendly, asked me if I would like another side and replaced it with fries which were served piping hot and seasoned well.  Overall a good experience.  I would come back and try again, ordering the burnt ends and a different meat."}, {"review_id": "u9sihrwOZN2191k5flrmIg", "user_id": "IoZfBwHCO244npWM6EVhZA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Working in the area so we're looking for good food. It was crowded so we thought the food would be good. We LOVE bbq. We ordered the pulled pork nachos-the cheese ruined the meat. Couldn't even get the real flavor of the pork.We got a 3 meat combo plate at the waitress' suggestion: pulled chicken, ribs, and sausage. The portions were unremarkable. The flavor bland. The meat on the ribs chewy and tough. The baked beans and okra sides were he highlight of our meal. The food was not commensurate with the prices. Our waitress was sweet but either uninformed or dishonest. Her recommendations weren't on target.Won't return."}, {"review_id": "3bMQHL2O7bqASiCA_S00pA", "user_id": "5RLRdjvwUd6qQFHYxG8EBg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Heard amazing things about this place. Unfortunately the reality didn't live up to the hype. We spent the afternoon drinking and decided to sober up with food and kill time. We got there and I first noticed no booths. Ugh. I love a booth. We were shown our table by our waitress. It was dark and I wish we had sat outside. Clean and open but seems to be the only place on the street. Food: They were out of burnt ends. We got the half nachos, 2 meat combo with chicken and brisket, fried okra and potato salad. The nachos were basic gas station nachos with a bit of Bbq sauce, some pork and some tomatoes. Really disappointing. The ratio of cheese and chips were wrong. Wayyyyy too much cheese. Which normally wouldn't be and issue but the chips were soggy by the end.. The chicken was \"decent\" to my +1 (who LOVES MEAT but I thought it was missing seasoning... but I'm also limiting meat from my diet. I just felt like this wasn't worth it.  The brisket was dry and nothing special. The fried okra was perfectly done. The potato salad was so savory - it really needed some acidity to cut the creaminess."}, {"review_id": "8Q6jv1BdGV_ZRupw25t3cw", "user_id": "0dkY5Xgv8IG4pIE13DbFgw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "If you want bbq this is the place!

Yessss sirrr!Stopped in with co-workers before heading into work while on business off of the Yelp reviews and boi we weren't disappointed... None of us!Our orders were to-go..I got an order of there wings with half of them in sweet BBQ sauce and the other naked, and added there pulled chicken sandwich meal that came with 1 side.. I elected for fried okraOn our way to work, the smell of smoke was \"radiating\" throughout the mini van.. We all couldn't wait to arrive to dive in, it smelled that good!Once at work I dived into mine and I wasn't disappointed! The bread was toasted, buttery, and soft.. The sandwich came with plenty of pulled chicken, and the fried okra was nice and fried properly.. I recommend drizzling the sweet BBQ on the sandwich to top it off! The chicken by itself had decent flavor and \"kinda\" dry but not by much.. The sauce, really helped out along with the buttery soft bread.. Everything complimented each other very well.. I only wish the pulled chicken had a couple notches more of the smokey taste to it, but overall it was good, how it was.. On to the wings! These wings were really good and flavorful.. They are smoked and then flash fried! I liked both sweet BBQ and naked, but I preferred the BBQ jawns \"slightly\"Overall everything was great!! Staff at the bar was friendly as well.. I will be back back for sure if afforded the opportunity.."}, {"review_id": "-qdTh59Tggr2QQ9J438LbQ", "user_id": "TfPoBNbVwDzagjiR3cPX0g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Happened across this place as we spent one night in town.

This place got my vote and best in this area and might make my top 5 around the USA. First, cool name. Night location and they do have music at times and other locations. I had the BBQ chicken and it was cooked to perfection just they way I like it. Great smoke flavor with a crispy crust skin. Then add the sweet BBQ sauce and boom. Great food. My friend had some ribs and they too were great. Had fries and bake beans as the sides and all fit well with what I needed.  Overall, a great place and if you only have time for one BBQ place while in town, don't waste your time anywhere else, you will not find it better than here."}, {"review_id": "jJAvs_eBYFPnfweB97BFlQ", "user_id": "9oXT99Pa2HhhWdS8yoXOBA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/25/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Oh I gots to downgrade this place to 2 stars. Started off at 4 stars and has been steady declining like a 747 with no fuel. ( No passengers on the plane and no pilots or stewardess; disclaimer for the faint of heart). Ordered ten wings on Wednesday night which is their night when wings are their cheapest. Had already finished my burnt ends and sausage cheese appetizer. Told the waitress I wanted 2 To-go boxes, one for my wings and appetizer and one for my wife's food. She said that If I didn't eat at least half my wings that I could not get them for the .69 price but she would have to charge me .99. I said ok well I'll eat half of them. She then came back with one to-go box like I was gone throw the 10 wings in the box anyway. I said I need one more to go box. She said she couldn't give it to me until I ate half my wings. That's when I flipped. I said \"what the hell kind of restaurant y'all running here?\" She said something about \"my boss is watching me\"; yeah tight. Now I did apologize for getting way out of character based on the situation. And left a very good tip but I'm not going to a place that tells me I have to eat my brussel sprouts before I can leave the dinner table. Will continue getting my BBQ from Leathas in Hattiesburg,ms and the Joint and Mcclures in New Orleans. Two places that do consistent BBQ."}, {"review_id": "Wyif4_X8SkE2vGjoiUqnig", "user_id": "swrbPssePOoWnGLg3LuHVQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Used to come here all the time when I lived in Gulfport and was my favorite place to stop in for wings.

We were seated promptly but it took 10 minutes for anyone to notice we were there and 20 minutes just to get drinks on the table.

The food came out super fast, and I got a 1/4 chicken (that was cooked perfectly) with 2 sides of coleslaw and collared greens. The chicken was the perfect size for me and the collared greens even had chunks of meat in it. It was a little less than $10 and definitely worth it!!
