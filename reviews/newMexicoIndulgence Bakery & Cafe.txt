We're not from the area so we were so excited and pleased to stumble upon this terrific little bakery and cafe'! Southwest Bowl and Crepes Rancheros were exceptional but the Brown Butter scone topped it all! Probably the best I've ever had!! Ambiance was quaint and staff was attentive but not too much! Met the owner (daughter of a mother-daughter duo) and she gave us a little history of her shop & great recommendations of things to do in the area! I highly recommend this place!"}, {"review_id": "xq7QGYXMLiGAY2tj32EJRg", "user_id": "T8mpq1i3uoPUty5yOz8m4Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "The service was attentive in that we got our drinks quickly but the breakfast took more than 30 mins to emerge even with few tables in the restaurant occupied. Every time I've been here there has been a similarly long wait so I would hate to see what happens if the restaurant is actually full. Today the food was a little off: southwestern breakfast bowl had burnt potatoes in it, and my latte tasted like the milk was going off. This has not been my experience on other occasions but I would say keep your expectations resonable."}, {"review_id": "-xjp18YyI_6P5bFzxuyXAg", "user_id": "GUCgsrQpJpc3AHWo3eMxKQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/26/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "What an amazing little gem in Las Cruces! The food is spectacular and the service is even better (which is hard to find in this town). I've been here for lunch three times now and I love it. The turkey club is very tasty! I am dying to try the mac and cheese and fried chicken biscuit sandwich but every time I've come, I've been trying to be good!It's definitely worth checking out just know that if you come during the lunch rush you may have to wait a little bit for a table. But, it's totally worth the wait!Update: I continue to come here about once a week and it's always amazing. The ultimate breakfast biscuit sandwich will change your life! The bacon was so perfectly cooked I almost cried! Adding pictures of their new expanded menu!"}, {"review_id": "ZPetiviacFzga0hJX_XFog", "user_id": "gWLdXanCe-vNDnarcQOcZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Best service I've had in such a looooong time, I went in for brunch and had the vegetarian biscuits and gravy  and a side of Mac n cheese  Such a cute place with the cutest workers I had to double up on the tip"}, {"review_id": "WHqS9csnyY4M0MEsc-zsxw", "user_id": "CJW4pIHoXnKvvzxVonUqsA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/5/2017", "text": "After a night of heavy drinking and being eaten alive by mosquitoes I needed some healing from the inside out.

After apologizing I entered the establishment I was immediately welcomed by a friendly waitress. I love that. Coffee was brought and drank. The ultimate breakfast biscuit was ordered. Fried chicken, bacon, egg over easy on a biscuit with gravy?! YES PLEASE!Ample parking, nice bathroom, great service, delicious food. What more can you ask for.From what I understand this is the place making the cake for our wedding this Saturday.

This place has got it all. I mean ALL. The service- impeccable. Kind, friendly, hospitable, and caring. The food- can it get any better? Our mouths are watering, everyone in our party is over the moon with how delicious the food is!The prices- reasonable. Brunch for three was $50The ambiance- beautiful, great layout, while the restaurant was full, we usually forgot we weren't alone. My photos don't do justice but we ordered mushroom crepes, apple blintzes crepes, and the ultimate breakfast biscuit. We all shared and honestly couldn't tell who had the better meal- they were all that uniquely flavorful and amazing."}, {"review_id": "V7iCbcMIwYX8lm_1dhBYLA", "user_id": "dz2ItzCt3DZXmvMuDJA35Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/27/2017", "text": "I can simply not recover from the exhilarating experience of eating at Indulgence. Even my husband walked away wild-eyed with post-Indulgence bliss. We both had the breakfast biscuit, mine a veggie construct and his the traditional version with fried chicken, bacon, and egg. First, let me say that he cannot cotton to a fried egg. Dem b*tches better be scrambled, and they better be scrambled HARD. So when his sammie arrived with a dang-ol unexpected fried one (shoulda been expected based on the menu), I thought \"oh dang. Here we go...\" His eyes grew large with a pinched brow and I said something like \"is it awful?\" He shook his head, though, mouth too full of food and psyche apparently too full of shock and surprise to speak. It's so good! He said at last.That should be enough said, but I got a quick shout-out for our homegurl Audrey, who was marvelously versed in the delectable content of the dessert case and very attentive, anticipating our needs effortlessly. Another huge selling point: 10:30am Sunday morning and there were still plenty of tables open.Btw, the butternut french toast is quite an exploration of flavor. It reminded me of thanksgiving, with the semisweet squash, enhanced by a sprinkling of powdered sugar and caramel drizzle, knocking with awkward elegance against a zesty sage seasoning... just the kind of experimental near-failure I love trying out. Totally worth experiencing for yourself, though at $12 for the plate you might opt to share it with someone else as a side to the $7 breakfast biscuit."}, {"review_id": "vLnKPWgLHBvQlKwxoNDNTg", "user_id": "6NhSfpKtE79yO8LfAGtslQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Stopped by from visiting Mesilla.

As soon as we walked in,  we were greeted every though it was very busy. Our waitress cleaned a table for us and seated us promptly. Simple straight forward menu: that's a plus. Everything sounded good. However, I don't like paper menus because i don't think they're clean. They get passed around from table to table, person to person and they don't get wiped down. We ordered right away. Drinks were served quickly and then we waited and waited. Our waitress kept checking on us and kept our glasses filled, but it took over an hour to get our food. When we did get it, it was fresh and hot. I had the French Dip. Beautiful, fresh warm bread that soft, but held against the jus. The roast beef was beefy and had that perfect bite with melty Swiss. I prefer chunkier fries, but they were still delicious. They were cut shoestring style, made fresh, browned and salted just right. I guess I prefer other fries because I dip my fries in ketchup and I wind up having to use a fork to get the last bit of fries. Anyway, my daughter had the vegan burger with green chile on focaccia. You could smell the fresh roasted green chile before you take a bite. The black bean patty was hearty and beautifully complimented the heat and flavor of the chile. I had the German chocolate cake. You can tell it's made from scratch. Not too coconutty and the coconut had a fresh texture. I could taste pecan, but it doesn't hit you over the head with it. The same with the chocolate ganache and the cake. I assumed that my sister's food was good because her sandwich and cream puff thingies were gone before I could taste them. Definitely, will return, but not sure if I can be late to work again.Note: bathroom very clean, but no paper towels. A warning for guys: a cow will stare at you in the face when you go. Its not uncomfortable though. The cow is cool with it."}, {"review_id": "kVM92TZyPUxg-Cg5alRWKg", "user_id": "d2h114g1FS1Gu4wqnSEPww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "Great place for breakfast, lunch or snack.  Delicious fresh baked goods and coffee.

Nice, open, clean interior with kitschy country decor. Beautiful art by a local artist (Vicky) that we love seeing at the Farmer's Market. Nice menu, not overly extensive ( too much is just too much). Ryan was our server and she was great. Despite being in a bit early for lunch service, she assured us we could get a burger if we wanted ( a member of our group is a GCCB addict). Still, we had Ultimate Breakfast Biscuits and roasted potatoes. These were great! Fresh biscuit, egg, bacon, cheese,gravy and amazingly, a spicy fried chicken breast fillet!! It was waay too much for one setting but, wow, delicious. We had the Strawberry Brioche French Toast, too. Fresh berries in a nice sauce with thick thoroughly cooked toast (soggy french toast is a NO) topped with real whipped cream. Bought a selection of baked goods (cream puffs, lemon-ginger scones , triple lemon cheesecake,& death by chocolate.) Wow! Will be back for more of everything. I'm a tea and scones fan so looking forward to seeing what varieties they bake up. Good food, nice place, great service, yummy baked goods.

Word.I just finished the most delicious, bursting-with-flavor turkey club sandwich I've ever eaten. I've no idea how they prepared the roasted turkey but it is incredible. I did tweak it from the default menu item (cheddar instead of Swiss, no avocado or citrus sauce) but I'm sure many folks will gobble it up as originally designed. The bread was also fantastic.The homemade fries were also terrific (thinner than most homemade fries) and generous in quantity.To finish it off, I had a slice of their 4-layer chocolate cake with Italian creme  cheese icing. Though I was expecting a flavor more near my all-time favorite cake, Italian creme, it was good, too (it tasted more nearly standard icing than Italian creme).My server, Ryan, was great, too...just the right amount of \"How are you doing...everything okay?\".5 star ratings are few and far between from me...Indulgence Bakery & Cafe earned one today!"}, {"review_id": "3SG9pA8e9rzqR0CAP7_JdQ", "user_id": "lp_xvpnTPuXtOX6cmihG_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "Cheese and crackers!!
