If the place is still open, that says something. If the owner (Gorham) is, not only still in business but has created a Portland Food Empire (Mediterranean Exploration Company, MEC), Tasty 'n Sons, Shalom y'all, Tasty 'n Alder, et al. then he must be doing something right (Shhh, he's a f'kin genius!). We were away from PDX for a few years and since we've been back, every time we thought of coming to Toro Bravo, there were long lines and long waits. SO.... we picked a Tuesday at 5pm and in we went.Wine: She started with an albarino blend and I ordered a bottle of J. Christopher's Willamette Valley 'Bravo Blend', a pinot noir that he bottles for Toro Bravo. I know, it's not Spanish but it's a luscious soft light red that goes great with everything. We finished it!1st round Tapas: Roasted Cauliflower with salsa verde/olives (what's not to like), Fried (whole) Spanish Anchovies with crispy lemon peel and fennel (this is the dish I have remembered fondly and it was as good as I remembered, next time I'll order two), Calamari a la Plancha (rich),  and Catalan tomato-rubbed bread. Get an additional 'bread service' so that you can wipe up the awesome sauces.2nd round Raciones: Piquillo Peppers (minced steak, rice, fried shallots, calabrian chiles and cream, stuffed into a sweet red pepper). A bit spicy and soooo good. A small (4oz) house-smoked Coppa Steak with confit potato, olives, caramelized onions and salbitxada (creamy almond/pepper dream sauce). Amazing!Service was excellent! We passed on desert but next time..... So good to be back."}, {"review_id": "OwVEBVdQoPkHxe3xDANAcQ", "user_id": "pHwifw1JFsxT-LC81SWP6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "The food and service were amazing! Our party opted for the Chef's selection and it was a fantastic choice. Here's a rundown of the dishes-Game hen in a curry with nettles: very good-Tuna tartare: very good but needed a bit of salt-Cauliflower with salsa verde : good but could've used more acid-Jamón wrapped dates: amazing. Great combination of savory and sweet-Broccolini with a sunny side egg: fantastic combination-Asparagus with jamón: amazing the crispy jamón gave great texture -paella: flawlessly cooked-sea scallop with a chorizo remolata: absolutely delicious.

Served with warm toasted brioche, a great way to start off a meal.Bacon Wrapped Dates - These were poppable, bite sized and addicting. Our table must've eaten 20 of these suckers.  Bone Marrow - What is not to like? Bone Marrow is like butter. I've rarely had bad bone marrow.Charcuterie Board - Can't not order the charcuterie if it's ever on the menu. However, this one is a really impressive assortment of meats, cheeses, pickles and breads. Not just deli cuts but pates and purees of God knows what, but delicious nonetheless. Really fun to mix and match flavors.Iberico Skirt Steak - Not sure what the heck this was. Looked like a long strip of beef, tasted like intestine but since it's iberico, is it pork? Wouldn't recommend this dishSquid Ink Pasta - Served with a decadent egg yolk in the middle intended to make the dish creamier than it already was. The anchovy sauce wasn't too overpowering. A more subtle tasting pasta.Patatas Bravas - Anywhere I go now, if I see this on the menu, I have to get them. This rendition of the popular Spanish dish did not let down. Served crispy on the outside but soft on the inside tossed in their tomato sauce. Who doesn't like potatoes? Smoked Coppa Steak - More like prime rib with a yellow sauce. Not bad.Paella - The Piece de Resistance, our Paella came with mussels, shrimp, and a half chicken. The rice was cooked perfectly with the outskirts of the pan developing some great texture to the rice."}, {"review_id": "KJCDsE0VlaHEKPhaJkyGQQ", "user_id": "4ORZMxO814akJnLhL1sf_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Toro Bravo easily took the place of my favorite meal while in Portland!My boyfriend and I waited about 20 minutes on Sunday night around 6 for two spots at the chefs counter. Definitely best seat in the house to watch what's going on behind the scenes!The two of us were really indecisive over the menu because everything sounded so good (okay, mainly me..) and settled for four items. Octopus, spinach (for them greeeeenz), the Toro Bravo paella, and seared scallops. The paella was by far my favorite; the rice to seafood ratio was perfect and the rice was so flavorful and rich. They were generous with their seafood portions and each piece of it was really fresh. I usually don't like mussels, but the mussels here definitely got to me. The octopus was also nice and tender; not chewy and rubbery, but enough of a bite. The grilled lemon was a great touch on top. The scallops were also seared really nicely and it was a great way to end the meal. Service was really good and attentive. Our server made sure to check up on us constantly to see if we wanted to add any other dishes. My heart really wanted to say yes, but my stomach was telling me to stop...Can't wait to come back again for more delicious eats! :)"}, {"review_id": "uRszQUI3fShCXFylDeglbg", "user_id": "Kgf1oawdOXGVxYAKb9sGrg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "I think this is officially my favorite restaurant in Portland. I had it bookmarked for awhile and finally got to check it out during my recent girls' trip. We came on a rainy Saturday evening and the wait was ~45 min. It definitely didn't feel that way since we were grabbing drinks at the Secret Society Lounge next door during our wait. We ordered the the Toro Bravo paella, scallops, bone marrow, fried rabbit rib chops and octopus as well as some cocktails. I was a fan of the Basque Kiss.The food was absolutely delicious and surprisingly filling enough for the 4 of us to share. The rice they used for the paella was different than most of the ones I've had in the past and probably the best one I've had thus far. Octopus was flavorful and cooked perfectly - to the point where it's still not excessively chewy but also not too soft. Scallops and bone marrow were on also on point. We were hesitant about ordering the fried rabbit rib chops at first but so glad that we did! Seasoned well and decent number of rib chops.Staff was attentive and parking wasn't too hard to find in the neighborhood. Will absolutely come back next time!"}, {"review_id": "NXrW3gx-ZotfDOD0AzNKOQ", "user_id": "o37bggK_SoP9l8hZxrnemQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Toro bravoTruly a FOOD EXPERIENCE, one of the best dining experiences we've had in a long time.  This was my goal to eat at while visiting Portland. From the Marriott city center, it's about a 45 minute walk across the river and was worth every step. Thank goodness we had to walk back after eating so much.  I could go on, on, and on about experience that we had and it was fantastic. Everything that I had read about informing me to be there early at the first seating was true, they opened at five. We got there at 4:30 and were the first in line as we watch the line it just kept growing and growing.  Since we were the first to be welcomed into the restaurant we get to choose what we wanted to sit so we chose sitting at the bar. Gabriel took great care of us and gave us suggestions and beer, wine but mostly food.We decided to do the chefs choice for the table and that is exactly what I'd recommend. Involves so many yummy wonderful creations. It was like a circus in our mouth. It consisted of about eight or nine different courses, fantastic, so the next time I come back to Portland I have to go back there, loved it, loved everybody that worked there including the hostesses and talk to the chef's for a little, amazing place. I WOULD go back."}, {"review_id": "dyIsm83ml4jEfLS0d_JrfA", "user_id": "bNhfrzuzj9n-DqVGHalKLg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Sometimes Too much hype is not your best friend. Plan well if you want to eat here, it's always crowded and the wait can be ridiculous. Going late on a cold rainy night helps, we only had an hour wait. Like the other Gorham group restaurants, the food is really good and has a slightly different twist. I just wish it was more um  Spanish. The vibe inside is casual, dark, cute space, with a wonderful don quixote painting and an octopus with his big head surveying the scene. The wine by the glass choices are a bit limited but I enjoyed an expensive and full bodied red from Alicante.  I had to get the radicchio salad, different versions found at different restaurants within this group. This was was really delicious served with an olive tapenade crostini. Also anything made in the josper charcoal oven is a standout. It's not always easy to make good octopus but they always do. I personally like the one at tasty and sons better but this one is also expertly prepared, slightly smoky with sweet chewiness. The shrimp were also sweet and delicious. Try anything from the josper. The patatas bravas were not my fave. The brava sauce was a little off for me. Not saying they weren't good, just not the best. Also the caldo verde was a hit. The place is loud and buzzy, feels like a place you want to be. We didn't order the biggest variety of foods so I will definitely be going back to work my way through the menu. Again it was fun and very good bit I went in with sky high expectations. Also the service was excellent and fast even on a crowded night. We had to run so we could jump over to their neighbor, secret society for some cool funk music vibes. Makes for a good night out."}, {"review_id": "b2r6K02u6EDrebWELEHqjQ", "user_id": "mQCAQdPeGTGhHRGmBmsdHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "Really happy to find Toro Bravo on my latest business trip to Portland. They offer a wide variety of Spanish tapas and a tasting menu for $50 per person. We tried the tasting menu and it was fantastic.  If they gave out Michelin stars in Portland, this place would definitely be a contender.  My favorites were the talo (it's like a taco with chorizo and pork belly), the seared scallops (I haven't seen scallops this huge) and the steak (perfectly medium rare).  We also ordered cheese ice cream (it's like someone took a cheesecake and turned it into ice cream and then poured liqueur on it) as a separate dessert and it tastes better than it sounds. Service and ambiance are also A++. The best thing came at the end when the check didn't include a sales tax or a healthy San Francisco surcharge. Highly recommend this place and I can't wait to come here again."}, {"review_id": "xdu0cCvxPGYY08ct86hOyQ", "user_id": "I5BFpbF0sVSUNCA6Y8ZppQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Great place for vegetarians.

We sat at the chefs counter, recommended if you want a glimpse into how hard they work to make each plate perfection. My husband has pretty extensive food allergies and when we told our server she took the menu to the kitchen and made sure to mark every single dish that would not be safe for him. I wish every place did that, there were dishes I was sure would be fine but they had hidden allergens. That really helped put our mind at ease. - truffle flat bread is heaven. So rich and delicious. - cauliflower was great especially if you like olives. - the little gems salad- listen I don't even like salad but this one was so refreshing and crispy. The hazelnuts in it are such a great addition. - the chocolate cake was perfect and gooey in the middle. -highlight for me- the skirt steak. Absolute perfection. Perfectly cooked amazing flavors. - potatoes bravas- was too full to eat. Probably the only thing I'd skip next time.

It was also entertaining searing it on the block ourselves. I would highly, highly recommend this dish*toro bravo paella (chicken, chorizo, shrimp, clams, mussels) - I don't know if I was craving paella after my trip to Barcelona, but regardless this was a solid tasting paella (a tad bit salty however).

Oxtail croquet - was tender yet the crust was nice and crispy.2. Radicchio - looks like cabbage but it's not.  It was 3. roasted cauliflower - This was good and not mushy like some other places.4. asparagus - good but wish it was cooked a little less so that it's not as soft.5. squid ink pasta - has some spice for heat and was #delicious.  The pasta was soft and flavorful.  You crack/break egg and stir it up as the eggs adds an extra texture to it. I recommend getting this.6. octopus - was okay but a bit overpriced for one octopus leg.7. toro bravo paella - had a good balance of seafood, and you mix up the rice while the pan is still hot.8. House smoked coppa steak.  This seems to an item that you must get as a lot of reviews mention this steak.  It was tender, moist and delicious. 9. Basque burnt cheesecake10.

It has an intimate feel and the dim lighting makes a great spot for a date night. I came here on a Wednesday night around 7pm and the place was nearly full - definitely a sign of its popularity. Though it was almost packed, a table for two was being cleared off and I was seated immediately. But keep in mind if it's this busy on a weekday that the weekends must be insane.  I had the Octopus a la Plancha as an appetizer and shared the paella for my entree. The octopus was very tender and along with the sauce on top it was very tasty. The paella was also delicious and was the perfect size to split between two people. The chorizo was a really nice addition to it. It provided some savory spice that was very complimentary to the rest of the seafood. I do wish there was more shrimp but that is a minor complaint. If you do want the paella, order it immediately as it does have a 30-35 minute wait for prep and cooking. I enjoyed my meal here a great deal, and if I visit Portland again I would definitely get the paella from here again but I might try out other appetizer options.
