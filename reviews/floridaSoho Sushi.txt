The staff was really friendly and attentive. We came in toward the end of the night and they let us enjoy our meal and eat dessert without feeling rushed.We ordered Crab Rangoon's for an appetizer and then quite a few rolls for our entree. Spicy tuna, love roll, hot line bling and the candy cane. All were tasty, the candy cane was a spicy roll the waiter said people come in for because of the sauce. It was definitely unique and had a spicy sauce on top that wasn't mayo based.We got the fried Oreo and brownie desserts. A few minutes after telling my Wife I wasn't a huge fan of fried Oreos I stole one off her plate and it turns out it was probably the best I've ever had. They weren't battered and fried with a thick coating. It was like a light breading that held the Oreos together. I would definitely recommend trying them as a dessert!"}, {"review_id": "-ZiguIAG5-YqZkhvlR1X-w", "user_id": "LNeUIkubMxRZxvOmzzg2tg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "You owe it to yourself to try a sushi burrito. It is heaven in a roll of seaweed. I tried the SOHO-rito when I was there and I was blown away. It combines all the deliciousness of a handroll in a one stop roll. Don't be fooled it isn't gimmicky or have any weird toppings (unless you choose to add them) it's just their clever way to market a larger than average hand roll. I am told you can only have this treat at lunch so make sure to carve out time. I also had the gyzoya which was spot on. The gyoza was served on a platter which read (in Japanese) \"Oshee\" (in English yummy) and I couldn't agree more."}, {"review_id": "2pryYE0umWTSnyaRxgxJBQ", "user_id": "fen9BWC39ul9SJZfQ-onpg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Updating a review to give a business five stars is always a pleasure. Soho continuously serves fresh, high quality sushi. Their small parking lot still overflows onto the side street. I recently tried their curbside pickup feature. I stopped by during rush hour and found the lane designated for pickup orders behind the restaurant. Someone came out to let me know the eel roll couldn't be made gluten free. They prep their eel in eel sauce that contains wheat soy sauce. I only waited another five minutes for a replacement. It would've been ready if I had answered their phone calls before arrival. My bad. Getting out and back onto Kennedy wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be. Pretty smooth experience all around. At home I found one roll was made incorrectly but we wolfed it down anyway. My instructions were slightly complicated so I'm not surprised. Regardless of any minor hiccups everything tasted beyond delicious."}, {"review_id": "_88cDiBK_rF0jjU0oshcHw", "user_id": "c-j3TV1F8rI6bQUD6nqGPQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Honestly great sushi!!

Behind the restaurant is where curbside to go is - just make sure to pay attention to signs.I've never had a bad sushi roll. A favorite is the combination fried rice with a side of spicy mayo. You also get a side salad with ginger dressing and miso soup. I've honestly never had a bad item here.

I've been here several times and I can't believe I have forgotten to review before. The sushi has always been super fresh and comes in large portions. There are plenty of options to choose from whether you are looking for something simple or one of the special rolls. Happy hour is from 5-7pm Monday to Friday and they have a few rolls on special ($7-$10) as well as great drink prices ($3-$5 beers, $5 cocktails, etc). This place gets crowded on the weekends and during dinner hours. Parking can be annoying. They have valet but there are not a ton of spots available. The lot itself is very tiny since this place is located in a small strip center on Kennedy Blvd. You can't park across the street anymore and side street parking is most residential by permit only. They have complimentary valet if you choose to use it. You may have to wait a bit to get a seat as well since it is not a giant restaurant. I like sitting at the sushi bar and watching the art of making sushi by their great chefs. Your best bet is to go during offbeat times. Overall, sushi is amazing, drinks are made well and you will not be disappointed dining here. One of the best sushi places in Tampa for sure!"}, {"review_id": "Dcci0nz5b2e-JX5iOFrHhQ", "user_id": "M0AnYyp5EBMryhTNHR8oqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/19/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Still my favorite sushi spot in Tampa.

The candy cane and kiss of fire rolls are standouts, as is the sashimi, and the steamed buns.A thumbs up to the Soho staff... they hustle, and are usually smiling!

I sat at the bar and my server was Emelia. She was very attentive and also helped me to understand the local lay of the land because so many things have been built up here since the 6 year I personally lived here in this area. I started with the appetizer Hatashimono. It was pretty good but not mind blowing but tasted pretty good overall. Next I had the King Kong roll me it was mind blowing! The blend of tuna, krab, panko eel, spicy mayo, ell sauce and tobiko made this my top pick off the menu. I'll have this the next without a doubt! Emelia then recommended another roll called Kiss of Fire. It was a complete opposite of the previous role but had some really great spice and textures going on here. Spicy salmon, tempura trips, asparagus and topped with tuna! It had this really cool garnish that was a mixture of jalapeño and then slices of lemon with a rice wine vinaigrette. Always wash down with two glasses of ZD Pinot Noir. All in all I would highly recommend you go visit the spot the next time you go to Tampa!

We ordered several rolls, appetizers, dessert, and a bottle of wine for our party and all was good. Their spicy tuna and fried rice are always regular orders for us and those were great as expected. We did order the crab rangoon and shrimp tempura this time and those will for sure make their way into our rotation. The crab rangoon has green onion or the like in the mix that gives it a really nice flavor.

The udon was just packed with seafood.The interior is really nice and a place you'd enjoy spending a dinner with people you know. I'm sure they do takeout, but staying in is a great option, depending on parking. There are some spaces out front, but I imagine there are also times it fills up and I'm not sure if there's parking in the back or you're out of luck. We also had prompt service so I'd recommend coming her. My friend claims this is where Derek Jeter gets his sushi, but I can neither confirm or deny this, but she found this a good indicator of quality."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/soho-sushi-tampa?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
