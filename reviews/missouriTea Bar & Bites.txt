Honestly, the place feels like a courtyard in Southern France or Northern Italy, and inside the cozy atmosphere is just as much like something out of old Europe. The $5 oatmeal and the lack of a basic non-sugar mix black chai option make it a little less than perfect, but come on. Where else can you get this unbearable atmosphere and the excellent, scrumptious, goat cheese and rosemary scones? You're not going to find it. Tea Bar is awesome and it's the only place like it in Springfield. Go there, pay a little more than you want to, and tell all your friends about it.

This is the place to be. I couldn't believe I was in Springfield when I stepped in here. It was in high contrast from the rest of the food culture in the area. In a world where consumerist, materialism has high jacked the food industry into a \"profit over people and lively hood\" system. This place takes you back to simpler times and ideas. The food is great. I don't have any recommendations for you to try. Ask what they have and build a dialogue with the staff. They will not lead you astray! I recommend walking to it's location from your current one, parking is  bad from what I hear but that doesn't matter. Park up the street if you have to.

On a nice day, I love eating on the patio at Tea Bar & Bites. And on colder days, the interior (which has little rooms like a house) is warm and cozy. The food is always delicious and well made, and I love getting their tacos on Taco Tuesday (they're a great deal and, considering the quality, the best taco deal in town). Their house wine is also a great deal at Happy Hour. Highly recommended! My only complaint: They're not open on Sundays :-("}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tea-bar-and-bites-springfield-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
