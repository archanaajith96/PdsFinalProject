Not a whiff of smoke in any of the meats. The pulled pork consisted of pork loin (not the fattier shoulder cut) that seemed to have been roasted. Dry and flavorless. The brisket ... oh lordy. It also seemed oven cooked (or maybe even boiled). They sliced it into square pieces, weirdly, and it looked like a little loaf of date nut bread. Again, dry and flavorless. Ribs were the best of a bad lot, no smoke flavor but at least they were the right cut of meat.Sides were pedestrian at best. Beans could have come from a can, and probably did. No meat chunks at all. Most Moms make better broccoli rice. Greens are served only 1 day a week, and not the day we visited.  Free cornbread was dry. Sauces were helpful to add some moisture and flavor, but not special in any way.This was a complete waste of time, money, and calories. The use of the word \"Championship\" in the restaurant's name is inexplicable.  Here is my little rib song for this place: \"I want my money back, money back, money back.\""}, {"review_id": "HlBStWo8Sch9tGCbMC4PQQ", "user_id": "IxOmKyD2OhDyhkjyNIA-Uw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "No liquid smoke here.  They changed ownership 7 weeks ago.  Looks like they aren't cutting any corners technique wise.  Steve, the owner, was in and talked to me while I ate.  Nice guy.  They do a lot of to-go orders for various events."}, {"review_id": "O8pgnE74LZnR5rlqYYVfIw", "user_id": "b2GCD3GtzBcVcxgCounWXw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Phenomenal BBQ in Des Moines, IA?  Umm....YEAH!  This local establishment has an impressive selection of meats, sides, and FREE cornbread.  I stumbled upon this place by accident, while working in the city, and I was obviously blessed by that.  The brisket was equal to anything you'd get from the best places in Texas.  That's no exaggeration.  Tender, moist, impressive smoke ring, and literally melt-in-your-mouth.  The ham I had was also outstanding.  I went carb-heavy on the sides and ordered the cheddar-jalepeno grits and their Mac 'n Cheese.  I'm a sucker for both of those.  Again, extraordinary.  Just can't say enough about the quality here.  Come hungry, because if you're get a combo meal you will definitely leave stuffed and satisfied."}, {"review_id": "XEQ_T2T4XPdKcNknMpSHqw", "user_id": "_n7uMdkur8tvkMXdd8WX2Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Food did not live up to the hype.

It's still only about 4 blocks from Drake campus, so it gets a fair amount of Drake students eating there on the regular.You're greeted by the smell of their smoker once you are within a block of the restaurant, and enveloped by the smell of delicious smoked meats once you set food inside.It's a quaint little place inside, with just a handful of tables. There is also an outside patio area with additional seating when weather allows. There is always a sheet pan of delicious complimentary corn bread along with Iowa honey to accompany it as you walk inside. They have all the standard BBQ fare: smoked pork chops, pulled pork, brisket, ribs, pulled chicken (or whole chicken if you like), and of course wings. They'll even smoke you a whole turkey, if you give them a few days advance notice. My personal favorite is the pulled chicken. It's moist and delicious with lots of smoky flavor. As with all the meats, you can sauce it as much or as little as you like.There are plenty of sides too, ranging from BBQ staples such as cheesy potatoes, cottage  cheese, slaw, and on Wednesdays, my personal favorite: collard greens! There are some less common options too, such as broccoli casserole and cheesy jalapeno grits. There are many more, as well.If you're looking for commercialized BBQ, this probably isn't your place. If however you are after some good stick-to-your-ribs BBQ in a cozy neighborhood, Woody's is the place for you!"}, {"review_id": "epK2cX1oOMqrc7poZfqbrQ", "user_id": "i7XItN6YHqLc5sJhMvnHVQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/21/2017", "text": "Famous Dave's on Merle Hay used to be our go to BBQ place. But now that it's closed (the wdm one is garbage), we are on the hunt for a new BBQ joint. I think we've found it. It was 100 degrees outside, so we were praying there would be a table available inside. Luckily, there was, but their thermostat said it was 86 inside; it was toasty. The food was great. I had the pulled pork; huge portion, soft and yummy bun. My husband had the chicken and burnt ends. He said the burnt ends were great. He also loved the cheesy jalapeño grits. I thought the cheesy potatoes were great too. We loved the free cornbread out in the dining area. There were also lids for the sides we were unable to finish, boxes (I could only finish half of my sandwich), and wet wipes. And, it really is byob. We brought in some beers from home, which truly rounded out a great meal. We will be back!Update: I've removed a star.

This place is a must check out and you will most likely add this to the list of go to places. I will definitely be back. The parking is street parking so it can be challenging to find parking. There is a steady stream of customers picking up food and dining in. There is not a huge amount of seating so you may need to wait. The wait was only 15 minutes on this Saturday. I got a three meat combo with two sides to see what this place had to offer. What they offer is awesome BBQ, this is definitely one of the top BBQ places in Des Moines. The ribs are excellent, tender and fall off the bone with a excellent sweet flavor. I would definitely recommend them. The pulled pork I used for a sandwich and it was exactly as pulled pork should be, slightly smoky flavor, moist, and the bun was fantastic, not dry and heavy, but light. They have two sauce choices and they are both great choices. The beef brisket had an excellent smoke ring and was perfect. I prefer lean brisket and this is exactly what they serve. The brisket was very tender and had excellent smoke flavor. The jalapeño grits are very good, they are hot as you would expect, and they bring the heat, so make sure you have a full glass of tea. The cheesy potatoes were just OK, they could be improved. Free cornbread is a nice addition, can't complain to much I know because it's free, but it was dry, I would have liked it to be moist. The staff are excellent and very friendly and professional. They know the menu and were very efficient in making sure your order is correct. This will be a regular stop when I am in the hood in Des Moines."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/woodys-smoke-shack-des-moines?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
