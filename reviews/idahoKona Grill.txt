This is my 401st Yelp Review. I've been to Kona Grill a few times now and I've enjoyed it each time. The staff is always friendly, upbeat, and top notch. They have a fairly good happy hour (late night, too), ample seating, water/fish displays and a great bar. We ordered drinks and sushi mostly. I had a great time with my Yelpie friends Yulia and Ryan and I had more drinks than food, but both were equally good!  We ordered the King crab crunchy roll, dragon roll, caterpillar roll, and for drinks we had the beez neez, and some Kona Mai Thai's!I've also ordered from Uber eats, right to my door for lunch last week. I highly recommend the Cuban and seasoned fries! If you want to stay home, but have a good meal, that's a good way to order."}, {"review_id": "q8G8GqvOrTE-WJ0sRNkmLw", "user_id": "58ATE98rjY9feTlgylMQTA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "It seems so many people rave about this place, so my wife and I finally ventured out to see for ourselves what's so special. The fish tank is pretty stink in' cool, I gotta say. And this word of compliment comes from an expert in salt water aquariums. I kept my own tank from the age of 19 for several years. With the seafood options abundant on the menu, the colorful array of coral reef natives is a nice touch. Beyond the reef, however, I was a little disappointed. The prices seem out of place in the overall experience. The portions were very small. Our waitress, I'm pretty sure, was a last minute fill-in from the truck stop diner. And I couldn't find much that suited my gluten-free taste. So, I don't think we will be stopping here again. Why should we when there is an abundance of 4 and 5 star places in Meridian? The Yellow Tang was amazing to look at, but in the end she left me high and dry."}, {"review_id": "tuDSfbFGWmGNKmmftflJwg", "user_id": "jCF2lKTngLwbUt1dVg08nw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "I would be giving it a 4 star review for the food but our experience was a bit odd. We came in for happy hour on a Sunday (they have it all day which is great). The place was not that busy but there was no host/hostess to be found. We stood there for about 5 minutes and a server finally came by and told us someone would be right with us. The phone rang multiple times while we waited and no one came to answer. Finally someone came up and told us to seat ourselves for happy hour and acted like we should have known that somehow. There should be a sign to seat yourself or maybe someone standing there doing their job but not a huge deal. We were also brought a couple wrong items and had some incorrect stuff on the bill but our waitress was very nice and fixed the issues and apologized. No apology necessary because I know mistakes happen but it was nice of her to show she cared! Now onto the food. We ordered the spicy shrimp tempura and it was great! Then we got a bunch of sushi. Some of the rolls were discounted so we took advantage of that. We ordered a rainbow roll, checkerboard roll and wave roll. Fish was good quality and the flavor was good. It's definitely a chain restaurant and there are things that could be improved but the food is pretty darn good!"}, {"review_id": "tZNzCL8WHuz9rpeq6YLYfQ", "user_id": "Y-fPeP9dmciMYg83esNSWw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "I go to different restaurants for different things. Meaning, I figure out what it is that a restaurant does really well, and then go back solely for that. The \"thing\" that has me hooked at Kona is their happy hour. Their food is good, but their happy hour prices are what make me choose this place over the slew of other sushi restaurants in the area! They have rolls varying from $5 to (I believe) $8 on their happy hour menu. I usually snag a vegetable roll, spicy tuna, California roll, or if I am feelin' fancy, a bama roll. Other items on their menu that I really enjoy are the avocado egg rolls, potstickers, and the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps. In addition to their food, this restaurant provides a fun and bustling atmosphere. It is a bit loud/busy, so if that is not your speed, I would recommend coming here during their slower hours. I've dined here during both their busy and slower hours, and the service is aways prompt, friendly, and attentive!"}, {"review_id": "v2h6gOror7EQj-iljRY_kg", "user_id": "i9p6aLj4ViVnrmzCw-jcOA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/19/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "They have now CUT HAPPY HOUR BY AN HOUR,  INCREASED prices of happy hour sushi rolls to $9.50 and taken items off happy hour menu.  Used to be regulars,  no more!!

The seared tuna sliders were also good.The location and the food make up for the lack luster cocktails.  We will come back again."}, {"review_id": "kL8kyKuGUBYGomdZMtKJPg", "user_id": "LY3iliLBUyQudytl1YnHag", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Our reservation was at 5 pm.

Honestly,  I feel like nothing has really changed.  The service was so slow and when the food did finally come our kids were brought their food last. As in everyone else was served and your children's pizza will be \" right out. \" Explain that to two hungry boys. I had the checkboard roll and a cucumber salad. The salad was good. The roll was just okay. Nothing to write home about, which I thought surprising because it was flagged as a top pick.I think one of the most annoying things here is the way happy hour works.  You have to sit in the bar area or patio to order from this menu. This means if you aren't there for happy hour, but come during that time there's absolutely no chance you'll get a spot on the patio. As people literally stand in the bar stocking tables waiting for someone to leave. If you would like to order off the happy hour menu, for say a drink , but want to order a dinner item and enjoy piece and quiet in the dining room; you are out of luck. Not allowed. So I guess plan to get there before happy hour, snatch up a table on the patio and sit it out until your ready to eat."}, {"review_id": "2L8EAgOIO3k7Sjnn0ETIsQ", "user_id": "EfGPXR9zev0DGybF-YJmig", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/18/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "came here with my mom for lunch. sat on the heated covered patio that overlooks the fountain and the Christmas tree. very great location, and the restaurant inside is beautifully done.I ordered the sushi combo which comes with 3 pieces of sushi, a full size roll, and a salad for $12.99. i swapped out the california roll it comes with for a shrimp tempura spicy tuna roll for an additional $2. it was very delicious. coming from california, I will say the sushi is just not as good here but it was still very fresh tasting and the rice was cooked and seasoned perfectly! I enjoyed it.the salad it came with had this blue cheese on it that was just so so good. It was a weird combo but it totally worked!my mom had the coconut shrimp roll and OMG it's my new favorite- I will be ordering it every time I go there. if you like coconut shrimp I highly recommend it! and it is a non-raw sushi roll so anyone can get it.I would say the best part about my meal here was our server Jordan. she was so so sweet and accommodating and honestly such a great server, she was super friendly and chatty and made our whole experience even better. I will be sure to ask for her every time I come now!i'm looking forward to coming back!"}, {"review_id": "2lVgswKipW7BUaBkdguz9A", "user_id": "Xm-WiAgNZ038kqabhs0e5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/10/2017", "text": "Kona Grill is good year round but my favorite is in the Autumn. Their Jambalaya is the perfect meal for a cold, rainy Autumn day along with a Kentucky Mule to cool your mouth from the hot, spicy Jambalaya! One thing I like about this place is that even when it gets crowded and the music is on, you can still hear the person across the table from you. Service is friendly and efficient.

This was the first time I went just with a dinner reservation and it was okay. The food was good, and the roll I got was delicious. The part that was disturbing for me was I PAID $18 for a double vodka soda, which was just house vodka!!! At the time I got my bill I was like \"wtf $18???\" That's ridiculous. I was gunna as my server if it was a mistake since my bill said x 2 and I only got one drink, but then I thought, maybe it's x 2 since it was a double? I dunno. I don't think my sushi roll and 1 drink was worth $40, at all.
