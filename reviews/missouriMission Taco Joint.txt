I see it on bumper stickers, I hear about it from friends, but living in West STL County we didn't want to come down to the bustle of the Loop.. well I am so glad we did.We came for lunch on the first warm afternoon of the year (April!). When we left west county there was no wait, but by the time we got to Forest Park the NoWait App has a 14 minute estimate posted. We expected it so I had the app open waiting to add us to the list. We wanted to sit outside, so we opted for the wait even though inside was immediate seating. Parking was kind of difficult to find, the lot they have behind the building was consistently full, so street parking a couple blocks down was the way to go. The host was kind and apologetic for the wait. We noticed a sign that said after 10PM they offer $2 tacos and tequila (awesome! But you can imagine it gets busy on weekends). Once we sat down, we got waters and ordered our queso. Chips don't come complimentary which is kind of a bummer, but the queso was delish! $7 for a large portion with unlimited chips.We sat outside, which was dog friendly, big and small. We loved that, they even give your pup a bowl of water. We ordered 3 tacos each for a total of - 2 shrimp2 Duck 1 fish1 steakThey were all delish but our favorites were the shrimp and the duck.The steak was a good taco, just like any other steak street taco.The fish were really good, light and well executed.The shrimp had a great texture, light and spicy whole the mango salsa cooled.The BBQ Duck was the opposite, heavy and not spicy but more savory and what I felt like would have been the perfect taco for representing STL. Our server was attentive and she kept our waters cold and filled even though the temp was getting up to 80 degrees (40 degrees two days before.. good old STL weather) Fast forward to desert, the CHURROS - O. M. G. THAT SAUCE. We would drive all the way back to the Loop just for that chocolate. Recap:- fish and shrimp tacos- get the churros- bring your pup- use the NoWait app- come early to park the car- remember $2 T&T! (10PM-close)We will be back, MTJ. See you soon! We will bring the doggo next time around!"}, {"review_id": "-84zUryGTElqtF1EhEhyaw", "user_id": "1WtpFqlYRmirOF4xnVRKwA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Great food and great service.  Tried the Zombie drink and it came to the table ON FIRE!!!

Checked in and they told us about an hour wait. This place was really popping and later I found out why (they had dollar shots... I believe). Parking kind of suck. Just need to find street parking somewhere. Service: They had really good service. I had gotten a text from them saying our table was ready. But I had misread and thought it stated that our table would be up soon and that they would text us again. When we finally came in and explained, they hostess was nice enough to try to fit us in. So we waited maybe another 10 mins before getting seated. Food: My husband totally adores this place because he had been here before. And food was great when he had it. Unfortunately, it was okay for me. I had the BBQ duck taco and this vegetarian type of taco. I wanted to try something new and it was kind of a let down. The BBQ duck taco was not great at all. I liked the latter taco. I also tried the baja fish taco, and that was MUCH better. I heard the BBQ duck taco was either a hit-or-miss; I guess I did not have much luck that day. But.. I do want to try this place again."}, {"review_id": "oCHG5HT48Hwn37iAt9hZBw", "user_id": "NH1E_xLsjaeTSBUW8mGwcg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I usually love their portabello tacos, but I ordered their tacos and they reasonably said they would take about 20 minutes to prepare my order (on a Monday evening) and they ended up taking over an hour and a half... to cook mushrooms... my doordash guy was confused because the app gave him so much extra time when it was originally supposed to be delivered much sooner.

I love he waiting area a few doors down - however I wish they had told us when they said \"25-30 min wait\" that people who check in online bump ahead of you. We waited almost an hour. WORTH IT, but unexpected. Shrimp taco is amazing (I hate mango and I ended up ordering a second one!). The fish taco was good and the portobello taco was sooooo flavorful! The house margarita was delicious but go all in and get the jalepeño margarita!!

Stopped by for lunch on a cold December Tuesday and Mission Taco Join was hopping. Like we were lucky to grab a table right away because there ended up being a slight wait a few minutes later.The atmosphere is modern. Lots of hightop tables and a long bar that serves up fun cocktails and beers for days.I had a beer and some chips and salsa. The beer was been in St. Louis (not Budweiser tho), and the chips and salsa were made right in house. So I'm saying everything was super fresh. I didn't try any more food, but the menu looked like they'd have something to satisfy just about anyone who like trendy slightly-fancy Mexican food with prices to match."}, {"review_id": "0AabN1ZL6EEeztZNkidWbA", "user_id": "JC8jXE_sdIdMwP6Z7rIQNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Holy crazy good tacos, Batman! This place is legit. Recommended to us by several friends, our expectations were already set very high when we arrived. Their beer selection is top notch, the service was on point, but most importantly the food was incredible.The tacos we had were wonderfully flavorful. When you read the descriptions on the menu, you can't help but wonder if the flavors will actually blend well together or if it will just become one big mess of flavors which are indistinguishable from another. Let me tell you that within each taco you can taste every flavor that is listed in the ingredients on the menu. It is like a party in your mouth and everyone is invited!!!  Do yourself a favor and get some tacos from here...like...now... stop reading this review and go get the tacos.  You will thank me"}, {"review_id": "oD5fMjPHh8RLsjs2Up2EDA", "user_id": "ohYnCSs6eTl7O6o3UySpgg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/18/2017", "text": "Looking for some Tex Mex in the Delmar Loop.. This is a good spot to drop by. I was getting hungry so a work mate of mine and me decided to stop in and have some Chips and Salsa and I got burrito, and a couple of beers!First off great beer list! Lots of craft and local selections!2nd off why do places charge for chips and salsa.. They were good but 4 bucks is a bit steep even if it did come with 2 salsa selections.  I really only dug one of the 2. But.... The Chips were darn good and hot! 3rd off, I had a veggie burrito, not huge but good. Maybe a bit over priced for what it was but the flavor was there! Perfect blend of veggies, rice, and beans.  Cool layout, great staff, easy to get in and out of! Could be a 5, if they were a bit cheaper or gave you a bit more bang for your buck!

In an effort to not type a review that's too long to keep your attention, I will just say that Mission Taco Joint (in all 4 locations in our area) have the coolest servers, hippest environment, best fresh margaritas, amazing chips, queso to die for and a shrimp taco that turns seafood haters into deep sea fishermen to find more.

Mission TACO knows what they're doing. Food presentation, actual quality, and overall ambiance. A-la-carte menu, but don't be disengaged. Yeah, the chips and salsa aren't free, but get THEM, they made the wait for the real tacos worth it. Ordered several different tacos, cuz that's what ppl do i guess. Mixed reviews, but let me just say this, the BAJA FISH, automatic! I know fish tacos, ordered two of them and, result : body high. The other tacos were OK, with the red-orange taco bi-product spilling out. I could've made something better with hamburger helper. ***Realistically, perfect place for a weekday dinner, but also fills the void for a weekend cruiser. Enjoyed the whole process. If i could take anything home, it would be the wicked taco holders that come with the meal***"}, {"review_id": "FlrpnNQUAXna98f_ncVuXw", "user_id": "wIX2HIfRVsoJ6I3x3yVCjw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "We needed food and everything was closed because it was 10:00 pm.

Great tiki style drinks. Can't go wrong with their awesome chips and salsa.

At the end of the day, you can't go wrong. Three tacos is about right for a meal. Get the guac -- it's awesome.
