We came here as soon as we left the Lihue airport - it's about 10-15 mins away (there was traffic). When you first turn into the pier complex, it really doesn't look like much of anything. But it's actually a pretty neat place with lots of open air seating (shoo, birds!). You order the food at the counter, find a seat, and the buzzer goes off when your order's ready. My friend got the ahi furikake, which is ahi tuna seared with a coating of furikake seasoning (seaweed & sesame seeds), and that was so good with the dipping sauce that it comes with. I had some poke (needs more seasoning) and ono (kinda dry). You can get drinks around the bar, and they even have a nice happy hour!

But truth be told, it's the second best. Second isn't bad, right? This place has been feautured on DDD before and the restaurant is normally pretty packed, but there is a small to go type convenience store attached. That is where you want to go! You can order there and take the food out to the outdoor patio on the water which is beautiful. The convenience store has a poke bar with some of the best and most fresh fish I've ever had. They have mostly fresh rolls, and even sell sides of rice and bottled drinks. I ordered some spicy ahi rolls which was off cuz it was a bit stale.. but the ahi special was freaking amazing. I also got half a pound of spicy ahi which is in a mayonnaise based sauce. I hate mayo, and normally this place is spot on. But this 4th time wasn't as good for some reason, I'm not sure if it's because I tried their competitor fresh catch, last time, and found it to be my favorite poke' place of all. This place is still a great place for a beautiful view with fresh fish and a nice tourist vibe, so you should definitely check it out. I would probably bring my family here if they came, or maybe some friends if it was their first Hawaii experience and they loved fish."}, {"review_id": "nWMU3GmUWCtig-CZ7Y5dFg", "user_id": "8vU81Y40XNCPykYAfaxyjQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/27/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Nico's is obviously great for fish and other seafood, but stay away from the pork chops.

It is the first place they take us to for our annual trek out. It is far enough from Waikiki to keep the tourists away. It is also priced fairly. We have been here many times over the years.The place has tons of seating and we rarely have to wait. We like to sit outside and breathe the fresh ocean breeze.I was here for breakfast this time, so I will review that. I got a simple $5 Breakfast Croissant sandwich, which is ham, egg and cheese. Very good. A 5. Kona Coffee carafe is hidden to the far right by the kitchen. Very good. 5 stars.Rest of our party of 7 got all different items and gave them 5 stars.One negative is we did not order to go, but they brought out everything in styrofoam. Inlaws said all meals are on styrofoam. How much styrofoam packaging in Hawaii winds up in the ocean? Is it burned or left in landfills to degrade for decades? It should be banned. Shame on Nico's. They lose a star for that and get an overall 4."}, {"review_id": "i93RfJrArfPJfTSsE54UQQ", "user_id": "hFdk_ht0lffvLKzKZa5G3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Haven't been here in like forever! Love the new expansion. Last time we've been here...it literally had been a cramped fish counter and just a few outdoor tables. Being that the restaurant is sitting near the edge of the Pier...you're bombarded with the overwhelming smell of ocean and fish...Now, fish market is separate from the main dining area with much more tables & a semi enclosed area, live music, even at lunch hour & A BAR! Not much of the pungent smell of fish...so much more of a pleasant dining experience.Food...still deliciously good! We got an order of the Pier 38 Fish Sandwich (as seen on Triple DDD), Ahi Katsu Salad & an MahiMahi with wasabi salads Salad (one of the salad specials of the day). All of our fish had been moist, flavorful & heavenly delicious!Lunch hour parking can be crazy busy...luckily we had been there right before the madness.

It was his first time here. I wish I could give this place five stars because I usually enjoy the food here. But this time I was disappointed in what my dad had ordered.I ordered a mini loco Moco and that's usually a never fail lunch. The patty is usually really tasty and the egg always perfectly cooked. It's simple and always a winner for me. However, my dad's first experience here, unfortunately, wasn't as great. He decided to order the pork chops. I had never ordered the pork chops here and probably should've looked up any reviews on this entree before ordering. Once we got our food, I noticed my dad struggling to cut his pork chop. At first I thought he was struggling because he has hand tremors, which makes it hard to eat and cut food. When I assisted him, I had the hardest time cutting through both pieces! It honestly felt like never ending sawing through a tire. It kind of bummed me out and really frustrated me. I should've said something to management and got my dad something else but I'm not huge on complaining or causing a big fuss. But after leaving Nico's, I pulled up a bunch of reviews talking about how the pork chop is horrible and really hard to cut through. I know businesses aren't obligated to check all Yelp reviews. But I think it's imperative that businesses leverage this information (especially if there's consistent negative feedback on specific things) to build and improve on their business/product(s). In this case, there were a lot of negative reviews on their pork chop dish and nothing has been done to improve it. I think they should either try and improve their cooking method or take it off the menu.I do really like Nico's and my friends and I always enjoy the food here. But I'm pretty bummed about my dad's pork chop and hope they start to improve things."}, {"review_id": "k4axPmpogARoNT29EHSvCg", "user_id": "5u-uA61XZi9Ptd_PtZcrEw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Good food.

Located literally by all the piers hence the name. It's as fresh as it gets and a great local spot. My bf and I have been here dozens of times. We usually get the same thing-- blackened fresh fish sandwich and the Caesar salad with the pesto chicken!! We have also tried the tomato basil soup as well as the ahi sandwich which are both as equally delicious. We haven't ventured to anything else because are usual is just too good. Always great service, food comes out fast and they also have such an awesome atmosphere with live music sometimes and just the whole open air concept. Never a bad time here!! Free parking as well which is a plus. They also have a small store where you can buy freshly caught poke and other fish selections as well as souvenirs. They also have a full bar and bar seating if you want an ice cold beer with your food. Keep in mind that during peak lunch times it gets really busy and sometimes is hard to find a spot to sit.

The largest table I saw had seats for six. Food 4/5 - If you see a special on the board as if it's still available as the good ones sell out quick. After special was all gone I found myself ordering the first thing I saw the good old loco moco. Taste wise it was about average, nothing special really. But seeing my entire party happy with the choices they made is what keeps this review higher than what it would be. Several got the fish of the day number 2 plate special and said it was absolutely amazing and I would agree with that as well.Service - You order at the counter and they give you a table buzzer, when that goes off you get your stuff. Very little interaction with staff but it works perfectly.Parking - It looked like there were plenty of spaces available, some spaces available literally at the front door or the restaurant for like 10mins only. The rest of the spots are a little walk away from the entrance.If you are nearby or even planning a future vacation make sure the remember this place."}, {"review_id": "_rFjRU4-duLIyUbjQf5j5w", "user_id": "lZVw2SN2SKpghLQCpivGgQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "Valentine's Day showing.

Perhaps my expectations were too high or we didn't order the right things, but I'm sad to report that I was not very impressed.We arrived at around 6:45 and waited about 15 minutes for a table for 5 people. We were seated on the patio, which was very cute with strings of lights, though it was difficult for us to read the menu because it was so dark. The service we received was alright but nothing special, even a bit slowFOOD: We started with the Home Made Smoked Ahi Spread ($9) and the Deep Fried Hamachi Kama ($11), both of which were pretty good and probably the best things we ordered. In terms of mains, we ordered the Catch of the Day Special ($40) which happened to be a whole fried fish with a black bean sauce. I was not a fan of the sauce and it honestly tasted like something I could have cooked myself. I also tried the Grilled Peppercorn Swordfish ($18.50) (ok, but on the dry side) and the Salad Nicoise ($16) (again, ok but not great). Overall, I really wanted to like this place but everything (besides the appetizers) was mediocre at best.
