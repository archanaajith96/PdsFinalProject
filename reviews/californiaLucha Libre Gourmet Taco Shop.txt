I used to love Lucha Libra when I first came a few years ago and was stuck on their Suplex quesadilla but the last time I had it, it wasn't good so I waited a few years to come back and unfortunately my experience today was just as disappointing as my last.I got the Tap me out tacos with the fries which was the best thing we ordered. Had good flavor and I liked that it was vegetarian and loved the Poblano and queso sauce! It was very messy though and wish I could have had it on flour tortillas but that's just my preference. I also ordered the rolled tacos with potato and soyrizo..they looked amazing but were very bland and didn't really have a lot of filling. My girlfriend ordered the veggie taco and was also disappointed by it. For almost $30, it was overpriced for the quality we had in return. I love their salsas & also love the fact that they have a lot of vegetarian options. I maaaybe would come back to give them another chance and try something else..but in a long time lol."}, {"review_id": "tsijqW8WF21s2TTiIDgq8w", "user_id": "raiV05zEdquv6U8eNsz2qQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "This looked like a fun place to grab some Mexican food. There's a small parking lot shared with other businesses, so I imagine it can be tough to find a spot during peak hours. Luckily, we got here before the rush as the line can get long. We ordered the Surf & Turf taco, Undefeated Seafood taco, Ala Tingada California burrito and Champion Fries. None of what we ordered was memorable. The Champion Fries were particularly disappointing since I had a craving for some carne asada fries and these fell short. The fries were soggy and cheap and just not enjoyable. The burritos here are huge and could easily be shared if you don't have a big appetite. The best part of our meal was the complimentary chips and extensive salsa bar. My favorites were the mango salsa and cilantro cream salsa. I don't think this place would be my first pick for Mexican food the next time I'm in San Diego. There are better options out there."}, {"review_id": "R0DPaI-DAk3opQxJog0G8Q", "user_id": "amKuvJtW35lBe0o265H62A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Visit: Wednesday, March 28, 2018I came here for lunch while I was in town on the recommendation of a local friend. Upon walking in, I was slightly disappointed, since the place seemed super-touristy. This entire neighborhood is reliably difficult to park in and crammed full of out-of-towners. We got super lucky: despite coming at 12:30, we managed to beat the rush. We only waited a couple minutes in line, and easily found a table. Once we sat down, the line quickly reached out the door.I had the ala tingada California burrito. Something about the chicken didn't taste right to me. I thought it tasted strongly of white pepper, which doesn't strike me as being a typical Mexican seasoning. The rest of the burrito was on the soggy side. The only good thing was that the burrito was massive and packed full of ingredients. It was certainly filling, even if it wasn't to my taste. Drink selection includes a few beers, as well as fountain drinks. The salsa bar looked appealing, but I noticed several flies buzzing around it, so I skipped the salsa. The staff taking orders were working very slowly and didn't seem to have a good workflow set up. Nor were they particularly warm. Oh well.There is a ton of great Mexican food in San Diego, and I can't imagine wanting to come back here. This spot is unique in its themed decor, and that's about the only reason I'm glad I came. I'm also pleased they don't charge an exorbitant amount despite catering largely to visitors."}, {"review_id": "uuNwY2-9fsLH4VwpdPSmxQ", "user_id": "fRJpK_b0rrjpBgRZjvfvgA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Solid 5 StarsLucha Libre Gourmet Taco Shop is a hidden gem. It was my first time visiting Lucha Libre Gourmet Taco Shop in Mission Hills. I decided to try several different food. The prices are excellent for the amount of food you get.For starters I had the fish tostada. Also a chips and salsa. For the main dish I had the surf and turf burrito. The fish tostada was excellent that comes with shrimp and avocado. My favorite item was the surf and turf burrito. The burrito comes with beef and shrimp.If you never experienced Lucha Libre Gourmet Taco Shop I highly recommend it. The customer service was excellent. From the minute you order your food to the minute you leave. I look forward to coming back again. Lucha Libre Gourmet Taco Shop has three locations in town. One in Carlsbad, Mission Hills and North Park. If you are looking for a place that is open late on the weekends. Lucha Libre Gourmet Taco Shop is the late spot to be."}, {"review_id": "q86KuYkN23CcNYeUD5FPPA", "user_id": "_Ogt5-xmrwgM-sA_Hmgpcw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Phenomenal burritos.  Absolutely massive, fresh, delicious, filling, you name it.  Side of chips for free with some of the best housemade salsas ever.  Tried the Surfin' California burrito (from Man vs. Food) and the steak and vegetable one that has one them an award.  Both were delicious but probably liked the award winner better, however I did enjoy the shrimp in the Surfin' burrito.  Both were filled with well-seasoned and cooked steak, plenty of fresh avocado, french fries and pico.  The addition of the grilled mushrooms and onions in the other burrito was a great combo with the steak.Beers on tap and plenty of unique sodas.  Friendly staff and cool and funky decor.  Little patio where we sat outside but the restaurant itself was open air.  Good prices for the portion you get.  Will definitely be back on my next trip to San Diego."}, {"review_id": "VdxRdkAEqEgcN_xRxfHDIA", "user_id": "Oa84FFGBw1axX8O6uDkmqg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I have come here twice, and I was SO excited.  I have heard nothing but amazing things.  Both times I have come here there were lines out the door.  It had everything, great reviews, personal referrals....The good: Both times I came here I ordered the California Burrito with pork.

I came here with my sister on a whim, but I am so glad we chose to stop by. The ambiance is very unique since there is luchador inspired decor. Food tried:1. Surf and Turf Taco: 5/5 - This was so delicious. The best surf and turf taco I've ever had. The beef and shrimp were nice and tender chunks, which was beautifully paired with the savory yet sweet sauce. I fully recommend trying the surf and turf!2. Blackened Mahi Mahi Undefeated Seafood Taco: 4/5 - You can also choose shrimp instead of mahi mahi, but having shrimp in the surf and turf, I decided to try something different. The seafood taco is prettier and tastes good, but I would prefer the surf and turf if you want more flavor. But, if you prefer something lighter, this seafood taco is perfect for you!Tip: Order the chips with your order! And you can try out their variety of salsas at the counter next to the soda machine!"}, {"review_id": "AL7ycsolHVy-tKh20iwcMA", "user_id": "eYg71ima9LQxZDrfMfB0Kw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "I made sure to stop here during my visit to San Diego after seeing the raving Yelp reviews!

It's simply the best! Sure the line is long and the wait time is ridiculous, but I wouldn't expect anything less from this place.I went at night, so at first glance it was a little sketchy due to the parking situation. I'm not sure if it's since been fixed, but whether it has or not I'll still be a loyal customer.The line was out the door, and I was hangry, but I was fine with it because of all the hype I've heard regarding the restaurant. It took about 10 minutes before I could get to the front to order. The menu isn't huge, but the options I did have all looked delicious. I ended up getting a Surfin' California burrito in a bowl with the tortilla on the side. They had no problem doing that for me which was awesome. I paid for it which ended up being a little more than $10 including a drink.I found a seat and had chips and salsa while I waited for my food. The place is decorated from top to bottom in tons of pictures, masks, interesting artwork and bright colors. Was totally in love with it all. Took about 10 minutes for my food to come out and once it was I was simply in heaven. The \"deconstructed burrito\" had steak, shrimp, fries, pico de gallo, shredded jack cheese, avocado slices and a chipotle sauce. It was fantastic.I can't wait to introduce my fiance to this place.

Having lived here for more than a year now.. I can still say it rivals in the top 2. This location in particular- the original. I love the surfin California, more or less for their secret sauce. That's what sets it apart from competitors. The burritos are manageable in size and you can definitely finish it in one sitting. The ingredients are fresh and plentiful. The salsa bar offers numerous salsas --from mild to spicy and green sauces to traditional red. Complimentary chips are included. The scenery is obviously Lucha Libre wrestling themed-- it's colorful and you'll definitely have stuff to look at.

This is not the best Mexican food I have ever had but it was flavorful and enjoyable. Hard to mess up a Quesadilla.Parking is not readily available if there is a crowd, but was able to park down the street and walk a few hundred feet. There is a traffic light and sidewalk so it is safe.The line was not too bad, just out the door to the side walk and took 25-30 minutes. It gives you a chance to talk to you friends, or take some pictures.Once I ordered, I got the food in 5-10 minutes. The employees were very nice and seem to work together as a cohesive team. They offer you free chips too.The bathroom has a cool look to it, with a giant luchador mask made out of little pictures.The decors is quirky and fun, with lots of luchador items.It has been on tv and featured in many things so there is a lot of hype and long lines, but it is worth trying out."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/lucha-libre-gourmet-taco-shop-san-diego?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
