My salad dressing was made a week ago so it's not even fresh as it's dated 3/13. This was my second chance i promised the owner after the last time they messed my order up and didn't get it right and when I called to complain and slammed the phone in my ear. So much for a 2nd chance.

My experience was wonderful. We chose Salvatore's for its great food but mainly for the family feel. We had our son's birthday dinner there. He wanted pizza and we did not want to chose just any pizzeria. After careful review, this pizzeria had the best reviews, due to the family atmosphere and great food.The outside is misleading, as it appears small, but once inside there is a bar and several large booths to seat several large families. The feel is very Italian with music, art work and over all design.We ordered the largest pizza for our party.....which to this day is the best pizza I've had. The spaghetti and large meat balls in marinara sauce was great. We ordered a few other items as well.The biggest thing was at the end the cook came out to see how we were and to see if the food was met to our standards.  This meant a lot to me, meaning as any cook should, that he and his people put love and heart into the meal. I was very happy and satisfied with the end results. Our waitress was very nice and did a good job taking care of us. I highly recommend this pizzeria, and will return with my family again."}, {"review_id": "Utgfe8MIUkazitoRi4h0OQ", "user_id": "M1Dwa2sg0LCkddUdEwTIcg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "The place is huge, and hidden in the Kempsville plaza.

Drink cake fast along with the appetizer we order.The food was great, the appetizer was a little soggy for calamari but still tasted good. I order the chicken Marsala which was on point and filled with flavor. My wife got the tour, which was lasagna, manicotti, and baked ziti I had some and the sauce was excellent. The zeppeles were outstanding, and a great way to finish a good meal. I could probably go there and eat several orders of these and nothing else.

I would say it would be like eating at Salvatore's Virginia Beach Va.Yes, I said Heaven! If God is love, you can definitely taste Him in every bite at Salvatore's, and you can feel Him in the wait staff like Kathryn!Our entire dining experience was heavenly, starting with the warm garlic knots, topped with butter and cheese...can you hear them?Then we had \"side salad\" to go with our meals. Now I don't normally brag about a salad, it's just a salad right? NO! This salad was made with JOY, LOVE, PEACE, LONG SUFFERING, GENTLENESS and SELF CONTROL! Really guys, this salad was so simple, yet AWESOME, it's hard to believe it was a \"side salad\"! Then there was Kathryn our server, she had a GREAT PERSONALITY, she knew the menu, she offered perfect choices, very engaging, helpful, attentive. We were never left wondering what's next! High Five Kathryn!! Oh and Happy Early Birthday! She's a restaurant KEEPER, just to be 18. WOW! Can you hear them yet?Then there was dinner, the Mrs had two slices and she raved about their pizza. That's saying a lot from a person who travels to NewYork frequently and pizza just happens to be her favorite meal. Great Job to the Pizza maker! I had the special...stuffed lobster ravioli with shrimp and scallops on top and a balsamic drizzle, yep you know it...PARTY IN MY MOUTH! OMG it was SUPREME! Can you hear them yet!?!?!?We finished with cannoli and true to form Salvatore's completed our dining experience on the Good Foot! I can't believe you can't hear them yet. Hear who, you say?The Entire Heavenly Host singing about this Heavenly restaurant! It truly was a divine experience! Until next time this has been another 5 Star Heavenly adventure..."}, {"review_id": "3WiJ0Xh5tDwDFGkM4sYlVQ", "user_id": "tod-4yaeWptrg-t2tk8niA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "Repeat after me: Pizza is life. Hubby and I are perpetually in search of the perfect pizza. Salvatore's definitely tops the list. They were all out of their small bites, which was a bummer. I really wanted to try their arancini rice balls. Our waitress suggested the bruschetta instead and it was a solid choice. The mozzarella and balsamic reduction was everything. The bread was toasted juuuust right. They brought us two complimentary garlic knots. I love my regular pizzeria but they routinely burn my garlic knots. It was nice to eat some that weren't overdone. The star of the show, a meatlover's pie was perfect. The crust was crispy and chewy and the sauce had lots of flavor. Salvatore's is a bit of drive for us so I'm not sure how often we'll be back in. It's definitely one of the better pizzerias in Virginia Beach."}, {"review_id": "CIeRJHomJjgF9-zKEIAmug", "user_id": "qTOPqeg6jkBHqpcLG3JpSw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/18/2017", "text": "Visited Salvatore's Pizzeria over the weekend and brought a large group with me. We live near this restaurant and have driven past it a number of times. We've never gone or ordered from this restaurant so I was already feeling a way about taking a group of people somewhere I'd never been. I take pride in my restaurant recommendations so I made sure to let everyone know it was my husbands idea to go here (just in case it was subpar lol). To his enjoyment, everyone really enjoyed the environment, food, and service so he welcomed the credit for the restaurant pick. We had a group of about 8 or 9 and I wanted to keep the cost down. We ended up getting two 22\" pizzas and had one with a cheese side and one with a pepperoni, the other with one side bacon and the other Hawaiian. Everyone either got water or beer so the cost ended up coming out to less than $10 per person! If you've been present at a pizza party this will usually get you a couple slices. Well the pizza is HUGE. I read 22\" but couldn't quite visualize it until it was at the table. Each pie had 16 pieces. We each ate as much as we wanted and had left overs. The slices themselves were quite long so 3 of them were pretty filling. The atmosphere was great and they had a lot of group seating options. I believe there are three large rooms with one of the rooms having the ability to be rented out for a large party. Minus the noise from the party, we had no problem hearing each other. Service was decent and our waitress was very attentive. I was very impressed and would definitely recommend this restaurant for group dining!"}, {"review_id": "D3-3CtHXHA1DqLbSEK6f4w", "user_id": "bRzZaAsJbWLOGHETVOgfaw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Bad service and worse food.  Every meal was bad .  Shrimp scampi tasted like lemon juice over pasta, antipasto old meat and low quality ingredients.  Server left all of our dirty plates on the table for over and hour.  Garlic nots were stale.  Won't be back."}, {"review_id": "LdfslpWurqb-U_UgDPmz4Q", "user_id": "9lmClvXsfdwhZxw8JYUN-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/16/2017", "text": "I typically coordinate all the birthday lunches at work where we try a new restaurant each round. This month Salvatore's was selected.  I had never been here before and I was not disappointed.  I called the day before to make a reservation for 12 at 12.  Soon as we arrived we were seated immediately at our table.  As we sat waiting for the rest of our party we were promptly given our beverages and garlic knots.  Man oh man were those good.  I only ate one trying to save room for lunch but I could have had at least another. Lunch specials are pretty good but after looking over the other yelp photos I wanted to be greedy and try the Margherita Pizza and the Wings with Sal's Special Sauce.   Both did not disappoint.  I ordered a personal pizza (which isn't on the menu but you can ask) which I would say is about 10-12\" vs the small of 14\". Pizza was delicious I ate about 3 slices of my pie and half my wings.  When it comes to wings I love them saucy and they did not skimp at all. I was absolutely stuffed and extremely satisfied I needed a nap after all that food.   My personal sized pizza could easily be shared among two people if you add in an appetizer (or wings).The place itself is nicely decorated and was told by coworkers they had expanded as the restaurant was quite large. We were seated in the bar area which even had an all white leather couch.  Staff was extremely friendly and attentive. I would definitely return to this establishment."}, {"review_id": "KJ4GpuM5Nu-QZb9rpJ9haA", "user_id": "MFAxt6wY2m6K5c00Zyrg_w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/19/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Dined inn.

The decor inside is warm, but dark. One of the perks of coming here is you will get some sort of free small plate/ appetizer and a small dessert every time. On this particular visit, my boyfriend and I got garlic knots that were to die for. After those we were given normal bread that tasted fresh and homemade with butter. My boyfriend order a Philly style sub and I had mussels marinara with linguine. My boyfriend enjoyed his sub a lot and said it was tasty and filling. My pasta had a good amount of mussels, and a large amount of tomato. The menu states it would be in marinara sauce, but it seemed to just be cut tomatoes. After our meal we enjoyed our free small dessert, zeppole (think Italian style donut holes) covered in powdered sugar, chocolate sauce and caramel.

Easy ordering online (Yelp even gave a discount code). Ordered my standard thin crust hamburger mushroom pizza. Pizza arrived timely and hot. When I opened the box, I was a little disappointed at first glance - didn't seem to be many toppings and a lot of crust. The flavor made up for it, though.  Very tasty sauce and the toppings were fresh! This would be one I would definitely order from again. I thought the prices were a bit high. $14.99 for a base 14\" cheese pizza and then $2.50 per topping. Came out at $19.99 for a 14\" pizza, not counting tax, delivery. Delivery charge is $2.00 so that is reasonable not to have to get out on a work day. Overall, very good experience!

We were greeted and seated promptly (it was still early...more of a late lunch/early dinner for us). Our server was Liz and she was very attentive. The complimentary garlic knots with marinara were very good. We ordered the Lobster Raviolo (a longtime favorite dish of mine) and the Eggplant Rollatini. Both dishes were scrumptious! And not a bite was left on our plates! At the end, Liz presented us with Zeppoles, for dessert, which were quite good.We will definitely be back! 2nd visit was today for a takeout pizza (eggplant and onion!)...my sister and I just moved here this weekend. It's been stressful and emotional, so when I dropped the pizza right outside the door, it added to the stress. The owner made me a new pie  and the staff were all so sweet! I just sat there crying.

My family and I have been coming here since the opening and we ALWAYS had a great experience. We came in about a month ago and there were 9 of us. I noticed that there was a different type of atmosphere and I didn't know why. My wife had brought that to my attention as well. So we ordered the specials and just moved on. My entree was a chicken pasta special which my mother had ordered. My entree came out at least 10 minutes later than the rest of the table. I cut into my chicken and it was raw. Completely rushed dish and I was extremely disappointed. They of course took off the dish and discounted my wife's but I lost my appetite at that point. I figured I'd be forgiving and give them another try. 4 weeks went by sure I'll go. I got the same sense when we went back. The service was slow and the food was bland. It was not the same Salvatore's we were used to. The free appetizer they used to greet you with and the warm fresh doughnuts at the end was no more. The AWESOME owner that was around I hadn't seen- it was really strange to go in and not see him and for it to happen twice something must of happened. I probably won't be returning."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/salvatores-pizzeria-virginia-beach?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
