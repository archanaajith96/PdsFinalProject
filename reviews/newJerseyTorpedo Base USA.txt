I got the #26 which was pastrami and beef with cheese. It looked like half a sub. I should have ordered 2 bc it was very tasty. The meat was very moist and tender. Go when the sun is out. Unless you have protection. Not sure if cc accepted. Paterson is a CREAM city.

Also, if it matters to anyone, apparently Fetty Wap, another Paterson native, comes here occasionally, and they have a picture hanging up of him waiting in line.  I'll post the picture of Fetty if I still have it on my computer.  Just seemed like a funny side-note."}, {"review_id": "HX3plev1YOkLH9-JI2O3uQ", "user_id": "9ISt0MzrLc39Gzr9Lzrqbw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/8/2017", "text": "Every time I'm in Paterson I stop by to grab a pastrami all the way with no onions to go.

As we pulled up to the place, the outside still looks the same. The signs are still in red, white and blue. When we got out of the car, people were standing around outside waiting to pay for their orders because the inside of the place has been reduced. If my memory servers me correctly, the inside of the place was already small from the beginning. The reduction in size has to do with them not only selling sandwiches any more. They also serve hot food and other things. We ordered our sandwiches which were 2 torpedo best and 1 pastrami 6\" hero/sub that cost about $5.65 and their larger hero/sub sandwiches are around $12 or $13. The sandwiches weren't the old time ones that I remembered but they were still good as well as their prices. Torpedo Base, I would like to thank you for remaining a staple to the Paterson community and bringing back old memories.
