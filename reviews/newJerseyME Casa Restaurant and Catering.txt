Very flavorful. Unfortunately they ran out of maduros, which is what I was looking forward to most. Really friendly atmosphere, people came out of the kitchen to check on us and how we were doing! We came in around 8pm on a Friday evening and it was quiet with only a few tables.

The food is delicious, the service is okay, and the atmosphere could use some work.I've eaten here twice. First I had the Castroless Sandwich I believe it's called. Which is pernil, with an amazing slaw and tostones as \"bread\". Phenomenal! The second time I had pernil and rice, with a side of maduros. As I said food wise you can't go wrong. The downside is that it's a small place often feeling too small. But staff is friendly and everyone inside seems to always be in a good mood. I believe they've downsized some and now have a food truck during the week."}, {"review_id": "PSSMv9o_hbqlL8WTtPn22A", "user_id": "-A6ENKeDFHJfo9JEXRTh6w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "Had higher hopes for me Casa and winded up being pretty average. Best part was that it's BYOB. Came in around 8pm on a Saturday night on a date and it was fairly empty. 2-3 other parties but quiet. The dining area is small and you can see into the kitchen from any table. Feels like it was a home at one point reconstructed into a restaurant that hadn't been updated for 30-40 Years.Started with the appetizer sampler that came with chicken and beef empanadas, potato croquette of sorts, and something else I can't seem to remember. Served with 3 different dipping sauces. Decent but not very flavorful and the empanadas didn't have enough of a crispy texture.Next we split the shrimp stew and the beef mofongo. Yelpers raves about the mofongo and I just couldn't get behind it. It took ~15 min to get someone's attention to get a spoon for the stew so by the time we tried eating the mofongo it was tepid. Nothing awful about either dish but just lacking flavor and profile. The shrimp stew was also salty. Rice and beans as well as yuca were side dishes along with the entrees. The yuca either came out of a can or it was boiled with no spices. Extremely disappointing. Can't really mess up rice and beans.Another downside to the night was that it was cash only (sign was on the door but we missed it). No one told us as we sat down, which I understand we should have seen on the door but it was unfortunate we needed to walk to an ATM. All in all, it's nice to have a BYOB in the area but nothing special about the Puerto Rican cuisine."}, {"review_id": "xbcvUIs5YgoZkQTddE0sTw", "user_id": "iqrbBs_KWo817fpOUVOmHA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/15/2017", "text": "I absolutely love the food and the service was good! I came here for a Yelp event: International Meals of Mystery. I have always seen the Groupon for this place but for some reason, never decided to purchase it. Now, totally different story! The owner is super nice and super proud of both his establishment and accomplishment, and he has all the right to be!Let me start by saying I don't normally care for pork, but I got the Chuleta Frita (Fried Pork Chop) with a side of Arroz con Gandules (Yellow rice with beans) with the intention of sharing it with my boyfriend. BEST/WORST decision ever!BEST DECISION: It tasted AMAZING and it was filled with SOOOOOO much flavor.WORST DECISION: I had to share!! :( HA!The shrimp empanada app, while a little on the small side - portion wise, still tasted GREAT! If you look at my profile, you'll know I HATE cilantro, but at this place I didn't mind it too much. The also gave us tostones, again, even with the cilantro and pico (don't like pico either), it was still GOOD! They also had a house vodka that was AMAZING when mixed with Arnold Palmer (half iced tea/half lemonade). A couple of those and you'll definitely be feeling nice! The sangria was really good too - just don't expect it to be homemade with fruit in it.I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 because the event was supposed to $25 per person, but we ended up having to pay $30. Initially, the dessert (Flan) wasn't included. They served it to us and then when we got the bill, they told us it was $30 because of the dessert. I wish they had mentioned that before hand because I barely had enough cash for the tip (I'm more of a card person, but cash was recommended). On top of that, I say the service was good because I'm sure it could be excellent, but for the event it was just good. The servers seemed a little all over the place. The forgot my refill and it took a WHILE for me to receive my check and I was really in a rush to leave (the even was supposed to be over at 8 but ran over 9 p.m.).Although I'm pick with my garnishes, I try not to let that stop me from experiencing the taste and flavor of foods. So glad I didn't hold back because this place is a real gem! I will happily be returning and bringing friends.Until then next time,~*~*~Comiendo Feliz*~*~"}, {"review_id": "TJmAit41_5rQWE3MwRXQKg", "user_id": "CHrgMme-s69EQHcc5fi5Ng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/26/2018", "text": "ME Casa is my home away from home whenever I want some authentic Spanish food!The restaurant is quaint and has a family feel that makes the name a true statement.

I was shocked by how flavorful the veggie mofongo was.For dinner, we eat ordered the tilapia - it comes two different ways so we got one of each. Both were very different from one another and both were amazing and so good. We couldn't choose which one we liked more but I think I liked the mango salsa tilapia a tad bit better.

Didn't realize it was a hole in the wall joint and drove past it a few times. Parking was a little challenging out front but I managed to find a spot around the corner a block away. As soon as you walk in, it literally feels like you're in someone home. It's casual, friendly, and very tight with seating....intimate seating. We ordered the sampler of apps and enjoyed the selection of calamari, papa rellena, and empanadas. I ordered the pork chop and miduros (bananas). The miduros were cooked perfectly and a great side to the chops. The chops tasted great BUT mine were definitely over cooked. The ends were charred and parts of the solid pieces of meat were dried out. Maybe it was sitting under the heat lamp too long? Lol. Desserts looked yummy but I didn't taste it so I can't speak to them. Maybe I'll give them another chance in a smaller party to see how they do. For now I'll give 3 stars for food but a total of 4 for the service, apps and desserts."}, {"review_id": "f-syuRB720LdYCnrrE0LOg", "user_id": "MV8EsAPmzL6KGQDnXqpFWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/12/2017", "text": "Keeping in mind that this is a small, casual restaurant...I give it a 5-star.

These are the best alcapurrias not only in town but in the entire area including Manhattan. I liked it so much that I placed an order for uncooked frozen ones so I could fried it at home for when friends visit. This restaurant also do catering and is pretty good.

When we asked to get some light (the other side of the restaurant had lights on), we were told its not possible.

We had a Groupon deal, which included an appetizer, two entrees, and two soft drinks.To start, we ordered the Papas Rellena (fried mashed potato balls filled with beef picadillo). I loved these! They tasted like rice balls, but with potatoes, and were fried perfectly. Plus, the green sauce they served it with was like crack (I remember really liking this sauce last time too).For my entree, I went with the Asopao de Camarones (shrimp gumbo). The flavor was pretty good but it was more like a soup than a gumbo, consistency-wise. I liked that they gave a good amount of shrimp.For my boyfriend's entree, he had the mofongo with beef stew. I can't speak too much on this one since I'm not a huge fan of plantains, but he really enjoyed the dish.Tip - BYOB!"}, {"review_id": "XB1gmh_zq5ojVb6uH6L0_Q", "user_id": "f9j69Xzvz44_UI4giLr6QA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "I can't believe this is first time I'm reviewing Me Casa.

We've travelled from  Brooklyn several times just to eat awesome Puerto Rican food. Not sure what's happened. The family vibe is gone. The last time I was hear the owner was a visible presence and his children were the best servers. Service today was terrible. The waitress brought out our entrees one at a time with significant time gaps in between each plate. The food was subpar. The ceviche was old and the chicharron de pollo was all bone, with a few pieces of tough meat. I'm not sure if they are under new management, something is not right here, but if not then I hope the owners read this and get on top of these issues before they lose their clientele.
