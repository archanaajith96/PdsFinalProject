Had lunch today with a friend. Service was fast, friendly, and consistent. I had the General Tso's and my friend had the Mongolian beef. Both were delicious and were delivered to our table quickly. The soup was flavorful and piping hot. No joke, it was almost boiling when delivered to the table, so be sure to blow on it before putting it into your mouth.The neighborhood is a bit sketchy; but, the place has a good security system and you should be fine! We enjoyed it enough that we may be \"Lucky\" enough to make this our weekly haunt."}, {"review_id": "X8XpgSyHBSiqyoPMaZVfMA", "user_id": "SfynTfyk4W3vpjJkBnWEEw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "This is my new go-to place for Chinese food around here. Which I haven't had in a while, because quite frankly, most of the stuff I've had around here is terrible. Mushy, overcooked, flavorless. With beef dishes, it seems like more often than not,  the beef is somehow....battered? Maybe not battered, but pounded into an odd texture? It's weird, and I hate it.But, not here! My friend and I had the lunch special, me with the beef and vegetables, her with the....I forget what, but it looked good. My dish was EXCELLENT. As were the accompaniments, ie rice, soup, crab puffs or what I know as crab rangoon. Super fast and friendly service. And I think the total was something ridiculous like $13.50. I left a $20 and called it a day, because it was THAT GOOD."}, {"review_id": "0bM19wPNeHn63nLVXSX_cQ", "user_id": "-DxPJpyGtexf6lTFv_aZRQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Went on a Saturday evening with my wife.

I love the sesame tofu and crab puffs but they have so many things I haven't tried yet- it's hard to decide whether to get my fave again or try something new.

They're always checking up on you, and extremely friendly. The menu is fairly easy to navigate, not so much if you're used to seeing them in chinese. The menu is only in english and the utensils given were forks, so it felt slightly americanized. The food was a bit on the salty side, which was a comment on my dad's end. That was surprising to me since he loves salt, but it was a tad over powering. The milk tea was also very sweet, but it seemed to be made of powder. I got the salt and pepper shrimp that wasn't kind of reminded me of calamari, it was nice and crispy, and didn't have as much salt since it wasn't covered in sauces, but plenty of onions and peppers which I liked! Over all, it was all to be expected and not to shabby!"}, {"review_id": "4XKj6TFuvXHibsrpBSV1qg", "user_id": "IF2DQr6NgS1UlI5mYcA16g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Went for the first time and got takeout.
