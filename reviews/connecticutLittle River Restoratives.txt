Love the dim lighting and exposed brick interior. Good amount of space inside with bar seating and table seating as well. Cocktail list is impressive though most drinks are bourbon or gin based. There are some tequila based drinks but almost none with vodka. That being said they do have a full bar and can make you anything and also their menu changes quite a bit. Drinks were pretty good I must say. They have also small plates for food if interested. Overall def worth a visit if in the area and in the mood for a cocktail. Street parking is available."}, {"review_id": "SsFZhVC7iWeBA_vcY2xcXA", "user_id": "DuNi6Rgk8eZjFahCyFxp6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Stopped in for happy hour with friends!

Little River Restoratives has been on our list for quite some time now. We parked up the street a bit in the state lot which after 6 I believe is free. Was a bit of a snowy walk after the storm and Hartford snow plowing budget is not that great I guess. But once inside it's a small cozy space. Bricked lined old school feel. Little River main emphasis is totally in the hand crafted cocktails. Lots of love and effort into each one. These are the types you would not generally have all the ingredients at home to make. There is a small food pairing menu, that works well with these drinks. We choose a cheese board . It had 3 types of cheese , crackers a jam and some of their home made pickles , which were delicious. I ordered 3 different of their delicious cocktails during our visit. The first was called Trefoil Highball which had gin , raspberry, lemon , soda and egg white. It's was very good and light tasting. The second one I tried was the Stone Fence. It had rum, ginger , hard cider and nutmeg. Also well done , a little stronger tasting. I forgot what my 3 drink was , but from what I remember also good. Definitely will return to this cool little spot in Hartford and probably try their ramen spot next door also."}, {"review_id": "fPyzzQQs-0rJmot0VYdxNw", "user_id": "XCC0S5PZ2cWEj_jYl9TNxQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2017", "text": "An Initiate, loud, darkly lit bar with lite food and well crafted cocktails.

They teamed up with an excellent \"Spanish-ish\" food truck called \"Mercado.\" I had (or tasted) their crispy Brussel sprouts, pork empanada, queso frito and duck-fat fries. All decadently good with things like truffle oil and fennel pollen as ingreidients.My favorite thing was the owner was waiting on us. He told us about the pickle-back shot.

If you are a fan of some good cocktails, you will love this place. Sazerac is my favorite here and definitely the Manhattans too. They don't have a large food menu; just a few appetizers to choose from. Not a big deal for a place where drinks are the focus.

I went a few weeks ago and the experience was less than enjoyable. My two friends and I came in and sat at the bar. We were hungry and excited to try the craft cocktails. We received a friendly enough greeting from one of the bartenders and she handed us drink menus. We decided on drinks and ordered. Another bartender who I didn't even realize worked there, took a break from looking at her cell phone off to the side of the bar and began making our drinks. I realized we didn't get any food menus so I asked her if they had food and she gave me a quick \"no\" without even looking up or any explanation. Which was unfortunate because I love their food and was excited to eat there... but totally understandable if the chef wasn't in that day, things happen. She continued making the drinks which she was angrily slamming the cocktail shakers together and made them as quick as possible, all while wearing a winter jacket and looked like she really didn't want to be there. As soon as she was done it was back to checking her phone. The other bartender that greeted us was nice but also on her phone and awkwardly stared \"through\" me at one point for a good minute looking puzzled at the table behind me. I thought she was looking at me so I asked for waters to which I got an \"oh sure\" but never came. One other bartender came in eventually and he was super friendly and engaging so that made us feel a little more welcome. The drinks were tasty but the service was so awkward my friends and I decided to leave as soon as possible because it was  awkward. I don't enjoy being made to feel like I'm bothering someone when I'm paying $16 per cocktail."}, {"review_id": "2JA-k7ilM7P-HSJFFV8CZg", "user_id": "coFurNSL1nOmWeA90yjS5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/17/2017", "text": "Last night was the first time I've ever been to an establishment of this sort.

They had some of the best cocktails I've had in a long time, and the environment was unique and fun without being pretentious. The menu is robust and organized by types of cocktails, including a generic \"cocktail\" list (though not generic in concoctions, merely called \"cocktails\"), possets (creamy!), punches, grogs... I opted for the milky ones, and I could not have been happier. I recommend the Baltimore Egg Nog, \"Pina Colada,\" and Bourbon Posset. I could easily drink any of these again. Unfortunately, I found the beer menu a bit uninspiring, but clearly there's no need to explore the beer selection. There's a small bites part of the menu, though no one seemed to be eating during our visit.The one suggestion I would make is to dim the lights a bit and maybe close the curtains. That would give the bar a bit more of a speakeasy vibe.This spot is definitely popular. By the time we left on a Saturday around 10:30p, there were not tables left in the house.I look forward to coming back!"}, {"review_id": "W71A0CKt4RY0IJn4jwQgBg", "user_id": "KlCBP0Wo-z2zjCoWc36lQg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/22/2016", "text": "This is a great small quaint little bar in Hartford that I sadly never even know existed. It's definitely a smaller venue, initially upon walking in the bar is to the right and there are random tables and chairs that wrap all along the wall. The drinks here are really fantastic, I went through 4 yesterday as they were having a pop-up event with Yardbirdandco. Sadly, my waitress messed up and I never actually got to try the chicken sandwich and panna cotta that I ordered. Hopefully it was dropped off to someone else and they enjoyed it! Kristen is a great bartender and has mastered the craft of mixology. I will definitely be coming back here in the future. All of the staff was very polite and attentive (despite the hiccups they had being so busy with this pop-up event yesterday) I'll still give them the benefit of the doubt and keep it positive.

I like that the max occupancy is roughly 40-50 people. I like that there isn't a large food menu and just a handful of small plates. What I adore most though is the attention to detail when it comes to drink-making. Whether it be making classic renditions like the Manhattan or the Sazerac or creating new twists on vintage drinks -- I dig it. Food is limited, think more along the line of snacks. Plates like spiced nuts, house pickles, deviled eggs, cheese/charcuterie plates, or the grilled cheese and tomato soup are some optionsStreet parking only, opt for spots on Putnam or Babcock Street. Mondays at 8pm is also vinyl night.

I was with a group of my younger friends from an adult kickball league and they were having a good ole' time. I however was bored stiff and dumbfounded as to why they were so thrilled with the bar/ club we were at??? It was overcrowded, the drinks were \"meh\", and the music was too loud to have a conversation. Around 11:15 I left. I wasn't done for the night. In just 45 minutes, I'd be turning the big Three-Oh! I headed to Little River Restoratives as I heard it was a interesting place from a few different people.  I got there around 11:30 and while busy, it was sane and swanky. I sat down in the front corner of the bar. It had a chill atmosphere and was a true cocktail bar. My best description is- Ever been to the cool speakeasy-style cocktail bars in NYC? Their drinks are expertly crafted and ultra delicious. Their bartenders really know their stuff and deliver a unique drinking experience. They offer quality over quantity.  And, the speakeasy theme is a nice touch, that harkens back to the prohibition era. \" LRR is similar, but minus the Speakeasy novelty. (Hey, at least the bar is easy to find and has an actual front door, lol). I ordered a gin drink the way I drink gin.   My drink wasn't even on the menu. Its light  and refreshing, tropical but not with citrus undertones and uber-dry. I liked it so much I ordered a second one. I guess the bar's owner heard it was my b-day and offered me a 30th bday shot (Thanks Chris). When the clock struck 12, I turned 30, had a nice bday \"present\" and headed home. Since then, I've been back twice. The second time I played \"stump the bartender\" and was impressed with my drink- a PB&J creation of cognac, frangelico, grape (something), and egg whites. I was back a third time and started trying drinks that were actually on the menu and was very impressed, as was my friend.  Their prices also average $10-$12  a drink, which is more than reasonable, especially for this style of bar. Each time I've been by, I've been treated very well and my booze has been stellar. Extra points for good, friendly service and relaxed vibe inside the bar :). I'm extremely confident in saying that LRR is the best cocktail bar in the Greater Hartford area. It's not quite as good as some of the top NYC cocktail bars/ speakeasies, but for Hartford,  (Pardon this old, grade-school expression), \"This place is the bomb, yo\"! I'm impressed. Thanks for making my 30th birthday special and for giving me a reason to come to Hartford =)  4.5 stars."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-river-restoratives-hartford-4?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
