About a 7-8 min walk from my hotel I came in for coffee. Saw them cutting bread. Could not pass up on the almond butter and strawberry toast. Taste was awesome. Bread is baked in house like literally right in front of you. Slices are thick. Coffee--vanilla latte. Perfect. On point.

The vibe was clean and inviting, a unique little place to work for a bit or meet with a friend. You could tell someone was intentional to create a beautiful & minimal space. I had the cold brew and it was delicious, staff was friendly and the location super convenient.

A coffee house that cares about customer service, while making sure that each beverage they put out tastes exactly as expected while maintaining the highest quality of flavor.

Just fantastic coffee, espresso and tea beverages at their best."}, {"review_id": "UihYR_TQNLh0supLxlZfVQ", "user_id": "le_A1AmI2sN6pPx5tQmAiQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "My brother lives in the area and is always saying how amazing this place is. So when I went to visit him this was a priority stop! And I was not disappointed. The perfection that goes into every drop of coffee and every bit of toast is astounding. There is simply nothing bad here. Not one thing. And - here's the kicker - I used to live in Seattle, and the minute I took a sip of my brown sugar latte from Young Blood I knew that it was the best coffee I've ever had. Ever. Better than any top shop in Seattle. There are hardly words to describe it. I'm going to dream about that latte until my next visit to the area! And the toast? I got cinnamon sugar at my brother's suggestion but I also saw other patrons eating other kinds and every single piece looked incredible. The cinnamon sugar toast had the texture of good french toast - crispy crust and cloud-like, fluffy inside. Just. Amazing. Young Blood, keep doing what you're doing! You have a lot of happy customers!"}, {"review_id": "rcY3ungbL0f8itwtbcY-YA", "user_id": "8SqnqEebQE8-yyNP8EIHIA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "Okay.

That being said, I am excited to revisit and try other items! First of all, they've got a ginger cider to die for. I am sure this cider could instantly cure a common cold. I've tried a few lattes too, both hot and iced. It's a clean, modern place to enjoy an Instagram-worthy cup of coffee!

I got an espresso shot (with a sparkling water on the side) and a cranberry orange scone from a new local bakery that Young Blood is exclusively carrying. Both items were delicious and well made. The shop is well designed and has a great social atmosphere. Though there isn't wifi available, you're still welcome to use your laptop, also making it a great place to meet with friends or co workers face to face. I would recommend checking out the shop whether you're just passing through town or a local looking for your new neighborhood gem."}, {"review_id": "ocihMa7SJJP3qVn-_kX81g", "user_id": "FOsB6GAPLBViDq-j5sbQXg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/15/2017", "text": "I rarely post reviews but I feel compelled to sing the praises of this lovely little shop. As a California native and recent transplant to Fargo, I have struggled to find the kind of food that I'm used to, coffee and bread in particular. I resisted spending 9 dollars on a loaf at the farmers market last weekend, and I'm glad I did...Youngblood offers freshly baked sourdough loaves for a decent price, and it's awesome! Not to mention that my cappuccino was perfect, and I had the pleasure of enjoying a great conversation with the owner while I waited for it. By far, my new favorite place in Fargo for coffee and treats.

A little coffee shop that opens into a small atrium shared by a couple restaurants. I'll probably return if near downtown Fargo and in need of coffee.I had a cortado and it was was well done. Cortados are my go-to at coffee bars since I love a strong coffee flavor and without fail burn/steam the milk when I attempt my own at home. The barista very nicely asked me how I liked it done. This was great because too often cortado are served up with too much milk (it should be about 1:1 espresso to warmed milk). The espresso complemented the drink well and the milk was done right - not steamed like it often is.I followed that up with a straight espresso whose roaster I didn't catch. It was a very bright espresso while I tend to prefer darker varieties. It worked out though as they provide some soda water whose acidic properties take the bite out of the aftertaste. I would prefer a more carbonated water, but that's just me."}, {"review_id": "ltbHZeIVnrGCG-vxdJMj9g", "user_id": "I_OaeAvB12svAsiB_UsAaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/1/2017", "text": "What a magical coffee shop; the macchiato I had was comparable to anything I've had in Seattle, San Francisco, or LA.
