I needed a spot for both a meeting and to get some work done. It was great for both. First of all, there is plenty of seating all around including the bar area, tables inside (don't miss the back room by the record shop!), and even outside on the patio. Next, there is more than just beverages! In fact, there is a large menu of eats ranging from biscuits and toast, to doughnuts and cookies. I opted for a breakfast biscuit with mozzarella, egg, and red pepper. It was super cheap, very filling, and delish. Finally, their coffee is dang good! I got an espresso macchiato and it was perfectly prepared.Overall, I found service pretty friendly. More importantly, the wifi was strong and outlets accessible. I also easily found metered street parking right outside, but do not forget to pay the meter or else a ticket will surely be yours!"}, {"review_id": "aIzhjVHAw66YLp3sf0DdLQ", "user_id": "MPEmzH7YyGWboROeUXmhQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "This coffee is amazing!

Coffee was good, but I was shocked by how unspeakably rude the staff was - and it looks like I'm not the only reviewer who has experienced it. While waiting for my food, I watched the 4-5 women behind the counter. Each one looked like they were angry and resentful that they had to be there, and disgusted by the customers. Sour, dour facial expressions and unfriendly comments. Wow. I  was almost afraid to ask a question and couldn't wait to get out of there, away from the negative vibe. Another customer, who was trying to get the Wi-fi password (they ignored her) said she'd never return.Maybe the staff really, really hate their jobs, or there are serious management issues. Whatever the problem is, it's a shame that these employees are allowed to inflict their misery on paying customers."}, {"review_id": "jqU6_9Rx78UIF68dBuifoA", "user_id": "JOADQwYF3LOLPZsgJXu-_w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Best coffee in Columbia.  Didn't like ambiance, but it was a typical hipster coffee house ambiance."}, {"review_id": "M0kpMEaSq46A7JG60BEQww", "user_id": "zU9_B8fdyFIRJvXfoFaUgw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/14/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Stop here almost every Sunday to start our walk from five points to Main Street.

However, they are super slow. Most days I will come in and grab a bagel on the way to work. I always have to give myself loads of extra time to go to this place because they are never in a hurry. Last time I timed it: from the time I ordered until the time I got my bagel was 13 minutes. And keep in mind, there may have been 2 other people in there who had already gotten their coffee, so it's not like the staff was busy doing something else. I watched a staff member eat a bagel herself before she even attempted to start to fix mine. Staff isn't the friendliest either and they all get super offended if you talk about Starbucks??? Ok.

I can't quite figure out if these are franchises or not, but my prior experience had me hesitant to even bother walking into this one. (Edit 04/15/16:According to the owner, they are in no way connected to the Drip in Atlanta).I'm so glad I did. First, it is absolutely wonderful that the metered parking out front doesn't start until 11 am. Second, after checking out the Loveland Coffee stand yesterday, I was certain that no other coffee shop in Columbia would come even close to comparing. I am so sick of Starbucks though and I figured this had to be better. I ordered a large honey vanilla latte and the pancetta with egg to go. The drink was up first, so I sipped on it while I waited for my sandwich. It was very mild and natural tasting, not overwhelmingly sugary. When the sandwich was finally ready, it was wrapped in wax paper, with napkins and a fork, packaged up in a nice white box, then sealed shut with a little Drip sticker. This was a bit above and beyond what I would expect for a to go container, especially at a coffee shop, and I found it really nice. I didn't actually get to sit down and enjoy the sandwich until about 20 minutes later when I was back at my hotel, and it was pretty great, even though it was cold, so I can only imagine how amazing it would have been if I had eaten it while it was still hot. I just loved the saltiness of the pancetta mixed with the sweetness of the raisin bread. I was sorry when it was all gone.Based on some of the reviews that I read prior to visiting, I was expecting the cafe to be filled with students, but it was definitely more of an older (young but not college young) professional crowd...it was still pretty early though. The service was neither friendly nor unfriendly; it just seemed like the staff was there to do their jobs, not socialize. The general vibe of the place is very hipster and made me feel like I was back in the PNW. I loved it."}, {"review_id": "Gh_y67eq2657rFAV1_WFPQ", "user_id": "u-DxBYfUr7nqOUclrppD4Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/9/2017", "text": "The place is super nice and on a nice road.

I tried their iced coffee and am not a fan. It was too light on the coffee and I felt the need to add milk (gasp) to make it taste better. I would give them another shot and stop by again for a hot cuppa since they were so nice and chatty."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/drip-columbia?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
