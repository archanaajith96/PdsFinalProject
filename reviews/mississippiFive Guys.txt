I had Five Guys before and know I will get a great unhealthy meal. I was craving their burger mostly, but the fries are good as well. The location as convenient to get to from the highway, lots of parking available, friendly staff, efficient service time, and the inside was very clean. The prices are a little high, but the quality of the burger is superb. You can have a double burger with a lot of toppings of your choice. Some toppings are: Grilled onions, A1 Sauce, BBQ sauce, Mayo, Ketchup, Mustard, Lettuce, tomato, and a few more at no additional charge. The burgers are cooked right to order and you can watch them do it. The fries are freshly cut and made to order as well. I love the Cajun style fries because it has a small kick to it. The fries are very greasy though. The burger taste delicious in my opinion. Also, there is peanuts available to take with you. So if you have a peanut allergy, it is best to avoid this business. Overall, I was very impressed with this business. I had a great meal at a reasonable price. It satisfied my craving of a burger. Awesome friendly service to a satisfying meal."}, {"review_id": "2jUjcnI6LtK9uyi2uIi-hw", "user_id": "tg61LnojnImxMcNmBmfNKA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "NOT GLUTEN FREE!!My wife could not eat here.

The fries were hot and fresh the entire time I was eatting them. I bought a chocolate malt to go with it. And wow I am pregnant and so hungry but I had a hard time eatting it all.

When I went in today, the grill chef was utilizing his time to help restock some counter items--making me suspect he was the manager--and was friendly enough to say hello and ask how I was doing.  The server who bagged my little cheeseburger (I could only get through half) & little fries added another big scoop of fries after he filled the cup--sweet & I'll be back to gorge some more.  The server who took my order was friendly and smiling as I walked in the door. And the staff acknowledges customers coming through the door as they open the door.  Engaging customers is always so impressive to me since it lets you know they take total quality seriously. Since the place was packed before 1130a, you know they're good. As usual, everything exceeded expectations.

Juicy burgers perfectly cooked.This visit was my third and the third time I failed to load up the burger with all the fixings. Maybe on purpose. Each time I get a different combination of stuff. (Always unjuns cuz I can't help it). A hamburger is not supposed to be a salad. Taste the meat. Taste the cheese. Sweet onions, crispy pickles, a few savory mushrooms, and vicious jalapeños.  What could be better?  Washed it all down with a cherry ginger ale.The dudes working the place seem like they love there job. Wanna go back tomorrow. Anyone want to split a fry?"}, {"review_id": "jAqIHjFmVTkMsc5grYC8bA", "user_id": "isHZO-WuQlY3IlmQuHosRg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/27/2014", "text": "We typically eat very clean, organic \"real food\" stuff but being as I'm also a human with needs, sometimes I crave a burger, and I've heard this place is good.You go in and order from a board, simple things you can't really change. Similar to Dick's in Seattle. You can see everyone working on all the food and it was very clean. I liked that.The food was phenomenal and the fries? I didn't want to stop eating them.A few observations I found weird as hell though:- You can just scoop random peanuts and eat them from boxes in the back. Why? You're already stuffing your face full of food, why also peanuts?- Some cretins were actually just cracking their peanut shells right on the floor. There was a mountain of peanut shells just hanging out next to the people near us. Who does that? Why would you cause unnecessary work for the people working there? Gross!Anyway, I'm reluctant to go back because about a half hour later, whilst getting groceries I had the worst intestinal cramps in my life - I thought my appendix had ruptured and I couldn't walk straight. I was seriously considering having my husband take me to the ER, it was that bad. Maybe I should have laid off all those fries."}, {"review_id": "qUCv2sdWSxnx0M-pukWK8g", "user_id": "nR63R8KWd2MsKuXVIfX9TQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/26/2014", "text": "Always great burgers.

It's not your run of the mill BK of McD's, so prices are a bit higher but it's worth it.

Same menu and fantabulous burgers as every other Five Guys location.Load it up with toppings, get a side of the cajun fries, and you will not be disappointed.

The next day, we were back at Five Guys.Please hurry up and open a location a bit closer to the NOLA area :)"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-guys-gulfport?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
