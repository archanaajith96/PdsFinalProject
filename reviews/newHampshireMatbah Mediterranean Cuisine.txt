The meal starts with a complimentary plate of fluffy bread with seeds, crispy thin bread, and a small dish with olive oil, olives, and peperoncinos. When I saw manti on the menu, I absolutely had to order this as an appetizer to remind myself of my days in Turkey. These little dumplings are served with a heavy cream sauce - a bit different from what I was used to - and were absolutely delicious. I recommend saving some of the bread that they put on the table to soak up the sauce!For my entree, I ordered the Sultan's Delight, which consisted of tender lamb nuggets swimming in a sea of eggplant puree. The plate was garnished creatively with crispy potato chips and radish slices, which seems to create sails on the lamby boats. The textures and flavors of the dish melded perfectly together. I was absolutely delighted.Boyfriend had the Mediterranean sea bass which was prepared well and also had a lovely presentation. We appreciated the kind service and no-frills atmosphere with a focus on high quality food. If you don't go to Matbah Mediterranean when you're in Manchester, you're missing out!"}, {"review_id": "PMZIBTMF_K8CrRFrKGFZOw", "user_id": "BzS5iUHr_M9fYar_iwfx4w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Three of us went in around 7pm on a Tuesday and it was fairly busy - we were greeted immediately and took seats at the bar. Our order was taken right away, but nobody ever asked us about beverages. I had to flag down a young lady who was bussing the tables/doing expo and ask her for water, and she only brought out one glass, for me. None for my companions. The food was quite good - one of my companions ordered leg of lamb, and it was so tender the meat fell off the bone. I had moussaka, which was excellent. Unfortunately, the service wasn't nearly as praiseworthy, which surprised me considering we were sitting at the bar and our server walked by us dozens of times while we were there.I'd still recommend a visit if you like Mediterranean food - from what else I saw coming out of the kitchen, it looks like everything is delicious - you just need to have some patience. They've only been open for a few months."}, {"review_id": "o7NifDhEPSgbvBtX0K1zTA", "user_id": "-udgjFf5AV7ic2GDLktKTg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "I was very excited to discover this Turkish, Mediterranean restaurant in Manchester!  I went for lunch with a friend and we were both impressed with the freshness and presentation of the food.  It was a very high quality meal, but the prices were a bit steep for the portion sizes.  It was fairly busy and took some time for the food to come out, however the waiter was very friendly.  He also went out of his way to seat my friend who walks with a rollater, to make sure he was comfortable.  I had a plate of three mezes: baba ganoush, lebni, and tabbouleh.  All very fresh and the tabbouleh had a little different twist on the usual, with dill and green peppers.  Would have liked some pita bread to eat it with, however there was a good amount of thin flatbread and another raised bread which came out first, which was enough to eat the mezes with.My friend went Greek and had avgolemono soup and stuffed cabbage.  Both were perfect and delicious.  The soup had herbs and chick peas which brought it to a new level.  I also had kibbeh, which were small but tasty with a unique tahini sauce on top. For dessert I had baklava and Turkish coffee.  The coffee was served on a shiny silver platter with covered cups and a few pieces of Turkish delightThe baklava definitely was the most over-priced.  It was made with pistachios and stuffed with a little bit of vanilla ice cream.  The presentation was spectacular, but the baklava was average.  I would have liked a little spice or rose/orange blossom essence in there, which I am accustomed to in other types of baklava.The menu had many other exciting items on it, and I definitely want to return to try the lamb shank, which looks like a scrumptious culinary masterpiece!"}, {"review_id": "IvSBsle_SWP08zaMpMHWdw", "user_id": "dCTle2T66d6mtoXeEOCQdg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "I have mixed feelings about this place.  The idea of a mid-range Mediterranean place in downtown Manchester seems great.  Sometimes you want more than a quick falafel wrap.  We ordered two dishes: the Matbah Salad and Meze platter.  The salad was great.  Greens, pickled cabbage, and falafel with a tahini dressing.  Simple, but delicious.  The Meze platter was a disappointment.  You get a tablespoon sized portion of 5 different dips, some roasted red peppers, one stuffed grape leaf, and a few olives.  It doesn't come with bread, but you get free bread for the table which is definitely enough for this.  It's not a lot of food, isn't nearly as high quality as the salad, and costs $13, which is ~50% more than the salad.  I'm not sure I would come back here since there are a lot of restaurants in Manchester and I don't live here, but if I was a local I suppose I would give them another shot based on the salad."}, {"review_id": "JHQMmZPp2tL1hl_QJ6v78g", "user_id": "WrWnlXwBy1_MjZoMHxckgw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "In a city where culinary diversity is needed and much appreciated, Matbah stands as a staple of fine Turkish cuisine. While its cozy and intimate shop size may put off some who would rather be secluded to a booth far off from other patrons, you'd be surprised at how comfortable of a setting this slice of Mediterranean wonder is.The collection of chefs that make up the workforce of Matbah's kitchen bring precision and grace to each dish they create. By pulling influence from homemade family recipes and traditional Turkish classics they have allowed not only their expertise, but their passion to manifest a delectable experience for ones taste buds. As someone who has had the pleasure of living locally, my fiance and I have dined at this establishment many a times and have never been met with disappointment. The hospitality that the waitstaff, owners and even the chefs display is bar none. There is always someone to recommend a plate and help direct you to the best dish for you. From the yaprak dolmasi to the kibbe to the lamb shank to the Turkish coffee, you will find there is something for everybody."}, {"review_id": "0k-B0r0XWGXB98P4JyhfPQ", "user_id": "Bco1WVVLtMz67Yi-ilJwsA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/20/2017", "text": "TL;DR: Overall, great quality of food and amazing service. Most dishes reasonably priced. Would recommend for locals and for those just visiting the area!I came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch with a friend. There were a few parking spots near the restaurant, so that was not an issue. I walked in and was immediately greeted by the waitress. Sat down and looked through the menu and she was able to provide great recommendations for the house specialties. We were served free bread, olives, and pickled peppers. They were a good start to the meal. We ordered the Lamb Shank and the Moussaka, both dishes came out very fast. The lamb was fork tender, ready to fall off of the bone. Bulgar pilaf was flavorful, just needed a bit of salt. The Moussaka is comfort food! Somewhat similar to a Shepherd's Pie, this dish tasted great.The chefs and waitress were very understanding in my friend's dietary restrictions and were working to ensure his needs were met. I wish they offered the lunch menu on Sunday, as I wanted to look at the Sandwiches /Wraps, but I should have asked instead of just assuming the dinner menu was only offered. Some of the dishes can be a bit pricey - would love to have tried the Mixed Grill but for almost $30 and what seems to be a smaller portion of food, I decided to pass."}, {"review_id": "vL1x64xmJuF9ZuKeeZC3aQ", "user_id": "k0rdy0leRktppge8Mi47tQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "a month agoSunday afternoon lunch.

It is a small, family run operation serving up beautifully prepared dishes that are authentic, fresh, and delicious. An intimate setting with a gracious owner and master chef - we had a bunch of appetizers and split the whole grilled fish - which was the best I've had and I've had plenty around the world! Fish was served with a simple arugula salad with a pomegranate dressing that was outstanding. We had dessert too - a yogurt like parfait that tasted like para cota, with more pomegranate accents, a sweet carrot relish, and berry compote - unbelievable.. and baklava, served with ice cream.I also had some of the Mediterranean white wine - which was big, smooth, and paired perfectly with the meal.

Super friendly staff and legit Turkish cuisine. The menu has some lovely options. We needed a little help navigating it a bit. We opted for baba ganoush and grape leaves to start and two kebabs; kufta and chicken. The apps came with some lovely bread and olives. Loved both very much. The entrees came but represented a more tapas size vs an entree. We asked for more bread to fill up. Flavors were outstanding. We shared a dessert; a lovely yogurt pudding with house made jams.

The service wasn't but the food more than made up for that. We got the last 2 seats at the bar on a full house Saturday night. Very reasonable prices for the quality of the food. We were going to order some of the specialty bread and dips but we were told they'd bring us some bread and olives. Next time we'll order a dip or two. The bread was super soft and good but needed something to be spread on it. We tried the must order Turkish Dumplings (Dumplings in a Yogurt Bechemal sauce, cherry tomato, sumac, urfa pepper, and oregano). They were over the top amazing! I will order them every time I visit. We tried the Kibbe (Bulgur kofte stuffed with ground beef, onions, pine nuts, parsley in a tahini and with a pomegranate reduction). They were very flavorful. We ordered the mixed grill. It had a little of all the kabobs. It's a must order as well! I look forward to returning again.

It's a restaurant inspired by Turkish,Greek, Middle Eastern CuisinesI started with the Red Lentil Soup Slightly ($5)Zesty Blend of Red Lentils, Onion, Tomatoes, Black and Red Crushed Pepper. It was a uniquely delicious with the perfect kick of spicy. Calamari ($6.75)Rings of Fresh Local Squid, Lightly Fried, Tartar Sauce.  Very tasty, however be prepared for the size of the rings and entire squid. Tartar sauce was typical, but not my favorite pairing with calamari. My friend ordered the Matbah Salad ($6.75) Mixed Greens, Red Cabbage Pickle with Falafels, Tahini Sauce and Pomegranate Reduction. Crazy good!! The falafel were off of the chain good! Shish Taouk (1 skewer) ($4.95)Marinated Cubes of Chicken Grilled. Truly mouth watering chicken cooked as good as chicken can be cooked. Check out my attached pic for the presentation as well!! A must have! I got it with the side order of vegetable medley, fresh and succulent!
