An amazing find.  Walked into the building beautiful and clean. That sat us and the waiter Isaias was a wonderful waiter.  Very professional and attentive. He brought us a delicious soup that comes with a cornbread muffin (which you crumble it into the broth). We order fried green tomatoes (yum) the ranch that comes with it is amazing. We ordered the the chicken fried chicken and the pork chops i must say holy wow. Amazing. For sides we got coleslaw,cream of corn, Sweet potato sufflé. The entrees were amazing.

The food was quite tasty, but the staff were all super cool. If you want to know what southern food tastes like, you have to drop in. My fiancé and I stopped into this joint for lunch this morning and were afraid we would have to wait an hour. As it turns out we didn't have to wait more than about 75 seconds. Pro Tip: they don't have a speaker so if you are concerned about missing your wait call, you'd better hang out inside. After you order you're presented with a basket of rolls, cornbread, and cinnamon rolls (all quite good). I ordered the chicken and dressing with fried okra and sweet potato soufflé. My fiancé ordered the chicken and dumplings with mac and cheese and potato salad. The sweet potatoes had a bit too much nutmeg or cloves (couldn't tel which) for my taste. The fried okra was great. The dressing was a bit runny and the chicken was still on the bone, but I'm not mad about it. The potato salad was mustard based (nothing wrong with that). All in all, it was a fun experience and I'd gladly go back."}, {"review_id": "3Oa50ifIO4IgVN8b7SznFQ", "user_id": "qTs_GibdRA1daay6D3rrbQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "3.5 starsMary Mac's is a local flavor and very \"Atlanta-y\" atmosphere. Interesting concept of writing your own order down. Great service but food was alright. Complimentary cinnamon roll was good. Corn bread was on the drier side. We had to ask to sample their pot licker soup, which was too salty. Shrimp and grits- shrimp was good but the grits were kind of bland and just tasted cheesy. Fried chicken was such a disappointment; batter was bland and chicken was dried. Mac and cheese tasted like it was reheated multiple times. Sweet potato soufflé was cinnamon overkill (and I love cinnamon!) Tomato pie and coleslaw were good. The drinks menu enticed me to try their Georgia Peach martini when it said it came with local peaches but instead I got canned peach (maybe it's locally canned?!)

I'm from NY and I asked everyone I knew from Atlanta where do they recommend. Mary Mac's Tea Room is a staple of Atlanta. The food is delicious and good representation of southern food you'll find in Atlanta. The fried chicken and ribs looked good, but I had to bypass it for the Salmon croquettes (comes with 2 sides) that was recommended on Yelp. My girlfriend got the veggie platter - which is just 4 sides. For sides, I highly recommend the fried green tomatoes, the collard greens and the fried okra. I thought the food was delicious but very heavy. We couldn't finish our whole meal and had to bring boxes home. But looking around us, everyone around us were also packing boxes home. Come to Mary Mac's Tea Room if you're looking to visit Atlanta's cuisine.

It doesn't get any better than this. Although the restaurant itself looks quite dated, you won't be looking around for too long! The staff is super-friendly and attentive in spite of how busy the restaurant was at the time; and our food arrived in record time. Sweet tea is a must! And the bread basket includes fresh cinnamon rolls (not something I've seen before), so consume while still warm. If it's your first time, you are given a free sample of pot likker (a collard green-based broth) accompanied with some cornbread. It's a delicious start to the meal. My order of chicken-fried chicken with white pepper gravy was fantastic -- juicy, flavourful, and hearty without being too heavy. You can choose from a long list of sides, and my choices of fried green tomatoes (light yet bursting with flavour) and cheese grits (nice and cheesy) did not disappoint.We finished our meal with the classic Georgia peach cobbler, which was a relative letdown, when following this otherwise 5-star meal. The peaches are definitely the canned kind, and the crust was quite dry. The two components lacked cohesion, making the dish a disappointment."}, {"review_id": "nhHIIKpcLdnzc-_02YTzeQ", "user_id": "uxXpNnhOKLXrKSeX0ZZ-5Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "For my Birmingham folks: this place is a cross between The Bright Star and Fife's.

The Mac and cheese was tasty as well. My date liked his fried chicken but noted that he had probably been sitting out and had not been cooked to order. Overall, I came for the experience.

If I lived closer, no doubt I would be the Duke of Mary Mac's and a whole lot heavier!The history of Mary Mac's is an interesting story and worth a read on their website.  The short version is Mary MAc's opened in 1945 and today it is the last of sixteen tea rooms that once dotted intown Atlanta. In those days, a woman  couldn't just open up a restaurant, so many female proprietors used the more genteel Southern name of \"Tea Room.\"The menu has a ton of great options for every taste.  I went with our server's (Mo) suggestion and ordered Smothered Boneless pork chop over rice (AKA Mo's Special) with the following sides, fried green tomatoes, tomato pie, and creamed corn. Note that the meal comes with 2 sides, but my stomach wanted at least 4 of the wonderful selection of sides they have available.  So we compromised and went with 3.Somehow, I managed to squeeze in dessert and enjoyed the Bread Pudding & Wine Sauce.The meal, service and atmosphere were all fantastic.  I highly recommend walking here and back if you are staying intown so you work up an appetite on the way there and walk off your meal when your finished.Mary Mac's, I'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "waD03R4I2zWYu53NNwyUYg", "user_id": "KLe-iWI9gWO823GcZEwGMA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "I have been waiting to try out Mary Mac's tea room since my first visit to Atlanta but there was always a long wait for dinner. During this visit, I knew I had to get there for brunch or else I wouldn't have been able to eat here at all! Being from California, I really wanted to experience southern dining and I think Mary Mac helped me experience that. The food was delicious and the restaurant was what I envisioned dining in the south would be like. The service was super friendly and the ordering system was efficient even though it took a long time for me to go through the menu. You just write down what you want on the ordering sheet so need trying to memorize and rehearse your order (;To start off, we were given the pot likker (a cup of broth that came from collard greens and other goodness), cornbread with pieces of pig skin or fat, and an assortment of warm rolls, cinnamon bread, and more cornbread! I love me some warm and fluffy bread! As for the entree, I got to try the chicken fried chicken and the chicken pot pie. Each entree comes with two sides so I tried the dumplings, fried green tomatoes, cornbread stuffing, and whipped potatoes. Everything was amazing but my favorite sides were the dumplings and cornbread stuffing with gravy.... yumm! I also ordered dessert (peach cobbler) which was a mistake because I was way too full to enjoy it. The total for everything was under $35 which threw me off because of how much food we got. If you're visiting Atlanta, I'd definitely recommend trying this place out."}, {"review_id": "VXs9DBRLEh0o1t3I97H1_g", "user_id": "-VlqAFds58L-Z7Gj39eSRw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Really enjoyed dining here. Southern hospitality is alive and well. They have 7 dining rooms and I got to dine in the original room that started it all. The hostess who seated us and our waitress, Karen, were both so friendly and shared the rich history of the restaurant. You can tell that people truly enjoy working here. It shows in their spirit and hospitality. It's so welcoming and refreshing to experience. Now for the food. Do not miss the fried green tomatoes with horse radish sauce. The coating is crunchy and crispy with the warm soft center of the tomato along with the zing of the sauce -- it's a combo worth waiting in line for. Also, try the collard greens. I've never had them, but now I've had the best (my co-worker said they were by far better than any other place he's ever had them). I became strangely addicted to them. There was no bitterness at all and wasn't greasy. The texture was soft and chewy with substance. My friend got smothered chicken breast which is a bone-in chicken breast covered in a light brown onion gravy on top of white rice. He loved it and ate every bit of chicken. Do not miss the key lime pie. It was TO DIE FOR.  Seriously the best I've ever had. Take it to go if you are too full, but don't miss it.Other food:  the cinnamon rolls were very good. The cornbread was dry. The broccoli casserole was ok, nothing to brag about. The fried chicken drumsticks had a nice crispy coating but needed seasoning. The cheesy grits were bland. The fried okra was good, not slimy nor greasy, but not super special. Go here. Enjoy the people. Enjoy the food.

Many times I get full just from the bread. This place is always packed, so try and get here as early as possible, especially if you have a big crowd. The wait can easily be 30 min to 1 hour on the weekends. Parking is usually hard to find. They have a parking lot, but it's packed within 30 minutes of opening. There's street parking in the neighborhoods behind the restaurant, but again, even those areas get packed quickly.

A more professional staff would probably boost business . As it is .. my assumption based on my experience is that the staff is not the reason for the business . The reason for business is probably due to location of restaurant and the fact that it's been around for many many years and is one of the most well known soul food restaurants in Atlanta . If more energy was placed into the hiring process this restaurant could really thrive .The portions were great ! Good size portions of food !The greens were so good ! Not many places can get that right but these green were delicious ! The macaroni and cheese was NOT good (in my opinion and my daughters) it is rare for me to not like the macaroni and cheese somewhere . Very hard in my opinion to mess that up . I don't know what was going on but I want to assume it's the eggs that were in it .. not sure . It was not tasty at all. And for this to be a soul food restaurant that needs to be on point !!! I can't be the only person to have said this about the macaroni and cheese . I just can't be the only one .The bread though !!!! They have the bread situation on point !!!!!

A lot of soul food restaurant you come across either has good food and the dining experience is horrible or the food is bad and the dining experience is good. It was really nice to see a really clean soul food establishment serving great food. The waitress provided us with order cards. These cards are for the customer to write their food/drink order on. We started with cocktails of course. It was happy hour somewhere in the world. The peach tea with vodka gave us all LIFE. The drink was so good my husband asked the bartender for the recipe. Yes, we had to purchase this vodka as it is only made in Georgia. We also received crackling cornbread and liquor. If you're a true Southerner, you know what this is. The liquor from the greens and you dip your cornbread in it. That's what we call good eating and clog your arteries. LOLFor an entrée, I had fried chicken wings, fried okra and fried green tomatoes. The food came out hot and the flavors were pronounce. However, I tried my Bestie pork chop. That pork chop was on point. It tasted better than the fried chicken. Last, but not least. I ordered the Georgia Peach Cobbler for dessert. It was just okay. The peaches were cooked just enough, but still had some firmness to them. Peach Cobbler lovers love CRUST. I didn't have much crust and the crust I did have was gooey. That's a NO NO! I look to my left and my husband is killing his chocolate brownie sundae. Needless to say, I had to help him finish that.
