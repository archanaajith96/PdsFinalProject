Not too bad.We ordered guacamole with a bacon addition - I'd have to say, this was the only low point of the dinner.  It was strangely sweet, no matter how much lime and salt we added.  Entrees came quickly - the chipotle ribs and the chicken enchiladas.  Both plates were extremely generous - the ribs came with white beans, kale and rice in vast quantity under the meat.  The three enchiladas were overstuffed with chicken, corn and other veggies.  I got half with the chipotle sauce and half with tomatillo, but the tomatillo is so pleasantly light and fresh, it's by far the best choice.  I took home two of the three enchiladas - so we could get dessert.  My honey got the Tres Leches, and I got Flan.  You may be tempted to forego coffee and dessert, but let me promise you that it's well worth saving part of your dinner to enjoy dessert in-house.  Both desserts were prime examples of their genre - the flan was rich and custardy, with a burnt brown sugar sauce and light orange sections.  The Tres Leches was creamy and just a bit sweet, with blueberries and strawberries in abundance.  Wait staff at the bar and table are fantastic, and the food is done of the best Mexican American fusion ever. Oh yeah."}, {"review_id": "b9VXABsfN67ZXLDgZIFr6g", "user_id": "Vxf3otji-EQxwLGtwD7lXQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Had the fish special..,awesomely fresh and healthy!Stumbled across this place during my travels"}, {"review_id": "PTWPHZ4Hkskuwpfki28GeA", "user_id": "gYLmEjgqSz9RF3vybDtW2g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Usually a wait, especially on a weekend night but it's nice they allow you to walk down to Collins for a drink while you wait.

We arrived around 7:30 and was told it would be about a 20 minute wait but they ended up seating us in 5-10 minutes. Our server was friendly and quick. The atmosphere was loud but fun! I ordered the beef barbacoa quesadilla and my husband got the spicy chicken tostada. I LOVED the quesadilla. It was flavored perfectly with a little kick! My husband said he liked my meal better than his because the meat was flavored perfectly and sooo juicy and delicious! Not that his was bad, his was really good too! Really I think anything you order here will be amazing.

You won't find a better combination of great food and atmosphere. I've gone to this restaurant multiple times and have never had a bad experience. The staff has always been great. The queso and guac are both must whenever you go. They even have great vegetarian dishes like the veggie quesadilla and I rarely decide to eat food without meats. I've even added meat to the veggie quesadilla and it didn't disappoint. This place is not only good for dinner, but also a great brunch venue as well. The drinks are also amazing and always made how you like them"}, {"review_id": "xbWRy8q8Oni5u9MpkUPcew", "user_id": "FChAOenqRkGTxQ5w-9HrQQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "My parents came to town for a rare visit to Birmingham, and I wanted to take them somewhere amazing. With such a great food scene in this city, picking an amazing spot wouldn't be hard to do; however, there was one spot that was on my mind for this special occasion, \"El Barrio\". This was my third time to this restaurant and every time it's been incredibly delectable. One thing I love is that their menu is full of unique recipes of tried and true dishes. From chorizo meatloaf to bacon quesadillas...and it's all great. This time I ordered Tacos Al Pastor after much debate. I really wanted the empanadas, but I opted for my favorite form of tacos. Their pork was seasoned to perfection and the addition of the pineapple was perfect. The corn tortillas were fresh and warm. I only wish there were more than three tortillas. You may want to preorder extras so you'll have enough. My daughter ordered the bacon quesadilla which I tried. Loved it! Dad got fish, wife got a veggie quesadilla, other kids ordered custom quesadillas with chicken and cheese). The one menu item that blows every other Mexican restaurant out of the water is their guacamole. I am known among friends to make the best guacamole but I think theirs rivals mine. I'm can't go here without ordering some. So delicious!The one drawback is their dining area is small and loud. It's very difficult to get a table and when you do, it's difficult to hear your dinner guests conversation. It's a sacrifice that's ok when the food is this good. We arrived right before it opened (5:00) and got a table because of this concern. This is one of the top 10 restaurants in Birmingham in my opinion. Come here...I promise you won't be disappointed. Happy Dining."}, {"review_id": "UVZrsymqIStD7E2YOsXwSA", "user_id": "GzxkYT58TdYClTJsJsQWMA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Food is delicious!! However, never go when you are starving. The wait can get a bit lengthy at times due to the small dining space. It's definitely worth it though. Margaritas are delicious as well! They have a pomegranate that's seasonal, so be on the lookout for that. Last week i tried the grapefruit and it was really good. My favorite dish is the steak taco. Tasty!! The quesadillas and enchiladas are great as well! The enchilada dish is a very large portion so beware. Worth the wait any day! But if you can, go at lunch :)"}, {"review_id": "2l8cSFNq7uX3BMNi3p-Xgg", "user_id": "7wwKmA5Dv8mUd-TmXPOG1w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Was in town and thought may give this place a try as it looks pretty popular! On a weekday, the wait was still quite long!! I was so starving but we persisted. Ordered the Queso Fundido (4/5) as chip dip. It has tequila, goat cheese, and chipotle. It was so delicious.. I can't stop eating them. But yeah, it could also be because I was SO HUNGRY! The waitress asked us if we also wanted salsa - of course we said yes. But never brought up that it wasn't complimentary. So we were being charged for. We did try some of the salsa...  it was average. Kind of spicy for me. I probably won't get it if I knew ahead of time that it wasn't complimentary. I would much rather just stick with the Queso Fundido! For entree, I tried the Gulf Shrimp Quesadilla (4.5/5). It came with Monterey Jack, pico de gallo, and sweet lime crema. Really enjoyed their quesadilla. Was super warm and almost tasted like pastry. Sooo yummy! Not a lot of shrimp inside though but the tortilla was the best part. The small side of barrio salad that came with the entree was good too. Salad was very fresh! I also had a glass of grape fruit margarita (3/5).. it wasn't very impressive and wasn't very \"grapefruit.\" Do not recommend. My companion also ordered Tres Leches (2/5) for dessert. It came with apple butter, spiced pecans, and dulce de leche. We saw the other table had it and looked so good but honestly it looked better than it tasted. I did try a bite but I didn't like it at all. It was loaded sugar... definitely won't recommend this dessert.This place is still worth trying but if the line is extremely long, I would be hesitant. Some dishes worked better than the other. Definitely try the Queso Fundido and Gulf Shrimp Quesadilla. Service was pretty average. It took a really long time for us to get our food and obviously wasn't informed for some parts of the bill (for salsa). Parking depends on luck since the restaurant is located in a more centralized location."}, {"review_id": "N4azKlvTisuQSu_dRTxFXw", "user_id": "p30VbeNZC6mzRUTL6lg69w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Great vibe.

This place is simply put, amazing! If you are a fan of Mexican food and you haven't made it hear yet it needs to be your top priority. If you arrive during regular dinner time be prepared to wait upwards of an hour...but again it is well worth the wait. If you arrive kind of late during the week you should be able to be seated pretty quickly. During regular meal times it can be a pretty loud environment and you will have to talk kind of loud to hear each other. When you walk in glance to your right and you'll see a daily specials board that highlights the different specials they offer each day of the week. Waiting for crawfish tacos to make a return! Also, really wanting to try the ribs they have listed. Insider tip....follow them on Instagram to get updates as to what the specials are.Tonight we started with an app:Crispy, Warm Corn Tortillas with: Chunky Guacamole ($7.50)For the main course we went with the following: Vegan Tostada with seasonal veggies, refried black beans, crispy plantains & chipotle salsa ($11.50)Tostada Ahogada with slow roasted pork, bbq sauce, jicama slaw & pickled banana peppers ($12.50) - This was mine! Flavor of pork was some of the best I've ever had. Huge portion that was way too much to finish.Drinks:Paloma for Two 11 which is camarena reposado tequila, Lime, Salt, Grapefruit Soda. Have to admit first time ever having this....not the last! Try it if you like tequila and grapefruit.Service here is always good. The service staff is polite and attentive and always in a great mood.Side note, I love the décor here. Several large wall murals. Cool casual vibe that you can definitely not feel out of lace if you get dressed up too! This place is one of the highlights of Birmingham and you owe it to yourself to check them out."}, {"review_id": "rHJYM6n7IIzzsRP22LfWyw", "user_id": "X2utujyHSNpj6wXVmC_xpQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "In my opinion this is the best brunch spot in Birmingham.

I came here with family while visiting for the holidays. My family comes here often and this is their preferred Mexican and date night spot. I trusted their opinion and also felt confident with the positive Yelp reviews; both were dead on. We came on a Wednesday night after Christmas and there was a forty-five minute wait. There's not a lot of room to stand inside and it was too cold to be outside. We got lucky and got seats at the bar within a few minutes and ordered drinks. We had cranberry margaritas, an El Barrio, and a Mezcal. The bartender was friendly and the drinks were good. We waited the full forty five minutes before being seated at a community table (shrug). It's trendy and hip, but also cozy, warm, and very intimate. The cozy, warm, and intimate is what I care about. I really liked the atmosphere and the dim lighting. The community table turned out to be okay because our \"neighbors\" were friendly. We ordered some more drinks and an order of guacamole and salsa. Both were delicious and full of flavor. I had the chile rellenos for my dinner and they were wonderful. I order chile rellenos all the time and these were so different and so good. They are stuffed with black beans, cactus, cheese, pine nuts, and a roasted garlic cream. I will definitely order them again. My sister always has them make a chicken quesadilla even though it's not on the menu. BIL had the Tacos Al Carbon. They both claimed their dishes to be great as always, which is why they keep coming back. We finished by sharing a piece of tres leches cake that came with apple butter, spiced pecans, and dulce de leche. Tres leches cake is a favorite of mine and their rendition was delightful. All in all, it was a wonderful meal and worth the wait. The prices are reasonable. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. The food is delicious. The service was outstanding. It's a definite return for me on my next trip home."}, {"review_id": "jwk2cgXmoy3AXM5zNbigpQ", "user_id": "pADBrHIYqAAJBfn8x0IecA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/17/2017", "text": "Came here for dinner last night with a friend. Due to their reputation for always having a long wait for a table my husband and I rarely choose El Barrio for dinner. Maybe because we are impatient lol. However, prior to going my friend and I called to see how long the wait would be and surprisingly it was only a 20 minute wait. By the time we arrived the wait was around 30 minutes (not surprised). While waiting on or table we had a grapefruit margarita which is my favorite. After getting our table we shared the seasonal guacamole which had bacon, pomegranate, and blue cheese in it. I know this sounds like an odd combination ,but OMG it was amazing!!! For our entree we both had the chorizo meatloaf which was served on a bed of mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach.

Juan was our bartender and did a great job making recommendations, explained all the different Margaritas and made me a great Mazcal, and provided great service!

The Sautéed Shrimp Quesadillas are absolutely jammed pack with shrimp and flavor!  Libations here are one of the best.
