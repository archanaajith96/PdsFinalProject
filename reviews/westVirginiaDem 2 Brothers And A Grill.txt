The second time I went I had a brisket meal (THAT WAS SUPER FATTY) that I got along with another meal to go and they didnt give me one of my sides. I still let that go. This third time I got it to go again and said I will give this black business another chance -- a third chance just to see if they can do better and at this point I was so disappointed from the second experience it had been at least 9 or 10 months since I had been back. I go there 3 days ago and got the brisket meal once again along with a brisket sandwich. Guess what -- the brisket was horrible and fat as hell. Idk why these people cant tey it together when it comes to the meat. The Barnyard BBQ in Teays Valley and Cross Lanes have the better brisket. No fat at all. Idk why Dem 2 Brothers for years now keep selling save-a-lot beef. So if I EVER EAT HERE AGAIN I'LL GET FISH AND I'M NOT SPENDING MY MONEY. P.S. even tho barnyard's meat is slightly better WV bbq is horrible compared to any other place!"}, {"review_id": "nAYRcMjCfN_sDkR8e38EXQ", "user_id": "4xMPgIMKbS766ksOTiKVHg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "So, staying in town at a local hotel for work. Headed down to the front desk to see what I could get into for dinner.  I spoke to the hotel's driver and he started with the usual chains...I stopped him right there.  \"I want something local I can't get anywhere else.\"  This is when he lit up...\"do you like BBQ? I've got the place for you.\" That's how I ended up at D2Bs.I know people like to fall back on old habits while traveling. Break that mold; you're missing out. If I would have taken the Chili's route I would have missed out on this little gem.Walking in; it's nothing fancy or pretentious; which is fine with me.After taking my time to look over the menu, because I didn't know what to get. You know how it is, sometimes your eyes are bigger than your stomach.  I decided on the brisket, ribs, mac & chz and collards combo meal.  Mac & chz and collards...straight out of mom's kitchen.  Ribs and brisket, right off/out of \"plug in the best home bbqer you know here\" bbq/grill.Brisket was tender with the perfect amount of fat and the ribs came came right off the bone.Word of warning...the hot sauce delivers. I recommend getting it on the side.The bar is small but has all the basics.Now...to me the best part of this restaurant was the overall experience. It's family run and owned and I felt like part of that family as soon as I sat down. I enjoyed hanging with the other patrons and watching \"Family Feud\" with one of the founders.Lastly, you can't beat the price.Roll up your sleeves, grab a napkin and enjoy."}, {"review_id": "NE2rcf0M7L66l2oQWaUxdg", "user_id": "dc_1rBcKAjub2Nsh2HBvhA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/18/2017", "text": "What a great find!  This is a no frills place that is serious about BBQ!  The inside is very clean, but not huge (maybe a dozen tables?).  I can see where it could fill up quickly during lunch or dinner.  We sat ourselves right away and were soon greeted.  Ribs were, literally, the best I have ever tasted.  Smoky and tender with a flavorful sauce.  My brisket was great, but it was sliced incorrectly - with the grain instead of against.  Still good, but not as unctuous and tender as it could have been. Tasty sides are tops!  Sweet beans, peppery collards, and a perfectly delicious sweet potato casserole.  Sweet tea is legit.  Staff are nice and welcoming.  Hope I'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "Ew4fnt_ynETkxmCXEiIVpQ", "user_id": "jv7eIqEoEPBXVhcJoYwmyw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Oh my gosh this BBQ was so good! I am not a huge meat eater and I licked the plate clean. The neighborhood looks a bit sketchy but once you get inside all of that goes away. Totally worth the stop. The pulled pork sandwich and ribs- highly recommend! The Mac and cheese reminds me of what my grandma used to make (one of my favorites). Good service as well. Potato salad was delicious, French fries were good, coleslaw was delightful.

The pulled-pork and brisket sandwiches are the best bet in my book. I've had the ribs, which are cut funny on the small bone side, which I've never liked. Still, they are rich and tasty, if not messy to eat, but hey, it's BBQ. The sides like collard greens, sweet potatoes and baked beans are all top notch!

The chopped BBQ pork is legit one of the top 2-3 porks I have ever tried anywhere. The meat is cooked to perfection and their sauce is so stinking good. We also tried the cole slaw, mac & Cheese, and baked beans. I would recommend any of the sides. I've had catering from here as well as directly from the brick & mortar location. HIGHLY recommend! If you see their food truck, STOP and get some! There's nothing fancy about this place, and the food is the star of the show.

I went to their brick & mortar the next day; so I ate there twice in 24 hours. Guess that means love .Arrived back in Charleston today and made a beeline here. Nice to see they moved into bigger digs across the street.  Today's choice was the 3 ribs & 2 sides - Mac n cheese and green beans. That meat is to die for! I don't usually go for beef ribs but these were so tender & smoked just right; the sauce was slightly sweet and spicy, just so good. The Mac n cheese wasn't terribly creamy but still tasted good. I loved the green beans, not quite sure what spices and/or meat they use but it works.Hope I don't have to wait 2 years to come back again!"}, {"review_id": "2ItaJUnr5Pi73wo6V2epaQ", "user_id": "zYy1dFivXlXXK9QUsFFPcQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Planned the stop on the way home to Detroit.

Mac and cheese perfect.

Arrived 11:30AMThe RibsRibs had good hit of smoke, the sauce used on the ribs is outstanding - kind of like sweet baby rays - but the meat was a bit overcooked thus drier than I like my ribs.The Pulled Pork They put their sauce on the Pulled pork before serving - note that if like me, you would prefer to add sauce as needed -. Pork has a good hit of smoke and flavor, but is also a bit dry. The sauce is a thick paste sauce, which while it had a good flavor and great for the ribs, isn't my style of sauce for pulled pork.Sweet potato casserole was pretty goodThe baked beans are good; I added pulled pork to the beans and that made them better. The banana pudding was the best thing they had. Theirs is a thicker pudding, using possibly a heavy cream? It's a bit sweet, but those that know me know I like banana pudding.Service by everyone was great."}, {"review_id": "ExGDB1UTCZPniGa1ZIuW5w", "user_id": "ncMg4o0fev6CCiY0nElt6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "The BBQ is AMAZING!
