Their menu is stacked with excellent choices, pretty much all featuring their delectable fried chicken on top of their buttery, homemade biscuits. I went with The Ellsworth, which consists of their fried chicken on a biscuit with honey, stone ground mustard and house made pickles. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone interested in sweet and savory dishes, as the mustard pairs phenomenally with the honey. Their drinks are also delicious and I would recommend the adult beverages. I tried Mom's Iced Coffee, which includes boxcar coffee, kahlua, and vanilla svedka. On top of all that, our server was friendly and paid a lot of attention to our table. I would highly recommend this place to any breakfast fans!"}, {"review_id": "LI5osqAxRxnSrx_HG9Yqag", "user_id": "5OI0p2CmzdiE8jAu6KtLLQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "They're delicious, but not something I rave about personally. Also, this location in particular doesn't have quite as extensive of a menu as the one on Colfax, but tasty nonetheless. I'm just not that crazy about biscuits, I guess... A friend and I decided to come here for her lunch break, so we were kind of on a time limit. My friend got there about 5 minutes before I did, and asked to be seated so that she can get started on ordering to save time. They gave her a very sassy \"no\" and she was forced to wait the additional 5 minutes before I got in. Kind of a bummer that this is how they operate; I could see if she was trying to be seated for a party of 4 or more, or if the restaurant was crowded (which it wasn't, because it was a cold, rainy weekday), but she was literally just waiting [very briefly] for me. Not the greatest customer service, even if it is their policy. Time is money, quite literally, and my friend didn't want to be late back to work. I'm sure they could have made an exception for a party of only 2 people."}, {"review_id": "C49bD35n1W56FkeZfPNNpg", "user_id": "PQ1BXJ-xkLpbEDdPnoJq3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "My friend recommended Denver Biscuit Co. to me and I am happy to say that I was not disappointed. It's conveniently located inside Stanley Marketplace with no wait time on a Saturday afternoon. The interior decor is super cozy and inviting. It's really a great place to just wind down, chill, and chitchat.Rather than ordering a really high calorie-filled entree, I just opted for one biscuit with the jam trio (strawberry rhubarb, apple butter, raspberry). Wow, best decision of my life! It was a hot jumbo buttermilk biscuit that's super buttery and flakey. I liked the strawberry rhubarb jam the most and the apple butter the least. Sangria was absolutely delicious and does not look like a typical red or white wine sangria! It's pink and tasted like a spiked, fruity soda. I wasn't trying to get lit so I didn't mind that the drink wasn't strong with alcohol.Despite the fact that I did not try one of the signature biscuit and gravy dishes at DBC, I still really enjoyed my visit. Both items that I ordered were spectacular and I would highly recommend this place to any friends visiting Denver."}, {"review_id": "YytqVhKx5IhdntUfSfSRWw", "user_id": "aNZpCfLQEWvE_tFPwf2_zg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Amazing breakfast. Always recommended to out of towners. All the locals already know how great it is. Service is always good. Definitely recommended a weekday if you can to avoid the wait, but the great thing about this location is you can saunter around the market while you wait. Can't miss with the menu. My personal favorites are the shrimp n grits and the biscuit pot pie. So good.

The perfect breakfast sandwich to start off with when starting a day of touring the streets of Denver! Two from the group tried the biscuit French toast and it should always be paired with fried chicken (but that's my personal opinion)!!! Great customer service, and a bit of a wait. I would highly recommend this restaurant if your in Denver...The restaurant is all over the city, but I like this location because it had another restaurant I wanted to try while here called Maria's.

Even if you have to wait for your table there are plenty of shops to check out and the people watching is great.I have to recommend the Franklin biscuit.

With the large portion size, it was basically a Thanksgiving feast.What I appreciated most about this place is the $3 bottomless coffee. There's a coffee station where you can pick from an assortment of coffee mugs (check out the really cute \"Don't Know Don't Care\" mug I chose).

I love the location inside the Stanley Marketplace!

Our server was terrific; able to give us feedback when we asked for recommendations, etc.Our group ordered biscuits & gravy, chicken cordon bleu all of which were good. One glitch was my daughters French toast being cold which they really were not able to solve even after bringing a new order. The butter would not even melt The atmosphere both at Denver Biscuit Company and Stanley Marketplace is fun, hip, cool industrial with a great donut shop; one that sells empanadas, a brew pub, ice cream, taco restaurant, various markets.

No more grand disappointment from craving a biscuit at 8pm only to realize that they've switched over to serving pizza, or sadness because you don't want to wait for a table during weekday brunch. At Stanley, all your wildest Denver Biscuit Co dreams come true!!My new favorite is the DBC Club. I could eat that thing every. damn. day. Layer an amazing biscuit with tomato, lettuce, chipotle ranch, and the best freaking fried chicken in Denver (yeah, I said it...and if you don't believe it, we can't be friends) and I am one haaaaaappy girl.Extra bonus of this location: since dogs are allowed in the Stanley, that means you can eat with your furry friends at DBC! Not inside the restaurant, of course, but they have quite a few tables outside the formal restaurant boundary, as well as pass-through counter seating.

Looking for comfort food without sacrificing your unrelenting desire to be cool? This is the place.  Somehow both extremely hip and extremely homey. On my servers suggestion I had the Franklin. It was too hard to decide between a traditional sausage gravy or the more unique mushroom variety, so they did half and half for me. They are both good, but the mushroom gravy really stands out as the highlight of this dish, which says a lot because every part is delicious. Of course the biscuits are outrageous, it is Denver Biscuit after all. Somehow simultaneously flaky and moist, it anchors this dish solidly in the \"gotta try it\" category. Bacon, cheese, egg (I added it). It's all there, and it's magnificent.Make sure to eat first and walk some of it off at the super cool Stanley Marketplace.

I ordered a bloody mary which was fabulous!! I wish I would've asked for it to be spicy but a few splashes of tabasco solved the problem real quick. I got the Ellsworth and my man ordered the Cordon Bleu. Both came out fast, fresh, and piping hot! I was not disappointed. The biscuit is doughy and dense yet still fluffy. They know what they're doing in the biscuit department. My chicken was perfectly fried, and with the mustard, pickles, and honey, I was in heaven. I couldn't believe how well all the flavors worked together. The tang of the mustard cut the sweet honey and vice versa. The pickles brought the crunchy texture. And the chicken and biscuit were the perfect vehicles for all of the above. Love love love. As for the Cordon Bleu, the ham was delicious and stood out! Service was friendly and I honestly can't believe this place isn't busier on a Saturday morning!
