The people that work here are always extremely friendly and while the place is small it has a great atmosphere.I'm not too out of the box with the foods I try here but I have a few friends who are and have always enjoyed what they ordered (rattlesnake, jack-a-lope, etc.). I usually go for the German Veal and do the Biker Jim's toppings of onions and cream cheese, and I never would have thought I would love cream cheese so much on a brat.They really have a wide option of dogs for anyone and even have a vegan dog that is really tasty! I have never tried something I didn't like on their menu and I will always enjoy stopping into this great spot!"}, {"review_id": "5oxKnevZcYQA-a4flhbWUg", "user_id": "c7_xsZYNs-_G6IceEW2WoA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Definitely a fan. I had the Jackalope with grilled onions. A little too spicy and not as much sweet as I'd hoped, but still very good. BF did reindeer, I believe, with chili and some other toppings - he said he dug it.Fries were good and mac n' cheese bites were YUMMY! The guy behind the counter was super nice as well.

The restaurant itself was spacious and the cashier readily provided good recommendations when asked.My bf ordered an Alaskan Reindeer dog with the conspiracy as well as the Rattlesnake & Pheasant dog with the Biker Jim's classic. I didn't really sample the dogs because I was terrified of eating reindeer and rattlesnake, but they were both quite tasty for him. We also enjoyed Boylan's natural soda fountain. My favorite flavor was the prickly pear and also the cherry.The reason for the 3-star review is for the overly salty house made fries. I don't know if the lid of the salt came undone while seasoning or what, but this has got to be the saltiest fries I've ever had in my life. Ketchup helped a little.Overall, I had a fun time sampling the natural sodas and watching my bf experience the gourmet dogs, but I definitely did not like the fries."}, {"review_id": "tE2Glug7amppJXzssd7vng", "user_id": "04QFf4Kj38HumgkaRCCETw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Unfortunately, this one was just a miss for me. Stopped in with my business partner after leaving the airport and this was my first stop. I loaded up and decided to get 2 dogs, fries, and a chocolate shake. I went with the classic dog, wrapped in bacon, Jim's classic way. It was alright, but I just couldn't get that into it. It was a little sweet with the amount of onions and the cream cheese played into the sweetness. The pheasant/rattlesnack I ordered plain so I could taste the meat. The portion of meat was a little small, cut open, and extremely dry. I ended up putting some ketchup on it which helped some, but it was still super dry and skimpy. Fries were good, shake could have used a little more chocolate. Maybe next time I'll try some other combos."}, {"review_id": "9a3AANPa77HNuWMzrOYyMw", "user_id": "5ss4_ISe69M8kRMlgvmo4A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Can you give a four star review to a fast food joint or a sandwich shop? I mean we all know they're kind of institutionalized, grungy, places. We don't go there for the atmosphere. You go there because the mail it for whatever type of grub you want. If the answer is yes, then Biker Jim's totally gets a four star review. The dogs are the bomb. Options are amazing: elk jalapeno cheddar? Rattlesnake? Reindeer? Buffalo? Jack-a-lope (that's Jack rabbit and antelope)?  What???  Yeah. The hot stuff has heat. The flavors explode. The extra condiment selections are awesome. My favorite dog was the Louisiana Red Hot with the Conspiracy topping. Check it out.

What dummies! It was opening day but wasn't as busy as we thought. However, the place was a mess. No one cleaned up after themselves like they were supposed to! That's the only reason for the 4 stars.I got the elk jalapeño cheddar and my boyfriend got the Alaskan reindeer (yeah, Rudolph is not his friend right now) with the Biker Jim's Classic topping. We didn't know until after that they have a more extensive menu with more toppings! It wasn't on the menu when we went which was a bummer!My hot dog was seriously so legit. It wasn't dry, super flavorful, and definitely hit the spot! I had a bite of the Alaskan reindeer and that was just as good but mine was definitely better. We also splurged and got a drink. Breckinridge soda made with real sugar. So. Freaking. Good.

The Reindeer meat is good, but I've had a reindeer dog from Alaska so it's not comparable at all. The Drunk Pirate topping comes with upslope Craft Lager mustard cream sauce with fried pickled red onions and Trinity greens. The fried pickled red onion gave it a nice crunch. Wild Boar plain was probably not that good because we didn't order any of the special toppings on it. But, I feel a good hot dog should be tasty without all the additional stuff. The juiciness from the meat complimented w/ the bun should still be tasty. The Wild Boar was dry and it lacked flavor. Side of Fried Mac N' Cheese was my least favorite thing on the menu. There wasn't much taste. Service Service was excellent. The gentleman at the register was patient, courteous and very informative about the menu. He took the time to tell us what he recommended and gave honest feedback on the hot dogs he didn't enjoy as much. Value/Price Overpriced! We paid $26 w/ taxes and tip for two mediocre hot dogs and a tasteless fried mac and cheese. Overall, it was an ok experience, but I wouldn't come back here again.

While these are technically more like brats than dogs, they keep fun appeal there. Lots of great topping combos and unique meat blends available keeps it interesting. The BAT dog, which was my favorite, is no longer available due to low demand...story of my life. The buns are good quality, and the cauliflower or fried Mac n cheese make for awesome sides. Boylan's sodas are a big plus.

They set you up for success. So many dog options and even one for your vegans out there! I actually got the vegan dog and it kind of reminded me of a falafel, loved it, and I had it topped with the caramelized onions, and wasabi aioli - sounds weird, don't knock it til you try it.

Massive thanks to Anthony Bourdain's show, 'cause that's how I found out about this place. One caveat however - If you are an out-of-towner like me, finding parking around here is like trying to find a goldmine aka nearly impossible! However we preserved and finally got a spot two block away and trekked to this place. I got the Elk Jalapeno Cheddar and loved the harmonious medley of flavors! My topping was the Drunk Pirate (Lager mustard cream sauce with fried pickled red onions and Trinity greens). To accompany that, I got the small size Fried Mac 'n Cheese for $3.00 and then also a Soda ($2.50) as wanted to try out the varieties available at their Boylan's soda fountain. They had 8 choices available and the flavours I ended up trying were, Cane Cola (pretty good), Lemonade Lime (tartly refreshing), Ginger Ale (yummy) and Eucalyptus (tho that might have been another company).My hot dog and the accompanying toppings was so super delicious! The meat was perfect cooked - charred on the outside and then with each bite a burst of flavor. I could taste the gaminess of the Elk, and the spicy kick from the Jalapeno followed by the cheesiness of the cheddar! The Fried Mac n' cheese was also lovely but honestly, that hot dog was the star and the bun it was in, just complimented it beautifully, letting the meat shine and being just the perfect container to hold all those lovely flavours.I'm a fan and will definitely try and come back to try some more items on the menu (the Rattlesnake & Pheasant and Jack-A-Lope hot dogs are calling my name...!)Yelp 170/2017"}, {"review_id": "k2KpfosZYJwERL-vAjtWVw", "user_id": "nMW6o37ZbrAijYqBtCCatQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "Love love love this place!!  Pick your dog.

I would almost argue that a visit to Denver isn't complete without a visit here. It's a simple concept yet it works great. Here are some things to know:This isn't anything fancy yet is a cut above some of the other dog shacks you may have set food in. You order at the counter. You pick up your food and top with condiments. You enjoy. Wanna keep it basic? Order the all beef dog Coney style. Looking for something more adventurous? Your options range from Alaskan reindeer, to wild boar to elk jalepeno dogs. You can't go wrong with Biker Jim's style which is cream cheese and caramelized onions. Who would've thought that combo would work so well?This is another place that isn't cheap - around $9 for a dog - but you get what you pay for. It's made to order and tastes fresh. Not a bad place to come for a quick lunch, after a Rockies game or for replenishment after a day of brewery hopping.
