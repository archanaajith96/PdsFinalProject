When I saw the high ratings I was excited to try it. I was greeted by Karlo the owner.  He was a delightful man who clearly enjoys serving others with good food. The place isn't fancy but it is very clean. The food is very reasonably priced. The flavor was delicious. I like hot stuff, so I tried the super hot habanero sauce. By itself, the habanero sauce was just hot. Not that full of flavor. When I put the habanero sauce on my burrito the flavors came alive. The whole meal was wonderful. I will try them again. I wish them good luck on their new second location in Westport."}, {"review_id": "xdP19r8vsIRRktYHyHwqsg", "user_id": "FTJ2m7twDEAxGlDyWytx6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "I liked this little spot. It's hidden in little strip mall and appears to be run by the owner. She is very friendly and serving the most authentic Mexican tacos I've seen in this area. I had the steak and pastor tacos and both were delicious. She also has tostadas that she calls \"Little Devils\" I have Chorizo on that. She has a variety of salsas that were good (I always want to try them all). Chips were good but maybe a little thick, I think they are house made which is good though."}, {"review_id": "k_0rVhhSxwdtZ2rjvRcdOQ", "user_id": "xy3vDwGK310Hf2n2JGsiiw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Legit tacos in (North) OP.

Love this place!"}, {"review_id": "A_wO307oJHhU7GOgJ3BEvA", "user_id": "kWujr1NWR5zg4xvsLXpUKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Great find! Fresh made street tacos and fajitas!

This is also my second time using yelp for food recommendations and my second time being completely disappointed. We were in the area and wanted street tacos. We eat often at Bonito Michoacon in Olathe and adore the taste and freshness of their food. But El Fogon has one of the highest ratings in the area. Their street tacos were neither flavorful nor fresh and were more expensive. We left disappointed with the food, price and yelp reviews. We will not be back and have found another source for restaurant recommendations."}, {"review_id": "UDvAnOSemGndx0FAcNOTaQ", "user_id": "VOe7LbHxVhZYzz6rDp5iPQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/16/2017", "text": "I have another taco place I prefer but it's a bit of a drive so this is my second choice. It would be my first if they served them in more than one tortilla or the tortillas were a bit more sturdy. That being said the meats are especially nice although some grizzle in the carne asada. The barbacoa was my favorite. It gets really busy on Tuesday at lunch since the tacos are 1.39. Definitely recommend and I'll be returning soon."}, {"review_id": "aki0wA273icOcuk8i9qr6g", "user_id": "JmTdqoyNpp7Vq7BMP5wgtg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/11/2017", "text": "Carlo and the gang here are producing quality Mexican food, based on the recipes his mother grew up with in Central Mexico.

Both the carne asada and pollo asado were tender and juicy. The tortillas are soft and fresh with a good hint of flavor. All the salsas have a distinctive flavor and work well with the entrees. The only complaint would be the chips and queso. The chips were over-fried, which when paired with the heavy and salty queso fell short as an appetizer. Overall, a great meal for the price."}, {"review_id": "hb5MTAhb46LFNlaOhraOfQ", "user_id": "MAQoYi4R357FL1eLhrSrOA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Taste was not the issue here but rather the stinginess of the staff and the pricing - have never been to a Mexican restaurant (especially one that is not upscale) that charges you for chips and salsa. You can only get small plastic containers to pt the toppings in IF you are ordering to go only. Tacos were good but not exceptional and they come with the meat only so you build yourself, tostada de carne asada was actually quite good though."}, {"review_id": "h7io88QwFsd4bue_PESycQ", "user_id": "YuYmnwPALn_0tL3BHLvdTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Went there today for lunch.  The person at the counter was very pleasant and explained everything on the menu as it was our first time in the restaurant.  The food was served fairly quickly and was flavorful.  I like that I can get the amount of food I want to eat by select smaller portions sizes and pay only for what I got.  $1.99 for 1 street taco, you can't beat that deal!"}, {"review_id": "4R2S7xjERgsd5kC8xS4M-w", "user_id": "GUMV1seXc5-JjlodoDO3Cw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/31/2017", "text": "Visited El Fogon based on Yelp reviews. The spot was small and felt like a hole in the wall. They had a few selections, including tacos and bowls and fajita platters. I ordered 3 tacos- one carne asada, one pollo asado, and one al pastor. The tacos come bare (just the meat and tortilla) and you can top them with whatever you want. I liked that they had the classic toppings (cilantro, onion, salsa verde, radishes, lime, etc.) it was a good selection. Double tortillas would have been appreciated but I'll make sure to ask next time. I think the tortillas are a big component for the taste of the tacos and if they had been handmade it would have made a difference. Regardless I will be returning. Everyone was friendly, the spot was clean and the service was fast (especially for tacos)!"}, {"review_id": "lih3fYtobFABHZFxuuwjfA", "user_id": "oMEpAhyxo-2QBxN2mPvn-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/29/2017", "text": "All the food I've gotten here has been great!
