AMAZING!I am out of town and was looking for a nice dining experience for two. My sister suggested this restaurant and it was a hit. Since it was a Friday night, I made reservations ahead of time. We arrived at 6:00 p.m. and was seated immediately. We were given a nice table by the window. The menu was straightforward with a perfect amount of options. It was simple to understand and everything sounded delicious! We started off with the Russian dumplings which were​ out of this world. Who knew dumplings could be so good? I ordered the duck dish​ and the flavors were like no other. I don't even enjoy eating duck and it was that good. The crispy breading on the duck kicked it up a notch. It was plated with vegetables and a kale like salad. I did not care what it was, I just ate it because it was so good. My guest ordered the salmon and it was delicious as well! Overall, A+ customer service! Our waiter was attentive and paid​ close attention to details. It was an amazing dining experience! This is a great place to take a date or to celebrate a special occasion.Thanks to the team here! I can't wait to return. SUPERB!"}, {"review_id": "LzAQniwOzvrHBTpmX2glqA", "user_id": "d4vqfqDzNFvYppXMPjJrow", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "I wanted to go with a higher rating here, but the service we received was rude and not good at all. I took a large group of colleagues to this place - made them drive much further than I wanted, but expected something great!The greatest thing here was the selection of food that isn't available elsewhere, but that shouldn't mean service is sacrificed. The first women I spoke with was rude and obnoxious - if I was just with a couple of friends - we would have left, but our party was too large to just leave.However, the pricing and food selection was good. Way too noisy and those darn flowing curtains were just odd!"}, {"review_id": "orICXhwVOez68dIYZQtn5g", "user_id": "FOSUPZpTKUWfjMKNWzR04w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "Took my family here for a celebration.

The fries were by far the best part - they are chips with delicious dipping sauces - YUM! The Mushroom & Spinach Blintz and the Pelmeni were ok, wouldn't order them again. Overall - go for the Chips and drinks. Past that, probably not worth it unless you live nearby!

I liked how different the foods were and how everything seem pretty true to what I would think Russian cuisine would entail, but out of the 4-5 items we ordered for happy hour, nothing really stood out to me (except for the potato wedge type fries + its sauce). Come here for a decent deal on drinks for HH but I'm not sure I would recommend it for a full meal.

I do enjoy a martini here and there and this is the place to order one. I like mine dirty to the point I usually ask for more olive juice or say \"filthy\".  I trusted the experts and was not disappointed. It was so good I actually order a second.Due to other plans for dinner, we just had a couple of drinks and the beef tartare appetizer (very good!). I definitely want to go back and try the sputnik martini after reading more of the reviews.As far as the atmosphere I initially thought it would be more of an older generation as we were walking up and could view the main dining area. But once inside the bar area and the dining area to the left of the bar was a great mix of all ages. One of my favorite things about the restaurant was the man playing the accordion, he will even stop at your table (for tips of course). It is a very intimate atmosphere and has a lot of great historical and authentic Russian décor.I will say the service at the bar was a bit slow, but it was also a Saturday night and I think they were making martinis for everyone in the restaurant.Would recommend this to anyone in the area or looking for something different.  Can't wait to come back!"}, {"review_id": "DKt3xpPH3rbkidvAFDILlQ", "user_id": "mRGDHTtWYXzwVzeju-f1Rw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "So finding Russian Food in general is pretty rare in the Twin Cities. I was told this was the best place to get some. So i came here with a larger party, about 16 people. My friend called ahead for a reservation but it was so busy with the Crash Ice event near by they were needing seats. So when less than half the group arrives, they wanted to give some of the table away. Lesson of the story tell your party to come earlier than the reservation. Food! So I was able to try the cheese bread. I would get the cheese bread as it is super yummy and it is so pretty being a boat of cheese. I got the Vareniki (Veggie Russian Dumplings) as I did not want to much pork. The half size is perfect for those who have a smaller appetite. Food was solid for sure. The drinks pretty reasonable price and have a great flavor. A big plus is the service is pretty amazing. Our server was pretty attentive and the person who plays the accordion was really nice to play happy birthday in Russian. Moscow on the Hill is great place to try some Russian food if you not had any."}, {"review_id": "so0wp6U_LLCwQo1FjZwpxg", "user_id": "wRB4ydleVCuCHDS8kIIkNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/4/2017", "text": "One of my favorite places in Minnesota. It's a place I always bring friends and visitors from out of town. Everything about this place is great from the food and drinks to the service and atmosphere. Their drinks are amazing and include their house infused vodka. The food is also incredible and please don't leave without trying the dumplings (everyone at the table agreed that the vegetarian dumplings are the best). Also, the cheese bread appetizer was a huge hit and the grilled salmon is my favorite. Portions are huge and even the \"small plate\" of dumplings includes 10. Prices are also decent, especially for the drinks. Service is always great whether it's two or ten people. They take reservations so if you want head there on a weekend I would take advantage of that because it can get a little busy. This is a great place to go for dinner, dates, or drinks with friends."}, {"review_id": "-KEEk2REubGguZ1FWYaqCg", "user_id": "b5VKxI7ODnvJJIBzWqw5QA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/26/2018", "text": "Sorry, MOTH just doesn't strike a chord with me.I've visited three times over the years, once for drinks outside, then dinner outside, and then a group dinner inside in December.The outside seating is okay, but walled off from the parking lot and neighbors, so nothing special. Service was spotty when we went for dinner.I'm of Russian heritage (actually the Slovakian/Ukraine border region), so I enjoy the Old World recipes, but MOTH doesn't stack up against Hammer & Sickle in Uptown on a number of dimensions. Interior seating is tight (reminded me of a NYC eatery); the recipes were good but not exceptional; and the beer selection is in need of a major overhaul.While there is nothing to rant about, there also isn't anything to rave about. Hence, the 3-star review.

Parking isn't the best, you have the option to pay $5.00 at the YMCA parking lot next door or find parking in the neighborhood. Either way you have options.  The restaurant may look \"normal-sized\" from the outside but then you enter into two large dining rooms both with wonderful lighting and decor that instantly put you at ease and feels like you're in the home of Russian descendants. If you have the opportunity to eat on the outside patio take it, a beautiful closed-in patio with plenty of seating. The martinis were top-notch, some of the best I've ever had and the drink menu has tons of options not to mention vodka flights.Now the food, the restaurant has a diverse menu with tons of flavor. I had the Czar's medallions for a main dish and they were to dieeeee for!

Growing up in a Polish family, I have a huge soft spot for Eastern European food, drink, and people. This is my kind of spot. We walked here after eating dinner elsewhere with the intention of having a couple of after-dinner drinks. We tried the dill and horseradish vodkas. Amazing. These people know their vodka. I wish I could've sampled more of their house infused vodkas, but I didn't want to end up on the floor... We also sampled one of each of their in-house brews, a lager and a dark brew. Both were extremely satisfactory.We didn't intend on sampling the food menu, but I've never been able to pass up a bowl of barszcz/borscht. We ordered a small cup to split. It was amazing. It tasted just like home. I loved our Belarusian bartender. She was kind, and seemed to be dealing with a rather rude crowd of drunk businessmen. She handled it well. I may or may not have left her a note on a napkin that said \"dickhead\" in Russian, with an arrow pointing to said rude individuals....Can't wait to come back!"}, {"review_id": "sKjVmCu_OphSSLdbAsgCAQ", "user_id": "zWkuoT0Ig3gNr_HhC4ntdw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/7/2017", "text": "We came here for my boyfriend's birthday last Friday and it was so good. I'm going to be honest, I did not want to eat Russian food nor did I have any interest in vodka drinking, but I'm a fan after my visit.A lot of items I could not have due to my dairy allergy, but I saw the duck and was so happy I got it. It was fantastic and I would get it every weekend if I was in the neighborhood. We tried a charcuterie board (zakuski) of different types of pickled vegetables, spreads, and crackers; vodka shots; stuffed cabbages; and plenty of dumplings.The portions are hearty (not a summer bod place), so you won't leave hungry. It's cozy inside with great service even for a busy Friday evening.

Even though I only stopped in for appetizers and drinks, I was extremely impressed by the menu and will certainly be visiting for a full dining experience.The cocktails are not very strong, but are tasty and very cheap. But when you come to Moscow on The Hill, you come for the vodka, you stay for the vodka, and at some point, you have to leave because you've had too much vodka. I love the variety and opportunity to taste vodka in a setting that's not a grimy college kitchen in a questionably clean shot glass.The appetizers are a perfect match to the vodka tastings, and the bathroom has cool instructions on how to drink vodka. The intimate atmosphere, overlooking a gorgeous part of the Cathedral Hill neighborhood, as well as a live accordion player, were notable."}, {"review_id": "bGtE4C93xnIbVrNl5j4QWg", "user_id": "iijKuZZlw-ZMgmracgWcPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/12/2017", "text": "Food: The dumplings are amazing!
