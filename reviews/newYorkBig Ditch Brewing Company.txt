So helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. He recommended us great options to drink/eat and everything he suggested was perfect!! Ben was a pleasure to have as a server. Drinks I got the flight of beers as shown in the photo all of which were soooo good. The Deep Cut drink I had was STRONG AS HECK ..Haha sooo I'd drink that once you had some carbs in you. The 3 to the left of it were all citus tasting..great drinks. The one to the right was a deeper flavor. Whiskey based if I recall correctly. I loved them all. Food We got the Margarita Pizza.. great pizza especially if you're looking just for something simple. Can't be disappointed.Bacon Cheddar cheeseburger!! SUCH A GREAT BURGER!! juicy and flavorful. We got the garlic mayo added to the side which was awesome also!! Their tator tots were so good tooLastly we had their pretzels!! The mustard was awful unless you like the taste of horseradish then you'd love it haha. The cheese sauce was good though:)Overall I can't wait to come back here. Everything was just so great:):)"}, {"review_id": "ZOcd3cprzo1TwdiAtQq1AA", "user_id": "gjeMsVTaCBfAorO_GTNXlg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "$9 Tater tots.

No shade. I mean it, I love coming here mid-drunkenness or during a hangover to help me get my sh*t together. You know when you have that need for that perfectly greasy and filling meal to bounce you back from those shots of Tequila and Henny you foolishly promised yourself you wouldn't overdo. Nice crowd. Plenty of seating, two eating areas downstairs with a bar on both floors. Food menu ranges from $9 - $30-ish so be prepared to spend some cash if your really hungry and insist on getting an appetizer, soup, entree, dessert & drinks (someone has the munchies). I recommend the Wild Mushroom Burger.It was juicy cooked to medium rare to my liking. I love sweet and savory food so a burger with caramelized pears, roasted garlic and mushrooms was right up my alley. They do have a small menu for the kiddos, a word search and trivia puzzle to keep them at bay until the food comes. They have a drink menu dedicated to craft beer. Luckily you can ask for samples if your still trying to find your taste for it.Fear not they do have some wine, a SMALL cocktail list and public espresso coffee if your driving. Bottom line I can say parking isn't the best, the wait time can be unreasonable (during games and weekends respectively). And the place can be complete chaos at times, but worth it if your already downtown."}, {"review_id": "QSCs8ZnveDHoJw3zNYERDw", "user_id": "3cKeau160aL_1lM028JMNw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "Honestly I was pleasantly surprised to see what kind of crowd was here. People look like they have their lives somewhat together and just want to enjoy a nice beer with a couple of friends. This place is exactly for that, but if you want to get completely smashed, head over a couple blocks to Chippewa. Friday night, place was bumping. Wasn't empty but was crowded either. Really cool menu to pick from. Got a decent amount of things on their. Got a lot of darker drafts on hand, for people who like those type of beer, you're gonna love it here. I recommend the pretzels to soak up the heavy beer, maybe some pizzas and burgers for those not heavily drinking. Their drafts are cheaper than other beers listed on the board so if you're looking to get a couple drinks in without dropping bank, I recommend trying out what they make in house. A flight was around 10 bucks, give that a go. You'll get the  opportunity to try out the many beers they make without paying a lot to do so. Place is great for small groups, upstairs is a little more laid back, has another bar upstairs and they have some darts boards, who doesn't like a game of darts while knocking back a couple. There's a fireplace with a couple of couches and a shuffle board!Parking is off street and can be hectic especially in downtown buffalo during weekend, better brush up on your parallel parking skills! And remember kids, don't drink and drive."}, {"review_id": "etLu9XaME-5rUtc_oY2LDQ", "user_id": "oVoucnaIIcg42Z28oOGgYA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Great atmosphere for a Friday/ Saturday night!

Only problem is because they are busy some of the food was cold. Great assortment of beers to try: ciders to IPAs. Lots of local influence to chose from especially if you are new to Buffalo.

We came here on a Saturday night for some girl time and even though it was crowded, the front desk staff got us a table in a reasonable amount of time. Service: Beware - if you're coming on a Saturday night, it gets LOUD! It wasn't really a problem for us, but we didn't realize just how crazy this place gets. I agree with other reviewers about how slow the service can be. Our server was very friendly and responsive, but it was obvious that she was juggling a lot. We didn't even get water until we were nearly done with our food and we asked for some. Food: I initially got the chicken & biscuits but I actually sent it back - it just wasn't appealing and I'll leave it there. All three of us got burgers which were a good deal for the price! I enjoyed every bite and I love their signature dipping sauces for the fries (you can also just get plain ketchup if you want). I'm not a beer drinker, so I got a glass of Riesling - not sure why a (maybe) 6 oz. glass of wine was $9 but ok! We thought that was a bit pricey. Overall, I'd come back. Big Ditch is a great addition to the vibrancy of downtown."}, {"review_id": "uSIjFjoDnemoQi4VuYuzTg", "user_id": "mH5frU-FkhEkQ1ITa_fm5Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "Cool place to check out with excellent food and beer!

I also quite enjoyed the music selection they had. It wasn't blasting and I would have to listen carefully to hear what was playing but it was a great playlist. Food:     3.5/5I came here in a group of 6 and we all got the bacon cheddar burger or chicken biscuits. The food took around 40-50 minutes which I think is really long for some burgers and chicken biscuits. It wasn't amazing or anything for the time we all waited. It was mediocre. However, if you order one of their entrees, it comes with fries and a signature sauce! I got the garlic mayo and it was tasty. Drinks:     4/5I am a huge fan of beer so finding a nice brewery was a pleasant surprise in buffalo. I love IPA beers so if you are also a fan of hoppy beer (or however one says it) I highly recommend Deep Cut. My group ordered the flight of five which is 5oz of 5 types of beer of your choosing. I chose Deep Cut since it was a double IPA, which I never tried. I was not disappointed! I ended up ordering myself a serving of it for myself cause I enjoyed it haha!Service:   4/5I wasn't able to get my waitress' name but she was very sweet to us. She checked up on us and brought everything we asked for very quickly. Although we had to wait a while for our food, the drinks came quickly. TLDR: It's a typical burger joint that serves a lot of local craft beers. The food is mediocre. The drinks are great (Try the \"Deep Cut\")"}, {"review_id": "jW5xrRhiuHtVek_dZBp_BQ", "user_id": "AhLHeJ9BKy-NaPUbuA0Ttg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Awesome place!

Place wasn't as busy as expected due to octoberfest in ellicottville. The atmosphere is bright, open, and clean. My guy and I sat at the bar and ordered some beers. I got a flight of 5 for 10 bucks. We happily chatted away with the bartenders who were super friendly and knowledgeable about the beers and recommendations for dinner. I believe their names were Jared and Megan, maybe? Anyways we totally enjoyed their conversation about anything and everything. The food- we ordered wings and a meat lovers pizza. The wings were great. Read on a previous review that the hot were super hot so we decided on the medium. The pizza was HUGE. I liked it. But the banana peppers overpowered the flavor of the pizza. The beer- the flight is the way to go. It's a great way to try different things. Of course you can samples of anything on the menu. And I also tried their Bloody Mary. It was pretty delicious and spicy just the way I like it. I would have to say that the bartenders kinda made the whole dining experience great. They really welcomed us and we enjoyed their company. It was a great way to end a great afternoon.

The ambiance is wonderful, the beer is great, and the food is some of the best in the city. There isn't another brewery in Buffalo that nails all three of those areas (we have other great breweries, but few offer good food, and fewer have well-branded spaces). I also love that they bring in local guest taps; I'm a huge cider fan, and they always have local ciders on tap (BlackBird, Steampunk, etc.)I should add that I love this place so much that I got married here ;) We rented out the beer hall, which comfortably accommodated about 90 people. Everything was perfect. The space itself is super cool, the wait staff went above and beyond, and Raven (the assistant GM who helped us coordinate everything) was a God send. Our guests were raving about the food and service, and the overall pricing was reasonable. Truly a perfect night.I honestly can't say enough about this place. My go-to-beer is the Hayburner IPA (Cinnamon Apple is a close second). All the food is great (and we've ordered almost everything on the menu), but my faves are the soft pretzels, the pretzel chicken and the breuben. And regardless if you're hungry or not, get the excavator cake for dessert. It's the most decadent chocolate cake you'll ever eat.

The food is always good and the service is always attentive. Only a 4-star review because despite Big Ditch having good beer and good food and good service... I've never been wowed. This place is big and bright and an awesome location but it always falls into the category of \"perfectly adequate\" without ever nailing it. I'd suggest it to friends, I'll go back again, but I'll never rave about it and I'll never say it's a place you just HAVE to go to.

Everything was quite good! You have to have certain expectations going into a takeout experience and you have to realize that it isn't going to taste as good as if you say down and ate in house with the food fresh out of the kitchen. That being said, we were still impressed. We ordered the friend chicken sandwich, which had a delicious honey sriracha sauce on it that was a revelation, which came with fresh cut fries and a side sauce, which was orange chipotle ketchup. The fries retained crispness and the sauce was very tasty! We also got a pork schnitzel sandwich, again with fries and we chose a garlic aioli that apparently changed my friends life, for the better. We ordered the hayburner Ipa wings that had great flavor but unfortunately were not crispy. We also got a side of Mac and cheese that I have to say is potentially the best three dollars ever spent. It was so good and so cheesy with my favorite pasta, cavatappi! It's not the cheapest takeout so it was more of a splurge for us but everything was good. I look forward to coming in to to eat and have a few beers in the near future."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/big-ditch-brewing-company-buffalo?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
