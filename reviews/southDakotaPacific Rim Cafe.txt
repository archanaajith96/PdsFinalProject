Sure, let's give it a try!It was a Tuesday lunchtime when we came.  Here's what I had:VIETNAMESE ICED COFFEEIt looks like this was already pre-made by the picture and served over a tall plastic cup that says \"Coca-Cola\" on it.  So don't expect the drink being served the traditional way: in a small metal drip filter.  It tasted good to me--sweet.  SPRING ROLLSI was skeptical at first, but ended up being quite impressed! Although I've never had chashu pork meat in Vietnamese spring rolls before, this was decent! I always loved it when there's crispy egg roll wrappers in it for some crunchy texture!  The peanut sauce was good too--sweet!  PHO - COMBO - Thick Noodles - Small - $9.25Meatballs, Brisket, Tendon, Rare Beef, and Tripe.I never seen a thick noodle option for beef pho before so I thought I gave t a try. It was fine. I assumed it would be the wider and flat noodles. I should have chosen the thin noodles.  The rare beef is already in the bowl and fully cooked.  The brisket was fine.  I'm used to something more tender.  The meatballs were actually sliced and tasted ok.  The tripe and tendon were good. As for the overall broth? It was fine. I'm no pho snob, but this was a pretty decent bowl.Overall this place wasn't bad!  The place is clean, the food was decent, and the staff was friendly and did their jobs well! We each received a fortune cookie!"}, {"review_id": "eUuCsaq0lVXoRGqBCNI41w", "user_id": "RKUz3QKVucEVZOjh-m4XVA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Service was great. They brought my 4 and 7 year olds modified (banded) chopsticks to use. Solid good Pho. Low Mein was standard but the mandarin chicken was really good.

Open on Christmas Eve, could not have enjoyed better customer service from staffers Guitar and Ruby. Food was outstanding! Great pho, huge portion. Excellent dinner with multiple items, all superb. Clean, fun artwork, roomy, fairly priced, clean bathrooms, great items located within premises. Hope I get here again, as it was such a positive experience."}, {"review_id": "4kWsdJfD8AZgbkO_ABLqXg", "user_id": "_YcrMA9b7_lUiYotSLLrtQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/26/2017", "text": "Pacific Rim Cafe was a tropical surprise in western South Dakota.The food: The food was delicious. The chicken pad Thai, Vietnamese egg rolls, and even the stir fried veggies with tofu all tasted great. The real treat was the fresh coconut water. They bring you a shaved down coconut that you tap and drink right at the table! Check out the pictures.This water was probably better than any canned or boxed coconut water that I've had to date.The service: The service was friendly and helpful in explaining the options for our dishes.The value: The prices were good compared to what they delivered to our table. Our food was excellent and the bill was not too much.This place is definitely worth trying if you are looking for something a little different than standard meat and potatoes."}, {"review_id": "y4Z4HE_hSe_XqmZIZuM-Qw", "user_id": "H18t-Mkalz-ciYSC-AoB7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/6/2017", "text": "South Dakota and good Asian food?

Chinese appetizers, pho, and some randomness on the back side. Don't remember stir fry listed at all, but maybe I just missed it.Was seated immediately and ordered a soft drink, but it didn't come for a solid 15 minutes. Had to ask another waitress and then remind mine before it finally arrived.Saw a Vietnamese family sit down and order pho. They didn't seem impressed with what came, though their conversation wasn't in English. Now I'm not one to order outside of a restaurant's specialties, but apparently pho wasn't it. So I flipped the menu over and odered a Cubano. I don't know if they used too much oil, had stale bread, or left it on the grill too long... but it definitely went past panini-like crunchiness straight to like-a-brick block. Plenty of black spots on the bottom, I assume from not scraping the grill before throwing my order on it. A bit light on ham, could have used twice as much.The green apple slaw was pretty good. I'll give them that."}, {"review_id": "Ad4Nqa2AYQpJsYPpv-KmRg", "user_id": "TAMfF2Mo3Qwbu2TYhGfG4Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/17/2017", "text": "Delicious pho, great price for the amount they serve.

They don't have fish sauce on the table, but have a big bottle of soy sauce. That in itself tells you the audience they are catering too.  The pho tastes decent, but you will suffer from excessive thirst afterward. There's a lot of msg in their broth. The veggie side plate with bean sprouts and basil is very small and skimpy. You'll have to ask for extra. The fried tofu appetizer is good, but the pics on yelp are deceiving. The pieces are tiny! Not worth the price in my opinion.Had the chicken wings and they were good but a tad on the orangey-yellow side. Not sure if it was their batter or what was going on with the color.Got the lo mien stirfy noodles and that dish was good.Overall this place is decent if you need an Asian food fix.  They have a few vegan options which is helpful for veggie eaters.  The location is right in rapid city near the mall.  There are a lot of restaurants near this place also. I appreciated the fact that this restaurant was very clean and smelled cleaned. The waitresses were very friendly too."}, {"review_id": "RFy4P2-hSlfliyRwCR0Q_g", "user_id": "skLoxMsBSenFiXmL0CPcww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/18/2017", "text": "Recently moved from California, its been really hard to find a legit Asian restaurant in SD. This is by far pretty close to the pho i get back home. Though its not exactly the same, the main components are there. I had large P2 pho (vermicelli noodles with rare steak on a hot broth). The broth is good and flavorful but not like 'super flavorful'-still great. Noodles and fixin (lime, bean sprouts, and leaves) are present. They also serve chinese food but didnt try them. If you're just craving for a 80%  legit pho- try this place. Service and restaurant appearance is good. Not dirt and servers are attentive.

The pho here is about the same as the ones I get in NYC! Not bad for a place in the middle of nowhere. The broth was rich and the portions were big, the combination is definitely the way to go. I noticed other reviewers highlighted the bad service but I didn't get any of that? My server wasn't a teenager either, she constantly checked up on us, refilled our waters, answered all our questions about the menu. I had absolutely no trouble with her at all. The only downside here is the vermicelli noodle salad, the noodles were served hot when they're usually suppose to be cold (salad, hello!) and the egg rolls tasted like the Chinese rather than Vietnamese, the wrapping wasn't crunchy either. 3.5 stars but I'm rounding up to 4 cause of the  free wifi, it's like South Dakotans know there isn't any cellular service here. Thanks for saving my ass and letting my google maps work its magic. P.S.
