Always wanted to go back and try other stuff which happened only this week after a gap of an year. The food was really yummy and our waitress was very helpful and courteous. To top it all the owner visited our table, overheard me trying to convince my daughter to eat more and helped put by promising her a brownie if she finished another slice of that yummy pizza. What a motivation that was In the end she even posed for a picture with my daughters. Awesome experience."}, {"review_id": "Q6Xi0ySvpPadCEPCAjDCOg", "user_id": "76TqU4dweJciWy1WvoW-rA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "We had a bit of a disappointing experience at Biaggio's in Allentown. It was the traditional last night before Passover starts pizza offering, and this was our choice.Initially I was excited that they offered complementary Randy or white wine. Free wine! At a restaurant! Count me in! Unfortunately this wine  Also, the line was served in plastic cups which was strange.For an Italian restaurant, which theoretically has lots of vegetarian options, this place wasn't particularly vegetarian friendly. For example they had many many salad options most of which automatically had chicken in them. I'm sure you could order it without the chicken but if you're going to have such an extensive salad menu, shouldn't you have vegetarians in mind in the choices that you offer as defaults?The portions are fairly large on what they offer which I'm sure is exciting to America gets excited when there's so much food on the plate.Our kid had the macaroni and cheese. The macaroni wasn't particularly good and the fries, where is they looked good, were coated in something. Rule of thumb for french fries - if you can't make decent regular french fries, and have to rely on coding them in something, you shouldn't be offering french fries at your restaurant. Also rule of thumb for macaroni and cheese for kids...it should always be the basic mac and cheese. If a kid doesn't like your mac and cheese, you have strayed in the wrong direction.Most of us were sharing a large cheese pizza. The first pizza came out under done, the crust was mushy. We had to send it back. Ultimately the end result wasn't that great.One of us got their gluten-free pizza. Kudos to you Biaggio's for offering gluten-free crust, however you did get the order wrong...it was ordered without cheese and, sure enough, came with cheese. It had to be sent back. Also the mushrooms topping tasted canned. Canned vegetables of any kind do not make for good tasting pizza.I hate to right off of the pizza place, but this is the East Coast for god sake and pizza everywhere should be awesome. This was our experience here at Biaggio's, and we likely won't be back."}, {"review_id": "UJeGAT_XBOL6DN9U7XuILg", "user_id": "JNqcv2-EGHwWUKtVw-31QA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "I LOVE Biaggio's! The food is great and whenever I order out for delivery, they are always on time. Their cheesesteaks and pizza are out of this world! The sizes alone are nothing short of amazing! They have many different varieties of french fries/appetizers. I recommend the buffalo style fries with buffalo sauce and cheese drizzled on top! If your mouth isn't watering reading this, I don't know what to tell ya. I definitely recommend this place to anyone I happen to come across who lives in the area. The only turn off I can see is the restaurant itself is very small inside but they play older music (50s, 60s style) and have a very vintage feel so it makes you feel like you're back in the day. It may be a drawback for some but I personally love that about it!"}, {"review_id": "AuhOdBlIuisrOrX-wXfyXA", "user_id": "0bFsLpwGbBLgDyUFN5fadQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "So I got a coupon in the mail for a free small pizza.

I ordered rigatoni bolognese and it was fantastic. I'm from New Jersey so my expectations of pizza are VERY high. Unfortunately the water in Pennsylvania tastes different then that in NJ (it's real, I promise... it's a known fact) so that makes the pizza taste sweeter and I don't like sweet pizza. But my son ate all of it and that's definitely something because he's a VERY picky eater! I've also had chicken Caesar salad and it's the best!Definitely delicious food here. I've only had take out but I look forward to sitting down and eating at the restaurant one of these nights."}, {"review_id": "qF8l6D3bFGwFpE58X1OWkA", "user_id": "SAfNyiLVgPZzp_aGpXnfwg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2017", "text": "After a meal here there's one thing that everybody is guaranteed to remember and that is the massive portions that they dish out. This is a great place to come for a family that's hungry and doesn't want to spend a ton of money. You have Olive Garden like prices with slightly better flavor. In short, there's a ton of value here. As a matter of fact you can expect to pay about one third less than if you were to go to a local, quality Italian restaurant. The only difference is while the portions are enormous the quality straddles the average line. They did tell us that everything is made from scratch and in in-house. house. However, I think it's the quality of ingredients and food that they're purchasing that hurts things a little bit. On the other hand, there's no reason to be discouraged this is good food it's just not amazing.Let's  start with the side salads. You'll be impressed with the fresh greens rather than iceberg lettuce like you would get in many competitive restaurants. We also ordered the largest appetizer the comes with meats, cheeses and vegetables. This is enough for an entire family meal. What an amazing value! Most of the cheeses and meats tasted fine and this is something that if you have eight or nine people it's a great appetizer to buy because it feeds everybody.When the calzone came we were blown away. We ordered the small calzone and it was large enough to feed three or four people. They absolutely loaded with ricotta cheese and do a wonderful job at providing a crispy perimeter with the cheeses and meats well-cooked on the inside. The Sicilian pizza is similar in the respect that it's enormous. Because the slices are so thick and absolutely loaded with dough good luck eating more than two pieces if you're enjoying other items like a salad or appetizer as well. The one complaint we had with the pizza was there was almost no sauce and very little cheese. It was 85% dough. We also ordered the chicken parmesan, which could have been split by two adults. The chicken was well pounded it out and extremely thin. However, there was more breading than there was chicken. On a positive note, you didn't even need a fork to cut it and the pasta sauce that came with it was sweet and tasted great. Next time we're in Allentown we would return here especially if there were a bunch of us because there's so much value coupled with wonderful service and a friendly staff. As long as you're not looking for top-notch authentic Italian you're going to find a warm seat here for you and have almost a full meal filled with leftovers."}, {"review_id": "StjMhhOKkw9uu8IteimroQ", "user_id": "C7Nhs4uOu8Sys3xDrC3EeA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "Polite, friendly and personable staff.

From the outside it doesn't seem like much, but once you walk in it is a completely new atmosphere. The entire restaurant smells of pizza and pasta. The waiter we had was extremely friendly and always catered to anything we needed. When I ordered the Veal Parmesan I expected a medium sized plate of pasta and veal with the side salad and maybe 1 or 2 pieces of bread. The salad was an average size but the Veal Parmesan came out in a huge plate and I literally got a plate full of bread (6-7 slices).

My husband loves it here, me on the hand, can do with or without. I haven't really found a dish I love here, and I have tried several. The pizza is amazing though. This place gets very, very busy so go prepared to wait or go during off times. The staff all appear very friendly, some servers are better than others, but overall pretty decent staff. The only thing that really bothers me here is how dirty the floor is, underneath the tables, every single time we go. I don't know why, but it really grosses me out to the point where I don't want to put my shoes down on the floor. Take the time to sweep under the tables between customers, it makes a huge difference in the appearance of the restaurant. If this is what the dining area looks like, how does the kitchen look?
