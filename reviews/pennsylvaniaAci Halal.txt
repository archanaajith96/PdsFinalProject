The Restaurant is cozy, seems like family run where mom is cooking, and the daughter is serving, service was good and the food even better. After our meals my wife and I walked the neighborhood, seemed like a part of town I would not visit after dark.  Would surely go back again to try some of the other dishes."}, {"review_id": "U3uzb2uyUzkKLYqCLRy3LA", "user_id": "7niQ50opD9MjfDU8A4S_7g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/15/2016", "text": "We stopped by the restaurant yesterday and were very pleased with out \"lunch specials.\" The lentil soup and Turkish tea were hot and tasty and the kebab and falafel platters were generously decked out with rice and salad, although in retrospect we probably should have ordered a side of hummus or babaganosh since there was no tahini or any other sauce served with the food and falafel can be a bit dry. A warm basket of bread came with the meal and we'll definitely try to stop back for a bite next time we're in town; however, the store is on the small side. Although they have a selection of dry goods the bread products we saw were all plastic wrapped and we didn't find any boreks or other fresh savories which we'd hoped to take home. Nonetheless restaurant service was fast and helpful and the location and its facility are accessible with plenty of free parking out front."}, {"review_id": "cpuIpmnV8ynVy2bNRSPesA", "user_id": "KwMmtJBX_GXc7ijtQysWaw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/5/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "It's family owned and everyone who works there is very friendly and accommodating. As soon as you walk in, there's a little grocery store and deli. As you walk toward the back, it's a restaurant! There's a lot of great appetizers to pick from, but my favorite is the hummus and salad plate. For the entree, I order the beef plate. The food is high quality at a very affordable price. It's by far, then best hummus I've ever had. Haven't found a hummus as good -- no joke!"}, {"review_id": "muQrT7f4-VXufyXi7flgHA", "user_id": "b738duNqsoNEXJuENuijVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/17/2017", "text": "Lamb lunch special is well worth it.

Family owned, service can be overwhelmed if too many come in at once. Such is life. The restaurant is Halal, very clean and strict in sanitation, very respectful to all diners. They gladly allow BYOB which is a plus for meat eaters in PA with its sorry liquor laws. Vegetables and sides, even the ubiquitous rice (standard on platters) and french fries are enjoyable. Value here is tremendous, the one restaurant I miss after moving from this area."}, {"review_id": "utoq4ip-x5eksNdKDOhoTw", "user_id": "KrLENbV8mJYbGbJw1hqtxw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/20/2017", "text": "The food is solid.

The reviews were amazing so went there. It's a small restaurant which is attached to a grocery store and a butcher shop. You get the feeling of authenticity as soon as step in. Obviously there is nothing even close to fancy about this place but the food is pretty good. They have so many meat options. We tried Beyti kabob and some other beef dish. They were both good. Serving sizes are pretty good. The only thing which I thought was lacking a little bit was , both dishes kinda left me desiring for a kick as I found both of them a little bland. But it was still pretty good. Service was excellent and prices are fair. At the end try their tea with an order of Baklawa , one order of Baklawa is good for two. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone and would come back if in the area and ask for making it a little bit spicy next time :)"}, {"review_id": "Nn1dyhMncMvw2TypDmZ7_A", "user_id": "X2QU1SNnpIOwGH0umVyuKg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "10/2/2013", "text": "I guess I had higher expectations after seeing the high rating. Got there around 12 and there was only one table. After 10-15 minutes, the place was bustling! I guess we came in right before the crowd. The waiter was a bit slow given that we were the only table - granted there was a large party coming in but we were ready to order and he was still tending to the large party (maybe they are regulars?) and making two hungry people wait! We ordered a warm appetizer of falafel (4 very large balls), and a chicken gyro (comes with lettuce, tomato and onion) and a beef/lamb gyro.  The pita bread that came before our gyro came out was so good! it was warm, and fluffy. I stuffed the falafel into the bread with some of the shredded lettuce that came with falafel to make my own sandwich. YUMMY with hot sauce (sriracha was the only thing they carried). I think I still prefer Marmoun's in NY/NJ though. The chicken gyro was okay. it was a large portion, but chicken was a bit dry. Maybe we just didn't order the right thing but it was very 'meh' for me."}, {"review_id": "2DI8LnqjgnOBFQ1WeexHhA", "user_id": "9e5VV9-P-Xk-A9vH69dxKA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/11/2017", "text": "Whenever I come into Allentown I like to go to Aci Halal.
