I didn't feel I could write a review at first, as I didn't try a few different things on their menus till now. I really like the meat ravioli. I like to get the full to have left overs, and it doesn't cost much more. I usually opt out of getting the extra cheese, because I am not a big cheese person to begin with. Enough cheese comes on the pasta even before the extra cheese option.  Their pizza is delicious. I've had two different kinds, I've had the meat combo and supreme without mushrooms. Sorry I'm not a mushroom person. It's the texture. haTheir pizza is a thin crust type, and I personally enjoy that. Their sauce is so good, I don't know how they make it, but it is fabulous. Mama's Pizza is definitely something you must try! The location is a bit small, there is a small parking lot as well. During rush hours it can be a bit of a wait, but that just shows how many people really do enjoy this place. It is family friendly, and a family owned establishment which makes it even more better! Thank you to the people at Mama's for the amazing service, and food."}, {"review_id": "U4SXC8-SfwOYD5r4tqQ4Jw", "user_id": "ZKr4YuXdzq41sVk-_29k-w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "I came here with two friends because we were looking for an affordable dinner (all college students here, ha!). A glance at Mama's Pizza's menu shows you just how affordable it is. A full entree is under $10. In total, the three of us with one drinking wine was $33. So, affordable Mama's is, which was the key thing we were after. Beyond the great price, this place is definitely a homey sort of family-owned style Italian restaurant. They pack a lot of people into a small space. The decor is a bit odd and mis-matched, but it has that sort of classical Italian look overall with huge, multicolored chandeliers and a 3D mural. The service was amazing. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. It felt like being at someone's house. As for the food, it was good; but it wasn't fancy or complicated. It was Italian that a competent cook could make at home with a decent recipe. I had a pasta sampler. The sauce was a standard tomato sauce, it didn't have any meat or a lot of seasoning. The pasta was good, tasted like your typical boxed pastas. I had a meatball which was good, just a teensy bit tough. My friends had the pizza, they had no complaints, but they'd eat anything so I can't get a good read on the pizza. Overall, a decent option for a night out if you just want that dining out feeling and to avoid cooking, but for $10 I could make a lot of comparable pasta at home, the service is really what saved this place for me from being a three star rating."}, {"review_id": "sDnkzU4codgqexj7IrgVzA", "user_id": "LCsS8gusfGNWnnU4ZyLPCg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This is my neighborhood Italian joint, and I think it does my neighborhood proud. For a very reasonable price, you can get yourself a plate of pasta that is thoroughly drenched in sour, flavorful tomato sauce and weighed down with enough creamy cheese that it would hurt kind of a lot if you dropped that plate of food on your toes. People come here for the pizza quite a bit, which is fine, but I generally show up when I want some simple Eastside-style spaghetti-meatballs of the sort that you can imagine being on the tables of blue collar urban family homes in the 1950s. On this visit, I got the small sampler which included ravioli, mostaccioli, and spaghetti with a meatball. The mostaccioli was a little undercooked, but that isn't usually a problem. It was a generous and tasty meal. I've gotten the large before and it was way too much. So what I'm saying is that you get a lot of food here. I always leave very satisfied. The service is friendly and the prices are excellent. The dining room is pretty small, which enhances the atmosphere but it can feel very crowded. But takeout is a big part of their business, so consider them for that. Lovely neighborhood Italian joint!"}, {"review_id": "OK2LCsdA2xTrhWXaUxaIhg", "user_id": "M47d57irsgp8XixddfqUzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "One  of the best pizza joints In town.

It's a small room but they manage to get a lot of people in their. We ordered two pizzas and two garden salads. Both pizzas had great quality toppings. The rub on the pizza is that it is a cracker crust. It is thin which I like but the crust lacked moisture and flavor. This probably helped the toppings stand out. The sauce was good. My other knock was the salad - it had brown leaves in it. I pulled them out and while I completed the salad it just wasn't fresh. It may be tough to get fresh lettuce in MN, not sure. What was great was the little vanilla ice cream cone at the end of dinner. It was soft, creamy goodness on a sugar cone. Good stuff!  I would go back if someone had to go - but not a top choice for this traveller."}, {"review_id": "cYUPfYRIcHTjQDtmXL7KrQ", "user_id": "vxNSasg276epU4b1nIXuWQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Awesome local pizza/pasta joint.
