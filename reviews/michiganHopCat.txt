Ordered the fish sandwich plus mac & cheese. As I'm waiting for my food, Zappa's Yellow Snow comes on. I have to ask the bartender the source. She said it was part of the owner's playlist. Wow! Never hear that anymore. The sandwich and fries were amazing, but the mac & cheese - best I can remember. I had a couple of local tap beers that were very nice as well. Really great experience at this point. Then I hear a conversation next to me about trying to catch Clapton in London for what may be among his last performances. Turns out this is the owner. We talk for a good while, but what struck me most was his love and loyalty to his team at HopCat and other places he. As a former Marine Officer, this told me that he takes care of them first and the customers best. I lay over here as a pilot regularly and glad I found this great place."}, {"review_id": "8c3-AlNDzmpi2oDH1FXdIQ", "user_id": "eljzNoc38qmpzCmX9NnMzA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Pushing a 3star, id give 2 1/2 if possible.The Royal Oak location was a much better experience. Came on a Thursday around 11:45 before the lunch rush hit. Hostess was less than enthusiastic about her job and seating us seemed to take a lot of energy. Took longer to be greeted by our waitress than it did for our lunch to come out of the kitchen.  Menus were covered in grime and clearly dont get wiped down as they should. Food was good, crack fries are a must of course."}, {"review_id": "ImrNHqr-JzLm_vjfH-GLgA", "user_id": "HfhWO7QT68YbDTJGJ8Xsxg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "We got there at 5:30 pm last Saturday and were not seated until 7:15.  We were told an hour wait.  It was frustrating as we were finally down to #2 on the list and yet there were at least five tables open and available.  I talked to the manager, unfortunately he was no help and seemed overwhelmed and checked out.  My buddies girlfriend finally got the hostess to let us sit as one of the tables...  it was so ridiculous, I have never seen anything like it. The food was great however, I had the grilled chicken salad, and my friends all loved their burgers and crack fries. What a great selection from Michigan breweries!  I will not be back due to the poor customer service by the manager.  Too many choices in the area to be treated like that."}, {"review_id": "-QfpgrissB90b5WuQEd1IQ", "user_id": "uih53bykBGPNn3Lv09ofkA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "I feel like without a good guide you might miss some of these awesome spots.  Fortunately for me, I had one. And we made it to HopCat on a night we didn't expect to have time for anything.We walked in and the place was full but there was room at the bar.  Very nice comfy bar seats.  Bonus!  The bartenders were super friendly and equally not annoying.  Loved that.We got a flight from the varied selection of beers across several styles.  And of course, I had to try the crack fries and the wings.  Obviously.  Wings and fries and beer.  Dinner of champions.The fries were really good, the cheese sauce they were served with didn't do that much for me, but the fries were great.  No question.  Crispy without being too hard and they were the right temperature to eat right away without feeling like they got too cold too soon.The wings were good.  I asked for them naked with the sauce on the side.  We tried the fire and the bbq, both were good, though the fire was not really spicy in my opinion.  The wings were well cooked, nicely crisp without being burnt.  The blue cheese was great.Friendly service from bartendreds who know when to serve and when to leave you to chat.  Loved that.Very cool inside, it was packed but I didn't feel like I had to yell the whole time either.  Very cool spot and I'd come back anytime."}, {"review_id": "p1pmCHCKFswZmUN_afnRuA", "user_id": "RGvR2G6bwe2RDc4WUugxBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Like coming here for lunch they have a great french dip and good selection of beer.

We came in from out of state for a wedding and asked a lot of random questions. I wish I asked for their names. They gave us the low down on local places to go and introduced us to the beer passport. Also let us try beers since there were so many! This place has so many beers we overlooked the beers they brew in house. There were actually two awesome guys that were interested in why we were in town. When they found out one of our friends was getting married, he gave them a shot on the house. So nice!"}, {"review_id": "vsFPF2D5qrEI_kpmKDozhQ", "user_id": "aC6SOrWvMhOmS-o1SeERbw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/11/2017", "text": "This place is AMAZING!! If you're looking for great service, delicious food, and a great craft beer list... this is the place to go!! We had a 30 minute wait on a Friday night. We were not upset with that at all. And then it turned out we really only waited 15 minutes.Our waitress was really knowledgeable and very attentive. I just loved her!!The food was phenomenal!! I had the nachos. They were new on the menu & honestly not the best nachos I've ever had but still super good. My boyfriend had the grilled cheese sandwich. SO good!! And you *have* to get the crack fries!! Best fries I've ever had. Hands down!! Can't wait to go back!!!"}, {"review_id": "Gd1c0ynkY0rAuBszU4Vc6w", "user_id": "8TIxQJ2RpZlp1mafY8CKug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/23/2017", "text": "I had such a great experience here today even during the busy-ness of ArtPrize. Since it was just me today I sat at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and quick with everything I needed. I was very impressed that he was always there at the right times. They have quite a wide selection of drafts and bottled beers.Their crack fries are an absolute must have and is something everyone who is familiar with HopCat knows them for. You can order them as a side and they also come as the side with burgers, sandwiches, etc. Today I order the pulled barbecue pork sandwich for lunch. It comes with apple cider barbecue sauce, haystack onions, and slaw. It was delicious and is a sandwich I would certainly order again. I hadn't been here in a few years but the crack fries were just as amazing as I had remembered them. They have great food overall. Whatever you order for your lunch/dinner, just make sure you have some crack fries to go with it. I promise you won't be disappointed!"}, {"review_id": "oPz6_1KQ10JMmzZRRfExJA", "user_id": "oAkiKNAfRSbVKJ--oCB_iw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/20/2017", "text": "This place is one of my favorites.

Food wise...CRACK FRIES! We got the Vladimir Poutine which had cheese curds, sausage gravy and bacon and carmelized onions. I got the Supper Club Wrap and it was delicious. I didn't want a hot sandwich so a wrap filled with turkey, bacon, avocado, cheese and garlic aioli hit the spot."}, {"review_id": "EzoyYp7_7Wi9Xhe1NI3isA", "user_id": "Nf7NhEovVBh8uYMIuCg3FA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Grand Rapids local downtown brewery.

They absolutely live up to their name, an absolute must. Hopcat is easily in my top 5 favorite restaurants. The vibe is super hipster/casual/fun. Everyone was definitely in a good mood. They have indoor and outdoor seating. Living in Michigan I say take as much advantage of the nice weather as you can and have a seat on their awesome patio. They have picnic tables, 2 top tables, and patio furniture to choose from. Good food, good beer, good service. Everything this trip was phenomenal. I've been to the Detroit location and it's consistent through and through. The beer list is huge and you'll always be able to find something you like. They have a full bar as well. The staff has a great knowledge of all the beverages. Today, we started with the loaded pretzel nugz and they did not disappoint. They disappeared within seconds. Topped with cheese sauce, bacon, red onion, and jalapeños-who wouldn't love that? For my meal I ordered the angry bird sandwich-fried chicken breast tossed in hot sauce and topped with blue cheese dressing, served with crack fries. Every bite was perfect.

Only so many full size beers I can drink.  If you drive here, I note that the good citizens of Grand Rapids have chosen to hire a massive police department that seems to almost outnumber we non-police; so be careful.  If you are one of those IPA people, you are going to really like the beer selection. The food was excellent.  I understand why this restaurant was voted best brew pub - the crack fries were delicious.  The wife had the Killer Mac & Cheese on the server's recommendation and enjoyed it.  I had the super club, which was also very good.  There was some drama between two of the servers and one service problem, which was that the appetizer came out at the same time as the wife's entree.  My entree initially did not come out at all and the server had to go deal with that issue.  This did not ruin an overall good experience for us."}, {"review_id": "SJswXlfXQ2n5-uOK7Paokg", "user_id": "3XT_xWbKl-6V9EVPaa1JJg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/20/2017", "text": "A great spot in downtown GR for BEER (lots of great beer from all over!) and awesome food (crack fries.)This place does get busy, fair warning.Patio available (DOG FRIENDLY), private dining, bar seating, ect.Love HopCat and it is within walking distance of the arena, other great bars, etc."}, {"review_id": "Bdc8zLtEtdwCXAtD1ttBig", "user_id": "95Lg9RcXx09_0f_ZZ4jOhA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Had a great experience at HopCat!

So I showed up at Hopcat last night with my son and daughter in law at 5:15 and we had an hour wait. We took off for a cup of coffee to waste time and when they texted us we hurried back. Be forewarned that if you don't stick around there is a five minute grace period to claim your table... we were a minute late and had to wait a bit longer for a table. Now for the food... awesome in every way! I had the Cowboy and it was one of the best burgers I've had. A little pink in the middle, a vinegar BBQ sauce, a bit of zing with some jalepeños and bacon. The crack fries were phenomenal! A hint of sweetness but with the savory seasoning it's simply killer. The beer selection is superb with not only a wide choice of bottles but some great beers on tap, local and national. If you like great food paired with a great selection of beer, this is a place you won't want to skip. By the way, I'm ready to start my own recovery group for the fries as I've noticed a bit of the craving and shakes..."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/hopcat-grand-rapids?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
