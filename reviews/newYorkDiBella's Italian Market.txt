The restaurant always seems busy at lunch, but the line always goes fast with so many employees taking and making orders. Plus there are plenty of seats for everyone.  Some of my favorites are, DiBella's Cheesesteak on a multi grain bread...made with thin grilled steak with your choice of melted cheese. ( I go with provolone) I also add grilled peppers and extra onions! Their tuna sub is really good, always fresh and loaded with toppings.The meatball sub is another amazing one, with hot meatballs, marinara sauce and extra mozzarella cheese! Perfect on a cold Rochester day.  I sometimes grab a cold drink and chips by the register... but their cookies are a must! Chocolate chip... so good!"}, {"review_id": "caINXwPidUryN-9F7Pz1bQ", "user_id": "8svgK8F0Cn9z85rqfZgC3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/5/2017", "text": "Known as the premier sub place in Rochester for decades, Dibella's has been consistently great.

They have fresh baked bread that you could eat by itself and be happy. My favorite is the chicken salad which is only offered at this location.

The bread is always fresh and the ingredients they put on their subs are top quality. From the cold cuts to the fresh veggies and delicious quality sauces such as their classic infused oil with Italian seasonings. The only sandwich options I tried were the God Father and both chicken and steak philly cheese steak. The God Father has Genoa salami, capicola, spicy ham which is a nice blend of spicy and salt meat. When you want a simple cold cut sandwich this is the sandwich you should get. The philly sandwiches are always a satisfying sandwich. The hot melty cheese with onions and peppers are a go to on the sandwich. The steak and chicken are seasoned well and chopped very fine. I alway add the Italian oil to my sandwich because the flavors infuse with the soft bread that soaks up all the juices. The prices are reasonable but it's a high quality sandwich that is always satisfying."}, {"review_id": "GH3CD1Sw39NfximGJJIX0g", "user_id": "-J7vvduIlrPpT-Vl1yX3xQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "The best place for subs - no question.

And while my cardiologist is happy, which makes me happy, the one thing I truly miss is a good sub. (Subs. We call them subs in western New York. Not a wedge, hoagie, hero, or grinder!) So while I am not longer an active sub aficionado, I can fully testify to the deliciousness of a DiBella's sub. There's nothing like it! Firstly, they make them the way you like them - customized to your taste buds. I happened to be a lover of mayonnaise. It's nearly a food group unto itself in my book. DiBella's understands that and will slather on until its met your approval. I recognize there are many that don't agree. We'll still remain friends, although I think you are definitely missing out!The meat selection and quality at DiBella's is impressive. They do not serve reconstituted, discount quality ham, turkey, or roast beef. It's good stuff. Stuff you would be able to recognize. The cheese is tasty, with a good texture. And they give you a hefty amount. You could easily make two sandwiches out of it. I have eaten at Jimmy John's twice and nearly did a double take at the skimpy amount of meat they provided. Really?!But, the piece de resistance in this reviewer's opinion is the roll. DiBella's bakes their own rolls -- at least twice a day. Talk about fresh! Local legend has it that DiBella's sold their roll recipe to the national grocery chain Wegmans. That wouldn't surprise me. I hope they got a million bucks for it, because their rolls are magnificent! DiBella's also sells salads. I have eaten a number of them and have been satisfied. Regardless of what you choose to eat at DiBella's, I'm sure you leave happy!"}, {"review_id": "hV2rVowtnwgmqnzQPPcIEw", "user_id": "eRxSjjJ-l3q5oXZc9h9q5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2017", "text": "Dibellas Italian Market offers more items than a normal Dibellas.

Today was especially unpleasant. I am truly not one to usually complain so it must be bad for me to bring up an issue. They gave me the wrong meat last time and I didn't notice until I was already home 20 minutes away. I let them know today as it was two days prior and I wanted to give them a chance to rectify the mix up. The manager was not helpful whatsoever. Not apologetic, arrogant, rude, and certainly didn't not try to work with me, rather he confronted me to say I was wrong. They don't carry pastrami. Okay, but I've had their roast beef before and it has been satisfactory in the past and even today the meat was okay. Not the best quality but middle of the line quality. This other meat was smooth, without texture and did not fall apart as traditional roast beef should. Aka cheap deli meat. And tasteless. Which lead me to believe it must be a very poor quality pastrami. Long story, I paid full price for my current sub and will be going to Amiels on W. Henrietta Road around the corner from now on as I should have all along. My only complaint with Amiels is their swiss cheese is an American blend but they are much more personable, make great subs, and customer service has always been on point there. My Dibella's sub today was so soggy 30 minutes later that it was dripping with every bite and soaked through the wrapping and bag before I even opened it. Unimpressive. Long rant but I will not be returning to this location."}, {"review_id": "WyIboO9FZ5zPf0r9VG4C6A", "user_id": "E7_8ZVNMHM2mFY9F5YikGQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/3/2017", "text": "My son and I stopped by DiBella's Market for a quick dinner that we could take back to our hotel.   My son ordered the cheesesteak and I got Aunt Gina's salad.   The ordering process seemed to go very easily but it took a good 15 minutes for my son's cheesesteak to be done.  Seemed like a long time.  He said it was really good so he didn't mind the wait.  My salad was ok.  Nothing great but acceptable.   Would I go back again?   Not sure.  There are so many options in the area that it seems I could find a better salad elsewhere.   Plus they had literally NO drinks in their display.  We aren't soda drinkers so it limited us to water or lemonade."}, {"review_id": "1gqiKg5Vt0WLwN6rvL0jQA", "user_id": "MZ4nz4tPo56ym8j55kxnZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/15/2014", "text": "They just don't have sandwich shops like this is Northern Virginia.
