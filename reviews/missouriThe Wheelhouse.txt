The only drawback is the wait time is usually pretty long. They operate out of a food truck and I think they can only handle so much at a time. Despite that it is worth the wait. The specials on the board always seem to be the way to go."}, {"review_id": "hWzgVAFbRwNnp5rm4D8E7A", "user_id": "O9gf6CeGnp9D8ULiWW2P8Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Friendly staff.

Look no further than my standard order at The Wheelhouse, which combines their veggie mojo and chicken burritos into one human-head-sized bundle of unspeakable deliciousness. And yes, it really is that massive - so big, in fact, that even with my insatiable appetite, I often fail to finish it in a single sitting.It's also big on flavor thanks to liberal use of Wheelhouse's mojo sauce and my request that they make it extra-spicy (4 on an available scale of 5). Honestly, it's probably the best burrito in the city, and even with all the extras (say yes to the guacamole; you won't regret it), it's comparable in cost to what one might expect at a Chipotle or Qdoba.Wheelhouse's menu has a number of other gourmet takes on ethnic classics that other diners might find appealing, but when I've found something this good I rarely deviate from it. So, if you see me toting a burrito-shaped to-go box somewhere on St. Louis St., you can safely assume you know exactly what's inside - and soon to be inside of me."}, {"review_id": "Fa3m8nGPApfUNcxz71V3tQ", "user_id": "-50lprJ4kZ-XCM1hPU2vqg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "This food truck is spot on.

This place is AWESOME! The portions are huge (I got two single servings and it was... a lot of food). Dishes are between $6.50-9 for a single serving (I did veg for both) and are packed with flavor. I can not recommend the kimchi fried rice enough! Amazing customer service.

They have a bit of outside seating underneath a small canopy in case you'd like to relax when the weather is nice, but I took my order to-go.I had the sweet steak tacos, with a \"3\" spice level, and a side of guacamole (order comes with chips and two small corn tortillas for a total of ~$10). Pretty solid portion size, and the flavor was great. I liked the Mexican cheese and good quality meat. I would definitely get these again, but they have quite a few unique fusion combinations that I'd like to try on another visit.The Wheelhouse website and online ordering can be a bit tricky to manage, so you may encounter some issues. However, the food was made quickly, I received a text confirmation, and it was ready for pickup in about 30 minutes. The staff at the counter were very friendly, and they recommended calling in if you have any type of discount or promo code to redeem."}, {"review_id": "mjvUEntHZJ2ofa6_kjMTUw", "user_id": "oSSPJ6UAvN7J5AqvNwR8NA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Everything we ordered was amazing.  The peanut sauce on the chicken burrito was awesome.  My kids wouldn't even speak to me because they didn't want to stop eating their quesadillas.  Tacos were fantastic as well.
