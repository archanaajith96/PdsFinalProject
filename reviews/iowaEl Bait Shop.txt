I call it the \"Happiest Place on Earth.\" Friendly and helpful staff that can make suggestions based on what you like to drink at home. You can try before you buy, which is really nice. You can also order food from their menu, or from High Life Lounge next door (nachos as big as a toddler). Big outdoor area and is a popular stop for bicyclists."}, {"review_id": "0UOQpj8OEs7fiKUe0XHkZA", "user_id": "88AY14XGwGbLAjxsTs1E1Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "If you're a beer lover, this is the place to go they have I don't know how many beers on tap but it seems like it's always changing so try everything. There is the basic Budlight in bottles but I'll secretly judge you if I see you in there... The atmosphere feels like you're drinking in someone's garage which feels even more so when it's summer time and they open the garage doors. There's a lot of random signs and hanging tools and junk everywhere so there's always a lot of things to look at. They share menu with High Life Lounge which are connected to each other so feel free to do that if you want. The boasted chicken are great choices and of course starting with bacon wrapped tots is a must. It can get busy some time so just know you may have to go to the bar if you can't get a waiter to come your way."}, {"review_id": "iK4VhY81zibO7S2St6f_Bw", "user_id": "xIxrNJLIBpjxBb9N8lOGTg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "El Bait Shop is one of those locally renowned places in downtown DSM, where all kinds of beer lovers can come together in one harmonious, eclectic scene. They have 222 beers on tap, but also offer a wide selection of beverages in cans and bottles, along with some other beverage choices. Between those who come only to dine, the craft beer elitists trying something new, and the already wasted groups looking to party, the atmosphere of this place is very casual and enjoyable. My in-laws are from out of state, and El Bait Shop is one of their favorite places to frequent when they come to visit. They're craft beer lovers, and there is always something new and local for them to try. During our last visit, we grabbed a booth towards the back and ordered wings for the table. We each ordered our own personal beer and cider flights, which came out to roughly $10 each. Their menu is extensive and well-priced, and there are always a ton of options to find something new to love. Due to some health-related issues, I can't even drink beer, but had a blast anyway. Located just south of Court Avenue, they offer a great location for a new favorite lunch spot, and to even start or finish out your night of entertainment in DSM's historic court district. If you aren't from around here, or just haven't given in to the hype of this place, I would highly recommend it!"}, {"review_id": "r5Tj9BMB-XHVHaYa9Ht2Mg", "user_id": "pRV5tZWiPIJF_kZb0ppOOw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I truly ask is there a better craft beer venue in Des Moines, Iowa?

The beer selection is amazing!! There was so many beers on tap - they definitely have something you will enjoy. You can also get growlers filled which was awesome. I was able to take a peanut butter porter that I loved back to Florida with me. I tried the cheese curds while I was there one night and loved them!The service was also fantastic. Our server was able to suggest a mead to my friend in order to cure her hangover. He also brought us samples of beer with tomato juice to help cure her. It definitely worked! There is another bar attached next door that does domestic beers and I believe it was called the High Life Lounge. I loved the concept of splitting the two different feels of the bars.

The entire place just screams \"I probably have your favorite beer on tap\". Its a great place to explore new beer too. Just about every time ive been here they have something on tap that ive been meaning to try, but wasnt committed to a $20 bottle of it. Heck, im pretty sure they get things exclusively. A foreign couple came in on my last visit and asked for a sample of Coors Light....Ok a little odd, but the bartender didnt even flinch and obliged. Kudos. I wouldnt however, go here if you dont like beer. Their cocktail selection, although apparent, is a little lack luster. As for food? Who cares, Ive got a beer in my hand. Its great bar food but I cant say much after that. Not necessarily somewhere I would go for exquisite tastes, but it compliments my beer nicely and thats all I can ask for! Id suggest the Velvet Elvis dip. Its quite tastey!Staff attentiveness is a little back and forth, but its a super busy place. I can attest that everyone that works there is top notch when given the right croud, and great for conversation, especially the bartenders!Long story short, if you are a beer snob like myself, GO TO THIS BAR."}, {"review_id": "f8xz0IRHzM_IX3wLlZnQiA", "user_id": "jwuXoVgjmMFHcuKFT0ACRg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2017", "text": "In town for work and stopped here after a friend looked it up.The place is super chill, the wait staff is friendly and there are tons of options.
