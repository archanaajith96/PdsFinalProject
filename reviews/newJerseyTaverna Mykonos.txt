I have never been to Greece, but if the food is this good I want to go even more now! We started with the humus, melitzanosalata (fire roasted eggplant) and tzatziki dips, served with fresh pita. All were delicious, the eggplant was my favorite. The highlight of the appetizer course was the calamari - out of this world! Hands down the best calamari I have ever had. I will now have to get every time I come here, would be a sin not too! For a main I chose the double cut blackened pork chop special with vegetables and potatoes. Huge portion and cooked to perfection- the cut was certainly double! My husband opted for the sea bass special, which also looked spectacular, but was definitely a smaller portion. My father opted for the lamb chops cooked medium rare - they looked fantastic as well. My daughter had two baskets of the complimentary bread (I must admit it was fresh and warm and delicious, can't hate on that!) and the kids pasta with butter. We all over indulged in dessert (it was my birthday celebration after all) and I had the Ekme with mint tea. I immediately went home and ordered the same mint tea off of amazon, unfortunately that was not an option with the ekme (vanilla custard, filo dough, homemade whipped cream and toasted almonds.) The service was as good as the food. The place was packed but we still received everything as requested in a timely and gracious manner. This is my new favorite Greek place and will return here whenever the option presents itself - five stars all the way! Valet parking was quick and hassle free - suggest this as well."}, {"review_id": "CY8JDOVQrGGUiXAwxizsmQ", "user_id": "hrpQ-gPK8dKGzFGoiEQw8A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Ordered online for a takeout dinner.

When we sat down, they served us bread with olive oil.  While the olive oil was good, the bread was a little hard. For appetizers we ordered saganaki and spanakopita.  The saganaki arrived first.  It was almost like a breaded mozzarella cheese square, but a bit better.  It came with two small squares, which I thought was low portioned for $11.95.  Also, I've had saganaki in actual Mykonos, Greece that was almost like a melted cheese cooked in a red tomato style sauce.  I suppose the one served at this restaurant is a different style. Next, the spanakopita arrived.  This was a little more substantial portion wise than the former for the same price of $11.95.  This dish was delicious - flaky dough, perfect spinach filling and just as good as spanakopita I've had in Greece.For dinner we were in a salad mood (very rare for us for a dinner out!).  We ordered a Greek salad with salmon and a chopped salad with grilled chicken. Both salads were fresh and tossed in an olive oil and vinegar based dressing.  The salmon was cooked perfect - it was simple but juicy.  The grilled chicken was good too. However, each salad set us back roughly $27.00 each which is absurd for the fact that neither was overly huge and salad itself is inexpensive.  To me, the markup was outrageous.  Our overall dinner cost $86.00, closer to $100.00 after tip.  And all we had was 2 salads, 2 appetizers, and one glass of wine.  I think this restaurant would be better if they could just provide greater value.  I wish I could make this my go to Greek restaurant since it is closer to home, but Taste of Greece (TOG) in River Edge is a fraction of the price, with food that is more memorable.  While the ambiance at Taverna Mykonos is a little \"fancier\" I cannot justify the price.  The same salad with salmon added to it would be only $20 at TOG."}, {"review_id": "S9vmGc-JCvqS6CTo77nqzw", "user_id": "G8D8-GfYBjf8_2RuKDhtXg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/19/2017", "text": "Service was great Valet Parking is available Ambience really clean classy , classical music Food is superbStaff is very attentive  Tabitha our waitress was friendly kind sweet Had a great time came to celebrate my dads birthday**only thing they did not honor 15 percent of for first time yelp diner Otherwise totally recommend"}, {"review_id": "sIZe6rCMdub8rcdxNby6Og", "user_id": "rJlIdTMUUWP5uW2MBzzmwQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/25/2017", "text": "Excellent food, being there already several times and never being desapointed.. will keep coming.. everything I try it's excellent..

Being Greek American and raised on the food I can be fairly demanding. In this case my expectations were exceeed as everything from the service, to the food, atmosphere and friendly owner made this a memorable experience. The food didn't come out too fast but this is how it goes when everything is cooked on the spot and not warmed up. You can't fake the freshness of deep fried vegetables. Portion sizes were generous but not ridiculous, though there was still some food left to take home. Of particular note were the pilaf (rice with tiny bits of spinach), the stifado (beef stew with pearl onions, mashed potatoes, spiced with cloves), and the grilled octopus which was just like you would get in the mother land. The staff was attentive and prompt and the owners were friendly and made us and our guests feel like family. I highly recommend Mykonos for some great greek food."}, {"review_id": "yloPt-DSP3hctl_w2HdByg", "user_id": "7vJtM5SD2Atdu-ec8nHOoA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "After having a meal in this amazing restaurant now I know that Greek cuisine is my new favourite food!

It was hot, soft on the inside with a nice crunchy crust. It was a white bread with a pumpernickel center circle. The olive oil was great as well, earthy, not overpowering, but still a nice olive finish. I ordered the moussaka and it was unbelievable, the zucchini cooked to perfection, potatoes were soft, and the ground beef was seasoned to perfection. The bechamel sauce was incredible too. My friend got the gyro,...how american lol. The meat tender not salty and the fries were fried to perfection, golden, but extremely light."}, {"review_id": "bXaGhzkjd82yImrklW3O0g", "user_id": "hN03Wim4nDQ-824277aEsQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2017", "text": "Great place to get some upscale Greek food, cocktails, and wine. The seafood is off the chart here as it should be, but expectations are surpassed. The tables are a bit close together so if you have loud people nearby, and you will since it's North Jersey, it can feel like you are too close. From cocktails to start through the main courses, everything is delicious. The octopus is nice and tender with a good amount of spice but not rubbery. The fish is perfectly grilled with good light seasoning and goes great with a side of potatoes.

So we had to try it. Unfortunately I was very sick and didn't get to enjoy my food as much as my boyfriend but we still both loved it very much. The one thing I did get to enjoy was the Saganaki, which we had as an appetizer. They served it with lemon to squeeze onto it and it was so delicious!! I had a stuffed shrimp special as my main course and while I wasn't really able to eat it that night, I had the leftovers the next day and it was still very delicious. I was also feeling well enough to enjoy the dessert menu so we shared a chocolate cake of some sort (I forget which one!!) and it was very tasty. It had caramel sauce on the plate that I was practically licking up!! The atmosphere was very quiet which was nice for a romantic evening. Our waiter was very attentive throughout our entire meal and was very pleasant. They offered to take our coats when we got there and also valeted our car. Service was on par for sure. I can't help but compare this place to Oceanos in my head because they are owned by the same people and I truly would prefer Oceanos to this HOWEVER I still 100% recommend coming here to try it because on its own this place is really special and worth a trip!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/taverna-mykonos-elmwood-park?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
