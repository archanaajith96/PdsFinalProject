They have a sit down restaurant as well as a separate section for carry out orders only. Placed the order on my phone and picked it up on-time no problem!There are plenty of combos and items to choose from on the menu. But, you gotta go with the beef burnt ends and pork spare ribs. Cole slaw was excellent and their original sauce is great! Need to come back and try more + the spicy sauce!"}, {"review_id": "4didy_15q_wKIsOPK9LyGA", "user_id": "JWQ6-5iczFDpGGkAZzMvoQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Had dinner here while traveling in Kansas City and had a great experience.

My friend and I tried a few different meats and here's my rating from favorite to meh. 1. Crown prime beef rib2. Lamb rib3. Beef burnt ends (pork wasn't that great)4. pork spare ribs (I wouldn't ever order this, not to my liking. It's probably good but just a personal preference)The lemonade was realllly sweet for me so I did ask for water to water it down."}, {"review_id": "ZgX-tneflt9VZcSpSi60KA", "user_id": "mhrMIkK4Ag8RaNiqHf0mFQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Service was wonderful. We were a party of 10 on a Sunday night. The wait staff accommodated us in 45 mins. The food came out quick and even with all the rush they had, they came out to us plenty of times to find out if we were doing fine. Most of us tried different selections of meat from the Combo. I went with lamb ribs and burnt ends. The burnt ends were cooked to perfection, very juicy, moist and tender. Extremely flavorful. I was surprised with how much fat was in the lamb ribs. Literally, a small layer of meat with 3/4 fat on the ribs. It was just too fatty for me. I could only eat 2 ribs. The sides was plentiful to choose from. I ordered creamy coleslaw and cheesy potato which was a signature side so I had to pay $2.50 more. Which was worth it. It was delicious. The creamy coleslaw was okay. We all had no room for desert even though the selection seems very tempting.  All in all, it was good value for the money. Huge portion, very flavorful food and extremely efficient service."}, {"review_id": "jbUg_d6rZJ6J0l0XCx2iRA", "user_id": "68VvTQkHkSRflsbyyYBptw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "The food was ridiculously delicious.  The service was fantastic.

However, I am SO incredibly happy I threw that out the window for a night because I loved every bit of my meal. We had the burnt tips (pork and beef) which melted in my mouth with a deep smoky flavor. Pair that with a ginormous onion ring and a cucumber jalapeño margarita - and that's a fun night! I got the half stack of baby back ribs with cole slaw and fries. They provide a fry seasoning at the table which I highly recommend trying! The cole slaw was really flavorful and probably the best I've had - ever.  The ribs were good and super messy to eat but that's expected.I suggest a reservation since this is such a popular joint downtown close to the convention centers.

The food in this place was unbelievable. We tried multiple combination plates to get a taste of every type of meat and were not disappointed. Everything was so moist that you could eat with a fork.
