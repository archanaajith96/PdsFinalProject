In fact the latte was as good if not better! The dark waffle with yogurt and fruit was fresh and an excellent afternoon snack for three! The down side was the construction outside which is out of the business's control. Take a chance on the parking situation for a great cup of coffee!!"}, {"review_id": "PefYXTEn58yD1HBvfp8ESg", "user_id": "rfaijkSs65MzDoatGL9uxA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Stopped here while in town for clinicals - needed to fuel up to survive my two hour drive! Super cute, small craft coffee shop with awesome specials. I can't remember the name of the drink I got, but it was some type of latte with whole milk, lavender syrup, and honey - actually I think it was their signature drink, the Honey + Moon latte. Completely delicious! I love when coffee shops branch out and use more herbal or floral syrups like that. Service was not quick, but it's not that type of place to begin with - that's my fault that I was in a hurry. Would have loved to have stayed longer and gotten some work done, as the place is very charming. They also have bagged tea and coffee for sale, as well as ice cream! Next time I'm in town, that's on my list for sure - with a waffle!"}, {"review_id": "dRzE1_OeWZ5gUGz-6ctmtw", "user_id": "Oczs8WWm45yVWdn6M32h6w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "This is a great option if you are looking for a local coffee shop. I have visited a few times. Inside there is a small, but cute space. It seems to be a great hang out space for college students since it is right by University of Evansville. Both times I have been here, the service has been slow and I waited long than expected to get my drinks. When I asked questions about the pastry and gelato they had, the employees seemed unsure about their answers. I have friends who love this place, but my experiences have not been the best."}, {"review_id": "utVwOAJyvP0HiAbzBA_cFw", "user_id": "7eG5YVTdNbMf6W34K7Zb4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/28/2017", "text": "This place is an underrated neighborhood gem. I stopped in here to do some work and I was impressed with the drink offerings, the food, and the calm atmosphere. I ordered an egg sandwich and was surprised (and a little amused) to see that the eggs were cooked in the bubble waffle pan! It gave them a fun texture but didn't impact their taste (as long as you're happy with the sort of fully-cooked, deli-style egg sandwich, which I am.) There's a decent amount of seating in a small area, so be prepared to get cozy if you show up at busy time. Will happily return. It's got a good vibe."}, {"review_id": "9X-BVicAYxGj84oBoroDLg", "user_id": "XItANpHKQO3MLgErEmSYsg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "This place is a gem!!

First, because of their location - across from the university - parking is limited to a few spots. I had to park down the street at the Chinese restaurant. Once in, I was disappointed to find they were not serving the requested coffee, but a house blend that I was told contained the Ethiopian. It was pretty good but I really wanted the Ethiopian. They did have bags of the Ethiopian for sale, but were not serving as an option.On a side note, once I got home and added some amaretto-flavored cream, it was really an amazing blend with that hint of cherry. I also tried a few pastries - chocolate and banana and banana nut. Both good, but I wished I would have requested them to be heated. I guess if I want to try the Ethiopian, I'm going to have to buy a bag and brew it myself. Quick: how many times did I say Ethiopian in this review?"}, {"review_id": "oaJ4CE4ImQnK4D5n9ph2LA", "user_id": "-FxsSuwDbIII7yo5BjHpiA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "This is a cute, unsuspecting neighborhood coffee shop that offers more than a good cup of coffee.  They have a selection of tea, pastries, and waffles--oh those waffles.  You can choose a sweet or savory waffle.  They are made in a bubble shaped waffle iron which not only gives them a different look, but also conveniently creates little bite size creases.  I had the red, white, and blue named aptly for the blueberries, strawberries, and whipped cream adorning my lightly crisp waffle.  In addition, I opted for the lavender and vanilla latte at the prompting of my barista, and it was the best lavender latte I've had.  The flavors were present but not overpowering and played well with the coffee.  If all of this isn't enough, they also have ice cream!"}, {"review_id": "PVY0X0NbQFFIwuRuweCnlw", "user_id": "7A9EMGgBZLyK0u_82mTvxg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Love honeymoon!

I tried the earl grey tea latte (5/5), honey brew (4.5/5), half moon and crescent moon sandwiches (both 5/5). The food was simple but delicious, and both beverages were excellent. The only reason why I did not give 5 stars is because when we arrived and stood at the counter to order, the girl that was working practically ignored us. I know she was busy but it was an awkward interaction and it was at least 10-15 minutes before she took our order. Aside from the initial wait, the interior/seating area is super cute and the food and drink here is also great!"}, {"review_id": "1dnj0ZHOvkMTr32wc5Quhg", "user_id": "BSxloSapoQfhtryn3y2F-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/10/2017", "text": "First time here and it did not disappoint.
