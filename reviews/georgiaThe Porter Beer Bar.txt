This low-key and grungy \"beer bar\" is way more than meets the eye. Step into this Little Five Points local treasure and you'll be delighted with not just the largest selection of beer that you can find but also some of the best food in the city. The menu changes regularly and is always delicious! We've been going here for years now so it's pretty hard to review all the amazing things we've had! The regular menu has delicious options like the addictive popcorn, the equally addictive Belgian fries, the goat cheese fritters, The pull apart pretzel with beer cheese dip, the humongous Porn dog, The delectable Burger, the list goes on, on, and on! The restaurant even shines in regularly changing seasonal menu with riffs on both popular and avante garde dishes that will make your mouth water.For instance, on this visit, we enjoyed Sriracha chili wings with mango, crispy and yummy chicken curry samosas with a yogurt cilantro dip, and a delicious Shrimp Po Boy on some of the best bread ever! Of course, to drink we had two glasses of Viking Blood. Absolutely love The Porter beer bar! Highly recommend!"}, {"review_id": "373f2QsLYeZlbh9JXY1Ifg", "user_id": "tz-1X34sCXnBpgqZOcjsXw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "I was super impressed with TPBB's beer selection and even more so by the expert help the staff was able to give me in making a selection to not only appease my tastes, but also match the meal I was having. As a dairy-free pescatarian, there weren't a ton of food options for me, but the waitress was helpful in making some adjustments to a salad so it fit my diet. The salad did come out with cheese and cream dressing all over it, but the waitress was quick to realize the error and get it switched out.

Parking is tough to come by, but luckily, this place is walking distance from my home. I've been to The Porter twice and the main reason for that is the Impossible Burger! It was on the temporary menu, but I beg you (I'm on my knees) please do not get rid of this vegan deliciousness! With that being said, the tomato soup wit the cauliflower toast is probably one of the best combinations that has ever entered my mouth. (Yeah I said it!) Who was the food genius that created that dish? Please point me in their direction so I can kiss their hand and tell them how much I love them. Who knew a pub like atmosphere could have so much more than just \"bar food\". The Porter literally gives you the best of both worlds; pub vibes with culinary amazing-ness! They have beer selections with every dish, and beer selections for probably every single day of the week. The only reason, and I mean, the ONLY reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the bathroom. I'm a huge bathroom person. If the bathroom isn't clean or up to par in a establishment I immediately get turned off. Every single time I have used this bathroom the floor has been incredibly wet, and just gross. Although, the food is so damn good that I don't mind holding my bladder until I leave. Ha!"}, {"review_id": "yVhCGmKmGKRcMpXWP2rirw", "user_id": "ofGw-NvHlZ1cgqIFMGmlNw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "This place was really great. The atmosphere was very chill with really nice aesthetics. We visited from Chicago and were happy to be quickly seated with a larger party. The list is out of control huge and has options for any palette. The wait staff was so knowledgeable and patient, too. The salt-vinegar popcorn was super good.

My coworker and I had an incredible experience with everything - the food, drinks and service. I had the French Onion Cheeseburger and it might have been the best unique cheeseburger I've ever had. That sauce was perfect, so delicious. I wanted to bathe in it. My coworker had the 12 hour Brisket Sandwich. I tried his and it was very good but I still preferred mine. I stuck with Belgian beers and loved everyone I tried. Patrick was awesome and was so much fun to talk to. I loved every beer that he recommended.

The bar is on a busy street in the Little 5 Points section of Atlanta. We took a Lyft from our downtown hotel. There is street parking which I guess is hit or miss. We wanted to sit at the bar, but it was full and everyone looked very comfortable. After a very short wait, we were seated in the back room. This place is much bigger than it looks. We tried several beers that we never heard of, but our favorite, by far, was the Ante Meridiem from Monday Night Brewing-perfect dessert beer. We shared the Pull Apart Pretzel which came with some yummy cheese dipping sauce. My hubby had the Fish 'n Chips-he loved it and said the fish was top notch. He would have preferred regular fries, but I liked them. They came with my Plane Jane Burger which was also top notch. We munched on some salt and vinegar Popcorn after dinner. The bowl is HUGE and I have to caution on the heavy vinegar favoring.  Our server Cassie was spectacular and we truly enjoyed our visit.

A cheese and charcuterie board with amazing head cheese, a duck confit patty melt, an Asian fusion rice bowl...this is gastropub fare at its finest!  I always feel guilty kicking back, enjoying food and drink and extending my stay here; I'm sure there are always people trying to get in.If you're in Atlanta, you need to make the Porter a stop.  It'll become a tradition."}, {"review_id": "5fcZf5uGh-Lwm-TN52PeKQ", "user_id": "ZfG1T_noQnbOdXnz4USs0Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "I can't believe it took me so long to visit this place!

On the note, of goat cheese, I will say this I will never say no to goat cheese but this was not the best fried goat cheese I have had.

They have everything -- all types, barrel aged, IPAs, sours, ciders. They once had my favorite sour beer, which is pretty hard to find because it's made in South Carolina and it's a special flavor (Westbrooke Key Lime Gose if you're curious, so good!!). FOOD: Get their salt and vinegar popcorn (assuming you like vinegar), but try not to inhale as you eat it. Really strong on the vinegar, hence my consistent coughing as I try to eat it, but delicious! I've also tried their Ban Mi Sandwich (it was a special) -- I wasn't all that impressed with the flavor. I also had their passion fruit creme brûlée which I LOVED -- very interesting flavor, tart and a little bit sweet. SERVICE: Very good! Never had an issue. Friendly and attentive. AMBIANCE: Pretty dark, large, old school bar but nice. Sounds a little odd but it has a medieval vibe almost to me? They also have decorations of aging beer and suitcases along the wall. A little odd but I like it! OVERALL: Great beer spot with some good food/snacks/dessert too! TIP: Good number of homeless people in the area.

Love that they have seasonal items.My advice- stick to beer when you go here (I should have known- it is a beer bar). Their selection is incredible and every tap is so fresh.

It was my first time going to the Porter Beer Bar and I was quite enthused, hearing AT go on and on about how amazing it is. The place did not disappoint.There is definitely a neighborhood bar feel, which is what you want visiting this L5P establishment. I mean, look at the average rating and the number of reviews! We just hung out, talked and laughed a bunch, so I don't remember much about the service, except it was good.I'm not a beer person, much like Tanya C. is (or was? Back in December 2013 when she wrote her review), so that wasn't the draw for me but I looked through the photos and reviews on Yelp and knew this place was going to deliver tasty food.AT and I settled on prosciutto sammies, one for each. We couldn't pass up the interesting combo of parmesan, arugula, apricot compote, and roasted almond butter with the eponymous cured meat. The sandwich came open-faced with a great balance of flavors. The saltiness of the prosciutto and parmesan worked well with the peppery crunch of arugula, roasted nuttiness of the almond butter, and the sweetness of the apricot compote. AT got the mac and cheese and I opted for the roasted brussels sprouts. The mac and cheese was fantastic, wonderfully creamy and perfectly seasoned, topped with more cheese and finished off in the oven to give the final product a melty crown with slightly crunchy edges. This was a classic done right, made with beer and good ol' cheddar cheese. My brussels were roasted just like I like them, with slightly burnt with crisp layers.AT doesn't love sweets (especially chocolatey stuff) generally, but he still tells me to this day that the very best brownie he's ever had is the warm brownie you can get here. It's served with beer ice cream and salted caramel sauce. We'll have to order one the next time we go![Yelp365: 96/365]"}, {"review_id": "cY0lxMxDquep-V8c-rEWPQ", "user_id": "HYhcWWAvzggD7RISFuuUJg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/8/2017", "text": "A friend of mine recommended this place to me and for that, I owe him a beer. It was everything he said it would be. Truthfully, he undersold the Mission Ribs. My mouth is salivating just from thinking about those succulent things. The portion sizes are more than sufficient and the prices suggest that these other places are overcharging for inferior food. I highly suggest going even if only to eat. The beer menu was extensive and the bartenders were very knowledgeable. Space wasn't what I wanted it to be, but it may be possible that there was additional space in the back that I missed. I'm definitely going to return as I really enjoyed the vibe the last time I visited."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-porter-beer-bar-atlanta?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
