We have been for brunch and dinner and enjoyed both. Their brunch is nothing fancy but exactly what you're wanting when you think of breakfast food - they have all of the classics and of course, serve a great mimosa and bloody mary. For our last visit, we had dinner with a friend from out of town there. We sat at the bar to avoid having to wait on a table. The beer selection was pretty good and I found a great gose (my newest obsession). There is something for everyone on the dinner menu. I had broiled shrimp and rice, it was delicious.We'll definitely be back to try out more of their menu offering.P.S. It's right across from Cat Nip Cafe so you can stop by and see the sweet cats while you're there ;)"}, {"review_id": "ZMKmCX35wnY8KD5g3ZCXEA", "user_id": "qea9M6MQ2c8KCJAPlrw-7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "First time visiting Aw Shucks Greeted by a gentleman at the raw bar who got me a drink right away. Which is rare now a days with a full bar. Came in on crab night but ended up ordering two dozen oysters first the sampler and decided on bay breeze oysters as my second dozen , hands down best experience I've had in a long time.

It's tucked away in the corner of 21st, but I am so glad I discovered a legit seafood and oyster bar. You can either get a raw oyster sampler or pick specific types of oysters. I was pretty overwhelmed by all the options but the waitress explained each types of oyster in a way more detail than I cared to know haha. I liked the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer. It comes with raw salmon and white cream cheese sauce. It sounds like an unconventional combination but it pairs really well. I would come back again to try a main entree too."}, {"review_id": "tO1ujARbsh_pMJn3lv6BzA", "user_id": "CS6qqGmJh5lc5PthPMsY1w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "We had dinner last night after my daughter dance performance at GSA.  The service was slow to begin.  It was kind of late with a small crew.

Cost for oysters were a little pricey in my opinion, but the po boy was a great bang for your buck.Service was hilarious; we had a waitress who spoke at the volume of a small shy child. She seemed knowledgable about the oysters, but I couldn't hear about 80% of what she was saying. Service was a little slow, but the covered patio was a nice place to enjoy the weather while waiting."}, {"review_id": "YLLKdXu4MneeBH2Eg5CZxQ", "user_id": "lH5C4TODfgc8E2Na7Uhreg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Most of what we ordered was soaked in grease.  My sandwich was so greasy that the bun became soggy and the whole thing fell apart.  However, the pasta was dry and hardly had any sauce and it was far too salty."}, {"review_id": "EKcxfchEdBrFiqmocUWGXQ", "user_id": "hcrUC7_f-mFwvhWuJMr8cw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/5/2017", "text": "All you can eat crab legs.

I went with colleges for a work lunch meeting. It was after the lunch crowd and hardly anyone in the restaurant so we were glad about that since we were a nice size group. It's a rustic restaurant with wood tables, chairs and long bar seating. Menu boards as big as the room with the daily specials adds a nice touch. Our waitress was mediocre, a little less personable but after a while you can't ask for more these days. Our food took long to come out even though we all had sandwiches (burgers and fish). Don't understand the long wait since it wasn't hardly anyone there. The lunch menu is extensive and great sides like sauté spinach and sweet potatoe mash. Once I finally got my fish sandwich it was good. The fish was beer battered- light and crispy! It was a very nice size. For my side, I did get the sauté spinach and that was also good. It wasn't overly cooked and nice flavor. My colleague's said their burger was good but a few of their burger was little raw & It was supposed to be well cooked so they had to recook it. Glad I was able to try it out but after two hours I wouldn't go for lunch again."}, {"review_id": "wnPU2AJwGee2QK2EPuSoQQ", "user_id": "EpH9LtS1kmlL1nqYM-pREQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Stopped in for lunch with my colleague while in town for a couple business meetings.

They have indoor and outdoor seating but the place isn't that big so we had to wait at the bar after we put our names on the list. After fifteen minutes we were seated at a small two person table by the front door and the restrooms and from my video you can see how dark it was which made it hard to read my menu so I had to use my flashlight on my phone. Also since the table was so small I had to hold my purse on my lap or put it on the beer/soda box that held the condiments. I was not impressed with the food at all, the seasoning was bland and they put peppercorn in the crab cake which destroyed it for me. Been here another time and had fish which was bland as well so I will not be returning."}, {"review_id": "qOVa6GCCYXKR2qxOOHiQBA", "user_id": "ttA8hHD-aY9CCSEyk1yyTg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Oysters were fresh and the food was great as well.
