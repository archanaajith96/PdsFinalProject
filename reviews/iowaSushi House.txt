I always feel as though the name throws people off because they have so much more than just sushi. I don't even really like most types of sushi. I go to this place to get the greatest noodles dishes I've found in Cedar Rapids. Also their tempura is to die   for! The service is always competent and friendly and they remember you and treat you like a valued customer."}, {"review_id": "j6zhmLBmjGnsHoX60hjVAQ", "user_id": "bf-56jwAjZubeWxdPop0nA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "Fifteen years ago Sushi House was the one and only sushi joint in Cedar Rapids.  Then, it was worth the 20 minute drive from the NE side.  Now, too many good sushi restaurants between my house and Sushi House keep me away and so today's visit was after many, many years.  I hit it up at 2:25 p.m. on a weekday with only 5 minutes to spare to get the lunch specials that end at 2:30 p.m.  The server moved quickly to get my order in the system before the clock kicked me out.  She continued to be attentive, efficient, and friendly throughout my visit and I give the place 5 stars for service (granted, there were only 4 tables occupied.). I got the California Combo Bento Box which turned out to be three times the amount of food I could eat at lunch.  Good combo of hot foods (miso soup and tempura) and cold food (Cali roll, 3 large pieces sashimi, salad, and orange slices).   I ordered hot tea as my drink and didn't get charged, so it must be complimentary.  Food was good, not amazing, not bad, good.  I give it 3.5 stars.  The tempura batter was a bit bland and the salad needed some kind of seasoning.  The sashimi was excellent and bigger than expected size, and the California Roll seemed more robust than at other sushi places.  Way too much food for one person, however, and none of it would make for a good leftover meal.  So, I recommend sharing a lunch combo.I still won't make the trip to that side of town for sushi, but if I'm in the neighborhood, I will return."}, {"review_id": "EmdWhGETRPCgL0weRY-Ibg", "user_id": "WSF-GQyvTp4-HNz_B1P0HQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "SO GOOD. I wish there were more stars to give because WOW. If you're a picky eater, there is bound to be something here for you. The menu is quite large with not only sushi but many other Chinese and Japanese entrees. I typically go here for the sushi/sashimi and have yet to have anything I haven't liked. My current fav is the shiitake mushroom roll. The lightly fried mushrooms are rolled up with scallions and doused in just the right amount of eel sauce. Drool. The service has always been speedy and pleasant on my many visits. Oh, and the cost can't be beat. So much quality food for an affordable price. If you're into sushi, I definitely recommend you make time to visit this restaurant.

I used to frequent this spot in 2009-2010 and had to stop by. As one of my all time favorite casual Asian restaurants, I had expectations and wasn't let down. It honestly wasn't quite as good as I remembered, but far above average and exceptional for the area. I would say it's still better than any Asian restaurant (besides the now defunct Gary Chu's) in the North SF Bay Area; an area with far more restaurants, a much larger Asian population and a tendency to have restaurants of a high caliber. If you're in the area and love Japanese or Chinese food, I would definitely give it a try."}, {"review_id": "3yePbPqWhgU_3yh6-KPb-Q", "user_id": "Ao2VYIw9AMKOTiCUwe_T9A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/11/2016", "text": "Pretty solid meal at the Sushi House.  Ordered Fried Rice w/ Chicken and a couple of sushi rolls.  Rolls were very good.  I had the Smoked Salmon and the California.  The fish in the salmon roll was fresh tasting and both rolls were tasty and presented well.  The Fried Rice was a huge portion, had plenty of meat and also had good flavor.  Service was almost too good!  I don't know if it was because it was late in evening or this was normal, but the staff seemed to be in high gear.  Really nothing to complain about, it was actually fun n to watch!"}, {"review_id": "eETlp5R5Lm2LA_KePj5ZLg", "user_id": "c5TS-AvEe9n0bfnFfpfPrw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "Ate here last night had the best service I've had in Cedar Rapids in a long time!!!

We got there at eleven to beat the lunch rush (it picks up like crazy from 11:30-1.) and we were sat right away. There were three of us. We waited a good twenty minutes to be greeted by our waiter, waited another ten for drinks, and then our food came out at random intervals after that. It was a \"eat or wait for your friends to get their food and yours will be ice cold by the time theirs arrives\" situation. The people next to us, who were seated after us, all had their food long before us. I had my food, another friend had half of their food, and another friend had zero food. Finally, a half hour after I had gotten my food, she flagged our waiter and asked where her food was. The waiter just told her they hadn't made it yet. About another ten minutes later, her food arrived. It was a good thing we didn't have any meetings to get back to in the office. Our lunch took almost two hours! I got the teriyaki chicken box, and it was disgusting. The fried rice was greasy, and their were more onions than chicken--the big gross slimy kinds of onions. How cheap to fill a plate with onions instead of meat. There was zero flavoring on the chicken either, or it was incredibly watered down. I will never eat there again."}, {"review_id": "-6Gzn7WP_pcZWtTURJf9mw", "user_id": "UhAXMafJ2_NQDgjGCY9cYg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/23/2017", "text": "Before yesterday this was my favorite sushi place ever! That soon changed once I realized that I had been overcharged on the previous day's bill when I called to order again. They told me \"you ordered something else because we are never wrong\"! The female owner is rude and prejudiced and basically called me a liar! Then some nobody minion employee told me they were not going to refund me and that \"egg rolls would make my total equal what it did\" and I HATE egg rolls and would never order them! I finally asked for the real owner and got a better, more classy response though they still have yet to resolve my issue in any way."}, {"review_id": "dX29M_Xeybg6-SAIcVddlA", "user_id": "3fcPWYo9tTmurAFVFaJTvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "I've been going to the Sushi House Since it opened.

I generally frequent this establishment for lunch and purchase a bento box. This comes with entree, salad, soup, tempura, some sushi. It's a great way to sample the various options on the menu and is very tasty. The sushi and sashimi are made to order in the restaurant and it's fun to watch the creations. I've also tried their sushi cones which were tasty but I found to be cumbersome to try and eat. They were large and fell apart as I attempted to dip them in soy sauce. They offered a larger portion size than sushi and essentially tasted the same so that is note worthy. They are usually pretty busy around the noon meal but the service is quick and efficient."}, {"review_id": "mQ1mBNEfMCVzdmlrFc_aqg", "user_id": "lypig3BfUk3nY18oeDvJ4w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "sushi here is probably the freshest so far in Iowa and they offer a lot of different options for nigiri, sashimi, and maki rolls.
