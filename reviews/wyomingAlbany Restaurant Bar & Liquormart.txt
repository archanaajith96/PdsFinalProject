Food is great, service is friendly, timely, and accurate. I think they have the best steak in town. Their fried chicken is also very good. They sell a lot prime rib, but I don't care for that cut. They are reasonably priced and in a great location. Stop in for a meal sure to satisfy."}, {"review_id": "MixGRelIkV54RTKGBrUGcg", "user_id": "Z1IMxOT1Z8Sst7knbJDSbA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "We stopped here on the way back home to Chicago from California. We (me, my father, and daughter) walked in, stood for a minute not knowing if we should seat ourselves or not. As the waitress walked by we asked \"is anywhere okay?\" To which she didn't respond. We went ahead to seat ourselves. After several moments, we still weren't acknowledged. Normally, I would just get up and leave, but we had already driven so far through what could only be described a barren wasteland, and we still had to make it through Nebraska! We finally became visible to our waitress and she asked us what we wanted to drink-before even giving us menus. We asked for some menus... Our waitress came back and we ordered. I had the Greek salad. It was okay. It was more expensive than the upscale Greek restaurants in downtown Chicago though. My dad had the steak sandwich. He really liked it. My daughter however had to bring things like steak sauce, ketchup, salt and pepper to the table. My daughter is a VERY picky eater, esp. on road trips and really only likes what I cook at home. All she wanted was some fries and a salad of cucumbers and tomatoes. When I ordered for my daughter and explained her pickiness, our waitress looked at me like I had thee heads. The food was good enough, but out of all the places we ate from Chicago all the way across I-40, all through California, and from California across I-80, this place was the most disappointing. Again, the food was fine, nothing spectacular, maybe a bit overpriced for what it was, but the service was awful. Next time on this route I'll be sure to eat in Laramie and bypass Cheyenne altogether."}, {"review_id": "bAP8ULBBcr0X11umbKTuuQ", "user_id": "Tx643uSIwX2UsoD-5YR1eA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/11/2015", "text": "I wandered in here one night after taking in the historic square of downtown Cheyenne.

Cool!The people were very friendly and the service was great!They have a large menu, from burgers to steaks to sandwiches to soups and salads. It was hard to choose. Everything was fresh, hot and made to order.

Tender, roasted turkey, creamy mashed potatoes, seasoned cream gravy, on a soft slab of white bread. Accompanied by a healthy dollop of whole berry cranberry sauce on the side. Got it? This is what you'll get at the Albany! Just perfect. Generous portion - bring an appetite! Beer selection is serviceable, but uninspired.

Exotic, rare drink, sumptuous foods....unfortunately this is not the case. In the liquor store one FULL WALL (there are only two with beer) is devoted to domestic macros that you can find at any 7-11. The finest they had on the other was a respectable selection of Odell's and New Belgium. The wines were funny: lots of low-end screw tops that you could find mostly anywhere (bare foot, quail run-esque)...the liquor selection was a bit better but followed the theme...basically a pretty standard, nothing special liquor store. The service was great- nice people. Skip the food in the adjoining restaurant. My bacon cheeseburger was a previously frozen, now burnt Sysco hockey puck of a poor excuse. Bun was good, fries were cold. Again, service was good- just crap products.  2.5 stars."}, {"review_id": "xxdPdrOG-_UoASCG1TA0jA", "user_id": "j4RqspoCqcDe9B5Wl9lA4A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/9/2017", "text": "I had a business trip in Cheyenne and tried this place out due to recommendation from hotel employee. I ordered the prime rib sandwich and one of the giant beers. The bartender with a Russian accent was not friendly at all and basically ignored me despite it being fairly empty. The sandwich came out and it was a monstrous prime rib on a sub roll. I had to make the decision to either cut each bite or tear at the meat with my teeth like an animal. Overall, it was okay but not great. The portion of the steak was great but the functionality of eating it like a sandwich was not."}, {"review_id": "cMcMZ_-qg-3OoV-NN8rNKw", "user_id": "06LxGmnYdnSvBRS_LVLN5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/22/2017", "text": "I came back for Frontier Days and stopped in to grab a bite to eat.

It was hard to pass up the freshly homemade strawberry cheesecake for dessert, but when I saw Jack Daniels bread pudding on the menu, I had to order it!  It was a trip straight to heaven!  Yum!  Also, our waitress was attentive and very pleasant.
