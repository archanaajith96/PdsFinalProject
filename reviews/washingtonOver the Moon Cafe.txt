Typically I am a cheapskate when it comes to eating out. If I go to a place where I have to spend over $20 on a plate I usually leave unhappy, especially if it is a steak place. My wife and I made a trip out here around our anniversary a year ago and I have just sat on this review because I didnt know how to write it. When it comes down to it this place is awesome. It has that Tacoma kitchy feel to it. We sat at the upper level and you sit in old school lounge chairs. There are fun little old notes and books sitting around and it just has a weird homey feel to it. Outside of the atypical decor the food was really good. I honestly dont remember what we had, but the bread was great, and the pasta was delicious!! I specifically remember being very happy with what we got.... just kidding I looked at the menu and remembered immediately. I got the duck breast and it was amazing and my wife got the short rib ragu and she was very happy with it. I am not a picky eater, but I have had duck a few times and its either perfectly cooked and is fatty and good, or its horribly cooked and comes out dry. This was absolutely perfectly cooked. Like I said, typically I am displeased with places where we get two meals and leave spending over $60, but I left very happy and plan on making a trip again, but probably only for special occasions. Definitely worth checking out!!"}, {"review_id": "XT169HxlwyPKz4DKltIoIw", "user_id": "DboEIHYrzMXU_AosqGVxEA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "My husband and I were apartment hunting, and he dug this restaurant up on Yelp due to the high reviews. He thought it might be a good celebratory meal for my new job. We entered the restaurant, and the atmosphere was kind of like if Danielle Steele didn't go into writing romance, but created a restaurant. There were flowing drapes, and little tables with stuffed comfy chairs. Our table had a lamp on it, and was up against a rail, with a cool tapestry  separating us from the half floor below. It's like it came straight out of the Heart, These Dreams, video. I mean that in a good way. On our table had a couple of inspirational mini books, and a box of happy notes written by people I just assumed visited the restaurant. I did notice that the vast majority of the clientele were older women that looked well off, and in favor of the large wine selection. I noticed a lot of expensive purses, wine for lunch, and pricey blond highlights. This meant my husband and I, two very tattooed younger men that trend towards rather disputable looking, stood out a lot. However, the waitress/host didn't even blink. She treated us well, and didn't hesitate. She was super nice to us. The ladies at the tables around us, were a little more aware of us, though. I honestly think if they had realized we were gay, and not two lost blue collar guys, they would have not been so worried. However, it was kind of weird eating with the ladies next to us shooting us looks. That isn't on the restaurant, but on the \"Can I see the manager\" haircut lady next to us. My husband ordered the French dip, and I got the fancy Mac'n'Cheese. We were driving, so we didn't order wine, but I did notice a decent number of beer on the menu, if you aren't into wine. They also have a great upscale soda pop selection, if you don't drink at all. The food arrived fairly quickly, and was just as good as the restaurant smelled. Everything was done spot on, cooking-wise, and I will have to come back and sample some of the other menu items. I'm a sucker for fancy Mac, and they did this so well, I considered licking the bowl clean. I have to say I don't really go to restaurants like this a lot. When I was young, I cooked at a high end restaurant, and often I will go, and be disappointed because I could have made it better myself for half the price. This restaurant is the exception. From a technical food standpoint, everything was perfect. I will definitely be coming back again. The only hitch was when attempting to use the bathroom, the men's room lock wouldn't open. Neither my husband or I could get it to open separately. This meant I snuck into the ladies room, to do my business and get out. I have to say that was the nicest and fanciest ladies room, I have ever seen in my life. I'm not sure if the mens' room is as fancy, but I'm kind of jealous."}, {"review_id": "LOivQqlI3zLGgwCDZ2AAtg", "user_id": "G9P3h7ZGdbdc_Zt6IKC2vQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/11/2018", "text": "I did a To-Go order, but the place is SUPER cute inside. It's definitely a cute date night, or even a girls night out type atmosphere.Crab bisque (cup $5) - I LOVED that it had a ton of fresh crab - I just wish it had more of the crab flavor. I'm not sure what else is mixed in, but I think it overpowered the crab a bit.Short Rib Ragu ($29) - this was a bit pricey for the amount of meat. Though, I will say the meat was tender, and the whole entree's ingredients complimented each other. Cinnamon roll cake ($8) - not the best - I ordered due to all the positive Yelp reviews, however it definitely needed more cinnamon. The icing made up for the slight dryness of the cake.It would be worth another shot."}, {"review_id": "VCLUsyM7-Tcg3MwwLgDyDA", "user_id": "HkkcMEYusp45v9eOnssMVQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "So, I had made reservations here for mine and my partner's twelve year anniversary and even mentioned to the person I made the reservation with that it was an \"anniversary dinner.\" I was told they would tell our server so they could congratulate us and they would put a candle on our dessert when ordered. Our server never once mentioned anything nor did she do anything special for our dessert we ordered. Don't get me wrong, she was nice but never did anything to acknowledge our special occasion. Also, she greeted and chit chatted with every table BUT OURS! She was slow and never got us refills on our drinks and took her sweet time with everything. The other problem, the table we were seated at was a bit dirty. Lamp was dirty and the railing it was up against was sooooo dusty. Doesn't take much to wipe down once a night but I guess that's too much of a chore for them.The food however was divine. I ordered the salmon dish, which was amazing. And my partner ordered the duck breasts which was also great tasting. Dessert was alright.

The restaurant is tucked in an alley off one of the main roads. Inside we were greeted to an old town Tacoma feel- a small cafe with exposed brick walls and class. I went here for lunch with my mom and sister and we had a wonderful experience. Our wine came in a generous pour and tasted exactly as the menu described. Our meals were simply amazing. My mom and I had salads with soup and my sister had the grilled cheese. The salads were a perfect size for lunch and very fresh. The grilled cheese was gooey and comforting. It also came with an apricot compote to die for. Our server Thor was awesome. He was very kind, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. We had a fantastic time at this charming cafe and I highly recommend giving it a go!"}, {"review_id": "WzLdGWn7F7p8Qv9pvpMDcg", "user_id": "E_GAXhVA1_lVC2aFpMQElA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/14/2017", "text": "I really like going to Over the Moon Cafe! The atmosphere is very pleasant and alluring. The menu items have a hint of the exotic from your typical places around town and the ingredients are fresh and flavorful. The cafe is located in Opera Alley which is such a great location and compliments the restaurant quite well. To me going here is best for a special occasion but that doesn't have to be the case necessarily with every outing here.When I went here I ordered their Spring-in-to-Summer ratatouille which comprised of onion, garlic, eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash, green and yellow bell pepper, roma tomato, parmesan, parsley and thyme. That dish was a sheer delight! I did wind up taking some home though!Their other menu items look very enticing as well which indeed warrants several return trips in the future at least to try them out.A very classy restaurant and when I was there... not noisy at all in the slightest... a very peaceful place to enjoy your meal."}, {"review_id": "EmicodOxAjsFPVjnSQst3A", "user_id": "aS_C4pMUDmHJnaKMrPgM4w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "You walk in & immediately know the food is going to be great because it smells amazing.

Every time my partner and I order the duck breast dish with cherries and one other different dish (we swap plates halfway through). The duck is divine, it's juicy and tender with a nicely rendered skin. I love the sour cherries with it, and it has always come with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables (green beans, carrot, brussel sprouts, the like). We've also had the steak, creamy angel hair pasta with fish(?) and braised short rib rigatoni entrees. They are satisfying dishes. The lobster \"mac\" and cheese is penne pasta, it was creamy and decadent.We noticed the most recent time we were there, the duck dish was $38, which was surprising. I think it was $32 before. Somehow that crosses the line for us, it's not worth almost $40. One thing about this restaurant is that the menu doesn't change significantly, and the sides for the entrees are the same. For example, the steak entree had the exact same sides as the duck dish. These are not composed plates of food, I think they stick to what's safe and will please a large swath of diners. Nothing wrong with that, but after going there 4 times, I'm going to choose to dine somewhere else more exciting and daring. The desserts we've tried are pretty heavy and cloying - a turtle pie, a 'deconstructed' pumpkin pie, flourless chocolate cake. They have good coffee. The upstairs tables with armchairs are very cute and comfy. The other tables and downstairs are not as charming but okay. I think it's a cute restaurant and with solid good food. I like that it's a small business and been around for a while. But with the recent price increase and predictable menu, I'll think twice before going there again."}, {"review_id": "QnQZGsbxc9rVrV1g-7VI9A", "user_id": "cusQBD-Ceuo2dhF9BmL_Hg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Great little restaurant in Tacoma.

This is a tiny cafe and they are always busy, so plan reservation ahead of time, otherwise you might never get a table. The ambiance is intimate, cozy, and dim w/ candles. The price is a little on the higher end, but the portions are huge and you get unlimited bread and butter. Food was excellent and fresh, so in my opinion it was worth the price.I ordered the braised short rib ragyu and a glass of Iris Piot Noir, Oregon. The short rib ragyu was very tender and they give you a lot of meat in the dish. Like I mentioned earlier, the portions are quite large so you can actually share this between 2 ppl (they do charge a fee for splitting plates). The red that I chose paired quite nicely with the ragyu. My meal was about $40, it was $29 for the ragyu and about $14 for the red. The food comes out really slow as well because I think this cafe is meant for people to just enjoy their food and have a good time with their company and have lots of conversations.
