Historic and quaint area along the river we happened upon while in the region for a track meet. Late morning so we were looking for maybe coffee, maybe breakfast but not against a beer and lunch and this place fit the need perfectly.Building itself is historic and has seen use as a blacksmith shop, speakeasy, and filling station (to name a few). They kept as much of the old architecture as possible both interior and exterior playing on the blacksmith shop theme with a corner dedicated to just that. Very pleasant appearance walking in with some outdoor seating and an incense burner. It's small on the inside with not a lot of seating but that's part of the charm and it wasn't busy when we stopped (11am Saturday). Everything is either brick, iron, or wood; very nice.First thing I noticed walking in: NO TV'S! There was one on a far wall but it was smaller and not turned on. Thank you! It's nice to see a place focus on the food, service, atmosphere, and allow the customers to enjoy each others company.A good selection of beers and ciders either on tap or bottled/canned; mostly local. This isn't a place to find a wall-full of taps as it's small but it will have something you want.I wasn't expecting much of a menu but was pleasantly surprised. A nice choice of appetizers, breakfast, salads, sandwiches and soup. Everything was a bit unique but simple enough for anyone to understand and enough choices that anyone could find something. I enjoyed the BREW signature salad and my wife just loved the Hulk Smash breakfast sandwich. Food was really topnotch stuff. Well-balanced, delicious, very appealing. No burgers or fries here as they don't have a grill or fryer.Prices were in line. My salad was $9 and my wife's breakfast $7. Portion size was just right for us. Super service. We were welcomed when we came in, thanked when we left, helpful in ordering and checking on us during our meal and food delivery was quick.  It wasn't just one person either as everyone working there seemed to have a singular goal in mind: serving the customer. If we're ever back in East Davenport, Iowa we will definitely stop in again."}, {"review_id": "nxpqDdLQkvPOZzA_IiDEjw", "user_id": "k74mdgq647d8-Kn5X--j0g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Understated hipster vibe in the Village of East Davenport, i.e., this is where the cool kids hang out.  There are other bars down the street, but this is where you can get high quality food and a rotating selection of beers and wine. I've only had the appetizers here and they're amazing and fresh. This last time I went I got the pretzel (seriously? It's so big that it hangs on a banana holder). Pretty salty, but warm and fluffy with three different sauces: beer cheese, cranberry sweet mustard, and spicy Boetje's mustard (a local favorite).When it's warmer, the outdoor patio is perfect for people watching. No matter if you start or end the night here, you can't go wrong."}, {"review_id": "3EkDnkjcSX-P4BN7U364zg", "user_id": "6Zj796_rmfEuxtpC9g1Mjw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Great find!  Good beers on tap, lengthy and unique sandwich menu, fresh ingredients and friendly service. Walked in the door and was greeted by a friendly \"Hi! Come on in!\"  Picked a couple sour beers and ordered Cranberry Turkey Brie on a pretzel roll, grilled cheese, and Brew Club sandwiches. Came with cottage cheese (with pecans and dried cranberries) and, since they were out of chips, some grilled potatoes. All excellent in flavor and quality. Definitely going back!Love this town!!"}, {"review_id": "iEVVq6xpHFPl2wDcAZ1myQ", "user_id": "gegVL4tmD5SY2bFQTFSRxA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/28/2017", "text": "I visited BREW for lunch on a Sunday. The Village location couldn't be more perfect, and BREW is adorable inside and out. The exposed brick, cool decor and menu boards make for a very nice atmosphere. Our waitress, Jaymie, is a friend of mine from high school and she did a great job serving us throughout the meal. The menu at BREW isn't large and features mainly sandwiches and salads. My cousin and I both opted for sandwiches. I got a Cuban, which came generously portioned on a very tasty bread. My cousin was also pretty happy with her sandwich. Both meals included sides of chips and cottage cheese, which were a little bit underwhelming.Although BREW in the Village did a nice job of putting together a couple of satisfying sandwiches and the venue itself is attractive, I'm not sure that this is a spot I'm going to rush back to. It was not an experience memorable enough to go with the price tag. If I return, it will be with the intention of trying other offerings such as beer or tea rather than visiting specifically for lunch."}, {"review_id": "QIBwKFD3jOSQp-dyu6D0TQ", "user_id": "Z8-ITInQAuSyop-1K0PYdg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/1/2017", "text": "Great beer.Great people.The food is even better.  This place should be called 2 Guys and a Toaster oven because the food that is served here is delicious.  If you find yourself within a days travel of BREW, do yourself a favor and stop in and grab a beer and have some really good food."}, {"review_id": "soad6zP2a1wYxap_-izoeA", "user_id": "zwDOGpRwWmXqT9ifqn_Ucw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "Went on a date with my husband it's very cute not your ideal idea of a restaurant more of a bar setting but very nice the food was somewhat okay it wasn't out of the world the waiter forgot some of our items hahahahaha so by the time we had everything it was cold.

My first visit was almost 2 weeks ago for dinner and drinks. I ordered a salad as a wrap (this is an option on the menu), but when I received my meal it had chicken on it, even though there was no chicken on the salad I'd ordered. I pointed this out to the server who said, \"Oh, well when you order the wrap it automatically comes with chicken\" and did not offer to exchange my meal. I don't eat meat, but was starving, so I ended up scraping all of the chicken out of the wrap and trying to eat around it. Unfortunately the wrap was 90% chicken (great buy if you eat chicken!) and had almost nothing from the salad I'd originally ordered. I will chalk this up to the server miscommunication with the kitchen about my order and not understanding the menu. I went again later in the week for the Mother's Day brunch with my parents. We got there fairly early and the staff were welcoming, the sun was shining, and we were waited on very generously out on the patio. Our drinks never went empty and the brunch buffet was a great idea! At $15 a person, \"all you can eat\" I am so glad I took my parents here instead of waiting in long lines somewhere else. The bottomless mimosas were great, and they now serve liquor, so my parents ordered Bloody Marys and enjoyed them. I appreciated that the server asked if bacon was okay in the Bloody, because some people don't eat meat/pork.Overall I would rate the new version of BREW as 5 stars, except for the unrequested chicken incident noted above. I will make sure to stop by here more for different meals to keep seeing what new items they develop!"}, {"review_id": "hGQo59p_ovY_g978EtzXQw", "user_id": "XXYtNXLgh9mb_cdzf1GlUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/6/2017", "text": "Ok....  not only did I fall in love with this charming neighborhood, which ultimately lead me searching on zillow for a flipper, but this place was FANTASTIC!

This hit the spot! It is not a big place but it is unique. The building itself has a lot of history. The walls are exposed brick and the decor is mostly original to the old blacksmith shop. This is not your typical bar food, they don't even have a fryer. We both had 1/2 a Brew signature salad with 1/2 of a turkey, cranberry and brie on a pretzel roll. Everything was delicious and we were a little pressed for time but the food was quick to arrive. My choice of wine was excellent as well. I was told they serve an excellent brunch on the weekends.

As I searched Yelp for places that had prosciutto I happened upon this little place that wasn't too far off of the interstate. I convinced my boyfriend to stop here for lunch and boy am I glad that I did! I started off with a delicious cranberry mimosa and the Brew board. The brew board was excellent. It had prosciutto, salami, white cheddar, blue cheese, Brie, honey, walnuts. It was so good I ate the whole thing before my boyfriend even had a chance.To top off my craving for prosciutto, I ordered the prosciutto and cheese sandwich. While it's exactly as described it was served on a warm pretzel bun. It definitely hit the spot! For anybody traveling on I-80 I recommend stopping by this cozy little place, you definitely won't regret it!"}, {"review_id": "c87dPKczmTtJUsK-35f2WA", "user_id": "6nvSNVIr2HS6Vvtgjf22Sw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/2/2017", "text": "Great food and good atmosphere.
