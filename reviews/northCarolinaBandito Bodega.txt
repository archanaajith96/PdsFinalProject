I'm hoping I just ordered the wrong thing and maybe the tacos are better as I'm willing to try again if I'm in the area.I ordered the kimchi friend rice and it was very heavy and greasy. There was very little kimchi in the dish which was the main appeal for ordering it. Mostly just rice with lots of oil. I didn't even eat half and could tell if I had I would have suffered later :(My friend ordered the crispy taco and said it was just ok.Love a hidden gem and hope I just had a bad ordering choice. May give a different item a try in the future but I can't recommend what had today ."}, {"review_id": "qfqlwDaNRwiUfm0Khb17uw", "user_id": "5uJTJnINckyAchF6mf7sLg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Awesome food from this hole in the wall place in an unlikely location.

I ordered the crispy rolled tacos, fries, and the orange Jarrito soda. Man, I was completely satisfied and had a good portion left over. The crispy rolled tacos were extremely savory. Reminds me of lumpia (Filipino egg rolls) with just the right amount of beef. The sauce was a mild flavor. I am not one for spice, so I used the cold sour cream to help tone the spice...excellent pairing for this dish! The fries were crispy and warm. The soda made me belch after the first sip.

If you're ever in the mood for Mexican with a twist and really bold flavors, I would highly recommend. Their kimchi fried rice is so delicious!!

Yes, please!My favorite Greensboro food truck has added a restaurant to its payroll and I couldn't be happier.The menu is divided into two parts: Little and Big. My suggestion is to grab a couple of friends and order everything from the Little and share. If you're flying solo and hungry, tackle one of the burritos or bowls from the Big. Baja and Asian tacos are listed on the \"Little\" menu and can serve as appetizers, or you can double fist 'em while you drink a canned craft brew on sale.The gyoza are my favorite. I'm always on the search for perfect dumplings, and I may have found them at Bodega. Ground pork and mushrooms fill the inside of each hot, crispy pocket. Green onions and pickled shiitake mushrooms adorn each order. Hot and fresh, there's no mistake that this is the perfect little plate of food. Like, for real. Don't sleep on these.The \"Big\" menu starts with burritos and ends with rice bowls and noodles. If there's any question about the size of the burritos here, that notion is dispelled quickly with the first on the list, the Big Ass Burrito. This signature menu item is what put the food truck and now the restaurant on the map. Filled with the same ingredients as the Baja taco with the addition of a green tomatillo sauce, it takes two hands to handle this bad boy. There's even a crude illustration of how to enjoy a Bandito burrito hanging over the counter.Served with a side of crispy tortilla chips and tomato salsa, it's truly enough to share with a friend. The furikake fries are bomb. They come in a Chinese takeout container with gochujang ketchup. Furikake is a seasoning mix of dried seaweed, sesame seeds and other spices. Sprinkled on the hot, fresh fries directly from the fryer, the seasoning is fragrant, salty and savory. Gochujang is a Korean red chili paste that melds into the ketchup giving it a little sweetness and depth, far beyond regular bottled ketchup.When you're ready to step up your palate's culinary game and go outside of the regular old Chinese takeout box, give Bandito Bodega a try."}, {"review_id": "J7cpn0Du1iHRd9l2lEnMsg", "user_id": "ZfN4FTXN38DV3nO58FfPIA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/10/2017", "text": "Not what I expected, but pretty good and really fresh!

Let's start by stating the obvious you will find every representation of taste in this corner restaurant. It's located on friendly avenue away from the business/ shopping sector of the friendly center. There are a number of good choices - the bowls are the bodega of carbs, protein and nutritious vegetables and earthly roots. The rice bowls are the epitome of a bodega for your taste. My favorite was as BIG Ass Bowl (BAB) the tuna bowl is another favorite of mine. Â Seating- not too much seating is available.

The combination of tastes and textures make this dish!The Big Ass Burrito is a big ass burrito (white rice, black beans, pico de gallo, black bean & corn, radish, red cabbage, cilantro, chipotle crema, & tomatillo verde) and is generally a nice dish, though not all the individual tastes come through. The tortilla they use here is not one I'm overly fond of, a bit thick and rather bland tasting. The steak in this burrito was awesome, and I'd get this again, but as a big ass bowl rather than a burrito.The Kimchi Quesadilla with Pork was not a dish I'd order again. As with the burrito, the tortilla is just to thick, too bland, and the kimchi lacks the sharpness of the well fermented Korean version I very much like, and the tortilla was burnt in spots, leaving it a bit bitter. Both of the Baja Tacos were super, and loaded (pico de gallo, black bean & corn, red cabbage, cilantro, chipotle crema, & radish), and we added guacamole and cheese. They are are not cheap at $3.25 before the add ons, but they are well sized. The Rice & Beans were rather ordinary, though some of the condiments helped there!The Chips and Salsa was nice - the salsa is more a pico de gallo than a salsa, but very nice tastes here, a touch of heat. The chips may have slipped a bit past their \"use by date\"! This is a small, funky place with a limited amount of seating, and a rather awkward ordering/pickup arrangement, with a rather broad counter area between you and the person working the register. We found some items we very much liked, and found an item or two we'd pass on."}, {"review_id": "pvQ2ES9Idst-jtJ7qqpq9Q", "user_id": "Uirmdjo0WqE5RyekqryrWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/20/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Man this hands down is Â my favorite spot in Greensboro.

That is almost reason alone to give them a 5 star review. But beyond that, everything they do just seems to be awesome. I loved the Bandito food truck, and was really excited to hear they have opened a permanent location. I stopped in last night for dinner, and there were a few folks dining in, but most patrons appeared to be getting food to go. I took a seat at the counter, and the waitress/cashier took my order.Whether you are dining in or taking out, you'll order at the counter in front of the kitchen window, and you'll pre-pay for your meal and get a number. There really is not a traditional waiter setup here. Drinks are all bottled, including water, and each have a charge, so just be prepared for that. They do not have brewed tea either, a little bit of a let down for this sweet tea fan, but that disappointment did not last long at all.I had the Southwest Pimento burrito with Chorizo as my meat, and it was just fantastic. The combo of spicy chorizo sausage, creamy pimento cheese, rice, beans, and guacamole was killer, and very filling. Make no mistake, this burrito is huge. Well worth the $10 price tag. Many people might get more than one meal out of this if they order a side or appetizer as well. I also ordered a side of chips and salsa. These are very thick chips, with a brilliant crunch, and perfectly salted. It came with two salsas, a pico de gallo salsa and a bean based salsa similar to \"texas caviar.\" I ran out of salsa before running out of chips, but they were happy to give me more salsa at no charge. Would order the chips again just because they were tasty, but you'd be full on just a burrito alone.Other people who came wandering in ordered all sorts of delicious things, and in great variety of flavors. I'm anxious to try more. The ribs looked great, will have to give them a shot sometime.Five stars all the way."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/bandito-bodega-greensboro?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
