It is such a great place for a quick bite. 2 empanadas are the perfect meal when you're not super hungry, but don't want garbage fast food.Empanadas are like super delicious meat pockets. Light flaky pastry wrapped abound several meat/veg combinations.Tangos is not a fancy place mind you. It is a converted small doughnut shop. It has a few tables, but sparsely appointed. You are getting the bare essentials as far as seating, utensils, etc. Not a first date spot...lol But don't let that scare you off....GO HERE !Super friendly staff (family I think). It is my go-to spot for that quick bite on the run."}, {"review_id": "yYh4bfO70LgGxkXbTJ4p1g", "user_id": "K8LbQCoUv94OWc3fiU7R0Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "We made a spur of the moment decision to stop in there for lunch today and turns out it was a great choice! Let me start by telling you to prepare yourself because this place looks a little dumpy . However, it was packed despite appearances so I said let's do it! Their menu consists of empanadas and sub sandwiches. Well, it wasn't even a close call for me; I wanted empanadas! They are super affordable in my opinion at $2.50 a piece; so I wanted to try a bunch of them. Between my husband, my daughter (15 and a picky eater), and myself we ordered 5 different kinds. These suckers are huge too! We thought they were mostly all delicious, yes; even the picky teen liked it  The best by far was the cheese and onion The worst, we all agreed, was the salami and cheese. I would say if you are in the area it is definitely worth a try!"}, {"review_id": "UpVqdZECfmD54GmIk_Nd_Q", "user_id": "n0n7-5kZadWJZgAlYVW3Bw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "First time in. Heard from a good number of my foodie friends that this place is great. I wanted to order so many different Emanadas but I knew I was only going to be able to eat two. I got the Gaucho and the Fugazza. I loved them and could not finish both of them. Great price, great size, delicious and filling. Try the sauces as well. Boyfriend got the Tango Sub and that was really delicious too. I'm really looking forward to coming in and trying some more empanadas. There are so many."}, {"review_id": "uSYNJNQCW2MF9GWfn0ZzMA", "user_id": "rI6Tqy2WR_ks5F47yYkZUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "So good! I ordered two veggie empanadas, the Fugazza and Cordoba. I likely butchered both of those names but you'll know them when you see them. These are tasty little food pockets in perfect crusts. Each was well under $5 meaning I will be stopping by for snacks/lunch regularly. Also, the service is wonderful. I do advise coming at 12:30 or later to avoid the 11:30-12 lunch rush. Most folks get food togo because the dining space is limited. They are not open for dinner! Close at 7pm so keep that in mind."}, {"review_id": "jh-PtnvgxJfPVUNbzcxtlw", "user_id": "DQFsZVW1r5xzfEJrZnwHdA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "If you're ever in Boise Idaho this is the place to eat.

Unfortunately we had already eaten lunch so we just got a dessert empanada! Seriously Yum! Very fresh ingredients and they obviously clean their fryer regularly. Will definitely come back for lunch or dinner.  I was going to leave a four star review but after reading a ridiculous two star review about nutrition I felt they deserved the extra star. If you're looking for a low carb high nutrient empanada, you're not gonna find it here.

Absolute bliss. Made to order pockets of heaven. Hot. Fresh. Tasty. Your choice of several meats and vegetarian empanadas. I tried two of the shredded chicken, caramelized onions and chipotle sauce. Oh my goodness. So good. And if you want to clear out your sinuses, ask for the green hot sauce.Portions are large, so two are enough unless you are really hungry. Or try the empanadas/fries combo. At $2.50 each try them all.I'll be back to try other varieties.

Well today was the day I pulled in the place was packed..good sign.. after about a five-minute wait to order I told the gentleman at the cash register that was my first time and what would he recommend, he asked me if I like spicy or mild when I indicated spicy he showed me about 4 different choices I chose the El puerco and the Mole so my daughter I chose the saltina.... I have to say the El puerco was fabulous the mole was pretty good could have used more seasoning for my taste... My daughter said hers was good that's all I could get out of the teenager so.... Now are you looking for a place with healthy low carb foods? If the answer to that question is yes move on.If you are looking for tasty food friendly service and oh super cheap prices the  Empanadas are only $2.50 each... Then this is definitely the place for you.Indoor seating is very limited they do have some outdoor seating with umbrellas and all food is cooked to order."}, {"review_id": "zxsyQAyXvu4re0h6aTlsng", "user_id": "C1c5_jM4etF_Y-enPjxeQg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/8/2017", "text": "Yummy!
