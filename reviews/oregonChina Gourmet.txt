It was delicious! Not greasy icky Americanized Chinese food like everywhere else. I had the veggies medley with fried rice and it all tasted fresh! My boyfriend had the vegetarian noodles and he enjoyed it. They give you a lot of spring rolls, which are my favorite so I was pretty happy!My only complaint was that it was WAY TOO WARM INSIDE.  I will definitely eat their food again but I'll get takeout next time."}, {"review_id": "vt25cnMKGwkXC1AHQr2KUA", "user_id": "UKblPORCc2g37raCQF9LcA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "This cute tiny Mom & Pop Chinese Restaurant serves up solid American Chinese food. The Lady who runs it remembers EVERY FACE. Even if you come in once! Even if it's a year later. It's warm inside on wintery days and the decor is authentic vintage Chinese circa 1940-60's. It's well run. Always clean. The Owners are charming and do appreciate their customers. They accommodate gluten free easily. So many vegan choices too. My only complaint is too much onion in the vegetable part of the meal. I love onions but don't want only onion. I like to see some green in there somewhere. A snow pea or two. Mini corn or broccoli would be nice to add to the mix. It's always fast. Always fresh. Always served with a smile! If your tired and cold and hungry jump in! In the summer it's cold. Goldilocks would like it here. Easy on the wallet. They do tons of takeout and parking is a breeze."}, {"review_id": "jBx18AQaFi4YOzV67SvO7w", "user_id": "9MFaoBFiybC8pKEKvkVzRA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Very good food in a small, relaxed diner setting with really reasonable prices.

She said, \"Okay, 5 minutes.\" I walked over from Broadway Coffeehouse and stepped in the door at 6:05pm. The bag was already at the counter and after paying, I walked by 6:07pm.FOODThe fried rice is a little oily, and there are only 2 pieces of shrimp. For one person, this is fine but as a dish to share, I wouldn't recommend it because of uneven shrimp portioning. The flavor is lacking in general, and it seems like they could've been a little more free with the cha siu in the dish. Will I order this 5-minute, $9 fried rice again? Probably not.#2, first visitI came in on a Sunday afternoon a few weeks ago after church and before heading to Broadway Commons to study. It was pretty empty, so I grabbed a table right away.FOODWOW things are kind of pricey, at least compared to a photo from 2013 that I saw (I know, I know, 3 years ago..). But still! I was expecting my noodles to cost $8.50 and now they're listed at $12! (Soft noodles are still available for $11). Mildly disappointed from the start - I should've checked their website menu, which is current.Crispy BBQ pork noodles - it came as combination noodles, meaning all the meats (chicken, cha siu, beef, shrimp) and veggies (zucchini, cabbage, carrot, celery, broccoli, snow peas, and mushrooms. The noodles are not the thin ones I'm used to (and wanted) in pan-fried noodles, and there weren't as many noodles as I was hoping for at $12/plate. The flavor is pretty good, though. I just wish there were more noodles and that they were the thinner ones, that I usually see when I order this in LA or SF.SPACEIt's a cozy space, but not cramped. They have a good amount of standard Chinesey decor, too, without being super tacky (sometimes it adds to the charm). Tables are set with napkins and forks, but chopsticks are available in a box on the tables.SERVICEThe waitress was nice, not overbearing, and quick enough. She does speak English well, and I believe she speaks Mandarin, but I'm one of those unfortunate ABCs who never picked up Chinese as a kid (my family's Toisan/Cantonese anyway)."}, {"review_id": "DLwoKlDBpjSTh1_OfZPEtg", "user_id": "_1SKSmLqpHBqWh09DxQMfw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/2/2017", "text": "This pace was pretty decent. I stopped here while driving between Seattle and LA based on the review. The service was decent and fast, the food was ok. I think I had orange chicken which turned out t be tasty. The portion size was decent. It is a good American Chinese restaurant. I wouldn't make a point of stopping if I was driving up the coast again.

We have had authentic Chinese in many states and even in Europe where we thought it was excellent but this little place exceeds them all. Truth. We were in town for a couple days and wanted to find a cozy little romantic place to have dinner on New Years Eve and we came across this place. Omg, we started out with the Hot and Sour soup; to die for!!! We then shared the Sweet and Sour Pork entree and Mushroom Chicken entree with fried rice on both dishes. We were blown away by the friendliness, freshness and temperature of our food! Everything was perfect. You could taste the freshness of the mushrooms, pork, chicken and other veggies; absolutely amazing. We can't wait to go back, hopefully in a few days. Try this place; you will not be disappointed; we promise."}, {"review_id": "lV265lLLCDC7qe2QRwf1tA", "user_id": "BkkYtAQn2ausiKQIGDBpMQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2016", "text": "A great find near downtown Salem. The quintessential hole-in-the-wall restaurant - just 7 tables, and all were full on this Thursday evening.China Gourmet's menu is  not overly long, like many other Chinese restaurants are. Being my first visit, I asked about the dishes, and decided on the Twice Cooked Pork. I ordered it 'hot,' and it had just the right amount of heat without overpowering the flavor, which was spectacular. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is my preference for meatier dishes. Will definitely return in the near future.~ Artists Chicken, extra spicy - 5 stars. Really enjoyed this dish which is basically General Tso's Chicken.~ Revising my rating to 5 stars after numerous excellent meals."}, {"review_id": "KMcoFPde2YgoJENJExjlvg", "user_id": "qkIHAaLxIUwAp0qD1vzKpg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2017", "text": "One of the best kungpao chicken I had.

It's not much to look at from the outside, but it serves up some really great Chinese food. For a Chinese restaurant, the menu is fairly small but that means they can focus on doing fewer items well. I had a curry chicken dish and asked for extra spicy. I often order this dish at other Chinese restaurants and this one was tops in my book. My wife had some chicken noodle dish, again tops in comparison to other places we've had it at. The folks at an adjacent table had a Beef Broccoli dish that looked so good we ordered it later in our meal to take home. The service was very friendly, attentive and the dishes all arrived quickly. All in all, this is a great little restaurant with charm and good food and we will go back any time we pass through Salem again."}, {"review_id": "jgMDXowgrqoU1Nf_T_a-fw", "user_id": "ofnBd3u2qmMOxZUKBDhK6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/22/2017", "text": "This place has incredible food.
