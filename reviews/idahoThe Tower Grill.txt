The Tower Grill had great reviews on yelp and was only about a mile away from the house.We are so glad we stumbled up this awesome little gem. The restaurant is small but very cozy with the best view of airplanes landing and taking off. My kiddos loved it!The staff was friendly and attentive to our needs. We ordered the chicken fried steak and my kiddos each got the pancakes, eggs and bacon and to our surprise a huge mickey, chocolate filled pancake came up. Very, very cool for kiddos! The chicken fried steak was delicious and huge! We took half of our breakfast home for later.I think we have found our new spot and look forward to going back!"}, {"review_id": "0pYVVVzg5jj-TQ_qlAAFqw", "user_id": "kfAs5S1XGtZZyO0QCuXD_g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "49th reviewer of Tower Grill in Nampa, Idaho at the small community airport. This is my 394th review on Yelp. Yay! I'm a fan! This place has been on my bookmarks for a while and I was finally able to visit it and was certainly glad that I did! The staff was friendly, the food was yummy, they have mimosas(!) and you can watch some small private planes take off--- yes, count me in... comfort food-- double count me in! Healthy choices--- SOLD! I ordered soup and salad-- cream of mushroom salad: All water-- skip it, and the salad was good, but... it's salad. My guy got the California Chicken with tots (great fry sauce), and just a side of fries. We had to walk up stairs (not sure if they have an elevator: if you need one you need to call to verify because this establishment is on the second floor). If you catch a solid weather day, sit outside and basque in the ambiance!I think it's worth the visit!"}, {"review_id": "5oYv_w6GEoZw9kd7SyXSIg", "user_id": "Zd8i4OGtjCD3tj9jL6524A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This place was great! The service was prompt and friendly! They accommodated our large party with smiles and fun conversation! Mercedes was sweet and efficient and the guy with the two sets of twins was a hoot! Oh and the guy filling iced tea was all over it! The food was super yummy too! We had breakfast and lunch at our table and everything was super good. The only thing I'd suggest is a little bigger piece of fish on the fish tacos!! The para hits guys were so fun and our kids dropped them over and over again from the outside staircase. Thanks for the great experience we will be back to check out the patio soon!"}, {"review_id": "YZvVGJbAiflN5YBtS75CeQ", "user_id": "TjUOmeRKRQ4NY87lh4CklQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Just popped in for dinner as always delicious!

Serves a fantastic cinnamon roll (with the perfect amount of sweetness),  perfectly crunchy and flavorful fries, bacon and onion ring cheeseburger with tasty bbq sauce, and the chicken sandwich with avocado was delicious.

Full of sausage, eggs my ham, bacon and cheese.  Flavor was on point.  Hash browns were perfect.  The wait sucked.....the food and our server saved the day!  The only other complaint I have is the flies.  Because there is outdoor seating that is left open the flies come in and bother ya.  That kinda sucks too.       All in all I would come here again. The server was apologetic and did the right thing for us without us asking.  She saved the experience and the food stood out as being outstanding.  Next time I will expect it to be 5 stars"}, {"review_id": "OPhNnzGK_7_lZASIsAVtyw", "user_id": "-G7Gi7urCAOb7h-6hXl4dA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/18/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Finally a great restaurant at \"KMAN\" Nampa Airport! Delicious food, great service and really nice aviation environment! Thank you \"Nate\" for bringing your positive energy and great food! June 7, 2017Tried the fish tacos for the first and loved them!~ So in reading the reviews I find it disturbing that someone has to swear to get their point across... BTW... this is a small restaurant with a small kitchen, so if you go in and it's packed on a weekend (especially when there is and event going on) YES, your food will not be out quick.. (common sense folks) if you want quick go to McDonalds....Just posted a new picture this is the verbiage to go with it!If you frequent this delicious restaurant they will actually let your name your own food this is called The \"185\" omelette! If you like spicy food order it!"}, {"review_id": "qyQcrj674ESiavGHN244ZQ", "user_id": "DpjI2iH91R3kgKDJYYMe5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "I found this place on yelp and brought my sister and cousin here.

Pancakes are one of the sides like toast. Don't get the toast, get the pancakes. Excellent. My wife had the 172 hamburger and said it was great.

The Tower Grill had good reviews so we decided to stop in Nampa to give it a try, and I am so glad we did!Location is a little bit odd, and a lot bit amazing! Getting there you don't feel like you are headed toward any kind of public business as you head straight into the municipal airport, and you almost feel like you're maybe going somewhere you are not supposed to be as you approach the airstrip, then all of a sudden a funny little building appears with a sign for the Tower Grill! I think it must be the old tower for the airstrip? Not sure, but it looks like it. The bottom portion of the building seems to be a lounge for the pilots/spectators, but you go upstairs to the restaurant. The room is pretty small, but is well decorated with antique aircraft parts and pictures, and doesn't feel crowded. There is also an outdoor deck that I am sure is great when the weather is nice. The best part is the view - from the restaurant or the outdoor seating area you have a view of planes taking off and landing. So it is a great experience for plane-lovers, or I bet kids would love it! I was so impressed with the atmosphere, I almost forgot we were there to eat! We ordered a mimosa each which I saw being poured, and contained a generous amount of champagne (they also have a small selection of beer, and even have a deal of PBR for $2). I ordered biscuits and gravy and my husband got the giant breakfast burrito. I got the side order of B&G and I was glad I did because it was huge! I don't think I could have finished the full breakfast. The biscuits were light and fluffy and the gravy was thick and rich; everything was topped off with a sprinkle of bacon that added an extra flavor profile to an already delicious meal. My husband's burrito was truly giant! He has a big appetite so we are always pleased when a description says the meal is large and then it actually is! He said he enjoyed the flavor and was actually full (a rarity!).The service was quick and polite. We arrived at the same time as a 6-top, and shortly after we were seated a 10-top came in. Although this almost filled the restaurant the server was still on-point and we never felt we waited any long amount of time at any point through the meal. It was also nice to see that one of the cooks came out from the back to help coordinate and deliver food as it came out. It seemed that even these large tables were served quickly and were enjoying themselves. Even though this is a bit out of the way for me, I would definitely return. Everything was delicious, the atmosphere was so awesome, and the value was great (I believe our bill was around $20-25)."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-tower-grill-nampa?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
