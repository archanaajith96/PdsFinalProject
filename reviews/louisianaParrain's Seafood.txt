Boy was I glad we decided to stop by Parrain's in Baton Rouge this time! I am absolutey enamored by their food that I will actually stop by on the way back to Houston tomorrow to get some more of their creation! The char-grilled oysters were absolutely purrrrfect! The oysters were plum and juicy. The flavoring was on-point! My mouth is watering right now as I think about the taste of those dozen oysters my friend and I shared. We both agreed that we will be getting a dozen each tomorrow! We also had the Pontchartrain, which was a lightly fried fish topped with creamy sauce and crab meat. That was delicious as well, though the creamy sauce makes it a little heavy. I liked that the fish had a little crunch to it! The only thing I thought was average was the mushroom stuffed with crabmeat. The cheese/breadcrumb mixture quite overpowered the crabmeat that I could not taste it at all. Also, I think the crabmeat could have been frozen as there was no \"fresh\" taste to it. But I'm willing to overlook this and just get the oysters when I'm back!"}, {"review_id": "E0NN7Z9H2H6bfsNGJxBuoQ", "user_id": "3GSyaclc2wZq1H3j5rgURg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I had never heard of Eggplant Ponchartrain before, but it may be my new favorite food!This place is excellent, on a scale of 1-10 I give it a 12. The beer was cold and delicious. The service was friendly and helpful. The food was all amazing.We started with the eggplant Ponchartrain and the fried alligator. The alligator was good, the eggplant was life-changing good. Like I might have to move to BR so I can eat here more often. For dinner I had Andouille encrusted fish served over crawfish in a hollandaise caper sauce with garlic mashed potatoes. It was like sweet poetry for your mouth. I got sad when I was full and couldn't finish it all. My friend had shrimp pasta which he liked and my other friend had chargrilled oysters and some dirty rice. I'm not an oyster fan, but they're pretty damned good.Didn't make it to dessert. Will have to return and try again."}, {"review_id": "KMun5k939rqQJwZpDOpY9g", "user_id": "4If6YQ_COUMeDAOW1dCRJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Man these guys know how to make my tummy happy. I started with delicious raw oysters, So fresh I thought they were gonna slap me back. I ordered the Drum fish with the Pontchartrain sauce. Had the garlic mashed potato and garlic green beans on the side. Everything was delicious including the cold Abita beer. Now I know they did not make the beer but they made sure it was ice cold and kept coming. Good job by the attentive server and the skilled cooking staff. Best drum I've ever had. Thank goodness for Lfyt."}, {"review_id": "56mM9YwhFibEeptoQwmnMQ", "user_id": "zn7EMc4RhoK50yGM5sbHQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Forget about Acme; Parrain's is the place to go to get the best chargrilled oysters in Louisiana.  The oysters were delicious, plump and juicy. I loved the additional of the garlic toast with the oysters. We loved the oysters so much that we had to make a pit stop back to Parrain's on our way back from New Orleans to Houston. We also got the seafood gumbo which was flavorful and the crabmeat stuffed mushrooms. The mushrooms were very cheesy but i couldn't taste the crab that much. The pontchartrain was good and I liked the  crisp on the fish. The capers added a nice acidity to the fish. However I felt the blue crab with the pontchartrain wasn't that fresh. Overall, I highly recommend going to Parrain's on your way to/from New Orleans as a pit stop and getting the chargrilled oysters."}, {"review_id": "rV4lpO6fvf5iaAM3Eg8vUg", "user_id": "MpIt0VPKr6b_NbuyNsnA1g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I had the crawfish etoufee because I needed my Cajun fix.

This is a solid choice. The oysters are bite size, and cooked properly with all the delicious cheese and spices. The side Caesar salad was also good. Simple, but the Caesar dressing was delicious! A few croutons, tomatoes, and a sprinkle of cheese is what made up the side salad. I did a To Go order but the food was just as well at home. These two items made me a full (but not uncomfortably so)."}, {"review_id": "BiYO0EZPmXYFe_zWYNScvQ", "user_id": "B1N1R6terH3dL5XdlNMiLg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "Parrain's is located off of Perkins Road, kind of hidden in the back. It's past Trader Joe's and past Acme but before Zippy's. Don't turn too early into Healthremede's parking lot (everyone does), it's the one right after. Parking can sometimes be a struggle, since Parrain's is always busy. The atmosphere has an old, southern, homey feel to it. They have a bar, booths, and tables. Service is always fast and friendly. No matter what, whenever I come here, I have to get the chargrilled oysters. Sometimes, that's all I order. They're that good. Their garlic bread is also amazing. Their seafood is pretty good, but a little pricey for the portion sizes, which is why I'm giving them 4 stars. If you like beer, then Parrain's also has a pretty impressive draft beer selection for a seafood restaurant. Overall, if I am ever craving seafood in Baton Rouge, this is my go-to spot. And if I ever have any guests visiting from out of town, I bring them here."}, {"review_id": "Ac9lei6LWFqPd92ygsq8bw", "user_id": "cUGfK8fjzqSC834H6D5lFQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "We had a local tell us this was the spot to go! When I tell you they were not lying, one of the best seafood places in the state arguably. No seriouslyWhen you come in parking is very weird and tight but if you cannot get a spot in that parking lot when it's peak time there is an establishment right next to it that you might get away with. Just word to the wise.Almost everything on the menu is authentic, fresh and cooked to serve.  I can't make any recommendations as Seafood has a plethora of choices already.I will note that the bathrooms were relatively clean here and anyone with small children should be okay. Be very careful when it comes to the entrance because it can be easily missed and you might end up on the highway and have a 10-minute detour that was only supposed to take 10 seconds. You have been warned!We sat outside and enjoyed the porch like features of the restaurant as well and took a couple of pictures. You could almost have a mini photoshoot if you got a professional crew to follow you.Be ready to wait if you do not have a reservation and on weekends as more and more people find out about this place who don't already know, lines will follow!

It's a great place to bring your family that comes down from another state that want to try some good ole creole food! I always get the  Delacroix which is a grilled fresh gulf fish ( today it was mahi mahi) topped with shrimp in a creole mustard sauce served with garlic mashed potatoes for $17.95 .   My mom and I went for lunch today they always have two different lunch specials for $10. My husbands favorite lunch special is the chicken Florentine sadly they do not offer it on the menu . Today was pork Alfredo and chicken  Delacroix which as usual I got my regular lol with their coleslaw ! I absolutely love their coleslaw . My mom ordered the whole fried catfish plate. We also ordered their onion rings which are huge and come with a delicious dipping sauce similar to Outback's blooming onion dip. I would like to see a better cocktail menu at this place though! They have a bar with drinks just not many cocktail drinks for me I really enjoy the cocktails that are sweet and you can't taste the alcohol but it's in there if you know what I mean? But all in all this place is GREAT!! Service is always great but plan on waiting because there is always a wait at the delicious restaurant but it's worth the wait trust me !"}, {"review_id": "wIbgX1M-K7Fjex341625_A", "user_id": "fwJ6x42jlgo_cOVTdcKCuQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "Talk about good seafood! When we've gone out to eat for southern seafood, we've always gone to chimes or Sammy's. Although those are great options, we had to try somewhere different. Very glad we ate at Parrain's!

But still, it's good.The boudin balls were okay.The seafood dip was addicting.For my entree i just shared some of the andouille crusted Fish with my sister and the fried crawfish/etoufee dish with my SO. Both were delicious!!! If i has to choose one to eat again, I'd go with the fish. It was truly amazing and didn't taste \"fishy\" at all. The etoufee with the fried crawfish tails was good, but it wasn't \"OMG i need to eat it again.\" Overall, i highly enjoyed the meal. Would definitely take my family from out of town here as well.

One of the locals chose Parrain's and it did not disappoint! We waited about 20 minutes for a table and were seated on the patio. It was a really nice day, so that worked out great. I started with a dirty martini and being from Los Angeles, was delighted that it was potent tasty and under 8 dollars! I was the only one who ordered an appetizer and got the crab au gratin. It was served with toast points and was out of this world delicious! For dinner, I ordered another appetizer and got the bacon wrapped bbq shrimp and cole slaw. Both were superb! The shrimp were very tasty, perfectly cooked and served over slices of sweet potato. My dinner makes for a variety of delicious looking entrees, with the most interesting being the special. I would definitely go back. The food and service were great.

Albeit, we had just landed in Baton Rouge after a red eye flight with a connecting stop in Houston and were starving, we thought the food really delicious. I recommend ordering the seafood gumbo. Super rich flavors with lots of seafood included in the soup. Definitely the best gumbo I had my entire trip. I also tried the half a dozen chargrilled oysters which had a more cheesy and salty flavor. Order this if you haven't tried it before.  We ordered half a dozen raw oysters which were more creamy than the ones we're used to on the West coast which are more briny. Also, coming from the Bay Area, the oysters were both affordable and tasty for the size; the oysters were probably 3 inches in length and cost roughly $2 or less depending on if you got chargrilled which are slightly higher in price or the raw oysters. My boyfriend also got the po'boy sandwich with dirty rice on the side. He thought it was pretty tasty although not the best he's had; still something he would order again. Lastly, we added a side of mashed potatoes. It tasted very creamy; just what you would expect out of mashed potatoes although I was a little disappointed that no gravy was included. After eating the rich flavors of the gumbo, the mashed potatoes were more plain on my taste buds. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant! Good, quality seafood and prices.  Note that the restaurant is located in the back of the lot. We were a bit lost trying to find the place after we parked. There's no obvious signage but look for a dark brown, wooden looking building in the back of the lot."}, {"review_id": "dI43ZI-7fJyJKnZYItg6YA", "user_id": "djfHeSApIYQjUv-zEmOUvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Whenever I'm in Baton Rouge this is the only place I will take an Uber to.
