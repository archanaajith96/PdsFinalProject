The service was friendly and relatively quick. It was pretty crowded inside, but we were able to get a large table for our group. I ordered the fried spring rolls and they were so good. I love the dipping sauce. For my entree I ordered the Yellow Curry - with chicken and vegetables. I loved it. I usually always order curry at Thai restaurants and this place didn't disappoint. My mouth is watering right now!"}, {"review_id": "JAc222TMwm3ob_3IZRvU6Q", "user_id": "yfNbF6b0A1u7xjhGIZCyQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "I had dinner at Thep Thai last night and the food was amazing!!I had the green curry with chicken, I asked that the curry be at Tahi hot and this was the first place that actually made the dish spicy for me. The curry had great flavor and it portion size was large. The atmosphere of Thep Thai is a little unique, the restaurant is located in an old burger restaurant but the employees make you feel right at home.Thep thai has made it into my top 3 of Thai restaurants in NWA. I highly Recommend this place to anyone and everyone."}, {"review_id": "iZg3b4NKmZDgu--sKAVApw", "user_id": "S2h7RSsYxhohFvzfk-QcHg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "First time visiting this Thai restaurant south of downtown Fayetteville on old 71 business and state highway 16. I was pleasantly surprised at the updated furnishings and open atmosphere with lots of light. I Ordered # 16 Pad Khing ( stir fried with gingers, green onions, tomatoes, bell peppers, and black mushrooms). $9.50Also ordered the crab Rangoon as an appetizer. Crab cane out rather quickly, thank goodness, as we were hungry!The main course took a while longer and came out very staggered for our table of 8. Overall food was good, fresh but nothing that was special or unique to them."}, {"review_id": "9N1FKoky2Exer0KrGZemGg", "user_id": "WZZZsGdz7ZcJPjPySdDPlw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Delicious food. Prompt service, sturdy tables, good water, nice scenery, patio seating. I think it's authentic! Definitely a 5 star experience. The restrooms are accessible from the outside and could use some updating. Pee before you come! The outdoor garden and pond are beautiful. The food is enhanced by fresh herbs!"}, {"review_id": "jjHF92Dg6rAMgqFOjbZNeg", "user_id": "oLUXITeC0tg2ue4TcqYrAw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Fantastic.  The food is authentic and flavorFUL!! We tried several different appetizers and one of the soups.  I apologize but without the menu in front of me, I can't be more specific.  My husband and son both got chicken pad thai and it was just super tasty.  My daughter-in-law got shrimp fried rice.  I got a traditional curry dish with coconut milk, red curry paste, carrots, potatoes, pineapple and cashews. I got beef which is probably my only complaint.  I loved the dish but did not care for the way the beef was cooked.  It was a little tough.  All in all, we loved the atmosphere.  The service was good.  The food was well priced for the portions.  We will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "bcYzNYTlKTjRohu2k6n3Lg", "user_id": "Pq-cTaK_eocg03_9YZ0pcQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "This place is worth the drive to the south end of Fayetteville. Cozy little place with a large variety to choose from on the menu. Tonight a group of us got together for dinner and everyone seemed to enjoy their choices. I particularly enjoyed the noodle dish I ordered. I cannot remember the name but it was #32 medium spicy. Fresh veggies, flavorful chicken, perfectly cooked noodles with a very light sauce. I would order this menu item again on purpose. ;)"}, {"review_id": "7jeuiBMkvbpQ17aWpVmHQw", "user_id": "YI_MDWz03G1PkGpNVpESVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "Best Thai so far in NWAHave eaten here more than just about any other restaurant in this corner of AR. Is it perfect, nope. But, the service is friendly. The food is good. The atmosphere is better than most a little bit of tiki room vibe going on. The prices are fair. Room for improvement: Getting food out at the same time when there are more than two people in a party. Restrooms need updating and a little paint etc other places would be great. Favorite: eating out by the ponds when it's warm out and watching and listening to the frogs."}, {"review_id": "0L_GXVGxz--e2wdYFScB7A", "user_id": "aGsaJlDdeDC1ovBbaLQzVg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "If you like hot 2 is a good number of hot here.

Yes, it's cheaper than most places, but the food is horrible. I love coconut soup and I have tried numbers of places, this place makes the worst coconut soup (it taste like pure tomato soup with onions). The duck isn't that good either, and everything comes with a tiny portion that barely feeds me or my husband."}, {"review_id": "RIajlsOa6SIVvBygThCVUg", "user_id": "kNwv8YCDk5kUq1p_tfVc8w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I ordered the green curry and specifically asked for 1 star spicy (not very spicy). The food came out and it was so spicy I couldn't even eat it. I asked for a new dish or to just get it taken off the bill and they refused to accommodate. The manager laughed in our faces and was extremely rude she acted like we were incompetent. They made me pay for a dish I didn't even touch. DO NOT GO HERE. There are plenty of other thai places in the area."}, {"review_id": "Iyu_Z5ZUoSZsaSMRQlBgKg", "user_id": "QPVfpfPZRXp4nZcCGLbj3Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/30/2017", "text": "I love this place, but I expect great service every time I go to a restaurant. Last night I called in for a pick up at 6:45. The guy told me it would take 20-30 minutes. Which, ok that's not bad. So I waited until 7, drove over there, expected I would wait for maybe 10-15 minutes. Not a big deal. I waited for over an hour from the time I got there for my food!The guy did say they were busy but I did not expect to be waiting that long. Several other people were waiting for their food as well as the people who came to sit in the restaurant. One girl at a table said she had been waiting for an hour and a half and did not have her food yet. I understand not every day is a good one, but if I am having to wait that long for my food, someone should've told me it would've been a longer wait. And they should have given something as compensation for my time, and every one else's. One guy was so upset after waiting only thirty minutes that he complained and they gave him his money back. Every one law should've been shown the same treatment.When I finally got my food and took it home, it was cold and the egg rolls were doused in grease, we didn't even eat them because they were basically wet with grease. Other than last night, every time I have gone to get food here it has been very good. But like I said, I expect great service every time I go to a restaurant."}, {"review_id": "Hn-8KS9bHO-RjryIH92UHA", "user_id": "q1tg4-cLJWcy3HTEn9NlGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2016", "text": "Went for lunch on a weekday with several co-workers. Food was fast and very good. I had the yellow curry and asked for medium hot. It was spicy and I would not have wanted it any spicier. The lunch specials come with an eggroll and soup. Service was friendly, our drinks were refilled. *You should know:   you pay at the register and that's where the sign is posted that they only accept debit/credit cards for amounts over $10. So if you don't have cash....I'm not sure what happens. I know there's a charge for businesses to run cards, but it's a butt clench moment to see this. One remedy is just to put a tip on the card and make it $10, which is what some of us did."}, {"review_id": "R6B0m4YSDWlw-XVK1bwYKw", "user_id": "fH1TQZe9hAK3xiV8TQpIEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "So delicious!!!

But this was disgusting and inedible. The beef was rubbery and flavorless and the sauce was just really runny. I couldn't even eat it. I will never return nor recommend anyone to eat there.
