Our server was incredibly knowledgeable and guided us through the menu since it was our first time there. And the food was absolutely delicious! We came in on a Saturday for lunch and the place was fairly empty which was a good thing as it's fairly small on the inside. We ordered the vegetable samosas appetizer and then the chicken tikka masala and lamb korma for our entrees along with garlic naan. Everything was amazing and we will definitely be coming back soon to try out other items!An added bonus: rice comes with all entrees and you don't have to purchase it separately. And they will give you more rice for free if you ask for additional. Love it!"}, {"review_id": "NM5jZ_kDc4ks68LPxRweXQ", "user_id": "JN4z7pbHwtMcE1cqfNs74Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Small restaurant, but a GREAT place to get some Indian food. We had wonderful service from Marquis! The food was good, fast, hot. Prices were moderate, however naan is not included with meal. $2The place could use a little wall to separate the door from the dining room to make it a bit more cozy and I think that would really enhance the place. The place is cold due to the storefront windows along the front. The bar is nice. Happy hour specials are from 4-6pm"}, {"review_id": "IKOIvLnp7GqsacgSQSM-Yw", "user_id": "B7OpNMDq1l4YX4vuSsdnCg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "This place is to die for. We recently moved and were trying to find our new go to spot for Indian food. Our friend bought us here and we are obsessed. There kabobs are sooo delicious and moist. Veggie samosas are great and all of their curries that we have tried thus far as so flavorful. Recently tried their bullet naan which was soo spicy and yummy. They actually make things spicy when you ask as well so be careful when ordering things that way! This place is a must try, service is great, the chef is awesome. Have not had to wait to be seated although it is always busy when we've gone.I also think they may be expanding!"}, {"review_id": "0JzD6FBJSE9HWgOdwubp8Q", "user_id": "0fmYjn804ex7Yy5hkI6Drw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/8/2017", "text": "Environment is clean and new feeling.Food is delicious.Service is friendly and accommodating.For an appetizer we had the mini samosas with a masala sauce and it was very flavorful.  Then I had garlic butter naan with chicken tikka masala and that was another hit!Also had the chai tea which my sister really enjoyed, but wasn't the best I've ever had.They were able to fit our group of 7 adults which was nice considering they didn't have a ton of tables.  Everyone had a good time and it was a good space to catch up and chat."}, {"review_id": "I0vnmHNhPRhpGDfYGSt_Kw", "user_id": "ZJD_cxubUWI-_BFw6J75CA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "We started off with the mini samosas and they are  A M A Z I N G.

We came here for lunch today, and I could come back every day, especially if Jose is working. He took such good care of us, and I was super impressed with the extra rice for our leftovers as well as the piece of foil to wrap the leftover naan in. The he came back and bagged it for us! We both had lamb, I had korma and he had curry. Both were delicious! We also got a garlic naan each which was probably a little too much for normal people, but we love naan. Can't wait to come back here and see if they deliver to our house!"}, {"review_id": "vtz5UFCXLFp4KZjRkw_ruw", "user_id": "8iLDQ--QvtbnSh_Ki8KPbQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "Such a delicious Indian food spot in Parker.

The quality of their food is to die for. After having lived in the UK for several years, and experienced the superior quality and choice in Indian cuisine over there, I was worried when I moved to Colorado that I wouldn't find something comparable. My experience at Monsoon quickly resolved that concern. I'm a regular customer at Monsoon; each and every dish I've tried there has been incredible. The customer service is also excellent.The reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is that the facility itself is far to small and cramped. As a result, the ambiance isn't what it could be. Also, the prices are a little higher than I think they should be.

These are a little intense; therefore we serve them with a side of our creamy cucumber yogurt sauce.\"  Unfortunately, I didn't read this and we didn't ask for the cucumber yoghurt sauce which probably would have helped.  Also, I would have had to drink less tea!!) Since my mouth was burning even after two glasses of tea, I decided some Kheer was needed for dessert.  The sweet, creamy Basmati rice pudding was sprinkled with almonds, pistachios, and coconut and was perfect for cooling off after the fiery Vindaloo.  But I was STUFFED!In closing, I look forward to visiting here again whenever we are in the area.  So often, restaurants water-down or modify their recipes to suit the local expectations.  Monsoon stays authetic - no wonder they have such great ratings!!"}, {"review_id": "T_ocr3nG5SW6aTJHeC9FmQ", "user_id": "FxelGtZbRvWZzSQLGq7pzg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "I had chicken vindaloo and  garlic naan and spicy chicken wings!
