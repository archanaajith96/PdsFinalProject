AWESOME! And I could schedule when I could pick it up! I come from Peabody, and I pick up food and eat right before work so I can stave off hunger as long as possible for my 12-hour shift.First off, the restaurant is clean and sleek, very modern and simple interior. The staff had my order ready to go.I ordered the gyro with a salad and stuffed grape leaves. The gyro had lamb and beef souvlaki. I also like being able to pick what I want for the sandwich. The souvlaki was excellent and tender, the pita bread fresh, and well complimented with what I picked for fillings. The stuffed grape leaves were quite delicious and delicate. The salad, I was most impressed. The veggies were fresh and of great quality. I hate cucumber, and the cucumbers were tolerable in this (hey I said I hate cucumber, the fact that I ate them says something) and the dressing was a fantastic Greek dressing.If you're sick of all the generic fast food and Italian/sub restaurants, this is a wonder change of pace and I plan on stopping in here again."}, {"review_id": "s-1rxxz7mZ-93bA01fUk5Q", "user_id": "rkcU-Z-nt8Oyr8NUwuo2Mg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We went to Maza after bookmarking it for a long time. Normally we are never in that area but fortunately we were going to Nashua for meeting someone who was right across from Maza. Decided to get some dinner before meeting with my buddy.Maza is typical order yourself food cafeteria style. Salads , wraps and dinner plates are your most typical choices. you can get a dinner plate with 3 sides ( even rice is considered a side here whereas rice normally is default and then sides are added) so i got the Chicken Schwarma plate with Bulgar and lentils , khus khus salad and Red pepper hummus. Also got a side of Lamb kofte kebab which was like $4 extra. Wifey got a falafel plate with fatuous salad , pickled turnips and tabbouleh.Overall food taste was pretty good nothing extra ordinary but good and fresh. Except for Chicken Schwarma which was dry, too much of cinnamon and nutmeg and no other taste.  Lamb kofte kebab was good. Their house made hot sauce was also really good. Falafels were good as well, fried perfectly where crunchy outside and soft inside without being too dry as falafel tends to be at some places. Khus Khus salad was a little bland could taste the dressing in it but very little.  Red pepper hummus was also good. Overall a great place to go to but Chicken Schwarma needs improvement for sure . The food prices are pretty decent for the value and quantity. Hopefully next time i will try the chicken kebab which were being grilled to order."}, {"review_id": "7J6j5EYHud2xnrtZCYPIVA", "user_id": "lMaSZ7K7iU_Xi2aWkmDDUw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "I had the chicken shwarma with roasted vegetables, spicy eggplant and lentils.  I was really excited about this meal b/c of the reviews, but wow what a disappointment! The chicken was so overcooked and dry it cut up the roof of my mouth!  The lentils were like eating pebbles, every bite I was pulling a piece of overcooked chicken or a hard (undercooked) lentil out of my mouth. The Maza sampler was the winner of the day.  They added sliced (american, jarred) pickles to what was an awesome sampler of 2 Hummus flavors, baba ghannouj (sp?), tabbouleh and pickled turnips w/pita bread was a 5 star dish, but the pickles I really have to question."}, {"review_id": "D73XoKBoVGKOG1olOFb67g", "user_id": "rsEtz1lW_099t-0IV5dOGg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Legit, authentic, delicious and fresh.

This was by no means even close to my family's cooking, but it is the best I've had in a restaurant in the United States.Maza is located in a strip mall off of Daniel Webster Highway and it is very easy to miss; even with the GPS we had a hard time finding it. When we finally parking and walked inside, we were greeted by two very friendly employees who explained the menu to me.I ordered a falafel plate with lentils, stuffed grape leaves (vegetarian), and Greek salad. You also get a choice of white or whole wheat pita that they make in-house. SO GOOD. The portions here are absolutely insane and I was only able to eat half of this before I felt like I was going to explode.Falafel- I got six giant falafel and they were, again, the best I've had from a restaurant in the United States. Firstly, they were fried fresh for me as I waited and even when I got back and set up my takeout to eat, they were still piping hot. They were perfectly crispy on the outside and seasoned and moist on the inside. Delicious. I wished my stomach was bigger so I could have eaten all of them.Lentil- SO good. Anytime I have ever gotten lentil out, they were served as a mushy mess with a consistency similar to baby food. These were perfectly cooked- soft, but still solid enough to feel like a solid and seasoned to perfection.Greek Salad- Light and refreshing! All of the ingredients tasted fresh and especially good after the heavy falafel and lentils.Stuffed Grape Leaves- These were my least favorite of the order. Were they the worst I've ever had? No, but after such greatness, I was expecting better. These were kind of bland and lacked the complex flavors that everything else had. The prices are cheap, the employees are so nice, and the food is delicious. Nashua is lucky to have such a great, authentic Mediterranean spot. They would make a killing in Boston!"}, {"review_id": "vGUCsrC45LGWu-L_Lpcoag", "user_id": "G9bWCQHZHgHf3ZugJWtZCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The best place in Nashua!

Now lets talk food. Bread was fresh baked right in front of you.The meats on the spit were chicken which looked like there was none left not a good sign when entering a middle eastern place. The lamb gyro was what I went for and you get to pick one side and if you want extra it's an additional $1.49 which is not a bad deal at all.  The sides were mac and cheese, white rice, brown, or lentil with rice, veggies, chick pea salad that looked good, couscous with feta and greek olives was awesome, hummus  and baba ganoosh were fresh. The tabouli was awful and the cracked wheat that was in it was hard, felt like sand in my mouth. Grape leaves were small and just filled with too  much rice, order at the counter pay and than eat, everything was served on real plates I liked that part. Will I be back I doubt it but was glad to check it out.

I had the Chicken Kabob dish with two sides of stuffed grape leaves, and a Tabouleh salad. The chicken itself was charbroiled to the right temperature. You could taste the grill on the meat it was juicy and not too greasy. My two side dishes were fresh but slightly bland but I could still taste all the seasoning in each.     Because the entrees are very high quality and prices are so inclusive,  a penny pinching student or a person falling on hard times can also come here once in a while. Another unique factor is people on a diet do not have to feel like they are cheating when they eat here.

The falafel, kofta, and stuffed kibbeh were all delicious and the sides, as people have said, were very generous and tasted fresh, even though I've only visited very near the end of the day prior to their closing. It is very much a needed addition to the area, especially if you're vegetarian or trying to eat a little healthier; all of the sides that they had available when I have gone (minus the mac and cheese) were vegetarian. Pita was good, maybe a little dry but definitely freshly made that day considering I've only eaten there at closing time. It's probably a good idea that I don't live closer or I'd be eating here all the time and going broke. Staff was friendly and accommodating to our requests for customizing our food a bit and they said goodbye as we left.
