It's all right here! How about a breakfast quesadilla with green chili? A giant pecan cinnamon roll on the side? A serving of pecan pancakes? I rest my case.Ordering is simple. Study the menu board and step up to the counter. Take an identifying giant playing card and they'll deliver the food to your table. Don't worry. They roam the dining room frequently refilling coffee and attending to other needs. All the essentials! The dining room is small and basic, a little cramped in spots, but it can accommodate parties of many different sizes.A spot intended for locals that is perfect for any visitor to Las Cruces who wants to sample a little local flavor. Inexpensively!"}, {"review_id": "2rxy4KWiOyyWZ75bpL70PA", "user_id": "9pTgzVQjZSt8pKvkUSHOlw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Stopped in on the way to Texas.

If that's not really your thing then leave this one for the locals who grew up coming here and have adapted the taste as decent. W ordered several dishes so this review isn't based on just one dish. Nothing was worth going back for. The service was super slow as well. Either that's the norm or we were stopping the flow of things because between our table we had 4 races. And the way the whole restaurant was looking at as was like they had never seen different races before. Boo! (They all jumped lmfao) along with all the stares and people looking like we were aliens, the food not so tasty, the slow service etc. I think we would happily go somewhere else next time."}, {"review_id": "Qk0gEJYRrMA2L5E_89OMTA", "user_id": "NP0f5cWGGGteUJ5vUmPMxg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "10/1/2016", "text": "So slow in everything.  Why does it take so long to place order? It is not a five dish course or something. The restaurant owner needs to reexamine how to train the employees in terms of efficiently taking orders and processing them. There is no reason to put customers on waiting unnecessarily. I decided that this restaurant is not worth returning for future breakfast or brunch. Hey owner or manager, Create  sample questions for the employee who take orders to use, so the process will be streamlined. Or prepare a device or system that will reduce he wait. That is good for the business as well because it will increase the productivity. Food wise, it is average at best. I regret that I wasted my 20 minutes for this kind of mediocre breakfast."}, {"review_id": "aI5VcRpeM472m2XVCU5N2w", "user_id": "iVJREJVhSTy3P1T2AUvM4A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/17/2017", "text": "My family and I tried this place because we were on our way back to Texas from Arizona. One thing everyone from New Mexico tells me is to try the Mexican food so we did. It was okay. I had the veggie burrito with home fries topped with green chili sauce. The dish was bland and the egg was over cooked. The bell peppers in my burrito were completely raw which was a let down. I will say that the green chili sauce was delicious and my husband's dish was also delicious. He had the carne adovada plate."}, {"review_id": "4s6lr3iJxxhKHiDfgis72g", "user_id": "bYL9p0AbG-SRzx9VNjaOgQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/5/2016", "text": "This used to be a reliable place for a good meal. Today's visit fell flat, though, and had me thinking I won't be back anytime soon. The good: when I asked staff about gluten-containing ingredients, they knew right away and gave me good information. Service is friendly and we were checked on often. The meh: I had a fiesta chicken salad, and the spring mix was slimy. So not appetizing. I tried to pick out the slimy bits of lettuce but eventually just gave up. That shouldn't have been served. To be fair, I haven't really been in for lunch before today, so breakfast may still be a safe bet. FYI, the green chile sauce has gluten and so so the beans for some reason."}, {"review_id": "7wo-og4tFNgM8JU_XApqHA", "user_id": "0AexCKl-j88LmcKvyuIg3g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/15/2017", "text": "Food was great and the staff was very kind.

Bummer. Or so I thought.Enter Mesilla Valley Kitchen. It popped up under a listing for Breakfast Burritos and I knew my husband would be a happy camper if they were as good as some claimed. They were. He ordered the Breakfast Burrito with Christmas (red and green together) sauce, and my 14 year old son ordered the Chorizo Breakfast Burrito with the same Christmas option. My husband loved the sauce so much, though he preferred the green (we don't get it enough in SA), and my son loved his, though he claimed defeat and my husband somehow finished it off? I have no idea how he did that but he didn't regret it. Stomach of steel, that one. I ordered the MVK potatoes covered in cheese, green chilies, bacon and sausage, and topped with two eggs, which was served with a large tortilla so I essentially got a deconstructed burrito. It was perfect, not too much of any one thing, but balanced out well with the perfectly spiced green sauce. The eggs were ordered over easy and I highly recommend the addition of them. For the 3 year old we ordered the Pecan Pancakes, but it turned out she had decided to not like nuts that day. She loved them every other day but such is the way of the toddler. The rest of the family ate the pancakes in an admirable group effort, but we failed to complete the mission. It was 3 pancakes, though, and we probably should have ordered her 2 but we were STARVING when we ordered. No judgment, people. We were grouchy, hungry folk. But we were cheered before we even got our food. The customer service was outstanding. Friendly conversation at the counter that was entertaining and informative with any questions answered promptly and with charm. I wish I had thought to catch his name but he was working Monday, October 3rd and was very nice to a tired family so we appreciated him. The table service was quick and the food came out quicker. The only change I would make is that it was a bit unclear to us if we should seat ourselves and order at the counter, or if someone would seat us and then we would order. But I have zero complaints about the time we spent at Mesilla Valley Kitchen. We will definitely return on future trips and highly recommend their tasty food and excellent customer service."}, {"review_id": "4zFGKAAiaFyX7c0gkcC9aA", "user_id": "0o65EyeWqMrieQ3uZLoxMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/20/2016", "text": "Always an amazing food experience that overwhelms all other factors.  The place is a sunny, comfortable breakfast environment.  The service is prompt and friendly.  Make sure to try the smothered breakfast burrito.

The coffee is topped off before you get to half a cup. This is the only place in Las Cruces where the red chile is to my liking.

This place is magical, I swear. After my sister moved to Las Cruces, I told her I wanted the most authentic Mexican food we could find in town, and we landed here. If you haven't been inside, don't expect much in terms of decor or atmosphere. This is a dive with okay service but the food is what keeps me coming back. Now, I always get the same thing, the green chile Breakfast burrito. Man. I am salivating just thinking about it. I've tried several other burritos here as well, but this one takes the cake for me. One plate is huge, so if you're not that hungry you can definitely share. Also, I highly recommend takeout if you're considering it. We have definitely had takeout and it was separated well and wasn't gross or mushy at all (as I had originally thought it may be). When we do eat in the restaurant, I always know it will probably be a wait during peak hours. Just be prepared--- if they have a long line when you're ordering, it might take a half hour to get your food. IT'S WORTH IT. Also, their chips & salsa doesn't include normal tortilla chips. They are basic fried thin chips (think like lays). I will continue to return to this joint--- could NOT be more satisfied with this place. Pro tip: call ahead and make sure their credit card machine is working. Hasn't been working the last 2 times I came in."}, {"review_id": "rnyveQiBYc87tBPuZ9FJQA", "user_id": "3Tn532bsEj5LFWTN3xwc5g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2017", "text": "HJ Hatch burrito for a bit of authenticity.
