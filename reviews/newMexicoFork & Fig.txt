(Well, after all, we WERE in Albuquerque. Getting green chiles on damn near everything is almost de rigueur.)We also split a (large and beautiful) chopped salad.We were both pleasantly surprised with the restaurant's reasonable prices. (Hey. I'm of Scottish descent, and tighter than a tick. I like reasonable prices VERY much, mmmmkay?)I definitely want to return to this place on our next trip west to New Mexico!"}, {"review_id": "Su4lruaVKW_uX1miQiuv7Q", "user_id": "G36RExBQC9NjVVxdBTyPAQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "This was your first time at this establishment . We were very surprised not just by Fork and Fig but by the great atmosphere and the other businesses in this food and drink compound. We started our evening by ordering beers from Broken Trail Brewery.  We sat in the Broken Trail Brewery area(in the shade)You have to sit in the fenced in area with your   Drinks but can still order from Fork and Fig. I had the Ruben Sammy with grilled zucchini.  The Ruben was very flavorful with all that makes up this sandwich,this is not your typical Ruben.  This one comes with both pastrami and shredded pork, green chili slaw, sauerkraut, Swiss, Russian dressing on marbled rye.  Great tasting sandwich.  The rest of our group ordered the :Ribeye wrap with smashed fingerlings Citrus Salad with chicken breast and Brisket Cemitas with smashed fingerlings. Good food + good beer+ good service + atmosphere makes for a wonderful evening.  I know we will be going back to this compound."}, {"review_id": "yjCqMib06RKDHtnaBWPSBg", "user_id": "5C3__urpogYGMbaj3GGmeg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Amazing place for lunch. Came here with two of my tour mates and we walked over from the Hyatt in Uptown. We saw it was highly rated so we wanted to give it a shot. Super easy to find, and it's in a really fun plaza next to a distillery - there's outdoor seating between Here and there so it's a really nice place to hangout! Inside: not a ton of seating so don't bring huge groups here (4max I'd recommend). Very intimate and also very cool to see the food being prepared very close to you. Very impressive array of sauces and options that you can see. Food: AMAZING. I lived in ABQ for a few years so I tested a lot of the restaurants; had never been here though. Safe to say some of the most memorable flavors I've experienced in this town. Amazing flavor in the green Chile soup, and the brisket sandwich was incredibly flavorful. Nice blend of textures as well. The bread was very fresh and perfect for the sandwiches. Apparently they're famous for the burgers here as the manager told us so I can only imagine how good they must be ;) HIGHLY recommend this place. Hands down one of the best places in ABQ."}, {"review_id": "5TZasknyEXKlIAiwAbvbeA", "user_id": "RsIBwaU0srby1ANQAjFjqw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Their side dishes are amazing but the sandwiches are delusional. I didn't know you can make root vegetables and Brussel sprouts taste so good! I also had the crabster wrap and it gets a handout of two stars from me because it was at least edible. With every bite, I was cheering for it to get better but it didn't. The description in the menu was amazing but when I received it, I was catfished, bamboozled and led astray. I would return off the strength of their sides, salads and sweet customer service.  Our waiter was also amazing."}, {"review_id": "bevklL26yRiVyBcP3V1I9A", "user_id": "gFh-KwZQ7SwuOKcUVvEW3A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "If I had to recommended an eclectic restaurant, this would be one!

We dined alfresco for lunch today and were extremely impressed with their lunch. My husband chose the ribeye wrap with pasta salad and I had the Fig burger with the Brussel sprouts. My son had a kids burger with smashed fingerlings. We all said the food was fantastic. The pasta salad was fresh and the basalmic drizzle was the perfect touch. The fig jam on my burger elevated the flavors and made it the best burger I have ever had. The waiter was 5 stars too. He was attentive and kind and helpful. We will eat here and often.

He searched his mighty yelp app in a fit of hunger and found a place named fork and fig, which sounded interesting but off topic. Despite the odd sounding name, the man ventured to the place of figs and forks to find little wait and an empty table waiting just for him. He ordered the green Chile burger with a side of root vegetables and he was pleasantly surprised by the delicious flavors that filled his palate. His drink would never get to a level of unpleasantness as waiters would constantly check upon him. Although Fork and Fig was small on the interior, the food was enough to make the man want to return here again when hunger struck. He quickly told others of his good find."}, {"review_id": "OW5AeNBV4eQmtGvVydEkkg", "user_id": "zRberopK8MjdtkJzOSHdrw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "That farm to table feel that Albuquerque loves, in the heart of the city.

Luckily for me, this place was right across the street from my hotel, Sheraton Uptown. Fork & Fig is a must-try if you're looking for a delicious, light lunch. Prices are fair, the menu is simple yet still fun, and there's no doubt that everyone in your group will find something tasty to eat. There's sandwiches, wraps, burgers, and salads. Everything (with the exception of the salads) comes with your choice of a side. Service was pretty swift, considering there were 35+ people from my conference trying to dine here during our lunch break. I ate here probably 2-3 times during my 5 day trip. Everything I tried tasted fantastic. I particularly enjoyed my chicken pesto sandwich on a soft ciabatta roll ($12). The sandwich was well balanced and the pesto wasn't overly greasy. I also highly recommend getting their cojita corn for your side. I've never seen anything similar to it in the Pacific Northwest or Hawaii. I think it might be a New Mexico speciality, which is another reason to try it if you're an out of towner. The cojita corn was smothered with a bunch of cojita cheese and a mild sour cream-like sauce with a touch of paprika on the top. So tasty. Everyone I dined with also had great things to say about their food and sides. Fork & Fig is seriously excellent and I love that everything I tried on their menu sounds, looks, and tastes delicious."}, {"review_id": "zA0tOlclM2Yktsv8UTiDvg", "user_id": "0BuGNvEvcT_faI0dI8tKqg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/8/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Food was absolutely amazing.

I'm always hesitant to try seafood and places that aren't all about seafood, but the \"crobster\" here is to die for. So much flavor and the crab and lobster is cooked and seasoned so well! There is delicious aioli inside, as well as crispy onions for texture. The service was fast and our waiter was super friendly!

The food was delicious. I'm guessing that when the weather is nicer, they are able to accommodate more patrons, however, with the wind and cold today, people were electing to only eat indoors. The indoor space is very lovely, but very quaint. Loved the giant metal fork on our table, it was a hilarious conversation starter. Both my father and I ordered The Fig Burg- his with bun, crispy onions, and cheese, mine without. My mother opted for a Citrus Salad and the Soup de Jour- which was a loaded green Chile French onion. Everything was exceptional! Instead of fries their sides included Brussels sprouts- so of course I had to try them! Sweet, crispy and bacony deliciousness! My father opted for the root vegetable hash, which was equally as delicious and very colorful. I look forward to trying more of their menu items."}, {"review_id": "udSJCXkxpNosnXWHau-Ftg", "user_id": "bvZ85FpReKm4OxUQRtncnw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "I loved this place from the moment I walked in. It is not a large restaurant, which clearly shows in the fact that the staff is able to cater more closely to each customer. Immediately upon looking at the menu, I realized that I could order anything and would probably be happy, it all sounded so delicious. I orderd the NM Reuben with a side of herb fingerling potatoes. The Reuben was decent but not amazing, it was not much different than a normal Reuben with the exception of green chile (which, naturally, makes in New Mexican), and it was a bit overpowered by the bread and meat alone. The potatoes may have been the best I've ever tasted, they were excellent!!"}, {"review_id": "fUTTjrQ-RUrp3fFJZbxoXg", "user_id": "Q0LSoxx-Z8-wHYI0t5Iegw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "I've only been once, so this review may need an update later. The place was pretty cool. They were busy and seemed like they could use at least 1 more person to handle the flow of customers, ordering, bussing, etc. It was a little slow. The burger: I had the green chile one with the egg. It was darn good. The now defunct Pete's Frites ruined me with the best burger I have ever had anywhere, but Fork & Fig was possibly within reach of its greatness. Meat quality was excellent. What they really need to improve (as in remove) is the kale. What the heck is kale doing on a burger?! It imparted nothing but toughness. No flavor. Crunch is already there with any other green. Just a horrible choice. Nutrition? Who orders a burger and things about nutrition, especially with a fried egg on it? Forget the kale, put some other lettuce on it, and you might have a real champion with this burger. I'll be back to try the many other delicious-sounding items."}, {"review_id": "ELGAU4YKXavdstXjgmV8jQ", "user_id": "hc5UpC8rrrG44x2Ejisqsw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "A small eclectic restaurant.

The corn was tasty with cheese & spices. The thing separating this eatery from others is both a plus and negative. Its small, with about 12 tables, seating at the counter and some tables outside.

The burger was blackened, plus topped with green chile, and maybe something else spicy. Either way, if you order this, just go ahead & ask to double fist your drink.
