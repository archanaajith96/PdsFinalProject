It's perfect for casual dinners, reasonably priced, huge portions, and totally relaxed atmosphere. The food is good food, standard Thai dishes done well. A reliable place for Thai, imho. The noodles, stir fried veggies, as well as fried string beans and curry puffs were all good. We had plenty of leftovers to take home. Portions here are huge. (The place is popular with college students, maybe that's why). The service was very good. Stayed on top of our water. The chef is also the owner. The food made here is thought out, and the chef cared about how the dishes are made. The place is very easy on substitutions and even cater to allergies according to the owner. Also,  they consider the protein an add-on so you can pick what you want to eat. All in all, a good reliable Thai restaurant."}, {"review_id": "oMj9kSbPfwNaBdau51BOuQ", "user_id": "yjji9ryb2A8QHmn_dOLoJA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/9/2017", "text": "I have been to King and I Thai Kitchen a few times and this is by far my favorite Thai restaurant around the Hartford downtown - West Hartford area. Flavor wise, this is a much better place than the others around.The seating is a little limited comparing to the other restaurants and parking can get a little clumsy too, but the food makes up for it. The staff are very friendly and you pretty much seat yourself as you get in.  My favorite dishes on here are the seafood drunken noodles, the Thai curry with chicken and the spring rolls for the appetizer. The flavor of the food is my favorite and definitely my go to Thai place if I am around here. I'd definitely recommend this place for Thai food lovers."}, {"review_id": "WUjrC3FHwngr0RDXhVvajw", "user_id": "9hAxTkGGJpSX0QaBZZ5jWg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Wandering around Park Street I finally settled on the King and I Thai Kitchen.

I chose the pork from my Protane and they added Chinese broccoli they definitely did not let me down. I chose the pork from my protein and they added Chinese broccoli.

Not only is it set way back from the street at the end of a parking lot, but it doesn't even look like a restaurant.  It looks like a two-family house.We climbed the steps onto the front porch and walked in to see a big family with kids having lunch there. The interior is very pretty with two-toned walls with lots of artwork, Oriental themed touches everywhere, white tablecloths on the tables, and Oriental rugs on the floor.We had lunch and ordered a Silver Salad ($9.95) and a Jungle Curry with Seafood ($13.95). Both dishes were superb.The salad was a beautiful plate of ground chicken, shrimp, silver noodles, onions, carrots, peanuts, cilantro and mint. The shrimps were pretty big, the sauced noodles tasted great, and the quantity was generous. One very nice touch was the origami-like bird made out of a carrot that graced the plate (see photo). Jungle Curry differed from the other five curries on the menu because it is prepared without coconut milk. But it had a ton of flavor from the Thai curry paste, eggplant, string beans, carrots, broccoli, napa, and basil, and plenty of heat (I ordered it a \"4\" on the heat scale).  It was terrific, with plenty of squid, shrimp, and the biggest scallop I have ever seen. I have to mention how delicious the purple eggplant was too.Overall, the menu of Thai and Laotian dishes is wonderful, with ten appetizers, four soups, four noodle dishes with various protein options and lunch/dinner prices, eight salads, four fried rices with the same protein/lunch/dinner choices, nine main dish meat seafood options, seven duck or salmon entrees, six red snapper dishes, six curries, three Laotian dishes, and seventeen specialties. Desserts are covered with fried bananas and mango with coconut sticky rice.We found the service to be very good, and I was impressed with how one of the servers handles a question from a young dining customer who asked what Pad See Ew was. He gave the young man his full attention and told him it was a noodle dish, \"like lo mein but with flat noodles\". We took home half of our $25 lunch for tomorrow, and left with the knowledge that we had just visited a very special place."}, {"review_id": "HzSw0CvdK1mzgKzqG7yJEg", "user_id": "OVF9mZMBUEFPY2I-lLzkgA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/5/2017", "text": "Back when I lived in CT, King and I Thai was my joint for this tasty, aromatic Southeast Asian cuisine. The location is funky, taking up the first floor of a house that you can't easily spot while cruising on Park Street. Once you go inside, the interior sort of matches whatever expectations you had seeing the place from the outside. It's cozy in that Asian mom-and-pop way (sort of dated décor and tight in space) and sets the tone for what's to come.Service is always friendly and efficient. You don't come here for a romantic date because the ambiance isn't really there, but you take someone to dine with you at King and I to enjoy fresh, lively Thai food. My go-to choices were basil leaves with beef, massamun curry with chicken, pad see ew with beef, chicken satay, and to finish the meal, the classic sweet mango with coconut sticky rice.If you are in the area, give these kind people your business. You'll discover a place that will likely enter your dining rotation. I'm hoping on a future trip home to CT, I can take AT to check out this place.[#Yelp365: 32/365]"}, {"review_id": "qqE7-L3CaPr2nfzdm-mFpg", "user_id": "pp9p5R5kExRquLqdy3lgVg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/12/2017", "text": "As others mentioned this place is a little whole in the wall.

Location's not that great although they do have a small parking space.Got take out and ordered 20-25 mins before, went to pick up the food at the mentioned time and got the food in 5 mins. Got a call 10 mins later saying they gave the wrong package.When I got back there, they took back the package and said that my order will take another 15 to 20 minutes. Not sure why they didn't start the order until 45 minutes later. And then they argued saying that they can't skip the line just for us..Got the food ten mins later. There was a hair in the drunken noodles but the rest of the food was good. It is a byob place.Overall I agree that mistakes happen but their customer service sucks in spite of good food.

It's an easy restaurant to gloss over as it's probably not the most coveted part of town and the restaurant itself is set back a bit from the road and looks like a house, but it is definitely worth a visit. They even have their own parking lot so you can just pull right in. My go to dish here is the Drunken Noodles with chicken. I would say this is the best dish (or pad thai) if you're making an introduction into the world of Thai food. This noodle dish is super flavorful, a tad spicy and at King and I they pack it with tasty vegetables such as onions, broccoli, carrots, and red peppers. The veggies are always just a little crunchy and give a good texture contrast to the pillowy soft noodles that are coated in an amazing sauce. They offer this dish with beef and shrimp as well and while I've tried them, I think chicken is my favorite. If you like spicy food, you can even ask them to go a little heavier on the spice but beware. This is a place where spicy actually means spicy so I tend to just do the regular option. I also will sometimes get steamed or fried dumplings which are very tasty. Aside from noodles, King and I has a large assortment of chicken,fish and curry dishes that I'm sure are good. Maybe I'll try them if I ever get tired of my favorite Drunken Noodle dish. I typically do takeout but there are a small amount of seats to dine in if you'd like. It's a small cozy restaurant but very authentic."}, {"review_id": "KfwqMExmzJZ12EJhzhfWDg", "user_id": "WbQdnAE5OM3bqWd0jVJ9-g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/25/2016", "text": "Tucked away in an unsuspecting corner of Hartford's Parkville neighborhood, it can be pretty easy to mistake King and I Thai Kitchen for someone's house as you drive by. The dining room is quite small, and upon entering, the space looks as though you have walked into someone's living room. Don't be discouraged by the cozy, casual atmosphere; the food is great and the family-run atmosphere really makes for a unique dining experience. Despite the range of menu selections, as a creature of hard habits - I always go for the Red Curry or Green Curry. They are so delicious. The green curry sauce was so tasty I could have eaten it by the spoonful. The flavor was sweet, creamy, and a bit spicy with notes of lemongrass. And the red curry is just as flavorful and delicious. The staff is very friendly - the servers are extremely attentive and very genuine and pleasant. My water glass was never empty.One of the best parts of King and I Thai is that the prices are relatively inexpensive. Entrees tend to be right around the ten-dollar range, which for the quality and size of the portions is a steal."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/king-and-i-thai-kitchen-hartford?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
