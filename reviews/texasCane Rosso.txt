The picture looks delicious so I had to come in. It's located in Deep Ellum so of course you have to pay for parking. Super easy to find though. I ordered the Honey Bastard pizza, which is located off the menu , aka the secret menu. The pizza is huge and enough for two people! The meat and crust on this pizza is delicious. I'm not really a fan of thin crust but it was so flavorful I nearly forgot about the crust. We ordered it and it came out instantly. Which was great because I was starving. The young lady server with green hair was really nice and helpful with food choices. Highly recommend this place. Definitely will be back but the Allen location."}, {"review_id": "nQk9pB8Y5GznJeoIwFi2Vw", "user_id": "JjyImOPhGY7s32AQyHqMhQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Cane Rosso is the most overrated restaurant of any cuisine in this area. I've been to this location and the Carrollton location multiple times. Every time, the outer 2/3 to 3/4 of the pizza is fine, and the center is always soggy. You can't pick it up b/c of the sogginess, and end up eating it with a knife and fork.Depending on what type of pizza you like, Grimaldi's or Gino's are better options."}, {"review_id": "dQZ3NUtsWOIk0EcU7Ux9tw", "user_id": "m_sv6Bn1-vDMht7NG58gBA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Just went here for lunch and was amazed at the service. As soon as we sat down, the manager (Jennifer) made sure we had our drinks. Our server (Demyyea) was fantastic. He knew the menu, talked us through options and made sure we ended up with some excellent pizzas. We had the Honey Bastard, which is a standout and the Paulie G, which was also very nice. The only knock is that the crust isn't to everyone's taste in that it's thin but also a little soggy. However, the flavor was fantastic and we cleared two 14\" pizzas without trouble. Normally, I'd post a photo but...as soon as the pizzas hit the table, we ate them!Definitely worth trying for anyone who hasn't been here and worth a return visit for the Honey Bastard as well."}, {"review_id": "wbT4VLlFONygK1jaPnhyUQ", "user_id": "U-ItjSFjwPGBRBfw2HWOzA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Didn't even eat yet and so rubbed the wrong way. Ordered the limoncello which is vodka orange blossom lemon zest and mint. My whole glass was ice. She made the drink, realized it was short and topped w soda. BAD FORM!!! No mint.. had to ask for it!! Ordered Brussel sprout app which was great then waited over an hour for this yuck of a pizza. Raw dough, hardly any sauce, no fresh mozzarella, and barely any basil I must have made a face when it came out cause the bartendar (High off his gourd!!) asked if everything was ok. He then started to explain that it was authentic Napoletano pizza. This comment just made me laugh!! Are you kidding me!? I asked for sauce and more basil. Rolled up the mushy slice and dipped into the sauce. I posted pic of it on Facebook and my east coast friends laughed as well. One commented that if that pizza was served in NJ/NY you'd probably be thrown into the east river. One and done!! Rather have shitty dominoes!"}, {"review_id": "vPW0xlofZziXyYffuwW4wQ", "user_id": "z91Uy7KuY-gmYHSWp48veA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Perfect outdoor atmosphere & pizza.  Pizza takes only about 90 seconds to cook in the wood fire oven at 900°.Always ask for Jana- she's the best!"}, {"review_id": "uHaNjIF8tjKgy6khu9MnAQ", "user_id": "djmYYf5lOnqz3RyIQerEwA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Deep Ellum location - I'd heard great things about Cane Rosso & was excited to visit.  Caccio e Peppe pasta was delicious.

Haha.  Order the Honey Pizza (I honestly forgot the name, but it's a sweet and spicy pizza) it's soooooooooo good!  The flavors and textures are just so so good.  The pizza comes out thin crust, my personal favorite, but I do wish it was just a little bit more crispy.  Another goodie, is the cesar salad.  As basic as it sounds, it was so freaking good.  Promise! Just order it! Our waiter was really nice, attentive, and food came out pretty quick for big group of us.  Definitely make reservations, it gets busy here for sure!"}, {"review_id": "skeZ1yzsKRZ2ji83uczlwg", "user_id": "j3zibvhd9x2IAhQ7MQ9JGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Every time I come here I leave satisfied.

Ask for the Pizza with Honey (not on the menu but so good) This Pizza is the best pizza I ever had in my life! Hands down. It was so good that we ordered a second pizza with fries. It was as good but the first one was so much better. The price is reasonable and it's dog friendly! They had a dollar mimosas (A DOLLAR!!) but I wasn't really a fan of it but I guess you can't complain about a dollar drink! I ended up ordered a bloody mary (3 dollars) and it was really tasty and loved the garnishes! I don't really like eating the crusts but I ended up eating the whole thing!

First shot was a good one with Cane Rosso! My first night in Dallas I was struggling to decide what to eat and decided to go with old faithful. I have to say, I'm glad I did. A welcome sight when I walked in to see the authentic oven front and center! Could it be too good to be true? Turns out it wasn't. I got a pizza with mushroom, olive, and artichoke. The pizza was fired perfectly, with a beautiful char and a chewy, flavorful interior. Miraculously (or skillfully) the center of the pizza had NO DROOP while eating it! Plenty of toppings, perfect amount of sauce, and no droop. Props!! Drinks were good too!My only disappointment is that I stopped eating meat in July and missed out on the special pizza with smoked meats and habanero honey. Even though I don't eat meat, I have to say I know for a FACT that flavor combo is b.o.m.b. and if you're an omnivore you should give it a shot."}, {"review_id": "me4it6jNyabnIMmlR5NVyw", "user_id": "fJbug5ELzW_9ZvG_kz1xiQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "I'm so glad the pizza was good...Me and some friends went here tonight for some drinks and food. We've heard great things about the place, so it was no surprise that there was a wait. We weren't expecting them to tell us one hour, but we decided to stick it out. The weird thing about this place is that they have these high tables that you can stand and socialize at.  1)They don't have chairs to go with the tables. 2)You can drink and order appetizers but you can't order and eat pizza at the tables. This was very annoying news. I guess a manger sensed our frustration and hangriness and came over to make sure we were doing ok. Of course we weren't. He said that he would get us taken care of as soon as he could. Sure enough, we were seated shortly after. Our waiter was very nice and got us food pretty quickly. The pizzas are big enough for 2 so we split 2 pizzas amongst the four of us. We ordered Brussels sprouts as an app and they were very good. I ordered a jack and coke and it taste like plain coke but it was okay. As stated, the pizza was really good. We got a pepperoni and sausage pizza and a mushroom pizza. I'm glad that the staff saw a problem and immediately took care of it.

Parking was easy in the pay by phone lot directly behind the restaurant. We had no reservation, but it wasn't too busy on a Monday night. We were able to be seated right away. The hostess gave us the option of sitting at a table or at the pizza bar, so we decided to sit at the bar. It is a really interesting experience sitting at the bar, because you get to see the pizzas tossed, prepared, and thrown into the wood fire oven.We started with the Jimmy Johnson Dip, which was basically a small pizza with spinach dip as the topping. It was delicious! We followed it up with the Paulie Gee pizza. It was spicy and perfectly cooked. We loved it!The restaurant has a good vibe, and all of the staff were super friendly. This is one restaurant that definitely lives up to the hype!
