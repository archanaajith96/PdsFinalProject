The Naughty Greek is amazing and such a great addition to the neighborhood.I'm a vegetarian, and their virgin pita is sooooooo good and fresh. Get it with a side of naughty fries (don't forget the sassy cheese sauce!). I often order from Bite Squad, but the couple times I've eaten in were good experiences. I've also ordered takeout from the University location and the staff was very friendly -- however I will probably stick with going to the Snelling shop because the parking was a bit difficult.Takeaway: one of my favorite \"fast\" food places in St. Paul...try it!"}, {"review_id": "JKtePTOk9tHDvvpeZhh-Xw", "user_id": "Oyp6iL6GVwtmV5MoAb6rnw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "This small little restaurant on the corner of Selby and Snelling in St. Paul is a must-try. There's not a ton of indoor seating, so I usually get take out. However, when the weather is nice, they do have outdoor seating. Food is awesome--I've always gotten either the chicken gyro or the pork gyro (surprisingly, they don't have lamb gyros on the menu). My meal has always been hot, fresh, and satisfying. The gyros are quite large; but if you're really hungry, I would suggest getting a side salad because it's larger than you'd expect. I haven't seen many Greek restaurants around in St. Paul; but that's ok, because this place is great. Definitely recommend!"}, {"review_id": "6TZqxKCyBWJAto17-oIz7g", "user_id": "EcFq3b1Y2yaDrdnRAUhgpw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "The Naughty Greek is so so yummy!

I can't stop craving the food. Loved everything...well almost. My husband and I met for lunch, street parking was a pain in the ass considering the location. However, that won't deter me from coming back to fulfill my lust for the pork gyro meat. I like the bright and modern restaurant for the most part, but it seemed cramped, and the menu on the side wall is in a awkward spot making it hard to read. It was quite busy when we came, tables were left dirty, and the bathroom needed attention. We ordered at the register, received a number, and was able to snag a table by the window. We asked for water, they had ran out of glasses so we got toddler size glasses. I had to ration my water as I wasn't sure I wanted to bug them at the counter for more. Our food came quickly. We ordered the flash fried eggplant, and gyro plate with pork, and we upgraded our fries to Naughty fries, which is a must. Holy smokes! That pork was scrumptious, and the fries were tangy and savory, hitting all of my foodie dreams. All stars go to the food. There are plenty of items I'll be back to try!"}, {"review_id": "2RYjt2z-PTy_J8IXIcWs9g", "user_id": "Kx2nK74Px46MvzLtdgpv-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Great food!

If you aren't looking for it, you'd probably miss it. It has an authentic feel to it being so small with white brick similar to the gyro shops in Greece. However, the food didn't live up to my expectations. They may be high for me since I've been to Greece but I have had better gyros in the area. The meat wasn't that flavorful and I was hoping for more fillings than it had."}, {"review_id": "o0sWru1yuvonQnGOi9yncg", "user_id": "ZKr4YuXdzq41sVk-_29k-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "I LOVE The Naughty Greek. I started going here when the first location opened within the first month of it's opening. That space is so cozy and warm and the smell of that meat cooking is AMAZING. Every time I step inside that space I just get excited. I find the food to all be amazing and to be of good value for the price. A single gyro will fill me up for lunch at $8-ish, I think that's great! Usually, we end up ordering even more than that though because we love the spanikopita. I'm steadily trying everything on the menu so I can find my favorites. Currently, my go to is the pork gyro. I don't like chicken as much, as a general rule so the chicken isn't as good to me. For the starters, I love the SIMPLY TZATZIKI and the SPANAKOPITA. The SALACIOUS EGGPLANT SPREAD didn't appeal to me as much. It's served cold and it's a bit chunky. The flavors, to me, just don't meld as much and eggplant isn't as personally appealing to me. The SASSY CHEESE SPREAD is delish. It's got a good zing to it and it's very thick. I love when I have this leftover to take home! The fries are thin and flavorful. They have a good, slight sogginess, not in a gross way but in the way I prefer my fries. I LOVE them. Out of the salads, my favorite right now is the Kale. I love the dressing and the amount of cheese they put on. It's a great salad. It's actually a salad I can order as a meal and not feel sad about. If you haven't, stop in and see what you think."}, {"review_id": "8IFcemoBivrATXh3u0ZTOQ", "user_id": "ZJM3ED1GCpkEUQQARgJs6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Naughty Greek is a comfy restaurant near the corner of Snelling and Summit, and a great place to get quick Greek food.  They have a variety of pita plates, gyros, and other Greek options to choose from, but I've always gone for the plates to get the variety.  Always extremely filling, and oh so flavorful.  They also have a Greek beer available for purchase to enjoy during the meal.  Nice cozy atmosphere to have some amazing authentic Greek food."}, {"review_id": "ncl0nWoYcQHXaiG7QVn4yg", "user_id": "GwILk6cchEmSyrix_l_jpw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Absolute perfection! The Naughty Greek totally lived up to my high expectations. To start, I definitely recommend the mezze platter. This lets you try three spreads (the tzatziki was my favorite, cheese dip a close second) along with one hot app (feta cheese wrapped in flaky pasty and drizzled with honey?! Yes please). For an entree, I had the pork gyro with a side salad. The pork was incredible- perfectly cooked, seasoned, and slightly crispy. The pita wrap was the same! If you check in on yelp, you can try a free dessert. This did not disappoint! To top it off, the staff was super friendly and the food came out fast."}, {"review_id": "brBHV2zVTj7FPJu73YWNqw", "user_id": "s21l2lHoxKSc7SlvfvTHHQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "Holy crap, the Naughty Greek. I've only been once (for now), but I do dream about their tzatziki platter at night. It is the most authentic tzatziki spread outside of the Mediterranean...I think. I guess I've never been to the Mediterranean but I'm assuming this is what it should taste like. Okay, I know I've now lost all credibility, but this stuff is good.  First off, it's a spread, not a dip or sauce. It smears well on pita and has the perfect blend of lemon, garlic and dill but stays light and airy. Make sure to spit the pits out of the olives in a tasteful, discreet way. The pork gyro. Wow. I was originally disappointed that the NG didn't serve the traditional lamb/beef mixture on a spit, but not anymore! Now I'll be disappointed whenever do they not have the pork on a spit. The pork was tender and juicy and was complimented well by the tzatziki.

We did some research on Yelp and Naughty Greek was the pick.We got a free piece of cake just for checking in on Yelp, which was cool, and I ordered the original Greek salad with pork gyro and my wife got the tzatziki dip with pita.We waited and sipped on our Diet Coke for about 5-6 minutes and then out came the love.The tzatziki was super creamy and flavorful and a perfect pairing with the pita.My wife gave me about half of her tzatziki to add to my salad, which was pretty good size. The pork gyro was a little more fatty than I expected, so I would probably get the lamb or whatever option there was, but I saw pork gyro, so I had to try it, since you never see that option.Lots of tomato hunks, and a nice slice of feta topped it off. Really good stuff. The team working was super nice as well. highly recommended!The background music was even super cool. Some jazz and swing. Fun place!

I got the chicken kabob plate with fries and ordered a side salad. My salad was delicious but terribly overdressed. A little less dressing and it would have been green crunchy perfection. My chicken was egregiously dried out but still had good flavor. I liked the fries but they weren't very hot. The pita was fresh and fine along with their tzatziki sauce.
