It was early afternoon on a Sunday. They weren't busy nor slow, severing about a half dozen tables total. My son had the tamale platter, which looked moist and appetizing to me, and he agreed that it was good. I had the al pastor taco platter. I was happy with the quality of the meat, as well as how well trimmed it was. Another plus for me was that there were no chunks of pineapple in it, which is an automatic thumbs down for me. However, I was surprised that it was really just lacking overall flavor. Not bad, not good, just not there. I'm not sure how you accomplish this with a marinated, spit roasted piece of meat. The tortillas were white corn and fried. Again, I prefer the yellow but can be satisfied with white. All in all, I would go back if the situation presented itself again. I won't go out of my way for a special trip just to eat here though."}, {"review_id": "OodyHbyBrXR0bXiJOa_0Uw", "user_id": "f2oPJJwSI7A4SjXU6P_6Dg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "First time there recommended by a friend.

The meat is unseasoned, almost tastes as if it was boiled. All of the tortillas were soggy, and I couldn't even cut into the Chile Relleno. They also put a glob of sour cream on my platter that was curdled. I'm never going back. $39 pissed away, now I'm heading back out to find a real Mexican restaurant."}, {"review_id": "e0IQSQ2aNH_idpTdXkz5fQ", "user_id": "gIodbUBep7NMV-HRuwg8wg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/29/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I'm sorry to say after years of coming here, things have really declined. Came in on a Sunday afternoon.  Service was inattentive. The once delicious tableside guacamole tasted very bland. Our meals were meh. And a bug in my drink. Overall, the place seemed dirty. For the past 7 years, we've come here almost weekly.

We got seated after about 15-20 minutes, granted it was a Friday night. We where kindly greeted by the waiter and waters and chips where soon followed. LOVED the Sangria!! Ordered the flaming cheese, such a fun presentation and tasted great. It was a perfect little dinner date for a Friday night that was easy on the budget and overall a good atmosphere to just chat and laugh!! Would highly recommend to at least give it a try! :-)"}, {"review_id": "JPf3khsTmqHSMeDP4t310Q", "user_id": "OUd5ih0Kyd4tuUW1RBje7w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "The food made me ill, the margarita tasted like dirty dish water and it was so Smokey in there!"}, {"review_id": "9g6ECfBNy7LPZHUf6t4vKA", "user_id": "FtGglBDqHdOMjU6CgXStUw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "HORRIBLE SERVICE. at the very least never order takeout. Your order is a bother and will be cared for way after the dine in.. i ordered just tacos. Fine. Needed soup for my sick daughter told 30minutes????? Fine i'll wait. Go to the bar part and decide to have drinks while i wait,if i can get served. The bartender ignores me. I try to get his attention,he's running all over the place. I see he sits a couple cleans their table and i figure i'm next. NOPE. After about 20 fuming minutes i finally chase him down and thank him for not taking my order. He says he thought i just wanted takeout WITHOUT ASKING ME. whatever. Give me my food. Someone who ordered after me already was leaving with their food. I got mine after 40minutes. This has happened  before but decided to give them another chance. No more. This place is only good to get soccer moms from white eagle drunk on margaritas. They tip more."}, {"review_id": "OoYOXT_Eh8ra1WTnlGfpOQ", "user_id": "V9CNig6Cpzyr5tJsrkEHMQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/25/2017", "text": "Meh not the greatest Mexican food, I can get better tacos at los burritos for cheaper.

This was our staple! Towards the end, we started noticing a change in the business and quality...I withheld updating my review because I thought it was just a few bad experiences. But now it's been one too many.We visited this Monday and it was likely the last time we'll go. It's a sad realization, because we truly loved Rito's but Monday's experience was just horrible. Long story short: it was a MONDAY night but you'd have thought it was a Friday. Two servers for the entire restaurant. We waited over an HOUR for our meal from when we ordered it. We ordered an appetizer - asked for AN order of guacamole. When it was delivered, there were two cups of guac and we assumed one order was just split up - nope...the server took it upon himself to order us TWO apps and charge us for two as well. He also delivered the guac but no chips...and we sat for 20 minutes waiting for chips. My husband's meal was also incorrect.Very disappointing service. Our server was clearly frustrated and rushed but other than an apology, we got nothing. This is a situation where a manager comes out or we're given a cheap dessert for free. We saw other tables walk in after us, and leave before we even received our meal. Adios, Rito's. It's been real."}, {"review_id": "NUAYKKbnlfebsjiGAbyCiQ", "user_id": "rSO_KXEZrKX3hkoeQLYEfg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2017", "text": "Amazing Food!!! Amazing Service!
