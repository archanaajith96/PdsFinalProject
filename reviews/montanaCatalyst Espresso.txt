If you want good food don't come to Montana. It's difficult to find food that is rich in flavor. It's also hard to find authentic ethnic food. \"Our own version\" of Chilaquiles is a joke.

Not impressed and won't be back.   We waited almost thirty minutes for our food. The menu did state it could be 20-30 minutes if their busy. I honestly don't mind waiting for good food but this was anything but that. One of us got the bread pudding which is not bread pudding. It was more of a thick oatmeal based dish.   I got the build an entree with the green chili pepper jack potato casserole. The flavor was good but the potatoes were under cooked and crunchy.   The regular coffee was horrible and weak. You'd think with it being an espresso bar, that even the normal coffee would be decent.   Sorry we weren't blown away, I really wish we had been."}, {"review_id": "p9x97lYqy1bTvY6EZTho9g", "user_id": "6Dwh99zbe_lhfOD4MiAM1g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "Much more than a coffee shop! Menu filled with great local and unique international fare. The drip coffee was delicious! My mom ordered a latte which was beautiful.The Georgian spread made from pomegranate and walnut was great. I added it to my Hero sandwich and it really kicked it up a notch. My first run in with Georgian cuisine, in Missoula, Montana of all places. I also had a side of their Thursday special Mac n cheese which was served with a side of a red curry jam sauce to give it some more flavor. My mom ordered a breakfast plate that looked great and the few bites I had of her sausage and bacon were good. Most of their ingredients seem to be locally sourced. The menu was pretty vast. I'm not sure I made the best choice with a cold sandwich, but looking forward to a future visit to further explore the menu. It's adorable inside with an upper balcony level and staff was welcoming. The place was bumping, but I noticed staff go out of their way to kindly greet each customer as they came in.  Not necessarily the type of coffee spot you'd go to work. Although they did have a cozy seating area with a more secluded table in their basement area that might've been a good place to camp and get some work done. Great local spot for coffee, breakfast or lunch!"}, {"review_id": "oWdeKb-phxihKbW3fZm-BQ", "user_id": "-u5kQutcNnqxtwi6PpV2FQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/29/2017", "text": "I admit - i was thrown by the name \"Espresso\" and expected this to be a coffee shop with a few pastries for breakfast, but I was delightfully surprised to find it is an awesome cafe with breakfast and lunch menus. Better yet, there are tons of choices for vegans (and even more for vegetarians). We were on a mini-vacation, so we went indulgent and ordered a lot of food. All of it was awesome. The hubs had \"The Heap\" with tofu subbed for eggs, and it was delicious! There was a mound of veggies on top of potatoes, and the tofu added an extra protein kick. It came with a side of sourdough (our choice) toast with homemade jam. How  can you go wrong with homemade jam? I got my own toast (carbs!), plus a healthy helping of Montana-made 7-grain hot cereal that came with brown sugar and (in my case, soy) milk. We also split an order of smoky, perfect tempeh. It was truly some of the best tempeh either of us had ever had! The service was good, too. Our coffee cups and water glasses remained filled, and the server was both cool and friendly. I dug her shades, too. If I find myself back in Missoula, I would totally come here."}, {"review_id": "eDOXJmdjau0eeI1WiVNxGg", "user_id": "iRJ9r8fXduur7-f-tziaaA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Menu is way way too big.  Not into the corn chips.  Service is all over the map.  Refused to substitute over-easy eggs instead of scambled.  Really people?  I think the owners are great - but wish it was all tightened up a bit."}, {"review_id": "jMqWqh1fbIiQsYeid6E16Q", "user_id": "9IC0OY68j2LlLjtftlWpEQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/29/2017", "text": "An amazing meal in a great environment in a fun city!We happened upon Catalyst by way of looking for gluten free options while passing through Missoula.  Boy were we glad we did.  For this was the first time in I don't know how long we got a great hot gluten free breakfast that was more than just eggs!My wife had one of their skillet concoctions called The Heap!  Eggs, potatoes, veggies, the works!  I had the Huevos Rancheros.  Both were so good.  For me, it was the best HR I've ever had.  Fresh tasting ingredients and full of yummy flavors!Washed down with orange juice that if it wasn't freshly squeezed it was pretty darn close, bottomless coffee, and hot tea . . . and we were set for the day!  A great location right on the main drag of downtown Missoula, Catalyst is a must-go for anyone."}, {"review_id": "ymKTxVoGPMEFCDRaXCkyYA", "user_id": "c0Vpzih1ElBUPYsauGBWVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "This restaurant was really great.

It was about 8:00... I knocked on the door and asked to come in out of the cold. \"We open at 8:00\". Strike one What the hell kind of breakfast place opens that late?? I came in and waited by the door until they were ready to acknowledge me. \"Sit anywhere you like\" Ok, so they were not going to seat me. No biggie, but very basic restaurant customer service was clearly not on anyone's mind. I ordered the breakfast burrito with ham and a latte. Coffee was good, but the burrito was flavorless, save the ham. Undercooked black beans.... I could only eat half before the stomach ache set in. Absolutely gross and obviously prepared by someone that knows nothing about food. Strike two. I'm not going to rate them one star, because the coffee was good, but these guys are pretty clueless  regarding customer service and care for food preparation.

Excellent service accompanying incredible food. Missoula desperately needed this little gem. From the moment we arrived, to the moment we finished we had absolutely stellar service. And not from one person. Literally every person that we encountered. That, in itself, is quite a feat in this day and age. Here we go. We sat outside because the weather was perfect. That sometimes means they forget about you, but not so at catalyst. Coffee: excellent. When I finished my espresso, she gave me regular. That was a lovely touch. Food: Where do I begin? They have so many delicious offerings. I can't wait to go back and try more. I saw those puffy green soufflés and I really wanted one! I had the protein plate. Cheesy scrambled eggs with choice of protein and a bountiful amount of sliced tomatoes?! Yes please. I also had a side of kimchi. It was really gingery, which I love. My darling husband had the Tex mex napoleon. It was beautiful! Layers of tortillas, beans, eggs on top and he loved every bite. They have a fabulous homemade coffee chipotle, which I loved!

Thankfully we were not disappointed. A small quaint restaurant with seating outside, inside and in a loft, it gives a feel of being tight knit. Photos on the wall displace local flavour. We started with coffee and it was good, we had a few cups :). My husband had a chilaquilas. I didn't get much questioning in on his food choice because he gobbled it up. That is a pure indication he is enjoying his food. I got the heavos ranchero. I really liked the ranchero sauce and the thin tortillas but it was lacking something. I had to order a side of hash browns to round out the meal. It just needed something to soak up the ranchero sauce. Otherwise I can see why this is such a good joint in Missoula."}, {"review_id": "MpFcWhPg7epDBOi0fhWYQQ", "user_id": "G5dS0RccyeiBtzjGl_k10A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/10/2017", "text": "We are in Missoula for a week of vacation.

We started with drinks from the espresso bar - one latte and one Mexican mocha, which were both excellent!The food is also extraordinary - though I ordered far more than I could eat! I built an omelet with my choice of 5 ingredients, green chile pepper jack potato casserole (order this, you will fall in love!), and rye toast with some amazing homemade jam!
