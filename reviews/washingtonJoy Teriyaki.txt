Glad this place is around -- people who work there are kind; food always tastes a little more fresh and better prepared than other places; place seems clean and fairly quiet. Things to avoid if you're veggie like me:I didn't love the kung pao tofu -- too sweet. Egg roll has meat inside. :(Thank you Joy Teriyaki!"}, {"review_id": "lKlvC03rEZU0Qzha5XRCOA", "user_id": "fyXzrRj7guDVJFAw1yWi_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Solid Yaki shop!  It is always a wonderful thing to have a local Go To Yaki shop to satisfy your myriad cravings involving spicy chicken , spicy beef, chicken katsu; your basic bread and butter awesomeness.  Here's the scoop: the food is excellent as far as Yaki shops go; the prices are a little high but well worth it, and the service is amazing.  This is the best Yaki shop in North Tacoma.  Don't mess with the rest."}, {"review_id": "njhQ1lAC9F6UyipZy1F8NA", "user_id": "VGdeRXs-ICjMWwOi056xHQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "One of my favorite teriyaki places!

I had an order of tofu noodles (yakiudon instead of yakisoba) and my boyfriend got chicken teriyaki, gyoza,rice, and salad. He gave me his salad which was just plain iceberg lettuce and some kind of sweet dressing.My noodles were great, nice springy udon noodles, cabbage/carrot/broccoli/onion veggies mixed in. Tofu was fried nicely and there was a lot of it. Noodle dish was 12.99 and combo teriyaki was 11.99. We ordered via UberEats and on arrival the food seemed fresh and still warm, very good."}, {"review_id": "mETrmAv8U6nq_WlXjaaPzQ", "user_id": "wimEkpZbIdF9bbDhff2fjg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "I ordered D honey garlic chicken with rice and salad the chicken was completely dry the rice was mushy I'll try something else next time but if I have another experience like this I won't order from this place again"}, {"review_id": "_FW-zkpTt-20OQwq6F4oZw", "user_id": "bosIfGrFy_XJVDKKBL-knA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Good food!

Now I don't even know the yaki joints in my stomping grounds, let alone in the South Sound. But from what I can see, Joy has it pretty dialed.They're on a section of 6th that hasn't quite caught up to the standard of all the remodeling happening elsewhere through this stretch of road. It's not bad, just not shiny and new (who knows, though--the whole street might get a makeover before they're done). There's parking outside, and modest signage. It's kinda the classic independent yaki place that way--find some nice affordable square footage, clean it up a bit, and there you go.Inside, the floor is a bit uneven, and the ceilings are a bit low, but the decor feels homey, and the people are so, so nice. You get a warm feeling just being there, despite the limited space and limited light. There are a handful of tables, but you can see right away by the stacks of bags and clamshells on the counter that they really crank the to-go orders first and foremost. The menu is extensive; it runs literally wall to wall above the register--teriyaki, yakisoba, chinese food, combinations. Side dishes. All kindsa stuff. Everything is reasonably priced--I got chicken breast teriyaki, spicy chicken teriyaki, gyoza, and shrimp yakisoba for $39 after tax. Not probably the cheapest in town, but definitely competitive. The chicken breast was under-seasoned for my money, but the spicy chicken had great flavor and some actual kick to the pepper. The gyoza were the usual gyoza, and tasted great. My sister loved the yakisoba, though I didn't taste it. I would definitely come back to this place. The lady behind the counter was one of the nicest I've met in a while."}, {"review_id": "toDIwH3kc_gmCvYDSKsGPw", "user_id": "GvefI1Cx27nfJ6iCx6LK7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "Owner is really sweet and caring.

I didn't know it would be battered and fried, since it didn't say on the menu, but maybe it's one of those things folks are expected to know and I'm just a dork. I was more in the mood for a leaner meal, but for that disappointment it was pretty tasty. super sweet....I mean HONEY is in its title, why wouldn't it be.   it came with 2 small scoops of rice and a bed of iceberg lettuce with a sweet mayo dressing....so kinda sweeted out with the whole meal. ***went a 2nd time for the teriyaki chicken breast and have to say the have the least sweet teriyaki sauce I've ever experienced. Twas almost savory. I like it sweeter, but not by much. the will sub out steamed veggies for the iceberg lettuce with sugar laden mayo...that was nice. but they were literally only steamed. no seasoning at all. I prefer pan sauteed where they get a touch caramelized, but I need to shut up as I'm feeling like a food snob again."}, {"review_id": "hg9bsK6g_WCrZ_VL340_1Q", "user_id": "1afPtEJkkXDrdXSr7ftf-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "Great spot to eat!
