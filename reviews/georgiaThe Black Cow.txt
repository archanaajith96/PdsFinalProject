The service was prompt and friendly, and when I asked for a recommendation I was told that the meat loaf was very popular. Never one to eschew homestyle cooking, I ordered the meat loaf with green beans & loaded mashed potatoes. I wasn't disappointed! The meatloaf came with ketchup drizzled over it, but it wasn't needed to mask the great flavors of the dish. Similarly, the green beans were great (though obviously covered in butter) and the loaded mashed potatoes (with cheese, bacon & scallions) were good as well. It all made a great impression and I can't wait to go back to try some of their other entrees."}, {"review_id": "rrg-5ts56MHpb9hOKpRcnA", "user_id": "4K8ZrbEIfnfIpz5c8JTfTg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "The food was ok, but definitely on the more expensive side for the quality. I wasn't a very big fan of selection, or lack there of, either. The drinks were decent and reasonably priced at about 10 bucks. The service was terrible, but maybe it was just a fluke or bad night.

The experience was highlighted by my choice of meatloaf (not your grandmother's boring beef!) with collard greens and cole slaw which I downed before the waitress made it back to check on our satisfaction.  My wife had the chicken and waffles (that I helped her finish) and that made me wish I had ordered it along with the meatloaf. They also have a nice selection of drinks that go well with the meals. Apparently this isn't a secret since by 6pm the place was packed.

They poured over bacon jam and got too sweet when I poured over the syrup. I should've left the bacon jam solo. As for the chicken, it was not as juicy as I'd expect. Kinda dry-The grits were tasty and flavorful with the white cheddar. I'd say if you order the chicken and waffles, taste the waffle before you pour over the syrup."}, {"review_id": "lpEYsCUULUuoI2kn5jTLlQ", "user_id": "BHSNTxru35XjOz-9AXUzwQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "Came in for lunch during a quick trip to Columbus. It was prime lunch hour, but they seated us fairly quickly. Loved my shrimp po'boy, but it needed more sauce on the bread. Hubby loved his fries and chicken sandwich. The two soldiers we treated wolfed down their burgers, but who knows if you can trust the judgment of two young men fresh out of Basic Training, lol?!Service was great.

When we arrived the place was packed however the great service at the bar made waiting for a table no big deal. Our server was very polite and accommodating. She walked us through the menu, provided us with her personal recommendations, and ensured our overall experience was delightful. The only constructive feedback that I would provide would have to be:-the mashed potatoes on most of our plates were all luke warm at best and could have been a little warmer-lighting was bright...turn those Edison bulbs down a bit and give the place a warmer glow :)Overall we really liked this place and would recommend it to anyone looking for a casual vibrant scene with delicious food.

Me and my boyfriends parents came to town to my boyfriends graduation from I-BOLC and stopped and ate here based of his recommendation and the reviews. I was NOT disappointed! I got the chicken and grits and they got the chicken and grits and the bubbas fried basket with grouper. I LOVED my dish. It was flavorful and every bite was better than the last.

They have a number of delicious, casual burgers, salads, and sandwiches to offer. This is a great place to stop in on a hazy, hot afternoon to grab a beer and a bite to cool off.

Went in and sat at the bar. Katie was amazing. She helped recommend what I had and she was spot on. She made me feel welcomed and worked hard the whole time I was there. People picking up to go orders said this place was owned by a guy who owns 6 restaurants in town and highly recommended them all. WOW,it's hard enough to have one great restaurant, much less 6. So Katie recommended the Lobster Tots. Holy mackerel, they were perfect. Then she said the pimento cheese and bacon burger was very good and once again she was exactly right. Best one I have ever had anywhere. This is the first time I have ever written a review but the whole experience was so good that I thought I would write one this time.Thanks again Katie and good luck at school!"}, {"review_id": "ITKepgkvdvyBQJT1aVPEIQ", "user_id": "zRRryjEhsv3UAp-irURFOQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Passing through to go to PCB in Florida.

Although it was pleasant enough that I did not mind a stroll.Abby was my server and she did a great job!I decided on the Shrimp & Grits with the Pineapple Casserole side. I consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur of Shrimp & Grits but I must admit this was a first for me for the Grits to be a fried Grit Cake covered with the sauce and Shrimp & Andouille Sausage.  Speaking of Andouille, I would have liked to have had a bit more of it. Otherwise there was a good ratio of protein to sauce & grits. The Pineapple Casserole was very good and would certainly recommend.It is hard for me to resist dessert and I went with Abby's recommendation for the Black Cow Pie. It was a very good peanut butter pie in a chocolate pie crust with caramel, chocolate sauce and nuts. Very good creamy consistency. Only downside was I wish that there had been a dessert menu with prices before ordering. When traveling for business and on a budget it helps to plan and ensure you remain within your per Diem. As good as it was, for $6.95+ tax I would have probably just waited and had fresh cookies back at the hotel or let the Pineapple Casserole suffice as a sweet ending for the meal."}, {"review_id": "VnlslVMsUEtnQwy0-nKxHA", "user_id": "kz-dS3drJHclAMHVPYyhvg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "We heard about The Black Cow from Yelp, locals, and even the tourist guide to Columbus, so our expectations were running high to try this local fave! Maybe our expectations were set too high. There was no wait, Abby was as perfect a server as one would hope for, and the signature dishes we shared lived up to the hype, yet the small details is where we were lost. Our fries were cold and seemed tough like they sat out awhile, the sides ordered were luke warm which wouldn't have been terrible if one wasn't a cold side (cole slaw) and the other hot (pineapple casserole). I definitely would give this place another shot as it was a busy night, but I'm not a local. Maybe next time. Must recommend the suggested signature entrees like the Pimento Cheese & Bacon Burger (award-winning!), the \"almost better than Mom's\" Meatloaf, and the sweet and savory Pineapple Casserole!"}, {"review_id": "9SYVJF7_0kLxTioVpxNksg", "user_id": "8rTmzaoHk_Nb16DecqSMqA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/1/2017", "text": "Food was fresh and atmosphere very relaxing.  I watched my good once it was prepared sit under the light for 6-8 minutes before arriving to our table but I think they were waiting to serve myHusbands grilled chicken salad.  Which was very fresh and delish.  I ordered collards and sweet potato fries both where delish and filling.
