Our youngest had just completed the Mini Heart 2K run and we wanted to treat him to a meal out while downtown.We decided on Nada because we all love Mexican. Upon arriving around noon, they were not very busy yet. We waited about 10 minutes as a table was prepared.They sat up upstairs in the main seating area which worked out well. It's a fun place to eat as the decorations are bright and there is a lot of light. We ordered the chips and the Mexican Poutine as an appetizer. The chips were really good as was the salsa. Nothing extraordinary but very good.The Mexican Poutine was delicious but also extremely small considering the price and that it is listed as communal. It wouldn't share it with more than 1 or maybe 2 other people. I had the Mu Shu tacos which had a good amount of meat and toppings on them. Flavor had a sweet, Asian flair to them. I also sampled the Mac n Cheese which featured peppers and had a nice spice and was very filling.Service was fairly prompt until the end when we had to wait a long time to get our check. I'm a fan of Nada but find the prices to be a touch high for the portion sizes. But if you are looking for upscale Mexican and Magaritas while in Downtown Cincinnati, this is the place for you."}, {"review_id": "Ax3UYLTSAMvAya-qGo6ZJg", "user_id": "RVagGrcHdy1HB7-_c9ywZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "The fact that I haven't reviewed Nada yet is simply because I'm too busy munching on guac and queso to type something out.Nada is a gorgeous two story restaurant situated on the corner of 6th and Walnut in the middle of the Aronoff district. I've been there too many times to count, and I've never had a bad meal. Usually I start off with a Nadarita, and some queso and guacamole. If you've ever read a review I've had with queso, you know I am very, very picky about my queso. I don't want those cheese whiz type confections everyone tries to pass off as a Tex-Mex delicacy. I want real, expensive cheese delicately melted to create a Mexi-fondue that's laced with spices and peppers. Nada does that perfectly for me, and they even add chorizo to give it the spicy, meaty kick I've been longing for.After I gorge on queso and guac, I attempt to order tacos. I usually reach for the shrimp or salmon, but my roommate swears on the baja fish. Yesterday's trip warranted me to be smart - maybe two margs is the happy spot where you have an epiphany while eating? Anywho, I decided to order the shrimp tacos TO GO - so I can enjoy my happy green goddess covered tacos in the peace of my home without people watching me unbutton my pants.If for some odd reason you have time for dessert, reach for the churros. I'm not a churro person by any means, but Nada's are sugar coated perfectly without putting me into a glucose coma. Combined with their chocolate and caramel sauces, you'll be sent to a euphoria that can best be shown as Augustus Goop before he fell into the chocolate river. (I wonder if they had churros in there to dip into the chocolate river?) All in all, you should visit Nada. If you find yourself in Columbus, Indy, Nashville, or Bethesda (WHAT!?), you should visit Nada. Nada is always the answer."}, {"review_id": "tWlrvghiar0eaF3jlxSE6w", "user_id": "NKsfaIJZlPZujo5cXopK3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "I came to Nada for a work lunch, just as I have many times in the past, and once again I was not disappointed! The service is always friendly and serve your drinks and food fast. The food is delicious AND fairly priced! During this trip to Nada I split chips and guacamole with some of my coworkers and then for my main meal I got the Shrimp Taco Box which came with two soft tacos and a side dish, I got the sweet potato and cranberry salad - both were extremely tasty and filling! The Taco Box was $15 and the chips and guacamole split between us was only $2 each - I thought this was well worth the money as I left feeling stuffed. Nada is known for being the best business lunch place in Cincinnati and I can agree to that completely - over this work lunch me and my coworkers were discussing work with papers all over and the staff did not seem to care or be annoyed.

Convenience was the main factor, plus we all like Mexican food.I found the menu to be limited. Often there are lots of choices at mexican restaurants. There aren't here. I found something, but it was not something I really wanted. But, with such a limited menu, it was something I didn't want much less than I didn't want other entrees.We got 3 appetizers  (salsa, guacamole, and queso) and, honestly, that would have been enough for me.  I found this after the fact, of course.  The guac, salsa, and queso were really good. Superior, actually.  Queso seemed to have smoked gouda in it, which gave it a very nice flavor. I went ahead and gave 4 stars,  altho this is not a place I would probably pick to eat at again unless it was just drinks and appetizers. Lots of seafood related entrees on the limited menu. I am not a fan of seafood, which limited me even more,  but I realize many people love seafood. So I won't drop stars for that. Service was attentive. Flavor was good in what we did get. Prices are a bit steep.  I guess that's to be expected downtown directly next to the Aronoff."}, {"review_id": "qB3GV0Ir6xnUigVwndsIZQ", "user_id": "TQLJ8m9cewC_mTrJciygLQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Absolutely delicious!

My favorite taco was the señor mu shu - what a delectable fusion they have discovered in that tasty taco of deliciousness. Best margarita ever.

I think Nada has become a staple place to go for my team because time and time again we get great service, high quality food & amazing drinks. I loved the pork belly tacos that I got last time so I figured why not do it again because these are the best I've had EVER! I love pork belly so whenever I encounter a place that does them right, I sorta have to get some! We started off with the guacamole, salsa and queso apps with chips. I sipped on an aqua de Rosa which was so yummy and refreshing. I also had a Brazilian mule & ended my night with a tequila shot (YOLO). My tacos were divine. I was able to add a shrimp taco and then I traded on of my pork belly tacos with a friend for her Sir Winston's pot roast tacos which was braised short rib WITH potatoes, onions, horseradish & shishito! It's a new item and it's AMAZING!!!! You have to try it.

I've been many many times and have always had a pleasurable experience for the most part. Although they have a great menu at all times of the day, I prefer their weekend brunch, which many are still unaware that they have. They have some of their lunch items, such as their well known, delicious tacos still available during this time. I typically order a taco medley, the French toast (bananas foster style), or the the chorizo and egg enchiladas. All of them are so amazing!!! The flavors are perfect! If you would like an appetizer, I suggest their trio of salsas with chips. As far as their atmosphere, be prepared because it will be loud! The vibe is designed to be fun this way. If that is bothersome to you or you want something intimate, it may not be a good idea to dine here. You will also have a wait unless it's lunch time. Make reservations in advance to help with this.
