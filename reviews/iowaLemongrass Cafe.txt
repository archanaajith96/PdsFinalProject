I've only been here once, but it was delicious.  I ordered the waitresses recommendation. I can't remember the name of the dish but it was egg noodles, chicken, with an onion and carrot garnish in a thick rich coconutty curry. Absolutely delicious. I had a Singha beer on the side which was a perfect contrast. There are about 8 beers on tap here and possibly cocktails. I've just started trying the menu but I'm excited to experience more. Glad this placed lived up to the hype of all the other reviews!"}, {"review_id": "pPUbhVDh5Lkq24QCX5oqfQ", "user_id": "AhvqcmQM8oHLT2ksD1s4Bg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "\"So Sharon, let me get this straight. You want to tear down the old family barn, and use the reclaimed pieces to build out an Asian-fusion restaurant in the middle of downtown?\" -The likely origin story of this delightful eatery in the Moline Centre.The weathered aluminum citing and rustic wood boarding which adorns the walls gives the space a comfortable yet industrial feel. You want to ask out the girl who's face you saw buried in that new Dave Eggers novel at lunch? This is where you take her. From the furnishings to the menu, the cafe firmly states \"I. Have. Taste.\" It's not showy; it doesn't try too hard. It just allows itself to be what it is... and what it is, is GOOD. On this trip, I enjoyed the chicken teriyaki. Even such a classic dish surprised me with bright interesting flavors. They advertised the Teriyaki sauce as \"a secret,\" so I'll share a secret of my own: I wasn't even in the mood for Asian food when I walked in, and I already want to come back. No matter what you're in the mood for, the Lemongrass Cafe is going to hit the spot."}, {"review_id": "0CuGdzkPEA3N97EyHMKSCA", "user_id": "aMXOT6u2WUhOSridJWK5vw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "Everything here is tasty.  Really.  In several trips we have tried the Moo Krob Gra Pow, the Pumpkin Curry, the potstickers, spring rolls, and the fat noodle.  The fat noodle was delicious, but too chewy for my taste-- that was my fault, not the noodle's.  However, you have to try the Tom Ka soup.  Lots of places make this soup, but Lemongrass has elevated it to a warm, rich, coconutty art form.  We'll be back often."}, {"review_id": "GyaeE3L2_PwDH85nJJUwPQ", "user_id": "hKBQ-PFlcB-t5FK3HUxoyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "So, this place just WORKED!  I got to Moline early evening, for a class on Rock Island the next day.  Needed to get some food in da belly, and a Yelp search came up with LemonGrass Cafe.  Within walking distance!  Asian!  Rated highly.  YESSSSSS!!!  I ordered the Pad Keemao with shrimp, which for me is pretty \"out there\".  I love, love, LOVE Korean food, so I tend to order Korean items whenever offered.  Just can't help it!  But the Pad Keemao was AWESOME!  Such good, spicy flavor, but not SO spicy that I had trouble eating it.  Just the right amount.  For me, anyway.  If you're in the area, this place deserves your visit."}, {"review_id": "vt0vzCJPE1J49AYUWagqKQ", "user_id": "lZx_XOuL5wACxaNtby4JEA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "While in Davenport, we found this spot not too far in driving distance from our hotel and with the good ratings decided to give it a shot. It's situated in a pretty nice downtown-ish area and luckily didn't have too much difficulty finding parking on the street. Once in, we were quickly seated as the cafe itself is pretty spacious.Being it was subzero temps when we visited, it only made sense to grab a nice big bowl of hot soup so I ended up doing the kimchi noodle soup and a tum yum soup for the lady. I think was bothered me the most about the kimchi noodle soup was that they used rice cakes rather than noodles and it made it feel like you were swimming around the broth to find things to eat. Definitely would've preferred actual noodles than rice cakes. Also, it's got a pretty good kick to it so if you're into spicy maybe worth a try. I didn't bother to try any of the tom yum, but will say the lettuce wraps were good to start with. Not bad for it's size and price point. Overall though I'll say we left underwhelmed after seeing this spot is a solid 4.5 star rating on Yelp. It is Asian Fusion as they do serve dishes from different Asian countries, but maybe I just ordered the wrong things while we were here. This one was a miss for me.'Til next time, cheers!"}, {"review_id": "YFqMYVkJXyqZLSxSynHfoA", "user_id": "ZoTM5-GvkU7MlNf-4DjEqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "4/13/18 phenomenal!

This is by far the best Asian fusion restaurant in the quad cities. In my humble opinion with great prices and great service.

This dish has crispy pork belly served in some famous sauce with veggies and rice. This is a must order dish. My friends order the Pad Thai to play it safe but once they tried my dish they were sold.

The dish looked good but it came out as beef cubes which I wasn't expecting. The meat didn't have much flavor but it had some sauce under it which provided the flavor. Without it, it was pretty bland. I asked for some hot sauce which the edited brought it 3 different types: homemade Sriracha looking, giardiniera look a like but had a strong citrus taste, and jalapenos. They were all good, my favorite was the Sriracha looking one. Service was good, plate was hot, place was clean from what I noticed. Parking is easy to find.

The service even when busy was outstanding, beer selection was great!  I have to say that as far as Thai goes I've tried quite a few places and thus far this is absolutely the best.

A pseudo-world traveler, former restaurant owner and lover of creative, thoughtful food - you can imagine My torture in Moline. Not that this part of Illinois is completely without culinary merit. There are some places that do simple American farmland food, and they do it well. I, however, cannot live by breaded pork \"tenderloin\" alone. After failing to find a suitable Pho place in The QC (big surprise), I stumbled upon reviews for Lemongrass. Each picture was more vibrant than the one before it, and everyone had such glowing remarks to share. Could Lemongrass salvage Moline for Me?Yes. Yes it did, can and will for as long as they're open!Nestled in what's supposed to be the heart of Moline's downtown revitalization, Lemongrass is easy to find, with limited in-front parking, but plenty in the back. You walk in and will always be greeted cheerily by staff that remembers you (albeit because we went there nearly everyday for a week and a half...). I'm not a fan of their individual metal chairs, but that's the only negative thing I have to say about this place.Food may take a few minutes longer than you're used to to get to you, but it's because their dishes are handcrafted and lovingly prepared to order, with a few exceptions. Fresh, authentic Thai and Vietnamese ingredients. Quality coconut milk in the dishes that feature it. Creative sauces to accompany their appetizers. Never a frozen vegetable in sight!I love the atmosphere, their diverse patronage, and the consistent top quality of their food and service. Their existence is an inspiration to Moline, and hope for Me that would-be restaurants in the city will see them as the Gold standard.(I've added some pics, but didn't manage to get one of their grilled chicken wings since I scarfed them up pretty aggressively. The dipping sauce served with said wings will make you feel alive - once you're not heat/spice averse!)"}, {"review_id": "PfTYw0dNVX7ke3KVZJVJ7g", "user_id": "2cDyOsX_L5Gk9Vy-KXWi8w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "I was impressed 2 of 3 times here.

I was excited to finally come here for dinner this week, and was not let down. I was half of a meager party of two, but two very efficient servers waited on our table. The restaurant space, while simple and small, was nicely decorated and I noticed a perfect-looking patio out back. The food was great.We started with an order of Buddha rolls. They came out very soon after we asked for them and were crunchy and good, and the mango dipping sauce that came with them was delicious. The Vietnamese coffee was also wonderful and worth ordering again. After taking a few minutes to peruse the menu, I decided to order pumpkin curry with chicken as my entree. This also came out fast, was full of meat and vegetables, and tasted great. Those with baby mouths should be aware that it's a little spicy. The portion size was large, leaving me enough leftover for a generous portion at lunch the following day. I'm basically obligated to return to Lemongrass, as several other items on the menu looked appealing, and my Facebook check-in is littered with recommendations from friends. It will be a chore that I undertake with great pleasure, however, because my initiation to Lemongrass Cafe was so tasty."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/lemongrass-cafe-moline?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
