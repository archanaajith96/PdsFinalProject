She memorized it and knew how to make the food and dining experience taste better. The owner and his wife gave the restaurant a personalized experience. The owner even let me in the restaurant off business hours to purchase pastries to take home from jacksonville. They care about their clients and their business.Thank you!!!!"}, {"review_id": "KBMWt4SJu6BDB79tTvatXg", "user_id": "IeIAuG13HRNznAdkXEt8lg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Food was top-notch!

When I think of comfort food, Prescott's hits the spot. The veal meatballs and pasta are my fave!! And I always make room for dessert at Prescott's...if not, I'll get it to go. You do not want to miss dessert at this place :)"}, {"review_id": "3_klvjamzFT172DJQ-9MkQ", "user_id": "BmT4D7zQjB3l-FjatA0Pmw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/12/2017", "text": "Food is the creme de la creme. First impressions go out the window. This humble environment does the chef and his phenomenal work a disservice, as there can be none better found in the Rochester area. Food quality and flavor of the plates presented to us is by far the best in town. A diamond in the rough to say the least. Perfectly balanced flavor profiles; simple ingredients; thought-out accents, such as the fried sage in our squash gnocchi. A wine menu with a simple concept 30 wines selections for $30. It engages any novice or experienced wine drinker to easily select from their offerings. A Michelin contender in this humble diner's opinion."}, {"review_id": "9jf3GNUeyXYm_NsmgEZx-w", "user_id": "Koq_xNgjmdjJ3rmmS6B0dg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/28/2017", "text": "So I am not one that typically does reviews, either good or bad. But my experience at Prescott's requires one. I did a quick search on Yelp looking for a place for dinner we were in a bit of a hurry so we didn't read any existing reviews nor really read up on it at all. We just knew that is was not a fast food joint. When we walked in the first thing to hit me was the smell of the fresh baked goods. I thought, it's a bakery. Then I looked around and thought, well maybe it's a family diner. The decorating and layout of the dining room says family restaurant. I then noticed the wine. Okay...what is this place? It smells like a bakery, looks like a family diner, has a large wine selection with a 'bar' that doesn't really look like a bar and it's in a strip mall...I studied the specials board. The waitress explained everything and how much of the produce was grown by the chef. Wow, it's a high end restaurant with fresh baked goods and a plain Jane dining room. I ordered the Walleye, the others ordered the steak. The food was FANTASTIC! What a mix of senses."}, {"review_id": "NOiJhd60fqBOLZfS7l5G8w", "user_id": "6QOrKtr42I_72DlqToEL1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "Food was top-notch. I went with an officemate to find the restaurant full of people singing happy birthdays - clearly a neighborhood restaurant. What set it apart from others were two things: the food and the servers. We ordered the appetizer with shrimp - the two sauces that it came with were to die for. I ordered Salmon while my coworker ordered Walleye - both were excellent. The chef sent a side of rice with carrots and a slight hint of garlic - you read it right - garlic. I have never had anyone cook my food with little surprises while doing the main thing so well. The chef brings his craft and passion to the plates that come out of the kitchen and it shows. Well done!"}, {"review_id": "A-HwBp4Rmxq5bKPhipg0Kg", "user_id": "zFWSHAw621_tqP0ciNZIjw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/11/2017", "text": "This is a true farm to table in every essence of the word. A quaint little restaurant in a strip mall that will knock your socks off. Our waitress was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and friendly. The first thing the brought out was a mixed bread bowl - Garlic Cibatta, Homemade Wheat and Zucchini. Each one was spectacular. I had the wedge salad next which left you wanting more. It was a nice subtle bleu cheese taste and no where near overbearing. The main course was the Veal Meatball in a cream sauce. It was to die for. Besr meatball in cream sauce I've ever had.  Overall had a great experience. Loved the farm to table setting and all the fresh vegetables they have offer. No microwave or deep fryer in the kitchen so you know it's fresh!!!"}, {"review_id": "PgppcYyS3sS1FN_6E7M-yw", "user_id": "wvIriQRyEMI31p-7dUu-wQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/28/2016", "text": "Quite possibly my new favorite Rochester spot! Definitely would not expect such a good place in this location, but Mom always said don't judge a book by its cover! Apologies up front for no pictures, couldn't whip my phone out during a business dinner :/ The chef owns the restaurant and his wife is the wine sommelier. They were incredibly friendly, welcoming, and very proud to tell their story and explain that the majority of the vegetables come straight from their farm, picked this morning. They make their (4 different types) breads, desserts and ice cream! As such, menu is seasonal and changes. I had the squash soup, which tasted like pumpkin pie! Absolutely delicious with each of the breads. For my main meal, I had the Cajun snapper($28) with quinoa and spaghetti squash. It wasn't spicy, but definitely was packed with flavor! Quite a hearty portion, which I always appreciate. And DEFINITELY save room for dessert (or suck it up and pretend you still have room!). Our chocolate turtle cake was incredible, not an outrageous portion but just enough (we split it along with ice cream), not too rich and served with delicious whipped cream. The homemade espresso salted caramel ice cream was out of this world, although admittedly wouldn't have known it was salted caramel except that was the name. Apple spice ice cream was packed full of apple slices too! Overall, very impressed with the quality of food. From the outside and even the inside decor I wouldn't expect such high quality food. On the pricier side, but they do not skimp on portions or flavor!"}, {"review_id": "lSO5dux3K6r7RuVcxGfm6A", "user_id": "C8zpzZoClShq7ae77Mxh0g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/15/2017", "text": "Prescott's is like your favorite easy chair, warm, safe, familiar; you know exactly what to expect. Overall, it's a great place for my parents or individuals of an older generation. It's a place where comfort food is well prepared using large cuts of meat, rich sauces and butter.  The ambience is cozy and somewhat intimate, but loud when busy and far from trendy.  Four types of homemade bread are offered with the meal, each more delicious than the last with my favorite being the honey wheat. Soup or salad come with the meals. Desserts are how they should be, large, rich and indulgent.  You will not leave hungry. Prescott's prepares food consistently well and they should be commended for that. I bring people here who appreciate good food but maybe aren't the most adventurous eaters. I don't frequent this establishment because it is a bit pricy (although the value is good), and the menu lacks originality/excitement.  I would appreciate more intimacy and ambience for a quiet dinner alone if I am paying these prices."}, {"review_id": "fsfzMoM-0rAeH4SV9yqk5A", "user_id": "P3JVUXhdCYIhrabbAmHB1A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2017", "text": "Prescott of Rochester is really worth the trip.  Located South of town next to a laundromat will make you think this Place is \"out of the way\" and \"odd\" but the service is great and The chef is nothing short of amazing.  Very well worth a strong positive recommendation.  Go for it and be pleasantly surprised."}, {"review_id": "cg88uZ0igGgvF7AY54ic1w", "user_id": "OvYuAL6CMWFl6BYTwuVuYA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "Better than any restaurant in a strip mall has any right to be.  Pleasant surprise in Rochester."}, {"review_id": "rdkz72jQ5b9eTQCp8P278A", "user_id": "R0YDRT0gZS9ukmX9OKx0SQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "amazing!!  farm to table. had range free chicken stuffed with crab. husband had grilled duck. delicious. breads and soup fantastic. service great too. definitely coming back."}, {"review_id": "2jzRPjMfKZ5Kf5JxprIMhg", "user_id": "pECmqbb0yi7OaQ1jvpTReQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/27/2017", "text": "What an amazing place!!!

The ambiance is quaint and simple, with the feel of a French bistro. The wait staff is courteous, professional, and attentive; you'll feel guilty, the care that you are shown while dining here. If you enjoy the complementary bread as much as I do, you can purchase a loaf for later! For an entree, I recommend the Creamy Chicken Basil. It is simply divine; a creamy tomato and basil sauce with a spicy cayenne savor that is heavenly. As for dessert, the flourless Death By Chocolate torte is sinfully decadent.
