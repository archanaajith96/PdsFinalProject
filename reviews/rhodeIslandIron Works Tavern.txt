We had the whole 2nd floor to ourselves.  I can say the establishment put good effort into working the event.  2 bartenders, multiple staff working the room and I believe the food cooked on the 2nf floor was purely for our event!  The invitation stated heavy hors d'oeuvres.  I can say Ironworks delivered above and beyond on that.When we first arrived there was a table with multiple cheese and vegetable platters accompanied with a French onion drizzle option.  It was delicious!  There was also tomato, mozzarella and balsamic on a stick.  Plus there was a spinach/artichoke dip with tortillas.  Later on in the evening there were cheeseburger sliders with a special saucy.  It was tasty!  Wontons & penne with vodka sauce.  There was plenty of food.  It all tasted wonderful.  The environment has a classy refurbished feel to it.  I have to say now it's going on my list to head back sometime for dinner!"}, {"review_id": "IzHEpnIbfEwH9f7Otmv48A", "user_id": "n5r6Qp7FLUeMkH7K6oADTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Last minute dinner on the busiest night of the year..St Patrick's Day we were still accommodated without a  reservation by the manager.Chuck was without a doubt the most gracious waiter, knew the menus front and back as well as very prompt with refills and recommendations although it was a busy night we felt like we were his only priority. The food was delicious. Hubby had scallops wrapped in bacon and chicken parmagiano when he asked for light sauce once again Chuck our waiter asked if he could explain how the sauce was made and my husband agreed, much to my surprise hubby loved it!

I ordered a Cosmo which was reasonably priced at $10 and my friends and I got one of the pizzas, calamari and truffle fries. The service at the restaurant was also great! Since we arrived closer to the end portion of the half-priced deal our server made sure to come over at 5:50 to ask if we wanted to place an order for anything else before the deal ended. I really like the decor in the bar and there seemed to be a decent mix of people there. While I enjoyed my time at Iron Works I probably would not come back for a normal meal as the menu seems a bit overpriced for the quality of the food and my budget."}, {"review_id": "C_5lNAczT7c-pMmUUSuYmw", "user_id": "e3YKpXsJkh0828evZLb2wg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "I have only come to Iron Works Tavern for half-priced appetizers (offered from 3 PM to 6 PM!) and have never been disappointed.

I stopped in for a quick meal on a weekday afternoon because it is right near my office. There's a separate entrance for the bar room which is where we sat. I really liked the vibes inside. I got the quinoa salad which was super good. It had a lot of quinoa in it with lettuce, other veggies, and balsamic glaze. It was a big portion and filled me up for awhile. My boyfriend tried the pulled pork sandwich which looked really good also. The lunch prices are super reasonable and really worth it. The parking lot is very spacious and easy to get to. I drive by it all the time and never thought to go inside. I'd definitely like to go back to try the dinner and some cocktails!"}, {"review_id": "7fNffHjCcF8kekbBNpAcDQ", "user_id": "dPLaY-t4BF7KZI9SXABg5A", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "I really hesitate in writing one star reviews but I have to be honest with this one. This was the second time I have been here and this experience was just terrible and not worth the money we spent. First of all, we went in as a party of 6 (we also said we could be split in 3 and 3) at about 7:30 pm and there were plenty of empty tables. Some had reserved signs on them but others were empty. They still gave us an hour wait. We waited, and during that time saw a small rodent (rat or mouse) scurry across the floor int he restaurant. Pretty unappetizing but we were tired and didn't want to try anywhere else at that time of night. We told the manager but there was not much of a reaction. We then went to the bar to get a drink but the bartender was noticeably curmudgeonly, with very little more to say then a curt \"here\" when handing us our drinks. In about 40 minutes, they called us to be seated. All was well at first, but after we ordered, we pretty much had radio silence from our server for the next 40 minutes, which is how long it took us to get our food. My uncle ordered a glass of wine and had to remind a server about his order after about 15 minutes.My mom and I shared the mac and cheese and the soup special: tomato saffron.  The mac and cheese was pretty good but the tomato saffron soup was basically Campbell's tomato soup with a drop or two of saffron infused oil. NOT worth the $7."}, {"review_id": "vBs2Fdh48bB9Q6IiJjEO_g", "user_id": "xJvZAMZS4j7_WJr4rwq_Xw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "Last minute dinner decision and Iron Works is always so tasty! My husband and I struggle sometimes finding a resistant we both enjoy because our food choices are so different and here he can enjoy an amazing fresh pizza while I have an out of this world got quinoa salad with scallops.

Neither of us got it tonight, but there Mac n cheese is out of this world, worth all the cheese and carbs in it! I'd recommend this to locals and travelers.

The pretzel was was a little burnt and our waitress happily switched it out which so glad I did. It was probably the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. Equal to my weekly go to Chick fil a. My husband had the roast beef sandwich and it was almost as wonderful as the chicken. My daughter had the chicken Asian noodles -equally as good. Home run guys!!!

The best are local places but you also have to put up with the idiosyncrasies that equate to \"color.\" Bars also have micro-personalities that change with the time and the day; so I think you have to take any bar review with a grain of salt.Think of it this way. Imagine going to the beach. It is very warm but the wind is blowing and it is overcast. Does the beach suck? I think not. Perhaps that part of the beach isn't for you or maybe you go another time. I think the Grid Iron is just such a place. I came in for a pre-haircut beer and found a large, somewhat dim establishment, but soon realized the management allows the natural light to do what it does best. After a few minutes it is just light enough  in here, and it is much more comfortable than bright fluorescent lights. I noticed someone made a comment about having to make their way through a throng of smokers. I only encountered four or five but they were very polite and there is an area especially set up for smokers. Besides, they are a dying breed, so we should be respectful and a little nostalgic (that is harshly ironic - could be the double IPAs). There were locals at the bar and some were using *gasp* salty language, but it is a bar, so... We had the most sexually inappropriate bartender. I wish I remembered her name as she was so over the top naughty. Ok, yes I loved her. My impression is that she knows her audience, um, clientele. I told my coworkers about her, but when they stopped in they reported that she had more than the modicum of appropriateness. I would say their loss, but they enjoyed her service just as much. This is what professional service is all about.I didn't try the food, but my coworkers also said they had very tasty lunches. All in all, if you are in the area and looking for a place to go, stop here and give it a try."}, {"review_id": "l7tJozDCI3gfngDeHeMacA", "user_id": "tKnyHY1DhxV0CYw8Ny2gxQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Always a wonderful experience.  The bartenders are fabulous and the food is always good.  Great drinks, too!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/iron-works-tavern-warwick?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
