I came here once and I love this place! The service is so so good it's eerie.  The food is  delicious...They are known for their ricotta pancakes-so we tried them and they were pretty good (though I discovered I'm more of a berries and chocolate pancake person!)

Definitely off the beaten path and it seemed like many of the other guests were regulars judging by some of the conversation they had with staff (\"Is your house ready to be sold?\"). It's a bit hard not to eavesdrop since the place is very small but the food left a BIG impression! It was delicious!! Everything came out perfectly hot and really well seasoned. I ordered the special that day; the asparagus swiss omelet with potatoes. Both items were simply perfect! Service was very friendly and thoughtful as well. Their coffee was also just the way I like..not too strong but flavorful and they refilled our cups about five times! The only reason I will give it a four is that it is really small and cozy so it made me feel a bit congested since they were really busy but everything else was spot on!"}, {"review_id": "9EARAahXeHu5Y6h43FguPw", "user_id": "bkV4p0fffknkwP46cIhjuQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/21/2017", "text": "After reading so many reviews on this place, I decided to go there and try it out myself. I love brunch so I am always excited to go to new brunch places. This place is a little hole in the wall place, it only has 12 tables so you will have to wait if you go during a rush. I ordered their eggs benedict and my boyfriend got one of their specials which was the apple pecan French toast. The eggs Benedict was quite good, along with their potatoes, they aren't your typical potatoes you get so it was a nice change. They were quite mushy so it was different but still very pleasing for I enjoy mushy potatoes. But the eggs Benedict wasn't something new or that extraordinary they were just a typical eggs Benedict taste. As for the Apple pecan French toast, I myself wasn't that big of a fan because I don't enjoy cinnamon apples but the French toast plain was quite enjoyable. They were very fluffy yet the ends still had a nice crunch to it. The pecans were Caramelized so they had a sweetness to them which made it nice to enjoy because you can eat it with or without syrup. The waitress that served us was also quite pleasing she was very nice and made sure everything was perfect. Overall, this place was enjoyable I think it was over hyped for me but yet still a nice place to eat."}, {"review_id": "M7Jf-AltNaWcMnka3np0WA", "user_id": "Dw0_5JJqVsH4JqcHMz839Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "I've eaten here several times; it's an especially nice place to go to eat, though the food tends to be caloric.

The food is great - we shared the mixed berry pancakes and it was so good!  We also each got an omelet cause hey... we're on vacation and all.  I got the Borsin cheese mushroom omelet and had it scrambled up and man, I love that stuff... I spread the cheese all over and it's perfect.  Boyfriend had something with the kielbasa sausage and it sure was tasty!  I also loved that there were cute little books on each table for you to read while you waited for your food.  Nice touch!

And you want to know why this place is amazing? Because it has amazing staff who remembers ALL of the specials and are able to recite the specials to a \"T\" without uttering a single \"umm..\" now that is skill! But the ability of memory isn't the only reason why the Hubs and I choose to make this delicious breakfast spot ours every other Saturday  --- it's because of the delicious food as well. Yes, they have your typical breakfast items for consumption as every other breakfast place but OMG.. this food is amazing. It is home made, like truly home made; that stuck your foot in it, gram's homecooking homemade food! It takes a tad bit from the time the food is ordered until it is placed in front of you but because of the freshness and amount you get. Five stars. It's pretty small and no waiting area so you are stuck in the doorway if there is zero seating but totally worth it!"}, {"review_id": "bn0k3DV2oaZCZ7Hq8Wf8cA", "user_id": "JLHmq24p976NCfb81t5LIw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/8/2017", "text": "Decided to try this place out after seeing all the good reviews and this place didn't disappoint. Small breakfast place that feels very homey wit very friendly servers. I order the eggs Benedict and the chocolate berry stuff French toast. Eggs Benedict was good the egg was cooked just right ham not to salty sauce the way it's supposed to be and the English muffin had a good chew and potatoes was seasoned just right. The French toast was delicious it wasn't too sweet and they use a French bread which was amazing. Overall this place was very good. I only gave it a 4 because this was my first time here but I'm coming but to try more and willing to give it a 5"}, {"review_id": "u814V3wvVG6Rm0m8L-kOJg", "user_id": "lG_qvk0T3oVZp-2GMRm89A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/9/2017", "text": "First time here and never noticed this place before.

The restaurant itself is very tiny, quaint and a little old fashioned. Maybe about 10 tables total. My waitress (I'm assuming one of the owners) was perhaps one of the nicest people I've ever met. She was thanking everyone for visiting them on this snowy day, paying compliments to everyone. She thoroughly went over their specials and described them so. I went with the eggs Benedict with an extra side of toast and some juice. Their juice was reasonable at $2.00. My meal was probably the best Benedict dish I've ever had. Even the extra side of toast was a thicker sliced bread served warm and buttered. After reading the little book of wisdom on my table which I loved, I watched as the tables around me dug into the first bites of their breakfast. I'll have to come back for the lemon ricotta pancakes and homemade corn beef hash. When you see people rolling their eyes because it's so good, saying it too is the best they've had, it must be a winner.

A girlfriend and I went in at 11:00 AM on a Saturday morning and the place was completely full except for two tables. No one greeted us upon walking in, so we proceeded to a table and sat ourselves. We were greeted within 5 minutes (again, it was very busy and I have been a server so I am very understanding) and we were given menus and were told of the specials that were written on a visually pleasing board. Our waitress was very pleasant and helpful. Everything on the menu sounded delicious, however I chose to go with a lemon ricotta pancake and a side of the potatoes and link sausages. I like to mix sweet and salty for my breakfast foods so I was pleased to learn they had smaller portions of their pancakes. The potatoes are the bomb here, and the link sauages were cooked just right. The lemon ricotta pancake was delicious as well-however I did not reieve any indication of the recipe containing ricotta based upon the texture/flavor-I was still very pleased. Overall our experience here was great. They also offer delicious desserts-along with things to take home such as Michigan shaped chocolates, theives products from young living, and chocolate pretzels, etc. I really enjoyed my time in this quaint envirorment packed with delicious food and excellent service. My only complaint is that it was very tight in there-however I am not sure if they would be able to keep that quaint vibe if it was a much larger place, and I wish someone would have told us to proceed to seat ourselves or there was a sign so that we didn't stand there like idiots waiting.

I really didn't like the potatoes.  I'm not sure if they cook them with bacon fat, but all I could taste was bacon. It's all about preference. Next time, I would just order the Banana Walnut Pancakes - delicious! The service was perfect. The main waitress is super sweet and friendly.
