My daughter's Pesto slab came out with black crust and very little chicken.  When I showed the cashier the black crust he just said sorry then ignored me. Did nothing.

That being said, the pizza was okay, I think it is over hyped, it was kind of undercooked and the texture of the pizza reminded me of the saggy arm skin of Biggest Loser contestants that are towards the end of the season. However, I know you're all wondering, but it did make a turd and that is what's most important. The location has no parking and there are stairs to get into the building so the establishment clearly wants no business from handicapped people. Also, the bathroom is right by the fountain drinks and nothing ruins my appetite more than the smell of a fresh laid loaf. All in all, I only went there once and might go again to try new flavors and toppings and it would be a fun place to bring a big group, but for Pizza I was not satisfied."}, {"review_id": "xbqmeY0FbABRPIoI97GkTg", "user_id": "0HDChB3WPhKPO7ekQ1yxKA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Disappointing!!! The crust was dense and chewy while being crunchy on the bottom.  Not what I'm looking for in pizza.   It's also fairly expensive!  Their toppings are creative for sure, but mine were kinda bland.  I tried the White pizza and forgot to say no sausage.  I picked the sausage off but there really was no other flavor.   I also got the Luke, which tasted only of green chilies.    I tried Slab once before and it was mediocre then too.    I don't think I'll be trying it again.   Soooo many other pizza options that are actually delicious!"}, {"review_id": "HZO9KoafIIdqsQmtZMY-qQ", "user_id": "dj6umfT9ZxjuCGU5LZVHzg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "SLAB Pizza is one of the better pizza joints in Utah County. A \"slab\" is a 1/4 of a pizza cut into 3 pieces. You follow me? Not confusing at all right? Well don't mind the lingo, and just focus on the wide variety of flavors, toppings and styles. SLAB has a pizza for everyone. And I mean it. So many options to choose from, but my favorites are the Super Duper Hawaiian, the UNM, and the White.

They really live up to their name, not only giving you a huge slice of pizza but an incredibly massive slab of it. Some of the best flavors include Tomato Basil and the Buffalo Wing. The Greek salad is also to die for as well, so make sure to make that a priority as well. I love the thin and crispy crust, giving it that little extra crunch. The flavors are awesome and UNIQUE, I mean, who else can put celery on pizza and make it as great as these guys?? The best part about it: the prices range from $5-7. Honestly, it doesn't get much better. The venue is pretty large, with long wooden tables occupying most of the space. Don't be afraid to nestle right in next to a couple of students if their isn't much space left, food brings people together, and SLAB does it right. TIPS & TRICKS: * The only downside is the location, it's right on campus and parking is pretty sparse. Good luck trying to find parking along the road--you'll definitely work up an appetite driving around. * Ask for a side of ranch, it always adds a little extra."}, {"review_id": "GrBb-u-0Tac5jhdIHd127w", "user_id": "9sBYIcC83VkN-qWTiUVrGA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/18/2017", "text": "This place is pretty good. A lot of unique pizzas available, that's for sure. So I guess if you're one to venture out and try new things, you'll be happy with the offerings at this place. I can't remember the name of the pizza that I tried, but it was spicy (it had green chiles on it) and the overall taste was really, really good. I'd say that my lone complaint would be the crust. It was just okay. And to me, that's what a pizza is all about; toppings are secondary to the crust. I say that cause to me, the crust seemed a little on the hard side. Not crispy, just hard. But even with that deficiency, the taste itself was enough to make me willing to return to try it all again. I must say, this place is the perfect restaurant for the location and it's sure to do well. This area has needed a pizza place like this for some time ow and I'm happy to see that one has finally opened up."}, {"review_id": "zrRaD_557a2NdYkxIyzZuQ", "user_id": "EcADXTXzLojEhSnK8QryQw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/23/2017", "text": "Slab is one of my favorite go to restaurants in the provo area. I love the concept and the pizza is delicious! My favorite pizza on their menu is the Thai Chicken (with added pineapple) but you really can't go wrong with the The Buffalo Chicken.  I love the relaxed environment and I usually leave feeling very full. I think you get a good amount of food for the cost.Tip: don't order a salad at Slab. Stick with the pizza.I've had good and bad experiences with the service at slab. A few weeks ago, I ordered a whole pizza and because I had my baby with me, I was having a hard time figuring out how I'd get it to my car. One of their employees helped me out to my car, which I really appreciated.The negative, one time I went to pay with a gift card that I had been given to me as a gift. When I went to pay, it said the balance on the card was $0. Since I hadn't used the card yet (I'd just received it), it had to have been an error on their end when they issued the card to the gift giver. Why would the gift giver have had a gift card with $0 on it -- especially if Slab recycles their cards after being used? I was a little bummed that they didn't seem to make any effort to fix the problem and comp my order. My other negative reviews of Slab: 1- We waited a VERY long time for our pizza yesterday, especially when it wasn't that busy. 2- If you're a first timer, their menu is VERY overwhelming. So look ahead and find what you want before you feel pressure to order.3- Their pizza needs to be eaten only fresh. If you have an desire to save some, know that your crust will be VERY tough.With that being said, the negatives aren't big enough reasons to keep me from going again. I just am putting them down in the hopes that management sees them. Anyone else can take my review with a grain of salt!"}, {"review_id": "nIcmrtC1t6KeqsJ2gjthMg", "user_id": "_iTMz44lNhdmfDjBhQuvMw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/20/2017", "text": "If you're feeling nostalgic for a college hangout pizza place, this is it.

It does get crowded on the weekends but during the week days you can get your food real quick. TRY IT OUT!

I'm not a big fan of thin crust pizza but theirs was able to hold its toppings while not having that burnt taste that we all hate.

While the pizza is passible (nothing you can't get elsewhere) I get confused at the demographic they're now catering to. The rich old white dudes of Provo? Bankrupt moms still driving Escalades? Someone please tell me; because it certainly is not the collage students it used to be. I really hope things change back to how they used to be.

What they have going for them are their unique toppings and large menu. You can get traditional Italian toppings, or you could get Thai-inspired pizza or a potato/bacon pizza. Another positive is that their pizza is all thin crust, which leaves you feeling less heavy than most pies will. We've had SLAB a dozen times, and I'd probably give them fours stars. However, our last experience was rough. We waited over 40 minutes for our slices. After asking about it, they seemed confused and flustered, then told us they'd have it ready shortly. We then saw the cashier talking to the manager and looking our way. My guess? They lost our order. Which is fine, but how they responded after and their lack of customer care left a bitter taste in my mouth (no pun). Try the White pizza, the UNM, Rosemary, Potato + Bacon or just a regular Pepperoni."}, {"review_id": "wKNzG3wOcaQlCnPMM-C7yA", "user_id": "5ZDJZ1c6Pa4Zr-vNYT7T5g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2017", "text": "Delicious!

Super chill and casual. And it's pretty cheap for how much pizza you get! The atmosphere is cool and the employees are kind and helpful. They are pretty fast at getting your food out which is always a plus! Now let's talk food.. the slice of pizza is a pretty large portion split into 3 slices. They bring your pizza out on a wax paper so you can see how it's super casual. But the pizza is heavenly it's always fresh because you get it and it's steaming hot! They have an assortment of pizzas you can choose! I personally love their BBQ chicken pizza it always has the perfect amount of BBQ sauce.. not too little and not too much and get it with a side of ranch to dip it in and oooo so good! But honestly all of their pizzas are amazing! The thai chicken pizza is a crowd pleaser and if you're feeling traditional they have a killer pepperoni pizza!
