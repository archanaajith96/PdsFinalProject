I went to this establishment for the first time last week and fell in love. The line moved quickly and my Sunday morning cravings were satisfied by a cheesy egg bagel sandwich, a mini cinnamon roll, and pimento cheese grits for a student-friendly cost. And yes, their cinnamon rolls are incredible.The energy of the place was wonderful and it was a pleasant spot to eat. It also has its own parking lot and is in a convenient location. I will 100% be back and think I might have found my new favorite brunch spot."}, {"review_id": "JSS2-ADFMmmhipgYAedIJg", "user_id": "5-0xiR1nFBIQhRDOQfEMPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "What an awesome breakfast/lunch spot. It runs like a well-oiled machine so don't let the line out the front door scare you off. It won't be a long wait! Cheap too - you can get a breakfast sandwich and a mini tool for only a few dollars. There's a few tables outside for when it's nice out but you have to be pretty lucky to snag one on a good day. The inside walls are decorated with art from local artists (mostly USC students) that are up for sale if one tickles your fancy. Parking is sparse but there's plenty of meter parking up and down Devine street. I've never had to walk more than a block or two. Lots of vegetarian options - good food for everyone! Highly recommend!"}, {"review_id": "kfgzoAwwOytzb3IMrgb_1g", "user_id": "ZPkXaTotwa_2aTojI44ozw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Decided to take myself out to brunch this Sunday. I love brunch but rarely go because all of the good brunch places are always slammed in Columbia. I've heard good things about the Devine Cinnamon Roll Deli and decided to give it a try because the fat kid that lives in my stomach loves cinnamon rolls. What I didn't realize until I got there is that there are different types and flavors of cinnamon rolls! I ordered a single serving of the Strawberry Cheesecake roll and it was enough for at least 2 people. It was sweet and gooey but didn't taste syrupy like some strawberry flavored desserts tend to be.I also ordered the patty melt sans grilled onions with their homemade sauce and it was delicious as well, but since I was eating by myself and I had killed an entire cinnamon roll already I could only eat half. Bread was nicely toasted, cheese was nice and melty and the beef was very flavorful. Thank goodness for Togo boxes. The pita chips were freshly baked and complemented there sandwich very well.Can't wait to go back and try other flavors of cinnamon roll!4/21/18 Update: Met a friend here for brunch today and had the Big D and we split a Bourbon Caramel Roll (our fave!). The line was out the door when I got there, but the line moved relatively quickly and the owner was bringing people menus and chatting with folks while we were in line which was nice. I love the Big D! I get it with Italian bread and with the eggs scrambled. The garlic spread is the perfect finishing touch. The owner is very hands-on and you can tell she is very personally vested in the quality of the food and customer satisfaction which is part of the reason why this place is so popular!"}, {"review_id": "nN7_RotYoAKlA7R2CUcfvw", "user_id": "kasWTcszBlTpo7Dped-Fvw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "You get a mini cinammon bun with every meal!! They are famous for their cinnamon buns. Everything I have gotten here is awesome. My favorite: shrimp and grits or simply their pimento cheese grits. Their prices are very affordable for the quality of the food. Service is very friendly. When I went it was packed and we waited a long while for our food but it was worth it.

The bourbon caramel roll is SO good it's life changing. Don't even get me started on the breakfast sandwiches. I literally can't even. They're all delicious af. My personal favs are the big max and the cheesy egg. Definitely on sour dough with a runny egg. I would eat here every day except I wouldn't be able to fit through the door. I'm a fat kid at heart and this place is like heaven. Weekends get ridiculously busy.

If you've been once you know how great it is and you'll be back as often as possible. The menu is huge, offering everything from sandwiches and salads to hotdogs and soup. The key here (major finesse alert) is to do the pick 2 combo. You get to choose from any half sandwich (specialty or build your own), a hotdog, a panini, soup or small nachos. On top of all of that you still get a side of devine chips AND a mini cinnamon roll all for $8-9! this is such a deal because most of these items by themselves (still with chips and mini roll) cost around $7-8! I could talk about the sandwiches, because they are all great, but let's talk about the Devine Chips. They are divine (pun intended) little pita-like chips that are tossed in Italian herbs/spices and sprinkled with parmesan and romano cheeses. These things are seriously addictive, and sometimes i look forward to eating these more than the actual food! Just do yourself a favor and go give them a try, go early though because they are only open Tuesday to Sunday from 7am - 2pm! We will be featuring them on our instagram page @redplatespecial !"}, {"review_id": "1CCwWBbvaw006nVGIul0lA", "user_id": "dOxym6d93GacDgqQjL0lCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Outstanding.

The line may be long, there may be no parking (you can find it on the street with a little determination - which you should have because you're about to get a cinnamon roll), but that won't slow us down one bit. We've each tried one thing for lunch and one for breakfast - I think I liked their lunch sandwiches a bit more, but all the food here is good. AND with each sandwich, you get a mini-roll, like I said in all caps. It needed to be re-enforced. Next time I come here I'll make sure to give more detail about the food, because the menu is large and varied and has lots of savory options. ... But you get a cinnamon roll. In multiple flavors.

We won a gift card for $25 last summer and used half of it this morning. I'd had a mini cinnamon roll from here at the beginning of last summer and was highly unimpressed. The cinnamon roll had gotten cold and was hard, dry and too sweet. The roll this morning, however, was huge, warm, moist and CHEAP. Y'all, I cannot get over the fact that this baby head-sized cinnamon roll is $2.50. (This specialty kind with toppings are $3.25). We ordered two and got all of the toppings in containers on the side for 75¢ each. One roll was sweet and filling for everyone when split three ways. Today's experience made a more positive impression, but I still have a different favorite cinnamon roll in town. Maybe, as I try more here, I will enjoy it more."}, {"review_id": "zueyiHyt9N1xZ_nbId-yIA", "user_id": "SFp0EpO3taiWVOAukqseOQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Service is terrible, food is subpar.

This place has been packed every time I go, and I just can't really understand why. Sure, who can resist a face sized cinnamon roll that weighs the same as a newborn baby? However, the chili hot dogs leave you feeling slightly sick with their poorly made chili topping and their dry sandwiches leave you begging for more water. The organization is also terrible inside. If it's your first time there, go to the left and when you order... well I really don't know what to tell you. There won't be any tables most of the time so enjoy standing around 15 other people waiting 45 minutes for their food to come out while being run into by a group of college students every 15 seconds.I will say... if you want something decent, go here.

You get so much food for so cheap, and the food is great, too! Upon walking in, there's a really large menu. If you can't find something you like, you can always build your own sandwich. I had a breakfast sandwich (I forgot the name) with two eggs, bacon, cheese, and sourdough bread. It was so good! It was a little oily, but it didn't feel heavy the way fastfood often does. Everything you order comes with a mini cinnamon roll. The cinnamon roll was great, too! Although I have a horrible sweet tooth, I wouldn't want a large cinnamon roll for just myself; the cinnamon rolls could've been cooked a little further, but they were still pretty good.One thing I didn't like, though. I asked my cashier if I could have coffee, and she gave me the larger cup without asking which size I wanted. I ended up paying more than I wanted to, even though the menu is pretty cheap. The coffee wasn't bad. I had the \"Southern pecan\" coffee and it was pretty good."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-devine-cinnamon-roll-deli-columbia?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
