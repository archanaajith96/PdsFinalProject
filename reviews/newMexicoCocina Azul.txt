I had the brisket relleno and my husband had the adovada (pork) relleno. Both were delicious! Rice and beans were good too.Definitely do the checkin for the free chips and salsa - homemade chips and incredible red and green salsa.Hot sopapillas at the end were a perfect ending.

Insanely good. Super spicy. Almost too hot for this chile head. Could have been the hangover belly, but more likely the portion sizes because but I couldn't finish my food. We also ordered a lot because everything on the menu looked delicious. It was. I ate a takeout order from this place back when they first opened. It wasn't super memorab, but after today's visit, we will be going back again, and again, and again....The service was a little spotty but the kid was busy and he was super nice so we didn't care. My other half got the chicken fried steak & eggs. I got the carne adovada, side of beans and we got a bowl of the creamy green chile chicken soup. The \"gravy\" they put on the steak is the soup, sans chicken and the adovada is out of this world. As per usual, super tender and flavorful... but that chile! Oh my god! The bottomless chips and \"salsa\" was just blue/whit corn chips with one bowl green chile one bowl red. I was actually in the mood for salsa so that part was a bit strange to me, but still, didn't care. It was amazing. I'm pretty sure the words I heard while reviewing the menu were \"if their food is as good as they make it sound, I wanna eat here everyday!\" Maybe not every day, but I'm currently having my leftovers, writing a review then sending out text messages to see who wants to go eat there again with me this week... and maybe the next, and the one after that too. So much yum. After several more visits I have had the opportunity to try several other menu items. The queso is to die for. If there are only two of us, it's a bit much with meals so I would recommend sharing an entree if you also get the queso. The brisket tacos are incredible. It seems pricey but you get three (large tacos) and the brisket is tender and flavorful without being too fatty or chewy. If you're looking for a great value, and you like breakfast food any time of the day, the huevos rancheros and breakfast burrito is a sure bet and super affordable yet filling! I still can't get over how affordable (and large) the chicken fried steak is. Under $10 and worth every penny. I still haven't been able to finish it in one sitting. I also tried the brisket green chile cheeseburger and failed. The monstrous burger was delicious but I couldn't take on that much food. It's fine, the leftovers were still amazing. The wait staff is very friendly and I haven't had a bad experience with any one of them, but the greatest experience is always with Luis. He has a way of making my fiancé and I feel like family when we go in. He's attentive and helpful. Always there exactly when you need it, but not overbearing and doesn't hover. He just gets it right and it makes the whole dining experience spot on! He has spoiled us because when we go and he isn't working, we kinda feel like we are missing something. If you haven't tried this place yet, you need to. And I have learned that my spice tolerance during the first trip was definitely the hangover belly. The chile is still hot, we were actually having dinner and overheard a customer bring back a takeout order because it was too hot for her, but it's delicious. The do say \"get your chile on\" so be prepared! They did make it right for her though so that's pretty cool. Even more reason to keep going to this place."}, {"review_id": "ujZt9v9Q5dAZbD7CVcPu6Q", "user_id": "nT-sNbcZDDo_9cWBPQSMQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "What an awesome dinner. I can relate to the positive reviews and agree with their 4.5 overall rating.... They deserve it!!!!Alfredo took care of our foursome. They don't take reservations, but I called before coming, and he had water glasses set for us as we arrived.He went above the call of duty and gave us a tostada shell stuffed with hot melted cheese, on the house!!! We all devoured this.Our food arrived, and two diners struggled to finish their meals and eventually gave up, eagerly taking home leftovers for the next day. I perservered, are everything, and left stuffed with glee.Service was great. Quality of food was great. Quantity of food was great.

Let me tell you.... I am so glad that we did!  This place has really come a long way!  Service has greatly improved and the food is just really delicious!Chips and salsa here is a must.  I am usually a fan of the green, but red salsa is my vice here! It has super addictive properties, because honestly it is super delicious!  It is not overly spicy, and it is just perfect. The colored chips are great, and it is an added bonus if you get the queso!For my past two visits, I have eaten Avery's sopapilla \"pizza\" dish.  No this is not your traditional tomato sauce and cheese. It is a beautiful New Mexican paradise.  Basically you get two tasty sopapillas, beans, chile con queso, meat (chicken or beef), and chile... Have I said enough yet?  Well if you aren't salivating yet, you best run over there and try it!  This is now my go-to dish here!  I will refuse to order anything else!  It is so darn good, and the best part is, it's so huge that you can eat this plate for at least 2-3 days due to the leftovers.  Yes this plate is large enough to share (if you are into that kind of thing). So along with this dish you get two sides and honestly, I totally recommend the calabacitas and the beans.  The calabacitas are delicious!  You have to give them a try!  If you haven't dined here, you are missing out!  Give this place a try!  *Also if you are into tea, they serve hot tea from a local tea company!  That too is very delicious!"}, {"review_id": "Dk8TcWN0phU2a5fmK34Okw", "user_id": "yU5TuZiKiG7VTgNGlffsYg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Amazing food and great service.

Our Yelp searching led us to Cocina Azul, and eating here was a fantastic way to start our trip. We ordered the carne adovada relleno and the creamy chicken enchiladas. Both were served in hearty portions, which we all had trouble finishing. The carne adovada was quite tender and flavorful, and pairing it with the richness of the cheese and the light bitterness of the chili made for a great, unique combination. The creamy chicken enchilada was, as to be expected, extremely creamy - almost like inside of a chicken pot pie. Both came with generous side dishes. We ordered the fideos, a sort of pork soup that featured tender chunks of pork in a salty broth, and the calabacitas, which was a light dish of squash zucchini that was a refreshing side bite when the carne adovada got too heavy. A great amount of food for less than $15 per entree. The best part had to be the sopapillas though. This was my first time having them, and I was blown away. The dough was flaky and slightly crispy, and melted in my mouth. I drizzled honey over it and nearly passed out. Overall, a great start to our trip, which introduced us to some really novel flavors we don't typically get in NY."}, {"review_id": "s_9XQRtpPMKKADnjIaPhsw", "user_id": "DbsiQQw9h9XmYhza6Nvemw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Stopped in Cocina Azul because the Yelp reviews were pretty good and I was definitely not disappointed!
