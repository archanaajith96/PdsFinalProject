OKC is famous for Onion Burgers. And this is where you come to get one.Why? Nic's are unequivocally some of the best burgers on the planet. That is, if you get to try one. The service here is pretty unusual, and can be a real... experience. Nic is a social guy and makes friends easy. But and he doesn't have as much of a handle on all the food as he thinks he does LOL.The guy with dreadlocks who works here is such an angel. He's so sweet and I think he had a crush on me. Nic should delegate the calling of the shots to him.But Nic makes burgers with unrivaled, greasy, spectacular skill. These burgers are heaven. Greasy, gooey perfection. Excellent fries too, the thin and curly kind.15 mins to take my order, and it seems random, rather than \"in order\". Once he did take my order, it was about 5 min until the burger was ready. They don't take phone orders and.. oh wait. Did I just miss my turning? I hope not but I think I may have. No I didn't. I got lucky.Anyway the burger was absolutely miraculous. Could not have been any better. Both times, there were issues. First time, I received somebody else's order (with extra stuff that I didn't pay for). Got Jalapenos and french fries I didn't buy. The second time I came here, Nic befriended me and we had a long chat about music. That part was great, but we didn't appreciate the part where we got charged a few dollars extra because we shared a burger. I mean, when I do share a single order with someone, I always tip double (or triple sometimes). And the alternative for us was not ordering twice as much, but skipping it completely, since we were going to 3644 other OKC food places that day, only in town for one day, etc.So while I adore Nic's, my strong advice to them is to see customers as their friends rather than someone trying to screw them over (such as, partaking in the heinous crime of splitting a burger). And if you do want to split a burger, I recommend getting it to go, then there's no extra charge. They might do it that way because there are hardly any seats in here, but when we were there it was late and half the place was empty by the time we got our food. So it left a salty taste in the mouth.Oh wait that was the burger.Oh wait that *wasn't* the burger. Damn I knew that guy liked me!Really though I'm in love with Nic's burgers, and just trying to be helpful. I'm not genuinely peeved or complaining, although obviously every owner should listen to me about everything ;)Fries were okay the first time, amazing the second time. Burger was consistently spectacular. Every bite was juicy and greasy and delicious and falling apart. Perfect meat, perfect toppings, perfect bun. Lots of onions on there and wonderful. It was definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had.If I did live in OKC, between the wait, the claustrophobia, the charge to split a burger, and the soaring calorie count, I wouldn't come here weekly or anything. But I'd want to. Because it's simply one of the best burgers I've had in my life.So if McDonald's has lost its THRILLAnd sh**ty Shake Shack just made you ILLAnd the Burger King left you nothing in his WILLAnd Wendy's tastes like Dr. PHILAnd In N Out just went DOWNHILLAnd Five Guys is a porno, not a burger MILLAnd that Gastropub got 5 stars from another SHILLAnd you don't have the money to fly to BRASILTo get your X-Tudo and Acai FILLAnd you're mis-educated like LAURYN HILLI can tell you a great burger, with no FRILLThe juiciest thing this side of SEVILLEIt's the burger with everything from Nic's GRILL(But after you eat it, get on the f***ing Treadmill)(And if your arteries didn't get clogged yet, they soon will)"}, {"review_id": "dSy7h-eZlSM1i6VTtrXaLA", "user_id": "jkM_jFcUL_nxMlRwFZpVnw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "Loved the food, as always, however, I can't get over the fact that there is no bathroom at this location.

It's one of those places that lives in the hearts and memories of so many OKC'ers that it can't be replicated by any other burger place--it just can't. Not having grown up in OKC, the Legend of Nic's, this tiny little hole-in-the-wall burger place, was at the forefront of conversation in my social circles when OKC'ers heard I was into the Yelp thing. It's magical & mystical, the allure this place has for locals; something a transplanter like me can appreciate since I have a place (or two) in my hometown that has the same spell cast upon me. (Carl's Drive In, St. Louis, MO) So I get it. Their deal exclusively and unapologetically burgers & fries. Burgers & fries. CASH ONLY. Burgers & fries.  You walk into a tiny little place that has mostly bar seating and probably seats around a dozen or so folks at a time. There's the grill masters behind the bar who are wizards of cooking up greasy spoon food in all it's glory. It's a traditional sort of place. You can order sweet or unsweetened freshly brewed tea, Coke, regular or diet, Dr. Pepper, Sprite, and the like. You can order your burger \"with cheese and everything\" which includes cheese, mustard, mayo, iceberg lettuce, tomato, pickles, and grilled onions, or some combination there of.  The food is served hot and tasty, but the real magic is in the shared experience of everyone whose in there with you. You are a character in a real life play--that's the unforgettable part; or magical if you will. I would say, I tend to like a \"cleaner\" burger. Next time I'll opt out of the grilled onions, hold the cheese, and stick with as many fresh veggie toppings as possible. And don't miss the fries--hot & fresh, they are worth the calories, but do split them with someone.  But really go for the experience of what Nic's is. Embrace the moment. Be there. Don't be that person on your phone the whole time.  When you go, you are a part of bringing the magic to Nic's. You'll remember the experience and how it made you feel, the food brings us together, like it so often does, and is exactly what you'd expect--tasty greasy spoon food.To the grill masters at Nic's: Thanks so much for brining us into the tradition of Nic's. It was a pleasure to get to spend time with you. I really enjoyed my experience. I'll be back and this time I'll remember to bring cash so I don't have to walk across the street to use the ATM."}, {"review_id": "EbPN_anCSthUjr7F2_1Oqg", "user_id": "StcH7uXFfTyVcLeeIBRtfw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "BEST BURGER IN TOWN!!

I met the other ol' St. Nic today and had my way with his delicious burger! Nic's Grill is a cute and super tiny space that's full of character and filled to the brim with the aromas dancing off of that killer grill! I liken it to a \"tiny house\" in restaurant form. Every inch of the place is efficiently used and Nic has a well oiled machine here. I still don't know how-- even though I witnessed it with own eyes-- he times the burgers and fries (that are made to order, and said orders are personally taken by Nic as he mans the grill without skipping a beat) so perfectly. During our visit, the hubs and I were amazed at how many people continually packed themselves into Nic's, and without batting an eye, he fed 'em and sent 'em on their merry way. It's truly a sight to behold! If only all restaurants could operate with this type of efficiency, and only with a 2-person staff to boot?!? I can't even.*end rant* Sorry, now about that burger. It was EPIC! You know the juicy, grilled onion-y, cheesy, bacon-y, FAT burger with juice running down your hand that you dream about, but feel too guilty to eat. Yep, I did that today and OWNED that b*%@ch! The hand-cut curly fries were a great accompaniment also. Hats off to you, Nic... you're a true American hero! (Oh and thanks for pausing for the selfie!)

There were also a few tables sitting snugly against the wall.  Everyone is within arm's reach but it's kinda cool...a little burger community.  It is ***CASH ONLY***. So be advised!Down side. The flavor isn't great.  The caramelized onions lacked flavor (didn't think possible). The fries were curly shoestring bits and very difficult to eat.  I had to get a fork to spear 6-7 bits in order to eat them.  The burger was fat and tall but needed a sauce or some special zing in order to make it special.  Very greasy. The center of my husband's burger was raw. We asked to have it cooked longer and the staff was great to make it right.

The grill and seating is actually pretty clean and nice, if even cramped. The cooks (2 of them) handle the orders , cooking drinks and payment. It's all personal, quick and friendly. The food was good. The burger was big and full of medium well cooked beef. I had it with everything and it was well stocked with all the dressings you'd expect. It wasn't amazing, and the beef wasn't the juiciest I've ever had but still good. The fries were short thing curly style, with pieces and gathered in a debris style onto the plate.This is my second stop at Nic's while stopping on a cross country journey. It was worth it to experience it, but I probably wouldn't stop again. Good enough to try, but not enough to keep coming back, at least not for the burger.I noted they do have a second item on the short menu now-- chicken fried steak.

Been rated as one of the top 10 burger places in the NATION, and hands down the best burger in Oklahoma. Got here at 1045 on a Thursday and was able to walk right in and grab a chair which is unusual - on prior visits I've been used to waiting in line outside anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. Sat right in front of the grill and watched the handmade patties, mounds of onions and fresh green jalapeños cook with my mouth watering. Burger was piping fresh and juicy as always. Highly recommend the jalapeños here, they're different than a lot of other places - vibrant green and with a nice kick. Fries are good with the seasoning provided at the table. Nic also has a crazy good memory! Made conversation with me and remembered my name even though it'd been over a year.

The good: I left the waitress a 21% tip because I knew it wasn't all her fault. I hope the staff at the original location have jobs and are successful because it was clear that whomever prepared our burgers didn't have a clue what they where doing. 7-26-17Returned to Original Nic's today. It was closed due to one of the key employees needing to be off. Nic cooked the burgers and fries himself. They where perfect. Also the fries here are curly fries.
