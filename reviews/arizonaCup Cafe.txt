It was delicious! I wish I wasn't dining alone because I wanted to try other dishes like the baked eggs. Sunday brunch here is never a bad idea. Very nostalgic at the Hotel Congress.

Usually when I think about Hotel Congress I imagine a crazy packed patio with loud music and tequila or dos XX. This was my first time visiting hotel Congress in the morning! Cup cafe is the cutest restaurant located within the hotel with fantastic food! I had the iced horchata latte for the first time which I've been meaning to try for awhile - it was so delicious and creamy and perfect for the hot weather. I also got the verde chilaquiles with the vegan sausage instead of pork. It comes in a really hot caste iron and had the perfect portions of eggs, \"meat\", tortilla, and salsa. The dish came with a side of fruit which was also very delicious. I'd definitely recommend trying this place out, it's fun! The only downfall is the wait so I would recommend visiting earlier in the morning opposed to 11:00am when the wait could possibly run up to two hours!"}, {"review_id": "Lv4Z_soLe83IVZ0pHz2Eaw", "user_id": "YwUZMCsGcfAveFK15J4Pxg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "This place has been in my yelp bookmarks for the longest and I finally got to try it before moving back to Phoenix!

To be honest I can't remember what I ordered for breakfast but I do remember how tasty the baked eggs my boyfriend ordered were! I'm pretty sure they've won an award so definitely worth trying. For dinner I had the Thai Fisherman's stew. Delicious, but nothing out of this world.Cup Cafe is perfect if you have someone new in town you wanna show around Tucson.

(also happy to find a close parking spot). We sat outside on a balmy night that turned a little chilly later on (yeah outdoor heaters!)We had the good fortune to get Harley as our waitress - friendly & personable - she really helped set the mood for us to enjoy our meal. I loved the unusual cocktails offered - trying the Perfect Pear $11 & the Ghost Orchid $5 - I enjoyed them both. The Stuffed Dates $8 were unusual (I like to try things) - meaty & mushy with a tomato-y bbq sauce - okay. My husband loved his stuffed mushrooms $8 - I stole one & it was delicious. We went onto the Chicken & Gnocchi $21 for me (huge serving - I took over half back to hotel for our lunch the next day) & Pesto Pasta w/beef $23 for him. The chicken was a little dry; the beef perfect - the other components delicious. We took dessert back to the hotel - key lime pie $7 & carrot cake $7 - yummy.We both have very happy memories of our experience here."}, {"review_id": "-1flCcLptjDj60ht-2M1xg", "user_id": "mEpHymXuy2_LJewM7Tn1hw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "AMAZING.

From their exquisite ambience to their quality, unique food. All of the food was rich and I was really impressed. You can tell they put an immense amount of effort in the craft of their food overall experience. Firstly the thing that amazed me was their service I can't recall a moment when my water wasn't refilled instantly or I was served promptly. I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich which was so well put together. It came on fresh pieces of toast with a well seasoned chicken breast with lettuce and sprouts as well as an amazing spicy slaw (which wasn't very spicy lol) the sandwich had hidden notes of mint which was personally my favorite part the mint went so smoothly with the crispiness of the sandwich and it has such a good bite. My fiancé ordered the huevos rancheros and it came with potatoes which were some of the best seasoned flavored potatoes I've ever had. Very rich and golden potatoes amazing find."}, {"review_id": "1gYgiN6LS2oDhfOIolQ-FA", "user_id": "t1HdYXIzIuooNDXC09iiBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/15/2017", "text": "Oh my! This place was some pretty good brunch options and was one of my go-to places for brunch when I lived in Tucson!!! Located in Hotel Congress, Cup Cafe has the feels of a \"hole in the wall\" cafe diner but has the modern cuisine to back up its reputation. Most of the breakfast items are served in a cast iron skillet. The cast iron baked eggs served with leeks is SOOOO good! Dipping your toast in there is the best! The ooey gooey cheese that's fused with the gravy-likesauce makes the flavor of dish. Their country style potatoes are pretty good too! The Creole Breakfast and the Silverside Hash are also really good options to get when eating brunch here too! Overall I feel like you can't go wrong with the options that are presented at Cup Cafe for brunch but then again, I haven't had all of the options yet. The area is very small, so be sure to get there really early, or be ready to wait for awhile to get seated. Tips:Things to order: cast iron baked eggs, creole breakfast, and the silverside hash.
