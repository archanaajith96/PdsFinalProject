My experience with Indian food is out towards Boston, where every restaurant really nails it. Out here in the Western part of the state, though, everyone makes their sabzi and korma totally differently. It all tends to be on the sweet side, with random nuts and raisins in food that really shouldn't have it.  However- artistic licensing with food is totally fine.Panjabi Tadka, however, makes food the way that the Indian aunties and uncles who taught me to cook do. Everything is so homestyle (with the restaurant flourish of being creamier). Their sabzi is all amazing and not over the top 'shahi' style. If you go, try the papri chaat- it's so amazing. Their pakori are great too. The coconut soup is a wonderfully cardamom spiced slightly sweet soup perfect for starting the meal. We tend to get the chicken 65, or chicken vindaloo and have never been disappointed. If I remember correctly their dal makhani is great too. Out of every restaurant in/near the valley- this is the one that does it best. Forget the spots in Northampton.Also- to refute what another user has rated: Every time we come here, there are plenty of Indian folks eating here. Unlike the other spots, which are usually only white American filled."}, {"review_id": "Nicjio3SnjwU5RdQ5XnHTA", "user_id": "Ih4tIiycN-ca46AarKdNuw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Great atmosphere!

We shared orders of vegetable samosas, garlic naan, chicken korma, and baingan bharta. Everything was delicious--well spiced, great texture, and cooked to just the right degree of doneness. The place was quiet (just a few other tables occupied), and the service was attentive, but without hovering.

Have tried some of the Indian restaurants here in Springfield, and in my opinion this was the most dissatisfied visit to any Indian restaurant. No wonder our Indian friends did not recommend going here.Don't get us wrong..the decor is great, the ambience is nice..eve the staff is very helpful. The food though...no wonder there are no Indians verifying the 4 star Yelp rating that this place boasts.Our lamb boti curry and the butter chicken preparation was exactly the same. These are 2 different preparations with distinct flavours. But here they looked exactly the same and even tasted the same. Granted that Indian cuisine does depend a lot on the preparation...if this restaurant's prep is the same for the 2 the waiter should have informed us.The chicken in the butter chicken was good. The lamb in the lamb prep was like shoe leather. So if you do end up here...stick to chicken.For appetisers...try to stay away from tandoori chicken. It's pretty dry here unlike the juicy tandooris we have gotten used to.For dessert we got the fried dough in sugar syrup...gulag jaman...tough in the center.I messed mentioning the daal makhani...lentils was not upto the mark either.The amritsari fish was good though.So unless you have not yet tried good India food...stay away from this joint. Try the other Indian/Pakistani restaurants."}, {"review_id": "okbsnzck0HGykIXZZOqEzw", "user_id": "uUVrIQ4f6KcIOO6xA0cgjA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/22/2016", "text": "I like a restaurant with family artwork. Here, you get a lady in a sari on the wall, and a little mandala-type piece on every table. I feel like that encapsulates the place pretty well -- homey and genuine. (If the artwork isn't done by a member of the owner's family, I would be shocked!)The lunch prices are entirely affordable ($6.50 for a vegetarian entree with rice and 1 papadam). We tried the chana aloo (chickpea curry, anyway) and vegetable korma, as well as the onion naan. Each dish was nicely seasoned and in a reasonable portion. \"Medium\" spice was perfect for me, as I like a little chili flavor without having to gulp water. We walked away full enough after a 2 p.m. lunch to pretty much skip dinner. We would like to come back for dinner sometime. Miscellaneous notes: Music is Indian and at a reasonable volume. Just what I'd expect, and I liked it.We were among the last guests at the end of what appeared to be a pretty busy lunch rush, but it did take quite a while to get our food -- longer than I expected, but not absurd. Most, but not all, of the table settings had napkins, and I had to dart over to an unoccupied table and grab some after we realized there weren't any at ours, and there wasn't a waiter in sight to ask for fresh ones. (Perhaps a previous diner's doing the same thing was to blame for our missing serviettes.) Another small oddity that I couldn't quite puzzle out -- there was a bag of frozen Pillsbury biscuits visible when I walked back to the bathroom. I couldn't care less if they use them for something, but I wonder what? Maybe that's what the staff eats for lunch?"}, {"review_id": "VKGUwlfRzrBCHSHRDEsFfw", "user_id": "l7EXWmQvZIfA0k77HNB61Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/7/2017", "text": "Cant speak on the meat dishes, but the vegetarian dishes are bland and lacking.
