I heard from many fellow vegans that this place has a lot of vegan offerings. I ordered the chicken curry wrap. After I started eating it I had to ask the waitress if she was sure the meat wasn't chicken as it had the same texture. She assured me it was and said that everybody asked her that because it is so hard to tell. It was delicious! Just the right amount of curry spiciness. Can't wait to go back and try their pizza!!!Made a return visit for lunch with friends. I ordered the vegan Stromboli with broccoli, shredded carrots and pineapple. It was delicious! My only complaint was that the marinara sauce served with it was cold and would have been better hot. Won't stop me from returning again soon.Made two more return visits and ordered the vegan chicken pesto pizza which is SO delicious! My non-vegan husband  shared the leftovers both times and admitted it was great!"}, {"review_id": "hVsGOEAhQjbCwz36RG0C2Q", "user_id": "e0CYyOmS9QQaVycG74uFTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Went there based on numerous sites that included Mitten as one of the best pizza places in GR. I ordered the chicken pesto pizza. Three things stood out - the flavor of everything combined, the amount of toppings on the pizza, and the crust. All were done with excellence which make a great pizza! The beer is very good as well. I had the Country Strong IPA which went well with the pizza. Good level of hops added with a slight hint of citrus.

The pizza flight, if made on GF dough would be a winner me thinks.The service was fair.Leaving more full and pleased than when we arrived, twas not a loss, nor a bad decision."}, {"review_id": "OFlijIxv_1I0IYuGt_KKoQ", "user_id": "hs8DpwHhp204x4tmuZR5ww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "I can't believe it took me this long to make it to the Mitten! I really wish they were closer to the center of downtown so I could walk.Even on a Sunday night, there was about a 30min wait. The dining area is pretty small so the tables fill up quickly. They have some seats available to wait as well as barrels to stand around while enjoying a drink until the table is ready.We tried to impossible burger as well as a pizza flight. As a plant based burger, the impossible burger was actually pretty impressive.The Pizza flight is something I was excited to try. It was hard to choose 6 different specialty pizzas because they all sound unique and amazing.We ended up going with the westerdog, Thai Cobb, pesto chicken, hog heaven, Margherita, and the Mac daddy. Our favorite of the 6 was probably the Thai Cobb or westerdog. Don't get me wrong, they were all interesting and tasty.As a baseball fan, this place was awesome to walk around and read some of the Tigers memorabilia. They have old 1984 newspapers framed and signed jerseys.Overall, this might be one of my favorite breweries in Grand Rapids!"}, {"review_id": "TZ6XoO3Q3d0dFtMPsFkYCw", "user_id": "oxHJ6p8-HTt7SdFyXhRFAw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Had the vegan hog heaven pizza with a side of ranch and a side of tavern cheese and it was AMAZING!

There was a decent crowd on hand. I secured a spot at the end of the bar and looked over the beer menu. I opted to do a tasting flight and selected the following Ales:Mitten Pale Ale (5.3% ABV)Relief Session IPA (4.5% ABV)Country Strong IPA (7.0% ABV)Dock's No-No DIPA (9.0% ABV)'84 Imperial Red IPA (8.4% ABV)The beer is served on a wooden beer tray that is the \"Mitten\" or the shape of Michigan.All of the Ales were tasty and well executed - with the exception of the Country Strong IPA. I am an IPA fan - and this one came across as flat and weak. I asked the bartender about it - she tasted it and agreed. I think they changed out the keg - and she gave me another one to try - it seemed like it was better, but by then my palate was a bit \"wrecked.\" Will have to return and try that one first next time I am in town.I enjoyed all of the other Ales - I'd order a Pint of any of them and enjoy them!Beware of one of the bartenders - I ordered a glass of water as well - and she attempted to douse me with it - but due to my quick reflexes, I managed to evade her attack. Just kidding, she knocked over the glass - and all the water missed me for the most part - but I did take advantage of the opportunity to tease her about it the rest of the night! She was very apologetic.Great beer! Nice people! Good service!

They have a nice, large inside seating area, and a nice amount of patio seating. They have two stories, however the upper deck wasn't open when we were there as it was a Wednesday around lunchtime. We each got a flight of beers, which were 5 oz pours for a nice price. They separate their beers into tiers, with nicer beers costing more, so I could get 4, 5 oz pours for only about $6(!!). For food, we split the spinach and artichoke dip. I thought it was delicious, and the chips that came with it were superb. I highly recommend this, and it was a fair price. We were coming off a pizza binge when we arrived, so we did not order any; however, the pizza looked amazing.One final thing, this bar loves baseball. Most of their bar, including the names of the beers, were themed around baseball. What's not to love??

The pizza I got was 1/2 margherita and 1/2 \"curse of the goat\" in which I switched out banana peppers for artichoke and it was fantastic.I got \"cascade\", the cider. It's really red, it looks like Rubeaus. I wouldn't compare it to that though. There isn't a trace of beer flavor in this cider and it is absolutely delicious. I'm definitely bringing my growler next time.**Random side note: I like my pizza with ranch and their ranch here is more like a thick aioli.. Also, their pizza is NOT good warmed up.. and that sucked.

Sorry.  It's also called the Mitten. So at least you know the level of creativity before you visit. (I.E very little).If you do love it, then chances are you're from Grandville, or Lowell. You're probably visiting friends \"Downtown\" and you feel like you need to enjoy it in order to not be rude. Or you have pretty low standards.That's the only reason why I can think people love sorta burned, under-covered and haphazardly assembled pizza, a huge bar wait; and a loud, busy, uncomfortable space.It is easy, basic and approachable. So probably a decent spot to meet friends. One of which has a wife that thinks red pepper is spicy and wears a jacket that says \"North Face\" on the shoulder. I think they also have gluten free crust for her.Peppinos Downtown literally has better pizza by a long shot... and Peppinos sucks as a restaurant. Only difference at Mitten is you get twice the wait to sit down, three times as much burnt smoke smell, and 5 more beers that \"just ran out\".Oh, and a giant bathroom line.Service has always been really good, and they do have a good beer selection. Food is college dorm level. Probably the best choice on Leonard though, and nice addition to the neighborhood.

My initial impression was well short of favorable. In the years since, I've never been particularly interested in returning, though I have tried the occasional Mitten beer on tap elsewhere, and the quality seems to have improved marginally. I had lunch there today at the insistence of an former local who was in town and wanted to return to a place she swore made the best pizza in town. As my rating evidences, I do not share this opinion. First, and perhaps most importantly, the beer. They have roughly sixteen beers on tap, as well as a couple of guest ciders. Their beers are broken into three pricing tiers, and all are available as either samplers or full sized pours. The samplers are priced individually, and range from $1-3, with a 25% discount on Mondays. At least when I went, a majority were priced at $1, and only two of them hit the high $3 mark. The pricing on their $1 and to a lesser extent $2 samplers is reasonable, though the $3 ones seem excessive, especially given the quality of beer produced by Mitten Brewing. The sheet they give you to fill out has space for six beers, so I ordered a half dozen different beers for $8. In terms of quality, they ranged from quite bad to adequate but below average. Particularly sad was The Stretch, their so-called cream ale, which is more like an American Adjunct Lager than the style they allege it to be, and therefore tastes more like PBR than a proper cream ale. Also quite weak was West Coast Swing, one of the most indistinct Amber ales in recent memory. Better though still unimpressive were the Schwarzstop, Put Me in Kolsch, Triple Crown Brown, and Mango Gold. In terms of diversity of style, they offer more than many breweries, just by virtue of the fact that their tap list isn't 80% IPAs. And I give them credit for attempting an English Dark Mild Ale. But it is unfortunate that there wasn't a single sour on tap; despite their description of Mango Gold as a tart wheat ale, it could be mistaken for being tart only if using their other obviously not tart beers as a reference point. To be sure, there are far worse breweries in town, Osgood and Kitzingen being the most obvious examples. But in a city such as Grand Rapids, you can pretty much close your eyes, toss a rock, and hit a better beer destination.If the beer was generally underwhelming, it was still vastly superior to the food. As their pizza is what everybody raves about, and because it is nearly the only option on the menu, I ordered one. Our server said they were about 12 inches, though to my untrained eye they seemed to be 14 inches. I wanted to try a couple of different pizzas, though a flight seemed somewhat excessive, especially to consume on my own. But, with a table full of vegetarians, my options were limited. I inquired about a pizza that was half and half, and was told that it was an option so long as the pizzas used the same source. One look at the menu evidences how minimally useful this concession is, as so many of the pizzas use a unique sauce. I was told that many people like to go half and half with Da Meathook and Hog Heaven, but with bbq sauce for the whole pizza. That is what I regrettably opted for. Hog Heaven uses an excessively sweet and entirely too mild honey chipotle bbq sauce, adds on some lackluster pulled pork from Two Scotts, cheddar jack cheese, tortilla strips, diced onions, cilantro, and a bit of cajun aioli. Nothing about this pizza works. And it is a terrible degradation of the already second rate bbq coming out of Two Scotts. It is hard to fairly rate Da Meathook, since it was served with that same dreadful bbq sauce instead of the usual tomato sauce. None of the three pork products - pepperoni, sausage, and ham - evidenced any regard for quality, with the ham in particular about on par with something you'd get from an emergency rations tin. While my pizza was badly burnt, I declined to sent it back and have it remade  for the simple reason that its flaws were too numerous and fundamental for the level of char to be that big of a deal. I'm hard pressed to think of a local pizza spot I've liked less. Yes, even Domino's would've been more satisfying.I could make other minor complaints, like that the silverware was painfully flimsy or that there were big delays between the serving times on the three pizzas ordered, but none of that matters in view of the food and beer quality. Perhaps there's something in the evening atmosphere that draws people in, but based on my lunchtime visit, I can't imagine ever returning."}, {"review_id": "1Ydi9tKrFzq4zoJDtrAb_g", "user_id": "sLptqh6G1pGHfxchiu2fAw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/12/2017", "text": "We trusted fellow yelpers and tried this place on a Saturday evening.

So while it was really good, we didn't get to eat much of it since we wanted our other to be fresh.The pizza flight was a great way to try several things - the Thai Cobb was tasty and the pulled pork was better than expected.The beer selection was generous - I tried the raspberry and DH tried the Porter.
