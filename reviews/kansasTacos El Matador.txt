This restaurant fulfills requirement number 2. We came around lunch time, and we were the only customers.  The staff are very friendly and our orders were taken immediately.  It was also taco Tuesday so each taco was a dollar and 25 cents. I ended up getting 3 tacos of barbacoa and asada. The carne asada  Tacos were probably some of the best ones that I've had and they can the kansas city area.  It was well seasoned a marinated.They also give you unlimited chips which I thought were OK.  Some of them were fried to perfection while other chips tasted under cook and had a very chewy consistency. To 3 sauces they give you which enclose a mild and medium red sauce and a green sauce that complimented the tacos very well. They also had a couple of homemade drinks in the back, but unfortunately I missed it."}, {"review_id": "be5WYjI0mQcUlKki0uLsow", "user_id": "uSTC2VVvw8ll6GYS56-Cjg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "This is my favorite taco place in KC.

No, not a metaphor. I'm really talking about their guac. Tell me where it's better in this town because I'll be headed there in a heartbeat. Thick, full of flavorful, big chunks of onion, right mix of cilantro, lime juice, maybe a bit seasoned salt. A bit of heaven to start of with their very nicely locally made chips that were fresh out of the fryer, seasoned perfectly with salt. When you can elevate something that should be so simple beyond what everyone else can do, you have my attention. So many ways to screw it up just a tad, missing here. Perfect score.Tacos: street style, my favorite, two tripas done crispy. Props to the owner for offering crispy and whatever is less crispy than crispy--how's that for a description?. Nice bit of onion, little bit of cilantro, lime, the bomb. Also had a chicken enchilada that came out looking an awful lot like a quesadilla. It was delicious and I didn't complain. Paired all of this with a couple of Modelo beers with lime wedges and you have the recipe for a brilliant lunch.When my fellow Yelp peeps Billie and Adam are going five stars, I know it's going to hit the mark. Came along with a fellow food friend who like me enjoys testing out all of the great Mexican fare KC has to offer. We both gave Tacos El Matador the thumbs up. Get here fast, lock the car door hard, prepare for a feast. Oh, and the girls that waited on us were just the nicest. Must return soon, maybe for that breakfast."}, {"review_id": "9gsyQASXh60fgzgkmVE0kw", "user_id": "38EfCQKCfRYj24Q7Y8msbQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "I'd say \"A-OK\" and worth visiting for sure.  It was solid food.  Not stellar but good.  Given the pricing (low) it's a very good value.  Quac was very good.

Goodness.This place was worth every star given. We were lured in by the Yelp reviews and so glad we popped in here for a taco lunch before going down the road to IKEA. I wouldn't have been able to handle a Saturday afternoon at IKEA without a belly full of tacos.This place is unassuming. So unassuming that drug deals go down right behind your car, but more on that later. First, the food. Our server brought us a big basket of fresh, salty chips and two sides of hot sauce; a green, jalapeno based sauce and a traditional and spicier tomato salsa. Each were great.I ordered two al pastor tacos and an asada and was pleasantly surprised how loaded up each taco looked. They definitely don't skimp on the meat. My first bite into the al pastor taco and it *might* be my favorite taco in Kansas City at the moment. Loaded with flavor, this was a taco I didn't want to end.The asada was very flavorful and with a better cut of steak than some I've had around town lately. But the al pastor stole the show for me and I'd be happy with three of these each time. We got up to pay at the counter and when we walked out there was a sketchy van that pulled up about a foot behind our car. Mind you, this entire, massively sprawling parking lot was open and this guy parked directly behind us. He went inside and grabbed someone and they nervously started talking terms, grabbing baggies from hidden compartments of their car... I just wanted to get out of there at that point! So after the weird ending, I'll probably make this a day time kind of place, and probably take up their online ordering on their website and get them to go."}, {"review_id": "uaFroJhgjXOeZ_QodW-hBA", "user_id": "urHk2yWLAhn1thgb6UR_BQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/30/2017", "text": "You guys, this restaurant is the real deal.

Delicious food!Chips are not homemade, but the three sauces they serve are tasty. These are liquid and had terrific flavors: spicy (not too), mild, and tomitillo. I ordered a chili relleno and two authentic tacos: one steak and one carnitas. The tacos were piled high with meat and had onion and cilantro. All were Superb. Hubby had chicken fajitas: I laughed and laughed and laughed when it came out-- it was huge!  Two serving plates full of goodness PLUS tortillas. I swear there were two chicken breasts served with this. Fajitas included the chicken, onion, peppers and tomatoes. Accompaniments were avocado, sour cream, beans and rice.

This is a must stop for any lover of Hispanic food! And I didn't even try the tacos! Whaaaat?? A friend shared a bite of her breakfast burrito. It was pretty amazing. Drive to the other side of town for breakfast amazing! I skipped the tacos for a torta. Normally I skip tortas because they are so bread heavy, but this one is not. You have the typical torta bread, but not as thick. You can get a torta with a combination of meats. I went with barbacoa and carnitas, and so glad I did. Each one had great flavor and was piled high on the bread. The sandwich is perfectly complimented with lettuce, avocado, and mayo. I would add this torta to my list of best sandwiches in KC, probably in the top five. The restaurant is a little dive. You can go online and place a take out order.

It's not a fancy place but very comfortable, always full of families and kids, and they seem to usually have a shrimp taco special on weekends.  Just a perfect comfy down-home Kansas City place.  You should all eat here.  I think I will get a to-go order on my way out of town heading up to I-80 to Seattle."}, {"review_id": "-69JlM_Xbnmrv62jQaw2Ow", "user_id": "XavZORAK4T0Y12I7HgZ-Gg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/6/2017", "text": "We showed up very late and the staff was still very gracious.
