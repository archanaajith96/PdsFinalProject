Ambiance: The restaurant has an abundance of natural light seeping through their glass windows. It is bright and spacious. The decor is a bare minimum with marble tables and metal chairs. It is a mom's and pop's establishment with a casual environment. 2. Food: I used to be a regular at this restaurant when I lived in Wichita. Upon visiting the town, I had ordered my usual, which is number 22 (rice noodles and wide egg noodles). The noodle and soup came with sliced pork and liver. The broth is delicious and gives an umami taste. I thought the meat was perfectly marinated and paired well with the soup. This restaurant continues to beat out every Hu Tieu bowls I have ever tasted throughout the U.S.3. Service: The service here never disappoints. The servers worked in unison to help each other. I felt comfortable in asking for assistance with any one of the servers. I had asked for an extra plate of lettuce and one of the servers quickly assisted. Great job in customer service, My Tho staffs! 4. Costs: You really cannot go wrong with the price here at My Tho. A regular bowl of noodles costs $6.25. An XL bowl costs $7.25. The price is affordable and it is comparable to the portion provided.5. Overall Experience: As always, I had a great experience at this restaurant. I always miss this restaurant when I am far away, and do try to visit to get my favorite bowl when I am in town. I will definitely be back to visit in the future."}, {"review_id": "io9W5jIENnIvpItB-mMTvw", "user_id": "1JzYj8hWt2sgQEYPHYkIPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "My Tho is one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in townService is nice and helpful.

How do you get the pho broth so clear? I'm not sure either and My Tho is not sharing their secret! We stopped at this delicious pho restaurant on a gloomy and cold  Sunday drive back to DSM. You can smell the aromatics outside and what a wonderful smell it was. The menu is very simple; no appetizers to kick start the meal. And I know why.. the pho is SO good that I actually finished the whole bowl. Every last drop. The ratio of noodles, broth, meat, herbs was perfect! I was still a tad hungry so the lil sis and I split the combo banh mi sandwich. I felt it was missing the oomph of soy sauce and pate, but it was good, nonetheless. Unfortunately, I didn't take any pics. I was too hungry to make the effort. I highly recommend making a pit stop at this delicious pho restaurant in Wichita, KS!"}, {"review_id": "4JDlKmJuFfC9h5hUm7th3g", "user_id": "1kZ4LXnKYTbAeFL7jUewow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Best pho in town!!

Cold and flu season is the time we go every year and today was the day. We were greeted very kindly by and kind gentleman behind the prep station. Quick service which we appreciated very much.  We ordered the large beef phô with simple sirloin, a medium beef phô with meatball, brisket and tendon along with a sandwich.  The phô was good, not the best I've ever had, but it hit the spot. The broth could have been more fragrant, as I refer to it. The meat was okay, but I don't think I found thetendon or it was different from what I'm used to. Will I return, maybe.

It ordered the #4 pho. my boy friend ordered the #1 and Bon mi. The menu did not have many options. No spring rolls or options really besides soups and Bon mi. The Pho was good, a little more oily than Im use to but it had a lot of meat and onions in it which I liked and the noodles seemed thicker than your typical pho rice noodles which is nice because they were not all tangled together and hard to eat. The plate of toppings was ok, not the freshest. It had some smaller yellow peppers on it which were ok but I had to ask for sliced jalapeños.

It's always hot and delicious, and the service is always prompt. The Ban Mi sandwich is to die for. I always get one and a small bowl, and I walk away full and satisfied. They have kind of weird hours, and they close for like a whole month to go back home to see family each year, so pay attention to their schedule before you go.

We share a history of blue collar immigrant roots, somehow end up in the Midwest, but more important to me, we fucking love soup!I've had plenty of it in town, but I'm confident  to say that My Tho is the best experience. Don't get me wrong, there's tons of great pho in town (little Saigon, Pho Coung). You could even say there's not a bad pho place in town. The broth is not overly salty or oily. Pho is meant to be filling and comforting. A ton of salt and oil make end up feeling thirsty and can give you an upset tummy. They substitute Thai peppers for chili oil. At first I didn't like that but it makes sense. The strength of pho is the broth, chili oil only changes the texture and overwhelms the palette. The chili peppers are hot enough, like holy Santa Claus shit hot. No frills here. They're opened later. Don't tell too many people because I like how quiet it is in there.

I've never tried their pho but I am addicted to their Banh mi, hu tieu aaaaand Bo kho! My favorite is the hu tieu. I've ordered this at other restaurants (even in Vietnam) but they're just not the same! There's just something about the smell and the broth that one can't simply find at other places. Let's talk about service. The people there are perhaps some of the kindest people I have met. I'm not even over exaggerating. They're always polite and patient even on busy days. I'm a picky eater. I don't like leafy stuff and I don't like pepper. They always get my orders correctly and I'm very thankful for that. It's unfortunate that they only accept cash. When I'm really hungry, I don't want to have to drive to an ATM and get cash. I just want to eat until my tummy explodes (okay not really but you know what I mean). Also, I've noticed that their portion sizes are really small. I don't normally finish my food at other restaurants but I always finish my food here--- and I'd still be hungry. Just make sure you order more than one item because unless you're a bird, you will not be full with just one order! Overall, this is one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants in Wichita. Wonderful service, great people and delicious food. What more can you ask for? Oh, food.
