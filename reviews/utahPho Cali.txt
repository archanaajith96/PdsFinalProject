When I got back home to the SF Bay Area I had no problem finding solid Vietnamese restaurants. A few months ago I moved to SLC and never really thought I would find a decent pho place after trying a lot of hit or miss places but Pho Cali has become our go to spot for pho. It's excellent and very reasonably priced. I've had a LOT of pho in my life and I would definitely recommend this place."}, {"review_id": "hWi3PtRnVWzxvl3k3UYXrA", "user_id": "ZLzaM2TNMRzhLnnQ4Rk1Wg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "Food: 5 Stars - Chicken Pho was great, nice pieces of white meat chicken, garnishes were high qualityService: 2 Stars - Asked for extra lime, didn't get it, asked for it again, was ignored. Had to go get it from the window. Also I guess to the staff there thinks it is just hilariousssss that I would want extra lime for my soup.Service is important to me, and ignoring a customer + unnecessary rudeness means unfortunately despite the good food I probably won't come back :("}, {"review_id": "L-QsOd_qS3VgDFCMeifalA", "user_id": "0pIu5JTjHIrArnPsZvAArg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/25/2017", "text": "By far my favorite place for pho in Utah! It makes me feel at home again, it is authentic. The music & the service & food makes it feel like you are in an actual Asian restuarant. I have been here a couple of times and they have remembered me because I an Vietnamese as well. They are so welcoming and very quick with everything. I always get Pho bo vien and a small bowl because a small bowl is pretty much a large! Broth is always splendid.

This place is good, much better than the place next door in my opinion. Good broth, lots of noodles, good portion size. This is my second favorite pho spot in SLC, really. The prices are reasonable as well.

The waiter was very courteous and answered all our questions about the menu. I had menu item #4 pho I also asked for extra meat which the gladly accommodated. The pho was very very good.  Good size portions and the place was busy. The one thing that I cannot get over we the shrimp spring rolls that we ordered. These were the worst spring rolls I have ever had. The lettuce they used was bitter and old. If not for the sauce they would have been edible. My friend even called the spring rolls lettuce stuffed condoms. At which point we stopped eating them... Giving 4 stars for the service and how good the main dishes were."}, {"review_id": "MLNFLOub5NPtFGKhOYQ0-g", "user_id": "ZcCUKUy_aoZurwh5lyxLlw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/31/2017", "text": "First of all I gave this place 5 stars because the staff is attentive. Very rarely at a Pho restaurant do you get more than one glass of water. Multiple times they came to the table to check on us. My boyfriend and I had the egg rolls, everything fried rice and beef brisket pho. When the everything fried rice hit my mouth I did a happy dance! Delightful! The pho broth is delicious and full of flavor. I would highly recommend this place.

Soooo average. Maybe I hit it at the wrong time. It was a take out BUN WITH BBQ chicken and The shrimp aft egg rolls. I can usually eat anything but this dish ended up in the trash after I ate the chicken. GOOD LUCK!I hate to give negative Reviews but as a business owner I try to use the not so good ones to make my business better.  But not sure everybody thinks this way.

This is one of my to go places for pho. The seating arrangement is a bit weird and \"free to seat\" anywhere kind of thing.The pho here is a very delicious ESP the house special. If you are very hungry they offer a large bowl that can for sure guarantee to fill you up. The bun bo hue comes with something called pork blood, and the owner will ask if you want it or not. Some people do like it because it is like tofu but other with just the idea of eating blood doesn't like it. The only thing about this place is that they hire some people that don't really speak English and mostly Vietnamese. It was very hard for our waitress to take our order and for us to understand her. I think at one point I just tuned her out (I know pretty rude of me).

So far they did put EVERYTHING in it like how I wanted but the only thing that puts me down a bit is the broth, feels like its missing something lack of seasoning I'm not sure what but the flavor wasn't there for me. I know some days things will taste better than other days but I guess I just went on the wrong day? Will I be back?

I am a regular here. This is the pho by which all other pho should be judged! The authentic family recipe in the broth is amazing. I love the variety of meats that come in the house special too.They bring the House Special to your table, almost as a kit. The meat is already cooking in the broth when it gets to you, and you tear up and put in the veggies you want in your soup. It's a fun, unusual experience for me.The servers and staff are also great. I used to come in about once a week, and I didn't even have to order after a while - they remembered what my usual, customized order was. Once, I came in to pick up a takeout order, and I forget my wallet. They insisted that I just take the order and pay them next time. That level of customer service is uncommon, forget sure!I strongly recommend you try Pho Cali. Bring a friend, and try the House Special."}, {"review_id": "HuHsgUo-t0d2yVEQthnYjA", "user_id": "T4JoLjkaKz4_6smrAltPdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/31/2016", "text": "Lots of fun at this place with the guys.
