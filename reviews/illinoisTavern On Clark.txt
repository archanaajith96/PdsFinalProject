We sat in the dining room at a four top. The room was on the darker side with dark ceilings and dark tables and the walls were adorned with some stock photography or maybe a local photographer's prints of young people posing for \"candids\". After a few minutes inside my eyes adjusted to the darker atmosphere. The menus were large and thick and featured burgers, chicken sandwiches, wraps, flatbreads, salads, pasta and entrees.I stuck with water to drink and ordered the blackened chicken taco salad ($12) to eat. The greens were topped with blackened chicken, avocado, pico de gallo, Queso fresco and a Santa Fe aioli. I really enjoyed the salad, mostly due to the cubes of cheese and the pico de gallo (which was much nicer to me than some watery cubed tomatoes would have been) plus the kick from the aioli. The salad was on a square plate and was a reasonable portion, not some seemingly bottomless bowl like some places put out.Service was OK but refills on water were spotty and my dad had to wait about 15 minutes for the second beer that he ordered even though it didn't seem horribly busy in there. My mom reminded our server about the beer and it showed up shortly after that, so I don't know if the waitress had forgotten about it or what.The restaurant was tucked off the highway a bit near a hotel, but it was easy access from the interstate, and I could see coming to Tavern On Clark again sometime if I were meeting people in Rockford."}, {"review_id": "3vfBW4hlcBoGoeCSvExY8g", "user_id": "5kFqe2wMxpKBcI2TGh-xNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "If you have the craving for great steak in a cozy, classy atmosphere, this is the place to splurge. There is a full bar, about 5 gaming machines (must be 21 to play), and ample space for a few tables and booths for dining. There is also a big parking lot available. Locationwise- it is a bit awkward  though if you are taking your parents, grandparents or kids because it is right next to a gentleman's club with blaring neon lights. However, as soon as you enter this restaurant you will be greeted warmly and it definitely has a family dining atmosphere after you walk past the gaming area and bar.The food... yes, lets talk about the most amazing asset this place has. From appetizer to dessert, the food presentation and flavors will \"wow\" you. (See attached pictures for description.) Fine dining experience that is reasonably priced. The service- excellent!"}, {"review_id": "JgCCQvyCfsUFm_mwyxByjQ", "user_id": "H4ViOQJ9gMBTt7QxHz6l_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "We had a wonderful experience at the Tavern on Clark tonight.

And honestly, I am only in this area because the Holiday Inn closer to my facility was completely sold out. I would have never considered to try this tavern otherwise.With that said, this was a pleasant surprise. I decided on the Salmon Oscar, which comes with a soup or salad. Since french onion was an option, I decided to go with soup. The soup itself was decent but nothing to write home about. Seemed a bit watery but had good flavor and wasn't too salty. The salmon, though, was pretty awesome. I like my salmon cooked medium rare and forgot to mention this to my waitress. Practically all salmon entrees that I've ordered is served medium, so I was delightfully surprised to see that the salmon was cooked just the way I like it. Nice warm soft center and flaky outer. I'm typically not a potato fan but the sliced baby red potatoes that came with this dish was perfect. Just enough salt to flavor and was cooked soft with some drizzled butter (or it was just butter/fat from the salmon). Anyhow, really yummy!I finished my meal with my all time favorite dessert: creme brulee! This tasted like heaven. Sooo creamy! I contemplated ordering another one and had to talk myself out of it. Best of all, the service I received from Heather was fantastic. She checked on me frequently to make sure everything was fine, and my water glass was never empty. She was super friendly and had a natural radiance to her. Thanks for the great service Heather!"}, {"review_id": "BZkPLk79NsXCEHzMbym01g", "user_id": "9tNCHE1B5nhm7vsDKhPdKg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "I will not be back. Here's why: 1) Order the Saturday night Prime Rib \"special\" at your own risk. Terrible cut of meat with more fat than meat and of the two we ordered, one was extremely tough. The other had none of the flavor you expect from this cut. ($29)2) We also ordered the Trout special. It was not special. We sent it back as the fish tasted metallic.  (Three folks in our party tasted and confirmed.) ($25)3) After dessert was done and we were winding down to prepare to leave, the waitress stopped by the table to ask if we were leaving soon. Literally no more than 5 minutes after our dessert plates were cleared. I guess the table timer ticks pretty quickly at this place, even with a $400+ tab (party of 7). The place is packed, so I wonder if we just had bad luck.

The wings were okay, but pretty unique how they were presented and creative with skewers and a bed of carrots and celery.Overall, I liked the service and the food selection.
