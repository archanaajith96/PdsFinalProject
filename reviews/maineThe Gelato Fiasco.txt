It was surprisingly empty on a Sunday afternoon, and we had the place to ourselves for a bit. The flavors were delicious and definitely hit our sweet tooth.The lady behind the counter was friendly and patient with us as we sampled several flavors. There were a few tables and chairs, and the space overall felt airy and clean. Though I imagine it could get insanely crowded in there.There are at least a couple of gelato places within just a block of each other in this area, but we were told by our Maine-native friends that this one's better. I didn't try the other one, but I trust my friends."}, {"review_id": "EuEv1JFofmptfghlX3Cksw", "user_id": "oSLQ5JFdZCg9KIRW41SLKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/16/2017", "text": "So many delicious choices for gelato that it's hard to pick just one!  The flavors are everything from classic flavors to crazy ones that pair really good together.This was my first place trying gelato and I'm glad because it was yummy.  If you want some good gelato you better come here.Oh and they also sell their gelato in a lot of stores so if there isn't one nearby and you've got a craving for it you can probably find it for sale too!If you love peanut butter you better try the Peanut Butter Stracciatella.  You can just taste how fresh it is.  It has a REAL peanut butter taste, with small pieces of chocolate that isn't too much and the touch of sea salt is perfect.  And the texture gives you a little bit of the peanut.  Now I want to go dig in and it's only 9AM!"}, {"review_id": "ynLkCUTeNaU62YYtdhSz2w", "user_id": "czqJEm4LhQpsYUjW8qyviw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "We came here on late Friday evening hoping to grab good dessert after dinner. This place was rated very highly so we had to come check it out while visiting Portland. There was a fair amount of customers standing in a neat line, but that didn't last long haha! Everyone was hovering over the flavors that the line got mixed up and someone cut in front of us. Oh well. Not a biggie because service was not too slow. They offer at least 18 flavors, and I got to try the lavender honey. Then I decided on the medium sized cup of both lavender honey and espresso chip. The portion size was huge and I recommend medium as a sharing size. But I was unknowingly greedy and got my own. I really enjoyed the lavender honey, it's quite a good kick of flavor. The espresso chip is also very distinctive and at a perfect blend of coffee and chocolate altogether.The place has a handful of seating. Although it was crowded that time of the night, we were able to grab two high top seats. I'd recommend this place to everyone with a sweets craving."}, {"review_id": "gy1mNaMDMMAn_sLaOSF8fA", "user_id": "QUj7n1N8ToGUu0SN9odPXg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "Made a stop here after getting some lobster roll and took a stroll in the area. Plenty of seat inside and in the patio. They give lots of lots of gelato in your choice of bowl.

Desert Ice Cream but came across this place first during my walk. I can't have dairy, so I was very happy to find that they had about eight different delicious-sounding flavors of sorbetto (non-dairy). They were marked with words but also by having a different-colored scoop, so they were easy to quickly locate. The server let me taste the apple pie sorbetto which is what I decided to get. They have a perfect \"treat\" size (smaller than a small) for just a few bucks. I had a super spicy dinner so this little cup of heaven was exactly what I was craving to cut the heat! Would definitely come back next time I'm in the area."}, {"review_id": "QxdpNuPxt8Z5ct_q47_ZUQ", "user_id": "rYThpXymFIFUbMpleiYuFQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/6/2017", "text": "Yummmyyyy! This place is ahhmazing!! Please, believe me when I say you only need a SMALL! You can get a good portion of 2 flavors in a small! I got a medium and as soon as I started I thought, man I would've been fine with a small! 30 flavors of gelato and sorbet hand made here! Sooo yummy! The gelato is sooo smooth and creamy! The Brownie Batter tasted like a nice, yummy chocolate!The Cookie Therapy is very similar to cookies n cream! So yummy! I love the small balls of cookie!The inside is nice and modern. The ice cream structure is like a 180 view of what they offer. They serve bar style, so get in when you can. Taste test as many flavors as you want, just be courteous because they're busy!If you're hosting an event you can call for The Gelato Fiasco Mobile Unit. Probably pricey, but probably worth it! So glad we got to try this gelato gem out while visiting Maine!"}, {"review_id": "W7ro2RzlZR5TBwmtbLlhdQ", "user_id": "VXMd1_fljqxM8t4-OUQtiQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/5/2017", "text": "The BEST gelato I've ever had. I highly recommend the Sweet Resurgam flavor, it was amazing! And I'm not sure where else you could find it.The girl working behind the counter was so friendly and was happy to give out samples. The hardest part of the experience was having to choose which flavors to order - they all looked so good! I ended up getting a cup with half a Sweet Resurgam and half dark chocolate with caramel. Both flavors were heavenly. The inside of the shop is cozy and has a good amount of seating.

How many flavors can I try before the employee cuts me off? Well, Gelato Fiasco will never do that. They invite you to try as many flavors as you want before you place your order. What more could you possibly want? My family comes here often and each time we get greeted immediately, we get served by happy employees, and we always walk out satisfied. They have probably 30 options on any given day of flavors to choose from. Many times, the decision is overwhelming, but you will never be disappointed. Can't decide on one flavor? Good news! You can put multiple flavors in a dish. The number of flavors you can get depends on the size dish you get, but they will try their hardest to get every flavor you want in your dish. You can join their red spoon club for promotions and to earn free gelato. My personal favorite is toasted coconut and mango."}, {"review_id": "Yi7NG7yhldFhAOBrH3ZThQ", "user_id": "6uqafD4PFcgID1rlI9g57Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Best gelato That we have ever had.

The Gelato Fiasco embodies the perfect matrimony of flavor and creativity. I never thought that I would ever eat creme fraiche cornbread gelato, but here I am, having eaten it because folks at the Gelato Fiasco are that crazy creative. And what about the kernel corn gelato with bits of still magically crunchy popcorn inside? In short, the Gelato Fiasco never stops to amaze me and blow my mind.Can I also say that I love the treat size and the fact that you can put as many flavors as you want into any size? As a petite sweet tooth, I always want to try as many flavors as possible while still being able to finish my order, so to me the treat dish is one of the best things that exists on earth.

I had the dark chocolate caramel sea salt and burnt sugar flavors, both were really good. Their waffle cones are homemade and taste like a cinnamon roll.Prices are pretty high - $4 or so for the smallest scoop and the waffle cone is another $1.25 but portions are generous and they are also incredibly generous with samples, urging to try as many of the 30+ flavors as you want before ordering.

Doesn't feel as crowded in the warmer weather, because there is a patio dedicated to Gelato Fiasco.I am a loyal customer of this brand, because of the quality of the product and staff and I don't ever expect that to change.

They don't really do a line system, which means it can get a little crazy when there are a lot of people, but the staff is good about handling it. Plus...no line means you don't have to worry about holding up the line as you try all those flavors (speaking of which, there are a lot of flavors to choose from...almost too many, but I guess that's why they let you get multiple in one cup). I got the stracciatella, Maine strawberry cheesecake, and dark chocolate sea salt, while my parents got the peanut butter cup, strawberry balsamic, and espresso chip. My favorites were the stracciatella and the strawberry balsamic, and I was impressed by how you could actually taste strawberry in the strawberry balsamic, not just strawberry flavoring."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-gelato-fiasco-portland-2?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
