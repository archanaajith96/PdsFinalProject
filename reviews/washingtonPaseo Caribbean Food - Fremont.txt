We came in pretty close to close but the staff was still really friendly(I've worked food service I know close to close customers can be frustrating) I got the shrimp sandwich 3 star spicy and it was delicious. I think next time I'll go 2Stars as the habanero sauce kind of overpowered the other flavors in the sandwich. That being said the shrimp were perfectly cooked, they gave me plenty of caramelized onion and the bread was great. Boyfriend got the traditional Cuban and really liked it but said he expected richer flavors. I'm sure we will be back to try more and update review/stars"}, {"review_id": "qDsCvppPTtTnJZyrfm8OCw", "user_id": "bQCHF5rn5lMI9c5kEwCaNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "ZOMG. Like, just, simply, ZOMG!!!The sandwiches here are seriously THAT. GOOD. You can't go wrong with anything here, but I went with the Caribbean roast which featured roasted pulled pork shoulder, aioli, cilantro, romaine, jalapeños, and caramelized onions. Mmm mmm, mmm hmm. Just foodg*smic if you're a meat lover. Can't say enough about it. Simply a delightfully goopy mess where I licked off all the bits and pieces that fell off, plus my fingers to boot. It's not cheap, but it is worth absolutely every. single. penny.

The 3 star rating is basically from being overhyped and probably a place I would've rated 4 stars otherwise. Parking wasn't too bad on the street within a few min walk and the restaurant itself is tiny with maybe 4 tables inside and a couple long table with benches outside. Caribbean roast is what everyone recommends and so my gf and I got a sandwich + a plate of it. The sandwich seemed a little lacking in terms of how much meat was on it, and the plate is a much better deal than the sandwich! Sandwich was loaded with grilled onions and some veggies on a ciabatta like roll. The rice is cooked in pork fat or pork broth which was really tasty and they really load up the pork. Make sure you come hungry if you order a plate! The beets in the salad were really refreshing and it comes with a side of beans and corn as well! The pork had some parts that were pretty tender and some that were over cooked. All in all a very solid meal but anything in the top 10 on yelps 100 should be considered life changing!!"}, {"review_id": "W6QjlUz13j4AOB7Soak7Ag", "user_id": "QFAraifuc9u0G4pDbFtzaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "We were recommended this place and stopped on our way traveling north and definitely were not disappointed. we ordered the Caribbean roast and the chicken breast sandwiches and split between the two of us The Caribbean roast is one  of the best sandwiches I've ever hadI highly recommend!"}, {"review_id": "90jbt91eVyJX7EJzN1bKTA", "user_id": "exfo1mPHUX1HIUW0cMuEFA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Soooo delicious, one of the eats I miss the most from Seattle! Got this as our first and last meal in Seattle just because we loved it so much.Caribbean Roast (#2)+ Huge pieces of grilled onion+ Pulled pork was juicy and flavorful+ Mayo and a spicy sauce complimented each other- Bread was a little tough and too hard to bite into- Sandwich is really messy to eat - On the second time we got the sandwiches, the size seemed smaller and the bread was softer? Seems like there is a variation in consistency.The restaurant itself is really tiny with only a few tables and seats. This doesn't really work well if you have a large group, and it is best to sit down because it is a messier meal. If you can, you could grab it to go and eat it somewhere else but I would suggest eating it asap or else the bread will get soggy."}, {"review_id": "k7F7f0nd5nucgfrf7ATm4Q", "user_id": "zoOwMO9KTfnMYpYJVb6b9A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Came here for a late dinner right before closing.

However, I had a guest visiting Seattle with me and I figured this would be a great time to try Paseo sandwiches. We ordered two Caribbean Roast sandwich, one roasted corn and the chips & salsa. Chips and salsa were nothing to write home about... sandwiches tasted good. I don't usually like to eat sandwiches (including Jimmy Johns, Subway, etc.) but I did enjoy it a lot. Roasted corn was delicious. I'll rate it 4 stars because I don't think it's AMAZING (Porto's Bakery in LA is my gold standard for 5 star sandwiches) but it's pretty good.

Everyone raves about the Caribbean roast but while I thought it was pretty good, for some reason it just wasn't very hot and the meat was a bit dry. The scallop sandwich was another solid choice and very tasty. The Paseo press was the BEST one hands-down though.

Period. It's such a hole in the wall, the restaurant is small and looks like a shack from the outside.I'm so glad we didn't have a huge line because the sandwich takes a while to come out. For the price, I'd say it's worth it. Around $11.35 I want to say? Don't remember, just remember the delicious pork.I got the popular Caribbean Roast and I have to say it was even more Han the hype for me. The bread is a little tougher but I appreciated how it attempted to hold together such juicy meat. Even though it's a messy sandwich, it's a delightful experience.The pork is so good. I'm still missing it. The caramelized onions are in beautifully big pieces that have a nice pineapple flavor. Surprisingly the romaine lettuce worked even though I don't like lettuce in general. In its simplicity, this sandwich is wonderfully hardy and satisfying.Would return and recommend to friends.

Eating it without getting your hands dirty is pretty hard. Bread was properly toasted, mayo light and saucy, meat pretty soft, and jalapenos had a light kick. My only complaint with is was the meat wasn't too tenderized. There were some meat chunks that were just harder to bite into, but not too hard.

I'm not from Seattle, but I've had Paseo's on two different occasions. On both occasions, I've gotten the popular Caribbean Roast which is a pulled pork sandwich with a mayo slathered soft, crusty roll, jalapeños, lettuce, cilantro, and fat n' juicy onions. The first time, I was floored. The pork was succulent with the perfect amount of fatty distribution. The sandwich was soaked and dripping in delicious pork juices. The bread is well-structured and can hold the weight of the contents. I shared with a friend (it was a food trip) and I was light-weight regretful that I didn't just get my own sandwich.The second time, I was really disappointed. I had convinced myself that this was going to be an amazing meal from my first experience. And you know? Everything was just as good, except for what should really matter, the pork. It was so dry, so stringy. The way that immediately gets stuck in your teeth in an unpleasant way. The sandwich was still moist, but it was from the onions and the mayo, not the pork. Again, I shared the sandwich, but I was glad I did and I didn't even finish my half of the sandwich.On my second trip to Seattle, I had chosen to go to Paseo's again instead of trying out Un Bien and I was sadly let down. Paseo's is a must-try, but I don't know if they're consistently good. I still would recommend, but next time I'm in Seattle, I will probably make a point to go to Un Bien instead."}, {"review_id": "5wSeID-BYwVfSl5H9u6ysA", "user_id": "i4Cg2-Jlp_YylfiJOMllGw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "I finally got the chance to try this place and compare the Caribbean Roast to Un Bien's and it's quite close. The location is small and you must find street parking just like Un Bien. The staff is super friendly too which is great. But the sandwich is slightly different. Let me start by saying that Paseo's Caribbean Roast is great! The bread is perfectly toasted and soaks up the delicious morsels of meat that are covered with jalapenos, cilantro, crispy lettuce, and the caramelized onions. But the main difference I noticed is that despite how greasy the wrapper gets, the meat is a bit more dry and the caramelized onions are not as sweet compared to Un Bien's. You can taste the contrast in flavor between sweet and savory at Un Bien that really balances the meal. With that said, if you want to introduce a friend to this for the 1st time, I would suggest going out of the way to Un Bien to get them hooked! But if you live closer to Paseo, by all means go here and save the trip! Both taste extremely similar, but Un Bien wins imo."}, {"review_id": "mWlMVyx7_Rd-MD2SaMcwRQ", "user_id": "VEyvCUaPU71CuTGv29rhjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "I love this place.

First of all, this place has no sign and would have been easily missed if I hadn't looked up pictures of this place prior to coming. Very worn down, tiny little place with only about 5 or 6 little tables. We ordered the Caribbean roast and Paseo press. Both were good and packed with strong flavors..almost felt like I was eating some pho at times :o but it was super messy and wet. SO HARD TO EAT! There is no way this can be eaten on the go. You will also need a wad of napkins and some wet tissues to work through it. Honestly, what turned me off was their cleanliness or lack thereof. Their bathroom was dirty and very close to the table right outside (patrons sitting there could probably hear you pee and whatnot) lol.
