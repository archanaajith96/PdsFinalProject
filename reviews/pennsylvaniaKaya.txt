They were good, but the rampiness was weak. Not so with the salmon which also came with grilled asparagus and jicama. Both the eggs and salmon came with micro greens! So freaking good!!UPDATE: Tonight, I came for dinner and had the Manchengo and Avacado Deviled Eggs, Caribbean Jerk Pork and Plantain Nachos, and Grilled flank steak. Another delicious and healthy dish. The flank steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare (note that I wasn't asked how I wanted it cooked). Peppers, mushrooms, avocados, cilantro, and a corn salsa. The salsa was quite vinegary, but I am into fermented foods and I am wondering if the salsa was fermented...That would make it even healthier. If it is not fermented, they need to work on their salsa recipe. Last comment: they have my most favorite beer Dechutes Fresh Squeezed on tap along with some good local craft brews."}, {"review_id": "fT6NX7uBIAOWOOTuKaFSSg", "user_id": "m16eCLgVez1EeEes2rEwHA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "I don't know why this place was so highly rated. I'm disappointed. Flank steak was literally just a steak with a little bit of salsa. No sides, barely any flavor. And it was $26. The margarita was like any other margarita, except they charged me $12 for it.I sat on the patio because it was a nice day. The service was fine and the restaurant seemed clean enough. Overall I don't have much to say about it. It was a bland experience and I don't recommend it."}, {"review_id": "Zhwm9twknwmQDewUlbPtrQ", "user_id": "9lCb0V9FVtvI9qHuZhJmqw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "More like 4 1/2 stars...not quite 5 because our food took a long time to get to us. A friend I drove in to Pittsburgh to support our friend who was showing as a part of NCECA. After that long drive and checking out some amazing artwork throughout the city, all while avoiding drunken green people (we were there on St. Patrick's Day), we were in need of some good food. And we purposely avoided all bars/restaurants where we saw green people hanging out at. One of the artists familiar with the area suggested we head over to Smallman Street, where we would have some options. There just happened to be another exhibit near by so it was a win. There's a fully stocked bar, booths, and tables in towards the back. Restrooms are downstairs...I didn't really explore to see what else was downstairs. Anyways, our server was great. He was able to answer any questions we had about the menu and very nice. I forgot what was ordered...I think one of my friends had a pulled pork quesadilla thing sans tortilla. It came with a side salad that looked amazing and some sweet potato fries. It was highly enjoyed. My other friend had ordered some broccoli cheddar soup (also highly enjoyed) and the vegetarian burger (not highly enjoyed, but finished). They admittedly don't make the patty in-house, and that may have made the difference. You can tell that everything else on their menu is made in-house however. It may be the reason why our food took so long to come out. I ordered the jerk chicken salad. While it wasn't what I thought it would be (it came with tortillas and not a lot of greens), it was absolutely delicious. It had some mango, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. And surprisingly was even good wrapped inside those tortillas. Not for the faint of heart...I am someone who can take the heat, and this definitely had it. I basically licked the plate clean and could've probably had more. It was absolutely delicious. I would love to go back when/if I'm ever back in Pittsburgh. If you're around, check it out."}, {"review_id": "UMkoswlnHzb_nUtq0PS_Gw", "user_id": "DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Updating, as I have visited many times since my first visit.

My only complaint was that it was too big for me to finish it all.

No amazing happy hour specials, no cool brunch options. The Jamaican Jerk wings app we ordered was good, but I've had much better wings at a dive bar. The flavor on point, the texture just didn't do it for me. I like my wings to be crispy and tender. These were tough and chewy at times. My friend got the salmon. He said it was over cooked on the outside and too soft on the inside. I ordered the rainbow salad, it  was good and not a bad value. I opted for no meat because I had the chicken wings already.Im leaving 4 starts for my overall experience, but there is definitely room for improvement. I'd give it another try and you should too.

The black bean dip was very filling and lightly seasoned. It wasn't heavy and paired so well with the chips. I got the veggie burrito (since it had mushrooms and seasonal veggies) but had them add the chorizo and bacon (for a few dollar up charge). This thing was gigundo! The over easy eggs were on top, so when you cut in the creamy yolky goodness cascaded down the burrito.

Several people have raved to me about their chicken and waffles and I wanted the chance to indulge!  My wife ended up ordering the chicken and waffles, promising me a few bites so that I was able to order the tropical paella.  Last year I was first introduced to paella and loved it.  Needless to say, Kaya's paella was excellent. The scallops, mussels, and shrimp were blended beautifully with chicken and chorizo with not one element overtaking the dish.  I also thoroughly enjoyed the sampling of chicken and waffles I had from my wife's plate. For some reason, fried chicken always taste so much better with waffles and maple syrup! We ended up ordering some coffee and tea to go with our meals.  A little pricey for each, but we both needed a nice pickup after our filling meal.Kaya definitely lived up to my expectations.  I really enjoyed our brunch here and was pleased to see the prices on the menu were reasonable for a nicer brunch place with good food. I saw a few things on the men that I would like to come back to try, especially the rainbow salad.

The service was a bit slow due to it being so busy but not too bad.The drinks were really great! The cocktails were probably the highlight of the meal. We had the conch fritters, seafood paella, jamaican curry with shrimp, and jerk chicken torta. I loved the fritters! Or rather, I loved the spicy sauce that came with them. Could have eaten those all day.The curry was decent, but not as spicy as I'd hoped. The seafood paella was a huge portion, lots of chunks, which was good, but incredibly bland. The jerk chicken torta was probably the worst thing - a very dry piece of chicken on some bread, and there was no flavor. Really couldn't tell that it was anything but some grilled or boiled chicken. I blame my brother for even thinking we should order this as it didn't sound appealing in its menu description either, which is a testament to their menu-writing at least.When I think of Caribbean food, I think a lot more flavor than what was here.

Overall, the Cuban sandwich was absolutely phenomenal! However, the plantain nachos tasted as though they accidentally dropped their entire spice rack into the jerked pork.Cuban sandwich: a sumptuous mix of different kinds of well-seasoned meats melded together with creamy cheese and savory aioli. Although the sandwich was a bit heavy, it was incredibly delicious, and I look forward to tasting other sandwiches they have to offer.Jerked pork and plantain chips: the plantain chips by themselves were crispy, well-salted and delicious. However, as I mentioned above, my taste buds felt that they were on a roller coaster ride of different spices, some of which may have gone well, but others that made me wonder \"I think something happened in the kitchen, and it involves someone experimenting with every spice he has in his spice rack\". I personally would not recommend this dish.Overall, the receptionist was welcoming, servers were kind and patient with our orders, and wait for take-out was not long at all.The Cuban was a solid 4.5, the Plantain nachos a 1.5, service 4, ambiance 4."}, {"review_id": "oDHFMv3j0ONuqXJvGf1XHA", "user_id": "E1FJIPr-VRPotG8v6c2kaA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/13/2017", "text": "Cool looking place, fun music. Nice vibes. Hmm... weird customer service though? I'll get back to that later. Anyways..Ordered the LOCO MOCO ($11) off of their July Featured Island Cuisine (Hawaii), which I think might've been a mistake. My friends thought it was good but I thought it tasted way too peppery?! It contained pineapples, hamburger steak, coconut rice, onion gravy, scallions, Fresnos, and cilantro. If you've had bibimbap before, it was basically a Hawaiian bibimbap.  But it was just a blend of flavors that just didn't taste THAT good together. For my drink, I ordered their WHITE SANGRIA, it was alright, maybe should have tried their regular sangria instead.Oh yeah, do not get their TAKO POKE bowl, holy moly that thing was small and I felt bad for my friend who got it, especially for $14.Customer service. Slow. But then they would fill the waters too often, and when they brought the food to us, the way the servers talked to each other was so.. weird?? They gave each other some attitude and I felt a little uncomfortable sitting there. It was also my birthday and they didn't refrigerate the cake my friends brought. (NO CAKE FEE if you were wondering! Not sure if you wanna bring your cake though, hopefully it doesn't melt..) When we got our checks, the customer copy was on top when we were paying (what?). Well. At least they lit the candle we provided for our room-temp cake, lol. I read an old review where it said they used to charge if you wanted to make a reservation, which wasn't true in our case so don't worry about that.For a big Burrito Restaurant Group place, I'm pretty disappointed.

I went with another friend and we used our $10 off coupons from the Big Burrito group (if you sign up for their mailing list they mail you coupons at the end of the year to use at any of their restaurants through Jan. 31st). We started out with the Yucatan hot bean dip which is served with Kaya's house-made chips. Always delicious and never disappoints. For my meal I ordered the burrito. It was a little spicier than I expected but still very good. Also a very large portion which left me feeling very satisfied at the end of our meal. Out of all the Big Burrito restaurants, Kaya is at the top of my list with its unique menu items and laid back atmosphere. Great place for a meal with friends/ family or for a date night out.
