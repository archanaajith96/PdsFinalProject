I'm listening.It was packed. No worries, I got my order in no time flat. Lots of GM people swarm the place, probably because it is good, fast, and cheap. My platter had 3 tacos and a huge helping of rice along with a pop. Chips and salsa delivered upon entry, watch out the hot is as advertised.

The inside and the staff are great and friendly it seems as if this place came straight out of Mexico in the small village.The food is outstanding fresh/flavor and plenty of it to go around for the price. The Steak Fajitas are simply amazing and the \"Taco Tuesday\" tacos 99cents are out of this world. You sit down your greeted with 3 different salsa's and endless chips. If you are a fan of Mexican food this is the place you need stop by you will keep going back!"}, {"review_id": "tP4mBtv1G89vhem9Z0qjeA", "user_id": "KcG8A8LWk7oAcuX1gVjq2A", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "My family and I wanted to try a different Mexican restaurant.  We go out for Mexican every Friday evening in the Warren/Sterling HTS area and have not visited this restaurant.  We arrived at 8:45pm not realizing they close at 9pm on a Friday.   All the other Mexican restaurants close at 11pm on a weekend night. The restaurant was full of patrons, but immediately upon entering 15min before their closing time we were told \"you can only make a carry-out order, we can no longer seat you would you like to place a carry-out order?\"  Not even a greeting such as \"Hello\" or \"Welcome\".  We felt we were getting pushed out the door as soon as we entered it.Now, I have worked in restaurants for 10 years prior to my current job.  I fully understand what it is like if someone comes in 5-15 min prior to closing if it is not busy and the staff has already cleaned up and are close to walking out the door.  However, that was far from the case and in my experience this was an unacceptible way to treat customers in these circumstances.  It was unexpected and even worse just felt rude.Apparently this place doesn't need customers, so we left and went to Azteca's up the road and had an enjoyable Mexican meal and we won't ever be going back to Mexico City restaurant.  Too bad, since we were excited to try something new."}, {"review_id": "0-UdKH3f5UU6Q0WJ3aUIkw", "user_id": "AY7fQCIGPtlY4hSxDycqoA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "What a nice surprise. This restaurant is named Mexico City because they have brought the flavor and spice to this restaurant. Warning their salsa is addicting. Their food is excellent it's authentic Mexican food. I've never seen a fat chicken quesadilla before they loaded it with so much cheese and the avocados are fresh. Their pastor and steak tacos are on point. And here is the best part are you ready the prices are reasonably low. $1.80 for tacos . $2.75 for a cup of great tortilla soup. The pineapple Jarritos soda was so good. As for service when we walked in every table was dirty two servers were hustling to clean them this tells me they have been busy. Despite all that we were seated quickly and given a basket of chips and salsa.No need to go to Mexican town in Detroit when you can go to Mexico City. Will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "ir3IK5DtzT2wr0xQXH5JoQ", "user_id": "gnJDOrXo2cJ8xkRXU7GUWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "While here on business an associate of mine told me about taco Tuesdays and I decided to check it out. Now let's be honest, $1 tacos  is cheap and you'd expect cheap tacos but here at Mexico City Restaurant is the total opposite. You can't judge this place by the outside or the Christmas's lights that are hanging in the windows. First let's talk about the chips and salsa. It's always nice to start your meal off with unlimited chips and different types of spicy salsa. My favorite salsa was the spicy one to be honest. Now let's review the tacos...Beef- Well seasoned, very flavorful and it was only $1Al Pastor- YUMMY! The pork was seasoned correctly and they did include some pineapples which adds some sweetness to the meat. Carne Asada- This was my favorite Taco hands down. All you need is just a squeeze of like on top and you're ready to devour this taco. I highly recommend trying this restaurant out if you're in the area."}, {"review_id": "QA5VRj28X7hCQ-4DEq0cag", "user_id": "vfTNSe5tdJo2OWwWGE5jQw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Eating Keto at a Mexican restaurant has its challenges, but we ordered the steak fajitas with rice and beans and tortillas.  The steak was outstanding.  The toppings were sparse and we went without drinks for awhile, but other than that, it was really good authentic Mexican food."}, {"review_id": "fURcB6-8kfI-f9nx-6IV-g", "user_id": "reOsjVoPYkAQyVVau2crFg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "Looks a bit rough from the outside. Service is good, attentive and fast. Waters came out quick. We had fresh chips and 3 bottles of salsa in minutes. I liked the hot salsa the best, the avocado sauce is good and the mild salsa tastes different, not my favorite. The chips are really good here, they are fresh, thin, but substantive and super crunchy. Had a second basket soon after we ran out of the first basket of chips. We ordered 2 chicken tacos, 2 fish tacos (grilled), 2 bean tostadas a la carte. The fish tacos were perfectly cooked and tasty, the chicken tacos were grilled and the bean tostadas hit the spot. The food was plentiful and really filling."}, {"review_id": "CmWPCvSvt4oa1YpEqx6Heg", "user_id": "oFQ6g0p5krX0Wr5EssW3JQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "I recently started eating here and can't get enough.

No one!I ordered Ala Carte, Hubs ordered a combo.  I tried a barbacoa taco, steak taco, and a chicken gordita.  The tacos were mouthwatering!  Some of the best I've had!  A nice big splash of lime on top totally made them!  The gordita was really good too, but I couldn't finish.  I overdid it on the chips and tacos. lol  My husbands combo had a taco, tamale, and a burrito along with a side of beans and rice.  He enjoyed everything on the plate.  With 2 drinks and our dinner, and tip, our meal was $25!!!!! SOOO good and so cheap!  There were a lot of people getting carry-out, and the dinning room was pretty full.  Can't wait to come back and chow down again!"}, {"review_id": "HPxr9JC7QYTq-x5ZApA5RQ", "user_id": "XPUYIXWy2msRHyYFVYR5eQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "This is absolutely the most wonderful food in the area they have reasonable pricing they give you lots of food and it's great Mexican the tacos are good the rice is the best"}, {"review_id": "LQXMD39t3VEsBlNzlDOLAA", "user_id": "e9wxYjkMXGOUVoHT_MVyPQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Best Mexican restaurant around.
