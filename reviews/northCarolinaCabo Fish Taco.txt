Won't find it here, but don't worry - Cabo is packin the taco game!! The Salmon teriyaki tacos are hands down the way to go! Packed with some much favor! And don't forget to ask about thief daily taco special. They usually have some unique options like alligator or shark. Plus, you can mix n match your tacos so come with a group of friends and try them all! Also, something unique, is that Cabo lightly frys their tacos shells, giving them a light, soft, yet crispy texture. Probably one of my favorite taco shells (is that a thing?) in Charlotte. Now to the sides- you gotta get the avocado pasta salad. It sounds strange, but so delicious. Warning - It's  packed with a little heat, but oh so good!!!! The margaritas are also pretty solid and they have plenty of options and flavors, including a full bar and a variety of different beers. They usually don't post their specials so be sure to ask your server if there are any!!! I've gotten lucky here before with Dos being the beer of the month. Now writing this review got me excited to go to Cabo again, as I'm going there tonight!!!! Aye aye!"}, {"review_id": "fomefKGEIRCYI6EeVTqQ9A", "user_id": "g9vO_cg9ahct_loLpsKLXA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "I was super excited to try this place being that I have Baja roots (I'm from Cali and i frequented Baja Cali all my life). Unfortunately, the food reminded me of an office party that was \"Mexican\" themed. In which,  people serve salsa, queso , and beans from a can purchased from a local American grocery store. As I prepared myself to eat my shrimp battered tacos, I realized that things weren't getting any better. My tacos were cold, my cheese dip was cold, and my beans were cold too. The corn medley being used as a chip dip should be a crime! That's Tex Mex, NOT Baja at all!!! Also, I have a big problem with having a pasta, guacamole, something or other as a side dish. When we asked for an avocado slice we were informed they didn't have any and they only had guac spread....What?!!! You mean to tell me that my tacos and sides weren't made with fresh avocados?!!!! I have 4 words... NO AVOCADOS FROM MEXICO!!!! Additionally, my mojito tasted like an alka seltzer, and my waiter was like a student avoiding eye contact so he wouldn't be called on. Overall, this experience has me feeling like Biggie Smalls....\"I'm going back to Cali Cali\""}, {"review_id": "LynBSGLTrCADwR3UuH-p-w", "user_id": "JYEZNStSPuWaNCSYzbAebg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Everything about this place is excellent! Quick wait staff who are friendly and the food is to die for. My husband and I ordered the queso as an appetizer and the tacos for entrees. The queso is out of this world! Smoky, creamy, and they serve it in an overflowing bowl - my kind of place! I had the carne asada tacos with rice and beans. So flavorful and definitely not your average taco. What surprised me most was how good the tortillas were! They were double wrapped with a bit of cheese and freshly made. So yummy. I also tried the Slim and Jalaritas - so good! The right balance between sweet and sour. I highly recommend this place - it's great for a light lunch or even before a night out - may be my new favorite Charlotte spot!"}, {"review_id": "QGwbykgzoOdAapDxragsFg", "user_id": "UGTQum1peLSeOZr08LERbA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "TACO TACO! Who doesn't love tacos? I've been to this restaurant a few times. Fun fact Cabo Fish Taco, they were featured on DDD. Personally, I love the Beer Battered Shrimp Tacos. Comes with two flour tortillas stuffed with cabbage, tomato, avocado, cheese, & finished with our white cilantro sauce. I have never had a bad experience at Cabo. It has a really good ambiance with an interesting layout you would never find at a chain restaurant. Weekends get a little busy so come early."}, {"review_id": "PkPWIeFiJLtUm8qiF5LU6g", "user_id": "1CkjIwVBP3_nrq3Nd0I2ZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Wow. This, man. I can't even. I seriously want to move to Charlotte so I can eat here more!We decided to come here due to the Yelp reviews, personal recommendations and the fact that it was on Diner, drive-Ins and Dives. So many good things so I couldn't imagine having a bad experience here, and we certainly didn't!We started off with Guacamole. Holy Moly. It was easily the best Guac I've ever had. It was so smooth! And the taste was great. My boyfriend was convinced it \"came from a can\". Not sure if guacamole has ever come from a can....hahaa. But he was meaning that it wasn't made fresh. Not sure how he was able to tell this, or if it was true. But it didn't stop me from devouring it. yum.We both got the same Margarita, The Perfect Wave. We got ours on the rocks. Our Margs were delicious! Very happy about that. Really wish we got \"Mas\" for $3 more. Ugh! Next time!For my meal I got 1 BBQ Mahi-Mahi taco and 1 Tavarua Tuna Taco. I got the Mahi-Mahi taco because it was recommended and that was the one on the show. And I chose the Tuna taco because our waitress said that the Honey Wasabi Sauce was THE BEST. Oh my gosh, yes. And this place does not skimp on the fish! We had huge chunks that were basically bursting out of the tacos. So both were equally amazing. I seriously kept going back and forth to pick a \"best\" and I couldn't. So, just know that you CAN mix and match your tacos! For my side I chose the cheddar jalapeño mashed potatoes and they were delicious!Nothing was bad here. Not even our service! We had an AMAZING time here. Food and atmosphere are on point!"}, {"review_id": "zNU3y_Zr5iGFmGmWmrqiGA", "user_id": "QMv3G0xwD4u4me0_nWXTng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "I love tacos! That being said, this place was so so so good. I highly recommend the shrimp dip to start but you also get chips and a really yummy corn salsa! I had a lemon grilled shrimp taco and a blackened mahi mahi taco with the Baja rice as my side. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the tacos! They all sounded so good! Our waitress was super cool and kept the margs coming which were also great!

That being said, I have honestly been to Cabo Fish Tacos over 30 times and I have tried almost every item on the menus. I would definitely recommend mix and matching two tacos and pairing it with a margarita. Maybe it's the nostalgia of the Blacksburg location but I feel like the food quality, location, service, and overall atmosphere is better than the NODA location. I'd still recommend stopping in!"}, {"review_id": "ZbWC-Es3Kn2dPNNc704CMw", "user_id": "-KAjEfH_pMGPHDhBOIx2FA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Tacos are pretty much a staple in my diet! While visiting Charlotte for a weekend, we stopped here for lunch. I ordered the blackened salmon taco and the lemon shrimp taco (love that you can mix and match entrees). My friend lives in Charlotte and had nothing but great things to say about the salmon tacos, so I went for it! They were great, seasoning was perfect. I was better off getting two of these instead of the shrimp taco but it was good. The special sauce and pickled veggies on top of the tacos are also worth mentioning! Nothing was too spicy or overwhelming either. Other things to mention is that their salsa is jam packed with corn, so don't expect the regular salsa here. It's good, just different! The decor of this place is really cool too. 5 stars for the customer service."}, {"review_id": "nx-G4a4SltHppFlz7qEGXg", "user_id": "V_RcZKv2ZxWzdUQYZlCpGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "So cute and tucked away on a street corner.

We order a few different tacos my lunch date had a few spicy ones that he really enjoyed. I'm pretty much a wimp and stuck with all the safe options. You get a lot of food for the money and the price point was decent. Nothing too crazy. If you're in the area stop by it's definitely worth a try.

Vibrant. Nodaish. Trustworthy. You can't ask for a better taco menu. You can't go wrong with any item on the menu actually! My food came displayed how I imagine the OG Thanksgiving dinner looked, in a cornucopia - almost too pretty to eat. Don't worry, I ate it and it was scrumptious. Cabo is unique, not only are the wall art installations funky, but the menus have something for everyone. Trust me when I say everyone! You can feel comfortable taking anyone here and knowing they will find something they love. Be sure you get your tofu grilled not blacked. Blackened ia good, but grilled has the taste of summer and it sits well with the fresh veggies and cilantro rice. Get crazy here Nd try something outside of your norm. It won't let you down!"}, {"review_id": "kWTV25BFAdsL7eplbYmaPQ", "user_id": "5nLsZ3ouFAlysZ8QICEaTA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "I am not exaggerating when I said this was the best tacos I have ever had.

I say that's okay. But when you have waitresses that are not polite, food that comes out one hour after you have ordered them and not cooked to how you've asked them, then you know that something's gotta give. This was obviously not the first time and what makes it difficult to be understanding about these bad experiences, is that they didn't happen on a weekend when they were busy. It happened on a rather mildly busy day, at best. So yeah... I love their food.

We stopped in for dinner on a Thursday night to be immediately seated. The restaurant was packed and the waitress very attentive throughout our meal. I had the lemon tuna and beer battered fish with a side of the spicy pasta salad. The fish taco has a lot of breading and not as crunchy as I would like. The tuna included seemed quality and big chucks. The waitress recommended the spicy avocado pasta salad, which I found not to be spicy and too much mayo for my liking. Both tacos were stuffed with fish making them difficult to eat without making a mess. The tortilla really shined here as they are homemade and served warm. The chips were a huge bummer as they tasted stale and over cooked. I did enjoy the corn and tomato salsa and chipotle cheese dip, but the chips kept me from really digging in."}, {"review_id": "5HAOjDl8KqyQNUH_kv0gmA", "user_id": "17MpQ4Bbw0Krr7X5bQkAZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "I got here as the restaurant opened but the dining room was about 2/3 full in 30 minutes. I ate here a couple of years ago and today this place seems like a hipster haven. It reminds me of Williamsburg. I don't recall that vibe last visit. The food is still really good. Service was fast and friendly.  The tacos are fresh and the crab dip is definitely worth the trip. I like being able to mix and match taco choices because I can't pick just one. Today I had blackened Mahi and lemon shrimp.  The corn salsa is really good also. I'm not a fan of the rice and beans because it's on the dry side and the rice was kinda hard. It gets loud as the place fills up. This place is a solid 4 stars.

If it's your first time I would recommend the honey soy glazed salmon tacos, perfect flavor of sweet in combination with seafood that's not to fishy.
