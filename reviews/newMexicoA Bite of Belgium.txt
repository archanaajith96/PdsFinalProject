Everyone enjoyed their breakfast. Our meals each came with their fabulous waffles. In case you're wondering Liege style is smaller and denser then what we Americans think of as a Belgian waffle. They were delicious!  Take their advice and get the cream; this is no place to save calories!I had excellent homemade corned beef hash with my waffle. Everyone else had some style of omelette with no complaints and empty plates at the end. Strangely enough the omelettes also came with salad and my aunt loved the house vinaigrette. We came on a Monday but it looks like there's lots of seating for a weekend crowd."}, {"review_id": "BjH3wmR87DNK4xEgg7yYrw", "user_id": "5C3__urpogYGMbaj3GGmeg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Came here as a group on our tour when we were in Las Cruces. One of our tour mates Googled good brunch places and this place came up as one of the top options and a must-try, so naturally we all had to go! It's extremely cute from the exterior and the name of the place is so unique. Naturally, my mind assumed they specialized in waffles, and that was very correct. However, not just any old waffles - Liege waffles and Belgian style waffles. They were extremely unique and fun to try and each of us got a different meal. Let me get the negatives out of the way so you know why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Walking in, you can see some ant traps under the hostess table. They weren't really hidden and we all noticed them. Made us give a quick look to one another. Honestly i could point out a few smaller things that would justify the 4 stars - greens in the side salad looked a bit wilted, and I could argue there weren't many options that included Liege waffles that were savory. BUT!!! On to the amazing things!!! The picture posted is the Ménage a Trois - Bavarian cream, banana cream, Liege waffles, bananas, chocolate ganache, almonds....also got a side of two eggs because I wanted some protein and something not overly sweet for breakfast. Flavor was amazing and consistency of the creams was spectacular!!! Our group all loved our respective meals and we all got something different for variety. After the meal, every single plate was clean - VERY rare for this group of 6...The atmosphere is very mellow. Definitely a family place and gives an atmosphere of a light, good place to chat. Definitely a stereotypical brunch atmosphere. Good for kids and groups!"}, {"review_id": "c9m_ea5_wMXwqsil5NyM-w", "user_id": "Kvz7LooABb5Zt5UL0zizIw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "A truly delightful bunch experience! The front exterior of the building is so unassuming, one wouldn't imagine that the other side of the building beholds a quaint patio for dining  all'aperto (al fresco). The heated patio was quiet and cozy; the air was refreshing. The music added to the experience as it was quite mellowing.Unfortunately, I can't recall the name of my lovely waitress. She was accomodating, yet not intrusive at all. We chatted a bit about my travels and her recent family visit. She was delightful.I ordered the \"Waffles & Omelet\"The deliciously fluffy omelet was topped with ham and Gouda cheese and was crispy around the edges. It's served with Liège waffles and a side salad. I ordered Bavarian cream with my waffles, it was just the right addition of \"sweet\" to balance the savory.The menu was packed with yumminess. Very enjoyable!"}, {"review_id": "WIxEeX5BLsuM0F-AK6CNpw", "user_id": "FgSDkt-3y1Vorv35Hbw96Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Came here 03/07 for breakfast....If it's your first time, you definitely have to order the corned beef hash! It was absolutely mouth watering delicious! We also tried the quiche of the day (vegetable quiche for today). It was delicious and came with a small side salad. Mom ordered the omelette and that was also yummy! Waffle are A MUST!!! Try the Bavarian cream! See photos- Overall, the food was absolutely fresh and delicious! Customer service was great. Our waitress name was Kristen . She was really helpful and sweet. ( : Plenty of parking and restaurant/restrooms were SUPER clean! Thank you Bite of Belgium for a memorable breakfast experience!

We buy them frozen at the store for when we can't get them fresh from a food truck or don't have time to make them at home, so I guess we fall into that category.We found this place on Yelp (of course!) and made the pilgrimage from our hotel before heading out to White Sands. I had one of the specials, which was two waffles, two eggs, and a choice of breakfast meat. While the sausage was nothing spectacular, the eggs were cooked as requested and came out hot. I ordered a side of the custard to try with the waffles. It was good, but I don't think they really need anything on them. If you want to put something on them, I think the Bavarian cream is a better accompaniment than the custard, but that's just my opinion.  The two waffles may look small, but this style of waffles is dense, so looks are deceiving. The waffles were warm and crispy with just the right amount of sweetness. In addition to my eggs and sausage, I ended up eating a third waffle because my son got full. I definitely didn't NEED it, but it was SO tasty... and I don't like to let food go to waste.I would definitely go back when we're in town again."}, {"review_id": "aefaqMoUopEn1c8FT5mOsg", "user_id": "pZ3EtXuJu6SjKVKP_I2Byw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "My family enjoys the liège style of Belgian waffles so we were happy to see this place in Las Cruces.

The place is immaculate and the service is great. I loved that their selections were different than most brunch restaurants.

Gordon Ramsey, please slap some sense into them!! Their prices are through the roof and the food is bland and unappealing. It's the kind of place that caiters to your grandparents...Those expecting foods from Belgium, France, and Germany will be as disappointed as we were. Nope! The only thing on the menu other than standard American fare is Italian food, I kid you not. The Belgium waffle we ordered for desert was not fresh, lacked flavor, and any nuance of passion. These guys need to get their act together. Music is over and the top, full of Italian crooners as if that makes any sense! The decor is an odd mix between Mexican, French, and a Furrs Cafeteria."}, {"review_id": "RVJ8bmI1nL2cs5CvBKNZug", "user_id": "_fm00Nf5vxF4B19Au3bvTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "This has been the best breakfast we have had on our 800 mile road trip the omelette was amazing and the waffles with the Bavarian cream was delish!!!!"}, {"review_id": "-3yv1DtHPt6l7DZd1B7kpQ", "user_id": "uybs6DTJdpUncdcZ7zUEiw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "Traveling through and saw they were open on a Sunday morning and on New Year's Eve....so glad we did!

The waffles are great and the place was very clean and had a good atmosphere. The only reason I did not give it five stars was the portion and size of waffles are small. The quiche was good but did not have enough ham and green chilies in it. When we were finished eating we all had the feeling we had just had appetizers. The funny thing is I had the waffle Trio and it says on the menu enough to feed 3 people. It would be a perfect portion if I was 10.
