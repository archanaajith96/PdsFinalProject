We had the Margherita, the San Gennaro, and the Diavola. My favorite was the San Gennaro and that would get 4 stars in my opinion. The pizzas we ordered came out right after we sat down. My friend told me they bake them at almost 700 degrees which explains why they came out so fast.I didn't like the crust because I felt there was too much crust and it was too thick. It could have been more cooked and crunchy at the bottom. I think they could have used more toppings as well."}, {"review_id": "sKNsY3715V92MODqPixfmg", "user_id": "we5TwucBEYnKvX_R3fuNPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "I adore antico!!! It is by far the best pizza place in Atlanta! It is my highlight of the week since we are going there every weekend, mostly on Sunday nights. Yes it is busy and crowded but it is all worth it. The dough is amazing and the toppings are always great. Try it and you'll love it and believe me, as you get the first bite you know you found what you were always looking for. For me, the only downside is that you cannot count on the 'quality' of your pizza to be consistent. Some days you are getting the dough like it's supposed to be for a pizza napoletana and a perfect ratio of toppings in perfect shape - heavenly delicious. But as the dough is baked very thin, some days you'll end up with pieces falling apart and the toppings all over the place and not enough tomato sauce. That's maybe because the pizza bakers aren't always the same or the might not get the shape right. The two pictures are the perfect example."}, {"review_id": "q7YBZNVTKRqB_6uWKs0jpg", "user_id": "DWcqseFen5lCCk33qQ0vqA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Eat here! You will not be sorry! My favorite part of going to the ATL recently has been having a foodie in my life that's lived there a while and continues to take me to new places. This is one of them and I really enjoyed the pie! It's busy here because people know what's up, it's a little hot in there because they're making delicious pie, and it's a little pricey because.. well because it's worth it! I split a pie with someone on my way to the airport to jet out of town. My mistake.. should have eaten here earlier so that I could have gotten one for later. Life is all about choices I guess... apparently I can't trust myself.. Margherita pie with the sausage, you can thank me later.. Although I'd bet you couldn't go wrong with literally anything else on the menu. Give me long enough and I'll probably be able to back that up with words, I plan to go back and try more and more.

Might I throw a suggestion out there? Antico Pizza is the way to go!Just about a 10 min uber ride from the Marriott Marquis, Antico is located in a semi residential area. It's a cool little innocuous building that if you're not looking hard enough for, you'll miss it! We got a tip to eat here from the locals so we said, hey why not?We ended up ordering about 10 pizzas. Don't let the size of the pizza in the picture fool you. These are good sized pizzas and me being a big eater... skipping lunch... exercising that day, I couldn't hold down more than a pizza and a slice (just to give you a scale to go by!). They have a short menu and there are no substitutions. That's your first indication that they are committed to their pizzas. Love the dough and the flavorful topping combinations that they have. I ended up with the San Gennaro (a sausage/pepper pizza) delish! and the Sophia (love the truffle oil!). They completed each other very well but retrospectively I really should have shared with another person.The best thing to do is to call your order in and then come and pick it up. They do have seating available with large tables in the area where they actually make the pizza which is cool. However they do not take reservations and they do get busy. They make your pizzas when you call and then when you arrive they pop it in the oven to ensure that you're taking home hot pizzas!They have a limited small parking lot outside and they open until they run out of dough... which is I'm not sure what time. Love this place and would highly recommend this to anyone! I'd come back!"}, {"review_id": "ik8nN3sBbTlJqDLOP5BY6A", "user_id": "mf2vSW8eNAbq_981gVJx_g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Antico Pizza is a perfect place for a casual but delicious pizza dinner.

Parking lot is also a bit small! BYOB if you want here!You walk in and you to order in the front. I had the classic tomato sauce pizza with a nice sausage topping. The pizza is definitely pretty big so I would bring a friend to help eat all of it. I really don't think you can go wrong with other options here. Though I hope to come back and try the white sauce options. My pizza was excellently cooked with a nice charring around the edges. The entire pie tasted very fresh, the cheese was great as well. I really don't have too much to say about the pizza, it speaks for itself.I love the classic atmosphere of sitting in a warehouse-like setting and seeing the pizza be made in front of you! The place is very picnic style, with a few long tables spread around the area. They have a small bar filled with different topping options, such as extra parmesan or olive oil.Since it was my first time, I didn't know to order bottled water instead of asking for regular water service, which is a pretty ratchet sink near the back of the restaurant.

Not only that, 2,500+ reviews with a solid 4-star average Yelp rating? That certainly grabbed my attention. In fact, I drove all the way from Asheville, NC (3+ hour drive) and my first stop in Atlanta was this pizza joint. Antico Pizza has a really tiny private parking lot, but my friend and I got here 20 minutes before the closing time and the lot was pretty empty. I have heard that Atlanta has one of the higher crime rates in America and the very first thing I saw upon entering the pizza joint was a security guard standing at the front entrance. The menu is very simple with 10 pre-customized pizzas (5 Rosso [tomato sauce] and 5 Bianca [no tomato sauce - slightly sprinkled with salt and olive oil]) to choose from. The one I wanted to order is Margherita D.O.P., but I couldn't remember what I wanted to order and just let my friend ordered the meatiest pizza - San Gennaro. After you place your order, just find one of communal tables and wait until someone yells your order number. There's a condiment station with garlic, chili, and Parmesan cheese.***San Gennaro (salsiccia, dolce piccante pepper, bufala, cipolline - $22): It was big enough to share between two adults. Overall this was a very meaty and cheesy thin crust pizza with fluffy & airy dough and slightly burnt crust, and fresh out of the ovens. I liked everything about this pizza ... except the toppings. So I ended up dumping all of fresh garlic on top of my pizza.***Even though I like few other pizza places (e.g. Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix and Piece Brewery and Pizzeria in Chicago) more than Antico Pizza, Antico Pizza is still one of the better pizza joints that I have tried."}, {"review_id": "Q2gJKum8emyY8v7Jh4qJdg", "user_id": "ekuPSwwFGF66F7YFrSYe7Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "I have never been to Italy, but this place is as close as it will get!

This is the pizza I ordered and fell in love with, every bite tasted like a warm homey gooey delicious cheesy lasagna dish. The pizza came out quite promptly, waited 10 mins tops. I would eat here again in a heartbeat.

He's taken me to some amazing restaurants in Atlanta, and so when I'm in town to visit him, I enjoy just being told where to go and what to eat. He'd told me about Antico Pizza a few times, but we just never had the opportunity to check it out, until my most recent visit. He considers it, by far, the best pizza in Atlanta, so I was really stoked to try it out.My personal verdict? Solid pizza, bu not necessarily a place I'd go out of my way to return to on a future visit to Atlanta. With over 2,500 reviews, they obviously don't need me and have done quite well for themselves! But my review goes along with the 4-star consensus: I'm a fan, but it didn't make me want to climb a mountain and profess my love while holding a megaphone powerful enough for all of Atlanta to hear. (Yes, that is the exact feeling I get from the nearly 1,000 5-star reviews I've written in the past.)Maybe it was Jon's hype, but I'd like to think I put that aside and judged this pizza on its own merit.

We ordered the San Gennaro and two glasses of Cabernet. Although they sell wine now, they'll still allow you to bring your own bottle. Seating was sparse. Two people left the front countertop just as we finished our placing our order, so we grabbed those seats. The food came out surprisingly quickly. I am happy to report that the San Gennaro remains my favorite pizza of all time! It comes with a light drizzle of marinara, onions, mozzarella cheese, sweet peppers and Italian sausage. It's divine!
