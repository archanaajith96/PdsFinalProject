Having just move to Wilmington we chose the neighborhood around Trolly Square given the many options for dining. Scalessa's is exactly the spot to satisfy our Italian cravings. Everything is great, but it is the Meatball sub that I get every time and then share what the rest of the family gets."}, {"review_id": "oZ_TIICT6osgzfQPlUQ_MA", "user_id": "G1cT_L6toouKCIehhgCzWQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "I got the meatball salad and it was SOOOO DELICIOUS!! I've been wanting to try this place for such a long time and today, I was finally able to! If you live in Delaware and are looking for a good Italian restaurant, then you need to come here. I highly recommend the dish that I ordered--you get 2 meatballs and salad. I really liked the atmosphere too; the place is small, yet not cramped feeling. Furthermore, there are not many tables, but if you go at the right time, you won't need to wait for a seat. Ordering occurs at the counter and you can choose to pay before receiving your meal or afterwards. Also, even though you orders at the counter, they will bring your food out to you. Lastly, I liked how they had 3 televisions playing The Godfather and how the music they were playing was country. Overall, the place had a good vibe and the food was delicious! Would definitely recommend and will definitely return in the near future."}, {"review_id": "77dCwvVHzC0O1Xq0T48L1A", "user_id": "k-CSH3dtSyglSmjHti4haQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "Stopped at this little gem driving up to New York from Virginia when I googled best places to eat in  Wilmington, Delaware. The food was great and really reasonably priced. I ordered the chicken scalessa which was a chicken cutlet with a cream and cheese sauce with crab. My boyfriend ordered the chicken parm which was also great. Both dishes came with a side of pasta we were both convinced was homemade and a salad. Definitely recommend!"}, {"review_id": "6WiSNLQ3hYrd3Or09kKIGw", "user_id": "AxsYKmqgcbaton18IfzwWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Meatball salad, gnoccis, lasagna, cheesesteaks, porkette and more.  You can't go wrong w anything here!"}, {"review_id": "dBbQo8jPyjdZ0cZc-xA7cw", "user_id": "eY2ZgvK7gmUS_kUQWZYk9Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/7/2017", "text": "Decided to stop in today for lunch boy was I glad I did.  Got the porkette sandwich loaded and it was one of the best pork sandwiches I have ever had.  The meat was flavorful but not overly seasoned, juicy and the addition of the broccoli rabe gave the sandwich a slightly healthier and fresh taste.  The broccoli rabe was cooked to be soft but still retained its full flavor.  The portion was very generous.  The only compliant and why this isn't a 5/5 is the fact they charged 2 dollars or an 8oz bottle of soda.  I think the sandwich is worth every penny but the soda was way to steep.  Small menu which is great, that means they can concentrate and get it right.  Can't wait come back for their home made meatballs.Update,  Was contacted by Yelper Don S, whom I assumed was the owner, and was offered a refund for my soda:-)  This is definitely above and beyond what I expected.  I politely declined but am thoroughly impressed.  If they apply the same dedication to customer satisfaction overall to their food, which based on experience so far they seem to, then what more can be said other than bravo!  I look forward to my next visit even more now.  Keep up the great work!  Maybe get a soda machine:-)"}, {"review_id": "lJ3XMH8IVitNDn_ZRbbtPQ", "user_id": "v4PsfOemxX8jooOLMsX1aQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Excellent.

There were tables available and the waiter was welcoming. We ordered the meatball salad, Grandma's gravy, SausageBeans & Greens, and Gnocchi Verdi. All entrees tasted great and had different flavors.The reason for the 3 stars is because of the water. Our waiter asked what we wanted to drink and we told him that we wanted regular ice water. We were given 4 bottles of water, the kind of plastic bottled water you get at Costco for $4 for a 24-pack, and then charged $8 for the 4 bottles on our check. I paid it without saying anything, but left feeling completely ripped off.To the restaurant, if you're reading this -- if you are going to charge for water, at least warn the customers so they have a chance to change their mind and make a different selection.Ironically, we went to shop at a furniture store after dinner, and they offered us the same bottled water for free while browsing their store."}, {"review_id": "a-rbNx-7hOzIbHi1Z4Nx2g", "user_id": "IfNgjjHorQjIv5pAlS-3-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/23/2017", "text": "If you want an amazing meatball parm you better come to Scalessa's -- I have to tell you the meatballs here are better than my Mom's and I am only telling you this because she is not on Yelp. Scalessa's has 8 tables, classic decor, and friendly staff. The owner was either in the kitchen or in the dining area; great guy and greeted all the local folksI ordered the meatball parm with sharp provolone (you get to choose the provolone). The roll was soft with a crunchy outside and held up nicely to the sauce. The meatballs were the size of my fist...juicy, flavorful, piping hot -- you could see the steam coming off these beauties. The marinara was delicious and perfectly salted. The husband ordered the Italian. It was a generous portion of cold cuts on the same kind of roll as my meatball parm. He loved it! The Italian had genoa salami, cappocola, pepper ham, prosciutto, and provolone. The pepper ham really made the sub  -- who knows where they get their inventory but it is quality stuff.The butter cake is delicious! It's gooey, sweet, and oh soooo buttery."}, {"review_id": "VEZTjXG6hmiAQk6LdJeTbA", "user_id": "BrgCKAB50j7jkg_YMTY8oA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/16/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We gave Scalessa's another go and this is the Scalessa's that I remember. My family had been here many times in the past and had wonderful food, so we decided to try it again. I am so happy we did because it would have been such a shame to miss out on the delightful gnocchi we had. These were the gnocchi I remember, light little pillows of flavor! Of course you cannot come to Scalessa's without getting their fabulous meatball and UNREAL butter cake. I really cannot say enough good things about Scalessa's. We had one bad experience with one dish in the many years that we have been going to Scalessa's. When I advised them of it, not only were they apologetic, but they wanted to make it right. I think that says a lot about what kind of restaurant they are. They truly care about their food and want it to be perfect every time.  We enjoyed the rest of our meal, so they could have ignored the one complaint, but they didn't and they went above and beyond making it right. Really a class act establishment and I will be eating my gnocchi, meatballs and butter cake here for years to come."}, {"review_id": "HI0rpQhO4ymNdz8GTaaD-w", "user_id": "hLhZ6nq0mKpzk4EITQ0pJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/10/2017", "text": "Delicious taste of homemade Italian goodness.

It was excellent. My wife got meatball and sausage with rigatoni, the meatball is very good but the sausage was not hot (temperature wise) and a bit tough. Fiends had pasta  and meat ball. Loved it and his wife had the sausage bean and greens. She loved it. But her sausage wAs pretty toothy too. The butter cake is as crazy good. They don't have a liquor license. But it is also not a BYOB. Some arcane law. It took away from the meal. Overall worth it. The red gravy is good but not like my Nona's , but what is? Paper cups for coffee. Really?

I side with everyone else when I say this joint is 5 stars, from price to portion size to the serious quality of the eats here. I've had the breakfast sandwich, several sammies and a sausage and bean dinner dish over the past few weeks. The portions are gargantuan and every item was excellent on its own. I highly recommend the Porkette sammy with broccoli rabe and long hots, and the breakfast sandwich is massive and criminally underpriced at $5.
