We were passing by here and I noticed there was a long line. I quickly yelped the location and told my husband this was a must stop according to my yelp family. We are from Ca on a road trip..and I've never tasted custard like this. I sampled the \"Green Chile Sundae\" but it was to sweet for my taste. I ended up with the rocky road which was fantastic!!! If we are ever in the area, I will be back.

This time we enjoyed: the spicy dog and original dog. My companion enjoyed the spicy dog explaining the sweetness of the Dijon mustard that accompanied the green chili on the all beef Nathan's hot dog as delicious. For dessert we experienced the Custard sundae with blueberries and raspberries. This custard is the BEST custard I have ever had, heavy yet perfectly whipped. Some custards leave you wondering if you should be paying for a cup of melted ice cream -  NOT the case at Caliche. Caliche custard is purposeful and made with excellence."}, {"review_id": "ZEi7Vq-ppWo6SSGIERnV2Q", "user_id": "RdLTUqd662yMT1IcCG5sQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/5/2017", "text": "Perfect stop on a warm evening!

Everything tasted fresh and the staff was super friendly all while being helpful with fun stuff to try on their menu.  Last but not least, the custard sundae it was warm brownies covered in custard and topped with the most delicious fresh pecans!  I'd go back just for the pecans on custard any day!!"}, {"review_id": "fDJXS_ZJSdpV7N-SgF-oxg", "user_id": "WvgGbixWf8PVSQkq5mdWVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/25/2017", "text": "First of all the custard is delicious.

It doesn't look like much when you're passing by, but it'll definitely grab your attention since the locals flock to it. My husband and I went after a drive through the back roads and it was the perfect snack for the drive back.The line moved pretty quickly so before we knew it, we were at the front and I still had no idea how to say \"Caliche\". Apparently it's pronounced \"cah-leach-ee\". So I ordered a small Caliche with cookie dough, caramel, and salted pecans. This combo was a shot in the dark, but it was absolutely delicious. The caramel is thick so it stands up to the creamy frozen custard. The cookie dough was a just the right amount of sweet. And every time I got a bite of the salted pecans I was in heaven. Those salted pecans are just the perfect addition to an otherwise sweet treat. It gives you just enough saltiness... so delicious!If you choose not to go through the drive-thru, you can walk up and order. You'll be either eating on the benches or your car, but it's a fun little stop especially if you have kiddos with. There is no bathroom though so make sure you take care of that beforehand.100% recommend! The only place in the area that I've seen with deliciously creamy frozen custard. Make it a point to stop at Caliche's."}, {"review_id": "rjSbbuQ8tFPGtXqHbDKVOA", "user_id": "v23if8vekIOglVGm80251g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/25/2015", "text": "Caliches has been a longtime favorite. I remember being ecstatic when my parents would take me here for a reward after acing my spelling tests... This was back when it was still known as Scoopy's! My favorite thing to get here is the mount brownie. I like to substitute the marshmallow sauce for their warm caramel. Not sure about their signature sundaes? Try a U-Name-It and choose create your own little piece of heaven. Their prices are a bit steep, but the portions are definitely generous. Their service is always great! They are generally staffed by high school/college students who know the menu well and are willing to provide recommendations. They also have very unique toppings. Green chile fanatic?! Try some on your frozen custard. Have pets? Bring them with you for a FREE poochie cone! They have a few tables and benches where you can sit and enjoy your sweet treat. They have a kind of old vibe, from the uniforms he employees wear, to the actual look of the establishment.I don't live in Las Cruces anymore, but anytime I visit, this is on the top of my to do list!"}, {"review_id": "PF76UkWFvISjFkMCknEqMw", "user_id": "hntJTn1Ev6TXfusbvTdutw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/11/2016", "text": "OMG....soooooo yummy and I'm not even a huge custard fan.The waiter last night said we had to try Caliche's so here I am.  I ordered the birthday cake caliche...vanilla custard blended with birthday cake topped with sprinkles (whipped cream too, but I asked for it without) and it's heaven in a bite.  DELICIOUS!"}, {"review_id": "bWdK9MSkPx8kruX299ZvSw", "user_id": "Hxuil5JKAfI8TilSctya8w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/14/2017", "text": "Went through the drive thru...the gal taking my order was super nice.

Think sonic, which I believe is ubiquitous enough everyone can relate. Just replace the window service with a drive through and you've got Caliche's. When we first approached the window, the guy at the register was super wonderful (his name escapes me... We'll rename him Bob). We told Bob that we were from out of town and he gave us samples of their chocolate and vanilla frozen custard. Oh man, if you've never had frozen custard I strongly advise you head to Las Cruces and try some at Caliche's. So much better than normal ice-cream. It's like the American answer to Italian gelato. Frozen custard is as creamy as you would expect, without the heaviness.Caliche's claim to fame is a Green Chile Sundae that Bob said was best with salted pecans. Spice on a sundae? Questionable. To assuage my doubts, Bob had a sample whipped up! Sweet vanilla, great salty crunch from the pecans, with a spicy chaser that tingles the throat after you swallow and lingers until your next bite. Don't get me wrong, it is delicious. I just would not deal well with a full order. Too much happening in my mouth at once.  Instead I ordered a Mount Brownie Sundae. Two slices of warm brownie, slathered in hot chocolate fudge, two generous scoops of vanilla frozen custard, and a cherry on top. They give you your option of nuts (salted or unsalted pecans, peanuts, and pistachios). I chose pistachios, I love their butteriness! The sundae also comes with marshmallows, though the gelatin made them a no go for me. This sundae was a knock out way to end a mini-food tour of Las Cruces with Mexican food at Andele's Dog House and Thai food at Thai Delight. My inner fat kid was so happy!!!"}, {"review_id": "pmTkzbS0sqZ3IWJ4CS7WcA", "user_id": "HCoKPuFAHrTkPPQeHcxdmA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/9/2016", "text": "I stayed in Las Cruces for three nights while on vacation and I'm so disappointed that I only had the chance to come to Caliche's once!  I had the Mango Dango with salted pecans and it was so good.  Service was friendly and extremely efficient.  They had our sundaes ready before we even finished paying."}, {"review_id": "9bMZA8Cf7ax63mxPV2jq7A", "user_id": "EDw67E-BJELjhU6gQLRRNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/7/2015", "text": "Amazing frozen custard!
