Simply the best fish and shrimp tacos ever. As soon as we walked up with my dog, the gentleman working came outside with a clean aluminum to-go dish filled with water for the pup to drink.  He literally went from taking an order to bringing our dog water in seconds. It was just a great way to experience what would be one of the best meals of my life. Everything is cooked to perfection, and I've been dreaming of returning.  This is my second time and the staff has always been great."}, {"review_id": "DWWUxyhDTTr9XxAMgNAK3g", "user_id": "oeMgBBMnqZQPsbhAAryptA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/11/2016", "text": "A little salty for my taste, but the chicken tacos were easily the BEST tacos I've ever had in my life.

So, I brought her here after hearing from a few friends that it was really good. Well, they are fantastic.  My wife loved their tamales.  I had their beef tacos, and they were absolutely the best tacos I have ever eaten. I highly recommend you check this place out.  It is a cut above every single Mexican place I've ever been to. It's small, quaint, and eccentrically decorated, but very cool. Next time in, I'm going to try their house-made pork chili... and more tacos."}, {"review_id": "Kxzn16m5LPWUYez9KNlDmw", "user_id": "IKOBZpumRmcnm0FiWVGjzQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/20/2017", "text": "Excellent pork tamales and chicken tacos - quick and great  service !

This place is very small but delivers big flavors with a lot of heart in their customer service. The tamales were excellent and the \"shak\" sauce served along side was delicious and unlike any hot sauce I've ever had. I would give this place 5 stars but I felt that 2 beers, chips & salsa a half order of tamales for $20 didn't seem like the greatest value.

It is the perfect small venue with reasonable prices and very good flavor. I enjoy getting the burritos, since there isn't a chipotle near by, the tamale shak is a nice substitute. The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is because they do not have a child seat.

It's worth going out of your way for. Do yourself and someone you care about the favor and get thier entire menu in your system.I love me some good Mexican food and they've got the Juice over here, y'all. It's all about simplicity; when you're able to make something taste extrodinary with just a few, basic ingredients, you know you're onto something. The menu is simple, nothing overwhelming and has mostly everything you could want out of a small Mexican joint like this.The place is quaint and decorated with that feel of this Carribean, Mexican, off-the-highway joint you might find in a Central/South American country. Vibrant colors, a few select beers on draft and some seating both in and outside for those nicer days. There's live music here also on days when the weather permits, I suggest coming down and spark up a conversation with Wendy (one of the owners), she's pretty awesome and can make a mean quesadilla!My first visit I went with the shrimp tacos which I took to-go. Didn't even make it out of the parking lot with them. I wanted to go back in and order two more but I had to battle the fat guy within and show some restraint. But less than a week later I was back for round two and the shrimp and chicken quesadilla was my next choice. Perfect, grilled shrimp and chicken cheesiness!Wendy asked if I had their tamales (which I have not), that is up next which might beeee...oh I dunno...tomorrow?!Newest addiction in Gulfport, great job!"}, {"review_id": "lqaDmj0JldeXZq0iTNER2g", "user_id": "ra0IPdc5GwtXfjQxnUPQQg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2017", "text": "It is definitely a shak.

What I really liked is the speed of this place. It's very difficult to find fast AND really good Mexican, but this place made it happen.
