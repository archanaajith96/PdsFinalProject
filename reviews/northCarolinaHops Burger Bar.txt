There is always a long line especially if you go for dinner but it's definitely worth the wait. They also have a great beer selection and their burgers are probably some of the best burgers I've ever had. I get the spicy goat which is a beef patty, red pepper jelly, bacon, greens and goat cheese. It's my go to burger and the pub chips I get with it never disappoint. I highly recommend Hops."}, {"review_id": "xqTbEeFg87w36XbUXN1Ezg", "user_id": "6IyRPTXsX9k_18byVkF_uw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Hops Burger is the best burger place in Greensboro. They're consistent and opened somewhat late, which is always a plus.I've had their truffle oil fries, fried green tomato, dry rubbed wings, the North Carolinian burger and the Hops Classic burger. My favorites: the dry rubbed wings and the North Carolinian burger. I love adding an egg onto my burgers and the fact that the North Carolinian comes with a burger means someone's thought it out. The dry rubbed wings were crispy and well-flavored. Overall the rest of the food was also good, but I thought those two were the best and worth pointing out.The service has always been good, I usually come later in the evening when it's not as busy. Worth checking out if you're in the area."}, {"review_id": "AFpSj-i9dZpmtID9JsmRMA", "user_id": "wovQeYjN52dmIhrePPgM7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I've started to eat almost all plant and fish protein but that has not stopped me from enjoying Hops!I've had the Tuna sandwich on a gluten-free bun (for carb counting reasons only) and it was great!

Guess what? Still freaking awesome. Still the best burgers in Greensboro despite a lot of very good competition, even immediately flanking it! You can guarantee you'll get a great burger here each time, cooked properly, and with a side ranging from great fries to veggies tempura.Also, here's a reason to still use Facebook... their weekly special they post there is going to make you want to eat you phone/computer monitor. Lots of interesting creations are always showing up here.It's popular for a reason! You'll have the best luck if you come here before noon or after 2:30 on any given day. If it's nice out, the line moves quickly, as the patio provides a lot of extra tables."}, {"review_id": "9_ZrbNelcUoG4hFtQCWG4Q", "user_id": "0dcknuP3VLaO_Q6ugNmLQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "WTF!!!  Sooooo delicious and worth the 40 minute wait.

The burgers are every bit as delicious as I anticipated. I had the Spicy Goat with the Sweet Thai Chili fries as a side. My husband had the North Carolinian with regular fries. What really impressed me about these burgers was the juiciness and flavor of the meat. I've been to a lot of burger places in the Triangle and have found most burger patties rely heavily on toppings for the flavoring, with the meat itself having very little flavor; that's wonderfully not the case at Hop's. The goat cheese, bacon, and pepper jelly were lovely additions to my burger. The bacon rounded out the sweetness of the jelly, and I love that they don't skimp on the amount of goat cheese. The brioche bun wasn't a dry, crumbly mess, as I have experienced with a lot of brioche buns. It was light, airy, and fresh - and most importantly, it let the burger shine. I hate eating burgers that taste mostly like bread. My husband really enjoyed the North Carolinian and had the same rave review of the meat. He does want the Yelp community to know that this particular burger could benefit from a bit more pimiento cheese. The fries were really tasty, too. They were crisp and light, with the right amount of salt. I personally wouldn't order the Sweet Thai Chili fries again though. Those first few bites were absolutely delicious, but I found the Thai Chili sauce to sort of overwhelm the fries with subsequent bites. Then again, you should take into account that, while I love spice, I typically need something cooling to break up the heat. I think they could have benefited from a little less chili sauce and slightly more lime sour cream. I found myself picking through my pile, looking for less sauce-laden fries to eat. Amazing experience overall, and I can't wait to return. Man, I'm excited about this place coming to Chapel Hill, too!"}, {"review_id": "JdVFLn--s6OI2zUhU9DboA", "user_id": "Ih14pDtAlM308G7mcSW5Ng", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/11/2017", "text": "My wife and I were on a road trip to Winston-Salem - Guns 'N' Roses!!! - and decided to stop off for a bite and a brew.We were seated outside, and had a great time.

I ordered a spicy goat burger with sweet potato fries. I got to choose my own bun, and I was pleased with the wheat. The combination of goat cheese, sweet and spicy pepper jelly, and apple smoked bacon were an excellent and creative mix of flavors.  I was impressed. The bacon was actually really tasty and not dried out. My fiancé ordered the college blues burger with a bison burger substitute, which he really enjoyed. We both loved the fries, but would suggest a little more seasoning on the regular fries. Great beer selection; many local choices. It was a Sunday night and just about every seat was filled. It wasn't overly loud though and we could still talk to each other without yelling.  We would definitely visit again en route to the mountains."}, {"review_id": "g2VgX2WujllmPNrcP54Sdg", "user_id": "5uJTJnINckyAchF6mf7sLg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Food as good as its reputation.

My favorite signatures are the Diablo and the Pickleback. Since I was craving some spice I went with the Diablo. I substituted my beef patty out for the Nutty Pattie; which had a black bean base and a couple types of nuts fused together. IT WAS GREAT, I said to myself this is so good I feel like I'm actually eating meat. The Diablo also comes with jalapeño bacon, which I gave to my friend. The burger also has cheese, jalapeños, onions, and guacamole on it as well. Ny favorite side item is the sweet potatoes fries, which they have perfected here. They add a pinch of what tasted like brown sugar on top and they have a nice sauce to dip!Hops is never the wrong decision, take a visit, your taste buds will thank you!"}, {"review_id": "H9-lcatjBWhCWD7mwlXm0w", "user_id": "vWKUOXfGxjOAPfItsDzrSQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Came to Hops yesterday on a recommendation and it was fantastic!

Overview: 1000% coming back for the Fried Green Tomato & Goat Cheese appetizer, French Onion burger was a flop. I thought the French Onion Burger may be cool since it had French Onion Gravy in the side - nah. Gravy was bland as heck. I ordered a side of lettuce and tomato to put on, and the it became a standard burger with caramelized onions. I can go to Five Guys for that. I also tried the Thai Chili fries, since I'm very into the sweet-spicy flavor... flopped harder than the burger. It tasted like straight up buffalo sauce, complete with ranch on top. Did the kitchen make a mistake?What saved my entire meal from being a regret high in calories was my appetizer. Love fried green tomatoes, love goat cheese. The fry was perfection: crispy, not dripping in oil, great batter-to-tomato ratio. The tangy-ness of the goat cheese and green tomato really complimented the fry and creamy dipping sauce. Next time I visit Hops, I'll try out a different burger/fries and see if it can measure up to this fantastically bomb appetizer."}, {"review_id": "--tleoMHqNvOlBoSkp9QmA", "user_id": "mO48cLg_AH5snLlk9YnWAA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/26/2017", "text": "I've found burger heaven.
