Everything here is that good!Breakfast bagels are the winner here.. all on that purple taro bagel. They're fresh, clean, and delicious. Comes with chips or salad. Their açaí bowls are an absolute favorite of ours as well. Coffees are good and their specialty drinks have island flavors to them that are nice. Have yet to try the other food items yet but they're on our list. Free 1 hr validated parking in the garage. Only reason why I don't hesitate to come here lol."}, {"review_id": "mGzeoiCwhNgrfKFyCeI1AA", "user_id": "-2LMSDH0mOSgRnYcqicReQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "This place is like crack!Literally the BESt flavored coffee out there!!!

I have been here a few times and have gotten their acai bowls and poke bowls which I have always enjoyed.Yesterday we tried the Haupia Moana bowl and I think that might be the best Acai bowl I ever had!!! I got the large size since my husband and I were sharing and it was a pretty good size large, esp for us since we eat a lot. They are super generous with their delicious granola, which also seems to be mixed in to the acai (unless there is so much granola that you just get some with every spoonful of acai). The large scoop of haupia cream was just OMG yummmmm. And the papaya? How can you not love papaya. Plus I don't get to eat papaya too often so when I see an acai bowl includes this, I jump on it! There were also bananas with toasted coconut on top. Drool drool drool.We also got the spicy ahi poke bowl with the 5-grain rice which is like a purple sticky rice. SO GOOD!!! I try not to eat a lot of rice but come onnnnnn, when it's this good, you gotta mop it up! The spicy ahi had the perfect amount of spicy (so says my husband who doesn't love spicy as much as I do) and also had some chunks of avocado. Yum. There was also nori (toasted seaweed), some green seaweed, and ginger completing the bowl. Very delicious poke bowl. I guess since it's waikiki, it may be a little on the pricy side. My 2 items cost a little over $28. Expensive but def worth it!"}, {"review_id": "6JeGfDGitu0HzlRJd3LiZQ", "user_id": "W_MuoJIhSJYCXJ3q6TkyWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Definitely need to come here anytime during the day. From iced lattes to açaí bowls, I could eat here every meal. Their drinks are island unique, I haven't seen anything like this on the mainland. There are about 4 different options for açaí bowls, but their original was the most popular and did taste the best from the ones I tried. Lines could be long, but their service is pretty fast. There are a good amount of seats, but be prepared to wait if you decide to order food. Off peak times are easier to find a seat, but with a great location in Waikiki, this is a can't miss coffee shop."}, {"review_id": "mjh803WN6AHXYZRaGwq2MQ", "user_id": "T-k9ioVv-8laNEyMYQ_jVw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "We went around 10 pm and it was soooo crowded that we barely found a place to sit. Not sure if that's normal or because a tour was brought there as it seemed half the tables were from the same group.We got an acai bowl and it was really good! Lots of fresh fruit with a touch of honey. The granola was yummy as well.People seemed to enjoy their coffees. They sell cute soaps and lotions as well as powdered forms of their ice blended drinks.The shop is upstairs in a corner of the mall.

This place was always crazy busy when I went, but I was willing to wait for the deliciousness. It also gives me time to shop around their inventory of souvenirs, coffee beans, drinkware, and food items.I went here 3 times during my last vacation. My orders included: an iced coconut macadamia latte, the frozen coconut kona mocha, the taro bagel with a side of coconut peanut butter, and the lilikoi acai bowl.All of the coffee I tried was great, but the standout was that frozen coconut kona mocha! I got it without whipped cream (to feel better about myself I guess?) but it didn't need it. It was such a refreshing choice, and the coconut wasn't overpowering at all. It was a perfect tropical coffee. The taro bagel is a must-have! I believe they automatically give cream cheese but ask for the coconut peanut butter as a replacement! It's a combination of flavors I never knew I needed. I am now obsessed with finding taro bread (because I bought a jar of coconut peanut butter here to bring home) in the Bay Area to recreate the amazing flavors I had here.The lilikoi acai bowl is probably my favorite and freshest acai bowl that I've had in Hawaii. First off, the acai bowl was a giant mug that I immediately bought to take home. I loved it so much. But the fruit on top of the acai blend was just too much to handle in terms of flavor. So so fresh and it made me feel like I was starting my day on a healthy note. I didn't get to try any of the hot food but it looked fantastic when the plates passed me by. The wait is worth it, believe me! The seating is not as abundant as it should be but the cafe is pretty tiny. My best bet would be to take everything to-go, and then head over to Royal Hawaiian's food court which is minutes away, and enjoy it at a table there. Plenty of seating available!"}, {"review_id": "f0XmrL5XFce-bHgMYJlO5w", "user_id": "clLXGPY3c_--AVhnEXl0Ew", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Inside Royal Hawaiian Center on the 2nd floor, you'll find this quaint little coffee shop that sells everything from Hawaiian products to coffee mugs. I've never seen this place without a line but it does go by quickly and the turnaround for a table is the same too. Their açaí bowls are the top sellers but they do offer other items on the menu such as coffee, salads, sandwiches etc. The lilikoi (passion fruit) açaí bowl is pretty to look at and even better to eat. Filled to the rim with fruits, granola and açaí, this healthy bowl can be consumed anytime of the day! They do add honey to it, which I thought was a little too sweet for me, but you can ask them to leave it out when you order."}, {"review_id": "LCOtei9Ba7gcQB8Y2gfGsw", "user_id": "MOew2pbb0w6uLqiJTbgnUw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Coming from the mainland, you're bound to wake up early in the morning because of the time difference.

They have great Acai Bowls with their Original and Cocoa Moana bowls being our favorite. The coffee is what you would expect and they had a Ginger Chai Tea Latte that was excellent.Word of caution - get here early if you can.

To be more specific about my experience at your location, the cashier openly rolled her eyes and expressed her impatience with the guest in front of me. She was sighing openly and spoke in harsh tones with the guest, when the guest was not understanding her questions. When the order was finished and the guest walked away, the cashier smirked at her coworker and rolled her eyes before greeting the next guest. Thankfully it wasn't me, I had the cashier next to her.

It's located in a shopping mall, on the 2nd floor in the heart if Waikiki. The line was out of the door on a Monday morning at 10am, but I spent no more than 10 mins in line. The acai bowl I ordered also came out quick. Less than 10 mins. I love the decor and aesthetics of this mall, as well as this local cafe. My acai bowl came with a cute little flower. I was drawn in. It's really difficult to find seating. I had a party of 5, and one of us had to stand. Although this cafe gets super packed; it's not obnoxiously loud here.  There is also more seating outside the cafe, which I found out after my meal haha.The acai bowl I ordered was good, but I didn't like the ratio of the ingredients in my bowl. It's also on the pricey side. ~$12 for a 16oz. By the time I was finished with my solid foods, I was left with 1/2 of the acai/smoothie left. I had to give the rest to my friend.

The bowl was also on the sweeter side for me. 01.10.18Came here again the next day for breakfast to try their Ube bagel! Sadly, I couldn't really taste the ube-ness. Overall, it just tasted like a regular bagel but a little starchier than normal. Don't think Ube bagel is super worth trying.01.12.18The tropical sensation (iced tea with guava and fresh berries) was a refreshing drink, but nothing too special.

Located in the heart of Waikiki near the beach, restaurants, various hotels, and several other shops made it very convenient to walk here during our stay. We have walked here as early as their opening time (6am) and this place was already packed with a line down the elevator. Don't be intimidated by their long lines, it usually moves pretty fast. If you're just there for their coffee/tea, there is a separate line for your order.Must try their blended coffees and Acai Bowl if you're looking for something to satisfy your sweet tooth! They also sell Kona coffee bean covered chocolate and a variety of Whole Bean and Ground Coffees which makes for a great souvenir. My only gripe would be to request more seating if space allows.
