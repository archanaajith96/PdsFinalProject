This is my third visit, and each time it exceeds expectations. The first couple times I had their ricotta blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup (an option I love, as despise the fake stuff) which were excellent, so this time decided on an omelet. It  did not disappoint. Not the cheapest breakfast in the world, but soo good that did not mind paying a little more. It had the right amount of ingredients. Often times the extras are so jammed in and you can't even taste the eggs. The only aspect I did not care for was the extra 50 cent charge for an English muffin.Plenty of room between tables which I also like. Service a tad slow all three times, but still love it here."}, {"review_id": "cbPj6wllDnG3KXCByUH4yg", "user_id": "yXnEnkRdQLEb6iPxoS1ZTw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "3.5 stars. Being that this is one of the top rated brunch spots in the area, I went in with high expectations. Although my expectations were not quite met, my friend and I both enjoyed our meals. We started off with pierogi fries, which had a nice crispy exterior that yielded to a creamy potato filling. I then ordered the Bayside omelette. Crabmeat is listed as the first ingredient in the description, but it was not incorporated within the omelette; rather, it was sprinkled lightly on top of my omelette as a garnish. A little bland, but a light drizzle of hot sauce went a long way. The potatoes were tasty and seasoned just right. Overrated, but not a bad option for brunch. There are many better brunch spots in the Lehigh Valley area."}, {"review_id": "CH7oaHpRJ_4UHbvBtPkaqQ", "user_id": "POd51OpB5sCb-GXjPtJskA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Had pretty high hopes for this pace. It was Sunday and busy.  First the positive - my Heuvos Rancheros was excellent. In our party of 6, I am pretty that I was the only person giving their meal a 5 star though.  The eggs my mother law had looked like they were poured from a carton and had absolutely no flavor. They were sent back. Pancakes that came out as \"sides\" were about 1/8\" thick and you get two. Definitely not the experience at other breakfast places. Probably about $.15 worth of batter. Service was so-so but with it being as busy as it was, I wasn't that disappointed in it. During the entire meal experience, I had one cup of coffee with one refill halfway through my meal. Our server was pretty hasty on getting us to place our order then really nonexistent the rest of the time. Again, I attribute that to Sunday morning and a line out the door of people waiting."}, {"review_id": "b8vuBu516AnzjIQIbuNVIw", "user_id": "J1Kf61Jt346SF5CJ7wcl2g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/24/2017", "text": "I'm not sure why the place has near 5 stars, but it is tasty food. Hubs, the boy, and I stopped in on our way home from the 30th annual Celtic Classic. Yelp rarely steers us wrong so when we saw this close by spot with such great ratings we couldn't resist. We had no wait which was pleasantly surprising based on previous reviews. I think they are trying to churn tables quickly due to popularity and that comes out in some of the food. Breakfast potatoes were undercooked and my toast was really nothing more than warm bread. And that was the second batch I had to order because first set was slathered with butter when I asked for dry. We ordered Chick'N Waffles, Build-your-own-Omelette and a Pumpkin Pancake special for the little one. Hubs enjoyed the chicken, fried crispy and sans the country gravy as requested. The waffles were basically one small step above freezer waffles. My omelette with egg whites was tasty if not a bit greasy and lacking in veggies. For the extra charges you would think they could spare a few more spinach leaves. Toast and potatoes were a mess though. Cold, awfully undercooked, and under seasoned. The Pumpkin Pancake was absolutely delicious. There was a small pecan cream cheese swirl on top which was just the right amount of creamy on the fluffy, huge, crispy skinned pancake. Pretty ideal actually. Which tells you to stick to the sweet dessert-like items and you probably won't go wrong. We left full and sated but the cost isn't worth a wait for breakfast food and the food had its ups and downs. Would probably try a few more places in the area before considering going back here."}, {"review_id": "AF5ArU71cS4Vp53TPNJLJQ", "user_id": "ooChnFeHCJElljFhiZXfrA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Griddle 145 has become my favorite weekend breakfast spot. The only thing I don't like about this place is that there aren't more vegan options. While the selection of vegan options is small, each one is very delicious with my favorite being the coconut banana French toast. They also serve my favorite brand of coffee so that's a plus. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is casual and upbeat. I would recommend this restaurant for breakfast/brunch, but hope some new vegan items are added to the menu in the future!"}, {"review_id": "bl5sNq_G9cR3_zNv3gOIJg", "user_id": "ijd0R0Co7UCJnFfuEeFCog", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Awesome brunch!

Our server was very nice, we said it was our first time there and she recommended some things. Free mimosas was a nice treat too.  The food was disappointing. Nothing was really outstanding and everything was coated w a weird tasting sauce. Not into Mexican spicy so I was not happy.

Our favorites were the coffee ( organic locally roasted!) the cleanliness and service (fast friendly and clean!)We had huevos and non-huevos rancheros meals with coffees and tomato juice. Overall we really enjoyed the place, will come again. And recommend it.To make this a five star experience overall, a couple of suggestions; ask them to \"go lite\" on the potatoes/home fries and to cut them up small.  However, if you love home-fries I'm sure you'll be quite happy as is.  The other thing would be to price the non-huevos rancheros lower. While the flavors were great, the reality was far more potatoes than protein on the non-huevos meal. The price should be 2.50 less than the regular huevos or cut the potatoes in half. Just our opinion of course. We really like this place and hope to see them make a success of it!"}, {"review_id": "RbIOe5NqMOnLBKHV4KiJCA", "user_id": "nT4f845bYyHf4qbyIuAHLg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "I was really excited about taking some friends here and chose the place because it seemed to have good reviews.
