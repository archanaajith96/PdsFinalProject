I am in love with the vegan cheesesteak with the cheese sauce and the onions/peppers! The mac and cheese is also devine! It is soo hard to believe that it is vegan! What a treat! Don't get me started on the Kale salad with the Jerusalem dressing! And their lemonade is delicious! I love the ambiance as well, lots of history and good music to boot!"}, {"review_id": "--GU0M7Q5EMXDuq24hzI5w", "user_id": "AjQQXHX99d2MDJKY4XdtjQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Super disappointing we drove 45 mins to check out this restaurant while in town to support a black business and was super annoyed when we noticed how poorly we were treated. When we walked in we were greeted with a great cashier who nicely presented the meals. We sat outside and waited for our names to get called for our meal to pick it up but as we waited we noticed everyone else ( we were the only black couple there) was getting their food served to their table and we were told we had to walk in and pick up our own food. We also noticed a customer saying I was going to go in and waitresses saying no worries I got it.  They would walk by our table and not ask us if we needed additional napkins anything, but we noticed other race customers were asked these things by the waitresses . We were the only black couple there and it was a huge disappointment to experience this from our own people. We were so excited to support this business. We eventually pulled the manager aside and shared with him our experience he did share that the team had just changed their policy and was transitioning from delivering plates to tables, to requesting customers to pick up their plates when name called. He mentioned he noticed some of the hosts had not fully transitioned onto the new program yet. I understand his response but the place is not that huge and there was only two waitresses and it wasn't hard to see we were being treated differently. It's just sad we were the only ones the waitresses remembered to implement the the new policy on. It's been almost 6 months since our visit to this place and hope the experience is better."}, {"review_id": "DgMbS4gcPYAPEnWMBncjsw", "user_id": "FbNXujzkyC97Zp2vouY5Cw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "Wilmington, Delaware y'all--this place is in Wilmington! And it's better than any vegan sandwich we've had in Philly, maybe ever. We both ordered the classic v steak and added peppers. I loved the cheese sauce (slightly mustardy) but my wife would have preferred without. We didn't save enough room for the Mac n cheez but it looks good. There was hot sauce everywhere, the service was way above average, and the prices reasonable. From the Malcom X pic, to local artwork, the music, to the food, it's all dope. We got to sit at the table with a huge window overlooking to river. And the restaurant creates an atmosphere where it's okay to talk to your dining neighbors (not like a lot but our neighbors where just as excited about their food as we were). Warning: this is not fast food. We waited about 25 minutes for our food, but my wife has been before and warned me. In the meantime, listen to the music, feast on the art, and feel good that Wilmington is a place you call home."}, {"review_id": "3pb-oU-42hdRh8Zfsfktjg", "user_id": "UniMVIU5-JglqwXWVEkvcw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "My mom and I have been meeting here for lunch almost weekly, and I am not exaggerating when I say we look forward to this all week. We love everything about this place. The food is AMAZING- never have I been so excited about a salad as I get about the Marley. I don't even usually like kale, but man oh man, they work some magic on it! The love put into the food, the service and the ambience is just so evident. It's a dream-come-true for a vegetarian/vegan, but so delicious that anyone would enjoy it. I'd recommend more food items, but really, you can't go wrong! Do yourself a favor and support this business... but save us a table on Thursday afternoons :P"}, {"review_id": "NFqPSosV88ZbzAwIWC7Smw", "user_id": "uoXcz9ngb1HdP-kJW4bLnw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "First time visiting this place and I am SO happy with it. It's on the river front so I can't wait to go back when it's warmer and eat some food by the water. While I was waiting for my food to be done, I got the Oreo cupcake and it was fabulous! For lunch I got the V-Steak, macaroni and cheese, and the sautéed southern greens. Everything was so wonderful, and hands down the best vegan Mac and cheese I've had yet. The cheesesteak was so meaty and flavorful and the greens were perfection. I also got the rose quartz drink which I wish it had more of the floral syrup in it because I couldn't taste it much, but it was still so refreshing so I didn't mind! It's decorated with cool record covers and news articles and art, and I'm pretty sure it's a black female owned business so I will always 100% support that! I can't wait to come back!"}, {"review_id": "NbMcSD2VOzNNZln9-9sMLA", "user_id": "sFkRZeitqSGVkEl1EUUeDw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Went there for ice cream, terrible service.

I looked at the menu online to get an idea of exactly what I was getting myself into. I'm not extremely carnivorous, but the idea of NOT having meat as an option absolutely made me nervous. When we arrived I immediately noticed how small it was. I thought maybe it was a grab and go place, but everyone seemed to be very comfy. I appreciated the cultural references on the menu. That made me feel right at home...like among friends or family. I was hesitant to order, but my friend insisted on the V steak. You mean steak? That isn't steak? Absolutely not, I'll take a water. But after much prodding I jumped in and ordered. Food arrived rather quickly and I had a stare down with it for a few minutes because it LOOKED like meat. Smelled like meat. I took a bite and heard my ancestors singing. It was DELICIOUS. I ate the first half, completely forgetting this was a completely VEGAN CHEESESTEAK. My plan was to eat a few bites to be nice and throw it out when I got home. That sandwich didn't last 10 minutes. Everyone was very nice and the atmosphere was very laid back. Again, it IS small so if you're lucky to get a table, grab it and get comfy. I think it will be very nice in the summer because there's lots of seating outside. Definitely try it!"}, {"review_id": "kYUvjQo5yx1Da8ssb4CuTA", "user_id": "th_t7aq87x6UxjEQLbXeOQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Back in March 2017: went in because of good reviews.

Don't get me wrong, it's not dirty, it's quite clean but seating is limited so it seems more like a quirky deli.  Definitely not a place where you'd go for dinner date with friends, but I oh so wish it was!  The food is fresh and always tasty.  Amexum burger was my go to the number of times I've visited. Love the ice cream and candy selection, which definitely seems offbeat with many vegan establishments.  This place really takes vegan to an understandable level for us carnivores!  I didn't miss my poultry or beef, and after my first bite i was happy to have passed on those options too!"}, {"review_id": "q3Oa-AUH1JPB6YyvLASlWQ", "user_id": "THK3LFPPVNREV4Zra_HmXw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "9/26/2017", "text": "V-Steak ! Paper was saturated in grease, but the sand which  was very dry, from bread being over toasted . (See pics) Also the staff who prepared my food was not wearing gloves and was drinking and  soda and playing on her phone.When asked She assured that she just washed her hands! Also, I think it's unprofessional for staff to be fixing there hair where food is being prepared.Next thing was the Mac & Cheez, very dry and lacked the creamy consistency, ( it was like they didn't have anymore or was leftovers from the burnt edges of the pan) which it use to have. I don't know if they change the recipe but not a fan.

The mac and cheese is awesome, and I always get the Marley salad even when I say I'm going to try something different... it's just too good. My boyfriend has gotten most of the sandwiches and he's always really happy with them. I wanted to write this review mainly because I wanted to address a few common complaints I see here on Yelp. 1. \"It's too expensive and the portions are small\": If you want to get a lot of food for a little money, get yourself to Olive Garden or the dollar menu at McDonald's, but don't expect any the same level of nutrition or care from your cheap food. DSK embodies a better way of eating, modest portions of lovingly-prepared food. They make all of their ingredients themselves, and having made some from-scratch vegan ingredients myself, I know this takes so much work and time. Pay the money, leave a tip. It's earned. 2. \"The people are rude\": Whenever I go in, it's always so busy! People with this complaint have obviously never worked in a busy restaurant. I don't go to DSK for my feelings to be catered to like a baby. I'll go to my mom's house for that. I go for the kick ass vegan food. Thicken your skin and get over it."}, {"review_id": "1hfruBw70d1ft_pZiOftOQ", "user_id": "Dw9ZZgx_Eh067ESEInP55g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Burger was amazing!

A friend and I decided to meet for lunch last week to check out DSK for the first time. I didn't notice many signs to where the location of the restaurant was in relationship to the buildings. I knew where it was from walking the Riverfront many times and it says on their website or facebook maybe, they are located inside Molly's Ice Cream (the side closet to the river).I like how the place is decorated. I like the fabric hanging from the ceiling, the piano and the eclectic furniture style with cool things on the wall. Their music was good at first with some Lauryn Hill, then there was some white pop girl sounding stuff. I was talking with my friend the majority of the time so I didn't notice much else. I ordered their Hibiscus Red drink and their DSK Delux in a wrap. My friend got their lemonaid drink and V-ribs with a side of greens. My drink was really yummy. My wrap wasn't bad, but it did have a mild taste of...the oil they cooked in might not be the freshest or it was in the oil too long. The rest of the ingredients were fresh. The wrap was okay but I will order something else next time. I'm interested in trying more."}, {"review_id": "U8fcPZPJRcy-GVDTAKCZEA", "user_id": "93jl4pbbNCJFXFL6pyhmaQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2017", "text": "Cons: - There is no sign outside to direct you to where to go. If I didn't read yelp I wouldn't know they share a space with Molly's Ice cream- The young lady at the counter didn't know what was in the cupcakes when I had asked- They were out of the black bean burger, which we really wanted- Their inventory for desserts were scarce. -Portions are tiny. For 3 people, we got a cheeseburger, chili and lasagna with a side of sweet potato chips and coke but the portions are tiny so were not filling (the cheeseburger bun was 2x the volume of the burger patty itself) - For the portion size, it seems pricey. All the food above being $35. Pros:So I know with all the cons above I'm giving a generous star review but the food was actually flavorful. I wouldn't have known really the cheeseburger was vegan had I ordered it elsewhere. Also the chili was thick and not watery like typical vegetarian chili could be."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/drop-squad-kitchen-wilmington?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
