But the sandwiches are big and delicious. I had the Cubano. The bread was crusty just like it should be with plenty of meat , cheese and pickles. All you get is the sandwich, no chips. But , no worry, the sandwich is very filling! I had a tangy hibiscus tea with my sandwich. It's a bit pricey. My sandwich and drink were $14.50.You could probably make two meals out of that sandwich!"}, {"review_id": "TWrGOuKI_AMeWCD3J2jP3w", "user_id": "Exvm0RACaC-o_2YryOnR4w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Cute, tucked away place in Nob Hill, off the main drag. The sweet plantains are alone worth going for, but the arepas are tasty too. They offer three kinds of arepas, various sandwiches, signature drinks and a few desserts. The yucca fries were too dry and greasy, and overall the food was pretty carb heavy. They offer a green salad as a side, which would lighten the meal. The tostone was reminiscent of cardboard, but the salsa on top was refreshing. Overall, once in a while, this is a good change of pace if you're craving a \"meat and potatoes\" kind of meal."}, {"review_id": "B-DK9RtUWB8YO9TczBCN9g", "user_id": "9vyJ7z12GalZ9m9K8uWOyA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "So this is my first review in my new town. Found this spot on yet and it had good reviews so decided to give it a try. It is a home grown spot with a special feel to it. There is seating inside and out but you seat yourself and have to walk to the counter to place your order. Once you place your order you are given a number and they bring your food (ala Panera Bread)Placed order and it took roughly 20mins for food to get to the table. So I was a little disappointed until I tasted the food. Worth the wait. Best yucca I have ever had. Sauce that came with it was so-so. Sandwich was awesome. They also have a little self serve water station that they do an infusion with different fruits. Kinda cool. Anyway a solid place I give a 4. Didn't try their guava drinks which because it's in their name I assume is their specialty. Will have to try next time."}, {"review_id": "DklchU8pAYDaDD3ESu12Xg", "user_id": "YBKQVwIxkwmfmt6sKuF4RA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "This little hole in the wall is amazing! My husband gets lunch here quite often but I had to be convinced to come since the one time I came about 2 years ago I got something that I didn't like that much, so I avoided it after that. But my husband finally convinced me to try it again and I'm SO glad that I did. My husband got the Cubano and I got the arepas. Both were so delicious and moist and perfectly seasoned. We also ordered their version of a latte that was made with condensed milk and it was extremely sweet but tasty as well! It's a fairly small place on the inside where you order,  but off to the side there is a larger spot to eat and some outdoor seating as well. Definitely stop by and try it out!"}, {"review_id": "DClSMcBXz7T7jxcqfdDg_g", "user_id": "niqAJbfC4PRtAkQbDmzPwA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Nice people, nice staff, ordering system is bad. Took 40 min to get a sandwich. People in front of me finished they're meal as I took my first bite. Because a phone order was placed in between us. That took precedence over my order. Bull. I could see my sandwich sitting there for 20 min. The cashier/owner is also the waitress. Great sandwich. But you need at least a good runner. Cubans was fantastic. Cute place. Be sure to call ahead for your cubano order so you can eat upon arrival. Too bad, I wanted to like this place too. Maybe I'll feel better after I finish my cubano . #hangry"}, {"review_id": "tkrBpBOHac5i_9p7rRNbnQ", "user_id": "k9zGChi9A3dtpa_LSvwx1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Best Cubano I've ever had!

I had the Guava Pollito sandwich and it turned out great. The serving size was perfect, too. Be aware that these sandwiches don't come with fries or chips. I also had one of their pastries (not totally sure on the name) which was served warm to my table by the owner as I finished my sandwich. Service was lovely, atmosphere was very homey -- literally. I think this place was a house in a past life. All in all, I love it.

This place is authentic and delicious! The Cubano is prepared on French bread, perfectly toasted and flavorful. Ropa Vieja is tender and delicious. The platanos are fried just right and packed with flavor. The yucca fries are great and that little dipping sauce they give you is perfectly matched.The pastellito with cream cheese and guava is so flaky and full of flavor. It just melts in your mouth but has that slightly crunchy texture. So so good!The Tres Leches cake is decadent and rich. I think it's perfect. The cake is fluffy and very moist with a good helping of whipped cream on top. It's not a mush at all. It's just right.

We were excited to see this little restaurant doing so well in the Nob Hill location. It was pretty busy on a Saturday afternoon but the service was quick. I had a mouth watering turkey, avocado, provolone with chimichurri sauce. The bread is crunchy and the flavors packed a punch. For pure decadence we shared a Cafe con Leche, the Cubans like their coffee sweet and nothing does it like sweetened condensed milk and espresso. It was such a nice day we sat outside on their lovely porch.

I knew I was home. In a town with very expected cuisine south of the border, Guava Tee Cafe takes you further southeast to Caribbean tastes and memories. I am provoked by the rich cafecito I tried along with the Pernil sandwich with its roasted pork and caramelized onions. There isn't a flavor like it - we're hundreds of miles away from the closest thing. Some delicious yucca fries were a much necessary alternative from regular fries. Dare I say every bite was an experience on it's own. I've yet to try more, but I can easily say Guava Tree Cafe is a must."}, {"review_id": "L-9id5lz7kqx4D86iQmyIQ", "user_id": "TAR_xQEdVtMOaR2hRXSJgw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Love their Cubano Sandwiches with tostones, I always order this when I come here.

I was put at ease right away when I saw the owner smiling and taking orders from behind the counter; glad to see he's still running things.The coffee here is terrific, but the cubano sandwich is to die for. I've never had one prepared this well anywhere else. If you like sandwiches, give it a try. There are plenty of other wonderful options on the menu as well, ranging from budget college student fare to pricier delights.

The restaurant owners are from Colombia and Puerto Rico, and they brought an excitable menu with a listing of Central American and Cuban dishes to help Nob Hill residents to transcend cuisines and borders. Located in a classic, Pueblo-style home, the restaurant consists of a front patio, low ceilings, and all-around wooden décor. Upon entering, we waited in line to order our food in the tightly squeezed café area before finding a seat in the long dining room. The place was captivated by a row of paintings and TVs to accompany the touches of red, yellow, and green to harness the surrounding. At first impression, the Guava Tree symbolizes the fruit of labor with lived experiences shaped by the sweet and tartness of guava, and all of its markings and textures of intersectional identities, multiplicity, and global migration. The Pelotero ($12.75) came with Cuban ropa vieja, fried yucca, black beans, plantains, rice, avocado, salad, garlic chimichurri sauce, and a cup of iced coffee. The ropa vieja was moist, tender, flavorful and better than the one I had at Victor's 1959 Cafe. I also loved the thick cut fried yucca that was crispy fluffy tasty when dipped in the garlic chimichurri sauce. The black beans were equally flavorful and addictive, and the thick pieces of plantains were perfectly fried with crispy edges and soft natural sweet center. The avocado and salad were very fresh to brighten the flavors. Overall, the dish was fully loaded with great balance and depth between colors, freshness, and striking flavors from one item to the next. The iced coffee was surprisingly tasty, sweet, refreshing, and the perfect finisher. What a great place to grab lunch! For a fast food restaurant, service was surprisingly attentive and very kind. Interested diners can expect a causal fare with unusual range of flavors, textures, and taste. I would be very interested in returning to try their good-looking Cuban sandwiches, baked empanadas, arepas, and tres leches cake."}, {"review_id": "Mcxrz4CfmL_tIIW5TgjtPg", "user_id": "lSn7n2Qrq4uDADhMCM_b5Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/9/2017", "text": "I'm starting myself slowly in exploring the menu with the cubano and yucca fries.

The location is a little cramped and eccentric, which perhaps matches the food. Both are an interesting experience and worth it. The cuisine here is roughly central American, but there seems to be a fusion aspect to it. Basically what it comes down to are arepas and sandwiches, and man, they are very good. Some of the best I've had in Albuquerque - and it can be hard to impress with just a sandwich.What really makes it for me though is the yucca fries. I've never had yucca fries before but I'm hooked now they're fantastic and come as a small order with a great dipping sauce. They also offer a house coffee beverage which is made with condensed milk and is very sweet. Overall I recommend it, but I can easily see it getting too busy, and they were a little slow even when I was there and most tables were empty."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/guava-tree-cafe-albuquerque-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
