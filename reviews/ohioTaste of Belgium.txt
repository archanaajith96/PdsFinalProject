The menu was full of interesting choices, the bar menu was broad, and the pastries were surprisingly fun! We literally couldn't decide what to order...there wasn't a single dud. I opted for the goetta hash, which didn't disappoint. My wife had the Hot Ham and Cheese, something she would never order, which turned out to be from another world. The bloody Mary's and mimosas were so clever and tasty, we wanted to try them all!I'm confident this will be a regular breakfast/brunch spot on every trip to Cincinnati from now on."}, {"review_id": "A-zAJX6mXUCiBv7sMVzwFg", "user_id": "WuPybEM4dy2FEBCTzlufdw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "This place, I have frequented more than any other restaurant in Cincinnati. It is great. The fried chicken is tasty, burgers are fantastic, as is the beer selection. Now to commit sacrilege on yelp....the waffles are good, maybe great. They are not, however, Liegoise. They are very, very close. In Liege, they break apart with sweetness. They are dessert or an afternoon treat. These are more doughy and less intense. I know why the owner does this, as it would be a very heavy item to combo with anything else. A real liegoise waffle and fried chicken would be polarizing or too sweet as you would have to tailor the sauce to a honey moutard or something to bring you up to the sweetness of the waffle. Sorry if I offended. The place is great and the only knock is the waffle, which many swear by."}, {"review_id": "i_ROoOTXJ_Kq1iXrEkhQ6Q", "user_id": "V-kAFYHZKhs63AIUjGylNw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "We tried it out since it is a localish place and it fell between a three and a four, but since we can't give an in-between score, it must be a three. The service would receive a 4 for sure. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. We came here the day after The Homecoming in need for a really good substantial​ meal. We went to the one closet to the waterfront. Normally my hubby and I can eat two dishes and be full, but this meal did not do it for me. The crepe had way too many onions in it and not enough cheese or mushrooms, even though it was the mushroom crepe. The arugula​ on top​ was the perfect amount and made it appear very delicious. It looked better than it tasted. The waffle, on the other hand,​ was a 4 for sure. We should have asked for less whip cream as that was the only thing we did not lick off the plate. The one we had was the ricotta cream. As I cut off each piece of the waffle, ​I smeared it in the lemon curd and covered it in all the different black peppernuts​ and berries."}, {"review_id": "OzB5cDGo8nKwHMN1JmLycQ", "user_id": "WZDaA2HhRlBgh3D13ErKCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Love this place, the food, the service jus everything.I been to the one in Finley market and I finally made it to the one in OTR and both are just great. They have friendly staff that go above and beyond, this particular time the waitress helped us pick a beer and she was kind enough to show us some samples. We ended up getting the Qwak which was delicious! Furthermore, we had friends and waffles both super yummy and filling.  The friend seem to be freshly made and are super tasty, and the waffles are just to die for, they're rich in flavor and sweet. I haven't tried their coffee yet but I'll definitely be back. Overall is a great experience!"}, {"review_id": "VDWZOZmmMO0dyp1IuyBPfA", "user_id": "vsKhubNl39a69gNZJrFMrQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "So freaking good! My girlfriend and I stopped in today for a bite to eat, while taking a break on our photoshoot. We both had the Chicken and Waffles and OH MY GOODNESS. Heaven in your mouth! The waffles were the best i've ever had and the chicken was so juicy, well seasoned, and just melted in your mouth. The flavor profile was crazy good, especially for the price! It can't be beat. Theres a lot for parking close by and if it's not full you don't have to walk far at all, which is a perk for some.  They have tons of sweet treats and a slam packed menu for drinks.

We sat on the patio in the shade and both our hostess and waiter were very accommodating. I got the cookie butter waffle as well as a bacon-egg & cheese waffle (1 sweet and 1 savory because treat yo' self, right?!) The cookie butter one was to. die. for. The waffles may seem tiny at first, but don't fret! They're really thick and VERY filling. I encourage you to try every topping you possibly can. You won't regret it!

I am more of a basic pancake fan. However, I am always up for trying local business fare, especially if it involves food or drink. My husband and I were able to get a \"community\" table where the actual cooking took place. We didn't know the people we were at the table with, but we did know that we were in an \"exclusive\" seating. The restaurant was full, not packed or overflowing, but it was busy.

So I decided to dabble in the crêpe section and ordered a mushroom crêpe which has roasted wild mushrooms, carmelizes onions, Mozarella, Provolone, Boursin, argula, & added spinach. I was pleasantly impressed. It was exactly what I was looking for. The crêpe was made to perfection, with a delicate crisp. If you're looking to having something on the healthy side and lighter than their waffles I recommend you give this a try!"}, {"review_id": "zuH2gnrpBPMmkfcKNMw4Ww", "user_id": "XP5hqB6A9rvXlH_LHtzUgA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "We came here for breakfast and luckily were able to get seated right away. We rarely do this but me and my wife ordered the same waffle & chicken dish. It was a rather small waffle topped with Ohio maple syrup l, with a piece of fried chicken in some light spicy sauce. And a side of salad. The waffle itself was small, but it isn't your ordinary fluffy waffle. What it lacked in size, the density of this waffle made up for it. The maple syrup was very sweet and when you took a bite from the spicy chicken, you get a very delicious sweet & spicy bite. The chicken was perfectly fried, very tender and juicy. I will without a doubt definitely return here next time I'm in town. Their customer service was great, and their waffle & chicken dish is one of my favorite breakfast dishes ever. It's a must try you won't be disappointed!"}, {"review_id": "n4fEG5TGstzAoJPRTf-CTg", "user_id": "TysOqKDhdYBVnIebM8-i4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Incredible food and loved the atmosphere.

Finally decided to try out their dinner. I do not recommend their dinners because it is pricey for the quality. If you want to go for dinner, avoid some of the dishes I ordered. I think their steak frites are supposed to be good and I saw a lot of people ordering it. Below are the dishes we ordered and their reviews:Brussel sprouts ($8): this was pretty good. I'd recommend this dishAsparagus ($6): this is fine. It's a side dish and is just a simple thing of asparagusCarbonnades Poutine ($15): not worth it. Small portion size and didn't taste that great. The Loaded Potato Box in Smoke Justis (Covington, KY) is loaded with a lot more flavor, portion size is larger, and cheaperShrimp and Grits ($16): definitely do not recommend. Dish has potential but is doused with a generous serving of tomato sauce that tastes like the cheap stuff from a jar"}, {"review_id": "8-O8kD5GmIJTFYsI5kckVw", "user_id": "hxLZmJYnHVMLtukJJimfsA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "The chicken and waffles are amazing!!

Drawing inspiration from one of Belgiums greatest imports, the waffle takes center stage. The space itself is big, bright, and colorful; doubling up as a take out bakery for pastries and baked goods. Add on the open kitchen concept, Taste of Belgium is full of life. Chicken and waffles- when done right, one of my favorite dishes. I would consider this a 'healthier' version. Not only is the chicken baked rather than fried, the cut itself is the breast. The waffle is definitely more authentic than what is usually served with the southern version. Essentially this means a sweet cake like waffle rather than light and airy. Overall good, but I am personally a fan of the traditional. Mac and cheese- I'll keep this sweet and short: nice touch with the bread crumbs but some additional seasoning(salt) would have done this dish wonders. Fries- another wonderful item we can thank Belgium for, our beloved French fries(no they didn't come from France!). Would love to say I was blown away, but the fries themselves arrived lukewarm. Italian crepe- another authentic touch opting to go with the Bretagne version of the crepe, but unfortunately the execution was lacking. The crepe itself was dried out, almost resembling a chip. With that being said, all the right flavors are certainly present. Although some technical flaws are evident, Taste of Belgium is a fun atmosphere and has made some nice touches to try and bring Belgian authenticity to Cinci."}, {"review_id": "zPH_HDnTKWJFO04ZiKWwnQ", "user_id": "QnGekEZI3LjbNZGB8HISzw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "My wife got a Ricotta Cream Waffle and I got a Mcwaffle with a side of Frites.

They are known for their Chicken & Waffle and I have finally got to try them. My husband raves about this place as he loves Chicken & Waffle, and usually always orders it on any brunch menu. He was craving Chicken & Waffle so that is how we ended up here. Me on the other hand, I'm not big on Chicken and Waffle. I like them but I'm not crazy about it like my husband is. The establishment is always busy but clean, and the staff is friendly and helpful. We had a short wait but we were able to get seated quickly. We both ordered the Chicken and Waffle. We also ordered a side of scrambled eggs and sausage for our daughter. Needless to say he loves their Chicken & Waffle. In my opinion their Chicken & Waffle was good, but it didn't give me the wow factor. It wasn't bad by any means but like I said I wasn't crazy about it. The chicken was seasoned and cooked well. The hot sauce they put on top gives it a kick that is nice. The Waffle is super sweet. Definitely sweeter than I am use too. In my opinion it is a little too sweet for my liking. However, the Chicken and Waffle blended well together and tasted good. It was also served with a side salad with a lemon vinaigrette dressing. It was a basic salad with light dressing. It was good but nothing special. I didn't taste my daughters eggs but they didn't look like anything special. Now the sausage was amazing!! It was flavorful and cooked well, and not burnt. Almost every restaurant burns their sausage and I don't like that. They did a good job of cooking it. It was very good with a little syrup on top in which that's how it was served. Very very good sausage!! Overall, TOB wasn't bad but it didn't do anything for me. It was like oh ok it's another restaurant. It wasn't bad by any means but probably because I'm not crazy about Chicken & Waffle is probably why I'm like blah. Besides the waffle being super sweet it was an overall good dish."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/taste-of-belgium-cincinnati-10?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
