Chose this place for a quick bite to eat for breakfast. It's a like you walked into a cozy little cottage with posters hung everywhere (even the ceiling!) and an impressive collection of mugs hanging all around the edge of the wall.At 10am, I was one of the few to be there so I chose where to sit and I was offered hot tea. I got the veggie delight omelette and added ham - it came with hash brown and 2 pancakes! Having pancakes as a free side is really rare so I appreciated it!The food came out quickly. The omelette was really tasty, fluffy eggs and ample vegetables. I enjoyed it a lot as well as the pancakes. Although I couldn't finish all of it, I sure enjoyed the bites I took. Perfectly golden and crispy. I noticed some portraits and photos of Granny B. The waitress knew almost everyone who was dining in, so it gave a warm little hometown diner feel."}, {"review_id": "Bx4ihg_m_KkZ6qkZZintjA", "user_id": "30OLgVepnnZsL-UgUhegpQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Having gone to most our usual breakfast places, I opened the Yelp app to find a new spot.

When we first pulled up, I was a little worried. The outside is run down and looks dirty. However, when you go inside, you are greeted by the friendliest of staff and the most random decor ever. We had to wait a while on our food, because, according to the staff, the cook had quit and the owner was doing all of the cooking. When we got our food it was just right. There wasn't a single item on our plates that we thought wasn't cooked right or needed more. We would definitely go here again.

They have different specials listed in the front, I had the Cajun Country fried steak with hash browns, scrambled eggs (my preference), and side of buttermilk pancakes that comes with it. Big hearty breakfast and very satisfied. Food is freshly made and homemade. I respect and love these kind of restaurants that give a home feel. And the owner, the older man is so sweet and genuine. He wasn't our server but our Hostess & Busser. I never gotten to really talk to him but I wanna wish him a Happy Father's Day! Respect to him for working on Father's Day. Again, although I didn't really talk to him- I could tell he works really hard and has a gentle sweet heart. Sweet people representing a business ALWAYS make the food taste much better! Would recommend this place and return again! Thank you Granny B's Cafe!"}, {"review_id": "ASEMw4Y4-3DoNnAjN0x2eg", "user_id": "a0pktY4Rf5TYD35wsC8V2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Found this on Yelp, looking for some place away from downtown, and VERY GLAD I DID.

Don't be deterred by the cash only sign out front it's worth the effort to go. I went for brunch and it was delicious and looking from all of the tables that were full on a Saturday, this is a popular spot. It is full of Iditarod and Alaska memorabilia (think arctic roadrunner).The food is wholesome, quick and tasty. I had the Mexican Chili omelet and pancakes. It came with a full order of hash browns and that hit the spot!

I'm their mailmam . I very seldom have time to eat but after seeing someone who I know has excellent taste there several times in a row I decided I had to find time . I ordered breakfast to go . Scrambled eggs , blueberry pancakes and home fries . It was the best . I can't find home fries like this anywhere ( I can't make them this good ) . Each little potato square is browned to perfection and there is absolutely no grease ! The scrambled eggs were also cooked to perfection and the blueberry pancakes were heavenly . ( I'm not exaggerating) Granny B's does things their own way , like cash only and closing at 3:00 in the middle of the afternoon , but I have to give it 5 stars for its delicious food and friendly and skilled staff ."}, {"review_id": "wmO0aEnKJvIlwZL0YFlabg", "user_id": "QIXXYrni3GMNIXhw8P4opQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "BEST BREAKFAST IN ANCHORAGE!!

The place is a little small, so I wouldn't recommend any big groups or parties (groups of 4 are accommodated pretty well, but any bigger you might have problem) This  is definitely one of the better breakfast restaurants I've been to in Anchorage. Service:The service here is always friendly, attentive, and quick. I honestly love all the coffee mugs. it makes me feel like home. Food:Their biscuit and gravy are the best thing here! But then again, every time I come here I'm so drawn to their biscuit and gravy I don't really try anything else. My boyfriend likes their country fried steak dish and I have to agree that it's pretty tasty. The gravy is the real star of that dish though. The country fried steak is pretty standard.
