The breakfast was reasonably priced and great for the cost!!!! My son decided to have lunch for breakfast and they happily accommodated. He was impressed starting from the soup to the very end of his philly! I highly recommend the Double Yolk if you like a good friendly family restaurant!! I will be back again!"}, {"review_id": "A2OA7cXhH3aewzpDLMZi1Q", "user_id": "_cTyg7dbY_sDtQYMm_SPHw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/23/2017", "text": "It's five stars on value alone. Two of us stuffed to the gills for $20 + tip. Add good food, huge menu, friendly staff, and proximity to outlet mall - ring the bell, we have a winner!! We ordered two different omelettes, they were big 'uns. Fresh ingredients and cooked just right. So big in fact, we probably could have split one just fine given the side items. Omelette comes with hash browns or American potatoes, filling but just okay. The best side item were the pancakes. Biscuit and gravy was average: peppery gravy kinda lukewarm with biscuit of the store bought variety. Anyway, I digress. Five stars on eggcelent omelettes and good service at good value."}, {"review_id": "NuuRjokw9HjMdS1adVD0HA", "user_id": "443rdonZVp24hyaVScBhSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Great people! Awesome waitress and manager. I ordered the Steak and egg. Steak was a little over cooked for my taste. When I mentioned it they fixed it right away without complain. Received the second piece of steak within minutes and to my liking.  I'm was extremely happy with the taste, flavors  and the tenderness of my steak. I recommend this place to anyone who enjoys having happy and positive energy people around you while you enjoy your food."}, {"review_id": "fVGiQLgoW2gk02KkmoSgkA", "user_id": "Tg5cWW0Wrv8zugwIF5IMuw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "This is probably my favorite breakfast restaurant of all time! The service was great, the food was fantastic, the mocha was amazing! The southwest Benedict, the pancakes, the panini's and the French fries were too die for! The southwest Benedict was out of this world! If you are looking for a great breakfast/lunch spot, you won't be disappointed! It's a must try!!"}, {"review_id": "SHz5guMruEPHxBENxqg1CQ", "user_id": "HzcqOHVzHjb1ijr3KSYR2Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/13/2017", "text": "Greek diner feel. I've been here a several times already and the service here is good they're friendly and nice. The food is pretty good and according to they're name 1 egg comes with 2 yolks sorta of say \"if you order 2 eggs you get 4\". For some reason parking here gets packed for breakfast and kinda sucks because there's not enough parking. They is additional parking in the back too though. We had the gyro omelet with potatoes (yummy but lacked on presentation) and 2 eggs sausage links (big portions) with biscuits and gravy (not that good)."}, {"review_id": "BqfA_1D04aV1kqVJlHZpww", "user_id": "IE4xKfypWuM3eaaq5q9IxA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/11/2017", "text": "Nice place.  Run of the mill breakfast spot.  Nothing really special about it.The food is good, but definitely not in the top of the other breakfast places I have been to."}, {"review_id": "eX1-nYL9kRR8IchWcWy8Ug", "user_id": "B0oEGVpwihXFJOB-QVuVYA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Very poor service with Patty.

We were on the road and chose Double Yolk because time was an issue and it was the closest Siri pick. Yes, double yolk means each egg has two yolks. So the owner came by our table and warned me that I didn't really want three eggs with my corned beef hash. But this review is really about the hash. I love corned beef hash and when I find it on a menu I order it and cross my fingers. So often, restaurants just phone it in. But not here. This was without doubt the finest I have ever eaten. Lean, minced corned beef grilled to perfection with the perfect balance of minced potatoes and onions. Crisp but tender and not dry. This place is an hour's drive, but it will be a destination restaurant for us."}, {"review_id": "dOMviSIOUjZZ8WZ3tyNCrA", "user_id": "gXL-dRG8Ci0J0hn2hfKjzQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "My fiancé and I have been trying new breakfast places every month. (Not new to the area but new to us) we looked online and found Double Yolk two weekends and are very satisfied. The restaurant is big, clean, and has a good atmosphere. We loved the meat lovers, and Trucker skillet. They have great portion sizes and friendly staff. Tonni our waitress was fantastic! She was very fast, friendly, and helpful."}, {"review_id": "hJIvpnK4uuo4akuk0RiA1w", "user_id": "C0v-m442WFyOW9iJnPuJsw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/18/2016", "text": "Went here with my wife and son on a Sunday morning. We got lucky and beat the church crowd by 20 minutes. Food is exactly what you are looking for in a local breakfast place. If you're not starving but want a snack to go alongside a coffee, try the sweet roll. It came sliced and pan toasted.

I did not get my soup, when I told the waitress as she was bringing us our food she said she normally brings it with the meal, this is just after she delivered soup to someone sitting a the next table right after he ordered. My wife ordered an omelette with cheese, of course, there was no cheese and the waitress NEVER came back to check on us. My ice tea was never refilled. I think she was mad at me because I told her that I did not get my soup. The fact that she forgot the soup is not the problem, it was her attitude that 1) she did not make a mistake and 2) She totally and on purpose avoided our table until she brought the check. There are so many good breakfast/lunch places that you can go to, I will drive past this one from now on."}, {"review_id": "e0GkEoI3l9-7JLAvm5Wy4w", "user_id": "f8Y4kgQauwv4NhUa0rdvog", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/18/2016", "text": "First time here at Double Yolk. For a Saturday morning it was busy but I was seated right away. Parking was easy. The place is alot bigger than it looks. Very clean and friendly staff. They put alot of effort to making it look very nice. Even the details in the ceiling are pretty cool. I was seated in the back by the Bakery counter.  I had the Huevos Ranchero. It's was okay not really authentic but everyone has there own style in cooking. It filled me up and I enjoyed it. The waitress was very polite and always had a smile :) . I saw large groups and they seemed to handle it pretty good.  I based my 4 stars on parking, wait time, speed of serving, how food was cooked, and cleanliness. I did not really count the taste of food. I would like to try some other meals first. I will return again, but next time I'll try the Country Steak with gravy."}, {"review_id": "7YFiK9B7j7WTghbgdvDWRw", "user_id": "jJ9qtl9E5GNZYmXQsDNOTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "if you want to have a good breakfast then try this please and you will not disappointed."}, {"review_id": "NA8IKR5DTmwjyzzn32Sssg", "user_id": "VlyHGaMz3gbbQz5hytCeGA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/28/2015", "text": "Los Angeles breakfast joints need to visit the Midwest to learn how it should be done!-Plenty of parking-seated quickly-coffee & hazelnut cappuccinos-biscuits & gravy-corn beef hash and it's Real (not from can)-eggs cooked just right-bacon crispy (perfect)-toast just right-seems great for kids-priced right-friendly & efficient service (5 stars!)Any dislikes?-A bit too much onions in my corn beef hashThat's my ONLY complaint and that's just a personal preference.This place borders on 5 stars."}, {"review_id": "VVKJvqVIzYu9kStqEAR8VQ", "user_id": "khdjh0XI2zGOCJs3Ot-dRw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/7/2017", "text": "This is one of my favorite breakfast places.
