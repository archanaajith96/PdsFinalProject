We ended up going on a Saturday & were surprised to find out bowls were buy one get one half off on Saturday so it's definitely the day to try them out. We both had the make your own bowl $ both enjoyed our choices. The food was fresh & very yummy. I had 1/2 noodles & 1/jasmine rice with chicken & yellow curry sauce. They piled on delicious grilled squash & broccoli. When ordering they allow you to sample sauces & if you are new to real Asian food I highly suggest you sample which sauce you want. Because they certainly are not Panda Express. Also they give you a ton of meat so unless you are a big carnivore you might want to order 1/2 the regular meat amount."}, {"review_id": "e2Rvy5F49_ozIyD3938tog", "user_id": "ObZnTiwMA-4gaTqa1_mB6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/10/2017", "text": "Restaurant is clean and inviting.Service is fast and helpful.Food is fast and clean.

I went here for the first time today I was blown away by the flavor profile of my food, the portion size, the number of options, and it's healthy fast Asian fusion food. I guess they posted something social media about needing more customers to stay open not sure how people don't frequent this business it's so tasty. I got the drunken rice (spicy) with chili spiced beef and corn/grated coconut. It was the perfect blend of Asian flavor and heat. I loved the vegetables the corn was a fun interesting tasty option. I am not a veggie person so when I say I liked the veggies that's saying something!! The drunken rice was some of the best fried rice I have had in a while. So do whatever you have to get here support this local business and enjoy some unique healthy flavorful Asian food!!"}, {"review_id": "GF0tkBfNgYA7mRYJwLzilg", "user_id": "NYFKMaAH51xImopaZkqmHg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "We had a company event in Nampa on Saturday and decided to try Monsoon for the first time.

Perfect place to have a quick lunch. They recently just opened.Staff is really friendly , and waited on me while I picked on what I wanted.

I was super amped up to try it out as I've been following their spectacular social media content for a month or so now, and tend to love fusion food! The layout of the restaurant is a bit unusual, with a huge open space between two seating areas. I love the logo and signage both outside and inside, and the tables are beautiful heavy hardwood. The place was completely empty on a Friday night which we found odd and disappointing. We were warmly greeted by several workers who were behind the serving area. As others have mentioned, the set up is similar to a Chipotle where you order from a counter where you select what will make up your bowl. As a one time soecial, they also offered a Monsoon burger. The starch/base options were brown rice, white rice with spices and yaki sobi noodles. We had never had these kind of noodles so we both chose that for our base. Then I had chicken, half portion of the sour tamarind curry and half of peanut lime sauce, half portion mushrooms and half corn and coconut mixture and then chose the greens garnish that I can't remember. Hubby chose Vietnamese pork, yellow and red curry, can't remember what veggies and the cucumber relish. I think the highlights of the elements for me at least were the Vietnamese pork and the peanut sauce. We didn't love the noodle texture and felt like the bowl needed more fresh elements like fresh sprouts or basil perhaps? Hubby didn't care for the cucumber relish flavor. After eating, I decided to order a Boba tea and ended up choosing Brown Sugar flavor. It was epic. Truly delicious.Customer service wise, there was a teenaged boy and a dark-haired woman who guided us expertly through our options and were very warm. However, a teenaged girl who also served us was very off putting with careless body language and shocked us by popping her bubble gum while serving another customer!! Her manner of serving up the Boba tea was also unceremonious, just reaching into a giant fridge and filling the cup from there.Will we be back? I'm not sure. We weren't wowed, but we also want to support this new business! I am unsure."}, {"review_id": "Rs687AlmIXsxXGsCuHNMUQ", "user_id": "_n4zVhN7KIgnlhi45y2gJQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Love this place wonderful food, the teenage boy that helped me was very friendly and efficient!  He let me try the sauces and made sure I got what I wanted.

The diner is able to design their own bowl of food and the options are delectable!They graciously accommodated my low-carb lifestyle by swapping out the rice and noodles with a layer of delicious veggies.

The food was delicious and fresh. I gave it 4 stars just because the is some room for improvement. When we entered the was only one other couple there eating. The employee explained the process and explained the options. When it came down to ordering I noticed the need to mamer a lot of the items needed for our meal. No biggie, however some of those items were sitting on the counter (not sure for how long). Another employee came out to help as several other people came in. They were both trying to the same jobs and it slowed the process down and want as efficient as it could be. Overall it was a good meal. Since you can see the prep space,  it would be nice, just my personal preference, to see it a little cleaner or more organized. We also ordered a drink, but their options were fairly limited due to being out of stock of most options. Fairly reasonable prices and a nice atmosphere."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/monsoon-asian-grill-nampa?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
