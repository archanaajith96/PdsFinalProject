It is something that happens instantaneously. It courses through you like the water of a river after the storm, filling you and entering you all at once. You fell it throughout the body, in your hands, in your heart, in your stomach, in your skin...\"Look, I know Klaus was talking about Victoria, but he honestly could have been talking about my relationship with Kruegger's. Pros:- The restaurant is gorgeous, and the patio on the second floor is a quiet oasis away from the hustle and bustle on Vine St.- The beer cheese and tomato jar are excellent appetizers. This is coming from a gal who doesn't even like beer cheese or tomatoes.- Their sausages are made in-house, and are quite tasty. The Italian is spiced well and very flavorful, and it pairs well with the polenta cake.- Being known for their burgers, they have a creative selection to choose from. I personally like the spicy burger the most. (Momma likes her hot sauce!)Cons:- The cocktail list is short and underwhelming. One time they were even unable to make a John Daly because they were out of lemonade. It doesn't matter though; when I came back to try it, I found a poor alcohol rendition of golfers' favorite cocktail.- They take items off the menu, not because they're out of season, but just because they feel like it. It was really a bummer when the gruyere dip and eggplant parm sandwich left the menu. I know a lot of people who were saddened to see the parm leave! - This menu does NOT travel well. I would certainly not recommend getting this delivered or taking out. The burger dries out easily and the fries are super soggy. As a Thunderdome brainchild, Kruegger's offers the type of service and food one would expect from this wildly successful restaurant group; even with all those positives, I still feel as though I don't have Lebenslanger Schicksalsschatz with Kruegger's."}, {"review_id": "5nZQ8cMhBzzZdGhDB2PSnQ", "user_id": "ewnhM7TdPzaAZwVpaEh4fw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "One of my hidden gem favs. 5they stick to what they know, and with the right food, service, and music, they do a good job!

You can tell that it's made fresh and even the burger patty itself is beautiful (it's purple from beets, I assume).

We got the Krueger's burger and the bacon burger and they both blew me away. This is probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. I ordered my burger medium well and it was not dry at all. It was juicy and flavorful and the fries were the icing on the cake. I'm not a huge fan of mayonnaise based sauces, but the \"special sauce\" on my burger was surprisingly amazing.

I thought the place was really great. I liked the vibe and the service was really good. I decided to get the lamb burger and my fiancé got the Krueger Burger. I thought mine was really good with a lot of good flavors and the burger was very juicy. I tried Nick's burger and thought it was delicious also. We order a serving of sauerkraut balls and they were amazing! We each got a burger and had the sauerkraut balls as the side and that was definitely enough food for the both of us. I order the Lambrusco Sour and it was good even though it was pretty sweet and I don't like sweet drinks. Nick got the whisky punch (not sure if that's what its really called. I cant find it on the menu online) and he loved it. The waiter raved about it and he was telling the truth with how good it was. I will definitely go back whenever I can.

Great appetizers, good burgers, good sides. The beer list is a tad small for being in the middle of so many great beer options. My wife and I have been on a few dates here. We love trying to snag a space upstairs on the outdoor patio. It's a really great view to watch OTR pass by. I've had a burger each time and loved them. They come out juicy, tons of topping options. It's a mouthwatering burger.Unfortunately, tough, they are the new type of place that loves their house cause so much you can't get anything else with your food. All that to be said, it's a great place. Service has always been good and I've rarely had to wait forever. It also feels like a good deal, nothing too expensive. Reason for the 4 - low beer selection compared to it's neighbors, and the 'our sauce or nothing' policy."}, {"review_id": "sUOuMYilYwLgw4gw5eno0w", "user_id": "YrCBm7Kmph3agXimfjnGyg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/16/2017", "text": "Pretty average food to be honest.
