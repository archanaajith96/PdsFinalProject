Liked the sound of good pizza in a quaint cottage from the reviews. Lola's is a little off the highway, and you feel like the GPS is taking you someplace wrong. But trust it. Up the hill into a cute wooded neighborhood is this hipster pizza cottage with a locals' feel. The pizza is good even though they did mess up two of the three made-to-order pizzas we had. The other two we ordered were from their specialty list. Probably stick with those if you don't want to risk them messing anything up. Not the most amazing pizza in the world, but very good. Definitely worth the stop, if for no other reason than to take a break from the highway and enter into an area of Charlston you might not otherwise see."}, {"review_id": "qkMzUCgcPvaBx_A-CK5SWQ", "user_id": "FvXY-tzPWmn2XB-ZIs3Vuw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Very pleasantly surprised with the quality of these pizzas!My friends and I tried out 3 different pizzas - fig & rosemary, sausage & onion, and spinach & feta. If you get a large pizza size, then you can split it to have 2 different specialty pizzas.My favorite was the fig & rosemary. I was not expecting this combination to work so perfectly. The fig and the rosemary complement the other without being too herby or sweet. I've never had this topping combo before, and I don't plan for it to be my last time! My 2nd favorite was sausage & onion. It's not like the sausage and onion you get from deliveries. Delicious! The 3 of us were happy and full with 2 large pizzas.All the pizzas taste authentic and makes you feel like so much thought and care were put in. The workers (and owner?) makes an effort to greet you and get to know so many of the customers. Can't wait to revisit!"}, {"review_id": "o4Cdqvo-bDDuAfcX3ub8Kw", "user_id": "p7Zp54sz-ErtTD9s7MBeOQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/14/2017", "text": "A quaint little pizza joint that serves a variety of pizza and salads in a comfortable cottage setting! Driving up the mountain from downtown Charleston, in a residential neighborhood among the greenery lies Lola's. The parking lot is really small and accommodates only 3-5 cars,  and walking up to Lola's there is a small patio with hipster lights and a dining area inside.I ordered lunch here with a friend: we shared a beet salad and a spinach pizza. The salad had walnuts, beets, and a very delicious vinaigrette. The vinaigrette was some of the best I've tasted, and my friend dipped her crust in the vinaigrette which served as the perfect complement to the pizza. I'm not a huge fan of feta but the pizza was still pretty good, not too heavy. If you're looking to dine on a nice patio and split a pizza and salad, Lola's in Charleston is a great environment to have a satisfying lunch!"}, {"review_id": "-FXKwqru_1bddbZH8qItfQ", "user_id": "i9s5kUIMCjwj3Pl9aoFFaw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/9/2017", "text": "Happy to find this little gem near the Bridge Road shops as we had difficulty finding independent restaurants on prior visits to Charleston.Sangria comes in red & white. I chose the red & was quite pleased with the robust, fruity flavor. We had the goat cheese salad & fried fresh mozzarella. Both were delicious with warm centers. The Panko coating on the mozzarella was light & complemented the mild cheese. Finished the meal with the steak & cheese pizza.

We were asking about the Charleston area and they were happy to tell us about it.I ordered the goat cheese salad, and Paul and I split the ham & pineapple pizza. The salad was amazing. The folks at Lola's know how to make a balsamic vinaigrette, and the fried goat cheese--wow!I loved the addition of Gorgonzola on the pizza, but I wish there had been more of it. Fresh pineapple, rather than canned, would elevate that pizza. The crust was very good (almost as good as Dewey's in Cincinnati).The skylight, the splashes of bright colors, and the fun contemporary local art definitely add to the appeal.  Seating could be improved by getting rid of the uncomfortable metal chairs and replacing them with something else.3.5 stars rounded up to 4 thanks to friendly staff and great salad."}, {"review_id": "eW_FlJ9fXm4uy0c4IJEIWQ", "user_id": "60ePue4vgFCvJTdoQ_WeJw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/20/2017", "text": "One of the best pizza places in Charleston!

The restaurant wasn't crowded but parking capacity was limited as we had to park up the street and walk down, which I didn't mind since it was a nice night out.  Approaching the restaurant, I felt we were walking towards a little gift shop, it's small but cozy on the inside with an intimate atmosphere with outdoor seating available as well.  We started with the Pan-seared Mozzarella accompanied with glasses of wine as we waited on our pizza which made a perfect start.  I'm not a big wine drinker, but when I do it's usually Moscato, which they didn't have.   I had the Kiona Riesling, which had just the right amount of sweetness and thought it enjoyable, and also a San Pellegrino Aranciata Orange, a non-alcoholic drink our waiter had me try, and I really enjoyed - a classy bubbly orange drink :)The main course was a large pizza split half Spinach & Feta, half Spicy Shrimp & Sausage - their two top specialty pizzas, and both were good but Spinach Feta was best.  The pizza crusts were thin, almost like thin crust pizza, but with actual crusts on the edges.  Next time, I'd like to try a different specialty in place of the spicy shrimp pizza.  As for dessert, I finished up with Pistachio ice cream, while the boyfriend put away a Creme Brulee.  I've never been a fan of Creme Brulee but they make the best I've ever seen/tasted and the bf couldn't stop raving.**FYI**Currently, they DO NOT serve lunch, but our server says they will be opening during lunch hours soon."}, {"review_id": "Ms7a5uF2Ahy9wvB-IIaQQQ", "user_id": "jQAhkmqzQZ8diyKZHJh-_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2017", "text": "This not so hidden gem is yeast at 1st site, great food, service and homely atmosphere.
