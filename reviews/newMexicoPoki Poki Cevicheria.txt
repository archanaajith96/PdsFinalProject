It was less than four miles away and had so many good reviews that I had to visit.I ordered a small Poke Bowl with Salmon instead of Tuna, and added Teriyaki sauce. Outside of the grocery stores, hole in the wall joints, and higher end restaurants in Hawaii, this was the best poke I have tasted. And I was hungry. The salmon and vegetables were fresh, the sauces were spicy, sweet, and flavorful. My only issue was inconsistency with the rice from the cooker that ranged from melt-in-your-mouth to chewy to crunchy all in my one little bowl.Since is was $2 Taco Tuesday, I also order a fish taco that was kickin'!Whenever I land at ABQ, I will visit Poki Poki Cevicheria (pokipokinm.com). A excellent spot that I recommend highly."}, {"review_id": "-ER7rTP-N42US1_GnL5YOQ", "user_id": "9v183_UbvxeWvJsl-ovZBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "I love me some Poki Poki. I was hesitant at first to try this place.. I was not sure of the idea of all my favorite sushi ingredients in a bowl rather than in a roll! Although, I am glad I tried it because it is thee bomb. I should probably try something new eventually, but I always get the classic  Poki bowl minus the seaweed salad. Don't know why, but not a fan of the seaweed salad but don't mind the seaweed chip/strips that they garnish on top. I just substitute that for more plantain chips; who doesn't like more crunchy deliciousness in their bowl! Tip: In the winter, some locations offer free miso with a purchase of a bowl, so don't forget to ask for your miso!I have been to the location down close to UNM and on Wyoming and Comanche. Both are neat! There is more seating room at the Comanche location, and they have a bar! With some pretty good sangria options! Note: The Comanche location is known for the carnitas taco Tuesday special (the same carnitas tacos from Pasion Latin Fusion!) (If y'all don't know, I was obsessed with those tacos, buuut Pasion closed... sadly)"}, {"review_id": "UKpTnsbacy1XfMUaBmUsbw", "user_id": "bYL9p0AbG-SRzx9VNjaOgQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "I love Poki Poki. It's walkable from my office (and now that ART construction has slowed in the area I might actually do that.) It's like Subway but with delicious rice bowls instead of crappy sandwiches, in that you start at the beginning by choosing your base (rice/chips/salad) and then a kindly employee fills your bowl with whatever delicious fish, veggies and extras you request. Fish is great (huge compliment in the middle of a desert) and the toppings are always fresh. They have labeled their menu with gluten free information so it's easy to safely create your meal, including the sauces. They also have pineapple and/or tofu for the vegetarians out there.They have boba and some fun flavors of tea for your drinking enjoyment. They are on Grub Hub, so you don't even have to mess with parking near Central! No excuses, get a poke bowl."}, {"review_id": "eOegh8kgNYB2NfJlkVkThg", "user_id": "dlp-HY0R6WqcBGH64aMF_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "I absolutely love this place!

As topping I highly recommend: avocado, kimchi, green chile, seaweed salad, crab salad, and especially the masago (fish eggs).  Max out on these toppings, if they let you get 2 scoops then get 2, especially the masago and crab salad.  Please see my delicious pictures.  Will be returning here again and again."}, {"review_id": "vNbY0Sjc74u4MuFmcMsllQ", "user_id": "nKcM1Qoi3eqhO6WSgCu3QA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Poki poki just didn't do it for me.

Creating and eating the dish was enjoyable on both ends. While Poki isn't a place I'm racing back to, I'd also be more than happy to go try another combination.The team there were more than happy to help and explain how things work. Poki offers a selection of pre-designed bowls or you can go to the other menu and build your own custom creation. The latter is what I chose because I'm a foodie rebel, surely without a cause.I picked the large bowl (the middle of the three options) and went with the rice and spicy tuna as the starting point. Then insanity ensued with more ingredients than I could remember without missing at least one. They'll add two types of sauces and your selection from both the deluxe and basic toppings.They didn't skimp on anything, including the avocado. They also keep a fair number of the additions to their own place in the bowl. That separation allows you to mix up the flavors to your liking while you're digging in."}, {"review_id": "lACy_PKn9aPy33Z5jR1XrQ", "user_id": "mQfcBVCGrCoLEhaS3d-yhw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "The special spicy bowl was amazing!

After trying out all the Poki creations on the back of the menu and have to admit Albuquerque is getting a bit better at variety of unique choices! And there is another poki place near Academy neighborhood which is next on the list! Due to past experiences I did get food poisoning from a \"seafood\" restaurant serving ahi tuna in Albuquerque and never went back. Next thing you know Asian Latin fusion Poki Poki shows up one day with these cute various bowls with chips, edamame, seaweed plantain, crab salad, pickled cabbage, yam chips, and etc amount of toppings which makes it kind of hard what goes well with this vegetable. On the back of the menu Poki has a set of unique bowl names and highly recommend the Boss bowl!  If you can't make up your mind, go with the flow, and create your own bowl depending what your taste buds desire. Spicy, sweet, and everything nice! To add another is the drinks they have is the Japanese drinks and boba tea which is half and half. Oh and can't forget the variety of pocky on the wall which is strange and cool at the same time! If you're still skeptical they are licensed to serve raw food in a safety environment to avoid contamination. As weird as it sounds the way the bowls are made you won't think about eating raw food since it's covered up with all the delicious goodies and sauces! :)"}, {"review_id": "_O_X2RIBIqNrugEIE2vONQ", "user_id": "RbMym8Q8VmnXSFckLCZFGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "This was absolutely delicious.
