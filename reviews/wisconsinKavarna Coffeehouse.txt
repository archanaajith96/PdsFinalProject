Their food is incredible, and goes beyond the expected humdrum local fare. The atmosphere is funky and fun, and there's plenty of space... you're never left searching for a place to sit. If I can make one recommendation: be sure to order the rosewater lemonade.

The menu has a lot of options for vegetarians and vegans. I can always ask what is the staffs favorite and they have great suggestions. The staff are nice and inviting right when you walk in. There are great pastry selections as well which are super delicious. The food if brought out to your table in a timely manner. The coffee shop is bigger then most with a lot of seating throughout. I enjoy sitting for awhile and the atmosphere is very quaint. It's right downtown close to title town and a great walk to some unique shops around it. Great coffee and space, I enjoy it every time I go."}, {"review_id": "VKw69FtWVkG7jd7-IO1F4g", "user_id": "704FCmH3QryfTyBqZkofQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "I have been a loyal Kavarna customer since it's birth in 1999. When I was in high school, Kavarna was the hangout joint---the place we spent all our babysitting money before we had real adult obligations. Today, Kavarna remains the hub of downtown Green Bay. Whether you are meeting for work or want to have a relaxing pot of tea, this is your spot. Since I have been coming in since 1999, I've already had my lifetime share of espresso shakes there-- if you are ever looking for something amazingly creamy and dreamy with a kick of caffeine, then this is the shake for you. My go-to order is the feta portabella wrap with the yam fries on the side. The menu item they have periodically (that I try to track down when I can) is the massaman curry. They previously had this curry at their Liberty Cafe location and periodically serve it as the soup special. The seating options are endless, so anyone will find their perfect space to veg out and enjoy the coffee, tea, baked goods, and eclectic ambiance. Thank you Alex and Linda for giving Green Bay the gift of Kavana...bringing people together for Years to come!"}, {"review_id": "d4OPbKljgKzlsVthHUnlnw", "user_id": "if84Qz1qZIXO89StEZuVWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/14/2017", "text": "True gem in a small town!

If you want a taste of local flavor, look no further. Kavarna is a classic 'third space'  in downtown Green Bay where you'll see people of all ages working, meeting, catching up, reading, studying, etc. With a wide range of seating options on two levels, there's a table and setup for everyone - including a play area for children. Kavarna hosts community events on-site, too. I absolutely love their food. I've never had a dish that isn't spectacular - that applies to their entrees, sandwiches and baked goods. My personal favorite breakfast is their avocado toast - two pieces of whole wheat bread with avocado, a bit of olive oil and sea salt, and a side salad and grapes. It's so filling and the best breakfast deal for somewhere around $5-6. I'm pretty hooked on their peanut butter bars and scones, too. The Rabbit sandwich is my favorite lunch/Wednesday night farmers market option. Their hummus is also exceptional.I don't share the same enthusiasm for their drip coffee. I don't like Anodyne Coffee (the roaster where their coffee is from) and tend to not order black coffee when visiting Kavarna. They do make great espresso drinks, so I would suggest you order an Americano if you are looking for a black coffee alternative. I typically go for the iced tea of the day, their vast tea menu or a honey latte. If I could wish or suggest anything to the ownership, it would be that Kavarna look into possibly using Colectivo (formerly Alterra Coffee) out of Milwaukee instead of Anodyne Coffee. There are not many places in Greater Green Bay that have Colectivo (only three others that I know of in De Pere, Denmark and Allouez - all on the East Side!) and I MUCH prefer their roasts. A word about the ownership - Alex and Linda are fantastic, involved, community-driven people. They give back to the community and are truly committed to being a part of a sustainable, local foods movement. This is a place where you'll feel good about spending your money!This is a great place to meet for working, meeting or to study. There is quieter, more secluded seating downstairs and great large tables for meetings back there, as well. Wi-fi can be a bit spotty at times - if you must have it, you might want to rely on your phone or a hot spot. I recommend that you park BEHIND Broadway and come in through the back entrance. You'll find longer term parking and easier access than street parking."}, {"review_id": "5lRh82H0iej66vYNBeYmuw", "user_id": "WV5XKbgVHJXEgw7f-b6PVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/29/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I still stand by my original star rating but I need to update the review since I have tried so many more things. This is a legit 5 star coffee shop. Their coffee selections are always awesome. The have a black board with the daily specials and every time I come I pick something off the special menu. This time I stuck with my trusty delicious chai but selected the huevos rancheros wrap for breakfast. Stuffed with fluffy eggs and southwest salsa flavors it was filling. They toasted the wrap so it was slightly crispy. I would order this in a heart beat again. Side was apples which were crisp and refreshing. Still get any of the lunch options I mentioned in my last post but maybe stop by for breakfast too!"}, {"review_id": "XXNaxpQgSZk3Yp6Ng3hGsg", "user_id": "Zof5LevynuBuY00HNbbhlA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/25/2016", "text": "Hipster spot in the middle of downtown Green Bay. It looks like a trendy cafe that happens to serve sandwiches wraps and beer.

The bakery items are plentiful, so many choices I wanted one of everything!  Whether vegetarian or not you must try their gypsy veritable soup, I believe they serve it daily not as a soup of the day.  The reason I am only giving them three stars is the way they handled the Cafe Crawl.  Clearly the were not prepared for the number of people that came, that's fine but the woman that was waving her arms and telling everyone \" no more samples, we can't do it anymore\" was awful. If you can't do anymore samples that's cool but just come out and say be nice about it like; \"hey everyone, I am sorry but we are out of coffee samples, very sorry\" instead of basically shooing everyone out of the shop, I mean I would have bought coffee. None of the other places we went seemed as overwhelmed as Kavarna. I would go back again though because the soup is so good."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/kavarna-coffeehouse-green-bay-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
