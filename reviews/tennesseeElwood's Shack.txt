Please treat yourself to food as amazing as you deserve, and go here. Get the tacos. Or the pizza. You can't go wrong. If you're saying to yourself, \"you know, I'm kind of a crappy person. I probably don't deserve such delectable delights,\" then take your butt somewhere else because this stuff is too good for you. And consider being a better person.

You know what I'm talking about...... The stuff that tasted so good when you were in Elementary school? This spot is pretty decent. Ribs. Fish Tacos. BBQ pizza. It has it all. That is also the reason why I chose to come here cause I was a bit too BBQed out so far on our trip to Tennesse. Get their meat pizza. You'll feel like a kid again.

On a scale of 1-10, I give it an 8, hence the 4 stars/80%. It's a good burger and it will feed you, but it's not a great burger and it does not earn a spot in my personal top ten Memphis burgers. I should deduct another star because they don't serve fries or onion rings. They should be punished for their crimes! I had potato salad instead which was mixed good and had a nice flavor, but the potato was undercooked in my opinion. You don't want it mushy, but you'll see in my pictures the sharp edges and corners. Nobody wants hard potatoes! Even for a half pound burger, it was just too big. It seemed to be a pressed patty, and it just had too much diameter, and too thin to cook properly. It wasn't totally dry, but it wasn't juicy by any means. It wasn't even greasy either. It was overcooked, especially for medium. It even had some burned animal on it. It did not have that fleshy goodness inside at all. It didn't particularly have a good taste either. I did like the lettuce. They gave me my money's worth on onions, but red onions are better. I know. I'm being too critical. The bread was good, but I think it was just too much. It matched the patty, but I'd much have preferred a smaller bun with a thicker patty. The bacon was obviously cooked the same day. My problem with the bacon was that it was super salty, like country ham. I thought the two cheeses was just too much. Maybe this burger should be 3 stars instead of 4."}, {"review_id": "atXXM-LxFx7p-HKeSi6HRw", "user_id": "Py8mM-v_phjUBIhvnzVtZA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "This is a great hole in the wall place for lunch. We ordered the sampler which was ribs, chicken , jerk chicken, pull pork and brisket and two sides which we chose pasta salad and coleslaw including a drink it was about $35 dollars. You will definitely get a mouth full of smoked and seasoned goodness. All of our food was Hot, tender and juicy. I was surprised not one item was dried out. The jerk chicken is really good, but I have had it from Jamaica so I can't say great. The minus one star is for two reasons:1. This place is hidden and hard to find and also isn't the easiest place to get in or out2. My husband has a military and police ID and the girl at the register said they can only give discounts to employees in uniform. After most law enforcement and military personnel have made their day. There ready to relax and jump into some comfortable clothes. I understand some places does not offer military, fire, police or any discount but if your going to honor them for there work and putting there lives on the line, let's honor them also when there in regular clothing as long as they have the proper Identification that says there who they say they are because with a job like that there serving there country and protecting people even when there not in uniform.Other than that, I have no complaints"}, {"review_id": "IqLSNzSon8sPY8Sze5sSTg", "user_id": "was2NZlQ15XJpxE5iFowuQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/13/2017", "text": "Wow! So so good!! We were on our way on a road trip from Houston to Nashville and decided to sample some Memphis bbq. My hubby said he wanted to try this place because he saw it on one of the Food Network channels. We were more than thrilled with our choice!!! Now first let's me tell you it's kind of hidden off of Summer Ave but the Yelp directions will take you exactly to their door. There's a big parking lot next to this place that you can use and if you are driving a long vehicle, towing a trailer or something like that, there's plenty of room. Don't be fooled by this places appearance- it is called \"shack\" for a reason. It has picnic tables outside with a patio over and even an outdoor air conditioner. The flies were a bit annoying but we gobbled up everything so quickly they soon disappeared !I had the half rack of ribs dry and they were so tender!!! Hubby had the brisket burrito and cuz had the brisket taco (which is huge!). So glad we can here. If we are ever in Memphis again. We will have to stop by. The service was exceptional - friendly and helpful."}, {"review_id": "AfvXs932HNaVjE9hDu14Dw", "user_id": "vwRG7r8kELEqN60ep_JgEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/30/2017", "text": "How to find a good meal while on the road:1) Yelp 4 and 5 star restaurants that are are just one $2) Pick one that sounds tasty and stop inCongrats! You've just found a local favorite / dive worth mentioning. That's how we found Elwood's Shack.

I don't consider myself a connoisseur in BBQ - not even a fan really - but you can't go wrong with coming here. Restaurant really is a shack (with sturdier walls) located IN Lowe's parking lot! You can get to it from the street too but I think most people find it easier to drive into Lowe's and drive around until you find it (hint: follow the cars that don't look like they're there to buy appliances). We had the steelhead trout taco, Tijuana dog, the Reuben, and the BBQ pizza. Personally I liked the taco and hot dog the best; honestly the Tijuana dog was hands-down the best hot dog I've ever had (yes I'm a fan of hot dogs). Everything was delicious though. There is some seating inside, but additional seating outside too around the shack with some covering. The inside can get really smokey (I mean, what do you expect) and could actually be a bit irritating if you have sensitive eyes/nose. The outside seating is limited but clean and cute. Definitely sit outside if the weather is nice!! The store is busy for sure, but the staff is nice and quick. We didn't wait too long for our food. This is a staple to Memphis' BBQ scene. Definitely come give it a try!!!"}, {"review_id": "PER1wnl_BEQ8Yo-B9QRxuA", "user_id": "VDDWXz1ExpU5lEWlaJCjBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/31/2017", "text": "I am basing this review solely on the brisket and fish tacos. I have been itching to go to Elwood's for a LONG time. I wish that itch had brought me to this shack earlier. Both the brisket and the fish taco were exceptional. I had one of those moments with each taco where I get really thoughtful. I think about life and cooking and how anything could make me that happy. It's almost inconceivable that such a simple meal could send a person into such a blissful state. The brisket was so rich and roast-like. It was fall apart tender. The fish was flaky and buttery. Both tacos had a wonderful mix of greens and a crispy quesadilla style flour tortilla.Now I'm getting hungry.

If you want some real, authentic, original, Memphis style cooking ask the locals where to go. I live here and still ask.. I was directed to this gem today! My partner and mother went out for a late brunch and shopping and we landed here thanks to the cashier at a local business! This place is hidden off the road actually inside and beside the Lowe's on Summer Ave! Not only are the employees helpful and very informative but they can offer up some good selections! The food was beyond amazing and with each bite I took it just kept getting better. We had the Philly Cheese Brisket Wrap, Fish Tacos, homemade potato salad, and blue cheese jalapeño slaw!
