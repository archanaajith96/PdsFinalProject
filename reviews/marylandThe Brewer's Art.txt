Their resurrection ale is always the classic I recommend for all my friends when they visit. I have had their Tiny Tim and Beazly as well and both are delicious also. The stand out for me, though, is their mac and cheese. I am fairly picky about mac and cheese, preferring a Thomas Jefferson (yes, one of our founding fathers popularized what is now one of the most popular dishes in America) style more dry mac and cheese. Brewer's cheese mix is delicous, their macaroni have a great chew, and there is the perfect ratio of crunchy crumb topping to noodle so that there is texture with every bite.Whenever friends come visit, I like to take them to the one-two punch of the Belvedere Owl bar followed by Brewer's Art. It gives them a look at the cool architecture seen in the city, as well as the history, fun quirks and delicious food that Baltimore has to offer."}, {"review_id": "mjPkIcxLQqtyNc2fNhdKfA", "user_id": "UL-dYA-QhWeVMfz5NRf1Lg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "I have been to Brewer's Art twice, and both experiences were great. The first time, I opted for the Indecision Plate (which comes with a variety of cheeses, meats, pickles, spreads, and crostini) as well as the Rosemary Garlic Fries, which were both flavorful and worth the try. The second time, I opted for the Sausage Platter, which came with local sausages, potato salad, sauerkraut slaw, red onion jam, resurrection mustard, curry ketchup, pretzel bread. The platter was well thought out, with a nice balance of flavors and textures. Service was good - the waitstaff was knowledgable about the menu items and food came out at an appropriate pace. Overall: food is definitely well thought out and solid, although not particularly unique/interesting. I've definitely enjoyed my experience here and will be back!"}, {"review_id": "fFGM1IF27LA4wWPTNKm7Zw", "user_id": "ElItX6762HJ-Fo_XVLwkKQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Wanted to add that I finally stopped in here on a Sunday for their brunch and it was great!

Definitely not disappointed at all! This place is very eclectic and nestled inside of a building in Mount Vernon. When you first walk in the upstairs level, there's a bar to your immediate right, to the left of that bar is where you enter their social area with him or tables and chairs for consumers to sit. The establishment was beautiful! The walls had eclectic paint on it as well as very tasteful artwork. Everyone that works there so helpful. While we waited for our party to arrive, we were approached by at least three employees asking if we needed anything or wanted to order anything to drink while we waited. The reservation host was so accommodating with doing a plus one on my reservation as well as accommodating three people who came extremely late. Our actual table person was very very consistent. She was kind, and fast. Sadly I didn't get her name but I would know her if I saw her this second! She made sure all of our appetizers, beverages and entrees came out in quick time as well as made sure we never had a clutter of dishes on the table providing comfortable space for active dishes.I ordered the solstice sangria, white sweet potato soup, hudson valley duck leg confit and pumpkin spice cake. Everything was absolutely perfect!Parking can be difficult, but it's not impossible. We were able to park a block-and-a-half down and just walk up. This is a very very busy and happening area so wherever you park makes it worth the walk to get where you trying to go."}, {"review_id": "GYiFCjbqVXONzpSEDj7OOw", "user_id": "7NXTYSTcowTKMKZftUtN9Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "The Brewer's Art is a Baltimore staple, and a classic. It has two levels, and an environment for everyone: a great, speak-easy style bar (downstairs); an excellent restaurant (upstairs at the back); even a well-lit bar-restaurant area & lounge (upstairs front entrance).The front bar and the downstairs bar have very different atmospheres but they complement each other well. The downstairs bar can get crowded and loud, which can impair conversation and makes it hard to meet new people.  The upstairs bar is bright, spacious and a bit quieter; while I tend to prefer this, they usually shut this area down around midnight so if you're here late, the downstairs bar will be your only option. There is no doubt in my mind that the best things about Brewer's Art are the restaurant and the beer. While the bar plates are good, the restaurant menu arguably consists of some of the best food in Baltimore; and while the cocktails are also decent, BA is definitely a brewery at heart. Overall, I can always expect a solid experience here.  Happy hour is ALL day Sunday and Monday!"}, {"review_id": "yS9_SDnfxLGnOu2TJrGvWQ", "user_id": "JS7VSWD7Xc4C8rxoSgn4Tw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "I went here with my boyfriend and our friend for dinner.

How late this place is open every night (1:45AM) despite it NOT being in a very commercial area should stand out and help confirm/validate its solid popularity. While there are other venues in walking distance from Brewer's Art, it is a far, far cry from the ease of access found in other bars when compared to the Inner Harbor, Fells Pt., Federal Hill, etc... yet, whenever we go, it livens up as the hours grow later.Vibe 1: The upstairs. bar area.This area is open first and has a nice high table & bar area as soon as you walk in the non-descript building, that looks more like a city bank building or apartment residence than a bar. The bar itselt is perpendicular to the window facing the street, and by day, the large window provides much natural light to fill this area. Odd paintings, some may consider creepy,  adorn this area--  but I like the ambiguous oddities of those paintings. The full menu is offered here and the vibe is casual, even though the \"bar cuisine\" resembles a higher-priced, nouveau restaurant fare with yummy aligot potato pierogies made with \"Oxtail ragu, grilled pickled onions, horseradish crème fraîche\"-- yep, that is just one such appetizer that separates this bar from others. The braised lamb trangioli pasta is another  solid choice that I enjoyed as a contrast to bar fare such as fries, pretzels, dips, etc...but wait! They have those items too (very crispy hand-cut garlic fries!), all made with the same attention to detail, and fine dining as the pierogie and pasta items i listed above. The meat and/or cheeseboard is very satisfying with ample choices for those interested in charcuterie.Vibe 2 : The upstairs, restaurant areaArguably you could break this area into 2 of its own but really, it is a fusion of the bar area by the window and the white-table cloth area of the dining room. Across a large wooden fireplace are sofas and standard small tables that, like the entrance bar, serve the full menu but have more of a \"bar setting\"--  though this area is morphing more into the dining room with its warm lighting and light colored walls. Beyond this area in a dark wood, darker colored walls area is the formal dining room. White table cloths and low lighting radiate a romantic and intimate, true-fine-dining restaurant atmosphere. It feels more appropriate to order the pan seared scallops with \"vanilla Scented Squash Purée, Endive Salad, Wild Mushrooms, Roe\" here than at the bar, but we have :)The lamb shank is well prepared and worth having. Vibe 3: The basement, the classic dive bar--soooo good.From the in-transition\" room of the upstairs, you will find a staircase to the downstairs that usually opens later than the upstairs (around 1-2 hours, I think, depending on the crowd, the day, the ???)The music is louder here, the lighting dimmer, the ceiling much lower when compared to the upstairs. The tables leading up to the bar are off to the sides and include 2-3 isolated rooms along the sides that have a speakeasy appearance to give a fun yet clandestine feel.The bar is V-shaped and the walls brick. The only natural light are the small basement-sized windows  above the bar, at street level. The bar overall has a red-lit look that makes it resemble that \"dive\" or \"cave\" type bar, that well, I love. You can also enter this area directly from the street by walking downstairs to the right (I think) of the entrance.It is now that I will get to the Brewer's Art beers (and it's about time, right?!)-- Their own creations are on tap w/ other brands in bottles, etc...  Being an IPA fan, one who has read my work would think I would be disappointed in the lack of true IPAs on the menu, but I am not-- not after tasting their offerings. [it should be noted that ONCE, a couple months ago, for the first time in years, I saw on their and ordered a true IPA and loved it-- a week or 2 later, it was gone, and I have not seen it since  :(   why remove it??!?! ] Not to worry, the other beers are so good, it ALMOST makes the lack of an IPA alright. Note: Overall the beers have that Belgian influence.The Resurrection is the malty, dubbel that you will find all over Baltimore and beyond and with good reason. It is smooth and good for almost any occasion despite its full body, heavy appearance. Lighter and smoother is the Proletary as a dark ale, though I prefer the Resurrection because of its multi-hop and multi-malt rich flavor. As a nice contrast to the Resurrection is the copper-colored Petroleuse with an overall sweeter air, but with a more hop bitter finish. (wow, do I wish it were happy hour...)Fans of a classic Belgian Strong Ale? Get the he Beazly (ex-Ozzy) -- when I was on a Belgian kick, this hit the spot and reminded me of sunset, in a bar overlooking the main square in Belgium.Whether a strict foodie, a beer hound, looking for a vibe or 3, or any mix of that- you must GO!"}, {"review_id": "H6uHs5k5bc9lZPsqZhspBQ", "user_id": "fUguDPcgQ-uDVMUe0G5weA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "One of Mount Vernon's oldest spots is easily one of my favorites. The Brewer's Art has been a Mount Vernon destination for over 21 years. The restaurant has two menus, a bar menu and a dining room menu. You can get the dining room menu at the bar but you cannot get the bar menu in the dining room. Pro tip, the mac and cheese here is fantastic - sit at the bar and order this (it made my best of 2017 list).During my most recent visit, my girlfriend and I grabbed two seats at the bar. It was such a cold night, we needed something as comforting as the mac and cheese. Also, there's happy hour specials on the Brewer's Art beers.Because the Mac N Cheese is one of my favorite dishes in Baltimore, of course we started with an order. The dish is baked in a skillet so there are crispy edges, which I am a huge fan of. The dish is so cheesy and buttery, it's the ultimate winter comfort meal.With the intention of also getting something green and healthy-ish added to this meal, we opted to split a Caesar Salad. The dressing was creamy, the asiago crouton was cheesy, and it was a hit.Lastly, we shared the Creekstone Farms Black Angus Cheeseburger. It may not look like anything special, but for sure it is one of my favorite burgers in the city. Yes, even better than Hamilton Tavern. The patty is cooked to a perfect medium rare and so juicy. Even better, they come with a side of Rosemary Garlic Fries which I can't get enough of."}, {"review_id": "tupsVKgWOl1amNWWItvjUA", "user_id": "rLtmJInc-k3L4iT2BuNOUQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/17/2017", "text": "We came to the Brewer's Art with our friends and loved the dark vibes and cozy atmosphere. We had dinner upstairs (and then went downstairs after dinner...but it was too packed to grab a drink!)Dinner was really good, but not outstanding. The menu had a good variety of offerings - but pricier than I was expecting. I kind of felt like there was an identity crisis going on here to be honest. It felt like it wanted to be a brewpub but also an upscale restaurant...and didn't necessarily succeed at either. The indecision plate was pretty good for sharing (I wish we had tried the pretzel too!) The pork tenderloin was good. Desserts were definitely the highlight - the butterscotch pudding was awesome, and the chocolate cake was outstanding. Service was....fine, but a bit less engaging than I would have liked.I might give it another try if I'm back in the area, just to give it another chance.

Being that we like to take our server's recommendations, we order the indecision plate with some of the most mouthwatering cheeses and meats I've ever tasted - particularly the horseradish cheddar - delish! The potato appetizer was on point. For entrees, My two friends and I enjoyed the steak over the rosemary fries and my husband ate the pork belly. We both found ourselves reminding each other to slow down, the food was just so good. For dessert, we tried the carrot cake, bombe, and a delicious peanut butter treat. The bombe was a perfect combination of sweet and tart - the Nutella matching the tart little cherries on the plate. Thank you, Brewer's Art, for not disappointing.
