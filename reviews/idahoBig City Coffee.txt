The portions are huge and the tastiness level is consistently 5/5. All of their egg dishes are steamed so expect lovely fluffy eggs every single time. The quiche of the day should also not be missed. Great veggie options as well!If you're not in the mood for savory, they have incredible breakfast baked goods. And don't forget to try their speciality espresso drinks either. Bottom line - you should try this place!"}, {"review_id": "SuHAAgn3EZ90p3W8kpI9iw", "user_id": "E5Qm5W2BsMFCTirHq4DEIQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "And the worst coffee shop in town goes to! ( drumroll ) ... Big City Coffee in the Linen district.And here's why :The staff is incompetent. Im unable to tell if they are passive aggressive, hard of hearing or both. I was regretfully here yesterday for lunch and I can tell you I had to go back to the line not once , not twice , but three times because they could not get me and my one other friends order right for reasons unknown to me . ( FYI I ordered a veggie breakfast wrap w/ sausage on the side with a Scandinavian coffee ) they gave me the breakfast wrap w/ diced chicken - WTF ? I won't get into the details of what it took for them  to correct their mistakes . aside  from the country music blaring , the pictures of cows and pigs on The walls  , along with the \" Big Titty blend \" coffee products , the overall vibe of this place is if a Walmart in some small town in Texas had a coffee shop / restaurant . Also do they microwave the eggs here ? Why are the portions so enormous as well !?  This place is the worst ."}, {"review_id": "SvtehhgWkdT1AVHaRH2TuA", "user_id": "pmjp9bB4LaS1UqH4njYrzw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "This place has high's and lo's.

Not joking there was enough bacon to fill you up. A full order is impossible for one person to eat. The bacon jalapeño quiche was really good.

Today I visited and I was super impressed; therefore, I am updating my review from a 2 to a 5 (would do 4.5 if I could) and here is why. I walked in with one of my besties, Yesi, and the place was packed. Even the front tables were full and it was only 50 degrees outside. The line took about 10 minutes. Someone came out and took our order as we stood. The service was great, the atmosphere was on point, the food was amazing! We were able to sit at the big table in the middle with strangers, which to me, was super fun and enjoyable. Felt like I was back in High School sitting with the popular people-- only I didn't get shunned away this time--- kidding! ... well, kinda :) I got the refinery scramble with turkey ($8.99). It was huge! The eggs were super fluffy and had good chunks of real carved turkey (not lunch meat) and came with fresh fruit (see photos). My dining companion got a 1/2 order of biscuits and gravy with bacon on top and it was a very large portion and she said it tasted very good. Their pastries look amazing. I bought my kids a cinnamon roll and it was very big. They said it was very good and not dry. This is a great place to bring out of towners or friends that have never been. Sharing a plate is my suggestion, though. The portions are very, very big and the prices are affordable."}, {"review_id": "4KUG1XEh9imkwUc56wZrPQ", "user_id": "qZECMB7tDTntGUmaOqyLIg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/21/2017", "text": "The baked goods are on point (seriously, everything is delicious and HUGE) and the serving sizes for the food is unreal and VERY large! This is truly a special place in Boise and stands out as a \"must visit\" if friends are coming in from out of town. The quality and consistency of the food is excellent each time I've come to visit.Here are the drawbacks...seating can be very difficult to acquire because something that adds to the charm is also a little frustrating at times, all of the tables are different sizes with different types of chairs. You usually will make friends with some other diners along the way and share their table. This isn't a big deal but if you are a private diner who expects healthy isolation then go towards the back of the place at the bar where you are probably hidden by cases containing mounds of massive delicious baked goods. It's a pay first, grab a number, then deliver. Not everyone is going to be a fan of that style and traffic at the coffee station is always a problem. Like I mentioned before, some of the things that are \"problems\" are also what make this place so special. I love the rustic interior but the music can be a bit all over the place. If you've never gone, go. The steamed eggs are unique and delicious and unless you're a glutton for punishment then only go for the 1/2 biscuits with gravy (trust me, a half serving is beyond what any normal human should be able to consume, don't believe me? Try on a full order for size and watch your table mate's eyes widen in shock at the enormous order)."}, {"review_id": "FgMtQyhajX4sK6FXlq8yVQ", "user_id": "RGJ3UrTouNKj-tzW5Awwxg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/18/2017", "text": "I love Big City.

During my last visit I tried one of their breakfast sandwiches - their BBC which is a toasted bagel with eggs, bacon, and cheese. *Side note, it was only $5.99, what a steal for a decent sized meal! One of the most delicious breakfast sandwiches I have ever had! Left me feeling quite satisfied!My only complaint is that Big City gets REALLY busy especially during the weekends. It can be very hard to find seating and a bit difficult to maneuver your way around the restaurant once it gets full.

For coffee: I really like their Bit O' Honey latte or iced mocha (it all depends on the weather), and for food: the B Bagel or OBGYF.  Their pastries are MASSIVE- seriously, you could share one with like 4 people. If you dare to attempt to eat one by yourself, kudos to you- but even this carb-lover has found that there is such a thing as \"too much bread\".Big City has been very crowded every time I've gone (typically weekend mornings- which is to be expected), so if you're looking for a quaint little cafe that is peaceful and serene, you probably wouldn't jive well with this atmosphere.
