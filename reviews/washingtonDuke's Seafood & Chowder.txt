I was 10 minutes late and as I pulled into the parking lot they called me to check up on me. The hostess that worked was extremely welcoming and it seemed like if you walked in it was a 30 minute wait. The server in charge of the section my friend and I were sitting at is extremely good at his job and we both loved our experience there. As the quality of the food for the price is worth it, in my opinion. Just know I havent gone to a lot of seafood restaurants but the Halibut I ate melted like butter in my mouth. Along with the clamchowder, they have the recipe on a mini piece of paper when served."}, {"review_id": "0WKfLcQK94ZjEc-6iICdCg", "user_id": "8Hxhiu3jXyLwGzYLyoXe0Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Claaammm chowda! This is just a wonderful place to be. The food is good, the ambiance is cheesy and adorable and the service is good. I had a small claw chowder which was so delicious and apparently, an award winner. They have like three chowders to choose from and all of them are diverse and delicious. They offer wine from a Washington local winery called Ste Michelle and that is also delicious. When I visited, they were running a promotion where proceeds from wine sales go to charity which is pretty rad. I also had a juicy cheeseburger ( in the small size, which by the way, it is so nice they offer two sizes) and it was super good. They were sweet to bring out our scoop of ice cream for my cousin's birthday and I just loved my experience over all."}, {"review_id": "1_yWWhUuXGordfx5OWgazw", "user_id": "AaI1LBE2RRLY3rvFLkHnpQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Stunning, fresh, well-put together seafood dishes. I had a great expierencie here. Our server was amazing and the food was more than exceptional. The crab cake is a must try if you love crab cakes. The clam chowder was good, but to me was very powerful in taste and seasoning - but is very different from your typical clam chowder.Definitely a quality over quantity place. Now, first entering the place I was skeptical. There was a long letter the owner wrote at the host stand and the first thing I saw was \"Donald Trump\" on the letter. Not a great first impression, you'd think the owner is pro-trump...but after taking the time to read it, it was a letter to him addressing Wild Salmon issues.I personally wouldn't recommend putting this letter in the front, because just seeing the presidents name may rub people the wrong way....it did for me at first glance."}, {"review_id": "a5tOFQx949JMiQmCbqAF3w", "user_id": "rXugY4MRThQhtrUNBTbI8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "The food is great and I love the view, especially in the spring/summer.The staff are amazing always making sure we are happy and like our food.

Met up with my girl friends to introduce them to my favorite blueberry martini. They loved it so much we ordered several rounds. Service was great and the drinks are perfect. Not a long line for waiting for a seat or a table for 4, as there was plenty of open spots in the bar on a Friday night.

This location is on the Ruston Way waterfront and although the weather wasn't great, it was still an enjoyable experience. Fun ambiance and excellent service with an attention to detail.I had the beloved original clam chowder, which comes with a recipe to make at home. Thank you, Duke! It is quite a tasty chowder and you can get it in several sizes to suit you. For my main, I enjoyed the cod fish and chips (combo), which two pieces turned out to be quite a lot. I had leftovers! Fish was flaky and delicious, fries were large and just okay. Complimentary bread was warm and yummy.The Bloody Mary is well known and for good reason. The right amount of spice, topped with two prawns, an olive and asparagus. It's a tasty treat in a funky glass. Overall, I really enjoyed this location and remember why I keep coming back to Duke's!"}, {"review_id": "2mAiDDHXxV7ti-5NxKQw1g", "user_id": "H0nlzaLPa6n6bacVwJkM7g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "While visiting Tacoma I stopped at this great lunch spot right on the water!

This was just above and beyond. The chowder sampler was loved by my mother. I had the chowder and salad combo.

Came here because my girlfriend has to be gluten-free, and the menu here has a TON of gluten-free options. Well, quite honestly, it has a TON of delicious options, gluten-free or not!Had two things: the award winning clam chowder and halibut fish and chips. While not on the level of Pike Place Chowder's clam chowder, it's pretty close in my book. Although heavy on herbs, it's really flavorful and tasty...really good to dip sourdough bread in for sure. And although I wasn't entirely sold on the halibut fish and chips even when I made the order, I was pleasantly surprised. They don't use a ton of batter, so you're actually getting nearly all fish with a bit of crispiness on the outside. Halibut was fried fresh without being overcooked. Way way way better than I was expecting.Everyone wants to sit outside when the weather is good, but there are a ton of seats inside as well. Even with all that, this place looks to be real popular. Even at 3 pm on a Sunday, there was a line for the outside patio.Our server was really friendly and courteous, no complaints at all.Although Duke's food is on the expensive side since all their seafood is farmed from sustainable sources, their quality speaks volumes. Will come back."}, {"review_id": "8hnm4y5fnEcSfkP6Wsh-FA", "user_id": "MJytEOSmPVruOXOxxyd9qg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "DELICIOUS CHOWDER FOOD: I forgot exactly what it was called, but I got this set where you can try a few of their different kinds of clam chowder.

I am still on a salad hunt for the best one I can find. I have found some good ones. Still not chosen a favorite ill keep ya posted.  I ordered the unchopped seafood salad. It was not my favorite but it is my belief it would have been better with my seafoodnchopped up they gave the option but my man answered for me saying unchopped. Either way love this place might be my favorite here on ruston way. Have a few more spots to try. Customer service 10star if possible to give him a ratingThis guy alex ( one of the managers I was just informed) was great, he really knew everything there was to know about everything on the menu. He was able to describe each of clam chowders we tried and it was lobster pernot was my favorite.   Being that hes the manager I guess theres no promotion to give him. But if there was he deserves it. We will be back and ty for taking time to teach us everything you could about what we ordered. Drinks orderedBlueberry lemon drop  it was really good and might be my mans fav.Blood orange margarita x 2 which means they really good Grapefruit nirvana x 2Nectarine mule"}, {"review_id": "ziy49Cd2mnnViUCQuWcCZg", "user_id": "DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2017", "text": "On a chilly night in Tacoma nothing sounds better than to have a hot bowl of chowdah! Forget Duke of Earl, you need the Duke of Chowder and you can find no greater variety than at Duke's.We were first served some freshly baked sourdough bread. It was very moist and soft. I wasn't the biggest fan of it (Something about the texture was a little off to me) but it did go well with my meal.For my entree I had the chowder combo with all the varieties offered on the menu. It included red, white, and spicy Cajun style chowders. They all had a very distinct taste that set them apart from each other. One of my favorite chowders was a red chowder that had crab in it. The New England style clam chowder was pretty good as well. I had a blueberry lemonade to go with my meal which was sweet and refreshing. It had fresh muddled blueberries in it which was nice.I was pretty stuffed after having the starter bread and chowder. Each of the 5 chowders they give you is around 2 oz so by the time you've finished your meal you've ingested more than 1/2 lb of soup/stew.  In addition to chowder they have various seafood dishes to choose from. Before you leave check out the beautiful patio with scenic views of the water and twinkling lights from far away. Overall it was a pretty satisfying meal and I wouldn't mind going back again if I were in the Tacoma area."}, {"review_id": "bUsVBWrjqojggRJfScsesA", "user_id": "fRkZVZ4W_C80tRMgi7bNmA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/10/2017", "text": "For starters the view is amazing! The restaurant is right on the water so it makes for a great scenic backdrop. But... because it is right on the water, that's basically what you're paying for. Me and hubby came here for a date night. We walked up and down Ruston Way and were a bit undecided on where to go, so we chose here. The wait time was ridiculous BUT to their defense, it was a Friday evening. The wait time was I believe just about an hour or more. We finally get seated in a super cute little nook table for 2 overlooking the patio area, the water, and Mt. Ranier to the right! It was beautiful!We ordered chicken strips and a kale salad for an appetizer and that was bomb. The salad was on point! For our main dishes, I ordered fish n chips and hubby ordered some house burger. He stated that his burger was really great and juicy! I, on the other hand, was a bit disappointed with my selection. Don't get me wrong, the fish n chips was in fact delicious, but... for the price that it was (I believe almost $20) I was expecting them to be thee best I've ever tasted in my life!!! Sadly, it wasn't... Paya Thai fish in Tacoma at the Freight house still had them beat.Our waitress was extremely nice and helpful though! Great customer service! That's why I'm giving it 4 stars, for the view, customer service, and my hubby loved his burger lol!Don't know if I would come back again simply because of the prices but who knows..."}, {"review_id": "bUHwmN7WL8fAdIFoBNcbtw", "user_id": "5p-4kkphi5gUq6S5LQbj4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Duke's on Ruston Way in Tacoma has it all -- fresh, beautifully prepared seafood, a waterfront location with gorgeous views, a courteous, well-trained staff, an attractive, cozy decor, and creative, signature cocktails.

Duke's didn't disappoint.  He had crab-stuffed salmon with fresh sautéed vegetables. Husband ate every bit and proclaimed that it was delicious. My dad and I had the fish and chips with clam  chowder.  I love their chowder -- thick and creamy with diced vegetables and tender bits of clam.
