I was famished at Graceland and so we decided to drag ourselves away and have some lunch. Uncle Lou's Fried Chicken was nearby and had some great reviews so we decided to check it out. We were greeted outside by the owner, a warm, friendly and personable man. We walked in and were handed menus on the way to the counter. I ordered a 3 piece mild with corn fritters as my side. This was an excellent choice and a lot of food! We were there before the afternoon rush so we were able to sit right down. Our food wasn't rushed nor was it slow. This is good, because it means the stuff isn't precooked and sitting. Everything was hot and fresh served on a paper plate. It's not white tablecloth. It's not any table cloth. But the food is good and the service is sincere and friendly. The price is fair. I'll be sure to visit Uncle Lou's again next time I'm in town."}, {"review_id": "l40YIHDJUUzRGQPyTzjhxQ", "user_id": "9N0eKiaaLAWk2tYLfKUyUg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Diners drive ins and dumps! I'm one of the highest visitors of Triple D joints in the nation (Lou's #433) and I can tell you the more predominant the Guy Fieri poster the less worthy the place. This place is dirty run down and dated. If the dining area is this bad what does the. Kitchen look like? The items are listed on the walls with cardboard posters with no prices, however with fried bologna and burgers you could imagine the prices are manageable. Once I got to the counter thinking they only served wings the very pleasant young lady showed me the menu. 3 pieces 2 ways 1 dry 2 with spicy love sauce.  I asked if the onion rings were made in-house and was told yes. Sadly they sucked, they seemed like they came from a freezer and were very sub par. The corrupted carrots were the hit of the show I liked them ate a few and chucked 90%  in the trash along with all but 2 of the onion rings. The chicken was edible, 3 piece dark is 1 thigh and 2 legs, I wanted to try the home style to see what their fried chicken was like dry and it too was sub par and over cooked. I ate the thigh and the sauce is the savior, it's good! Wangy and tangy it saves the chicken by adding flavor and some moisture. I have to say the thigh was certainly better than the legs. The biscuit was top shelf! So here's my assessment; clean the place update the signage to show that they sell  chicken parts, don't overcook the legs, lose the giant guy poster on the front window. I don't understand the hype but it was worth the visit even though I threw the majority of my meal in the garbage can."}, {"review_id": "D4cHHS1PRvLO1OQF6oLHlw", "user_id": "0NZLdG_w3OWW0QsbnuHUqQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "\"A fine American Establishment\" - these were the words uttered by my friend as we walked into Uncle Lou's. Full disclosure, we came here only because it was the closest to our hotel for a surprise extra night on a business trip to Memphis, so I was unaware of this place's featuring on a couple of TV shows, though, once you get there, the life sized portraits of Guy Fieri are enough to let you know he came here. Overall, service was friendly and quick, and Lou is in fact, a great guy from my initial meeting of him. But, the place was in need of a heavy cleaning and maybe a little, tiny renovation, like, just a coat of paint or something. While the chicken was delicious, I thought the sauce wasn't all that great (think: consistency of sweet and sour sauce but really mostly spicy) and the chicken was a bit over cooked / fried. The pieces were generous, and maybe would have been better if I just had the sauce in the side, but mine were dry. My side was seasoned, fried carrots, which, while good, certainly weren't the at the table, which had to have been the fried okra or fried pickle Spears."}, {"review_id": "BX0kh-DKs8UIRAumGUFnSg", "user_id": "dNlN6CrkXKXKfHXJRD5pkg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "We are visiting for the weekend from Houston, TX.

Super dry chicken that is either just old or has been refried. I couldn't eat it all, even though I usually hate wasting food. The sauce was nothing great, either. And the gross tables and surly employees would've been fine for the divey atmosphere IF the food had been good, but alas, that wasn't the case.Really not sure what the hype is. I wouldn't have been swayed by Guy Fieri's show, but a local was telling us Lou's and Gus's were THE places to get fried chicken in Memphis...and Lou's was closer.

I couldn't be bothered eating at the hotel's restaurant for dinner which by the way it may be good or not. I feel as though I wanted to discover more of Memphis and not be relegated to tourist traps. So thanks to yelp, I found Uncle Lou's and then I discovered this place was in Diner, Drive and Dives with Guy Fieri of the Food Network. That definitely peaked my interest. It wasn't far from where I was staying so I decided to go.I haven't had fried chicken in awhile. Not that I hate it but it's one of those foods I put in the category of having it Once In A Blue Moon. It's so good but it's not good for you. It's in a mini-mall and it's very easy to miss. I enter and the place is really divey (tables sticky). I don't care if it's divey. You order at the counter and I ordered the three piece combo in which is a mix of dark and white chicken along with a biscuit and a potato salad. A server shouts out your number and brings it to your table. The chicken pieces were huge. It's is a different kind of fried chicken. Just imagine ordering the original recipe from KFC and it's that kind of friend chicken. I normally get the friend chicken which is similar to the Extra Crispy. I thought the chicken was decent. It didn't blow my mind or anything like that. I was surprised they gave so little potato salad. It's given to me in a small, mini cup. The potato salad was good. The biscuit felt like it was dipped in honey and it gives that counter taste to the fried chicken."}, {"review_id": "9TnBe5D43pR2aQllT440Ww", "user_id": "XxHDdDHPicSyXJLMgr9okw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "I'm not sure why this restaurant has a 4.5 star rating.

We got the manager's special which was 8 wings, 2 sides, and 3 biscuits. The biscuits were glazed with honey and they were just typical. The sides were fried okra and corn nuggets which were decent. These wings were wet and a little too sweet for my liking. It also has a bitter after taste. That was why I wasn't feeling the wings as much as they hype. The service was good.
