Without saying a word about being frustrated to our waiter he went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. Free beers, free food, the works. We would have been fine with a simple apology for the wait, so definitely we feel like we were compensated.We also go every Wednesday for their burger deal. Get there early because it's packed."}, {"review_id": "U1WjWmAt3gTSCGLVsKzzlg", "user_id": "b6FdQfG4nST1iMYrIulGNQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "I'd give zero stars....AWFUL!!! Don't waste your time there because they DEFINITELY wasted an hour of mine!!! Go down the street to Fat Guys and get yourself a yummy burger and bomb fries. Such pleasant and FRIENDLY FOLKS!!! NOT MCNELLLIES!!!!Walked in to the downtown location, looked around for a spot at the bar top, wasn't that busy so I was able to find two seats at the front bar. Sat down and saw 4-5 girls (all blonde) or fake blonde however you wanna look at it....so we sit down and not ONE SINGLE PERSON said hello, no one looked at us, didn't offer any menus....WE SAT AT THE BAR no lie FOR 12 minutes without being greeted. We are dressed pleasant and happy to give mcnellies our money....never again you stuck up snobs. No one said hello....not even as we entered the building. We both have been in the food industry for a decade. Extremely bad manors McNellies. I'm going to tell everyone how terrible your service lacks the decency respect. Can't even say hi?!?? Washing the dang glasses is more important than the 10$ tip we were going to give you."}, {"review_id": "CYL-BqlrdGgt2QF0IhQpHw", "user_id": "hvs6n04dKZheWJVzhB7TDg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Not too long of a wait but really loud restaurant Comfortable seating and friendly waiters Wood tablesTwo rooms and a bar in eachWe sat at the big table in front.

After several friends insisted that this spot now featured a veg@n burger, I used FaceBook Messenger to ask McNellie's directly. They responded that this was true, see my photo to view the convo. Believing this communication, I suggested a large group of folks from work grab a happy hour drink and some food from McNellie's South. So we go and I try to order the veg@n burger, called the \"Impossible Burger.\" After 30 minutes (not exaggerating), and several inquiries with our waiter, he informs me that they don't have the burger at the south side location. I was with about 12 others, all omnivores, that were in various stages of eating, ordering, drinking, etc., but they all offered to cancel orders, tab out and go to our usual happy hour spot that does have veg@n options, beer, wine, and booze. That was very nice of them but I stuck around. I figured, fair enough, I should have known that the south Tulsa location would not have veg@n food. Fast forward to last night and I suggest to a couple friends we go to McNellie's downtown to grab some adult beverages and dinner to celebrate Presidents' Day Eve. When I inquire about ordering the Impossible Burger, I am informed that the veg@n burger is not something they carry regularly and that they did not have it right then. So we left and walked to a different place with veg@n burgers, beers, wine, and booze. A magical place that is willing to exchange veg@n goods for money, plus adult style beverages. Like, don't carry veg@n food, that's fine. That is one's decision as a business owner. But to misrepresent your veg@n menu when asked after is ridiculous! I really just want to give my money to a place that is willing to give me veg@n items in exchange. So, great business strategy? McNellie's conned me into the restaurant twice. Once they got my money and the money of twelve of my friends and they didn't have to deliver on the false assurance of veg@n food- score one for McNellie's. They didn't get any ducats from us the second time, so that's a draw. Though, I can now say with a certainty that is usually reserved for things like death and taxes, that I will not ever give them money again."}, {"review_id": "6Gw4FeI3XkDRBndDcMg04g", "user_id": "SddNitt8M4dCuhPGYox7nQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "We had a really enjoyable evening at McNellie's a couple weeks back. From the moment we walked in the door, I knew it was going to be a great experience. The host was super friendly and welcoming, I believe his name was Griffin, and he was professional and helpful in accommodating our larger group of 6, really setting the tone for our dinner! We ordered the artichoke dip, which was delectable, and browsed through the expansive draft beer list. With dozens of beers on tap, you'll certainly find something agreeable. I was visiting from California, so it was exciting to see some local and unfamiliar brews. For dinner I had a sandwich made on Texas toast, which is something I'd never experienced before. Quite tasty! We will definitely stop by McNellie's on our future visits to Tulsa!"}, {"review_id": "IrByf6xYfKuP5yfmn7MKCw", "user_id": "x-TW91NSEhdokNKr604BVw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Bar staff is very nice.

I like to think of it as the birthplace of Tulsa's downtown renaissance (sorry Spaghetti Warehouse). The decor and atmosphere are 100% authentic and all the mugs on the wall give it a \"village tavern\" feel. The menu offers a wide variety of food that is tasty and well prepared. Plus, they're always adding a new item or making their existing menu better. You can tell the employees take pride in their work. Servers are prompt and there's always a member of management walking among the tables, not hiding in the store closet. This place is also great at celebrating big events like St Patty's and their very own Pub Run.

The service is always really good and it's not that crowded then, but not dead either.  On Sundays they have a Bloody Mary bar with a ton of options.  The food is good, pretty standard but above average bar food.  I do really wish they had a patio though. The only time I want to go to McNellie's but don't, it's because the weather is too perfect to spend inside.  They are a part of the McNellie's group, the Tulsa shadow corporation that owns Fassler Hall, Dilly Diner, Dust Bowl, Yokozuna, and several others.  So you know what you're going to get..... at least on the surface.  Just kidding.  There's nothing nefarious going on with them...... That we know of. Dang it, I did it again.  Seriously this time , they're just a group that owns several Tulsa bars and Restaurants.... As a front for their secret government experimental weapons tests.  Ok, I think that one was over the top enough to clearly be a joke.  They do a great job.  Please don't come after me and my family.  Shoot, I have to get out of town right away, by cover of night."}, {"review_id": "h-sqi3yBcWdjKpkqbznndg", "user_id": "aH4VdXpw9HqTx_aIWsyDjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "This is the best culture I have been around Tulsa all my life and I just now realized that there is more real Irish woman in this town than in all us"}, {"review_id": "_e0mflqNiuEkLNHAO0xNIQ", "user_id": "4HKayV7TOZ9e09IVGMGbbg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "Great vibe in this pub, while I was visiting Tulsa.  Reuben with my Porter was awesome.  Lots of beer selections, good burgers and fries as well.  The staff were helpful and friendly while we sat on stools at the bar and watched a game."}, {"review_id": "vDwhhUtLdPuK_EdxJCOveQ", "user_id": "fcBKMGCW9mZFXLISojWDzA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "A really great place in downtown Tulsa.

My friend had two choices of veggie burgers, plus others vegetables on the menu. Vegetarians could have a meal at the Downtown Tulsa location.

I like the way they came out in a flight with a print out of each of the beers and a little description of each brew. Next came out my stew. It was AMAZING!!!
