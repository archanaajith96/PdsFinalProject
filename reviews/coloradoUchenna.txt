I have been eating Ethiopian food since I was a child. I'm now well into my 30s. My parents' best friend is Ethiopian. I have had Ethiopian food across the US and know what it should taste like.That in mind, the first time I went to Uchenna, I was not impressed. I too thought the food was bland and wasn't worth going back, etc as the lower star reviewers noted. I ordered all the food with medium spice.We decided to give it another try. This time though, I decided to order the food spicy. This was the game changer. Everything was amazing; different flavors for each item. Now we go in at least once a month. We usually order the veggie combo plus two meats. We ask for it in the family style, which is the traditional way to eat Ethiopian food (all served in one big plate in the middle of the table). We have yet to be disappointed.A few notes: It is so important to make reservations, especially on the weekends. There have been plenty of times we have seen walk-ins turned away because the restaurant is booked for the evening.you do need to eat with your hands, so ask for help if you have never eaten with your hands beforetry the infused tea/lemonade. so good."}, {"review_id": "SYtX92miqcK0qyss4nY2zg", "user_id": "s_lZqGyIrDM3LKC7H4zgJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "My husband, 10 year old son, and I had lunch here for the first time today. Absolutely amazing food. The injera was spongey, fluffy and delicious. We had the combo for two with lamb and beef tibs and my son had the seafood platter, although we all ended up sharing (feeding another person yourself being a sign of respect in Ethiopian culture worked out perfectly!). The lamb and beef were perfectly seasoned, but the seafood was out of this world. I highly recommend the orange infused iced tea. Since I'm the only coffee drinker in our family, I had the coffee - served strong and traditionally black (although they will offer cream and sugar if you ask for it). Maya, the sweetest restaurant owner quite possibly  in the world, gave us a saragli to share. It's like baklava 2.0. So delicious. My son signed the guest book \"Best food I've ever eaten. Five stars!\"  and we each have Maya a hug before leaving. We'll definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "4qRJQFqB0iVLYG3ijTcK7Q", "user_id": "sqMMZWSWFvm55ifwdBwCXw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "OMG!!!

Nice art. Enjoyable music. Small portions that do not seemed to be justified by their price. I paid $11 for a plate of gomen. I was underwhelmed by the flavor and a little exasperated by the cost. I love Ethiopian food. I have ordered gomen from other Ethiopian restaurants, with similar price points, and have received much heartier portions. Half the plate had food on it. The other half was empty."}, {"review_id": "wXDPSWiV7UVrndentfYI7Q", "user_id": "DiEm_wdI577TC5VsERfjgQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/9/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We just keep coming back for more!Just one of my favorite restaurants in the Springs. Maya and Nails are just super welcoming hosts. They always greet us with a smile and remember us and make us feel at home. The food is always on point and we just let Naila choose for us. We just mention what kind of protein we'd like and she just fixes us the perfect platter to share amongst friends. This place is so convivial it reminds me of Italian Restaurants back home (Italy) where it's all about gathering around some food with good company and not so much about hurrying to get a meal down and leave.Just try their Rose water lemonade and Orange Blossom Tea if they haven't already run out...they are THAT good and THAT popular!"}, {"review_id": "6SOOy_hFvgx8QSv8tSULoA", "user_id": "SWSReEhANtyUOLqDgudalg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I don't at all understand the great reviews this place has received.

I came here with no expectations but sheer curiosity, and we received only the warmest reception and service from the owners! If you're after a fancy night out go elsewhere, the Broadmoor is not far! ;-) But if you are up for a homey, African-local, particularly uncommercialised dining experience, I'd highly recommend Uchenna! I love Ethiopian coffee and Uchenna does it as fantastic as I remember it to be!For food, we tried the lamb and seafood plates, I don't know how it compares with \"authentic Ethiopian food\" but for sure I enjoyed what I had -- it isn't \"untasty\" or \"bad food\" or \"bland\" -- especially as Asians who seldom enjoy anything without spices, this hit the spot for us just right. My husband who had Ethiopian food previously in other states did say the portions here are comparatively smaller but even so, we needed takeout boxes for our unfinished meals which says a ton about the portions!As for prices, it is what it is for Colorado Springs and Denver when it comes to the more \"exotic\" cuisine if you'd like. If you frequent Mediterranean, South Asian or Asian around here, the prices at Uchenna are pretty much comparative. So just come here with the right expectations and you'd have a blast of a night here as we did!"}, {"review_id": "syw8f8TAK2YmYd7csaiW4Q", "user_id": "RNYkikRFbf_pGd80zGWsdQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/10/2017", "text": "It's good.  It didn't \"wow\" me, but the food is good.  I just don't think I can get over eating with my hands and watching others do the same.  It's an interesting experience, but it's not one I intend to frequent.  If you're thinking about going, you should.  The food will not disappoint."}, {"review_id": "uzOuYQmXGbLHuX0_rX1s7w", "user_id": "ysFm5hb4-KiBZ94K2N-jbQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/24/2017", "text": "My wife and I love treating ourselves to delicious Ethiopian food, and our visit to Uchenna was definitely a treat.

I honestly felt frustrated when the bill came. $20 for a single person is far too much when I was ultimately served an unfulfilling, unsatisfying, and dull plate of mush. I have had some excellent Ethiopian food, and so I was confused as to how this place achieved such a high rating.
