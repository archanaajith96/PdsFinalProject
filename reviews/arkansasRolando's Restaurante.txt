I thoroughly enjoyed them, and I don't like rice and black beans.   They offered pickled onions and some cucumbers with the meal, also good. The waitstaff was knowledgeable and could answer any questions I had.  Guacamole and was served really innovative - order it and have fun!  Beautiful environment. One of the cleanest places I've been. They'd moved 3 months ago, but still not a speck of dust on any of the art or fixtures. Clean bathrooms - even the kick boards were clean - felt like I was at my mom's house."}, {"review_id": "NfnU5oY8IXZ2jUW-eYDHgg", "user_id": "8c3hbxVJsSX9hkMw3MbRBQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/26/2017", "text": "A very fine pan-Latin bistro serving an excellent, if limited menu. Friendly staff, inviting decor in their new digs, and a fine blend of flavors from Cuba, Mexico, and Argentina.The pork tamales were excellent, with carnitas in mole or mojo. The masa was fantastic, flavorful and light instead of the usual heavy, dense, and chalky masa that many places offer.The guacamole was very fresh and flavorful, if super mild. The chips with it were cold, tough, and a bit bland, though. Freshly fried chips would've been appreciated with such great guacamole. This disconnect was the cause of the missing star on my review.I didn't have the chance to try the queso flamado, but I wish I had. This is a hard-to-find dish and Rolando's is quite literally flaming, or at least the one delivered to a neighboring table was.All-in-all, well worth the visit and a fine representative of Fort Smith's exciting new downtown."}, {"review_id": "teKJiLarEjJvaEub5iQgVg", "user_id": "VLZcdoomaR3w9g3dfIMXuQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "He has the best Latin American food I have ever had the pleasure to eat. If you're looking for \"Mexican\", WRONG PLACE !!!. If you ARE looking for some of the BEST cuisine this city has to offer. I have never had a bad meal at Rolando's, just wish he would open a place out in East Fort Smith, on east, past I-540. Probably the best stretch of blacktop for restaurants and for shopping in general.But their(his) food is worth the 10 minute drive downtown. That's what I love about this city, you are just about 10 minutes from anywhere you need to go."}, {"review_id": "ILYd-E9KCbSrzbgzsiorUw", "user_id": "Q9a_jiBeTMyT3atmHOo82g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "What an excellent restaurant for downtown Fort Smith.

After getting the menu, and leading around, my wife and I weren't too impressed with the lack of options without tortillas. It didn't help the menu prices are higher than comparable Mexican restaurants in town. We hoped for more dishes with sauces, but only found soup. The chips were overly salted, the salsa was decent but not very seasoned. My wife ordered the Pollo Bohemio, and the chicken was dried out and overly oily. The rice and beans were unflavored, plain, and drizzled with an overly sweet mango sauce. I ordered the Popeye's burrito, and the tortilla was soft and mushy, the spinach was well cooked but oily. The best part of my meal was the pork, inside the burrito, but it was glued to the inside with melted cheddar cheese. Both plates were drizzled, pretentiously, with drops of sauces and some hot oil sauce. The restaurant's inside is nice place and the decor is fun. But, overall, we were not impressed - I've heard the restaurant was better at its old location, and I'm sorry to have missed out on the good food. I don't believe we'll be going back."}, {"review_id": "u-d0wv81AdrO7CI4Gt4ANA", "user_id": "IUsxPsqSgPgGYQyv2i4b5w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/17/2017", "text": "I've been to this restaurant twice since moving to Fort Smith and have been pleased both times. Went for lunch and had the special with a quesadilla and soup, and for dinner on another day and had the Lula's enchiladas. Both were very tasty. At lunch we didn't receive chips and salsa but at dinner I did..not sure if that is the norm. I really loved the bean/corn salsa...and maybe it was a good thing I didn't have it at lunch as I could have eaten just that. The margaritas were perfect and the food was good. My only complaint and it's hardly a complaint is that the hot sauces provided weren't my favorite. I wanted something with heat, but with good flavor and they didn't do the trick. Overall, I will be going back."}, {"review_id": "XpGdeabhkvFRYWBJ24GmvA", "user_id": "5L2o9oVcrEoaE76I-maskw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "The only reason I am giving two stars and not one is because the place was cute, the made the food pretty and even though not intentional they had a Southpark reminiscent mural.

My husband ordered a dairy free Cubano plate and when it came it had dairy on it. It took a while, my food got cold, for them to remake their food.

Josefina Tamales in chicken are amazing! My favorite is the tortilla soup. The first time I went, my server suggested I add rice and chicken to the soup. It's the only way I eat it now. I have tried soup from a bunch of places, this is in my top 2. The restaurant is beautiful! The windows downstairs is nice, but the upstairs is the best. It's in an old historical building. They have completely remodeled it. The upstairs has the bar, but also regular seating.  Great for a date night. It definitely feels like upscale dining. Other favorite items Rum cake- the menu says it's homemade. It's served warm and definitely taste homemade. Margaritas are really good as well."}, {"review_id": "06nBn7GfzlFP-Ym8NY5tgg", "user_id": "_Lm3ijYc6tJ0IFDhPjEPHw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/8/2017", "text": "While in town, some locals recommended this restaurant. As soon as I sat down, I wanted to leave due to the high prices. And as soon as I tasted the chewy tamales, I knew my instincts to leave were right. The high cost of my bill was made even more painful by the bland food. Even the chips and salsa weren't good. The chips had waaaaay too much salt on it. Salsas shouldn't be bland. To make the dining experience even worse, our waiter was very inattentive. Nothing was ever refilled promptly. It seemed like our whole meal was one long waiting game. It took forever for the checks to come out. I think we wasted 30 minutes just to get the checks, get it corrected, and actually pay. The locals really let me down with their recommendation."}, {"review_id": "az22neb-pnhWsQIWagMyVA", "user_id": "j5cdkWZEGMABTSOMucB0Gw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/14/2017", "text": "Excellent.

Friendly staff with good service. Never waited for drinks, beers, and our food came out a little too quick. I ate here for lunch during the week with a friend. We both ordered the Don Quixote burrito - he opted for pork while I went with chicken. We also ordered guacamole to start. This isn't your typical Tex-Mex place. It is more Latin America. Lots of dishes on the menu you will not find at any of those other run of the mill places. The guacamole was seasoned just right (I usually have to add a little salt). It comes in a bowl with large chips sticking out of it. This is an interesting way to serve it. You have to break up the chips and the bottom part of the chip is soggy.The burritos were large in size (I had to take half of mine to-go).  They were in a flour tortilla packed with blacked beans, rice, and the meat, then drizzled with white and red sauce. The burrito was $9.99 I believe ($7.99 without meat). There wasn't a lot of meat but it was tasty and different. No rice or beans on the side-- all on the inside :)"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/rolandos-restaurante-fort-smith?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
