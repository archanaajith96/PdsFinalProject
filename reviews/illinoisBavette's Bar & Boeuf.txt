Our server was great, but there really was a team that would come to refill our water glasses,change the flatware or clean off the table.EVERYTHING we ordered was delicious. We shared a wedge salad - best bacon I've ever tasted. I had the salmon and my bf ordered the petit filet mignot. Both were tender and seasoned perfectly.

I goofed and meant to make my reservation for my boyfriends birthday, it's tough to get a res here so I went through the Reserve app about 5 weeks in advance to score a Friday night res and all that was available was 5pm ( that's fine) and I thought I made it for his birthday but I made it for the following Friday, accidentally.  The day before I was thinking, I should get a confirmation email or call and when I didn't hear anything I double checked my res and realized my mistake. I reached out via email to Bavettes, explained my mistake and was there any suggestions how the best way was to get a walk in table as I've always heard this place is tough to grab a seat. I received a response the following day that they had canceled the wrong reservation and had taken care of making the res for the night I needed, this was the day of and I was so grateful. I thought, wow, that was a real awesome way to start.  So grateful they worked with me and fixed MY goof. On to the experience, the restaurant itself is gorgeous, classy, swanky, dark and just all around my kind of steak place. The music is perfect the lighting is dark but once your eyes adjust, perfect as well. I'm already digging the vibe & the evening gets even better when our server John introduces himself, walks us through what Bavettes is about, specials and a few suggestions for us to ponder. We immediately took to John, how could you not? this guy is great, I can't even do him justice saying he provided the best service I have ever had anywhere. I still feel like that's not saying enough.I started w/ a dirty martini and I explained I like it filthy dirty and he brings my dirty martini with a side of olive juice in case it's not dirty enough. I've been to some nice places and I've never had anyone do that. Already dig him. He knows the menu through and through and I enjoyed how he was real about how much food you get, he explained that the sides are big and too keep that in mind since we had bread coming,  oysters on the way followed by, per his suggestion that we were both going w/ the bone in filet. He could have let us order away, having too much food but he explained there was going to be a birthday surprise as well, to save room for and to keep  in mind. So great! I usually get a petite filet but he said their bone in filet was his favorite and he preferred it over the bone in rib eye which was the direction my boyfriend was headed until he told us the bone in  filet was out of this world, he wasn't wrong. This was the best steak I have ever had. Perfectly cooked to my medium rare plus request. I had the roasted garlic on mine and the BF had the bone marrow on his, we were both in steak heaven w/ our orders. There is also a fab fancy salt and pepper mix they bring to the table. I thought the addition of the pinch of that, put it over the top, I ate the whole thing and it was probably almost twice as big as the petite I usually get when I go to a steak joint! I felt glutinous but loved every bite. We had the truffle Mac as a side, very good but I left that mostly to my BF as I was too into my meat. John meanwhile, was spot on w/ the wine pairings for our steak and gave us a mini wine tasting so we would have the absolute perfect match with our steak, and this place was buzzin, he never made us feel like he was rushed or too busy and he was slammed but handled it all so well. I only say this  because I work in the service industry and take notice of things like that, he really is a natural at what he does and what he does is make you feel like you are the only guests in an extremely busy restaurant! Way to go John!!  I saw so many more things on that menu I need to try and I just so happen to have moved across the block from Bavettes, they're going to get sick of me!   To conclude, John brought out the most amazing salted caramel ice cream birthday surprise for the birthday boy and just like everything else that 100% hit the mark, salted caramel  anything is my boyfriend's absolute favorite,  luck would have it that's what we were given and it was the best salted caramel ice cream I've ever had, I would go back and get that again. John also suggested a perfect and different kind of port, the name escapes me. Great night!! I loved my evening there so much and my BF who was tired and a little apprehensive of a fancy night out, said within 15 minutes of us being seated, he was so glad we came. He agrees, and we have hit all the biggies in the city, Gibson's, Maple & Ash, Chicago Cut and Swift and Sons ( which we both love) but Bavettes actually left all of them including S&S and CC in the dust. I love you Bavettes!! Get ready to see me lots!!"}, {"review_id": "fRb3l3jgpbU1kW2b6jT4MQ", "user_id": "meIimWr8fIFePSIBc2cGVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Chicago never disappoints on the food front.

My intention was to try a little bit but ended up eating the whole slice. Huge stuffed avocado salad. Refreshing with the bib lettuce. Get the dry aged ribeye. First bite was like heaven.

It was just the right amount of cheese and dressing. Our steaks were cooked to perfection.

I was visiting Chicago for a weekend and decided to make a reservation here even though a location just opened up in my hometown of Las Vegas. We started out by waiting at the bar for a martini which was made perfectly!! As we were having a drink the hostess came and found us to seat us to our table. Our waitress was extremely friendly and very helpful in making our perfect menu choices. My husband and I started with the fantastic seafood tower for $125 which could have been good for an entire meal or a great appetizer for 4-5 people. We then had the thick cut bacon and tomato salad which was so tasty along with the bone in rib eye steak. Everything was superb and the service made it an even better experience. The thick sliced bread was also delicious. I hope the one in Vegas has this type of service along with the delicious food.

As soon as you walk in, you're surrounded with dark wooden walls, chandeliers and big leather chairs. We had reservations for 830 pm but we got there at 730 pm thinking we'd wait but we were seated immediately. Staff was nice, attentive to us and to the tiny details of our needs and they made excellent recommendations. We started with the Roasted Bone Marrow to share and I've never had bone Marrow like that before. We spread it on the bread like butter and topped with the caramelized onions and parsley leaves. The combination just felt like pure decadence! You taste the creaminess of the bone marrow absorbing onto the bread and the onions add a hint of sweetness that just made the combination work. I wasn't sure if the parsley was just there for garnish but that helped balance the richness of the bone marrow. We all ended up getting the dry-aged ribeye cooked at varying degrees. I ended up getting mine medium well. The steak was cooked to perfection. It was tender and flavorful. I added the seasoned salt on top and it pulled additional flavors from the steak as well. For sides we had the fries with garlic aoli (so addicting), the Brussels sprouts, creamed spinach and the truffle Mac and cheese topped with bacon. The truffle Mac was by far the best Mac N Cheese I've ever had and it was the highlight of my meal there. Definitely recommend it; you will not be disappointed!"}, {"review_id": "uZjOj7rrpFYpIjOy037lrA", "user_id": "qayAHD5or8w6IuF_H_oocw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "Hands down... Bavette's is one of THE BEST restaurant for date night. The lighting is just enough -- not so dark that you couldn't see anything at all, and it's dim enough that you can feel the romantic atmosphere everywhere. Plus the background music choice is amazing. The jazz music gives just  the right vibe. You can choose this for your special celebration as well. I think the table next to us is celebrating birthday. And the waiter presents them with an ice cream with a firecracker on top. You can clearly see the smile on their face. Now back to the food...The bread is amazing!!! It's actually the best sourdough I've ever found in Chicago. The crust is crispy but not hard. And the bread itself is a perfect balance between chewy and moist. I even ask our waiter tonight to help me pack some bread home. Our waiter is just so nice hahahah. We start our night by sharing the crab cake. It's easily my favorite dish tonight. You can seriously taste the REAL crab meat in it. And the sauce pairs perfectly with the crab cake. Too bad there's only one piece lol. Moving on to the entree, supposedly the highlight of the night, but my most disappointed part as well. I order petite fillet mignon, cooked to be medium rare. And my boyfriend asks for ribeye cooked to be medium well. The first thing I notice is that the plate is NOT HOT... at most Luke-warm, which is defiant something I expect to see at a restaurant of this price range. And then the steak... I don't even know where to begin. Even under the dim light, I can tell that my steak is over-cooked, resulting in a nearly rubbery taste. And the steak is really blaaaaaaaaaaand. Yes, they do offer steak seasoning, but I thought they would add salt when cooking the steak.Putting the steak aside, the peach sorbet is a great finish for the night. It's so perfectly smooth that I couldn't even believe it's not ice cream. And it's not overly sweet, I can really taste the peach flavor, which is a huge plus for the dessert!Oh and don't forget the drink menu. I try the Pago Pago, which has rum as base, and mixes with pineapple and green chartreuse. It's the first time I've ever tried this. And I'll definitely order this every time I see it on the menu from now on. In one word, if not for the steak, I'll give the restaurant 7 stars for its atmosphere, the bread, the appetizer, and the dessert. BHT (-2) stars for the steak. As a steakhouse, I wish they could at least do the steak a justice."}, {"review_id": "1Ug-7JgovU-SEObQi80xJw", "user_id": "MO3LMWe_h7SrR8aTm9xuww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Everyone says this is a must try spot but I'm always going to Maple and Ash when I want a steak.

Our waiter was very attentive and provided us with answers to any and all questions we had. I'm a big bourbon guy so the Old Fashion is what I ordered to start off, it was fantastic and definitely on par with some of the best in the city. Our appetizer was a shrimp and bread dish (I'm blanking on the name) that was very flavorful and was an excellent starter to a much larger meal. I ordered the dry-age NY Strip cooked Medium-rare and it came out perfectly cooked with our accompanying sides of fries and Mac and cheese.Multiple rounds of drinks later we ended with a dessert on the house for the special occasion we were celebrating.

It was crisp and absolutely delicious.The arrival of pearl-handle steak knives heralded our entrée.  We splurged on the 22 oz. bone-in ribeye, dry-aged for 42 days.  Ordered medium-rare, this impressive slab initially arrived at our table so undercooked that I thought I heard a mooing sound.  But after a quick trip back to the broiler, it was sheer perfection.   A pinch or two of the accompanying salt blend further enhanced every delectable bite and made the béarnaise superfluous.  Our one side dish, pommes frites, was not shoestrings but an ample portion of thick-cut, greaseless fries with a ramekin of silky garlic aioli.Our desserts did not quite match the caliber of the preceding courses.  My lemon meringue pie had the flavor and consistency of a decent key lime pie, its tart custard offset by a laughable skyscraper of sweet white fluff.  Not a home run but surely a base hit.  My Missus enjoyed ice cream with a pot of decadent hot fudge, and we both indulged in French press coffee.  Our only quibble was receiving salad-size plates to share our entrée and side.  Apart from that, attention to detail was impeccable.  We were celebrating our anniversary and the server brought us each a complimentary glass of champagne; our desserts arrived amid a blaze of sparklers.  It was great fun to observe diners at nearby tables gaping in awe at their supersized seafood towers.  The contemporary smooth jazz soundtrack was elegant and did not intrude on conversation.  We can't wait to return."}, {"review_id": "SRjBOZr5QZVgtMUp_9r0KQ", "user_id": "WTiHNJCOOGI_NvYrHa2RyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "I really can't think of anything missing from my experience at Bavette's.

He ordered the chicken pot pie and I got the petite 6oz filet mignon. At $18 the chicken pot pie was really worth--it was generously portioned, rested on a ring of buttery, delicious mashed potatoes and was jam packed with filling. Though Bavette's is known for their steaks, I wouldn't mind coming back for any of their other special entrees. We also ordered 2 sides--the truffle mac and cheese and elote corn. Ugh, both of them so delicious.Side note, very much appreciated how Bavette's added a tomato and some arugula with my 6oz steak as dressing to the plate.
