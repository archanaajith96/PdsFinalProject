The food is fresh and only with quality produces. Chef Rene takes pride in his food and is always inspired in the kitchen.  Will recommend it to all my friends you have a hidden gem right in your backyard.  By the way the drinks are superb most try the mojitos and House special cocktails!!"}, {"review_id": "caFJGrqsn5HV2s6it28_Vg", "user_id": "iVw9RmKzlfgOnBlOwwVrzQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Ola is fresh, fun, with attentive service and a well prepared, creative cuisine.We were there to celebrate Quatro de Mayo, an important day set aside to revel in Friday and payday.  Ola was into it - the bar was filled with very happy patrons loudly celebrating freedom from their overlords.Ola has an extensive cocktail menu featuring martinis, mojitos and margaritas. My classic mojito had a sugar cane stick with mucho chopped mint, and don't mind me if ramble because I had two. My patacones, plantain toasts filled with pulled pork and arugula, were well prepared. I ordered the baby octopus/potato tapas with trepidation because these Cephalopoda are intelligent sentient beings. Those served were not thumb sized newborns as advertised, but larger slices of a more teenagery-adult. The dish was well seasoned with pieces of roasted red pepper and served with a separate dipping sauce. Remind me to watch fewer nature documentaries. We were the only diners as it was 5 o'clock-ish. Listening to the bar talk  reminded us of the importance of celebrating life with vigor. Just wish they had better acoustics for us diners."}, {"review_id": "S8jRWgzeFl7y8hBCCl_RYA", "user_id": "89fOI7m93oAs92_mNhWY0w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Food was delicious. Very romantic ambiance if you're looking to go out on a date night. The shrimp ceviche was one of the best I've ever had. Very good portion. It was the first time I order patacones and I'm glad I did, it was amazing. Our waitress was super attentive. The price wasn't that bad. The only down side was that the steak my husband ordered was burnt on the outside but still cooked medium on the inside.

Tapas and house drinks are SIX DOLLARS. We were immediately greeted at the door, and sat at the bar, where the bartender quickly tended to our needs. Love that the bartender is a WOMAN and runs the ship BY HERSELF efficiently and with a smile. We were served bread and sun-dried tomato oil which is DIVINE. We ordered margaritas (blackberry and classic) which were STRONG but in a good way. We also ordered the Flatbread, Pinchos, and Empandas de Carne. Each plate was absolutely delicious and the meat was tender and flavorful AF. The Ola's Exotic Bomba (a white chocolate glazed sorbet) finished off our meal. Exceptional! We will definitely return soon! You get your money's worth here. Happy Hour is everyday 4-6pm, except holidays."}, {"review_id": "2kp-_LNAqyo1rUzesGZUig", "user_id": "7we5gLnqj9MSUX5cAK_6lg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/6/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I come here for the awesome deals during happy hour. I love the mojitos and the price but nothing is worth the bad customer service we received the last time I was here with my girlfriends and fiancé. I was hanging with my friends eating appetizers and drinking before my fiancé joined us. He ordered a drink on a separate tab from us then asked for bread. The female bartender told him that he would be charged 50 cents per roll unless he ordered food too. My fiancé was confused because we come for happy hour all of the time and always received bread-- even when we hadn't yet ordered food. He told her this and she said \"Restaurants change,\" pretty rudely.Then we saw a server come out and hand another person bread and they didn't have any food... only drinks. He pointed that out and the bartender said \"Its only fifty cents.\" Like, seriously? Then my friend asked for another piece of bread and the bartender said it would be an extra charge if she gave it to my fiancé. The whole situation was comical and weird but she was dead serious. It was really uncomfortable to watch her interacting with him. Mind you, we weren't being rude or loud or obnoxious. We are regular paying customers ... it wasn't about the 50 cents, it was about her rudeness and quite honestly, the inconsistency of the restaurant staff. We won't be back. My fiancé told her this and she replied with, \"That's fine.\""}, {"review_id": "_3keCwNQ1HGOMSfaNGXMzg", "user_id": "k-cxQJXdHpVZs02ECf5tJQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "This was our third dinner at Ola.  Each time was better than the last.  We were a party of 10 on a crowded Saturday night and the execution was flawless.  We shared appetizers including table-side prepared guacamole and Tuna Tatar, which was excellent.  I would pass on the fried calamari next time though.  I had the grilled Mahi special on spinach and with beans and chirizo which was delicious and my wife had the star of the evening, pallela.  The pallela was full of fresh sea food, the rice was tender and moist and it was presented beautifully.  Others at the table enjoyed all their dishes.  Our waiter was great and the staff overall was very attentive.  We will certainly go back."}, {"review_id": "KXPrzRBun9oCPbRKFqHpoQ", "user_id": "KMi0ac4RBfbWldT974DDiA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/21/2017", "text": "Great fresh food served quickly by people with a smile.

I'm not sure if the lobster was not fresh or something, but it literally smelled and tasted funky. But over all we had a great experience.

However, I'd say it's overpriced. Both of the meals pictured were $28 each. The bartender is great. I would of given at least 4 stars (maybe 5) but I was really put off regarding a Groupon situation. Long story short, I bought a Groupon for $50 worth of food (paid $35 for it). I read all the small print and understood it could not be used during happy hour or many (many) other restrictions. My major gripe is I sat at the bar during happy hour. We had 3 HH drinks and 2 apps. We ALSO had 2 FULL PRICED entrees and a specialty coffee. So that's so that is $67 worth of FULL PRICED food. I told he it's like I was being penalized for adding happy hour items to my bill! They would not even entertain using my Groupon. This actually happened to me a few months ago but I didn't fight it. This time I did and was infuriated that they refused to even see my point! They claim you cannot sit at the bar during happy hour and use a Groupon. Even if I were to break check with friend NO. So they gave me a choice of either pricing my HH items out full and using the $50 value or just using the $35 face value I paid for the Groupon. I chose the latter and will not be back. Don't do something like Groupon if you make it so difficult to redeem!"}, {"review_id": "60uaxSYy9gO28QNEFb3Abw", "user_id": "Ed9QtWhN3jDFKJux_lGxZg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "My first experience at Ola was, overall, a pleasant experience. I made a reservation for 6:30 pm on a Saturday night for 9 people and we were seated on time with no problems. The restaurant was fairly busy when we arrived resulting in an energetic, but also a loud atmosphere. I did not order a drink, but everyone in my party ordered margaritas. The wait staff was attentive and timely. I tried my wife's margarita in which she ordered jalapeno and pineapple. I am not sure if that is a typical combination, but it was tasty and you felt it go all the way down (if you like that kind of thing). We went straight from drinks to ordering dinner. My wife and I split three apps for dinner - Quesadilla De Vegetales, Picadera Latina, and Huaraches. The Picadera Latina was chicken chicharrones, smoked chorizo, tostones, yucca fries, cilantro aioli, and chipotle sauce. I do not think I would get that again. The cilantro aioli was more mayonnaise than anything else and the chicken chicharrones were quite dry and tasteless. The Huaraches came as three \"crispy corn patties with roasted vegetables, caramelized onions, goat cheese & balsamic reduction on top. That was probably the best of the three. The other members of my party ordered a variety of dishes and everyone seemed pleased. As I have said in other posts, the best wait staff (in my opinion) are those that you do not remember. That was the case here. Again, they were attentive, prompt and made the dinner a seamless experience. They were aware when we needed more drinks, and kept the water glasses full (which is important to me). Overall, I would go back, but I would probably try one of the main courses. It is also worth mentioning that I regretted not getting a dessert. As we were paying the bill, we saw a couple dessert plates go to another table. They looked amazing."}, {"review_id": "OigQfNrCqJn_Pduy_mMvZA", "user_id": "jFMQSjP9Y7vjr2aM8YHvpg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/13/2017", "text": "favorite happy hour! good food and drinks and Monica is the best bartender!

Had seen a bunch of great reviews so I will add to them ~ pleasant atmosphere, not terribly crowded; we were seated immediately and offered cocktails. Hubby opted for beer but I tried a coconut caipiranha, which was refreshing and interesting. Selected octopus/artichoke appetizer, and WOW...one of the best dishes I have ever eaten! I actually asked the chef (who came around later) for the recipe. Husband ordered pork shank and I elected the paella, which had an enormous quantity of seafood. Both were excellent, and portions quite generous. Although we decided not to get dessert, a complimentary glass of peach-infused champagne was brought to us, which was a surprise and delight!
