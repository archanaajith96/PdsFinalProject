First issue is parking. I was duped thinking I could park in their lot only to realize you pull in and you have to back out to exit. A bit weird. Once parked in the street the wait inside is crazy. Its way smaller than I imagined.  It's just s big house with tables which means long waits and not really anywhere to stand inside without getting told I'm causing a fire escape hazard. You can wait outside but in winter even the covered heated space gets packed. I had a beer and some appetizers. By the time we got seated I wasn't feeling like vodka anymore. Solid apps but classic bar food greasy and heavy. I wasn't expecting gastropub but it was a bit much for me.  Best thing was the bacon cheese cracks - better than cheese curds in my opinionSolid joint and Wisconsin bar if you can tolerate small spaces."}, {"review_id": "kB9kK9hY7mtd2YPjsIuuog", "user_id": "Nrss0KsMwwItRHvP2-aveg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "I've always went to the Sobleman's Pub & Grill at Marquette's campus. I love that spot because MU it is near and dear to my heart. I finally got the opportunity to go to the OG sobes and was happy with the service, space, burgers and overall environment. If you're looking for a delicious burger, go here. If you're looking for cheap drinks, go here. They have sports games playing 24/7 and pull tabs if you're feeling lucky. There is something or everyone on the menu, even if you're a vegetarian! So good.

I ordered The Bomb and it was just as cheesy and delicious as I'd hoped. Although I didn't try one of their famous bloody mary's, I'll pass along my friend's review of her \"Crown Mary\" which was, \"the most freaking impressive bloody [she'd] ever seen, and definitely a 10/10 on the taste scale\". The wait staff also presented a child at the table next to us with a birthday chicken nugget while we were eating lunch. I'm not sure if that's a Sobelman's thing or simply a child making strange childish requests, but it's the first time I've ever seen a birthday candle in a chicken nugget and I loved it."}, {"review_id": "t08Gx_-10dC1B23CjwneJA", "user_id": "OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/4/2017", "text": "My bae and I were in town for a wedding and wanted to get some killer Bloody Mary's. After seeing other Yelp reviews we knew this was the place. It was pretty small inside and had a renovated house type feel. Luckily we came on a weekday so we easily found parking and a table. For bloodys we went with the classic which was topped with all kinds of goodness like cheese, salami, olives and even a shrimp. I think I should have kept with just the bloody because the food was kind of disappointing. We shared the Loser Burger which was topped with the usual toppings. (3.5/5) It was good, but nothing special. We also shared some cheese curds. (1/5) I wanted so much for them to be good, but they just tasted super frozen and bland. I also hated that the ranch they provided us with was just standard hidden valley. Come on, try a little harder here. I'm glad we tried the bloodys, but can't recommend anything else."}, {"review_id": "BMDQACoNv-pHNdKoXstUZw", "user_id": "tfLA8WgftF0skR7skllD0w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "Tourist trap.  The burgers are not great or bad.  Just another burger.  Apparently famous for the large alcoholic containers in which drinks are served.  Not really my prefer but I get it.  If reading reviews correlate the pictures and put into perspective your expectations.  This is NOT a place to head to if you are feeling a craving for a burger and meal.  This is a place you head to for the experience and environment.  Not from town so hit it up once.  It is what it is."}, {"review_id": "P4m_tVl3-yDUPOAhoDZOvQ", "user_id": "CzLa5u99PglWXCebUtzhAQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "How can you say anything negative about Sobelman's? Their burgers taste great and the owners and their staff are fantastic. OK I can think of one negative and that is they get way too many customers when I want to eat there and I usually have to wait for a seat. And yes you can blame Sobelman's for this problem because if they didn't have such a fantastic tasting burger (blue cheese burger is my favorite) and such great service, then I might be able to get a seat when I want one. Yes many people know them for their great Bloody Mary concoctions... but I know them because they have great tasting menu items.

I never turn down a good Bloody Mary and the lineup you'll find at sobelmans is GREAT! You can even order a Bloody Mary with an entire chicken on top if that's up your alley (and wallet considering the $60 price tag) - But for us (more) normal folks you can order your Bloody with a variety of pickled snacks, cheese, bacon wrapped cheese balls and a slider for a much more reasonable price. The rest of the food my party ordered was also tasty, a burger and  a sandwich.
