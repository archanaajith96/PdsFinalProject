The Pork Belly Reuben was phenomenal. The meat was super juicy, bread perfectly toasted and the krout was great. This sandwich is a hearty portion, ended up taking half with us home. Also had the sweet potato tots; quite yummy and unique. My wife had the vegan tacos. Normally, I avoid such things like the plague but these were actually super tasty."}, {"review_id": "cyYNhRH7X_4fWFFJ_9_Dkw", "user_id": "KrS0G2pXo4L9Q-xov36xgg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "This seems to be the place my boyfriend likes to take his relatives when they are visiting from out of town. And when we come, I've enjoyed ordering the Tabasco Chicken dish. I've had it several times and it has been consistently good. I've also had the best Bloody Mary I've ever had here. However, I have had other items that were not great, like a very dry turkey sandwich and bland appetizers.While this doesn't affect my rating, as a designer I have to say it. The lighting fixtures are absolutely horrendous and don't suit the space or the age of the building. It really cheapens the vibe in there. Every time I walk in, I ask myself, \"Why??!\""}, {"review_id": "4qeN3tWTym1dZSELJGdrHQ", "user_id": "7wKkeTAKjqQT-9Qof4iLpQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/5/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "It has been almost 3 years since I've been to Phantom. I wanted to see if they had improved since my last visit, sad to say that they haven't. I had a craving for calamari and I remember theirs to be amongst the best when I used to frequent this bar. I ordered a batch to go but was a little shocked when my total came to $12. I remember it being somewhere around $9 but that was maybe 4 years ago. I convinced myself that it's because of inflation and no matter, it would be worth it. I had an appointment coming up and was planning on snacking in my car before I had to go. I opened the container and said out loud, \"You're kidding right?\" There was literally a small handful of  calamari. It looked *nothing* like what they used to serve (refer to other yelpers older pics of their calamari). I picked one up, bit into it, realized it was a fried rubber band and put it back in the box. Even if food is not that great I will eat it and move along. I have never asked for a refund until now. I brought it back in and requested one.The hostess was the only saving grace. She was friendly, understanding, professional and quick to remedy. The only reason for 2 stars instead of 1. I wouldn't have cared about the price if it was the quality I remember but, at the same time, you can go anywhere and pay $12 for a whole plate of the stuff which I guess is what I'll be doing from now on. I tried, I really did, but never again."}, {"review_id": "zApsrE7ePBxzTw4dTOL__A", "user_id": "v25g6pJUQzqhFIeNTIycWw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "We came in for drinks and a bite.  The service was on point.  We sat at the bar and they were quick and efficient.  We had a drink and ordered the pretzel app.  That was the best pretzel we've ever had - plus that cheese dip!

We came in at noon and were promptly seated, but our server was a little late to the party.  When he arrived, he got right down to business without introducing himself. Of course, by the time he greeted us, we we're ready to order. We started with the pimento sliders which were perfectly cooked, served on these perfectly toasted buns with pimento cheese and a fried pickle on top. That fried pickle was sooooo good. Can I have like 15 more, please?  I think the burger was cooked more on the medium well side, so it was still nice and juicy!  My aunt ordered the shepherds pie, which I had heard was delicious!!  I'm here to tell ya, I heard right. Dang that's good and that rosemary on top. Mmm. Voila!I, myself, was lost on the menu. I wanted to try everything!! Truth be told, I had been thinking about that Reuben for a month, but now the Cubano and the PB&J Burger were in the running. I asked the server and he steered me in my original direction, to the Reuben. Sweet reassurance!!  Dang that Reuben was amazing!!!!  So many delicious flavors all wrapped up into one large sandwich, each packing a delicious punch. As much as I wanted to eat the whole dang thang, I decided to take half of it home and have it for breakfast with an egg... because that's my jam. Anything with an egg. I digress. The \"crispy\" brussel sprouts were my chosen side. They were served barely warm, lacking seasoning and definitely not crispy. When the server, who did perk up and become quite personable after the appetizer, checked on us, I mentioned the lack of warmth and crisp to the sprouts. He took them from my plate and brought them to the back to have them microwaved, only solving one issue. I can season these and put an egg on them too. I'd definitely recommend this place and I hope I can make it back soon to try the dishes listed above. Yum!I'm still dreaming of that fried pickle."}, {"review_id": "YltmwngqtRziq1RoKHjEPg", "user_id": "LC_o79IQTseA2Qi41v_rMg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "The name alone is intriguing but the menu items and positive reviews caught my attention. We called in our lunch order as the little one fell asleep in the car so we planned to munch on-the-go. Service only took 10 minutes which was prompt. I ordered the grilled chicken with lemon Tabasco accompanied by mashed potatoes and broccolini. The lemon Tabasco sauce was unlike anything I've ever tasted - a party for my tastebuds! What a great concept that partnered perfectly with chicken. My husband enjoyed his Cuban Cristo sandwich which he described as a crispy exterior with moist and tender pork interior with savory ham, mustard and chilled pickles. Sorry, no food photos as we were starving! Definitely a great, reliable place to dine."}, {"review_id": "w2IB_N0A_IOfRqX8zShCKw", "user_id": "P5cWLGzcdRbzyB5xhuK4zA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Our waiter at lunch, Keith, was excellent.

They did have a great selection of beer and we each got a flight. The charcuterie was just average - but maybe because we were comparing it to the one we had 10 years ago which had boar, venison, and buffalo (all locally procured meats) and last night was \"just\" three different salamis. The cheeses were ones you could get anywhere and the mustards were actually the highlight of the board (the best one was the berry infused whole grain mustard). We had intended to get dinner, but never did - nothing on the menu called to us. Great for large groups and they had big communal tables, great for an after work hang out."}, {"review_id": "ZSA3k6PluuE7dHxTvAwibg", "user_id": "4aN9PcPSTnAdxlfrNXxupw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Myself and a group of friends eat here once a week!

You can actually do 4 sample flights for 8 dollars to see what you like...and there is a lot to like from light to dark....fruity to stout they have it all to taste.Food is good: We had the BBQ Pulled Pork Potato Skins (Smoked pulled pork, phantom bbq, white cheddar cheese, scallions, ranch dressing) which was great paired with their beers.  We also split the  Colorado Bison patty melt (boxcar ale caramelized onions, swiss, 1000 island, marble rye) with fries it was ahmazzing...get it it is really good.Service is fantastic. Our server was patient and always attentive. He gave great recommendations and paced our experience perfectly.Vibe is fantastic as you would expect from the Rocky Mountain state....people are all very chill and having a great time.... and it is infectious as we loved the people watching.I will definitely come back when in Colorado Springs"}, {"review_id": "Z-ZZ0L28z6W9PPmuzePx8g", "user_id": "t10CbddzoQ8KCzDKPkwoWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "We were only in town for a couple days, and I'm so happy we decided on Phantom out of the many options in the area.

I'm not normally one to make a habit of mixing salty and sweet but this burger was delicious! With a couple strips of crispy bacon....so mouth wateringly delightful. My girl had the buffalo patty melt which was also very tasty. You don't go to a brewery without having a brew and on this brewery stop I had their take on a Scottish ale. Very smooth and refreshing. My girl had the flagship amber.... We both agreed it wasn't as good as my selection. Our waiter was pretty attentive and helpful with suggestions. Would we go back?
