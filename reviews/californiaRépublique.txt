The line was out the door when we arrived, but it went by fairly quickly. We looked at pastries, ordered our food at the counter, and found ourselves a seat.I ordered the Regular Breakfast (with egg whites) and a Vietnamese Latte. It was a little pricey for the two items, but definitely worth every bite and sip. The warm baguette tasted amazing with butter and raspberry jam, while the fingerling potatoes were well-seasoned and bursting with flavor. I took the bacon steak home for my bf because it looked a little too greasy and fat for me. Vietnamese latte was absolutely delicious! It was just so smooth and easy to drink.Overall, I really enjoyed Republique and would consider this one of my favorite brunch place in LA. Highly recommend!"}, {"review_id": "Fe9tnjB_ZcFu3TPehI9c7A", "user_id": "Jkfc1popJyynocprpsBD1g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Great experience and definitely a place we would go back. Delicious pastries. Great cocktails and savory dishes. Papusa - black bean corn flour papusa with fresh avocado and fried egg. Perfect blend. Not greasy one bit. If you like papusa and beans, definitely gotta try this dish. French toast - soft, thick with an accent of almond flavor. One of the best French toast I've had.Mushroom toast- mushroom in hollandaise sauce with cure ham. Taste just explodes in your mouth. Boston cream donut- It was excellent and not overly sweet. Bloody Mary- generous with horseradish. It's a hip and trendy spot. Full bar. Community table seating. Prepare to line up for brunch.

Others you have to eat there but I wanted to eat every single dessert I saw. The hazelnut cream puff was my favorite and so aesthetically pleasing. Even now I crave the sweet delicious from hundreds of miles away. The bombolinis are nice too! I got the  s'mores and crème brulee ones and also that passionfruit cake was lit! It might be a crime to leave without dessert.Brunch wasn't bad and came out in nice portions. We got the chia seed pudding, shakshuka and pupusas. Chia seed pudding was my favorite because the other dishes were kind of bland for me, but still pretty.Decor inside is very cute!Will likely come back for more dessert and hazelnut cream puffs!"}, {"review_id": "lAa6GX0nQ9YDA_0eXxz1WQ", "user_id": "xuvCrJpBHLuJfqOG0omVMA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "This place did not disappoint.  This restaurant was visually stunning with an incredible ambiance. It is important to note it's not a traditional restaurant. You wait in line to order then seat yourself. There are also complimentary glass water bottles for your table. We had a party of 7 and had the croque madame, chicken and waffles, mushroom omelette, traditional breakfast and the chorizo sopes. We also had the sticky bomb and an assortment of bambolinis. Everything was fantastic with wonderful flavor and just enough nuance to elevate the dish without making it too weird. The sticky bomb was delicious. Everything was so good. I think the croque madame was the best though. Aside from the food, the staff was great too. We were greeted by Stephen (maybe Stewart?) and he was awesome. Very helpful and very friendly. As a tourist, I think this is a must stop. We were there before 9 and there was a minimal wait. After 9 there was a pretty big line.

Went yesterday with some girlfriends for Sunday brunch. Line was out the door but it moved surprisingly fast. Order at front, find a table, they deliver your food to you. Ordered the regular breakfast, chia seed pudding, Belgian waffle, ricotta toast - all of which were delicious!The Belgian waffle was super light with just the right amount of sweetness, topped with fresh fruits. The batter was light and I did not feel super full with a food coma afterward.Friend ordered regular breakfast - I loved the potatoes as they were bursting with flavor, the bacon steak was fatty and juicy and perfectly seasoned.Other friend ordered and shared the chia seed pudding - the coconut cream made it oh so tasty, I could get enough! Just the right amount of sweetness. Portion sizes were on the smaller side for the prices paid, but I would consider this place higher priced than places elsewhere. Still a great experience though - ambience and dining area is great, bathrooms are clean.

You most likely have seen the crowded line out the door outside as you drive through La Brea, and with good reason. The atmosphere is modern, seating inside is very open and well lit with natural lighting/high ceilings, and food is visually colorful, aesthetically pleasing (for the IG!), and delicious if you are willing to pay the price. If you're okay waiting 30 minutes on a Saturday (basically the wait anywhere for weekend brunch around noon), don't be too discouraged by the line out the door. The line moves pretty efficiently thanks to the quick order-takers in the front, and the workers who bus the tables super fast inside. (Just as a side note, please don't be one of those people who saves a table as your friends wait in the back of the line. There WILL be spots for you once you get to the front, and you will be preventing people who just paid and ordered to get a table!)The menu you can grab while you wait is full of choices for everyone: juice, coffee, smoothies, and a large assortment of hearty brunch items. Drinks can get pretty pricey from about $4-8, and a brunch plate averages around $15-20. I ended up opting for the Citrus Ginger Smoothie ($8) and Croque Madame ($16) which set me back almost $30 with tip and tax. Though it was kind of pricey, I thought the food was top quality and delicious. My smoothie was a pretty good size and tasted sweet and fresh with pineapple and apples. The spicy kick in the back of my throat from the ginger was just the thing I needed! The Croque Madame sandwich was awesome. The bread was nice and crispy throughout both sides and was stable enough to hold all of the ingredients. In fact, the brown crisp they achieved kept me coming for more not only from the texture, but the slight burnt flavor that surprisingly added to the taste in a good way. The cured ham and gruyere cheese were salty and delicious, and the runny egg was the perfect addition to make this more decadent. I also liked the lightly tossed salad on the side just for something fresh. Overall, I really enjoyed this restaurant. Next to Blu Jam, it makes it as one of top brunch places for me in LA. Yes it is pricey, but it's one of the places I really love what I'm getting in exchange in terms of atmosphere, high quality ingredients, and aesthetically pleasing well-seasoned food. And I love watching everyone around baking bread. I would definitely come again!"}, {"review_id": "VT5vl7lfEjONWzBrB0XaGA", "user_id": "KL9E6DK2Ir0da90Vq1XPAg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We went for brunch on a Saturday morning and we easily found parking on the street not too far away which was nice! There seemed to be a lot of parking options. First getting into the line, it was clear this place really has a lot of hype! Cars driving by were slowing while passing I'm assuming because they're checking out how busy it is since they're planning to go there or just seeing why there's so many people in a while outside! We waited in line for maybe 15 or 20 minutes? It was all our first time so we didn't know how the process worked with ordering/seating. We noticed a lot of people ordering coffee from a side window and decided to do that as well. We sent someone to order coffees while someone held place in the general line. This was a great call! They delivered our coffees to us in line. I ordered the Vietnamese Iced Coffee since this is one of my favorite coffee drinks! It was pretty below average which was disappointing especially since it was kind of expensive at $4+ The pastries all looked sooo delicious! I would love to go back and try some of them. I ended up ordering the Pork Adobo Fried Rice. I like that they offer a large variety of foods especially fusion foods! It was definitely the most expensive pork adobo fried rice I will probably ever eat at about $18. It was worth it because it was REALLY DELICIOUS!!! It was a pretty small portion too especially for the price. But it was worth the flavor! Seating was a little difficult to find, we were able to snag something because a group was leaving. So it wasn't too bad but definitely not without effort! The service was really great! The cashier was really friendly and efficient when doing split checks for our party. The server was really nice and attentive as well! The ambiance is also really nice and casual. Great tie of old fashion and new! Definitely a place I would recommend and go back to!"}, {"review_id": "VPFDql0grQFtr_y9pAj74g", "user_id": "9arXbHgEt8UPb84YvwfFGw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "One of the best brunches I have ever had!

The chia bowl is relatively light and felt very fresh. Pork fried rice super flavorful and not as heavy as it could have been, which is nice. And then the croque madame was also really great. Only thing that was probably more average was the waffle but it was still tasty and we finished all of it (3 of us. We might be fatties but we also split 3 pastries).

She came over to me to discuss my options, and there turned out to be more than enough for me to eat. I had an amazing feast!The table ordered bread and butter, and our waitress confirmed the bread alone was vegan. It was warm and perfect.The Little Gem salad (to make it vegan, get it with lemon vinaigrette instead of the green goddess) was one of the best salads I've ever had. The ingredients were so fresh and flavorful, I could eat it every day for the rest of my life and never tire of it.The cauliflower (minus the yogurt) was a showstopper. It was beautifully roasted, and I could've made a meal out of it alone.I was amazed that such a fancy restaurant had a vegan pasta dish on the menu, so I couldn't help but order the spinach cavatelli. My god, what a perfect plate of food. While my fellow diners shared a rib-eye, I was moaning over my umami-filled, dark green pasta, chock full of morel and porcini mushrooms. I'm not sure if they had to change anything to make it vegan (I think they might have to leave off the cheese), so just make sure whoever is serving you knows you're vegan and they'll hook you up.It's a bit of a miracle that I remember as much as I do because I had THREE of their Grapefruit cocktails. They're ridiculously delicious. Normally we're a wine crowd but the birthday boy insisted we do cocktails and I can see why. We were all flushed by the end of it, fat and happy.I never thought République would be for me, but it's one of the best meals I've had in a LA recently.

SERVICE - When we got to the glass cases displaying the pastries, we were greeted by an employee that asked if we wanted any pastries. We put in an order for some and then was directed to the next available cashier who took our order. From there, we received a cup with our number on it for our food. Finding a seat could be very difficult durning peak times but there was a nice blonde (manager maybe), that helped us search for one that fit our party of four. That was really nice of her to do that! FOODCroissant - I read somewhere that the croissant was a must so we got it. It was very buttery and it did have that flakiness to it but it  was also a little hard. Chocolate Croissant - Chocolate usually makes everything better so this was a tasty chocolate croissant! Pork Adobo Fried Rice - This had a ton of flavor but a little on the heavy lime juice. Lots of meat chunks though.Kimchi Fried Rice - This came with two poached eggs which made the rice a bit soggy if you mixed them in.

The first thing I notice was how beautiful the setting was. The central foyer was a grand setting with the huge window and the long, wooden tables. My server was a wonderful guy on my journey of trying the best food in this restaurant. They allowed me to order fractions of certain meals to maximize my experience. Oysters were fresh and delicious. Nothing fancy but all elegance. The eggs on toast was a great combo of uni, egg, and bread. It felt like a runny egg on a brioche bun! I love her fact that it was warm. The uni melted into the eggs harmoniously. The potato and leek beignets were ok. They were good, but nothing amazing. Definitely nicely had a German vibe. The beignet itself was a great texture. The kanpachi crudo was orgasmic! The coconut curry broth is comparable to some of the best Thai restaurants around. I like how the crudo and pineapple were cut into small chunks instead of shaved. The fish had a great fishy flavor. The peanuts took it to a whole new level! I don't know where they get them from, but they have such a wonderful, roasted, nutty flavor. Absolute must to order. The seared foie gras was on a whole other level of bliss. Every bite was a rich explosion of sultry pleasure. The strawberry sauce was a little too sweet at times, but if you eat everything together, it generally works. The loved the idea of incorporating strawberries with the foie gras to begin with. It felt like a dessert and appetizer at the same time. The tokyo turnips were a nice touch.  Not only was a swept away from meal as a whole, but I still think about how good it was! I didnt like the it was super pricey, but I can look the other way when Im having such good food. I cant wait to come back to LA and make another reservation!

I would so go here often if I lived close to one... wahSo right off the bat you'll think of pastries, especially when you are greeted with some delicious looking ones while waiting in line at the entrance. But then you get your hands on a menu, look around at the incredible architecture you are about to have a meal in, and then look at what other people are having and boom! Predicament. It was kind of tough deciding what to get when their brunch menu was longer and had more variety than most places. And when your trusty yelp app shows you photos of nearly everything that you cannot decide between. Ultimately I went with the Japanese bowl. My gf got the pork adobo fried rice. My sister got the breakfast sandwich. And my homie got the kimchi fried rice. Best part? We all had eggs to jiggle on our ig boomerangs (except the sandwich). After a little taste trading, I came to the conclusion that each of these items was an incredible choice. Nothing like I've ever tasted before, despite menu descriptions sounding familiar and basic. Every thing was incredibly savory and an interesting blend of some good brunch and even dinner flavors. That Japanese bowl was probably my favorite: grains, quinoa, mushrooms, avocado, sprouts, salmon roe, and egg. There was pickles on it too which sounds a bit odd, but wow it actually worked well with all the other flavors. Great vegetarian option. I also have to shoutout the pork belly sausage in the breakfast sandwich. Tasted really good. Sadly we didn't get any pastries (I'll be back again for you, s'mores bombolini), but I did get the iced matcha green tea which was pretty good after I added some honey syrup.

With a line worth waiting in, this restaurant serves up a savory eclectic portfolio of familiar comfort food that has been curated and boosted by the culinary firepower of Chef M. Manzke. The chili made with duck, the fried chicken and waffles, the breakfast sandwich and the pork belly fried rice are some of my favorites. There is a subtle French influence but I don't think Paris has had the pleasure. You might notice a lot of dishes are topped with a fried egg.

Dinner menu changes every day.From experience, to food, to location, and restaurant style, this place is pretty freakin' awesome. Came here for a celebration of my friend's acceptance to grad school at UCLA on a Sunday night. Made reservations the day of. I was surprised to get a table! The lady who answered the phone, however, was super rude and sounded annoyed. But! I just brushed it off because I was happy to get a table. We got here a little earlier than our reservation, then we were seated right at our scheduled time. The restaurant was full, lively, and at the perfect noise level (in the back of the restaurant at least). Our server was super helpful and sweet. Shout out to Allie! Was super bummed when she had to leave.Okay, on to the food. Drinks: I went with the amazing House G+T. No, that does not stand for \"gym, tan...\". Lol. This thing was one of the best drinks I've had. Gin, blood orange, kaffir lime, and tonic. Must get! Veggies: The cauliflower. This little bowl had an amazing assortment of veggies and nuts, all resting on top of a delicious lime yogurt base. It's packed with flavors and the veggies are cooked to perfection. Meats: The beef short rib. This is probably the most tender short rib I have ever had. It came with no knife, so I expected it would cut easily. And that it did. Like butter. The half chicken was our second protein. This thing is huge, designed for two or more to share. This was served on a hot skillet, with a spinach and potato base. The chicken was rotisserie style and melted off the bone. A little on the saltier side, but no complaints here! Just wish I had rice. LOL. Ended this delicious meal with a butter almond cake topped with fruit and ice cream. This was to die for. The cake has a crispy outer layer and is super moist and flavorful inside. The fruits were marinated beautifully and the ice cream added the perfect touch to the cake. Delicious! My one and only complaint is about the server who took over after Allie had to leave for the night. This gentleman was cordial, but had no personality what so ever. He didn't really try to \"sell\" any of the desserts to us, he rarely checked in to see how things were going, and he didn't even say goodbye or thank you as we were leaving the restaurant! He even looked me in the eye as I was walking out. It was almost as if he was annoyed with me. Weird. But, his behavior wouldn't be the reason I deducted a star. Luckily we ran into Allie outside on our way to vallet. She smiled and wished us a good night and said thank you! Overall, amazing experience. The food is unique and flavorful, prepared with love. The service was awesome (until our sever changed) and the restaurant had an overall outstanding vibe. Can't wait to come back! Quick Tips: 1. $10 vallet parking. Yup, $10! Holy cow. Some street parking available. 2. Call early to make a dinner reservation. They only take reservations for dinner. 3. Bread is free. Ask for more.
