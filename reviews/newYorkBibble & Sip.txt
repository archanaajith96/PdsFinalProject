It's a tiny place and I see people crammed looking for a place to eat.  You can stand at the windowsill counter and eat your treat, but I always take them to go.  The line queue is hard to describe, as it zig zags and you have to ask people \"are you in line or are you waiting for standing room to dine in?\"  I wish it was larger!  The drink specials are amazing too.  The drinks are very unique and hard to find anywhere else, especially the lattes or the HK tea.It has an Asian twist or flavor to all their pastries and drinks, but it's not a bubble tea cafe."}, {"review_id": "MV4Ea8GSt7x2PG7KdvvfWA", "user_id": "5Ih7YcRrIk1T-Od7P5S9Fw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "One of my favorite cafes in the city. Matcha has a huge presence in their menu, from their drinks to their food items to their soft serve ice cream (yup!), and they do matcha well!I usually get the pana cotta, most recent visit I got the black sesame one. The texture is so smooth and the sesame flavor isn't subtle, but not overwhelming either. They also have quiches, croissants, and plenty of dessert type pastries. Of note, their cream puffs are really good (but not available til after 12 noon). And all the food is made in house from scratch!Their drink options will suit both coffee lovers and tea drinkers. I usually just opt for americanos, but their matcha lattes taste delicious and look so nice. Like their food items, the syrups for their drinks are made in house as well.  This time I also tried their matcha green tea soft serve. The portion for $5 was more than expected. The matcha flavor was present in the soft serve, but matcha powder was also dusted atop. It was very good. Inside is relatively small, only 5 or so tables plus window bar to set along. It is especially crowded on weekend mornings with people sitting and a long line. Only thing I would like for the seating would be to add USB/outlets for charging. If you are a matcha lover, then this place is for you! If you don't have much experience with matcha, this is a great place for you too! A definite stop whenever I travel to the city!"}, {"review_id": "AWS1HZB5EHeqKrU2JEhgDA", "user_id": "tSarJeiWA8D3jhrxuFQwOg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "The desserts especially the Cream Puffs here are to effing die for! Coming from someone that could literally eat dessert for every meal, I have to say this place is amazing. I came here with my family so I was luck enough to try almost half of their pastries (we're all fatties) we had their green tea float, matcha jasmine latte hot and cold, earl grey cream puff, matcha cream puff, matcha pana cotta, thai tea pana cotta, chocolate chip brownie cookie, pistachio white chocolate cake, matcha soft serve, and the carrot cake. While they were all amazing the cream puffs were the best by far! The only one I wouldn't recommend is the thai pana cotta, it just tasted kinda funky.The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is just like all the other reviews say. This place in insanely busy and small. We waiting in line for over 20 minutes, additionally finding a place to sit is straight impossible which can be annoying when you have a bunch on food you want to share."}, {"review_id": "ThFDOBYwpCV0fyUanisIjA", "user_id": "FC1ZSB9fd4WlDMSAbEjq8Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I love desert. Even though I was really full (I had a huge meal nearby), I came here to get desert because I always have room for desert. There is limited seating, you might want to do take out. They have lots of different goodies- cream puff, macarons, cakes, panna cotta etc. I went for the black sesame hazelnut crunch cake. At first.. black sesame sounded weird, but my friend told me that it was excellent so I decided to give it a try.Wow, it was amazing. It wass not super \"sesame-ey\", it tastes more like chocolate/ hazelnut. The crunch was amazing.

We visited New York in January and it was extremely cold... so all we wanted to do was drink coffee and hot chocolate. My husband decided to look for all the coffee shops in New York and Bibbled & Sip was one of the top places to visit. After a long walk in Time square we walked to dinner then to this coffee shop. From the moment we walked in we knew it was a great choice.. It was so packed and no sits available. I stud in line and waiting for our turned. I order a mocha with a signature Bibble & Sip design. My husband order a hot chocolate with a big square marshmallow on top. (Can you say yummy)After few minutes people started leaving and we found a table for two. People kept coming in and it was busy at all times. I must say it was a little dirty but I can't give it a 4 start it New York and it's a super busy place, with amazing Custumer service.Thank you I'll be back and I'll make sure to order a hot chocolate with a big marshmallow next time."}, {"review_id": "ajz3F8l0bSDoR22Cjy-ULQ", "user_id": "R-de4En7awhk4srgofe8Ag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Ugh what is this phenomenon?  MOTHEREFFING FLUFFY CLOUD-LIKE CREAM PUFFS, IS WHAT.  Gods, literally the best creme puff, and nearly one of the best matcha items I've ever had.  Highly, highly, highly recommend.  The single creme puff, reasonably priced, is about the size of The Rock's fist.  The pasty shell is crispy and lightly sweet, and the filling is absolutely heavenly.  It's packed filled with creme, and it's beautifully blended with matcha and cream.  We also got the Earl Grey, and that was stellar as well.I also recommend trying the Panna Cotta.  The earl grey was amazing, and the black sesame vanilla a bit less so.  One of the highlights from this is the cute little glass bottles you get to keep - we're starting a collection! ;)  We also tried the tea, which was also okay, but we'll probably skip the drinks next time to focus on the delish desserts.Note, there will always be a line, sometimes out the door, but it moves fairly quick - you'll probably be in and out in less than ten minutes.  Seating is also limited, but if you wait awhile standing with your order looking like a lost puppy, someone will typically notice and leave their seats - the turnover is quick."}, {"review_id": "bHljIlf1qcUdRqQQ_KS9ug", "user_id": "T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "I came to Bibble & Sip twice - it was very close to my hotel.  I originally planned for Saturday breakfast but did not realize it opened later on Saturday than the other days of the week, so instead I met my mentor here at 2 PM.  It was PACKED.  I ordered an iced jasmine matcha latte and got an assortment of pastries: black sesame cream puff, matcha cream puff, and a yuzu pear danish.  My mentor was overwhelmed by the crowd in this tiny place and almost did not see me.  We found a table and shared the cream puffs.  I felt badly for not ordering her a drink (the line was too long for her to get in it) but I did not know what should would have wanted.  The cream puffs were huge, fresh, and delicious!  I saved the yuzu pear danish for the next day, and it was also very good.I returned yesterday on my final lap around the area before I had to head to the airport.  I ordered the same latte which I thought only came iced but it was hot.  I was sweaty drinking that, wearing a coat, and walking back to my hotel, but it was delicious.  I also ordered another matcha cream puff and black sesame macaron to go.  I finished packing and Eric R. decided he wanted pizza, so he left the hotel while I dragged all of our stuff to the lobby.  I ate the macaron while I waited.  It was so cute, first of all, and so delicious!When we got to the airport, I ate the cream puff.  It was bigger than I remembered, and just stunningly green and yummy.  I definitely endorse these!  They are available after 12 PM daily.  There were many other delicious desserts and pastries to try but I will have to return to NY to do so.  Check out the alpaca decor throughout this place!"}, {"review_id": "xgWb8vlvt-yVJmU6O1kCuw", "user_id": "JChx-48PcGZjD1OE7O69VQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Got the earl grey and matcha cream puffs along with a jasmine green tea.Great place to chill and it's right outside the Gershwin Theater!Cream puffs were good!

My wife had the green tea latte, which was also really good.They were also both visually appealing, a definite plus. If it's available, get the sesame almond croissant.

The line is about the same (read: to the door) but I was able to snag a seat by the windows eventually. The matcha jasmine latte ($4.75) was pretty standard and similar to matcha lattes throughout the city. I was hoping to get a hint of the jasmine but couldn't find it, which was disappointing because that would have been an interesting flavor combination. The matcha cream puff ($3.50) was excellent and was not too overpowering. Paired with the matcha latte, it tasted sweeter and lighter compared to the slightly bitter notes of the latte. Having tried the all the nut-free cream puffs, I have to say the black sesame one is definitely the way to go. The flavor of the filling is the most intense out of all the puffs!"}, {"review_id": "4fP5gDvrHsL5yvooRnQCaw", "user_id": "HW5mYuF5RzkbYvJhceq7_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "I came here for the first time with some coworkers after hearing great reviews, and I must say I agree with them!I got the lavender latte and a matcha green tea cream puff.

They also present the latte nicely with \"foam art\" (see picture). The cream puff was heavenly - the perfect sweet treat.

(It's literally right across the street, so if you're in the area, definitely stop by!) The interior is super cute and their logo has a little alpaca on it! It was very busy inside and we had to wait a little bit to find space at the standing tables because all of the seats in the small café were taken, so I'd imagine the weekends are probably even more crazy. I have heard that if you don't come early enough they can sell out of cream puffs (sometimes before noon!), but we must have gotten lucky because we came in the early evening on a Thursday and there still appeared to be plenty of each flavor left. I ordered three cream puffs: matcha, early gray, & black sesame. They were so fantastic! I would have to say they are probably the best cream puffs I've ever tried. They are super large and the puff part is very airy and light but the top has a crispy and flavorful layer. The cream is sweet but not over the top. My favorite was the black sesame, but I think everyone else in my group enjoyed the earl gray the most. Honestly though, I feel like you can't go wrong with any of the flavors because they were all so delicious. Each cream puff cost around $3 which is well worth it for how dang good these things taste (plus they are pretty large)!Definitely give this place a try if you're in NY and enjoy cream puffs!"}, {"review_id": "u_9yLNLB9eSnz37b27XTVA", "user_id": "oaOEItHZ3xq4PKz4K8Ux0g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "This place was so good!

At 12pm they start selling cream puffs, fresh from the oven. They will continue baking and rolling out cream puffs until 4pm/5pm. After that, they stop baking new batches and whatever is left is whatever is left. He said occasionally they sell out by 7pm/8pm but every day varies.So given that information, I decided to go Thursday during my lunch break. Got there around 1pm. Line wasn't too long, maybe 3 people in front of me? They offered cream puffs with the following flavors: matcha, earl grey, hazelnut, and black sesame. I got these as a birthday present for my brother so didn't get to try all of them. Did, however, try the black sesame the next night. The lady that worked there said the cream puffs are good for 1 day. The other desserts vary between 2-3 days, refrigerated. Even though I ate black sesame cream puff the next day, it was still AMAZING! First off, the cream puff is like the size of my first! Second off, being that the cream puff was one day old, the outer crust was still crispy and fresh. Was NOT soggy at all. It probably would have tasted even more divine if I ate it the day I bought it. The cream inside was light and tasted just like black sesame without it being overbearing.Next time, would LOVE to try more items!!"}, {"review_id": "sczr7WC0SdU4DmAp_0PMJA", "user_id": "xATaOd8oVHYQa9W7t3IMYg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Tiny bakery cafe conveniently located on 50th st.
