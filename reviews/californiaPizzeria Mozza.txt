The attention to subtleties in flavors are what are most incredible here. Each little bite creates a tiny symphony of your tastebuds singing out loud for more.Meatballs al forno to start are a good move as they introduce you to the stellar dough work on display here. And the cauliflower fritti with a spicy mint aoili is almost sinfully indulgent--you have to remind yourself you're eating a vegetable after every bite.The goat cheese/leeks/scallions/garlic/bacon pizza is stupidly fun to eat. Each part of the dish hits at separate times, exciting you more than is probably normal. The stars of this pizza are the roasted whole pieces of garlic, essentially a funky garlicky butter by the time you take a bite. The salame and Fresno chiles pizza is equally dynamic with a tangy and aromatic taste to it.Now, I'm not much of a dessert man, but if I were on death row, I'd request Pizzeria Mozza's butterscotch budino as my final meal. It's that's good, folks.And a cool aside: I saw Nancy Silverton walking around the restaurant which made tonight that much more of a five-star experience. She's a living legend!Eat at Pizzeria Mozza!

It's also pretty cramped inside, and you'll be sitting immediately next to other tables. We started with the fried squash blossoms, which people had raved about on Yelp! They were unique and tasty, and came out quite hot. However, they were also very tiny. I was expecting a little more!I got the mushroom pizza which was very cheesy and delicious. I liked the crust, which was soft and tasted very fresh. I was fairly satisfied with my pizza choice.While I would come here again, I don't think it's the best option for pizza in the area, especially given the difficulty in getting a reservation and the price for what you get.

Follow your dreams! Pizza: The perfect meal. An open-faced pie using tomato sauce, cheese, and another manner of toppings. Taste like heaven and is sometimes stated to be better than a relationship. Pizzeria Mozza...will undoubtedly satisfy all pizza lovers with their incredible food. I had been drooling over their pictures for months. I finally got my hands on everything I have been eyeing! Everything was scrumptious and as delicious as the pictures looked. What we ordered:Our appetizers:-Cauliflower Fritti with spicy mint aioli. I  don't usually get excited about eating my vegetables, but this dish was amazing! The fried cauliflower was fried to perfection and paired with creamy aioli sauce. Absolutely delicious! I wish eating vegetables was this good all the time. -Fried Squash Blossoms with ricotta was superb! The tempura batter was crunchy and flavorful with melting ricotta cheese oozing out with each bite.  Anything filled with cheese, dipped in batter and fried, has my name written all over it.  -Crispy Goat Cheese with Umbrian lentils. If you like goat cheese you're in for a treat.  It was so good. I only wish the portion was bigger since I was sharing with a group of people. Next time I will get an order all for myself!-Meatballs al Forno- I didn't try these but my friends said they were delicious! They were described as moist and flavorful swimming in marinara sauce, topped with buttery semolina crisp bread! The bread really complemented the herbs and seasonings used in the sauce. -Bone Marrow al Forno-This dish consisted of 3 huge bones served with crostini, plus seasonings of fresh herb, salt flakes, and soft garlic. The table loved it. All of the appetizers were excellent choices.  Pizzas:-Meatball Pizza: Meatballs, Mozzarella di Bufala, Tomato and Fresh Oregano. You no longer need to choose between your meatballs and pizzas. Now you lcan have both together! -Meat Lovers Pizza: Bacon, Salame, Fennel Sausage, Guanciale, Tomato, and Mozzarella. The name of this pizza is the perfect description. If you love your meat you will enjoy this pizza. -Potato Pizza: Egg, Bacon, Yukon Gold Potato, Fontina, Sottocenere and Cippolini Onions. (This was my pizza). Whoever said that you can't have pizza and breakfast at the same time lied, because my pizza was a breakfast pizza. The pizza was unique and flavorful. Dessert:-Butterscotch Budino with Maldon sea salt & rosemary pine nut cookies. The Italian pudding had creamy silky layers of butterscotch, a touch of salt and cream on top. It tasted luscious and rich with a nice balance of sweetness. I have had this dessert before, and it was as good as I remember. -Caramel Coppetta: Holy Moly, this was incredible. This dessert had Caramel gelato covered with marshmallow sauce and Spanish peanuts. It was salty and sweet all in one. This dessert was the clear winner of the night. It puts other desserts to shame! We took turns licking the bowl! GET IT! Pizzeria Mozza you've stolen a pizza of my heart!"}, {"review_id": "7WKzh1f4HGTOUiwdybqEjA", "user_id": "jPRwNa8hCqf3vLYIXKz0CA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Again, I wish we had half scores!

We order the stuffed squash blossoms as an appetizer (good, very simple) and decided to share a pizza (a white pizza with three kinds of cheese and fried sage). The pizza was good - the crust in particular. We also got their quite famous dessert - butterscotch budino. I'm not much of a dessert eater, but this was good. I do wish that the salt was a little more present, because even with the crystals of salt I could see and taste, the dessert was still much too sweet for me. The food was good.

Served with greasy bread to dip into the sauce. Everyone enjoyed.Cauliflower fritti-served with a spicy mint aioli. I did not enjoy this taste combo. Cauliflower was perfectly fried, but I found it too heavy when you have pizza in store. And I found the aioli a bit on the bland side.Nancy's chopped salad-excellent. Highly  recommend; lettuce, pepperoncini, chickpeas, peppered salami, all tossed together with an oregano vinaigretteNapolitana-this made it 5 stars for me. One of my favorite taste combos, but I can only find it done right in Italy. Mozza has provided the best I've had in the U.S. Salty and savory, it's tomato, mozzarella di bufala, olives, anchovies, chilies & fried capers on a perfect crust.Finally, make sure you leave some room for their desserts. I tried a bite of both the Butterscotch budino and caramel coppetta and they were both excellent. Towards the end of the evening, our server was hard to flag down, but we were all satiated by that time, so it didn't bother me.

Point is, I'm no expert in pizza but I know a good pizza when I've tasted it. I've been to Pizzeria Mozza a few times now and every time I've left the place, I've left satisfied and thought to myself I should come back here more often. The crust is thin, crisp, slightly chewy and when topped with a boatload of mushrooms and cheese, it's a slam dunk. Wash it down with a cold beer and it's a grand slam. Their Butterscotch Budino is also very tasty and popular. Go and watch Chef's Table, Season 3 on Netflix about Nancy Silverton if you need further proof.

They have an array of helpful reviews for Yelpers to sift thru so let me give you my 2 cents.$14 valet parking which obviously ends up adding well over $20 to your full Mozza experience after tipping. Paying for parking  never bothers me but it can be a deciding factor especially when you account for the overcrowded restaurant, walk in's being a semi-nuisance, and the stuck up demeanor of a good amount of patrons & staff alike. Cute  venue but they pack you in like sardines which can add a little tension to your meal. I decided on the caprese salad & bone marrow dishes. They tasted fairly fresh and had some flavor. Their both relatively light due to portion but maybe not the best combo to indulge in during the same sitting. Toast & garlic bread were recommended for both but they can use much less grease on the bread especially since the dishes themselves are increibly oily to begin with. I couldn't even fathom sharing dessert with the other girls in my party even though I was still hungry. I wasn't overly impressed with Mozzas repertoire. Tiny space, turn tables quickly, average fare with a grandeur tab, over-hyped, and potentially even under staffed since I needed to flag down a waitress so another person at our table can order.

I saw availability on Open Table a few hours prior to our visit, and being that we were headed to Hollywood for the day/night, we decided to go for it. This restaurant has been on my to do list for quite a while. Being one of the top rated pizza places in all of America, expectations were pretty high. Pizzeria Mozza ranked #5 best pizza in America by USA Today, and Jonathan Gold often raves about it. It had a lot to live up to, and fortunately, it did not disappoint.When we walked in, the first thing I noticed was that the restaurant was pretty lively. Lots of people, and lots of conversation. Pizzeria Mozza is actually not that big, and to my surprise, there were a couple of open tables. The host quickly greeted us and took us to our table. Service was pretty good throughout our meal. Our waitress was kind and helpful with recommendations, and refills were prompt.We ordered the meatballs appetizer to start ($14), which came with a couple pieces of bread. The bread was fresh, and the meatballs were good. I wasn't completely blown away, but I did enjoy them. The sauce was tasty, and the meatballs themselves were big. For myself, I ordered the Mozzarella di bufala, tomato, basil & extra virgin olive oil pizza, priced at $21. This place isn't cheap, but the quality is undeniable.My first couple bites left me a little disappointed, but after my first slice heading into the halfway mark, I slowly fell in love. The pizza definitely grew on me. The more I had, the more I liked it and wanted more. It got addicting. The sauce was definitely my favorite part. Towards the end, I couldn't get enough of it. The pizza here is definitely on the crispier side. The dough was great, and the cheese was the perfect amount. This was a very solid pizza.This is a restaurant I'd definitely come back to, but maybe for dinner instead. $21 personal pizzas are a little much for lunch, but the quality definitely warrants it. Is it the best pizza I've had? Questionable. I personally love MidiCi in Sherman Oaks, which offers high quality pizza at a fraction of the cost. MidiCi is still my favorite and go-to for now, but I can't deny that this was a memorable pizza and great experience.

Every part of the experience seemed recycled or offered without care. Our table wobbled. The menu missed sufficient veg options. The music was so loud - our surrounding tables were yelling to be heard. The music seemed DJed by some midlevel DJ from Cleveland. LA is an odd microcosm where the masses would prefer to be seen at the same spot as their friends rather than have an experience of their own.

How did you do it Nancy Silverton? How did you replicate the exact same pizza crust to California which tastes so good in Italy?? Just thinking about this wonderful concoction of an Italian favorite makes me salivate. This is a crust I'll never forget and is for sure my top number one for best pizza. (The other was one in Manhattan, but that's another review.) Pizzeria Mozza is located on North Highland Avenue in the Hancock Park area of Los Angeles. The area is pretty busy with lots of restaurants and businesses so parking will be a pain in the a**. If you are someone who doesn't like to waste a minute of your time and prefers to be on time or early, (Like me.) I would just drive straight to valet and pay the $12. It will save you the pain of driving around aimlessly while you dream about taking a bit of that crust. The interior of the restaurant is dimly lit with a rosy color. It's perfect for a romantic date or group dinner. The tables are placed very close to each other which doesn't allow for private conversations; that's the only gripe I have about this place. Also, the noise level can get very loud. While the dining room is not that large, they do have a private room off to the side. When you walk into the room, the smell of the pizzas cooking in their ovens permeates the whole restaurant. I have to say that the thing to order is their delicious pizzas. That crust is crunchy yet the inside is chewy and soft. I can't wait to go back and get another pizza!Roasted Carrots w/ Ceci & Cumin Vinaigrette : I wasn't that impressed with this appetizer. The carrots could've been roasted longer and I feel the cumin doesn't go well with carrots. I didn't realize that the dish had cumin in it or I wouldn't have ordered it. Bacon, Salame, Fennel Sausage, Guanciale, Tomato & Mozzarella : This is their all meat pizza. I love meat and I love pizza so this was the perfect one for me. The fennel sausage went really well with the tomato and mozzarella. And of course that crust.

You'll get tons of \"bread\" with the pizza crust. Tastes similar with a hint of char and some garlicky flavor.-Bianca with fontina, sottocenere, mozzarella, sage $19 we added sausage for $5. Basically a cheese pizza with some sausage and sage. Nothing special, felt almost comparable to a Blaze pizza to be honest.
