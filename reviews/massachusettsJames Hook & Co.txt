I know when you come to Boston a lobster roll and clam chowder are one of the first things everyone says you need to get-THIS is the place to go! It is a little expensive? Sure. But is it worth it? 100%!! You have to realize that quality, fresh lobster is not cheap. And with lobster rolls, you get what you pay for. James Hook will not disappoint. The lobster roll itself comes piled high with tons of lobster meat and the roll is so soft and buttery. You can order it with butter if you don't prefer mayo, but in my opinion GET THE MAYO. Your taste buds will thank you.Also, a MUST TRY is the clam chowder. Huge chunks of clam and potatoes with a rich creamy broth, it doesn't get much better.If you are visiting Boston for the first time this should be on the top of your to-do list! It's especially beautiful in the summertime because all of the outdoor seating is open and there is plenty of room to sit somewhere!"}, {"review_id": "qyv5-GYv_WRR80Sk-amJ8Q", "user_id": "V14OIQbOgg_nDliIHhIGxg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "First off let me start off by saying this is got to be the best lobster roll I've ever had in all of Boston the lobster is fresh very fresh.. absolutely deliciousI did not like the crabcakes the taste of it was very basic nothing spectacular I've had better crabcake plenty of times before I will not be ordering crabcakes from there again it has no flavor very bland..The long the line is ridiculous for such a small establishment there is no organization people are just everywhere at times it makes you want to turn around and say forget it but this place is definitely well worth the wait..For such a pricey place they said at least give you a nice fancy bag when you asked for your order to go for God sake when you're paying over $30 for a food item to go I should at least be able to have a bag with the company logo on it to take home for the experience..

The line moves quickly so the wait is not an issue; though, seating may be difficult to find, especially on a weekend when the sun is out. The lobster roll is mayo-based and has so much lobster! Way more than Luke's Lobster -- so you are definitely getting your money's worth here at James Hook. The lobster roll is light and tangy. A squeeze of fresh lemon helped to add some acidity to the roll. The New England clam chowder is rich and pairs well with the lobster roll. There are generous amounts of clams and potatoes in the soup.I highly recommend James Hook & Co for lobster rolls and take all your friends! They will thank you for it."}, {"review_id": "IEoSplgJtMVO8A6HBYvI-g", "user_id": "hWDybu_KvYLSdEFzGrniTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "My colleague's last lunch with the company, we decided to go all out and hit up James Hook for lobster rolls.

Loaded with lobster meat and just a little bit of mayo to hold the whole thing together, you had to eat a bunch of it in order to get it to a size you could pick up. Really tasty, really fresh, absolutely excellent. They went all out here.

I love that this place is a family owned and operated business that has been passed down for generations. They sell lobster and seafood products to both wholesale and retail, and located right inside this small restaurant they have live lobster that you can purchase on the spot! They also have an assortment of seafood you can purchase; such as stuffed clams, crab cakes, and lobster ravioli! Their Lobster Roll is to die for! They give you a generous amount of lobster, that is on a lightly toasted bun. I also tried the Clam Chowder, which is some of the best I have ever had (thats coming from a seafood lover) Although this is more of a showroom than a restaurant, I had to get my meal to-go because of limited amount of seating.Definitely check this place out if your around Boston's historic waterfront area"}, {"review_id": "JohO9nBR-bjCL_d03hf3rA", "user_id": "Qh9Qu-YeW_DNklETJB6KqA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "We gave this place a try, but it is obviously for the tourists.Good basic lobster rolls and creamy clam chowder in a trailer.

The amount of mayo they put was just right. The bun was lightly toasted. There was the perfect amount of lobster for the bun.Crab roll: As I mentioned, I usually like crab rolls better but the lobster roll here was actually way better.

James Hook was a 10 minute walk from the hotel we were staying in and so we decided this will be our Brunch before we catch our bus back to NY! We walked over and waited for them to open and was one of 10 other people who were also in line!Some ordered whole, fresh lobsters to go! The lobsters they have were HUGE! Anyway.. my boyfriend and I decided to order a large lobster roll, 2 pound lobster- steamed and a lobster bisque! The lobster roll was delicious- the bun was toasted but the lobster were served cold mixed with mayo. They might've put just a little too much mayo but I didn't mind it! The lobster- SO. SWEET. SO. GOOD. honestly as me and my boyfriend were eating, we constantly said to each other that this is the best lobster we've ever had! The lobster was juicy and meaty and overall delicious! I think we could've skipped the bisque but it was also pretty good.

My mouth is watering just thinking about it. This place is as fresh as fresh gets for seafood. Lobsters next to you that you can pick and take home.

I wanted to try more from the menu but I was too full! I did try my friends clam chowder and it was really tasty.

Actually, they were less surprised than I thought they would be. The packaged up a half pound of jumbo cooked shrimp, the lobster meat in a separate container than the bun, and a generous amount of cocktail sauce. I bought a cooler that you can put in the freezer to freeze solid, stashed all the seafood goodness inside, and made it through airport security to plenty of laughter from the TSA. London-bound lobster rolls aside, James Hook is a great spot for a casual bite or to grab fresh seafood to cook at home. Clearly I'm a fan of their lobster roll if I'm willing to take it international! It's lightly dressed, full of nicely sized chunks of tail and claw, and the perfect size for me. Yes, the place is housed in a doublewide, but I'm fine with that if it keeps their overhead low and prices reasonable."}, {"review_id": "dlSE1xCpGs1tqs5bRXRoMg", "user_id": "lO_L4Otm-hJQ0CvbDcynxA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/30/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "When I look at my old reviews I notice how things have changed in the Twitter era.

The line moved very quickly and the staff there were so nice! My large lobster roll and water came out to about $28, which was fully expected. The bread for the lobster roll was incredible - soft and delicious on the inside with just the right amount of texture on the outside. The lobster - not only was it perfectly and simply dressed, it was a massive portion of lobster. I cannot stress this enough. There was SO MUCH lobster - and nothing else as a filler or anything like that.
