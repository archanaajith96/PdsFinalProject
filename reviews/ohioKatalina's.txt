This is a place you want to say you've been to in Columbus.I thought it would be pretty hipster, because it's decorated that way and the workers certainly are, but the customers are not. I saw mostly college students, especially sorority girls and old folks. I saw a few hipsters, but this seemed like one of those trendy restaurants, and that is so not a hipster thing. I feel like a tourist should visit though.Parking isn't bad. There's a lot that's free I think until 4. But I did parallel parking just past the lot because I didn't even notice they had a lot.The neighborhood is expensive so the prices definitely reflect this.When my two friends and I came at 9 in the morning on a Thursday, almost all the spaces were taken inside. It was TINY. I'm not kidding.I guess people know you gotta come early. I can't imagine being here on a weekend. My friend told me that she waited 30 minutes when she came around 11 on a Saturday.They do have a good handful of tables outside, so we sat at one. They're all bench tables with umbrellas. Lots of graffiti and drawings all over the tables. I ordered the pancake balls with some coffee. I will truthfully add that the dishes are kinda expensive. I spent $16 total. The pancake balls were almost $12  and the coffee is refillable.It's worth trying though. I got full. I ate maybe two, gave two to one friend, and the rest to my other friend. My friends got breakfast sandwiches. One had egg and bacon and the other friend had one that was egg, avocado, red peppers, aioli, provolone, and pulled pork. Their food came with Ohio tortilla chips. Really good and filling! I split the sandwich with one of my friends and gave her most of my pancake balls. It's worth splitting a sandwich. It's so much! I don't eat a lot for breakfast in the first place!Service was good. As we left, a worker came out to give my friend a bag for her leftovers. So nice!!It got even busier as it approached 11. Wow! Popular spot even though it's pricey.It's worth your money though! I wouldn't come every week, but I will definitely visit again!"}, {"review_id": "FbTP5qwCB8GeTxFhb3gVSw", "user_id": "GyJf71ss616pHZrFZpL42g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "A really fun and delicious spot. We stopped by for brunch while visiting in early spring. We I saw a line out the door and onto the sidewalk I was concerned we would have to go elsewhere. I eventually realized that the wait is to order at the counter and then grab a seat and wait for your food. The inside is VERY small with just a few tables and some bar areas with stools. The patio has  much more seating and is a great option weather permitting, dogs are also welcome on the patio it appeared. I ordered an iced coffee and the breakfast tacos that come with chorizo, scrambled eggs, salsa verde and avocado. They were very impressive, though I wished I had tried one of the more creative sounding dishes instead. My husband ordered the fried chicken sandwich - full of flavor, texture, and on really good bread. We were super satisfied with our meal and I appreciated that the tacos were filling without leaving me stuffed (we had plans to try several local bakeries throughout the day!). I would highly recommend this place and hope to go back."}, {"review_id": "IK2H_e3Z0avBIaZG_MQOdw", "user_id": "J1CFu5tVK2K5Pr--Ri-mpA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "If you haven't been yet, make sure to grab the mezatlan pulled pork sandwich.

There's a good sized lot with free parking for Katalina's customers, but keep in mind that this place is SMALL. I had been given that advice before, but wow, it really is tiny. There is probably seating for 20 people or less in there, although during the warmer months there's outdoor seating.I had the black bean tacos, which come with a side of corn that was DELICIOUS. The tacos were also very good. We got there around 11:30, and by the time we left at 12:00, it was starting to get busy. I can imagine it would be packed around brunch time on the weekends.All in all, I was so happy I finally came to try Katalina's. The food is delicious and it is a truly unique place.

It's been around Columbus - Harrison West (district), to be precise - for a decent while. It's small. The outdoor patio is accommodating, but not huge. No covering, so you can expect a line out the door on Saturdays and Sundays if the weather's too cold or rainy for some fresh-air seating.I've always gotten their Pork and Egg breakfast sandwich. Very juicy marinated pulled pork. Sometimes, it's been a bit too salty, but I like meat for breakfast, so this dish seems to win out in the pickings war. They seem to be most notable for their pancake balls, of which I've yet to try.  Katalina's is a pet friendly restaurant, at least on their patio. It's a cozy, quaint atmosphere and the workers, for the most part, have been of a happy demeanor. They have their own small parking lot, and there's also free street parking all around - just be aware of the signs for restricted spaces."}, {"review_id": "NDLXI9dfkVsD7iYM_AuSJQ", "user_id": "EBqOfSAvI1giMy1cc1Lwnw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I always take my friends here whenever they visit and they always enjoy the food here!

You know you found a gem when you see people standing outside on a cold, February morning waiting to order. Although this place is extremely crowded, it is worth the wait. The food is unique just like the café's location. Housed in a 100-year-old gas station, this eclectic dive offers local homemade food with a Southern and Latin twist. Not only does the food taste amazing, but each meal is made from the best ingredients. Katalina's sources ethically, locally and organically. They even offer vegetarian options - one of the only restaurants in Columbus that has veggie sausage. This hot spot is only opened for breakfast, brunch and lunch. The menu is breakfast heavy...Katalina's is Home of The Original Pancake Balls! You must try the Pancake Balls! They are AMAZING! The balls are stuffed with Nutella and Dulce de leche and served with local Milligan's Bourbon Barrel Aged maple syrup. Another item you must try is the Elote Mexican Corn Cob! This is the BEST corn on the cob I have ever eaten! The corn is prepared with North Market Spices guajillo pepper, smoked paprika, parmesan & Sriracha-lime aioli - it is MUY BIEN! Next time you are looking for a delicious breakfast/brunch spot, come check out Katalina's. You will leave feeling full and satisfied!"}, {"review_id": "yKk4SftG77JVRFHehbEdYA", "user_id": "0WlAA3k8l0jBa67_oQYwtg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "Super cute local establishment. I love to patronize local restaurants which also support small local businesses.  This place has some amazing choices, including some great vegetarian options. My friend and I arrived around 9:30 on a tuesday morning and the small restaurant was busy. Parking was pretty easy since katalinas has a small lot next to their restaurant.We ordered the apple butter pancake balls and and the Famous pork and egg sandwich. Honestly, my mouth waters just thinking about the delicious dishes. The pancake balls came with sweet n spicy thick cut bacon, a perfect compliment to the yummy perfection pancake balls. If your not into bacon, I hear they have delicious vegeterian sausage.And i agree, the pork sandwich is famous....famously delicious. For two of us, we paid about $38....so not a cheap breakfast, but the food and flavors are fresh, delicious and amazing"}, {"review_id": "H0KZqd7jFYZd_pegkVsOeA", "user_id": "ULPfBj9qRg8b1COCOILG4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "I really liked the food here!

The vibe is really chill - but you have to time it right because seating is mostly outside. We came on a brisk but sunny day. I imagine my experience might have been marred if it was super windy or rainy out.The line moves surprisingly fast. I think we got to order in about 15 minutes. We split the nutella pancake balls, the breakfast tacos and the brussels sprouts. The nutella pancake balls were BOMB. I had indulged in a lot of sweets over the weekend, so couldn't eat too much. However, the pancakes are fluffy and light, with slightly crispy exterior. The nutella-to-pancake ratio was also spot on, that you got both in each bite. Also, I highly recommend the candied-spice bacon. It is finger-licking scrumptious! The salty against the caramelized coating and the kick from the spices were a spot-on combination.The breakfast tacos were good, but I wished for a more assertive flavor from the chorizo as well as a more flavorful sauce. I recommend the brussel sprouts to round out the meal as well."}, {"review_id": "6dykl-JbdyfOh5muLgo5Bw", "user_id": "SPPieDvwnkvQoI7lj5vFYg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/25/2017", "text": "A definite must stop visit in Columbus we absolutely loved everything and the food was amazing especially if you appreciate good vegetarian food...

Being a vegetarian, my friend recommended that we meet here for lunch because they have a lot of options for those who sway away from meat. It was super close to home and if it wasn't raining I could have walked there! Thankfully, they have a parking lot so driving there was hassle free. The hundreds of raving reviews they have also eased my mind and I knew I was in for a treat!There were several items on the menu that looked enticing but I settled on the breakfast tacos with vegetarian sausage. After all, the menu tells us they are award winning! It's also not super common to find vegetarian sausage so I was hella stoked to give it a try. After a short wait we snagged ourselves a table and not long after that we received our food. My tacos were so bright and colorful and came with a side of corn. I wish I would have taken a pic but I was so hungry I just dove right in. Let's just say, I ate every single bite and left my plate completely clean. The veggie sausage was really flavorful and I could hardly tell it wasn't real sausage! I was also pleasantly surprised that the crema on top was from Snowville Creamery. I love to see local businesses working and supporting other local businesses. I loved the vibe of this place and I'm looking forward to going another time.

I had the Pueblo BLT with the original sweet 'n' spicy bacon, and it was delicious. The bacon definitely had a bit of a kick, but it was just right for me. One of the best parts of my sandwich was the toasted 9-grain bread. It tasted so so fresh, and it's one of the more memorable breads that I've had.I enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant as well. It's one of those fun spots with outdoor seating and tables that you can mark up with pens provided by the restaurant. It seems to get busy, but we didn't have to wait long for a table.The only part of my dining experience that was awkward was my interaction with the staff member who took my order at the register. I like to ask for menu recommendations, especially when I dine somewhere new and when a menu has so many great options. In this case, when I asked for a recommendation, this is the response I got: \"I don't know... I mean, we have sandwiches... We have salads.\" And she seemed irritated at me for asking.

However I never seemed to be able to find the time to get there.Fast forward several years and my son is at Ohio State and I went down for a Sunday visit and decided to try them out.Well my friends recommendation did not disappoint. She told me I had to order the pancake balls and wow were they delicious. They have three flavors we chose the Nutella which ended up being soft totally delectable pillowy bites filled with chocolate. The maple bourbon syrup was a wonderful addition.I had the chorizo tacos, OMG.. out of this world. who could imagine that brussels sprout slaw could so deliciously replaced lettuce or cabbage. My son had a chicken sandwich with a sunny side up egg on a bun that he described as being absolutely wonderful.Also freshly squeezed orange juice hits the spot.A friend who joined me on the trip down enjoyed her mixed green salad topped with a crispy chicken breast.She was unable to describe the green dressing that accompanied it but said she enjoyed it.I will say the ordering process is not immediately easy to understand. We walked in and saw a hostess stand. we weren't sure if we were supposed to sit down or check in first. I learned by asking the woman in front of me in line who explained that you were to order first pay for your meal then be seated. No one is passing out menus so by the time we got to the hostess stand we were pretty much expected to order. With their extensive menu and not wanting to lose our place in line we almost felt rushed to order. Thank goodness the food is good and we made great choices otherwise I would have been very disappointed.Once we had ordered and paid we walked out onto their brightly colored umbrella patio to find no seating thankfully we were able to find a shaded table within 5 minutes and we were able to then sit until our food arrived.We pondered on what it must be like in colder months but I can say we will find out for ourselves because this is a place that we will be returning to time after time."}, {"review_id": "IGvYz8waMsKpim7AaiqrZw", "user_id": "1DTdytQrm6eqHKLqEStcmA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/22/2017", "text": "Talk about a hot spot for brunch.

This was their suggestion and man were they spot on. This place is not too far from the North Market. It has off street parking behind the restaurant, but it was full after we parked. They have seating both inside (small) or picnic tables and umbrella's outside. Done it was a beautiful morning, we stayed outside in the sun with a nice breeze. We arrived just in time and it only took about 10 minutes before making it to the front to order. Unknown to me, this place is known for their pancake balls, so obviously that was a must. We decided to share an order of those, as well as an order of biscuit balls. Great choice, the pancake balls we chose were filled with nutella and dulce de  leche...so good. The biscuits balls were good, they were filled with cheddar and ham. The inside decor of this place was hip and funky.
