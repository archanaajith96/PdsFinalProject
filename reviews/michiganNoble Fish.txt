The construction also did not help, but it took me three (3), yes three tries to find the place.  If you are new/first timer like I was, park in the lot by the ACE hardware store (make sure you park in the correct spaces - some parking spaces are dedicated for the ACE store), walk toward 14 Mile Road and the entrance is like 50 feet or so to your right (depending on where you parked) facing the 14 Mile Road.This is a grocery store/restaurant combo.  The store is tiny compared to other Japanese grocery stores, the restaurant is located in the back with some tables and a sushi bar with seating for five. I got there 10 minutes before the restaurant re-opened, so looked around the store. While waiting, I did notice some folks were going to the restaurant and grabbing tables, so with few minutes left before they opened, I went back, grabbed a order sheet and started to mark down what I wanted to get.  - spicy tuna roll- michigan roll- hand rolls:  spicy tuna, california roll and spicy california roll- Nigiri:  Shrimp, Tuna, Salmon and EelI dropped off my order at the counter and went to the bar and sat down and waited.  Since they made the orders as it came in, I waited 30 minutes before I got my food.  If they don't ask you if you want miso soup, just ask them.Here's what I thought...1.  The tuna to rice ratio on the Michigan roll was crazy.  They give you a lot of tuna!!  Basically it's large California rolls with Tuna replacing the crab meat.  2.  Hand Rolls were good, but like all hand rolls, as you get to the end of the roll, you are left with just rice.3.  The rice was lightly seasoned compared to other Japanese restaurants.  Typically, as you eat the sushi, you can taste the vinegar used in the rice, but not here.  This is more of a personal preferences.As far as the sushi went, their offering here is the same as One World Market in Novi, but have to say sushi from Ajishin is still my favorite up in the suburb area. The staff were friendly.  You pay at the cashier in the front.  I would revisit, but after the construction is over and now that I know where it's located won't have to suffer looking for this joint next time."}, {"review_id": "YxSvuZmdHvpUFHCxbvF5cw", "user_id": "kZ8GDBCGZ90T_c_XiSd38Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Hands down this is the best sushi place in the metro Detroit area!I have come to this small restaurant several times and it has never disappointed me.

The sushi is always decently pricedI got the Michigan roll (massive amounts of tuna) and spicy crab roll. The tuna was perfect, and the avocado in the rolls was fresh, though the spicy mayo lacked spiciness, I wasn't too upset by that. Good amount of wasabi and ginger included in our to-go order. This will always be our go to sushi place when I visit Royal Oak.I will say, the only downfall, is how teeny the sitting area is, and that if it's lunch time, expect to wait!!"}, {"review_id": "xOMaSQHg0K49-YmDT2_C5g", "user_id": "B06-B28wistMtimA4ZdvPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Nice little Japanese market with competitive prices for other asian markets in the area.

No frills, and is just a bunch of small seats. Everything was out of this world, but it was blown away by the Uni.

I went on a Tuesday night around 5:30 and there was only one other person seated.  By 6 o'clock all the seating was taken so I guess we picked the perfect time to go.I'll just say that the sushi was good. We had a Michigan, Acapulco, and tempura shrimp rolls, as well as miso soup to start. Everything was really good, but nothing knocked my socks off. Is it better than other store bought sushi? Absolutely, not even a comparison. Is it better than most other sushi I've had at other restaurants? Yea, for the most part. Is it the best I've had? No, it was not. I was also looking forward to trying the urchin but they were unfortunately out...bummer. I'll def go back here.

So expect a wait during rush hour times (lunch and dinner). The best sushi restaurant in Michigan hands down. I've been to many sushi restaurants in the west coast and all over Michigan so my expectations are a little high. I've been told that this sushi place is the best from all of my friends living in Michigan and I'm like sure. But Noble Fish has changed my mindset. Only come here for sushi if you live in Michigan because every where else is not the same.Let me tell you everything is fresh! Extremely fresh where I keep over ordering even when I'm full. It just tastes so good. I love mackeral, blue fin tuna, salmon, yellowtail, halibut, salmon roe, and most importantly uni! I ordered double of everything for myself. I love Noble Fish. Priced so cheap for the quality that I get in California.Great sushi for a great price and located in Michigan!

Yuck. Y'all seriously need to work on your seafood tastebuds.But I finally caved and went to Noble Fish and I have to say it is the only place yet that I can confidently say I can trust. Salmon, yellowtail, tuna, unagi--all of it's on point. On paydays I come here for lunch because YOLO treat yourself get lit and so on. You can get take out but I like to get mine for here and squish myself into one of the tiny tables and admire the years' worth of napkin art on the wall.

When i go to other sushi places, i feel like they skimp me sometime but i never had that problem here. There's a lot of sushi items to choose from on the menu. My favorite has to be the Michigan Roll and the Spicy Salmon Roll. Overall its one of the best sushi place i've had if not, the best.

My first indication that this was going to be legit, was that the sushi chefs were actually Japanese! They were meticulous in their selection of fish and their knife work. The place itself is pretty busy, with many orders of takeout and party trays. As a solo diner I was seated super quickly at the bar. The pricing is on par with other sushi restaurants but the fish is so much fresher! I ordered:-Uni Handroll: I generally never order Uni unless I'm by a body of water, but this Uni was super creamy and fresh! The briny taste was mild and so delicious. Even better than Uni I've had in NYC!- Salmon Handroll: Generous amount of fresh salmon. It was melt in your mouth!- Eel Roll: Simple and delicious. Overall, a very quaint and authentic experience!
