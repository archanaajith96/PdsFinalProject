We got there just after they opened, and the place was pretty full.We had drinks at the bar while waiting to be seated at a table.Their spinach salad with a bacon vinaigrette would make Popeye jump for joy!Mac & Cheese Au Gratin, a side that Poole's is known for is big enough for a party of 4 to share, but it's Mac & Cheese...topped with cheese. It was good, but I've made better.Seared scallops with shrimp stew was very tasty and enjoyable.Coconut cream cake with Clementine marmalade was, I think, a bit heavy on the tart marmalade and a bit light on coconut flavor.It was an enjoyable dinner overall... I'm just sharing my honest opinion."}, {"review_id": "hy5tC0KyYxl18O-B-D-4CQ", "user_id": "gOcjw85B1DUA-Z127WgfGA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Rude. Rude. Rude wait staff. There with two couples and one for a Raleigh newcomer's first time trip for Poole's. Couldn't get a drink and service was terrible. Bathroom were disgusting and employee attitudes were equally appalling. When we complained about the service after the one drink it took us an hour after seating and a trip to the bar to obtain, the waitress cut us off. Clearly, it had to be the single cocktail and not her attitude and poor service skills. Contacting the health department about the sanitation and I would never return. Over hyped and just not worth it. You're wasting your time on over priced, mediocre food with terrible customer service.  We left before getting our food after sitting there for two hours. We left and promptly went to BUKU where we received wonderful service and a delicious meal and cocktails! If you do go, try to avoid Tricia I believe is her name. Unfortunately her demeanor doesn't suit her pretty appearance. Tall, brunette, with a buzzed side. Manager didn't do anything about anything."}, {"review_id": "fneyQl8Q1v4tVfw_j67ihA", "user_id": "4pzWBjiDQukmaN3dsTUyFg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "I was not impressed for all the hoopla over this restaurant. Poole's was very middle of the road and I am stretching that out of the shear goodness of my heart. There is no question they are successfully creating interest by not taking reservations. You have to get there early and get in line. The bar opens at 5 and seating at 5:30. Basically so they can get the crowd tamed and sell an extra drink to you at the bar while you wait. The whole process stinks, but it probably turns more tables. This isn't about what is good for you but what is better for them. We ordered a bottle of white and they want to close out your check at the bar before you are seated. Their POS system was acting up that night, so we could carry the tab to our table, but figure it out. They created this mess of a system, I don't want to close out my tab. This ain't Applebee's. The bartender had no real clue about the wines when asked for a recommendation. Then the bottle (white) wasn't chilled. He put it in ice to cool it. Hack move if you ask me. I expect a place like this to know the proper storage and handling of wine. Prices for the wine were reasonable though. The atmosphere was excruciating loud. The only thing missing was cowboys and lassos to tame the herd. People breathing down behind you while at the bar, people trying to get their name in to the hostess. But overall this place is so loud everyone just has to keep talking louder and louder to be heard. Romantic it ain't. Again, it is trying to be a \"diner\" and wants to create some excitement, but it was simply not enjoyable. Our food was scallops with shrimp for my wife, tuna for me and their pimento cheese and fried saltines. The pimento cheese was great. Best part of the meal. The southern bent fried saltines are as one would expect if you fried a saltine. Like anyone needs to do this. I wanted to try the pimento cheese but anything would have been better than the saltines. They were a bit addictive, bring your blood pressure pills and spread some pimento cheese on a saltine and top with a pill. Both meals were luke warm at best. When did this become the norm for dining?! I had 2 pieces of tuna and one was very good, nice sear. The other piece was junk, probably Charlie Tuna's fat uncle Fester. The rest of the plate was not even memorable. My wife's food was better, but just average and 2 scallops only. She has had more flavorful seafood meals at many other Raleigh area restaurants. There is little reason for me to go back. I can think of 4-5 downtown restaurants I would patronize before I partake in the cattle drive at Poole's."}, {"review_id": "BkxrVa7ijr-EgxcPY_ng7w", "user_id": "WJVedIAJN0FRxDn6M1tLkA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Cute little modern diner with all the Southern fixings one could ask for.

We had brunch on Sunday morning after a 30 minute wait. There is a very small, tight designated area to wait by the entrance. The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside or inside. I was surprised how simple it was. The service has an air of \"too cool\" like other posters have mentioned. We each ordered a mimosa while we waited and there was some issue with the credit card machine so my card was hostage for a bit. I ordered the pancake with fruit and whipped cream; it was a literal pan-cake - dense and thick like a cake. Easily could be shared with another person. My friend ordered the shrimp and grits and said they were good but ordinary. We shared an order of the latkes which were similar to a thick hash brown. I hate to say, but I was expecting more."}, {"review_id": "sNRxKa8KDudGxDZU-_XTUw", "user_id": "oicK5Gh7Sp5wZ5ulsDvMzw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "Poole's is legendary in Raleigh, it comes in pretty high on the best restaurant list with all of the other Ashley Christensen restaurants so in an effort to try each one, I tried this one first.

All I can say is, yum yum yum yum! The food is just spectacular! We are always weary of \"hip\" spots that focus heavily on vibe and trendy menu items (often at the expense of authentic, delicious food). But this place pulls it off! The decor and ambiance is as cool and hip as it gets, without being off-putting. And the food is just incredible! I do wish the seating was a bit more comfortable and there was more elbow room for us larger folks, but hey, I get it.

We arrived around 5:15pm and were told that seating starts at 5:30pm, so we waited about 10-15 minutes before being seated. The majority of the place is taken up by a diner-type of seating. The lighting is dark (FYI for all those who intend to take food photos). The menu is written on the chalkboard up front and in the back. They have only a handful of items to select from each category (appetizer, entree, side, dessert). I had the NC Shrimp (with Anson Mills Carolina gold tomato rice and marinated local cherry tomatoes, $24), and boyfriend had the Short Ribs Au Poivre (with Idahoan potato gnocchi, tobacco onions, and bearnaise butter, $24). Both were great, but we both loved the shrimp over the short ribs. I had a good 10 or so pieces of shrimp that were juicy. I absolutely loved how fresh and flavorful the cherry tomatoes were! There were scattered pieces of vibrant green parsley mixed in. The sauce was light and savory. The short ribs were incredibly tender and flavorful as well, but it was the small portion that disappointed us, especially considering the price. It tasted like roast pork. We had Macaroni Au Gratin ($14) as our side, and it was plenty enough to share. It was very cheesy and filling. The bathroom is pretty cool too. They supply you with all the goodies - bobby pins, hair spray, makeup remover pads, plackers to clean your teeth, and tampons! They got you covered. The bathroom itself is fairly clean too. Street parking is free after 5pm. The staff was attentive and nice. Just wish the prices weren't so high. At the end of my visit, there was a lady (customer) who came over and asked if we were leaving soon. I told her yes, and next thing I know, she proceeded to set her items on the table as if she were about to join me at the table. So I took that as my cue to leave...."}, {"review_id": "Saaz3dNOwcqxYC00utrsDA", "user_id": "qCzhysGVr3v5P7McrBpSbw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/26/2017", "text": "I've never had a bad meal here. Poole's is more of a special occasion place for me as the ticket ends up being fairly high - especially with cocktails, but it's worth it. Food and drinks are both so carefully crafted. They use local ingredients as much as possible and craft new items nightly. Every seat in the house has full service available, which is great as they don't take reservations. I don't see crowds line up I believe because if you're going to go out for a special occasion, you don't want to risk having to wait for hours to get a seat. It is a shame to me honestly, but it's worth the wait if there is a line. One thing has always stuck out in my mind as amazing and that was a simple creamed corn dish which had a splash of sherry in it. I could have eaten that entire dish alone but sadly had to share. Brunch is finally back and it is great. Highly recommended by me. Nothing will disappoint you.Staff is knowledgeable and friendly. You feel welcome no matter who you are and how you're dressed. You can dress up or down to come here and fit in fine. Poole's is about great food, tasty cocktails, and sharing with friends. I enjoy usually a 4 or 6 top so you can experience more than a couple dishes.

From the mushroom croissant toast, to the pork cheek to the scallops to the Mac to the 2 desserts we also ordered because we were completely out of control at this point- all worth every bite and dime.

This is especially true for vegetarians - do not come here for the food! I got the beet salad and the pimento with cheddar cheese, and my boyfriend got the mac and cheese that was all over the Yelp pictures.The beet salad was actually quite decent, except there were pepper flakes all over it that really ruined the sweetness of the melons and the beet. The cured ham is completely stuck to the bottom, and there is no way to eat the ham with the melon (prosciutto e melone, anyone?). The pimento with cheddar cheese was EXTREMELY greasy, so of course you get fried saltines with it. Really? Are they giving you a heart attack on a plate in addition to some extra grease for a bad hair day?As for that famous mac and cheese au gratin that the other reviewers rave about - maybe a 3/5. The crispy top is a nice touch, but there is only one cheese in the mac and cheese. It's certainly rich, but it's also so boring and one-note after two or three bites that you have to stop anyways.

This is pricier than most diner food places, but I think the quality and amount that you get makes it reasonable. Most recently I had the pork belly dish and my boyfriend and I split that macaroni au gratin. I can't go and not get the macaroni -- it's the best macaroni ever, and I'm a big fan of mac & cheese. A lot of the dishes rotate out seasonally, so that keeps the place interesting. My main (pork belly something) was also amazing! Sometimes that type of thing can be too fatty or too over cooked, but this was just right. My boyfriend had a roast chicken dish with seasoned potatoes, and that was also very good. I also had the Italian Greyhound cocktail and was pleased with that.I wouldn't go here with a crowd. They don't take reservations, and it can get pretty crowded at peak restaurant times (e.g. Friday, Saturday). There was no wait when we went Monday, but I've stopped in at dinner-time on Friday and the wait was too long for me. They open for cocktails, drinks at 5:00 but then seat for dinner at 5:30.

After a ho-hum first visit, my second visit was great. I went back on a Monday and early. It wasn't overly crowded (but did fill up). It was much easier to sit at the bar and read the menu and enjoy the overall experience. The bartenders were great. Very tasty menu options made my decision tough, but I went with the seafood stew which was outstanding and ordered bread as a side. Some may balk at paying $4 but they gave me a huge mound of artisan bread slices. I ended up bringing some of it home. Had to splurge with dessert and their berry crisp with walnut ice cream was a delight. My server/bartender comped the dessert for me...not sure if it was bc if they may have associated me with my previous review or he felt sorry for me for dining solo, but it was a sweet and much appreciated gesture. Glad I gave Poole's another try. ------------------------------------I think I need to go back mainly because I think it has potential to be better than what it was. I was there to dine as #tableforone and a group came in and cut in front of me after I had been waiting. I was able to sit at one of their bars which was fine but very cramped. I feel like that night they were really understaffed because the staff was working non stop and doing a great job with a busy crowd. I got sucked in by the yelp reviews and got the Mac and cheese. While it was good, I prefer the version at Beasleys. I DEEPLY regret not getting the mussels. A few people seated near me got them and they looked beyond delicious. So even though I'm giving 3 stars now, I'm optimistic that my next visit will be better."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pooles-raleigh?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
