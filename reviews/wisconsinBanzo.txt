The owner is lovely and he treats his staff with respect. I always eat the chicken but occasionally try something new. I am never disappointed but always end up with the chicken.Tiny space but they manage. I am always pleased with the bathrooms. Hey, that's super important.Check it out.

While I have yet to visit the brick and mortar, I have been to their cart more than a handful of times and have never been disappointed - definitely my go-to when my coworkers and I decide to walk the square for lunch. The food is all made with fresh ingredients, which is noticeable in everything from their pitas to their hummus to their proteins.I regularly order the chick pita, which is chicken tenders in their house marinade, a slaw salad and hummus all inside a pita. You can order a full or half pita and it comes in a little box that makes it easy to eat the pita on the go or back at the office. The big green salad is also yummy. You can add chicken or falafel or both (aka the F-Bomb). The lemon-agave dressing drizzled on top is a must!"}, {"review_id": "PkvvDt0BjWMKRdJ6u8Dp2Q", "user_id": "rSarkkY0J4YhUGf2EOHmuw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "What took me so long to go to the brick and mortar location?  I have been to the food cart before, but this was so much better.  Started with a tasty curry soup and then the F Bomb Platter.  Everything I tasted was delicious.  It is a combination of service / self-service though.  You order at the front counter, they bring your order to you, and you buss your own table.  That didn't bother me though, as the food was so tasty I didn't mind one bit.  I am reserving the fifth star for more visits - as I only tasted a small portion of the menu - but I have high hopes to be back soon and be even more impressed."}, {"review_id": "a1FmyvqxNYkD9EYsUfYuaw", "user_id": "Xwn64gTZJhpV9SkMUkmuzw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "If you like Mediterranean food this is your place.  We were meeting up with family.  Bunny and I and a few others were just getting into town so why not al meet up for lunch.

They've got a brick and mortar that delivers, plus a couple of food carts. I have yet to stop in to their restaurant, but I've ordered delivery a couple of times and have visited the food cart a couple times as well.Things that are great:- Soft, pillowy pita - Smooth and flavorful hummus- Falafel that stays crisp, even when delivery takes awhile- Introducing pickles on a falafel sandwich into my life- Really amazing spiced fries that somehow held up through being deliveredIn addition to their stellar falafel sandwich options, they've got some really tasty marinated chicken and a few other items that you can deliver to your mouth via pita or in the form of a platter with rice and salad. My main small critique is that some serving sizes seem a little off for the cheapest things. The pita sandwiches are huge, but you get literally about a tablespoon of sauce with them in a teeny, tiny cup. Fine for the hot sauce, but such a big serving could definitely use more yogurt so you can have it in every bite. Same with the hummus side. You get an entire container of their amazing hummus, but four small pita slices to go with it. For me, one pita got me through about a third of that amazing hummus. I now know to order extra pita and sauce, but considering the serving sizes it'd be great if the order just came with enough to begin with."}, {"review_id": "_AP-TPcbyH7Wxx6FDBC4ag", "user_id": "pnLFy7olymhwmXqRaDXzpg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "My first time there and really got excited for baba ganoush. It was nothing even similar to what it's supposed to be. I'm truly offended by how bad it was. It's a tiny menu, there's no excuse.Baba ganoush is charred and roasted so it's smoky and has tahini in it. And it's smooth... They served me chunky boiled eggplant with no tahini and no flavor. It was awful.I'm not the only customer who has commented on how bad it is. Guys, try a new strategy and make it correctly and authentically... or rename it - cuz what you served me is not even close. So gross..."}, {"review_id": "4X6nDXJwn5hxRE2Wiwd3HQ", "user_id": "T3TxHHWRJ2hnTwlLeHu1VQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/25/2017", "text": "Choose wisely for 5 star food! I had been to the food cart a handful of times for a quick lunch so after a paddle on the lake we decided to stop in for a late dinner. The restaurant is causal, patrons order at the counter and food is brought to the table. I had every intention to try something not offered on the food cart menu, but I failed. I got the dependable f-bomb platter with chicken. As always, it was delicious! The falafels were perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My friend had never been there before, that was my recommendation to her also. She told me she did not like falafels, so of course I took that as a challenge. She got the kebab, and enjoyed it. Most importantly, she now loves falafels. Friends have tried other menu items and not enjoyed them. My advice to you... get the f-bomb for a great variety of some of their best menu items. We each got the sangria - which was ok and shared the baklava (orange and walnut) - which was amazing! We sat on the outdoor patio which was quiet and intimate. It had beautiful lights strung overhead and made for the perfect spot for us to catch up without the pressure of a server."}, {"review_id": "X1Yh-p8oAQQEJSTuvaJjRQ", "user_id": "xEpLbPbKRJQdxsJN7yehNQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "First time trying and had it delivered.

We were greeted by a couple as we perused the menu by the register. They surmised we were newbies and said we were in for the best middle eastern anywhere. Granted that's in the gut it the beholder. We must have the same guts. If you're in the area, and like muddle eastern cuisine, don't miss this place. It may be informal in appearance, but fear not. It's clean and the food is the best.

This was some of the worst Mediterranean food I've ever had in my life.I ordered the chicken shawarma plate, my friend had the schnitzel,  and we split fried cauliflower with tahini.  My chicken was extremely dry, no flavor, and obviously not made in a traditional manner. Shawarma shares its origins with gyros and tacos al pastor, being roasted on a spit for hours. Generally BURSTING with flavor, and juicy. The salad was ordinary, the rice lacked any distinguishable flavor, the hummus was a tad gritty.My friend's plate, the schnitzel,  followed suit,  was basically burnt and very dry.The cauliflower was the only thing I'd consider repeating, that was decent but not a reason to return. Service was good, the counter person was very nice and helpful.Decor was basically an old house with some paint splashed here in there, you could see it was is need of maintenance.  No coincidence, the lights were very low, I doubt you'd want to see the place in full light.I so wanted to love this place, starting as a food cart, my friend is working on starting his own food truck, and this was research of a sort. If this food passes for good, he has nothing to worry about.With their hundreds of 4-5 star reviews, I doubt they'll even care about mine, but I'm still dumbfounded as to why anyone would think this place was something to rave about."}, {"review_id": "8Gos8iQUAbByMLsHU0Oz4w", "user_id": "MjZQFVOTwYgh49tvlWwCpw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/5/2017", "text": "Overlooking lake Manona is this authentic cuisine, serving food with the right amount of Mediterranean spice.

The hummus, the baba ganoush, the falafel, the pita and the sharwma. This place does serve most of those but not really good ones.Let's start with the GOOD. The Falafel's were fresh and fried to perfection just to ensure the right chewiness from the chickpeas. Pairing it with a tahini sauce which to me had a hint of Coconut was brilliant! A must try for anyone. The Hummus was very good and again fresh.Now the REST. The Lamb platter, albeit in the form of Kofta (a version of Meatballs) were dry, somewhat overcooked and lacked a depth of flavor Mediterranean places are otherwise synonymous for!! The sauce was dangerously close to simply being one right out one of Olive Garden recipes for Marinara. The rice accompaniment was chewy and flavorless. The pita as average at best.What really made a dent in our experience was the average food with an above average price ($15 per platter per person) and a bare bones service. The only thing they did that we didn't was to get our food from the kitchen to the table. That's it. No checking in on how were doing etc etc and taking around 30 mins just to get 2 mains on a almost empty afternoon. If I knew I was going to get Panera Bread service, I'd better pay Panera Bread prices! (By the way, I Love Panera Bread !! )I know it's tad unfair to compare with past experiences, but we've had MUCH better and authentic Mediterranean food elsewhere. Not worth a second visit this one."}, {"review_id": "7ZHkhsah_WmRUpaQwZHM7w", "user_id": "XkXhvRmzyKzTaqXcmfAsXA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/27/2017", "text": "Banzo summed up in one word? Delicious.
