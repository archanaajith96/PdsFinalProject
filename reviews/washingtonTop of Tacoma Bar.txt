We had been staying with family in Poulsbo, and were driving back to the airport for a flight later in the afternoon. On a whim, we decided to stop by Top of Tacoma for a drink and lunch.I wish there were places like this where I live. The drinks and food were amazing and the vibe was great. My wife had a bloody Mary - I don't even like bloody Marys, and it was the best I've ever had.We only had a couple of sandwiches, and they were really good. I've never been to a bar that paid such attention to quality ingredients and nice presentation. It was really top-notch. In particular, my truffle fries were outstanding. I'm a truffle maniac, and almost everyone seems to have truffle fries on the menu nowadays, but these were so nicely done.The staff was really nice as well. You never know how you're going to be treated when you are an out-of-towner visiting a locals place, and the staff at Top of Tacoma did their best to make us welcome."}, {"review_id": "LxCw3-7-xAGo9jRVyy-eSA", "user_id": "4NSBtUDCMITA9p7ZscdyUQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "This was my first time here the other night and my friend and I had a great time they have awesome food a bit pricey but overall isn't everywhere! The bacon bombs were amazing and i had the spicy Alfredo which was super good!!!! It's pretty busy so seating is kinda scarce but other than that it's great food and good atmosphere. If I had to say anything negativeish it would be that I wish there was more room but you can't have everything!The food was out super fast and the service was pretty great too!"}, {"review_id": "TokQB1eRxfahnXE4y1hHPA", "user_id": "zTYjPC7R-ECiJK7pfPRufA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "Discovered this little gem based on a friend's recommendation and came in on a Sunday afternoon. My friend and I ordered and shared their adobo chicken nachos.  Between the two of us, that was plenty. It was so good and filling!Service was great, you basically seat yourself and someone will come to you.  Our nachos ended up being happy hour price which was so cheap. It has a real divey bar feel to it."}, {"review_id": "WIiaW1ouvvhGqKPwbaOSJA", "user_id": "yz0s55qwi_WqVjmbyZ9ICw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "Although a local bar, this is also a solid lunch spot and deservedly busy. The big and varied sandwich menu was impressive - not just for a bar, but any restaurant.When a menu is this large, the quality often suffers, but not here. The variety of meats, breads, and condiments are used to invent an array of classic sandwiches with something extra to avoid being ordinary. The cubano received an upscale boost with the caramelized pork belly, but could have used more belly and less ham along more grilling of the bread. The grilling of the sliced sourdough was the special part of the pastrami sandwich, but had too much deli mustard. The Italian grinder built layers of flavor from the pestos (basil and sun-dried tomato) and cheeses (mozzarella and provolone), but had the odd choice of chicken breast on a barely herbed roll.  The sandwiches come with a choice of generic salad, Tim's Cascade potato chips, or crunchy shoestring fries. Of the three, pick the fries.Not interested in the Red Bull laden specialty cocktails, we ordered lowbrow with $6 shots of Jack."}, {"review_id": "4q4mRqjMsMXuvR-jhRI35A", "user_id": "b4vjVOb6a_eZuN59H9Sp3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "I haven't been here in a while, and I don't know why!

It's not in the most trendy area, I suppose, but maybe in the near future! I actually like the fact that I can park and walk across the street and have good food with no chaos. I got my usual vegetarian field roast tacos and we shared the cheesy bread. Happy hour is from 2 to 6 and then they have a late night one, as well. $2 off for happy hour. Two meals, one appetizer, a cider, and it was $23! Seriously. This place is awesome! I just wish wish wish I could take my daughter here. She is vegetarian and would totally dig it. :/ It is 21 and over. That is literally my only complaint. Otherwise, this is just a cool bar with fantastic food."}, {"review_id": "qY9VlL2hOmGICh0P2S9WyA", "user_id": "wzKesXtpBw-m54-C69bS6A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "$3 mimosa all day on Saturday! Place was crowded but spacious enough to sit groups at tables and hear each other talk. Upon entry on your left, they have a board indicating all their drink specials of the day/week. Got a tray of nachos, there's a small fee if you'd like guacamole with it. I thought it was interesting they served it with ranch along with the obligatory salsa. Will be heading back to try their pho sandwich dip."}, {"review_id": "7dnBsZd77qZA-KH_t-LQ3w", "user_id": "yqtDxO70c2lHmDL2049ttQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "Just fine, not amazing.Based on the hype that I read on Yelp about this place's tacos, I was really expecting something good. These were not good, just ok. I got the steak and it was under seasoned and bland.

Often past 10pm or so you can expect greasy standard bar food. This spot does bar food REALLY WELL. I got their creative spin on a French dip. Super cheesy, a pepper relish that was subtle and really made it exceptional. Nachos were really good as well, except I don't like olives and I missed that detail. Saturday night was busy as I would expect but they were really accommodating about moving from bar to open table. It's very loud when busy so don't go on a date unless you are ready to talk loudly in their face. If I lived in town I bet I would go regularly during chiller hours."}, {"review_id": "thvzFw-pBfrCsEm7lfQP_g", "user_id": "4YzoxU-D-69DlBmx3BbC6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Best service, tacos are awesome.
