Suburban St Louis is short on non-chain dining. Staying at an airport hotel, I found Taste on line and drive over (about 20 minutes).The place is low-lit and inviting. Not loud, but busy on a Thursday evening at about seven. The site warns that diners might have to wait a while (at the bar) for a table. I don't care for bar stool dining and asked to wait.Then they remembered a spot at a long upstairs table, shared by a couple at the other end. No objections on my part and I liked the reduced bustle up there anyway.The drinks menu book had several pages of offerings, and one page of food. My young server was very enthusiastic about Taste and cocktails in general. I wanted a 'Big In Japan' (see photo if ingredients) as I love scotch and this sounded really interesting.Dave, my server suggested that I start off with a special version of the  sazerac that they do, and I took his advice, along with a couple very nice scallion bios it's with chili oil. Dave was right, the combo put me in a great mood.Next came Big in Japan - served in a wide antique style cocktail glass with some lemon peel floating on top. The drink was complex, with hints of herbs, smoky peat, and a backbone of excellent Japanese whiskey.I considered a couple small plates for dinner (their specialty) but asked about the brick chicken. Dave highly recommended it. \"No spices or added flavors during the cooking- just some lemon and the natural pan juices\".The chicken was excellent. There is nothing like chucked seared in its own juices in cast iron. It was pressed on lemon slices and then served lemon side up, cover with capers (love capers) over greens and perfect croutons.I used to consider St Louis something of a culinary backwater. I have been schooled and repent."}, {"review_id": "pGND6snVqtM-UgLWc-0ZCA", "user_id": "1eo6rjqiAiYWeKEUuk1IjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "I took advice from a close friend of mine- \"Go to Taste.

Whoops.Walking in, I immediately feel in love with the romantic ambiance. The dim lighting and exposed brick really made the place unique. My boyfriend and I were able to get a table right away, which is unheard of on a Friday night. We ordered their most popular \"In a Pickle\" pitcher to start us off. The waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful when it came to a dairy-allergy. She steered us in the right direction for all dairy-free menu options. Between the potato skins, wings and Brussel sprouts, I couldn't tell you which dish was my favorite. Nonetheless, our tummy's we're full and our appetites satisfied.  I cannot wait to enjoy the beautiful, summer weather on their patio or even stop by for lunch, but regardless, I will be back."}, {"review_id": "QKX0hOD5uDH78MFKA1qtog", "user_id": "IeffkypfD7-Nv76nrp6Aug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Very nice intimate setting for a close group of friends or a one on one date.

It was wonderful and went back the next night! It is very quaint and hipster with dark \"mood\" lighting. All the food was amazing as well as the drinks! They have one page of food items and basically ten pages worth of drinks. If you are ever in this area - go check this place out!Food: Everything my coworker and I tried was awesome! We had the cheese plate, the brussel sprouts, bruschetta and the biscuits. For my drinks, I got a mint mojito and on the next night the brown derby and another bourbon drink. All the food was cooked perfectly and flavored very well. The cherries that came with the cheese plate were a perfect pairing as well. Ambiance: It is dark and has rustic decor. You walk in and you can feel how intimate it is. It is not too loud and you can still hear the person next to you even though they are always full and there is music playing. You can see into the kitchen on the ground floor which adds to the atmosphere. Service: Service was excellent. Everyone was attentive and very polite. I sat at the bar the next night and the bartender was wonderful and even made my colleague a drink specifically for what she was looking for. We were also lucky because both nights we came in we had minimal waiting time to be seated (less than ten minutes).

We stopped here for drinks after dinner for our anniversary. Walking in, the place looks small and cozy. We grabbed a seat by the window in the front, I wish there was more room at the bar. The bar was a nice wood bar and looked like that happening place that night. We started with two drinks, in a pickle and a nice day in hell. In the pickle was a cocktail made with dill and was so refreshing. I would highly recommend this drink! The other was a jalapeño infused drink, it was spicy but refreshing as well. After enjoying the drinks for a bit, we decided to order dessert. We ordered then brownie with tai basil ice cream, served with blackberries.. this was phenomenal! I would eat this for every single meal if I could. The service staff was amazing, especially depending on how busy it was. Very prompt and very friendly. I would love to come back here for dinner sometime.

This visit was strictly for food and no drinks. Since I was solo this visit I snagged a seat at the bar. The service wasn't bad but the vibe was off.  These new bartenders were not as engaging as the old bartenders that I remembered . Possibly since I only ordered food I guess. I can't believe they took the bacon fat cornbread off the menu. I was directed to try the buttermilk biscuits with smoked honey and pear butter. Unfortunately this appetizer was a miss for me. Tasted liked a dressed up canned biscuit. The smoked honey however was genius and paired nicely with the pear butter. Might I add they were the size of two silver dollars.  For my entree I ordered the pork burger. It's not what I remembered. For $17 there were no depth of flavor. However the patty was juicy but nothing special.  I ordered the burger with bacon and sunny side egg which was suggested. It came with skinny fries that I thought was overly salted and side of ketchup and mayo. The burger lacked creativity in flavors which I felt like I was ripped off. I'm actually disappointed in Taste. Although the the food comes tapas style, it usually packs a punch and leaves you with a lasting impression. Maybe the chef or management changed? ... will I come back? OF COURSE! Anytime soon?....no."}, {"review_id": "JQ3toHleiCDL_TjqltnXFQ", "user_id": "SyABteXA7u_-GA2nKLJ-XQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2017", "text": "Taste is an awesome restaurant/bar/neat little hangout spot. It's perfect for a nice date or to enjoy drinks and food with a great group of friends. First and foremost, they have a full bar and do classic drinks very well. I had my favorite, the NOLA Sazerac. I was pleased with presentation, although they don't make it with the lemon peel in the glass you can definitely smell and taste the citrus in it. Started off with the fried chicken biscuits and bacon fat fried cornbread. Both were yummy and almost addictive. What I really liked was the contrast of flavor and texture on the chicken biscuits. The slaw was perfect and the biscuits didn't fall apart when biting into them. Nicely done. We split a pork burger and fries and also ordered the fried cheese curds. The pimiento aioli was tasty and really enhanced the cheese curds. We added a farm egg to our burger. Cooked to perfection. It was my first ever pork burger, who even thinks to make a burger out of ground pork. There's thick cut bacon on this beast as well. I found it just a tad salty, so I ended up using a little of the housemade mayo on the toasted bun and believe it or not, it cut the saltiness down and made for an enjoyable taste. The fries are amazing! I was disappointed when I saw shoestring fries, but they were crispy outside, tender inside, and seasoned. I could eat a whole plate of these fries by myself. Very well done overall. Brandon was our waiter, he was very knowledgeable about the entire menu, drinks and food. I will definitely be back to check out more of the menu."}, {"review_id": "jXFbOXt-CX1qVxZSDq4xag", "user_id": "whAEXeBczZz78oTGE7UA0g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2017", "text": "I love coming here whether it's for the HH or to celebrate special occasions. If you like nice crafted cocktails by professional people I'm sure you have heard of this place or at least came here a few times like I have. Their menu changes periodically, they always have their staple large plates which are the brick chicken (huge can feed 2 people) and burger. Their small plates are always 5/5 stars for me and they do update these pretty often (perhaps seasonally) and I love that about this place so I can always try something new. Their cocktails are amazing, I like getting the zombie which has a fire on top of your drink and it's pretty strong but sweet (very tiki like drink). They do take reservations for larger groups like I believe 6+ But they are on NoWait app that way you can get your seats without waiting outside. It is a small restaurant with an open kitchen. So I like planning ahead.

Taste Bar has a great vibe and very unique food and drink selections, but its drawbacks are that it's very small (seriously, it's tiny) and it's very loud. My cousin and I had to yell the whole time we were there to hear eachother at the table.  This is definitely a bar. A nice bar, but a bar.We had a charcuterie board and cheese board and liked it so much that we got two of each. I also ordered the cocktail, \"a drink has no name\", which was very strong and left a nice chocolate aftertaste. A lot of the exclusive cocktails here have different herbs, florals, and other elements that you don't find at most bars.We ordered the boards because we had eaten before we arrived at Taste Bar but I definitely want to come back when I'm hungrier to try more of the food menu. A very \"interesting\" couple that were seated next to us last night ordered some potatoes that smelled amazing! Had we been hungrier, we would have ordered them for sure.The service was good but we accidentally got our waitress in trouble when we told the server (and possibly the manager) who brought out our encore of boards that she did a better job of explaining its contents than our waitress who brought the first boards. Oooops! My cousin was paying her a compliment, but she indicated that they are supposed to be thorough with the explanation. Hopefully we didn't get our waitress in trouble because she was great and did give a brief rundown. We just didn't know if there were prunes, raisins, or candied olives in the corner of the cheese board. It turns out that they were bourbon-soaked cherries. *insert awkward face here* After learning what they were, that's exactly what they tasted like! Taste Bar is a nice place to go to for a drink,  where you can also have some nice, flavorful small dishes to nibble on while drinking.  Consider getting reservations though.

Nothing quite compares to Taste and I can't quite put my finger on it, aside from the outstanding cocktails. The Old Fashioned is the best.ever. There is not a drink on their menu that tastes badly. My only suggestion would be maybe to add some mocktails to the menu. (Recovering alcoholics and pregnant friends surround me).The New Year's Eve party is perfect. Not too crowded and perfect amounts of food and booze. In my opinion, it was poorly communicated for 2017 (no email to listserv, no reply when I emailed them to ask, no facebook posting until last minute, etc) and I wasn't able to snag a ticket-it sold out quick, but I will try harder for 2018. That irritated me big time since I had been stalking them for a while, hoping to get a ticket.The place is really hard to get a seat in on almost any night. I just plan to show up right at 5 to be sure. They do use the NoWait app, but I am not sure if that applies to sitting at the bar, which is really the only place you should sit. And the bar has purse hooks! There are coat hooks on the walls.  I'll go for food, I'll go for drink, I'll go to meet with a client, I'll go for a birthday. It's a win-win all around.

Hands down, one of the best bars in the city. The drink menu is expansive and you can truly find what suits your palate. I recommend getting the \"bar choice\" if you're undecided. The bartender will pick a drink based on whatever liquor or flavor you desire. The servers know the menu really well and will help you make the perfect choice. One of my favorite drinks (no longer on the menu, but you can still order it) is the 17th Ward. It reminds me of a citrusy old fashion with orange and grapefruit flavors. A MUST TRY!If you're lucky, the upstairs area in the back will be open. Lit mostly by candles; sit on the comfy leather couches or at a table. Perfect for small to mid-size groups. The menu has small plates, so probably not the best if you're looking to chow down. The french fries are thin cut and come with a delicious garlic aioli  (7 stars). I also recommend trying the deviled eggs, garlic chili potatoes, and bruschetta. The chef pays attention to details and will have your taste buds on cloud nine.
