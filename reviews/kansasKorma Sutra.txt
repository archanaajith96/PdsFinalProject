The Staff here make a pretty big deal about everybody being happy. \" No Angry, just happy! It's a Party Yeah? It's a party!\" our waiter kept saying as handed out samples of food I have no idea what they're called, only that they were delicious!This time around I tried the Lamb Korma, medium because i had no idea of their spice levels and I wussed out. However, next time, i'm going something spicier, especially since they refill your mamgo lassi at no charge!"}, {"review_id": "AvkA0fe7Az9oqS_5dT0OYA", "user_id": "aNTyUpg0EYcPOA7OtB4Y7g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "We used to eat here when this place was Flavor of India. Since we always enjoyed the food that they served, we were hoping for just a new name. Will say the restaurant looks brighter and updated on the inside, inviting. And it was good to see one person I remembered from the old place. We arrived after 11:00 am opening. Lots of people, but no one was eating because the buffet food wasn't out yet. Once a few dishes were put out, the line was long and I waited to help myself. I would like to note that none of the patrons were Indian, Flavor of India attracted many Indian patrons. Not that other ethnicities can't enjoy Indian food.  Just find it interesting that not one diner was Indian. I tried a little of everything offered. That said, was not impressed. Tandoori chicken was very dry. Everything else was bland. And please quit pushing drinks on me that I don't want.   In fact, back away from the table. Would like to have conversation with my husband. One more thing, if I want to see a clown with balloons on his head and a whistle in his mouth, I will eat a Chunk E Cheese."}, {"review_id": "4l9Dq0Kf_DeW5LMtRvyXyA", "user_id": "s5j5TcgSGjwqUvV-zuWNgA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "Food was very bland. Did not taste like Indian to me. Well, I went to this place for a lunch buffet, pricey with very limited options. The only other thing which was an add-on here and something unique was they were serving diluted lassi( i believe they called it, hence I call it diluted... but that was alright ) and the Chai.

The staff did bring more naan and fun ice cream around.  They served amazing chai tea too.  And the funny gentleman did entertain us with balloons and made my son laugh. It certainly is a family friendly small restaurant. I did think the tables are a little too close together, but the food buffet was amazing!  In addition to the traditional buffet favorites (tandoori chicken, butter chicken, lentils, etc) the buffet also had shrimp, goat curry, vegetable mix, and the relishes. The Kheer was especially delicious! It was thick and creamy and my son devoured his, and still had room for more gulab jamun.  We were so hungry I forgot to take pix, but I highly recommend this lunch buffet! We will come back again soon.  The parking here is easy, which is one reason we would come here instead of Westport. For 3 adults and one child the lunch buffet bill was $48 pre-tip."}, {"review_id": "OY7Gy3VhUOv4cKmV0sty3g", "user_id": "E53NwKNZ4DcXmGCRKej8KA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "I dunno what happened!  I had to have reviewed Korma!I love this place.  The owner is always around and always pushing extra food at you.  It is fantastic for dinner and is so much.  I leave absolutely stuffed every time.Perfect for double dates!"}, {"review_id": "BZ1IUzWCvjeWm5kry7dlHQ", "user_id": "SQETlCkPzs6lEVJsFKOZWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "I hadn't been to Korma Sutra in probably 20 years because the location was further away than many other Indian places from where I live. But since it moved, it is now the closest, and my friend and I went to check it out last night. And wow, guys, it was incredible. I said to my friend afterwards that I must have looked like such a rube because of how much I was exclaiming over the service. It was a relatively slow evening, probably because people don't realize that they've moved to the corner of 87th & Quivira, so we were seated right away. We got our orders in (both ordered tandoori style chicken - her, the tandoori chicken and me, the chicken tikka) and the owner, I believe, brought over these little vegetable fritters - I think they were vegetable pakora, upon further review of their menu - to sample. Yum! They reminded us a lot of samosas without the dough wrapper. Then our food came out on sizzling platters. At first I was confused because there wasn't any rice but I was pleased because my friend and I are both trying to eat healthier, so it was the perfect meal. Then the rice came out, with a side of butter chicken. They said the butter chicken was sauce for our chicken dishes. The butter chicken was easily the best version I've ever had, but I disagree with their premise that it is a \"sauce\" for grilled chicken (there are large chunks of chicken in it!) but I will not argue with getting a free portion :) because I would happily have drunk a mug full of the sauce, at which point I would have needed someone to make a call, because I would have hit rock bottom and this would be my cry for help. Anyway, as we were finishing up our meal, they next brought over mango lassis, which is literally one of my favorite drinks on this planet, and it was an amazing rendition. Then they brought over a basin with a teapot of warm water and limes, and did a traditional (I assume) hand washing. AND THEN they brought over some kulfi, which are these amazing creamy, garam masala flavored popsicles, along with chai tea, which were amazing together, since they use the same spices. I think we finally ended with rice pudding with a galub jamun (little fried dough ball) in it. So amazing! By the end of the meal, I was wondering how much it would cost. I didn't think they would charge us, but also couldn't figure out how they would make money giving all this stuff away and was fine paying WHATEVER for the amazing service, which was not only incredibly generous but also so so friendly. We did end up only being charge $50 for the whole meal, my friend had ordered a meal to-go for her husband, so my part was less than $20. Such an amazing value but I'm nervous to step on the scale today! Do yourself a favor and go to Korma Sutra ASAP and go hungry!!"}, {"review_id": "Ef2nAwB5LL76O7ptwQuvLA", "user_id": "3xzqKCX2FVpTates3NwF1Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2017", "text": "I just LOVE finding the little gems in a city.  It's a little embarrassing when the gem is in your own city and has been there a while before you find it...  But hey, better late than never, right?Part of my tardiness has to do with being new to Indian and Pakistani cuisine.  However, now that I've found it, it's near the top of my list.Now to Korma Sutra: this place is amazing!  I don't know much about Indian culture or custom (outside of Bollywood film and dance - which is Faaaantastic with a capital \"F\"), but I will say that I've rarely felt more as family as I did while at KS.We were waited on and served by no less than four people, all of whom were more than warm in their own regard.  One gentleman was high energy and everything he served was \"happy\", as in \"happy chicken\", \"happy lamb\", or \"happy juice\".  One lady was very motherly and took wonderful care of our kids - tucking the napkins in for them, serving them familiar cuisine, and speaking sweetly to them.  The others were always there with water refills, cleaning the table, setting fresh dishes, and bringing fun, complimentary food by for us to try.Between a few small complimentary dishes to try, and the array of appetizers and entrees we ordered and shared, we ate as royalty, and felt as much, too, due to the above-and-beyond service.  We tried no less than a dozen delectable food plates and drinks on our maiden voyage.  Highlights were the butter chicken, chicken tikka masala (with \"medium plus\"-level of spice, which was perfect!), and chicken goa.  We also really enjoyed the warm chai tea digestif. The location is awesome - tucked in the nape of the strip mall at College & Metcalf.  The dining room is quaint and tight, but very adorably decorated, including the windows.  One particular item of decor that made me feel ridiculously vacuous (at myself) was the long line of awards from numerous publications and authorities lining the south wall of the dining room, seeming a metaphorical frown upon me and how long it took to come try this incredible eatery!!  Our return visit will be within a matter of days, as opposed to the years we spent in the dark!Food = 5/5Facility = 4/5Service = 5/5Ambiance = 4/5Value = 6/5"}, {"review_id": "dOH0zMkc2ELGxgJHFtnEag", "user_id": "OqdjlzIiRq5cdwg6Wv7k9A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/1/2017", "text": "They won't stop feeding you here!  Really, they keep bringing treats to your table long after you had your fill of delicious food.I'll agree with the other Yelpers,  the owner makes this a fun place to eat.  From the moment you walk in he's cracking jokes up to when he slips you a handful of deflated balloons at the end.  The only issues I had were the language barriers with our server and the bill at the end.
