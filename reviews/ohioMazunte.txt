I am blown away, especially coming from Los Angeles where the Mexican fare is phenomenal!Stopped in for lunch after my flight and had the Queso Dip and an assortment of salsas plus a Chorizo, Steak and Fish tacos! Super fresh, very tasty and I definitely wanted to eat more. I will be back again on my next visit, perhaps to try the enchiladas!"}, {"review_id": "ppXi9tpY9DKFAQDGCkLdCA", "user_id": "J5BM7NCirfQwDAapJvFuzw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "This place is really small and gets crowded easily. It's about the size of a Chipotle with a closed off deck area and some tables. You go in, place your order and then they bring it to you. It was pretty quick for as crowded as it was. I got a limeaid to drink which was tart but very good. They also have a drink called Jamaica which was a berry drink that I did not like at all. My wife got the dorados which are deep fried tortilla rolls and they were very good. I got mixed tacos which were one beef, one chicken and one pork. They were very good but nothing too special. We split an order of tamales and they were the worst ever with flavorless chicken and mushy masa. Their best and most unique feature is the salsa bar which the is at least six different salsa and they give you about six four inch deep fried tortillas as chips.I'll go back if I'm in the area again but won't travel across town specifically for it again."}, {"review_id": "NN_v8T3z68Kb_LUMAfNY2Q", "user_id": "-bJmA2o0vOVMVMCn5W4MwA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "The food was tasty.

Everything I had was amazing. Fish tacos, chicken tacos, veggie taco, the pazole, guacamole, salsa, rice, beans... I could go on and on! We loved it so much we went back the next night for dinner and their margarita on the rocks was bomb too!  If you're looking for a great place to eat this is the place! Only cons is finding seating for a bigger party.

I was encouraged to go long ago and have not stopped since. They have the most authentic Mexican food here. Every time I eat dine in, I feel as if I've taken a step inside of Mexico for a short amount of time. Their ingredients are all fresh and delicious. My favorite menu items are the fish tacos and chicken tostadas. My goodness, they are amazing! I literally scrape my plate each time. The salsa bar or queso are also both great additions to add as an appetizer. They include huge, house made tortilla chips to scoop with. They actually have good margaritas too! Now for those who have never been, expect a bit of a wait to have a seat if you go during peak hours. But stay....because it is well worth the wait. The food is delivered in a very reasonable time, so you won't be waiting for too long!"}, {"review_id": "JFAO8esgODgIOAmjobBDaA", "user_id": "D_DRoM0JsGM8vbws3K4Hrg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "Finally decided to try Mazunte when we ended up up Norwood on a weekday around dinner. I had heard so many good things about the place and had been wanting to try it. Pros: the food! I had the blue corn quesadilla and it was so so tasty. The portion was huge, too. My husband had the pork tacos and they were equally tasty. The chips were fresh and crunchy and huge. We also enjoyed the variety of salsas. The food is definitely as authentic and tasty as everyone says. Also, the service was super friendly and the prices were reasonable. Cons: I wasn't a big fan of the space or the flow. The restaurant is tiny and there wasn't any seating for 2 people except in the overflow area next door which is a heated makeshift area with communal seating. I also thought it was kind of weird that you order the chips and salsa \"bar\" and have to go up and get your own everything and carry it next door to the seating area. I didn't get a margarita, but that setup looked the same - you serve yourself by salting your own cup and pouring the margarita.  However, because the food was so dang good, I can ignore these cons to an extent and say I'll probably be back again."}, {"review_id": "Vh5Tk_H89Ct31E06X2NyPw", "user_id": "GPhEVZ_SSx3a8ES7ksNYkA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Just went here a few minutes ago for the first time. It's a small restaurant but service is pretty quick. I think they need to redesign the layout because the chips & salsa and horchata bar is right by the door where people are waiting to order while others are trying to get their drinks and chips.Food is delicious and fairly priced I think. I ordered the memalitas (one chicken and one chorizo). I appreciated that I could get two types instead of just one. My boyfriend got the fish tacos. We loved our meal. The chips and salsa were great too:)"}, {"review_id": "bxQg8580jW4hoctbFpZEFw", "user_id": "WkIUxfPBK5ignaNBGxKJqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "I'd say this is the best Mexican food in the city. I don't go here as often as I'd like, but the food is always delicious and I've never tried something I didn't like. There is usually a wait since the inside is pretty small but there are tables outside and it's definitely worth the wait. They have salsa bar where you purchase the largest tortilla chips then can choose any of the salsas your heart desires. You can also watch them make the chips.  They have alcoholic beverages as well as none and its family friendly. We had Mazunte catered for a friends bridal shower recently and the service and food was nothing but great!If you want to try some authentic, delicious Mexican then head to Mazunte."}, {"review_id": "ecCAwfyqw4hsuG0EW_a_WA", "user_id": "Xvv0P_0B57LoyGrVHGG_8A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/17/2017", "text": "Mazunte was really good!! True authentic Mexican food! It honestly took me by surprise because I was use to \"Americanized\" Mexican food so this was different. The food was so flavorful. They also have a cute little balcony connected to the side of the establishment for outside eating. The day we went was nice so we ate outside. The staff was also very nice and helpful, considering it was my first time coming here. My husband and I ordered the Chicken Enchiladas, Chips & Salsa, and Street Corn. The Chicken Enchiladas were very good. The tortilla was on the bottom and seemed to be filled with some type of stiffer cheese. The Chicken, sauce, and pickled onions were on top. You could tell the tortilla was homemade. This dish was packed with flavor. The Chips & Salsas were good as well. They make their chips homemade. We tried 3 of the salsas. My favorite was the Pico de gallo and the medium red salsa. I didn't really care for the roasted tomato salsa. The Street corn was amazing! The best street corn I have had from a restaurant. It was grilled perfectly. It was tender but had the perfect crunch. The sauce and cheese were just the cherry on top! Definitely try it! Overall, Mazunte was very good and we will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "Ht8mEjXcBVFaOu30poMbsg", "user_id": "spBUNw8nk2k8PP3wAjcWsQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/5/2017", "text": "Both times I came here I had the chorizo memalitas and thoroughly enjoyed it. There is often a wait but you can munch on unlimited chips with a terrific diversity of delicious salsas. I want to come here more often but it's just a little too far.The chorizo was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The rice that comes on the side is made in what is presumably delicious broth.

Seriously. Nothing on the menu is not outstanding.   Judging by the constant line of 20+ people - we're not the only ones who think so! Kinda weird that they doubled down on this location by building a pavilion for seating that overlooks parking lot and car wash - but whatever works, I guess.  You have to be prepared to wait  in line but they make that easier by letting you buy and drink margaritas while you're waiting! Guacamole is insanely delicious, but priced like gold bouillon. Can't wait for summer when the grilled corn is available again.  Yum!!!!"}, {"review_id": "ExItdV2kliMT8SPb_WzrVw", "user_id": "hobAmWvt0QkVzMbZBufoYQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Authentic Mexican!

We got there right at 11am when they open and there was a small line outside, which, is always a good sign! They have a lot of options, which made it difficult for me to order due to being so indecisive, so I opted to try 2 chicken tacos and 1 chorizo taco, we got queso (duh!) and the salsa bar. They make their tortilla chips homemade, which they end up being very large, so you have to break them up yourselves. The food was outstanding! Great flavor without a TON of toppings and without trying to be too fancy. The salsa bar was really great when you want to try a variety of flavors/heat. We did not stay long, but the atmosphere was wonderful for being really small. We found a seat and it wasn't too loud for how many people have to sit so close together.

Everything is so fresh and good, like something you'd find in California. We went on a Thursday for dinner and had the corn, guacamole with chips, fish tacos, steak tacos, and blue corn chicken quesadilla. Everything was cooked perfectly and packed full of fresh flavor. Their guac was exceptionally good. The margaritas were a little too sweet for my liking, but I love that they offer them.When you go in, you'll order first and then grab a table. We were there for about 45 minutes and the line was wrapped around the inside of people waiting to order. A sure tell sign that the food is amazing is if people are willing to wait that long.
