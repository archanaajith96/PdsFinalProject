Also, the avocado pear salad which was delicious.Followed by our entree of Idaho trout and crab.  Each bite was savory and if I could howl I would.  Juicy and the flavors paired well together.  Also, we had the seafood mixed grill - surprisingly this was outstanding too.We were not able to have dessert as we were stuffed to the max.One of the best fine dining in Missoula and beautiful atmosphere.  Dreaming to return.   Entree"}, {"review_id": "YaScY7zt7rPu5gbZOOIwdg", "user_id": "iRJ9r8fXduur7-f-tziaaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "love this place.  love that it's owner operated.  probably best fine-dining in the city of Missoula.  only wish they had a full liquor license :("}, {"review_id": "BYPpSeNv5eyp77H7a2ZQtw", "user_id": "ez64nH6syIVIwOdhiMBtmg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "We love this place!  Owner-operated!  She works both front and back of the house, and it shows!  Lovely ambiance.  Filet was fantastic."}, {"review_id": "1m_VEU4DRNBbTYZMMdAkFg", "user_id": "wSRab1UQWCmlPz9SNtw3yg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/12/2017", "text": "Quite frankly one of the best meals I've ever had.

Been here on two different occasions and both times it was above and beyond. The atmosphere is very nice and the food and service are also amazing. Both times I have been here I have been with larger crowds and both times the service was outstanding and the food was served at the same time (which isn't always the case with a large group). Also, this place is a dream for someone who is Gluten free. They do not have a specific menu but all you have to do is ask once and the server is able to tell you exactly what is gluten free. I have never tried ordering something they couldn't make gluten free. I would highly highly recommend this place! I will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "sagJFT0Z090YUIvY4tJzGQ", "user_id": "uohlNA5m0pu9wTs2Fd6TDQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/29/2017", "text": "YUM. Happy to come across this place after a long road trip to Missoula. Unexpectedly fresh food and surprisingly tasty arrangements. We had the escargot in mushroom caps which presented well but had a funky taste in my opinion. For entrees we split the trout and filet and both were fantastic. The trout had a delightful butter sauce and these roasted grapes that were a delightful burst of flavor. Everyone there is busting their ass and you never go with your water unfilled or a quick check in. Absolutely recommend The Pearl for a delicious, fresh meal that is worth every dollar."}, {"review_id": "ngzt51zGaCc3LRsAwIfdew", "user_id": "psLlvy7eQ4k5gvysmHlvrg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/6/2017", "text": "This is THE place to go in Missoula for any special occasion.

Ambiance was very nice, service was excellent and the food was very good. I'm only giving them a four instead of five because I wasn't super impressed with the trout/crab dish.

Country fare with city flair is the perfect way to describe this dining experience. From the great service to the fresh ingredients and a consistently excellent rotating specials menu makes this restaurant easily our favorite \"splurge\" spot, appetizer and dessert spot in Missoula. Add the beautifully paired wine list and you have the perfect storm of a French inspired cafe. Award winners for me are always the Ginger Scallops, Smoked Trout, French Onion Soup, Seared Duck, Salmon with Mustard Butter and their desserts are easily my favorite. Have I ever mentioned I never order dessert either? The Dark German Chocolate Cake is outstanding. Environment is comfortable, quaint, and so inviting. You'll feel at home in a fine dining setting. A comforting meal surrounded by a beautiful setting.

As a 32 yr veteran restaurant manager, I always look at the inner workings of a restaurant. Check out the kitchen, dirt behind the ladies room door, how the servers interact, etc. Pearl Cafe? Can't find a complaint! My 1st trip here (had heard MANY great referrals), I watch the servers extreme attentiveness (but NOT overbearing) to ALL tables, not only their own, clearing plates, etc. As the night got busier, they ramped up their game,  all helping each other. Went on a Wednesday. I asked our server to speak to the manager (owner), only to be told she (Pearl) was not there this evening! Sign of a great manager, in my eyes! Oh, and BTW, the food was OUTSTANDING!! $100 night for 2 (with tip) for us and definitely worth it!!"}, {"review_id": "RsNk3y-c5-Ui6yh955g2Dg", "user_id": "C5J_lfViodIQDOdZrHPd4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/16/2017", "text": "I did the online reservation which is pretty slick.

Pearl, the owner, is first class, known for the best soups and sauces.

Their service is first class and professional, and the ambience is intimate and inviting. I never feel the need to order dessert after a meal at Pearl's, but if I skip a starter, or if it is a special occasion, I have to have her frozen white chocolate mousse pie with Oreo crust and raspberry drizzle.
