I went on Sunday night with a friend, and we sat for about 15 minutes before anyone noticed us. Which was weird because we were near a waiter station and staff walked by maybe two dozen times and no one noticed we didnt have menus or water.I finally flagged down a manager who seemed to be on the ball. He was great and got our drinks, but the server was underwhelming (and unapologetic) and did not bring plates for the appetizers we were sharing. (I had to get up and find the manager to get plates.) We were pretty much ignored the rest of the night.The food was okay. We had the crab jalapenos, brisket poutine, and avocado fries. Maybe if the service was less miserable, the taste would have improved.The dozen flies buzzing right next to our table didnt help, either."}, {"review_id": "UF6Z0S-Q4NZd764IkdCtdQ", "user_id": "efUKYe_AJhCHz9s-9ZbYaw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "UPDATE.2:Service is fantastic (Ren the manager went above & beyond, and turned a misunderstanding into a serious positive), menu is updated and even better. The Sunday afternoon first choice.  Update:Fantastic response to a previous and rare unfortunate experience.  Got a personal response that was sincere and a heartfelt attempt to make it right - I am so glad to see such professionalism in a local business! Will definitely be back. Soon. I love the food - and I've had a couple really good experiences here...This time is frustrating - it's Sunday afternoon and it's almost empty, and I ordered for me and my three sons as soon as we were seated.  At 330 exactly.  40 minutes later, we had received an appetizer only, and several tables near us had received their food/entrees. Three boys, at a table with very little food for 40 minutes.  I don't expect miracles but I expected my food before then. I finally flag down the server and get the items TO GO - and then get a bill at 4:08 for all of it. Thanks to the manager for expediting my checkout at full price for food I get to eat COLD. Pissed off and over this place."}, {"review_id": "VhzPvVygN2IkYY8OZhkcEQ", "user_id": "lNYz33dEk-l7CwTH7YdUhA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Have since had the \"Peak 3\" burger with fries and the halibut tacos with chips & salsa. The burger is bomb, fries too! I'm clearly in love with their burger blend of ground chuck, brisket, and shortrib. It's seriously amazing.The halibut tacos are delicious, with plenty of halibut (cooked perfectly)! The salsa on the side is more like a very chunky pico de gallo, slightly difficult to dip their thin tortilla chips in. While the tacos are delicious, I could do without the giant mountain of slaw on top. The slaw separates the salsa and sour cream from the taco itself, so it's difficult to get all in one bite. Would be a perfect taco without the huge pile of cabbage(?) on top. No picture, as it was dark for a show."}, {"review_id": "OysxvpKWxR5oYGevdBXWpQ", "user_id": "PLmdtBo-L4N4YCeUoo2nKg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Came here on a work trip. Was able to try Yak for the first time. The views were fabulous and that's about it. To be fair to the server, we had a very very large group with us. But that doesn't mean that it should take an hour and a half to order and get our food. We had gone earlier in the evening (4pm) to avoid that problem. Seafood chowder was not my cup of tea. To the point that I didn't even eat more than a spoonful. The Yakadilla was good. But really just a ground Yak in a quesadilla. Pretzel was highly recommended and beer flights are nice. Overall...I think this would be a better place to go with a smaller group. But I don't think I'll be going back next time I'm in town."}, {"review_id": "wTceeF3ArQfNqKwjI03ozQ", "user_id": "HNkIWjQfYDRMCIbT5BRo-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "We ate here twice during our visit to Anchorage from the lower 48. The service was fast and friendly, the atmosphere was modern and casual, and the food was delicious!! The first time around we ordered the Yak-a-dilla (yes, real Yak!) to share and it was delicious!! This dish was full of flavor and the spicy mayo drizzled on top was the perfect complement. We both ordered a bowl of their famous seafood chowder but were so full from the Yak-a-dilla we could barely finish the bowls. The chowder was also full of flavor and big chunks of seafood, we were so sorry to not finish the bowls. The next night we go the yak-a-dilla again (you simply must try it) and the buffalo chili (this time just a cup). Both were delicious! In addition to the great food is also a huge assortment of craft beer. You simply can't go wrong here. If you're visiting, head here early in your trip so you can come back again (trust me, you'll want to).

The place was pretty busy with one table of probably 15-20 people. I guess that's why it took over 45 minutes to receive our dinners. The food was pretty tasty, but mine came with fries and there couldn't have been more than 10 fries on there. Sure I could have complained, but should I have to? The waiter was pretty sharp, but he seemed quite busy and disappeared for 10-20 minutes at a time. Two of the three dirty dinner plates were never even cleared.

Super friendly service, and they checked on us many times. May take a while for the food depending on how busy they are.The burgers are best in Anchorage, and the mac & cheese will depend on how cheesy you like the cheese. The Mt. Magnificent was really big, but also really good.The service was really nice, and complimented us a lot, and is more cheap than most fancy restaurants in Anchorage. You can also get a great view if you sit outside or on the second floor.My only concern was how long it took for them to make the food. It took 30 minutes to cook the food. The service checked on us multiple times though, and they entertained us, so the wait wasn't that boring.A nice place to eat, and I'm definitely coming back the next time I visit Anchorage.

Many people had recommended 49th State, so it was our first stop when we arrived in Anchorage. We tried a few beers and all of them were awesome. I was impressed by the awesome descriptions of each beer on the menu. We started with the short rib poutine which blew my mind. It was perfect! The short ribs were extremely tender and flavorful and the cheese was melty and warm. This was by far my favorite part of the meal! We also enjoyed the crab ravioli appetizer & the Mt.

I thought the food was good, and so were the drinks, but it wasn't hey-I'm-traveling-from-south-side-just-to-eat-here good. I came here recently and found it surprisingly partially filled for a Friday night at 8PM. I'm on a quest for the best bowl of French onion soup and this place is at the bottom of the list for recommendation. It was served in a typical bowl, but there was scant cheese and bread. The worst of it was that it was beyond salty, and the soup was very tepid. I asked the server to warm it up and she took it away. When she came back she said the cook tested the temp at 170 deg. False, I know what 140 deg is and it was not that. So, she comes with a new one and said cook remade it and it's 150 deg (left me wondering what happened to the 20 deg, but whatev). I ate it, but will not order it again. I thought it was nice that the floor manager stopped by to ask how everything was after the food send-back.
