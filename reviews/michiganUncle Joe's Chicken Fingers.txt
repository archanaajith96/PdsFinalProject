Chicken tenders and wings were excellent. I've eaten plenty of chicken tenders and wings and this place hands down knows how to fry chicken. Did I mention their special sauce you need to try it trust me you'll be glad you did another sauce that is made by them is their RANCH if you like ranch you need to try it now!!  The sweet siracha sauce was my least favorite it was spicy but it just didn't taste that good.The fries were super crispy and how can you go wrong with Texas toast. They offer sweet tea and unsweetened tea along with a soda machine. We waited more than usual for a fast food drive thru restaurant but at least it was fresh so expect a wait. Will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "FPr7z5RZ1qM0zLKWIS8OuA", "user_id": "zQyZ1qD2AOv7G0TeWwA9hQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "This chicken melts in your mouth. It's the best.

I've really only had two experiences where the chicken fingers were not overly breaded or super dry. Uncle Joe's chicken fingers are crispy pieces of chicken that are super juicy and tender on the inside. The fries are steak fries (which I have never been a fan of) but Uncle Joe's is the exception. The fries are crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. The Uncle Joe's sauce is super delicious - a concoction of sweet, tangy, and spicy. The Texas Toast that comes with the combos is delicious as well. Uncle Joe's reminds me a lot of Raising Cane's which is one of my favorite chicken finger places to eat at. We have always had excellent service whenever we have visited and I would highly recommend you give Uncle Joe's a try!"}, {"review_id": "lZbDSQtrl54uBgyMx88YfA", "user_id": "HbZghHl_Ve92HE5e1migQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "This place rocks, I've never had any issue, and there is no false advertising. What you see is what you get, and what you get are some awesome chicken tenders that you won't find anywhere else around. I usually get the 4 finger special which comes with fries, coleslaw and a giant piece of Texas toast. I promise that if you order this you will not go home hungry, I love this place and recommend it to anyone who's a chicken fan."}, {"review_id": "xLB2wiFI1gEeQ_6eMGK9kQ", "user_id": "6TQGtKtFJz1zvfG8QJspyw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "Chicken fingers are to die for; Joe's dipping sauce is the bomb. Dip your Texas toast in it too, you won't be sorry!  1 star deduction for how dirty the dining room is; seriously needs a good scrub down.

I can honestly say that this was the worst chicken strip expirience of my life. How does one screw up chicken strips one may wonder? Well, you start by not seasoning the strips and then allowing them to sit until they are pillow soft instead of crispy. This tastes like the offspring of a mistake I made at home once when trying to season my flour first like I see on t.v and using too much flour/not enough seasoning. Even if they were crispy like a strip should be, it being totally devoid of flavor sealed the deal for me. The side of bread was most edible."}, {"review_id": "QHre50l4vHJtbuarMJvBSw", "user_id": "oFeLPMJrtwBNpBbHE1-SWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/28/2017", "text": "The chicken fingers were so good I didn't even NEED the dipping sauce.

I love chicken fingers so this seemed like a good option. However, I was met with disappointment due to several reasons.1) the service was poor. The cashier was fairly unenthusiastic and slow. 2) the food was poor quality. Although, good in portion size, the fries and fingers made me feel a little sick due to the greasiness level. I felt uneasy after eating the first chicken finger. 3) the food was clearly not fresh and the fries were cold. For the price of $7.99, I would prefer a McDonald's combo over the meal I had at Uncle Joe's."}, {"review_id": "4p70sawGIgNFb6cLXX-4Jw", "user_id": "kB7O8t_z1cVdH8CbsJ4cqA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/21/2017", "text": "In town visiting family for the weekend and needed some grub before bedding down. We were told about this place so we drove through last night just before closing and got 2 starter combos and a half order of onion rings. A good amount of food for the money for sure: 3 tenders, fries and a slice of Texas toast as well as a cool beverage to wash it all down.Unfortunately it did seem like the fries and onion rings needed the oil changed as they had that \"old oil\" taste. I doubt they would justify that though as they closed midway through prepping our order. Also personally not a fan of the provided sauce, wish I had asked for a different sauce instead.Overall a little disappointing but still promising. We would try again during an earlier time as the tenders were pretty good overall and they have many other desirable items."}, {"review_id": "7R8MslTnEswIEZ83757ryQ", "user_id": "RuW2A8rvV1Xso9EaVx6r0A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/26/2017", "text": "Chicken strips and chicken sandwich were delicious.

The fries, the chicken fingers, the tilapia, the sauces, the price. I cant decide which gets the #1 spot, because they're all practically perfect in every way. It's never too packed in there, which makes me both sad and happy. Happy I don't have  to wait, but this place ought to be a 45 minute wait for how delicious everything is. My boyfriend and I go here probably twice a month. We split the uncle joe's combo and it's the perfect amount of food for the two of us. If you're obese, you could probably handle a joe's combo solo. I love Uncle Joe and his chicken fingers.
