Food came out quickly however the lines to order said food were long. We were seated quickly once our order was placed. The food tasted as fresh as the ingredients used. We ordered the smoked salmon plate & The Beef sandwich. The smoked salmon was amazing. The capers were fresh, salty tangy perfection. My only complaint would be that with all three servers running around, once your meal is served, they do not continue to check on you. You are responsible for refilling your own water or going back to the counter to refill your coffee. Even so, I will be back. The food was delicious and I'm eager to try more."}, {"review_id": "uzjWk4BbKCTy25O1ZlKr_A", "user_id": "SRmrDSTqX7JsC05CJCw8jA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "One sentence sums it up: The grove is a hipster haven! In this day and age everyone wants a personal spin on dishes restaurants have to offer, which the grove does well. Gluten intolerant? Vegan? Pescatarian? Vegetarian? They've got you! A must try is the kale side salad, the bread crumbs give it a surprising crunch you didn't know you needed! They're food is delicious; and who doesn't love a customized mimosa to wash everything down with? I would give this place five stars but I do feel it's somewhat pricey for the amount of food (not quality). The outdoor patio is beautiful, especially now that ART is done! Watch the hustle and bustle while enjoying a fresh organic lunch! Wish they were open for dinner but hey we can't all be perfect! Anyways a must try for brunch and the staff is always friendly!"}, {"review_id": "WM95YVDv_1JVnfGSX-IJ_w", "user_id": "yR1HEgxVTbBfv1Yg_BuYRw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "The Grove is THAT place talked about in hushed, reverent tones around Albuquerque for brunch, breakfast, and lunch. You won't find much advertising because this is the kind of place packed with locals every single day of the week. Everyone already knows about it and if you are a true ABQ insider, so do you.The Grove has the best of the best when it comes to fresh, local ingredients and fantastic dishes. People rave about the sandwiches and pastries. Is parking impossible? Yes. Are there long lines and table waits? Absolutely. Is it worth it? You betcha.This is weekend brunch favorite spot in Albuquerque and the gourmet flavored mimosas have a lot to do with that! Definitely make the lavender lemon mimosa your priority, no matter which entree you choose!"}, {"review_id": "Hw0JO2xkuweb9dNmNR4WQw", "user_id": "UnUwWCaogyBensnLItiSkg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "A colleague referred this place to us when he found out that my husband and I are going to Albuquerque for the weekend. And I must say that I'm glad that he did.The Grove is a spacious restaurant with outdoor and indoor seating. It's a clean place with a lot of natural light coming in. We went for brunch last Sunday and there was a pretty long queue at the counter to place an order. Having said that, the line moves pretty quick. My husband and I met this lovely couple behind us in the queue who were regulars at The Grove and recommended some really good dishes.So we ended up getting the AVOCADO TOAST and a BREAKFAST BURRITO. So I was expecting a simple toast and avocado topped with salt and pepper. But what I got was a treat for the eyes and for the tongue. The toast was generously coated with a thick layover of avocado topped with a boiled egg and some colorful veggies. There was also a salad on the side which was fresh and flavorful. The presentation of the dish was also very well done.Now the Breakfast Burrito is definitely one of the best Burritos I've had so far. The unique combination of green chilies and goat cheese to the usual fare makes it a winner of a dish.The overall experience was enjoyable and the food was delicious. I'd highly recommend The Grove for a nice relaxed Sunday brunch."}, {"review_id": "ElX3TolRlnIA1sCAn7a5cQ", "user_id": "fKUcl6xEWHlJZm0HKQwQtw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "This was straight Aces for me across the board!!! Hip atmosphere, energetic and responsive counter help, a stellar menu, and a case chock full o' tasty baked temptations to kill your diet.I ordered the breakfast sandwich *gruyere, bacon, arugula, mayo, fancy hot sauce, over easy egg on a house made english muffin....Lawd have mercy...my belly was so happy. And the kale salad was seriously fantastic. I also was over the moon with their strawberry rose cupcake, and hibiscus kombucha from The Kombucha Project. Guys, this entire meal was totally orgasmic and I am so eager to return for some other menu items.

I got the smoked salmon breakfast and a golden milk latte- YUM. The smoked salmon came on a large fresh homemade English muffin and had zested lemon! Easily the best lox breakfast thing I've ever had. Haven't had many golden milk lattes but boy this one was delicious. My boyfriend got the breakfast burrito; scrambled eggs, sausage and green chilies. Also dang good. Could've done without the goat cheese but that's probably just us. We were headed to White Sands and some wildlife refuges along the way so we also grabbed to-go sandwiches. We got the mozzarella and a lemon herb turkey sandwich. The mozzarella was a classic yummy sandwich but the herb turkey was something else. It had a lemon jam that makes it sweet. It was so so yummy. If we weren't here for such a short amount of time we would definitely go back. If I find myself in ABQ again we're making time for the Grove."}, {"review_id": "i_MnO5rQxvK5jNa-fA7oRw", "user_id": "4fvHEE5Cs9l1l4fQ-WLGjQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Great place for Sunday brunching!

It was a perfect abq day! I've been here several times and haven't been disappointed. This time I ordered the egg white frittata. It was delicious! Other items at our table include the turkey toastie, salmon, breakfast burrito and croque madam. We all enjoyed our meals. Every other table ordered the mimosas, wishing I ordered one!

This is a gentle place with some of the very best breakfast and lunch food around.I never thought that I would write words of praise for the lowly Tuna Salad Sandwich. Grove Café raises this creation to heights that I could not have imagined -- an art form. Served on lightly toasted bread of your choice, it is as close to perfection as you are likely to get anywhere. Neither too dry nor too wet, the tuna mixture is just right. Goldilocks would have loved it. This old white-hair sure did. Jane raved about her salad.The beautiful grandchildren here were quietly eating their food, clearly enjoying it too much to indulge in boisterousness. Grandma kept smiling at them.

After a bit of a struggle to find parking (we ended up in the dirt lot across the street) we went in. There was a bit of a line for food, but it moved quickly and gave us some time to decide on brunch options and beverages. We ordered and were given a card to take to our table--they had a staff member helping to direct people to available seating, which was nice. The food came out pretty quickly, and I was very impressed with all of it! I had the soup of the day, a carrot ginger, which was incredible and totally full of flavor. The three cheese sandwich was awesome and a great pairing with my soup. I washed it all down with a hibiscus tea, which was also super yummy. I forgot that this was a filming location for Breaking Bad until I got here (I had bookmarked it because of the good reviews and the menu looked perfect for brunch) but it was neat to look up the screenshots from the show and see you were sitting in the same places.

It was packed to the brim with a 20+ minute line to order, and all of the food getting brought out to the dining room looked fantastic. The vibe of this restaurant transported me to Portland, OR. All of the ingredients were organic and local, with most sauces and breads made in-house. I also noticed the boatload of Portland based goodies while in line, such as Moonstruck Chocolate and Jacobsen Salt. This place is definitely trying to be trendy and a bit hipster, but they pulled it off quite nicely. I ordered a breakfast burrito with sausage, green chiles, goat cheese(!), and scrambled eggs with a side of salsa. It was good, but not rock your socks off delicious. The sausage was well seasoned, albeit a bit skimpy on the portion size. The green chiles and goat cheese added some heat and saltiness to the scrambled eggs, but I found the eggs to be a tad under-seasoned overall. The salsa helped the overall flavor of the burrito for sure by adding some acidity and additional heat to the dish. Looking around in the restaurant, I noticed that other dishes here looked huge and very well put together. I think that if I'm ever back in Albuquerque, I'll definitely try this place again but I'll order something different instead."}, {"review_id": "2zGitvR7aOAK1dtbnPG6ow", "user_id": "RPwAILIzdEk5rhBaLQEDQQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "Delicious breakfast spot.

Time your visit accordingly though because this place gets crowded!I have been to The Grove so many times. Here's what I ate this time: +FOOD+-    Chopped Salad (5 stars): Oh my god! This was such a good salad! The ingredients of this salad were clearly fresh and of high quality: all the vegetables were crisp and the cheese, bacon, and turkey were SO good. I was delighted to see that the hard boiled egg was perfectly cooked, the yolk lending a wonderful creaminess to the exciting mix of textures in this salad. Nothing was too big to fit into my mouth-- I didn't have to do any awkward mouth acrobatics to fit a piece of lettuce in. The homemade ranch dressing is also really good. Also there is so much salad in one order, you might have enough for another meal. There are so many great flavors that all go deliciously well together in this salad. Order it!!-    Market Special - Braised Pork Sandwich w/ pickled green tomato chow chow, winter slaw & spicy garlic aioli on toasted brioche (4.5 stars): Succulent pork meat complemented by tangy pickles and accompanied by a delicious side of kale salad. -    Toasted English muffin with butter and strawberry lemon chia jam (4.5 stars): Needed a touch of salt, but a soft, slightly tangy with the right amount of crisp English muffin that I slathered strawberry jam on, which upon eating reminded me of warmer summer days. Yum yum yum!!+EXPERIENCE+Food came out in about 15 minutes. Despite the number of people, I could still hold a conversation with my mother across the table. You can't beat The Grove's atmosphere with the ample amount of natural light and constant crowd of hip ABQ brunchers. I've only ever had one bad meal at The Grove -- a French toast special. However that was an anomaly experience because I still keep coming back!I will always come back here.
