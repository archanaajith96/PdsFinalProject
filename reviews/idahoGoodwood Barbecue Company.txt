I honestly can't think of a thing I'd change, taste-wise. I don't like my ribs drowned with sweet sauce; it doesn't need it, with the juicy (not the leanest cut but ribs are not meant to be) meatiness dominating the flavor zone.

The food is just ok, not great, not memorable, just ok. No one at my table loved their food, it was just average tasting BBQ but an above average price point. I've been twice & both times my dishes were just meh. On my last trip my brisket was really dry & the sauce was way too sweet. The sides were decent & service was average.

It's probably the only thing that can get me away from the Delmonico.This place is always really busy, tends to be loud which is awesome if you have kids because they can be rowdy without bothering others.

Usually sit down bbq places do good sides and average BBQ or they do 1 or 2 items good and average every else. Well thus is what I noticed here. The sausage was really good, the chicken, I've had much better and the burnt ends, well just ok. Cornbread muffins very good. I'll go back and try the pulled pork and brisket and update my thoughts on this place.

It's extremely close to Texas Roadhouse and you'll find that it's a bit slower than Roadhouse because it's bit more expensive. The quality selection of ribs is very appreciative and the non barabaque options are also very delicious.

I was there on business for a few days and on my last night in town I got a craving for BBQ. Goodwood didn't disappoint.  The place is really nice looking both outside and in and I wouldn't hesitate to host a birthday, work event, or anything else there. It's just a classy looking place when you consider the price point and location.  I ate a pulled pork sandwich and small Cesar at the bar and watched Monday night football. It was fairly quiet and intimate in there but the TVs were up plenty loud to hear the game. I didn't partake but there is a full bar and the staff was attentive. Food was out fast and was hot and tasty though I still don't get why people can't discern that if you order a salad with a sandwich you probably want them to come out together. Parking was also abundant and convenient to the restaurant. I'd absolutely recommend this place. It seems very versatile from having a couple of drinks watching the game to Sunday dinner with family, it does it all."}, {"review_id": "LyTCox3dd4i4PG-s-_LzdA", "user_id": "5TAO3qLogadGusKhpcMFTg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/10/2017", "text": "Really good food but the prices are just way too high for what you get.

Don't look at me cross-wise; you know it's true. Anyway. I'm a native Texan. Beyond that, I'm a native South-Central Texan. I've eaten bbq in places like Austin, Houston, San Antonio, Luling, and Lockhart, where you walk to the counter, order, and get it on butcher paper. I've learned from the absolute best in the business. I know what the Maillard Reaction is, and why it's critical if you want a smoke ring. So when I say that I know bbq, believe me, I know it. So now that I've established my credentials, let me say that on Saturday 18 November 2017 I got some damned good Q at this place. I walked in shortly before 4pm, ravenous since I hadn't eaten in 24 hours. Not my choice. Anyway. I was seated immediately, and my server appeared almost immediately. I ordered a Deschutes Black Butte Porter ON TAP. I've never seen this particular beer on tap anywhere, and it's one of my favorites. Extra star for that. The place was clean and comfortable, and the televisions placed strategically around the dining area were still fairly unobtrusive. It only took me a moment to decide what I wanted: the 2 meat combination. I ordered brisket and sausage; the first because for me the true test of any place is their brisket, the second because they claimed it was German style smoked sausage, and I've been eating that all my life and love it. I was disappointed that brisket cost extra to get, but you can't win all the time. I also ordered the cole slaw and steak fries. My plate arrived fairly quickly. I received one sausage link and maybe 6 ounces of brisket. Slightly disappointing on the portion size, but then it's possible I was ordering off the lunch menu. I'm pretty sure I overheard a server telling someone the portions get bigger after 4. The slaw was...interesting. It has peanut butter in it to add to the creaminess, though I couldn't taste it. The fries were fries. The sausage was excellent. It was peppery, which is exactly what I was hoping for. The skin was crispy, while the filling was tender. I could even see the smoke ring. It went well with the cup of sauce I received on my plate. The brisket was also extremely good. It was tender, but not dry at all. I had hoped to receive a few pickle slices and raw onion with it, but that's just how we do it in Texas. All told the damage came to just over $20. Not bad, but a little pricey considering I had one beer and the 2 meat combo. I walked out full and happy, but I would have preferred fewer fries and another ounce or two of brisket. Regardless, considering this place is a chain, I was impressed. That's hard to do. I'll be back in Meridian at some point in the future, and if I have time, I'll definitely be back here.Well done."}, {"review_id": "1ECTvXyOMivRFBKgkugaQg", "user_id": "RMX04csWh1FO81j49MEOPQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/1/2017", "text": "Great meal.

The parking lot seemed a bit full, so we expected a wait. When we opened the first set of doors, we were greeted by a smiling hostess welcoming us and holding open the 2nd set of doors for us.  We were then welcomed again by another smiling hostess who happily told us that she could immediately seat my party of 4 if we didn't mind a table. A table was fine with us, so we followed her. Once seated, we were greeted by Jordan. He was really friendly & patient with us. He asked us if we had any questions about the menu & checked back in with us regularly to see if we had decided what we wanted.  Our order consisted of:(2) Chicken Fried Steak with smashed potatoes & gravy. Side salad with Bleu Cheese dressing without onion 1/2 lb Old Fashioned burger with fries1/3 slab of baby back ribs with mac & cheese and a baked potato with sour cream & butterThe salads were promptly brought out with 2 cornbread muffins & butter. The salad was impressive! It included bacon, diced tomatoes, diced egg, mixture of iceberg & romaine lettuce, cabbage, and croutons. It usually includes onion, but we think onions are the work of Satan, so we don't eat them.  When the food arrived at the table, we were awestruck by what was placed before us.  The food on our plates were steaming hot.  I can't remember the last time that I had food delivered to be with it steaming! Everything smelled delicious.  I helped my son cut up his chicken fried steak and was impressed with the batter that was used for the steak.  It was clearly hand dipped & not frozen.  The gravy atop the steak was delicious! It was perfect. My husband and son both ordered the chicken fried steak & my husband commented that this was the best chicken fried steak that he has ever had.  I had the baby back ribs and Mac & cheese and a baked potato. The ribs were really good.  There was a nice smoke on them & the red smoke coloring was perfect! The Mac & cheese was just insane! The flavor was rich, creamy, & cheesy. The macaroni was still firm and held its shape. The Mac & cheese was also got all the way through.  It didn't taste like it had been just heated up under the salamander then brought out to me. I didn't eat my baked potato because I was too full, so I brought it home to eat later.  My daughter ordered the Old Fashioned burger & fries and she ate the entire thing. She commented on how fresh the meat tasted & how crisp the veggies were. The burger was huge! Jordan regularly checked in with us throughout our meal. We chatted with him about the food & the restaurant and he told us that everything on the menu, aside from the Caesar dressing, was scratch made in the restaurant. We also found out that the owners live locally & still come in several times a week. It was obvious to see that they take pride in the restaurant.  I highly recommend this establishment. The prices were great. Our bill for the 4 of us was just under $60. Thank you Goodwood BBQ Company for such a great dinner & dining experience."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/goodwood-barbecue-company-meridian?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
