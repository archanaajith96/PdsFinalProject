We are here based off of other Yelpers and aren't we glad we did.Kids had their pancake breakfasts and everything was cooked perfectly.  Server was Deja and she knew the menu well and was VERY attentive. I had 2 eggs, hash browns, bacon, and the side of pancakes. Everything was fantastic. My wife had the mushroom, bacon, swiss omelet. I had a bite and it was very good also.My daughter didn't like the orange juice so my wife and I figured maybe it was from a concentrate that didn't get mixed well. Oh boy we're we surprised. It's FRESH SQUEEZED. What kind of restaurant fresh squeezes orange juice anymore. Took me back to my childhood when my dad used to hand squeeze oranges for our OJ. So good.Everything was absolutely amazing. Would highly recommend!!!"}, {"review_id": "eiAF-AuT34vf9DGMsZTaNg", "user_id": "30IQur62oIfLJYX9_-55bg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/6/2017", "text": "Very good breakfast place.
