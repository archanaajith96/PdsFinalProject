It's that kind of consideration which reflects Joe Mondello's sense of hospitality.  He and his family are some of our community's treasures.  They are what make this place great.You can get great vegetarian slices at the counter of cheese pizza, Sicilian veggie combo pizza, mushroom pizza, spinach, ricotta, and pomadoro tomatoes pizza, broccoli white pizza, tomatoes chunks white pizza.  They make an awesome Eggplant Parmigiano sandwich which we get made vegetarian style with their pizza sauce instead of their sausage sauce.If you are going to order a whole pizza and want a unique treat, try a \"Rustica\" pizza. It's a \"white pizza\" made with olive oil, garlic, pomadoro tomatoes, parmesian cheese, and AFTER it comes out of the oven is topped with fresh pieces of basil leaves. This is also where you can get the best cannoli and cappuccino in Cheyenne."}, {"review_id": "hmv6e4snQ9yRCPUyZEPa0w", "user_id": "zxOlqpXKFquEhaNWH1qCkw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "I'm so surprised is rated with 3 1/2 stars, this place is amazing! As soon as we walked in the staff was great, food was awesome, taste great, portions well served and on point, best spinach pesto ever!!!! Look for Jennifer our waitress, she made some suggestions and it was great, dessert tiramisu delicious and perfectly balanced. Worth stopping by not just for the pizza but the restaurant too, it may seem for some overpriced but totally worth it. We'll definitely be back!!"}, {"review_id": "W182FuMbLuhPiU3bebvvZg", "user_id": "bujhf9xRd3vPS4_ywLEXcQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/25/2017", "text": "Our absolute favorite pizza anywhere. Joe's been  making pizza for years, and no one does it better. Even a top-rated pizza restaurant in NYC this summer was a disappointment to our family. So I figured it was past time for me to review our favorite pizzeria!They use great cheese, a thin crust, and just the right amount of sauce. My favorite is a simple mushroom pizza, my husband loves a Joe's Favorite, and my kids usually ask for a pepperoni roll with their pizza. Pair it with a tossed salad (the dressing is so simple, but I can't seem to ever duplicate it), and then you're served in 5 minutes. Love this local little restaurant."}, {"review_id": "hlgDv1oucWXAqsPvdYPQyw", "user_id": "xbSX8k2oLA-8hrVsEWbjBg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/22/2017", "text": "This is some dang good pizza. We got the White and Joe's Favorite. Neither disappointed. The crust had that right amount of chew. The olive oil used on the pie had no awful bitter bite like some OOs can. Both pizzas had tomatoes on them, and to be honest it really complemented the sauce well. I'm starting to grow bored with white sauce pizzas, but Mondello's hits a middle ground with the inclusion of diced tomatoes. One last thing... we got larges, and those were the true NYC large pies--not the pathetic 12-inch wannabe \"large\" of the chains. I imagine an XL is the size of a manhole cover. Overall great pizza."}, {"review_id": "8K5JYZFMhwY1b-BIYC9_TQ", "user_id": "Oevc20aS8RVCc6zmZ-lUQQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/14/2017", "text": "It's definitely traditional Italian food. 100% reminds me of when I was in Rome.We had artichoke hearts romana, lamb chops, and my son had spaghetti.

The rolls were scrumptious and were served with a black olive pesto. Caesar salad was very nice, a little overdressed, but still tasty. The carbonara linguini was very rich and the sauce was delectable. Service was very good.

Best pizza in Cheyenne served with true east coast style. Try Joe's Special: Roma tomato, basil and homemade sausage... no sauce just olive oil. The perfect slice!

If you go to L'Osteria Mondello on a Friday night, you'll be treated to live Italian music- classical guitar AND opera from a very talented opera singer!The food ranges from good to passable to bad. The Alfredo with Sausage and Spaghetti with Meatballs are good. The sausage in the alfredo is a good balance to the cream sauce and cheese. The meatballs are flavorful and robust in size. The Shrimp Scampi is bland...even though it is served wading in a sea of butter. The mozzarella sticks are bad- they have a weird sweet and sour flavor...not values I ascribe to good mozzarella sticks."}, {"review_id": "IM772artaGeAyTbqohdYlw", "user_id": "Zj7oWJm_86HwBPOCNq9AuQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/25/2016", "text": "I like this place a lot; certainly the best pizza joint in Cheyenne.
