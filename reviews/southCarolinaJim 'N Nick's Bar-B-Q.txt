We were seated inside and immediately greeted by Trish, which was the start of a great lunch. Trish was personable, funny, entertaining and most important of all - super nice! It's always nice to go out to eat and have a great server who isn't fake nice and just trying to push you out the door. I ordered the baby back ribs with collards and Mac n cheese (I love Mac n cheese). The M&C was pretty good but I didn't really care for the collards. I did have a bite of my boyfriends potato salad and we both agreed that was the best side. Super yummy. The peach tea was BANGIN too! Real peach pieces come in your glass and the peach tastes sweet and really good!We really enjoyed our time here and plan to ask for Trish's section on our next visit. You should too; she's great!"}, {"review_id": "nvmasjhhktczIPIVrrglxw", "user_id": "hWV-MItCgizsNx-LkpSMNA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "In town on vacation and my friend and stopped here hoping for some good bbq. The bbq was pretty good. I got the Carolina style bbq sandwich with some potato salad and a side. The bbq wasn't spectacular but it was good. I loved the potato salad though! Super good. Unfortunately, the service was not god. Our waitress wasn't very attentive, acted like she could care less that she was there working. It took 10 minutes for her to show up to our table to get us our food order. She came to refill our drinks once, after we were basically done with our meal. Didn't make eye contact with me and was just really cold. I want to add that she appeared to be in her mid to early 40's. Not a millennial. The younger staff actually seemed way more attentive and friendly. I had high hopes for this place. Wishing it was a better experience for sure."}, {"review_id": "SFmeOLh4vejkfGtjBOH23g", "user_id": "2tr4csCw0WzIoyPSCfjqZg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "So I've been going to this place on and off for years. There's just so much competition. Other places definitely have this place beat in the service department. Walking in the one hostess wasn't very attentive. Stood there for about 5 minutes before another hostess walked up and helped to put my name on the list. She apologized and was so friendly and quick to help. Our table was ready in no time. I just wish I had the name of the hostess that was on her game because she deserves props. The server we had was just not on it. There were plenty of others hustling at other tables though. Drinks took quite some time to come out and luckily they still give out those complimentary cheddar biscuits. We asked for them since we weren't sure if they still offered them since those are the first things they usually come to the table with. They were hot and delicious once they arrived. The food is always good. The loaded mac is one of my favorites. Probably some of my favorite mac and cheese around here. Add some pulled pork to it with some of the habanero bbq sauce and it is simply perfection. The service could be a little better in some regards, but other team members certainly made up for the last visit and the food was on point."}, {"review_id": "y-7JfZndvJWvOkMRXe6s0w", "user_id": "whSSkvJRkoNgtK8cXzQ5yQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "I didn't have the food, except for their cheese biscuits, and they were amazing!

We go to the Stingrays games a lot and have never been in--will definitely not be our last time either! We were seated right away and the service was great. There is a large menu with many items to choose from to please even the pickiest eaters :). My dude got the kids burger and max&cheese, while I got brisket&coleslaw. Delicious! It came out hot and quick--but tasted very fresh. The coleslaw was DELICIOUS! The restaurant itself was very rustic and had the BBQ feel.

The hostess seemed unwelcoming or unsure of what to do when we arrived - she just kept mumbling to herself as she look at the seating chart for several minutes - I'm hoping it was her first day! ! Upon being seated, we were quickly greeted by our server who was friendly and provided good recommendations on what to order as everything on the menu looked good! The cheddar corn bread was delicious; we got a basket directly out of the oven! For my meal, I had the pulled pork plate - the pulled pork was good but had a lot of fatty chunks that were inedible; the macaroni and cheese had great flavor and was very cheesy but the baked beans were nothing special, tasted like they were out of a can. The nachos were nothing special - the cheddar cheese wasn't melted, who serves cheese on nachos not melted? There was quite a bit of pulled pork on the nachos though. The brisket and smoked chicken were good - the Home-made bbq chips were good but had minimal bbq flavor. Overall, the food was okay but very over-priced for what is worth. There are multiple other better BBQ places in Charleston. If I come back, I would just get the cheddar corn biscuits and macaroni and cheese!"}, {"review_id": "pQbouTFr1_l5TtYhMWBnIA", "user_id": "vuKPCCTM1AyHxPoYkhSlPg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "What happened to size six?

They are always a good choice for some quality barbecue and excellent complimentary cheddar muffins. I came here around 4pm on a Saturday and was seated immediately. I ordered the Carolina pulled pork sandwich with a side of fries and both were brought quickly. The cheddar muffins came after my main food but I already knew to save room for those because I know they are delicious. Just a note - The Carolina pulled pork sandwich is different from the regular pork sandwich because of its Carolina vinegar based sauce. For the regular sandwich, you can add a more traditional sweet barbecue sauce to it. I prefer tangier sauces and lean more towards mustard/vinegar base instead of ketchup which is why I went with the Carolina. Overall I left with a full and satisfied stomach. Again, Jim N Nicks always satisfies."}, {"review_id": "xVEwfhrJ2k-qQ5Wdu3UpBg", "user_id": "M7w9wpBXLZ4jStBjVQHPpw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "I've lived in the south for 2 years and just recently had my first experience here.

We put our name in and only had to wait about ten minutes even though they said it would be a twenty five minute wait. We were seated at a booth. The side that my friend and I sat at was wet, which was kinda weird. We later found out it was because the air conditioner or vent was dripping above it. It was dripping water on me so I moved over a bit. Our server was super nice. We ordered onion rings to start. For my entree I ordered the Carolina pork sandwich with baked beans and macaroni and cheese. We got some cheddar biscuits for the table. They were amazing. They were moist, sweet, salty and addicting. I ate two of them. The onions rings came after we devoured all the biscuits. They were alright. They came with some pretty sweet ketchup. Our entrees came very quickly. I tried the macaroni and cheese first. It was my favorite out of my whole plate. It was cheesy, creamy, salty goodness. My pork was alright. It was tender and moist, it was just that the sauce had too much vinegar for me. It made me pucker. The baked beans were cooked well and not too sweet. it was a filling and comforting meal with great service."}, {"review_id": "piVn6mHGDN-LB3c86BLACA", "user_id": "hwhw4GwFC9GOPHPguwKGNA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/24/2017", "text": "I've never been here before. I had really high hopes, because I've heard so many great things about Jim \"N\" Nicks.  The smell was fantastic, I felt like \"Pepe La Pew\" as I drifted through the air, following the intoxicating aroma in the front doors. The atmosphere was also good, I really liked the look of the restaurant and how clean it was. Our server was Crystal, and she was fantastic. Friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and didn't let our glasses get empty.  The food was a hit and miss. First the \"Hits\" The cheese muffins were very tasty, definitely a \"hit\". My wife's loaded baked potato was delicious and satisfying (and huge, even though it was a \"small one\" for the lunch special). The Mac and Cheese I had as one of my sides was to die for!!! Now the \"Misses\" The Homemade BBQ Chips with blue cheese dip had a lot of the chips that were wet, very off putting. I got the Classic BBQ Plate, the BBQ (star of the show) was very bland, no seasoning. While on the other hand, my coleslaw side dish was overloaded with way to much pepper!  All in all it's not a bad stop, more positives than negatives. As of right now we don't plan on returning, at least not at this location. Maybe another location's food will be more consistent."}, {"review_id": "hzGZeIV9y6hNIYCVIfIFpA", "user_id": "XWoOSix6OvYyz7EuwvnPdA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Every time I come here I'm just so pleased !

I had a brisket sandwich with a loaded baked potato (hold the bacon) and fried green tomatoes. Everything was delicious, fried green tomatoes were seasoned nicely and had a good crunch. The meat had that smoked flavor you look for when you eat authentic BBQ. My son had the mac and cheese and because of the mom tax I got to taste his and it was great!

It tasted alright but I guess if I ever order a burger again I'll beige specific. The BBQ plates are actually really good and tasty. It's always crowded during lunch and the service is about average. My coworkers are obsessed with this place and their cheese biscuits and I am just puzzled lol. I do like the lemonade and mix tea drinks they have.
