They definitely made us feel welcomed and that was very much appreciated. Second, the food was great, everyone enjoyed their dishes and we loved the green salsa that they served, definitely had some real spice the some other Mexican spots seem to take away due to the American taste palette being less able to handle spicy food. Lastly, aother good note is that they had a vegetarian option for almost every item. I was so glad to see this as ordering a vegetarian torta is often a weird request for many spots, but sure enough they had it and it was very delicious! They also hand make their special waters like the watermelon, pineapple, etc. whenever it is ordered so they're definitely fresh and delicious. I definitely recommend this spot if you want some vegetarian and vegan Mexican food!"}, {"review_id": "EFC11NLWKPDpdLmu2CKYbg", "user_id": "XbhH9pj9FgHw_o5kWY-9Xg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/13/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Went today.  Tacos seem much smaller.

The icing was great but the cake texture was odd, and there was surprise soft fruit between the layers that sent my texture OCD into fits.  AND...my fault...i didn't ask if there were nuts in it.  There are.  Can't eat nuts,  so that ended badly.  If you can't have nuts don't try it."}, {"review_id": "dUwOGNpGrmrjUewAvgejaA", "user_id": "jcWXCTaLGHK8McNK-2kh_A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Great Mexican food the tacos were so good come here every time I'm in Shreveport the staff are friendly with good price"}, {"review_id": "DHcDzlIZkd_bZIal8LLUTw", "user_id": "buos-BJIivZh0-j5ufku7Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Out trying something new for lunch and found these taco.

All the tacos! Every single flavor of taco! Served in corn tortillas the seasonings are perfection. I started with the carnitas - soft and succulent meat, topped with cilantro, onions, coming with a slice of lime, plus a spicy salsa verda sauce! Then the chorizo and potato tacos!! Covered in the same goodness as the carnitas! I didn't let that stop the addition of the incredible guacamole and queso dip!! All individually delicious, but together OMG YES!!   The guacamole is maybe some of the most amazing guacamole I've ever tasted anywhere! The balance of ingredients is optimal perfection!! The fresh avocado, lime, garlic, cilantro, onion, salt and a great dash of damn that good! Queso dip was yum too. Creamy cheeses, tomato, sweet peppers, and spice. The chips are fresh deep fried corn tortillas! Hot in the basket they practically melt in your mouth!!"}, {"review_id": "CsRje7tbRMMYHMYXji2nDw", "user_id": "Z0kJqD4tIlI7wMo3Z_jO0w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "The BEST authentic Mexican restaurant in Shreveport-Bossier.

Great sign we were in for some cheap and authentic food.Once you enter, turn right and order at the counter. We ordered based on the menu above the cashier but noticed the menus on the counter after we placed our order.If you know what you want, no big deal but there is a variety on the menu.Ordered steak and al pastor tacos, steak burrito no salsa for the Mini, and barbacoa torta for myself. 5 stars all around.Authentic, hot, and fresh. We love these street taco type of food. Barbacoa is beef cheeks (teeny bit of fat) and that's what makes it flavorful, moist and delicious. Stick to steak and al pastor if fat is not your thing. Otherwise, I love the BARBACOA!Horchata was standard. Posole is served on Saturday and Menudo on Sunday only.Restroom is gender neutral and clean. Can't wait to return and try their other items.Don't let the exterior and interior fool you, try this place out!"}, {"review_id": "hlrHsw1W0IJH9MyK8yuLoA", "user_id": "Wj3sjm4TuS6Uz78Z8mcQCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "I want to give this place 1000 stars.

Ordered three tacos, one each lengua, tripas and potatoes/chorizo. My wife ordered two tacos, so five tacos a la carte came to  $16. I have eaten many a similar taco from food trucks in California for five or six bucks...just sayin'.On to the tacos. They came with a small plastic thing of salsa verde which was pretty good, a Serrano pepper and a couple wedges of lime. Ate the tripitas first which I shared with my wife, we both agreed, very nice, tripas cooked perfect, not chewy. Next up, the potatoes-chorizo; didn't see or taste chorizo although the potatoes did look the color of chorizo grease. Finally the lengua. The tongue was chopped into very small greasy cubes which made it difficult to appreciate that succulent flavor I so love in beef tongue.Granted we only sampled one item on the menu and I was inclined to give three stars for the tripas alone. However the attitude the cashier copped when I asked her to repeat something not only lost a star, it also gauranteed we won't be coming back. Too bad."}, {"review_id": "R4qnprAO6dRtkzokJ2CxYA", "user_id": "03NqehiNeCsQmGJJ-MeTgw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "Best tacos I've found in Shreveport, hands down. I travel throughout Latin America quite a bit for work, and I never imagined I would find authentic Mexican-style tacos in Shreveport. This place has them, and they're legit. The restaurant itself isn't fancy, but it proves the axiom that small hole-in-the-wall type restaurants often have the best food. I had tacos al pastor (Mexican-style marinated pork), and they were as good as anything I've had in Mexico. The prices are very reasonable, and the staff is very friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone seeking authentic, non-Americanized, tacos. I can't wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "SgiI0zkzBtFgFLG4fdWHlw", "user_id": "fhhLRWTjFzQIZmriIlA2bQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "The chips tasted old/stale. My tortas was bland; the only flavor came from the really spicy green sauce. My girlfriend's bean and cheese burrito didn't taste good either (she said she preferred the Walmart's frozen burritos better). Up next was a beef empanada; the outer covering tasted like bad cornbread, and the meat was also tasteless. The grilled steak tacos was decent, and same with the queso. The strawberry cake (tres leches) was good in flavor but texture was not soft. It was probably old. Service was good though; they were nice, and it may have just been an off day. However, we were really disappointed with the food with the store coming up as one of the best places to eat at Shreveport."}, {"review_id": "iEfEEghN7CYLpbun2id1Uw", "user_id": "OyAEx0hdcttd-Q9PTcz94g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/12/2017", "text": "Holy crap... These tacos are slap yo mama good... Eating the chorizo taco is like a journey for one's mouth. First it starts smooth, with just a little crunch from the shells. Then the chorizo begins to get a little crunchy itself, not much, just enough to accentuate the flavor. At the end of the taco the grease has built up into a final crescendo of a magical meat musical playing out on your taste buds.

We're all Mexican so Mexican food has to be really really good or sometimes getting mad lol.. so I took them here and it was a ball!!

The whole atmosphere is really family oriented and casual. The food was super well served and so so tasty!! I'm coming back asap!!!

I liked it too. If you are hungry and want something fast and yummy, Pork torta is the best answer! Plus, their prices are super lovely!

Especially for the price. The chorizo and al pastor are delish. Barbacoa was a bit fatty, but still very rich and full of flavor. Fresh toppings and a delicious, spicy green sauce to top things off. Now Ki Mexico is REALLY good too, but their tacos serve a different demographic and not as easy on the wallet. I'd recommend it over La Michoacana for a nice evening with friends of good food, craft beer on tap, and live music.However, If you're looking for something simple, affordable, and DELICIOUS, check out La Michoacana!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-la-michoacana-shreveport-2?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
