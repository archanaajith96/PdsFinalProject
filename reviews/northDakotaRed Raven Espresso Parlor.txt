I was very excited when I walked in and saw the poster that stated- surprise surprise- that they served Raven's Brew coffee. Coincidentally, Raven's Brew is probably my favourite overall coffee brand, so lucky me! Over my many visits, I have ordered the Foggy Earl with soy milk and the Cuban espresso. I must say, the barista that I had was very nice and even made some beautiful foam art in my father's cup! The grunge atmosphere was very appreciated by us dirty punks, and we especially enjoyed the white freaky dentures thing that was posed on a piece of furniture. The Foggy Earl was exquisitely steeped and the amount of milk was just perfect. Tasted like liquid gold! Overall, I love this cute little joint, and will visit every time I am in Fargo!"}, {"review_id": "b5AQPEhKBwxa3WWhjsS2QQ", "user_id": "b0Sbl2PoEspereMg3h0ysQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/10/2017", "text": "Madness congeals in this place.I encountered a stranger, here, who may have been on the run from the law. Earlier that night, in a moment of telestic rage, he had thrown a violin over the counter of a nearby bar, causing significant damage to its glasswares. When pressed about what had possessed him to do this, he laughed, and explained that it had been an act of performance art. He then described to me the geometry of the universe, and how it related to progressive metal as a genre. As he did so, the depth of his pupils extended beyond the breadth of his skull.Years later, I spotted him again, in Ax-Man Surplus in St. Paul. Despite the brevity of our previous encounter, I could never forget his face. He did not remember this particular incident, but confessed that it sounded like something he would have done at that point in his life.He was one of many. There, I played chess with a trembling folk musician who begged me for game after game to take his mind off \"something terrible he had just done.\" I spoke with an oracle whose mind trailed behind her tongue as she told me that I had been abandoned by fate. I wrote a novel alongside a former lucid dreamer, who had been barred from his capabilities after violating the laws of unconsciousness.The service here is good, but coffee shops are not defined by the quality of their beans, or the particular skills of their baristas- while these play a role in our pleasures, they are by no means paramount. They are instead spaces where we demand to be disconnected and productive, until happenstance convinces us otherwise. Alongside espresso, we purchase challenges to our own presence, inviting an ambient reality to transform solitude into something else.This place will accept your invitation. It will seep through the sagittal fissure of your skull, then drip downward like candle wax until it coalesces in your solar plexus. All excess sanity will be dissolved, leaving behind only what you need."}, {"review_id": "W4Po-6LI_kFDmywLC6VLZg", "user_id": "d_lpeMZNVRU0d-t50BGQ6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2015", "text": "On hearing that I would be traveling to Fargo for work, a friend suggested I visit Red Raven as they had recently been in the news for banning anti-gay North Dakota legislators.  As a member of the LGBT community who travels frequently, I do like to keep up with what states and municipalities are banning me from breathing and spending money this week (news flash: mine is just as green as anyone else's, and will pay your bills just the same) so I was glad to check out a space where I knew I would be welcome.  I came into Red Raven on a Tuesday morning to find the place all but empty, so I got to chat with one of the owners.  He explained the history of the recent events, which had had them in the news quite a bit, and I picked a table, ordered tea, and set up to work.  The space is everything I want in a local community spot.  Coffee for the coffee drinkers, tea for those of us who appreciate it, other beverages as appropriate, local art, zines, a pleasant environment for working or hanging out, and it takes that extra step to become if not a center for community organizing then at least a space where a lot of local activists hang out and it's obviously used as a performance venue as well.  I ended up getting two beverages, a yerba mate and then a latte made with black tea with pomegranate.  The latte was one of the best I've ever had, and the yerba mate was extremely pleasant.  I was also very happy with seating options and lighting, which managed to hit that perfect level where it's neither dark nor bright but it's totally possible to see what you're doing.  I have no idea when I will next be in Fargo, but Red Raven is a rare gem."}, {"review_id": "k6ixsvxhDHY2yCB8L_1Xrg", "user_id": "1i0lUq6I3K6dvn211dEsaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/25/2015", "text": "All my prior visits to the Red Raven only involved drinks and baked goods.  Recently, I visited for a lunch meeting and I have to say I was very impressed.  While the lunch options were very limited (3-5 items), I know I will be coming back.  I ordered the Artichoke and Humus sandwich, which comes with a side side salad.  And the price was only $4.50!  Initially, artichoke and humus doesn't jump out as something I would normally get.  The taste and texture of the sandwich was perfect.  The bread was toasted and the cheese melted.  I added a glass bottle of Coke to my order.  To top off the experience, we ate on the patio which is off the alley through the back door.  The weather was perfect and their patio is quaint & comfortable as it is surrounded on three sides by 2 story brick buildings - which gives a different vibe than you experience at other traditional patios in Fargo."}, {"review_id": "6PoSQbCIq8lSqnyx6jufzQ", "user_id": "1_m3xqhr3pzjiOA0iaQKqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2017", "text": "I was referred by a friend, that raves about the place.

With press coverage for supporting LGBTQ rights, providing space for a hip hop show that other venues have turned their backs to, and other actions that may be deemed as controversial by some, this venue stands up for providing a safe space for those feeling marginalized. As for the food and drink, the coffee is good and I love the vegan sandwiches. Interesting music is always playing, from David Lynch to techno pop. Live events are usually going on nightly, from comedy to bluegrass jams.There is a backroom available for small meetings and a stage for performances. There is rotating art on the walls and the building has an interesting feel with the faint resemblance of the fire department that it once was and with a few couches and lounge chairs it's easy to get comfy. I recommend sitting at the bar and chatting with the barista or meeting locals that some by and sit nearby."}, {"review_id": "8xyl44uoylj8cxPnH741aQ", "user_id": "s9PVjBMZFYeBtXz1elmZ8w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2015", "text": "I'm writing this review as I sit in Red Raven.  This place is the definition of hipster, and I love it already.  Provocative art lines the walls of this cozy spot.  The furniture gives this place a homey vibe, and the tables are nice and big- good for studying.  The green tea latte gets an A++ in my book.  It's delish and comes in a cute, hipster-y cup too.

That might bias me). Red Raven is my absolute favorite downtown hangout.  Sure it serves as an excellent place to caffeine up, work, relax, enjoy entertainment or the passers-by.  But the absolute best part of Red Raven is that its a representative microcosmos of the developing FM community, a hodgepodge of interesting things and people.
