If you are looking for something different, try the \"wrong ramen\". It has many of the delicious flavors you may look for in a traditional ramen, but mixes them with some \"Hawaiian\" style ingredients including a fried egg, spam, and bacon. There's even large chunks of BBQ pork. Let's just call it porkalicious. Very tasty and the closet thing to \"breakfast\" ramen I've ever had.Overall, this place has a good vibe, attentive service and good prices. Definitely worth a stop."}, {"review_id": "L9W52E5LXLPLosYtSGTwoQ", "user_id": "qFTVZZivXlS9U9SXm2HSlA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "This place is bomb. The ramen is so good.

Majority of them have been pretty decent. This is no exception. It was pretty good, with a few things I want to mention that was not my favorite. So again, with ramen I want to break it down piece by piece so you have a good understanding of it. I ordered their signature dish, plain and simple Tonkotsu ramen. Now don't get it confused with Tonkatsu, because that is fried pork cutlet on a bed of rice, completely different than Tonkotsu. Anyways...Broth: The broth at Tonkotsu Ramen Bar was hot, which a liked. The broth will set the town for how everything else will taste, because everything else is sitting in the broth. The broth was pretty good, not bad, but wished it had more richness and depth to it. I feel as if the broth was taken out prematurely before it could get more of the flavors out. Okay broth, brought out hot, had a nice white color to it, so the characteristics of the tonkotsu broth is there. Noodle: Tonkotsu ramen is usually accompanied by thin noodles. This place uses thin noodles and it paired well. It was cooked al dente, easy to chew ad there were no clumps that I found within the ramen. Very good noodlesMenma: Menma is a japanese condiment which uses bamboo shoots that are fermented. The menma should be soft, but not mushy, but also have some crisp to it, not too crispy though. I really did not like the menma they used here. Im not sure if its just the distributors they use, but the menma did not taste good.Charsiu: The charsiu was pretty good. Things I look for is a nice amount of fat, depth of flavor from being marinated and slow cooked, does it melt in your mouth or atleast fall apart pretty easily, which means that the slow cooked process broke those muscles down, in which you get a nice tender piece of meat. Tonkotsu did not fail and did a great job with their charsiu.Egg: The egg is my fave part of the ramen. Seasoned egg that has been soft boiled is awesome. The yolk is nice and creamy and has a soy sauce taste which compliments everything in the dish. Tonkotsu did well in that. I'd love to give this pace another shot, I want to try other things on their menu before saying \"This place isn't right for me\", I always like giving a place a chance so I can try more from them and see what else they have to offer!"}, {"review_id": "iJWWuovE2Y068BVnSm9N6Q", "user_id": "VWv1hF_7WBaayXGcTuYQgA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "Love everything I've had- udon, ramen, gyozachos, mango  creamy soda.Only issue is parking and I sat in some food jaja..The staff is very friendly and patient."}, {"review_id": "fs3FJ9FNfTZaAcqInZVDpQ", "user_id": "DVpQeKbs_MyjLz4jyRD0lw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "Oh my goodness. After the nth amazing experience eating here, the perfection of tonight's Tonkotsu ramen bowl has inspired me to write my first Yelp review and declare to the world that this must be the best ramen place in Utah!It starts with fast and friendly service; I've never waited for a seat. The Tonkotsu ramen bowl I ordered was served in just a few minutes. The restaurant is small with a casual, hip atmosphere. A cute wooden soup spoon adds a nice touch to the whole experience. The Tonkotsu ramen comes with a big piece of pork, green onion, bean sprouts, chewy bamboo sprouts, and an egg soft-boiled to oozy perfection. All this and many mouthfuls of chewy noodles bathe in one of the tastiest broths, ever. It's the perfect huge meal for a cold day!I've also tried the Poke; delicious though I'd say the salmon is a little sauce-heavy. Haven't tried much else because I'm hooked on the Tonkotsu ramen.I love that there are so many different and creative items on the menu (like WTF Ramen) for every mood. It's my go-to ramen place for guests, who love it too!"}, {"review_id": "YsdXYp2uKcPZ7i2Ke3sEeQ", "user_id": "O2S3z-MJ01Vyt3fGvD7ISg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "This is probably the best ramen place I've had in all of Utah the bulgogi fries are to die for I also got the WTF ramen it has sausage and spam WOW I loved it for sure I recommend this ramen bar to anyone looking for authentic ramen."}, {"review_id": "iniYJ-VQOJrN6NNTfQCNaw", "user_id": "0dzu0o1MuETzECO0l03XLQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "I've been here a few times whenever I'm craving ramen, and I can say out of the small list of legit ramen places in Utah, this place is worth your tastebuds. While I normally go for their traditional Tonkotsu ramen, I opted for the crazy \"WTF Ramen\" that had kimchi, spam, meatballs, egg, onions and happiness. Sooooo good! It's one of the items on the special menu. I also noticed the menu has Asian-style fries and nacho appetizers that looked appealing, so maybe I'll give those a shot next time. Whether you're looking for a meat frenzy like mine or the vegetarian options, you definitely get your money's worth eating here. What To Get: can't go wrong with the traditional Tonkotsu ramen, but if you're adventurous, go for the WTF Ramen"}, {"review_id": "TM1fc78PC1-oKToSCyjVdg", "user_id": "GQxXjGUc4xolCVzZvts9zw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "This is actually pretty good.

I heard a lot of good things about Tonkatsu. I really liked the design of the restaurant , parking is a bit cramped but manageable. I really like how creative the menu items are and they have other options if you aren't feeling ramen such as rice bowls, bao buns, chicken wings, and sushi. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen since I'm a fan of black Japanese ramen, I really like the garlic taste , if I had to add one thing to the ramen is adding more veggies and possibly a fish cake. I will be back to try the other items. I went back another night when they had their half off special, the Tonkatsu ramen tasted amazing as always And Is my favorite. I went another night with a group of friends and wanted to something different so I opted for the Hawaiian style ramen, it had  the Tonkatsu broth with spam, over easy egg, chatsu pork and bacon, it was good but it was a lot of meat I was overwhelmed by how much pork product was in it so I suggest you keep it simple with the ramen and go with the usual, my friend ordered the WTF ramen which had more of a spicy broth and had chunks of kimchi and Korean fish cake in it, great choose if you love some spice and Korean flavor.Only thing I was disappointed with was the Takoyaki appetizer, it was undercooked inside and the dough was still raw, not sure I would order it again."}, {"review_id": "B3bsiOSJxIlDdZR0UbPTCA", "user_id": "t2QCZ7K6qs8DdhVI19Mr3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/11/2018", "text": "Tonkotsu ramen bar is an ESSENTIAL West Valley restaurant-not just for ramen lovers.

Cold day so we were feeling some warm ramen. This place didn't disappoint! We ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen and the Miso Ramen, along with some Takoyaki (lovingly called \"squid balls\" by me and my friends). Tonkotsu ramen: broth was excellent and the pork was very tender. The noodles were not soggy. Surprisingly decent ramen for Utah. The only complaint I have here is that the soft boiled egg was cold in the middle (this ramen still doesn't top Jin's in Syracuse). Miso ramen: my friend ordered this one and she seemed please with it. Both of us having been to Japan make us a bit more picky than most about ramen. There was corn in this dish. While that seemed odd to me, apparently it isn't that odd. Her egg was also cold on the inside.Takoyaki: so far, this is the best takoyaki I've been able to find it Utah, but it still isn't up to par. They were a bit too gooey in the middle, not something me nor my bestie were a huge fan of texture wise. And we've eaten our fair share of takoyaki. I feel like a bit longer in the fryer would have made these perfect. Service: it was sub par. The original server we had apparently went home as halfway through we had a new server. They weren't very attentive and it took a while for them to even place our order. Mind you - it was around 1:30 pm and we were one of maybe three tables in the restaurant. Atmosphere: this is my favorite part about the restaurant! The traditional japanese style artwork on the walls and lighting is beautiful. You'll need to go visit to check it out. All in all, it's not my favorite ramen shop in Utah, but it is a decent one. I plan on coming back to try the \"hot pots\"."}, {"review_id": "NTLvpHy7ooEYPjR1SXJqUQ", "user_id": "DiKAmK2c2aNcxUDT_amxsA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Had some time to kill before our flight so my friends and I went to get some ramen.  Got the tonkotsu ramen which was surprisingly good considering we were in Utah and in a plaza with mostly Mexican shops and restaurants.  Would have liked the egg to be more of soft boil though.  We also got bulgogi fries which were decent but the meat was a bit sweet.

In particular a Japanese curry snob. I've eaten a lot of restaurant curry and prepared quite a bit myself. I'm the guy that gets excited when curry is served with the red fujinsuke pickled garnish and have my own private stash at home. I'm the guy who tackled a curry challenge in Japan of 2.2 lbs of rice and curry in 16 mins (20 min max) to get a free meal.So we happened to be in the neighborhood which we have been in more lately because of renting vehicles from Enterprise. Tonkotsu is across the street and we had just dropped off a car so we thought we would give it a chance. We got our food to go. I'm only going to review my meal which was actually Tonkatsu (I'm not sure why they have the name misspelled but it is). I got home and the tonkatsu looked way overly cooked with a very dark brown/black edge along the fried pork cutlet. I was so hungry and now 20+ minutes away from going back to have it redone I thought I would proceed anyway. I could only eat half. The meat itself was very tough which considering the burnt look would be expected but on top of that there was definitely a freezer burned taste to the meat as well.Even worse however was the curry itself. I've never had any curry ever, anywhere that was as bland as what was provided to me. Usually curry restaurants will ask how spicy you would like but these guys didn't but honestly on a scale of 1-10 of spicy it didn't even register a 1. More like a mere hint of curry. They did have the red fujinsuke which was rare and a nice touch but that doesn't even come close to fixing that meal. So why two stars you may ask? Well they have enough other menu items that are interesting to me that hopefully they'll do better next time and I find a new favorite spot. That and I hate to rate a restaurant on just one meal and no in restaurant service experience. So for now 2 stars with a possibility of more (and possibly less) in the future. I hope the one meal was an exception and not a rule."}, {"review_id": "91EP1321cMNCUPJQzbk7ag", "user_id": "XEUcVQdQOmLGwECvDLfaoQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/30/2017", "text": "West Valley gets a bad rap. But I love the food here. It is a cultural and culinary oasis in the racial desert that is Utah.So here's the deal. The ramen at Tonkotsu ain't that good. I tried the Tantanmen because I like spice but even their spiciest ramen was hard pressed for flavor. It would have been much better with pork broth instead of chicken but they probably decided the pork chashu and the ground pork were enough pork flavor for one bowl. I digress. I added the kikurage (thinly sliced woodear mushrooms) but they had zero taste and thus added zero value for the upcharge. Also, the noodles were exactly like the kind you'd find in a $0.10 freeze dried package. College days, anyone? Pass.I wouldn't come back for the ramen but I'm all over the sushi here. We tried the OC roll which is crab (not sure if it was actually crab or \"crab\") and avocado with salmon and thinly sliced lemon on top. Weird but delicious. The rolls won't impress any hipster sushi purists but they satisfied me just fine. About $10 per roll which doesn't drain the wallet and is a fine meal in itself.Service was great."}, {"review_id": "xao1VFk28kj1xA2tw6-PhQ", "user_id": "_iTMz44lNhdmfDjBhQuvMw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/17/2017", "text": "A cozy spot in West Valley and a perfect place for a winter dinner.
