There's a lot of booths and have lots of privacy when dinning. Restrooms are very clean.My husband ordered fillet mignon and shrimp hibachi dinner and I ordered vegetable hibachi dinner. Both came with salad, soup and fried rice. The waiter is very good at his job and is friendly.My husband likes his whole meal and I like their fried rice very much. The hibachi is a little bit too salty for me. We kept drinking water afterwards probably because of how much salt they use.The only thing my husband doesn't like is the music."}, {"review_id": "vrcThTA2tQ8BghmscZ6XVg", "user_id": "5jXyJtqB3l4x9ZMSTbeSjw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "The brief experience I had here was not particularly pleasurable. I ordered take out and came in to pick it up. I stood at the front for about 3 minutes waiting for someone to help me. I'd understand if the restaurant was full, but only about 3 tables and 2 barstools were in use at the time. I ordered the duck and pineapple fried rice, and it didn't taste good.

COME here.. do not hesitate.. run fast.  We have come back 4 nights in a row.. and sadly will be leaving wv.. but if im ever even remotely close ill be stopping back.."}, {"review_id": "IxxSBWJF2-zxT519XKN5CA", "user_id": "rOaYvAjuROiEgU_y4TPZEg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/10/2017", "text": "Thoroughly enjoyed the food.

So we came as a group of 6! It was a slightly late lunch. It was a little quiet in the restaurant, but it wasn't too bad! I loved how it was half off specialty rolls on Saturday! I ended up getting one of those! We were seated quickly and the manager was so nice and accommodating. The server who came to be our waitress was so nice! Her name was Lucy and she was amazing!! She was soo patient and we were all so needy! We had someone in our party change their order like 3 times. And she didn't miss a beat! Then everyone had modifications and questions about the menu. She was able to make all those changes and it went perfectly! I loved how she was knowledgeable about the menu too! We ordered, the beef udon, the duck unwrap lettuce wraps, pad Thai w/egg, the Hiroshima special roll, side of fried rice, lightly fried tofu, red spicy chicken coconut curry and hibachi veggies.Everything was really good!!! Everyone started off with some soup&salad!! Yum!!! Then after that, my unwrap duck appetizer came. YUM!! The portions were really large!! And I really loved how tender and juicy the duck was! They really gave out a lot of duck. I definitely recommend this!!!My special Hiroshima roll was okay. It was the only downside. It wasn't that much spicy tuna and it wasn't spicy at all!! I did like the look and the fish on the outside of the roll. But I'd never pay the full price for it! I will say, it's extremely filling!!! I couldn't even finish it!! I tried the pad Thai and it's good! A little mild and closer to the sweeter side. They don't have the bean sprouts or the bean curd, but they do put in a lot of good egg!! The veggies are good too and the portion is good too!! Only complaint is that it isn't authentic. they are lacking the lime citrus aspect. there is nothing spicy about it But nonetheless, it was an extremely good price and good in general. They also don't use the correct noodles. The coconut red chicken curry was excellent!! I would get this next time! It's AMAZING! so many good flavours and a lot of chicken! Good portions and the coconut aftertaste and milkiness is just perfection! Everyone else liked their food too! I love how the drinks came in really big glasses and it was free refills!! I love that! We loved everything so much that we got dessert!! Yum!! I ended up getting the sticky rice and my dining companions ordered the banana fried egg roll. Both were just okay. They weren't 'amazing', but they weren't bad. My biggest complaint about mine was it wasn't traditional at all! They had chocolate sauce instead of the traditional milky condensed milk. So that was a downside. But because the service was so nice, they had free wifi, and the prices and portions were AMAZING, this place gets a 5/5 stars!!! If I came back through, I probably wouldn't get the sushi. It's too Americanised and it's not made really well. But the curry is amazing!! I really can't wait to come back!"}, {"review_id": "_rUJuTMOenFDnStWBussYA", "user_id": "65lZ9qFH1OQ8Vp8573rR-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/5/2017", "text": "Yelp for the win! On a long trip back to Michigan from South Carolina, we decided to stop in Charleston for dinner at our half way point.  I was gonna to stop at a regular chain restaurant but seeing these high ratings made me change my mind. My husband and I love Thai food so we gave it a try and we were not disappointed. The decor was really nice, and the service was great. Our waiter was talkative, friendly, and kept the food coming.  The food was delicious. I got the teriyaki chicken hibachi and my husband got the chicken pad Thai. We also had some sushi rolls as starters.  We will definitely stop here again if we're on the road in WV."}, {"review_id": "I_TeVaGUGwG5qZX2BKg15Q", "user_id": "SjvZj-PpWRQr7TLKS7T1Rw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/28/2016", "text": "Came here with my girlfriend while visiting Charleston. We were surprised to find an upscale sushi restaurant so close to where we were staying, so we had to give this place a try.The inside is really nice with some classy booths and cool decor. Unfortunately that's probably the best part of the restaurant.We ordered 3 sushi rolls (Hiroshima, Salmon Skin, and Eel & Avocado) as well as the Pad Thai. The sushi rolls were disappointing generally. The Eel & Avocado was unremarkable and the Salmon Skin was too chewy rather than crunchy. Regarding the Hiroshima specialty roll, it was tasty but way overpriced. Where I'm from you can get a similar roll for about $5 cheaper.The Pad Thai was definitely the highlight for us, though we only had a few bites before packing it up to take home. Suffice it to say, we had no trouble finishing it the next day.The worst part of the night was probably the incredibly long wait for our food. I will say that the place seemed extraordinarily busy (apparently due to some kind of college formal), but there is really no excuse to take more than a half hour to bring out the soup and salad.I'm guessing that Charleston suffers from a scarcity of sushi places which allows this place to get away with mediocre food, slow service and high prices."}, {"review_id": "J43YLDAtOk8c1_TUF_zYPQ", "user_id": "F6rSXg3fxONu485Evh3aCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "Sushi was the best around.

The first thing I noticed about the restaurant is that it smelled unpleasant. Something between mildew and cleaning products. Not appetizing, and I hope we just caught them on an off day. The booths were comfortable, though, and server was very friendly and attentive. The vegan in our party got pineapple rice with tofu, which had a lovely presentation in a half pineapple, and he enjoyed the dish. Others got sushi, which was not good at all. The spicy salmon roll may as well have been canned salmon, it was honestly inedible.

To start off, there were multiple hairs in my hibachi vegetables. Then a person who was not my server brings out two orders of spicy tuna rolls. At the end of my meal, the waitress confirms that I had only ordered one tuna roll despite being charged for both. So she goes to try to correct it and I hear the owner SHOUTING at her from the back. It was the most unprofessional thing I have ever witnessed at a restaurant. I ended up paying for both the rolls after the owner refused to rectify the mistake because I felt sorry for the waitress having to put up with such behavior. Needless to say, I won't be back because not only should I not have had to pay for the owner's mistake, I will not support businesses who treat their employees so badly. And by the way, the place smells like sewage and they've never gotten it fixed.

When I got there, there were about 15 people in the restaurant and it took way too long for me and the man in front of me to get our take out and they missed things on both of our orders.
